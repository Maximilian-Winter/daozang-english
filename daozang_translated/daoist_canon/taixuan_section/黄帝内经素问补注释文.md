**Overview of *The Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon: *Suwen***:**
Your servant has heard that those who remember safety must not forget peril, and those who cherish life must not forget death—this was the foremost concern of the ancient sages. Those who seek to remedy the people’s afflictions and alleviate their suffering—this is the profound benevolence of the sovereign.

In ancient times, when the Yellow Emperor ruled, he used the principles of the Dao to govern his body and the remaining teachings to bring order to the world. Seated in the Hall of Enlightenment, he surveyed the eight extremes, examined the establishment of the five constants.

He declared: "Human life begins by drawing in **Yin** while embracing **Yang**, nourished by flavors and shaped by colors. From without, there are the opposing forces of cold and heat; from within, the conflicting emotions of joy and anger. Sudden death and lingering illness alternate in succession, affecting the state."

When he wished to enumerate the five blessings of the times and bestow them upon the common people, he questioned **Qìbó** (岐伯) extensively—from the highest celestial patterns to the deepest terrestrial principles, from distant phenomena of the cosmos to nearby observations of the human body. Together they deliberated, refined the teachings, and transmitted them to benefit future generations.

Thus, the lineage of **Léigōng** (雷公) and others received the doctrine and passed it down, and *The Inner Canon* was composed. Across the ages, it has been treasured without loss.

When the **Zhōu** (周) dynasty flourished, **Qín Hé** (秦和) expounded the theories of the six **qi** (气), which were recorded in the *Left Classic*.

Later, the **Yuè** (越) people obtained fragments of these teachings and expanded upon them to create *The Canon of Difficulties*.

In the Western Han dynasty, **Cāng Gōng** (仓公) transmitted the ancient doctrines, and in the Eastern Han, **Zhōngjīng** (仲景) compiled the remaining theories. During the Jin dynasty, **Huángfù Mì** (皇甫谧) followed with *The Canon of A and B*, and in the Sui dynasty, **Yáng Shàngshàn** (杨上善) compiled it as *The Grand Essentials*.

Later, **Quán Yuánqǐ** (全元起) was the first to write *The Explanatory Commentary*, though he omitted the seventh and eleventh chapters.

By the time of the Tang dynasty’s **Bǎoyìng** (宝应) era, **Wáng Bīng** (王冰), the Grand Steward, deeply cherished this work. He obtained the original scrolls from his predecessors and meticulously annotated them, preserving the ancient texts of the Three Sovereigns in their pristine splendor.

Alas, in the Tang dynasty, this work was relegated to the hands of mere practitioners, and scholars of high standing rarely cultivated it. Distant from the sages, its principles grew obscured, leading to conflicting annotations and convoluted interpretations.

The remnants of the *Three Primordial Classics*, the lofty aspirations of sovereigns, the deeds of sages—when **Emperor Yao** ordained the four seasons, **Emperor Shun** harmonized the seven celestial movements, **Divine Yu** cultivated the Six Palaces to achieve imperial glory, **King Wen** expounded the Six Children to align with the *coalescent qi*, **I Yin** regulated the Five Flavors to serve the sovereign, and **Ji Zi** expounded the Five Phases to aid the world—all these pursuits share a singular aim.

Yet how could the most refined and subtle **Dao** be entrusted to the most vulgar and shallow of people? That it was not abandoned is already a fortunate thing.

During the **Jiayou** era, the **Ren Zong** emperor, mindful of the legacy of his august ancestor, feared its loss to oblivion. He thus commissioned scholars to study and rectify it. We, as humble officials entrusted with editorial duties, reflected deeply for a decade.

We then scoured both court and private collections, gathering myriad versions, gradually discerning their meanings, and correcting errors. We recovered three or four out of ten, though the rest remain incomplete. We deemed this insufficient to honor the imperial edict or fulfill the sage’s intent. Additionally, we consulted the *Han* and *Tang* dynastic records of ancient medical classics still extant, obtaining several dozen works to cross-examine and verify.

We wove together disparate strands, synthesizing their insights—sometimes tracing roots to understand branches, other times ascending currents to uncover sources. We established what could be known, arranged it under the old chapter headings, corrected over six thousand erroneous characters, and added over two thousand explanatory annotations. Every judgment of inclusion or exclusion was meticulously verified, and ambiguities were clarified. Thus, for personal cultivation, one may preempt ailments before they manifest; for governance, one may extend life indefinitely.

With reverence, we consider the emperor’s reign—unifying the great harmony, embracing boundless blessings—continuing the ancestral vision to perfect what was begun, reviving neglected learning to ensure its perpetuity. Then, the harmonious *qi* may be summoned, calamities averted, and all under heaven elevated to the realm of longevity.

**Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon: *Su Wen* Supplementary Commentary, Volume One**
**Tang Grand Steward and Master of the Mystic Play** **Wang Bing’s** Annotations
**Song Guanglu Grandee and Secretariat Attendant** **Lin Yi’s** Editorial Corrections
**Song Guard of the Ministry of War and Field Officer** **Sun Zhao’s** Emendations of Errors
**Newly Corrected Version:**

It is noted that **Wang Bing** did not explain the origin of the title *Su Wen* or the dynasty in which it first appeared. According to the *Sui Book of Libraries*, the title *Su Wen* first appears there. In the preface to the *Jia-Yi Canon*, **Huangfu Mi** of the Jin dynasty already refers to *Su Wen* as a precise discourse on illness. **Wu Chuhui**, a Western Jin scholar, compiled the *Pulse Canon*, stating it derived from *Su Wen* and the *Acupuncture Canon*. **Zhang Zhongjing** of the Han dynasty, in his *Treatise on Sudden and Chronic Febrile Diseases*, stated he composed it using *Su Wen*. Thus, the title *Su Wen* was recorded in the *Sui* and attested in the Han dynasty. Before **Zhang Zhongjing**, no written evidence survives, and its origins remain unknown. Based on extant texts today, the title *Su Wen* emerged in the Han dynasty.

As for the meaning behind the title *Su Wen*, **Quan Yuanqi** offered an explanation: *"Su"* means "origin," and *"Wen"* refers to the dialogue between the **Yellow Emperor** and **Qi Bo**. Since it expounds the fundamental nature of human constitution and the Five Phases, it is called *Su Wen*. Though **Quan Yuanqi** provided this interpretation, its meaning remains unclear.

According to the *Qian Zao Du*, "What has form arises from the formless. Thus, there is **Tai Yi** (Great Simplicity), **Tai Chu** (Great Commencement), **Tai Shi** (Great Beginning), and **Tai Su** (Great Primordial). **Tai Yi** is the state before *qi* manifests. **Tai Chu** is the origin of *qi*. **Tai Shi** is the origin of form. **Tai Su** is the origin of substance. When *qi*, form, and substance are complete, diseases and remedies emerge. Thus, the **Yellow Emperor** inquired into this **Tai Su**—the origin of substance. Perhaps the title *Su Wen* derives from this."

**Chapter on the Primordial Truth of the Upper Antiquity**
In ancient times, the **Yellow Emperor** was born with divine insight, spoke as an infant, and as a child, he was swift and sincere, matured with wisdom, and ultimately ascended to heaven. His father was the ruler of the **Xiong** clan, **Shao Dian**, of the **Gong Sun** lineage. *"Swift"* here means *"urgent."* *"Sincere"* means *"trustworthy."* *"Wise"* means *"enlightened."* He mastered warfare, subduing those who refused tribute, pacifying the world, and exterminating **Chi You**. Ruling with the virtue of **Earth**, he established his capital on the **Xuan Yuan** mound, hence his title **Xuan Yuan Huang Di**. Later, he cast the tripod on **Dinghu Mountain**; upon its completion, the sun ascended in daylight. His ministers buried his robes and crown on **Qiao Mountain**, where his tomb still stands today. *"Swift"* is pronounced *"Xu Rùn."*

He then inquired of the **Celestial Master** (Qi Bo): *"I have heard that in the Upper Antiquity, men lived to a hundred autumns and springtimes without decline in vigor. Now, people in my time reach half a century and already show signs of decay. Is this due to the changing times, or have people lost the way?"*

The **Celestial Master** replied: *"In the Upper Antiquity, those who understood the Dao aligned with yin and yang, harmonizing with techniques and calculations. The Upper Antiquity refers to the **Xuan Ancient** era. To understand the Dao means to know the methods of cultivation. Yin and yang are the eternal principles of heaven and earth; techniques and calculations are the great fundamentals of preserving life. Thus, cultivators must prioritize these above all else. The *Laozi* states: ‘All things carry yin within and embrace yang without, and their harmonious *qi* forms unity.’ The *Great Treatise on Harmonizing the Four Seasons with the Spirit* states: ‘Yin and yang, the four seasons—these are the beginning and end of all things, the source of life and death. To defy them brings calamity; to follow them prevents illness. This is called attaining the Dao.’ This is what is meant.

Let food and drink be moderate, let rising and resting be regular, avoid excessive labor, and..."

To nourish the Dao, one must regulate food and drink as the means to replenish the void, and maintain proper rising and resting as the principles of movement and repose. Thus, cultivators must practice moderation in all actions.

The *Treatise on Stagnation* states: ‘When food and drink are doubled in excess, the intestines and stomach are injured.’ The *Treatise on the Movement of Vital Qi Through the Heavens* states: ‘If rising and resting are as erratic as a startled man, the spirit and *qi* become agitated.’ This is the evil of reckless movement. The *Master Guangcheng* says: ‘Be still and clear, do not labor your body, do not disturb your essence—only then can you attain longevity.’ Hence, the Sage prioritizes these teachings.

**Newly corrected annotation reads:** According to Quán Yuánqǐ’s annotated version: ‘Food and drink have fixed moderation and regularity; rising and resting have fixed measures—neither excessive nor deficient.’ The *Treatise on the Great Purity* agrees. Yáng Shàngshàn says: ‘In moderation, one enjoys sounds, colors, fragrant scents, and flavors; this means not indulging in sight or hearing.’ One acts in accordance with principle, not for extraneous matters. Thus, they preserve both form and spirit, departing from the body and attaining their full natural lifespan. To reach one hundred years with form and spirit intact is to fulfill one’s allotted span of life. Those who excel in cultivation thus serve their true nature, attaining their full natural lifespan.

**Departure** refers to leaving behind the physical frame. The *Spiritual Pivot Classic* states: ‘At one hundred years, the five *zàng* organs are all depleted; the spirit and *qi* have departed, and the physical frame remains alone until death.’ Because of their understanding of the Dao, they extend their years and prolong their life. **Reaching one hundred years** refers to attaining one hundred and twenty years. The *Book of Documents: Hong Fan* says: ‘A full lifespan is one hundred and twenty years.’ But people of our age do not follow this. They act recklessly, approaching death’s domain, straying from the Dao.

Now they take wine as their drink, indulge in falsehood as their norm, and enter the bedchamber inebriated—
**Wine as drink** betrays their drowning in intoxication.
**Falsehood as norm** betrays their scarcity of sincerity.
**Drunken bedchamber entry** betrays their excess in lust.

They exhaust their essence through desire, dissipate their true nature through reckless indulgence.
**Delighting in lust** daily drains their essence—
**Light use** is called dissipation;
**Delighting in lust without restraint** exhausts their essence,
**Reckless indulgence without cease** scatters their true nature.
Thus, the Sage cherishes essence and moderates action,
Filling the marrow, strengthening the bones.
**Laozi** says:
*"Weaken the will, fortify the bones."*
**He Shangong** says:
*"Those who indulge in desire lose their body."*
**The Rites of Zhou** says:
*"Desire must not be indulged."*

**New Annotation:** According to the *Jia-Yi Jing*, "dissipation" should read *"good"* (i.e., "good use").

Not preserving fullness, not timing the governance of spirit—
This speaks of reckless indulgence and unrestrained desire.
**Laozi** says:
*"To grasp and fill it to the brim is not as good as stopping in time."*
This means cherishing essence and preserving spirit,
Like holding a vessel brimming to the edge—
If careless in motion, it will spill and drain one’s true nature.
**The True Revelations** says:
*"Those who cannot always be cautious in their affairs bring upon themselves a hundred ailments—
How can they blame the divine for their misfortune?"*
This is what is meant.

**New Annotation:** According to another text, *"timing"* should read *"dissolving."*

To indulge the heart’s fleeting pleasures,
To act against the harmony of life’s natural joys—
When the heart delights in desire’s gratification,
It reverses the path of nurturing life’s true bliss.

**Laozi** says:
*"Excessive love and greed bring great depletion."*
This is of the same kind.

To love excessively yet fail to preserve,
To speak of the Dao while dismissing its reality—
This is the great sigh of life’s undoing.

Without measure in rest and motion,
One weakens by half a century’s age.
This too stems from dissipation and waste.

The Dao cannot be abandoned, not for an instant—
If one strays from the Dao, life’s full span cannot reach its natural end.

**Laozi** says:
*"When things flourish, they grow old—
This is called not aligning with the Dao.
Not aligning with the Dao brings early decay."*
This is what is meant by straying from the Dao.

The teachings of the ancient sages to those beneath them
All spoke of *xūxié zéifēng*—evil winds that prey on emptiness.
Avoiding them had its proper times:
When *xū* (emptiness) allows evil to enter—this is *xūxié*.
When *xié* (evil) disrupts *zhōnghé* (central harmony)—this is *zéifēng*.
Avoiding them at their appointed times:
The eight seasonal nodes,
And when *Tài-Yī* enters and aligns with the *zhōngguān* (central palace),
On the days when the eight winds are received in court.

*The Ling Shu* says:
*"Evil qi cannot harm unless it finds emptiness in the person."*
Meaning: Only when the person is empty does evil overcome.

---
**Annotation:** According to *Quán Yuánqǐ*’s commentary:
*"The ancient sages’ teachings—all beneath them followed."*
*The Tàisù* and *Qiān Jīn* agree.
*Yáng Shàngshàn* says:
*"The ancient sages led by example,
Their silent teachings surpassing spoken ones—
Thus, the common folk imitated them in great numbers,
Hence, ‘all beneath them followed.’"*
The meaning of *Tài-Yī* entering and aligning with *zhōngguān*,
And receiving the eight winds in court, is fully explained in *Tiān Yuàn Yù Cè*.

With tranquility and emptiness,
True qi follows naturally;
With spirit inwardly guarded,
Where then do diseases arise?

Tranquility, stillness, emptiness—this is *qi*.
Following the Dao’s pure stillness,
With vital essence held within,
Thus, *xūxié zéifēng* cannot take root.

Therefore, with a mind at ease and few desires,
The heart at peace and without fear,
The body laboring yet unwearied—
Because inner mechanisms rest, desires are few;
External distractions stilled, the heart finds ease.
Yet when both emotions and calculations fade,
Judgment becomes unified,
Rest and motion both harmonious—
Thus, no weariness arises.

Qi flows in accordance with nature,
Each follows its own desires,
All find what they seek.
Because the will is unburdened,
All desires align naturally;
The heart easily finds contentment,
All wishes are fulfilled—
Seeking nothing beyond what is natural,
Thus, nothing is difficult to obtain.

**Laozi** says:
*"Knowing sufficiency brings no disgrace,
Knowing when to stop brings no peril—
Thus, one may endure forever."*

Therefore, one delights in their food,
Wears their garments with ease,
Finds joy in their customs—
Delighting in food means accepting both coarse and refined;
Wearing garments with ease means adapting to good and bad;
Finding joy in customs means abandoning envy and emulation.

---
**Annotation:** According to another text, *"delights"* reads *"sweet."*

High and low do not envy one another,
Thus, their people are called *pǔ* (uncorrupted).
Reaching the state of *wúqiú* (no seeking),
This is what is called *"the heart’s sufficiency."*

**Laozi** says:
*"No misfortune greater than not knowing sufficiency,
No fault greater than coveting what one lacks—
Thus, he who knows sufficiency is always sufficient."*
It is not that the things themselves are sufficient,
But that the heart is sufficient—
Not indulging in desire,
Thus, simplicity is preserved.
Hence, the sage says:
*"I have no desires, yet the people naturally become simple."*

---
**Annotation:** According to another text, *"day"* reads *"sun."*

Thus, lust cannot weary the eyes,
Licentiousness cannot confuse the heart—
The eyes do not gaze wantonly,
So lust cannot weary them;
The heart aligns with the *Xuán* (Mysterious),
So licentiousness cannot confuse it.

**Laozi** says:
*"Seeing no desirable things,
The heart remains undisturbed."*
And again:
*"The sage acts for the belly, not for the eyes."*

Foolish and wise, virtuous and base—
None fear external things,
Thus, they align with the Dao.
With both emotions and calculations extinguished,
No scheming mind remains;
With the heart in silent observation,
Victory and defeat are both abandoned—
Thus, the heart and will are preserved in safety,
In perfect harmony with the Dao.

*The Gēngsāng Chú* says:
*"Nurture your form,
Embrace your life,
Do not let your thoughts labor ceaselessly."*

---
**Annotation:** According to *Quán Yuánqǐ*’s commentary:
*"Aligning with the Dao’s principles."*

Thus, those who could all surpass a hundred years
Yet move without decay—
Because their *dé* (virtue/power) remains whole and unthreatened.
Not venturing into danger,
Thus, their *dé* remains whole.

*Zhuāngzi* says:
*"Those who grasp the Dao have complete virtue,
Complete virtue preserves the form—
This is the sage’s way."*
And again:
*"Without action, life and essence cannot be fully preserved."*

The Emperor asked:
*"Why do some grow old without children?
Is it because their strength is exhausted,
Or is it the natural course of heaven?"*
*Cūn* refers to the sturdy trunk—
That which can support life.

*Qí Bó* replied:
*"At seven years of age, the girl’s kidney qi flourishes,
Her teeth change and grow longer.
The *lǎo yáng* (old yang) reaches its peak at nine,
The *shào yáng* (young yang) follows at seven.
Women embody *shào yīn* (young yin) qi,
Thus, it is paired with the *shào yáng* number—
This shows that when yin and yang harmonize,
Only then can they form and perfect the body.
Thus, at seven, kidney qi flourishes,
And teeth change and grow longer.

At fourteen, *tiān guǐ* arrives,
The *rèn* (conception) vessel opens,
The *tài chōng* (supreme surge) vessel thrives,
And menstruation descends in its proper time—
Thus, she can conceive.

*Guǐ* refers to *rén guǐ* (the water stem *rén* and *guǐ*),
Named for the northern direction’s water stem.
The *rèn* and *chōng* vessels are both extraordinary meridians.
When kidney qi is at its fullest,
And the *chōng* and *rèn* flow freely,
The menstrual blood gradually fills,
Descending at its appointed time—
The *tiān zhēn* (heavenly true) qi descends to assist,
Thus, it is called *tiān guǐ*.

Yet the *chōng* is the sea of blood,
The *rèn* governs the fetus—
The two support each other,
Thus, conception is possible.

This is why it is called *yuè shì* (monthly affair):
When *zhōnghé* (central harmony) prevails,
It appears regularly every thirty days.
Thus, missing a period is called *bìng* (disease)."

---
**Annotation:** According to *Quán Yuánqǐ*’s commentary and *Tàisù*, *Jiǎ-Yì Jīng*—
All read *"fú chōng"* (concealed surge).
The same below for *tài chōng*.

The *guǐ* (three-seven) marks the balance of kidney qi,
Thus, the **true teeth** emerge and grow to their utmost.

The **true teeth** refer to the last teeth to develop.
When kidney qi is balanced, the **true teeth** grow—
This shows that teeth are the remnants of bone.

At *sì qī* (four-seven),
Tendons and bones harden, hair reaches its fullest growth,
And the body is at its peak of strength and vigor.

For women, the count of *tiān guǐ* (heavenly true) qi concludes at *qī qī* (seven-seven).
At *sì qī*, half of their vitality remains,
Thus, the body is strong and hair reaches its fullest length here.

At *wǔ qī* (five-seven),
The **Yángmíng** meridian’s qi declines,
The face begins to wither, and hair starts to fall.

The **Yángmíng** meridian’s qi nourishes the face,
Thus, when it declines, hair falls and the face withers.

The *Língshū Jīng* (Spirit Pivot Classic) states:
"The **foot Yángmíng** meridian begins at the nose,
Crosses the forehead,
Descends along the outer nose,
Enters the upper teeth,
Returns to emerge beside the mouth, encircling the lips,
Descends to meet **Chéngjiāng** (receiving saliva),
Then ascends behind the jaw to **Kāng** (cheek),
Exits at **Dàyíng** (great welcome),
Follows **Jiáchē** (cheek cart),
Ascends to the front of the ear,
Passes **Kèzhǔrén** (guest master),
Traces the hairline,
And reaches the forehead and cranium."

The **hand Yángmíng** meridian ascends the neck and pierces the cheek,
Enters the lower teeth’s gaps,
Returns to emerge beside the mouth,
Thus, when its qi declines, the face withers and hair falls.

**Lèi** (类, *lèi yú gé qiè*)
**Xiá** (侠, *xiá yú hú jiá qiè*)
**Pō** (颇, *pō yú luò hú qiè*)

At *liù qī* (six-seven),
The three **Yáng** meridians decline from above,
The face withers entirely, and hair begins to turn white.

The three **Yáng** meridians all ascend to the head,
Thus, when they decline, the face withers and hair turns white.
The reason for their decline is that women’s life force
Has excess **qi** yet deficient blood,
Due to their monthly discharge of blood.

At *qī qī* (seven-seven),
The **Rèn** meridian weakens,
The **Tài chōng** meridian declines and diminishes,
*Tiān guǐ* is exhausted,
The **earthly channel** is blocked—
Thus, the body decays and childbearing ceases.

The cessation of menstrual flow is called **earthly channel blockage**.
When the **chōng** and **rèn** meridians weaken,
It is said the body decays and no children can be conceived.

For men, at eight years,
Kidney qi solidifies, hair grows, and teeth are renewed.
The count of **Lǎoyīn** (old yin) reaches ten,
While **Shàoyīn** (young yin) follows at eight;
Men embody **Shàoyáng** (young yang) qi,
Thus, their count aligns with **Shàoyīn**.

The *Yì Xìjì* (Systematic Words of the *Yì*) says:
*"Heaven nine, earth ten."*
This is their count.

At *èr bā* (two-eight),
Kidney qi flourishes, *tiān guǐ* arrives,
Essence and **qi** overflow and manifest,
Yin and yang harmonize—
Thus, they can conceive.

Men and women differ in yin-yang constitution,
Yet *tiān guǐ* marks their divergence in essence and blood:
Women, in stillness, accumulate fullness and then discharge blood,
Men, in movement, respond and emit semen;
When the two harmonize in flow,
Thus, conception is possible.

The *Yì Xìjì* says:
*"Men and women combine their essence,
And all things transform and generate."*
This is what is meant.

At **three-eight** (twenty-four), kidney qi is balanced, tendons and bones are strong and resilient—thus true teeth emerge and reach their full growth. This is because their use is frequent.

At **four-eight** (thirty-two), tendons and bones are at their peak, muscles full and robust. The **tian gui** of men terminates at **eight-eight** (sixty-four), yet at **four-eight**, they have already reached half their lifespan.

At **five-eight** (forty), kidney qi declines, hair falls out, and teeth wither. The kidney governs bones, and teeth are the remnants of bone. Since kidney qi weakens and lacks nourishment, hair falls and teeth dry up.

At **six-eight** (forty-eight), yang qi declines above, causing the face to wither and hair at the temples to turn white. This yang qi is also the **Yangming** meridian’s flow. The *Língshū Jīng* states:
*"The foot Yangming channel begins at the nose, crosses the philtrum, descends below the lip along the outer nose, enters the upper teeth, then exits beside them. It encircles the lips, descends to meet the chin’s depression, then follows the jaw’s posterior edge, exits at *Dàyíng*, ascends along *Jiáché*, reaches the ear’s front, passes *Kèzhǔrén*, follows the hairline to the forehead and crown. Thus, when yang declines above, the face withers and temple hair turns white."*

At **seven-eight** (forty-nine), liver qi weakens, tendons lose mobility, **tian gui** is exhausted, essence dwindles, and the kidney’s storage declines—all bodily functions reach their extremes. The liver nourishes tendons; its decline causes immobility. The kidney nourishes bones; its decline causes bodily decay. With **tian gui** spent, essence is scarce. Not only does physical vigor decline, but this is the natural course of heaven’s measure.

At **eight-eight** (sixty-four), teeth and hair fall out. Yang qi is exhausted, essence weakens, so teeth and hair lose firmness—like a withered chicken’s frame. *"Go"* means to fall. The kidney governs water, receiving and storing the essence of the five *zàng* and six *fǔ*. Thus, when the five *zàng* flourish, only then can overflow occur. The five *zàng* and six *fǔ*’s excess essence seeps into the kidney, which then stores it. How do we know this? The *Língshū Jīng* says:
*"The five *zàng* govern storing essence; what stores essence must not be harmed."* Thus, each *zàng* has its own essence, which, when used, flows into the kidney—making it the central nexus, not a single *zàng* possessing essence alone. Hence, it is said that only when the five *zàng* flourish can overflow occur. Now, with all five *zàng* declining, tendons and bones slacken, **tian gui** is exhausted. Thus, temple hair turns white, the body grows heavy, gait becomes unsteady, and childbearing ceases. This is what is meant by *"things flourish then age—this is the Way of Heaven."*

The Emperor asked: *"Are there those who, though aged, still bear children? This seems contrary to the measure of **tian gui**."*

Qíbó replied: *"These are those whose natural lifespan exceeds the norm, whose vital pathways remain unobstructed, and whose kidney qi is abundant. Their inherent true *qi* was originally excessive. Though they bear children, men do not surpass **eight-eight**, nor women **seven-seven**, yet the essence of Heaven and Earth is already exhausted. Even if the aged conceive, their offspring’s lifespan cannot exceed the **tian gui** measure."*

The Emperor asked: *"Those who practice the Dao—do they, though aged, still bear children?"*

Qíbó replied: *"Those who practice the Dao can reverse aging and preserve their form. Though their years are long, they can still conceive. These are the true *zhēnrén* (perfected ones). The signs of Dao’s fulfillment appear as in the following chapter."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I have heard that in antiquity, there were *zhēnrén* who upheld Heaven and Earth, grasped yin and yang. The *zhēnrén*—those who have attained the Dao—are elusive, their presence unseen. In their smallness, they enter the boundless; in their vastness, they pervade the void. Their transformations move between Heaven and Earth, unseen within or without. Following the utmost truth, they embody the proof of Dao’s completion. Thus, they can uphold Heaven and Earth, grasp yin and yang. They breathe in refined *qi*, stand alone in guarding the spirit, their flesh unified as one. Their bodies, like ice and snow, graceful as a maiden."*

*(New annotation: The *Quán Yuánqǐ* commentary reads: *"The *zhēnrén*’s flesh and essence are unified."* The *Tàisù* agrees. Yáng Shàngshàn says: *"The *zhēnrén*’s body aligns with the Supreme Ultimate’s essence, hence ‘unified.’"* Thus, they endure beyond Heaven and Earth, with no end. *"Dé"* (exhaust) is pronounced *bì-sì*, meaning ‘to complete.’ This is the Dao’s generation. Only the utmost Dao can achieve such perfection.*

In the mid-ancient era, there were *zhìrén* (accomplished ones) who preserved pure virtue and fulfilled the Dao. *"Full"* refers to perfecting the utmost Dao, hence *zhìrén*. Yet the *zhìrén*, through this pure and unadorned virtue, master the subtle applications of the Dao."*

*(New annotation: As Yáng Shàngshàn elaborates: *"Accumulating essence and preserving spirit, they attain virtue, hence ‘accomplished.’"* They harmonize with yin and yang, align with the four seasons—*"harmonize"* meaning to conform, *"adjust"* meaning to suit—so their movements, whether still or active, align with the seasons’ growth, contraction, and storage, resonating with yin and yang’s ascent and descent. Detached from the world, they accumulate essence and preserve spirit, wandering between Heaven and Earth, perceiving beyond the eight extremes. This is because their spirit is complete. The *Gēngsāng Chú* says: *"The fully spirited do not deliberate yet understand; they do not plan yet act rightly. Their essence illuminates all, their will encompasses the cosmos—like Heaven and Earth. Again: ‘The body aligns with the heart, the heart with *qi*, *qi* with spirit, spirit with the void. Their presence is distinct, their sound resonant—though distant as the eight farthest reaches or near as the eyelashes, those who approach me, I know them all.’"*

The thusly complete in spirit, hence their power is manifest. *Jié* (睫), pronounced *jiē* (接).

These are those who prolong life and strengthen vitality, also returning to the True Person. All converge in the Dao.

Next are the Sage-Persons, dwelling in Heaven and Earth’s harmony, following the principles of the Eight Winds, harmonizing virtue with Heaven and Earth, luminosity with Sun and Moon, sequence with the Four Seasons, and fortune with spirits and ghosts—hence they are called Sage-Persons. Their dwelling in Heaven and Earth’s pure harmony and conforming to the Eight Winds’ true principles is to nourish the true and avoid the false and malevolent. They moderate desires within worldly affairs, harboring no resentment in their hearts. The Sage-Person’s resolve is deep in the Dao, thus their desires are moderated; their heart is whole and love expansive, so they do not suffer true harm. Hence, their virtue never departs, and their body remains unharmed.

Their conduct does not wish to separate from the world—*being clad in ritual adornment* [omitted, as per annotation]. Their actions do not seek display among the vulgar. Though the Sage-Person’s deeds and movements often dwell within the world’s affairs, their conduct differs from the common. How so? They value the Dao’s purity and stillness.

The *Laozi* says: *"I alone differ from others, cherishing the Mother. Mother—this is the Dao."* Externally, they do not weary the body in labor; internally, they suffer no torment of thought. The Sage-Person practices *wuwei*, acting without action, thus internally free from thought, externally unburdened by form. They take tranquility and contentment as their pursuit, self-fulfillment as their merit. Tranquility is stillness; contentment is joy. Following the Dao’s purity and stillness, they move in accordance with nature, hence they attain self-fulfillment. Their form remains unspent, their spirit undispersed—thus they may reach a hundred years. Externally unburdened, internally free from thought, their form remains unspent; their spirit preserved, their essence unbroken—thus their years extend to a hundred. All these are the governance of preserving nature.

The *Gēngsāng Chú* says: *"The Sage-Person, regarding sounds, colors, flavors—if they benefit nature, they take them; if they harm nature, they abandon them. This is the way of preserving nature."*

Next are the Virtuous Persons, modeling Heaven and Earth, resembling Sun and Moon. Inferior to the Sage-Person, yet they strive unceasingly, their insight penetrating a hundred matters, understanding without deliberation, their plans always correct. Their resolve aligns with Heaven and Earth; their heart illuminates the deepest mysteries. Thus they are said to model Heaven and Earth, resemble Sun and Moon. They arrange the stars, follow yin and yang, distinguish the Four Seasons. Stars—all stars. *Chén* (辰)—the North Star. *Biànliè* (辩列)—determining the positions of celestial officials and constellations in the heavens, the gradations of the 365 degrees in distance. Following yin and yang—using the *liùjiǎ* (六甲) and similar methods, counting forward and backward to prognosticate auspicious and inauspicious omens. The *Yīnyáng Shū* says: *"Human *jiǎzǐ* (甲子), beginning with *jiǎzǐ*, proceeding in sequence with *yǐchǒu* (乙丑). Earthly *jiǎzǐ*, beginning with *jiǎxū* (甲戌), proceeding backward with *guǐyǒu* (癸酉). This is called following yin and yang."* Distinguishing the Four Seasons—dividing their *qi* sequences: Spring’s warmth, Summer’s scorching heat, Autumn’s chill, Winter’s piercing cold—these are the Four Seasons’ *qi* sequences. If they follow the ancient ways, aligning with the Dao, they too may prolong life to its limit.

Following the ancient ways and aligning with the Dao—meaning those ancient who knew the Dao. Conforming to yin and yang, harmonizing with the *yǎnshù* (衍数), moderating food and drink, regulating rest and activity, avoiding reckless labor. The ancients who knew the Dao lived a hundred years before departing—thus they may prolong life to its limit.

*Huángdì Nèijīng Sūwèn* Preface
*Táng Tàipù Lìng Qǐ Xuànzǐ Wáng Bīng* annotated, *Sòng Guānglùqīng Zhí Bìgé Lín Yì* et al. collated, *Sòng Shǒushù Shàngshū Liúntián Láng Sūn Zhào* corrected errors.

To unbind the shackled, guide the True, rescue the people to longevity, and aid the weak to attain peace—this cannot be achieved without the Three Sage-Dao.

Kǒng Ānguó’s preface to the *Shàngshū* says: *"The writings of Fúxī, Shénnóng, and Huángdì are called the Three *Fén*—one great Dao."*

Bān Gù’s *Hànshū Yìwénzhì* states: *"The *Huángdì Nèijīng* consists of eighteen volumes. The *Sūwèn* is its nine volumes, together with the nine volumes of the *Língshū*, making eighteen in total."*

*New collation note:* Wáng Shì’s account follows Huángfǔ Shì’ān’s *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* preface, which says: *"In the *Qīlüè* and *Yìwénzhì*, the *Huángdì Nèijīng* consists of eighteen volumes. Now, there are the nine volumes of the *Zhēnjīng* and the nine volumes of the *Sūwèn*, totaling eighteen volumes—this is the *Nèijīng*."* Thus, Wáng Shì follows this tradition.

Moreover, beyond the nine volumes of the *Sūwèn*, the Han physician Zhāng Zhòngjǐng and the Western Jin scholar Wáng Shùhé’s *Màijīng* treat it as nine volumes, while Huángfǔ Shì’ān named it the *Zhēnjīng*, also known as the *Jiǔjuàn*. Yáng Xuàncāo remarked: *"The *Huángdì Nèijīng* consists of two *kuài*, each with nine volumes."*

According to the *Sùshū Jīngjízhì*, it is called the *Jiǔlíng*, while Wáng Bīng named it the *Língshū*. Though ages have passed and dynasties changed, the transmission of its teachings persists—yet fearing it might fall into unworthy hands, the seventh and first volumes were kept in private by the masters. Thus, what is now practiced consists of only eight volumes.

Yet its words are concise, its meaning profound, its principles subtle, and its insights penetrating. It delineates the patterns of Heaven and Earth, arranges the signs of yin and yang, reveals the origins of transformation, and displays the omens of life and death. Without deliberate planning, distant and near alike find accord; without rigid constraints, the hidden and the manifest align. Its statements bear verification, and its applications hold true. Truly, it may be called the essence of the supreme Dao, the foundation of nurturing life.

If one’s insight is swift and keen, and one’s understanding profound and intuitive, even innate brilliance requires guidance from exegesis—there is no path that does not follow the direct route, no exit that does not pass through the gate. Yet through meticulous study and deep exploration, one may grasp the true essence, though the path may be perilous. Thus, action yields results, like the subtle influence of ghosts and spirits, and in every age, extraordinary figures emerge.

Hence, the Zhou had Qín Gōng, the Han had Chúnyú Gōng, the Wei had Zhāng Gōng and Huá Gōng—all masters of this wondrous Dao. Each renewed its application, greatly benefiting the people, their reputation and deeds in harmony. This is the efficacy of teaching, also Heaven’s decree.

In my youth, I revered the Dao and took delight in nurturing life. Fortunate to encounter the true scripture, I made it my guiding mirror. Yet the world’s texts were flawed, with overlapping chapters, disordered sequences, and disjointed meanings—difficult to apply and even harder to reconcile. Over time, errors accumulated: sometimes a single passage appeared twice under different titles, or two theories were merged into one heading; sometimes a question remained unanswered, yet a new chapter was introduced; or passages were omitted without explanation, leaving gaps in the world’s transmission.

The *Zhonghé Jing* was elevated to govern acupuncture and moxibustion, while *Bìngfāng Yì* was conflated into a chapter on coughs. The distinctions between *xū* (emptiness) and *shí* (fullness) were obscured under *nìcóng* (inverse/obverse) theories, and the *jīngluò* (channels) were merged into *Lùnyào* (Essential Discussions). The *píbù* (skin sections) were truncated to form channels, and the *Zhìdào* (Arrival at the Dao) was demoted to precede acupuncture—such errors abound, beyond counting.

How then could one ascend Mount Tài without a path? How seek the Peach Blossom Spring without a boat? Yet through diligent inquiry, I found those who held the truth. After twelve years of study, I penetrated to the core principles, clarifying gains and losses to fulfill my lifelong quest.

At Master Guó Zǐzhāi’s hall, I received the secret manuscript of my forebear, Master Zhānggōng—its text clear, its meaning profound. Examining it thoroughly resolved all doubts.

Fearful that this knowledge would scatter among unworthy scholars, severing the master-disciple lineage, I composed annotations to ensure its immortality. Together with the old manuscripts, eighty-one chapters in twenty-four volumes were compiled into this work.

The new annotation notes: *"The seventh chapter of the* Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon *(*Sūwén*) has long been lost."*

Royal Historian Huángfù Shì’ān, a Jin scholar, in his preface to the *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jing*, also noted losses. The *Sui Shū Jīngjí Zhì* records that Liang’s *Qī Lù* (Seven Records) states only eight chapters remain. Guān Yuánqǐ, a Sui scholar, in his annotated edition, omits the seventh chapter entirely.

Wang Bīng, of the Tang’s *Bǎoyìng* era, notes that from the Jin dynasty onward—over six hundred years since Huángfú Mì’s *Gānlù* era—yet he claims to have recovered the original manuscripts. I now suspect this claim.

I also examined the seven chapters—*"The Grand Treatise on Celestial Elements"* (*Tiānyuánjì Dàlùn*), *"The Treatise on the Five Phases’ Movement"* (*Wǔyùn Xínglùn*), *"The Essentials of the Six Minutiae"* (*Liùwēi Zhìlùn*), *"The Treatise on Qi’s Mutual Exchange"* (*Qì Jiāohuànlùn*), *"The Treatise on the Five Constant Principles"* (*Wǔcháng Zhènglùn*), *"The Grand Treatise on the Six Elements’ Rectification"* (*Liùyuán Zhèngjìlùn*), and *"The Essence of Ultimate Truth"* (*Zhìzhēn Yàolùn*)—which now occupy the fourth volume of the *Sūwén* in the present collection. These chapters are vast in scope, differing in volume and content from the preceding and following chapters of the *Sūwén*. Moreover, their recorded teachings are largely disconnected from the rest of the *Sūwén*’s chapters.

I suspect these seven chapters are actually the text of *"The Grand Treatise on Yin-Yang"* (*Yīnyáng Dàlùn*), which Wang Bīng incorporated to fill the gaps in the lost volumes—akin to how the *Winter Official* was omitted from the *Zhōu Gōng* (Rites of Zhou), yet the *Records of the Craftsman* (*Kǎogōng Jì*) were added to supplement it.

Furthermore, according to the preface of *Zhang Zhòngjǐng’s* *Treatise on Cold Damage* (*Shānghán Lùn*) from the Han, the compilation drew from the *Sūwén*, *Jiǔ Lùn* (Nine Chapters), *Bāshíyī Nànjīng* (Eighty-One Difficulties Canon), and *Yīnyáng Dàlùn*. This clearly indicates that the *Sūwén* and *Yīnyáng Dàlùn* were originally two distinct works, yet Wang Bīng merged them into one.

In essence, *"The Grand Treatise on Yin-Yang"* (*Yīnyáng Dàlùn*) is also an ancient medical classic, and it is certainly not the seventh chapter of the *Sūwén*. My hope is merely to clarify the end and elucidate the beginning, to trace the annotations and harmonize the scriptures, to open the way for beginners and propagate profound truths.

For passages where words are omitted or meanings are disjointed, I searched through all available classics and treatises, rearranging and supplementing them accordingly.

For chapters with lost titles or unclear references, I categorized their themes and added distinct subtitles to clarify their intent.

In cases where the roles of sovereign and minister are unclear or ceremonial propriety is misplaced, I reviewed the hierarchy of ranks and added explanatory text to illuminate their meaning.

For fragmented or repetitive passages, I analyzed their purpose, removed redundant details, and preserved only the essentials.

For obscure or cryptic teachings that could not be easily explained, I composed *"The Mysterious Pearl"* (*Xuánzhū*), to elucidate its principles.

The new annotations state: *"Wang Bīng’s* Mysterious Pearl *has no extant transmission; today, there are* Mysterious Pearl *in ten volumes and* Revealing the Hidden Intentions *in three volumes (*Zhāomíng Yǐnzhǐ*), which are likely later additions by others."*

Though not Wang Bīng’s original work, these texts still offer valuable insights within the *Sūwén*’s nineteenth to twenty-second volumes. The *Revealing the Hidden Intentions* in three volumes corresponds precisely to what is now called *"The Celestial Elements’ Jade Register"* (*Tiānyuán Yùcè*), yet its meaning often diverges from Wang Bīng’s interpretations.

All supplementary words are marked in red to distinguish them from the original text, ensuring no confusion between ancient and modern additions.

May this clarify the sacred intent, expound the profound Dao/Way, so that the celestial constellations remain orderly and the deep waters emit pure resonance—where scales and shells are distinctly separated, and sovereigns and ministers alike avoid untimely misfortune, while all peoples, near and far, hold hope for longevity.

Thus, practitioners will not err, scholars will gain clarity, and the refined Dao/Way will endure, its subtle sounds transmitted without interruption. Even a thousand years hence, they will recognize the boundless benevolence of the Great Sage.

The **Yellow Emperor’s Inner Classic: Plain Questions**—**Supplementary Commentary on the Second Volume of *Nourishing Life***—
**Tang Taipu Ling (王冰) as Junior Commentator, Sung Guanglu Jing (林亿) and Others as Proofreaders, and Sung Shou Shangshu (孙兆) as Corrector of Errors—

**Great Treatise on the Four Seasons Adjusting the Spirit**

In the **Spring Three Months**, this is called *Unfurling the Old* (發陳).
The **Spring Yang ascends**, and the **Qi subtly emerges**, able to **generate and nurture all things**, revealing their forms and beauty—thus it is called *Unfurling the Old*.

When referring to the **Spring Three Months**, all names are derived from the **nodes and seasons**.
The same applies to **Summer, Autumn, and Winter**.

**Heaven and Earth together give birth**, and **all things flourish** (以榮).
**Heaven’s Qi is warm**, and **Earth’s Qi emerges**—warmth and emergence harmonize, thus all things thrive and bloom (滋榮).

**Awaken before dawn**, and **roam widely in the courtyard**—
**Warmth generates**, and **cold disperses**.
Thus, one **awakens early** and **roams widely in the courtyard**.
**Loosen the hair and relax the body**, so that **intentions may arise**—this is the **model of correspondence** (法象).
**Spring Qi first emerges among all things**, so **loosening the hair and relaxing the body** allows **intentions to arise** (志意發生).

**Give life without killing**, **bestow without taking away**, **reward without punishing**—
**Spring Qi emerges**, and **actions are given without expectation of return**—thus, those who **nourish life** must **conform to the season** (順於時).
*予* (yǔ) is pronounced as *yú* (with).
This is the **response of Spring Qi**, the **Dao/Way of nourishing life**—what is called **following the sequence of the seasons**.

Yet, at the **Establishing Spring node**, the **first five days** mark *winds unbind and frost thaws* (束風解凍), the **next five days** mark *earthworms begin to stir* (垫蟲始振), and the **last five days** mark *fish ascend the ice* (魚上冰).
Following the **Rain Water Qi**, the **first five days** mark *otters sacrifice fish* (獭祭魚), the **next five days** mark *wild geese arrive* (鴻雁來), and the **last five days** mark *grasses and trees begin to sprout* (草木萌動).
Following the **Middle Spring node of *Awakening Insects*** (驚垫), the **first five days** mark *plum blossoms open* (小桃華), the **next five days** mark *the oriole sings* (倉庚呜), and the **last five days** mark *hawks transform into doves* (鷹化為鴠).
Following the **Spring Equinox Qi**, the **first five days** mark *the dark raven arrives* (玄烏至), the **next five days** mark *thunder begins to sound and peonies bloom* (雷乃發聲、芍藥榮), and the **last five days** mark *lightning first appears* (始電).
Following the **Late Spring node of *Clear and Bright*** (清明), the **first five days** mark *the paulownia begins to blossom* (桐始華), the **next five days** mark *field mice transform into hares* (田鼠化為驾) and *peony blossoms* (牡丹華), and the **last five days** mark *the rainbow first appears* (虹始見).
Following the **Grain Rain Qi**, the **first five days** mark *duckweed begins to grow* (萍始生), the **next five days** mark *the quail fans its wings* (呜鴠拂其羽), and the **last five days** mark *the hoopoe alights on the mulberry* (戴勝降於桑).

**These eighteen candidates of the six Qi** are all **Spring’s decrees for unfurling and emergence**—thus, those who **nourish life** must **conform with reverence to Heaven’s timing**.

*Peonies bloom* (芍藥榮) and *peonies blossom* (牡丹華) are absent in the current *Monthly Ordinances*.
**Otters** (獭) are pronounced *duōdá* (多達).
**Hares** (驾) are pronounced *yú* (如).
**Quails** (鴠) are pronounced *jūn* (鴛).

**To oppose this** (逆) is to **harm the Liver**—in **Summer**, it becomes *cold-induced illness*, and those who **conform to longevity** will have **less vitality**.
*逆* (oppose) means **acting against the Autumn decrees**.
The **Liver corresponds to Wood**, which **reigns in Spring**—thus, following **Autumn’s decrees** harms **Liver Qi**.
**Summer’s Fire reigns**, and **Wood is diminished**—thus, illness arises in **Summer**.
Yet, the **Qi of the four seasons** follows **Spring’s generation and Summer’s growth**—opposing **Spring** harms the **Liver**, so one **lacks Qi** to **conform to Summer’s growth**.

In the **Summer Three Months**, this is called *Abundant Bloom* (蕃秀).
The **Yang**, having **generated in Spring**, now **flourishes in Summer**, and **things grow to their fullness**—thus it is called *Abundant Bloom*.
*蕃* (fán) means **luxuriant** and **prolific**.
*秀* (xiù) means **blossom** and **beauty**.

**Heaven and Earth’s Qi intermingle**, and **all things bear fruit and bloom**—
This is the **Summer Solstice**.
The *Treatise on Essential Pigs* (豚要精微論) states:
*"At the Summer Solstice, forty-five days later, Yin Qi subtly ascends, and Yang Qi subtly descends.*
Thus, **Heaven and Earth’s Qi intermingle**.
Yet, **Yang Qi applies its transformations**, and **Yin Qi solidifies its forms**—transformation and solidification harmonize, so **all things bear fruit and bloom**.
The *Great Treatise on Yin-Yang Correspondences* states:
*"Yang transforms Qi, and Yin solidifies form."*

**Retire late and rise early**, never **weary of the sun**—
**Let intentions not grow resentful**, **let flowers and fruits mature into bloom**, and **let Qi find release**—
If one’s **affection lies outward**,

**Soothing the Yang Qi allows things to transform**, **calming intentions lets Qi disperse**, **transformation lets flowers and fruits bloom**, and **Qi’s dispersion lets the skin’s pores open freely**.
The **season’s decree** is to **unfurl Yang**—thus, **affection also aligns with Yang and lies outward**.

This is the **response of Summer Qi**, the **Dao/Way of nourishing growth**.

At the **Establishing Summer node**, the **first five days** mark *the cricket chirps* (蝼蝈呜), the **next five days** mark *the earthworm emerges* (蚯蚓出), and the **last five days** mark *the red bean sprouts* (赤箭生).
*New proofreading* states: *The Monthly Ordinances* record *wax gourd sprouts* (王瓜生).

Following the **Lesser Full Qi**, the **first five days** mark *the Chinese chive blooms* (吳葵華), the **next five days** mark *the tender grass withers* (靡草死), and the **last five days** mark *the Lesser Heat arrives* (小暑至).
*New proofreading* states: *The Monthly Ordinances* record *bitter herb blooms* (苦菜秀).

Following the **Middle Summer node of *Grain in Ear*** (芒種), the **first five days** mark *the mantis appears* (蟾螂生), the **next five days** mark *the wild geese begin to call* (鴻始呜), and the **last five days** mark *the cuckoo falls silent* (反舌無聲).

Following the **Summer Solstice Qi**, the **first five days** mark *the deer’s antlers shed* (鹿角解), the **next five days** mark *the cicada begins to chirp* (蜩始呜), and the **last five days** mark *the half-summer herb grows* (半夏生) and *the wood’s bark flourishes* (木革榮).

Following the **Late Summer node of *Lesser Heat*** (小暑), the **first five days** mark *the warm winds arrive* (溫風至), the **next five days** mark *the katydid clings to the walls* (蟋蟀居壁), and the **last five days** mark *the eagle begins to learn* (鷹乃學習).

Following the **Greater Heat Qi**, the **first five days** mark *the rotting grass transforms into fireflies* (腐草化為螢), the **next five days** mark *the soil moistens and receives heat* (土潤得暑), and the **last five days** mark *the great rains descend in season* (大雨時行).

**These eighteen candidates of the six Qi** are all **Summer’s decrees for ascension and abundant bloom**—thus, those who **nourish life** must **revere and conform to Heaven’s timing**.

*New proofreading* states: *The wood’s bark flourishes* (木革榮) is absent in the current *Monthly Ordinances*.
**The cuckoo** (鴃) is pronounced *yàn* (古閱切) and is the **oriole** (搏勞烏).

**To oppose this** (逆) is to **harm the Heart**—in **Autumn**, it becomes *dyspeptic malaria* (疚疟), and those who **conform to the harvest** will **suffer decline**—in **Winter**, they face **grave illness**.
*逆* (oppose) means **acting against the Winter decrees**.
*疢疢* (jiǔjiǔ) is **malaria with emaciation**.
The **Heart corresponds to Fire**, which **reigns in Summer**—thus, following **Winter’s decrees** harms **Heart Qi**.
**Autumn’s Metal reigns**, and **Fire is diminished**—thus, illness manifests in **Autumn** as *dyspeptic malaria*.

「Thus, the **Four Seasons’ Qi**—**Autumn’s Harvest** and **Winter’s Storage**—**oppose Summer** and **harm the Heart**, so one must **conserve Qi** to **conform to Autumn’s Harvest**.

**Winter Water subdues Fire**, hence **grave illness** arises at the **Winter Solstice**.

**To treat** (疗), pronounced *jiē* (古皆切). In **Autumn’s third month**, this is called **Containment and Balance** (容平). All things grow in **Summer**, their fruits and flowers now complete; their **form and essence** reach **Autumn**, where they **settle and stabilize**. The **Heavenly Qi grows urgent**, while the **Earthly Qi grows clear**—the **Heavenly Qi’s urgency** sharpens the **wind’s voice**; the **Earthly Qi’s clarity** alters the **colors of things**. **Early rising** (早起) and **early activity** (早外) begin together with the **oriole** (鹦). **Fearful of the cold**, one must **prepare for the frost and dew** (寒露) and **stay indoors** (枚早外) to **ensure tranquility** (安宁). **Calm one’s mind**, to **mitigate Autumn’s severity**—if one’s **mind is restless**, they **do not guard their movements**; if they **do not guard their movements**, they **exacerbate Autumn’s harshness**, **acting against** (逆) **destructive and life-sustaining forces** (杀伐生), hence **calming the mind** to **soothe Autumn’s severity**.

**Gather and conserve spiritual Qi**, to **balance Autumn’s Qi**. If **spiritual Qi disperses**, **desires flare**; if **desires flare**, they **harm the harmonious Qi**. Once the **harmonious Qi is injured**, **Autumn’s Qi fails to adjust properly**, so **gather and conserve spiritual Qi** to **balance Autumn’s Qi**.

**Do not let the mind wander outward**, to **cleanse the Lung Qi**. This also **conforms to Autumn’s gathering and conserving**.

This is how **Autumn’s Qi responds**; the **Dao of Nourishing the Harvest** is thus.

At the **Establishing Autumn** (立秋) node:
- On the **first five days**, **Freezing Wind arrives** (冻风至);
- On the **next five days**, **White Dew descends** (白露降);
- On the **following five days**, **the cicada** (寒蝉) **falls silent** (吗).

Then comes the **Concluding Summer Heat** (处暑) node:
- On the **first five days**, **the hawk begins to sacrifice birds** (鹰乃祭鸟);
- On the **next five days**, **Heaven and Earth begin to grow solemn** (天地始肃);
- On the **following five days**, **grain is ready for harvest** (禾乃登).

Next is the **Mid-Autumn White Dew** (白露) node:
- On the **first five days**, **the Chilling Wind arrives** (肓风至), **and wild geese come** (鸿雁来);
- On the **next five days**, **the raven returns** (玄乌归);
- On the **following five days**, **birds gather in shame** (群鸟养羞).

Then comes the **Autumn Equinox** (秋分) node:
- On the **first five days**, **thunder ceases its voice** (雷乃收声);
- On the **next five days**, **the hibernating insects bury their bodies** (垫虫埋尸);
- On the **following five days**, **the plants wither** (景天华);
- On the **last five days**, **the waters begin to dry** (水始涸).

Following is the **Late Autumn Frost’s Descent** (寒露) node:
- On the **first five days**, **wild geese come as guests** (鸿雁来宾);
- On the **next five days**, **sparrows enter the great waters and become clams** (雀入大水为蛤);
- On the **following five days**, **chrysanthemums bloom yellow** (菊有黄华).

Then comes the **Frost’s Descent** (霜降) node:
- On the **first five days**, **the wolf begins to sacrifice its prey** (豺乃祭驮);
- On the **next five days**, **grasses and trees turn yellow and fall** (草木黄落);
- On the **following five days**, **the stinging insects all bow downward** (螫虫咸俯).

These **Six Qi and Eighteen Phenomena** are all **Autumn’s decrees** for **proper gathering and conserving**, so those who **nourish life** must **revere and conform to Heaven’s timing**.

*New proofreading* states: **The withering of plants** (景天华) is absent in the current *Monthly Ordinances*. **Bury** (埋), pronounced *mái* (步回切).

**To oppose this** (逆) is to **harm the Lungs**—in **Winter**, it becomes *undigested diarrhea* (飧泄), and those who **conform to the storage** will **suffer decline**—in **Spring**, they face **grave illness**.

**Oppose** (逆) means **acting against the Summer decrees**. The **Lungs correspond to Metal**, which **reigns in Autumn**; thus, following **Summer’s decrees** harms **Lung Qi**. **Winter Water reigns**, and **Metal is diminished**, so illness manifests in **Spring** as *undigested diarrhea*. **Undigested diarrhea** (飧泄) is when **food is not digested** and **leaks out**; opposing **Autumn** harms the **Lungs**, so one must **conserve Qi** to **conform to Winter’s storage**.

In **Winter’s third month**, this is called **Sealed Storage** (闭藏). **Grasses and trees wither**, **hibernating insects depart**, and **Earth’s pores close shut**, as **Yang Qi retreats and is stored**. **Water freezes and Earth cracks** (冰地坼), **do not disturb the Yang**—**Yang Qi sinks downward**, and when **water freezes and Earth cracks**, one must **act cautiously**, avoiding **excessive exertion or labor**. **Disturb** (扰) means **to trouble** or **to overwork**. **Retire early and rise late**, waiting for **daylight**—**avoiding the cold**. **Calm one’s mind as if concealed and hidden** (若伏若匿), now **clarified as "hidden"** (匿). If **private intentions arise** (若有私意) or **one feels a sense of gain** (若已有得), both mean **not to recklessly expose oneself** to **chilling Qi**.

Thus, the following text states: **Avoid the cold and seek warmth**, **do not expose the skin**—**let Qi be swiftly taken** (亟夺). **Avoiding the cold and seeking warmth** means **dwelling in deep chambers**. The *Ling Shu Canon* (灵枢经) says: **"Winter Qi penetrates the bones** (冬日在骨), **hibernating insects act cautiously** (垫虫周密), **the virtuous one stays indoors** (君子居室)." **Do not expose the skin** means **do not sweat**—**sweating releases Yang Qi**; if **Yang Qi is released**, it will **frequently be seized by cold Qi**. **Swiftly taken** (亟夺) means **often seized**.

This is how **Winter’s Qi responds**; the **Dao of Nourishing Storage** is thus.

At the **Establishing Winter** (立冬) node:
- On the **first five days**, **water begins to freeze** (水始冰);
- On the **next five days**, **Earth begins to harden** (地始冻);
- On the **following five days**, **the partridge enters the great waters and becomes a mythical dragon** (雉入大水为蜃).

Then comes the **Lesser Snow** (小雪) node:
- On the **first five days**, **the rainbow hides and is not seen** (虹藏不见);
- On the **next five days**, **Heavenly Qi ascends** (天气上腾), **and Earthly Qi descends** (地气下降);
- On the **following five days**, **closure forms and Winter begins** (闭塞而成冬).

Next is the **Mid-Winter Greater Snow** (大雪) node:
- On the **first five days**, **ice grows stronger** (冰益壮), **and Earth begins to crack** (地始坼); **the magpie does not cry** (赐乌不呜);
- On the **next five days**, **the tiger begins to mate** (虎始交);
- On the **following five days**, **the rape plant begins to sprout** (芸始生), **and the lily stands tall** (挺出).

Then comes the **Winter Solstice** (冬至) node:
- On the **first five days**, **the earthworm coils up** (蚯蚓结);
- On the **next five days**, **the deer’s antlers fall** (麋角解);
- On the **following five days**, **the waters and springs move** (水泉动).

Following is the **Late Winter Lesser Cold** (小寒) node:
- On the **first five days**, **the geese fly northward** (雁北乡);
- On the **next five days**, **the alarming crow flies swiftly** (惊乌厉疾);
- On the **following five days**, **the waters and marshes freeze solid** (水泽腹坚).

These **Six Qi and Eighteen Phenomena** are all **Winter’s decrees** for **proper nourishing and storage**, so those who **nourish life** must **revere and conform to Heaven’s timing**.

**Lily** (荔), pronounced *lì*. **Stand tall** (挺), pronounced *tǐng* (大顶切). **Northward** (乡), pronounced *xiàng* (音向).

**To oppose this** (逆) is to **harm the Kidneys**—in **Spring**, it becomes *withered paralysis* (痿厥), and those who **conform to the generation** will **suffer decline**.

**Oppose** (逆) means **acting against the Summer decrees**. The **Kidneys correspond to Water**, which **reigns in Winter**; thus, following **Summer’s decrees** harms **Kidney Qi**. **Spring Wood reigns**, and **Water is diminished**, so illness manifests in **Spring** as *withered paralysis*. Opposing **Winter** harms the **Kidneys**, so one must **conserve Qi** to **conform to Spring’s generation**.

**Heavenly Qi** is **clear, tranquil, and luminous**—**Heaven’s light is unending**, and because it is **tranquil and clear**, those who **govern themselves** will have **longevity extended**; this is also by **following natural movements** and thus **Heavenly Qi** is **demonstrated to humanity**.

**Store virtue without ceasing**—*New proofreading* states: **According to another text, "without ceasing" (不止) should be "ascending" (上)**.

「Thus, **Heavenly Qi** does not descend. The **Four Seasons** follow their natural order, the **Seven Luminaries** cycle without end, and **Heaven** does not manifest itself through words—this is the **concealment of virtue**. When **virtue** is concealed, its **manifestation** does not falter, hence **Heavenly Qi** does not descend. The *Laozi* says: **"The virtue of the highest Dao is not virtue"**—thus, it has **virtue**. This means that **Heaven’s** most exalted state remains hidden, and even its **virtue** is concealed; how much more so the **Complete Way of Life** that does not conform to **Heaven’s** nature?

When **Heavenly Qi** is revealed, the **light of the Sun and Moon** becomes obscured, and **harmful energies** invade the **empty orifices**. **Heaven** conceals its **virtue** because it wishes to hide its **Great Clarity**—when **Great Clarity** is seen, **lesser light** is extinguished. Thus, the **virtue of Great Clarity** must not be revealed, for if **Heaven** were to manifest itself openly, the **light of the Sun and Moon** would be obscured. What is meant by this?

It means that **human True Qi** must also not be wasted. One must **clearly and tranquilly** follow the **Dao**, preserving **Heaven’s True Nature**. If one **departs from the Dao**, then **empty orifices** will be invaded by **deceptive and harmful energies**. *Kong* (空) is pronounced as *Kong* (孔). **Heavenly Yang Qi** is **closed and sealed**, while **Earthly Yin Qi** is **bright and manifest**—**Heavenly Yang Qi** refers to **Heaven’s Qi**, also **Wind and Heat**; **Earthly Yin Qi** refers to **Moisture**, also called **Mist**.

When **Wind and Heat** harm a person, the **Nine Orifices** become **closed and sealed**; when **Mist and Moisture** cause illness, they **obscure and dim** the **luminous clarity**. Drawing parallels: in **Heaven**, the **Sun and Moon** lose their brightness; in humans, the **two eyes conceal their luster**. The *Ling Shu Jing* says: **"Heaven has the Sun and Moon; humans have eyes."** The *Yijing* says: **"Lose one’s clarity in the *Yijing*."** Is this not a failure to nurture the **Way of Life**?

When **Clouds and Mist** do not refine their **pure energies**, they correspond above to **White Dew** not descending. Mist refers to **Clouds**, and Dew refers to **Rain**. When **Yang Qi** is excessive, **Earth** cannot respond above; when **Yin Qi** is deficient, **Heaven** does not descend to interact. Thus, **Clouds and Mist** failing to refine **pure energies**, they correspond above to **Heaven**, resulting in **White Dew** not descending.

The *Yin-Yang Ying Xiang Da Lun* says: **"Earthly Qi ascends as Clouds; Heavenly Qi descends as Rain. Rain emerges from Earthly Qi, and Clouds from Heavenly Qi. When the two Qi interact and merge, they form the Four Dews and Rains."** The *Fang Sheng Kui Lun* says: **"When Yin is utterly deficient, Heavenly Qi is severed; when Yang is utterly excessive, Earthly Qi is insufficient. When Qi does not mutually call and respond, they cannot merge and interact."** If **interaction is not expressed**, then **all things lose their vitality**, and without vitality, **named trees** wither and die.

When **Clouds and Mist** do not refine their **pure energies**, and **Rain and Dew** do not nourish the **fields and marshes**, this is **Heavenly Qi** not descending and **Earthly Qi** not ascending. The **principle of transformation** is impaired, and the **source of life** is extinguished. Thus, **all things** lose their vitality, and their deaths begin with **named trees**—hence, it is said that **named trees** wither and die. *Named* refers to **precious fruits and fine trees**. *Express* means to **manifest openly**.

The *Yijing Xi Ci* says: **"Heaven and Earth bound and confined, and all things transform into purity."** Yet if **interaction is not expressed**, it becomes **Pi** (否). The *Yijing* says: **"When Heaven and Earth do not interact, it is Pi."** *Pi* (否) is pronounced as *Fu Bi* (部鄙). When **harmful energies** do not disperse, and **Wind and Rain** are not regulated, **White Dew** does not descend, then **withered and dried things** do not flourish.

*Harmful energies* refers to **deceptive and harmful energies**; *dispense* means to **dissipate**; *regulate* means to **control and measure**; *withered* refers to **accumulated decay**; *dried* refers to **withered and desiccated**. This means that when **harmful energies** are suppressed and do not dissipate, **Wind and Rain** lack regulation, causing **injury and damage** to multiply, and **withered things** accumulate, leaving **Spring** without vitality.

Is this not merely the fate of things alone? Humans who **depart from the Dao** also suffer similarly. **Robber Winds** strike frequently, **violent Rains** arise often; when **Heaven and Earth** fail to **harmonize the Four Seasons** and **lose alignment with the Dao**, then **True Nature** is **severed and extinguished**. If one does not **conform to the harmony of the Four Seasons** and repeatedly **encounters the harm of the Eight Winds**, then **True Nature** will be **destroyed before its time**, whether near or far.

Only **Sages** follow it, so their bodies have **no strange illnesses**, all things remain unharmed, and **Life-Giving Qi** is **unending**. The **Dao** is not **distant from humanity**; rather, **human hearts are distant from the Dao**. Only **Sages** align their hearts with the **Dao**, so their **lifespans are endless**.

*Follow* means *conform* (犹顺), referring to **conforming to the Four Seasons’ decrees**. Yet the **Four Seasons’ decrees** cannot be **opposed**—if opposed, the **Five Viscera** will be **internally injured**, and other illnesses will arise.

To **oppose Spring Qi** is to **fail to generate Minor Yang**, causing **Liver Qi** to **internally transform**. *Generate* means **to emerge and move**. When **Yang Qi** does not emerge, it **accumulates within the Liver**, causing **Liver Qi** to **become muddled and chaotic**, thus **transforming and injuring**.

To **oppose Summer Qi** is to **fail to extend Major Yang**, causing **Heart Qi** to **internally hollow**. *Extend* means **to flourish outwardly**. *Hollow* means **to become empty within**. When **Yang Qi** does not flourish outwardly, it **weakens the Heart internally**, and **excessive Heat** consumes within, leaving the **Heart empty**.

*Yù* (燠) is pronounced as *Yù* (欲). To **oppose Autumn Qi** is to **fail to gather Minor Yin**, causing **Lung Qi** to **become stagnant and full**. *Gather* means **to contract and consolidate**. *Stagnant* refers to **the Upper Burner**—when **Minor Yin** moves, its **Qi** governs the **transformation of the Upper Burner**, so if **Lung Qi** does not **gather**, the **Upper Burner** becomes **full**.

*New proofreading* states: According to another text, *stagnant and full* (焦满) should be *advancing and full* (进满); the *Jia Yi* (甲乙) and *Tai Su* (太素) versions retain *stagnant and full* (焦满).

To **oppose Winter Qi** is to **fail to conceal Minor Yin**, causing **Kidney Qi** to **sink alone**. *Sink* means **to submerge and lie dormant**. **Minor Yin Qi** internally communicates with the **Kidneys**, so when **Minor Yin** does not **lie dormant**, **Kidney Qi** **sinks alone**.

*New proofreading* states: Upon closer examination, *sink alone* (独沉) in the *Tai Su* (太素) version should be *alone sinks* (沉独).

The **Four Seasons’ Yin and Yang** are the **root foundation of all things**—when **Seasons** and **cycles** run their course, **Yin and Yang** transform, **Heaven and Earth** merge their **Qi**, and **generate all things**. Thus, the **root of all things** is entirely **attributed to this**. Therefore, **Sages** **nurture Yang in Spring and Summer**, and **nurture Yin in Autumn and Winter**, to **conform to their roots**.

**Yang Qi** is rooted in **Yin**, and **Yin Qi** is rooted in **Yang**; without **Yin**, **Yang** has no means to **generate**, and without **Yang**, **Yin** has no means to **transform**. When **Yin** is entirely **concealed**, **Yang Qi** does not reach its **peak**; when **Yang** is entirely **manifest**, **Yin Qi** does not **find its limit**.」

「In **Spring**, one consumes **frozen foods** (冻), and in **Summer**, **cold foods** (寒), to **nurture Yang** (养於阳);
In **Autumn**, one consumes **warm foods** (温), and in **Winter**, **hot foods** (热), to **nurture Yin** (养於阴).

**Nourishing the nascent** (滋苗者) strengthens the **roots** (固其根) through **stability** (爻);
**Pruning the excess** (伐下者) **trims the upper growth** (铃桔其上).

Thus, by **adjusting in this manner** (以斯调节) and **following their roots** (从顺其根),
**Yin and Yang Qi** (二气) remain **constantly preserved** (常存),
for **the roots are firmly established** (盖由根固).
From **dawn to dusk** (百刻晓暮), food should be **harmonized accordingly** (食亦宜然).

Hence, one **aligns with all things** in their **sinking and rising** (沉浮) at the **gates of life and growth** (生长之门).
**Sages** thus **remain free of strange ailments** (身无奇病) and **vital energy never exhausted** (生气不竭),
for they **follow their roots** (以顺其根).

To **contradict their roots** (逆其根) is to **sever their foundation** (伐其本) and **corrupt their true essence** (坏其真).
This is then to **lose the Dao of the Four Seasons’ Yin and Yang** (失四时阴阳之道).

Therefore, the **Four Seasons’ Yin and Yang** (阴阳四时) are the **termination and commencement of all things** (万物之终始),
the **source of death and life** (死生之本).
To **contradict them** (逆之) invites **calamity** (灾害生),
while to **follow them** (从之) ensures **no grave illness arises** (苛疾不起)—
this is called **obtaining the Dao** (得道).
This is called **obtaining the Dao of Nourishment and Life** (得养生之道).

**苛** (苛): *grave, severe* (重).
**Dao** (道): **Sages** **embody it** (圣人行之), while the **foolish cling to it externally** (愚者佩之).
**Sages**, their **minds in harmony with the Dao** (心合於道), thus **diligently practice it** (勤而行之).
The **foolish**, their **nature bound by delusion** (性守於迷), merely **cling to it** (佩服而已).

The *Laozi* says:
*"Those who align with the Dao are one with the Dao,
those who align with virtue are one with virtue,
those who lose alignment are one with loss.
Those who align with the Dao, the Dao is obtained by them;
those who align with virtue, virtue is obtained by them;
those who align with loss, loss is obtained by them.
The foolish, not yet aligning with virtue and Dao,
may be called those who have lost the Dao."*

To **follow Yin and Yang** brings **life** (从阴阳则生),
to **contradict them** brings **death** (逆之则死),
to **follow them** brings **order** (从之则治),
to **contradict them** brings **chaos** (逆之则乱).
**Contrary to nature is rebellion** (反顺为逆),
this is called **internal obstruction** (内格).

**格** (格): *to obstruct, resist* (拒).
This means **one’s innate nature obstructs and resists the Heavenly Dao** (内性格拒於天道).
Thus, **Sages prevent illness before it arises** (不治已病治未病)
and **suppress disorder before it manifests** (不治已乱治未乱)—
this is what is spoken of here.

**Knowledge** (知) that **does not act in due time** (不及时) is shallow.
To **ward off vacuous malevolence** (备御虚邪) with **amulets** (事符) is like **grasping a tiger by its tail** (握虎),
or **treating a wound after it has been bitten** (噬而后药)—
though one may regret it, what use is there? (虽悔何为)

**Chapter on the Unity of Vital Qi and Heavenly Qi** (*Shēngqì Tōng Tiān Lùn*)

The Yellow Emperor said:
**"The Way of attaining unity with Heavenly Qi is the origin of life** (夫自古通天者，生之本),
**rooted in yin and yang** (本於阴阳).
Within the **six directions** (天地之问，六合之内)—
the **nine regions** (九州), the **nine orifices** (九窍),
the **five viscera** (五藏), and the **twelve nodes** (十二节)—
**all harmonize with Heaven’s vital qi** (皆通乎天气).

The **six directions** (六合) refer to the **four cardinal points and above and below** (四方上下).
The **nine regions** (九州) are **Jì, Yǎn, Qīng, Xú, Yáng, Jīng, Yù, Liáng, and Yōng** (冀兖青徐杨荆豫梁雍).
**Externally, the nine regions manifest** (外布九州),
**while internally, they correspond to the nine orifices** (而内应九窍),
thus it is said: **"the nine regions and nine orifices"** (故云九州九窍).

The **five viscera** (五藏) are the **five spiritual organs** (五神藏):
**the liver houses the soul** (肝藏魂),
**the heart houses the spirit** (心藏神),
**the spleen houses the intellect** (脾藏意),
**the lungs house the ethereal soul** (肺藏魄),
**the kidneys house the will** (肾藏志),
and **thus the body takes form** (而此成形矣).

The **twelve nodes** (十二节) are the **twelve vital qi** (十二气).
Heaven’s **twelve nodes of qi** (天之十二节气)
and the **twelve meridians** (人之十二经脉)
**externally correspond** (而外应之),
**all aligning with Heaven’s cosmic order** (咸同天纪),
thus it is said: **"all harmonize with Heaven’s vital qi"** (故云皆通乎天气).
The **twelve meridians** (十二经豚) are:
**the three yin and three yang of the hands** (手三阴三阳),
**and the three yin and three yang of the feet** (足三阴三阳).

**Newly corrected** (○新校正云):
**"The Way of attaining unity with Heavenly Qi is the origin of life"** (详通天者生之本),
**as explained in detail in the *Six Nodes and Organ Manifestations* commentary** (，《六节藏象》注甚详).
Moreover, it is noted that **Zhèng Kāngchéng** (郑康成) stated:
**"The nine orifices"** (九窍者),
**"are seven yang and two yin"** (谓阳窍七，阴窍二也).
**Five are for life** (其生五),
**and three are for qi** (其气三).
**Frequent violation** (数犯此者),
**allows malevolent qi to harm the person** (则邪气伤人),
**this is the foundation of lifespan** (此寿命之本也).

**The essence of life depends on the five vital qi internally** (言人生之所运为，则内依五气以立),
**yet externally, it is governed by the three elemental qi** (然其镇塞天地之内，则气应三元以成).
**The three** (三) refer to:
**Heavenly qi, Earthly qi, and Circulating qi** (天气、地气、运气).
**Violation** (犯) means **malevolent qi assaults the vital qi** (邪气触犯於生气).
**Frequent violation** (邪气数犯),
**threatens the vital qi** (则生气倾危),
thus **treasure and nourish the Heavenly True Qi** (故宝养天真),
**to safeguard the foundation of lifespan** (以为寿命之本也).

**Gēngsāng Chǔ said:**
**"The Sage’s regulation of all things is to preserve Heaven’s True Qi** (圣人之制万物也，以全其天),
**for when Heaven’s True Qi is whole, the spirit is whole** (天全则神全矣).
The *Spiritual Pivot* (*Língshū Jīng*) states:
**"Blood and qi are the person’s spirit** (血气者，人之神),
**and must not be neglected in nourishment** (不可不馑养).
This is the meaning conveyed here.

**The True Qi of Azure Heaven** (苍天之气),
**when clear and tranquil** (清静#1),
**stabilizes will and intent** (则志意治),
**and aligns with it, strengthens the yang qi** (顺之则阳气固).
**Spring is Azure Heaven** (春为苍天),
**the master of birth and growth** (发生之主也).
**Yang qi is Heaven’s qi** (阳气者，天气也).
As stated in the *Grand Treatise on Yin-Yang Correspondence* (*Yīnyáng Yìngxiàng Dàlùn*):
**"Clear yang is Heaven"** (清阳为天).
This clarifies its meaning.

**The principle of preserving Heaven’s True Qi to safeguard the spirit** (本天全神全之理),
**if whole, ensures the body is whole** (全则形亦全矣).
Even if **malevolent qi** (虽有贼邪) assails,
**it cannot harm** (弗能害),
**this is the order of following the seasons** (此因时之序).
**By adhering to Heaven’s seasonal qi** (以因天四时之气序),
**malevolent qi cannot harm** (故贼邪之气不能害也).
Thus, **the Sage transmits spiritual essence** (故圣人传精神),
**conforms to Heaven’s qi** (服天气),
**and attains unity with spirit and clarity** (而通神明).
**Spiritual essence can be transmitted only by those who attain the Dao** (夫精神可传),
**and only the Sage can achieve this** (惟圣人得道者乃能尔).
**Prolonged alignment with Heaven’s True Qi** (久服天真之气),
**allows divine application to manifest spontaneously** (则妙用自通於神明也).

**If violated** (失之),
**the nine orifices close internally** (则内闭九窍),
**the flesh becomes congested externally** (外壅肌肉),
**and the defensive qi disperses and dissolves** (卫气散解).
**Violation** (失) means **contradicting Azure Heaven’s cold purity** (逆苍天清冷之理).
**Defensive qi is the union of Heaven’s yang qi** (然卫气者，合天之阳气也).
As stated in the previous section:
**"Defensive qi is responsible for closing and sealing"** (上篇曰：阳气者闭塞).
**When the yang qi is diseased in a person, the orifices become obstructed** (谓阳气之病人，则窍写闭塞也).
The *Spiritual Pivot* (*Língshū Jīng*) states:
**"Defensive qi warms the flesh and fills the skin** (卫气者，所以温分肉而充皮肤),
**nourishes the sinews and regulates opening and closing** (肥胜理而司开阖).
Thus, **if its measure is lost** (故失其度),
**the nine orifices close internally** (则内闭九窍),
**the flesh becomes congested externally** (外壅肌肉),
**and since the defensive qi fails to circulate and nourish** (以卫不营运),
**it is said to disperse and dissolve** (故言散解也).
**Divide** (分) is pronounced with a rising tone.

**This describes self-inflicted harm, the depletion of qi** (此谓自伤，气之削也).
**To contradict Azure Heaven’s qi** (夫逆苍天之气),
**and defy the principle of clear tranquility** (违清静之理),
**is to deplete the True Qi as if it were shaved away** (使正真之气如削去之者),
**not a decree from Heaven, but self-made** (非天降之，人自为之尔).
**The yang qi** (阳气者),
**if likened to Heaven’s sun** (若天与日),
**when lost to its proper place** (失其所),
**then lifespan is shortened and obscured** (则#2折寿而不彰).

This illustrates the **previous function of yang qi** (此明前阳气之用也).
**It elucidates that a person’s yang, like Heaven’s sun** (谕人之有阳，若天之有日),
**when Heaven’s sun is lost to its place, becomes dark and murky** (天失其所，则日不明),
**and when a person’s yang is lost to its place, becomes unstable** (人失其所，则阳不固).
**A darkened sun obscures Heaven** (日不明则天暗暝昧),
**and unstable yang shortens one’s lifespan** (阳不固则人寿夭折).
Thus, **Heaven’s course must align with the sun’s radiance** (故天运当以日光明).
**It is said that a person’s life is indeed dependent on yang qi** (言人#3之生，固宜藉其阳气也).

**Therefore, yang qi ascends and consolidates externally** (是故阳因而上，卫外者也).
This explains the **portion of yang qi’s circulation** (此所以明阳气运行之部分),
**and how it supports the body’s True Qi** (辅卫人身之正甩也).

**When exposed to Heaven’s cold** (因於寒),
**one must act like a pivot’s mechanism** (欲如运枢),
**resting and moving with measured caution** (起居如惊),
**else the spirit and qi become agitated** (神气乃浮).
**Act like a pivot’s mechanism** (欲如运枢) means **internal movement** (谓内动也).
**Resting and moving with measured caution** (起居如惊) means **avoiding abrupt actions** (谓暴卒也).
**It is said that when encountering Heaven’s cold** (言因天之寒),
**one must dwell deeply and cautiously** (当深居周密),
**like the internal motion of a pivot’s mechanism** (如枢纽之内动).
**One must not agitate the sinews and bones** (不当烦扰筋骨),
**else the yang qi will be dissipated at the skin** (使阳气发泄於皮肤),
**and harmed by cold toxins** (而伤於寒毒也).
**If one rests and moves abruptly** (若起居暴卒),
**or indulges in reckless exertion** (驰骋荒佚),
**then the spirit and qi will float and exceed their bounds** (则神气浮越),
**finding no respite or tranquility** (无所缓#4宁矣).
The *Essentials of the Pivot* (*Tóngyào Jīngwéi Lùn*) states:
**"In winter, the day resides in the bones** (冬日在骨),
**the worms coil inward, and the virtuous person stays indoors** (垫虫周密，君子居室).
The *Grand Treatise on Adjusting the Spirit to the Four Seasons* (*Sìqì Tiáoshén Dàlùn*) states:
**"The three months of winter** (冬三月),
**are the time of closure and storage** (此谓闭藏),
**when water freezes and the earth cracks** (水冰地坼),
**and one must not disturb the yang** (无扰乎阳).
It further states:
**"Let the will be hidden, as if concealed or suppressed** (使志若伏若匿),
**as if harboring private intent** (若有私意),
**as if one had already gained something** (若己有得),
**and avoid exposure to cold, seeking warmth instead** (去寒就温),
**preventing the skin from being drained** (无泄皮肤),
**else the qi will be swiftly depleted** (使气亟夺).
This is the meaning conveyed here.

「○ The newly corrected edition states: The original text by **Guān Yuánqǐ** (全元起) reads *lián shū* (连枢). **Guān Yuánqǐ** further explains: **"The Dao/Way’s yang-qi is steadfast like a tied pivot"** (阳气定如连枢者), meaning **"the movement is governed"** (动系也).
*Co* (卒), pronounced as *cāng-mò* (倉沒切).
*Yì* (佚), pronounced as *xí* (逸).

When **excessive summer heat** (因於暑) causes **sweating** (汗), **restlessness** (烦) leads to **shortness of breath and loud exhalations** (则喘喝), while **calmness** (静) results in **excessive speech** (多言).
This is because **one cannot remain tranquil and restrained** (此则不能静慎), thus **suffering from cold-toxin harm** (伤於寒毒), which **transforms into summer-heat illness** (至夏而变暑病也).
**Restlessness** (烦) refers to **agitation** (烦躁), **calmness** (静) refers to **serenity** (安静), and **喝** (喝) means **forceful exhalation** (大呵出声).
The text explains that **summer-heat illness** (暑病) arises when **heat is not released through sweating** (不为发表), causing **pathogenic heat to invade internally** (邪热内攻), where **both exterior and interior are scorched** (中外俱热), hence the **agitation, shortness of breath, and frequent forceful exhalations** (故烦躁、喘、数大呵而出其声).
If **not agitated**, the **internal heat and exterior cold** (内热外冻) **congeal**, leading to **stagnant heat assaulting the core** (瘀热攻中), hence **excessive speech without pause** (故多言而不次).
**喝** (喝) is also pronounced as *wū* (呜).
**躁** (躁), pronounced as *zào* (到切).
**瘀** (瘀), pronounced as *yū* (呼葛切).
**痿** (痿), pronounced as *wěi* (於危切).

When **the body resembles a smoldering mound of charcoal** (体若墦炭), **sweating disperses the heat** (汗出而散).
This further clarifies the principle of **sweating as a remedy** (此之谓也).
Yet, if **the body is like an overturned mound blazing with heat** (体若翻炭之炎热者), how can one be saved?
**Sweating disperses the heat-qi** (叉以汗出，乃热气施散).
**墦** (墦) is mistakenly written as **躁** (躁), which is incorrect.

When **excessive dampness** (因於湿) **envelops the head like a wrapping** (首如裹), **damp-heat fails to disperse** (湿热不攘), the **major sinews and channels contract** (大筋经短), while the **minor sinews slacken and elongate** (小筋弛长).
**Contracted sinews cause stiffness** (换短为拘), and **elongated sinews cause atrophy** (弛长为痿).
If **surface damp-heat causes illness** (表热为病), **sweating should be induced to release it** (当汗泄之).
But if **dampness envelops the head** (反湿其首), like a **damp object wrapped around it** (若湿物裹之), seeking to **remove the heat** (望除其热),
**heat-qi is not expelled**, and **dampness invades internally**, the **major sinews, scorched by heat, contract and shorten** (大筋受热则缩而短), while the **minor sinews, exposed to dampness, elongate and stretch** (小筋得湿则引而长).
**Shortened contraction causes stiffness and rigidity** (缩短故拘孪而不伸), and **elongated stretching causes atrophy and weakness** (引长故痿弱而无力).
**弛** (弛) means **to slacken or stretch** (引).
**攘** (攘), pronounced as *rǒng* (汝陽切), means **to remove or disperse** (除).
**锲** (锲), pronounced as *ruǎn* (軟), means **to contract or shrink** (缩).
**痿** (痿) means **atrophy or weakness** (弱).

When **illness arises from imbalance in the Dao/Way’s qi** (因於气), it manifests as **swelling** (为肿).
The **four dimensions of the body** (四维) **mutually exhaust each other** (相代), leading to **yang-qi depletion** (阳气乃竭).
Those with **inherent qi deficiency** (素常气疾), when **damp-heat exacerbates it** (湿热加之), experience **contention between qi, dampness, and heat** (气湿热争), hence the **swelling** (故为肿).
Yet as **pathogenic qi grows stronger** (邪气渐盛) and **vital qi wanes** (正气浸微), the **sinews, bones, blood, and flesh mutually exhaust and burden each other** (筋骨血肉互相代负), hence the phrase **"the four dimensions mutually exhaust each other"** (故云四维相代).
When **pathogenic qi replaces vital qi** (致邪代正), **qi fails to circulate freely** (气不宣通), and the **defensive-qi** (卫) **lacks passageways** (无所从), leading to **decline and exhaustion** (便至衰竭), hence the **yang-qi is depleted** (故言阳气乃竭).
The **defensive-qi** (卫) is the **yang-qi** (阳气).
The **yang-qi** (阳气), when **overburdened by restlessness and fatigue** (烦劳则张), **consumes vitality** (精绝), **accumulates in summer** (辟积於夏), and **torments the body, causing collapse** (使人煎厥).
This again warns against **sudden changes in activity and rest** (起居暴卒) and **disturbing the harmonious yang** (烦扰阳和).
For **restlessness disturbs the harmonious yang** (烦扰阳和), **fatigues the sinews and bones** (劳疲筋骨), **movement harms the spirit-qi** (动伤神气), and **consumes the innate vitality** (耗竭天真), the **sinews and vessels swell** (则筋脉胀), **vital qi is exhausted** (精气竭绝), and **both kidney-qi is injured and the bladder is impaired** (既伤肾气又损膀胱), hence in **summer, it causes torment and collapse** (故当於夏时，使人煎厥).
This is because **the tormenting heat drives qi upward** (以煎迫而气逆), and **the name "煎厥" (煎厥) is derived from this** (因畎煎厥为名).
**厥** (厥) means **qi reversal** (气逆).
The **manifestations of 煎厥 (煎厥)** are as follows:

○ The newly corrected edition states: According to *The Pulse Explanations* (*Mài Jiě*) (《脉解》):
**"Those with deficient qi and prone to anger"** (所谓少气善怒者) are said to have **unregulated yang-qi** (阳气不治).
When **yang-qi is unregulated** (阳气不治), it **cannot disperse freely** (不得出), and the **liver’s qi, which should be regulated, is instead unregulated** (肝气当治而未得), hence **prone to anger** (故善怒).
**Prone to anger** (善怒者) is called **煎厥** (煎厥).
The **eyes are blind and cannot see** (目盲不可以视), the **ears are closed and cannot hear** (耳闭不可以听).
The **state is chaotic, as if the body’s foundation crumbles** (溃溃乎若坏都), and **the turmoil cannot be stopped** (汨汨乎不可止).
Since **kidney-qi is already injured** (既且伤肾), and **the bladder is exhausted** (又竭膀胱),
the **kidney channel internally connects to the ears** (肾经内属於耳中), and the **bladder’s dharma** (膀胱豚) **emanates from the eyes** (生於目), hence:
**the eyes are blind and cannot see** (故目盲所视), **the ears are closed and cannot hear** (耳闭厥听).
Great indeed is this **the breath of the bedroom** (斯乃房之息也).

When **both the eyes are blind and the ears are closed** (既盲目视，又闭耳聪),
the **will, intent, and spirit-qi** (志意心神) **are disrupted**, and the **sinews, bones, intestines, and stomach** (筋骨肠胃)
**are in disarray, as if the body’s foundation crumbles** (渍渍乎若坏都), and **the turmoil cannot be stopped** (汨汨乎烦问而不可止).
**汨** (汨), pronounced as *mò* (古沒切).
The **eyes** (目) is pronounced as *jì* (计切).」

The **yang-qi**, when one rages violently, causes the **form-qi to be severed**, and the blood **congeals upward**, leading to **thin collapse** (薄厥). This again warns that **unrestrained joy and anger** generate illness through excessive use.

Yet, anger injures the **kidneys**; when severe, it severs the **qi**, and great anger causes the **qi to reverse**, preventing the **yang from descending**. Since the **yang reverses**, the blood **accumulates within the chest and heart**. "Upper" refers to the **chest and heart**.

When **yin and yang clash**, the **qi and blood surge chaotically**, giving rise to **thin collapse**, hence the name **thin collapse**.

The *Discourse on Manifest Pain* states: *"Anger causes the qi to reverse; when severe, it leads to vomiting blood."*
The *Spiritual Pivot* states: *"Unchecked great anger injures the will."*
The *Grand Treatise on Yin-Yang Correspondence* states: *"Joy and anger injure the qi."*

Thus, when anger is extreme, the **qi reverses**, and the blood **accumulates within the chest and heart**. **菀 (yùn)**, meaning *accumulate*. **并 (bìng)**, pronounced with a falling tone.

There is injury to the **sinews**, causing **tightness**—as if they cannot contain. When anger is excessive, the **qi may press upon the sinews**, internally damaging the **sinew networks**, loosening the **joint mechanisms**, causing **withering and atrophy of the body’s form**, as if unsupported.

**Sweat emerges unevenly**, leading to **one-sided withering**. In humans, when **sweat constantly emerges on one side and moistens**, over time, it causes **one-sided roughness**, and half the body becomes unresponsive.

*New Annotation*: According to the *Thousand-Gold*, **沮 (jǔ)** is written as **祖 (zǔ)**, while Quan Yuanqi’s text uses **恒 (héng)**. **沮 (jǔ)**, pronounced *zǐyú*, means *moisten*. When sweat appears and moistens, **pustules and heat rashes** arise.

When **yang-qi is dissipated**, cold restrains it, and **internal residual heat** festered beneath the skin. When severe, it becomes **pustules and boils**; when mild, it forms **heat rashes**. **痱 (fèi)**, meaning *wind itch*. **痤 (cuó)**, pronounced *zuòhé*. **痱 (fèi)**, pronounced *fāngwèi*. **怫 (fú)**, pronounced *fúfú*.

The **high-grain diet’s transformation** causes **large moles** to form on the feet—**receptive as holding a void**. **高 (gāo)**, meaning *grease*. **梁 (liáng)**, meaning *grain*. Those who **cannot endure** sweat excessively, washing it away, develop **pustules and heat rashes**; those who consume **grease and grain** internally harbor **stagnant heat**, with thick skin and dense flesh, thus **internally transforming into moles**. When **external dampness invades** and **internal heat responds**, it is like holding a **void vessel**, receiving this **evil toxin**, hence the saying *"receptive as holding a void."* The reason **moles arise on the feet** is that the **four limbs are the roots of all yang**. Since they are **severely taxed below**, evil toxins seize the void.

*New Annotation*: The location where **moles arise** is not always the feet. It refers to the **grease-and-grain diet’s transformation**, producing **large moles**, not necessarily localized to the feet.

When **labor-induced sweat is exposed to wind**, **cold assails thinly**, causing **pustules**; when suppressed, they become **boils**. During **cold, chilly months**, when the body labors and sweat emerges, **chilling winds strike externally**, causing the **pores to contract with cold**, congealing **fat and fluids** within the **marsh cavities**. They seep into empty spaces, forming **pustules** beneath the skin—like grains or needles. Over time, they darken, lengthen, and split, turning **white and yellow**, then **contract within the marsh cavities**. Commonly called **acne**, this is resolved by **dispersing the exterior**.

**玄府 (xuánfǔ)**, meaning the **sweat cavities**. **痤 (cuó)**, meaning **red, inflamed pustules**. Internally, they **harbor blood and pus**, small at first but growing as large as **sour plums** or **pressed beans**—all caused by **internal stagnation of yang-qi**, requiring **further attack**. When severe, they **burst outward**.

**齄 (qì)**, pronounced *zhījiā*. **蓄 (xù)**, pronounced *xǔzhú*.

**德 (dé)**, pronounced *chǐzhì*.
**爇 (liè)**, pronounced *érliè*.

The **yang-qi**, when refined, nourishes the **spirit**; when gentle, it nourishes the **sinews**.
This further elucidates the **Way** in which **yang-qi** circulates and nourishes.

Yet **yang-qi**, internally, transforms into **subtle essence**, nourishing the **spirit-qi**; externally, it manifests as **gentle resilience**, fortifying the **sinews**. When its **movement and rest** are improper, it gives rise to **various ailments**.

When **opening and closing** are obstructed, **cold-qi** invades, thus producing **大楼 (dàlóu)**.
**Opening** refers to the **skin’s dominance** in **dispersing and venting**.
**Closing** refers to the **sweat cavities’** sealing shut.

Yet when **opening and closing** are improper, and **cold-qi** seizes upon it, penetrating deep into the **sinews and vessels**, congealing into **hollow cold**, the **sinews and channels** become rigid and contracted—**the body’s posture stoops and bends**.
As the *Língshū Jīng* states: *"Cold makes the sinews contract."* This is of the same kind.

**凄 (qī)**, pronounced *lìzhǔ*.
**陷脉 (xiànmài)** leads to **痪 (huàn)**, lingering in the **flesh’s excess**.
**陷豚 (xiàntún)**—when **cold-qi** sinks into the **navel’s hollow**, accumulating and lingering, the **menstrual blood** stagnates and congeals. Over time, **stagnant heat** attacks internally, forming **ulcers and paralysis (huàn)** within the flesh, where **excess flesh connects in chains**.
**痪 (huàn)**, pronounced *lìdòu*—**paralysis**.

When **acupuncture points and vessels** weaken, **terror and dread** arise, and **fright ensues**.
If **cold-qi** invades the **back’s acupuncture points**, its **transformation** deepens, weakening the **zàng-fǔ (viscera-palaces)**, leading to **excessive fear** and **sudden fright**.

When **campo-qi** does not circulate, it **reverses through the flesh’s interstices**, producing **瘫肿 (tānzhǒng)**.
If **campo-qi** reverses, **blood stagnates**; if **blood stagnates**, **heat accumulates into pus**, thus forming **瘫肿 (tānzhǒng)**.
As the *Zhènglǐ Lùn* states: *"Where heat passes, there arises **瘫肿 (tānzhǒng)**."*

When **po-qi** has not fully exhausted, the **form weakens** and **qi scatters**; if **acupuncture points and vessels close**, it manifests as **wind-intermittent fever (fēngnüè)**.
If **sweat does not cease**, the **form weakens** and **qi dissipates**; when **wind and cold** assail, the **acupuncture points and vessels close in turn**. **Heat** is trapped within, until **autumn**, when **autumnal yang** withdraws—**both heats combine**, causing **shivering**. As **cold and heat alternate**, the **onset is attributed to wind**, hence the name **wind-intermittent fever (fēngnüè)**.
As the *Jīnguì Zhēnyán Lùn* states: *"In summer, if sweat does not emerge, autumn will yield **wind-intermittent fever (fēngnüè)**."*
This is because the **discourse follows wind** in its nature.

Thus, the following text states:

Thus, **wind** is the origin of a hundred maladies. When one maintains **cleanness and tranquility**, the flesh grows strong and closed, repelling even fierce winds and poisons—this follows the natural order of the seasons.

If one does not indulge in excessive desires to weary the eyes, nor allow licentiousness to confuse the mind, and does not engage in reckless labor, this is **cleanness and tranquility**. Because of this **cleanness and tranquility**, the flesh grows strong and closed, the skin becomes dense, and the **true essence** internally repels **void pathogens**. Yet even fierce winds and poisons do not habitually seek out humans—rather, it is due to human transgression.

Thus, when one maintains **cleanness and tranquility**, the flesh grows strong and closed, the **yang qi** repels, and fierce winds and poisons cannot harm them. **Cleanness and tranquility** means following the seasonal **qi** in nurturing life and regulating well-being, avoiding reckless labor, and maintaining measured daily rhythms—thus the **generative qi** does not exhaust, and enduring well-being is preserved.

When illness persists, it transmutes and shifts, with **upper and lower** not harmonizing—even a skilled physician cannot remedy it. **"Upper and lower"** refers to the **qi** pathways intersecting. Yet when illness is deep and prolonged, transformations pass through one another, **upper and lower** become obstructed, and **yin and yang** are severed—even with refined medical techniques, what can be done?

As the *Yīnyáng Yìngxiàng Dàlùn* states:
*"The adept practitioner of acupuncture follows **yin** to draw **yang**, follows **yang** to draw **yin**, treating the right with the left, the left with the right. If **qi** becomes mutually obstructed, even a skilled physician cannot intervene."* **"Severed"** means **blocked**.

Thus, when **yang** accumulates and stagnates, death ensues, and **yang qi** becomes isolated—**isolation** must be purged. If not urgently treated, even a crude practitioner will bring ruin. This is because **three yangs** accumulate and stagnate, failing to disperse—if not urgently purged, death follows. How is this verified? **Obstruction and blockage** manifest in symptoms. If not urgently purged, even an unskilled practitioner, through contempt, will witness defeat and demise.

The *Yīnyáng Biélùn* states:
*"The **three yangs** congealed is called **isolation**."* It further says:
*"When **rigid** meets **rigid**, **yang qi** scatters and dissipates, and **yin qi** perishes."* **"Pure"** means **rigid and soft** are unbalanced, and the **channel qi** is severed. **"Tán"** (潭) is pronounced *nǔjiào qiè*.

Thus, **yang qi** governs the exterior during the day. In daylight, **yang qi** circulates externally, traversing the body in twenty-five degrees. As the *Língshū Jīng* states:
*"When the eyes open, **qi** ascends to the head. The **defensive qi** circulates through the **yang** pathways in twenty-five degrees."*

On ordinary days, **qi** is generated anew. At noon, **yang qi** is at its peak; as the sun sets, **yang qi** weakens, and the **qi gates** close. **"Lóng"** means **elevated** or **flourishing**. All **qi** follows the pattern of rising from **less** to **fullness**, accumulating warmth to become **heat**, then cooling when **heat** reaches its extreme—this is the nature of things.

Thus, **yang qi** arises at dawn, flourishes at noon, and declines by dusk. The **qi gates**—meaning the **mysterious orifice**—serve to vent the **channel, nourishing, and defensive qi**, hence called **qi gates**. Therefore, at dusk, one should withdraw and conserve, avoiding straining the sinews and bones, and exposure to mist and dew. To contravene these three times weakens the **form**. These are all means to follow **yang qi**.

When **yang** emerges, it emerges; when **yang** is concealed, it is concealed. As dusk approaches, **yang qi** wanes and moves inward through the **yin** pathways—thus, one should gather inward to repel **void pathogens**. Straining the sinews and bones depletes **yang essence**, and exposure to mist and dew invites **cold and dampness** to invade. Thus, adhering to these three times preserves **Heavenly Purity** for the long term.

**Qíbó** said:
*"The newly corrected text notes: See the beginning of the chapter where the Emperor speaks—here, **Qíbó** speaks, not in dialogue."*

**Yin** stores **essence** and rises swiftly; **yang** guards the exterior and provides firmness. This describes their roles in the human body. **"Swift"** means **frequent**. When **yin** cannot overcome **yang**, the pulse becomes thin and rapid, and **excess** leads to **madness**. **"Thin and rapid"** means extreme **voidness** and haste. **"Excess"** refers to **fullness and rigidity**; **"madness"** means **frantic movement** or **reckless climbing**.

When **yang** accumulates in the **four limbs**, it causes **madness**. As the *Yángmíng Yǒngjiě* states:
*"The **four limbs** are the roots of all **yang**."* When **yang** is excessive, the **four limbs** become rigid—rigidity enables climbing heights and singing, while **heat** overwhelming the body causes one to discard clothing and flee.

All such cases arise from **yin** failing to overcome **yang**.

When **yang** fails to overcome **yin**, the **five zàng** (viscera) **qi** contend, and the **nine orifices** become blocked.

The **nine orifices** (九窍) are those that internally belong to the **zàng** (藏) and externally serve as **officials** (官). Thus, when the **five zàng** **qi** contend, the **nine orifices** become blocked. This refers to both the **front and rear orifices** being obstructed, and also includes the **seven upper orifices**.

If they contend, then the **eyes** are the **officials** of the **liver**, the **nose** of the **lungs**, the **mouth** of the **spleen**, the **ears** of the **kidneys**, and the **tongue** of the **heart**—though the **tongue** is not itself an orifice.

The *Jīn Guì Zhēn Yán Lùn* states:
*"The **southern region** (南方) of **red color** (赤色) enters and communicates with the **heart**, opening the orifice at the **ears**. The **northern region** (北方) of **black color** (黑色) enters and communicates with the **kidneys**, opening the orifices at the **two yīn** (阴)."*

Thus, the **sages** (聖人) expound upon **yin** and **yang**, harmonizing **sinews and vessels** (筋脉) so that **bone marrow** (骨髓) becomes firm and **qi** and **blood** flow in accordance.

**"Flow"** (從) means **"to follow"** (順). This states that if one adheres to the **Dao** of **yin** and **yang**, approaching the **Way** of **nourishing life** (養生), then **sinews and vessels**, **bone marrow**, and each will find its proper function, and thus **qi** and **blood** can all follow the seasons and harmonize with the **cosmic breath** (和氣).

In such cases, the **inner and outer** (内外) are balanced and clear, and **evil** cannot harm. The **ears and eyes** become keen, and the **true qi** (真氣) stands firm as before.

When **evil qi** (邪氣) cannot overcome, the **true qi** (真氣) remains independent and unaltered.

If one loses the **sage’s Way** (聖人之道), then illness arises in the body. Thus, the following passage cites:

*"When **wind** (風) intrudes as **adulterous qi** (淫氣), **essence** (精) is lost, and the **liver** (肝) is harmed by **evil** (邪)."* From here onward, the four cases all refer to losing the **sage’s Way**.

**Wind** (風) corresponds to the **liver** (肝), so when **adulterous qi** (淫氣) of **wind** (風) causes **essence** (精) to be lost, the **liver** is harmed.

The *Yīn Yáng Yìng Xiàng Dà Lùn* states:
*"The **wind** (風) **qi** communicates with the **liver** (肝)."*

When **wind** is thin, **heat** arises; when **heat** is excessive, **water** (液) dries up, and if **water** dries up, the **kidney qi** (肾气) fails to nourish, and thus **essence** is lost.

**"Lost"** (亡) means **"absent"** (无).

---
Newly corrected reading states: According to Quán Yuánqǐ, **"adulterous qi"** (淫氣) refers to the **disordered qi** of **yin** and **yang**. Because of their disorder, when **wind** intrudes, it harms **essence**, and harming **essence** allows **evil** to enter the **liver**.

If one then overeats, the **sinews and vessels** (筋脉) become **crosswise and slack** (横解), and the **intestines** (肠) **twist** (僻) to form **hemorrhoids** (痔).

When overeating is severe, the **intestines and stomach** (肠胃) become **crosswise and full** (横满). If the **intestines and stomach** are full, the **sinews and vessels** become slack and fail to connect, so the **intestines** **twist** (辨) and form **hemorrhoids** (痔).

The *Bì Lùn* states:
*"When **drink and food** (饮食) are doubled, the **intestines and stomach** (肠胃) are injured."* This is the **truth** of the injury.

**"Twist"** (僻), pronounced *pìjié*.

If one then indulges in **excessive drinking** (大饮), the **qi** becomes **reversed** (逆). When **drinking** is excessive, the **lung’s dispersed leaves** (肺布叶) rise, and thus the **qi** becomes **reversed** and **rushes upward** (上奔).

If one then exerts **strong force** (强力), the **kidney qi** (肾气) is injured, and the **high bones** (高骨) **decay** (坏).

**"Strong force"** (强力) refers to **excessive sexual activity** (强力入房). **"High bones"** (高骨) refers to the **lumbar vertebrae** (腰高之骨). When one exerts **strong force** (强力) in **sexual activity** (入房), **essence** is depleted; when **essence** is depleted, the **kidneys** are harmed; when the **kidneys** are harmed, the **marrow qi** (髓气) withers internally, and thus the **lumbar vertebrae** decay and become **non-functional** (不用).

The **sages** (聖人) **exchange and harmonize** (交会), but it is not like this. Instead, it is as follows:

*"The **essentials** (要) of **yin** and **yang** (阴阳) are that **yang** (陽) is **closed and firm** (密乃固)."* The **essentials** of **yin** and **yang** **exchange and harmonization** (交会) lie in **yang qi** being **closed and firm** (闭密) without **reckless dissipation** (妄泄).

When **closed and firm** (密), the **generative qi** (生气) is strong and enduring, which is the **sage’s Way** (聖人之道).

When the **two** (阴阳) are **not harmonized** (不和), it is like **spring without autumn** (春无秋) or **winter without summer** (冬无夏).

**"Two"** (两) refers to **yin** and **yang**; **"harmonized"** (和) means **"to unite"** (和合), which is **exchange and harmonization** (交会). **"Like"** (若) means **"as"** (如). This states that those who **sever and abandon** (绝废) the **Way** of **yin** and **yang** **unity** (和合) are like the four seasons of heaven, where there is **spring without autumn** or **winter without summer**.

This is why the **sages** do not **sever and abandon** the **Way** of **unity**, but instead **value closing and firmness** (闭密) to **guard and solidify** (守固). This is the **law of Heavenly Truth** (天真法).

If one then **harmonizes** (和), this is called the **"sage’s measure"** (聖度).

When **yang qi** is **excessively emitted** (盛发), the **inner and outer** (中外) respond in kind, and **courage** (贾勇) is **abundant** (有余) in **exchange and harmonization** (相交合), thus establishing the **sage’s method** (制度).

Thus, when **yang** is **strong yet cannot close firmly** (强不能密), the **yin qi** becomes **severed** (絶). When **yang** is **excessively strong** (自强) yet fails to **close firmly** (闭密), the **yin** **dissipates** (泄写) and **essence qi** (精气) is **exhausted and severed** (竭绝).

When **yin** is **balanced** (平) and **yang** is **closed and firm** (阳秘), the **spirit** (精神) is **healed** (治). When **yin qi** is **balanced** (平) and **yang qi** is **closed and firm** (闭密), the **spirit’s** functions **daily improve** (日益治).

When **yin** and **yang** are **separated and severed** (离决), the **essence qi** becomes **severed** (絶). If **yin** is **not balanced** (不平) and **yang** is **not closed and firm** (不秘), and one **exerts oneself recklessly** (强用) while **dissipating** (施写), then **Heavenly Truth** (天真) is **damaged and depleted** (损耗), and the **two qi** (二气) are **divided** (分离). When the **meridians and collaterals** (经络) **become exhausted** (次惫), the **essence qi** fails to **transform and circulate** (不化), and thus its **flow** (流通) is **severed** (絶).

Due to **exposure to dew and wind** (露风), **cold and heat** (寒热) arise.

Due to **exposure of the body** (露体), when one **contacts or is assaulted by wind evil** (触冒风邪), the **wind qi** intrudes externally, and **yang qi** resists internally. When **wind** and **yang** are **thin and weak** (相薄), **cold and heat** (寒热) arise.

Thus, **spring** injuries from **wind** (風) leave **evil qi lingering** (邪气留连), resulting in **diarrhea** (洞泄).

**Wind qi** communicates with the **liver**; in **spring**, the **liver** (木) rules, and **wood** (木) overcomes **earth** (脾土), so **diarrhea** (洞泄) arises.

---
Newly corrected reading states: According to the *Yīn Yáng Yìng Xiàng Dà Lùn*, **"spring** injuries from **wind** (風) lead to **summer** **diarrhea** (飧泄)."****

**"Summer** injuries from **heat** (暑) result in **autumn** **intermittent fevers** (疚疟)."****

In **summer**, **heat** is already severe; in **autumn**, **yang** withdraws and **heat** attacks. When **yang** and **heat** contend, it results in **intermittent fevers** (疢疟).

**"Intermittent fevers"** (疢), meaning **"aged"** (老) or also **"emaciated"** (瘦).

**"Autumn** injuries from **dampness** (湿) lead to **reversed cough** (逆咳)."****

**"Dampness"** (湿) refers to the **earth’s damp qi** (地湿气). In **autumn**, **dampness** prevails, and in **winter**, **water** (水) rules. When **water** comes to **overwhelm the lungs** (乘肺), **reversed cough** (咳逆) arises.

---
Newly corrected reading states: According to the *Yīn Yáng Yìng Xiàng Dà Lùn*, **"autumn** injuries from **dampness** (湿) lead to **winter** **coughing** (咳嗽)."****

When **dampness** attacks the **zàng** and **fǔ** (藏府) internally, it causes **reversed cough** (咳逆); when it **scatters externally** to the **sinews and vessels** (筋脉), it results in **weakness and sudden collapse** (痿厥).

The *Yīn Yáng Yìng Xiàng Dà Lùn* states:
*"The **earth’s damp qi** (地之湿气), when felt, harms the **skin, flesh, sinews, and tendons** (皮肉筋豚)."*

Thus, the **resources** of **dampness** (湿气之资) manifest as **weakness and sudden collapse** (痿厥).

**"Sudden collapse"** (厥) refers to **reversed qi** (逆气).

**"Winter** injuries from **cold** (寒) lead to **spring** **warm diseases** (温病)."****

In **winter**, **cold** is **congealed** (且凝), and in **spring**, **yang qi** emerges. If **cold** is **not released** (不为释), **yang** becomes **irritated within** (怫於中), and **cold** and **yang** **contend internally** (相持), resulting in **warm diseases** (温病).

「○ *Xīn Jiàozhèng* states: Following this passage is **overlapping** with the *Yīn Yáng Yìng Xiàng Dà Lùn*—its commentary is far more detailed. The **qi** of the **Four Seasons** (四时之气), in turn, **injures the Five Zang** (五藏).

**Cold, heat, warmth, and coolness** (寒暑温凉), **sequentially** **overcome and are overcome by one another** (递相胜负), hence the **qi** of the **Four Seasons** **alternately injures the harmony of the Five Zang** (更伤五藏之和也).

The **origin of yin** (阴之所生) **lies in the Five Flavors** (五味). The **Five Palaces of yin** (阴之五宫) **are injured by the Five Flavors** (伤在五味).
By **"yin"** (阴), it is meant the **Five Spiritual Zang** (五神藏).
**"Palaces"** (官) **are the confluence of the Five Spirits** (五神之合).
**The Five Spirits**#11 **are generated by the Five Flavors** (五神所生), **rooted in the Five Flavors** (本资於五味). When the **Five Flavors** **are properly assimilated and transformed** (五味宣化), each **fulfills its role in its respective Palace** (各奏於本官). Though **they arise from the Five Flavors** (虽因五味以生), **they also decline from the Five Flavors** (亦因五味以损). When one **indulges excessively beyond moderation** (正为好而过节), **injury manifests** (乃见伤也).

Thus, it is said:
*"If the **flavor is excessive in sourness** (味过於酸), the **liver’s qi** **becomes damp** (肝气以津), and the **spleen’s qi** **is severed** (脾气乃绝).
When one consumes **too much sourness** (酸多食之), it **causes sores** (令人疮) and **difficult urination** (小便不利). Thus, the **liver accumulates excess fluids** (则肝多津液). If **fluids overflow internally** (津液内溢), the **liver’s leaf** (肝叶) **is elevated** (举), and when the **liver’s leaf** **is elevated** (肝叶举), the **spleen’s channel qi** **is severed and does not flow** (脾经之气绝而不行). Why? **Wood restrains Earth** (木制土也).

If the **flavor is excessive in saltiness** (味过於咸), the **qi of the large bones** **is exhausted** (大骨气劳), the **short sinews** (短肌) **are affected**, and the **heart’s qi** **is suppressed** (心气抑).
When one consumes **too much saltiness** (咸多食之), it **causes shrinking of the muscles and skin** (令人肌肤缩短) and **suppresses the heart’s qi**, making it **stagnant and non-flowing** (又令心气抑滞而不行). Why? **Saltiness governs the blood** (咸走血也). **Exhaustion of the large bones’ qi** (大骨气劳) **is due to saltiness returning to the kidneys** (咸归肾也).

If the **flavor is excessive in sweetness** (味过於甘), the **heart’s qi** **becomes congested and distended** (心气喘满), its **complexion turns dark** (色黑), and the **kidney’s qi** **is unbalanced** (肾气不衡).
When one consumes **too much sweetness** (甘多食之), it **causes heart palpitations** (令人心问).
Sweetness **has a stagnant and slow nature** (甘性滞缓), hence it **causes the heart’s qi to become congested and distended**, while the **kidneys are unsettled** (而肾不平). Why? **Earth suppresses Water** (土抑水也). **Unbalanced** (不衡) **is the same as unsettled** (平).

If the **flavor is excessive in bitterness** (味过於苦), the **spleen’s qi** **is not nourished** (脾气不濡), and the **stomach’s qi** **becomes thickened** (胃气乃厚).
Bitterness **has a firm and dry nature** (苦性坚燥) and **also nourishes the spleen and stomach**, hence the **spleen’s qi** **is not nourished** (脾气不濡) while the **stomach’s qi** **becomes strong and thickened** (胃气强厚).

If the **flavor is excessive in pungency** (味过於辛), the **sinews and vessels** **become slack and unmoistened** (筋脉沮弛), and the **spirit** **becomes depleted** (精神乃央).
**Slack** (沮) **is the same as unmoistened** (润). **Depleted** (央) **is the same as prolonged exhaustion** (久).
Pungency **has a moistening and lubricating nature** (辛性润泽) and **scatters to nourish the sinews** (散养於筋), hence it **causes the sinews to relax and the vessels to be moistened**, while the **spirit endures long** (精神长久).
Why? **Pungency supplements the liver** (辛补肝也).

The *Zàng Qì Fǎ Shí Lùn* states:
*"The liver desires to disperse (肝欲散), so **urgently consume pungent** (急食辛) **to disperse it**, and **use pungent to supplement it** (用辛补之)."*

○ *Xīn Jiàozhèng* states: Following this passage, the **injury caused by excessive flavors** (味过所伤) **is difficult to reconcile with the notion of "spirit enduring long"** (精神长久). **Depleted** (央) **is a misfortune** (殃).
Ancient texts often interchange characters, such as **膏粱** being used as **高梁** or **草滋** as **草兹**, due to **ancient script’s brevity** and **frequent use of borrowed characters** (盖古文简略，字多假借用者).

Thus, **one must carefully harmonize the Five Flavors** (故谨和五味), **to straighten the bones and soften the sinews** (骨正筋柔), **to ensure the smooth flow of qi and blood** (气血以流), **and to preserve the principles of overcoming** (胜理以密). If done so, **the bones and qi** **will be refined** (气骨以精).
**Diligently following the Dao’s methods** (谨道如法), **one will long possess celestial vitality** (长有天命).
This is **the supreme Dao of cultivating and nourishing True Nature** (所谓修养天真之至道也).

**Gold Case True Speech Treatise**

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"The heavens have eight winds, the classics speak of five winds—what does this mean?*
The classics refer to *Jīngtún* (经豚), which governs the circulation of the *yíng* and *wèi* and the flow of *qi* and blood."

Qìbó replied: *"When the eight winds arise as pathogenic forces, they become the *jīng* winds. When they strike the five *Zàng* organs, the pathogenic *qi* manifests as disease.
Examining their origin: the eight winds, when pathogenic, enter the *jīngmai* (meridians), then follow their paths to strike the five *Zàng* organs, where the pathogenic *qi* assaults the righteous *qi*, thus causing disease.

What is meant by *four seasons’ victory*: spring overcomes *zhǎngxià* (long summer), *zhǎngxià* overcomes winter, winter overcomes summer, summer overcomes autumn, and autumn overcomes spring—this is what is called the *four seasons’ victory*.
Spring is wood, summer is fire, *zhǎngxià* is earth, autumn is metal, winter is water; each overcomes by what it subdues—this is their victory.

When speaking of the five seasons’ mutual victory, it does not mean that the eight winds, upon entering, cause disease, but rather that each season’s weakness invites disease.

*Victory* means to subdue and conquer.

The east wind arises in spring, its disease affects the liver, and its *shù* (acupuncture point) is at the neck and nape.
Spring wind first stirs the *róng* (blossoms) of all things, so its *shù* is at the neck and nape. The *Lìjì* (历忌) states: *‘On days *jiǎ-yǐ* (甲乙), do not treat the neck.’* This is what is meant.

The south wind arises in summer, its disease affects the heart, and its *shù* is at the chest and ribs.
The heart’s *shàoyīn* meridian ascends the chest and emerges at the ribs, so its *shù* is there.

The west wind arises in autumn, its disease affects the lungs, and its *shù* is at the shoulders and back.
The lungs govern the upper burner; the back is the chest’s *fǔ* (palace), and shoulders and back follow in sequence, so its *shù* is there.

The north wind arises in winter, its disease affects the kidneys, and its *shù* is at the waist and thighs.
The waist is the kidney’s *fǔ*, and the thighs follow in sequence, connected by *qi*, so both are mentioned.

The center is earth, its disease affects the spleen, and its *shù* is at the spine.
The spine corresponds to earth, and it resides centrally.

Thus, spring *qi* diseases manifest in the head—spring *qi* refers to liver *qi*—each following the *Zàng* organ’s corresponding *qi*.

**Newly corrected text:** According to the *Zhōulǐ* (周礼), *"In spring, there are many head ailments."*

Summer *qi* diseases manifest in the *Zàng* organs—this is the heart’s correspondence.
Autumn *qi* diseases manifest in the shoulders and back—this is the lungs’ correspondence.
Winter *qi* diseases manifest in the four limbs.
The four limbs have little *qi*; cold toxins easily injure them, and disease follows the pathogenic *qi* that enters.

Thus, spring often causes *guǐniǔ* (鼻血/鼻涕),
as the *Lǐjì Yùelìng* (礼记月令) states: *"If *jìqiū* (季秋) follows *xiàlìng* (夏令), the people often suffer from *guǐniǔ*."*

Mid-summer often causes chest and rib diseases,
for the heart’s meridian follows the chest and ribs.

Long summer often causes *dòngxiè* (洞泄) and cold in the abdomen,
as earth governs the center, becoming the *cānglín zāopò shuǐgǔ* (倉廩糟粕水谷)—thus causing *dòngxiè* and cold in the abdomen.

Autumn often causes wind and *yuè* (疟),
for cooling breaks summer heat, resulting in this disease.
The *Shēngqì Tōngtiān Lùn* (生气通天论) states: *"If *pòhàn* (魄汗) is not fully released, the form is weak and *qi* is scattered; the *xùshù* (穴俞) close, and wind-*yuè* emerges."* This explains cooling breaking summer heat.

The *Lǐjì Yùelìng* states: *"If *mèngqiū* (孟秋) follows *xiàlìng* (夏令), the people often suffer from *yuèjí* (疟疾)."*

Winter often causes *bìjué* (痹厥).
Blood follows water; cold causes it to congeal like ice, and with *qi* flowing thinly, *bìjué* results.

Thus, if in winter one does not practice *ànjiāo* (按娇),
and in spring does not practice *guǐniǔ* (轨钮),
*—*where *àn* means massage, and *jì* (跻) refers to the nimble movements of hands and feet, as in *dǎoyǐn* (导引)—
then disturbing the sinews and bones causes *yángqi* not to be stored.
Spring’s *yángqi* ascends, overburdening the lungs, which connect to the nose, and disease manifests.
Thus, winter’s failure to practice *ànjì* leads to spring’s *guǐniǔ*.

*Guǐ* means nasal discharge, *niǔ* means nasal bleeding.
*Zhān* (跚) is pronounced *qiáo*.

If spring does not cause neck and nape disease,
mid-summer does not cause chest and rib disease,
long summer does not cause *dòngxiè* and cold in the abdomen,
autumn does not cause wind-*yuè*,
and winter does not cause *bìjué*—
then there will be *sūnxiè* (飧泄) with sweating.
These five preceding sentences all result from failing to practice *ànjì* in winter.

**Newly corrected text:** The phrase *"sūnxiè ér hànchū"* (飧泄而汗出) seems extraneous above.

Essence is the foundation of the body.
Thus, those who store essence in winter will not suffer from spring *wēnbìng* (温病).
This directly means that if winter’s *ànjiāo* preserves *jīngqi*, *yáng* does not ascend recklessly, so spring has no *wēnbìng*.

If summer heat causes no sweating, autumn will bring wind-*yuè*.
This directly means that wind and cold *qi* break summer’s sweat.

**Newly corrected text:** The meaning below does not connect well with the preceding text.

This is the pulse law of the *píngrén* (平人).
It refers to the pulse law of the *píngbìngrén* (平病人).
Thus it is said: *"Within yin there is yin, within yang there is yang."*
This refers to their initial emergence and their reign.

In daylight until noon, the heavens are *yáng*—this is *yáng* within *yáng*;
From noon until dusk, the heavens are *yáng*—this is *yín* within *yáng*.
At noon, *yáng* is at its peak, hence *yáng* within *yáng*.
At dusk, *yín* is at its peak, hence *yáng* within *yín*.
Since *yángqi* governs the day, from dawn until dusk is all the heavens’ *yáng*, yet within it there are distinctions of *yín* and *yáng*.

From night until the rooster crows, the heavens are *yín*—this is *yín* within *yín*;
From the rooster’s crow until dawn, the heavens are *yín*—this is *yáng* within *yín*.
At the rooster’s crow, *yángqi* has not yet emerged, hence the heavens are *yín*.
At dawn, *yángqi* has already ascended, hence *yáng* within *yín*.

Thus, the human body follows this pattern.
When speaking of human *yín-yáng*, the exterior is *yáng*, the interior is *yín*.
When speaking of the *yín-yáng* of the human body, the back is *yáng*, the abdomen is *yín*.
When speaking of the *yín-yáng* of the *Zàngfǔ* within the body, the *Zàng* are *yín*, the *fǔ* are *yáng*.
*Zàng* refers to the five *shén* (神) organs.
*Fǔ* refers to the six *huàfǔ* (化府).
The liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys—the five *Zàng*—are all *yín*.
The gallbladder, stomach, large intestine, small intestine, bladder, and triple burner—the six *fǔ*—are all *yáng*.

The *Língpǔ Jīng* states: The Triple Burner#1 overlaps above with the Hand *Shǒuxīn* (Hand Heart) Master.

It also says: The foot Triple Burner is another name for *Tàiyáng* (Major Yang).

The *Zhènglǐ Lùn* states: The Triple Burner#1 is a named entity without form, overlapping above with the Hand *Shǒuxīn* Master and below with the right kidney. It governs the *yèdào* (conveying) *qi*, and is called the *Shǐzhě* (Messenger).

Thus, why does one seek to know *yín* within *yín* and *yáng* within *yáng*? Because winter illnesses reside in *yín*, summer illnesses in *yáng*, spring illnesses in *yín*, and autumn illnesses in *yáng*—all are observed in their respective locations for the application of acupuncture and *shíliàn* (stone therapy).

The back is *yáng*, and within *yáng* is the *yáng* organ—the heart.
The heart is a *yáng* organ, situated in the upper burner, with *yáng* dwelling in *yáng*, hence it is called *yáng* within *yáng*.
The *Língpǔ Jīng* states: The heart is the *mǔ*#2 organ.
*Mǔ* means *yáng*.

The back is *yáng*, and within *yáng* is the *yín* organ—the lungs.
The lungs are a *yín* organ, situated in the upper burner, with *yín* dwelling in *yáng*, hence they are called *yín* within *yáng*.
The *Língpǔ Jīng* states: The lungs are the *pín*#3 organ.
*Pín* means *yín*.

The abdomen is *yín*, and within *yín* is the *yín* organ—the kidneys.
The kidneys are a *yín* organ, situated in the lower burner, with *yín* dwelling in *yín*, hence they are called *yín* within *yín*.
The *Língpǔ Jīng* states: The kidneys are the *pín* organ.
*Pín* means *yín*.

The abdomen is *yín*, and within *yín* is the *yín* of the utmost *yín*—the spleen.
The spleen is the *kuò* (embracing) organ, situated in the middle burner, with *Tàiyín* (Major Yin) dwelling in *yín*, hence it is called *yín* of the utmost *yín* within *yín*.
The *Língpǔ Jīng* states: The spleen is the *pín*#4 organ of *jié* (截).
*Pín* means *yín*.

These are all the mutual correspondences of *yín-yáng*, superficial-deep, interior-exterior, and male-female, hence they align with the *yín-yáng* of the heavens.
Their *qi* and forms correspond harmoniously, thus they can align above with the heavens.

The Emperor#5 asked: Do the five organs correspond with the four seasons, and each has its own *shōushòu* (receiving) function?
*Guībó* (Master Gui) replied: They do.
The east is green, entering through the liver, opening at the orifices of the eyes, storing *jīng* (essence) in the liver.
*Jīng* refers to *jīngqi* (essence-*qi*).
The *qi* of the wood essence is the spirit and soul, the season of ascending *yáng*, with the eyes as its function, hence it opens at the eyes.
Its illnesses manifest as *jīnghè* (startle and terror),
symbolizing the bending and stretching of wood with its tremulous motion.
○Newly corrected version: Upon examining the east, it is said that the illness manifests as *jīnghè*; the other seasons are omitted, following the *Wǔcháng Zhèngdà Lùn* (Grand Treatise on the Five Constants) where it records *jīnghè* as the manifestation. This text is likely superfluous.
Its flavor is sour, its nature akin to grasses and trees.

Its nature is soft, brittle, and capable of bending and straightening.
Its domesticated animal is the rooster, taken from *xùn* (docility), as the *Yì* says: *"Xùn"* is the falcon.
Its grain is wheat, the longest of the five grains, hence its use in the *Shù* region.
*The Běn Cǎo* states: "Wheat is the longest of the five grains."
○Newly corrected version: According to the *Wǔcháng Zhèngdà Lùn*, it states: "Its domesticated animal is the dog, its grain is hemp." Its correspondence to the four seasons is the Great Year Star, the refined *qi* of wood, which governs the Great Year Star, completing a celestial cycle in twelve years.
Thus, the *qi* of spring resides in the head, as all things flourish above, hence the *qi* of spring resides in the head.
○Newly corrected version: The *Shù* region specifies that the *qi* of spring resides in the head, not stating "thus the illness is in the head," while other regions state "thus the illness is in [a certain organ]," employing parallel structure.

Its tone is *jiǎo* (the fifth musical note), for *jiǎo* is the sound of wood.
In the first month of spring, the pitch pipe is *Tàizhù*, generated by *Línzhōng*, with a length of eight inches, increased by one-third.
In the second month of spring, the pitch pipe is *Jiāzhōng*, generated by *Yízé*, with a length of seven inches and five *fēn* (sub-units).
○Newly corrected version: According to Zhēng Xīngchéng, it is seven inches, two thousand seven hundred eighty-seven *fēn*, with an additional seven hundred seventy-five *fēn*.
In the third month of spring, the pitch pipe is *Gūxǐ*, generated by *Nánlǚ*, with a length of seven inches and ten *fēn*.
○Newly corrected version: According to Zhēng Xīngchéng, it is nine *fēn* per inch.
These three pipes all correspond to the original *qi*.
Its number is eight, for wood generates the number three, completing to eight.
*The Shàngshū Hóngfàn* states: "Three is wood."
Thus, it is known that illness resides in the sinews, for the firmness and softness of wood resembles the *qi* of sinews.
Its odor is pungent.
The *qi* of wood, when transformed, becomes restless.
○Newly corrected version: The *Yuèlìng* records "pungent" as *shàn* (aromatic).

The south is red, entering through the heart, opening at the ears, storing *jīng* in the heart.
The *qi* of fire essence is the spirit of the spirit, the tongue being the heart’s organ—though it should be said "the tongue," the tongue is not an orifice, hence it is said "ears."
*The Miǔ Cì Lùn* states: "The collateral of the hand’s *shǎo yīn* converges in the ear."
This meaning is taken from here.
Thus, illness resides in the five *zàng* (viscera),

With summer *qi* residing in the viscera,
Its flavor is bitter, its kindred is fire,
Its nature is flaming upward, scorching and searing.
Its livestock is sheep—
*"Sheep"* as livestock, for it is yet incomplete.
With earth as the sovereign, thus broadly speaking.
○Newly corrected version: According to *The Great Treatise on the Five Constants*, "Its livestock is horses."

Its grain is millet—
Millet’s hue is red,
Its correspondence to the seasons:
Above, it manifests as the Wandering Star,
The refined *qi* of fire ascending—
Above, it manifests as the Wandering Star,
completing a celestial circuit in 740 days.
Thus, it is known that illness resides in the vessels,
For fire’s restless agitation resembles the *qi* of swine.
Its tone is *zhēng*—
*Zhēng*, the voice of fire.
In early summer, the pitch pipe is *Zhònglǚ*,
Generated by *Wúshè*, three parts plus one-third,
Tube length: six inches and seven divisions.
○Newly corrected version: According to Zhēng Kāngchéng: six inches, nine thousand six hundred eighty-three divisions, with twelve thousand nine hundred seventy-four as the unit.

In mid-summer, the pitch pipe is *Kuíbīn*,
Generated by *Yīngzhōng*, three parts plus one-third,
Tube length: six inches and three divisions.
○Newly corrected version: According to Zhēng Kāngchéng: six inches, eighty-one divisions, with twenty-six as the unit.

In late summer, the pitch pipe is *Línzhōng*,
Generated by *Huángzhōng*, three parts plus one-third,
Tube length: six inches.
All three tubes correspond to the *qi* of fire.

Its number is seven—
Fire generates the number two, completing the number seven.
*The Shàngshū Hóngfàn* states: "Two is fire."
Its odor is burnt.
The *qi*, when transformed by fire, becomes burnt.
Central yellow, entering through the spleen,
Opening at the mouth, storing *jīng* in the spleen,
The refined *qi* of earth is the spirit of intent—
The spleen governs the transformation of grains,
The mouth governs receiving nourishment,
Thus, it opens at the mouth.
Hence, illness resides at the root of the tongue,
For the spleen’s *tún* ascends to the root of the tongue,
Thus, the pathogenic *qi* settles there.
Its flavor is sweet, its kindred is earth,
Its nature is tranquil and transformative.

Its livestock is the ox—
Earth reigns over the four seasons, so it takes the *chǒu* (丑, the second earthly branch) ox, and also because the ox’s color is yellow.

Its grain is millet—
Millet is yellow in color and sweet in flavor.

Its correspondence to the four seasons is the **Zhèn** (鎮, "settling") star,
The refined *qi* of earth ascends as the **Zhèn** star, completing a **wǔshíqiūtiān** (五十六年, "56-year celestial cycle") in one revolution.

Thus, it is known that illness resides in the flesh—
Earth’s yielding and thick nature aligns with the *qi* of flesh.

Its tone is **gōng** (宮, "the pentatone"),
The **gōng** tone is the voice of earth.
The *Lǜshū* (律書, "Classical Music Treatise") designates **Huángzhōng** (黃鐘, "Yellow Bell") as the **zhuó gōng** (浊宮, "muddy pentatone"), and **Línzhōng** (林鐘, "Forest Bell") as the **qīng gōng** (清宮, "clear pentatone"), for **Línzhōng** governs the pipes of the sixth month.
The five tones regard **gōng** as primary, with the **lǜ-lǚ** (律吕, "classical pitch and rhythm") initially emerging from **Huángzhōng** as the **zhuó gōng**, and **Línzhōng** as the **qīng gōng**.

Its number is five—
Earth’s number is five. The *Shàngshū Hóngfàn* (尚书洪范) states: "Five is earth."

Its odor is fragrant—
The *qi*, when transformed by earth, becomes fragrant.

---
To the west, white color,
Entering through the lungs, opening at the nose,
The lungs—
The refined *qi* of metal is the spirit of the **pò** (魄, "etheric soul"), for the lungs store *qi*, and the nose governs breathing, hence it opens at the nose.

Thus, illness resides in the back—
The lungs are positioned in the chest, and the back serves as the chest’s **fǔ** (府, "granary/abode").

Its flavor is pungent, its kindred is metal,
Its nature is resonant and firm.

Its **livestock is the horse**—
Livestock of the horse is taken from **Qián** (乾, "the Creative/Heaven"). The *Yì* (易, *I Ching*) says: "Qián is the horse."
○The *Xīnjiào Zhèngyún* (新校正, "Newly Revised Edition") states: According to the *Wǔ Cháng Zhèngdà Lùn* (五常政大论, "Treatise on the Five Constants and Their Grand Governance"), its **livestock is the falcon** (鹞).

Its **grain is rice**—
Rice is firm and white.

Its **correspondence with the four seasons** is the **Tàibái Star** (太白星, "Great White Star").
The refined *qi* of metal ascends as the **Tàibái Star**, completing a cycle in **365 days**.
Hence, one knows that illness resides in the **skin and fur**—
The firm and dense nature of metal aligns with the **skin and fur**.
Its **sound is shāng** (商, "the fifth musical note").
In the **Mèngqiū** (孟秋, "early autumn") month, the **lǜ-lǚ** (律吕) follows the **Yízé** (夷则, "Even Pitch") standard, generated by **Dàlǚ** (大吕, "Great Lǚ"), with a ratio of **two parts shāng to one part yīn** (吟). The **guǎn** (管, "bamboo flute") measures **5 inches 7 divisions** in length.

In the **Zhòngqiū** (仲秋, "mid-autumn") month, the **lǜ-lǚ** follows the **Nánlǚ** (南吕, "Southern Lǚ") standard, generated by **Tàizǔ** (太簇, "Great Cluster"), with a ratio of **three parts shāng to one part yīn**. The **guǎn** measures **5 inches 3 divisions** in length.

In the **Jìqiū** (季秋, "late autumn") month, the **lǜ-lǚ** follows the **Wúshè** (无射, "No Projection") standard, generated by **Jiázhōng** (夹钟, "Intermediate Bell"), with a ratio of **three parts shāng to one part yīn**. The **guǎn** measures **5 inches** in length.
These are the **three flutes**, all responding to the *qi* of metal.

Its number is **nine**—
Metal generates the number **four**, completing the number **nine**.
The *Shàngshū Hóngfàn* states: "Four is metal."

Its odor is **stinky**—
The *qi*, when transformed by metal, becomes the **ranid** (腥膻, "stinky and malodorous") *qi*.

To the **north, black color**,
Entering through the **kidneys**, opening at the **two yīn** (二阴, "two private orifices"),
Storing **jīng** (精, "essence") in the kidneys—
The refined *qi* of water is the **spirit of the zhì** (志, "will/volitional soul"), for the kidneys store essence, and the private orifices govern its discharge, hence it opens at the **two yīn**.
Thus, illness resides in the **drainage channels**—
The **drainage channels** (溪) refer to the **small gatherings of flesh** (肉之小会).
The *Qì Xuē Lùn* (气穴论, "Treatise on the *Qi* and Orifices") states: "The grand gathering of flesh is the **gǔ** (谷, 'valley'), the small gathering of flesh is the **drainage channels**."

Its flavor is **salty**, its kindred is **water**,
Its nature is **moist and downward**, permeating like **seepage**.

Its **livestock is the wild boar** (蠡, *jīng* 豕).
Its **grain is beans**—
Livestock of the **wild boar** (竞, *jīng* 豕) refers to the wild boar.
Grain of the **beans** (豆) refers to their black color.

Its **correspondence with the four seasons** is the **Chén Star** (辰星, "Morning Star").
The refined *qi* of water ascends as the **Chén Star**, completing a cycle in **365 days**.

Thus it is known that disease resides in the **bones**—
The bones govern **obscurity and darkness**, their substance concealed within,
By affinity they align, hence disease lodges in the bones.

Its **sound is *yǔ*** (羽),
For *yǔ* is the sound of **water**.

In the **first month of winter** (孟冬),
The **pitchpipe** resonates with *Zhōngzhōng* (钟),
Born of *Gūxǐ* (姑洗),
With a length of **4 inches and 7½ divisions** (三分喊一),
The **bamboo pipe** measures **4.75 units**.

In the **second month of winter** (仲冬),
The pitchpipe resonates with *Huángzhōng* (黄钟),
Born of *Zhònglǚ* (仲吕),
With an added **third part** (三分益一),
The **bamboo pipe** measures **9 units**.

In the **third month of winter** (季冬),
The pitchpipe resonates with *Dàlǚ* (大吕),
Born of *Diànbīn* (奠宾),
With an added **third part** (三分益一),
The **bamboo pipe** measures **8.4 units**.

These three pipes all correspond to **water qi**.

Its **number is six**—
Water generates the number **one**, completing the cycle at **six**.
The *Shàngshū Hóngfàn* (尚书洪范) states: **"One is water."**

Its **odor is rotten**.
When *qi* follows water, it transforms into the **stench of decay**.

Thus, the skilled pulse-taker must carefully examine the **Five Zàng** and **Six Fǔ**,
Observing **inversion and compliance**, the **principles of yin and yang, exterior and interior, female and male**,
Holding it in mind with intent,
Uniting heart with **essence**—
When the heart aligns with the subtle essence,
Then one deeply comprehends **adaptation and transformation**.

Teach not the unworthy, instruct not the insincere—
This is called **attaining the Dao**.

Adapt to their capacity and impart knowledge—
This is called **mastery in teaching and transmission**.

The *Língshū Jīng* (灵枢经) states:
Those with **keen vision** may be taught to **discern colors**,
Those with **acute hearing** may be taught to **perceive sounds**,
Those with **quick and eloquent speech** may be taught to **articulate discourse**,
Those who are **slow, tranquil, and deft-handed**, with **discerning minds**,
May be taught to **wield needles and moxa**,
To **regulate blood and *qi***, adjusting **disorders and inversions**,
To **discern yin and yang** while encompassing **all directions**,
To **relax joints and tendons with gentle movements**, harmonizing the mind—
These may be taught **guiding and breathing exercises**.

Those who are **light of speech, scornful of others, or prone to malice**,
May be taught to **spit and incant over illnesses**.

Those whose **nails are brittle, hands prone to injury, or who endure suffering**,
May be taught to **press accumulations and relieve stagnation**.

Thus, each finds their **aptitude**—
Only then may the method be applied, and their **name be renowned**.

Hence it is said:
**"Teach not the unworthy, instruct not the insincere."**

**Discourse on the Great Correspondences of Yin and Yang**

The Yellow Emperor said: "Yin and Yang are the **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth, referring to the **Dao/Way** of transformation and generation. The *Lǎozǐ* (Laozi) states: 'All things bear Yin and embrace Yang, blending **qi** to achieve harmony.' The *Yì Jìng* (Systematic Commentary of the *Yì*) says: 'One Yin and one Yang constitute the **Dao/Way**.' This is what is meant.

The fundamental principles of all things, the means of their growth and flourishing, are governed by Yin and Yang. Yang provides them with vital **qi** to generate life, while Yin sustains and establishes them, hence they are the fundamental principles of all things. The *Discourse on the Separation and Combination of Yin and Yang* states: 'Yang provides the essential **virtue/power**, Yin governs the foundation.' This is also what is meant.

Yin and Yang are the origins of transformation and generation, the mechanisms by which different species arise. How so? For instance, the eagle transforms into the dove, the field mouse into the mole, rotting grass into the firefly, the sparrow entering deep water becomes a clam#1, the pheasant entering deep water becomes a *shèn* (sea monster or mirage)#2—these are all cases where distinct species emerge through transformation and generation.

The source of life and death, the operation of cold and heat, are rooted in Yin and Yang. All things rely on Yang **qi** for warmth to grow and on Yin **qi** for coldness to perish; thus, one understands that the origins of life and death lie in the interplay of Yin and Yang. This is the realm of **divine wisdom**.

'Realm' here means the **official** domain. Why does the **divine wisdom** reside within the myriad transformations of life and death? Because it governs all these processes. The following passage states: 'The movements and stillness of Heaven and Earth are governed by **divine wisdom**.' Hence, the *Yì Jìng* says: 'Yin and Yang, unfathomable, are called **divine wisdom**.' This also refers to its governance.

**Newly collated annotations** state: 'Examine the profound **Dao/Way** of Yin and Yang in the **realm of divine wisdom**, which aligns with the *Great Discourse on the Heavenly Elements*, though the commentaries differ.'

In treating diseases, one must seek their roots. Just as Yin and Yang govern the life and death, transformation, and generation of all things, so too do they operate within the human body, interwoven and interacting. Thus, the **Dao/Way** of treating diseases must first investigate these principles.

Hence, accumulated Yang forms Heaven, accumulated Yin forms Earth. Why does one say that Yin and Yang are the **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth? Because Yin is still and Yang is turbulent—this describes their standard functions in response to all things. Yang generates life, Yin sustains growth; Yang brings death, Yin conceals decay. This clarifies the distinct roles of Heaven and Earth in life and death.

Shénnóng (Shennong) said: 'Heaven uses Yang to generate and Yin to sustain growth; Earth employs Yang to bring death and Yin to conceal decay.'

**Newly collated annotations** state: 'Examine the meaning of Yin sustaining growth and Yang bringing death—some may find this confusing.' Referring to the *Zhōuyì* (Book of Changes) and its arrangement of the Eight Trigrams in the four directions, one can see the explanation. *Kūn* (坤) is Yin, located at the southwest corner, corresponding to the transition between the sixth and seventh months, when all things flourish and grow. How could one say there is no principle of Yin sustaining growth? *Qián* (乾) is Yang, positioned in the *xū* (戌) and *hài* (亥) sectors, corresponding to the transition between the ninth and tenth months, when all things are reaped and perish. Who would say there is no principle of Yang bringing death? Thus, it is clear: the principles of Yin sustaining growth and Yang bringing death are evident.

Yang transforms into **qi**, Yin solidifies into form. This clarifies the fundamental principles of all things' growth.

Extreme cold generates heat; extreme heat generates cold. This illustrates the overarching pattern.

Cold **qi** produces turbidity, heat **qi** produces clarity—referring to the vital **qi**. When clear **qi** lingers below, it causes *fànxiè* (diarrhea); when turbid **qi** accumulates above, it causes *zhènzhàng* (abdominal distension). When heat **qi** lingers below, food does not digest, hence *fànxiè*. When cold **qi** accumulates above, **qi** does not disperse, hence *zhènzhàng*. Why? Because Yin is still while Yang is turbulent.

*Zhèn* (镇), pronounced *Chángzhēn* (昌真), means abdominal distension.

This is the reversal of Yin and Yang, the disease's deviation from the norm. 'Reversal' means fluctuation; 'deviation' means abnormal activity. Fluctuation and abnormal activity lead to such diseases.

Hence, clear Yang corresponds to Heaven, turbid Yin to Earth; Earth **qi** rises to form clouds, Heaven **qi** descends as rain. Rain originates from Earth **qi**, clouds from Heaven **qi**. When Yin condenses and rises, it coalesces to form clouds; when Yang disperses and flows downward, it descends as rain. Rain falls from clouds to nourish and transform, hence it is said that rain comes from Earth. Clouds form through the convergence of **qi**, hence it is said that clouds come from Heaven. The principles of Heaven and Earth operate thus, and the clear and turbid **qi** within the human body follow the same pattern.

Thus, clear Yang emanates from the upper orifices, turbid Yin from the lower orifices; **qi** originating from Heaven is drawn upward, **qi** originating from Earth is drawn downward, each following its kind.

The upper orifices refer to the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth. The lower orifices refer to the anterior and posterior *yīn* (private parts).

Clear Yang disperses through the pores, turbid Yin circulates within the five *zàng* (viscera). The pores are pathways for **qi** to permeate, hence clear Yang can disperse through them. The five *zàng* are the repositories of the viscera, hence turbid Yin can circulate within them.

Clear Yang nourishes the four limbs, turbid Yin returns to the six *fǔ* (entrails). The four limbs are external and active, hence clear Yang nourishes them. The six *fǔ* are internal and transformative, hence turbid Yin returns to them.

Water is Yin, fire is Yang. Water is cold and still, hence it is Yin. Fire is hot and turbulent, hence it is Yang.

Yang corresponds to **qi**, Yin to flavor. **Qi** is only dispersed and distributed, hence Yang is associated with it. Flavor is derived from form, hence Yin is associated with it.

Flavor belongs to form, form to **qi**, **qi** to essence, essence to transformation. Form consumes flavor, hence flavor belongs to form. **Qi** nourishes form, hence form belongs to **qi**. Essence consumes **qi**, hence **qi**#5 belongs to essence. Transformation generates essence, hence essence belongs to transformation.

Thus, the following passage states: 'Essence consumes **qi**, form consumes flavor. When **qi** transforms, essence is generated; when flavor harmonizes, form grows, hence it is said that they consume each other.'

Transformation generates essence, **qi** generates form. The subtle essence of blood is formed solely through transformation, while the physical substance of the body relies on **qi** for circulation and establishment, hence these two aspects each originate from their respective sources.

Flavor harms form, **qi** harms essence—this is when they exceed their proper limits. Essence transforms into **qi**, **qi** is harmed by excess flavor.

Essence receives nourishment through transformation, then it consumes **qi**; if essence is generated through transformation, then it does not consume **qi**.

When essence and blood congeal internally, they stagnate and become putrid, attacking the stomach, then the five flavors are rejected and cannot enter.

For women in late pregnancy, as essence transforms, all one hundred days are marked by harm from flavor.

Yin flavor emanates from the lower orifices; Yang **qi** emanates from the upper orifices.

Flavor has substance, so it descends through the excretory orifices.
**Qi** has no form, so it ascends through the respiratory passages.

Thick flavor is Yin; thin flavor is the Yang of Yin.
Thick **qi** is Yang; thin **qi** is the Yin of Yang.
Thus, thick **qi** is pure Yang, and thick flavor is pure Yin.

Therefore, thin flavor is Yin within Yang, and thin **qi** is Yang within Yin.
Thick flavor causes leakage; thin flavor promotes smooth flow.
Thin **qi** causes leakage and sweating; thick **qi** causes heat.

Yin **qi** moistens downward, so thick flavor causes leakage.
Yang **qi** ascends fiercely, so thick **qi** causes heat.

Thin flavor indicates Yin deficiency, hence leakage.
Thin **qi** indicates Yang deficiency, hence sweating.
"Leakage" refers to sweating.

Excessive Yang fire weakens; deficient Yang fire strengthens.
When Yang fire is excessive, it strengthens yet also weakens.
When Yang fire is deficient, it weakens yet then strengthens.
Excessive Yang fire consumes **qi**; **qi** nourishes deficient Yang fire.
Excessive Yang fire dissipates **qi**; deficient Yang fire generates **qi**.
**Qi** generates excessive Yang fire, hence it is said that "excessive Yang fire consumes **qi**."
Deficient Yang fire nourishes **qi**, hence it is said that "**qi** nourishes deficient Yang fire."
Because excessive Yang fire consumes **qi**, **qi** obtains excessive Yang fire and is dissipated.
Because deficient Yang fire nourishes **qi**, **qi** obtains deficient Yang fire and grows.

Thus, it is also true for humans when Yang **qi** is excessive or deficient.
**Qi** and flavor of pungent and sweet nature disperse and ascend as Yang; sour and bitter flavors surge and leak as Yin.

Not only do **qi** and flavor distinguish proper Yin and Yang, but within pungent, sweet, sour, and bitter, there are also differences in their Yin and Yang **qi**.

How so?
Pungent disperses, sweet relaxes—hence, they disperse and ascend as Yang.
Sour contracts, bitter leaks—hence, they surge and leak as Yin.

When Yin prevails, Yang falls ill; when Yang prevails, Yin falls ill.
Prevailing does not cause illness; failing to prevail causes illness.
Yang prevailing causes heat; Yin prevailing causes cold.
This is when extremes lead to such outcomes.
○The newly corrected version states: According to the *Jia Yi Jing* (甲乙经), Yin illness causes heat, Yang illness causes cold. The wording differs, but the meaning is the same.

Excessive cold causes heat; excessive heat causes cold.
Things pushed to extremes reverse—just as excessive Yang fire weakens and deficient Yang fire strengthens.
Cold harms form; heat harms **qi**.
Cold impairs the defensive **qi**, hence it harms form.
Heat consumes the nutritive **qi** internally, hence it harms **qi**.

Though Yin forms the body and Yang transforms **qi**, when either exceeds its proper limits, form and **qi** are disrupted and destroyed.
#6 **Qi** injury causes pain; form injury causes swelling.
When **qi** is injured, heat congeals in the flesh, causing pain.
When form is injured, cold permeates the skin, causing swelling.
Hence, when there is first pain followed by swelling, it is **qi** injuring form; when there is first swelling followed by pain, it is form injuring **qi**.

When symptoms of **qi** injury precede and affect form, it is said that "**qi** injures form."
When symptoms of form injury precede and affect **qi**, it is said that "form injures **qi**."

When wind prevails, it causes movement.
When wind prevails, all things tremble, hence it is called movement.
○The newly corrected version states: According to the *Zuo Zhuan* (左传), it says: "Wind rampant brings on terminal illnesses." This aligns with the same meaning.

When heat prevails, it causes swelling.
When heat prevails, Yang **qi** stagnates internally, hence violent swelling occurs. In severe cases, nutritive **qi** reverses in the flesh, gathering into abscesses or boils.

When dryness prevails, it causes dryness.
When dryness prevails, fluids are depleted, hence the skin becomes parched and dry.

When cold prevails, it causes levitation.
When cold prevails, Yin **qi** congeals in the hidden chambers, sealing them tightly, and Yang **qi** attacks internally, hence it causes levitation.

When dampness prevails, it causes dampness and leakage.
When dampness prevails, it attacks the spleen and stomach internally. The spleen and stomach, receiving dampness, fail to distinguish between water and grain. As water and grain harmonize, the large intestine transmits and discharges them. Due to internal dampness overwhelming the discharge, it is called dampness and leakage.
○The newly corrected version states: According to the *Zuo Zhuan* (左传), it says: "Rain rampant brings on abdominal illnesses." This aligns with the same meaning.

The five sentences on wind prevailing and causing movement are identical to those in the *Liu Yuan Zheng Ji Da Lun* (六元正纪大论). The commentary there is quite detailed.

Heaven has the four seasons and five phases, generating, growing, harvesting, and storing, producing cold, heat, dryness, dampness, and wind.
Spring generates, summer grows, autumn harvests, winter stores—this refers to the four seasons' generating, growing, harvesting, and storing.
Winter water brings cold, summer fire brings heat, autumn metal brings dryness, spring wood brings wind, and late summer earth brings dampness—this refers to the five phases' cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and wind.

However, the **qi** of the four seasons, though earth may temporarily reign, originates from their respective domains. Thus, dampness belongs to the center, so it is said that the five phases generate the five **qi** of cold, heat, dryness, dampness, and wind.

Humans have the five viscera transforming the five **qi**, generating joy, anger, pensiveness, worry, and fear.
The five viscera refer to the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys.
The five **qi** refer to joy, anger, pensiveness, worry, and fear.

However, these five emotions further harm the harmonious **qi** of the five viscera.
○The newly corrected version states: According to the *Tian Yuan Ji Da Lun* (天元纪大论), "pensiveness" is written as "sorrow."
Additionally, in the following passage of this text, the liver governs anger, the heart governs joy, the spleen governs pensiveness, the lungs govern worry, and the kidneys govern fear.
The *Yu Ji Zhen Zang Lun* (玉机真藏论) writes "sorrow."
The various commentaries differ.

Huangfu Shian (皇甫士安) in the *Jia Yi Jing Jing Shen Wu Zang Pian* (甲乙经精神五藏篇) provides his own interpretation.
It is said that sorrow can overcome anger, taking the five emotions as sequentially counteracting each other.

Using pensiveness instead, as pensiveness is the spleen’s emotion, neither interpretation fully suffices alone, but both complement each other.

Thus, joy and anger harm **qi**; cold and heat harm form.
The origins of joy and anger all stem from **qi**, hence it is said that "joy and anger harm **qi**."

The effects of cold and heat prevail where they harm the **form**, hence it is said, *"cold and heat harm form."*

Taking it from the nearby examples, it is as such.

Speaking in detail, heat harms **qi**, while cold harms the **form**.

Sudden rage injures *yin*, and excessive joy injures *yang*.
Anger causes **qi** to rise, while joy causes **qi** to descend—thus, sudden **qi** rising injures *yin*, and sudden **qi** descending injures *yang*.

When *jue*-**qi** ascends, it fills the vessels and departs from the **form**.
*Jue*-**qi** is perverse.
When perverse **qi** ascends and fills the meridians, the spirit-**qi** becomes agitated and detached, leaving the corporeal frame.

If joy and anger are unregulated, and cold and heat are excessive, life then becomes unstable.
The *Ling Shu Jing* states:
*"The wise in nurturing life harmonize with the four seasons, adapting to cold and heat, balancing joy and anger, and dwelling in tranquility.*
Yet if joy and anger are inconsistent, and cold and heat are excessive, the innate *True Qi* cannot endure long.
Thus, excessive *yin* must yield to *yang*, and excessive *yang* must yield to *yin*—just as with injuries from cold and heat.

Hence it is said:
*"Winter injury from cold will bring spring fever.*
Injury from the four seasonal **qi** can all become illnesses, but cold injury is the most pernicious and lethal **qi**; when it strikes, disease follows immediately. Thus, it is called *injury from cold*. If the illness does not manifest immediately, the cold poison lingers in the flesh, transforming into spring fever and, in summer, into summer-heat illness.
Therefore, those who nurture life must be cautious of injuries from pathogenic influences.

Spring injury from wind leads to summer diarrhea.
When wind invades the exterior, it internally affects the liver; the liver **qi** then overacts on the spleen, resulting in diarrhea.
*[New annotation:]* According to the *Sheng Qi Tong Tian Lun*, it states: *"Spring injury from wind, with lingering pathogenic **qi**, becomes chronic diarrhea."*

Summer injury from heat will bring autumn intermittent fever.
Summer heat is severe, and autumn’s heat lingers—two heats assaulting each other, hence intermittent fever.
*Intermittent* means emaciation.

Autumn injury from dampness leads to winter coughing.
Autumn dampness is abundant, and winter’s water **qi** reigns—water and dampness combine, while lung **qi** weakens, so severe winter cold results in coughing.
*[New annotation:]* According to the *Sheng Qi Tong Tian Lun*, it states: *"Autumn injury from dampness, ascending in reverse, causes coughing, manifesting as atrophy and sudden collapse."*

The Emperor said: *"I have heard that the ancient sages analyzed human form, categorized the viscera and palaces, delineated the meridians and collaterals, harmonized the six directions, and followed their respective pathways. The origins of **qi** and orifices all have designated names, valleys belonging to bones, and all have their sources. Their divisions—whether ascending or descending—follow clear principles. The four seasons’ *yin* and *yang* are all systematically arranged; the internal and external correspondences are all enveloped in their proper layers. Is this not true?"*

The Six Unions refer to the convergence of the twelve meridians. The *Ling Shu Jing* states: *"Taiyin and Yangming form one union, Shaoyin and Taiyang form one union, Jueyin and Shaoyang form one union. The three unions of the hands and feet make six unions in total."* The hand Jueyin is the pericardium#10 union.

The *Qi Xue Lun* states: *"The grand assembly of flesh is called a valley, the minor assembly of flesh is called a creek; the divisions of flesh, where creeks and valleys converge, serve to circulate the nourishing and defensive *qi* and gather the great *qi*. The places where bones connect are called bone junctions."* The external and internal correspondences are such that all the *yang* meridians are external, and all the *yin* meridians are internal.

---

The Emperor asked: *"Is this indeed so?"* The full text from the original *Sheng Qi Tong Tian Lun* and the *Tai Su* is included in the teachings of the ancient sages.

Gebi replied: *"When the southeast wind arises, the *yang* *qi* ascends and disperses as wind. Wind is the decree of Heaven, the first lesson of its teachings, hence it originates from the southeast. Wind generates wood; wind stirs the wood’s vitality, thus wind generates wood. Wood generates sourness; all sour flavors are produced by the *qi* of wood. The *Shan Shu Hong Fan* states: *‘Curved and straight produce sourness.’* Sourness generates the liver; ‘generate’ means to foster growth. All sour flavors first grow in the liver. The liver generates sinews; the refined *qi* of the liver nourishes the sinews. Sinews generate the heart. The *Yin Yang Shu* states: *‘Wood generates fire.’* Yet the wood *qi* of the liver, after internally nourishing the sinews, then generates the heart’s fire. The liver governs the eyes; the eyes see the bright sun, aligning with its kind. In Heaven, it manifests as the *Xuan* (the obscure); *Xuan* refers to the dark and distant, where Heaven’s hue is not yet fully luminous. In humans, it is the **Dao**; **Dao** refers to transformation through the **Way**, and people follow accordingly. On Earth, it is *Hua* (transformation); *Hua* refers to creation, nurturing all kinds in due season. Transformation generates the five flavors; all things born possess the five flavors, all arising from change as their mother, enabling their formation. The **Dao** generates wisdom; wisdom arises from correct transformation, hence the **Dao** generates wisdom. The *Xuan* generates spirit; within the obscure, spirit resides, hence the *Xuan* generates spirit.

Spirit in Heaven is wind; its use is to agitate and bend#11, yet it disperses far and wide, penetrating everywhere—truly, spirit’s transformation enables this. On Earth, it is wood; supple, curved, and straight, these are wood’s nature. In the body, it is sinews; binding and connecting, they provide strength. In the viscera, it is the liver; its spirit is the *hun* soul. The *Dao Jing Yi* states: *"The *hun* resides in the liver; when the *hun* is still, the **Dao** remains unperturbed."* In color, it is *cang* (a pale blue); *cang* symbolizes the hue of wood. In sound, it is *jiao* (the note of the pentatonic scale); *jiao* is the straight, resonant sound of wood. The *Lü Ji* states: *"When *jiao* is disordered, there is sorrow, and the people grieve."* In voice, it is the cry or whistle; a cry is also called a whistle. In motion, it is grasping; grasping is what draws and pulls. In orifices, it is the eyes; the eyes perceive forms and colors. In taste, it is sour; sourness is used for contraction. In emotion, it is anger; anger restrains wrongdoing. Anger harms the liver; though anger is the emotion, excessive anger harms oneself. Sorrow overcomes anger; sorrow overcomes anger because the lung’s metal assists the liver’s wood, thus subduing#13 anger. The *Xuan Ming Wu Zang Qi Pian* states: *"When refined *qi* converges in the lungs, sorrow arises."* Sadness, not grief, is used here, as prolonged grief injures the mind, while sorrow moves the *hun* soul, hence it is not called grief.

Wind harms sinews; when wind prevails, sinews and collaterals become rigid. Dryness overcomes wind; dryness is metal *qi*, thus subduing wood’s wind. Sourness harms sinews; sourness harms sinews through overstrain. Pungency overcomes sourness; pungency overcomes sourness because pungency is the metal flavor, thus subduing wood’s sourness.

The south generates heat; the *yang* *qi* blazes and scorches, thus generating heat. Heat generates fire; friction produces fire, and only heat can do so. Fire generates bitterness; all bitter flavors are produced by the *qi* of fire. The *Shan Shu Hong Fan* states: *"Flame above produces bitterness."* Bitterness generates the heart; all bitter flavors first grow in the heart. The heart generates blood; the refined *qi* of the heart nourishes the blood. Blood generates the spleen. The *Yin Yang Shu* states: *"Fire generates earth."* Yet the heart’s fire *qi*, after internally nourishing the blood, then generates the spleen’s earth.

The *Tai Su* states that blood should be *mai* (vessels). The heart governs the tongue; the heart discerns right and wrong, and the tongue speaks, hence it governs the tongue. In Heaven, it manifests as heat; scorching and intense, these are heat’s effects. On Earth, it is fire; blazing upward and consuming, these are fire’s nature. Its color is *zhe* (a reddish hue). In the body, it is the vessels; they circulate the nourishing and defensive *qi* and nourish the blood. In the viscera, it is the heart; its spirit is the *shen* spirit. The *Dao Jing Yi* states: *"The *shen* resides in the heart. When the *shen* is steadfast, the blood and *qi* flow smoothly."*

In **sound**, it is *zhēng* (a martial note),
*zhēng* being the **fire sound**—harmonious and beautiful.
The *Lè Jì* states: *"When *zhēng* is disordered, sorrow arises; its affairs are earnest."*

In **voice**, it is **laughter**,
**laughter**, the sound of **joy**.

In **change and movement**, it is **worry**,
**worry** can fulfill tasks.
○The newly corrected edition says:
Following Yang Shangshan’s account:
**The heart’s worry** lies in the heart’s restless movement,
**the lung’s worry** lies in the lung’s resolve.
Thus, the lung governs **autumn**, where **worry** is the norm,
while the heart governs **summer**, where **change** generates **worry**.

In **orifices**, it is the **tongue**,
the tongue, which governs the discernment of the **five flavors**.
The *Jīn Kuì Zhēn Yán Lùn* states:
*"The southern [direction]’s reddish hue enters and connects with the heart,
opening the orifice at the ears."*
Upon further inquiry, if it were the orifice,
the meaning of the tongue would diverge—
yet since it governs flavor,
it is called the tongue.

In **flavor**, it is **bitterness**;
in **will/intent**, it is **joy**.
**Bitterness** in flavor is useful for **drying and purging**;
**joy** in intent brings **harmony and delight**.
**Excessive joy** harms the heart—
though joy is its intent, extreme excess harms itself.
**Fear** overcomes joy;
**fear** causes the kidney’s water to converge with the heart’s fire,
thus overcoming joy.
The *Xuān Míng Wǔ Qì Piān* states:
*"When vital essence *qi* converges in the kidney, fear arises.*
**Heat** harms *qi*—
when heat prevails, **breathing becomes rapid and urgent**.
**Cold** overcomes heat—
cold is the *qi* of water, hence it overcomes fire’s heat.
**Bitterness** harms *qi*—
as it is generated by fire.
○The newly corrected edition says:
Examining this passage’s account of what harms, there are three patterns:
The *Shū Fāng* states:
*"Wind harms sinews, acidity harms sinews,
and the central [direction] states:
Humidity harms flesh, sweetness harms flesh—
these are cases of self-harm."*
The southern [direction] states:
*"Heat harms *qi*, bitterness harms *qi*—
this is harming what one has already overcome."*
The northern [direction] states:
*"Cold harms blood, saltiness harms blood—
this is harming what one has already overcome."*
The western [direction] states:
*"Heat harms skin and fur—
this is being harmed by what one has overcome,
while pungency harms skin and fur—
these are cases of self-harm."*
These five directions’ accounts of harm
display three distinct patterns.
The *Tai Su* uniformly states **self-harm**.
**Saltiness** overcomes **bitterness**;
saltiness, the flavor of water,
thus overcomes fire’s bitterness.

**Humidity** generates **earth**,
when earth is humid, it solidifies—
thus, **humidity** generates **earth**.
The newly corrected edition says:
Following Yang Shangshan’s account:
*"Four yin and two yang converge to produce humidity,
steaming and rotting all things to form earth."*

**Earth** generates **sweetness**,
all things’ flavors of **sweetness**
are born from earth’s *qi*.
The *Shàng Shū Hóng Fàn* states:
*"Cultivation and harvest yield sweetness."*

**Sweetness** generates the **spleen**,
sweetness generates the spleen—
all sweet flavors first flourish in the spleen.
The spleen generates **flesh**,
the spleen generates flesh—
the spleen’s vital essence *qi*
nourishes and grows the flesh.

**Flesh** generates the **lungs**,
the flesh generates the lungs—
as the *Yīn Yáng Shū* states:
*"Earth generates metal (gold)."*
Yet the spleen’s earthly *qi*,
after internally nourishing the flesh,
then generates the lung’s metallic (gold) nature.

The spleen governs the **mouth**.
The spleen receives water and grain,
the mouth ingests the five flavors—
hence it governs the mouth.

In Heaven, it manifests as **humidity**,
mist, dew, clouds, and rain—
these are humidity’s effects.
On Earth, it is **earth**,
calm and settled, yielding cultivation and harvest—
these are earth’s virtue/power.
In the body, it is **flesh**,
enveloping and filling sinews and bones,
completing its form.

In the **organs**, it is the **spleen**—
its spirit is **intention/intent** *yì*.
The *Dao Jīng Yì* states:
*"Intention rests in the spleen;
when intention is tranquil, wisdom does not stray."*

In **color**, it is **yellow**,
mirroring the earthly hue.
In **sound**, it is the **gong** tone—
the *gong* refers to the earthly sound,
great yet harmonious.
The *Lè Jì* says:
*"When the *gong* is disordered, it becomes chaotic,
and its ruler grows arrogant."*

In **voice**, it is **song**—
the *song* is the sighing sound.
In **movement**, it is **yawn**—
yawning and groaning arise
from the coldness of the stomach.
○The newly corrected version states:
*"According to Wang, yawn is *yànyī*, not *hǎn*—
*hǎn* is *hǎn* (aspiration),
*yawn* is *yī* (groan)."*
○The newly corrected version also notes:
*"According to Yang Shangshan: yawn is *hǎn*—
a gasping breath. *Hǎn* is pronounced *hǎn* (aspiration),
*yī* is pronounced *yī* (groan)."*

In **orifices**, it is the **mouth**—
the mouth, by which water and grain are taken in.
In **taste**, it is **sweet**—
sweetness is what can be used to moderate and relax.
In **will/emotion**, it is **thought**.
Thought enables one to know the distant.
Thought harms the spleen—
though will is thought,
excessive thought harms itself.
Anger overcomes thought;
anger prevents thought—
its supremacy is clear.

**Humidity** harms **flesh**,
for the spleen governs flesh yet detests humidity—
when humidity prevails, flesh is harmed.
**Wind** overcomes humidity;
wind is the *qi* of wood,
thus it overcomes earthly humidity.

**Sweet** harms **flesh**—
this too is excessive.
○The newly corrected version states:
*"According to the *Wǔ Yùn Xíng Dà Lùn*,
sweet harms the spleen.
Sour overcomes sweet.
Sour is the wood flavor,
thus it overcomes earthly sweet."*

The **West** generates **dryness**,
as Heaven’s *qi* is sharp and urgent—
thus dryness arises.

**Dryness** generates **metal**,
for metal’s dryness produces sound—
thus metal arises.

**Metal** generates **pungent**,
as the flavors of pungent things
all stem from metallic *qi*.
The *Shàng Shū Hóng Fàn* states:
*"From革 (*gé*, leather) comes pungent."*

**Pungent** generates the **lungs**,
as the flavors of pungent things
first grow and flourish in the lungs.
The lungs generate **skin and hair**,
the lungs’ vital essence *qi*
nourishes and grows skin and hair.
Skin and hair generate the **kidneys**,
as the *Yīn Yáng Shū* states:
*"Metal generates water."*
Yet the lungs’ metallic *qi*,
after nourishing skin and hair,
then generates the kidneys’ watery nature.

The lungs govern the **nose**.
The lungs store *qi*,
the nose regulates breathing—
thus they govern the nose.

In Heaven, it manifests as **dryness**,
light and urgent, strong and forceful—
these are dryness’ effects.

In Earth, it manifests as **metal**,
firm and strong, following leather—
this is metal’s nature.

In the body, it manifests as **skin and hair**,
enveloping and safeguarding the flesh,
warding off evil influences.

In the **viscera**, it is the **lungs**,
their **spirit-soul** (*pò*) residing there.
*The Daoist Classic on Meaning* states:
*"The spirit-soul resides in the lungs;
when the spirit-soul is at peace, virtue is cultivated and longevity extended."*

In color, it is **white**,
white being the likeness of metal’s hue.

In sound, it is **geng** (the fifth tone),
*geng* being the voice of metal—
light yet forceful.
*The Record of Music* states:
*"If *geng* is disordered, the officialdom collapses."*

In voice, it is **weeping**,
weeping being the sound of sorrow.

In transformation, it is **coughing**,
coughing meaning coughing and wheezing,
a means to clear the throat and pharynx.

In orifices, it is the **nose**,
the nose being what governs smell and breathing.

In flavor, it is **pungent**,
pungent being what can disperse and moisten.

In **intent**, it is **worry**,
worry being profound contemplation.
Worry harms the lungs—
though intent is worry, excess brings harm.
Joy overcomes worry;
joy causes the heart’s fire to join with lung metal,
thus overcoming worry.
*The Propagation of the Five Qi* states:
*"When vital essence converges in the heart, there is joy."*

Heat harms skin and hair,
heat arising from fire, consuming fluids.
Cold overcomes heat;
yin restrains yang.

*—Newly corrected note:*
According to *The Great Essentials*, it reads: *"Dryness harms skin and hair; heat overcomes dryness."*
Again, according to Wang’s annotation on *The Grand Treatise on the Five Movements*:
*"Fire has two distinctions, hence the repeated mention of heat’s injurious signs."*

Pungent harms skin and hair,
excess leading to damage.
Bitterness overcomes pungent;
bitterness being a fire flavor, thus overcoming metal’s pungency.

The **North** generates **cold**,
as yin *qi* congeals and intensifies,
thus generating cold.

Cold generates **water**,
as cold *qi* flourishes, congealing into water.

Water generates **saltiness**,
as all salty flavors stem from water’s *qi*.
*The Shàng Shū Hóng Fàn* states:
*"Moisture descending creates saltiness."*

Saltiness generates the **kidneys**,
as all salty flavors first grow and flourish in the kidneys.

The kidneys generate **bone marrow**,
as the kidneys’ vital essence *qi*
nourishes and grows bone marrow.

Bone marrow generates the **liver**,
as the *Yīn Yáng Shū* states:
*"Water generates wood."*
Yet the kidneys’ watery *qi*,
after nourishing bone marrow,
then generates the liver’s wooden nature.

The kidneys govern the **ears**,
the kidneys belonging to the North,
dwelling in darkness, thus hearing enters—
hence they govern the ears.

In Heaven, it manifests as **cold**,
congealed, clear, and severe—
these are cold’s effects.

On Earth, it manifests as **water**,
clear and pure, descending to moisten—
these are water’s functions.

In the body, it manifests as **bone**,
upright and steadfast, supporting the form—
thus establishing the self.

In the **viscera**, it is the **kidneys**,
where the **spirit-mind** (*shén*) resides.
*The Daoist Canon Interpretation* states:
*"The spirit-mind is stored in the kidneys."*
When the spirit-mind is cultivated,
bone marrow becomes full and solid.

In **color**, it is **black**,
mirroring water’s hue.

In **sound**, it is **羽 (yǔ)**—
the sound of water, deep and沉.
*The Record of Music* states:
*"When 羽 is disordered, danger arises—
its sound becomes exhausted."*

In **voice**, it is **verbalization (yīn)**—
a sighing, murmuring tone.

In **movement**, it is **shivering (lì)**—
shivering, as when extreme cold or terror
stirs the body’s tremors.

In the **orifices**, it is the **ears**,
through which the five tones are perceived.
*New Annotation*: According to *The Golden Chamber’s True Speech*, it opens at the two yin orifices.
(For the heart’s spirit-mind resides in the ears,
hence differing from this.)

In **flavor**, it is **saltiness**—
saltiness, soft yet transformative.

In **spirit-mind**, it is **fear**—
fear, the response to evil.
Fear harms the kidneys;
unrelenting fear internally affects the kidneys,
thus causing harm.
*The Spiritual Pivot* states:
*"Unresolved fear and dread deplete the essence."*
This clearly affects the kidneys.
*Thought overcomes fear*;
deep contemplation and foresight reveal truth,
thus conquering fear.

Cold harms **blood**,
for cold congeals blood—harm is evident.
*New Annotation*: According to *The Great Essentials*, blood nourishes bone.
Dryness overcomes cold;
dryness arises from heat, thus overcoming cold.
*New Annotation*: According to *The Great Essentials*, dryness refers to dampness.

Saltiness harms **blood**,
for excessive saltiness induces thirst—
harm to blood is clear.
*New Annotation*: According to *The Great Essentials*, blood nourishes bone.
Sweetness overcomes saltiness;
sweetness, the earth flavor, thus overcomes water’s salt.
*New Annotation*: Referring back to the earlier discussion with Qibo,
this aligns with *The Theory of the Five Movements*,
though annotations differ—both should be considered.

Thus it is said:
*"Heaven and Earth are the upper and lower of all things;
observing their covering and loading reveals
the upper and lower of all things."*

Yin and Yang are the **male and female of blood and qi**;
Yin governs blood, Yang governs qi—
Yin generates females, Yang generates males.

Left and Right are the **paths of Yin and Yang**;
Yin and Yang circulate through them—
thus Left and Right are the paths of Yin and Yang.
*New Annotation*: Detailed explanation of *questioning qi* appears in *The Grand Theory of Six Subtleties*.
Yang Shangshan notes:
*"Yin-qi moves to the right, Yang-qi to the left."*
This refers to it.

Water and Fire are the **omens of Yin and Yang**;
observing their qi clarifies Yin and Yang’s omens.

Yin and Yang are the **originators of all things**—
meaning they are the primal source of transformation and generation.
*New Annotation*: From *"Heaven and Earth are the upper and lower..."*
to *"originators of all things"* aligns with *The Grand Theory of Heaven’s Elements*,
though annotations differ—
the former omits *"Yin and Yang are the male and female of blood and qi,"*
and substitutes *"Metal and Wood are the beginning and end of generation"* for *"Yin and Yang are the originators."*

Thus it is said:
*"Yin within is the guardian of Yang;
Yang without is the servant of Yin.
Yin is still, thus it guards Yang;
Yang is active, thus it serves Yin."*

The Emperor asked: *"How does one follow Yin and Yang?"*
Qibo replied:
*"When Yang prevails, the body grows hot,
its functions are obstructed—
breathing becomes labored, with heaving sighs,
sweat does not emerge, yet heat persists,
teeth dry and the chest tightens,
the abdomen swells, and death follows.
Yang prevails, thus one endures winter,
but excessive heat makes summer unbearable."*

*"When Yin prevails, the body grows cold,
sweat emerges, the body remains chilled,
shivering frequently, cold seizes the limbs—
when seized, the abdomen swells, and death follows.
Seizure refers to inverted qi.
Yin prevails, thus one endures summer,
but excessive cold makes winter unbearable."*

These are the shifting patterns of Yin and Yang’s dominance,
the forms of disease they produce.

The Emperor asked: *"How does one harmonize these two?"*
Harmonizing means aligning with Heaven’s natural essence
to regulate the body’s blood, qi, and essence.

Qibo replied:
*"Knowing the Seven Depletions and Eight Augmentations
allows their balance—
ignoring this leads to premature decline."*

*Augmentations* refers to sexual activity.
For women, the seven *sevens* mark the end of *Heaven’s Water (tiān guǐ)*—
menstruation follows its cycle.
For men, the eight *eights* mark the peak of *Heaven’s Water*—
their vital essence overflows.
Yet knowing the *eight* allows augmentation,
knowing the *seven* allows depletion—
each follows their natural constitution,
nurturing True Nature to fulfill their allotted years,
reaching a hundred.

*The Treatise on Primordial Truth* states:
*"At twenty-one, a woman’s Heaven’s Water arrives,
and menstruation follows its season.
At twenty-eight, a man’s Heaven’s Water arrives,
and his essence overflows."*

Yet when the *seven* is depleted,
the sea fills, and blood descends naturally;
when the *eight* is augmented,
intercourse drains essence.
Thus, the logic of *Seven Depletions and Eight Augmentations* is clear.

At forty, Yin-qi diminishes by half—
vitality and movement decline;
internal depletion weakens Yin,
the center dries, and strength begins to fail.
*The Spiritual Pivot* states:
*"At forty, the governing functions grow sparse,
luster and bloom fade, hair turns white."*

Speaking from this perspective,
it marks the onset of decline.

At fifty, the body grows heavy,
ears and eyes lose their acuity—
the gradual onset of decay.

At sixty, Yin wanes, qi greatly declines,
the nine orifices malfunction,
the lower is empty, the upper is full—
tears and nasal secretions flow together.
This is the extreme of decay.

Thus it is said:
*"Knowledge strengthens, ignorance ages—
knowledge refers to the way of preserving form and nature through Seven Depletions and Eight Augmentations.
Thus, though desires are the same,
their names for aging and vigor differ."*

The wise perceive the subtle,
the foolish perceive the strange.
The wise observe the uniformity of desires,
and thus align with the Dao/Way;
the foolish see the external forms differ,
and then imitate them.

Aligning with one’s true nature brings the Dao/Way’s virtue/power in abundance,
while abandoning imitation leaves life’s cultivation insufficient.
Hence, the following passage states:
*"Abandonment and imitation are both in play."*

The foolish lack sufficiency,
the wise have abundance—
those who act first have abundance,
those who follow later lack sufficiency.
Abundance brings clear ears and eyes,
a light and strong body—
the aged regain their vigor,
the vigorous grow even more refined.
To preserve one’s true nature and maintain one’s form,
this is indeed the result of understanding the Dao/Way.
Thus it is said:
*"The Dao/Way cannot be momentarily forsaken,
what can be forsaken is not the Dao/Way."*
This is what is meant.

Therefore, the sagely ones engage in non-action,
delight in tranquil simplicity,
and follow desires to fulfill their will in the realm of the void.
Thus their lifespan is boundless,
enduring with heaven and earth—
this is the sagely way of nurturing the body.
The sagely ones do not pursue what is unbeneficial at the cost of what is beneficial,
nor do they harm their true nature while complying with it.
Thus their lifespan is long and enduring,
matching heaven and earth’s eternity.

Geng Sang Chu said:
*"When the sagely ones consider sounds, colors, flavors,
they take what benefits their true nature,
and avoid what harms it."*
This is the way of preserving one’s true nature.

The *Classic of Documents* states:
*"Do not create what is unbeneficial to harm what is beneficial."*

Heaven lacks the northwest,
so the northwest is Yin,
and thus a person’s right ears and eyes are not as clear as their left.
Above, they follow heaven’s pattern.
Earth does not fill the southeast,
so the southeast is Yang,
and thus a person’s left hands and feet are not as strong as their right.
Below, they follow earth’s pattern.

The Emperor asked:
*"Why is this so?"*
Qi Bo replied:
*"The southeast is Yang—
when Yang, its essence converges above,
converging above makes the upper clear while the lower depletes.
Thus it causes clear ears and eyes,
while the hands and feet are less nimble.
The northwest is Yin—
when Yin, its essence converges below,
converging below makes the lower strong while the upper depletes,
thus its ears and eyes are not clear,
while its hands and feet are more agile.
Hence, when both are struck by evil,
the right side suffers more when above,
the left side suffers more when below—
this is what heaven and earth’s Yin and Yang cannot fully encompass,
so evil settles there.
The response of Yin and Yang to heaven and earth
is like water in a vessel—
if the vessel is round, the water is round;
if the vessel is crooked, the water is crooked.
A person’s blood and *qi* are the same—
thus, where there is deficiency, evil *qi* lingers.

Heaven has essence, earth has form,
heaven has eight cycles, earth has five phases.
Yang is heaven, descending essence and *qi* to nourish transformation,
Yin is earth, spreading harmonizing *qi* to form shape.
The five phases are the wellsprings of life and growth,
the eight winds are the principles of change and regulation.
Eight cycles refer to the eight-year cycles.
Five phases refer to the five phases’ transformative nurturing.
Thus they can be the parents of all things.
Yang heaven transforms *qi*, Yin earth forms shape,
the five phases move in sequence, the eight winds stir and bend—
collecting, storing, and fostering growth,
never failing in their due timing.
Thus they can be the parents of all things’ transformations.

The pure Yang ascends to heaven,
the turbid Yin descends to earth.
How can they be the parents of all things?
Because of this ascending and descending.
Thus, heaven and earth’s motion and stillness,
the *shénmíng* (神明) governs their principles.
Pure Yang ascends to heaven,
turbid Yin descends to earth.
Yet who presides over their motion and stillness?
It is through the *shénmíng*’s principles.
The earlier passage says:
*"The *shénmíng*’s abode."*
This is what is meant.

Thus they can collect, store, and foster growth,
ending and beginning anew.
The *shénmíng*’s operation alone makes this possible.

Only the virtuous align above with heaven to nourish the head,
below with earth to nourish the feet,
and in the middle with human affairs to nourish the five *zàng* organs.
The head is round, so it aligns with heaven.
The feet are square, so they mirror earth.
Human affairs shift and change,
the five *zàng* organs transition in sequence—
thus they follow to nourish them.

Heaven’s *qi* connects with the lungs—
because it dwells above.
Earth’s *qi* connects with the throat—
because it is the next level down.
The wind’s *qi* connects with the liver—
because wind generates wood.
Thunder’s *qi* connects with the heart—
because thunder mirrors fire’s sound.
Grain’s *qi* connects with the spleen—
because grain is empty and the spleen receives and transforms.
Rain’s *qi* connects with the kidneys.
The kidneys govern water.

(*New corrected version states:*)
*"The wind’s *qi* responds to the liver,
thunder’s *qi* moves the heart,
grain’s *qi* affects the spleen,
rain’s *qi* moistens the kidneys."*

The six *jīng* meridians are like rivers,
flowing and draining without ceasing.
The intestines and stomach are like the sea,
for they all receive and transform.

The *Língshū Jīng* states:
*"The stomach is the sea of water and grain."*
The nine orifices are the channels of water’s flow.
The clear and bright are like water’s inner clarity,
the flowing and draining are like water’s circulation.
If one takes heaven and earth as Yin and Yang,
and matches human affairs with their symbols,
then it points directly to heaven and earth as Yin and Yang.

Yang’s perspiration is named after heaven and earth’s rain—
for human perspiration leaks through the skin’s pores,
this is the release of Yang *qi*.
Yet when comparing its nature to heaven and earth,
it is said to rise like vapor and descend like rain,
thus resembling it.
Hence, Yang’s perspiration is named after heaven and earth’s rain.

Yang’s *qi* is named after heaven and earth’s violent winds—
for Yang *qi* disperses and violent winds scatter.
Thus it corresponds to this.

(*Old texts lacked the two characters "名之",*)
so I added them based on prior examples.

Violent winds mirror thunder—
for violent winds beat and roar with sound.
Contrary *qi* mirrors Yang—
for contrary *qi* ascends forcefully, as Yang *qi* does.
Thus, if one does not follow heaven’s cycles,
nor use earth’s principles,
then calamity will arrive.

To defy heaven’s cycles,
and contradict earth’s principles,
then the six *jīng* meridians will reverse their function,
the five *qi* phases will inflict further harm.
Once the true *qi* is injured,
the arrival of calamity can be known.

「○ The newly corrected version states: According to the preceding text, heaven has eight cycles, and earth has five principles. In this passage, the character *lǐ* (理) should be read as *lǐ* (里). Hence, when the pathogenic *fēng* (风) arrives,
it strikes like wind and rain,
arriving, meaning it reaches the bodily form.
Thus, skilled practitioners treat the *pí máo* (皮毛),
halting it at its inception.
Next, they treat the *jī fū* (肌肤),
saving what has already arisen.
Next, they treat the *jīn mài* (筋脉),
assaulting what has already taken disease.
Next, they treat the six *fǔ* (府),
addressing what has already become severe.
Next, they treat the five *zàng* (藏).
Those who treat the five *zàng* (藏) are at the stage of half-death and half-life;
they treat what has already fully manifested.
Shén Nóng (神农) said:
When the disease’s momentum is already complete, one may achieve only half-recovery.
Yet, those who treat it early may gain full healing,
while those who treat it late will harm the form.
Thus, treating the five *zàng* (藏) is a stage of half-life and half-death.

Hence, heaven’s pathogenic *qi* (气),
when contracted, harms the five *zàng* (藏);
the *qi* (气) of the four seasons and the eight *zhèng* (正) winds,
all being heaven’s pathogenic *qi*,
as the *Jīn Guì Zhēn Yán Lùn* (《金匮真言论》) states:
When the eight winds generate pathogenic *qi*,
they become *jīng fēng* (经风),
touching the five *zàng* (藏),
and the pathogenic *qi* manifests as disease.
Thus, heaven’s pathogenic *qi*,
when contracted, harms the five *zàng* (藏).

The cold and heat of water and grain,
when contracted, harm the six *fǔ* (府);
heat injures the stomach and bladder,
while cold injures the intestines and *dǎn qì* (胆气).
Earth’s pathogenic *qi* (湿气),
when contracted, harms the skin, flesh, sinews, and vessels.
When *shī qì* (湿气) prevails,
the *róng wèi* (荣卫) *qi* (气) does not flow,
so when contracted, it harms the skin, flesh, sinews, and vessels.

Thus, skilled acupuncturists
follow the *yīn* (阴) to draw the *yáng* (阳), and follow the *yáng* (阳) to draw the *yīn* (阴),
using the right to treat the left, and the left to treat the right,
knowing the other through oneself, knowing the exterior through the interior,
and discerning the principles of excess and deficiency,
observing the subtle signs to grasp the excess,
and applying treatment without error.
This is the depth of their understanding.

Skilled diagnosticians
examine the complexion and palpate the pulse,
first distinguishing *yīn* (阴) and *yáng* (阳);
if they distinguish in *yáng* (阳),
then they know the location of the disease;
if they distinguish in *yīn* (阴),
then they know the period of death or life.

They discern clarity and turbidity,
and thus know the affected regions.
By "clarity and turbidity," it refers to the colors green, red, yellow, white, and black.
"Regions" means the positions of the *zàng* (藏) and *fǔ* (府) that can be observed and diagnosed.

They observe breathing and listen to sounds,
and thus know the suffering;
by "sounds," it refers to the five tones: *guān* (官), *shāng* (商), *jué* (角), *zhǐ* (征), and *yǔ* (羽).
By "breathing," it means observing the length and shortness of respiration.

They examine the scales and measures of balance,
and thus know the disease’s dominion.
*Quán* (权) refers to the weighing scale;
*héng* (衡) refers to the celestial balance.
*Guī* (规) refers to circular forms;
*jǔ* (矩) refers to square shapes.
Yet, *quán* (权) is what examines inner and outer;
*héng* (衡) is what determines high and low;
*guī* (规) is what reveals softness and emptiness;
*jǔ* (矩) is what clarifies strength and vigor.
The *Tuī Yào Jīng Wēi Lùn* (《豚要精微论》) states:
In spring, it corresponds to the center of the circle, speaking of *yáng qì* (阳气) as soft and yielding;
in summer, it corresponds to the center of the square, speaking of *yáng qì* (阳气) as strong and firm;
in autumn, it corresponds to the celestial balance, speaking of *yīn* (阴) ascending and *yáng* (阳) descending, with *qi* (气) having high and low positions;
in winter, it corresponds to the weighing scale, speaking of *yáng qì* (阳气) residing below.
Thus, skilled diagnosis is fully revealed by the scales.
The "dominion" refers to the *qi* (气) of the four seasons governing the disease,
whether its manifestation lies in high, low, inner, or outer regions.

By measuring the *cùn* (寸) and observing floating, sinking, slippery, and rough pulses,
one knows the origin of the disease to treat it accordingly.
Floating, sinking, slippery, and rough pulses are all *tuī* (豚) manifestations.
A floating *tuī* (豚) is one that floats beneath the hand;
a sinking *tuī* (豚) is one that is only felt upon pressure;
a slippery *tuī* (豚) is one that moves easily;
a rough *tuī* (豚) is one that moves with difficulty.
Thus, by carefully measuring the *cùn* (寸) and observing floating and sinking,
one knows the origin of the disease to treat it accordingly.

○ The newly corrected version states: According to the *Jiǎ Yǐ Jīng* (《甲乙经》),
it should read: "know the disease’s location, and treatment will have no excess."
The two characters *wú guò* (无过) are continued from the following sentence.
*Rough* (*sè*) is pronounced *sè* (色).
Without excess, diagnosis will not fail.
With excess or without, if one diagnoses properly,
then the dominion and treatment will have no error.

Hence it is said:
When a disease first arises,
it can be treated with acupuncture alone;
because it is still light and subtle.
When it is severe,
one can only wait for its decline before treating it.
To treat a severe disease is to exhaust and harm the true *qi*,
so for those whose disease is severe,
one must wait for its decline.
Thus, one must follow its lightness and elevate it—
when it is light, elevation will drive the pathogen away.
Follow its heaviness and suppress it—
when it is heavy, one must immediately call it forth.
Follow its decline and clarify it—
when the pathogenic *qi* declines,
one must attack to drive it away,
so the true *qi* becomes firm and the blood’s color clarifies.

If the form is insufficient,
one must warm it with *qi* (气).
If the essence is insufficient,
one must supplement it with flavor.
*Qi* (气) refers to *wèi qì* (卫气).
*Flavor* (味) refers to the essences of the five *zàng* (藏).
The *Líng Shū Jīng* (《灵枢经》) states:
*Wèi qì* (卫气) is what warms the flesh and fills the skin,
nourishes the pores and regulates opening and closing.
Thus, if *wèi qì* (卫气) is warm, the form will be sufficient.
The *Shàng Gǔ Tiān Zhēn Lùn* (《上古天真论》) states:
The kidneys govern water,
receiving the essences of the five *zàng* (藏) and six *fǔ* (府) to store them.
Thus, only when the five *zàng* (藏) are abundant can they be supplemented.
From this, it follows that if the essence is insufficient,
one must supplement the flavors of the five *zàng* (藏).

If the disease is high,
one must follow and elevate it—
elevate, meaning to raise and dispel it.»

If it is low, draw it out and exhaust it;
*Draw out* (引), meaning to drain and guide it downward.

If there is internal fullness, disperse it within;
*Within* (内), meaning the abdominal cavity.

If there is pathogenic influence, induce sweating to expel it;
*Pathogenic influence* (邪), meaning *wind-pathogenic qi* (风邪之气).
When wind invades the exterior, induce sweating to release it.
*Induce* (渍), pronounced *shì* (疾赐切).

If it is on the skin, induce sweating to release it;
It is on the exterior, so sweating and release drain it.

If it is violent and aggressive, press and restrain it;
*Violent* (栗), meaning *rapid* (疾).
*Aggressive* (悍), meaning *sharp* (利).
When *qi* is rapid and sharp, press to restrain and counter it.
*Violent* (栗), pronounced *lì* (必遥切).
*Aggressive* (悍), pronounced *hàn* (音汗).

If it is solidified, disperse and release it.
When *yang* is solidified, disperse it; when *yin* is solidified, ventilate and release it.
Thus, the following passage examines *yin* and *yang*,
to distinguish between softness and hardness—
*Yin* is soft, *yang* is hard.
For *yang* diseases, treat the *yin*;
for *yin* diseases, treat the *yang*—
this is called "following *yin* to draw *yang*, following *yang* to draw *yin*,
treating the right with the left, treating the left with the right."

Determine the *blood* and *qi*, each guarding its proper domain.
*Domain* (乡), meaning the position of the original channel’s *qi*.
If *blood* is solidified, use *cuì* (次) to break it—
*Cuì* (次), meaning to sequentially break the *blood*.
If *qi* is deficient, use *zhè* (掣) to guide it—
*Zhè* (掣), read as *dǎo* (导); guiding and drawing ensures *qi* flows freely.
*Note: The revised text states *zhè* (掣) as in the *Jia Yi Jing* (《甲乙经》).*

The **Discourse on the Separation and Union of *Yin* and *Yang***

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"I have heard that Heaven is *yang*, Earth is *yin*, the Sun is *yang*, and the Moon is *yin*. The great and small months, totaling three hundred and sixty days, complete a year, and humans likewise conform to this. The four seasons and the Five Phases operate within the body, so humans conform to them as well.*

*Newly corrected text states: The detailed account of Heaven as *yang* until the completion of a year overlaps with the *Six Nodal Pivots and Internal Symbols* (《Six Nodal Pivots and Internal Symbols Discourse》).*

*Now, the Three *Yin* and Three *Yang*—why do they not conform to the *yin* and *yang*? What is the reason for this?"*

Qībó replied: *"The *yin* and *yang*—when counted, they can reach ten; when extended, they can reach a hundred; when counted further, they can reach a thousand; when extended further, they can reach ten thousand. Ten thousand is vast beyond measure, yet their essence is singular.

*That singular essence refers to separation and union. Though they are beyond measure, their fundamental subtlety lies in the separation and union of their cycles. All can be understood through this principle.*

*Heaven covers and Earth bears; thus, all things begin to flourish. Those yet to emerge from the Earth are called *yin* dwelling—*yin* within the *yin*, named the *yin* of *yin* within the Earth. Dwelling within the *yin*, it is thus called *yin* dwelling.*

*When form stirs and emerges, it is still *yin*, for *yin* resides within *yin*, hence the *yin* of *yin*. Then, those that emerge from the Earth are called the *yang* within the *yin*. When form stirs and emerges, it becomes *yang*, for *yang* resides within *yin*, hence the *yang* of *yin*.*

*The *yang* provides its rectifying force, while the *yin* holds dominion. The *yang* dispenses pure *qi*, and thus all things flourish; the *yin* maintains order, and thus all forms stand.*

*Rectifying (予) is pronounced like 'with' (与).*

*Therefore, birth arises from Spring, growth from Summer, harvest from Autumn, and storage from Winter. Should the regular order be lost, then Heaven and Earth become blocked in their functions. Spring and Summer are *yang*, so they bring forth birth and growth. Autumn and Winter are *yin*, so they bring forth harvest and storage.*

*If #1 the regular Dao is lost, then Spring does not birth, Summer does not grow, Autumn does not harvest, and Winter does not store. As such, the *qi* of the four seasons becomes blocked and stagnant, and the *yin* and *yang* *qi* have nowhere to circulate.*

*The transformations of *yin* and *yang*—when they occur in humans—are also countable. Though Heaven and Earth’s *yin* and *yang* may be beyond measure, their application in the human form is countable.*

*The Yellow Emperor said: 'I wish to hear of the separation and union of the Three *Yin* and Three *Yang*.'*

Qībó replied: 'The Sage faces south while standing, with the front called **Broad Clarity** (广明) and the back called **Great Surge** (太冲).

*Broad (广) means 'great.' The south is ruled by the *yang* of the Fire Phase, where *yang* *qi* is abundant and luminous, hence **Great Clarity** (大明). It faces forward to illuminate all things, hence the Sage stands facing south.*

*The *Yijing* (《I Ching》) says: *'They meet in the Lì (离) hexagram.'* This refers to the same."*

Within the human body, the heart is housed in the south, hence the front is called **Broad Clarity** (广明). The **Surge Vessel** (冲脉) lies in the north, hence the back is called **Great Surge** (太冲). Yet the **Great Surge** is the **Kidney Vessel** (肾脉), which, when combined with the **Surge Vessel** (冲豚), becomes abundant and mighty—thus its name. This aligns with the following passage:

*"The Great Surge’s domain is called **Lesser Yin** (少阴).
This is where the **Kidney Vessel** (肾藏) and **Surge Vessel** (冲豚) unite, forming the outer layer of the **藏府** (zàngfǔ—storage and transformation organs).
Above **Lesser Yin** (少阴) lies **Greater Yang** (太阳).
The Kidney, a **Yin** organ, stores **精** (jīng—essence), while the **Bladder** (膀胱府), a **Yang** organ, governs its transformation. **Yin qi** resides below, **Yang qi** above—this is the **One Union** (一合) of the **经气** (jīngqì—channel qi)."*

*The *Língshū Jīng* (《灵枢经》) states:
*"The **Foot Lesser Yin Vessel** (足少阴之脉) is the **Kidney Vessel** (肾豚), arising beneath the little toe, ascending obliquely toward the sole of the foot.
Again, it says:
The **Foot Greater Yang Vessel** (足太阳之脉) is the **Bladder Vessel** (膀胱脉), running along the **京骨** (jīnggǔ—ankle bone) to the outer side of the little toe.
Thus, the **Foot Greater Yang** (太阳) is named above **Lesser Yin** (少阴). This corresponds to the following passage:
**Greater Yang’s** roots arise at **至阴** (Zhìyīn—a point), named **Yin within Yang** (阴中之阳).
**至阴** (Zhìyīn) is a point name, located at the outer side of the **Foot Lesser Yin** (足小指).
The **命门** (mìngmén—"Gate of Life") is where the essence’s radiance is stored and reflected—this is the **两目** (two eyes).
The **Greater Yang Vessel** (太阳之脉) originates at the eyes and descends to the feet, thus its roots are at the toe’s end, and it converges at the eyes.
The *Língshū Jīng* (《灵枢经》) states:
*"The **命门** (Gate of Life) is the eyes."*
This harmonizes with the *Língshū Jīng* (《灵枢经》). Since **Greater Yang** (太阳) occupies **Lesser Yin’s** (少阴) domain, it is called **Yin within Yang** (阴中之阳).*

*"The **Lesser Yin’s** (少阴) exterior is named **Lesser Yang** (少阳).
Within the human body, the **Lesser Yang Gallbladder Vessel** (胆少阳脉) runs externally to the **Liver Vessel** (肝脉), while the **Liver Vessel** (肝厥阴脉) courses internally to the **Gallbladder Vessel** (胆脉)."*

*The *Língshū Jīng* (《灵枢经》) states:
*"The **Foot Lesser Yin Vessel** (足厥阴咏) is the **Liver Vessel** (肝豚), arising at the junction of the great toe’s gathered hairs, ascending along the inner side of the foot.
The **Foot Lesser Yang Vessel** (足少阳之脉) is the **Gallbladder Vessel** (胆脉), running along the outer side of the foot, emerging at the outer side of the second toe of the foot.
Thus, the **Lesser Yin’s** (厥阴) exterior is named **Lesser Yang** (少阳).
Hence the following passage:
**Lesser Yang’s** roots arise at **窍阴** (Qiàoyīn—a point), named **Yin within Lesser Yang** (阴中之少阳).
**窍阴** (Qiàoyīn) is a point name, located at the outer side of the second toe of the foot. Since **Lesser Yang** (少阳) occupies the **Lesser Yin’s** (厥阴) exterior, it is called **Yin within Lesser Yang** (阴中之少阳)."*

Thus, the **Three Yang’s** (三阳) separation and union are as follows:
**Greater Yang** (太阳) is the **Opening** (开),
**Yang Ming** (阳明) is the **Closing** (阖),
**Lesser Yang** (少阳) is the **Pivot** (枢).

**Separation** (离) refers to the distinct application of the **Three Yang** (三阳).
**Union** (合) refers to their correspondence with **Yin** (阴).
Distinct application is their proper positioning within the **Three Yang** (三阳),
while correspondence is their outer layer, forming the **藏府** (zàngfǔ—storage and transformation organs).

The **Opening** (开), **Closing** (阖), and **Pivot** (枢) govern the **Three Yang** (三阳) *qi* in varying degrees and functions.
The **Opening** (开) regulates the foundation of movement and stillness.
The **Closing** (阖) holds the authority of restraint and consolidation.
The **Pivot** (枢) presides over the subtle transformations of motion.
Through these distinct applications of *qi*, the **Three Variations** (三变) occur.

*"The *Jiǔzhōu* (《九墟》) states:
**Greater Yang** (太阳) is the **关** (guān—barrier),
**Yang Ming** (阳明) is the **Closing** (阖),
**Lesser Yang** (少阳) is the **Pivot** (枢).
Thus, when the **关** (guān—barrier) is disrupted, the flesh and joints weaken, and sudden illness arises.
Hence, one diagnoses sudden illness by examining **Greater Yang** (太阳).
When the **Closing** (阖) is disrupted, the *qi* has no place to rest, and palpitations arise.
Hence, palpitations are all diagnosed by examining **Yang Ming** (阳明).
When the **Pivot** (枢) is disrupted, the bones tremble and cannot settle upon the earth.
Hence, bone trembling is diagnosed by examining **Lesser Yang** (少阳).
The *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* (《甲乙经》) agrees."*

The **Three Channels** (三经) must not lose their correspondence with each other.
When they converge and do not float, they are called **One Yang** (一阳).
When the **Three Channels** (三经) reach the hand and strike uniformly without difference in weight,
then one can truly say that the **One Yang** (一阳) *qi* has no further variation of the **Three Yang** (三阳) in its function.

*The Yellow Emperor said: "I wish to hear of the **Three Yin** (三阴)."*
Qībó replied:
*"The exterior is **Yang** (阳), the interior is **Yin** (阴).
This means the **Three Yang** (三阳) govern the exterior’s separation and union,
while the **Three Yin** (三阴) govern the interior’s separation and union.
Thus, the center is **Yin** (阴), its surge located below, named **Great Yin** (太阴).
The **Surge Vessel** (冲豚) lies beneath the **Spleen** (脾), hence it is said that its surge is below."*

*The *Língshū Jīng* (《灵枢经》) states:
*"The **Surge Vessel** (冲咏) and the **Foot Lesser Yin Vessel’s** (足少阴) **络** (luò—collateral) both arise beneath the **Kidney** (肾), ascending through the **胞中** (bāozhōng—uterus)."*
Thus, above its surge lies the **Great Yin** (太阴) domain.

The **Great Yin** (太阴) originates at **Yǐnbái** (隐白), named **Yin within Yin** (阴中之阴).
**Yǐnbái** (隐白), a point’s name, lies at the tip of the **Foot Greater Yin** (足太阴) **大指** (great toe), hence it is called **Yin within Yin** (阴中之阴).
Below the **Great Yin** (太阴), it is named **Lesser Yin** (少阴),
which is the next rank of **藏位** (zàngwèi—organ position) and **经脉** (jīngmài—channel pathways).
The **Great Yin** (太阴) is the **Spleen** (脾).
The **Lesser Yin** (少阴) is the **Kidney** (肾).
Near the lower aspect of the **Spleen’s** (脾) **藏位** (zàngwèi—organ position), lies the **Kidney’s** (肾) position.
The *Língshū Jīng* (《灵枢经》) states:
*"The **Foot Greater Yin’s** (足太阴) **咏** (yǒng—collateral), rising from the great toe’s tip,
ascends along the inner side of the toe,
reaching the front edge of the **内踝** (inner ankle),
then turns inward at the upper end,
following the **脏骨** (zànggǔ—visceral bone) posteriorly.
The **Foot Lesser Yin’s** (足少阴) **豚** (tún—channel), rising below the **小指** (little toe),
slants toward the **足心** (sole),
exiting beneath the **然骨** (rángǔ—ankle bone),
ascending along the **内踝** (inner ankle) posterior,
then turns inward at the upper end.
Thus, below the **Great Yin** (太阴), it is called **Lesser Yin** (少阴)."*
**Xīn** (新) [校正] (jiàozhèng—correction) reads: *"Yǒng"* (咏) as *"xíng"* (行).

The **Lesser Yin** (少阴) originates at **Yǒngquán** (涌泉), named **Yin within Lesser Yin** (阴中之少阴).
**Yǒngquán** (涌泉), a point’s name, lies beneath the **足心** (sole) in the curled toe’s hollow.
**Qù** (厥) [阴] (yīn—Yin) before the **Lesser Yin** (少阴) is named **厥阴** (Jué Yin),
also the next rank of **藏位** (zàngwèi—organ position) and **经豚** (jīngtún—channel pathways).
The **Lesser Yin** (少阴) is the **Kidney** (肾).
The **厥阴** (Jué Yin) is the **Liver** (肝).
Near the upper aspect of the **Kidney’s** (肾) **藏位** (zàngwèi—organ position), lies the **Liver’s** (肝) position.
The *Língshū Jīng* (《灵枢经》) states:
*"The **Foot Lesser Yin’s** (足少阴) **豚** (tún—channel) ascends along the **内踝** (inner ankle) posterior,
reaching the **瑞内廉** (ruì nèi lián—inner edge of the medial malleolus).
The **Foot厥阴** (Jué Yin) **脉** (mài—channel) follows the **足附上康** (zúfù shàng kāng—upper attachment of the foot),
one **寸** (cùn) from the **内踝** (inner ankle),
eight **寸** (cùn) above the ankle,
exchanging to emerge behind the **Foot Greater Yin** (足太阴),
then ascending to the **胭内** (yīn—inner aspect of the thigh)."*
Thus, before the **Lesser Yin** (少阴), it is called **厥阴** (Jué Yin).
The **厥阴** (Jué Yin) originates at **Dàdūn** (大敦), **Yin’s** (阴) **绝阳** (juéshàng—extreme Yang),
named **Yin’s** (阴) **绝阴** (juéyīn—extreme Yin).
**Dàdūn** (大敦), a point’s name, lies at the tip of the **Foot Greater Yin** (足大指),
within the **三毛** (sānmáo—three hairlines).
Two **Yin** (阴) channels converge, hence it is called **Yin’s** (阴) **绝阳** (juéshàng—extreme Yang).
**Jué** (厥) means *exhaustion*; at this point, **Yin’s** (阴) **qi** (气) is fully exhausted, hence it is called **Yin’s** (阴) **绝阴** (juéyīn—extreme Yin).

Therefore, the **separation and union** (離合) of the **Three Yin** (三阴):
**Great Yin** (太阴) is the **opening** (开), **厥阴** (Jué Yin) is the **closing** (阖), **Lesser Yin** (少阴) is the **pivot** (枢).
This reflects the **unevenness** (不等) of **qi** (气).

**Newly corrected annotation** states:
*"According to the *Jiǔzhǔ* (《九墟》):
If the **Great Yin** (太阴) **经** (channel) is **折** (zhé—blocked), then the **倉庫** (cāngkù—granaries) have no outlet;
**隔洞者** (gégēng—obstructed orifices) are treated by **Great Yin** (太阴).
If the **厥阴** (Jué Yin) **经** (channel) is **折** (zhé—blocked), then **qi** (气) is **施** (shī—dispersed) and **善悲** (shànbēi—prone to sorrow).
Sorrow is treated by **厥阴** (Jué Yin).
If the **Lesser Yin** (少阴) **枢** (shū—pivot) is **折** (zhé—blocked), then the **豚** (tún—channel) becomes **结** (jié—congested) and **不通** (bùtōng—unpassable).
Unpassability is treated by **Lesser Yin** (少阴).
The *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* (《甲乙经》) agrees.
The **Three Channels** (三经) must not lose their **相合** (xiānghé—correspondence).
**搏** (bó—pulsating) without **沉** (chén—sinking), is called **一阴** (yīyīn—uniform Yin).
**沉** (chén) means *distinctly visible* (殊见); **Yang** (阳) **浮** (fú—floating) is also so.
If the **channel’s** (经) **qi** (气) arrives as expected,
with no sinking or floating anomalies,
then all may be said to be **一阴** (yīyīn—uniform Yin) **qi** (气),
no longer exhibiting the **殊用** (shūyòng—distinct functions) of the **Three Yin** (三阴).

**Yin** (阴) and **Yang** (阳) **冲电** (chōngdiàn—colliding currents) **积传** (jīchuán—accumulate and transmit) as one **周** (zhōu—cycle),
**qi** (气) enveloping the **形表** (xíngbiǎo—body’s form and surface) to **相成** (xiāngchéng—mutually establish).
**冲狸** (chōngtún) refers to the **往来** (wǎnglái—reciprocating) of **qi** (气).
**积** (jī) means the **动** (dòng—movement) of **积豚** (jītún—accumulating channels).
**传** (chuán) means the **流传** (liúchuán—flowing transmission) of **厥阴** (Jué Yin) **qi** (气).
The **往来** (wǎnglái—reciprocating) of **咏** (yǒng—collateral) **qi** (气),
moving endlessly,
accumulating its **动** (dòng—movement),
**qi** (气) and **blood** (血) circulate in cycles,
responding to the **下二刻** (xià èr kè—two *kè* intervals) of **Water** (水) **dharma** (法) to complete one **周** (zhōu—cycle) through the body,
hence it is said that **积传** (jīchuán—accumulating transmission) forms one **周** (zhōu—cycle).

The **荣卫** (róngwèi—Nourishing and Defensive) **qi** (气),
following the **息** (xī—breath),
**游布** (yóubù—circulates diffusely),
**周流** (zhōuliú—circulates) through the **形表** (xíngbiǎo—body’s form and surface),
**拒捍** (jùhàn—resists and guards) against **虚邪** (xūxié—pathogenic vacuity),
overseeing the **主司** (zhǔsī—governance) of both **内** (interior) and **外** (exterior),
mutually establishing,
hence it is said that **qi** (气) envelops the **形表** (xíngbiǎo—body’s form and surface) to **相成** (xiāngchéng—mutually establish)."

**Newly corrected annotation** states:
*"According to another version, **冲狸** (chōngtún) is written as **冲冲** (chōngchōng)."*

The *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon* *Sùwèn* (《素问》) **补注释** (bǔzhūshì—supplementary annotations) **文卷** (wénjuàn—textual scrolls), **the sixth** (六), concludes.

**Supplementary Annotations to the *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon* *Sùwèn* (《素问》) – Scroll Seven**
*Revised by Tang Grand Steward’s Scholar Xī Xuànzǐ Wáng Bīng, Annotated by Song Lightly Robed Scholar Lín Yì et al., Corrected by Na Sūn Zhào*

**Discourse on the Differentiation of Yin and Yang**

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"What are the four **jīng** (经—*vital channels*) and twelve **cóng** (从—*sequential pulses*)?"*

**Jīng** refers to **jīngtún** (经豚—*canonical pulses*).
**Cóng** refers to **shùncóng** (顺从—*conformity*).

Qíbó replied:
*"The four **jīng** correspond to the four seasons, and the twelve **cóng** correspond to the twelve months, which in turn align with the twelve pulses. In spring, the pulse is **xián** (弦—*taut*); in summer, **hóng** (洪—*full*); in autumn, **fú** (浮—*superficial*); in winter, **chén** (沉—*deep*). These are the **jīngtún** of the four seasons.

The **cóng** refers to the **tiānqì** (天气—*celestial qi*) flowing sequentially through the twelve **chén** (辰—*celestial stems*), thus corresponding to the twelve months. The twelve months are:
- Spring: **Jiǎnyín** (建寅—*commencing in the Tiger*), **Mǎo** (卯), **Chén** (辰);
- Summer: **Jiǎnwèi** (建巳—*commencing in the Snake*), **Wǔ** (午), **Wèi** (未);
- Autumn: **Jiǎnshēn** (建申—*commencing in the Monkey*), **Yǒu** (酉), **Xū** (戌);
- Winter: **Jiǎnhài** (建亥—*commencing in the Pig*), **Zǐ** (子), **Chǒu** (丑).

The twelve **tún** (豚—*pulses*) are those of the **shǒusānyīn, sānyáng** (手三阴、三阳—*three yin and three yang of the hands*) and **zúsānyīn, sānyáng** (足三阴、三阳—*three yin and three yang of the feet*), their **qi** (气—*qi*) and **shù** (数—*numerical correspondences*) aligning, hence their **cānhé** (参合—*interrelation*).

Pulses have **yīnyáng** (阴阳—*yin and yang*). Knowing **yáng** (阳—*yang*) reveals **yīn** (阴—*yin*), and knowing **yīn** reveals **yáng**. Deep understanding encompasses their **biànyì** (变易—*transformations*).

There are five **yáng** (阳—*yang*), and five times five makes **èrshíwǔ yáng** (二十五阳—*twenty-five yang*).
The five **yáng** are the **yángqi** (阳气—*yang qi*) of the five **zàng** (藏—*viscera*).
The five **zàng** correspond to the seasons, each manifesting a **tún** (豚—*pulse*). Within a single pulse, the **yángqi** of the five **zàng** are encompassed. Five times five yields **èrshíwǔ yáng** (二十五阳—*twenty-five yang*).

**New Annotation:** According to the *Yùjī Zhēncáng Lùn* (《玉机真藏论》), *"Thus, diseases manifest in five transformations, and five times five makes twenty-five transformations."* The meaning aligns with this.

What is called **yīn** (阴—*yin*) is the **zhēncáng** (真藏—*true viscera*). When **seen** (见—*manifest*), it signifies **bài** (败—*decline*), and decline inevitably leads to death.

The five **zàng** are **yīn**, hence they are called the **zhēncáng**. When **seen** (见—*manifest*), it refers to:
- The **gān tún** (肝豚—*liver pulse*) arriving—**zhōngwài jí** (中外急—*urgent within and without*), like tracing a blade’s edge, **zézé** (责责—*trembling*) as if plucking a **qínsè** (琴瑟弦—*zither string*).
- The **xīn tún** (心豚—*heart pulse*) arriving—**jiān ér bó** (坚而搏—*firm and beating*), like stroking **cāngmáo zǐ** (苍苗子—*green grain seeds*), **lěilěi** (累累—*beaded*).
- The **fèi tún** (肺豚—*lung pulse*) arriving—**dà ér xū** (大而虚—*large and hollow*), like feathers brushing the skin.
- The **shèn tún** (肾豚—*kidney pulse*) arriving—**bó ér jué** (搏而绝—*beating then vanishing*), like fingering stone, **pīpī** (辟辟—*resonant*).
- The **pí tún** (脾豚—*spleen pulse*) arriving—**ruò ér zàshù zàshū** (弱而乍数乍疏—*weak, intermittently rapid then sparse*).

When such **tún** (豚—*pulses*) are **seen** (见—*manifest*), they all signify **zàngbài shénqù** (藏败神去—*visceral decline and spirit’s departure*), hence death is imminent.

**Lěi** (累) is pronounced **lì** (力) with a sharp tone.

What is called **yáng** (阳—*yang*) is the **wèiyuàn zhī yáng** (胃院之阳—*yang of the stomach and intestines*).
The **yáng** of the **wèiyuàn** (胃院—*stomach and intestines*) refers to the **rényíng zhī qì** (人迎之气—*qi of the *Rényíng* pulse*).
Observe its **tún** (豚—*pulse*)—its **dòngjìng xiǎodà** (动静小大—*movement, stillness, size*)—and whether it corresponds to the pulse.

The stomach is the **shuǐgǔ zhī hǎi** (水谷之海—*sea of water and grain*), so by examining its **qì** (气—*qi*), one knows the location of the disease.
The **Rényíng** pulse is located beside the **jiéhóu** (结喉—*laryngeal prominence*), where the pulse responds to the hand. Its **tún** (豚—*pulse*) typically is **zuǒxiǎo ér yòudà** (左小而右大—*smaller on the left, larger on the right*). The left is used to **hòu zàng** (侯藏—*auscultate the viscera*), the right to **hòu fǔ** (侯府—*auscultate the bowels).

**One Annotation:** *"Wèibāo zhī yáng"* (胃胞之阳—*yang of the stomach sac*) is incorrect.

**Guān** (管) is pronounced **guǎn** (管).

To **bié yú yáng** (别於阳—*differentiate in yang*) reveals the **bìngchù** (病处—*location of disease*).
To **bié yú yīn** (别於阴—*differentiate in yin*) determines the **sǐshēng zhī qī** (死生之期—*period of life or death).

**Yáng** (阳—*yang*) guards the exterior as **gù** (固—*fortified*), yet when **wàixié** (外邪—*external pathogens*) strike, differentiating in **yáng** reveals the **bìngchù** (病处—*location of disease*).
**Yīn** (阴—*yin*) harbors the spirit within. If examining the **zhēnzhèng chéngbài** (真正成败—*true authenticity of success or failure*), differentiating in **yīn** determines the **bìngzhě sǐshēng zhī qī** (病者死生之期—*patient’s period of life or death*).

**New Annotation:** According to the *Yùjī Zhēncáng Lùn* (《玉机真藏论》), *"Differentiating in yang reveals the origin of the disease; differentiating in yin determines the period of life or death."*

The three **yáng** (阳—*yang*) are in the head, the three **yīn** (阴—*yin*) in the hands—this is what is meant by **"one"** (一).
The head refers to **Rényíng** (人迎), the hand to **Qìkǒu** (气口). These two correspond, moving together and returning together. If their **xiǎodà qīdēng** (小大齐等—*size and equality are uniform*), they are called **píngrén** (平人—*the healthy individual*).
Thus, it is said that they are **"one"** (一).

**Qìkǒu** (气口) is located one **cùn** (寸) behind the **yújì** (鱼际—*fish border*) of the hand, while **Rényíng** (人迎) is one **cùn wǔfēn** (寸五分—*one and a half cun*) beside the **jiéhóu** (结喉—*laryngeal prominence*). Both can be used to **hòu zàngfǔ zhī qì** (侯藏府之气—*auscultate the viscera and bowels’ qi*).

To **bié yú yáng** (别於阳—*differentiate in yang*) reveals the **bìngjì shí** (病忌时—*forbidden times for the disease*).
To **bié yú yīn** (别於阴—*differentiate in yin*) determines the **sǐshēng zhī qī** (死生之期—*period of life or death*).
By **shí qì dìng qī** (识气定期—*recognizing qi and fixing the period*), one knows the **bìngjì** (病忌—*forbidden times*).
By **shěn míng chéngbài** (审明成败—*carefully discerning success or failure*), one knows the **sǐshēng zhī qī** (死生之期—*period of life or death*).

**Jǐn shú yīnyáng** (谨熟阴阳—*carefully mastering yin and yang*), **wú yǔ zhòngmóu** (无与众谋—*no need for collective deliberation*).
By **jǐnliàng qìhòu** (谨量气候—*carefully measuring qi and conditions*), one becomes **jīngshú yīnyáng** (精熟阴阳—*profoundly skilled in yin and yang*), thus the **bìngjì** (病忌—*forbidden times*) become clear, and doubts about **shēngsǐ** (生死—*life and death*) resolve themselves. When the path is correct, there is no confusion—why seek counsel from others?

What is called **yīnyáng** (阴阳—*yin and yang*) refers to:
- **Qù** (去—*departure*) as **yīn** (阴—*yin*), **zhì** (至—*arrival*) as **yáng** (阳—*yang*);
- **Jìng** (静—*stillness*) as **yīn** (阴—*yin*), **dòng** (动—*movement*) as **yáng** (阳—*yang*);
- **Chí** (迟—*slowness*) as **yīn** (阴—*yin*), **shù** (数—*rapidity*) as **yáng** (阳—*yang*).

This speaks of the **tún dòng zhōng** (豚动之中—*within pulse movement*).

For those holding the **zhēntún zhī zàngmài** (真脉之藏脉—*true pulses of the viscera*):
- If the **gān tún** (肝豚—*liver pulse*) is **xuányuè jí** (悬绝急—*suspended, abrupt, and urgent*), death occurs in **shíbā rì** (十八日—*eighteen days*);
- If the **xīn tún** (心豚—*heart pulse*) is **xuányuè** (悬绝—*suspended and abrupt*), death occurs in **jiǔ rì** (九日—*nine days*);
- If the **fèi tún** (肺豚—*lung pulse*) is **xuányuè**, death occurs in **shíèr rì** (十二日—*twelve days*);
- If the **shèn tún** (肾豚—*kidney pulse*) is **xuányuè**, death occurs in **qī rì** (七日—*seven days*);
- If the **pí tún** (脾豚—*spleen pulse*) is **xuányuè**, death occurs in **sì rì** (四日—*four days*).

The **zhēntún zhī zàngtún** (真豚之藏豚—*true pulses of the viscera*) refer to the **zhēncáng zhī mài** (真藏之脉—*true viscera’s pulses*).

The **shíbā rì** (十八日—*eighteen days*) is the remainder of the **jīn-mù chéngshù** (金木成数—*metal-wood numerical correspondence*).
The **jiǔ rì** (九日—*nine days*) is the remainder of the **shuǐhuǒ shēngchéng shù** (水火生成数—*water-fire generative numerical correspondence*).
The **shíèr rì** (十二日—*twelve days*) is the remainder of the **jīnhuǒ shēngchéng shù** (金火生成数—*metal-fire generative numerical correspondence*).
The **qī rì** (七日—*seven days*) is the remainder of the **shuǐtǔ shēngshù** (水土生数—*water-earth generative numerical correspondence*).
The **sì rì** (四日—*four days*) is the remainder of the **mù shēngshù** (木生数—*wood generative numerical correspondence*).

Thus, the *Discourse on the Healthy Person’s Qi Manifestations* (《平人气象论》) states:
*"When the liver pulse appears on **gēngxīn** (庚辛—*Gengxin*), death follows; when the heart pulse appears on **rényǐ** (壬癸—*Rényǐ*), death follows; when the lung pulse appears on **bǐngdīng** (丙丁—*Bǐngdīng*), death follows; when the kidney pulse appears on **wùjǐ** (戊己—*Wùjǐ*), death follows; when the spleen pulse appears on **jiǎyǐ** (甲乙—*Jiǎyǐ*), death follows."* This is because the **shù** (数—*numerical correspondences*) align, and those who reach their **qī** (期—*period*) perish without resistance.

**Why?** Because they cannot withstand the **kèzé zhī qì** (克贼之气—*overpowering pathogenic qi*).

It is said that when **two-yang** diseases manifest in the heart and spleen, there is inability to conceal or bend [one’s body], and women cease menstruating. The **two-yang** refers to the **Yangming** pulse of the large intestine and stomach.

*"Conceal or bend"* refers to matters of hidden intimacy. When the intestines and stomach fall ill, the heart and spleen are affected. If the heart is affected, blood does not flow; if the spleen is affected, flavors are not transformed. When blood does not flow, women cease menstruating; when flavors are not transformed, men produce little semen. Thus, matters of hidden intimacy cannot be fulfilled.

The *Discourse on the Correspondence of Yin and Yang* states: *"Those whose essence is insufficient should be supplemented with flavors."* Hence, when flavors are not transformed, the essence-qi diminishes.

The *Treatise on Strange Diseases* states: *"The womb and fetus are connected to the kidneys."* Again, the *Evaluation of Febrile Diseases* says: *"When menstruation does not arrive, the womb’s pulse is closed. The womb’s pulse belongs to the heart and connects within the womb, forcing the qi upward, blocking the heart’s qi from descending. Thus, menstruation does not arrive."*

This is its meaning. Again, the *Essay on the Primordial Truth of the Ancient Times* states: *"At twenty-one [women], the Heavenly Essence arrives, the Uterus Channel opens, and the Great Surge Pulse flourishes, so menstruation descends in its proper time. At twenty-eight [men], the Heavenly Essence arrives, and the essence-qi overflows and drains."*

Thus, in women, this manifests as amenorrhea; in men, as diminished semen. If transmitted as **wind consumption** or **breathing obstruction**, death follows without remedy—speaking of its profound and enduring nature. When the stomach’s disease deepens and spreads to the spleen, it becomes **wind-heat consumption**, eroding the body. When the large intestine’s disease worsens and spreads to the lungs, it causes wheezing and sudden gasping. When the intestines, stomach, spleen, and lungs all affect the heart—**one zàng and two fǔ**—they mutually overpower and weaken one another, leading to untreatable death.

*"Responsible"* (責) is pronounced *bèn*.

When **three-yang** diseases manifest, they produce **chills and fever**, leading to **flaccidity, edema, and ulcers**; or **withering and syncope**. The **three-yang** refers to the pulses of the large intestine, small intestine, and bladder.

The small intestine’s pulse arises from the hand, travels up the arm, circles the shoulder, and ascends to the head. The bladder’s pulse descends from the head, branches down the back, passes through the buttocks, and enters the perineum, following the anus. Thus, when disease is in the upper body, it produces chills and fever; when in the lower body, it causes **flaccidity, edema, ulcers, and syncope**.

*"Pain"* (痛) is **aching**; *"withering"* (痿) is **weakness**; *"syncope"* (厥) is **foot numbness**, meaning **inverted qi**.

If transmitted, it becomes **dryness of the skin**; if transmitted further, it becomes **drooping hernia**. When heat is severe, the essence and blood are exhausted, so the qi that nourishes the skin and hair disperses entirely. When yang-qi sinks downward and yin-pulse contends upward, upward contention brings excess cold, while downward sinking relaxes the tendons, causing the testicles to droop and loosen, resulting in **drooping hernia**.

It is said that when **one-yang** disease manifests, there is **shortness of breath, coughing, and frequent diarrhea**. The **one-yang** refers to the **Shaoyang** pulses of the gallbladder and triple burner. Gallbladder-qi overpowers the stomach, hence frequent diarrhea. When the triple burner is internally diseased, there is shortness of breath; when yang ascends to the lungs, there is coughing. Why? Because the heart’s fire responds internally.

If transmitted, it becomes **heart-tugging**; if transmitted further, it becomes **diaphragm obstruction**. When diaphragm-qi overpowers the heart, heart-heat causes internal **tugging**. When the triple burner internally congeals, central heat causes **obstruction and blockage**.

*"Tugging"* (掣) is pronounced *chè*, meaning **to drag**.

When **two-yang and one-yin** diseases manifest, they cause **startle, back pain, frequent belching, and yawning**, known as **wind syncope**. The **one-yin** refers to the **Jueyin** pulses of the Heart Conductor and liver.

The Heart Conductor’s pulse arises from the chest, emerges to belong to the heart. The classics say: *"Heart disease causes pain between the shoulder blades and shoulders."* Again, in the qi, it manifests as belching, hence back pain and frequent belching. When heart-qi is insufficient, kidney-qi overpowers it; the liver governs startle, hence startle and frequent yawning. Liver-qi is wind, and kidney-qi is inverted; since it is both wind and rebellion, it is called **wind syncope**.

When **two-yin and one-yang** diseases manifest, there is **distension, heart fullness, and frequent flatulence**. The **two-yin** refers to the **Shaoyin** pulses of the heart and kidneys. When kidney and gallbladder qi rebel together, the triple burner does not function, and the qi is constricted upward, causing heart fullness. When the lower body is empty and the upper body is full, the qi escapes outward.

When **three-yang and three-yin** diseases manifest, they cause **hemiplegia, withering, and inability to lift the limbs**. When the three yin are insufficient, **hemiplegia** occurs; when the three yang are excessive, **withering** ensues. *"Withering"* means **altered function and weakness**.

When one-yang pulses are **stirred**, it is called **hook**; when one-yin is stirred, it is called **hair**. When yang is **overwhelming and urgent**, it is called **string**. When yang arrives and suddenly **cuts off**, it is called **stone**. When yin and yang **overstep**, it is called **slippery**.

How does one know the yin-yang disease pulses are evil? When one-yang is stirred, the pulse appears **hook-like**. Why? The **one-yang** refers to the triple burner, the heart’s **auxiliary fǔ**. When one-yang is stirred, the **hook pulse** corresponds to it—the **hook pulse** belongs to the heart, speaking of its **true manifestation**.

The **one-yin** is **Jueyin**, the liver’s wood-qi. *"Hair"* belongs to the lungs, the **metal pulse**. When metal stirs wood, the pulse becomes **hair-like**; when metal-qi internally overpowers, wood-yang is still dominant, urgent and internally visible, the pulse becomes **string**. If yang-qi arrives and is suddenly **cut off**, the pulse is called **stone**, belonging to the kidneys. When yin and yang qi **overstep**, neither can overpower the other, so the pulse is like **slippery water**.

When yin contends internally and yang disturbs externally, the **spirit-sweat** does not conceal itself, and **four reversals** arise. When they arise, they **specialize in the lungs**, causing wheezing and gasping. If metal-stirring does not cease, yang-qi overwhelmingly prevails, and the two qi clash—internal contention and external disturbance—leading to unceasing sweating. When hands and feet become cold, yang-qi internally flips, sweat does not conceal itself, and heat attacks the lungs, so when it arises, it **specializes in the lungs**, causing wheezing and gasping.

The birth of yin lies in harmony, which is called *hé* (和). Yin refers to the five spirit-organs, meaning that the five organs can generate and preserve the true harmony of Heaven’s *qi* only when each follows its inherent nature and remains tranquil. If they stray from their proper course, they will be overpowered by other *qi*, and myriad diseases arise from this. How can one not be cautious in nurturing life?

Thus, when *yang* clashes with *yang*, the *yang-qi* is dispersed and broken, and the yin-qi perishes. *Yang* refers to *yang-qi*—when it steams internally and flows as sweat externally, scorching without cessation, *yang* prevails over *yang*, and its excess cannot endure long before the *yang-qi* scatters. Once *yang* is broken, yin cannot stand alone, so when *yang-qi* is dispersed, yin-qi also fades—this is the result of contending for victory and inviting defeat.

When *yang* and *yin* are unbalanced, the channel *qi* is severed. For those with pure blood, *yang* is always dominant; one must harmonize their *qi* and ensure its smooth circulation. If they fail to cultivate deep thought and moderation, disrupting the natural order of *qi*, *yang* becomes excessive, and the organs perish—death is then inevitable, and longevity impossible.

For the category of *dead yin*, death occurs within three days—*fire* overpowers *metal*. For the category of *living yang*, death occurs within four days—*wood* overpowers *fire*. [*Note: Some texts correct this to "four days to live," but the original context confirms "death."*]

The *living yang* refers to the liver and heart: the mother nurtures the child, hence *living yang*—not only does *wood* generate *fire*, but *yang-qi* itself governs life. The *dead yin* refers to the heart and lungs: yin governs punishment and slaughter, and *fire* again overpowers *metal*, causing *metal* to perish when attacked by *fire*, hence *dead yin*. The *double yin* refers to the lungs and kidneys—both mother and child are governed by yin-qi, hence *double yin*. The *avoided yin* refers to the kidneys and spleen—death is inevitable. When earth-qi is disrupted, water cannot ascend—this is *avoided yin*.

*Structured yang* causes limb swelling—since the four limbs are the roots of all *yang*. *Structured yin* causes one *sheng* of blood in the stool—yin governs blood. If it recurs, two *sheng* appear; if it recurs again, three *sheng* appear. When yin and yang are misaligned, excessive yin and deficient yang is called *stone-water*, causing lower abdominal swelling—this is *losing the law*. When two *yang* structures form, it is called *consumption*—two *yang* structures refer to simultaneous heat in the stomach and large intestine. When the intestines and stomach harbor heat, they crave cold liquids.

When three *yang* structures form, it is called *obstruction*—three *yang* structures refer to heat in the small intestine and bladder. Heat in the small intestine dries the blood, and heat in the bladder exhausts the fluids, causing constipation. When three *yin* structures form, it is called *water*—three *yin* structures refer to cold in the spleen and lungs, causing *qi* to condense into water.

When one *yin* and one *yang* structure form, it is called *throat obstruction*—one *yin* refers to the heart’s channel, and one *yang* refers to the triple burner’s channel. The triple burner and heart channels converge at the throat, and internal heat causes obstruction. *Obstruction* is pronounced *bì* (闭).

When yin pulses clash with *yang* separately, it is called *having a child*—yin refers to the *cun* position. *Clash* means striking the hand. If the *cun* pulse beats forcefully, differing from the *guan* position, *yang-qi* rises strongly, signaling a sign of pregnancy—because there is a distinct *yang* within yin.

When yin and yang are both deficient, the intestines are disrupted, and death follows. [*Note: Some texts read "avoided" (避) instead of "disrupted" (辟).*] If stomach *qi* does not linger, the intestines open uncontrollably, and yin cannot retain—this is the exhaustion of true *qi*, hence death.

When *yang* overwhelms yin, it is called *sweat*—when *yang* is below and yin above, *yang-qi* rises and strikes upward; if yin complies, it condenses into sweat. When yin is deficient and *yang* strikes, it is called *uterine bleeding*—when the yin channels are insufficient, the *yang* pulses beat violently, causing internal rupture and downward blood flow.

If all three yin pulses beat, death occurs at midnight on the twentieth day—this aligns with the spleen and lungs’ numerical cycle. *Beating* refers to a hidden drumming, differing from the usual pulse. When yin-qi reaches its extreme, death occurs at midnight.

If two yin pulses beat, death occurs at dusk on the thirteenth day—this aligns with the heart and kidneys’ numerical cycle. When yin-qi is not yet extreme, death occurs at dusk.

If one yin pulse beats, death occurs on the tenth day—this aligns with the liver and heart’s numerical cycle.

If all three *yang* pulses beat and drum, death occurs in three days—*yang-qi* is swift and urgent.

If all three yin and three *yang* pulses beat, the abdomen swells, the body hair falls out, and defecation is impossible—death occurs in five days, as yin is also involved. *Hidden curves* refers to defecation.

If two *yang* pulses beat, their *qi* is chaotic, and death is untreatable, occurring within ten days—this aligns with the stomach and large intestine’s numerical cycle. [*Note: Some texts omit one *yang* pulse beating.*]

[*End of the annotated commentary on the *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Classic, Plain Questions*, Volume Seven.*]

Death.

The numerical cycle of the liver and heart is thus.

If all three *yang* pulses beat and drum, death occurs in three days—*yang-qi* is swift and urgent.

If all three yin and three *yang* pulses beat, the chest and abdomen swell, the body hair falls out, and defecation is impossible—death occurs in five days, as yin is also involved. *Hidden curves* refers to defecation.

If two *yang* pulses beat, their *qi* is chaotic, and death is untreatable, occurring within ten days—this aligns with the **stomach** and large intestine’s numerical cycle. [*Note: Some texts omit one *yang* pulse beating.*]

「The *Linglan Secret Canon* (论篇) [Newly Revised Text] states: According to Quan Yuanqi’s original title, it was named *The Twelve Zang Organs and Their Functions* (《十二藏相使》). The Yellow Emperor asked: I wish to hear about the functions and roles of the twelve Zang organs—how do they differ in rank and status? The Zang are called "Zang," meaning the repositories within the abdomen; they are not the twelve forms of the spirit and body as commonly understood.

Qibo replied: Your question is profound! Let me explain fully.

The **heart** is the organ of the sovereign, from which **virtue/power** and clarity emerge. It governs affairs through the **Dao/Way**, thus it is the sovereign’s organ; its purity and stillness command the spirit, hence it is said that **virtue/power** and clarity arise from it.

The **lungs** are the organ of the ministerial aide, from which regulation and order emerge. Though its station is high, it is not the sovereign, so it serves as a ministerial aide; it oversees the circulation of **honor-qi** and **defense-qi**, hence regulation and order come from it.

The **liver** is the organ of the general, from which strategy and foresight emerge. It is bold and decisive, hence called the general; its **qi** is yet to manifest, thus strategy and foresight arise from it.

The **gallbladder** is the organ of rectitude, from which judgment and decision emerge. It is firm, upright, and swift in action, hence it is the organ of rectitude; it is straightforward without hesitation, thus judgment and decision come from it.

The **pericardium** is the organ of the attendants, from which joy and delight emerge. The pericardium lies between the breasts, serving as the **sea of qi**. The heart, as sovereign, issues commands through the **pulse** (#1), while the pericardium governs **qi**, distributing it to yin and yang. When **qi** is harmonious and the will is at ease, joy and delight naturally arise, and it regulates yin and yang. Thus, it is the organ of the attendants.

**Spleen and stomach** are the organ of the granaries, from which the five tastes emerge. They contain and process the five grains, hence they are the granaries’ organ; they nourish the four limbs, thus it is said that the five tastes arise from them.

The **large intestine** is the organ of transmission, from which transformation emerges. Transmission refers to conveying the impure **Dao/Way**; transformation refers to altering the form of substances. Hence, it is called the organ of transmission, and transformation comes from it.

The **small intestine** is the organ of reception and containment, from which further transformation emerges. It receives and processes the remnants from the stomach, transforming them before passing them into the large intestine. Thus, it is the organ of reception and containment, and further transformation comes from it.

The **kidneys** are the organ of vigor and strength, from which ingenuity and craft emerge. They excel in function, hence called the organ of vigor; they shape and refine, thus ingenuity and craft arise from them. In women, this corresponds to their ingenuity and craft; in men, it aligns with their robust strength.

The **San Jiao/Triple Burner** is the organ of the waterways, from which fluid pathways emerge. It guides and harmonizes yin and yang, opening and unblocking obstructions, hence it is the organ of the waterways, and fluid pathways emerge from it.

The **bladder** is the organ of the isolated palace, where **bodily fluids** are stored, and **qi** transformation enables their release. Its station is that of an isolated palace, hence it is called the organ of the palace. It resides in the lower abdomen, hollow within, thus storing **bodily fluids**. If it receives **qi** from the **sea of qi** for transformation, then urination flows freely; if the **sea of qi**’s influence is insufficient, then urination becomes blocked and difficult. Hence, it is said that **qi** transformation enables their release.

The *Linglan Classic* states: The kidneys connect to the lungs above, thus they govern the two Zang organs; the bladder is the isolated palace. This is what is meant.

**Urine** is called *shou* (瘦).

In total, these twelve organs must not fail one another. If they do, calamity and harm will follow, hence they must not fail one another.

[Newly Revised Text] states: Upon closer examination, there are actually eleven organs, as the spleen and stomach share one function.

Thus, if the sovereign’s **virtue/power** is clear, then all below will be at peace, and if one cultivates life through this, longevity will follow, and one will not perish in this world. If applied to governing the realm, great prosperity will arise.

The sovereign refers to the heart’s organ. If the sovereign is virtuous and clear, then rewards and punishments will be unified; unified rewards and punishments mean officials will follow the law. When officials follow the law, the people will not suffer unjust or excessive punishments, hence it is said that a clear sovereign brings peace to the realm (#2).

If the heart’s **virtue/power** is internalized, then it discerns good and evil; discerning good and evil means it perceives safety and danger; perceiving safety and danger means the body will not be harmed prematurely by unrighteous **Dao/Way**. Thus, if one cultivates life through this, longevity will follow, and one will not face peril in this world.

When applied to cultivating life, one avoids peril in this world; when applied to the sovereign, the realm is at peace. If this is used as the sovereign’s guiding principle, then the nation’s fortunes will flourish.

If the sovereign’s **virtue/power** is unclear, then the twelve organs are in peril, their functions blocked and stagnant, and the body is gravely harmed. If one cultivates life through this, misfortune will follow; if applied to governing the realm, the lineage will face great danger. Beware! Beware!

Functions refer to the pathways of spirit and **qi** (#3).

If the heart’s **virtue/power** is unclear, then righteousness and vice become indistinguishable; if righteousness and vice are not distinguished, then harm and benefit cannot be separated. If harm and benefit are not separated, then the calamities of reckless action will ensnare the body, leading to exhaustion and depletion. Hence, the body is gravely harmed, and if one cultivates life through this, misfortune will follow.

If the sovereign’s **virtue/power** is unclear, then authority is delegated to the left and right. If authority is delegated to the left and right, then power and influence act arbitrarily; arbitrary power and influence mean officials cannot follow the law. When officials cannot follow the law, the people lose their bearings and are all subjected to injustice and distortion.

Moreover, the people are the foundation of the state; if the foundation is secure, the state is stable. If the foundation is not secure, how can the state endure? The establishment of ancestral temples—how can they not face ruin and peril? Hence, it is said: "Beware! Beware!" meaning one must be deeply cautious.

**Exhaustion** is pronounced *ji* (瘠).

The **Dao/Way** is subtle and infinite in transformation; who can fathom its origin?

[Newly Revised Text] states: According to *The Grand Essentials* (《太素》), the original reads: "The diligent one is ever vigilant" (肖者濯濯). The **Dao/Way**’s applications are subtle when minute and profound, penetrating all things; vast when expanded, infinite in transformation. Yet its depths and sources—who can truly comprehend them?

How constrained it is! The diligent one is ever vigilant, yet who can grasp its essentials?

The critical and harmonious alignment of the body’s **Dao/Way** must be understood; who is the adept at discerning its essence?

**Constrained** (窘) is also **essence** (要). *Huoqi* (霍瞿) means "constant motion." The essential principles of the body must be sought, and the **Dao/Way** is what governs them. Yet through the ebb and flow of changes, one investigates the laws of nature and sings of knowing the fundamental source of transformation. Though ever vigilant and diligent, seeking clarity, its essence remains profound—who can truly know it? Since it cannot be known, it grows ever deeper and more distant; the subtle and mysterious essence is yet unknown, and who can say who is truly adept at understanding it?」

The profound and mysterious, deep and distant—though not grasped by seeking through reason, yet when examined within the self, the twelve **organs** (官) may be roughly explored, and this becomes the **Dao/Way** for governing the body.

**Faint and elusive** (闵闵) is the same as **deep and distant** (深远). **Adept** (良) means **good** (善).

---
*The **Dao/Way** of subtle brilliance (精光), the great sage’s work (大圣之业), and the proclamation of the grand **Dao/Way** (大道)—*
*unless through fasting, purification, and selecting auspicious days (斋戒择吉日),*
*I dare not receive it.*
*This is due to profound reverence (深敬).*

Han Kangbo said:
*"On the day of heart-washing (洗心) and alignment (日齐),*
*one must guard and restrain (防息) and observe restraint (日戒)."*

Thus, the Yellow Emperor (黄帝) chose an auspicious day and favorable omen (吉日良兆),
and stored the **Essence of the Soul** (灵兰) within a secret chamber (室),
to pass it down and preserve it.
*This is the utmost secrecy (秘之至也).*

**Chapter on the Six Divisions and Hidden Symbols (六节藏象论篇)**

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"I have heard that Heaven uses the six divisions of six (六六之节) to complete a year, and that Earth uses nine cycles of nine (九九制会) to regulate its affairs. The new revision states: ‘See further below: Earth uses nine cycles of nine (九九制会) to regulate its affairs.’ It is said that humans also have three hundred sixty-five nodes (节), as do Heaven and Earth since ancient times. But I do not know what this means.

The six divisions of six refer to the six cycles of the six *Hexagrams* (六甲之日), completing the seasonal divisions of a year. The nine cycles of nine refer to the nine revolutions of the nine *Divisions of the Earth* (九野之数), regulating the correspondence of human form with the cosmic *ways* (会通). It is said that humans have three hundred sixty-five nodes to align with Heaven’s six divisions of six since ancient times. If one were to use nine cycles of nine as a reckoning method, then one and a half years would constitute a single revolution—yet I do not know what the true original intent of this reckoning was.*

*New revision states: ‘See Wang’s annotation: one and a half years constitutes a single revolution.’ According to the nine cycles of nine (九九制会), it should read: ‘one and a half years plus one-fourth of a year constitutes a single revolution.’*

Qibo replied: *"Your question is most luminous! Let me elucidate it fully.

The six divisions of six and the nine cycles of nine are the means by which Heaven’s measures and the *numbers of qi* (气之数) are rectified. The six divisions of six are Heaven’s measures; the nine cycles of nine are the *numbers of qi*. By ‘numbers of qi,’ I mean the *qi of generation and transformation* (生成之气).

The division of Heaven’s revolution spans nearly three hundred sixty-five degrees and one-fourth of a degree. When evenly distributed through the twelve *Seasonal Qi* (节气), the *qi* completes three hundred sixty days in a cycle, yet small months still fall short of this total. Therefore, the sixty-four *qi* are always adjusted with intercalary months. Why? Because of the accumulated discrepancies in their divisions.

The generative processes of Heaven and Earth originate from the *sixfold foundation of yin and yang* (陆於阴阳), while the movement of human and divine *essence* (神) begins and ends with the nine *qi*. Yet the function of these nine *qi* is vast indeed! The *Lü Shū* (律书) states: ‘The *huángzhōng* (黄钟) pipe is nine inches long, and on the day of the winter solstice, the *qi* corresponds to the *ashen* (灰飞) phase.’ Thus, the generation of all things is indeed tied to the nine *qi*.

In ancient times, the ‘nine inches’ referred to today’s ‘seven and three-tenths inches’ (七寸三分), though variations exist due to differing standards of measurement. The *Lü Shū* (律书) further states: ‘The *huángzhōng* pipe is nine inches long, and on the day of the winter solstice, the *qi* corresponds to the *ashen* (灰飞) phase.’ Thus, the generation of all things is indeed tied to the nine *qi*.

The *measures of Heaven* (天度) regulate the movement of the sun and moon. The *numbers of qi* mark the functions of generation and transformation. ‘Regulate’ means to establish standards; ‘mark’ means to set guiding principles. The standards for the sun and moon’s movement determine whether their paths are slow or swift. The marking of the functions of generation and transformation reveals that when the *qi* arrives, its effects manifest. If the *qi*’s responses are without error, the principles of generation and transformation remain unbroken. The sun’s slow or swift movement governs the length of large and small months, and thus the seasons shift. Hence, days vary in length, months shift between warmth and cold, and the cycles of gathering, storing, generating, and growing never fail to align with the proper times.

Heaven is yang, Earth is yin, the sun is yang, and the moon is yin. Their movements have divisions and guiding principles, and their revolutions follow fixed *Dao* (道理). The sun moves one degree per day, while the moon moves thirteen degrees and a fraction, completing three hundred sixty-five days in a year. Thus, the accumulation of *qi*’s surplus results in intercalary months.

The sun moves slowly, so its daily traversal of Heaven’s one degree requires three hundred sixty-five days to complete a full revolution, yet there remains a fractional degree unaccounted for. The moon moves swiftly, so its daily traversal of Heaven’s thirteen degrees and a fraction completes a revolution in twenty-nine days. By ‘fraction,’ I mean that beyond the thirteen degrees, it moves an additional seven-tenths of a degree, hence the statement: ‘the moon moves thirteen degrees and a fraction.’

The *Lǐ Yì* (礼义) and the *Han Lü Lì Zhì* (律历志) of the Han state: ‘The twenty-eight *mansions* (宿) and all stars move from east to west across Heaven, while the sun, moon, and five planets move from west to east across Heaven.’ But the *Grand Historian’s* (太史) account says: ‘All move eastward across Heaven, turning from east to west.’ The various *reckoners of time* (历家) state that in the first four days of the moon’s cycle, its movement is most rapid, traversing fourteen degrees and a fraction per day and night. From the fifth to the eighth days, its movement is slightly slower, traversing thirteen degrees and a fraction per day and night. From the ninth to the nineteenth days, its movement is even slower, traversing twelve degrees and a fraction per day and night. From the twentieth to the twenty-third days, its movement quickens slightly, traversing thirteen degrees and a fraction per day and night. From the twenty-fourth day to the end of the month, its movement quickens greatly, traversing fourteen degrees and a fraction per day and night. But the *Grand Historian’s* account of the moon’s movement does not match this.

The moon’s movement varies: it is swift for the first fifteen days and slow for the last fifteen, or slow for the first fifteen and swift for the last. Generally, in one month, one-fourth of the days exhibit either swift or slow movement, and the degrees of swiftness and slowness are not fixed. Still, the moon ultimately completes a revolution in twenty-seven days, traversing three hundred sixty degrees in total. On the twenty-ninth day, the sun moves twenty-nine degrees, while the moon moves three hundred eighty-seven degrees, falling short by seven degrees. On the thirtieth day, the sun shifts again, and the moon’s movement reaches eight-tenths of a day’s fraction (十三分日之八), only then aligning with the sun. This is the *greatly depleted month* (大尽之月). If the moon’s movement reaches half of a day’s fraction (十三分日之半), it is also considered a greatly depleted month. If it reaches five-sixths of a day’s fraction (十三分日之五之六) and aligns with the sun, it is a *slightly depleted month* (小尽之月). Hence, the statement: ‘large and small months complete three hundred sixty-five days to form a year.’

To speak precisely: three hundred sixty-five days and one-fourth of a day constitute the law of a year. Since the fraction does not complete a full day, it is rounded to six (六), hence the statement: ‘If one were to use six small fractions as the standard, then a year would only have three hundred fifty-four days, leaving an eleven-day surplus unaccounted for.’*"*

The deficiency of the moon’s hours is supplemented by the surplus days beyond the year, hence the leap month begins thirty-two days after the previous leap month, thus completing the intercalation.

*The Shangshu* states: *"Three hundred sixty days and six weeks, using the leap month to regulate the four seasons and complete the year."* Thus its meaning is:

The accumulated surplus fills the intercalary month, yet it does not exhaust the celestial degree because it follows the moon’s large and small cycles. Establish the beginning at the start, mark the midpoint in the middle, and extend the surplus to the end—thus the celestial degree is fulfilled.

*End* is the beginning; *beginning* is the initial. *Mark* means to manifest; *midpoint* refers to the month’s half. *Extend* means to shift positions. It speaks of establishing the initial *qi* at the first node’s day, manifesting the *dou* constellation at the midpoint hour, and shifting the surplus leap to the subsequent cycle. Therefore, before the leap month, the *qi* does not align with the month, and after the leap month, the month does not align with the *qi*.

Hence, the regulation of ordinary months begins and marks the midpoint, while the leap month’s reckoning has neither beginning nor midpoint. Even if the calendar includes them, they belong to other node-*qi* cycles. Therefore, the calendar does not say, *"The [seasonal] node of such-and-such month, the leap month’s node in such-and-such month."* The meaning of extending to the end is now clear. Thus, it is said: *"Establish the beginning at the start, mark the midpoint in the middle, and extend the surplus to the end."*

From this, the leap month is formed by extending the days, thus fulfilling the celestial degree.

The Emperor said: *"I have already heard of the celestial degree. I wish to hear how the *qi* and numbers harmonize?"*

Gǐ Bó replied:

*"Heaven uses six times six as its nodes, Earth uses nine times nine for its gatherings. [New annotation: The original text states: *‘Man uses nine times nine for its gatherings.’*] Heaven has ten days—when six cycles complete, the *jiǎzi* sequence returns, and six repetitions conclude the year, totaling three hundred sixty days.

*Ten days* refers to the days of *jiǎ-yǐ-bǐng-dīng-wù-jǐ-gēng-xīn-rén-guǐ* [the ten Heavenly Stems]. Ten is the supreme number of Heaven and Earth. *The Yì Jīng Shì Yì* states: *‘Heaven is nine, Earth is ten.’*

Thus, sixty days complete one cycle of *jiǎzi*, and six cycles return to the beginning. Therefore, the days of a year total three hundred sixty, which is not the celestial degree’s number. This is because each of the twelve months originally had thirty days; if small months are subtracted, the days differ again.

Since antiquity, those who harmonized with Heaven’s order have taken life’s foundation—rooted in yin and yang. Their *qi* flows through the nine regions and nine orifices, all communicating with Heaven’s *qi*.

*Communicating with Heaven* refers to the primal *qi*, the very essence of Heaven. Yet, form is borrowed from Earth’s generation, while life is bestowed by Heaven’s decree. Thus, the *qi* of life, connected to Heaven, draws from the yin field, forming the root and foundation.

*The Bǎo Mìng Quán Xíng Lùn* states: *"Man is born of Earth, his fate suspended by Heaven. When Heaven and Earth merge their *qi*, life is named ‘human.’"*

*The Sì Qì Tiáo Shén Dà Lùn* states: *"Yin and yang, the four seasons—these are the end and beginning of all things, the source of death and life."* It further says: *"To act against their root is to sever their foundation, destroying their essence."*

Thus is its meaning.

The Nine Regions refer to **Jì, Kè, Qīng, Xú, Yáng, Jīng, Yǔ, Líng, and Yōng**.

Yet, the Earth is divided into the Nine Regions, while humans possess the Nine Orifices. Vital essence (*shén*) circulates endlessly, and *qi* harmonizes with the Three Celestial Stems (*sānshēn*), hence the saying: "Nine Regions, Nine Orifices." As the *Língshū Jīng* states: *"The Earth has Nine Regions; the human body has Nine Orifices."* This is its meaning.

First, it speaks of *qi*, referring to the primal *qi* of Heaven (*tiānzhēn*), which is always connected to the center. When Heaven’s *qi* does not cease, the true spirit (*zhēnlíng*) remains within, and in all its manifestations—emerging, concealing, moving, or resting—it is entirely in harmony with Heaven. Hence, it is said: *"All communicate with Heaven’s *qi*."*

Thus, its life is rooted in Five (*wǔ*), yet its *qi* originates from Three (*sān*). The body’s existence relies on the Five Phases (*wǔxíng*) for function, while tracing its origin reveals it arises from the Three *qi*. Hence, it is said: *"Its life is rooted in Five, its *qi* originates from Three."*

The Three *qi* also correspond to the Three Celestial Stems. Therefore, the following text states:

○ *New Annotation*: Examining the ancient teachings of those who harmonize with Heaven, this aligns with *The Treatise on the Circulation of Vital Essence Through Heaven*, though the annotations differ; both should be considered.

Three forms Heaven, three forms Earth, three forms humanity. Not only does humanity arise from the Three *qi*, but the Dao of Heaven and Earth is likewise so. Hence, the *Yì Jīng*’s trigrams—*Qián* and *Kūn* included—are all composed of three.

Three thrice combined, totaling nine, divided into the Nine Wilds, which correspond to the Nine Caverns. The Nine Wilds align with the Nine Caverns in meaning. As the *Ěr Yǎ* states: *"Beyond the city lies the suburbs; beyond the suburbs, the fields; beyond the fields, the pastures; beyond the pastures, the forests; beyond the forests, the marshes; beyond the marshes, the wilderness."* This is what is meant.

○ *New Annotation*: According to the current *Ěr Yǎ*, it states: *"Beyond the city is called suburbs; beyond the suburbs, pastures; beyond the pastures, wilderness; beyond the wilderness, forests; beyond the forests, marshes."* This differs from what Wang [citation] quoted.

Thus, the Four Physical Caverns and Five Spiritual Caverns combine to form the Nine Caverns in correspondence. The Four Physical Caverns are: 1) the head and horns, 2) the ears and eyes, 3) the mouth and teeth, 4) the chest. These are external divisions, hence their names. The Five Spiritual Caverns are: 1) the liver, 2) the heart, 3) the spleen, 4) the lungs, 5) the kidneys. These are internal repositories, hence their names. The so-called Spiritual Caverns are: the liver houses the *hún* (ethereal soul), the heart houses the *shén* (spirit), the spleen houses the *yì* (intent), the lungs house the *pò* (corporeal soul), and the kidneys house the *zhì* (will). Thus, the distinction between the two is made.

○ *New Annotation*: This is the text from *The Illuminated Treatise on the Five *Qi***, differing in emphasis from *The Treatise on the Circulation of Vital Essence Through Heaven*. It also diverges from *The Treatise on the Three Departments and Nine Diagnoses* in its annotations, explaining the theory of Spiritual and Physical Caverns as detailed in *The Treatise on the Three Departments and Nine Diagnoses*.

The Emperor said: *"I have already heard of the convergence of six sixes and nine nines. Master speaks of accumulated *qi* filling the months—pray, what is meant by *qi*? I beg the Master to dispel my ignorance and clarify my doubts!"*

The Emperor said: *"I pray for Your Majesty to expound the essential truths, to reveal what has not yet been heard, and to clarify the hearts of those with doubts and open the ears of those shrouded in ignorance, so that they may comprehend and all attain profound understanding."*

Qī Bó replied: *"This is the secret of the Supreme Daoist Sovereign (Shànggǔ Dìjūn), transmitted by the venerable Master (xiānshī)."* The Supreme Daoist Sovereign refers to the ancient imperial sage. The venerable Master refers to **Yí Dài Jì** (仪贷季), the ancestor’s teacher of Qī Bó, who was the ancient expert in discerning the **color** and **pulse** of the **Eight Winds** (bā fēng). The *Treatise on Transmuting Intent into Qi* (《Yí Jīng Biàn Qì Lùn》) states: *"In the ancient times, the venerable Master **Yí Dài Jì** discerned the **color** and **pulse** of the **Eight Winds**, thereby attaining harmony between the Spiritual and Physical Caverns (shénmíng) and aligning with the unchanging principles of **Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth**, the **Four Seasons**, the **Six Harmonies** (liù hé), and the **Eight Winds**."* This is what is meant.

The Emperor said: *"I pray for Your Majesty to continue expounding this."*

Qī Bó replied: *"Five days are called a **candidate** (hòu), three candidates are called a **phase** (qì), six phases are called a **season** (shí), and four seasons are called a **year** (suì), each following its respective governing principles (zhǔzhì)."* The sun traverses **five degrees** of Heaven each day, hence five days. Three candidates sum to **fifteen days**, the proper duration of a phase. Six phases encompass **ninety days**, which is the proper length of three months, though they may vary, hence the **eighteen candidates** constitute the six phases, called seasons. Four seasons span **three hundred sixty days**, hence they are called a year. Each follows its governing principle, meaning that within a year, the days align with one of the **Five Phases** (wǔxíng) as their governing **qi**, ruling and dominating accordingly. Thus, it is said: *"The Five Movements (wǔyùn) succeed one another, each governing its own, and the final days of the year return in cycles, establishing seasons and distributing phases like an endless ring. The candidates follow the same law."* Hence, it is said: *"If one does not know the excess or deficiency of the yearly **qi**, nor the rise and fall of the **Phases’** vigor and decline, nor the origins of emptiness and fullness, one cannot be a skilled practitioner (gōng)."* The Five Movements refer to the **qi** of the Five Phases, which respond to Heaven’s movements and govern transformations. *Succeed* means to inherit, as a son succeeds a father. The Five Phases’ **qi**, parent to child, governs the entire cycle of the year, perpetually renewing.

*Season* refers to the establishment of **Spring** before its due time. *Phase* refers to the **qi** that governs the **Spring** (túnqì). When the **Spring qi** arrives before its due time, the pulse **qi** also arrives early, hence it is said: *"The season establishes its phase."* A *candidate* refers to the **five degrees** the sun traverses each day, meaning that even within a single candidate, the **Five Phases’ qi** generate in sequence, and any deviation leads to illness. The *Treatise on Transmuting Intent into Qi* states: *"In the ancient times, the venerable Master **Yí Dài Jì** discerned the **color** and **pulse** of the **Eight Winds**, thereby attaining harmony between the Spiritual and Physical Caverns, and aligning with the unchanging principles of **Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth**, the **Four Seasons**, the **Eight Winds**, and the **Six Harmonies**."* This is what is meant. *Skilled practitioner* refers to one adept at cultivation and nourishment (xiūyǎng). It is said: *"Only when one understands this thoroughly can one traverse the world with mastery."* [*New Annotation*: The Master’s commentary states that *"The season establishes its phase"* refers to the **qi** and pulse governing the season before its due time, i.e., the **Spring qi** before **Spring** begins. It is noted that the present text of *The Great Essentials* (《Tài Sù》) lacks this passage. **Yí** (仪) may be an error for **jiù** (就), meaning *"to approach"* or *"to conform"* to.]

The Emperor said: *"The Five Movements begin in cycles, like an endless ring. How do their excesses and deficiencies manifest?"*

Qī Bó replied: *"The Six Phases alternate in succession, each having its own dominion (suǒshèng). The changes of excess and deficiency are their constant principle."* It is said that the changes of excess and deficiency are visible, for this is Heaven’s eternal Dao.

The Emperor said: *"What constitutes balanced **qi**?"*

Qī Bó replied: *"It is the absence of excess."* If one does not deviate from the standard candidates, there is no excess.

The Emperor said: *"What of excess and deficiency? How should they be addressed?"*

Qī Bó replied: *"They are detailed in the *Treatise*."* [*New Annotation*: The Master’s commentary states that the *Treatise on the True Essentials of the Five Organs* (《Yù Jī Zhēn Cáng Lùn Piān》) has already been expounded. However, this passage specifically discusses the excess and deficiency of the **Spring qi** (túnqì), and does not cover the excess and deficiency of the **Five Movements** or balanced **qi**. It should refer to the *Grand Treatise on the Interaction of Qi* (《Qì Jiāo Biàn Dà Lùn》) and the *Treatise on the Five Constant Regulations* (《Wǔ Cháng Zhèng Dà Lùn Piān》), which do detail these matters.]

The Emperor said: *"What is meant by ‘dominion’?"*

Qī Bó replied: *"**Spring** dominates **Late Summer** (Chángxià), **Late Summer** dominates **Winter**, **Winter** dominates **Summer**, **Summer** dominates **Autumn**, and **Autumn** dominates **Spring**—this is the dominion of the Five Phases’ seasons. Each **qi** names its corresponding **Cavern** (zàng)."* **Spring** corresponds to **Wood**, and **Wood** dominates **Earth**; **Late Summer** corresponds to **Earth**, and **Earth** dominates **Water**; **Winter** corresponds to **Water**, and **Water** dominates **Fire**; **Summer** corresponds to **Fire**, and **Fire** dominates **Metal**; and **Autumn** corresponds to **Metal**, and **Metal** dominates **Wood**. This is always so. Within the four seasons, **Late Summer** is added, hence it is said: *"This is the dominion of the Five Phases’ seasons."* **Late Summer** refers to the sixth month, when **Earth** is generated from **Fire** and prolonged within **Summer**, having grown and now ruled, hence **Late Summer**. Each **qi** names its corresponding **Cavern**: the **Wood** of **Spring** internally aligns with the **Liver**; **Late Summer’s Earth** aligns with the **Spleen**; **Winter’s Water** aligns with the **Kidneys**; **Summer’s Fire** aligns with the **Heart**; and **Autumn’s Metal** aligns with the **Lungs**. Hence it is said: *"Each **qi** names its corresponding **Cavern**."* *Names* means *commands* (mìng).

The Emperor said: *"How does one know their dominion?"*

Qī Bó replied: *"One seeks their arrival. All return to the beginning of **Spring**."* The beginning of **Spring** refers to the day of **Spring’s** establishment. **Spring** is the longest of the four seasons, hence all candidates and phases return to the days before **Spring** begins. If they arrive before their due time, this is called **excess** (tàoguò), where they thin the **qi** of what they do not dominate and ride upon the **qi** of what they do dominate, termed **excessive proliferation** (qìyín). Without proper distinction, the perverse **qi** invades internally, and even a skilled practitioner cannot resist. [*These ten characters are disjointed in meaning; they likely result from an ancient textual error.*] The following five characters detail the proper course. They are marked in red ink here.

If they arrive after their due time, this is called **deficiency** (bùjí), where the **qi** of what they dominate acts arbitrarily, and the **qi** of what they generate suffers illness, while the **qi** of what they do not dominate becomes thin. This is termed **constricted qi** (qìpò)."

The so-called **"seeking its arrival"** (qiú qí zhì) refers to the time when **qi** arrives. In general, the arrival of **qi** is always considered to be fifteen days before the **solar term of Spring Begins** (Lìchūn), marking the beginning of the **Five Agents' divination** (wǔháng zhī hòu).

If it arrives **before its due time**, this means the **qi** of the **Agent** it ought to govern has not yet manifested, yet arrives prematurely. When it arrives prematurely, this is **excess qi** (yǒuyú), hence called **excess** (tàoguò). If it arrives **after its due time**, this means the **qi** of the **Agent** it ought to govern has twice failed to arrive, only then appearing belatedly. When it arrives belatedly, this is **deficient qi** (bùzú), hence called **deficiency** (bùjí).

In **excess**, the **qi** of what it ought not to dominate grows thin, while the **qi** of what it ought to dominate proliferates, termed **excessive proliferation** (qìyín). In **deficiency**, the **qi** of what it ought to dominate acts arbitrarily, while the **qi** of what it ought to generate falls ill, and the **qi** of what it ought not to dominate grows thin—this is termed **constricted qi** (qìpò).

As for the **Five Agents' qi** (wǔxíng zhī qì), the **qi** that I dominate is called **what I dominate** (suǒshèng), the **qi** that dominates me is called **what I do not dominate** (suǒbùshèng), and the **qi** that generates me is called **what I generate** (suǒshēng). For instance, if **Liver-Wood** (gān mù) has **excess qi** (yǒuyú), this means **Lung-Metal** (fèi jīn) is deficient. Metal does not restrain Wood, hence Wood is in **excess**. Once Wood-**qi** is excessive, it then reverses to thin **Lung-Metal**, while riding upon **Spleen-Earth** (pí tǔ), hence it is said that **excess** leads to thinning **what I do not dominate** and riding upon **what I dominate**.

All these cases involve the **Five Zang** (wǔzàng) **qi** internally invading and merging, thus causing illness, hence termed **excessive proliferation** (qìyín). The remaining cases of **excess** follow the same principle.

Again, if **Liver-Wood** **qi** is deficient (bùzú), it cannot restrain Earth; Earth-**qi**, unchecked, acts arbitrarily, and Wood is oppressed by Earth, hence it is said that the **qi** of what it ought to dominate acts arbitrarily, while the **qi** of what it ought to generate suffers illness. When **Liver-Wood** **qi** is unbalanced, **Lung-Metal** **qi** naturally grows thin, hence it is said that **what I do not dominate** grows thin. However, when Wood-**qi** is unbalanced, Earth and Metal mutually thin each other, and their mutual oppression leads to illness, hence termed **constricted qi** (qìpò). The remaining cases of **deficiency** follow the same principle.

If one carefully observes its time, the **qi** can be anticipated; if one misses the time and observes in reverse, the **Five Treatments** (wǔzhì) are not distinguished, and perverse **qi** internally invades, making even a skilled practitioner powerless.

By **"time"**, it means the time when the **qi** arrives. Observing the **yearly cycle** (nián) begins at the **solar term of Spring Begins** (Lìchūn), observing the **qi** begins at the fixed **Four Seasons' qi** (sìqì), and observing the **daily cycle** (rì) follows the **divinatory days** (hòurì). Thus, it is said: *"If one misses the time and observes in reverse"* (fǎn hòu qí shí), the **Five Treatments** are not distinguished, and perverse **qi** internally invades, making even a skilled practitioner powerless.

The **Sovereign** (Dì) asked: *"Is there any that does not succeed?"* Meaning, is there any **qi** of the **Five Agents** that does not follow in succession?

**Gūbù** (Qíbó) replied: *"The **Heavenly qi** (cāngtiān zhī qì) cannot deviate from its constancy. If the **qi** does not succeed, this is called **constancy's deviation** (bùcháng). **Constancy's deviation** leads to change.*

By **"change"**, it means the alteration of **Heaven's constancy** (tiān cháng).

The **Sovereign** asked: *"How does deviation lead to change?"*

**Gūbù** replied: *"When change arrives, illness ensues. If the **qi** of what it ought to dominate is weak, while the **qi** of what it ought not to dominate is strong, and if it is further compounded by a perverse **qi**, then death follows. Hence, if it is not its due time, the illness is mild; if it is its due time, the illness is severe."*

This means that when **Heaven** (Tiān) distributes its **qi**, it does not exceed the **Five Agents**; humans exist within this **qi**, so how could they not conform to **Heaven's Way** (tiāndào)? When a person's **qi** is disordered, not aligning with **Heaven's constancy**, this is the cause of illness and death. As *The Zuo Tradition* (Zuo Zhuan) says: *"To defy **Heaven** is inauspicious."* This is of the same category.

For example, if it is the **year of Wood** (mù zhí nián), yet **Fire** **qi** arrives, illness will follow two years later. If **Earth** **qi** arrives, illness will follow three years later. If **Metal** **qi** arrives, illness will follow four years later. If **Water** **qi** arrives, illness will follow five years later. When **True qi** (zhēnqì) is deficient and further compounded by perverse **qi**, the **True qi** internally weakens, hence it is said that when **True qi** is deficient and further invaded by perverse **qi**, death follows.

If it is not the **year of the Agent's reign** (wáng zhí nián), yet the **qi** of the **Five Agents** conflicts, the illness will be mild and prolonged, not causing internal injury to the **Spirit-Stores** (shéncáng), hence it is said that if it is not its due time, the illness is mild and enduring.

If it is the **year of the Agent's reign**, then it is prone to perverse **qi**, hence when it is the **Agent's due time**, the illness becomes severe. All **qi** that arrives in the **year of its Agent's reign** readily invites perverse **qi**, hence it is said that if it is not its due time, the illness is mild; if it is its due time, the illness is severe.

*The Comprehensive Evaluation of the Empty and Full Theory* (Tōngpíng xūshí lùn) states: *"If it is not its due time, it generates [illness]; if it is its due time, it leads to death."* By **"due time"**, it means the **year of the Agent's reign**.

The **Sovereign** said: *"Good."*

I have heard that the **Five Agents' qi** combine to form **shapes** (xíng), and through changes, their names are established. As for the **Heavenly** and **Earthly** circulation (yùn) and the **Yin-Yang** transformations (huà), how do they relate to the myriad things—what is few and what is many? *[The newly corrected text states: "From here, the previous Gūbù's question 'Is it not manifest?' (Zhāohū zāi wèn) is detailed. The Yuan Ji's annotation and *The Grand Essentials* (Tài Sù) both lack this, suggesting it may be a supplement by Wang Shi."*

**Gūbù** replied: *"Your question is profound indeed! **Heaven** is vast beyond measure, **Earth** is vast beyond reckoning. The **Great Spirit** (Dà shén) inquires, and I shall outline its principles."*

This means that **Heaven** and **Earth** are vast and cannot be fully measured or grasped by human understanding, and their transformations are profound and subtle—how could one encompass them with mere human thought? The **Great Spirit** inquires, praising the **Sage's** deep understanding, and thus I speak broadly of the **grand framework** (gāngjì).

Grasses grow in **five colors** (wǔsè), and the **Five Colors'** variations** (wǔsè zhī biàn) are countless. Grasses produce **five flavors** (wǔwèi), and the **Five Flavors'** subtleties** (wǔwèi zhī měi) are boundless.

This means that the myriad things of creation, each inheriting different transformations, are such that even the eyes cannot fully perceive their colors and the mouth cannot fully savor their flavors—how much more so could the human heart encompass them all? People's tastes and desires differ, yet each has their own inclinations.

This means that though the variations of colors and flavors are countless, people's tastes and desires are naturally aligned with what their own hearts love, hence it is said that tastes and desires differ, yet each has their own inclinations.

**Heaven** nourishes humans with the **Five Qi** (wǔqì), and **Earth** nourishes humans with the **Five Flavors** (wǔwèi). **Heaven** nourishes humans with the **Five Qi** in this way: **dryness** **qi** (zàoqì) affects the **Liver**, **scorch** **qi** (jiāoqì) affects the **Heart**, **fragrant** **qi** (xiāngqì) affects the **Spleen**, **rancid** **qi** (xīngqì) affects the **Lungs**, and **putrid** **qi** (fǔqì) affects the **Kidneys**.

Earth nourishes humans with the **Five Flavors** (wǔwèi) in this way: **sour** flavor enters the **Liver**, **bitter** flavor enters the **Heart**, **sweet** flavor enters the **Spleen**, **pungent** flavor enters the **Lungs**, and **salty** flavor enters the **Kidneys**.

The **clear yang** transforms into **qi**, ascending to become **Heaven**; the **turbulent yin** congeals into **flavors**, descending to become **Earth**. Hence, **Heaven** nourishes humans with **qi**, while **Earth** nourishes humans with **flavors**.

The *Discourse on the Correspondence of Yin and Yang* states: The **clear yang** is **Heaven**, the **turbulent yin** is **Earth**. It further states: **Yang** is **qi**, **yin** is **flavor**.

The **Five Qi** enter through the nose, stored in the **Heart** and **Lungs**, ascending to refine the **Five Colors** (wǔsè) and clarify the **Five Sounds** (wǔshēng). The **Five Flavors** enter through the mouth, stored in the **intestines** and **stomach**, where flavors are retained to nourish the **Five Qi**. When the **Five Qi** harmonize, **vital fluids** (jīnyè) are generated, and **spirit** (shén) naturally arises.

The **Heart** manifests in the **complexion** (miànsè), the **Lungs** govern **sound**, hence the **Five Qi** are stored in the **Heart** and **Lungs**, ascending to refine the **Five Colors** and clarify the **Five Sounds**.

**Qi** is the **mother of fluids** (shuǐmǔ), so flavors are stored in the **intestines** and **stomach**, internally nourishing the **Five Qi**. When the **Five Qi** harmonize and transform, **vital fluids** are generated, and **vital fluids** interact with **qi** to form **spirit-qi** (shénqì), enabling life and propagation.

The **Emperor** asked: How do the **inner manifestations** (zàngxiàng) correspond to this?

**Xiàng** refers to what is visible externally and can be observed. **Gūbó** replied:

The **Heart** is the root of **life**, the abode of **spirit** (shén). Its **luster** (huà) appears in the **face**, its **fullness** (chōng) resides in the **blood vessels** (xuèmài). It is the **supreme yang** within **yang**, harmonizing with **summer qi** (xiàqì).

The **Heart** is the **official of the sovereign**, where **spirit** and **clarity** (shénmíng) emanate. For the **sovereign** is the pivot upon which all things thrive or decline, hence it is said that the **Heart** is the root of **life**, the abode of **spirit**.

**Fire qi** ascends upward, so its **luster** appears in the **face**. The **Heart** nourishes **blood**, its **virtue** (dé) lies in the **blood vessels**, hence its **fullness** resides there. The **Heart** rules over **summer**, its **qi** aligning with the **supreme yang**, for the **supreme yang** dwells within the **fire of summer**, hence it is said to be the **supreme yang** within **yang**, harmonizing with **summer qi**.

The *True Sayings of the Golden Chamber* states: From **dawn** (píngdàn) to **midday**, it is **Heaven’s yang**, the **yang within yang**.

---

The **Liver** is the origin of **extreme exertion** (bìjí), the dwelling of **soul** (hún). Its **luster** appears in the **nails**, its **fullness** resides in the **tendons**. It generates **blood-qi**, its flavor is **sour**, and its color is **blue-green**.

The **Emperor** (of **spring**) is the beginning of **growth**, hence it is said that the **Liver** generates **blood-qi**. The *Discourse on the Correspondence of Yin and Yang* states: The **Emperor** generates **wind**, **wind** generates **wood**, and **wood** generates **sour**. The **Liver** aligns with **wood**, hence its flavor is **sour**. It further states: **Spirit** in the **zang** is the **Liver**, in **color** it is **blue-green**. Hence its color is **blue-green**.

For the **minor yang** resides within the **yang** position, ruling over **spring**, hence it is said to be the **yang within yang’s minor yang**, harmonizing with **spring qi**.

The *True Sayings of the Golden Chamber* states: From **dawn** to **midday**, it is **Heaven’s yang**, the **yang within yang**.

The **Newly Corrected Edition** states: Examining the original text by **Quán Yuánqǐ**, as well as *The Canon of the Celestial Stem and Earthly Branch* (*Jǐa-Yǐ Jīng*) and *The Great Essentials* (*Tài Sù*), it reads **"minor yang within yin"**—this should be rendered **"minor yang within yin"**. Further examining **Wang’s** citation of *The True Sayings of the Golden Chamber*, which states: *"From dawn to midday, it is Heaven’s yang, the yang within yang,"* as evidence, it appears **Wang** intended **"minor yang within yang"**. Yet, upon closer inspection of the preceding text—where the **heart** is described as **"major yang within yang"**—**Wang** cites the same passage from dawn to midday as proof. Now, applying this same logic to the **Liver**, he fails to cite *"From cockcrow to dawn, it is Heaven’s yin, the yang within yin,"* as evidence. Thus, **Wang’s** annotation is clearly erroneous, and we should follow **Quán Yuánqǐ’s** original text and *The Canon of the Celestial Stem and Earthly Branch* and *The Great Essentials*, rendering it **"minor yang within yin"** as correct.

The **Spleen**, **Stomach**, **Large Intestine**, **Small Intestine**, **Triple Burner**, and **Bladder** are the origins of the **granaries** and the dwelling of **nutritive qi** (*yíng*), hence they are called **"organs"** (*qì*). They are capable of transforming waste (*zāo pò*), converting flavors, and regulating intake and excretion. All can receive and store, endlessly circulating and transporting—thus they are the origins of the **granaries**, named **"organs"**.

**Nutritive qi** arises from the **middle burner**, where the **Spleen** and **Stomach** reside, hence it is said to be the dwelling of **nutritive qi**. Yet, when water and grain flavors enter the **Spleen** and **Stomach**, the **Spleen** and **Stomach** transform waste while refining their flavors, expelling them through the **Triple Burner** and **Bladder**—thus it is said they *"convert flavors and regulate intake and excretion."*

Its **manifestation** lies in the **four whites of the lips**, its **fullness** in the **muscles**, its flavor **sweet**, its color **yellow**.

The **Newly Corrected Edition** states: These six characters should be omitted, and the forty-character citation from *The Discourse on the Correspondence of Yin and Yang* should also be removed, as they were already explained in the preceding section.

This pertains to the category of **extreme yin**, harmonizing with **earth qi**.

The **mouth** is the **orifice** of the **Spleen**, and the **Spleen** governs **muscles and flesh**, hence it is said that its **manifestation** lies in the **four whites of the lips**, its **fullness** in the **muscles**. The **"four whites"** refer to the white flesh at the four corners of the lips.

*The Discourse on the Correspondence of Yin and Yang* states: The **center** generates **dampness**, **dampness** generates **earth**, and **earth** generates **sweet**. The **Spleen** corresponds to **earth**, hence its flavor is **sweet**. It further states: In the **zang**, it is the **Spleen**; in **color**, it is **yellow**. Hence its color is **yellow**. The **Spleen** harbors **earth qi**, and **earth** aligns with **extreme yin**, thus it is said this belongs to the category of **extreme yin**, harmonizing with **earth qi**.

*The True Sayings of the Golden Chamber* states: **Extreme yin within yin** is the **Spleen**.

All **eleven zang** organs derive their order from the **Gallbladder**. From the **heart** above to the **Gallbladder** below, they number **eleven**. Yet the **Gallbladder**, being central, upright, and unyielding without private deviation, is thus the standard by which the **eleven zang** are arranged in sequence.

Hence, if the **pulse at the chin** (*rén yíng*) is **onefold** in strength, the illness lies in **minor yang**; **twofold**, in **major yang**; **threefold**, in **yang brightness**; and **fourfold or more**, it is **rebellious yang**. This is the **law of the yang pulses**.

**Minor yang** refers to the **Gallbladder pulse**; **major yang**, to the **Bladder pulse**; and **yang brightness**, to the **Stomach pulse**.

*The Spiritual Pivot* (*Líng Shū*) states: *"If the pulse is **onefold** in agitation, it lies in the **hand’s minor yang**; **twofold**, in the **hand’s major yang**; **threefold**, in the **hand’s yang brightness."* The **hand’s minor yang** is the **Triple Burner pulse**; the **hand’s major yang**, the **Small Intestine pulse**; and the **hand’s yang brightness**, the **Large Intestine pulse**.

**"Onefold"** means the **chin pulse** is **onefold** greater than the **wrist pulse** (*cùn kǒu*); the rest follow the same principle. If it is **fourfold or more**, it is the extreme of **yang excess**, hence **rebellion and resistance** occur, and food cannot enter.

*The Treatise on Correct Principles* (*Zhèng Lǐ Lùn*) states: *"Rebellion leads to vomiting."*

If the **wrist pulse** is **onefold** in strength, the illness lies in **jue yin**; **twofold**, in **minor yin**; **threefold**, in **major yin**; and **fourfold or more**, it is **obstructed yin**. This is the **law of the yin pulses**.

**Jue yin** refers to the **Liver pulse**; **minor yin**, to the **Kidney pulse**; and **major yin**, to the **Spleen pulse**.

*The Spiritual Pivot* states: *"If the pulse is **onefold** in agitation, it lies in the **hand’s jue yin**; **twofold**, in the **hand’s minor yin**; **threefold**, in the **hand’s major yin."* The **hand’s jue yin** is the **Pericardium pulse**; the **hand’s minor yin**, the **Heart pulse**; and the **hand’s major yin**, the **Lung pulse**.

The principle of **"fold"** follows that of the **yang pulses**. If it is **fourfold or more**, it is the extreme of **yin excess**, hence **obstruction** occurs, and **urine cannot pass**.

*The Treatise on Correct Principles* states: *"Obstruction means inability to urinate."* **"Urine"** refers to **small urination**.

If both the **chin pulse** and the **wrist pulse** are **fourfold or more** in strength, it is **obstructed rebellion**. The **obstructed rebellion pulse** is **weak**, unable to reach the **Heaven-Earth vital essence**, and thus death ensues.

**"Both strong"** means both exceed the ordinary pulse by **fourfold**. Things cannot endure prolonged excess; when pushed to the extreme, they decline and decay. Hence, if unable to reach the **Heaven-Earth vital essence**, death follows.

*The Spiritual Pivot* states: *"When yin and yang are both excessive, they cannot nourish each other, hence it is called **obstructed rebellion**. The **obstructed rebellion** condition means death before its natural term."*

The **Newly Corrected Edition** states: **"Weak"** (*yíng*) should be rendered **"full"** (*yíng*).

The pulse being **fourfold or more** in strength is not **weak** (*yíng*), but rather **excessive to the extreme**. The ancient text uses **weak** (*yíng*) interchangeably with **full** (*yíng*).

*Huangdi Neijing Suwen* **Supplementary Commentary**, Volume Ten:
Tang **Grand Marshal** *Qixianzi* **Wang Bing’s** **sequential annotations**, **reexamined** by Song **Grand Secretary** *Zhishimi* **Lin Yi** and colleagues, **revised** by Song **Clerk of the Board of War** and **Superintendent of Agriculture** *Sun Zhao* for textual errors.

**Chapter on the Formation of the Five Viscera** **Newly Revised Commentary** reads:

According to this chapter, it is titled *Chapter on the Formation of the Five Viscera* and does not mention *Treatise* (论), for this chapter directly records the matters of the five viscera’s formation, without the question-and-answer discourse found elsewhere. Hence, it does not mention *Treatise*. Later sections that do not mention *Treatise* follow this same principle.

The **heart’s** **affiliation with vessels** (合脉), for **fire-qi** is dynamic and restless, and vessels share this quality of uniformity. The heart’s **visceral correspondence** (藏应) aligns with **fire**, hence its affiliation with vessels.

Its **manifestation of luster** (荣色) is **red**, for fire ascends in brilliance, and its color is red. Hence, its luster appears on the **face** in **red hue**.

**Newly Revised Commentary** states: It is unclear why Wang Bing restricts the **face’s** **luster** to **red**. Generally, all colors visible on the face are manifestations of the heart’s luster, not confined solely to red.

Its **visceral dominion** (主) is the **kidneys**, for the heart **stands in awe** (畏) of the kidneys. **Fire** is subdued by **water**, and **water** is the **kidneys’** **official organ** (官), hence the heart stands in awe of the kidneys.

The **lungs’** **affiliation with skin** (合皮), for **metal-qi** is firm and resolute, and skin shares this quality. The lungs’ visceral correspondence aligns with **metal**, hence their affiliation with skin.

Its **manifestation of luster** is **hair** (毛), for hair attaches to skin and **leather**, hence its external manifestation.

Its **visceral dominion** is the **heart**, for **metal** is subdued by **fire**, and **fire** is the **heart’s** official organ, hence the lungs stand in awe of the heart.

The **liver’s** **affiliation with sinews** (筋), for **wood’s** nature is flexible and straight, and sinews share this quality. The liver’s visceral correspondence aligns with **wood**, hence its affiliation with sinews.

Its **manifestation of luster** is **nails** (爪), for nails are the **remnant** (余) of sinews, hence their external manifestation.

Its **visceral dominion** is the **lungs**, for **wood** is subdued by **metal**, and **metal** is the **lungs’** official organ, hence the liver stands in awe of the lungs.

The **spleen’s** **affiliation with flesh** (合肉), for **earth’s** nature is yielding and thick, and flesh shares this quality. The spleen’s visceral correspondence aligns with **earth**, hence its affiliation with flesh.

Its **manifestation of luster** is the **lips** (唇), for the **mouth** is the spleen’s official organ, hence its luster appears on the lips. The **lips** refer to the **four boundaries** (四际) of **white** hue, not **red**.

Its **visceral dominion** is the **liver**, for **earth** is subdued by **wood**, and **wood** is the **liver’s** official organ, hence the spleen stands in awe of the liver.

The **kidneys’** **affiliation with bones** (合骨), for **water’s** nature is fluid and moist, and **essence-qi** (精气) shares this quality. Bones conduct **marrow** (髓) and **essence**, hence their affiliation with bones.

Its **manifestation of luster** is **hair** (发), for the **brain** is the **sea of marrow** (髓海), and the **kidneys’ qi** governs it, hence its external manifestation in hair.

Its **visceral dominion** is the **spleen**, for **water** is subdued by **earth**, and **earth** is the **spleen’s** official organ, hence the kidneys stand in awe of the spleen.

Thus, excessive consumption of **salt** (咸) causes **vessels to congeal and weep** (脉凝泣) and **complexion to alter** (变色). The heart corresponds with **pork** (豚), and its luster is color. **Salt** benefits the **kidneys**, overpowering the **heart**; when the heart cannot prevail, vessels congeal and weep, and the **facial hue shifts** (颜色变易).

Excessive consumption of **bitter** (苦) causes **skin to wither** (皮槁) and **hair to fall out** (毛拔). The lungs correspond with **skin**, and its luster is hair. **Bitter** benefits the **heart**, overpowering the **lungs**; when the lungs cannot prevail, skin becomes **withered and dry** (枯槁), and hair is shed.

Excessive consumption of **acrid** (辛) causes **sinews to tighten** (筋急) and **nails to wither** (爪枯). The liver corresponds with **sinews**, and its luster is nails. **Acrid** benefits the **lungs**, overpowering the **liver**; when the liver cannot prevail, sinews grow taut and nails dry and wither.

Excessive consumption of **sour** (酸) causes **flesh to develop nodules** (肉胝胜) and **lips to peel** (唇揭). The spleen corresponds with **flesh**, and its luster is the lips. **Sour** benefits the **liver**, overpowering the **spleen**; when the spleen cannot prevail, flesh develops **nodules and excess** (胝胜), and the **lips’ skin peels upward** (揭举). **Nodules** (胝) are pronounced *dīng nǐ qiè*. **Peeling** (揭) is pronounced *cè jiù qiè*.

Excessive consumption of **sweet** (甘) causes **bones to ache** (骨痛) and **hair to fall out** (发落).
The **kidneys** correspond with **bones**, and their luster is **hair**. **Sweet** benefits the **spleen**, overpowering the **kidneys**; when the kidneys cannot prevail, bones ache and hair falls out.
This is how the **Five Flavors** cause harm.

When the **Five Flavors** enter the mouth, they are distributed to the **intestines and stomach**, nourishing the **Five Viscera** internally. Each has its own nourishment and desires; when desires are indulged, they mutually harm one another. Thus, it is said:

The **heart** desires **bitter** (苦), for it aligns with **Fire**.
The **lungs** desire **acrid** (辛), for they align with **Metal**.
The **liver** desires **sour** (酸), for it aligns with **Wood**.
The **spleen** desires **sweet** (甘), for it aligns with **Earth**.
The **kidneys** desire **salty** (咸), for they align with **Water**.
This is how the **Five Flavors** align with the **Five Viscera**.
Each should follow its desire and return to its scent.

The **qi** of the **Five Viscera**—
*(New annotation: According to Quan Yuanqi’s text, this section on the Five Flavors’ alignment belongs with the preceding passage. The *Tai Su* agrees.)*

If the **complexion** appears **green like fresh grass**, death is near.
*(兹, zī—"harsh," referring to the green of newly sprouting grass.)*
If it is **yellow like a persimmon’s rind**, death is near.
If it is **black like coal**, death is near.
*(矣, yǐ—"coal." 良, liáng—"coal," pronounced like "tái.")*
If it is **red like congealed foul blood**, death is near.
*(恤血, xùxuè—"putrid, clotted blood," dark red-black. 恤, xù—pronounced *fāng bēi qiè*.)*
If it is **white like withered bone**, death is near.
*(White and dry, like the whiteness of parched bone.)*
These are the **Five Colors** signaling death.
When the **viscera decay**, these deathly hues appear.
The *San Bu Jiu Hou Lun* states: *"When the Five Viscera decay, their colors must wither (夭)."* *(夭, yāo—"to die young," here meaning "to perish.")* This is what is meant.

If the **complexion** is **green like emerald feathers**, life is near.
If it is **red like a parrot’s crest**, life is near.
If it is **yellow like a crab’s belly**, life is near.
If it is **white like pig fat**, life is near.
If it is **black like crow’s feathers**, life is near.
These are the **Five Colors** signaling life.
All are signs of **luster and moisture**; though their hues may be pleasing, if they appear **dim and swollen**, it is even better.

Thus, it is further said:
Life in the **heart** appears as if wrapped in **white silk with vermilion**.
Life in the **lungs** appears as if wrapped in **white silk with red**.
Life in the **liver** appears as if wrapped in **white silk with green**.
Life in the **spleen** appears as if wrapped in **white silk with yellow like *kuàliú* fruit**.
Life in the **kidneys** appears as if wrapped in **white silk with purple**.
This is the **true** appearance of life’s **external luster**.
*(缟, gǎo—"white silk." 给, jǐ—"thin green silk.")*
The **Five Viscera’s** colors and flavors correspond as follows:
**White** aligns with the **lungs** and **acrid**.
**Red** aligns with the **heart** and **bitter**.
**Green** aligns with the **liver** and **sour**.
**Yellow** aligns with the **spleen** and **sweet**.
**Black** aligns with the **kidneys** and **salty**.
Each aligns with its respective **viscus** in color and flavor.

Thus:
**White** aligns with **skin**,
**Red** with **veins**,
**Green** with **sinews**,
**Yellow** with **flesh**,
**Black** with **bone**.
Each aligns with the **qi** of the **viscus** it nourishes.

All **veins** belong to the **eyes**.
*(Veins are the repositories of blood. The *Xuanming Wuqì Piān* states: "Prolonged gazing harms blood." Thus, it is clear that all veins belong to the eyes.)*
*(New annotation: According to Huangfu Shian, the *Jiǔ Juàn* states: "The heart houses veins; veins harbor the spirit. The spirit illuminates the body, hence it is said they belong to the eyes.")*

All **marrow** belongs to the **brain**.
*(The brain is the "sea of marrow," hence all marrow belongs to it.)*

All **sinews** belong to the **joints**.
*(Sinews, where qi is firm and gathered, all converge between the bones and joints.)*
The *Xuanming Wuqì Piān* states: "Excessive walking harms sinews." Thus, it is clear that all sinews belong to the joints.

All **blood** belongs to the **heart**.
*(Blood resides within the veins and belongs to the heart.)*
The *Bā Zhèng Shénmíng Lùn* states: "Blood and qi are the essence of humanity." Since the spirit is the heart’s master, thus all blood belongs to the heart.

All **qi** belongs to the **lungs**.
*(The lungs store and govern qi.)*

This is the **morning and evening rhythm** of the **Four Limbs and Eight Orifices**.
*(Orifices are the small gatherings of flesh. The Eight Orifices refer to the elbows and knees. Thus, qi, blood, sinews, and veins mutually wax and wane, creating the rhythm of morning and evening.)*

When a person lies down, **blood returns to the liver**.
*(The liver stores blood; the heart circulates it. When a person moves, blood flows through the channels; when still, it returns to the liver’s storage.)*
Why? Because the liver governs the **Sea of Blood**.
The liver receives blood and thus can see.
*(The eyes are the liver’s organ, so the liver receives blood and enables vision.)*
The **feet** receive blood and thus can walk.
*(Qi moves, and blood flows; thus the feet receive blood and enable walking.)*
The **palms** receive blood and thus can grasp.
*(For the function of grasping.)*
The **fingers** receive blood and thus can pick up.
*(For the function of receiving.)*
Since **blood and qi** are the **essence of humanity**, those who receive blood can all function.

If **wind blows over a sleeping person**, blood congealing on the **skin** causes **numbness** (痹).
*(痹, bì—"numbness," pronounced *jīng* or *jūn*.)*
If it congeals in the **veins**, it causes **stagnation** (泣).
*(泣, qì—"stagnation," meaning blood does not flow smoothly.)*
If it congeals in the **feet**, it causes **syncope** (厥).
*(厥, jué—"syncope," meaning the feet reverse their function.)*
These three conditions occur when blood flows but cannot return to its **channels**.
*(Channels are the pathways for blood flow, the great conduits.)*
*(隧, suì—"conduit," pronounced *suì*.)*

Humans have **Twelve Great Valleys**.
*(The great conduits’ gatherings are called "Great Valleys." The Twelve Divisions refer to the twelve meridian pathways.)*

There are **354 minor orifices**, twelve fewer than the total.
*(The minor gatherings of the collaterals are called "minor orifices." If counting 365 minor collaterals, excluding the twelve major junctions, it should be 353. The text states 354 due to a scribal error in transcribing "three" as "four.")*
*(New annotation: According to alternate texts and Quan Yuanqi’s version, the *Tai Su* uses "关" [junctions] instead of "俞" [acupoints].)*

This is where the **Defensive Qi** lingers and stagnates, and where **pathogenic Qi** takes residence.
When Defensive Qi is full and flowing, pathogenic Qi cannot settle.
When Defensive Qi is deficient and stagnates, pathogenic Qi invades—hence the saying, *"where pathogenic Qi takes residence."*

Use **acupuncture and lithotherapy** to purge it.
*"Purge"* (绿) means to **leach and expel** along the meridians.

When pathogenic Qi resides where Defensive Qi stagnates, needling the **collaterals and valleys** will cause it to **leach and flow away** with the pulse.

At the **onset of illness**, the **Five Phases** mark the cycle.
*"Five Phases"* refers to the **Five Zang meridians** as the framework for life and death.

To discern its origin, first establish its **root**—
*"Root"* (母) means the **Seasonal Sovereign Qi** of the time.
First establish the Seasonal Sovereign Qi, then seek the **pathogenic and righteous Qi**.

The so-called *"Five Phases"* are the **Five Meridians**—
That is, the **Five Zang meridians**.

Thus, **headaches and vertex disorders**, with **lower emptiness and upper fullness**, stem from **Foot Minor Yin and Foot Major Yang**; severe cases penetrate the **kidneys**.
**Foot Minor Yin** is the **kidney meridian**.
**Foot Major Yang** is the **bladder meridian**.

The **bladder meridian** arises at the **inner canthus**, ascends the forehead to the vertex;
Its **branching collaterals** descend from the vertex to the **upper ear corner**;
Its **direct course** enters the vertex, networks the brain, descends to branch at the nape, follows the shoulder blade, enters the **paravertebral region**, reaches the **lumbar center**, descends to network the **kidneys**, and connects to the **bladder**.

Since the **kidneys are weak** and cannot draw **Major Yang Qi**, the result is **headaches and vertex disorders**.
When the **meridian disease worsens**, it invades the **Zang**.

**Sudden vertigo, blurred vision, and violent shaking**, with **lower fullness and upper emptiness**, stem from **Foot Minor Yang and Foot Jue Yin**; severe cases penetrate the **liver**.
*"Sudden"* (徇) is **rapid**.
*"Blurred"* (蒙) is **obscured**.
When **vision suddenly fails and shakes violently**, it is **acute illness**.
*"Blindness and deafness"* refers to **gradual illness**.
**Foot Minor Yang** is the **gallbladder meridian**.
**Foot Jue Yin** is the **liver meridian**.

The **Jue Yin meridian** originates from the lower abdomen, ascends beside the stomach, connecting to the liver and networking the gallbladder, piercing the diaphragm, spreading across the ribs, following the posterior aspect of the throat, and entering the **occipital region** (*顽颗*). It then ascends to emerge at the forehead and converges with the **Governor meridian** at the vertex.

Its divergent branch descends from the eye system to encircle the lower cheek.

The **Foot Minor Yang meridian** begins at the **outer canthus** (*目锐毗*), ascends to meet the **corner of the head** (*头角*), descends behind the ear, follows the neck, and enters the **suprascapular fossa** (*缺盆*). Its divergent branch, arising from behind the ear, enters the ear; another branch diverges from the outer canthus, descends to the **mandible** (*顾*), joins the **masseter muscle** (*颊车*), descends the neck, and merges with the pathways below the suprascapular fossa in the chest, piercing the diaphragm, networking the liver, and connecting to the gallbladder.

Now, due to **insufficient qi**, these diseases arise.
○The newly corrected version states: According to Wang's annotation, *"徇蒙"* means "sudden obscuration of vision," but the meaning remains unclear. *"徇蒙"* likely refers to **violent shaking of the eye and facial regions**, accompanied by **frequent, severe spasms** and **dimness**#4. Additionally, the Minor Yang meridian's descent below the forehead (*下额*), in the *Jia Yi Jing* (《甲乙经》), is recorded as *"下颂"* (*descending to the mandible*).

**Occipital region** (*顽颗*):
- *顽* (Hu Lang cut): **occipital bone**
- *颗* (Su Lang cut): **base of the skull**

「**Systematic Connections:**
- *系* (Xī, pronounced *Xī-Dì* cut): **to connect/bind**
- *额* (é): **forehead** (pronounced *quán*)

**Abdominal distension and tightness**, affecting the *jì* (diaphragm region) and flanks, with **inverted rebellion**—where **qi rises from below to assault the eyes**—involving the **Foot Taiyin** and **Foot Yangming** meridians.
- *朕* (zhèn): **the flanks (above the ribs)**
- **Inverted rebellion (下厥上冒)**: **Qi ascending rebelliously from below, overwhelming the eyes.**
- **Foot Taiyin**: **Spleen meridian** (*脾豚*)
- **Foot Yangming**: **Stomach meridian** (*胃脉*)

**Foot Taiyin Meridian** arises from the **inner anterior thigh (股内前康)**, enters the abdomen, connects to the spleen, networks the stomach, and ascends to the *jì* (diaphragm region).
**Foot Yangming Meridian** originates at the **nose**, converges at the **philtrum (频)**, descends along the **external nose**, networks the **chin and jaw (颐颌)**, passes through the **throat**, enters the suprascapular fossa, connects to the stomach, and networks the spleen. Its **direct course** descends from the suprascapular fossa to the **inner thigh (乳内康)**, then to the **inguinal region (侠齐)**, entering the **gas street (气街)**. Its **branching pathway** arises from the **stomach’s lower orifice**, follows the **abdominal flank (腹裹)**, reaching the **gas street** and merging below the **pubic bone (髑)**. Thus, these diseases arise.

- *肚* (dù, *qù-yú* cut): **abdomen**
- *骸* (hái, pronounced *yú*): **pubic bone**

**Coughing with upward-rising qi**, where **inverted rebellion lodges in the chest**, involves the **Hand Yangming** and **Hand Taiyin** meridians.
- **Hand Yangming**: **Large Intestine meridian** (*大肠脉*)
- **Hand Taiyin**: **Lung meridian** (*肺豚*)

**Hand Yangming Meridian** descends from the **anterior edge of the shoulder (肩髑前廉)**, ascends to emerge above the **vertebral junction (柱骨之会)**, enters the suprascapular fossa, networks the lungs, descends to the *jì* (diaphragm region), and connects to the large intestine.
**Hand Taiyin Meridian** originates from the **middle burner (中焦)**, descends to network the large intestine, ascends along the **stomach’s orifice**, reaches the *jì* (diaphragm region), connects to the lungs, and from the lungs’ **system (系)**, emerges horizontally beneath the armpit. Thus, **coughing with upward-rising qi** lodges in the chest.

○ **Newly Corrected Version states:** According to the *Jia Yi Jing* (《甲乙经》), *"厥"* is annotated as **#5 disease**.

**Restlessness of the heart and headache**, where the disease resides in the *jì* (diaphragm region), involves the **Hand Jùyáng** and **Hand Shàoyin** meridians.
- **Hand Jùyáng**: **Small Intestine meridian** (*小肠脉*)
- **Hand Shàoyin**: **Heart meridian** (*心脉*)」

The **Hand Jùyáng Meridian** (Small Intestine) descends from the shoulder, enters the *quēpén* (supraclavicular fossa), networks the heart, follows the throat, descends to the *jì* (diaphragm region), reaches the stomach, and belongs to the small intestine. Its branching divergence ascends from the *quēpén*, follows the neck and cheek, and reaches the *ruìbì* (outer canthus of the eye).

The **Hand Shàoyin Meridian** (Heart) originates from the heart, emerges to belong to the heart’s **system (系)**, descends to the *jì* (diaphragm region), and networks the small intestine.

Thus, **restlessness of the heart and headache** reside in the chest (**#6 disease**).

○ **Newly Corrected Version states:** According to the *Jia Yi Jing* (《甲乙经》), *"chest pain, distended branches, and pain radiating to the waist and back"* are symptoms of the **Hand Shàoyin** and **Hand Tàiyáng** meridians.

Now, the **pulse’s** qualities—**great, small, smooth, rough, floating, and deep**—can be distinguished by the fingers.
- **Small pulse** is fine and minute,
- **Great pulse** is full and expansive,
- **Smooth pulse** flows effortlessly,
- **Rough pulse** moves with difficulty,
- **Floating pulse** appears beneath the fingers,
- **Deep pulse** is only felt upon pressing.
Even if the pulse manifests in countless varied forms, **skilled hands and keen insight** can still distinguish them.

The **five viscera’s symbols** can be inferred through analogy.
- **Symbol (象)** refers to **qi manifestations**.
Though the five viscera are hidden and unseen, their **qi manifestations, nature, and functions** can still be inferred through analogical reasoning.

How so?
- The liver’s symbol is **wood**, manifesting in **curvature and straightness**.
- The heart’s symbol is **fire**, manifesting in **flame and ascent**.
- The spleen’s symbol is **earth**, embodying **stability and tranquility**.
- The lungs’ symbol is **metal**, embodying **rigidity and centrality**.
- The kidneys’ symbol is **water**, embodying **moisture and descent**.

These are the **primary indications of the viscera’s essence**. Their **qi manifestations** vary with circumstances, and those that align with analogous patterns can be inferred accordingly.

The **five viscera’s resonance** can be discerned through perception.
- **Resonance (音)** refers to the **five tones**.
The liver’s tone is *角 (gū)*, the heart’s is *征 (zhēng)*, the spleen’s is *宫 (gōng)*, the lungs’ is *商 (shāng)*, and the kidneys’ is *羽 (yǔ)*—these are their **constant responses**.
Yet when their **mutual overcoming and defeat** occur, and the tones are **absent or excessive**, even those with **acute hearing and keen minds** can still perceive and recognize them through **intuition (#7)**.

The **five colors’ subtle diagnosis** can be observed with the eyes.
- **Color (色)** refers to **hue**.
The liver’s color is **green**, the heart’s is **red**, the spleen’s is **yellow**, the lungs’ is **white**, and the kidneys’ is **black**—these are their **constant hues**.
Yet when their **qi manifestations interact**, and subtle signs of **auspiciousness or inauspiciousness** appear, even those with **clear vision and profound wisdom** can **divine and discern** them.

Those who **harmonize pulse and color** can achieve **complete accuracy**.

- **Green hue** corresponds to a **tight pulse**,
- **Red hue** corresponds to a **hook-shaped pulse**,
- **Yellow hue** corresponds to a **leathery pulse**,
- **White hue** corresponds to a **hair-like pulse**,
- **Black hue** corresponds to a **firm pulse**—these are their **constant color-pulse correlations**.
Yet when **cross-referencing discrepancies and congruities**, and **determining success or failure**, one must **examine with precision and without doubt**, achieving **complete accuracy in every case**. The **diseases of pulse and color** will be exemplified in the following explanations.

When the **red pulse** arrives,
it is **gasping and firm**—diagnosis states: *"There is stagnant qi in the chest, periodically disrupting digestion, named **heart stagnation (心痹)**."*
- **Gasping (喘)** refers to a pulse arriving like sudden **shortness of breath**.
The **viscera reside high**—when diseased, the pulse manifests as **gasping**.
Thus, the **heart and lungs (two viscera #8)** are uniquely mentioned.

**Gasping** indicates **insufficient heart qi**, while **firmness** indicates **excess pathogenic qi**.
The **heart meridian** originates from the **chest**, hence stagnant qi in the chest disrupts digestion.

- **Stagnation (积)** refers to **pathogenic qi accumulation**.
- **Stagnation (痹)** refers to **visceral qi failing to circulate freely**.
One contracts this from **external injury**, or when **overthinking weakens the heart**, allowing **evil to follow (#9)**.
- **Overthinking weakens the heart**, so **external evils seize the opportunity** and settle there.

When the **white pulse** arrives,
it is **gasping and floating**, with **upper insufficiency and lower excess**, **startled by fright**, and there is **stagnant qi in the chest**—**gasping** indicates **insufficiency**, **floating** indicates **lung emptiness**, and **lung insufficiency** is called **heart emptiness**. When the upper is empty, the lower becomes **full and solid**.

Because of its **insufficiency**, one is prone to **fright**, and **qi stagnates in the chest**.
Yet when the **pulse is gasping and floating**, it is **lung (#10) self-insufficiency**.
When **gasping and empty**, it is **heart qi ascending to overwhelm the lungs**, causing **lung heat** and **qi unable to nourish**—named **lung stagnation (#11)**, with **external cold and heat symptoms**.
One contracts this from **excessive drinking leading to internal injury**.
- **Alcohol’s bitter, dry nature** benefits the heart internally, and **drunkenness followed by sexual excess** causes **heart qi to overwhelm the lungs**.

When the **green pulse** arrives,
it is **long and springy from left to right**, with **stagnant qi beneath the heart and in the arms**, named **liver stagnation (肝痹)**.
- **Long and springy pulse** indicates **tightness and tension**; **tension** signifies **cold qi**, and **central dampness** makes it **springy**.
The **liver governs the flanks and ribs**, and is **near the heart**, so **qi accumulates beneath the heart**, also affecting the **head**.
The *Zhènglǐ Lùnmíng Yì* (《正理论脉名例》) states: *"A tight pulse resembles cutting a silk thread."*
- **Springy pulse** means the pulse **rebounds against the fingers from left to right**.
One contracts this from **cold and dampness**, similar to the **law of hernia (疝)**—with **waist pain, cold limbs, and tight head pulse (#12)**.
- **Tight pulse (#13)** indicates **cold**, and **long pulse** indicates **dampness**.
Hernia is also caused by **cold and dampness**, hence *"similar to the law of hernia."*

The **liver pulse** originates from the **foot**, ascends to the **head**, and emerges at the **forehead**, meeting the **Governor Vessel (#14)** at the **apex**.
Thus, when diseased, the **limbs become cold** and the **head aches**.
- **Cold (清)** is also **limbs becoming cold (玲)**.
- **Hernia (疝)** is pronounced *shuān* (所晏切).

When the **yellow pulse** arrives,
it is **great and empty**, with **stagnant qi in the abdomen** and **#15 stagnant pathogenic qi (厥气)**, named **stagnant hernia (厥疝)**.
- **Great pulse** indicates **excess qi**, while **empty pulse** indicates **emptiness**.
When both **qi and emptiness** are present, **spleen qi accumulates in the abdomen**.
If **kidney qi reverses upward**, then it is **stagnant hernia**.
If **kidney qi does not ascend**, then **both are empty**, and **spleen qi accumulates (#15)**.

In **women**, the symptoms are similar—one contracts this when **sudden exertion causes limbs to sweat** and **exposure to wind**.
- **Women’s symptoms are similar**, meaning they share the same **indications**.
Wind **communicates with the liver**, so when **sweating and exposed to wind**, **spleen qi accumulates in the lower abdomen**, causing **bilateral distension (腹两丁)**.

When the **black pulse** arrives,
it is **firm and great above**, with **stagnant qi in the lower abdomen and genitals**, named **kidney stagnation (肾痹)**.

「上」 refers to the **cun-kou pulse** [radial artery at the wrist].
The **kidney governs the lower burner**, so **qi accumulates in the lower abdomen and genitals**.

One contracts this by **bathing in cold water and then going outdoors**.
Moisture injures the lower burner, naturally affecting the **kidney**—how much more so when bathing in cold water and then exposed? How could one avoid illness?

The *Ling Shu Jing* states:
*"Below the midpoint of the body is where moisture resides."*

In general, **five abnormal pulse-color combinations** are signs of **auspicious prognosis**:
- **Face yellow, eyes green**
- **Face yellow, eyes red**
- **Face yellow, eyes white**
- **Face yellow, eyes black**

These are all **not fatal**, for they indicate the presence of **stomach qi**—thus, life is preserved.

**Annotation:** The newly corrected text states that the *Jia-Yi Jing* lacks the term *"奇豚"* (strange pulse).

However, the following **five abnormal pulse-color combinations** are **fatal**:
- **Face green, eyes red** #16
- **Face red, eyes white**
- **Face green, eyes black**
- **Face black, eyes white**
- **Face red, eyes green**

These are all fatal because they lack **yellow**, meaning **stomach qi is absent**.
The **stomach qi** is the foundation of life—
thus, without yellow, death is certain.

**Chapter on the Distinct Functions of the Five Vísceras**
The Yellow Emperor asked: *"I have heard that certain **way-adept practitioners** (方士) claim that the brain and marrow are **vísceras** (藏), while others say the intestines and stomach are **vísceras**, or even **palaces** (府). Their views contradict one another, yet all insist they are correct. I do not know their **Dao/Way** (道), and I wish to hear their reasoning."*

**Annotation:** *Way-adept practitioners (方士)* refers to those who understand the principles of **Daoist** medicine and cosmology. The text describes the conflicting interpretations regarding the classification of organs as **vísceras** (藏) or **palaces** (府), though such distinctions are already addressed in the *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon* (黄帝内经).

Qìbó replied: *"The brain, marrow, bones, blood vessels, gallbladder, and the **uterus** (女子胞) are six entities born from **earth-qi** (地气). They are all stored in the **yīn** (阴) and manifest the attributes of earth, hence they are called **vísceras** (藏) and not **palaces** (府). They are designated as the **‘strange and constant palaces’** (奇恒之府).

The brain merges with marrow, bones, and blood vessels—though named a **palace** (府), it truly aligns with the **‘spiritual storehouses’** (神藏). The gallbladder combines with the liver yet differs from the six **palaces** in its transmission and transformation. The **uterus** (胞), though involved in reception and discharge, receives and stores **precious vital essences** (精气) and discharges them to form the body’s features. When these features discharge, it signifies the culmination of transformation. However, its reception and discharge differ from the six **palaces**, thus it is called a **víscera** (藏) and not a **palace** (府). It is also known as the **‘strange and enduring palace’** (奇怛之府).

The stomach, large intestine, small intestine, **triple burner** (三焦), and bladder are five entities born from **heaven-qi** (天气). Their nature mirrors heaven, hence they are called **palaces** (府) and not **vísceras** (藏). They receive the **impure qi** (浊气) of the five **vísceras**, and are designated as the **‘palaces of transmission and transformation’** (传化之府). These cannot retain substances long—they are merely conduits for transformation and discharge. When water and grain enter the body, their **dregs and waste** (糟粕) undergo transformation and are expelled. They cannot be stored within, only transformed and discharged. Thus, they are called the **‘palaces of transmission and transformation’** (传化之府). The **‘gateway of vital essences’** (魄门) also serves the five **vísceras**, yet water and grain cannot be stored within it.

**Annotation:** *The **‘gateway of vital essences’** (魄门)* refers to the **anal orifice** (肛#1), which internally connects with the lungs.

When it receives transformed substances, it acts as a conduit for the five **vísceras**. Yet water and grain cannot be stored within it.

The five **vísceras** (五藏) store **precious vital essences** (精气) and do not discharge them, hence they are **full** (满) yet cannot be **solid** (实). **Precious vital essences** (精气) constitute **fullness** (满), while water and grain constitute **solidity** (实). Since the five **vísceras** only store **precious vital essences**, they are **full** yet cannot be **solid**.

**Newly corrected text:** *According to the full text of Quán Yuánqǐ (全元起) and the *Jia-Yi Jing* (甲乙经) and *Tài Sū* (太素), **precious vital essences** (精气) should read **‘spiritual vital essences’** (精神).*

The six **palaces** (六府) transmit and transform substances but do not store them, hence they are **solid** (实) yet cannot be **full** (满). This is because they do not store **precious vital essences** (精气), only receiving water and grain.

The reason for this is as follows: when water and grain enter the mouth, the stomach becomes **solid** (实) while the intestines become **empty** (虚)—since they have not yet descended. When food descends, the intestines become **solid** (实) while the stomach becomes **empty** (虚). Thus, it is said that the **palaces** are **solid** yet cannot be **full**, while the **vísceras** are **full** yet cannot be **solid**.

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Why does the **‘gateway of vital essences’** (气口) uniquely govern the five **vísceras**?"*

**Annotation:** *The **‘gateway of vital essences’** (气口)* refers to the **‘cubit inch’** (寸), also known as the **‘pulse gateway’** (脉口). The **cubit inch** (寸) is located at the **‘hand’s fish际’** (手鱼际) behind the **‘same-body cubit’** (同身寸), one **cubit** (寸) from the wrist. It is where one can observe the **‘flourishing and decline of vital qi’** (气之盛衰) and the **‘movement and stillness of the pulse’** (脉之动静).

Qìbó replied: *"The stomach is the **‘sea of water and grain’** (水谷之海), the great source of the six **palaces**. The human body has four **‘seas’** (海), and the **‘sea of water and grain’** (水谷之海) is one of them. Once water and grain are received by the stomach, they nourish the four sides of the body. Since the stomach is the origin of all transmission and transformation, it is the great source of the six **palaces**.

The five **flavors** (五味) enter the mouth and are stored in the stomach, where they nourish the **‘qi of the five vísceras’** (五藏气). The **‘gateway of vital essences’** (气口) is also part of the **hand’s greater yīn** (手太阴) channel.

**Annotation:** *The **‘gateway of vital essences’** (气口)* is where the pulse of the **hand’s greater yīn** (手太阴) channel can be observed.

Thus, the **‘qi and flavors’** (气味) of the five **vísceras** and six **palaces** all originate from the stomach and manifest at the **‘gateway of vital essences’** (气口).

The **Dao/Way of nourishing vital qi** (荣气之道) is that **‘internalized grain becomes solid’** (内谷为实).

**Newly corrected text:** *Upon closer examination, this note originates from the *Língshū* (灵枢), with **‘solid’** (实) corrected to **‘treasure’** (宝).*

When grain enters and is received by the stomach, **vital qi** (气) is transmitted to the lungs. The **‘specialized precious vital essences’** (精专) follow the lung’s **vital qi** (气) and travel to the **‘gateway of vital essences’** (气口), hence it is said that their changes manifest at the **‘gateway of vital essences’** (气口).

**Newly corrected text:** *According to the full text of Quán Yuánqǐ (全元起), **‘out’** (出) should read **‘enter’** (入).*

Thus, the five **vital qis** (五气) enter the nostrils and are stored in the heart and lungs. When the heart and lungs are diseased, the nostrils become obstructed.

In treating illness, one must always examine its **‘root’** (下), adjust the pulse, observe the patient’s **‘intentions and will’** (志意), and align with their disease.

**Annotation:** *The **‘root’** (下)* refers to the **‘feasibility of treatment as seen below the eyes’** (目下所见可否).

To regulate the **‘flourishing and decline of the pulse’** (脉之盈虚), to observe the **‘correctness or deviation of intentions and will’** (志意之邪正), and to determine the **‘appropriateness of treatment based on the depth, shallowness, or prognosis of the disease’** (病深浅成败之宜), one must then adhere to the principles of treatment.

**Newly corrected text:** *According to the *Tài Sū* (太素), this should read: **‘In treating illness, one must examine both its upper and lower aspects, adjust the pulse and observe, and consider the patient’s intentions and will, along with their disease’s capacity for recovery’** (凡治病必察其上下，适其脉候，观其志意，与其病能).*

Those who are **‘obsessed with ghosts and spirits’** (拘於鬼神) cannot be spoken to about **‘the ultimate virtue/power’** (至德). When **‘intentions and will are deviant’** (志意邪), they favor **‘dissecting and praying’** (析祷). Speaking of **‘ultimate virtue/power’** (至德) would conflict with their beliefs, hence they cannot be addressed on this matter.

Those who **‘abhor acupuncture and lithotomy’** (恶於针石) cannot be spoken to about **‘the ultimate skill’** (至巧). If they detest acupuncture and lithotomy, then **‘skill cannot be applied’** (巧不得施), hence it is said they cannot be spoken to about **‘ultimate skill’** (至巧).

**Annotation:** *Abhor (恶), pronounced wū.*

If a patient **‘refuses treatment’** (病不许治), their illness will not be cured, and treatment will be futile. If the patient’s heart **‘does not allow treatment’** (不许人治之), they will surely die again. If one **‘forcibly treats’** (强为治), the treatment will also fail, hence it is said that the treatment will be futile.

**Chapter on the Appropriateness of Diverse Treatments**
The Yellow Emperor asked: *"When physicians treat the same disease, their methods differ, yet all achieve recovery. Why is this?"*

**Chapter on the Appropriateness of Diverse Treatments (Continued)**

*"Different"* refers to acupuncture, lithotomy, moxibustion, cupping, toxic medicines, and **导引** (guided exercises) with massage.

**Qī Bó** replied: *"This is due to the terrain’s natural influence. It follows the principles of Heaven and Earth’s growth, decline, and the dynamics of elevation, depression, dryness, and moisture."*

Thus, the eastern domain is where Heaven and Earth first generate life—it follows the energy of spring. Regions abundant in fish are near the sea and rivers, benefiting from marine resources. *"Hán"* (滨) means the water’s edge. People live close to their livelihoods. The locals eat fish and crave salt, finding contentment in their dwellings, delighting in their food, and flourishing in their prosperity. Thus, they dwell in ease. They indulge in flavors, so their food is exquisite.

Fish generates internal heat, while salt overpowers the blood. Fish-induced sores confirm internal heat, and salt-induced thirst reveals blood depletion. Thus, their people are dark-skinned with sparse hair, and their ailments are mostly **瘫疡** (ulcers and abscesses). With weak blood and excess heat, they are prone to ulcers. Their treatment should use **砭石** (stone acupuncture). *"Phian shí"* refers to using stone as needles. The *Shān Hǎi Jīng* states: *"On Gāo Shì Mountain, there is a stone like jade, which can be made into needles."* This is **砭石**. *(New annotation: "伐" is an alternate reading for "氏.")* Thus, **砭石** originates from the east, and easterners still use it today.

The western domain is where gold, jade, and deserts lie—where Heaven and Earth gather and contract, following autumn’s energy. *"Yǐn"* means to draw inward, causing contraction. The people live in elevated dwellings and endure much wind, with harsh water and soil. *(New annotation: The terrain is high in the west, so dwellings are elevated, hence the wind. It should not be "resembling hills.")* They wear coarse cloth and grass mats, eat rich, fatty foods, and avoid silk and cotton. *"Hè"* refers to coarse cloth, and *"jiàn"* refers to fine grass. *"Huá"* means fresh and sumptuous—dairy, meat, and the like. Since their diet is rich, their bodies grow fat. Thus, pathogens cannot harm their forms, and their diseases arise internally. With strong water and soil, fatty diets, and sealed skin, their blood and qi are abundant, so pathogens cannot penetrate. *"Nèi"* refers to excesses in emotions—joy, anger, sorrow, worry, fear—and imbalances in diet, sex, and labor. *(New annotation: "思" is correct, as noted in the *Yīn-Yáng Yìng Xiàng Dà Lùn* commentary.)* Their treatment should use **toxic medicines**, which can attack the disease. Given their robust blood and qi, firm muscles, rich diets, and strong terrain, their illnesses suit toxic remedies to subdue them. *"Yào"* refers to herbs, plants, insects, fish, and beasts—all capable of dispelling disease. Thus, **toxic medicines** also originate from the west, and westerners still revere them.

The northern domain is where Heaven and Earth conceal and store—its land is high and windy, with biting cold and frost, following winter’s energy. The people prefer wilderness living and rely on dairy. Cold accumulates in the organs, causing **满病** (distention illnesses). *(New annotation: The *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng* lacks the character "满.")* Their treatment should use **moxibustion and cupping**. Fire and moxa cauterization are called **灸炉** (*jiǔ lú*). Thus, **moxibustion and cupping** also come from the north, and northerners practice them faithfully.

The southern domain is where Heaven and Earth nurture and yang flourishes—its land is low, with weak soil and dense mist, following summer’s energy. Low terrain causes water to gather, making the soil weak and mist to accumulate. The people crave sour foods and eat simple meals. *(New annotation: Quán Yuánqǐ states it refers to fish.)* Thus, their skin is smooth and ruddy. Their ailments are **挛痹** (spasms and numbness). Sour flavors contract, making their flesh dense. With excess yang, their skin turns red. Internal dampness and external heat cause tendons to contract and meridians to stagnate. Their treatment should use **fine acupuncture**. *"Wēi"* means subtle and small. Fine needles regulate deficient or excessive pulses. Thus, the **nine needles** also originate from the south, and southerners hold them in high regard.

The central domain is flat and moist, where Heaven and Earth generate myriad creatures—it follows the principle of Earth’s virtue, hence abundant life. Yet the east is by the sea, the south is low, the west and north are high, so the central land is flat and damp, differing in terrain and thus in disease. The people eat varied foods without labor, as the four directions converge and all things gather. Thus, their diseases often involve **痿厥寒热** (wasting, fainting, cold, and heat). Dampness below causes weakness, gasping, and cold-heat disorders. The *Yīn-Yáng Yìng Xiàng Dà Lùn* states: *"Earth’s dampness—[unclear character]—harms skin, flesh, tendons, and meridians."* Proximity to dampness causes this. Their treatment should use **导引 and massage**. *"Dǎo yǐn"* means moving tendons and joints. *"Àn"* means pressing skin and flesh. *"Jiāo"* means agilely lifting limbs. Thus, **导引 and massage** also emerge from the center, serving as the proper Dao for nurturing the spirit and regulating qi. Therefore, the Sage combines these methods appropriately, each suited to its place. Following the terrain, each finds its proper use—only the Sage’s principles can achieve this. Hence, though treatments differ, all diseases are cured because the essence of the illness is understood, and the broad principles of treatment are known. This is the Dao of **"reaching nature’s essence and embracing its transformations."**

**Chapter on Moving Essence and Transforming Qi**
The Yellow Emperor asked: *"I have heard that ancient physicians treated disease by moving essence and transforming qi, achieving cures through incantations. Today, physicians use toxic medicines for internal ailments and acupuncture/lithotomy for external ones—sometimes they succeed, sometimes they fail. Why is this?"*

**Chapter on Moving Essence and Transforming Qi** (continued)

**Moving** refers to **transposing**; **transforming** refers to **altering**. Both methods ensure that **evil does not harm the upright**, while **shen-spirit** is restored and **inner harmony** is maintained.

The *Treatise on the Generation of Vital Qi and Its Communication with Heaven* states:
*The Sage transmits shen-spirit and aligns with Heaven’s qi.*

The *Treatise on the True Essence of the Upper Ancients* states:
*When shen-spirit is preserved within, how can disease arise?*

**Ghi-Bo** replied:
*In the ancient past, people dwelled among beasts, their movements shifting to avoid cold, their retreats shielding them from heat. Within, they bore no burden of affectionate attachments; without, they assumed no form of worldly ambition. Thus, this was an era of tranquil repose, where evil could not penetrate deeply. Hence, toxic medicines could not cure their internal ailments, and acupuncture/lithotomy could not cure their external ones—so transposing essence and invoking the Way’s transformations could suffice.*

*Ancient dwellers lived in nests and caves, hiding at dusk and roaming at dawn among beasts. Their behavior was clear to observe. Yet, when their movements grew restless and yang-energies flourished, their bodies burned hot to repel cold. When yin-energies birthed chill, their retreats could ward off summer’s heat.*

*If the will abandons all thought, then within, there is no burden of spring’s yearning; if the heart lacks desires, then without, there is no form of worldly ambition. In stillness, one preserves Heaven’s true essence, and evil cannot prevail. Thus, by transposing essence and transforming qi, no reliance on toxic medicines is needed; by invoking the Way’s transformations, no labor with acupuncture/lithotomy is required.*

**New Annotation:** *According to Quán Yuánqǐ’s text, "祝由" (zhu-yóu) refers to the southern deity. [#2] But in today’s world, it is not so. Emotional attachments and desires are distant from the Dao.*

「When worries and afflictions green within the body, and bitter forms harm its exterior, one also loses alignment with the four seasons, defying the natural suitability of cold and heat. Harmful winds strike frequently, and void pathogens assail day and night. Within, they penetrate the five *zàng* organs and bone marrow; without, they damage the hollow cavities and skin. Thus, minor ailments become severe, and major ailments lead to death—so *zhu-yóu* rituals prove insufficient to cure them.

The Emperor said: *"Well spoken."*

I wish to examine the sick, observe life and death, and resolve ambiguous cases. I desire to know their essential principles, as bright as the sun and moon—may I be permitted to hear them?

Qí Bō replied: *"The study of color and pulse is what the Celestial Sovereigns hold in highest esteem, and what my predecessors have transmitted."* The Celestial Sovereigns refer to the Emperors of antiquity. My predecessors refer to Qí Bō’s ancestral teachers, such as Yí Dài Jì Shì.

In antiquity, Yí Dài Jì Shì harmonized the study of color and pulse to grasp the divine luminosity, uniting them with the five phases—metal, wood, water, fire, and earth—and the four seasons, eight winds, and six *hé* correspondences. This practice never strayed from its natural order. My predecessors taught that a white complexion and hair-like pulse align with metal and correspond to autumn; a green complexion and taut pulse align with wood and correspond to spring; a black complexion and stony pulse align with water and correspond to winter; a red complexion and surging pulse align with fire and correspond to summer; a yellow complexion and slow pulse align with earth and correspond to late summer and the four seasons. With these color-pulse patterns, they matched the five phases below with the essential *wáng* constitution, and above, they harmonized with the cyclical flow of the four seasons. Thus, the questions of the six *hé* correspondences and the disturbances of the eight winds never diverged from their expected course, and all could be anticipated.

How? By observing their transformations and discerning them accordingly.»

Thus, the lower text states: *"When transformations and shifts occur, one must observe their subtleties and discern their essence. To know their essence, one examines the color-pulse patterns. It is said: ‘The method by which one knows the shifting transformations of the four seasons and five phases is through these color-pulse patterns.’*

*‘The colors respond to the sun, the pulses to the moon; if one constantly seeks their essence, then their essence will be revealed.’*
*‘It is said that the pulses respond to the moon and the colors to the sun, serving as the standard for forecasting and timing.’*

*‘If one constantly seeks the discrepancies in color-pulse, this is the key to diagnosing the common patient.’*
*‘The shifting transformations of colors, which align with the seasonal pulses, are what the Celestial Sovereigns#5 hold most precious, harmonizing with the divine clarity, thus enabling one to ward off death and draw near to life.’*
*‘By observing the color-pulse patterns of the hidden organs, one understands the signs of life and death, and thus can always avoid death and draw close to life.’*

*The Dao of longevity is eternal; the term for it is ‘Holy Sovereign.’*
*‘The Celestial Sovereigns, upon hearing the Dao, diligently practice it, thereby extending the Dao of longevity—this is what the Holy Sovereigns consistently employ.’*

*In the mid-period of antiquity, diseases were treated as they arose: with decoctions over ten days to dispel the maladies of the eight winds and five types of stiffness.*
*The eight winds refer to the winds from the eight directions.*
*The five types of stiffness refer to stiffness in the sinews, muscles, tendons, bones, and vessels.*
*The *Línggū Jīng*#2 says:*
*‘When wind comes from the east, it is called the *Yīngxiōng* wind; it harms the person externally at the sinew joints and internally lodges in the liver.’*
*‘When wind comes from the southeast, it is called the *Ruò* wind; it harms the person externally at the muscles and internally lodges in the stomach.’*
*‘When wind comes from the south, it is called the *Dàruò* wind; it harms the person externally at the vessels and internally lodges in the heart.’*
*‘When wind comes from the southwest, it is called the *Móu* wind; it harms the person externally at the flesh and internally lodges in the spleen.’*
*‘When wind comes from the west, it is called the *Gāng* wind; it harms the person externally at the skin and internally lodges in the lungs.’*
*‘When wind comes from the northwest, it is called the *Zhé* wind; it harms the person externally at the vessels of the hand’s *Tàiyáng* channel and internally lodges in the small intestine.’*
*‘When wind comes from the north, it is called the *Dàgāng* wind; it harms the person externally at the bones and internally aligns with the kidneys.’*
*‘When wind comes from the northeast, it is called the *Xiōng* wind; it harms the person externally at the armpits and ribs and internally lodges in the large intestine.’*

*Additionally, the *Bì Lùn*#6 says:*
*‘Those injured by wind in spring (days *Jiǎ* and *Yǐ*) are afflicted with sinew stiffness; those injured by wind in summer (days *Bǐng* and *Dīng*) are afflicted with vessel stiffness; those injured by wind in late summer (days *Wù* and *Jǐ*) are afflicted with flesh stiffness; those injured by wind in autumn (days *Gēng* and *Xīn*) are afflicted with skin stiffness; those injured by wind in winter (days *Rén* and *Guì*) are afflicted with bone stiffness; and those afflicted in the extreme yin are afflicted with muscle stiffness—these are the so-called maladies of the eight winds and five types of stiffness.’*
*The new corrected edition states:*
*‘Upon reviewing this annotation referencing the *Bì Lùn*, the current text does not match thus. It should read: The *Fēng Lùn*#6 says:*
*‘Those injured by wind in spring (days *Jiǎ* and *Yǐ*) are afflicted by the *Jiān* wind; those injured by wind in summer (days *Bǐng* and *Dīng*) are afflicted by the *Xīn* wind; those injured by wind in late summer (days *Wù* and *Jǐ*) are afflicted by the *Pí* wind; those afflicted by wind in autumn (days *Gēng* and *Xīn*) are afflicted by the *Fèi* wind; those afflicted by wind in winter (days *Rén* and *Guì*) are afflicted by the *Shèn* wind.’*
*The *Bì Lùn* says:*
*‘When the three *qi*—wind, cold, and dampness—combine and strike, the resulting stiffness is categorized as follows: those afflicted in winter are afflicted with bone stiffness; those afflicted in spring are afflicted with sinew stiffness; those afflicted in summer are afflicted with vessel stiffness; those afflicted in extreme yin are afflicted with muscle stiffness; and those afflicted in autumn are afflicted with skin stiffness. If the stiffness persists beyond ten days, treatment involves the branches of *Cǎosuō* (pericarpium perillae) and *Cǎodiē* (radix angelicae pubescentis), using both root and branch for assistance. Once the root and branch are obtained, the pathogenic *qi* submits.’*
*‘*Cǎosuō* refers to the decoction of the herb; *cǎohuáng* (草黄) refers to the herb’s roots; and *jī* (技) refers to its stems. It is said that all herbs—whether roots, stems, branches, flowers, or fruits—are used in decoctions. If the decoction fails to dispel the illness, all parts are employed, hence the phrase *“root and branch for assistance.”*’
*‘Once the root and branch are obtained, the pathogenic *qi* submits’ means that when the practitioner and the patient align in treatment, the pathogenic *qi* will readily submit and follow the seasonal rhythms.’*
*The *Tāngyè Qǐlì Lùn*#1 says:*
*‘The disease is the root, the practitioner is the branch; if root and branch are not properly aligned, the pathogenic *qi* will not submit. This is the case where the practitioner and patient do not correspond.’*
*The new corrected edition states:*
*‘Upon reviewing the full text of *Quán Yuánqǐ*, it should read: *“Obtaining the root and branch, the pathogenic *qi* will scatter.”*’*

*However, in the later generations, disease treatment was not thus. They did not base treatment on the four seasons, nor did they observe the sun and moon, nor did they discern the principles of *nì* and *cóng* (逆从).*
*The *qi* of the four seasons each has its own domain; if one does not base treatment on its proper season but instead attacks it recklessly, this is contrary to the ancient ways.’*
*The *Sìshí Cì Nì Cóng Lùn*#2 says:*
*‘In spring, the *qi* resides in the channels and vessels; in summer, it resides in the *sūn*#7 collaterals; in late summer, it resides in the muscles and flesh; in autumn, it resides in the skin; and in winter, it resides in the bone marrow. The practitioner should follow these locations and attack the pathogenic *qi* accordingly.’*
*‘Not observing the sun and moon’ means that the sun has cold, warm, bright, and dark variations, and the moon has waxing, full, waning, and deficient phases.’*
*The *Bāzhèng Shénmíng Lùn*#1 says:*
*‘In general, the method of acupuncture follows the resonance of the sun, moon, stars, four seasons, and the eight *zhèng*#8 principles of *qi*. Only when the *qi* is settled should one proceed with acupuncture.’*
*‘Thus, when the sky is warm and the sun is bright, the blood and body fluids rise, and the defensive *qi* floats, making blood easy to draw and *qi* easy to move.’*
*‘When the sky is cold and the sun is dark, the blood congeals and stagnates, and the defensive *qi* becomes sluggish.’*
*‘At the beginning of the month, the blood and *qi* are fresh, the defensive *qi* is firm and moves smoothly.’*
*‘When the moon reaches fullness, the blood and *qi* are abundant, and the muscles and flesh are firm.’*
*‘When the moon is waning, the muscles and flesh weaken, the channels and collaterals become empty, the defensive *qi* departs, and the form stands alone.’*
*‘Therefore, one must adjust the blood and *qi* according to the heavenly seasons.’*

Thus, when the sky is cold, do not puncture; when warm, do not let the blood congeal. When the moon is waxing, do not draw blood; when full, do not supplement. When the moon is waning, do not treat—this is called adjusting in accordance with the proper time.

Follow the sequence of Heaven, observing the times of abundance and emptiness, shifting light to determine position, and standing upright in proper alignment to await the moment.

Therefore it is said: When the moon is waxing and blood is drawn, this is called *zàng xū* (organ emptiness). When the moon is full and supplementation is applied, the blood and *qi* overflow, the collaterals bleed, and this is called *chóng shí* (excessive repletion).

When treatment is applied during the waning moon, this is called *luàn jīng* (disordering the channels). When yin and yang are confused, true and false pathogens are indistinguishable, and the treatment is prolonged, the exterior becomes empty while the interior is disordered, and licentious pathogens arise—this is what is meant.

Not discerning whether to act in accordance or opposition is to fail to measure whether the disease can be treated or not. Therefore, the text continues:

When the disease’s form has already taken shape, yet one wishes to use fine needles to treat the exterior and decoctions to treat the interior, this is because the mind and intention are crude and unrefined, lacking precision.

Crude practitioners, reckless in their actions, assume they can attack the disease, so that while the old illness has not yet abated, new illnesses arise.

*Crude* means crude and unrefined. *Reckless* means failing to consider whether the course of action is appropriate.

How do we know this? Suppose a starving person, whose form and *qi* are weak and deficient, is forced to eat to extreme fullness—how could they not fall gravely ill? Is it that the food itself is evil? Rather, it is because the timing was lost and the measure exceeded.

If not acting in accordance with the disease’s nature, and if acupuncture, stones, and decoctions are applied at the wrong time or in excessive measure, then the harm only increases.

[New annotation:] The revised text reads: *"害"* instead of *"霍"* (harm instead of sudden collapse).

The Emperor said: I wish to hear the essential Dao.

Qibo replied: The essential principle of treatment is to never lose sight of color and pulse, to apply them without confusion, and to uphold the great standard of treatment.

*Confusion* means bewilderment. *Standard* means principle. The responses of color and pulse are clear and unerring; if one follows them without disordering the sequence of treatment, this is the great law of accurately treating disease.

If one acts contrary to the proper sequence—whether in accordance or opposition—and fails to grasp the root and branch, one loses the vital *shén* and imperils the state.

*Acting contrary to the proper sequence* means reversing what should be followed. *Failing to grasp the root and branch* means the practitioner and the disease are mismatched.

To act against reason is wrong; not only does the patient’s *shén* and *qi* suffer, but if such a person were to assist a ruler, the state’s fate would also be imperiled.

Only by abandoning the old and embracing the new can one attain the True Person.

If the root and branch are mismatched and the practitioner and disease are ill-suited, then one must dismiss those who act against reason and seek those who are newly enlightened, thereby obtaining a truly profound and awakened person to preserve oneself.

The Emperor said: I have heard this essential principle from you, Master. You spoke of never departing from color and pulse—this is what I already know.

Qibo said: The ultimate principle of treatment lies in *one* thing.

The Emperor said: What do you mean?

Qibo said: *One* means to follow what is obtained through inquiry.

To inquire and thereby obtain the truth.

The Emperor said: How so?

Qibo said: When treating a patient, close the doors and windows, repeatedly question their condition, and follow their intentions. Ask what they desire and discern the truth from falsehood.

He who attains the *shén* thrives; he who loses it perishes.

The Emperor said: Excellent.

*The Yellow Emperor’s Inner Classic, Plain Questions, Supplementary Commentary, Volume Twelve*

**The Treatise on Decoctions and Fermented Liquors**

The Emperor asked: How should one prepare decoctions for the Five Grains and fermented *li* (fermented grain beverages)?

*Li* refers to clear decoctions.
*Jia li* (嘐醴) refers to alcoholic beverages.

Qibo replied: One must use rice, cook it with rice-fuel, for rice is *complete* (完全) and rice-fuel is *firm* (坚).

*Firm* means to provide its strength and vigor.
*Complete* means to take its full integrity.

When *complete*, the liquor becomes clear and bright;
when *firm*, the *qi* is swift and the effect is rapid.

The Emperor said: Why so?
(Meaning: *How is it that* the complete and firm [qualities] can yield such results?)

**The Treatise on Decoctions and Fermented Liquors**

Qibo replied: This is because it harmonizes with the *and* (和) of Heaven and Earth, and suits the *yì* (宜) of high and low [principles]. Thus it can achieve ultimate *completeness* (至完); it is harvested at the proper time, hence its ultimate *firmness* (至坚). Rice, being born from the essence of yin-water, wears the *qi* of Heaven’s yang as its crown, the two in perfect accord, thus transforming into its refined form—that is why it is said to obtain the harmony of Heaven and Earth and achieve ultimate *completeness*. The autumn *qi* is sharp and incisive, frost and dew congeal; rice is gathered in winter—that is why it is said to be harvested at the proper time and thus achieve ultimate *firmness*.

The Emperor asked: Why did the sages of antiquity prepare decoctions and fermented *li* but never used them themselves?

Qibo replied: The sages of antiquity, in creating decoctions and fermented *li*, did so only to provide for future needs. They pitied the living beings, first preventing diseases from arising, and established these methods to prepare for unforeseen circumstances.

In the age of antiquity, when they made decoctions and fermented *li*, they did so only for readiness, never for personal use. The sages did not treat already manifest illness but instead prevented disease before it arose—that is why they prepared only for future use and never consumed them themselves. In the middle ages, *Dao/Way* and *virtue/power* (道德) declined somewhat, and pathogenic *qi* (邪气) grew frequent, yet when taken, these remedies were fully effective. Though *Dao/Way* and *virtue/power* had declined, the mind still remained close to the *Dao*—that is why, even when consumed, the remedies were fully effective.

The Emperor asked: Why is it not necessary to use them in the present age?

Qibo replied: In the present age, one must use poisonous medicines to attack the interior and metallic tools, needles, and *moxibustion* (针石镜艾) to treat the exterior. The methods differ from those of ancient times.

The Emperor asked: When the body is exhausted, the blood is depleted, yet no cure is established—why is this?

Qibo replied: The *shén* (神) does not cooperate.

The Emperor asked: What does it mean for the *shén* not to cooperate?

Qibo replied: Needles and metallic tools are the *Dao/Way*. The *shén* cannot harness the marvelous effects of needles and metallic tools. Why? Because the patient’s will and intent conflict with those of the physician. When the patient’s *shén* (神) and intent do not align, the illness cannot be cured. The patient’s actions stray from the *Dao*, and their vital essence is dissipated—that is why.

*(New annotation:)* According to the *Quán Yuánqǐ* (全元起) text, it reads: "When the *shén* (神) advances and the intent is steadfast, the illness can be cured." The *Tài Sù* (太素) states: "When the *shén* (神) falters and the intent is scattered, the illness cannot be cured." Now the patient’s essence is ruined and the *shén* has departed, and the *róngwèi* (荣卫) cannot be restored. Why? Because their desires are insatiable, and their worries never cease. The vital essence is drained and dissipated, the *róngwèi* (荣卫) are depleted—that is why the *shén* departs and the illness does not heal.

The *shén* (神) is the source of life; the *róngwèi* (荣卫) are the masters of *qi*. When the master of *qi* fails to support, and the source of life is further consumed, the *shén* cannot dwell within, and how can the illness be cured?

The Emperor asked: When an illness first arises, it is extremely subtle and refined, and must first lodge in the *jié* (结) of the skin. Now, even skilled physicians say: If the illness is already named *nì* (逆), then needles and metallic tools cannot treat it, and even the finest medicines cannot reach it. Yet skilled physicians all grasp the methods, adhere to the principles, and daily hear the voices of distant and near relatives, see their appearances with their own eyes—why does the illness not heal?

*(New annotation:)* According to another manuscript, "暇" (*xiá*) is likely a miscopy for "谓" (*wèi*).

Qibo replied: The illness is the root; the physician is the branch. If root and branch are not aligned, the pathogenic *qi* will not submit—that is why. The physician and the illness are not in accord. Some physicians are relatives, brothers, or well-versed in the art, yet they hesitate and do not act. The physician must first recognize the illness thoroughly; mere knowledge of formulas is not sufficient. The marvels of needles and *moxibustion* cannot be fully utilized, and the attack of medicines and metallic tools is not preemptive. Even if the *Dao/Way* is clear and all methods are applied, the illness refuses treatment—what is the use in curing?

The *Wǔ Zàng Bié Lùn* (五藏别论) states: Those who are bound by superstitions cannot be spoken to of ultimate *virtue/power* (至德). Those who are averse to needles and metallic tools cannot be spoken to of ultimate skill. When an illness refuses treatment, it is as if the illness itself is not being treated, and treatment yields no effect. This is all because the physician and the illness are not in accord, and the pathogenic *qi* does not submit. Is it only needles and *moxibustion* that have such aversion? Medicines and metallic tools also have this flaw.

*(New annotation:)* According to the *Yí Jīng Biàn Qì Lùn* (移精变气论), it states: "When root and branch are obtained, the pathogenic *qi* will submit."

The Emperor asked: What of those illnesses that do not originate from the *háomáo* (毫毛), yet the yang of the Five *Zàng* (藏) is exhausted?

*(New annotation:)* According to the *Quán Yuánqǐ* (全元起) text and the *Tài Sù* (太素), "阳" (*yáng*) is likely a miscopy for "伤" (*shāng*), yet the meaning remains consistent.

Their *jīn yè* (津液) are abundant within the *guō* (郭), yet their *pò* (魄) dwells alone. The *shén* (神) is isolated within, while the *qi* is dissipated outward. The body cannot be preserved as one’s own, and this is when the Four Extremities’ pulses are severely urgent and the cough is internal. Such cases are when the *qi* resists within while the body swells outward—how should they be treated?

*"Not from the háomáo"* means the illness originates within. When yin-*qi* is excessive internally and yang-*qi* is utterly depleted, it cannot enter the abdomen—that is why it is said that the yang of the Five *Zàng* is exhausted.

*Jīn yè* (津液) are water. *Chōng* (充) means full. *Guō* (郭) refers to the skin. Yin is retained within, and water-*qi* swells and fills, attacking the lungs from above. The lung-*qi* is isolated and perilous; the *pò* (魄) is the spirit of the lungs. The kidney is the root of water, yet the child cannot save the mother—that is why it is said that the *pò* dwells alone.

When the yin essence is internally diminished and the yang-*qi* is externally depleted, the Three *Jiāo* (焦) cannot disperse, and the waterways are blocked. Water fills the skin, and the body becomes bloated and swollen—that is why it is said that the body cannot be preserved as one’s own.

All such cases are marked by the Four Extremities’ pulses being severely urgent and an internal cough. When the *qi* resists within and the body swells outward, how can one exhaustively investigate root and branch? The Four Extremities refer to the four limbs.

The *Zuǒ Zhūan* (左传) states: "Wind is a disorder of the extremities." The *Líng Shū Jīng* (灵枢经) states: "The yang receives *qi* from the four extremities."

*(New annotation:)* Upon careful examination, "形施於外" (*xíng shī yú wài*) likely contains an error in the character "施" (*shī*).

Qibo replied: One must balance treatment with *quánhéng* (权衡) and remove the *wǎn* (宛) and *chén* (陈).

*(New annotation:)* According to the *Tài Sù* (太素), "□" is likely a miscopy for "茎" (*jīng*).

Thus, when the Four Extremities show subtle movement, the garments feel warm, and a misplaced needle is applied to a certain location to restore its form.

Open the Ghost Gate, purify the Palaces, and ingest the *essence* (*jīng*) at the proper times. When the Five Yangs are fully dispersed, the Five *Zàng* Organs are cleansed, hence the *essence* will naturally generate, and the form will flourish. The flesh and bones will then preserve one another, and the Great *Qi* will finally settle.

To balance treatment with *quánhéng* (weighing and measuring), one must discern whether the pulse is superficial or deep. A superficial pulse indicates the disorder lies on the surface, while a deep pulse signifies it is within the interior. For those with disorders in the interior, one must drain them; for those on the surface, one must induce sweating. Therefore, the following passage speaks of opening the Ghost Gate and purifying the Palaces. To remove the *wǎn* and *chén* (accumulated stagnant water), one must eliminate the lingering substances akin to the stems of grass#3 that cannot be retained within the body. The complete text yesterday reads: "草茎" (*cǎo jīng*).

Subtle movement of the Four Extremities means gently mobilizing the Four Limbs to allow the Yang *Qi* to gradually circulate, hence the phrase "温衣" (*wēn yī*, warming the garments).

When the *jīng* (Essence) pulse is full, the *luò* (Collateral) vessels overflow, and the Collaterals overflow, one must apply the misplaced needle to regulate them, ensuring the complexion returns to its original state without swelling, hence the phrase "谬刺某处以复其形" (apply the misplaced needle to a certain location to restore its form).

To open the Ghost Gate is to awaken the *Xuànfú* (Mysterious Palace) and expel the *Qi*. The Five Yangs refer to the Yang *Qi* of the Five *Zàng* Organs. To purify the Palaces means to expel the *Shènxiāng* (Bladder) water. When the pulse is harmonious, the Five *Jīng* (Essences) of the *Zàng* Organs will, in due course, be offered to the Kidneys as *Bīn* (Guest) and *Fù* (Host).

Yet, the Five *Zàng* Organs’ Yang *Qi* gradually disperses, and the impurities outside the Five *Zàng* Organs are also eliminated. Thus, the *essence* and marrow naturally generate, and the flesh flourishes. When the *Zàng* Organs and Palaces unite, the *Qi* of the bones and flesh will mutually preserve and embrace one another, and the Great Vessels’ *Qi* will then settle and recover.

In the *Yùbǎn Lùnyào* (玉版论要) chapter, the Yellow Emperor asked: "I have heard that *Guīdù* (揆度) and *Qíhéng* (奇恒) differ; how should they be applied?"

Qibo replied: "*Guīdù* is for measuring the depth of disease. *Qíhéng* is for discerning the *Dao* of the Five Colors and Five *Zàng* Organs.

Now speak of the *Dao*’s utmost subtlety: the Five Colors and Five *Zàng* Organs’ variations align with the singular principle. This singular principle refers to the correspondence between the Five Colors and the Five *Zàng* Organs. Thus, one can measure and discern the strange and constant.

Know the correspondence of the Five Colors and Five *Zàng* Organs (○*New annotation*: full text reads: "知色脉之应" (*zhī sè mài zhī yìng*)).

The *shén* (spirit) rotates without returning, and if it returns, it does not rotate—this is the loss of its mechanism. Blood and *Qi* are the *shén* (spirit) *Qi*. The *Bāzhèng Shénmíng* (八正神明) states: "Blood and *Qi* are the spirit of man; they must not be neglected in cultivation."

Indeed, Blood and *Qi* must follow the Four Seasons, alternating in their dominance like the *Zàng* Organs and *Fǔ* Palaces, and circulating through the Five *Qi* Elements without disrupting their natural order—this is the rotation without return. Return means reversal of flow.

Yet, Blood and *Qi* follow the dominant *Zàng* Organ (*Fùwáng*), and if they do not align with its natural course, they will reverse, leading to abnormality. Abnormality means the *Qi* returns but does not rotate. When the *Qi* returns but does not rotate, it loses the mechanism of life-giving *Qi*.

How can this be understood? When Wood declines, Fire dominates; when Fire declines, Earth dominates; when Earth declines, Metal dominates; when Metal declines, Water dominates; when Water declines, Wood dominates—this is the rotation without return. If Wood declines and Water dominates; Water declines and Metal dominates; Metal declines and Earth dominates; Earth declines and Fire dominates; Fire declines and Wood dominates—this is the return without rotation.

Yet, such reversal contradicts the Heavenly Order and Path#5; how can life persist?

The essence of the utmost subtlety is pressing close to the *Dao* with refined observation. The Five Colors and Five *Zàng* Organs’ transformations are essential principles that align with Heavenly Order yet remain subtle and profound. When inscribed on the *Yùbǎn* (玉版), they are named *Héyùjī* (合玉机).

The *Yùjī* (玉机) is the title of the chapter. It states that these principles of rotation and return are inscribed on the *Yùbǎn* (玉版), consistent with the text of the *Yùjī Shénmíng* (玉机神明) chapter. (○*New annotation*: full text reads: "道之至数至此" (*dào zhī zhì shù zhì cǐ*)).

The complexion appears in the upper, lower, left, and right regions, each with its own critical points. The complexion refers to external *Qi* manifestations. For instance, within the Liver (Wood) department, one may observe red, yellow, white, and black hues—all considered external *Qi*. The other *Zàng* Organs follow this pattern similarly. These observations are made on the *Míngtáng* (明堂) above, below, left, and right, hence the phrase "各在其要" (each in its critical points).

The method of observing colors is detailed in the *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* (甲乙经). If the color appears superficially, decoctions and soups are the primary treatment, and the illness will be resolved in ten days. A superficial color indicates a mild illness, hence ten days suffice.

If the color appears deeply, one must employ *zhǐ* (齐) therapy, and the illness will resolve in twenty-one days. A deep color signifies a severe illness, hence the treatment must conclude with *zhǐ* (齐) therapy.

If the color appears very deeply, *niàngjiǔ* (酝酒) treatment is applied, and the illness will resolve in a hundred days. The deeper and more severe the illness, the more days required. If the color is prematurely fading and the facial flesh is withering, it is untreatable. If the color appears very deeply but the facial flesh does not wither, treatment for a hundred days will resolve it. (○*New annotation*: though premature fading and flesh withering are untreatable, the critical period is still a hundred days).

A short pulse with *Qi* exhaustion leads to death. If the pulse is short and already depleted, and the true *Qi* gradually fails, it leads to death. When illness is mild but the *Qi* is severely depleted, the warm *Qi* consumes the *essence* and blood, leading to death.

The complexion appears in the upper, lower, left, and right regions, each with its own critical points. Upper indicates逆 (*nì*, contrary), and lower indicates従 (*cóng*, compliant). If the color appears in the lower region, it is a sign of life-giving *Qi*; hence, it is compliant. If the color appears in the upper region, it is an omen of injury to the spirit; hence, it is contrary.

For women, the right side indicates逆 (*nì*, contrary), and the left side indicates従 (*cóng*, compliant); for men, the left side indicates逆 (*nì*, contrary), and the right side indicates従 (*cóng*, compliant). The left side is Yang, so for men, the right side is compliant and the left side is contrary; the right side is Yin, so for women, the right side is contrary and the left side is compliant.

*Yì* (易) refers to the principle that excessive Yang or excessive Yin leads to death.

When a woman’s color appears on the left or a man’s on the right, this is a sign of *yì* (transformation).

If a man’s color appears on the left, it is called *chóngyáng* (excessive Yang), and if a woman’s color appears on the right, it is called *chóngyìn* (excessive Yin). When *qi* reaches its extreme, it reverses—thus, both lead to death.

When Yin and Yang are reversed,
*The Rectified Edition* notes: According to *The Great Treatise on the Correspondence of Yin and Yang*, it states: "Yin and Yang reversed."

Treatment lies in *quánhèng xiāngduó* (balancing through counteraction), a matter of *Qídàn* (strange and constant) and *Kuìdù* (measuring and regulating). *Quánhèng xiāngduó* means that the two *qi* of Yin and Yang cannot conform to their proper high and low states—this is a matter of strange deviation from the norm. One must then *kuìdù* (measure and regulate) the *qi*, treating accordingly.

*Túnjī* (pulse beating) and *bì* (spasm) with *bì* (rigidity):
When the *tún* (pulse) strikes the hand and causes pain, spasm, or rigidity, these are all due to the intermingling of cold and heat *qi*, not arising from the presence or absence of pathogenic *qi* or deficiency/excess.

A solitary pulse is called *xiāoqì* (dissipated *qi*), and a weak, draining pulse is called *duéb xuè* (blood depletion).

When the *tún* has surface without enclosure, or enclosure without surface, these are all called *gūwáng* (orphaned *qi*). If there is both surface and enclosure but insufficient *qi*, these are called *xūshuài* (deficient and decayed *qi*).

*Solitary* is *nì* (contrary), *deficient* is *cóng* (compliant). Solitary has no support, hence it is contrary. Deficient and decayed may recover, hence it is compliant.

To practice the *Qíhéng* method, begin with *Tàiyīn* (Greater Yin).
To measure and regulate strange deviations, first establish the *qìkǒu* (breathing orifice) *Tàiyīn* chant, determining the proper *qi* of the four seasons, then measure the strange deviations of *qi*.

To act against what is *not* victorious is *nì* (contrary)—contrary leads to death.
Wood encountering Metal pulse, Metal encountering Fire pulse, Fire encountering Water pulse, Water encountering Earth pulse, Earth encountering Wood pulse—all these are acting against what is not victorious, hence they are contrary. If the aggressor does not cease, contrary leads to death.

To act according to what is victorious is *cóng* (compliant)—compliant leads to life.
Wood encountering Water or Fire or Earth pulse, Fire encountering Metal, Wood, or Earth pulse, Earth encountering Metal, Water, or Fire pulse, Metal encountering Earth, Wood, or Water pulse, Water encountering Metal, Fire, or Wood pulse—all these are pulses that can be overcome, hence they are compliant. Compliant means nothing can harm, defeat, or kill, hence compliant leads to life.

The eight winds and four seasons’ victories cycle endlessly, returning to their beginning without exceeding the Five Phases, hence though they overcome one another, they still follow the circular principle of returning to their start.

One instance of contrary movement, once passed, cannot be recounted—thus the *Essentials of Diagnosis* concludes.

*Guò* means "throughout." When contrary movement passes throughout the five *qi*, it can no longer be counted as balanced.

**Diagnostic Essentials (Section on Seasonal Patterns)**

The Yellow Emperor asked: "What are the diagnostic essentials?"

Qībó replied: "In the first and second months, Heaven’s *qi* begins to be upright, Earth’s *qi* begins to emerge, and human *qi* resides in the Liver.
*Fāng* means upright—Heaven and Earth’s *qi* are upright, giving rise to all things. Wood governs the upright, ruling for seventy-two days, corresponding to the twelve days after the Spring Equinox—this is when Wood’s influence is active. Taking by months, the first and second months, human *qi* resides in the Liver.

In the third and fourth months, Heaven’s *qi* is upright and established, Earth’s *qi* is firmly emerging, and human *qi* resides in the Spleen.
Heaven’s *qi* is upright and established, with Yang *qi* flourishing brightly; Earth’s *qi* is firmly emerging, marking the time when all things bloom and desire fruition. Yet at the season’s end, Earth hosts and rules, and Earth is generated by *bǐng* (the third heavenly stem), hence human *qi* resides in the Spleen.

In the fifth and sixth months, Heaven’s *qi* is盛 (*shèng*, flourishing), Earth’s *qi* is high, and human *qi* resides in the head.
Heaven’s Yang is blazing, Earth’s flame ascends—hence it is said Heaven’s *qi* is flourishing, Earth’s *qi* is high. Fire’s nature is to flare upward, hence human *qi* resides in the head.

In the seventh and eighth months, Yin *qi* begins to kill, and human *qi* resides in the Lung.
In the seventh month, the third Yin line is generated; in the eighth month, Yin begins its solemn killing—hence it is said Yin *qi* begins to kill. Yet Yin’s solemn killing aligns with Metal, and Lung *qi* mirrors Metal, hence human *qi* resides in the Lung.

In the ninth and tenth months, Yin *qi* begins to freeze, Earth’s *qi* begins to close, and human *qi* resides in the Heart.
Yin *qi* begins to congeal, Earth’s *qi* begins to close, following Yang inward—hence human *qi* resides in the Heart.

In the eleventh and twelfth months, ice returns, Earth’s *qi* converges, and human *qi* resides in the Kidney.
Yang *qi* lies deep in retreat, hence *qi* resides in the Kidney.

The transformations of *qi* thus give rise in Wood, flourish in Earth, rise high and peak, are solemnly killed by Metal, avoid cold in Fire, and are stored in Water—all following the natural ascent and descent of Yin and Yang *qi*.

*The Chapter on the Generation of the Five Viscera* states: The symbols of the Five Viscera can be analogized. This is called *qìlèi* (classification by *qi*).

Hence in spring, one pricks *sǎnshù* (scattering the *shù* points) and *fēnlǐ* (separating the flesh), letting blood flow and stop.
*Sǎnshù* refers to *wènxué* (interrogating the orifices). *Fēnlǐ* refers to the separation of muscle and flesh.
*The Rectified Edition* notes: According to *The Treatise on the Four Seasons’ Pricking of Contrary and Compliant*, spring *qi* is in the channels. This scattering of *shù* points is the *shù* points of the channels. Again, *The Treatise on Water-Heat Orifices* states: In spring, take the *luò* (collateral) pulses at the flesh’s divisions. If severe, transmit *qi*; if mild, circulate it.
*Chuán* means "transmit"—transmitting what is not victorious. *Huán* means "circulate"—circulating through the five *qi* in cycles.
*The Rectified Edition* notes: In *Tàisū*, *huán* is written as *huányǐ*.

In summer, one pricks *luòshù* (collateral orifices), letting blood flow and stop, exhausting *qi* to close the cycle, ensuring pain and disease descend.
*Jìnqì* means draining *qi*—withdrawing the needle to exhaust the pathogenic *qi* in the collateral pulses beneath. Once the pathogenic *qi* is exhausted, the orifices close tightly, and the channels circulate, sending the pain and disease *qi* downward. This is done because Yang *qi* is at its peak.
*The Rectified Edition* notes: According to *The Treatise on the Four Seasons’ Pricking of Contrary and Compliant*, summer *qi* is in the *sūnluò* (grand collaterals). This *luòshù* refers to the orifices of the *sūnluò*.

「Moreover, *The Treatise on Water-Heat Acupoints* states: In summer, one pricks the **dividing points** of the **primary channels** at their peak.

In autumn, one pricks the **skin and flesh**, following the **interstitial pathways**, above and below using the same method, and stops when the **spirit** shifts. Following the **interstitial pathways** means tracing the **separations and divisions** of muscle and flesh. Above refers to *shǒutóng* (hand *tóng*). Below refers to *zútóng* (foot *tóng*). The **spirit** shifts means the **pulse-qi** alters, differing from before the pricking. Since the **pulse** is the function of the **spirit**, this is how it is described.
*The Rectified Edition* notes: According to *The Treatise on the Four Seasons’ Pricking of Contrary and Compliant*, autumn *qi* resides in the **skin**. This aligns with the meaning above. Moreover, *The Treatise on Water-Heat Acupoints* states: One pricks the **acupoints** to dispel **Yin evil**, and one pricks the **convergent points** to weaken **Yang evil**. Huangfu Shian notes: This marks the **initial changes** of autumn’s onset.
In winter, one pricks **acupoints and orifices** along the **interstitial pathways**, deeply for severe cases, or dispersedly for milder ones. Deeply means one pricks directly downward. Dispersedly means one pricks to spread downward.
*The Rectified Edition* notes: According to *The Treatise on the Four Seasons’ Pricking of Contrary and Compliant*, winter *qi* resides in the **bone marrow**. These **acupoints and orifices** are those of the bone marrow.
Moreover, *The Treatise on Water-Heat Acupoints* states: In winter, one pricks the **wells and springs**. Huangfu Shian notes: This marks the **late winter** treatment of changes.
In spring, summer, autumn, and winter, each season has its designated pricking points, following the *qi*’s location.

If one pricks in **spring** but targets **summer divisions**, the **pulse** becomes erratic and *qi* weak, leading to **excessive penetration into bone marrow**, so the disease cannot be cured, causing the patient to lose appetite and suffer from **shortness of breath**. The **heart** governs the **pulse**, hence the erratic pulse and weak *qi*. Since **water** receives *qi* from **summer**, and the **kidneys** govern **bone**, the evil *qi* invades the **bone marrow**. If **heart-fire** is diminished, **stomach-earth** becomes deficient, hence the loss of appetite and shortness of breath.
*The Rectified Edition* notes: According to *The Treatise on the Four Seasons’ Pricking of Contrary and Compliant*, pricking in spring on **autumn divisions** causes **tendons to contract**, with **rebellious *qi* circulating** into **coughing**; the disease does not resolve, causing the patient to **frequently startle** and **cry**. **Wood** receives *qi* from **autumn**, and the **liver** governs **tendons**, so pricking autumn divisions causes **tendon contraction**. If the *qi* rebels and circulates, it results in coughing. The liver governs startling, hence frequent startling. The **lungs** govern *qi*, so rebellious *qi* also causes **crying**.
*The Rectified Edition* notes: According to *The Treatise on the Four Seasons’ Pricking of Contrary and Compliant*, pricking in spring on **skin and flesh** causes **blood and *qi* to circulate rebelliously**, leading to **upper *qi* rebellion**.
If one pricks in **spring** but targets **winter divisions**, the **evil *qi* lodges in the viscera**, causing **distension**; the disease does not resolve, and the patient **desires to speak**. Since **winter** governs **hidden Yang *qi* in storage**, evil *qi* lodges in the viscera. If the **kidneys** are replete, it causes distension, hence pricking winter divisions leads to distension. **Fire** receives *qi* from **winter**, and the **heart** governs speech, so the patient desires to speak.
*The Rectified Edition* notes: According to *The Treatise on the Four Seasons’ Pricking of Contrary and Compliant*, pricking in spring on **tendons and bones** causes **blood and *qi* to lodge internally**, leading to **abdominal pain**.

If one pricks in **summer** but targets **spring divisions**, the disease does not resolve, causing **relaxed tendons**. Since the **liver** nourishes **tendons**, and **liver-qi** is deficient, the **tendon strength becomes relaxed**.
*The Rectified Edition* notes: According to *The Treatise on the Four Seasons’ Pricking of Contrary and Compliant*, pricking in summer on **primary channels** causes **blood and *qi* to be exhausted**, leading to **relaxed muscles**.
If one pricks in **summer** but targets **autumn divisions**, the disease does not resolve, causing the patient to **desire silence** in the heart, **fearful as if about to be seized**. Since **liver-wood** governs speech, injury to autumn divisions causes **liver-wood deficiency**, hence the fear as if about to be seized. If the liver is deficient, the patient desires silence but remains fearful.
*The Rectified Edition* notes: According to *The Treatise on the Four Seasons’ Pricking of Contrary and Compliant*, pricking in summer on **skin and flesh** causes **blood and *qi* to retreat internally**, leading to **frequent fear**. *The Jia-Yi Classic* writes *mèn* (oppressed).
If one pricks in **summer** but targets **winter divisions**, the disease does not resolve, causing **shortness of breath** and **frequent anger**. Since **summer** injures the **kidneys**, the **liver** and **lungs** become **stimulated**, leading to **internal deficiency of intent**, hence the shortness of breath and frequent anger.
*The Rectified Edition* notes: According to *The Treatise on the Four Seasons’ Pricking of Contrary and Compliant*, pricking in summer on **tendons and bones** causes **blood and *qi* to rebel upward**, leading to **frequent anger**.

If one pricks in **autumn** but targets **spring divisions**, the disease does not cease, causing the patient to **feel unrestrained and inclined to act**, yet **forgets upon arising**. This is due to **liver deficiency**. The pricking was not appropriate.
*The Rectified Edition* notes: According to *The Treatise on the Four Seasons’ Pricking of Contrary and Compliant*, pricking in autumn on **primary channels** causes **blood and *qi* to rebel upward**, leading to **frequent forgetfulness**.
If one pricks in **autumn** but targets **summer divisions**, the disease does not cease, causing the patient to **increase cravings for external things** and **frequent vivid dreams**. If **heart-qi** is diminished, **spleen-qi** becomes **isolated**, hence the cravings for external things. The **heart** governs dreams, and the **spirit** is responsible for them, hence the frequent vivid dreams.
*The Rectified Edition* notes: According to *The Treatise on the Four Seasons’ Pricking of Contrary and Compliant*, pricking in autumn on **collateral channels** causes **unable to circulate *qi* externally**, leading to **torpor** and **disinclination to move**. If one pricks in **autumn** but targets **winter divisions**, the disease does not cease, causing the patient to **feel cold when drinking wine**. Since **Yin *qi*** rebels upward, the patient feels cold. Wine refers to **alcohol**, and cold describes **chilliness**.
*The Rectified Edition* notes: According to *The Treatise on the Four Seasons’ Pricking of Contrary and Compliant*, pricking in autumn on **tendons and bones** causes **blood and *qi* to scatter internally**, leading to **chills and shivering**.

If one pricks in **winter** but targets **spring divisions**, the disease does not cease, causing the patient to **desire to sleep outdoors but cannot**, and **sees things while asleep**. Since **liver-qi** is diminished, the patient desires to sleep outdoors but cannot. The **liver** governs the eyes, hence the patient sees apparitions while asleep.
*The Rectified Edition* notes: According to *The Treatise on the Four Seasons’ Pricking of Contrary and Compliant*, pricking in winter on **primary channels** causes **blood and *qi* to all drain away**, leading to **blurred vision**.
If one pricks in **winter** but targets **summer divisions**, the disease does not resolve, causing **evil *qi* to rise**, manifesting as **various forms of numbness**. This is due to **draining pulse-qi**.
*The Rectified Edition* notes: According to *The Treatise on the Four Seasons’ Pricking of Contrary and Compliant*, pricking in winter on **collateral channels** causes **blood and *qi* to drain externally**, leaving behind **severe numbness**.
If one pricks in **winter** but targets **autumn divisions**, the disease does not cease, causing the patient to **frequently feel thirsty**. This is due to **deficient lung-qi**.」

The Rectified Edition states: According to *The Treatise on the Four Seasons’ Pricking of Contrary and Compliant*, pricking in winter on **muscles and sinews**, the **yang-qi** is exhausted, causing the patient to **frequently forget**#12.

In general, when pricking the **chest and abdomen**, one must avoid the **Five Viscera**. The **heart and lungs** reside above the **epigastrium**, the **kidneys and liver** below it, while the **spleen**—corresponding to earth—dwells in the center. Hence, pricking the chest and abdomen must avoid these regions. The Five Viscera are the repositories of **spirit, soul, will, and vital essence**; harming them causes the **Five Spirits** to depart, and their departure leads to death. Thus, one must proceed with caution.

The **epigastrium** is a critical area—if **qi** flows in a complete circuit around it, death ensues. This refers to the **twelve celestial stems** of the annual cycle.

The Rectified Edition states: According to *The Treatise on the Prohibitions of Pricking*, if one strikes the **central channel (Ren Mai)**, death occurs within **one day**, and the patient’s movements are marked by **sighing**. *The Treatise on the Four Seasons’ Pricking of Contrary and Compliant* agrees.

This **primary channel (Jing Mai)** is missing in the description of the **liver’s central channel (Ren Mai)**—*The Treatise on the Prohibitions of Pricking* states: If one strikes the **liver’s central channel (Ren Mai)**, death occurs within **five days**, and the patient’s movements are marked by **speech**. *The Treatise on the Four Seasons’ Pricking of Contrary and Compliant* agrees.

If one strikes the **spleen’s central channel (Ren Mai)**, death occurs within **five days**—earth’s numerical correspondence is five. The Rectified Edition states: According to *The Treatise on the Prohibitions of Pricking*, if one strikes the **spleen’s central channel (Ren Mai)**, death occurs within **ten days**, and the patient’s movements are marked by **swallowing**. *The Treatise on the Four Seasons’ Pricking of Contrary and Compliant* agrees.

If one strikes the **kidney’s central channel (Ren Mai)**, death occurs within **seven days**—water’s numerical completion reaches seven. One text states **ten days**, but this is a typographical error. The Rectified Edition states: According to *The Treatise on the Prohibitions of Pricking*, if one strikes the **kidney’s central channel (Ren Mai)**, death occurs within **six days**, and the patient’s movements are marked by **sneezing**. *The Treatise on the Four Seasons’ Pricking of Contrary and Compliant* states: If one strikes the **kidney’s central channel (Ren Mai)**, death occurs within **six days**, and the patient’s movements are marked by **sneezing and yawning**.

If one strikes the **lung’s central channel (Ren Mai)**, death occurs within **five days**—metal’s numerical correspondence is four, but its completion reaches five. One text states **three days**, but this is also a typographical error. The Rectified Edition states: According to *The Treatise on the Prohibitions of Pricking*, if one strikes the **lung’s central channel (Ren Mai)**, death occurs within **three days**, and the patient’s movements are marked by **coughing**. *The Treatise on the Four Seasons’ Pricking of Contrary and Compliant* agrees.

King’s annotation on *The Treatise on the Four Seasons’ Pricking of Contrary and Compliant* states: These three treatises all originate from **Qi Bo’s** teachings, but their discrepancies arise from transmission errors. If one strikes the **epigastrium’s central channel (Ren Mai)**, the injury is severe—though the disease may resolve, death will occur within **one year**. The Five Viscera’s **qi** collectively governs the year; if the epigastrium is harmed, the Five Viscera’s **qi** will mutually **subdue and attack** one another, hence death within **one year**.

To avoid striking the Five Viscera is to understand **contrary and compliant** principles. The so-called **compliant** refers to the epigastrium aligning with the **spleen and kidneys**; those who do not know this may strike in reverse. The **kidneys** adhere to the **spine**, the **spleen** resides centrally, and the **epigastrium** connects to the **ribcage**—those who know this proceed correctly, while the ignorant harm the viscera.

When pricking the chest and abdomen, one must first **apply a cloth** to the area, then prick from the **single-cloth layer** above. Once the **form** is fixed, there will be no mistake in striking the Five Viscera.

The Rectified Edition states: According to another edition, **傲** (yào) is written as **檄** (xí) or **檄** (zhì). **傲** is pronounced as *Gu Qiang* (古羌切), **着** as *Zhi Lue* (直略切). If the pricking does not resolve, one should not prick again—**qi** must reach its intended destination. *The Classic of Acupuncture* states: If **qi** does not reach its destination upon pricking, no matter how many times one tries; if **qi** reaches its destination upon pricking, withdraw the needle and do not prick again. This is what is meant.

Pricking must be **solemn**—solemn refers to **calm and reverent**, the means to observe the **survival or departure of *qi***. Needles should be **shaken** when treating **swellings** to expel **abundant pus and blood**. However, for **primary channels (Jing Mai)**, needles should not be shaken—this is because **primary channel-qi** does not wish to disperse. This is the **Dao of pricking**.

The Emperor said: I wish to hear the **terminations** of the **twelve primary channels (Jing Mai)**—what are they?

**Termination** means **exhaustion**. **Qi Bo** replied:

The **primary channel of Tai Yang (太阳)**—when exhausted—**causes the eyes to fix upward and become paralyzed**, with a **white complexion**. **Sudden cessation of sweat** occurs, and when it does, death follows. **Fixing upward** means the **eyeballs do not turn**, and the patient **gazes upward**. However, the **primary channel of Tai Yang (足太阳)** begins at the **inner canthus**, ascends to the **forehead**, and meets at the **vertex**. It enters the **brain’s collateral network**, descends to the **nape**, and then emerges to **loop below the occipital bone**, running along the **inner side of the shoulder**, descending to the **inner side of the spine**, and reaching the **waist**. Its **branch** descends along the **foot to the outer side of the little toe**.

The **primary channel of Tai Yang (手太阳)** begins at the **tip of the little finger**, ascends the **arm to the shoulder**, and enters the **suprascapular fossa**. Its **branch** ascends to the **cheek** and reaches the **inner canthus**, meeting the **primary channel of Tai Yang (足太阳)**. The Rectified Edition states: According to *The Treatise of Jia Yi (甲乙经)*, it **crosses the vertex obliquely**. Its **branch** further ascends from the **suprascapular fossa**, follows the **neck to the cheek**, and reaches the **outer canthus**. The Rectified Edition states: According to *The Treatise of Jia Yi (甲乙经)*, **outer** is written as **兑** (duì).

Hence, when exhausted, the **eyes fix upward and become paralyzed**, with a **white complexion**, and **sudden cessation of sweat** occurs. **Sudden cessation of sweat** means **sweat erupts violently like beads** but does not flow, then **dries up abruptly**. When Tai Yang is **extreme**, sweat emerges—thus, its emergence means death.

The **primary channel of Shao Yang (少阳)**—when exhausted—**causes deafness**, **all joints to loosen**, and **the eyes to stare straight ahead as if in shock**. If the **eyeballs’ tendons are severed**, death occurs within **one and a half days**, and the patient’s **complexion turns greenish-white before death**. The **primary channel of Shao Yang (足少阳)** begins at the **outer canthus**, ascends to the **corner of the head**, and descends behind the **ear**. Its **branch** enters the **ear from behind**, emerging to **run forward**. The **primary channel of Shao Yang (手少阳)**—its **branch**—also enters the **ear from behind**, emerging to **run forward**.

Hence, when exhausted, **deafness and staring eyes occur**. Shao Yang governs **bones**, so when its **qi** is exhausted, **all joints loosen**. The **greenish-white complexion** arises from **metal and wood clashing**. Thus, death is imminent. **Staring** means **gazing straight ahead in a startled manner**. **Staring** is pronounced as *Qióng* (琼).

---

The **Shao Yang (少阳)** channel’s **branch** diverges: descending from *Da Ying* (大迎) forward into *Ren Ying* (人迎), it follows the throat and enters *Que Pen* (缺盆) below the *Li* (鬲), where the **Yang Ming (陽明)** channel of the **Hand**—the *Tun* (豚)—originates from the hand, ascending along the arm to the shoulder, and emerges above the *Zhu Gu* (柱骨) junction before descending into *Que Pen* and networked with the lungs.

Its other **branch** diverges: from *Que Pen* it ascends the neck, passes through the cheek, and descends into the teeth, then emerges beside the mouth. It intersects with *Ren Ying* (人迎), left to right on the right side, right to left on the left, ascending beside the nasal *Gui* (轨) to meet the **Yang Ming (足陽明)** channel of the **Foot**.
*Newly corrected text*: According to the *Jia Yi Jing* (甲乙經), *Gui* (轨) should be *Kong* (孔), omitting the phrase "to meet the **Yang Ming (足陽明)** channel of the **Foot**."

Thus, when its **qi** is exhausted, the eyes move uncontrollably. This is called **staring** (*Qióng* 琼), meaning the eyes bulge and the jaw quivers. When the **stomach** is diseased, the patient loathes others and fire; hearing wooden sounds causes sudden fright and alarm. They also curse *Jin* (晉), and though *Jin* (晉) is a surname, they do not distinguish between near and far, hence their tendency to sudden fright and irrational speech. **Yellow** is the color of **earth**. The "upper" refers to the **Hand Tun (手陽明豚)**, and the "lower" refers to the **Foot Tun (足陽明豚)**. When the **channels** are **overactive** (*sheng* 盛), meaning the facial, ocular, cervical, and mandibular **channels** of the **Foot** and **Hand** all become agitated and restless, and if **virtue** (*ren* 仁) is lost—meaning they cannot discern good and evil—such cases all signify the **qi**’s exhaustion, hence death is imminent. *Qióng* (啖) is pronounced as *shàn* (闪).

When the **Shao Yin (少陰)** channel is exhausted, the face turns black, the teeth grow long and foul, the abdomen swells and becomes constricted, and the upper and lower passages fail to connect before death. If the **Hand Shao Yin (手少陰)** channel’s **qi** is exhausted, **blood does not flow**; if the **Foot Shao Yin (足少陰)** channel’s **qi** is exhausted, the **bones do not moisten** (*bu yin* 不濡). When the **bones harden** (*gu yin* 骨硬), the **gums recede** (*gen shang xuan* 龈上宣), causing the teeth to elongate and accumulate filth. When **blood stagnates** (*xue huai* 血壞), the **skin’s color dies**, hence the face appears like lacquer and lacks liveliness. The **Foot Shao Yin (足少陰)** channel rises from the **kidney**, ascends through the **liver**, enters the *Li* (鬲), and descends into the **lungs**. The **Hand Shao Yin (手少陰)** channel originates from the **heart**, emerges to belong to the **heart system**, and descends into the *Li* (鬲) to network with the **lower abdomen**.

Thus, when its **qi** is exhausted, the abdomen swells and becomes constricted, with upper and lower passages failing to connect. *Newly corrected text*: As per Wang’s annotation, "bones do not moisten" (*gu bu yin* 骨不濡) should be "bones do not adhere" (*gu bu yin* 骨不濡, 肉弗能着), following the *Nan Jing* (難經) and *Jia Yi Jing* (甲乙經). The **Hand Shao Yin (手少陰)** channel’s **branch** networks with the **small intestine** (*Jia Yi Jing* 甲乙經).

When the **Tai Yin (太陰)** channel is exhausted, the abdomen swells and becomes constricted, preventing breathing; the patient frequently sighs and vomits. The **Foot Tai Yin (足太陰)** channel travels from the inner thigh, descending along the *Hou* (後) to enter the abdomen, belonging to the **spleen** and networking with the **stomach**, then ascending into the *Li* (鬲). The **Hand Tai Yin (手太陰)** channel originates from the **middle burner**, descends to network with the **large intestine**, and ascends along the **stomach** into the *Li* (鬲), belonging to the **lungs**. Thus, when its **qi** is exhausted, the symptoms are as described. The *Ling Shu Jing* (靈樞經) states: "If the **Foot Tai Yin (足太陰)** channel’s **branch** is **overactive**, the patient vomits upon eating, and the abdomen swells with frequent sighing. Vomiting leads to **reversed flow** (*ni* 逆), and **reversed flow** leads to flushed complexion. If there is no **reversed flow**, then the upper and lower passages fail to connect, and the face turns black with **skin and hair scorched** before death. If there is **reversed flow**, the upper passage is open, hence only a flushed complexion. If there is no vomiting, the lower passage is already constricted, and the upper passage fails to connect, causing **heart qi to overturn outward** (*xin qi wai fan* 心氣外翻), hence the **skin and hair scorch** and death is imminent. Why? Because the **Foot Tai Yin (足太陰)** channel’s **branch** diverges again from the **stomach**, ascending into the *Li* (鬲) and pouring into the **heart**. Thus, the **skin and hair scorch** due to the **heart qi overturning outward**.

When the **Jue Yin (厥陰)** channel is exhausted, there is **internal heat**, hoarseness, and dryness; the patient frequently urinates with a troubled **mind**. In severe cases, the **tongue curls up** (*she juan* 舌卷) like a **tortoise’s head** (*xuan shang* 卵上), retracting before death. The **Foot Jue Yin (足厥陰)** channel’s **branch** follows the **channel**, ascending to the *Gao* (皋) and connecting at the **root of the penis** (*jing* 茎). Its **primary channel** enters the **hairline**, descends past the **external genitalia**, ascends to the **lower abdomen**, beside the **stomach**, and follows the throat before entering the **occipital bone** (*wan ke* 頑顱). The **Hand Jue Yin (手厥陰)** channel originates from the **chest**, emerging to belong to the **heart’s protective system** (*xin bao* 心包). Thus, when its **qi** is exhausted, **internal heat**, hoarseness, and dryness occur, with frequent urination and a troubled **mind**. The *Ling Shu Jing* (靈樞經) states: "The **liver** is the **tendons’ convergence**; **tendons** gather at the **external genitalia**, and their **branches** network at the **root of the tongue**. Hence, in severe cases, the **tongue curls up** like a **tortoise’s head** and retracts. This is also because the **Jue Yin (厥陰)** channel passes through the **external genitalia**."

*Newly corrected text*: According to the *Jia Yi Jing* (甲乙經), *Gao* (皋) should be *Gou* (睪), and *Guo* (過) should be *Huan* (環).

These are the **failures** of the **Twelve Channels** (十二經). The **Hand Three Yin and Three Yang (手三陰三陽)** and the **Foot Three Yin and Three Yang (足三陰三陽)** constitute the **Twelve Channels**. **Failure** means the **qi** is exhausted and the **channels** are corrupted.

*Newly corrected text*: The **exhaustion** of the **Twelve Channels** is also detailed in the *Ling Shu Jing* (靈樞經), overlapping with the *Su Wen* (素問) annotations. *Huang Di Nei Jing Su Wen Bu Zhu Jiao* (黃帝內經素問補注校文卷之十二).

**Pulse Essentials Discourse**
The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How should one examine the pulses?"*
Qi Bo replied: *"The method of pulse examination is best performed at dawn, when the **yin qi** has not yet stirred, the **yang qi** has not yet dispersed, food and drink have not been consumed, the **channels** are not yet full, the **collaterals** are evenly harmonized, and the circulation of **qi** and blood remains unperturbed. Thus, one may then diagnose the **aberrant pulses**."*

Stirred: *"Stirred and descending in weakness."*
Dispersed: *"Dispersed and spreading outward."*
Aberrant: *"Pulses that differ from the usual patterns."*

○Newly corrected text states: *"According to *The Classic of Pulses* and *The Thousand-Gold Prescriptions*, the term 'aberrant pulses' should be **‘aberrant (this is incorrect)’**, not **‘over (this is incorrect)’**."*

Wang’s annotation: *"Yin qi has not yet stirred"* refers to its descending in weakness.
According to *The Golden Chamber’s True Utterances*: *"From dawn until noon, the **yang** of Heaven, the **yang** within **yang**, is the purest **yang** of the day. Thus, dawn is the time when **yin qi** has not yet stirred—how could there be a meaning of descending in weakness?"*
Examining the pulse’s movement and stillness to observe **clarity and brightness**, inspecting the five colors, and discerning the **dharma** of the five **zàng organs**—whether they are in excess or deficiency—the **fù organs**’s strength or weakness, and the **form’s** waxing or waning, one may thereby correlate and determine the division between life and death.

Examining: *"Using the fingers to press close to the **precise brightness** (穴)."*
**Precise brightness** (精明): A **point**’s name.
Located in the **Bright Hall** (明堂) beside the two eyes’ inner corners, the **Blue#1** point, so called because it is near the eyes.
*"The pulse’s rise and fall, its abundance or scarcity, are observed through the **precise brightness**’s **qi** and color, while examining the **zàng** and **fù** organs for excess or deficiency, correlating their patterns to determine the division between life and death."*

*"The pulse is the repository of blood—*
**Repository** (府): *to gather*.
*"All variations in blood’s abundance or scarcity are manifest within the **channels**."*

Thus, *The Discourse on Needle Techniques* states: *"When the pulse is full, the blood is full; when the pulse is empty, the blood is empty—this is the norm. If it deviates from this, there is **disease**."*

Therefore, if the pulse is:
Long, then **qi** is harmonized and health prevails;
Short#3, then **qi** is deficient and **disease** arises;
Rapid, then there is **heat** and the mind is troubled;
Overfull, then **evil forces** are rampant and **disease** advances.

Long pulses come and go with length;
Short pulses come and go with brevity;
Rapid pulses come and go with urgency and speed;
Overfull pulses come and go with a broad, distended rhythm.

When the pulse is strong at the **upper** (inch) position, **qi** is high;
○Newly corrected text states: *"According to Quán Yuánqǐ’s version, ‘high’ (高) should be ‘**li**’ (鬲)."*
When the pulse is strong at the **lower** position, **qi** is bloated;
When the pulse is **intermittent**, **qi** is diminished;
When the pulse is **smooth**, **qi** is scarce;
○Newly corrected text states: *"According to *The Great Essentials*, ‘smooth’ (滑) should be ‘**fine**’ (细)."*
When the pulse is **rough**, there is **heart pain**.
**Upper** (上): Refers to the **inch** position.

The **lower** position refers to the **cubit** region.
**Stenosis** refers to a pulse that is full and distended.
An **intermittent pulse** moves and then stops abruptly, unable to return on its own.
A **fine pulse** moves like a dandelion seed.
A **rough pulse** is stiff and unyielding in its coming and going.

A **turbulent pulse** arrives in surges like a gushing spring—when such a pulse appears, the disease advances and the complexion grows wan. A **fading pulse** departs gradually like a snapped string—this is a sign of death.
**Chaotic turbulence** refers to a pulse whose **qi** is in disarray alone.
**Sudden collapse** refers to a pulse that arrives taut and large, firm yet prolonged.
**Like a gushing spring** means the pulse flows ceaselessly, rising but never receding.
**Fading** means it lingers faintly, barely perceptible to the hand.
**Like a snapped string** means the pulse abruptly ceases, as though a string had been severed.

If the disease progresses daily and the complexion grows foul, such pulses are all **ominous signs of death**.
○Newly corrected text states: According to *The Canon of Medicine in Categories (Jia-Yi Jing)* and *The Pulse Classic (Mai Jing)*, it reads: *"When the pulse is **discordant and turbulent**, arriving like a gushing spring, the disease advances and becomes perilous; when it **wanes and drifts** like a snapped string, death follows."*

The **luster of the five colors** is the **qi’s** manifestation.
The refined essence of the five **qi** manifests above as the five colors, transforming within the luminous clarity.
*The Treatise on the Six Nodal Phases and the Symbolic Organs* states:
*"Heaven nourishes man with the five **qi**; the five **qi** enter through the nose and are stored in the heart and lungs, ascending to refine the five colors."*

Thus, one must discern the five colors with clarity.
**Red** should be like silk-wrapped cinnabar, not like ochre;
**White** should be like goose down, not like salt.
○Newly corrected text states: According to *The Canon of Medicine in Categories*, it reads: *"White should be like the luster of a white jade, not like the inner (unpolished) side."*
*The Great Essentials* presents this twice.
**Green** should be like the sheen of a dark jade, not like indigo;
**Yellow** should be like silk-wrapped realgar, not like yellow soil;
**Black** should be like deep lacquered color, not like ashen gray.
○Newly corrected text states: According to *The Canon of Medicine in Categories*, it reads: *"Like charcoal color."*

When these **debased hues**—ochre, salt-white, indigo, yellow soil, or ashen gray—appear, they are signs of **qi’s** decay, and thus life is short.

The **luminous clarity** is what allows one to perceive all things, distinguish white from black, and judge length from shortness. To invert long for short, white for black—this is the **virtue/power** of clarity failing. Beware of such errors.
Such confusion arises only when **luminous clarity** has waned.

The Five **Zàng** [1] are the guardians of the **center** [2]. Within the body’s form, the Five **Shén** [3] reside where these guardians hold their place. This is how one **clearly observes** the Five **Zàng** [1].
○Newly corrected text states: According to *The Canon of Medicine in Categories* (*Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng*) and *The Great Simplicity* (*Tài Sù*), **"guard"** is translated as **"Fǔ"** [4].

When the **center** is **replete** with **Zàng** [1], and **qi** [5] prevails over **injury/fear** [6], the voice sounds as if speaking from within a chamber—this is the **center**’s **dampness** [7].
The **center** refers to the abdomen. **Replete** means **qi** is abundant. **Zàng** refers to the **lungs** [8] storing **qi** [5]. **Qi** prevailing means it overcomes normal **breathing** [9], causing panting and irregular respiration. When abdominal **qi** is excessive, the **lungs**’s storage is full, **qi** overcomes breathing, and one is prone to **injury/fear** [6], the voice fails to emerge as if confined in a chamber—this is all due to **dampness** in the abdomen.

If speech is faint, and one must pause the whole day before resuming, this is **depletion of qi** [10].
If the voice is weak and thin, with speech halting and unable to continue, then severe **depletion of qi** [10] is evident.

When **clothing** is not properly **enveloped** [11], and **speech** oscillates between **good and evil** [12], without regard for **proximity or distance** [13], this is the **disorder of luminous clarity and spirit** [14].
When the **granaries** [15] are **not securely stored** [16], this is the **failure of the gates and doors** [17].
**Granaries** refers to the **spleen and stomach** [18]. **Gates and doors** refers to the **Pò Men** [19].
*The Secret Essentials of the Mysterious Pivot* (*Líng Lán Mì Diǎn Lùn*) states: The **spleen and stomach** are the officials of the **granaries**.
*The Treatise on the Separate Functions of the Five Zàng* (*Wǔ Zàng Bié Lùn*) states: The **Pò Men** also serves as a messenger for the Five **Zàng**, preventing water and grain from being stored for too long. The **Pò Men** is the **anus**.
**Wanting** refers to **restraint of urination**. If **water and grain** [20] do not cease, this is the **bladder’s failure to store**.
**Water and grain** refers to the **flow of the anterior yin** [21].

**Retaining the guardians** leads to life; **losing the guardians** leads to death.
When these **granaries** fail to store, **qi** prevails over **injury/fear** [6], **clothing** is not properly **enveloped**, and **water and grain** [20] do not cease, it is because **spirit and qi** retain their proper guardianship, leading to life, or lose it, leading to death.

How does one know when **spirit and qi** fail to **guard**?
If **clothing** is not properly **enveloped**, and **speech** oscillates between **good and evil** [12] without regard for **proximity or distance** [13], this is the **evidence of disorder**.
Severe **disorder** means **spirit and qi** no longer **guard** the **Zàng**.

The Five **Zàng** are the **body’s strength** [22].
When the **Zàng** are **settled**, the **spirit guards**; when the **spirit guards**, the **body is strong**—thus they are called the **body’s strength**.

The **head** is the **Fǔ** of **luminous clarity** [23]. If the head tilts and **vision deepens**, the **spirit is about to be depleted**.
The **back** is the **Fǔ** of the **chest** [24]. If the back **bends** and the shoulders **sag**, the **Fǔ** is about to **fail**.
The **waist** is the **Fǔ** of the **kidneys** [25]. If **turning and swaying** [26] are impossible, the **kidneys** are about to **wear out**.
The **knees** are the **Fǔ** of **sinews** [27]. If **flexion and extension** are impossible, and one **stumbles** while walking,
○Newly corrected text states: According to another version, **"stumbles"** is written as **"bows"**; *The Great Simplicity* (*Tài Sù*) uses **"stumbles"**.
the **sinews** are about to **wear out**.
The **bones** are the **Fǔ** of **bone marrow** [28]. If one cannot stand for long, and **walking causes trembling** [29], the **bones** are about to **wear out**.
All are called **Fǔ** because of where they **reside** and what they **govern**.
**Retaining strength** leads to life; **losing strength** leads to death.
**Strength** refers to **qi** in the **center** being **robust and firm** to **settle and guard**.

「The reversal of the four seasons—when there is excess, it becomes *jing* (essence); when deficient, it becomes *consumption* (xiao). When the body exceeds its proper state, deficiency becomes *jing*; when deficient, excess becomes *consumption*. When yin and yang fail to correspond, the disease is called *guan ge* (blockage).

The pulse reflects these excesses and deficiencies: all deficiencies deplete blood and *qi*; all excesses allow pathogenic *qi* to overwhelm *jing*. When yin and yang fail to harmonize, they cannot nourish each other, hence *guan ge*.

The Emperor asked:
*"How does the pulse move with the four seasons? How can one know the location of a disease? How can one know its transformations? How can one know when disease shifts from internal to external—or vice versa? May I inquire about these five matters?"*
*(He sought to understand the correspondence of the seasons and the harmony of yin and yang.)*

Gū Bó replied:
*"The pulse moves with the four seasons, revealing the disease’s location, its transformations—though the text’s structure here is somewhat disjointed. The later discussion of internal and external disease does not fully align. Let me explain how this aligns with the grand cycles of Heaven.*

Within the six directions—above, below, and the four cardinal points—the transformations of Heaven and Earth, the responses of yin and yang: the warmth of spring becomes the heat of summer; the urgency of autumn becomes the fury of winter. The four seasonal shifts move the pulse upward and downward.

Spring’s pulse is soft and weak, light and slippery—like the motion of a compass’s edge, balanced within and without, hence *‘spring corresponds to the compass.’*
Summer’s pulse is surging and great, slippery and rapid—like a carpenter’s square, upright and level, hence *‘summer corresponds to the square.’*
Autumn’s pulse is fine and sparse, light and rough—like a balance scale, evenly poised, hence *‘autumn corresponds to the balance.’*
Winter’s pulse is firm and solid, with a subtle slipperiness—like a weighing scale’s counterweight, descending beyond the balance, hence *‘winter corresponds to the counterweight.’*

Thus, from autumn’s balance to winter’s counterweight, the pulse’s highs and lows differ accordingly. This reflects the varying *qi* of yin and yang.

Therefore, forty-five days after the winter solstice, yang *qi* subtly ascends while yin *qi* subtly descends; forty-five days after the summer solstice, yin *qi* subtly ascends while yang *qi* subtly descends. Yin and yang follow their appointed times, and the pulse aligns with them. When their rhythms diverge—like the pulse’s divisions—one can foretell the time of death.

By observing the standards of yin and yang’s ascent and descent, one knows the sequential changes of the channels; by discerning the failures of seasonal *qi*, one knows the cycles of *qi* and blood merging and separating. When these cycles are precise, one can determine the exact time of death.

The pulse holds subtle mysteries—one must examine it closely. Its examination begins with yin and yang, tracing their ascent and descent to uncover the profound functions of the channels’ *qi*. Thus, one must not neglect this study, for yin and yang are its foundational principles.

The origins of these principles stem from the Five Phases, which generate in measured degrees, fitting the seasons’ due order. *(This explains how the pulse’s examination aligns with Heaven and Earth’s responses.)*

To investigate excesses and deficiencies, one must assess their forms against the seasons’ proper *qi*. *(Here, ‘due’ may also be read as ‘numbers,’ aligning with cosmic order.)*

To restore balance—writing off excess, supplementing deficiency—is to follow Heaven and Earth’s natural way. For Heaven and Earth’s method is to reduce excess and replenish deficiency; this is the law of Heaven and Earth. When writing off excess and supplementing deficiency is precise, the same applies to regulating *qi*.

By grasping the fundamental principle, one can know life and death.

Thus, sound harmonizes with the Five Tones, color with the Five Phases, and the pulse with yin and yang. *(Sound corresponds to the five musical notes; color to the five elemental hues; the pulse reveals the ebb and flow of cold and heat.)*

When yin is excessive, one dreams of crossing vast waters in fear; *(water embodies yin, hence the dream of water and dread.)*
When yang is excessive, one dreams of great fires burning; *(fire embodies yang, hence the dream of flames and scorching.)*
When both yin and yang are excessive, one dreams of mutual destruction and injury; *(this mirrors the clashing of opposing forces.)*
When upper *qi* is excessive, one dreams of flying; *(ascending *qi* manifests as flight.)*
When lower *qi* is excessive, one dreams of falling; *(descending *qi* manifests as a fall.)*
After extreme overeating, one dreams of giving; *(internal excess prompts generosity.)*
After extreme hunger, one dreams of taking; *(internal deficiency prompts acquisition.)*
When liver *qi* is excessive, one dreams of anger; *(the liver’s emotion is anger.)*
When lung *qi* is excessive, one dreams of weeping. *(The lung’s sound is sorrowful, hence weeping in dreams.)*

*(Note: The following lines on heart, spleen, and kidney dreams appear misplaced here; they belong to the *Lingshu* [Spiritual Pivot] and are fully recorded in the *Jia-Yi Jing* [ABC Canon].)*

When worms proliferate, one dreams of gathering crowds;»

When worms within the body are numerous, one dreams of gathering crowds;
When long worms are numerous, one dreams of mutual assaults and injuries.
When long worms move, inner tranquility is disrupted;
Inner unrest disturbs the spirit, causing dreams of this nature.

○*(New校正 states: These two lines also seem misplaced here and should belong to another text’s omitted passage.)*

Thus, pulse-taking has its principles: emptiness and stillness are its safeguards.
The earlier mention of pulse response reveals the origin of pulse-taking.
Yet the true method of pulse-taking lies in:
Clearing the mind and calming the will—
Only thus can one preserve the balance of fullness and emptiness without error.
○*(New校正 notes: In the *Jia-Yi Jing* [ABC Canon], 保 [preserve] is written as 宝 [treasure].)*

In spring, the pulse floats like fish swimming on waves;
Though it rises, it has not yet fully ascended.
In summer, it lies at the skin, effervescent with abundance—
A boundless vitality, mirroring nature’s excess.
Effervescent, here meaning level and overflowing.
When *yang qi* is at its peak, the pulse too reflects nature’s abundance,
Easier to grasp and more robust.

In autumn, it descends beneath the skin, as the *mian-chong* worms prepare to leave;
Following the gradual decline of *yang qi*, hence "descends beneath the skin."
How do we know *yang qi* is declining?
The *mian-chong* worms are about to retreat into concealment.
In winter, it rests at the bones, the *mian-chong* worms encircling tightly,
And the virtuous person stays indoors.
"At the bones" refers to the pulse being deep and hidden.
"Encircling tightly" means *yang qi* is withdrawn and stored.
"Virtuous person stays indoors" is a human analogy.
Thus it is said:
Those who understand the inner pulse examine and record its changes,
Those who understand the inner pulse, meaning those who know the pulse’s *qi*,
Thus they examine and establish its guiding principles.
Those who understand the outer pulse complete its cycles.
Those who understand the outer pulse, meaning those who know the physical signs,
Thus they use the five colors to complete and begin anew.
These six principles are the fundamental laws of pulse-taking.
By observing these six, one can then discern the pulse’s transformations.

○*(New校正 states: These preceding lines detail the Yellow Emperor’s inquiry on how the pulse moves in the four seasons.)*

When the heart pulse beats firmly and long, one suffers from a disease where the tongue curls and speech fails;
Beating, meaning it strikes against the hand.
All pulses that beat firmly and long indicate excessive mental strain and extreme depletion of the pulse’s *qi*.
The heart-hand *shao-yin* pulse rises from the heart’s membrane, ascends alongside the throat,
Hence the tongue curls short and speech becomes impossible.
When the pulse is effervescent and scattered, one suffers from dissipation—
The pulse’s *qi* disperses and the body’s fire weakens.
All pulses that are effervescent and scattered indicate *qi* excess and blood deficiency.
Dissipation, meaning the *qi* scatters away.
Weakened, meaning the *qi* encircles and fails to sustain.
The pulse’s *qi*, like a ring’s circulation, when the fire’s season is past,
Naturally dissipates and weakens.
○*(New校正 notes: In the *Jia-Yi Jing* [ABC Canon], 渴 [thirst] is written instead of 环 [ring].)*

When the lung pulse beats firmly and long, one suffers from spitting blood;
Lung *qi* depletion to its extreme causes the vessels to reverse,
And vessel reversal leads to blood leakage—
Hence blood is spat out.
When the pulse is effervescent and scattered, one suffers from *guan-han* (flooding sweats),
Even to the point where sweat no longer disperses and evaporates.
Sweat leaks from the *xuan-fu* (mysterious palace), fluids surge and overflow,
Cold water floods and washes, the skin tightens and sweat is trapped—
Thus the flooding sweat remains, and one no longer sees scattered evaporation.
Flooding, here meaning flooding and washing.
This often occurs in extreme summer heat.
○*(New校正 states: The following lines on each organ’s color are omitted for the heart and lung, suggesting missing text.)*

When the liver pulse beats firmly and long, its color is not green,
One suffers from *diao-ruo* (collapse-like) attacks;
Because blood resides in the lower ribs, it causes wheezing and reverse breathing.
All pulses that show the organ’s *qi* yet fail to match its color
Indicate that the disease does not originate from within—
Rather, it is an external affliction overcoming the body.
The liver’s stored pulse is upright and long,
Hence it is said that when its color is not green,
One suffers from *diao-ruo* (collapse-like) attacks.
The liver governs the two lower ribs,
Hence "because blood resides in the lower ribs."
The liver’s *jue-yin* pulse spreads across the ribs,
Follows the throat’s posterior path;
Its branches, further diverging, pass from the liver to pierce the *ge* (diaphragm),
And ascend to the lungs.
Now, if blood gathers in the lower ribs,
It forces the blood-*qi* to ascend and press against the lungs,
Hence the wheezing and reverse breathing.
When the pulse is effervescent and scattered with a luster,
One suffers from *yi-yin* (overflowing drink)—
Overflowing drink means violent thirst and excessive drinking,
And fluids easily seep into the muscles, skin, intestines, and stomach.
A floating, lustrous complexion is the sign of internal dampness,
And blood deficiency with internal dampness means fluids are not metabolized—
Hence it is said one will suffer from overflowing drink.
The fluids overflow and seep, hence they easily enter the muscles, skin, intestines, and stomach.
○*(New校正 notes: In the *Jia-Yi Jing* [ABC Canon], 溢 [overflow] is written instead of 易 [easily].)*

When the stomach pulse beats firmly and long, its color is red,
One suffers from *zhe-bi* (bent thigh)—
The stomach’s *qi* is depleted, redness appears as the heart’s fire rescues it,
The heart’s nature mirrors fire, hence the red color.
The stomach’s *yang-ming* pulse descends from *qi-chong* (gastric surge),
Passes beneath the spleen, reaching *fu-tu* (hidden rabbit)—
Hence when the spleen is diseased, the thigh feels bent.
When the pulse is steady and scattered, one suffers from *shi-bi* (food stagnation pain).
Pain, here meaning discomfort.
The stomach’s *yang-ming* pulse, with its branches,
Descends from *da-ying* (great welcome) to *ren-ying* (human welcome),
Follows the throat’s posterior path into the *que-pen* (missing basin),
Descends to the *ge* (diaphragm) and connects to the stomach, linking with the spleen—
Hence when food stagnates, pain arises and the *qi* does not disperse.
○*(New校正 states: Though it defines 痹 [pain] as discomfort, the meaning remains unclear.)*

When the spleen pulse beats firmly and long, its color is yellow,
One suffers from shortness of breath;
The spleen’s depletion leaves the lungs unsustained, and the lungs govern breath—
Hence the shortness of breath.
When the pulse is effervescent and scattered with no luster,
One suffers from swelling in the lower leg—
Like water’s appearance.
A floating, lustrous complexion is the sign of dampness,
And without moisture, it is said like water’s appearance.
The spleen’s *tai-yin* pulse rises from the inner anterior ankle,
Ascends to the inner knee, follows the lower leg’s posterior path,
Exits before the *jue-yin* (intermediate *yin*) region,
Ascends along the inner thigh to enter the abdomen—
Hence when the spleen is diseased, the lower leg swells.

When the kidney pulse beats firmly and long, its color is yellow and red,
One suffers from *zhe-yao* (bent waist)—
The yellow-red hue indicates the heart and spleen are drying the kidney,
And the kidney receives external *yang*, hence the waist feels bent.
The waist is the kidney’s domain,
Thus the disease manifests in the center.

「When the pulse is deep yet scattered, it indicates a deficiency of blood—
So severe that it may never return.
The kidney governs water, producing and transforming *jin-ye* (essence-fluid),
But now the kidney-*qi* fails to transform, hence the deficiency of blood,
Until it reaches a state where it cannot be replenished.

The Yellow Emperor said: The newly revised text states:
*"To elaborate on the Yellow Emperor’s question regarding the recovery through counteracting excesses,"*
This is taken from *Yuan Qi’s* original in the *Tang Ye* (Decoction) chapter.

When the pulse of the heart is found to be **urgent** (*jìngjí*),
What disease does this signify?
How does the disease manifest?

**Gui Bo** replied: The disease is called **heart hernia** (*xīn zhuàn*),
And there will be a palpable mass in the lower abdomen.
The heart is the *mao* (masculine) **zang** (viscera),
Its *qi* corresponds to *yang*,
But now the pulse is cold in nature, hence the hernia.
All pulses that are **tense and urgent** (*jìngjí*) are signs of **cold**.

*Form* here refers to the **manifestation of the disease**.

The Yellow Emperor said: How can this be explained?
**Gui Bo** replied: The heart is the *mao* (masculine) **zang**,
And the small intestine serves as its **minister** (*shǐ*).
Thus it is said that a mass will appear in the lower abdomen.
The lower abdomen is the small intestine’s domain.
The *Ling Lan Mi Dian Lun* states:
*"The small intestine is the organ that receives and distributes."*

Because it receives and distributes, the mass resides within.
The Yellow Emperor said: When the pulse of the stomach is examined,
How does the disease manifest?
**Gui Bo** replied: A **stomach pulse** that is **full** (*shí*) causes distension,
A **stomach pulse** that is **empty** (*xū*) causes diarrhea.
When the pulse is **full**, the *qi* is in excess, hence distension and fullness;
When the pulse is **empty**, the *qi* is insufficient, hence diarrhea.

*The newly revised text states:*
*"This elaborates on the Yellow Emperor’s prior inquiry about the location of the disease."*

The Yellow Emperor said: What is meant by *"disease that has formed and then changes"*?

Gui Bo replied:
*"The **Wind** transforms into **Cold and Heat**;
*The *Generations of Vital Qi and Its Celestial Connection* states:*
'It arises from exposure to **dew and wind**,
thus generating **Cold and Heat**.'
Hence, **Wind** transforms into **Cold and Heat**.*

**Zhàng** transforms into **consumptive wasting** (*xiāozhòng*).
*Zhàng* refers to **damp-heat**.
When **damp-heat** accumulates within, it thus alters into **consumptive wasting**.
The signs of **consumptive wasting** are: one eats well yet remains thin.

*The newly revised text states:*
'This elaborates on the prior inquiry to the Yellow Emperor: how does the disease transform?'

The Yellow Emperor said: What is meant by *"disease that has formed and then changes"*?
Gui Bo replied: **Stiffness and flaccidity** (*tānzhòng*), **muscle atrophy** (*jīnrèn*), **tendon contractions and bone pain** (*jiǎnluán gǔtòng*), these are all from what?
*An*, what is this?
Speaking of how they arise.

Gui Bo replied: This is **swelling from Cold-qi** (*hánqì zhī zhòng*), a variation of the **Eight Winds**.
The **Eight Winds** are the winds from the **Eight Directions**.
Yet **swelling and flaccidity** arise from injury by the **winds from the Southeast and Southwest**;
**Tendon contractions and bone pain** arise from injury by the **winds from the Northeast and North**.

*The *Spirit Pivot Classic* states:*
'When **Wind** comes from the **Northeast**, it is called **Infant Wind** (*yīng'ér fēng*), and when it injures a person, it manifests externally in the **tendons and joints**.'
'When **Wind** comes from the **Southeast**, it is called **Weak Wind** (*ruòfēng*), and when it injures a person, it manifests externally in the **muscles**.'
'When **Wind** comes from the **Southwest**, it is called **Plotting Wind** (*móufēng*), and when it injures a person, it manifests externally in the **flesh**.'
'When **Wind** comes from the **North**, it is called **Great Rigid Wind** (*dàgāng fēng*), and when it injures a person, it manifests externally in the **bones**.'

From these **Four Winds**' variations, the **Three Diseases** arise, hence the subsequent inquiry corresponds to this.

The Yellow Emperor said: How should they be treated?
Gui Bo replied: These are diseases of the **Four Seasons**,
and they should be treated by **counteracting their prevailing influences** (*shìng*), thus achieving recovery.
*Shìng* means **conquering and overcoming**.
As in **Metal conquers Wood**, **Wood conquers Earth**, **Earth conquers Water**, **Water conquers Fire**, **Fire conquers Metal**.
This is the principle of **mutual overcoming**.

The Yellow Emperor said: When there are **pre-existing diseases** (*gùbìng*) causing the **Five Zàng** to move,
and further injuring the **pulse and complexion** (*mài sè*),
how can one discern whether the disease is **chronic** (*jiǔ*) or **acute** (*bào*)?

Gui Bo replied: Your inquiry is thorough indeed.
If the **pulse is fine** (*xiǎo*) and the **complexion is not diminished** (*sè bù duó*), it is a **new disease** (*xīnbìng*).
The **vitality remains strong** (*shén yóu qiáng*).

If the **pulse is not diminished** but the **complexion is diminished**, this is a **chronic disease** (*jiǔbìng*).
The **vitality is sustained** while **pathogenic forces** (*xié*) overwhelm the **qi**.

If the **pulse and the Five Colors** are both diminished, this is a **chronic disease**.
The **vitality and qi** are both declining.

If the **pulse and the Five Colors** are neither diminished, this is a **new disease**.
The **vitality and qi** are both strong.

When the **Liver** and **Kidney** pulses arrive simultaneously,
their **complexion** is **sallow and red** (*cāng chì*),
it indicates **injury from pathogenic forces** (*huǐshāng*).
If **blood is not yet visible**, it means the **pathogenic forces have not yet manifested**.
If **blood is already visible**, it means **dampness** (*shī*) is like **Water** (*shuǐ*) flooding the abdomen.

*Why is this so?*
Because the **Liver**'s pulse is **sallow**, the **Heart**'s pulse is **red**,
and when the **Heart**'s pulse appears, it should be **robust** (*hóng*).
The **Kidney**'s pulse should appear when the **complexion is black** (*sè hēi*).
Now, the **Kidney**'s pulse arrives, yet the **complexion is red** instead—
hence, it is due to **injury from pathogenic forces**,
and **blood has not yet manifested**.

If **blood is already visible**, then it is **damp-qi** and **Water** accumulating in the abdomen.

The pulse within the *cùn* (寸) and the two sides of the *chǐ* (尺) indicates the *jì xié* (季胁).

The *cùn* is the region within the *chǐzé* (尺泽) point.
The two sides refer to the external aspects of the *chǐ* (尺) on each side.
Since *jì xié* (季胁) is near the **Kidney**, the *chǐ* (尺) governs it,
thus the pulse within the *cùn* (寸) and the two sides of the *chǐ* (尺) indicates the *jì xié* (季胁).

The external side of the *chǐ* (尺) is used to diagnose the **Kidney**,
and the internal side of the *chǐ* (尺) is used to diagnose conditions within the abdomen.
The external side of the *chǐ* (尺) refers to its external aspect,
and the internal side of the *chǐ* (尺) refers to its internal aspect.
Below the external side of the *chǐ* (尺) on both sides are the *jì xié* (季胁) divisions,
above the *jì xié* (季胁) are the **Kidney** divisions,
and within the *jì xié* (季胁) are the divisions of the abdomen.

On the *chǐ* (尺) above:
The left external side diagnoses the **Liver**,
and the internal side diagnoses the *gé* (鬲).
The **Liver** governs the *gé* (鬲), which is the *gé* (鬲) itself.

The right external side diagnoses the **Stomach**,
and the internal side diagnoses the **Spleen**.
The **Spleen** resides centrally, so it is diagnosed from the internal side.
The **Stomach** is the *shì* (市), so it is diagnosed from the external side.
Above the *chǐ* (尺) above:
The right external side diagnoses the **Lung**,
and the internal side diagnoses the chest’s central region.
Since the **Lung**’s lobes hang externally, it is diagnosed from the external side.
The chest’s central region governs the *qìguǎn* (气管), so it is diagnosed from the internal side.

The left external side diagnoses the **Heart**,
and the internal side diagnoses the *tánzhōng* (膻中).
The **Heart** governs the *gé* (鬲) within the chest,
and the *tánzhōng* (膻中) is the *qìhǎi* (气海), where the voice originates.
*Newly corrected version*: It is detailed in Wang’s text that the *tánzhōng* (膻中) refers to the *ài* (隘).
This is likely an error; the previous context suggests otherwise.

For diagnosis, the front is examined first, and the back is examined afterward.
The upper-front refers to the left *cùnkǒu* (寸口).
The lower-front refers to the chest’s anterior region, including the *qìhǎi* (气海) and the *qìhǎi* (气海) itself.
The upper-back refers to the right *cùnkǒu* (寸口).
The lower-back refers to the chest’s posterior region, including the back and the *qìguǎn* (气管).

The uppermost region diagnoses matters of the chest and throat,
while the lowermost region diagnoses the lower abdomen, lumbar spine, thighs, knees,
and issues extending through the legs to the feet.
The uppermost region reaches the *yújì* (鱼际) point,
while the lowermost region refers to the pulse’s movements at the end of the *chǐ* (尺).

The lower abdomen is the *bāo* (胞, bladder).
The movements of *qi* (气) in the lumbar spine, thighs, knees, and central leg,
as well as their connections and locations, are all diagnosed by examining their nearness or distance.
This discerns their good or evil nature.

If the pulse is **coarse and large** (*cūdà*), it indicates **deficient Yin** and **excessive Yang**,
resulting in **heat within the body** (*rèzhōng*).
Coarse and large refers to a **robust and expansive pulse** (*mài hóngdà*).
A robust pulse signifies heat, hence **heat within the body**.

If the pulse **arrives swiftly and departs slowly** (*láijíqùxú*), with **fullness above and emptiness below** (*shàngshíxiàxū*),
it indicates **syncope and vertigo** (*juéxiānjì*).
If the pulse **arrives slowly and departs swiftly** (*láixúqùjí*), with **emptiness above and fullness below** (*shàngxūxiàshí*),
it indicates **evil wind** (*èfēng*).
This is also a pulse condition.
Thus, when **evil wind** occurs within the body,
it is due to **excessive Yang**,
because the pulse is **empty above** (*shàngxū*), hence **excessive Yang**.

If the pulse is **deep, fine, and rapid** (*chénxìshuò*) in both sides of the *chǐ* (尺),
it indicates **Kidney’s *shàoyīn* (少阴) syncope** (*shàoyīn jué*).
If the pulse in the *chǐ* (尺) is **deep, fine, and rapid** (*chénxìshuò*),
it is due to the **Kidney’s *shàoyīn* (少阴) *qi* (气) in reverse** (*nì*).
Why?
Because the *chǐ* (尺) pulse should not appear rapid (*shuò*).
If it is rapid, it is called syncope (*jué*).
If the pulse is **deep, fine, and rapid** (*chénxìshuò*) on both sides of the *chǐ* (尺),
it refers to the **Kidney’s *shàoyīn* (少阴) *qi* (气)**.

If the pulse is **fine, deep, and scattered** (*xìchénsàn*), it indicates **cold and heat** (*hánrè*).
If the pulse is **floating and scattered** (*fú sàn*), it indicates **chest collapse** (*xiōngpū*).
A floating pulse signifies **emptiness** (*xū*),
and scattered indicates **deficient *qi* (气)** (*bùzú*).
When *qi* (气) is empty and blood is deficient, it causes **dizziness and collapse** (*tóuxuàn ér pūdǎo*).
The *xiōng* (胸) is pronounced as *shùn* (顺).

If the pulse is **floating but not rapid** (*fú ér bùzào*), it is all in the **Yang meridians** (*yángmài*).
This indicates **heat**.
If the pulse is **rapid** (*zào*), the disease is in the **hand Yang meridians** (*shǒuyángmài*).
This refers to the general principle.
If the pulse is merely **floating but not rapid** (*fú ér bùzào*),
the disease is in the **foot Yang meridians** (*zúyángmài*).
Hence it is said: If the pulse is **rapid** (*zào*), the disease is in the **hand** (*shǒu*).
**Yang** represents **fire-qi**, hence **heat**.

If the pulse is **fine and deep** (*xìchén*), it is all in the **Yin meridians** (*yīnmài*).
This indicates **bone pain** (*gǔtòng*).
If the pulse is **static** (*jìng*), the disease is in the **foot** (*zú*).
If the pulse is **fine, deep, and rapid** (*xìchénzào*), the disease originates in the **hand Yin meridians** (*shǒuyīnmài*).
If the pulse is **static** (*jìng*), the disease originates in the **foot Yin meridians** (*zúyīnmài*).
Hence it is said: If the pulse is **static** (*jìng*), the disease is in the **foot** (*zú*).
**Yin** governs the **bones**, hence **bone pain**.

If the pulse **beats rapidly once and then stops** (*shuòdòng yīdài*), it indicates the disease is in the **Yang meridians** (*yángmài*),
resulting in **diarrhea and bloody stools** (*xièjí biānxìng xuè*).
*Dài* (代) means **cessation** (*zhǐ*).
A rapid pulse that stops once signifies the **Yang *qi* (气)**’s disease, hence **disease in the Yang meridians**.
This is so because diarrhea and bloody stools are associated with such a pulse.

If the pulse is **rough upon palpation** (*sè*), it indicates **excessive Yang *qi*** (*yángqì yǒuyú*).
If the pulse is **slippery** (*huá*), it indicates **excessive Yin *qi*** (*yīnqì yǒuyú*).
*Newly corrected version*: It is detailed that "excessive *qi*" (*qìduō*) is likely an error; it should be **excessive blood** (*xuèduō*).

**Excessive Yang *qi*** causes **body heat without sweat** (*shēnrè wúhàn*),
and **cold body with sweat** (*hànshēn lěng*).
Blood deficiency and *qi* excess can be inferred from this.

If both **Yin and Yang *qi*** are excessive (*yīnyáng yǒuyú*),
there is **no sweat and coldness** (*wúhàn ér hán*).
**Excessive Yin *qi*** causes **excessive Yang without sweat** (*yángyú wúhàn*)
and **excessive Yin with cold body** (*yīnyú shēnhán*),
hence **no sweat and coldness**.

If the **skin feels as though Yin and Yang *qi*** are both excessive (*fúruò yīnyáng yǒuyú*),
and when **pushed externally**, the pulse **does not emerge externally** (*nèi ér bù wàinèi*),
it indicates **accumulation in the heart and abdomen** (*xīnfù zhōngjī*).
The pulse is examined at the *jīn* (筋) of the arm.
If the examination is not precise (*bùshěn*),
push the *jīn* (筋) outward to make the pulse **travel externally but not emerge externally** (*wàixíng nèi ér bù chū wàinèi*),
it is due to **accumulation within the heart and abdomen**.

If when **pushed internally**, the pulse **does not emerge internally** (*wàinèi ér bù nèinèi*),
it indicates **body heat** (*shēnrè*).
The pulse is distant from the arm’s *jīn* (筋).
If pushed to make it **near and not distant** (*yuǎn ér bùjìn*),
it is **excessive Yang *qi***, hence **body heat**.

If when **pushed upward**, the pulse **does not descend** (*shàng ér bùxià*),
it indicates **lumbar and foot coldness** (*yāozú qīng*).
If the pulse is pushed and examined, and it **rushes upward strongly** (*mài shàng yǒng shèng*),
it is due to **excessive Yang *qi***, hence **lumbar and foot coldness** (*yāozú líng*).
*Newly corrected version*: According to the *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* (甲乙经), "upward and not downward" (*shàng ér bùxià*) should be "downward and not upward" (*xià ér bùshàng*).

If when **pushed downward**, the pulse **does not ascend** (*xià ér bùshàng*),
it indicates **head and neck pain** (*tóuxiàng tòng*).
If the pulse is pushed and examined, and it **sinks downward** (*mài chén xià chè*),
it is due to **excessive Yang *qi***, hence **head and neck pain**.

If upon **pressing to the bone** (*ànzhī zhìgǔ*), the pulse’s *qi* (气) is **weak** (*shǎo*),
it indicates **lumbar and spinal pain** (*yāobèi tòng ér shēn yǒuzhì*).

The **excessive Yin *qi*** (阴气大过) is the cause of this condition.

**Discourse on the Normal Person’s Qi Manifestations**

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What is a normal person?"*
A normal person refers to one whose **qi** and seasonal rhythms are harmoniously balanced.

Qìbó replied:
*"In a normal person, the pulse moves twice with each inhalation and twice with each exhalation. When breathing ceases, the pulse moves five times. Accounting for occasional deep sighs, this is called a normal person. A normal person is one who is free of illness.*

*The **jingmai** (channel vessels) complete one full circuit around the body, totaling sixteen *zhàng* two *chǐ* in length. Since the pulse moves twice with each breath and once more when breathing ceases—five movements in total—over 270 such pauses, the **qi** completes a full circuit. When 50 cycles are exhausted—13,500 pauses—the **qi** traverses 810 *zhàng*. Thus, it aligns with the Heavenly norm, neither deficient nor excessive, maintaining balanced **qi** manifestations—hence, the term *normal person*.

*"Normally, one adjusts the sick by observing the healthy. Since the physician is not ill, the method is to regulate the sick by comparing them to the normal pulse.*

*"If the pulse moves once per inhalation and once per exhalation, this is *shàoqì* (insufficient **qi**). If the pulse moves once with each breath—half the normal rate—over 270 pauses, the **qi** travels only 81 *zhàng* 1 *chǐ*. Over 13,500 pauses, it traverses 450 *zhàng*. Thus, the principle of *shàoqì* is evident.*

*"If the pulse moves three times per inhalation and exhalation, with agitation at the *cùn* (wrist) position, and the *cùn* is hot, this indicates *wēn* (warmth disease). If the *cùn* is not hot but the pulse is slippery, this is *fēng* (wind disease); if the pulse is rough, this is *bì* (numbness/atrophy). If the pulse moves three times per breath—exceeding half the normal rate—over 270 breaths, the **qi** travels roughly 24 *zhàng* 3 *chǐ*. Thus, the signs of illness manifest.*

*"The *cùn* position belongs to **yin**; the *cùn* (wrist) position belongs to **yang**. If both **yin** and **yang** are hot, this is *wēn* (warmth). If only **yang** is agitated and excessive, this is *fēng* (wind) invading the **yang**.

*The *Mài Yào Jīngwēi Lùn* states: *"One who contracts *fēng* (wind) has received **yang qi**."*

*"Slippery pulses indicate excessive **yang**, hence *fēng* (wind) disease. Rough pulses indicate blood deficiency, hence *bì* (numbness/atrophy). Agitation refers to restlessness.*

**New Annotation:** *"According to the *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng*, the phrase 'pulse rough, *bì* (atrophy)' is absent, and the following text repeats."*

*"If the pulse moves four times per inhalation—or ceases entirely—this is death. If the pulse is intermittently slow and fast, this is also death. If the pulse moves four times per breath—exceeding double the normal rate—over 270 breaths, the **qi** travels 32 *zhàng* 4 *chǐ*. What of cases beyond this?*

*The *Mài Fǎ* states: *"Four movements indicate depletion of essence; five movements indicate death."* Since four movements approach five, death follows. If the pulse ceases entirely, the **True Heavenly Qi** is exhausted. If it is intermittently rapid and slow, the **stomach’s vital essence** is also **#3**.*

**New Annotation:** *"In other editions, '斯' (*sī*) is written as '败' (*bài*)."*

*"The normal person’s constant **qi** is rooted in the **stomach**. The **stomach** is the source of the normal person’s **qi**, supplied by the **stomach’s sea** of **qi**. As the *Língshū Jīng* states: *"The **stomach** is the sea of water and grain."* The *Zhènglǐ Lùn* states: *"When grain enters the **stomach**, the pulse pathways move."*

*"If a person lacks **stomach qi**, this is *nì* (inversion)—a sign of death. *Nì* refers to reversal of the normal pulse pattern.*

**New Annotation:** *"The *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng* states: *"Humans normally draw **qi** from the **stomach**; the pulse takes **stomach qi** as its root. Lack of **stomach qi** is *nì*; *nì* is death."*

*"In spring, if the **stomach** pulse is slightly *xuán* (tight), this is normal. *Xuán* means subtly resembling *xuán*, not that it is overtly *xuán*. The meanings of *gōu* (hook-like), *ruò* (weak), *máo* (hair-like), and *shí* (stone-like) follow similarly.*

*"If *xuán* dominates while **stomach qi** is weak, this indicates **liver** disease. If only *xuán* appears without **stomach qi**, this is death—meaning excessively taut, like a newly strung bowstring.*

*"If the pulse has a *máo* (hair-like) quality, this indicates autumn illness. *Máo* is the autumn pulse, the **qi** of metal. If *máo* is extreme, this is *jīnbìng* (current illness). Wood is invaded by metal’s evil, hence *jīnbìng*. The **liver**’s true essence disperses, for the **liver** stores the **qi** of tendons and membranes. This mirrors the **yang qi**’s dispersion. The *Cángqì Fǎshí Lùn* states: *"The **liver** desires dispersion; urgently eat pungent foods to disperse it."* This follows the **qi**’s natural order.*

*"In summer, if the **stomach** pulse is slightly *gōu* (hook-like), this is normal. If *gōu* dominates while **stomach qi** is weak, this indicates **heart** disease. If only *gōu* appears without **stomach qi**, this is death—meaning curved forward and backward, like a hook on a belt.*

*"If the pulse has a *shí* (stone-like) quality, this indicates winter illness. *Shí* is the winter pulse, the **qi** of water. If *shí* is extreme, this is *jīnbìng* (current illness). Fire is overwhelmed by water, hence *jīnbìng*. The **heart**’s true essence communicates with the **heart**, for the **heart** stores the **qi** of blood and vessels. This mirrors the **yang qi**’s flaming intensity. The *Cángqì Fǎshí Lùn* states: *"The **heart** desires depth; urgently eat salty foods to regulate it."* This follows the **qi**’s natural order.*

*"In late summer, if the **stomach** pulse is slightly *yìruò* (soft-weak), this is normal. If *ruò* dominates while **stomach qi** is weak, this indicates **spleen** disease. If *ruò* appears without **stomach qi**, this is death—meaning movement that halts midway, unable to return.*

*"If *yìruò* has a *shí* (stone-like) quality, this indicates winter illness. *Shí* is the winter pulse, the **qi** of water. Following the cycle of conquest, *shí* should correspond to *xuán* (tight). Since late summer’s earth is severed, it is called *shí*. If *ruò* is extreme, this is *jīnbìng* (current illness). Extreme weakness indicates earth **qi** deficiency, hence *jīnbìng*.

**New Annotation:** *"The *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng* writes *ruò* as *shí*."*

*"The **spleen**’s true essence moistens, for the **spleen** contains the **qi** of flesh and muscles. Since it holds water and grain, its true essence is moistening.*

*"In autumn, if the **stomach** pulse is slightly *máo* (hair-like) and white, this is normal. If *máo* dominates while **stomach qi** is weak, this indicates **lung** disease. If only *máo* appears without **stomach qi**, this is death—meaning floating like down, as if wind-blown hair.*

*"If *máo* has a *xuán* (tight) quality, this indicates spring illness. *Xuán* is the spring pulse, the **qi** of wood. Following the cycle of overaction, *xuán* should correspond to *gōu* (hook-like). When metal’s **qi** oppresses the **liver**, the pulse becomes *xuán* instead of *gōu*. If *xuán* is extreme, this is *jīnbìng* (current illness). Wood’s **qi** counterattacks metal, hence *jīnbìng*."*

The **true essence** is elevated in the **lungs**, for it governs the **honorific** and **defensive** *qi* of yin and yang.
The **lungs** reside in the upper burner, hence the **true essence** is elevated.
The *Ling Shu Jing* states:
*"The path of the **honorific** *qi* takes nourishment from grain as its substance. When grain enters the **stomach**, its *qi* is transmitted to the **lungs**, overflowing within and dispersing outward. When its essence is concentrated, it courses through the **channels and collaterals**.*
Since it is proclaimed from the **lungs**, it is said to govern the **honorific** and **defensive** *qi* of yin and yang.

*Newly corrected text notes: In another version, "substance" (实) is written as "treasure" (宝).*

In winter, if the **stomach** pulse is slightly *shí* (stone-like) and white, this is normal. If *shí* dominates while **stomach** *qi* is weak, this indicates **kidney** disease. If only *shí* appears without **stomach** *qi*, this is death—meaning it snatches like a rope, *bìbì* like a bouncing stone.

If *shí* has a *gōu* (hook-like) quality, this is summer illness.
*Gōu* is the summer pulse, the *qi* of fire combined with earth.
Following the cycle of overaction, *gōu* should be *ruò* (weak). Earth reigns in late summer, and its proper form is not seen, hence *shí* appears with *gōu*, including its earthly influence.
If *gōu* is extreme, this is *jīnbìng* (current illness).
Water receives the pathogenic *qi* of fire and earth, hence *jīnbìng*.

The **true essence** descends to the **kidneys**, for the **kidneys** house the *qi* of bone and marrow.
The **kidneys** dwell in the lower burner, hence the **true essence** descends.
The **kidneys** transform bone and marrow, hence they house the *qi* of bone and marrow.

The **stomach’s** great collateral is called *Xūlǐ* (Empty Interior). It pierces the *è* (gullet) and connects with the **lungs**, emerging beneath the left breast. Its movement responds to clothing—this is the **gathering** *qi* pulse.
*Gathering* means "venerable," "master"—it refers to the sovereign master of the twelve **channels**.
The passage "pierces the *è* and connects with the **lungs**, emerging beneath the left breast" means that from the *è*, it emerges beneath the breast and then connects with the **lungs**.

If there is severe wheezing and frequent interruption, then the illness lies within the center.
*Interruption* means a temporary cessation.

If it knots and becomes horizontal, there is a mass.
If the pulse does not arrive, this is death.

The pulse movements beneath the left breast are all as described.

The **center** refers to the abdomen.

When its movement responds to clothing beneath the breast, the **gathering** *qi* is depleted.
*Depleted* means "discharged" or "exhausted."

○Newly corrected: According to Quán Yuánqǐ’s original text, these eleven characters are absent. The *Jiǎ Yǐ Jīng* (A-B Classic) also lacks them. Examining the context above and below, these eleven characters seem superfluous and should be omitted.

To discern whether the *cùnkǒu* (radial wrist) pulse is excessive or insufficient:
If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is short within the middle hand position, it indicates **headache**.
If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is long within the middle hand position, it indicates **foot arch pain** (陉, *xíng* – here referring to the plantar region).
*Short* signifies that the **yang** *qi* is insufficient, hence the illness manifests in the **head**.
*Long* signifies that the **yin** *qi* is excessive, hence the illness manifests in the **foot**.

If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is hurried and strikes upward, it indicates **shoulder and back pain**.
When **yang** *qi* is excessive in the upper region, **shoulder and back pain** ensues.

If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is deep and firm, it indicates illness within the **center**.
If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is superficial and excessive, it indicates illness in the **exterior**.
*Firm* corresponds to **yin**, hence illness within the **center**.
*Superficial and excessive* corresponds to **yang**, hence illness in the **exterior**.

If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is deep and weak, it indicates **alternating cold and heat** as well as **hernia and lower abdominal pain**.
*Deep* signifies **cold**, *weak* signifies **heat**, hence it is called **alternating cold and heat**.
Moreover, *deep* signifies **yin** excess, *weak* signifies **yang** deficiency—when excess and deficiency clash, it corresponds to **alternating cold and heat**, not necessarily **hernia** or **lower abdominal pain**; this may be an ancient error in the text.

○Newly corrected: According to the *Jiǎ Yǐ Jīng*, these fifteen characters are absent. Since the following passage already mentions *cùnkǒu* pulse with wheezing, indicating **alternating cold and heat**, and states that a *pulse* that is hurried indicates **hernia and lower abdominal pain**, this passage seems redundant and should be omitted.

If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is deep and horizontal, it indicates **accumulation beneath the ribs** and **pain from transverse masses in the abdomen**.
This is also **yin** *qi* congealing internally.

If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is deep and wheezing, it indicates **alternating cold and heat**.
*Wheezing* means **yang** *qi* is drawn upward, *deep* means **yin** *qi* is in contention—their clash results in **alternating cold and heat**.

If the pulse is excessive, slippery, and firm, it indicates illness in the **exterior**.
If the pulse is small, solid, and firm, it indicates illness in the **interior**.
*Excessive and slippery* corresponds to **yang**, *small and solid* corresponds to **yin**—when **yin** is diseased, the illness lies within; when **yang** is diseased, the illness lies in the **exterior**.

If the pulse is small, weak, and rough, it is called **long-standing illness**.
*Small* signifies *qi* deficiency, *rough* signifies lack of blood—when blood and *qi* are both deficient and weak, it is called **chronic illness**.

If the pulse is slippery, superficial, and rapid, it is called **recent illness**.
*Slippery and superficial* signifies **yang** is abundant, *rapid* signifies *qi* is full—when **yang** is abundant and *qi* is full, it is called **acute and superficial illness**.

If the pulse is hurried, it indicates **hernia and lower abdominal pain**.
This is the pulse corresponding to the earlier **hernia and lower abdominal pain** description.
It states that *deep and weak* does not match **hernia**, while *deep and hurried* aligns with the diagnosis.

If the pulse is slippery, it indicates **wind**.
If the pulse is rough, it indicates **stiffness** (痹, *bì* – here referring to **bi syndrome**, a type of arthralgia).
*Slippery* corresponds to **yang**; when **yang** is diseased, it becomes **wind**.
*Rough* corresponds to **yin**; when **yin** is diseased, it becomes **bi syndrome**.

If the pulse is relaxed and slippery, it indicates **heat within**.
If the pulse is excessive and taut, it indicates **distension**.
*Relaxed* means a loose and unrestrained state, not slow movement.
When **yang** *qi* is excessive in the **center**, the pulse becomes slippery and relaxed.
When **cold** *qi* fills and stagnates, the pulse becomes excessive and taut.
*Excessive and taut* means excessive and fullness.
When the pulse aligns with **yin** and **yang**, the illness is easily cured.
When the pulse opposes **yin** and **yang**, the illness is difficult to cure.
When the pulse and illness correspond, it is called **alignment**.
When the pulse and illness contradict, it is called **opposition**.

When the pulse follows the natural order of the four seasons, it is said that there is **no other illness**.
When the pulse contradicts the four seasons or does not correspond to the **zàng** (viscera), it is said that the illness is **difficult to cure**.
Spring with autumn pulse, summer with winter pulse, autumn with summer pulse, winter with pulse of all four seasons—these are all cases of **contradicting the seasons**, where *qi* does not align, hence the illness is **difficult to cure**.

If the arm has many **green** (青, *qīng* – here referring to **blue-green**) veins, it indicates **blood depletion**.
When blood is scarce and the pulse is hollow, cold invades as a guest—cold congeals the blood, hence the **blue-green** pulse color.

If the *chǐ* (ulnar) pulse is relaxed and rough, it is called **transmission of depletion**.
The *chǐ* is the **yin** region, governed by the **abdomen** and **kidneys**.
*Relaxed* signifies **heat within**, *rough* signifies lack of blood—when there is **heat** and lack of blood, it is **transmission of depletion**, and it cannot be named otherwise.

Yet, it is neither cold nor hot, weak nor strong, deficient nor excessive—when it cannot be named, it is called **transmission of depletion**.
The *Pulse Essentials* states: "The *chǐ* pulse externally is used to observe the **kidneys**, internally to observe the **abdomen**." This clarifies that the **abdomen** and **kidneys** govern the *chǐ* pulse.
*Deficient* (俘, *fǔ* – pronounced *nǎng*, meaning **exhausted or weakened**).

If the pulse is excessive while lying at rest, it indicates **blood depletion**.
Prolonged rest injures *qi*—when *qi* is injured, the pulse should be faint upon diagnosis. Now the pulse is excessive but not faint, meaning blood has left and *qi* has no master—thus it is.

*Excessive* means rapid and forcefully bounding.

If the *chǐ* pulse is rough while the *chǐ* pulse is slippery, it indicates **profuse sweating**.
It refers to the *chǐ* skin being rough while the *chǐ* pulse is slippery—when the skin is rough, the **nutritive** (荣, *ròng*) blood is depleted within, and when the pulse is slippery, **yang** *qi* remains within. With blood depletion and residual **yang** *qi*, profuse sweating occurs, and the pulse becomes like this.

If the *chǐ* pulse is cold and the pulse is fine, it indicates **posterior leakage** (后泄).
The *chǐ* governs the lower **center** (焦, *jiāo*), and diagnosis should correspond to the intestines and abdomen—hence, when the skin is cold and the pulse is fine, posterior leakage naturally follows.
The *Pulse Law* states: "When **yin** is faint, it signifies **posterior leakage**."

If the *chǐ* pulse is coarse and the **zàng** (viscera) pulse is always hot, it is called **heat within**.
This refers to **heat within the lower center** (焦, *jiāo*).
**Liver** sees death when encountering *gēng xīn* (庚辛, the 7th and 8th heavenly stems—**metal**), which **overcomes** the **liver’s** wood.
**Heart** sees death when encountering *rén guǐ* (壬癸, the 9th and 10th heavenly stems—**water**), which **extinguishes** the **heart’s** fire.
**Spleen** sees death when encountering *jiǎ yǐ* (甲乙, the 1st and 2nd heavenly stems—**wood**), which **overpowers** the **spleen’s** earth.
**Lungs** see death when encountering *bǐng dīng* (丙丁, the 3rd and 4th heavenly stems—**fire**), which **consumes** the **lungs’** metal.
**Kidneys** see death when encountering *wù jǐ* (戊己, the 5th and 6th heavenly stems—**earth**), which **punishes** the **kidneys’** water.
This is called **death when the true viscera appear**.
This also aligns with the *Three Divisions and Nine Regions* (三部九候论) stating that when the **true viscera** pulse appears, it signifies **imminent death**.
If the *chǐ* pulse is coarse and the **zàng** (viscera) pulse also appears, the same applies.

If the neck pulse moves with wheezing and rapid coughing, it indicates **water** (水气).
When **water** *qi* overflows upward, the **lungs** are scorched by heat, and **yang** *qi* reverses upward—hence the neck pulse is excessive and bounding, accompanied by coughing and wheezing.
The **neck pulse** refers to the *rén yíng* (人迎) pulse beneath the ear and beside the Adam’s apple.

The eyes appear slightly swollen as though from external *cánchóng* (蚕起, **larvae eruptions**),—this is called **water**.

The *Píng Rè Bìng Lùn* (评热病论) states: **"Water" is yin**; the area beneath the eyes is also yin; the abdomen is where the most profound yin resides.** Thus, when **water** accumulates in the abdomen, it must cause the region beneath the eyes to swell. If urine is yellow and red, yet without external heat, this is **jaundice**. **Jaundice** is **labor** (労). When the **kidneys** are strained by **labor**, the **bladder** becomes heated, hence the urine is yellow and red. The *Zhèng Lùn* (正理论) states: This is called **labor jaundice**, contracted through **female labor**.

*Newly corrected annotations* read: **"According to Wang’s commentary, jaundice is not correctly interpreted as *labor* (労). If one claims that female labor causes jaundice, that may be acceptable; but if jaundice itself is equated with *labor*, then it is incorrect.**

If one eats as though starving after a meal, this is **stomach jaundice**. This indicates **stomach heat**; heat causes **digestion of grains**, hence the sensation of hunger immediately after eating. Facial swelling is called **wind**.

If facial swelling occurs, this is the **diagnosis of *zhòu fēng*** (胄风, **head-wind**). Why? The **stomach’s** *yángmíng* (阳明) pulse arises at the **nose**, passes through the **midline**, and descends along the **outer nasal pathway**—thus the condition.

If the **legs’ meridians** swell, this is **water**. This signifies **water in the lower burner**. The **kidneys’** *shǎoyīn* (少阴) pulse emerges from the **sole of the foot**, ascends along the **inner leg meridian**, and passes through the **groin**, piercing the **liver’s upper cavity**—thus, water in the lower burner causes the **legs’ meridians** to swell.

If the eyes are yellow, this is called **yellow jaundice**. When **yang** *qi* flares in the upper body, heat accumulates in the **chest**, and **yang-heat** ascends to the **eyes**, causing their yellowing. The *Língshū Jīng* (灵枢经) states: **Yellow eyes signify illness in the chest.**

For women, the **hand’s *shǎoyīn*** (少阴) pulse.
*Newly corrected annotations* read: **"According to Quán Yuánqǐ’s original text, it should be the *shǎoyīn* pulse of the **foot**."**

When the pulse beats strongly, this is called **the "Rènzǐ" (任子) pulse**. The **hand’s *shǎoyīn*** (少阴) pulse refers to the hollow behind the palm where the pulse moves in response to pressing the little finger—this is the **pulse of the *shǎoyīn* meridian**. The *Língshū Jīng* (灵枢经) states: **"The *shǎoyīn* has no outlet—does the heart not fall ill?"** Ghībhū (岐伯) replied: **"When its external meridian is diseased but the organ itself is not, one examines only the meridian at the sharp end of the bone behind the palm."** This is what is meant.

The term **"dòng" (动)** refers to the **moving pulse**. The **moving pulse** is like a bean in size, trembling and shaking violently. The *Zhènglǐlùn* (正理论) states: **"When the yin and yang pulses are both thin, it is called the moving pulse."** Additionally, the *Jīngmài Biélùn* (经脉别论) states: **"When the yin pulse is thin and the yang pulse is separate, it is called having a child."**
*Newly corrected annotations*: **"According to the *Jīngmài Biélùn*, this passage does not exist."**

The pulse may run counter or in accordance with the four seasons, yet the form of the organs remains unchanged. In spring and summer, the pulse is thin, *Newly corrected annotations*: **"According to the *Yùjī Zhēnlùn* (玉机真藏论), 'thin' (瘦) should be annotated as 'depressed and rough' (沉涩)."** In autumn and winter, the pulse is floating and large, which is called **running counter to the four seasons**. When the pulse is thin in spring and summer, it is excessively fine. When the pulse is floating and large in autumn and winter, it does not conform to the season. According to the general principle, in spring and summer the pulse should be floating and large but instead is depressed and fine, while in autumn and winter it should be fine but instead is floating and large—thus, it is called **not conforming to the season**.

*Newly corrected annotations*: **"According to the *Yùjī Zhēnlùn* (玉机真藏论), 'wind' (风) should be annotated as 'disease' (病)."**

When there is heat yet the pulse is tranquil, or when there is diarrhea and bleeding yet the pulse is firm,
**Newly corrected annotation:** According to the *Yùjī Zhēnlùn* (玉机真藏论), this should read: *"When there is diarrhea, the pulse is large; when there is bleeding, the pulse is firm."*

When illness is in the interior, the pulse is weak; when illness is in the exterior,
**Newly corrected annotation:** According to the *Yùjī Zhēnlùn*, this should read: *"When illness is in the exterior, the pulse is firm and solid."*

When the pulse is rough and firm,
**Newly corrected annotation:** According to the *Yùjī Zhēnlùn*, this should read: *"When the pulse is not firm yet is rigid."*

All these cases are difficult to treat.
For wind-heat, the pulse should be agitated, yet it is tranquil instead;
for diarrhea and bleeding, the pulse should be weak, yet it is firm instead;
when pathogenic *qi* is in the interior, the pulse should be firm, yet it is weak instead;
when disease *qi* is in the exterior, the pulse should be weak and slippery, yet it is rigid and rough instead—
thus, all these cases are difficult to treat.
This is called **running counter to the four seasons**.
All these cases run counter to the seasonal *qi*, and thus they are as described.

**Newly corrected annotation:** The phrase *"This is called running counter to the four seasons"* (命曰反四时也) should be omitted as an ancient textual error. The preceding fifty-three characters from *"From earlier, there is no hidden form in spring and summer"* onward duplicate text found later in the *Yùjī Zhēnlùn*.

Humans take water and grain as their foundation, so if one is deprived of water and grain, one dies; if the pulse lacks *stomach qi*, one also dies.
What is meant by *"lacking stomach qi"* is that one obtains only the true hidden pulse, not the *stomach qi*.
What is meant by *"the pulse lacking stomach qi"* is that the liver pulse is not taut and the kidney pulse is not firm.
Not taut and not firm both mean they lack subtlety.

When the **Taiyang** pulse arrives, it is surging, large, and long—
for the *qi* is abundant, thus it is so.
**Newly corrected annotation:** According to the *Lúnquè Yīnyáng Màifǎ* (沦鹊阴阳脉法), it states: *"The Taiyang pulse is surging, large, and long, arriving floating above the tendons, shaking nine divisions. It rules on the third and fourth months, on days of *jiǎzǐ* (甲子)."* Lü Guang remarks: *"Taiyang rules the fifth and sixth months, when its *qi* is at its peak, hence its pulse is surging, large, and long."*

When the **Shaoyang** pulse arrives, it is alternately rapid and sparse, alternately short and long—
for its *qi* is sometimes unobstructed and sometimes obstructed.
**Newly corrected annotation:** According to the *Biānqiú Yīnyáng Màifǎ* (扁鹊阴阳脉法), it states: *"The Shaoyang pulse is alternately small and large, alternately long and short, shaking six divisions. It rules at midnight on the eleventh month, on days of *jiǎzǐ* (甲子), and rules the first and second months."* Lü Guang remarks: *"Shaoyang rules the first and second months, when its *qi* is still faint, hence its pulse arrives with irregular advance and retreat."*

When the **Yangming** pulse arrives, it is floating, large, and short—
for the *stomach qi* is full and abundant.
**Newly corrected annotation:** The three Yin pulses are omitted here, likely an ancient textual gap. According to the *Nánjīng* (难经), it states:
*"When the Taiyin pulse arrives, it is taut, large, and long;
when the Shaoyin pulse arrives, it is dense, fine, and subtle;
when the Jueyin pulse arrives, it is excessively short yet solid."*

Lü Guang remarks: *"Yangming rules the third and fourth months, when its *qi* has just sprouted but not yet flourished, hence its pulse arrives floating, large, and short."* The *Biānqiú Yīnyáng Màifǎ* states:
*"The Shaoyin pulse is taut and fine, shaking six divisions. It rules at noon on the fifth month, on days of *jiǎzǐ* (甲子), and rules the seventh and eighth months;
the Taiyin pulse is taut, fine, and long, arriving above the tendons, shaking nine divisions. It rules the ninth and tenth months, on days of *jiǎzǐ* (甲子);
the Jueyin pulse is deep, short, and taut, shaking three divisions. It rules the eleventh and twelfth months, on days of *jiǎzǐ* (甲子)."*

When the pulse arrives in a tranquil heart, it comes in succession like strung pearls, like tracing ivory teeth—this is called a tranquil heart.
It speaks of the pulse being full and abundant, subtly resembling pearls in the center of the hand.
*Lángyú* is a kind of pearl.
In summer, *stomach qi* is the foundation.
If the pulse has *stomach qi*, it comes in succession and subtly resembles strung pearls.

When the pulse arrives in a diseased heart, it comes in rapid, connected bursts, with a slight curve within—this is called a diseased heart.
*Curve* means it bends and lies flat in the center of the hand.
**Newly corrected annotation:** The *Yuèrén* (越人) text states: *"Rapid, connected bursts with a slight curve within—this is called kidney disease,"* differing from the *Suwèn* (素问).

When the pulse arrives in a dead heart, it curves forward and remains still behind, like holding a belt hook—this is called a dead heart.
*Resides* means it does not move.
*Operates* means to grasp and hold.

The hook refers to the hook of a leather belt.

When the pulse of a healthy lung arrives, it comes in a soft, murmuring manner (*yàn yàn nuò nuò*), like falling elm seeds—this is called a healthy lung pulse, being thin and hollow.

**Newly corrected annotation:** The *Yuèrén* text states: *"Soft murmuring like tracing a checkered seed—this is called the spring-level pulse."* The pulse is gentle and expansive like a carriage canopy, and when pressed, it grows larger—this is called the autumn-level pulse. This differs from the *Suwèn* (Chapter 7).

Zhang Zhòngjǐng states: *"The autumn pulse, hazy like a carriage canopy, is called *yángjié* (阳结); the spring pulse, murmuring like blowing elm seeds, is called *shuò* (数)."* Fear that the *Yuèrén* account may be in error.

In autumn, *stomach qi* is the foundation. When the pulse has *stomach qi*, it is light and hollow, resembling the delicate weight of a checkered seed.

When the pulse arrives in a diseased lung, it neither ascends nor descends, like tracing a parrot’s feather—this is called a diseased lung. It means firm in the center while hollow on both sides.

When the pulse arrives in a dead lung, it floats like an object on water, like wind blowing hair—this is called a dead lung. It floats lightly and trembles, like wind scattering hair in flurries.

**Newly corrected annotation:** The *Yuèrén* text states: *"When pressed, it vanishes like wind blowing hair—this is called death."*

When the pulse of a healthy liver arrives, it is weak yet resilient (*yì ruò zhāo zhāo*), like lifting the tip of a long pole—this is called a healthy liver. The tip of the pole signifies its length and depth.

In spring, *stomach qi* is the foundation. When the pulse has *stomach qi*, it is long and deep like the tip of a pole.

When the pulse arrives in a diseased liver, it is full, solid, and slippery, like tracing a long pole—this is called a diseased liver. Though long, it lacks depth, hence like tracing a pole.

When the pulse arrives in a dead liver, it grows more urgent and forceful, like a newly strung bow—this is called a dead liver. *Forceful* means intensely strong; *urgent* is its extreme form.

When the pulse of a healthy spleen arrives, it is harmonious and gentle, parting smoothly, like a parrot stepping on the ground—this is called a healthy spleen. It means the pulse arrives with measured, balanced rhythm, neither hurried nor sluggish.

In late summer, *stomach qi* is the foundation. When *stomach qi* is diminished, the pulse becomes solid and frequent.

When the pulse arrives in a diseased spleen, it is solid and full, like a parrot lifting its foot—this is called a diseased spleen. *Stomach qi* being diminished makes the pulse solid and urgent. *Lifting its foot* means like a hawk’s stride when it raises its foot.

**Newly corrected annotation:** The *Yuèrén* text mistakenly identifies this as heart disease.

When the pulse arrives in a dead spleen, it is sharp and firm, like a crow’s beak—**newly corrected annotation:** The *Qīanjīn Fāng* states: *"Like a hawk’s beak."* It is like a crow’s claw, like a leaky roof, like flowing water—this is called a dead spleen. *Crow’s beak and claw* signify sharpness and firmness. *Flowing water and leaky roof* describe its arrival. *Flowing water* means it arrives evenly without surging. *Leaky roof* means it moves intermittently then stops.

When the pulse of a healthy kidney arrives, it comes in a rapid, connected manner (*chuǎn chuǎn lěi lěi*) like a hook, firm when pressed—this is called a healthy kidney. It resembles the heart pulse but with a hooked shape, firm yet slight when pressed.

**Newly corrected annotation:** The *Yuèrén* text states: *"Its arrival is large above and shallow below, moist and slippery like a sparrow’s beak—this is called healthy."* Lǚ Guǎng states: *"Large above refers to the foot *Tàiyáng* (太阳); shallow below refers to the foot *Shàoyīn* (少阴). When yin and yang are balanced, *stomach qi* is strong, hence called healthy."* *Sparrow’s beak* signifies broad at the base and shallow at the tip.

In winter, *stomach qi* is the foundation. When *stomach qi* is diminished, it is firm even without pressing.

When the pulse arrives in a diseased kidney, it is like pulling hemp, growing firmer when pressed—this is called a diseased kidney. Its form resembles pulling hemp, meaning it is firm even without pressing, and pressing makes it even more so.

When the pulse arrives in a dead kidney, it surges like a snapped rope, sharp like striking a stone—this is called a dead kidney. *Surges like a snapped rope* is like a snake’s swift movement. *Sharp like striking a stone* means it is both rapid and firm.

**The *Yùjī Zhēncáng Lùn* Chapter**

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"In spring, the pulse is taut like a string—how does it become so?"*

Qībó replied: *"The spring pulse belongs to the liver, the wood of the East, the source from which all things first arise. Thus, when its qi arrives, it is supple yet weak, light and empty, yet smooth—straight and long, hence called 'string-like.' It is straight and long, resembling a string in form."*

**Newly corrected annotation:** According to Yùèrén, *"Spring pulse tautness"* refers to the wood of the East, where all things first begin to grow, their branches and leaves not yet formed. Thus, when its pulse arrives, it is moist, weak, yet long. The *Sìshí Jīng* describes it as 'light and broad.' Any deviation from this is disease. *Deviation* means contrary to the balanced norm.

The Emperor asked: *"How does it deviate?"*

Qībó said: *"When its qi arrives full and forceful, this is called *excess*—disease manifests externally. When its qi arrives empty and faint, this is called *deficiency*—disease lodges internally. Excess qi manifests disease outwardly; deficient qi harbors disease inwardly."*

**Newly corrected annotation:** According to Lǚ Guǎng, *"Full and forceful"* means the yang qi is excessive. The minor yang should be weak, but if it becomes full and forceful, it is called *excess*—since yang resides externally, disease appears outward. The *Juéyīn* qi nourishes the sinews; its pulse is taut, but if it becomes empty and faint, it is called *deficiency*—since yin resides internally, disease settles inward.

The Emperor asked: *"What are the diseases of spring pulse excess and deficiency?"*

Qībó replied: *"Excess causes forgetfulness—dizziness, disorientation, and vertigo with sudden head pain. Deficiency causes chest pain radiating to the back, and below, distension in both flanks and abdomen."*

**Annotations:**
- *Hūhū* means unclear perception.
- *Xuàn* means dizziness, as if vision spins.
- *Mào* means vertigo, as if struck by wind.
- *Pò* refers to the armpit, the flank.
- *"Forget"* should be *"anger"*—a scribal error. The *Língshū Jīng* states: *"When liver qi is excessive, anger arises."*

The liver’s *Juéyīn* pulse ascends from the foot, entering the hair follicles, then passes through the diaphragm, spreading across the flanks and ribs, following the throat’s posterior path, ascending to the occiput, emerging at the forehead to converge with the *Dū* pulse at the crown—hence the diseases manifest thus.

**Newly corrected annotation:** According to the *Qì Jiāo Biàn Dà Lùn*, *"Wood in excess, to the extreme, causes sudden anger, tautness, vertigo, and crown pain."* Thus, *"forget"* must be *"anger."*

The Emperor said: *"Understood."*

The summer pulse is like a hook—how so?

**Gēbó** replied: *"The summer pulse belongs to the heart, the south, the element of Fire—the force that makes all things flourish. Thus, its arrival is strong, its departure weak, hence the name 'hook,' for it curves like a hook in its rise and fall."*

**Newly corrected annotation:** According to the *Yuèrén* (Southern School), *"The summer pulse is hooked, for it belongs to the south, the element of Fire—the season when all things thrive, when branches spread and leaves unfurl, all curving downward like a hook. Thus, its pulse arrives swiftly and departs slowly."*

**Lǚ Guǎng** remarked: *"When yang is strong, the pulse arrives swiftly; when yin is deficient, it departs slowly. The pulse ascends from the wrist to the forearm quickly, then slows as it returns toward the elbow. If this pattern reverses, disease ensues."*

The Emperor asked: *"How does it reverse?"*

**Gēbó** replied: *"If its arrival is strong and its departure also strong, this is excess—disease lies externally. If its arrival is strong but its departure is even stronger, this is yang excess. When heart qi is in surplus, this is called excess."*

*"If its arrival is weak but its departure is strong, this is deficiency—disease lies internally."*

**Newly corrected annotation:** The *Yuèrén* further clarifies that for the liver, heart, lungs, and kidneys, a strong, firm pulse denotes excess, while a weak, faint pulse denotes deficiency—contrasting with the *Suìwén* (Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon).

The Emperor asked: *"What diseases arise from summer pulse excess or deficiency?"*

**Gēbó** replied: *"Excess causes the body to feel hot with painful skin—this is called 'infiltration.' Deficiency causes restlessness of the heart, with coughing and spitting above, and loose stools below."*

*"The heart’s *Shàoyīn* pulse arises in the heart, descends to the heart’s vessels, passes through the diaphragm to network the small intestine, then returns upward along the heart’s vessels to the lungs. Thus, when the heart is in excess, the body feels hot with painful skin, and this heat spreads through the body. When deficient, the heart is restless, with coughing and spitting above, and loose stools below."*

The Emperor said: *"Understood."*

The autumn pulse is like floating—how so?

**Gēbó** replied: *"The autumn pulse belongs to the lungs, the west, the element of Metal—the force that makes all things harvest. Thus, its arrival is light and empty, floating, urgent in coming and dispersing in going—hence 'floating.' It arrives urgently because yang has not yet descended fully; it departs dispersedly because yin qi rises."*

**Newly corrected annotation:** According to the *Yuèrén*, *"The autumn pulse is hair-like, for it belongs to the west, the element of Metal—the season when all things conclude. Grass and trees shed their leaves, leaving only bare branches, like fine hairs. Thus, its pulse arrives light and empty, floating—hence 'hair-like.'"*

*"If this pattern reverses, disease ensues."*

The Emperor asked: *"How does it reverse?"*

**Gēbó** said: *"When its qi arrives, if it is hair-like yet firm at the center while hollow at both sides, this is called **excess**—disease lies in the exterior. If its qi arrives hair-like yet faint, this is called **deficiency**—disease lies in the interior."*

The Emperor asked: *"When the autumn pulse is in excess or deficiency, what are the diseases?"*

**Gēbó** replied: *"Excess causes one to have **inverse qi** and back pain, with a restless, discontented demeanor. Deficiency causes one to wheeze, with shallow breathing and coughing, **upward-rising qi** manifesting as blood, and **disease sounds** heard from below.*

*The **Lung’s Taiyin pulse** arises from the middle burner, descends to network with the large intestine, ascends along the stomach’s orifice, passes through the diaphragm to belong to the lungs, and from the lung’s root emerges beneath the armpit. When **qi is stored improperly**, it causes coughing; it governs wheezing and breathlessness. Thus, when qi is excessive, the shoulders and back ache from **inverse qi**; when deficient, wheezing becomes erratic, breathing is shallow, and coughing brings **upward-rising qi** manifesting as blood. **Disease sounds** from below refer to wheezing producing sounds within the lungs."*

The Emperor said: *"Excellent."*

*"The winter pulse is like **stone**—how so? The pulse is deep and sunken, as though **camped** in motion."*

**Newly corrected annotation:** *"‘Deep’ was originally written as **‘móu’ (濡)**, also seen as **‘bó’ (搏)**. According to the text below, it states: *‘Its qi arrives deep and striking (搏).’* Thus, the character **‘shēn’ (深)** should be **‘bó’ (搏)**. Again, referring to the *Jiā-Yǐ Jīng*, **‘bó’ (搏)** should be **‘móu’ (濡)**—this is correct. Why? A pulse that is deep and **móu (soft)** is the balanced winter pulse. If it is deep and **striking (搏)** against the hand, then it is the winter pulse of **excess**. Thus, the text should follow the *Jiā-Yǐ Jīng* and use **‘móu’ (濡)**."*

**Gēbó** said: *"The winter pulse belongs to the **kidneys**, the north, the element of **Water**—the season when all things **converge and store**. Thus, its qi arrives deep and striking, hence **‘stone’**—meaning it strikes the hand as though deep and firm. The newly corrected annotation states: According to the *Jiā-Yǐ Jīng*, **‘striking (搏)’** should be **‘móu (濡)’**, as previously explained. The *Yuèrén* also says: The winter pulse is like **stone**, for it is the **Water** of the north—the season when all things are stored. In deep winter, water congeals like stone, so its pulse arrives deep, soft, and slippery, hence **‘stone’**. If this pattern reverses, disease ensues."*

The Emperor asked: *"How does it reverse?"*

Gēbó replied: *"When its **qi** arrives like striking a pebble, this is called **excess**—disease lies on the **surface**; when its departure is abrupt like a count, this is called **deficiency**—disease lies within.

The Emperor asked: ‘In winter pulses of **excess** and **deficiency**, what are their respective diseases?’

Gēbó replied: ‘**Excess** causes **dissolution and dispersion***—the newly corrected annotation states: *According to the meaning of **dissolution and dispersion**, see the notes in the Fifth Alley.*—with **back pain** and **shortness of breath**, unwilling to speak. **Deficiency** causes the heart to hang suspended as though starving—**the lower back is hollow**, the **lumbar spine aches**, the **lower abdomen is distended**, and the **urine changes**. The **kidney’s Minor-Yin pulse**, ascending from the inner thigh, traverses the **posterior knee crease**, pierces the **spine**, and connects with the **kidney meridian** and **bladder network**; its direct path ascends from the kidney, piercing the **liver’s upper cavity**, entering the **lung**, following the throat, and running beside the **root of the tongue**. Its branching diverges from the lung, networks the **heart**, and descends into the **chest**. Thus, the diseases manifest as such.

**The hollow region**—this is the area beneath the **seasonal ribs**, beside the **two flanks**, where the **lumbar space is soft and sunken**. The kidney lies externally to this hollow, so **hollow coldness** arises there, and **tingling** occurs.

The Emperor said: ‘Excellent.’"

The Emperor said: ‘The sequence of the four seasons marks the variations of yin and yang. The pulse is taut in spring, slack in summer, floating in autumn, and deep in winter—these are the visible signs of their inverse and harmonious changes. But how does the **spleen pulse** specifically govern these seasons?’

**Governing** refers to the **spleen’s** dominion over the months.

**Qi Bo** replied: ‘The **spleen pulse** is of the **Earth element**, a **lonely organ** that irrigates the four sides. It absorbs **water and grain**, transforms **vital fluids**, and nourishes the **liver, heart, lung, and kidney**. Since it does not properly govern the four seasons, it is called the **lonely organ**.’

**Irrigates**—an ancient reading.

The Emperor said: ‘Then can the **spleen’s** virtues and vices be observed?’

**Qi Bo** replied: ‘Its virtues cannot be observed, but its vices can. When it fails to govern its proper season, it usurps the **Five Phases** of the four seasons, so its virtues cannot be seen, but its vices can.’

The Emperor said: ‘How can its vices be seen?’

**Qi Bo** replied: ‘When its arrival is like water flowing, this is called **excess**—the disease lies externally. When its arrival is like a raven’s beak, this is called **deficiency**—the disease lies internally.’

*(Newly corrected reading: According to the *Treatise on the Physiology of the Healthy*, it says: "like a raven’s beak." Another variant text reads: "like a raven’s peck.")*

The Emperor said: ‘Master, you say the **spleen** is the **lonely organ**, that the **central Earth** irrigates the four sides. If there is **excess** or **deficiency**, how do the diseases manifest?’

**Qi Bo** replied: ‘**Excess** causes the four limbs to fail to rise; since the **spleen governs the limbs**, the disease manifests as their inability to lift. **Deficiency** causes the nine orifices to fail to function, and this is called **double rigidity**. The **spleen’s** role as the **lonely organ** is to irrigate the four sides, but when it is diseased, the **Five Organs** fail to harmonize, hence the nine orifices fail to function.’

*(The *Eighty-One Difficult Classic* says: When the **Five Organs** fail to harmonize, the nine orifices fail to function.) **Double** refers to **organ-qi** being **superimposed**; **rigidity** refers to **qi** failing to flow smoothly.

The Emperor rose in haste, bowed twice, and knelt to kowtow, saying: ‘Excellent. I have grasped the **great essentials of the pulse**—the supreme principles of the world. The *Treatise on the Five Colors*, *Treatise on Pulse Variations*, *Treatise on Measuring and Inferring*, and *Treatise on Strange and Constant [Phenomena]* all converge in the **Dao/Way**.’

*(Haste—literally "startled and rise." The phrase suggests urgency. It means that through **excess** and **deficiency**, the **Dao/Way** flows uniformly, and all measuring and inferring of strange and constant [pulse phenomena] can be understood.)*

**When the spirit-qi does not turn but instead circles back**, or **when it turns but does not circle**, this is a loss of its **mechanism**. The **Five Phases-qi** cycles in harmony, never violating the seasonal order—this is called **spirit-qi flowing without turning back**. If it **retrogrades** and **usurps** the **decline of the season**, reversing the **natural order of Heaven’s qi**, then it **turns back but does not flow**, and thus the **mechanism of life-qi** is lost.

The **essence of the supreme principles** is urgent and subtle—when one grasps the **Dao/Way** of the supreme principles, its application must be precise and subtle.

*(Urgent—literally "pressing.")* Engraved upon **jade tablets** and stored in the **treasury of the classics**, it should be read every morning—this is called the **Jade Mechanism**.

*(Engraved upon **jade tablets**, hence its name—referring to the **jade tablets** as the **Jade Mechanism**, the **mechanism of life-qi**.)*

The **Five Organs** receive **qi** from their **mother phases**, and transmit it to their **conquered phases**. **Qi** resides in its **mother phase** but perishes in its **unconquered phase**. When a disease is near death, it must first spread, reaching the **unconquered phase** before the disease dies.

*(Receiving **qi** from its **mother phase**—meaning receiving the **pathogenic qi** from the phase that generates it. Transmitting to its **conquered phase**—meaning spreading to the phase that it overcomes. **Qi** resides in its **mother phase**—meaning it lodges in the phase that generates it. Perishing in its **unconquered phase**—meaning it dies in the phase that overcomes it. If transmission is not in order, death follows.) This refers to **qi** flowing in reverse—hence death.

The following explains what is meant by **reverse**:

- The **liver** receives **qi** from the **heart**, transmits it to the **spleen**, **qi** resides in the **kidney**, and reaches the **lung** where it dies.
- The **heart** receives **qi** from the **spleen**, transmits it to the **lung**, **qi** resides in the **liver**, and reaches the **kidney** where it dies.
- The **spleen** receives **qi** from the **lung**, transmits it to the **kidney**, **qi** resides in the **heart**, and reaches the **liver** where it dies.
- The **lung** receives **qi** from the **kidney**, transmits it to the **liver**, **qi** resides in the **spleen**, and reaches the **heart** where it dies.
- The **kidney** receives **qi** from the **liver**, transmits it to the **heart**, **qi** resides in the **lung**, and reaches the **spleen** where it dies.

All these are cases of **reverse death**.

*(Dividing the day into five parts and the night into five parts—this is the method for determining the early or late timing of death.) The **liver** dies under the **lung’s** influence, occurring in **autumn** on the **Geng-Sin days**—the remaining four follow this pattern accordingly.*

*(Newly corrected reading: According to the *Classic of Jia-Yi*, the generating phase is marked with the symbol #2. It refers to determining the early or late timing of death.)*

*(This text focuses solely on the **reverse flow of qi**, leading to death—it does not discuss the early or late timing of life. The **Wang** variant changes "death" to "life," but the meaning is better preserved in the original *Classic of Jia-Yi* and *Plain Questions* text.)*

The **Yellow Emperor** said: ‘The **Five Organs** communicate with each other, and their transmission follows a sequence. When the **Five Organs** are diseased, they each pass their **pathogenic qi** to their **conquered phases**.’

*(This follows the previous text on **reverse transmission** leading to death, hence it refers to the sequence of **conquered phases** in **harmonious transmission**.)*

*(Newly corrected reading: The sequence of **conquered phases** in **harmonious transmission**—the term **reverse** should be **harmonious**, as the above text speaks of **reverse transmission**, while the following describes the sequence of **harmonious transmission**.)*

If not treated, the disease follows the **law of three months or six months**, or **three days or six days**, and transmits through the **Five Organs** before death—this is the sequence of **harmonious transmission** to the **conquered phases**. **Three months** refers to the **migration of organ-qi**. **Six months** refers to reaching the position of its **conquered phase**. **Three days** refers to the **three yang days** combined for calculation. **Six days** refers to including the **three yin days** in the count.

*(The *Treatise on Heat* says: In **injury by cold**, **pathogenic heat** invades **Juyang** on the first day, **Yangming** on the second, **Shaoyang** on the third, **Taiyin** on the fourth, **Shaoyin** on the fifth, and **Jueyin** on the sixth.)*

Then its meaning is as follows:

*(Newly corrected annotation states: Upon close examination, the seven characters "顺传所胜之次" belong to the preceding annotation, mistakenly placed below this passage in the text. Not only does this lack coherence, but the complete original editions of *Suwen* by Yuan Qi and the *Jia Yi Jing* also do not include these seven characters. They should be removed, lest those who fail to grasp the context raise doubts. Now retained in the annotation.)*

Thus it is said: **"Distinguishing between the yang** [of the Six *Qi*], one knows the **origin of the disease**; **distinguishing between the yin**, one knows the **term of life and death**." By mastering the **signs of the Three Yin and Three Yang**, one discerns the **phases that pathogenic wind-qi cannot overcome**.

Hence follows the next passage:
*(Newly corrected annotation states: Upon close examination, the old annotation here was written as "experience," now revised to "annotation.")*

It is also stated in *The Treatise on Yin-Yang Differentiation*: **"Distinguishing between the yang**, one knows the **location of the disease**; **distinguishing between the yin**, one knows the **term of life and death**." Elsewhere it says: **"Distinguishing between the yang**, one knows the **prohibited times for the disease**; **distinguishing between the yin**, one knows the **term of life and death**." The meaning aligns with this.

It speaks of knowing when death occurs due to **reaching the phase of constraint**. Constraint refers to **arriving at the phase it cannot overcome**. As the earlier passage states, *"death occurs at its unconquered phase."* Hence, **wind** is the **primary of a hundred diseases**. It means wind precedes all other diseases.

*(Newly corrected annotation states: Referring to *The Treatise on the Movement of Vital Qi Through the Heavens*, it says: "Wind is the **origin of a hundred diseases**.")*

When **wind and cold** lodge in a person, it causes **erect hairs and closed pores**, generating **heat**. Lodge refers to **pathogenic factors stopping at the body’s surface**. Wind strikes the **skin and hair**, while cold overcomes the **principle of openness**, hence the **erect hairs** and **closed pores**, leading to **heat generation**. At this time, **sweating and eruption** can occur; the **pathogen resides in the skin and hair**, so **sweating and dispersion** can eliminate it. *The Grand Treatise on Yin-Yang Correspondence and Manifestations* states: **"A skilled practitioner treats the skin and hair."** This is what is meant.

Or, it may manifest as **numbness, loss of sensation, swelling, and pain**—the disease arises and transforms, hence such symptoms. When **heat invades the blood and vital *qi***, it results in **numbness and loss of sensation**; when **cold injures the form**, it causes **swelling and pain**. *The Grand Treatise on Yin-Yang Correspondence and Manifestations* says: **"Cold injures the form; heat injures the *qi*; *qi* injury causes pain; form injury causes swelling."** At this time, **hot compresses, moxibustion, or acupuncture** can be applied to dispel it. All these methods aim to **dispel pathogenic cold** and **promote the circulation of true *qi***.

If untreated, the **pathogen enters and lodges in the lungs**, named **lung *bi*** (痹), causing **coughing and shortness of breath**. The **pathogen enters the yin phases**, thus manifesting as *bi*—when it lodges in the **lungs**, it is called **lung *bi***. *The Treatise on the Illumination of the Five *Qi*** states: **"When the pathogen enters the yang, it causes madness; when it enters the yin, it causes *bi***.** The **lungs**, associated with **change and movement**, generate **coughing**, so **shortness of breath** arises. If untreated, the **lungs transmit the pathogen to the liver**, and the disease is named **liver *bi*** (肝痹), also called **liver *jue*** (厥), with **rib pain and aversion to food**. The **lungs’ metal *qi*** overcomes the **liver’s wood**, sending **vital *qi*** downward into the **liver**, hence the phrase *"if untreated, the pathogen moves to the liver."* The **liver’s *qi*** connects with the **gallbladder**, which tends toward **anger**—anger is **rebellious *qi***, hence the alternate name **liver *jue***. The **liver’s *jueyin* meridian** ascends from the **lower abdomen**, linking with the **liver’s collaterals** and the **gallbladder**, piercing the **diaphragm**, spreading across the **ribs**, following the **posterior pharynx**, and entering the **occipital skull**. Hence, **rib pain**. When **food enters the stomach**, it is expelled, hence the term **"aversion to food."** At this time, **pressure or ear acupuncture** can be applied.

If untreated, the **liver transmits the pathogen to the spleen**, and the disease is named **spleen wind** (脾风), causing **dampness**, **abdominal heat**, **mental agitation**, and **yellow discharge**. The **liver’s wood *qi*** corresponds to **wind**, and **wood overcomes earth**, so the **spleen’s earth** succumbs to **wind *qi***, hence **spleen wind**. It is named as such because **wind *qi*** permeates the **liver** and then the **spleen**. The **spleen’s tendency** is to produce **dampness and jaundice**, hence the **dampness**. The **spleen’s *Taiyin* meridian** enters the **abdomen**, linking with the **spleen’s collaterals** and the **stomach**, ascending the **diaphragm** and **lateral pharynx**, connecting with the **root of the tongue**, and dispersing beneath it. Its **branches** further ascend from the **stomach**, piercing the **diaphragm**, and pouring into the **heart**, hence **abdominal heat and mental agitation**, and **yellow discharge in the stool**. At this time, **pressure, medication, or bathing** can be applied.

If untreated, the **spleen transmits the pathogen to the kidneys**, and the disease is named **hernia** (疝痕), with **lower abdominal oppression, heat, and pain**, and **white discharge**; it is also called **worms** (蛊). The **kidneys’ *Shaoyin* meridian** and its **collaterals** ascend from the **inner thigh**, piercing the **lower back**, traversing the **spine**, and linking with the **bladder**. Hence, **lower abdominal oppression, heat, and pain**, and **white fluid discharge**. When **oppressive heat** condenses internally, it **consumes fat and flesh**, resembling **worms eating**, termed **"internal depletion and erosion"**—hence the alternate name **worms**. At this time, **pressure or medication** can be applied.

If untreated, the **kidneys transmit the pathogen to the heart**, causing **tendons and vessels to contract and spasm**, named **zhi** (痣). When the **kidneys are deficient**, **water fails to generate**, and **tendons become dry and tense**, hence the **contraction and spasms**. The **yin *qi*** weakens internally, while the **yang *qi*** solidifies externally; **tendons and vessels**, injured by **heat**, **twitch and jerk** spontaneously, hence the name **zhi**. At this time, **moxibustion or medication** can be applied.

If untreated, **ten days elapse**, and death is imminent. When the **pathogen reaches the heart** and **vital *qi* is exhausted**, this is the outcome. If transmission continues, it follows as below:

The **kidneys transmit the pathogen to the heart**; if the **heart fails to receive the disease**, it **retrogressively transmits to the lungs**, causing **alternating chills and fever**, and death occurs within **three years**. Since the **kidneys transmit to the heart**, and the **heart does not contract the disease**, it **retrotransmits to the lungs’ metal phase**—the **lungs having been injured twice**, hence the **alternating chills and fever**. **Three years** refers to: **one year** from **lungs to kidneys**, **one year** from **kidneys to liver**, and **one year** from **liver to heart**; **fire then overcomes the lungs**, hence the saying *"death occurs within three years."* This is the **sequence of transmission to the unconquered phases**.

However, in cases where the disease **ultimately erupts**, it is not necessarily **treated according to the transmission** [of pathogen], nor does it **follow the sequence of transmission** as described. Hence, one should not **cross-treat** [chā yǐ chuan zhì] it as if it were transmitted.

Sometimes, the **transmission and transformation** [of pathogen] may **not proceed in strict order**, or **may not enter** [the organs] in sequence. This occurs when **grief, fear, sorrow, joy, or anger** disrupt the natural order, causing the **pathogen to invade** [without following the sequence], which is why such cases often result in **grave illness**.

**Grief, fear, sorrow, joy, or anger** may **trigger irregular symptoms** [wú cháng fèn], and when the **patient is exposed to external factors**, the disease **manifests unpredictably**, leading to **pathogenic qi** also **arising disorderly**. Thus:

- **Excessive joy** [dà xū] weakens the **heart’s spirit** [xīn qì], allowing the **kidneys’ qi** to **overrun** [chéng]. **Joy** shifts the **heart’s qi** to the **lungs**; if the **heart’s qi** does not **hold its ground**, the **kidneys’ qi** **overruns** [the heart].
  *The* **宣明五气篇** [*Xuān Míng Wǔ Qì Piān*] *states:* **"When vital essence and spirit converge in the heart, joy arises."**

- **Anger** allows the **liver’s qi** to **overrun** [chéng]. **Anger** causes **rebellious qi** [nì], so the **liver’s qi** **overruns the spleen**.
  *The* **宣明五气篇** [*Xuān Míng Wǔ Qì Piān*] *states:* **"When vital essence and spirit converge in the liver, anger arises."**

- **Sorrow** allows the **lungs’ qi** to **overrun** [chéng]. **Sorrow** shifts the **lungs’ qi** to the **liver**; if the **liver’s qi** **receives pathogenic influence**, the **lungs’ qi** **overruns** [the liver].
  *The* **宣明五气篇** [*Xuān Míng Wǔ Qì Piān*] *states:* **"When vital essence and spirit converge in the lungs, sorrow arises."**

- **Fear** allows the **spleen’s qi** to **overrun** [chéng]. **Fear** shifts the **kidneys’ qi** to the **heart**; if the **kidneys’ qi** does not **hold its ground**, the **spleen’s qi** **overruns** [the heart].
  *The* **宣明五气篇** [*Xuān Míng Wǔ Qì Piān*] *states:* **"When vital essence and spirit converge in the kidneys, fear arises."**

- **Grief** allows the **heart’s qi** to **overrun** [chéng]. **Grief** shifts the **liver’s qi** to the **spleen**; if the **liver’s qi** does not **hold its ground**, the **heart’s qi** **overruns** [the liver].
  *The* **宣明五气篇** [*Xuān Míng Wǔ Qì Piān*] *states:* **"When vital essence and spirit converge in the liver, grief arises."**

This is the **Dao/Way** [of such disorders]. This is the **constant irregular transmission** [of pathogenic influence].

「Thus, there are five disorders, and twenty-five variations arise from their fivefold interactions. This is the **constant irregular transmission** [of pathogenic influence] in reverse.

When the five **viscera** [zàng] converge and each **overruns** [chéng] the other, then the twenty-five variations occur. Yet their transformations follow the principle of **victory**—when one **overruns** [chéng] another, the transmission does not proceed in sequence, but manifests in myriad ways.

○ The newly corrected text states: According to the *Yīn Yáng Bié Lùn* [*Obscure Discussions on Yin and Yang*], there are five **Yin-Yang excesses** [jī yáng], and twenty-five **Yin-Yang excesses** [jī yáng] in total. This meaning aligns with the above. **"Transmission"** is another name for **"overrunning"** [chéng]. What is meant by **"transmission"**? It is merely another term for **mutual overrunning**.

When the **great bones** [dà gǔ] wither and the **great flesh** [dà ròu] collapses inward, the chest is filled with **qi**, breathing is labored, and the **qi** disturbs the **form** [xíng]. Within six months, death will occur—when the **true visceral pulse** [zhēn zàng mài] appears, the day of death is confirmed. The **dry, clinging skin** [pí fū gān zhuó] and **sunken flesh between bones** [gǔ wèn ròu xiàn] refer to the **great bones withering** and the **great flesh collapsing inward**. All afflictions near the **bones** or in **empty spaces** [kòng zhòng] are of a similar nature. When the chest is filled with **qi** and breathing is labored, this indicates **lung’s loss of governance** [fèi wú zhǔ]. The **lung** governs **regulation and moderation** [zhì jié], and breath follows its command; when the **qi** disturbs the **form**, it signifies the **lung’s qi** failing to sustain the **form**, causing the shoulders and back to rise in an attempt to seek **replenishing qi** [bào qì].

If such is the case, both the **form** [xíng] and the **viscera** [zàng] are already damaged, and the **spirit** [shén] is also impaired. If these symptoms are observed, death will occur within one hundred and eighty days. When the **true visceral pulse** [zhēn zàng mài] of the **lung** appears, the day of death is confirmed.

The **true visceral pulse** [zhēn zàng mài] of the **lung**: When the **great bones** wither and the **great flesh** collapses inward, the chest is filled with **qi**, breathing is labored, and **internal pain draws the shoulders and neck** [nèi tòng yǐn jiān xiàng]. Within one month, death will occur—when the **true visceral pulse** [zhēn zàng mài] appears, the day of death is confirmed.

When **fire essence** [huǒ jīng] escapes outward and **yang qi** surges upward, **metal** [jīn] is consumed by **fire** [huǒ], causing **internal pain in the shoulders and neck** [nèi tòng jiān xiàng]. If such symptoms appear, death will occur within thirty days. This is the **true visceral pulse** [zhēn zàng mài] of the **heart**.

When the **great bones** wither and the **great flesh** collapses inward, the chest is filled with **qi**, breathing is labored, **internal pain draws the shoulders and neck** [nèi tòng yǐn jiān xiàng], the body is feverish, and the **flesh is wasted as if stripped** [ròu tuō], with **tissue breakdown** [pò yīn] and **detached flesh** [tuō ròu]. The eyes sink inward, the **true visceral pulse** [zhēn zàng mài] appears, and if the eyes cannot see, death is imminent. Those who can still see will die when their **qi** reaches its **unconquerable limit** [bù shèng zhī shí]. Within ten months, death will occur. When **yin qi** is weak and **yang qi** surges inward, the body becomes feverish. **Tissue breakdown** [yīn] is the **flesh’s marker** [biāo], and since the **spleen** governs **flesh**, if the flesh is stripped bare and the tissue is in disarray, it signifies the **spleen’s collapse**. If these symptoms are observed, death will occur within three hundred days. **Tissue breakdown** [yīn] refers to the **block-like flesh** [ruò] behind the elbows and knees. This is the **true visceral pulse** [zhēn zàng mài] of the **spleen**.

When the **great bones** wither and the **great flesh** collapses inward, the **marrow within the shoulders** [jiān suǐ] is consumed, and **movement weakens progressively** [dòng zuò yì shuāi]. Within one year, death will occur—when the **true visceral pulse** [zhēn zàng mài] appears, the day of death is confirmed. The **marrow within the shoulders** [jiān suǐ] being consumed refers to the **deepened supraclavicular fossa** [quē pén shēn]. Weakness in **movement**, meaning **sexual activity diminishes gradually** [jiāo jiē jiàn wēi], occurs because the remaining **viscera** are still intact, so death will occur within three hundred and sixty-five days. This is the **true visceral pulse** [zhēn zàng mài] of the **kidneys**.

○ The newly corrected text states: According to Quán Yuánqǐ’s original text and the *Jiǎ Yǐ Jīng* [*Canon of the A-B Branches*], **"true visceral pulse"** [zhēn zàng mài] should be **"true visceral pulse not yet appearing"** [wèi zhēn zàng mài], as the **"come"** [lái] was mistakenly written.

When the **great bones** wither and the **great flesh** collapses inward, the chest is filled with **qi**, **abdominal pain** [fù nèi tòng] and **discomfort in the heart** [xīn zhōng bù biàn] occur, the neck and shoulders are feverish, **tissue breakdown** [pò yīn] and **detached flesh** [tuō ròu] appear, the eyes sink inward, and the **true visceral pulse** [zhēn zàng mài] manifests. If the eyes cannot see, death is immediate. Those who can still see will die when their **qi** reaches its **unconquerable limit** [bù shèng zhī shí]. **Wood** [mù] generates **fire** [huǒ], and the **liver’s qi** communicates with the **heart**, the pulse reaches the **lower abdomen** [shào fù], spreads across the **ribs** [xié lèi], follows the **throat** [yīn lǎng] and its **posterior** [hòu], and ascends to the **occiput** [zhuān lěi]. Thus, **abdominal pain** and **discomfort in the heart** arise, along with fever in the neck, shoulders, and body, and **tissue breakdown** with **detached flesh**. The **liver** governs the **eyes**, so when the eyes sink inward and vision fails, death is immediate. The **unconquerable limit** refers to the **seventh and eighth lunar months** [gēng xīn zhī yuè]. This is the **true visceral pulse** [zhēn zàng mài] of the **liver**.

Sudden **extreme depletion** [jí xū] occurs within the body, causing the **five viscera** [wǔ zàng] to **close off absolutely** [jué bì], the **pulse pathways** [mài dào] to be blocked, and **qi** to fail in circulation. This is like **falling into water** [duò nì], and no prognosis can be given.

It is said that when the **five viscera** [wǔ zàng] **overrun** [chéng] each other and transmit their **unconquerable limits** [bù shèng], one may await the appearance of the **true visceral pulse** [zhēn zàng mài] to confirm the day of death. In cases of **sudden extreme depletion** [jí xū] where **depletion** [xū] and **pathogenic influence** [xíe] overwhelm the body internally, the **five viscera** [wǔ zàng] **close off absolutely**, the **pulse pathways** [mài dào] are blocked, and **qi** fails to circulate. This is like **falling into water or drowning** [duò zhuì mò nì], and no prognosis for the day of death can be given.

If the **pulse ceases entirely** [mài jué bù lái], yet one breathes five or six times, though the **true visceral pulse** [zhēn zàng mài] does not appear and the **flesh does not detach** [ròu bù tuō], death is still imminent. This is the **pulse of sudden extreme depletion** [jí xū].

○ The newly corrected text states: How can one breathe five or six times and still not die? The **"breath"** [xī] is a miswritten **"call"** [hū], and the correct reading is **"call"** [hū]. When the **true liver pulse** [zhēn gān mài] arrives, both **internal** and **external** are **depleted** [jí], like **traversing a blade’s edge** [yún dāo rèn zé zé], or like **pressing a lute or zither string** [àn qín sè xián]. The skin takes on a **greenish-white hue without luster** [qīng bái bù zé], and the **hair withers** [máo zhé], then death occurs.

When the **true heart pulse** [zhēn xīn mài] arrives, it is **firm and beating** [jiān ér bó], like **traversing a layer of rough silk** [yún cāng jiǎn zǐ lěi lěi], and the skin turns **reddish-black without luster** [chì hēi bù zé], while the **hair withers** [máo zhé], then death occurs.

When the **true lung pulse** [zhēn fèi mài] arrives, it is **large yet hollow** [dà ér xū], like **brushing the skin with feathers** [yǐ máo yǔ zhòng rén fū]. The skin takes on a **whitish-red hue without luster** [bái chì bù zé], and the **hair withers** [máo zhé], then death occurs.

When the **true kidney pulse** [zhēn shèn mài] arrives, it is **beating yet ceasing** [bó ér jué], like **plucking a stone with one’s fingers** [zhǐ tán shí pì pì]. The skin turns **blackish-yellow without luster** [hēi huáng bù zé], and the **hair withers** [máo zhé], then death occurs.

When the **true spleen pulse** [zhēn pí mài] arrives, it is **weak and intermittently rapid or slow** [ruò ér zà shù zà shū]. The skin takes on a **yellowish-green hue without luster** [huáng qīng bù zé], and the **hair withers** [máo zhé], then death occurs.

All cases where the **true visceral pulse** [zhēn zàng mài] appears are **untreatable and fatal** [jié sǐ bù zhì].

○ The newly corrected text states: According to Yáng Shàngshàn, it is called **"true"** [zhēn] because there is **no remaining substance or mixed influence** [wú yú wù hé zá]. The **qi** of the **five viscera** [wǔ zàng] must all be **harmonized by the stomach’s qi** [wèi qì]; they cannot act alone. Just as **excessive rigidity cannot be used alone** [zhì gāng bù dé dú yòng], if used alone, it **fractures** [shé], but if **harmonized with flexibility** [hé róu yòng zhī], it **becomes steadfast** [jí dé gù]. When the **qi** of the **five viscera** is **harmonized by the stomach’s qi** [wèi qì], one attains **longevity** [cháng shēng]. If the **true pulse** appears alone, death is certain. To discern that the **true visceral pulse** [zhēn zàng mài] signifies death while **harmonization by the stomach’s qi** [wèi qì] signifies life, examine the **radial pulse at the wrist** [cùn kǒu]. If it feels taut like a **string**, it is the **liver pulse** [gān mài].」

「A faint pulse with tension signifies **#9 equilibrium**. This **微弦** [wēi xián] refers to when **two parts of the stomach’s *qi*** [èr fèn wèi qì] and **one part of the taut *qi*** [yī fèn xián qì] move together, forming **微弦** [wēi xián].

When **three parts converge as taut** [sān fèn bìng shì xián ér wú wèi qì] without the stomach’s *qi*, it is the **true visceral pulse** [zhēn zàng mài] manifesting. The remaining **four viscera** [yú sì zàng] follow this principle likewise.

The Yellow Emperor asked: If the **true visceral pulse** appears, why does death occur that day?

Qī Bó replied: The **five viscera** [wǔ zàng] all draw their *qi* from the stomach, for the stomach is the **root** [běn] of the five viscera. The stomach serves as the **sea of water and grain** [shuǐ gǔ zhī hǎi], hence the five viscera rely upon it.

The *qi* of the viscera cannot **spontaneously reach** [bù dé zì zhì] the **hand’s Greater Yin meridian** [shǒu tài yīn], but must **depend upon the stomach’s *qi*** [yīn wèi qì], thus arriving at the **hand’s Greater Yin meridian**. In a **balanced individual** [píng rén], the **ordinary *qi* of the viscera** [cháng yīn wèi qì] is drawn from the stomach, and the stomach’s *qi* is the **ordinary *qi* of balanced individuals** [píng rén zhī cháng qì]. Therefore, the visceral *qi* depends upon the stomach’s *qi* to reach the **hand’s Greater Yin meridian**.

○[Newly corrected version states:] The detailed description of **balanced individuals’ ordinary *qi*** [píng rén zhī cháng yīn wèi qì] and **ordinary *qi* of balanced individuals** [píng rén zhī cháng qì] originates from the text of *Treatise on the Gastric Pulse of Balanced Individuals* [《Píng Rén Qì Xiàng Lùn》], where the Wang lineage annotated this passage. According to *The Canon of A and B* [《Jiǎ Yǐ Jīng》], it states: **"People ordinarily draw *qi* from the stomach**, and the pulse is rooted in the stomach’s *qi***. This differs slightly from the above. Yet the text of *The Canon of A and B* is what is obtained."」

Thus, the five viscera each manifest their own **seasonal *qi*** [shí qì]—**self-generated and reaching the hand’s Greater Yin meridian**. They also **manifest their own characteristics** [zì wéi qí zhuàng] **to the hand’s Greater Yin meridian**.

Therefore, when **pathogenic *qi*** [xié qì] prevails, the **vital *qi*** [jīng qì] weakens, and when illness is severe, the stomach’s *qi* cannot **convey its vitality together with the visceral *qi* to the hand’s Greater Yin meridian**. Hence, the **true visceral *qi*** [zhēn zàng qì] appears alone, and when it appears alone, the illness has **overwhelmed the viscera** [shèng zàng]. This is what is called **pulse without stomach’s *qi*** [mài wú wèi qì], and thus **death**.

*The Treatise on the Gastric Pulse of Balanced Individuals* [《Píng Rén Qì Xiàng Lùn》] states: **"When a person lacks the stomach’s *qi*, it is called *inverse* [nì], and *inverse* means death."**

The Yellow Emperor said: **"Good."**

○[Newly corrected version states:] The detailed account of **the Yellow Emperor’s inquiry to this point** [zì huángdì wèn zhì yī jié] **is entirely derived from the original text in Volume Four, *Tàiyīn Yángmíng Biǎo Guǒ Piān* [《太阴阳明表裹篇》], which the Wang lineage relocated here. This is done to **exalt the Wang lineage’s contributions to the *Plain Questions*** [yù míng wáng shì zhī gōng yú *Sūwèn* duō yǐ]. The Yellow Emperor said:

**"In treating any illness, observe the patient’s **form** [xíng], **spirit-*qi*** [shén qì], **color and luster** [sè zé], and the **pulse’s strength and decline** [mài zhī shèng xuē]. Determine whether the illness is **new or old** [xīn guǒ], and then act accordingly—**never delay**. When the **vitality aligns with the pulse’s timing** [yù líng xiān shí ér qǔ zhī], it is favorable.

When **form and spirit-*qi* are harmonious** [xíng qì xiāng dé], it is called **treatable**. When **spirit-*qi* is strong and form is strong** [qì shèng xíng shèng], or **spirit-*qi* is weak and form is weak** [qì xū xíng xū], these are instances of **harmony**.

When **color and luster are bright and floating** [sè zé yǐ fú], it is called **easily resolved**. When **spirit-*qi* and color are floating and moist** [qì sè fú rùn], the **blood and *qi* mutually nourish** [xuè qì xiāng yíng], hence it is **easily resolved**.

When the **pulse follows the four seasons** [mài cóng sì shí], it is called **treatable**. The **spring pulse is like a bowstring** [chún], the **summer pulse is like a drum** [xuǎn], the **autumn pulse is like a hook** [gǒu], the **winter pulse is like a bell** [yíng], and the **spring pulse is floating** [fú], the **winter pulse is firm** [dòng yíng]. This is called **conforming to the four seasons**. *From* [cóng] means **to follow** [shùn].

When the **pulse is weak yet smooth** [mài ruò yǐ huá], it signifies **the presence of stomach’s *qi*** [yǒu wèi qì], and is called **easily treatable**. If one **seizes the pulse at the opportune moment** [qǔ zhī yǐ shí], then **all actions will succeed** [wàn jǔ wàn quán]. One should **administer treatment according to the seasonal location of blood and *qi*** [dàng yǐ sì shí xuè qì suǒ zài ér wéi liáo ér].

○[Newly corrected version states:] The phrase **"seize the pulse at the opportune moment"** [qǔ zhī yǐ shí] is rendered as **"treat and guide it"** [zhì zhī qū zhī] in *The Canon of A and B* [《Jiǎ Yǐ Jīng》], and **"never delay"** [wú hòu qí shí] aligns with the Wang lineage’s text, forming two complementary interpretations.

When **form and spirit-*qi* are discordant** [xíng qì xiāng shī], it is called **difficult to treat**. When **form is strong yet spirit-*qi* is weak** [xíng shèng qì xū], or **spirit-*qi* is strong yet form is weak** [qì shèng xíng xū], these are instances of **discordance**.

When **color is dull and luster is absent** [sè yāo bù zé], it is called **difficult to resolve**. *Dull* [yāo] means **obscured and unsightly**. *Luster absent* [bù zé] means **dry and withered**.

When the **pulse is firm and solid** [mài shí yǐ jiān], it is called **the illness worsening**. When the **spring pulse is firm and solid** [chún shí yǐ jiān], it signifies **pathogenic *qi* is rampant** [xié qì shèng], hence the illness **worsens**.

When the **pulse contradicts the four seasons** [mài nì sì shí], it is called **untreatable**, for the **vitality is inverse** [qì nì].

The following four sentences are the **Four Difficulties** [sì nàn], hence the subsequent passage states: **"One must discern the Four Difficulties and clearly inform the patient."** These Four Difficulties are what **the novice easily speaks of but the master struggles to apply**.

The so-called **"pulse contradicts the four seasons"** [nì sì shí] refers to:
- **Spring pulse resembling the lung’s drum** [chún dé fèi chún], yet appearing in **autumn** [qiū].
- **Summer pulse resembling the kidney’s drum** [xià dé shèn chún], yet appearing in **winter** [dōng].
- **Autumn pulse resembling the heart’s drum** [qiū dé xīn chún], yet appearing in **summer** [xià].
- **Winter pulse resembling the spleen’s pulse** [dōng dé pí chún], yet appearing in **spring** [chūn].

*Suspended and abrupt* [xuán jué] means **like a hanging object severed from its source**. If there is **no visceral form** [wèi yǒu zàng xíng], yet the **pulse is deep and slow** [mài chén sè] in **spring and summer**, or **floating and large** [mài fú dà] in **autumn and winter**, it is called **pulse contradicting the four seasons**.

○[Newly corrected version states:] According to *The Treatise on the Gastric Pulse of Balanced Individuals* [《Píng Rén Qì Xiàng Lùn》], it states: **"When the pulse is deep and slow, it is called *thin* [shòu]."** The meaning is the same as above. This text is erroneous; that treatise is correct.

In cases of:
- **illness with heat yet pulse is static** [réng],
- **diarrhea yet pulse is large** [xiè ér mài dà],
- **bleeding yet pulse is firm** [tuō xuè ér mài shí],

or when the **pulse is firm and solid in the middle** [mài zài zhōng shí jiān], or when the **pulse is not firm and solid on the exterior** [mài zài wài bù shí jiān], these are all **difficult to treat**.

These are all **difficult to treat** because **they do not correspond with the symptoms** [yǐ qí yǔ zhèng bù xiāng yìng].

○[Newly corrected version states:] According to *The Treatise on the Gastric Pulse of Balanced Individuals* [《Píng Rén Qì Xiàng Lùn》], it states: **"Illness is in the middle with *qi* deficiency** [mài zài zhōng yǐ xū], **and in the exterior with pulse deep and slow** [mài zài wài yǐ sè jiān]."** This is the opposite of the above. This text is mistaken; that treatise is accurate.

From the time when there was no mention of *qi* forms in spring and summer until now, this aligns with *The Treatise on the Gastric Pulse of Balanced Individuals*, with its interpretations fully detailed therein.

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I have heard that the distinction between emptiness and fullness determines life and death. I wish to hear the details."*

Qìbó replied: *"Five cases of fullness lead to death, and five cases of emptiness lead to death. The five fullnesses refer to the fullness of the five **zàng** organs. The five emptinesses refer to the emptiness of the five **zàng** organs."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish to hear of the five fullnesses and five emptinesses."*

Qìbó replied: *"A **pulse that is strong**, **hot skin**, **abdominal distension**, **obstruction of the anterior and posterior passages**, and **foul breath**—these are called the five fullnesses. Fullness refers to the predominance of **pathogenic *qi***.

Now, a **strong pulse** pertains to the **heart**; **hot skin** pertains to the **lung**; **abdominal distension** pertains to the **spleen**; **obstruction of the anterior and posterior passages** pertains to the **kidney**; and **foul breath** pertains to the **liver**.

A **fine pulse**, **cold skin**, **scanty *qi***, **diarrhea with undigested food**, and **inability to ingest food and drink**—these are called the five emptinesses. Emptiness refers to the insufficiency of **true *qi***.

Now, a **fine pulse** pertains to the **heart**; **cold skin** pertains to the **lung**; **scanty *qi*** pertains to the **liver**; **diarrhea with undigested food** pertains to the **kidney**; and **inability to ingest food and drink** pertains to the **spleen**."

The Yellow Emperor said: *"But sometimes there are cases where life is preserved—why is that?"*

Qìbó replied: *"When **congee enters the stomach** and **diarrhea ceases**, the empty ones may recover. When **sweating occurs and bowel movements normalize**, the full ones may recover. These are the signs."*

**Full Annotation:**
*"When congee can be ingested and enters the stomach, the stomach *qi* harmonizes, and the diarrhea gradually stops. As the stomach *qi* regains strength, the empty ones may recover. For the full ones, if sweating occurs externally and bowel movements normalize afterward, the condition naturally balances."*

**Discourse on the Three Divisions and Nine Investigations**

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"I have heard of the Nine Needles from Master [Qibo], vast and profound, beyond counting. I wish to grasp their essential Dao, to pass it down to my descendants, to transmit it to future generations, to inscribe it upon my bones and marrow, to store it in my liver and lungs, to receive it with solemn reverence—daring not to divulge it recklessly. [Here,] ‘enemy blood’ means ‘drinking blood’—to align with the Heavenly Dao. [Correction:] The newly collated text reads: ‘to align with the Heaven and Earth.’

There must be a beginning and an end, corresponding above to the luminaries and constellations of the celestial calendar, and below to the four seasons and five phases, with their hierarchies of honor and rank—winter’s yin and summer’s yang—how should one harmonize humanity with these? I wish to hear the method.

[Explanation:] ‘Heavenly luminaries’ refers to the sun, moon, and stars. ‘Calendar records’ refers to the sun and moon’s passage through the twenty-eight lunar mansions and the 365 degrees of the celestial sphere. [This speaks of] how the human form’s blood, *qi*, and the circulation of *honor* and *defense* align with the shifting seasons and correspond to the sun and moon’s paths.

Yet the Dipper’s Pole rotates, and the Yellow and Red Axes diverge."*

Winter, the sun follows the Yellow Axis near the south, so yin prevails;
Summer, the moon follows the Yellow Axis near the north, so yang flourishes.

The *qi* of the four seasons and five phases—
When the sovereign rules, it is noble;
When the minister aids, it is lowly.

Qìbó replied: *"Exquisite is your question!
This is the ultimate reckoning of Heaven and Earth.
The Way penetrates the subtle and refined, hence it is called an exquisite question.
'Ultimate reckoning' means the supreme principle of numbers.*

The Emperor said: *"I wish to hear the ultimate reckoning of Heaven and Earth,
How it harmonizes with the human form’s blood and *qi*,
And how it determines life and death—
How should one proceed?"*

Qìbó said: *"The ultimate reckoning of Heaven and Earth
Begins at One and ends at Nine.
Nine is an odd number.
Thus, the numbers of Heaven and Earth reach their extreme here.

One is Heaven,
Two is Earth,
Three is Humanity.
Multiply by three—
Three threes make Nine—
To correspond with the Nine Regions.
*The Classic of Names (Èr Yǎ)* says:
Beyond the city walls is the *jiāo* (suburb),
Beyond the *jiāo* is the *diàn* (hunting grounds),
Beyond the *diàn* is the *mù* (pasture),
Beyond the *mù* is the *lín* (forests),
Beyond the *lín* is the *jiǒng* (wilds),
Beyond the *jiǒng* is the *yě* (unbounded wilderness).
This speaks of their remoteness.

Thus, the human body has three divisions,
Each division has three pulses,
To discern life and death,
To diagnose a hundred ailments,
To regulate excess and deficiency,
And to dispel pathogenic *qi* and disease.

The ‘three divisions’ refer to the upper, middle, and lower regions of the body—not the *cùn*, *guān*, and *chǐ* [pulse positions].
Within these divisions, the channels and collaterals traverse,
Thus, observing the pulses to determine life or death
And applying needle techniques—
Pathogenic *qi* and disease can be removed."

The Emperor said: *"What are these three divisions?"*

Qìbó replied: *"There is the lower division, the middle division, and the upper division.
Each division has three pulses—
Heaven, Earth, and Humanity—
Which must be pointed out and explained clearly to be considered true.
[This warns:] One must receive instruction from a master.
*The Treatise on the Four Errors* says:
‘If one does not fully receive [teaching] from a master,
And rashly practices diverse pulse-taking,
Claiming it as the Way while renaming one’s own achievements,
Misusing lancets and needles—
Regret for one’s body will follow.’

*The Rites* say: ‘Do not presume in doubtful matters.’
‘Presume’ means to act without certainty.

**Upper Division:**
*Heaven* is the dynamic pulse of the two brows;
Located on either side of the forehead,
It responds to the hand—
The *qi* of the Foot *Shǎo Yáng* channel flows here.

*Earth* is the dynamic pulse of the two cheeks;
Located below the nostrils, near the *jùlú* [maxillary] region,
It responds to the hand—
The *qi* of the Foot *Yáng Míng* channel flows here.

*Humanity* is the pulse before the ear;
Located in the depression before the ear,
It responds to the hand—
The *qi* of the Hand *Shǎo Yáng* channel flows here.

**Middle Division:**
*Heaven* is the Hand *Tài Yīn* [Lung channel];
The Lung pulse,
Located at the posterior wrist crease, *Jīng Gǔ*,
It responds to the hand.

*Earth* is the Hand *Yáng Míng* [Large Intestine channel];
The Large Intestine pulse,
Located at the junction of the second and third metacarpals, *Hé Gǔ*,
It responds to the hand.

*Humanity* is the Hand *Shǎo Yīn* [Heart channel];
The Heart pulse,
Located at the ulnar end of the transverse carpal crease, *Shén Mén*,
It responds to the hand.
*The Spiritual Pivot: Treatise on Holding the Needle and Grasping the Pulse* asks:
‘If the *Shǎo Yīn* has no outlet, does the heart not fall ill?’
The reply:
‘When the external channel is diseased, the organ remains unaffected,
Thus, only the pulse at the posterior wrist crease, ulnar end, is taken.’

**Lower Division:**
*Heaven* is the Foot *Jué Yīn* [Liver channel];
The Liver pulse,
Located at the outer edge of the hairline, one and a half *cùn* below *Yáng Wèi*,
At the *Wǔ Lǐ* position,
Taken externally, it responds to the hand.
For women, *Tài Chōng* is taken—
Located two *cùn* behind the base of the big toe, in the depression.

*Earth* is the Foot *Shǎo Yīn* [Kidney channel];
The Kidney pulse,
Located in the depression above the medial malleolus, at *Dà Xī*,
It responds to the hand.

*Humanity* is the Foot *Tài Yīn* [Spleen channel];
The Spleen pulse,
Located at the medial aspect of the lower leg, above the medial malleolus, at *Jī Mén*,
With the foot slightly everted and the sole exposed,
It is taken here, and it responds to the hand.
To examine the *qi* of the stomach,
Take the pulse above the medial malleolus, at *Chōng Yáng*,
Where the pulse in the depression responds to the hand.

Thus, the lower division’s *Heaven* pulse examines the liver—
The Foot *Jué Yīn* channel flows here.
*Earth* examines the kidneys—
The Foot *Shǎo Yīn* channel flows here.
*Humanity* examines the *qi* of the spleen and stomach—
The Foot *Tài Yīn* channel flows here.
Since the spleen and stomach are connected by membrane,
Examining the spleen also examines the stomach."

The Emperor said: *"How does one examine the middle division?"*

Qìbó replied: *"It also has Heaven, Earth, and Humanity.
*Heaven* examines the lungs—
The Hand *Tài Yīn* channel is here.
*Earth* examines the chest’s *qi*—
The Hand *Yáng Míng* channel is here.
The classics say: ‘The intestines and stomach are examined together.’
Thus, the chest’s *qi* is examined.
*Humanity* examines the heart—
The Hand *Shǎo Yīn* channel is here."

The Emperor said: *"How does one examine the upper division?"*

Qìbó replied: *"It also has Heaven, Earth, and Humanity.
*Heaven* examines the *qi* of the head and horns—
Its position is at the head and horns, hence it examines their *qi*.
*Earth* examines the *qi* of the mouth and teeth—
Its position is near the mouth and teeth, hence it examines them.
*Humanity* examines the *qi* of the ears and eyes—
Its position aligns with the ear, and the pulse extends to the outer canthus,
Hence it examines them."*

The three divisions each have their own Heaven, their own Earth, and their own Humanity.
Threefold, they complete Heaven—
*The New Annotation* says: "Examine from *Threefold, they complete Heaven* to *nine orifices*, as it overlaps with *The Treatise on the Six Nodal Transformations*, with interpretations detailed therein."
Threefold, they complete Earth;
Threefold, they complete Humanity.
Threefold and thrice again, combined they form nine—
Nine divisions become the Nine Wilds, the Nine Wilds become the Nine Orifices.
Thus, they correspond to the ultimate numbers of Heaven and Earth.
Hence, five are the *Spirit Orifices*, four are the *Form Orifices*, together making the Nine Orifices.
The so-called *Spirit Orifices* are:
The liver houses the *hun* (ethereal soul),
The heart houses the *shen* (spirit),
The spleen houses the *yi* (intent),
The lungs house the *po* (corporeal soul),
The kidneys house the *zhi* (will).
Since all are inhabited by *shenqi* (spiritual *qi*), they are called the five *Spirit Orifices*.
The so-called *Form Orifices* are all like vessels externally expanded, hollow yet unyielding, converging within material form—hence they are called *Form Orifices*.
The four *Form Orifices* are:
One, the head and horns;
Two, the ears and eyes;
Three, the mouth and teeth;
Four, the chest.

*The New Annotation* says: "Examine the commentary on *Spirit Orifices* in *The Manifestation of the Five *Qi***—its text also overlaps with the annotations of *The Doctrine of the Movement of *Qi* Through Heaven* and *The Treatise on the Six Nodal Transformations*."

When the five *zàng* (viscera) are ruined, their colors must wither—
Withering is death.
Withering refers to the color of death, an abnormal sign.
Color is the banner of the spirit; the *zàng* are the spirit’s dwelling.
Thus, when the spirit departs, the *zàng* decay;
When the *zàng* decay, the color shows abnormal signs—death.

The Emperor asked: *"How does one diagnose?"*

Qìbó replied: *"First, measure the body’s fatness or leanness,
Then regulate the *qi*’s excess or deficiency—
Excess, drain it; deficiency, supplement it.
*Measure* means to gauge.
Draining excess, supplementing deficiency—this is called *following the Way of Heaven*.
*The Laozi* says: *‘The Way of Heaven takes from the having surplus to supplement the insufficient.’*
First, remove the blood and vessels, then regulate—
Do not inquire about the patient’s illness; balance is the goal.
When blood and vessels are full and firm, it means *pathogenic* *qi* lingers.
Thus, first puncture to remove blood, then regulate.
Do not probe the patient’s excess or deficiency—
Essentially, balance the pulse and *qi* as the standard.

The Emperor asked: *"How does one determine life or death?"*
*Measuring the body’s fatness or leanness, regulating the *qi*’s excess or deficiency,
Without questioning the patient, balance as the standard—
Life and death are thus determined.*

Qìbó replied: *"If the form is robust but the pulse is fine,
With little breath insufficient for respiration—this is perilous.
Form and *qi* are contrary, so vital *qi* is in extreme danger.
*The Treatise on the True Essence of the Divine Machine* says:
*‘When form and *qi* harmonize, it is treatable.’*
Now, the pulse and *qi* are insufficient, while the form is robust and excessive—
The signs do not support each other, hence it is perilous.
*Perilous* means near death, yet still alive.
*The Treatise on Piercing the Will* says:
*‘When *qi* is full and form is full, when *qi* is deficient and form is deficient—this is normal.
To reverse this is illness.’*
Now, the pulse is fine with little *qi*—this is *qi* weakness,
While the body is robust and excessive—this is *form* excess.
When form is excessive and *qi* is weak, vital *qi* tilts toward peril.
*The New Annotation*: According to Quán Yuánqǐ’s annotation and *The Canon of the Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branch* and *The Pulse Canon*, *perilous* is written as *dead* in both.

If the form is lean and the pulse is large,
With abundant *qi* in the chest—this is death.
This is when form and *qi* are insufficient,
While pulse and *qi* are excessive—hence death.
When the form is lean, the pulse is large, and chest *qi* is abundant,
The *Form Orifice* is already damaged—hence it is death.

Cases like these all involve form and *qi* not harmonizing.
When form and *qi* harmonize, there is life.
When the five *zàng* are unregulated, there is illness.
*Param* means to cross-examine, *wu* means to classify—
Cross-examining and classifying yet unregulated means deviating from the norm—illness.
When the three divisions and nine diagnoses all fail to correspond—death.
*Fail* means the *qi* diagnoses do not align.
The signs of failing correspondences in diagnosis are seven—
Their states are as described below.

When the pulses above, below, left, and right correspond like the rhythmic pounding of a *cāng* (mortar),
The illness is severe.
When above, below, left, and right fail to correspond beyond counting—death.
The three divisions, nine diagnoses, above, below, left, and right—
A total of eighteen diagnoses.
*Like the pounding of *cāng*** refers to the large, rhythmic beating,
As when pounding grain in a mortar—up and down.
*The Pulse Classic on Subtle Essentials* says: *‘Large pulses indicate advancing illness.’*
Thus, the illness is severe.
*Beyond counting* means ten beats per breath or more.
*The Pulse Method* says:
*‘One breath, the pulse arrives twice;
One inhalation, the pulse arrives twice—this is normal.
Three arrivals per breath is *déjīng* (departing essence),
Four arrivals is *tuōjīng* (detached essence),
Five arrivals is death,
Six arrivals is life’s end.’*
Now, when the pulses fail to correspond and exceed counting—
This is beyond ten arrivals.
At five arrivals, it is already death—
How much more at ten!

Even if the middle division’s diagnosis is alone in harmony,
Yet fails to correspond with the other *zàng*—death.
When the middle division’s diagnoses are deficient—death.
The middle division, left and right—
A total of six diagnoses.
If the upper and lower divisions already do not correspond,
While the middle alone is harmonious—
It will not endure long in the upper and lower—
This is also *qi* decay—hence all lead to death.
*Deficient* means one-sided lack.

*The New Annotation* says: "The original text lacks the eight characters *‘When the middle division’s diagnoses are deficient—death.’*
According to Quán Yuánqǐ’s annotated edition and *The Canon of the Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branch*, these were added,
And there is an explanation of *deficient* in the annotation,
Though the text omits it—this omission occurred after Wang’s annotation."

If the inner eye sinks—death.
This refers to the *Tàiyáng* (Greater Yang).
The *Tàiyáng* pulse arises at the inner canthus.
When the inner eye sinks, the *Tàiyáng* is severed—hence death.
This is spoken of as *Tàiyáng* because it governs all *yáng* *qi*—
Hence it is mentioned alone.

The Emperor asked: *"How does one know where the illness lies?"*

Qìbó replied: *"Observe when one of the nine diagnoses is alone small—illness;
Alone large—illness;
Alone rapid—illness;
Alone slow—illness;
Alone hot—illness;
Alone cold—illness;
Alone sunken and low—illness."*

The signs of **lost correspondence** in diagnosis encompass seven cases—this is what is meant.

Yet when the pulse exhibits all seven diagnoses, it means the **Five Phases** are unbalanced, and following whichever one is uniquely abnormal reveals the illness.

Using the left hand, press five *cù* above the ankle on the **left** foot and hand, while the right hand strikes at the ankle itself. Both hands and feet are examined thus: above the hand’s ankle lies the **Hand Taiyin** pulse; above the foot’s ankle lies the **Foot Taiyin** pulse. The **Foot Taiyin** pulse governs flesh, corresponding to the lower body, while the **Hand Taiyin** pulse governs *qi*, corresponding to the middle body. Hence the text later states: *"If flesh withers and does not recede, death."* If the middle region alternates between sparse and frequent, death follows.

**Newly corrected annotation:** The *Canon of Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branch* and Quán Yuánqǐ’s annotated edition both state: *"Press with the left hand five *cù* above the ankle, while the right hand strikes at the ankle."* Quán Yuánqǐ’s annotation says: *"Above the inner ankle, the *Yīnjiāo* emerges, connecting to the bladder and linking to the kidneys. The kidneys are the **Mìngmén** (Gate of Life), hence its examination to determine life or death."* The current text omits the *"the"* character but adds *"regardless"* and *"foot."* Wang’s annotation interprets *"both hands and feet examined"* as the solution, which is forced—it should follow Quán Yuánqǐ’s old edition and the *Canon of Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branch* as correct.

If the response extends beyond five *cù* upward, moving like worms—no illness exists; this is due to harmonized *qi*. If the response is rapid, with the middle hand feeling chaotic—illness; if the middle hand feels sluggish—illness. *"Chaotic"* means disordered; *"sluggish"* means slow. If the response cannot reach five *cù* upward and does not answer when struck—death. The *qi* is severed, hence no response. Thus, if flesh withers and does not recede, death follows. When the **Gǔqì** (grain *qi*) weakens externally, the flesh appears stripped away. When **Tiānzhēn** (Heavenly Purity) is exhausted internally, the body cannot move. Both **Gǔqì** and **Tiānzhēn** decline—death is inevitable. *"Recede"* means to depart, as in *"to move away."* If the middle region alternates between sparse and frequent—death. This alternation is the *qi*’s chaotic loss, hence death.

If the pulse **substitutes** and **hooks** (like the *Xià* pulse), the illness lies in the **luò** (collateral) vessels. *"Hooking"* refers to the *Xià* pulse; moreover, *Xià* *qi* resides in the *luò*, hence the illness is in the *luò*. When the *luò* vessels receive evil, the **jīngmài** (channel) pulses stagnate and falter, hence the substituting stoppage.

The **Nine Diagnoses** must correspond: if upper and lower align—no loss. *"Align"* means equal in speed, size, etc. If one diagnosis lags, illness exists; if two lag, the illness is severe; if three lag, the illness is critical. *"Lag"* means they do not respond together. *"Together"* means *"same"* or *"unified."* Examine the **fǔ** (organs) and **zàng** (entrails) to know the period of death or life. When illness enters the **fǔ**, recovery follows; when it enters the **zàng**, death follows. Hence, the period of life or death is determined—examine to know it. One must first know the **jīngmài**, then know the disease pulse. The **jīngmài** are the pulses of the four seasons and five **zàng**.

If the **true zàng** pulses appear, death is imminent. The **true zàng** pulses are:
- The **true liver** pulse arrives, firm and tense like tracing a blade’s edge, *zhézhé* like pressing a *qín* or *sè* string.
- The **true heart** pulse arrives, firm and beating, like tracing *cāngmáo zǐ* (a type of seed) clustered together.
- The **true spleen** pulse arrives, weak, alternating between frequent and sparse.
- The **true lung** pulse arrives, large and hollow, like feathers brushing the skin.
- The **true kidney** pulse arrives, beating and abrupt, like plucking a stone *bìbì*.

These five are all cases where the **true zàng** pulses appear but **wèiqì** (stomach *qi*) is absent. The *Treatise on the Physiology of the Common Man* states: *"The stomach is the common *qi* of the healthy; if a person lacks stomach *qi*, it is called **nì** (reversal), and reversal means death."* This is what is meant.

*"Death is imminent"* means that if the pulse overpowers its own seasonal time, death follows. The *Treatise on the Physiology of the Common Man* states:
*"If the liver appears on *gēngxīn* (days governed by Wood), death follows.
If the heart appears on *rénguǐ* (days governed by Fire), death follows.
If the spleen appears on *jiǎyǒu* (days governed by Earth), death follows.
If the lung appears on *bǐngdīng* (days governed by Metal), death follows.
If the kidney appears on *wùjǐ* (days governed by Water), death follows."*
This is called *"death is imminent."*

If the **Foot Taiyang** *qi* is severed, the foot cannot flex or extend, and death will occur with the eyes staring upward. The **Foot Taiyang** pulse arises at the inner canthus, ascends the forehead to meet at the crown, enters to network the brain, descends to branch at the nape, follows the inner shoulder, skirts the spine to the waist’s center. Its branch further descends from the shoulder, passes through the buttock, reaches the **píshū** (sacral vertebra), descends to meet the **yīnliáng** (inguinal region), pierces the **duān** (perineum), follows the heel to the foot’s outer side. If the **Taiyang** *qi* is severed, death will be as described.

**Newly corrected annotation:** According to the *Essentials of Diagnosis and Treatment*, the three **yang** and three **yin** pulses’ terminal signs are recorded. Here, only the **Foot Taiyang** *qi* severed case is mentioned—likely the rest of the text is omitted. Additionally, the annotation *"passes through the buttock"* is written as *"passes through the girdle"* in the *Canon of Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branch*. Wang’s annotation in the *Treatise on Ulceration* and *Treatise on Malarial Fever* uses *"contributes to swelling."* Again, in the *Treatise on Lumbago*, it is written as *"passes through the buttock."* Examining the *Canon of Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branch*, *"buttock"* should be *"swelling."*

The Emperor asked: *"How does one know the time of death in winter’s yin and summer’s yang?"* (Referring to the time of death.)

Qìbó replied: *"If the **Nine Diagnoses** pulses are all **depressed, fine, suspended, and severed**, this is **yin**, governing winter, hence death occurs at midnight. If they are **exuberant, agitated, and rapid**, this is **yang**, governing summer, hence death occurs at noon. Position has no fixed abode; extremes invert. The *Kàn* and *Kūn* trigrams’ lines—when yin reaches its extreme, the dragon struggles in the wild; when yang reaches its extreme, the soaring dragon regrets. Hence, when yin and yang pulses reach their extremes, death occurs at midnight or noon.*

Thus, those with **cold-heat diseases** die at dawn. This too is the principle of extremes transforming. At dawn, **Wood** reigns—**Wood** *qi* is **wind**, hence during Wood’s reign, cold-heat diseases lead to death. The *Treatise on the Movement of Vital *Qi* Through the Heavens* states: *"Exposure to dew and wind gives rise to cold-heat."* Hence, cold-heat diseases are caused by thin, invasive **wind**. Those with **heat in the center** or **heat diseases** die at noon.

At the extreme of **yang**, those afflicted by **wind** die at dusk. This is due to the **Taoist hour clash** between *Mao* (coat) and *You* (snake).

Those with **water** diseases die at midnight, for **Water** reigns then. If the pulse is alternately sparse, rapid, slow, or hurried, death occurs at the **four seasonal crossings**—*Chen*, *Wei*, *Chou*, and *You*—when **Earth** temporarily reigns. The *spleen qi* is internally severed, hence death at these crossings.

Even if the flesh has already detached and the **Nine Regions** are harmonized, death still occurs. This is called **"form and *qi* not harmonizing."** If the **Nine Regions** are already detached but the body remains, even if the **Nine Regions** are balanced, death still occurs.

If the **Seven Diagnoses** are present but the **Nine Regions** all comply, death does not occur. If the **Nine Regions** follow the **Four Seasons’ commands**, even if the **Seven Diagnoses** appear, life is preserved. *"Comply"* means to follow in accordance.

The cases I speak of as not dying are **wind-*qi* diseases** and **monthly cycle diseases**, which resemble the **Seven Diagnoses** but are not. Hence, they do not lead to death. The pulse of **wind diseases** is large and rapid. The pulse of **monthly cycle diseases** is small and faint. Though the **Nine Regions** and the **Seven Diagnoses** appear similar, the signs of life and death differ, hence they do not lead to death.

If one has the **Seven Diagnoses** and the pulse and **Nine Regions** are disordered, death occurs. Though the **Nine Regions** follow and the **Seven Diagnoses** appear, if the pulse is chaotic, life is still lost. There must be **groaning and sighing**. When the **stomach essence** is exhausted and the spirit does not guard the heart, at the time of death, these groans and sighs emerge. The *Treatise on the Manifestation of the Five *Qi*** states: *"The heart is responsible for sighing; the stomach for groaning."*

One must carefully inquire about the patient’s initial illness and the current condition. *"Condition"* means the present state. One must trace the beginning and examine the end. Then, each must palpate the pulse, observing the **meridians’** floating and sinking, and follow them upward and downward, whether they flow or resist. If the pulse is rapid, there is no illness—**qi** is strong. If the pulse is slow, illness is present—**qi** is deficient. If the pulse does not circulate, death occurs—the spirit has departed. If the skin is taut, death occurs—the bones are withered.

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How can such cases be treated?"*
Gebber replied: *"For **meridian diseases**, treat the **meridian**—seek the excess. For **grand collateral diseases**, treat the **grand collateral blood**—if blood stagnates, lance it to remove it."* (New annotation: The *Jia Yi Jing* states: *"For collateral diseases, treat the collateral blood."* There is no *"grand"* character.)

If the disease lies in **odd meridians**, lance the **odd meridians**—*"odd"* refers to irregular, unpaired *qi* that intersects with the **meridians**, hence it is lanced obliquely. Lance the **grand collaterals** left-to-right or right-to-left. If emaciation lingers without improvement, regulate the pulse and lance it. If the disease-*qi* lingers, the body withers, and the signs do not shift, then adjust the treatment and lance it. This further clarifies the earlier passage where no inquiry was made about the disease, and balance was the goal.

If there is **upper fullness and lower emptiness**, palpate and follow the pulse, seeking the **structured grand collaterals**, lance to release the blood, and ensure the **meridian** flows. *"Structured"* means blood congeals in the **grand collateral**. Once the blood is released, the **meridian** will flow freely. The earlier passage states: *"First remove the blood and *qi*, then restore balance."* This clarifies that the **structured grand collateral** must be addressed first. (New annotation: The *Jia Yi Jing* reads *"to harmonize the *qi*"* instead of *"to see it flow."*)

If the pupils are high, **Taiyang** is deficient. If the eyes are hooded, **Taiyang** is severed—this is the critical point between life and death, and must be observed.

(Note: The text mentions *"hand fingers and the five toes above the outer ankle"*—likely a scribal error.)

**Discourse on the Meridian Variations**
The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Do a person’s dwelling, movement, stillness, courage, or timidity cause the pulse to vary?"*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Do a person’s dwelling, movement, stillness, courage, or timidity cause the pulse to vary?"*

**Qi Bó** replied: *"All human experiences of fright, terror, overwork, exertion, or stillness—whether from movement or rest—will cause the pulse to vary. By 'vary,' I mean that the pulse deviates from its usual state, the **常侯** [constant norm].

Thus, nighttime walking causes **喘息** [labored breathing] originating from the **肾** [kidneys]. The kidneys reign supreme at night, their **氣** [*qi*] merging with the **幽冥** [profound darkness], so nighttime walking exhausts the kidneys, resulting in **喘息** [labored breathing] arising internally from the kidneys. If **淫氣** [*excessive or errant qi*] afflicts the **肺** [lungs], then nighttime walking strains the kidneys, leading to **喘息** [labored breathing], where the **淫氣** [*excessive qi*] does not follow its proper course—this will cause disease in the lungs.

If one falls into terror, **喘息** [labored breathing] emerges from the **肝** [liver]. Fear originates in the liver, and falling damages the sinews and blood, causing **奔喘** [sudden, erratic breathing], hence it arises from the liver. When **淫氣** [*excessive qi*] harms the **脾** [spleen], the liver’s wood nature acts in reckless excess, thereby damaging the spleen’s earth nature.

If one is startled or terrified, **喘息** [labored breathing] originates from the **肺** [lungs]. Sudden fright leaves the heart without support#1, and the spirit without anchor—**氣** [*qi*] becomes disordered in the chest, thus **喘息** [labored breathing] arises from the lungs. If **淫氣** [*excessive qi*] injures the heart, then fright causes the spirit to stray, and the **淫氣** [*errant qi*] rebounds to harm the heart.

When crossing water and stumbling or falling, **喘息** [labored breathing] emerges from the **肾** [kidneys] and **骨** [bones]. Dampness permeates the kidneys, and the bones fall under their dominion—thus, when crossing water and stumbling or falling, **喘息** [labored breathing] arises from the kidneys and bones. 'Stumbling' refers to tripping the feet, and 'falling' refers to the body toppling."

「跌 [*díe* – *to trip/fall*], pronounced *diè*; **仆** [*pǔ* – *to topple*], pronounced *fù*. At such times, the **勇者** [bold individuals] will disperse their **氣** [*qi*] and thus recover, while the **怯者** [timid individuals] will retain it and fall ill. **氣** [*qi*] has strength and weakness, the **神** [spirit] has vigor and frailty, hence the varied symptoms.

Thus it is said: The **道** [Way] of diagnosing illness lies in observing a person’s boldness or timidity, their **骨** [bones], **肉** [flesh], **皮肤** [skin], and discerning their condition to establish the diagnostic method. To grasp their innate disposition and understand their symptoms is to attain profound insight, aligning with the **物宜** [principles of correspondence].

Hence, when one’s **饮食** [diet] is excessively indulged, **汗** [sweat] emerges from the **胃** [stomach]. When the stomach is overfilled and replete, **汗** [sweat] thus arises from the **胃** [stomach]. Sudden fright depletes the **精** [essence], causing **汗** [sweat] to emanate from the **心** [heart]. Fright disrupts the heart’s **精** [essence], making the **神** [spirit] and **氣** [*qi*] surge upward—**阳** [yang] energy grows thin within—thus **汗** [sweat] arises from the **心** [heart]. When bearing heavy loads or traveling far, **汗** [sweat] emerges from the **肾** [kidneys]. **骨** [Bones] labor and **氣** [*qi*] rebels, the **肾** [kidneys] then overworks and suffers, hence when bearing heavy loads or traveling far, **汗** [sweat] arises from the **肾** [kidneys]. Rapid running or terror induces **汗** [sweat] from the **肝** [liver]. Violent exertion upon the **筋** [tendons], the **肝** [liver]’s **氣** [*qi*] exhausted to its limit, thus **汗** [sweat] arises from the **肝** [liver] in cases of rapid running or terror. Shaking the body or enduring hardship causes **汗** [sweat] from the **脾** [spleen]. "Shaking the body" refers to movements requiring force, not rapid running or long travel. Yet when such movements exert strength, the **谷精** [nutrient-essence of grains] disperses throughout—**脾** [spleen] transforms water and grain—thus **汗** [sweat] arises from the **脾** [spleen].

Thus, in spring, autumn, winter, and summer, the four seasons’ **阴阳** [yin-yang], illnesses arise from excessive strain—this is the norm. If one does not suit their nature and forces action, imbalance will spawn disease—this is the constant principle. The five **藏** [organs] receive **氣** [*qi*], each with its fixed allocation; if overused and depleted, disease ensues. Hence the following text states:

**食气** [*qi* of food] enters the **胃** [stomach], dispersing **精** [essence] to the **肝** [liver], and **淫气** [*excessive qi*] to the **筋** [tendons]. The **肝** [liver] nourishes the **筋** [tendons], so when the **胃** [stomach] disperses the **谷精** [*qi* of grain-essence] into the **肝** [liver], it permeates and nourishes the **筋络** [tendinous network]. **食气** [*qi* of food] enters the **胃** [stomach], **浊气** [*impure qi* – *grain-qi*] returns to the **心** [heart], and **淫精** [*errant essence*] overflows into the **脉** [vessels]. **浊气** [*impure qi*] refers to **谷气** [*qi* of grains]. The **心** [heart] resides above the **胃** [stomach], so **谷气** [*qi* of grains] returns to the **心** [heart], overflowing essence into the **脉** [vessels]. Why? Because the **心** [heart] governs the **脉** [vessels]. **脉气** [*qi* of vessels] flows through the **经** [channels], **经气** [*qi* of channels] converges in the **肺** [lungs], which receives the **百脉** [hundred vessels] and distributes **精** [essence] to the **皮毛** [skin and hair]. It speaks of **脉气** [*qi* of vessels] flowing and dispersing as the great **经** [channels], **经气** [*qi* of channels] returning to the **宗** [root], ascending to the **肺** [lungs]. The **肺** [lungs] serves as the **华盖** [*huágài* – *ornamental pavilion*], positioned high, its regulation unmatched, hence it receives the **百脉** [hundred vessels].

*The *Discourse on the Physiology of the Normal Person* [*Píngrén Qìxiàng Lùn*] states: The **藏真** [true essence of organs] is higher than the **肺** [lungs], enabling it to govern the **荣卫** [*róngwèi* – *nutritive and defensive qi*] and **阴阳** [yin-yang]. Thus, the **肺** [lungs] receives the **百脉** [hundred vessels], yet it disperses and transforms **精气** [*qi* of essence], distributing it to the **皮毛** [skin and hair].

When **毛脉** [hair and vessels] merge with **精** [essence], **氣** [*qi*] flows to the **府** [*fǔ* – *entrails*]. The **府** [*fǔ*] refers to where **氣** [*qi*] accumulates—this is called the **气海** [*Qìhǎi* – *Sea of Qi*], located between the two breasts, with the right side named **膻中** [*tánzhōng* – *chest center*]. **府** [*fǔ*]’s **精神** [*shénqì* – *spirit-qi*] disperses, lingering in the four **藏** [organs], while **氣** [*qi*] returns to the **权衡** [*Qūnhéng* – *balancing point*]. The **膻中** [*tánzhōng* – *chest center*]’s dispersed **氣** [*qi*] divides into three **隧** [*sùn* – *passages*]: the lower flows to the **气街** [*Qìjiē* – *Street of Qi*], the upper to the **息道** [*Xīdào* – *Pathway of Breath*], and the **宗气** [*Zōngqì* – *Root Qi*] lingers in the **海** [*Hǎi* – *Sea*], accumulating in the chest—this is called the **气海** [*Qìhǎi* – *Sea of Qi*].

Thus, through this differentiation, the four **藏** [organs] remain stable, the three **焦** [*jiāo* – *burners/triple energizers*] balanced, and the inner and outer, upper and lower all find their proper place. When **权衡** [*Qūnhéng* – *balancing point*] is harmonized, the **气口** [*Qìkǒu* – *Qi Mouth*] forms a **寸** [*cùn* – *inch*], determining life or death. The **三世** [*Sānshì* – *three generations’*] **脉法** [*màifǎ* – *pulse methods*] all measure three **寸** [*cùn*] as the division for **寸关尺** [*cùnguānchǐ* – *inch, wrist, cubit*]. Thus, when the inner and outer, high and low **氣** [*qi*] are balanced, the **气口** [*Qìkǒu* – *Qi Mouth*]’s pulse becomes a **寸** [*cùn*].

The **气口** [*Qìkǒu* – *Qi Mouth*] is the grand convergence of **脉** [vessels], where all **百脉** [hundred vessels] assemble, hence its divisions determine life or death. **饮** [fluids] enters the **胃** [stomach], dispersing **精气** [*qi* of essence], ascending to the **脾** [spleen]. Water and drink flow downward, reaching the **中焦** [*Zhōngjiāo* – *middle burner*], where water transforms into **精微** [*jīngwēi* – *essence and subtleties*], ascending as **云雾** [*yúnwù* – *clouds and mist*]. When **云雾** [*yúnwù*] disperse and change, they pour into the **脾** [spleen].

*The *Spiritual Pivot Classic* [*Língshū Jīng*] states: "The **上焦** [*Shàngjiāo* – *upper burner*] is like mist, the **中焦** [*Zhōngjiāo* – *middle burner*] like a pivot." This is what is meant.

**脾气** [*Qi* of spleen] disperses **精** [essence], ascending to the **肺** [lungs], regulating the waterways and distributing downward to the **膀胱** [*pángguāng* – *bladder*]. When water and earth harmonize, they ascend to nourish **肺金** [*Feìjīn* – *lung metal*], and **金气** [*qi* of metal] connects with the **肾** [kidneys], hence the regulation of waterways and the downward transmission to the **下焦** [*Xiàjiāo* – *lower burner*], where the **膀胱** [bladder] receives and transforms it into **波** [*bō* – *urine*].

*The *Spiritual Pivot Classic* [*Língshū Jīng*] states: "The **下焦** [*Xiàjiāo* – *lower burner*] is like a marsh." This is what is meant.

**水精** [*Qi* of water-essence] disperses throughout, the five **经** [channels] flow together, aligning with the four seasons. The **五藏** [*Wǔzàng* – *five organs*]’s **阴阳** [yin-yang] are measured as the norm.

From this, **水精** [*qi* of water-essence] disperses, **经气** [*qi* of channels] flows, **筋骨** [tendons and bones] solidify, **血气** [*xuèqì* – *blood-qi*] harmonizes, and it corresponds with the four seasons’ **寒暑** [*hánshǔ* – *cold and heat*], confirming the **五藏** [*Wǔzàng* – *five organs*]’s **阴阳** [yin-yang]. **睽** [*kuí* – *to diverge*] and **度** [*liáng* – *to measure*] fullness and emptiness, this is the **常道** [*Chángdào* – *constant principle*]. **度** [*liáng*] means to measure, **以** [*yǐ*] means to use.

*The newly corrected text states: According to one version, it should read: "yin-yang **动静** [*Dòngjìng* – *active and passive*]." When **太阳** [*Tàiyáng* – *Greater Yang*] **藏** [*zàng* – *organ*] alone arrives, **厥喘** [*juéchuǎn* – *reverse breathing/labored breathing*] occurs with **虚气** [*xūqì* – *empty qi*] rebelling—this is **阴** [yin] deficiency and **阳** [yang] excess. **阴** [yin] refers to the **肾** [kidneys], **阳** [yang] to the **膀胱** [bladder]. Hence the following text states:

"Both **表** [*biǎo* – *exterior*] and **裹** [*guǒ* – *enveloping*] should be dispelled, and the **下俞** [*Xiàyǔ* – *lower acupuncture points*] taken." **阳** [yang] alone arrives means **阳气** [*qi* of yang] is excessively strong. When **阳气** [*qi* of yang] is excessive, **阴** [yin] deficiency allows **阳邪** [*yángxié* – *yang pathogens*] to invade, hence both **表** [*biǎo*] and **裹** [*guǒ*] must be dispelled, and the **足** [*zú* – *foot*]’s **六俞** [*Liùyǔ* – *six acupuncture points*] taken.

*The newly corrected text states: It seems "six" should be "acupuncture points" [*穴* – *xué*], an error.* The **府** [*fǔ* – *entrails*] has six **俞** [*yǔ* – *acupuncture points*], while the **藏** [*zàng* – *organs*] have five. Now, when both **藏** [*zàng*] and **府** [*fǔ*] are dispelled, it should not be called six **俞** [*yǔ*]; six **俞** [*yǔ*] cannot encompass the **藏** [*zàng*]. **穴俞** [*xuéyǔ* – *acupuncture points*] can include both **藏** [*zàng*] and **府** [*fǔ*].

When **阳明** [*Yángmíng* – *Lesser Yang*] **藏** [*zàng* – *organ*] alone arrives, this is **阳气** [*qi* of yang] being excessively dense, requiring **写阳补阴** [*xiě yáng bǔ yīn* – *dispel yang and supplement yin*] and taking the **下俞** [*Xiàyǔ* – *lower acupuncture points*].

When **少阳** [*Shǎoyáng* – *Lesser Yang*] **藏** [*zàng* – *organ*] alone arrives, this is **厥气** [*juéqì* – *reverse/pathogenic qi*], with **娇** [*qiāo* – *to press lightly*] the **前** [*qián* – *forehead*] and **卒** [*cù* – *to strike suddenly*] the **大** [*dà* – *great*]. **踏** [*tà* – *to tread*] refers to **阳踏脉** [*yángtà mài* – *yang-pressing pulse*], located below the outer ankle of the foot. The **足少阳脉** [*Zú Shǎoyáng Mài* – *foot lesser yang channel*] travels to the end of **绝骨** [*jué gǔ* – *cutting bone*], descending from the outer ankle’s front, following the foot’s lateral side.

Now when one **stumbles forward** [*shān qián*] and **strikes suddenly** [*cù dà*], this is the **Lesser Yang** [*Shǎoyáng*] **qi** being excessive—hence, the **foot acupuncture points of Lesser Yang** are taken.

When **Lesser Yang alone arrives**, this is the **excess of one yang**—**Lesser Yang** itself. **"Excess"** refers to **Great Excess** [*Dàguò*]. Because of this **Great Excess**, one **presses lightly the forehead** [*qiāo qián*] and **strikes suddenly** [*cù dà*].

When the **Too-Yin** [*Tàiyīn*] **organ** is **palpitating** [*bó*], one must **focus the mind and verify the truth**—if the **Too-Yin** pulse is **latent yet throbbing** [*fú gǔ*], then one must **focus the mind and examine it closely**. If it is truly the **organ’s pulse**, it should not be treated.

When the **five pulses are diminished** and **stomach qi is unbalanced**, this pertains to the **three yins**—the **Too-Yin** pulse of the **spleen**. When the **five organ pulses are diminished** and **stomach qi is disordered**, this is also an **excess of Too-Yin**. One should treat the **lower acupuncture points**, **supplementing yang** and **dispelling yin**, for the **yin qi is excessively overbearing**.

When **one yang howls alone** [*yī yáng zhì xiào*], this is **Lesser Yang reversal** [*jué*]. **"Howling"** refers to a **whistling sound in the ears**, like a **howling voice**. Since the **gallbladder** and **triple burner** pulses all enter the ear, when **qi reverses upward**, the ears whistle.

---
**New Annotation** states: Examining the above, the **three yangs** were clarified earlier; here, the **three yins** are discussed. Now, **Lesser Yang** is mentioned again without including **Lesser Yin**, suggesting this **"one yang"** may be a miswriting for **"two yins."** Further, referencing **Quán Yuánqǐ’s** text, it was originally **"Lesser Yin reversal"** [*Shǎoyīn jué*], clearly indicating this is indeed the **two yins**.

When **yang converges above**, the **four pulses contend and expand**, and **qi returns to the kidneys**. The **heart, spleen, liver, and lungs**—these **four pulses contend and expand**, while **yang converges above**, meaning **kidney qi is insufficient**, so **qi returns to the kidneys**. One should treat the **channels and collaterals**, **dispelling yang** and **supplementing yin**. When **yin qi is sufficient**, **yang will no longer converge above**.

When **one yin arrives**, this is the treatment for **Reversal-Yin** [*Juéyīn*]. **True emptiness** causes **heart pain**; **reversal qi lingers thinly**, manifesting as **white sweat**. One should **regulate diet and harmonize medicines**, treating the **lower acupuncture points**. **"One"** is mistakenly written as **"two"**—an error. **Reversal-Yin** is **one yin**. Earlier, it was stated that when **two yins arrive**, **Lesser Yin treatment** is required; now, when **Reversal-Yin** is treated, it corresponds to **one yin arriving**.

However, the **Sanfeng Classics** have long been lost to vulgarization, few study them, and many characters have been incorrectly transcribed. **"瘠"** [*jí*] (pronounced *Wū Xián*), meaning **aching joints**.

**The Emperor** asked: *"What is the symbolism of the **Too-Sun** [*Tàiyáng*] **organ**?"*
**Qíbó** replied: *"It symbolizes **three yangs** and **floating**."*

**The Emperor** asked: *"What is the symbolism of the **Lesser Yang** **organ**?"*
**Qíbó** replied: *"It symbolizes **one yang**—**one yang** in the **organ** is **slippery yet hollow**."*

**The Emperor** asked: *"What is the symbolism of the **Yang-Bright** [*Yángmíng*] **organ**?"*
**Qíbó** replied: *"It symbolizes **great floating**."*
**New Annotation** states: Referencing *Tàisù* and **Quán Yuánqǐ’s** text: *"It symbolizes the **heart’s great floating**."*

When the **Too-Yin organ is palpitating**, it speaks of **latent throbbing**. When **two yins transmit**, the **kidney pulse is deep yet not floating**—this clarifies the **pulse state of previous solitary arrivals**.

---
**New Annotation** states: Earlier, **two yins** were omitted, and here, **one yin** is missing—**the text is clearly incomplete**.

**Chapter on the Laws of Organ Qi** [*Zàngqì Fǎ Shí Luàn Piān*]

**The Yellow Emperor** asked: *"If one harmonizes human form with the **Four Seasons** and **Five Phases** for treatment, how does one follow the natural order? How does one go against it? I wish to understand the principles of **gain and loss**. Tell me the details."*

**Qíbó** replied: *"The **Five Phases** are **metal, wood, water, fire, and earth**, each taking turns in **nobility and humility**, determining **life and death**, deciding **success and failure**, and establishing the **qi of the five organs**. When asking about **critical moments**, one can determine the **periods of life and death**."*

**The Emperor** said: *"I wish to hear this thoroughly."*

**Qíbó** replied: *"The **liver governs spring**, corresponding to **wood**. The **foot Reversal-Yin** and **Lesser Yang** channels govern treatment. **Reversal-Yin** is the **liver pulse**; **Lesser Yang** is the **gallbladder pulse**. Since the **liver and gallbladder** are paired, their treatments are the same. The days are **Jia and Yi**—**Jia and Yi** belong to **wood**, the **eastern stem-branches**. The **liver suffers from urgency**; one should **urgently eat sweet** to **relax it**. **Sweetness** has a **harmonizing, relaxing nature**."

**New Annotation** states: Referencing **Quán Yuánqǐ’s** text: *"The liver suffers from urgency, meaning its **qi is in excess**."*

*"The **heart governs summer**, corresponding to **fire**. The **hand Lesser Yin** and **Too-Sun** channels govern treatment. **Lesser Yin** is the **heart pulse**; **Too-Sun** is the **small intestine pulse**. Since the **heart and small intestine** are paired, their treatments are the same. The days are **Bing and Ding**—**Bing and Ding** belong to **fire**, the **southern stem-branches**. The **heart suffers from slackness**; one should **urgently eat sour** to **contract it**. **Sourness** has a **contracting, astringent nature**."*

**New Annotation** states: Referencing **Quán Yuánqǐ’s** text: *"The heart suffers from slackness, meaning **heart qi is deficient**."*

*"The **spleen governs long summer**—**long summer** refers to the **sixth month**. **Summer** is the **mother of earth**; earth **grows in the center**, and since it **lengthens** in treatment, it is called **long summer**."*

**New Annotation** states: Referencing **Quán Yuánqǐ’s** text: *"The spleen reigns over the four seasons; the sixth month is where **fire reigns**, as the spleen governs the **center**, the sixth month being the **midpoint of the twelve months** and **halfway through the year**, hence the spleen reigns over the sixth month."*

*"The **foot Too-Yin** and **Yang-Bright** channels govern treatment. **Too-Yin** is the **spleen pulse**; **Yang-Bright** is the **stomach pulse**. Since the **spleen and stomach** are paired, their treatments are the same. The days are **Wu and Ji**—**Wu and Ji** belong to **earth**, the **central stem-branches**. The **spleen suffers from dampness**; one should **urgently eat bitter** to **dry it**. **Bitterness** has a **drying nature**."*

*"The **lung governs autumn**, corresponding to **metal**. The **hand Too-Yin** and **Yang-Bright** channels govern treatment. **Too-Yin** is the **lung pulse**; **Yang-Bright** is the **large intestine pulse**. Since the **lung and large intestine** are paired, their treatments are the same. The days are **Geng and Xin**—**Geng and Xin** belong to **metal**, the **western stem-branches**. The **lung suffers from upward-reversing qi**; one should **urgently eat bitter** to **drain it**. **Bitterness** has a **dispersing, draining nature**, hence the **lung** uses it."*

**New Annotation** states: Referencing **Quán Yuánqǐ’s** text: *"Lung qi reversing upward means its **qi is in excess**."*

*"The **kidney governs winter**, corresponding to **water**. The **foot Lesser Yin** and **Too-Sun** channels govern treatment. **Lesser Yin** is the **kidney pulse**; **Too-Sun** is the **bladder pulse**. Since the **kidney and bladder** are paired, their treatments are the same. The days are **Rén and Guǐ**—**Rén and Guǐ** belong to **water**, the **northern stem-branches**. The **kidney suffers from dryness**; one should **urgently eat pungent** to **moisten it**, **open the remaining passages**, **direct fluids**, and **circulate qi**. **Pungency** has a **moistening nature**."*

When the **victorious principle** is opened and **fluids reach their proper course**, then **lung qi descends and flows**, and the **kidney and lung communicate**—thus it is said that **qi is harmonized**.

When illness is in the **liver**, it is cured in **summer**—
the **child restrains its specter**—
the **remaining effects are the same**.

If not cured in **summer**, it worsens in **autumn**—
the **child rests**, and the **specter reigns again**—
the **remaining effects are the same**.

If not fatal in **autumn**, it persists into **winter**—
the **specter rests**, and the **mother nourishes**,
so **qi is sustained in the domain of the parents**.
The **remaining effects are the same**.

It revives in **spring**,
returning to its proper place—
thus it **rises again**.
The **remaining effects are the same**.

**Avoid exposure to wind**—
for **wind-qi** penetrates the **liver**, so it must be **restrained and not provoked**.

For those with **liver disease**, recovery occurs in **Jǐng and Dīng**—
**Jǐng and Dīng** correspond to **summer**.
If not cured in **Jǐng and Dīng**, it worsens in **Gēng and Xīn**—
**Gēng and Xīn** correspond to **autumn**.
If not fatal in **Gēng and Xīn**, it persists into **Rén and Guǐ**—
**Rén and Guǐ** correspond to **winter**.
It revives in **Jiǎ and Yǐ**—
corresponding to **spring wood**.

For those with **liver disease**:
**Dawn clarity is keen**,
**evening fatigue is severe**,
**midnight tranquility prevails**.
When **wood rules**, **clarity is sharp**.
When **metal rules**, **fatigue intensifies**.

**When water rules, thus tranquility retreats.**
The **remaining clarity is the same**, but its **tranquility differs slightly**.
The **liver seeks to disperse**—
**urgently consume pungent** to disperse it,
for **the organ’s qi must be dispersed**—
thus **pungent releases and scatters it**.
*The *Yīn-Yáng Yìng Xiàng Dà Lùn* states:*
**"Pungent and sweet disperse as yang."**
*The *Píng Rén Qì Xiàng Lùn* states:*
**"The organ’s true essence disperses in the liver."**
This speaks of its **constant dispersion**.
**Use pungent to supplement it, sour to alleviate it.**
Pungent’s flavor disperses—hence it **supplements**,
Sour’s flavor contracts—hence it **alleviates**.

*Newly corrected text states:*
*"According to Quán Yuánqǐ’s version:*
**‘Use sour to supplement it, pungent to alleviate it.’**
This forms another principle."*

**When disease is in the heart,**
recovery occurs in **long summer**,
long summer uncured, worsens in **winter**,
winter not fatal, persists into **spring**,
revives in **summer**—
as with the **liver’s pattern**.

**Avoid warm foods and heated garments.**
Heat causes **heart agitation**—thus it is **prohibited**.
For those with **heart disease,**
recovery occurs in **Wù and Jǐ**—
**Wù and Jǐ correspond to long summer**.
If **Wù and Jǐ** do not cure, it worsens in **Rén and Guǐ**—
**Rén and Guǐ correspond to winter**.
If not fatal in **Rén and Guǐ**, it persists into **Jiǎ and Yǐ**—
**Jiǎ and Yǐ correspond to spring**.
It revives in **Jǐng and Dīng**—
corresponding to **summer fire**.

**For those with heart disease,**
clarity peaks at **midday**,
intensifies at **midnight**,
and calms at **dawn**—
this too follows the **resting and reigning principle**.

The heart craves **vigorous vitality**—
in urgency, consume **salty** to **restrain** it,
for the **organs’ qi** prefers moderation,
thus **salty** softens and restrains.

*The Treatise on the Qi of the Common Man* states:
*The organ’s true essence communicates with the heart.*
This speaks of its **constant need for restraint**.

**Supplement with salty** to reinforce,
**use sweet** to relieve.
Salty reinforces—**taken for its softening restraint**.
Sweet relieves—**taken for its gentle ease**.

**When disease is in the spleen,**
recovery occurs in **autumn**,
autumn uncured, worsens in **spring**,
spring not fatal, persists into **summer**,
revives in **long summer**—
**as with the liver’s pattern**.
**Avoid warm foods, overfeeding, damp terrain, and damp garments.**
Warmth, dampness, and overfeeding
all harm **spleen qi**—thus they are **prohibited**.

For those with **spleen disease,**
recovery occurs in **Gēng and Xīn**—
**corresponding to autumn’s energy**.
If **Gēng and Xīn** do not cure, it worsens in **Jiǎ and Yǐ**—
**corresponding to spring’s energy**.
If not fatal in **Jiǎ and Yǐ**, it persists into **Jǐng and Dīng**—
**corresponding to summer’s energy**.
It revives in **Wù and Jǐ**—
**corresponding to long summer**.

*Spleen disease*:
clarity fades at **sunset**,
intensifies at **sunrise**—
*The Newly Corrected Text* notes:
According to *The Canon of Start and Termination*, "sunrise" should read **"dawn"**.
Though sunrise and dawn are temporally equal,
the earlier text, speaking of **Wood’s reign**, always uses **"dawn"**
rather than "sunrise," for sunrise varies in winter and summer,
while **"dawn"** is a fixed standard.
At **midday**, it quiets.

When **Earth reigns**, clarity is **bright yet clear**,
when **Wood conquers**, it **worsens**,
when **Metal assists**, it **calms and retreats**—
this too follows the **resting and reigning principle**.

One erroneous version reads **"midday persists"**—**incorrect**.

Thus, the **five organ diseases** all follow the **cycle of overcoming**:
they worsen at what they **cannot overcome**,
persist at what they **generate**,
and revive when they **return to their proper position**.
Hence, each has **times of remission and severity**,
and fixed **terms of life and death**.

The spleen craves **slowness**—
in urgency, consume **sweet** to **slow it**,
for **sweet’s nature is harmonious and gentle**,
aligning with its **stillness**.
**Use bitter** to relieve,
**sweet** to supplement.
Bitter relieves—**taken for its firm dryness**.
Sweet supplements—**taken for its tranquil ease**.

**When disease is in the lungs,**
recovery occurs in **winter**,
winter uncured, worsens in **summer**,
summer not fatal, persists into **long summer**,
revives in **autumn**—
**as with the liver’s pattern**.
**Avoid cold foods, cold drinks, and cold garments.**
The lungs **abhor cold qi**—thus food and clothing are **prohibited**.
*The Spiritual Pivot* states:
*"Cold exposure and cold drinks injure the lungs."*
Drinks already harm the lungs—**how much more so food!**
The lungs do not **solely abhor cold**; they also **fear heat**.

For those with **lung disease,**
recovery occurs in **Rén and Guǐ**—
**corresponding to winter water**.
If **Rén and Guǐ** do not cure, it worsens in **Jǐng and Dīng**—
**corresponding to summer fire**.
If not fatal in **Jǐng and Dīng**, it persists into **Wù and Jǐ**—
**long summer earth**.
It revives in **Gēng and Xīn**—
**corresponding to autumn metal**.

For those with **lung disease,**
**palpitations** occur at **midday**, **worsening** at noon, **subsiding** at midnight.
When **Metal rules**, palpitations **abate**;
when **Water rules**, they **subside**;
when **Fire rules**, they **worsen**.
The lungs **seek contraction**—
**urgently consume sour** to **contract** them,
for **sourness contracts and consolidates**.
Use **sourness to supplement** and **pungent to vent**.
Sourness **supplements** by contracting;
pungent **vents** by dispersing.

---

For **kidney disease,**
recovery occurs in **Jia and Yi**—
**corresponding to spring wood**.
If **Jia and Yi** do not cure, it worsens in **Wù and Jǐ**—
**long summer earth**.
If not fatal in **Wù and Jǐ**, it persists into **Gēng and Xīn**—
**autumn metal**.
It revives in **Rén and Guǐ**—
**corresponding to winter water**.
**As with the liver’s pattern**.
**Avoid withered, scorched, hot foods, warm roasted meats, and warm garments.**
The kidneys **abhor dryness**—thus these are **prohibited**.
*The Newly Corrected Text* notes:
*"In other editions, 'scorched' is written as 'withered.'"*
**Qīng (青, green)** corresponds to **Cuì (悴, withered)**.
**Huàn (焕, scorched)**—pronounced *Wū-lái*—means **heat and agitation**.
The kidneys **abhor dryness**—thus these are **prohibited**.

For those with **kidney disease,**
**palpitations** occur at **midnight**, **worsening in all seasons**, **subsiding at dawn**.
When **Water rules**, palpitations **abate**;
when **Earth rules**, they **worsen**;
when **Metal rules**, they **subside**.
The kidneys **seek firmness**—
**urgently consume bitter** to **firm** them,
for **bitterness firms and dries**.
Use **bitterness to supplement** and **salty to vent**.
Bitter **supplements** by firming;
salty **vents** by **moistening**—
**moistening**, as **wet earth subdues**.
Thus, **venting is used**.

Now, when **evil qi** invades the body,
it **adds according to its overcoming nature**—
**evil**, meaning **that which is unnatural**.
Wind, cold, heat, dampness, hunger, satiety, labor, and rest—
all are **evil**; not only **ghosts, poisons, epidemics, and plagues**.
When it reaches **what generates it**, it **abates**—
meaning **when it reaches what it generates**.
When it reaches **what it cannot overcome**, it **worsens**—
meaning **when it reaches what overcomes it**.
When it reaches **what it generates**, it **persists**—
meaning **when it reaches what generates it**.
When it **returns to its proper position**, it **revives**—
meaning **when it resides in its governing domain**.
**First, determine the five viscera’s pulses**—
then one may speak of **when it worsens**, or of **life and death**.
The **pulses of the five viscera** are:
**liver—string-like**, **heart—hooked**, **lungs—floating**, **kidneys—winding**, **spleen—slippery**—
thus one may speak of **life, death, and worsening**.

*The Treatise on Three Departments and Nine Lords* states:
*"First, know the regular pulses,
then know the diseased pulses."*
This is what is meant.

For **liver disease,**
pain radiates from the **lower ribs to the lower abdomen**,
causing **easiness to anger**.
The **liver’s Jueyin pulse** ascends from the foot,
circles the genitals,
reaches the lower abdomen,
then ascends through the **liver’s gate (gallbladder region)**,
spreading across the ribs—
thus pain radiates from the **lower ribs to the lower abdomen**.
When its **qi is replete**, one is **easily angered**.
*The Spiritual Pivot* states:
*"When liver qi is replete, anger arises."*
When **depleted**, vision becomes **blurred** (*"brǎng-brǎng"*), hearing **fails**,
and one is **easily frightened**, as if **being pursued**.
The **liver’s Jueyin pulse** travels from the ribs along the throat,
enters the **occiput**, and connects to the **optic nerve**.
The **gallbladder’s Shaoyang pulse** has a branch
that enters the ear from behind,
exits at the ear’s front,
and reaches the **posterior corner of the orbit**—
thus the disease manifests as such.
**Fear** means **terror**, **the spirit’s unrest**.
Take its **channels**—**Jueyin and Shaoyang**—
**channels** meaning **the regular pulses**.
Since it is not a **collateral disease**, take its **channels**.
Take **Jueyin** to regulate **liver qi**,
take **Shaoyang** to adjust **inverted qi**.
Thus, the following states:
When **qi is inverted**, there is **headache, deafness, and swollen cheeks**.
The **liver’s Jueyin pulse** ascends from the **optic nerve**,
exits at the forehead,
and meets the **governing vessel at the crown**—
thus **headache**.
The **gallbladder’s Shaoyang pulse** has a branch
that exits the ear and travels to the **ear’s front**;
another branch reaches the **cheekbone**.
Again, the **Jueyin pulse** has a branch
that descends from the **optic nerve to the cheek**, wrapping around—
thus **deafness, inability to hear, and swollen cheeks**.
Hence, the earlier text **simultaneously takes Shaoyang**.
For **bloodletting**:
If the **pulse is full of blood**, differing from the norm,
it is a sign of **inverted qi**—
**needle the affected side accordingly**.

For **heart disease,**
there is **chest pain**, **rib distension**, **lower rib pain**, **pain in the chest, back, shoulders, and inner arms**,
The **heart’s Shaoyin pulse** has a branch
that travels along the chest and exits the ribs.
Again, the **hand’s Jueyin pulse (Pericardium)** arises in the chest;
its branch also travels along the chest and exits the ribs,
descending three inches below the armpit,
ascending to the **armpit’s underside**,
descending along the **inner arm**, between the **Taiyin and Shaoyin**,
entering the **elbow’s interior**, then descending along the arm between the two tendons.
Again, the **heart’s Shaoyin pulse** has a direct path
that returns from the heart to the lungs,
ascends below the armpit,
descends along the **inner arm’s posterior groove**,
travels behind the **Taiyin and Pericardium**,
enters the **inner elbow**, and reaches the **end of the pisiform bone**.
Again, the **small intestine’s Taiyang pulse** ascends from the arm,
circles the **shoulder blade**, and crosses above the shoulder—
thus the disease manifests as such.
**Burnt (燸)**, pronounced *Rén-zhū*.

When the **Spleen’s virtue/power** is deficient, the chest and abdomen become distended,
and pain draws from the armpit to the waist.
The **hand’s Shaoyin pulse** (of the Pericardium) travels from the chest,
descending to the **lateral costal region** (鬲) and connecting with the **Sanjiao** (Triple Burner).
Its divergent branch follows the chest and exits through the ribs.

The **heart’s Shaoyin pulse** (of the Kidney) descends from the heart,
passing through the **lateral costal region** (鬲) and connecting with the **small intestine**.
Thus, the disease manifests as such.
**Puncture** (取) the **channel’s pulse** (经), specifically the **Shaoyin and Taiyang** (of the hand), and the **blood beneath the tongue**.
The **Shaoyin pulse**, ascending from the heart’s system to the **sides of the throat** (侠咽喉), is why blood is taken from the **root of the tongue** and along the channel.
For its **variant diseases** (变病), puncture the **blood in the "You" point** (邮).
If it changes to **vomiting** (呕), then puncture the **blood-filled Shaoyin "You" point** (邮).
The **hand’s Shaoyin "You"** (邮) lies behind the palm’s pulse,
half an inch from the wrist, aligned with the **little finger’s posterior groove**.

For **Spleen disease**, the body feels heavy,
muscles weaken and atrophy (痿),
the feet cannot be drawn up (足不收),
movement becomes **limp** (善痪),
and there is pain beneath the feet.
The **Spleen’s nature** is **earth**, and it governs **flesh** (肉),
so when deficient, the body feels heavy and muscles atrophy.
**Atrophy** (痿) means **weakness without strength**.
The **Spleen’s Taiyin pulse** arises at the **big toe’s end**,
ascending along the **inner side of the toe**,
passing the **anterior groove of the medial malleolus** (内踝前廉),
and moving up the **inner leg** (踹内).
The **Kidney’s Shaoyin pulse** begins beneath the **little toe**,
slanting toward the **sole of the foot** (足心),
ascending the **inner leg** (揣内),
and emerging along the **posterior groove of the medial malleolus** (蝈内康).
Thus, when the Spleen is diseased,
the feet cannot be drawn up (足不收),
movement becomes **limp** (善痪),
and there is pain beneath the feet.
Hence, **blood is taken from the Taiyin pulse** (少阴).
**Newly corrected text** states:
According to the *Jia-Yi Jing* (《甲乙经》), it reads: **prone to hunger** (善饥), **muscle atrophy**.
The *Qian Jin Fang* (《千金方》) states: **prone to hunger**, **foot atrophy unable to draw up**.
The *Qi Jiao Bian Da Lun* (《气交变大论》) states: **muscle atrophy**, **foot atrophy unable to draw up**, **prone to limpness**.
**Atrophy** (痿), pronounced *Wěi-ní*, is a **damp disease** (湿病), rendering the feet unable to move.
**Limp** (痪), pronounced *Xì* or *Chǐ-zhì*, refers to **childhood weakness**.

When deficient, the abdomen is distended,
the intestines rumble (呜),
**undigested food leaks** (飧泄),
and food is not properly metabolized (食不化).
The **Spleen’s Taiyin pulse** ascends from the **inner thigh** (股内),
entering the abdomen and connecting with the **Spleen and Stomach** (脾络胃).
Thus, the disease manifests as such.
The *Ling Shu Jing* (《灵枢经》) says:
When the **central qi** (中气) is insufficient,
the abdomen becomes **prone to distension** (善满),
and the intestines rumble (善呜).
**Puncture** the **channel’s pulse** (经), specifically the **Taiyin, Yangming, and Shaoyin blood**.
The **Shaoyin pulse** is the **Kidney’s channel** (肾脉).
Since the earlier disease was **prone to limpness** and **pain beneath the feet**,
blood is taken from it.
Blood is taken when it is **full** (满).

For **Lung disease**, there is **wheezing** (喘),
**coughing** (咳),
**reverse flow of breath** (逆气),
shoulder and back pain,
**Newly corrected text** states:
According to the *Qian Jin Fang* (《千金方》), it reads: **shoulder stiffness** (肩息) and **back pain**.
**Sweating** (汗出),
**numbness of the lips** (尸阴),
**pain in the knee and thigh** (股膝),
and the **sole of the foot, inner leg, and heel** (牌踹腑足) all ache.
The **Lung’s nature** is **metal**, governing **respiration** (喘息).
When it shifts to **coughing** (咳), the disease presents as **wheezing, coughing, and reverse breath**.
The **back** is the **chest’s repository** (府),
and the **shoulder** is adjacent to it,
so shoulder and back pain occur.
The **Lung nourishes skin and hair** (皮毛),
and when **pathogenic forces** (邪) prevail,
**heart fluids leak outward** (心液外泄),
causing **sweating**.
The **Kidney’s Shaoyin pulse** ascends from the foot,
following the **inner leg** (踹内),
emerging along the **posterior groove of the medial malleolus** (胭内康),
and moving up the **inner thigh’s posterior groove** (股内后康),
piercing the **spine** (贯脊) and connecting with the **Kidney**, linking to the **Bladder**.
When the **Lung is diseased**, the **lip pulse** (唇脉) is affected by **pathogenic forces**,
so there is **numbness of the lips, pain in the knee and thigh, sole of the foot, inner leg, and heel**.
Thus, **blood is taken from the Shaoyin pulse** (少阴).

When deficient, there is **shortness of breath** (少气),
unable to **respond to inhalation** (不能报息),
**deafness** (耳聋),
and **numbness of the lips** (嗑乾).
The **qi is weak and scarce** (气虚少),
so it is insufficient to **respond to incoming breath**.
The **Lung’s Taiyin network** (络) converges in the **ear** (耳中),
so **deafness** occurs.
The **Kidney’s Shaoyin pulse** ascends from the **Kidney**,
piercing the **liver’s lateral costal region** (鬲),
entering the **Lung** (肺中),
and ascending the **throat**, alongside the **root of the tongue**.
When the **Lung is deficient**, the **Kidney’s qi** is insufficient to **moisten the throat** (以上润於哑),
so **numbness of the lips** occurs.
Thus, the **following text** also takes blood from the **Shaoyin pulse**.
**Puncture** the **channel’s pulse** (经), specifically the **Taiyin, foot’s Taiyang exterior, and Shaoyin interior blood**.
The **foot’s Taiyang exterior and Shaoyin interior** refers to the **direct upward path** from the **inner side of the big toe** and the **posterior groove of the medial malleolus**—
this is the **Shaoyin pulse**.
Observe the **left and right foot’s Shaoyin sections** for **blood fullness** (血满) differing from the norm,
and **puncture it immediately**.

For **Kidney disease**, the abdomen is distended,
the **channels are swollen** (经肿),
**Newly corrected text** states:
According to the *Jia-Yi Jing* (《甲乙经》), it reads: **channels are swollen and painful**.
There is **wheezing, coughing, body heaviness**,
**night sweats** (寝汗),
**aversion to wind** (憎风),
and **cold extremities**.
The **Kidney’s Shaoyin pulse** arises from the foot,
ascending along the **inner leg** (踹内),
passing through the **horizontal bone** (横骨),
and alongside the **navel** (齐),
moving upward through the **abdominal region** (腹裹),
entering the **Lung** (肺).
Thus, the abdomen becomes distended,
the **channels are swollen**,
and there is **wheezing and coughing**.
When the **Kidney is diseased**, the **bones cannot function**,
so the body feels heavy.
**Pathogenic forces** attack the **Lung**,
**heart qi weakens internally** (心气内微),
and **heart fluids become sweat** (心液为汗),
causing **night sweats**.
Since the **channels are swollen**,
**sweat further leaks** (汗复津泄),
**yin stagnates in the hidden repository** (阴凝玄府),
and **yang scatters in the upper burner** (阳烁上焦).
**Internal heat and external cold** arise,
so there is **aversion to wind**.
**Aversion to wind** means **deeply detesting it**.
When deficient, there is **pain in the chest**,
**pain in the large and small intestines** (大腹小腹),
and **unsettled emotions** (清厥意不乐).
The **Kidney’s Shaoyin pulse** (豚) emerges from the **Lung**,
connecting with the **heart** and converging in the chest.
When the **Kidney’s qi is deficient**,
the **heart lacks regulation** (心无所制),
**heart qi relies on the Lung** (心气需肺),
so pain gathers in the chest.
The **foot’s Taiyang pulse** (豚) descends from the **nape** (项下),
reaching the foot.
When the **Kidney is deficient**, the **Taiyang’s qi** cannot **flourish in the foot**,
so the **foot’s qi is limp** (足玲),
and **breath reverses** (气逆).
**Limpness** (清) means **weak and limp qi**.
**Reverse breath** (厥) means **inverted qi**.
Since the **qi is weak and limp** and **breath reverses**,
there is pain in the **large and small intestines**.
When **emotional balance is lacking** (志不足),
the **spirit becomes restless** (神躁扰),
so there is **unsettledness**.
**Newly corrected text** states:
According to the *Jia-Yi Jing* (《甲乙经》), **large and small intestines** (大腹小腹) should read **large and small intestines** (大肠小肠).
**Puncture** the **channel’s pulse** (经), specifically the **Shaoyin and Taiyang blood**.

The **principles of acupuncture** (几刺之道) are:
When deficient, **supplement it** (补之),
when **excessive**, **drain it** (写之).
When neither deficient nor excessive,
**puncture along the channel** (以经取之).
This is called **attaining the Dao/Way**.
If the **channels and networks contain blood** (经络有血),
**puncture and remove it** (刺而去之).
This is called **upholding the law** (守法).

One must first **assess the body’s form** and **determine the state of qi**, then **remove the blood** from the vessels before **balancing excess and deficiency**.

The *Sanbu Jiuhou Lun* (《三部九候论》) states:
*"First, measure the body’s fatness and thinness to regulate the deficiency or excess of qi. If excess, drain it; if deficient, supplement it. First remove the blood stagnation, then adjust it."* This is precisely what is meant.

The liver’s color is green; it should be fed **sweet** foods—**glutinous rice, beef, dates, and gourd**—all of which are sweet. The liver’s nature is prone to **urgency**, so sweet foods are taken to **soothe and relax** it.
**Newly corrected text** states: See the section on the liver’s green color to the end of the passage; the full text in the *Quan Yuan Qi* edition is in Volume Six, but Wang [the annotator] moved it here.

The heart’s color is red; it should be fed **sour** foods—**adzuki beans** (**Newly corrected text**: According to the *Jia-Yi Jing* and *Tai Su*, adzuki beans are written as *má* [hemp]), **dog meat, plums, and leeks**—all of which are sour. The heart’s nature is prone to **sluggishness**, so sour foods are taken to **contract and consolidate** it.

The lungs’ color is white; they should be fed **bitter** foods—**barley, mutton, and indigo**—all of which are bitter. The lungs are prone to **inverted qi**, so bitter foods are taken to **dispel and drain** them.

The spleen’s color is yellow; it should be fed **salty** foods—**soybeans, pork, chestnuts, and radishes**—all of which are salty. Examining these dietary correspondences reveals the principle of **adjusting and harmonizing the pivotal mechanisms**.

The kidneys govern the **stomach’s gate**, and the spleen is paired with the stomach, so **salty, soft, and moistening** foods are used to **facilitate its function**. When the gate is unobstructed, stomach qi flows, and when the stomach moves, spleen qi transforms accordingly—thus, the spleen’s dietary preference differs from the others.
**Newly corrected text** states: Referring to the earlier text:
*"The liver suffers from urgency; urgently feed sweet to relax it.
The heart suffers from sluggishness; urgently feed sour to contract it.
The spleen suffers from dampness; urgently feed bitter to dry it.
The lungs suffer from inverted qi; urgently feed bitter to drain it.
The kidneys suffer from dryness; urgently feed pungent to moisten it."*
Here, the dietary recommendations for the liver, heart, lungs, and kidneys align with the earlier passage, except for the spleen, which should be fed salty rather than bitter—thus, Wang [the annotator] specially explains its meaning.

The kidneys’ color is black; they should be fed **pungent** foods—**yellow millet, pheasant meat, peaches, and onions**—all of which are pungent. The kidneys’ nature is prone to **dryness**, so pungent foods are taken to **moisten and nourish** them.

Pungent **disperses**, sour **contracts**, sweet **relaxes**, bitter **fortifies**, and salty **softens**. These are the **natural properties of qi**.
Yet pungent and bitter flavors are not merely for **dispersion and fortification**. Pungent can also **moisten and disperse**, while bitter can also **dry and drain**—thus, the earlier passage states:
*"The spleen suffers from dampness; urgently feed bitter to dry it,
The lungs suffer from inverted qi; urgently feed bitter to drain it,"*
referring to the **drying and draining** effects of bitter.
It also states:
*"The kidneys suffer from dryness; urgently feed pungent to moisten it,"*
referring to the **moistening** effect of pungent.
*Delü* (奕) is pronounced *ruǎn* (soft).

**Toxic medicines dispel evil**—
Medicines, including **metals, gems, earth, stones, herbs, trees, vegetables, fruits, insects, fish, and birds/beasts**, are all capable of **dispersing evil and nourishing the true** (正).
Yet only **toxic medicines** can effectively **repel evil and stabilize the true**, and because they can do so, they are universally called *toxic medicines*.
**Newly corrected text** states: According to the *Ben Cao* (《本草》), *"Lower-grade medicines are assistants; they treat diseases in accordance with the earth’s influence, are often toxic, and should not be taken long-term. They are used to eliminate cold and heat, dispel evil qi, break stagnations, and cure diseases."* Hence, it is said that **toxic medicines dispel evil**.

**The Five Grains nourish**—glutinous rice, adzuki beans, barley, soybeans, and yellow millet.
**The Five Fruits assist**—peaches, plums, apricots, chestnuts, and dates.
**The Five Livestock benefit**—cattle, sheep, pigs, dogs, and falcons.
**The Five Vegetables fulfill**—gourds, radishes, *peng* (蓬, possibly *Cynanchum*), onions, and leeks.
**Newly corrected text** states: The *Wuchang Zhengda Lun* (《五常政大论》) says:
*"Greatly toxic medicines cure disease, removing six out of ten ailments.
Moderately toxic medicines cure disease, removing seven out of ten ailments.
Slightly toxic medicines cure disease, removing eight out of ten ailments.
Non-toxic medicines cure disease, removing nine out of ten ailments.
Foods of grain, meat, fruit, and vegetables—when fully consumed—should not be overused, lest they harm the true (正)."*

When **qi and flavor are harmonized and taken together**, they **supplement essence and strengthen qi**.
Qi refers to **yang transformation**, while flavor refers to **yin application**. When qi and flavor are harmonized, they **nourish essence and vital energy**.
The *Yin-Yang Yingxiang Da Lun* (《阴阳应象大论》) states:
*"Yang is qi, yin is flavor. Flavor nourishes form, form nourishes qi, qi nourishes essence, and essence transforms. Essence consumes qi, form consumes flavor."*
It also states:
*"When form is deficient, warm it with qi.
When essence is deficient, supplement it with flavor."*
Thus, the principle of **supplementing essence and strengthening qi** becomes clear.
**Newly corrected text** states: Sun Simiao (孙思邈) said:
*"Essence consumes qi, and qi nourishes essence to brighten the complexion.
Form consumes flavor, and flavor nourishes form to generate strength.
Essence follows the Five Qi to become spirit—if consumed improperly, it harms essence.
Form receives flavor to solidify—if flavor is unbalanced, it damages form.
Thus, the Sage first uses dietary prohibitions to preserve nature, then prescribes medicines to safeguard life.
Qi and flavor, when warm and supplementing, preserve essence and form."*
This is what is meant by **harmonizing qi and flavor to supplement essence and strengthen qi**.

These five categories—**pungent, sour, sweet, bitter, and salty**—each have their uses: some **dispel**, some **contract**, some **relax**, some **urgently act**, some **fortify**, and some **soften**. They correspond to the **Four Seasons and Five Viscera**, and diseases follow the appropriate flavors.
Using the **Five Flavors to regulate the Five Viscera**—pairing the liver with sweet, the heart with sour, the spleen with salty, the lungs with bitter, and the kidneys with pungent—each is applied as needed, whether to **relax, contract, moisten, drain, disperse, or fortify**. This is not for the purpose of **mutual generation and nourishment**, but for **functional application**.

**Title of the Sutra:** *Huangdi Neijing Suwen* Supplementary Commentary.

*The Huangdi Neijing Suwen* is a pre-Qin composition of unknown authorship, annotated by Tang Dynasty official Wang Bing, the *Taipu Ling* (太仆令) and *Qǐxuán Zǐ* (启玄子). The annotations were later verified by Song Dynasty officials Lin Yi (林亿) and others, with the title *Song Shǒushàngshū Tún Tián Láng* (宋守尚书屯田郎). The text was reexamined and erroneous readings corrected by Sun Zhao (孙兆).

**The Five Flavors and Their Corresponding Organs:**
The five flavors enter as follows:
Acid enters the liver—*the liver corresponds to wood and thus absorbs the flavor of acid*.
Pungent enters the lungs—*the lungs correspond to metal and thus absorb the flavor of pungent*.
Bitter enters the heart—*the heart corresponds to fire and thus absorbs the flavor of bitter*.
Salty enters the kidneys—*the kidneys correspond to water and thus absorb the flavor of salty*.
Sweet enters the spleen—*the spleen corresponds to earth and thus absorbs the flavor of sweet*.
*Newly corrected annotation:* According to the *Taipu* edition, it further states: *Mild enters the stomach*. This is called the "Five Entries."
*Newly corrected annotation:* According to the *Zhizhen Yaodalu* (至真要大论), it states: *The five flavors enter the stomach, each returning to what they favor. Thus, acid first enters the liver, bitter first enters the heart, sweet first enters the spleen, pungent first enters the lungs, and salty first enters the kidneys.*

**The Five Diseases of the Organs:**
The heart manifests as *sighing*—*it resembles fire blazing upward, and the sigh follows the flames. The heart does not endure filth, hence the sigh emerges.*
The lungs manifest as *coughing*—*they resemble metal’s firmness and strength; when struck, they produce sound. Evil *qi* strikes the lungs, hence the cough.*
*Cough:* pronounced as *kǔ* (苦盖切).
The liver manifests as *speech*—*it resembles wood’s branching tendrils, which are flexible and divergent. Speech should be yielding and indirect, hence it arises from the liver.*
The spleen manifests as *swallowing*—*it resembles earth’s capacity to contain and embrace; all things return inward, and its gathering nature accepts everything, hence the swallowing.*
*Gathering:* pronounced as *xī* (吸).
The kidneys manifest as *yawning* and *sneezing*—*they resemble water flowing downward, generating mist and clouds above. When *qi* stagnates in the stomach, yawning arises. The *Taiyang* *qi* harmonizes and flourishes, filling the heart, and when it emerges from the nose, it produces a sneeze.*
*Sneeze:* pronounced as *dì* (帝).
The stomach manifests as *reverse *qi* (gastric inversion), *hiccough*, and *fear*—*it is the sea of water and grain, and the kidneys serve as its gate. When the gate is closed and does not function smoothly, *qi* reverses and ascends. Because the stomach embraces water and grain and favors cold, the cold and grain *qi* clash, hence the hiccough. When cold is excessive, hiccoughs arise; when heat is excessive, fear emerges. Why? Heat in the stomach weakens kidney *qi*, hence the fear. The following passage states: *When the vital *qi* converges in the kidneys, fear arises.*
*Hiccough:* pronounced as *wù* (呼会切), resembling a bird’s cry.

The large and small intestines manifest as *diarrhea*—*the lower burner overflows as water. The large intestine is the repository of the Dao’s transmission, and the small intestine is the repository of what is received. When the *qi* of what is received is depleted, the transmission’s regulation fails, hence diarrhea occurs. The lower burner is where division and distribution take place; when *qi* is obstructed and cannot be expelled, it overflows as water.*
*Obstructed:* pronounced as *pí* (陂栗切).

The bladder, when not functioning smoothly, manifests as *□* (unclear term) and *incontinence*—*the bladder is the repository of fluids, and water is distributed through it. If the pulses of the foot *Sanjiao* are replete, it restrains the lower burner and prevents passage, hence no urination occurs. If the pulses of the foot *Sanjiao* are depleted, it fails to restrain the lower burner, hence incontinence arises.*
*The Ling Shu Jing* (灵枢经) states: *The foot Sanjiao is the branch of the Taiyang meridian. Together with the Taiyang’s main meridian, it connects with the bladder’s network, restraining the lower burner. When replete, it closes and blocks the □ (unclear term); when depleted, it causes incontinence.*

The gallbladder manifests as *anger*—*it is upright yet decisive, without partiality or bias, and its nature is strong yet restrained, hence the emergence of anger.*
*The Liu Jie Zangxiang Lun* (六节藏象论) states: *The gallbladder holds the central position among the eleven organs.*
This is called the "Five Diseases."

**The Five Convergences of the Essences:**
When the vital *qi* converges in the heart, it produces *joy*—*the vital *qi* refers to the essence of fire. When the lungs are depleted and the heart’s essence converges with them, it results in joy.*
*The Ling Shu Jing* (灵枢经) states: *Excessive joy and delight harm the *po* (魄).*
*The *po* is the spirit of the lungs, clarifying how the heart’s fire essence converges with the lungs’ metal essence.*

When it converges in the lungs, it produces *sadness*—*when the liver is depleted and the lungs’ *qi* converges with it, it results in sadness.*
*The Ling Shu Jing* (灵枢经) states: *Sorrow and grief disturbing the center harm the *hun* (魂).*
*The *hun* is the spirit of the liver, clarifying how the lungs’ metal essence converges with the liver’s wood essence.*

When it converges in the liver, it produces *worry*—*when the spleen is depleted and the liver’s *qi* converges with it, it results in worry.*
*The Ling Shu Jing* (灵枢经) states: *Persistent anxiety and melancholy harm the *yi* (意).*
*The *yi* is the spirit of the spleen, clarifying how the liver’s wood essence converges with the spleen’s earth essence.*
*When it converges in the spleen, it produces *fear*—*the original text states *hunger* (饥). When the kidneys are depleted and the spleen’s *qi* converges with them, it results in fear.*
*Fear:* meaning *fear and trepidation.*
*The Ling Shu Jing* (灵枢经) states: *Persistent fear and dread harm the *jing* (精).*
*The *jing* is the spirit of the kidneys, clarifying how the spleen’s earth essence converges with the kidneys’ water essence.*

When it converges in the kidneys, it produces *fear*—*when the heart is depleted and the kidneys’ *qi* converges with it, it results in fear.*
*The Ling Shu Jing* (灵枢经) states: *Restlessness, vigilance, and excessive thought harm the *shen* (神).*
*The *shen* is the master of the heart, clarifying how the kidneys’ water essence converges with the heart’s fire essence.*
*Restlessness and vigilance:* meaning *startled and fearful.*
These are all instances where the *shen* (正气) is insufficient, and the *victorious qi* (胜气) converges with it, thus resulting in these conditions. Hence, the following passage states: *This is called the "Five Convergences," where depletion leads to convergence.*

**The Five Detestations of the Organs:**
The heart detests heat—*heat causes the vessels to become turbid and sluggish.*
The lungs detest cold—*cold causes *qi* to stagnate.*
The liver detests wind—*wind causes the sinews to wither and contract.*
The spleen detests dampness—*dampness causes the flesh to slacken and swell.*
The kidneys detest dryness—*dryness causes the *jing* (精) to be exhausted and depleted.*
*Newly corrected annotation:* According to Yang Shangshan (杨上善), it states: *If we follow today’s conventions, it would read: "the lungs detest dryness." However, here it states "the lungs detest cold," and "the kidneys detest dryness," because dryness occurs at the beginning of autumn and cold at the end of winter. The lungs are associated with autumn, and since they greatly detest cold, it is stated as its end. The kidneys are associated with winter, and since they do not greatly detest dryness, it is stated as its beginning.*
This is called the "Five Detestations."

**The Five Transformations of Fluids:**
The heart generates *sweat*—*it drains through the skin.*
The lungs generate *nasal mucus*—*they moisten the nasal passages.*
The liver generates *tears*—*they flow into the eyes.*
The spleen generates *saliva*—*it overflows from the lips and mouth.*
The kidneys generate *saliva*—*it arises from the teeth.*
This is called the "Five Fluids."

**The Five Prohibitions of the Flavors:**
Pungent *qi* disperses *qi*—*when *qi* is diseased and weak, one should not consume excessive pungent flavors;*
*Diseased:* meaning *weakness that cannot overcome itself.*

「Bitter *qi* disperses blood—when blood is diseased, one should not consume excessive bitter flavors;
Salt *qi* disperses bone—when bone is diseased, one should not consume excessive salt;
*The Newly Corrected Edition* states: According to Huangfu Shian, salt first disperses the kidneys.
Here, "disperses blood" means that since the kidneys correspond to the Triple Burner, though blood vessels belong to the liver and heart, they follow the path of the middle burner, hence salt enters and disperses blood.
Bitter disperses the heart—here, "disperses bone" means that water and fire mutually assist, and bone-*qi* communicates with the heart.

Sweet disperses flesh—when flesh is diseased, one should not consume excessive sweetness;
Sour disperses sinews—when sinews are diseased, one should not consume excessive sourness.

All these are for accelerating *qi* movement, hence one should not consume too much.
Excessive consumption worsens the disease, so the diseased should not consume too much.
This is called the "Five Prohibitions," forbidding excessive intake.

*The Newly Corrected Edition* states: According to *The Great Essentials* (*Tai Su*), the Five Prohibitions are:
Liver disease prohibits pungent,
Heart disease prohibits salty,
Spleen disease prohibits sour,
Lung disease prohibits bitter,
Kidney disease prohibits sweet—
this is called the "Five Censorships."
Yang Shangshan says: When the mouth craves and one eats or drinks excessively, the *yarrow* stalks themselves censure it—this is called the Five Censorships.

**The Five Manifestations of Disease:**
Yin-diseases manifest in bone,
Yang-diseases manifest in blood,
Yin-diseases manifest in flesh—
Bone and flesh belong to yin and are tranquil, so yang-*qi* follows them.
Blood belongs to yang and is dynamic, so yin-*qi* seizes it.

Yang-diseases manifest in winter,
Yin-diseases manifest in summer—
Summer’s yang-*qi* is abundant, so yin-diseases manifest in summer.
Winter’s yin-*qi* is abundant, so yang-diseases manifest in winter.
Each follows its deficiency.
This is called the "Five Manifestations."

**The Five Disruptions by Evil:**
Evil entering yang causes madness;
Evil entering yin causes numbness.
Evil residing in yang’s vessels causes limbs to burn fiercely, hence madness.
Evil entering yin’s vessels causes the six channels to congeal and stagnate, hence numbness.
*Dì* (涩), pronounced *sè* (stiffness).

Striking yang causes vertigo—
Evil internally striking yang causes thin, rapid pulses, hence upper vertigo.
Striking yin causes [missing character]—
Evil internally striking yin causes pulses that do not flow, hence emaciation and inability to speak.

*The Newly Corrected Edition* states: According to *The Difficult Classic* (*Nan Jing*), excessive yang causes madness, excessive yin causes epilepsy.
Cao Yuanfang says: Evil entering yin causes epilepsy.
*The Pulse Classic* (*Mai Jing*) says: Yin adhering to yang causes madness, yang adhering to yin causes epilepsy.
Sun Simiao says: Evil entering yang causes madness, evil entering yin causes blood numbness; evil transmitted through yang causes epilepsy and tetany, evil transmitted through yin causes pain and emaciation.
Quan Yuanqi says: Once evil has entered yin and is transmitted to yang, with evil-*qi* flourishing and the viscera receiving evil, it causes loss of appetite, and the nourishing-*qi* fails to circulate through the body. Evil and righteous-*qi* clash, erupting as epilepsy.
Once evil has entered yang and is transmitted to yin, the viscera receive evil, hence inability to speak—this is the victory of evil over righteousness.
The theories of all schools differ; now they are all recorded.

When yang enters yin, it becomes tranquil;
When yin exits to yang, it becomes angry.
Disease follows where it goes.
*Zhī* (之), meaning "to go."

*The Newly Corrected Edition* states: According to Quan Yuanqi, yang entering yin causes tranquility, exiting causes fear.
*The Thousand-Gold Prescriptions* (*Qian Jin Fang*) says: Evil entering yin causes tranquility, yin exiting to yang causes anger.
This is called the "Five Disruptions."

**The Five Manifestations of Evil:**
Spring with autumn pulses,
Summer with winter pulses,
Late summer with spring pulses,
Autumn with summer pulses,
Winter with late summer pulses—
this is called "yin exiting to yang," where the disease is prone to anger and incurable.
This is called the "Five Evils," all sharing the same fate—death is inevitable.

*The Newly Corrected Edition* states: Yin exiting to yang causes anger, as seen earlier; this repetition disrupts the text’s logic—likely an error in ancient collation.

**What the Five Viscera Store:**
The heart stores *shén*—the transformation of vital essence and *qi*.
*The Spiritual Pivot* (*Ling Shu*) says: The convergence of two essences is called *shén*.
The lungs store *pò*—the auxiliary essence and *qi*.
*The Spiritual Pivot* says: The simultaneous inflow and outflow of essence is called *pò*.
The liver stores *hún*—the assistant to spiritual *qi*.
*The Spiritual Pivot* says: What follows *shén* in movement is called *hún*.
The spleen stores *yì*—memory without forgetting.
*The Spiritual Pivot* says: When the heart recalls, it is called *yì*.
The kidneys store *zhì*—focused intent without distraction.
*The Spiritual Pivot* says: Where intent resides is called *zhì*.
The kidneys receive the essence of the five viscera and six bowels, the root of original *qi*, and the foundation of life—acting as the gate for the stomach. Thus, *zhì* governs life’s continuity.

*The Newly Corrected Edition* states: According to Yang Shangshan, the kidneys consist of two parts: the left is the kidney, storing *zhì*; the right is the *Mingmen* (Gate of Life), storing essence.
This is called the "Five Viscera’s Stores."

**What the Five Viscera Govern:**
The heart governs the vessels—
It regulates nourishing-*qi*, moving with each breath.
The lungs govern the skin—
They envelop the front flesh, blocking all evils.
The liver governs the sinews—
They connect the joints, moving with the spirit.
The spleen governs the flesh—
The kidneys govern the bones—
The spleen governs flesh, covering and protecting sinews and bones, circulating defensive-*qi*.
The kidneys govern bones—
They stretch sinews, transform marrow, and support the body upright.
This is called the "Five Governances."

**The Five Exhaustions:**
Prolonged viewing harms blood—
Exhausting the heart.
Prolonged exposure harms *qi*—
Exhausting the lungs.
Prolonged sitting harms flesh,
Prolonged standing harms bones,
Prolonged walking harms sinews—
Prolonged sitting harms flesh—exhausting the spleen.
Prolonged standing harms bones—exhausting the kidneys.
Prolonged walking harms sinews—exhausting the liver.
This is called the "Five Exhaustions."

**The Five Pulses Corresponding to Symbols:**
The liver pulse is *xuán* (string-like)—
Deep, hollow, and slippery, straight and long.
The heart pulse is *gōu* (hooked)—
Like a hook lying down, strong on arrival, weak on departure.»

**The Five Viscera’s Pulses:**
The spleen pulse is *dài* (intermittent)—
Deep and weak.
The lung pulse is *máo* (downy)—
Light, floating, and hollow, like feathers.
The kidney pulse is *shí* (stony)—
Firm and forceful, like a stone cast.

This is called the **"Five Viscera’s Pulses."**

**The Blood, Qi, Form, and Will Section**
The natural constants of humankind:
The *Taiyang* [foot] channel is always abundant in blood and scarce in *qi*.
The *Shaoyang* [foot] channel is always scarce in blood and abundant in *qi*.
The *Yangming* [foot] channel is always abundant in *qi* and blood.
The *Shaoyin* [foot] channel is always scarce in blood and abundant in *qi*.
The *Jueyin* [foot] channel is always abundant in blood and scarce in *qi*.
The *Taiyin* [foot] channel is always abundant in *qi* and scarce in blood.
This is the **Heaven’s constant measure**.
The abundance or scarcity of blood and *qi*—this is Heaven’s constant measure.

Thus, the **Dao of Needling** always follows the principle of **reducing the excess**.

---
**Newly Corrected Version:**
According to the *Jia-Yi Jing*’s *"Twelve Channel Waters"*:
- *Yangming* (abundant blood and *qi*)—needle to a depth of **four *cù* (分)**, retain for **ten breaths**.
- *Taiyang* (abundant blood and *qi*)—needle to a depth of **five *cù* (分)**, retain for **seven breaths**.
- *Shaoyang* (scarce blood, abundant *qi*)—needle to a depth of **four *cù* (分)**, retain for **five breaths**.
- *Taiyin* (abundant blood, scarce *qi*)—needle to a depth of **three *cù* (分)**, retain for **four breaths**.
- *Shaoyin* (scarce blood, abundant *qi*)—needle to a depth of **two *cù* (分)**, retain for **three breaths**.
- *Jueyin* (abundant blood, scarce *qi*)—needle to a depth of **one *cù* (分)**, retain for **two breaths**.

The *Taiyang* and *Taiyin* channels’ blood and *qi* measures differ from the *Su Wen*.
Yet the *"Twenty-Five Physiognomies of Yin-Yang"* aligns with the *Su Wen*.
Huangfu Cong [皇甫謇] doubted and preserved both accounts.

---
**The Yin-Yang Pairings of the Hands and Feet:**
The *foot Taiyang* and *Shaoyin* are exterior-interior.
The *foot Shaoyang* and *Jueyin* are exterior-interior.
The *foot Yangming* and *Taiyin* are exterior-interior—
This is the **foot’s Yin-Yang**.

The *hand Taiyang* and *Shaoyin* are exterior-interior.
The *hand Shaoyang* and *heart channel* are exterior-interior.
The *hand Yangming* and *Taiyin* are exterior-interior—
This is the **hand’s Yin-Yang**.

Now, knowing the Yin-Yang afflictions of the hands and feet,
**In treating disease, one must first reduce the blood**,
Then address the suffering,
Observe the patient’s desires,
And only then **reduce the excess and supplement the deficient**.

*"First reduce the blood"* means:
When the blood vessels appear unusually full and distinct from the norm, then reduce them.
It does not mean that needling always begins by reducing the blood.

---
**Locating the Back Shu Points:**
First, measure the distance between the two nipples.
Fold it in half, then subtract half again.
The two remaining corners are used as a guide—
Hold them upright and apply to the back,
With one corner at the top aligned with the **Dàzhuī (大椎)**,
The two lower corners marking the **lung’s shu point** below.

*"Measure"* means to use grass to gauge the nipple span,
Removing a quarter, making the diagonal equal to the horizontal,
Folding into three corners—
When the upper corner aligns with the **Dàzhuī (大椎)**,
The lower corners mark the **lung’s shu point**.

*"Schù"* (拄) is pronounced *"zhù"* (俞).

Move downward one degree—this is the **heart’s shu point**.
That is, align the upper corner with the **third vertebra**.
Move downward one degree—
The left corner is the **liver’s shu point**,
The right corner is the **spleen’s shu point**.
Move downward one degree—this is the **kidney’s shu point**.

This is called the **"Five Viscera’s Shu Points"** and the **degrees for moxibustion and needling**.

The *Ling Shu Jing* and *Zhong Yue* both state:
- The **lung’s shu point** is beside the **third vertebra**,
- The **heart’s shu point** is beside the **fifth vertebra**,
- The **liver’s shu point** is beside the **ninth vertebra**,
- The **spleen’s shu point** is beside the **eleventh vertebra**,
- The **kidney’s shu point** is beside the **fourteenth vertebra**.

Examining this text’s grass-measuring method:
For an average person,
The first measurement’s lower corners roughly align with the **lung’s shu point**,
The second measurement’s lower corners roughly align with the **heart’s shu point**,
The third measurement’s lower corners roughly align with the **seventh vertebra**—
Beside the seventh vertebra lies the **Ge shu (鬲俞)**.

This text states:
*"The left corner is the liver’s shu point, the right corner is the spleen’s shu point,"*
Which differs from the *Zhong Yue* and other classics.
The fourth measurement’s lower corners roughly align with the **ninth vertebra**—
Beside the ninth vertebra lies the **liver’s shu point**.
The text mentions the **kidney’s shu point** but does not clarify its source.

---
**Form at Ease, Will in Distress—Disease Arises in the Pulses, Treated by Moxibustion and Needling.**
*"Form"* refers to the body’s physique.
*"Will"* refers to the mind’s intentions.
In detail, the **Seven Spirits** each govern their own domain;
In broad terms, they are categorized by **form and will** as interior and exterior.

*"Form at ease"* means not overburdening oneself with labor.
*"Will in distress"* means deep rumination and excessive thought.
Not overburdening oneself keeps sinews and bones harmonized;
Deep rumination and excessive thought disrupt the **honor and defense**, causing *qi* and blood to stagnate—
Thus, disease arises in the pulses.

The **principles of reducing excess and supplementing deficiency** are the **Dao of moxibustion and needling**.
Yet one must first reduce the **blood vessels** before regulating them—
Hence the earlier text states:
*"In treating disease, first reduce the blood, then address the suffering,
Observe the patient’s desires,
And only then reduce the excess and supplement the deficient."*

When **form and will are both at ease**, disease arises in the **flesh**,
And is treated with **needle and stone**.

「*"Will at ease"* means joyful and unrestrained, forgetting one’s worries.
Yet when sinews and bones are not labored, the mind and spirit are joyful and unrestrained,
Then the flesh’s pores align harmoniously, the **Dao of *qi*** overflows and fills,
The **defensive *qi*** becomes congested and knotted—
Thus, disease arises in the **flesh**.

The **defensive *qi*’s** lingering stagnation is treated with **needling to reduce** it;
Knotted **pus and blood** are broken with **stone needle**—
*Stone needle*, meaning the **lancing stone needle** (砭石).
Now it is also replaced with **external needles**.

*Trang* (锋), pronounced *bì* (铍).

*"Form in distress, will at ease"*—disease arises in the **sinews**, treated with **moxibustion and Daoist exercises**.
*Form in distress* means engaging in **scholarly or laborious pursuits**.
Yet when one overdoes scholarly or physical labor,
Exceeding proper measure, it leads to **exhaustion and injury**—
Exhaustion from labor then gives rise to injury, hence disease arises in the **sinews**.

*Moxibustion* refers to **herbal moxibustion** (药熨).
*Daoist exercises* means **guided stretching and movement** (导引).

*"Form in distress, will in distress"*—disease arises in **throat constriction and hoarseness** (咽隘),
And is treated with **various medicines** (百药).
When one engages in excessive labor and deep rumination,
Worry causes **liver *qi*** to merge with the **spleen**,
The liver and gallbladder unite,
And the throat becomes its conduit—
Thus, disease arises in **throat constriction**.

The *Sutra of the Five *Qi* of Manifestation* (《宣明五气篇》) states:
*"When vital essence and *qi* merge in the liver, one falls into worry."*

The *Treatise on Strange Diseases* (《奇病论》) says:
*"The liver is the general of the central body,
Its decisions hinge on the gallbladder,
And the throat serves as its messenger."*

○ Newly corrected text states:
*"According to the *Jia Yi Jing* (《甲乙经》), throat hoarseness (咽哑) is written as *困竭*, and various medicines (百药) as *sweet medicines* (甘药)."*

*"Form repeatedly shocked by fear"*—when the **meridians and vessels** are obstructed,
Disease arises in **numbness or insensitivity** (不仁),
And is treated with **massage and alcoholic medicines**.

Fear causes **pulse *qi*** to surge,
Terror scatters the **spirit**—
When pulse *qi* surges and the spirit wanders,
The **meridians and vessels** become obstructed,
And **numbness or insensitivity** ensues.

**Massage** serves to open and unblock obstructions,
Guiding the **yin and yang** to flow.
**Alcoholic medicines** nourish the **upright *qi* and expel evil**,
Balancing the **center and harmonizing *qi***—
Thus, their application is fitting.

*Alcoholic medicines* refer to **medicinal wine** (醪药).
*Numbness or insensitivity* means **impaired responsiveness**, whether to touch or function—
Then **aching, numbness, or paralysis** (□痛痹) follows.

This completes the **Five Forms of Will** (五形志).

When needling the **Yangming meridian**, release **blood and *qi***;
When needling the **Taiyang meridian**, release **blood and evil *qi***;
When needling the **Shaoyang meridian**, release **evil *qi* and blood**;
When needling the **Taiyin meridian**, release **evil *qi* and blood**;
When needling the **Shaoyin meridian**, release **evil *qi* and blood**;
When needling the **Jueyin meridian**, release **blood and evil *qi***.

This clarifies the **three meridians of Yang** and **three of Yin** regarding the varying amounts of **blood and *qi*** to be released by needling.

○ Newly corrected text states:
*"According to the *Tai Su* (《太素》), needling the Yangming meridian releases **blood and *qi***, and needling the Taiyin meridian also releases **blood and *qi***.
Yang Shangxian’s annotation says:
*'Though Yangming and Taiyin are superficial pathways, their **blood and *qi*** are both abundant, hence both are treated to release **blood and *qi***.*
Thus, Taiyin is equal to Yangming—
Both possess **excess blood and *qi***.
The earlier text mentions Taiyin as either **excess blood, deficient *qi*** or **excess *qi*, deficient blood**, but neither can be definitively confirmed.
Upon closer examination of the *Tai Su*’s intent to release **both blood and *qi***, both prior interpretations fall short—
It should align with the Yangming meridian’s treatment.
Additionally, this section on needling the Yangming meridian
Should follow the earlier discussion on **reducing excess and supplementing deficiency**,
Not be separated after the **grassroots methods of the Five Forms of Will**.'*

In the *Treatise on Preserving the Whole Form and Vitality* (《宝命全形论篇》):

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"The heavens cover, the earth bears—
All things are complete, yet none is more precious than humanity.
Humans are born from the **heavenly and earthly *qi***,
And their vitality is shaped by the **four seasons’ laws**.
Heaven flows with **virtue**, earth transforms with *qi*—
When **virtue and *qi*** merge, life emerges.
The *Yijing* (《易》) says:
*'Heaven and earth in mutual vaporous action give birth to all things.'*
This is what it means.

Thus, through **warmth, coolness, cold, and heat**,
Life grows, matures, declines, and stores—
The **four seasons** cycle, and the **principles of treatment** are established.

Nobles and commoners alike seek to **preserve their whole form**,
Though high and low may differ,
Their shared goal is to **cherish life and avoid death**—
This is the universal sentiment of all.

Yet none truly understand the **nature of bodily ailments**—
When **evil *qi*** lingers and festers, day by day it deepens,
Attaching to the **bone marrow**—
The mind privately **worries** (虑).

○ Newly corrected text states:
*"According to the *Tai Su* (《太素》), **worries** (虑) is written as **afflictions** (患)."*

I wish to use **needling** to remove these diseases—
How should I proceed?

When **empty and evil *qi*** invade subtly,
First, it appears in the **complexion**—
Unseen in the body, it may have **form or none**—
Thus, its **nature and state** remain unknown.

If left unchecked, it festers and spreads daily,
As **evil *qi*** seizes **emptiness**—
Thus, it attaches to the **bone marrow**.

The Emperor **refrains from excessive treatment**,
Hence requests the **method of needling** be demonstrated.

○ Newly corrected text states:
*"According to another version, **refrains from excessive treatment** (不度) is written as **not common** (不庶)."*

Gebi replied:
*"When the taste is **salty** (咸), its *qi* causes **organs and vessels** to leak **bodily fluids**—
*Salty* means the **bitter taste of salt**,
Which, when soaked and lingering, moistens things.
Since **bitter** (苦) arises from **salty** (咸),
And **salty** is born from **water** (水),
Moistening downward and leaking bitterly,
It can make **bodily fluids** within the **organs** seep and drain.

**Organs** refer to anything that **receives substances**—
Externally, this means the **scrotum** (阴囊);
Within the body, it refers to the **bladder** (膀胱).

Yet when correlating disease with the **Five Zang organs**,
If **heart *qi*** sinks into the **kidneys** and does not disperse,
This is the case.

Why?
The kidneys **resemble water** and have a **salty taste**,
The heart **corresponds to fire** and has a **bitter taste**—
Bitter *qi* flows as **sweat and bodily fluids**,
Salty *qi* moves toward the **scrotum**,
Fire is held by water,
So the scrotum’s exterior **fluids** leak like sweat,
And seepage does not cease.

The **salty *qi*’s** nature—
When in the heavens, it **moistens** (阴);
When in the **earth**, it **floats** (土);
In humans, it causes **scrotal dampness** and **peeling skin** (囊湿而皮肤剥起).

When **pulse tension is severed** (弦绝),
Its **sound is harsh and broken** (嘶败)—
If the scrotum leaks **fluids** (津泄)
And the pulse is **severed in tension** (弦绝),
The diagnosis should state:
*"The sound is harsh and rasping, the voice is broken and altered."*

Why?
The **liver *qi*** is injured—
When the liver *qi* is injured, the **metal root** (金本) is deficient,
And the **lung *qi*** is incomplete—
The lungs govern **sound and voice**,
Hence it is said the voice is **harsh and rasping**.

*Gǎ* (嘎), pronounced *gā* (嫁切).

When **wood *qi* spreads** (敷),
Its **leaves erupt** (发)—
*Spread* means **diffused** (布).
If **wood *qi*** disperses outward to **nourish the exterior** (外荣),
The disease should manifest in the **lung’s leaf-like structures** (肺叶)."

「Why?
Because **wood *qi*** is **emitting and dispersing** (发散).
The *Treatise on the Physiology of the Ordinary Person* (《平人气象论》) states:
*"The true essence of the liver disperses."* (藏真散於肝)
The liver also corresponds to **wood** (木).
If the disease is **profound** (深),
Its **sound becomes *huì*** (哕)—
*Huì* (哕) refers to **a hoarse, foul voice** (声浊恶).
The lungs store **noxious blood** (恶血),
Hence it is so. (故如是)
When a person exhibits these three symptoms—
This is called *"corruption of the *fǔ*"* (坏府),
Where *fǔ* (府) means **the chest** (胸).
Because the lungs reside in the chest. (以肺处胸中故也)
*Corruption* (坏) means **damaging the *fǔ* and contracting the disease** (损坏其府而取病).
The *Master Who Embraces Simplicity* (《抱朴子》) says:
*"Zhòngjìng* (仲景) opened the chest to administer *chì bǐng* (赤饼)."
Thus, the chest can be **uncovered to extract the disease** (启之而取病矣).
The three symptoms refer to:
**a severed pulse tension** (脉弦绝),
**eruption in the lung’s leaf-like structures** (肺叶发),
and **a hoarse, altered voice** (声浊喊).
Poisonous medicines are **ineffective** (无治),
and short needles **cannot extract** (无取).
These are all cases of **severed skin and injured flesh** (绝皮伤肉),
where **blood and *qi* clash in darkness** (血气争黑).
The disease **ruptures internally** (内溃) within the lungs,
Hence poisonous medicines are ineffective. (故毒药无治)
The symptoms **do not lie along meridians** (外不在於经络),
Hence short needles cannot extract. (故短针无取)
Therefore, when skin is severed and flesh is injured,
It can be **attacked** (攻之).
Because **noxious blood** has long **contended with lung *qi***, (恶血久与肺气交争)
Hence **blood must appear black** (当血见而色黑).
○The newly corrected text states:
*"The reasoning of Gūibó* (岐伯) does not align with the Yellow Emperor’s inquiry."* (详岐伯之对，与黄帝所问不相当)
*"According to *Tàisù* (《太素》), it is said:
Salt’s **caustic flavor** (咸味) causes **instrumental fluids to leak** (器津泄);
When **pulse tension is severed** (弦绝),
Its **sound is harsh and broken** (嘶败);
When **wood *qi* is exhausted** (木陈),
Its **leaves fall** (叶落);
If the disease is **profound** (深),
Its **sound becomes *huì*** (喊).
When a person exhibits these three symptoms—
This is called *"corruption of the *fǔ*"* (坏府),
Poisonous medicines are ineffective,
And short needles cannot extract.
These are all cases of **severed skin and injured flesh** (绝皮伤肉),
Where **blood and *qi* clash in discord** (血气争异)."
The three words differ from this passage,
But the **attention shifts greatly** (注意大异).
Yáng Shàngshàn’s annotation says:
*"It means to know the subtle signs of a disease,
One must observe its **manifestations** (候).
Salt in the **instrument** (器) causes fluids to leak externally (外),
So **recognizing leakage reveals salt’s causticity** (见津而知盐之有咸).
A **harsh voice** (嘶) indicates the **strings of zither or lute are near rupture** (琴瑟之弦将绝).
When **leaves fall** (落),
One knows **exhausted wood** (陈木之已尽).
Using these three **analogies of decay** (物衰坏之微),
One can **compare** (比).
A **hoarse voice** (喊) recognizes the **signs of a profound disease** (病深之侯).
When a person’s **hoarse voice** matches these three analogies,
This is the **sign of *fǔ* corruption** (府坏之候).
**Corruption of the *fǔ*** (中府坏) signifies **a profound disease** (病之深).
Since the disease is profound,
Needles and medicines **cannot extract** (不能取),
Because **skin, flesh, blood, and *qi* are all discordant** (以其皮肉血气各不相得故).
Further elaborating on Shàngshàn’s annotations,
They **align with the Yellow Emperor’s inquiry** (方与黄帝上下问答义相贯穿).
The *Wáng* (王) interpretation of **salt’s causticity causing leakage in instruments** (盐咸器津)
Is profound in meaning,
But when it comes to **annotating severed pulse tension with harsh voice** (弦绝音嘶),
**wood *qi* spreading with leaves erupting** (木敷叶发),
It **does not harmonize with the inquiry** (殊不与帝问相协),
And upon examination,
It **falls short of Yáng’s annotations** (考之不若杨义之得多).
The Yellow Emperor said:
*"I fear its **pain** (痛),
Which **disturbs my heart** (心为之乱惑),
And **exacerbates the disease** (反甚其病),
Making it **impossible to remedy** (不可更代).
The common people hear of this,
And **call me cruel and destructive** (以为残贼).
What should I do?
**残** (*cán*) means **to harm destructively** (残害),
**贼** (*zéi*) means **to damage and exploit** (损劫).
It means I fear **involvement in unkindness** (不仁),
And **incurring suspicion from the populace** (致嫌於黎庶).
Gūibó replied:
*"The human form is **borrowed from the earth** (生於地),
And **life is suspended from heaven** (悬命於天).
When **heavenly and earthly *qi* combine** (天地合气),
It is called **human life** (命之曰人).
The **shape is formed by matter** (形假物成),
Hence it is **borrowed from the earth** (生於地).
**Virtue is granted by heaven** (命惟天赋),
Hence it is **suspended from heaven** (悬於天).
**Virtue and *qi* converge** (德气同归),
Thus it is called **human** (人).
The *Spiritual Pivot* (《灵枢经》) states:
*"Heaven’s virtue in me is **Dao** (德),
Earth’s virtue in me is **life-giving *qi*** (气),
And **life emerges from the flow of Dao and the diffusion of *qi*** (德流气薄而生)."
Yet **virtue is the application of the Dao** (道之用),
And **life-giving *qi* is the origin of life** (生之母).
The person who can **respond to the four seasons** (应四时),
Heaven and Earth become their **parents** (父母);
The person who can **respond to the harmonious *qi* of the four seasons** and **nurture life** (应四时和气而养生),
Heaven and Earth **steadfastly cultivate and nourish** (怛畜养之),
Thus they are called **parents** (父母).
The *Great Treatise on Adjusting the Spirit to the Four Seasons* (《四气调神大论》) says:
*"The four seasons’ **yin-yang** (阴阳) are
The **root and foundation of all things** (万物之根本).
Thus the **sage** (圣人) nurtures **yang** in spring and summer,
And **yin** in autumn and winter,
To **follow its roots** (从其根),
And so **align with all things in their cycles of growth and decline** (与万物沉浮於生长之门).
To **know all things** (知万物) is called **the child of heaven** (天子).
To **know the root and foundation of all things** (知万物之根本),
Heaven and Earth **constantly cultivate and nourish** (常育养),
Thus it is called **the child of heaven’s Dao** (天之子).
Heaven has **yin-yang** (阴阳),
Humans have **twelve nodal points** (十二节);
**Nodal points** (节) refer to **seasonal shifts in *qi*** (节气).
The **exterior** (外) responds to the **twelve months** (十二月),
The **interior** governs the **twelve meridians** (十二经脉).
Heaven has **cold and heat** (寒暑),
Humans have **emptiness and fullness** (虚实).
Cold and heat have **cycles of flourishing and decline** (盛衰之纪),
Emptiness and fullness **display varying degrees** (表多少之殊),
Thus humans **respond to cold and heat through emptiness and fullness** (以虚实应天寒暑).
Those who **can endure the transformations of heaven and earth’s yin-yang** (经天地阴阳之化),
**Do not fail the four seasons** (不失四时);
Those who **understand the principles of the twelve nodal points** (知十二节之理),
Even **sages cannot deceive** (圣智不能欺).
**Endure** (经) means **constantly** (常).
It means those who **constantly follow and adapt to heaven and earth’s yin-yang Dao** (应顺天地阴阳之道而修养),
Then **harmonize with the appropriate growth of the four seasons** (则合四时生长之宜).
Those who **know where the twelve seasonal *qi* shifts** (知十二节气之所迁至),
Even **sages cannot deceive or harm** (虽圣智亦不欺侮而奉行).
Those who **can preserve the eight seasonal changes** (存八动),
And **the five phases’ mutual conquests** (五胜更立);
Those who **can discern the numbers of emptiness and fullness** (达虚实之数),
Can **enter and exit independently** (独出独入),
And **reach the most refined stages** (阶吟至微),
With **even the finest details visible** (秋毫在目).
**Preserve** (存) means **to keep in mind** (心存).
**Discern** (达) means **to understand thoroughly** (明达).
**怯** (*qiè*) means **breathing with bared teeth** (露齿出气).
**阶吟** (*jiē yín*) means **gradual progression and subtle observation** (阶吟至微).
**秋毫在目** (*qiū háo zài mù*) means **to perceive the finest details** (细铃察).
The **eight seasonal changes** (八动) refer to **the eight winds of the nodal points** (八节之风变动).
The **five phases’ mutual conquests** (五胜) refer to **the *qi* of the five elements overcoming one another** (五行之气相胜).
**立** (*lì*) means **when they reign** (当其王时).
**变** (*biàn*) means **when *qi* arrives and transforms** (气至而变易).
To **know these three principles** (知是三者),
One must **respond clearly and effectively** (则应效明着).
Swiftly, like **echoes and reflections** (速犹影响),
This is **the divine ability to enter and exit independently** (自神之独出独入),
And **not something even spirits can summon** (亦非鬼灵能召遣).
○The newly corrected text states:
*"According to Yáng Shàngshàn’s annotations:
**怯** (*qiè*), pronounced *hè zhē* (核遮切),
Means **breathing with bared teeth** (露齿出气)."
The Yellow Emperor said:
*"Human life emerges with form,
And **does not depart from yin-yang** (不离阴阳).
Heaven and Earth combine their *qi*,
Distinctly forming **nine regions** (九野),
And dividing into **four seasons** (四时).
The **moon has varying sizes** (月有小大),
The **sun has varying lengths** (日有短长),
And **all things converge simultaneously** (万物并至),
**Beyond measure** (不可胜量).
Emptiness and fullness **progress subtly** (阶吟),
May I ask **the methods to treat them** (敢问其方)?"

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"Please explain the intent behind using the needle."*

Gē Bó replied:
*"Wood is felled by metal, fire is extinguished by water,
Earth is cultivated by wood, metal is weakened by fire,
Water is blocked by earth—
All things follow this pattern, inexhaustible in their interactions.
**‘Reach’ (dá) means ‘to communicate.’**
Though the myriad things cannot be fully enumerated,
their essence lies in the five phases’ *qi*,
each bearing the nature of **victory and defeat**.

Thus, there are **five needle methods** suspended across the land,
Yet the common folk, sated with **abundance** (or: *fullness*),
know nothing of them.
Though the Dao of the needle is proclaimed like a banner across the world,
the people scorn it as mere surplus,
pursuing frivolous ends while neglecting the root—
none grasp its true essence, hidden within.

The five methods are detailed below.

○The newly corrected text states:
According to Quán Yuánqǐ’s original text, **‘abundance’ (yúshí)** was written as **‘sated with food’ (bǎoshí)**.
The annotation reads:
*'People, being dull, do not comprehend yin-yang,
and thus do not know the needle’s subtleties.
Though they eat to their fill all day,
they cannot fathom its benefits.'*
Elsewhere in *Tài Sū*, it reads **‘drink and eat.’**
Yáng Shàngshàn’s annotation explains:
**‘Pízhěn** (黔首), pronounced *jiān*,
refers to the common folk who practice this Dao
yet fail to grasp its meaning.
**One:** *Cultivating the spirit*—
concentrating the mind without distraction,
so that it does not wander recklessly.
This is why it is said:
*'The hand grips the tiger,*
*the spirit does not stray among trivial things.'*
It seeks to regulate the spirit,
to focus the mind.

○The newly corrected text states:
According to Yáng Shàngshàn:
*'Those who know the Dao of nurturing life
understand these five principles
as the means to prolong vitality through cultivation.*
**Soul, spirit, mind, will, and intent** are all called *spirit*,
for they govern life.
Thus, those who practice the needle
must first cultivate the spirit.

Hence, if one **avoids sorrow and grief**,
the soul is unharmed, the liver remains healthy,
and autumn brings no difficulty;
if one **avoids restlessness and overthinking**,
the spirit is unharmed, the heart remains healthy,
and winter brings no difficulty;
if one **avoids prolonged worry and distress**,
the mind is unharmed, the spleen remains healthy,
and spring brings no difficulty;
if one **avoids excessive joy and mirth**,
the will is unharmed, the lungs remain healthy,
and summer brings no difficulty;
if one **avoids violent rage**,
the intent is unharmed, the kidneys remain healthy,
and late summer brings no difficulty.

Thus, if the **five excesses** do not take root in the mind,
the spirit clears and nature shines bright;
if the **five spirits** dwell harmoniously in their respective organs,
longevity extends beyond measure.

**Two:** *Knowing how to nurture oneself*—
to know the methods of self-nurture
is like knowing how to nurture others.
As the *Grand Treatise on Corresponding with Yin-Yang* states:
*'The practitioner of the needle
must know the other as they know themselves—
then its use will be without peril.'*
This is the meaning."

Yang Shangshan said:
*"Moderation in eating and drinking, and in sexual activity, must be governed by limits;
wind, cold, heat, and dampness must be regulated by the seasons.
To avoid the harm of single-footed leopards wasting away externally is to nourish the form internally.
To practice true benevolence and forgiveness in loving others,
and to harmonize with the dust and toil of life without seeking advancement,
avoids the injury of Zhang Yi’s high-gated arrogance—this is to nourish the form externally.
When internal and external nourishment are fully realized,
one need not seek life and yet lives long,
need not seek longevity and yet attains it—
this is the ultimate of the Daoist’s art in nurturing the form.

The Emperor of Primordial Mystery said:
*'The highest is to nurture the spirit;
the next is to nurture the form.'*
Examining Wang’s commentary,
it focuses solely on nurturing the spirit in the practice of acupuncture,
a view that is too narrow compared to Shangshan’s teachings.

If one were to interpret these five principles as applying only to the moment of acupuncture,
then the following passage on knowing poisonous medicines as true would be misconstrued,
and Wang’s theory would not be limited solely to acupuncture as its solution.

**Three:** *Knowing poisonous medicines as true*—
poisonous medicines attack evil,
and their use must conform to what is fitting and proper—
this is the true Dao of healing.

**Four:** *Mastering the size of the phlebotomy stone*—
In ancient times, the phlebotomy stone was used as a needle,
so the *Nine Needles* are not mentioned here—only the phlebotomy stone.
When crafting its size,
it must be used according to the disease’s requirements.

*New Annotation:* According to Quan Yuanqi:
*The phlebotomy stone is an ancient external treatment with three names:
one called *needle-stone*, two called *phlebotomy stone*, three called *cauterizing stone*—
in essence, they are the same.
In ancient times, iron could not be cast,
so stone was used as a needle.
Thus, it was named *needle-stone*,
speaking of its craftsmanship—sharpened and honed to a fine edge,
its size adjusted to match the disease.
The Yellow Emperor created the *Nine Needles* to replace the cauterizing stone.
In the most ancient treatments,
each method was applied as appropriate.
In the regions of the *Bundle States*, many suffered from atrophy and swelling,
so the phlebotomy stone emerged there.

**Five:** *Knowing the diagnosis of blood and qi in the reservoirs and storage organs*—
The *Six Yang* are reservoirs, the *Six Yin* are storage organs.
Thus, the *Blood and Qi, Form and Will* chapter states:
*The Greater Yang has abundant blood and little qi;
the Lesser Yang has little blood and abundant qi;
the Yang Brightness has abundant qi and little blood;
the Lesser Yin has little blood and abundant qi;
the Sinking Yin has abundant blood and little qi;
the Greater Yin has abundant qi and little blood.*

Thus, when puncturing the Yang Brightness, one releases blood and evil qi;
when puncturing the Greater Yang, one releases blood and evil qi;
when puncturing the Lesser Yang, one releases qi and evil blood;
when puncturing the Greater Yin, one releases qi and evil blood;
when puncturing the Lesser Yin, one releases qi and evil blood;
when puncturing the Sinking Yin, one releases blood and evil qi.
To know precisely the excess or deficiency,
and to supplement accordingly, ensures complete efficacy.
The five methods stand complete,
each with its priority.
When the situation demands it, apply accordingly.

In the present age of acupuncture,
one treats the empty as if full,
and the full as if empty—
this is what all practitioners commonly know.
But to follow Heaven and conform to Earth,
to move in response to circumstances,
harmonizing like echoes, following like shadows—
the Dao has no need of ghosts or spirits,
coming and going alone.
To move in response to circumstances speaks to its efficacy;
like shadows and echoes, it speaks to its immediacy.
How could there be any need for summoning ghosts or spirits?
It is only because one moves in response to circumstances naturally.

The Emperor said:
*'I wish to hear its method.'*

Geben said:
*'The true essence of acupuncture
must first cultivate the spirit.
Concentrate the spirit,
quiet and undisturbed—
this is the true essence of acupuncture.

Only after the five storage organs are settled
and the nine diagnostic regions are examined,
should one then consider the needle.
The seven diagnostic methods must be precise,
and the five storage organs must not be in rebellion.
Externally and internally, the form and qi must align,
and one must not impose their own form upon the patient.

When the patient’s condition is thoroughly understood,
then the needle may be applied.
To "play" with the diagnosis means mastery.
The *Discourse on the Transmission of Disease from Root to Branch* states:
*"Master the yin and yang thoroughly,
and do not consult with the masses."*
This is of the same kind.

*New Annotation:* This passage originates from the *Discourse on Yin-Yang Differentiation*,
not the *Discourse on the Transmission of Disease from Root to Branch*, as mistakenly stated.

The patient’s condition may be empty or full.
Do not approach when the five storage organs are empty,
and do not retreat when they are full.
When the moment arrives,
the decision must be made without hesitation.

The patient’s emptiness or fullness
does not arise from mere distance or proximity,
but from the momentary ebb and flow of blood and qi.
Before its manifestation,
it is like a cloud hanging—visible but slow to change;
when it manifests,
it is like lightning flashing—too swift for the finger to follow.
The difference in speed is thus.

*New Annotation:* In the *A-B Canon*, the character is □.
Quan Yuanqi’s original text and the *Taisu* also use □.
□ is pronounced *shùn* (顺).

When the hand moves with intent,
the needle gleams evenly.
The hand moves with the needle,
the mind focused as if on a single task.
The *Needle Classic* says:
*"Unify the form,
listen to its movement and stillness,
and know the evil and the true."*
This is what is meant.

*The needle gleams evenly*
refers to the needle’s form,
its cold light evenly balanced above and below.

With a still mind and measured breath,
observe the changes in the patient’s condition—
this is called *sufficiently subtle*,
where even the form of the unseen is discerned.
Though the needle’s work is precise and the intent profound,
one still cannot fathom the shifting forms of blood and qi.

*New Annotation:* According to the *Eight Regulations of Divine Clarity*:
*"Observing the subtle*
speaks of the form and qi of the *honor* and *defense* mechanisms,
which do not manifest externally,
yet the skilled practitioner alone perceives them—
adjusting according to the day’s cold or warmth,
the month’s emptiness or fullness,
and the seasonal qi’s ascent or descent,
harmonizing them in combination.
The practitioner often sees these changes beforehand,
though they do not manifest externally,
hence the saying: *observing the subtle.*"

「When the practitioner observes its *wūwū* (dark and obscure), its *jìjì* (dense and concentrated), following the sight of its *fēi* (soaring), yet does not know its master—
*Wūwū* is when one marvels at the arrival of the *qi*;
*Jìjì* is when one laments its response.

The *qi* obtained from the needle, like watching a crow soar in the sky,
who could possibly know the original source that summons it?
It is merely seen as the ebb and flow of the *jingmai* (meridian vessels),
yet one still does not grasp who calls it forth.

When it lies dormant, it is like a crossbow held steady;
when it rises, it is like a trigger released.
Before blood and *qi* respond to the needle, they rest quietly, like a crossbow at ease;
when they respond to the needle, they surge forth swiftly, like a trigger loosed.

The Yellow Emperor asked: How does one determine when it is *xū* (empty)?
How does one determine when it is *shí* (full)?

The practitioner does not merely rely on the arrival of the *qi*—
its empty and full states cannot be fixed by simply counting breaths!
The criteria for its empty and full forms are not so rigid—
how then does one discern them?

Gūbó replied: When needling the *shí* (full), one must await its *xū* (empty);
when needling the *xū* (empty), one must await its *shí* (full).
This means one must rely on the *qi*’s arrival to have effect—
not rigidly adhering to breath counts as a fixed rule.

Once the *jingqi* (meridian *qi*) has arrived,
guard it carefully and do not let it slip away—
do not alter the method and lose the *jingqi*.

Depth and shallowness depend on intent;
far and near are as one.
Like standing at the edge of a deep abyss,
one’s hand grips like holding a tiger—
the spirit does not stray among myriad things.

This speaks of focused concentration.
The *jingmai* (meridian vessels) and *qi* needled,
though their depths vary,
yet their supplementation and reduction are equal—
the practitioner’s singular intent makes the hand firm as grasping a tiger,
and the spirit does not wander externally.

*New Annotation:* According to the *Zhēnjiě Lùn*:
When needling the *shí* (full), one must await its *xū* (empty)—
leave the needle until the *yīnqi* (yin *qi*) surges forth, then remove it.
When needling the *xū* (empty), one must await its *shí* (full)—
leave the needle until the *yángqi* (yang *qi*) rises and warmth appears beneath the needle, then remove it.
Once the *jingqi* (meridian *qi*) has arrived,
guard it carefully and do not let it slip away—
do not change the method or lose the *jingqi*.
Depth and shallowness depend on intent—
one must know the disease’s internal or external nature.
Far and near are as one—
the signs of depth and shallowness are equal in severity.
Like standing at the edge of a deep abyss—
one must not dare to falter.
Hand as firm as grasping a tiger—
one must act with boldness and strength.
Spirit does not stray among myriad things—
calm the intent and observe the patient,
without glancing left or right.

*Huángdì Nèijīng Sūwèn Bǔ Zhùjìng* Volume Nineteen
Annotated by *Táng Tàipù Lìng Qǐ Xuānzǐ Wáng Bīng*, revised by *Sòng Guānglù Qīng Zhí Mìgé Lín Yì* et al., corrected by *Sòng Shǒushù Shàngshū Fúntián Láng Sūn Zhào*.」

**Eight Correct Principles of Divine Clarity (Bā Zhèng Shén Míng Lùn) Discourse**

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"The use of needles for treatment must surely follow certain principles and rules. What are these principles and rules today?"*
(*"Service" (服), "principles" (法), "rules" (则).*)

Qībó replied: *"Follow the Dao of Heaven and align with the Earth, harmonizing with celestial luminosity."* (*i.e., the movements of the sun, moon, stars, and constellations.*)

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish to hear this fully."*

Qībó said: *"In general, the principles of acupuncture must observe the sun’s warmth and cold, the moon’s waxing and waning, the stars and constellations, and the eight correct seasonal rhythms of qi. Only when the qi is stable may one administer treatment.*

*Observing the sun and moon refers to noting the sun’s warmth or cold and the moon’s phases of fullness or emptiness. The stars and constellations refer to first knowing the divisions of the Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions and their correspondence with the water clock’s divisions.*

*Briefly put, one adds the sun’s position to the mansions above, thus knowing whether human qi resides in the Greater Yang (太阳) or not. When the sun moves one mansion, human qi is in the Three Yang and Yin divisions.*

*More precisely, from the mansion Fáng (房) to Bì (毕)—fourteen mansions—fifty water clock divisions pass, marking half the day. From the mansion Xù (勖) to Xīn (心)—also fourteen mansions—fifty water clock divisions pass, marking the full day. Thus, from Fáng to Bì is yang, from Xù to Xīn is yin, yang governing the day, yin governing the night.*

*Nearly every day, the sun moves one mansion, so the water clock marks three divisions and seven subdivisions (四) in total.*

*The *Língshū Jīng* states: *"One water clock division, human qi is in the Greater Yang; two divisions, human qi is in the Lesser Yang; three divisions, human qi is in the Yang Brightness; four divisions, human qi is in the Yin divisions. The water clock divisions do not stop, and the movement of qi follows accordingly."*

*It further states: *"When the sun moves one mansion, human qi circulates one full cycle of the body and eight-tenths of another. When the sun moves two mansions, human qi circulates three full cycles and six-tenths of another. When the sun moves three mansions, human qi circulates five full cycles and four-tenths of another. When the sun moves four mansions, human qi circulates seven full cycles and two-tenths of another. When the sun moves five mansions, human qi circulates nine full cycles. Yet when the sun moves twenty-eight mansions, human qi circulates fifty full cycles and four-tenths of another. Thus, one must observe the sun, moon, stars, and constellations."*

*The eight correct seasonal rhythms of qi refer to the winds of the eight nodes that gather at the Supreme One (太一). One must observe where these winds reside before treating. The phrase "only when the qi is stable may one administer treatment" means that when the winds of the eight nodes have settled, one may then treat the channels and collaterals, balancing emptiness and fullness.*

*Hence, the *Lìjì* (Calendar of Taboos) states: *"For five days before and after each of the eight nodes, one must not administer acupuncture or moxibustion, or disaster will follow."* This is because the qi has not yet settled, so treatment is forbidden.*

**Newly corrected annotations state:** *"The winds of the eight nodes gathering at the Supreme One are detailed in the *Tiānyuán Yùcè* (Celestial Origins’ Jade Register)."*

*Thus, when Heaven is warm and the sun is bright, human blood is pure and the defensive qi ascends, making blood easy to disperse and qi easy to move. When Heaven is cold and the sun is obscured, human blood congeals and the defensive qi descends. (*"Congeals" (凝泣) refers to blood settling like snow in water. "Dissipate" (写) is pronounced as *yì* (slave teaching), meaning "abundant."*)*

*When the moon first appears, blood and qi begin to refine, and the defensive qi begins to circulate. When the moon reaches fullness, blood and qi are abundant, and the flesh and muscles firm. When the moon’s fullness wanes, the flesh and muscles weaken, the channels and collaterals become empty, the defensive qi departs, and the form stands alone.*

*Therefore, one must regulate blood and qi according to the seasons. When Heaven is cold, one must not disperse, for blood congeals and defensive qi descends. When Heaven is warm, there is no congealing. Blood is pure and qi moves easily. When the moon is new, one must not disperse; when the moon is full, one must not supplement; when the moon’s fullness wanes, one must not treat. This is called aligning with the seasons.*

(*i.e., observing the natural order of Heaven.*)

*Following Heaven’s sequence, supplementing or dispersing at the proper time, adjusting light and position, and standing upright to await the moment. One must observe the sun’s movement, determine the qi’s location, stand facing south, and wait for the qi to arrive before regulating it.*

*Thus, dispersing when the sun and moon are new is called "emptying the storage" (*藏虚*), meaning "blood and qi are weak."*

**Newly corrected annotations state:** *"In the original text, ‘storage’ (藏) was mistakenly written as ‘caustic’ (咸#1); it should be ‘empty’ (虚)."*

*Supplementing when the moon is full is called "excessive fullness" (*重实*), for blood and qi overflow, and the collaterals retain stagnant blood. (*"Collaterals" (络) are also channels (经); this is an error. "Stagnant" (留) should be "flowing" (流). This is incorrect.*)*
(*i.e., "blood and qi are abundant."*)

*When the moon’s fullness wanes, treating is called "disordering the channels" (*乱经*), for yin and yang become confused, true and false qi indistinguishable, stagnation causing retention, external emptiness and internal disorder, and licentious pathogens arising. (*"Qi loses its measure" (气失纪), so licentious pathogens arise.*)*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How does one observe the stars and the eight correct seasonal rhythms?"*

Qībó replied: *"The stars and constellations are what regulate the sun and moon’s movements. (*"Regulate" (制) means "institutionalize."*)*

*By establishing the stars and constellations, one may know the sun and moon’s institutionalized movements.*

*Briefly put, the Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions of the Great Heavenly Cycle are divided into thirty-six parts. When human qi completes one full cycle, it nearly reaches eighteen parts. The body’s circumference is sixteen *zhàng* (丈) and two *chǐ* (尺), corresponding to the Twenty-Eight Mansions. Combined with the water clock’s hundred divisions, the total movement is eight hundred and ten *zhàng*, dividing day and night.*

*Thus, for every ten breaths, qi moves six *chǐ*, and the sun moves two divisions. Two hundred and seventy breaths, qi moves sixteen *zhàng* and two *chǐ*, completing one full cycle of the body, with the water clock marking two divisions and the sun moving twenty divisions. Five hundred and forty breaths, qi completes two full cycles of the body, the water clock marks four divisions, and the sun moves forty divisions. Two thousand seven hundred breaths, qi completes ten full cycles of the body, the water clock marks twenty divisions, and the sun moves five mansions and twenty divisions. Thirteen thousand five hundred breaths, qi completes fifty full cycles of the body, the water clock marks one hundred divisions, and the sun moves the Twenty-Eight Mansions.*

*More precisely, one must add one full cycle of ten divisions and six-tenths of another, thus exhausting all the odd subdivisions."*

Thus, the stars and constellations are used to regulate the movements and degrees of the sun and moon.

○The newly corrected text states: *"The detailed explanation of the Twenty-Eight Mansions completing a full cycle as the sun moves through the Twenty-Eight Mansions is taken from the original text of the *Ling Shu Jing* [《灵枢经》]. Now it is fully elaborated in the *Jia Yi Jing* [《甲乙经》]."*

The Eight Directions serve to observe the **Eight Winds**—the **Dao/Way’s** pernicious **qi**—as they arrive at appointed times. The Eight Directions refer to the **Dao/Way’s** rectified **qi** of the Eight Nodes. The Eight Winds are:
- **East** (束方): the **Ying Xi** [婴兄] Wind,
- **South** (南方): the **Great Weak** [大弱] Wind,
- **West** (西方): the **Strong** [刚] Wind,
- **North** (北方): the **Great Strong** [大刚] Wind,
- **Southeast** (束北方): the **Fierce** [凶] Wind,
- **Southwest** (束南方): the **Weak** [弱] Wind,
- **Southwest** (西南方): the **Plotting** [谋] Wind,
- **Northeast** (西北方): the **Folding** [折] Wind.

**Pernicious qi** refers to that which seizes upon the body’s vulnerabilities and causes illness. **Arriving at appointed times** means that when the **Dao/Way’s** **Great Unity** [太一] shifts its abode, the Eight Winds, in accordance with the **Dao/Way’s** Nodes, strike the **Central Official** [中官] and arrive.

○The newly corrected text states: *"The detailed explanation of the **Great Unity** shifting its abode and the Eight Winds striking the **Central Official** is fully elaborated in the *Tian Yuan Yu Ce* [《天元玉册》]."*

The Four Seasons are used to partition the **Dao/Way’s** **qi** of spring, autumn, winter, and summer, adjusting it according to the times, and to avoid the pernicious **qi** of the Eight Directions so as not to be afflicted. The **Dao/Way’s** **qi** of each season manifests as follows:
- **Spring qi** resides in the **meridians** [经] and **muscles** [豚],
- **Summer qi** resides in the **collaterals** [络] and **tendons** [孙],
- **Autumn qi** resides in the **skin** [皮] and **flesh** [肤],
- **Winter qi** resides in the **bones** [骨] and **marrow** [髓].

If one is exposed to pernicious **qi**, the **True qi** [真气] of the body is disturbed, and if one avoids it and does not transgress, illness will not arise. The *Ling Shu Jing* [《灵枢经》] says: *"The sage avoids evil **Dao/Way**, as one avoids arrows and stones."* This is because such **qi** can harm the **True qi**. When the body’s vulnerabilities coincide with the **Dao/Way’s** vulnerabilities, the two **qi**s resonate, and the **Dao/Way’s** **qi** reaches the bones. If it enters, it injures the **Five Zang** [五藏]. This is because **Dao/Way’s** vulnerabilities resonate with the body’s vulnerabilities, and **qi**s of similar nature respond to each other. The skilled practitioner can rescue it, and thus it cannot harm. If observed correctly, it will not harm; hence, the saying: *"The **Dao/Way’s** taboos must not be unknown."* The body’s taboos are in relation to the **Dao/Way’s** taboos, hence the term **"Dao/Way’s** taboos." If one transgresses them, illness arises, hence they must not be unknown.

The Emperor said: *"Good."* I have heard the method of the stars and constellations, but I wish to hear the method of the ancients.

**Gui Bo** [岐伯] replied: *"The method of the ancients is to first master the *Zhen Jing* [《针经》]."* To verify it in the present, one must first know the sun’s cold and warm phases, the moon’s waxing and waning, and observe the **Dao/Way’s** **qi**’s rise and fall to adjust it within the body, thus ensuring the efficacy of treatment. If the **Dao/Way’s** **qi** is observed without error, treatment will be effective.

To **observe its subtlety** [冥冥], it means that the **form**, **Dao/Way’s** **qi**, and the **Nourishing** [荣] and **Defensive** [卫] **qi** do not manifest externally, yet only the skilled practitioner knows them. This clarifies the meaning of the previous section’s *"quietly gaze"* [静意视], observing the **Dao/Way’s** **qi**’s changes—this is called **subtlety**, for its form is unknown.

Though the **form**, **Dao/Way’s** **qi**, and the **Nourishing** and **Defensive** **qi** do not appear externally, the skilled practitioner, through clear intuition and divine insight, alone discerns their waxing and waning, and can distinguish good from evil.

○The newly corrected text states: *"By correlating the sun’s cold and warm phases, the moon’s waxing and waning, and the Four Seasons’ **Dao/Way’s** **qi**’s rise and fall, the practitioner harmonizes them and often perceives these changes beforehand. However, they do not manifest externally, hence the saying: 'to observe its subtlety.' The practitioner’s ability to perceive them beforehand arises from what? It is because they adhere to the principles and possess clear intuition. Intuition that extends to the infinite allows them to pass it on to future generations, hence the practitioner’s distinction. Principles being established make transmission possible, and if transmission continues unbroken, their intuitive understanding will extend infinitely. Because they alone perceive and know, the practitioner thus differs from others. Yet these changes do not manifest externally, hence both they and others cannot see them. The practitioner’s distinction from the coarse lies in the fact that the coarse cannot perceive them. The **form** is invisible, the **taste** is inaudible, hence the term **subtlety**—like the **Dao/Way’s** **qi** of the divine hair and beard. It speaks of the **form** and **Dao/Way’s** **qi**, and the **Nourishing** and **Defensive** **qi** not manifesting externally, and thus being unseen, hence 'invisible to the eye,' 'tasteless to the tongue.' Hidden like a crossbow drawn, rising like a trigger released, deep and unfathomable, no one knows the origin—this is like the **Dao/Way’s** **qi** of the divine hair and beard."*

**Pernicious qi** refers to the **Dao/Way’s** pernicious **qi** of the Eight Directions. The **Dao/Way’s** pernicious **qi** of the Eight Directions refers to the pernicious **qi** of the Eight Nodes. It comes from the realm of vulnerabilities and seizes upon them to enter and cause illness, hence it is called the **Eight Winds’ pernicious qi**.

**Pernicious and rectified** [正邪] **qi** refers to when the body’s **form** is strained by exertion and sweat emerges, the **Dao/Way’s** **True qi** [胜理] is exposed. If it encounters even one pernicious wind, the person within becomes faint, hence the saying: *"No one knows its nature, no one sees its form."* **Rectified and pernicious** **qi** does not come from the realm of vulnerabilities. Because the person within becomes faint, no one knows their intentions, nor sees their appearance.

The skilled practitioner rescues it at its inception, ensuring they first perceive the **Three Divisions** [三部] and **Nine Observations** [九候] of the **Dao/Way’s** **qi**, fully harmonizing it so that it does not fail and thus saving it—hence the term **skilled practitioner**. The lesser practitioner rescues it after it has already taken form, after it has already failed. To rescue it after it has taken form means that they do not know the **Three Divisions** and **Nine Observations** of the **Dao/Way’s** **qi**, and thus illness arises and it is too late to save.

○The meaning is fully elaborated in the *Li He Zhen Xie Lun* [《离合真邪论》]*.

To know its location means to know the **Three Divisions** and **Nine Observations** of the illness’s **pulse** [脉] and then to treat it, hence the saying: *"to guard its gateways."* No one knows its nature, yet its **form** is seen. The **Three Divisions** and **Nine Observations** are the gateways for observing **Dao/Way’s** pernicious **qi**. To guard the gateways means to see the **form** of the pernicious **qi**. Because the person within becomes faint, no one knows its nature.

The Emperor said: *"I have heard of the methods of supplementation and drainage, but I have not grasped their meaning."*

Qi Bo replied: *"Drainage must follow the **right timing** [方], for **timing** means when **qi** is at its peak, when the moon is full, when the sun is warm, when the body is at rest, and when the breath is inhaled inward before inserting the needle. Then, one must wait for the exhalation to turn the needle and withdraw it slowly. Hence, drainage must follow the **right timing**, allowing the **qi** to flow accordingly. **Timing** is akin to **correctness**.

When pernicious **qi** is drained out, the true **qi** will flow freely. **Supplementation** must follow **movement** [员], for **movement** means **propulsion**, and **propulsion** refers to dispersing stagnant **qi** so that it must circulate freely. **Movement** also means redirecting unhealed pulses to restore balance. Needling must strike the **honorific vessels** [荣], withdrawing with inhalation to expel. When the needle reaches the blood, it is called striking the **honorific vessels**.

Thus, **timing** and **movement** are not about the needle’s shape but about the principles of **propulsion** and **redirection**. Therefore, nurturing the **spirit** [神] requires knowing the body’s fatness or leanness, the flourishing or decline of **honorific** and **defensive** **qi**, blood, and **qi**—for blood and **qi** are the essence of human **spirit**, which must be carefully nurtured. When the **spirit** is at peace, life extends; when the **spirit** departs, the body decays. Hence, it must be carefully nurtured.

The Emperor said: *"How profound your discourse! You harmonize the human form with **Yin** and **Yang**, the responses of emptiness and fullness, the mysterious and the apparent. Who but you could comprehend this? Yet you often speak of **form** and **spirit**—what do you mean by **spirit**? What do you mean by **form**? I wish to hear it fully."*

**Spirit** refers to enlightened awareness. **Form** refers to the observable **form**—what can be examined through physical diagnosis.

Qi Bo said: *"Let me speak of **form**. **Form** is what the eyes cannot see—when you ask about a patient’s ailment, the *newly corrected text* notes: ‘By pressing where it hurts’ [按其所痛], which also makes sense. Seek it along the **meridians**, and it appears clearly before you. Pressing finds nothing, yet its nature is unknown—hence, **form**. Externally, it hides its formlessness, so the eyes see nothing. Internally, it conceals its presence, yet diagnosis can trace it along the **meridians**. ‘Appearing suddenly before you’ means that within the **Three Divisions** and **Nine Observations**, it may suddenly appear without warning. The *Li He Zhen Xie Lun* states: ‘In **Yin** and **Yang**, it cannot be measured. Follow it through the **Three Divisions** and **Nine Observations**, and it may suddenly appear—then block its path early. This is its meaning.’

The Emperor said: ‘What is **spirit**?’

Qi Bo replied: *"Let me speak of **spirit**. **Spirit** is what the ears cannot hear—yet the eyes see clearly, the heart opens, and the will acts first. Sudden enlightenment dawns, though words cannot express it. All may look, yet only one sees. It seems as if in darkness, yet one alone perceives with sudden clarity, like clouds dispersed by wind. Hence, it is called **spirit**.

‘The ears cannot hear’ speaks to the subtlety of **spirit’s** work. ‘The eyes see clearly, the heart opens, and the will acts first’ means the heart’s understanding is like a scroll unrolled, the eyes’ vision like mist clearing—though **spirit** is internally unified, the will has already moved ahead. ‘Sudden enlightenment’ refers to clarity and insight. ‘Though words cannot express it’ means the heart is clear and understood, yet speech cannot convey it. ‘All may look, yet one sees alone’—it seems as if in darkness, yet one suddenly perceives. Once alone in insight, the eyes alone see clearly, like clouds scattering under wind, sunlight breaking through—how profound is **spirit**! Its wonders are beyond words.

Its principles stem from the **Three Divisions** and **Nine Observations**; the theories of the **Nine Needles** need not be retained. If the **Three Divisions** and **Nine Observations** of the **meridians** are taken as foundation, then the mysteries of **spirit** and enlightenment can be mastered. If one discards the **Nine Needles** theories, knowledge will only grow broader, yet understanding will remain distant. Hence, the **Three Divisions** and **Nine Observations** are the root—discarding the **Nine Needles** theories is unnecessary."*

**Li He Zhen Xie Lun** [《离合真邪论》]

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"I have heard of the **Nine Needles** and their nine principles. You have expanded them into ninety-nine—eighty-one treatises. I have grasped their meaning. The classics speak of the rise and fall of **qi**, its leftward and rightward shifts, adjusting the upper to the lower, the left to the right, and supplementing or draining at **honorific** and **transporting** points. I understand this. These are the shifts of **honorific** and **defensive** **qi**, the origins of emptiness and fullness—not pernicious **qi** entering the **meridians** from outside.

I wish to hear of pernicious **qi** within the **meridians**: how does it affect the patient, and how should it be treated?"*

Qi Bo answered: *"The sages established their measurements to align with Heaven and Earth. Thus, Heaven has the **mansions** [宿], Earth has the **classifying waters** [经水], and humans have **meridians**. **Mansions** refer to the Twenty-Eight **Mansions**. **Classifying waters** are the seas: the **Sea**, the **Jing** River, the **Wei** River, **Hu** Lake, the **Mian** River, the **Ru** River, the **Jiang** River, the **Huai** River, the **Luo** River, the **He** River, the **Zang** River, and the **Ji** River—named so because they internally correspond to the **meridians**. **Meridians** refer to the **meridians** of the hands and feet, the three **Yin** and three **Yang**.

The *newly corrected text* notes: ‘The **foot Yang Ming** externally corresponds to the **Sea**, internally to the **stomach**; the **foot Tai Yang** externally to the **Jing** River, internally to the **bladder**; the **foot Shao Yang** externally to the **Wei** River, internally to the **gallbladder**; the **foot Tai Yin** externally to **Hu** Lake, internally to the **spleen**; the **foot Jue Yin** externally to the **Mian** River, internally to the **liver**; the **foot Shao Yin** externally to the **Ru** River, internally to the **kidneys**; the **hand Yang Ming** externally to the **Jiang** River, internally to the **large intestine.’"*

The **hand Tai Yang** externally corresponds to the **Huai River**, internally to the **small intestine**; the **hand Shao Yang** externally to the **Luo River**, internally to the **San Jiao**; the **hand Tai Yin** externally to the **He River**, internally to the **lung**; the **hand Jue Yin** externally to the **Zhang River**, internally to the **heart wrapper**.

When the **Heaven and Earth** are temperate and harmonious, the **meridian waters** remain tranquil; when **Heaven is cold and Earth frozen**, the **meridian waters** congeal and weep; when **Heaven is scorching and Earth hot**, the **meridian waters** boil and overflow; when **sudden winds rage**, the **meridian waters** surge and rise in waves. The **human meridians** likewise respond.

When **evil** enters the **pulses**, cold causes the blood to congeal and weep, while heat makes the **qi** pure and moist. If **emptiness-evil** seizes the opportunity to invade, it is like the **meridian waters** encountering wind—when the **pulses move**, they also rise and fall at times, flowing smoothly within the **meridians**, smoothly, smoothly—moving in accordance with the **meridian’s** ebb and flow, following the rhythm of inhalation and exhalation, though their form may vary.

When it reaches the **cun-kou** of the **middle hand**, it is sometimes large, sometimes small. When large, **evil** has arrived; when small, it is balanced. Its course has no fixed location—large refers to the **pulse’s** usual diagnostic form, while small does not mean fine, but rather, in comparison to large, it is called small. If there is no large for comparison, then it is merely the ordinary **meridian qi**.

However, **evil qi** follows **yin qi** into **yin meridians** and **yang qi** into **yang meridians**, hence its course has no fixed location. Whether in **yin** or **yang**, it cannot be measured, for it follows the **meridian’s** flow. By observing it, the **three regions and nine candidates**—if suddenly encountered—must be pressed and halted, met and drained. When the path is cut off, the **great evil qi** cannot prevail.

What is meant by *draining*? As the later text states: *"Inhale and insert the needle, ensuring the **qi** does not disperse; remain still and dwell, preventing **evil** from spreading. Exhale and turn the needle, taking **qi** as the criterion. Wait for exhalation to withdraw, and when fully exhaled, depart. Thus, the **great qi** is fully released, hence it is called draining."*

According to the **meridian’s** principle, one must first **supplement true qi** before draining **evil**. How so? The later **supplementation method** states: *"When exhalation is complete, insert the needle and dwell still."* In this **draining method**, *"Inhale and insert the needle, then dwell still."* Though the timing of inhalation and exhalation differs—when inhaling, there is no exhalation—since the moment of insertion and the duration of dwelling are the same, the priority of **supplementation** becomes clear.

The *Needle Classic* says: *"Draining is called welcoming—holding the needle crosswise and inserting it, releasing and withdrawing it, expelling **yang** with the needle, allowing **evil qi** to escape."* **Supplementation** is called following—like forgetting, like moving forward, like repenting, like the buzzing of a mosquito, like lingering and returning. Thus, **supplementation** involves prolonged dwelling with the needle.

The reason **supplementation** comes first is that if **true qi** is insufficient, the needle will drain it, leaving the **meridian** unfilled. If **evil qi** has no outlet to expel, **supplementation** must first fortify **true qi** before draining **evil**.

*Withdraw* means to draw out; *depart* means to leave the **acupoint**. When exhalation is complete, withdraw to the **acupoint’s** threshold, and when fully exhaled, leave the **acupoint’s** gate. Thus, the **meridian qi** settles and stabilizes, and **evil qi** has no place to linger, so the **great evil qi** follows the needle outward.

*Exhalation* refers to **qi** exiting; *inhalation* refers to **qi** entering; *turning* means manipulating the needle. **Great qi** refers to the **great evil qi** that disrupts **yin** and **yang**.

The **Emperor** asked: *"How does one supplement when there is deficiency?"*

**Qi Bo** replied: *"One must first palpate and trace it, press and disperse it, push and press it, tap and agitate it, grasp and lower it, connect and take it, externally drawing its threshold to seal its **spirit**."*

*Palpate and trace* means to touch with the hand. *Press* means to press with the fingers. *Palpate and trace* seeks to relax the **qi**; *press and disperse* makes the **meridians** propagate. *Push and press* compresses the skin; *tap and agitate* makes the **pulse qi** taut. *Grasp and lower* prepares the needle’s placement. *Connect and take* follows the standard method. *Externally drawing its threshold* is the same as *pushing and pressing*—compressing the skin outside the **acupoint** so that when the needle is removed, the unbroken skin remains. The **acupoint’s** gate, if left unopened, allows the **spirit qi** to retreat inward, hence it is said to *seal its spirit*.

The *Regulating the Meridians* text states: *"Externally draw the skin, aligning it with its gate."* It also says: *"Push and close its gate, preserving the **spirit qi**."* This is what is meant.

The *newly corrected text* notes: *"According to Wang’s citation of the *Regulating the Meridians* text, it is now clear that this is not the original text but appears in the *Needle Methods* section of the *Jia Yi Jing*. The following lines are from the current passage."* *Palpate* is pronounced *mén*. *Grasp* is pronounced *xiè jiāo qiè*.

*"When exhalation is complete, insert the needle and dwell still, taking **qi’s** arrival as the reason for withdrawal."* Though *exhalation* is also akin to *inhalation*, it means that withdrawal must wait until **qi** arrives, not based on the number of breaths. The *Needle Classic* says: *"If **qi** does not arrive upon insertion, do not ask how many times; if **qi** arrives upon insertion, withdraw without reinserting."* The key is not the speed of breaths but ensuring **qi** arrives before needle withdrawal, not removing the needle prematurely while **qi** is still absent.

---

*"This is the text of the current chapter. **Mén** [palpate] is pronounced *mén*. **Zhuā** [grasp] is pronounced *xiè jiāo qiè* [sidelong, exchange, and stop].

*'When exhalation is complete, insert the needle and remain motionless, taking **qi’s** arrival as the reason for withdrawal.'* Though *exhalation* is also akin to *inhalation*, it means that withdrawal must await **qi’s** arrival, not the count of breaths. The *Needle Classic* states: *'If **qi** does not arrive upon insertion, do not question its number; if **qi** arrives upon insertion, withdraw without reinserting.'* Thus, the essence lies not in the pace of breaths but in ensuring **qi** arrives before needle removal, lest one withdraw prematurely while **qi** remains absent.*

---

**Translation:**

*"Like awaiting a precious guest, one does not know when evening comes—
this instructs practitioners to observe **qi’s** movements.
*Mù* [evening] means *late*.
When **qi** arrives, adjust and guard it,
*shì* [adjust] meaning to regulate harmoniously,
*hù* [guard] meaning to take heed.
It says: when **qi** has settled and balanced,
one must guard it carefully,
lest it shift and the ailment recur.
The *Needle Classic* says:
*'When **qi** has arrived, guard it and do not lose it.'*
This is its meaning.
What is meant by *guard it carefully* shall be explained as follows.

*Newly corrected text states*: Upon examining the *Needle Classic*’s words,
this is the text from the *Essential Life, Complete Form* chapter of the *Plain Questions*,
also found in the *Needle Resolution* chapter.
*Observing inhalation and withdrawing the needle*,
**qi** must not escape,
each remaining in its place.
Pushing and closing the orifice,
one ensures the *shénqi* [spirit-qi] remains,
the *dàqì* [great-qi] lingering—
thus it is called *bǔ* [supplementation].
This is the correct terminology.
When the outer orifice is sealed,
the *shénqi* [spirit-qi] returns,
*observing inhalation and withdrawing the needle*,
the *dàqì* [great-qi] does not leak—
the meaning of *supplementation* is thus clearly understood.
Yet this *dàqì* [great-qi] refers to the **qi** circulating through the major channels,
governing the *róng* [nutritive] and *wèi* [defensive].
The Emperor asked: *'How does one observe **qi**?'*
This means: how does one discern the **qi** that can be taken?
Gěibó [Master Gui] replied:
*'The pathogenic factor departs from the collateral vessels and enters the channels,
dwelling within the blood vessels.*
The *Miscellaneous Needling* chapter says:
*'When the pathogenic factor lodges in the body,
it first settles in the skin and fur,
lingering but not departing,
then enters and settles in the muscle layer,
lingering but not departing,
then enters and settles in the collateral vessels,
lingering but not departing,
finally entering and settling in the channel vessels.'*
Thus it is said: *'The pathogenic factor departs from the collateral vessels and enters the channels.'*
Its cold and heat have not yet harmonized,
like waves surging up—
sometimes present, sometimes absent,
thus not always lingering.
Since it circulates through the sixteen *zàngfǔ* [viscera-organ] channels,
measuring sixteen *cùn* [inch] and two *chǐ* [foot],
it does not always remain where it is observed.
Thus it is said:
*'When it arrives, one must press and halt it,
halt and take it,
lest one encounter its surge and drain it.'*
*Chōng* [surge] refers to the **qi** aligned with the *shuǐxià* [water clock]’s divisions.
The *Spiritual Pivot* says:
*'One *kè* [division] after the water clock strikes,
the **qi** of the body is in the *Tàiyáng* [Greater Yang] channel;
two *kè* after the water clock strikes,
the **qi** of the body is in the *Shàoyáng* [Lesser Yang] channel;
three *kè* after the water clock strikes,
the **qi** of the body is in the *Yángmíng* [Yang Brightness] channel;
four *kè* after the water clock strikes,
the **qi** of the body is in the *Yīnfèn* [Yin Division].'*
When **qi** is in the *Tàiyáng* [Greater Yang] channel,
the *Tàiyáng* [Greater Yang] channel alone is flourishing;
when **qi** is in the *Shàoyáng* [Lesser Yang] channel,
the *Shàoyáng* [Lesser Yang] channel alone is flourishing.
If one sees a channel flourishing alone,
one mistakenly assumes the pathogenic factor has arrived,
and drains it with the needle—
this will instead harm the *zhēnqì* [true/essential **qi**].
Thus the text continues:
*'True **qi** is the channel **qi**;
when the channel **qi** is greatly depleted,
it is said that its arrival cannot be encountered—
this is the meaning.'*
If the channel **qi** aligns with the *shuǐxià* [water clock]’s divisions,
and one mistakenly assumes it is the pathogenic factor,
then draining it will lead to great error—
thus it is said: *'Its arrival cannot be encountered.'*
Hence it is said:
*'If one fails to discern the pathogenic factor,
the true **qi** has already passed,
draining it will cause the true **qi** to escape,
and once escaped, it will not return;
the pathogenic factor will return,
and the disease will worsen—
if one does not realize the pathogenic factor’s return,
and instead drains the innocent true **qi**,
the true **qi** will escape,
the pathogenic factor will re-invade,
the channel **qi** will be greatly depleted—
thus the disease worsens and accumulates.'*
Thus it is said: *'Once it departs, it cannot be recalled.'*
After it has followed the channel’s flow and gone,
it cannot be summoned back again.

*It cannot be 'hooked' to trigger [needling]*
means that one must wait for the pathogenic factor’s arrival before needling and draining.
If even a slight and subtle presence is known,
how much more so when **qi** surges like waves—
one cannot know its arrival.

*Whether earlier or later*
refers to when the blood and **qi** are already depleted—
the disease cannot be treated.
It means: if one takes **qi** when it should not be taken,
one has missed the timing.
*The newly corrected text states*: According to Quányuán’s original,
*jìn* [exhausted] should be *xū* [depleted].
The character *jìn* is a mistake for *xū*.
Thus it is said:
*'One who knows the timing of **qi’s** arrival, like a trigger,
one who does not know the timing, like knocking on a drum—
it does not respond.'*
Thus it is said:
*'One who understands the **qi’s** mechanism cannot fail to trigger it;
one who does not understand the **qi’s** mechanism will knock but fail to trigger it.'*
The *mechanism* refers to the subtle movements—
it emphasizes knowing its subtleties.

The Emperor asked: *'How does one supplement or drain?'*
Gěibó [Master Gui] replied:
*'This is attacking the pathogenic factor—
rapidly draining to remove excess blood,
and restoring the true **qi**.
One drains only when blood is present.
This is when the pathogenic factor has newly lodged,
dissipating but not yet settled.
Pushing it makes it advance,
withdrawing it makes it halt.
If one needles against its flow,
it warms the blood.'*
It means:
when the pathogenic factor has newly lodged,
not yet settled in a fixed location,
if one pushes the needle to supplement,
it will advance along with the supplementation;
if one withdraws the needle to guide it,
it will remain where the needle is directed.
If one does not drain the excess blood
but instead warms it,
the pathogenic factor will internally prevail and worsen its harm—
thus the text continues:
*'Draining its blood will make the disease vanish immediately.'*
The Emperor said: *'Excellent.'*
Yet when true **qi** and pathogenic factor are harmonized,
no waves or surges arise—
how does one observe it?
Gěibó [Master Gui] replied:
*'Discern the palpation of the three divisions and nine regions,
adjusting according to their fullness or depletion—
this is the method.
Drain the full, supplement the depleted;
when neither full nor depleted,
use the channel’s standard to take it.
Examine the left, right, above, and below—
where **qi** is lost or concealed—
discern the disease’s hiding place and await it.
If **qi** is in the *Yīnfèn* [Yin Division],
observe its presence in the *Yīnfèn* [Yin Division] before needling;
if **qi** is in the *Yángfèn* [Yang Division],
observe its presence in the *Yángfèn* [Yang Division] before needling—
this is called *encountering the timing*.
The *Spiritual Pivot* says:
*'One *kè* [division] after the water clock strikes,
the **qi** of the body is in the *Tàiyáng* [Greater Yang] channel;
four *kè* after the water clock strikes,
the **qi** of the body is in the *Yīnfèn* [Yin Division].'*
If the divisions accumulate without ceasing,
the **qi** will follow accordingly,
cycling and beginning anew.
Thus one must discern the disease’s hiding place,
await its **qi**, and then needle it.

If one does not know the three divisions,
the *Yin* and *Yang* are not distinguished,
the *Heaven* and *Earth* are not separated.
The *Earth* must be observed as *Earth*,
the *Heaven* as *Heaven*,
and the *Human* as the *Human*—
adjusting at the *Zhōngfǔ* [Middle Region],
to establish the three divisions.
Thus it is said:
*'If one needles without knowing
the three divisions and nine regions,
the location of the disease and pulse,
even if the **qi** is greatly excessive,
the practitioner cannot restrain it.'*"*

The **Dao** of *inhibition* refers to restraining the **qi**.

Yet if one still cannot discern where the malevolent **qi** resides,
how could one ever restrain its malevolent **qi**?

If the *Zhūfá* [punishment of a grain] is without excess,
it is called *Dàhuò* [Great Confusion].
If one disturbs the great channels,
the true **qi** cannot be restored,
using the solid as the void,
taking the malevolent as the true.
If one needles without proper principle,
one becomes a thief of **qi**,
plundering the patient’s vital **qi**.
If one treats what is *fù* [supplementary] as *nì* [inverse],
the *Róngwèi* [Nutritive and Defensive] **qi** will scatter in disorder,
the true **qi** already lost,
while the malevolent **qi** lingers within.
This cuts off the patient’s longevity,
bringing early misfortune.

Ignorance of the three divisions and nine regions is long-lasting.
Without keen discernment of what is false,
without thorough learning of what is true,
one will disturb the great channels,
become a thief of **qi**,
and cause harm with every move—
how could one endure?

If one does not grasp the harmonization of the four seasons and five phases,
and follows their mutual overcoming,
releasing the malevolent to attack the true,
it will cut off the patient’s longevity.
It is not only ignorance of the three divisions and nine regions that is harmful—
if one does not know the sequence of the four seasons and five phases’ **qi**,
it is also enough to damage and cut off the patient’s life.

When the malevolent **qi** arrives as a new guest,
its dwelling place is not yet fixed.
Push it and it advances,
draw it and it halts,
encounter it and release it,
and the disease will immediately cease.

This principle must be repeated.

**Discussion on Diagnosing Empty and Full States**

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What does 'empty' and 'full' refer to?"*

Qibo replied: *"When pathogenic *qi* is excessive, it is 'full'; when vital *qi* is depleted, it is 'empty.'*
*'Depleted' means the vital *qi* is diminished, as if taken away."*

The Emperor said: *"How do 'empty' and 'full' manifest?"*
*(Referring to the general principles of the five *zàng* organs' empty and full states.)*

Qibo said: *"When *qi* is empty, the lungs are empty; when *qi* is reversed, the feet are cold. If it occurs outside its proper season, life follows; if it occurs in its proper season, death follows.*
*'Outside its proper season' refers to the years before or after the prime of life.*
*'In its proper season' refers to the prime years.*
*The other organs follow the same principle. The five *zàng* behave uniformly."*

The Emperor asked: *"What is meant by 'compound fullness'?"*

Qibo replied: *"By 'compound fullness,' we mean severe febrile disease, where *qi* is hot and the pulse is full. This is called 'compound fullness.'"*

The Emperor asked: *"If both the *jing* channels and *luò* collaterals are full, how does this present, and how should it be treated?"*

Qibo replied: *"When both *jing* and *luò* are full, the pulse at the *cùn* (wrist) is taut while the *chǐ* (ankle) is relaxed. All such cases must be treated accordingly.*
*Thus, 'slippery' follows the natural order, while 'rough' is contrary.*
*'Taut' refers to a slippery pulse at the mouth.*
*In matters of empty and full, all begin with their inherent nature.*
*Therefore, when the five *zàng* and their tissues are smooth and free-flowing, longevity follows.*
*When things are born, they are smooth and free-flowing; when they die, they become withered and rough. Hence, 'rough' is contrary, while 'smooth' follows the natural order.*
*'Follows' means 'in harmony.'"*

The Emperor asked: *"If the *luò* collaterals are deficient while the *jing* channels are excessive, how does this present?"*

Qibo replied: *"When the *luò* collaterals are deficient while the *jing* channels are excessive, the pulse at the mouth is hot while the *chǐ* is cold.*
*This is contrary in autumn and winter but harmonious in spring and summer, and treatment should focus on the disease.*
*Since *yang* *qi* ascends in spring and summer, a hot pulse at the mouth with cold at the *chǐ* is harmonious.*
*The twelve *jing* channels and fifteen *luò* collaterals each have excess or deficiency on the left and right sides. The practitioner must locate their precise condition to apply acupuncture or moxibustion accordingly. Hence, it is said, 'treatment focuses on the disease.'"*

The Emperor asked: *"If the *jing* channels are empty while the *luò* collaterals are full, how does this present?"*

Qibo replied: *"When the *jing* channels are empty while the *luò* collaterals are full, the *chǐ* pulse is hot and full, while the mouth pulse is cold and rough. This leads to death in spring and summer but survival in autumn and winter.*
*In autumn and winter, *yang* *qi* descends, hence the hot pulse at the *chǐ*. Cold is harmonious."*

The Emperor asked: *"How should this be treated?"*

Qibo replied: *"When the *luò* collaterals are full and the *jing* channels are empty, moxibustion is applied to *yin* and acupuncture to *yang*; when the *jing* channels are full and the *luò* collaterals are empty, acupuncture is applied to *yin* and moxibustion to *yang*.*
*This is because the *yin* division governs the *luò* collaterals, while the *yang* division governs the *jing* channels."*

The Emperor asked: *"What is meant by 'compound emptiness'?"*
*(This reverses the earlier discussion on 'compound fullness.')*

Qibo replied: *"When the pulse *qi* is empty at the *cùn* and *chǐ*, this is called 'compound emptiness.'*
*(Referring to both the *cùn* and *chǐ* pulses being empty.)*
*The newly corrected text states: According to the *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng*, it reads 'pulse empty, *qi* empty, *chǐ* empty—this is called compound emptiness.' This text omits one 'empty' and adds an 'above.'*
*Wang Bing’s annotation states that both *cùn* and *chǐ* pulses are empty, but this does not include *qi* emptiness.*
*Detailed earlier: In febrile disease, hot *qi* and a full pulse constitute compound fullness. Here, empty pulse and empty *qi* at the *chǐ* constitute compound emptiness. Thus, when both pulse and *qi* are full, it is compound fullness; when both are empty, it is compound emptiness—not merely when both *cùn* and *chǐ* are empty."*

The Emperor asked: *"How should this be treated?"*

Qibo replied: *"By 'empty *qi*,' we mean instability. When the *chǐ* is empty, walking feels unsteady.*
*When the *cùn* is empty, the pulse moves erratically; when the *chǐ* is empty, walking is labored and insufficient.*
*The newly corrected text states: According to Yang Shangshan, 'empty *qi* refers to an unstable constitution from birth.'*
*Wang Bing’s claim that an empty *cùn* pulse moves erratically is incorrect.*
*'Empty pulse' means it does not conform to *yin*.*
*It does not conform to the signs of *Tài Yīn*.*
*How do we know?*
*The *qi* mouth is the pulse’s critical junction, the movement of *Shǒu Tài Yīn*.*
*In such cases, slippery leads to survival, rough leads to death."*

The Emperor asked: *"If cold *qi* suddenly surges upward, causing a full and solid pulse, how does this present?"*
*(Referring to hot *qi* and a full pulse, which was already described as compound fullness—slippery follows the natural order, rough is contrary. Now, if cold *qi* causes a full pulse, can it also be called compound fullness? How does this affect slippery/rough and life/death?)*

Qibo replied: *"If fullness is slippery, life follows; if fullness is contrary, death follows.*
*'Contrary' means 'rough.'*
*The newly corrected text states: Wang Bing’s claim that 'contrary' means 'rough' is greatly incorrect.*
*Ancient texts are concise, with frequent parallel phrasing. Earlier, 'slippery' was mentioned, and now 'contrary' is stated. From 'slippery follows,' it is clear that 'contrary' refers to 'rough,' not that 'contrary' means 'rough.'"*

The Emperor asked: *"If the pulse is full and solid, with cold hands and feet but a hot head, how does this present?"*

Qibo replied: *"In spring and autumn, life follows; in winter and summer, death follows.*
*Generally, cold hands and feet in summer are not illness but result from summer following winter’s order—if caught in summer, death follows in winter.*
*In winter, a full and solid pulse with a hot head is not illness but results from winter following summer’s order—if caught in winter, death follows in summer.*
*Reversing winter and summer, none would die. Only when contracted in spring and autumn—true illness—does survival follow.*
*Death occurs in the first month of the respective season.*
*If the pulse is floating and rough, with the body hot, death follows."*

*The newly corrected text states: According to the *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng*, this passage was misplaced in the original text, appearing later under the Emperor’s question on 'form, bone, pulse, and sinew measurements—how do we know their degrees?' The meaning does not align. Wang Bing recognized the error but did not know that Huangfu Shian had previously relocated it here. Now, this passage is removed from its later position and inserted here.*

The Emperor asked: *"What if the entire body is swollen and full?"*

Qìbó said: *"When the entire body is swollen and full, the pulse is taut, large, and rigid, with a rough *cù* at the *chǐ* position that does not respond to pressure.
'Form entirely full' means the four limbs and internal organs are fully distended."*

*The newly corrected text states: According to the *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng* and *Tàisū*, *cù* (rough) was originally written as *mǎn* (full).*

*"In such cases, if the condition aligns with the Dao, life follows; if it opposes, death follows."*

The Emperor asked: *"What does it mean for the condition to align with the Dao and thus lead to life, or oppose it and lead to death?"*

Qìbó said: *"When the hands and feet are warm, that is alignment with the Dao. When the hands and feet are cold, that is opposition."*

The Emperor asked: *"For an infant suffering from heat illness, with a pulse that moves like a suspended object—what is the prognosis?"*
*Suspended* refers to the pulse’s movement as if something were hanging and swaying.

Qìbó said: *"If the hands and feet are warm, life follows; if cold, death follows."*

*The newly corrected text states: According to the *Tàisū*, the character 'hand' is omitted here. Yang Shàngshàn commented: 'When the feet are warm, *qi* descends, and thus life follows; when the feet are cold, *qi* does not descend, leading to opposition and death.'*

The Emperor asked: *"For an infant struck by wind-heat, with wheezing, grunting, and shouldered breathing—what is the pulse like?"*

Qìbó said: *"One who wheezes, grunts, and breathes with shouldered effort has a full, large pulse. If it is relaxed, life follows; if taut, death follows."*
*Relaxed* refers to the pulse’s movement as if slackened.
*Taut* refers to the pulse’s tension like a drawn string.

The pulse’s urgency is not merely about the coming and going.

*The *Zhènglǐ Shānghàn Lùn* states: "Relaxed (pulse) indicates wind-heat invasion."* Hence, for an infant struck by wind-heat, a relaxed pulse means life follows, while a taut pulse means death follows.

The Emperor asked: *"For intestinal obstruction with bloody stools—what is the prognosis?"*

Qìbó said: *"If the body is hot, death follows; if cold, life follows. Heat signifies the corruption of blood, hence death; cold signifies the *hóngqì* (nutritive *qi*) remains intact, hence life."*

The Emperor asked: *"For intestinal obstruction with white froth—what is the prognosis?"*

Qìbó said: *"If the pulse is deep, life follows; if the pulse is superficial, death follows. This is an instance where an yin-disease presents with yang-pulse features, contrary to the symptoms, hence death follows."*

The Emperor asked: *"For intestinal obstruction with pus and blood—what is the prognosis?"*

Qìbó said: *"If the pulse is suspended and severed, death follows; if it is smooth and large, life follows."*

The Emperor asked: *"For cases of intestinal obstruction where the body is not hot and the pulse is neither suspended nor severed—what is the prognosis?"*

Qìbó said: *"If the pulse is smooth and large, life follows; if it is suspended and rough, death follows. This is determined by the *zàng* (viscera). When the liver presents with *gēngxīn* (regeneration) signs, death follows; when the heart presents with *rén guǐ* (kidney-related) signs, death follows; when the lung presents with *bǐngdīng* (third and fourth heavenly stems) signs, death follows; when the kidney presents with *wùjǐ* (fourth and fifth heavenly stems) signs, death follows; when the spleen presents with *jiǎyǐ* (first and second heavenly stems) signs, death follows. This is called determining by the *zàng* (viscera)."*

The Emperor asked: *"For epilepsy—what is the prognosis?"*

Qìbó said: *"If the pulse is large and smooth, the disease may subside over time; if the pulse is small, firm, and urgent, death follows and it is untreatable. A small, firm, and urgent pulse signifies yin, and when a yang-disease presents with yin-pulse features, death follows and it is untreatable."*

*The newly corrected text states: According to Cháo Yuánfāng, it reads: "If the pulse is deep, small, and urgent, death follows and it is untreatable; if the pulse is small and taut, it is also untreatable."*

The Emperor asked: *"For epilepsy, how do the pulse’s vacuity and repletion manifest?"*

Qìbó said: *"If the pulse is vacuous, it may be treated; if replete, death follows. This is because the features are contrary."*

The Emperor asked: *"For wasting diseases (due to damp-heat) in vacuity and repletion—what is the prognosis?"*

Qìbó said: *"If the pulse is replete and large, though the disease is long-standing, it may be treated; if the pulse is suspended, small, and firm, though the disease is long-standing, it is untreatable. In chronic illness, blood and *qi* are weakened; if the pulse does not correspond to being replete and large, treatment is ineffective."*

*The newly corrected text states: Examining the *Jīng* (Classical Canon), it says that a replete and large pulse in chronic illness may be treated, but this is noted as incorrect. According to *Jiǎyǐ Jīng*, *Tàisū*, and Quán Yuánqǐ’s original text, it states that it may be treated. Additionally, according to Cháo Yuánfāng, it reads: "If the pulse is rapid and large, life follows; if it is fine, small, and superficial, death follows." It also states: "If the pulse is deep and small, life follows; if it is replete, firm, and large, death follows."*

*The term *zhàng* (瘴) is pronounced *tú dān* (徒丹), meaning damp-heat disease.*

The Emperor asked: *"How do we discern the extent of disease in form, bones, pulse, and sinews?"*

The extent of form is detailed in *Sānbèi Jīng*; the extent of sinews, pulse, and bones are found in *Língshū Jīng*. This inquiry also belongs at the beginning of those canonical treatises, suggesting an error in text arrangement. One version of the *Jīng* (Canon) places this question as the beginning of *Nìcóng Lùn* (Discourse on Contrary and Conformity), which is incorrect.

The Emperor asked: *"In spring, we urgently treat the *jīngluò* (channels and collaterals); in summer, we urgently treat the *jīngshù* (acupuncture points); in autumn, we urgently treat the six *fǔ* (organs); in winter, we close and seal the body. When the body is closed and sealed, why do we still use acupuncture and moxibustion for diseases like *tānzhù* (paralytic disorders) and *yǒngjū* (abscesses)?"*

*Urgent* here means *rapid or intense*. *Closed and sealed* refers to the *qi* pathways being obstructed. The phrase *use acupuncture and moxibustion sparingly* does not refer to *tānzhù* (paralytic disorders) and *yǒngjū* (abscesses). Even in winter, when the *qi* pathways are closed and sealed, diseases like *tānzhù* and *yǒngjū* are severe, with internal formation of large abscesses. If not urgently treated with acupuncture and moxibustion to release them, sinews will be eroded and bones will rot, so even in winter, these diseases should be treated with acupuncture and moxibustion to open and release them. *Tānzhù* diseases do not resolve quickly.

Why, then, can diseases like *tānzhù* and *yǒngjū* still be treated with acupuncture and moxibustion in winter? This is because these diseases require urgent release; if not treated promptly, the abscesses will penetrate and erode the sinews and bones, piercing through the *zàngfǔ* (viscera and organs). *Tānzhù* is characterized by indeterminate pain, and pressing it does not yield a clear response. The pain appears and disappears unpredictably. Treat by needling *Shǒu Tàiyáng Jīngluò* (hand lesser yang channels) beside the *sānlěi* (three interstices) and *yīngmài* (sinew vessels) on both sides, three times each.

If *tānzhù* manifests as intense heat, treat by needling *Zú Shǎoyáng* (foot lesser yang) at *wǔ* (five), three times. If the heat persists after needling, treat by needling *Shǒu Xīnmǎo* (hand heart vessel) at *sānlěi* (three interstices) and the *jīngluò* (channels) of *Shǒu Tàiyīn* (hand greater yin) at *dàgǔ* (great bone), three times each. *Dàgǔ* refers to the shoulder, specifically the *jiānzhēn* (shoulder acumen) point, located in the depression posterior to the shoulder joint.

For sudden *tānzhù* with sinew displacement, where pain follows the channels, and the *pòhàn* (ghostly sweat) does not cease while *bāoqì* (uterine *qi*) is insufficient, treatment is applied to the *jīngshù* (acupuncture points). If *tānzhù* erupts suddenly, pain follows the channels, sinews become inflamed, and channels tense; flesh between the sinews aches, sweat seeps as if not fully exhausted, and there is *bāoqì* (uterine *qi*) insufficiency, all may be treated by supplementing and releasing the acupuncture points along the affected channels.

*The newly corrected text states: These two conditions were previously scattered in the text; now they are moved to align accordingly.*

For sudden abdominal distension, pressing does not relieve it. Treat by needling the *jīngluò* (channels) of *Shǒu Tàiyáng* (hand greater yang), which is the *mù* (gathering) point of the stomach. *Shǒu Tàiyáng* refers to the hand greater yang channel, and the *jīngluò* (channels) of this channel generate (the disease) at *zhōngyuàn* (middle courtyard), which is the stomach’s *mù* (gathering) point. *The Zhōnggào* (Middle Announcement) states: *"The middle courtyard is the stomach’s gathering point, located between the ribs and the umbilicus, where the hand greater yang and lesser yang, and foot greater yang channels converge."* Hence, it is called the *jīngluò* (channels) of the stomach’s *mù* (gathering) point.

*The newly corrected text states: According to *Jiǎyǐ Jīng*, it reads: "Needling the hand greater yang channel’s *jīngluò* (channels) and blood releases the disease. It lacks the phrase ‘the stomach’s gathering point, etc.’ Additionally, Yang Shàngshàn’s annotation states ‘foot greater yang.’ Their explanations differ, and it is unclear which is correct."*

For the *Shǎoyīn* (lesser yin) point, three inches lateral to the spine, treat by needling the two adjacent points five times each with a sharp, thin needle. The *Shǎoyīn* point refers to the two points beside the 14th vertebra, which is the *shù* (acupuncture point) of the kidney.

*The newly corrected text states: According to *Jiǎyǐ Jīng*, it reads: "Use a sharp, thin needle. After needling, the patient stands for as long as eating a meal, then cross-check by needling the points where the channel passes through the yang region, several times."*

For **cholera** (*huòluàn*), needle the *shù* (acupuncture point) and its adjacent points five times. For cholera, the *Shǎoyīn* *shù* and the *Zhìshì* point beside it are selected.

○ *Newly corrected text states*: According to Yang Shàngshàn, "For cholera, needle the *shù* and its five adjacent points. For the *foot Yangming* channel, take three points above as well." The *foot Yangming* refers to the *stomach shù*. Selecting the *stomach shù* also includes the third point upward from the two lateral points beside the *Shǎoyīn shù*—this is the *stomach倉* (*Cāng*) point.

Needle the *xiǎojīng mài* (surprise pulse) five times—this refers to *Yanglíngquán*, located in the depression above the outer side of the knee. Needle the *hand Taiyin* channel five times, the *foot Taiyang* channel five times, and the lateral branches of the *hand Shǎoyīn* channel once, the *foot Yangming* channel once, inserting three needles five *cù* above the ankle. The *foot Taiyang* refers to the *foot Greater Yang* channel. Needling the *hand Taiyin* five times refers to the *Yújì* point, located on the inner side of the base of the thumb, where the dispersing pulse lies. Needling the *foot Taiyang* five times refers to the *Chéngshān* point, located in the depression between the muscles at the back of the heel. The lateral branches of the *hand Shǎoyīn* channel refer to the *Zhīzhèng* point, five *cù* above the wrist crease, where the muscle divides at the edge of the ulna—this is where the *hand Shaoyang* collateral diverges toward the *hand Shǎoyīn*. The *foot Yangming* point refers to the *Jiěxī* point, located in the depression above the ankle. Five *cù* above the ankle refers to the *Guāngmíng* point of the *foot Shaoyang* collateral.

According to *The Inner Canon’s Bright Hall* and *The Central Edict Acupuncture Atlas*, all are said to treat cholera, with clear textual evidence. ○ *Newly corrected text states*: According to another edition’s annotation, none are said to treat cholera—its meaning remains unclear. Additionally, according to *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* and *Tàisù*, needling the *xiǎojīng mài* five times is for treating *jīngjué* (convulsive spasm), while Wang’s annotation claims it is for cholera—Wang’s annotation is incorrect.

In general, treating **consumption** (□), **striking illness** (*pūjī*), **hemiplegia** (*piāngkū*), **flaccid paralysis** (*wěijué*), **gastric distension with inverted flow** (*qìmǎn fǎinì*), **obesity in the wealthy** (*féiguìrén*—*gāoliáng* illness), **blockage** (*gé*) leads to obstruction and stagnation, causing upper and lower disconnection—this is the disease of **sudden grief** (*bàoyōu*). Sudden **syncope** (*jué*) with deafness, **unilateral obstruction** (*piānsè*), and **closure** (*bì*) occur when internal *qi* suddenly weakens. Diseases not arising from internal or external **wind** (*fēng*) linger and persist. **Foot lameness** (*zhǐbó*) is caused by cold, wind, and dampness. **Consumption** refers to internal **consumption** (*xiāo*). □ refers to **latent heat** (*fúrè*). **Syncope** (*jué*) refers to **inverted *qi*** (*qìnì*), **high** (*gāo*) meaning **grease** (*gāo*), and **liáng** meaning **rice** (*liáng*). **Foot** (*zhǐ*) refers to the foot.

The obese accumulate **internal heat** (*rèzhōng*), and those who consume too much sweetness accumulate **central fullness** (*zhōngmǎn*). Thus, when heat-*qi* invades internally, it manifests as **consumption**, **hemiplegia**, **gastric distension**, and **inverted flow**. **Inverted** (*nì*) means contrary to normal conditions, differing from the common person. However, those afflicted by **grief and worry** have *qi* that is blocked and stagnant, leading to **obstruction** (*gé*), **closure** (*sè*), and **blockage** (*bì*), causing *qi* and pulses to be severed, resulting in upper and lower disconnection. When *qi* is fixed internally, **urination and defecation** become **unilateral and obstructed**.

Why? Because the **viscera and storage organs** fail to transform and disperse *qi*—thus it is so.

「When **external wind** invades a person, if the **latent pathogenic factors** (*fǔzàng*) do not disperse, the **yang-qi** internally suffers, causing **heat to surface externally** (*rè wài fān*). Thus, it lingers in the **fleshy layers**, leading to **consumption** (*xiāo*), while the **skin and muscles adhere to the bones** (*pífū zhuó yú jīngǔ*).

If **dampness** prevails in the **foot**, the **sinews** become inflexible; if **cold** prevails in the **foot**, they contract and spasm. When **wind, dampness, and cold** dominate, the **defensive-qi** (*wèiqì*) becomes **congested and clustered** (*jiéjù*), and this congestion causes **muscle pain**, resulting in **limping** (*bó*) and an inability to walk. *Dì* means the sole of the foot, as if cut by a stone.

The **Yellow Emperor** said: **"Jaundice and sudden pain**, **epilepsy and madness**, and **prolonged inverted flow** (*jiǔnì*) are all generated by this. When the **Five Viscera** are unbalanced and the **Six Storage Organs** are obstructed, these diseases arise. Thus, **headaches and ringing in the ears**, along with **the nine orifices** being inflexible, are manifestations of the **intestines and stomach** (*chángwèi*).

The **Three Yang meridians of the foot** (*zú sān yáng*) travel from the head down to the foot, but if **prolonged inverted flow** persists and does not descend, the *qi* accumulates in the **upper burner** (*shàngjiāo*), causing **jaundice and sudden pain**, **epilepsy and madness**, and **inverted flow of the *qi*** (*qìnì*). When **diet and drink** are **improper** (*shíyǐn shīyí*), and **vomiting and diarrhea** exceed **moderation** (*tǔlì guòjié*), the **Six Storage Organs** become obstructed, and the **Five Viscera’s *qi*** fails to harmonize.

When the **intestines and stomach** are **blocked and congested** (*pǐsè*), the *qi* does not flow in sequence. If the *qi* does not flow in sequence, the **upper, lower, internal, and external** regions mutually **overpower and counter** (*hùxiāng shèngfú*), causing **headaches and ringing in the ears**, along with **the nine orifices** being inflexible.

**Discussion on the *Tàiyīn-Yángmíng* Theory** (*Lùn piān*): The **spleen (viscera)** and **stomach (storage organ)**, both belonging to the **Earth element** (*tǔ*), though their functions differ, are interconnected. Thus, their diseases present differently, and so their inquiries diverge.

**Qíbó** replied: "When **yin and yang are displaced** (*yīnyáng yìwèi*), they alternately manifest as **excess and deficiency** (*gēngxū gēngshí*), **inversion and compliance** (*gēngnì gēngcóng*). Sometimes they originate from within, sometimes from without—since their paths differ, the diseases bear distinct names.

The **spleen (viscera)** belongs to **yin**, and the **stomach (storage organ)** belongs to **yang**. The **yang meridians** descend, while the **yin meridians** ascend; the **yang meridians** course externally, and the **yin meridians** course internally. Thus, it is said that since their paths differ, the diseases bear distinct names.

**Newly Corrected Annotation** (*xīnjiāozhèng yún*) states: According to **Yáng Shàngshàn**, in **spring and summer**, **Yángmíng** is **excess** (*shí*), and **Tàiyīn** is **deficient** (*xū*). In **autumn and winter**, **Tàiyīn** becomes **excess**, and **Yángmíng** becomes **deficient**. This is the alternation of **excess and deficiency** (*gēngshí gēngxū*).

In **spring and summer**, **Tàiyīn** is **inverted** (*nì*), and **Yángmíng** is **compliant** (*cóng*); in **autumn and winter**, **Yángmíng** is **inverted**, and **Tàiyīn** is **compliant**. This is the alternation of **inversion and compliance** (*gēngnì gēngcóng*).

The **Yellow Emperor** said: "I wish to hear of their **distinct pathological presentations** (*yìzhuàng*)."

**Qíbó** said: "The **yang** is the **celestial *qi*** (*tiāngì*), governing the **external**; the **yin** is the **terrestrial *qi*** (*dìgì*), governing the **internal**. This is what is meant by **displacement of yin and yang** (*yīnyáng yìwèi*).

Thus, when the **yang channels** are **excess** (*shí*), the **yin channels** are **deficient** (*xū*). This is what is meant by the alternation of **excess and deficiency** (*gēngshí gēngxū*).

When one **encounters malevolent wind and vacuous pathogens** (*fànzéifēngxīeyán*), the **yang** suffers first; when **diet, drink, and daily activities** are **unrestrained** (*shíyǐn bùjié qǐjū bùshí*), the **yin** suffers first. This is what is meant by saying that sometimes the disease originates from within, sometimes from without.

If the **yang** suffers, the *qi* enters the **Six Storage Organs**, causing **febrile body** (*shēnrè*) and **irregular external symptoms** (*bùshí wài*). It manifests as **shortness of breath and labored respiration** (*shuǎn hū*). If the **yin** suffers, the *qi* enters the **Five Viscera**, causing **abdominal fullness and obstruction** (*fùmǎn bìsè*). It manifests as **undigested food in the stool** (*shìxiè*), and if prolonged, as **intestinal prolapse** (*chángwèi*).

This is what is meant by saying that since their paths differ, the diseases bear distinct names.

Thus, the **throat** governs **celestial *qi*** (*tiāngì*), and the **throat passage** (*yàn*) governs **terrestrial *qi*** (*dìgì*). Therefore, when the **yang** suffers from **wind-qi** (*fēngqì*), and the **yin** suffers from **damp-qi** (*shīqì*), **like *qi* seeks like** (*tóngqì xiāngqiú*). Hence, the **yin-qi** ascends from the foot to the head, descending along the arm to the fingertips; the **yang-qi** ascends from the hand to the head, descending to the foot. This is what is meant by the alternation of **inversion and compliance** (*gēngnì gēngcóng*).

The **《Língshū Jīng》** states: "The **Three Yin meridians of the hand** (*shǒu sān yīn*) originate from the **viscera** and travel to the hand; the **Three Yang meridians of the hand** (*shǒu sān yáng*) originate from the hand and travel to the head; the **Three Yang meridians of the foot** (*zú sān yáng*) originate from the head and travel to the foot; the **Three Yin meridians of the foot** (*zú sān yīn*) originate from the foot and travel to the abdomen. Since their courses differ, there is alternation of **inversion and compliance** (*gēngnì gēngcóng*).

Thus, it is said: In **yang diseases**, the *qi* first **ascends to its extreme** (*shàngxíngjí*), then descends; in **yin diseases**, the *qi* first **descends to its extreme** (*xiàxíngjí*), then ascends. This refers to their **general tendencies**, though the **foot’s *Lesser Yin* meridian** (*zú shǎoyīn*) descends, differing from the other **yin meridians**.

Therefore, those **injured by wind** first suffer **upper symptoms**; those **injured by dampness** first suffer **lower symptoms**. The **yang-qi** ascends and flames upward (*yángqì yànshàng*), so it is first affected by **wind**; the **yin-qi** descends and moistens downward (*yīnqì rùnxià*), so it is first affected by **dampness**. This is because **like *qi* seeks like** (*tóngqì xiānghé*).

The **Yellow Emperor** said: "When the **spleen is diseased**, why do the **four limbs** fail to function? (*sìzhī bùyòng héyán*)"

**Qíbó** replied: "The **four limbs** all **draw *qi* from the stomach** (*bèngqì yú wèi*), yet they cannot directly reach the **meridians** (*jīng*). **Newly Corrected Annotation** (*xīnjiāozhèng yún*) states: According to **《Tàisū》**, it should be "directly reach the **limbs** (*jìngzhì*)" instead of "reach the **meridians**."

**Yáng Shàngshàn** says: "The **stomach** provides **water and grain** (*shuǐgǔ*) to nourish the **four limbs**, but it cannot directly reach them. Instead, it relies on the **spleen**, which receives **water and grain** and their **essence and fluids** (*jīngyè yīnwèi*), and then distributes **nutritive and defensive *qi*** (*yíngwèi*) to the **four limbs**. The **spleen** must rely on its **transformation and dissemination** (*bùhuà*) to enable the **four limbs** to perceive and receive nourishment.

Now, if the **spleen is diseased** and cannot **transport the stomach’s essence and fluids** (*wèi tīngyè bùnéngxíng*), the **four limbs** will not receive **water and grain**. The *qi* daily **wanes** (*rìyǐkuī*), and the **meridian pathways** (*màidào*) become inflexible. The **sinews, bones, muscles, and flesh** all lack *qi* to sustain them, so they **fail to function** (*bùyòng*).

The **Yellow Emperor** said: "Why does the **spleen** not govern its own season?"

**Qíbó** replied: "The **spleen** belongs to **Earth** (*tǔ*), and it governs the **center** (*zhōngyāng*). It **assists the Four Viscera** (*sìzàng*) of the **four seasons** (*sìjì*), each for **eighteen days** (*shíbā rì*), and so it **cannot govern a season alone** (*bùdé dúlì yú shí*). The **spleen (viscera)** constantly **depends on the stomach’s Earth essence** (*chángzhuó yú wèi tǔ zhī jīng*). Earth, as the **source of all things** (*shēngwànwù*), follows the **principles of Heaven and Earth** (*fǎ tiāndì*), so its influence extends from the **upper to the lower**, from **head to foot** (*shàngxià zhì tóuzú*), and it **cannot govern a season alone** (*bùdé zhǔshí*).

**Govern** (*zhì*) means **master**; **depend** (*zhuó*) means **constantly rely**. The **Earth *qi*** (*tǔqì*) in the **four seasons** each **assumes dominion** (*jìwáng*) for **eighteen days** at the **end of their respective seasons** (*jìjiū*), thus the **Five Phases’ *qi*** (*wǔxíng zhī qì*) each **rules for seventy-two days** (*bāshí èr rì*), completing a **year’s cycle** (*yǐ zhōng yīsuì zhī rì*).

The **external seasons** govern the **four limbs**, which internally correspond to the **hand and foot meridians** (*shǒuzú zhī jīng*).

The **Yellow Emperor** said: "The **spleen** and **stomach** are connected only by a **membrane** (*mó*), yet the **spleen** can **transport the stomach’s essence and fluids**—why is this?"

**Newly Corrected Annotation** (*xīnjiāozhèng yún*) states: According to **《Tàisū》**, it should be "with **convergence points** (*mù*) they **mutually counter** (*xiāngnì*)" instead of "connected by a **membrane**."

**Yáng Shàngshàn** says: "The **spleen** is **yin**, and the **stomach** is **yang**; the **spleen** is **internal**, and the **stomach** is **external**—their **positions differ**, so they **mutually counter** (*xiāngnì*). Yet the **spleen** can **transport the stomach’s essence and fluids**—why is this?"

Qì Bó said: "The **Foot Taiyin** (*zú tàiyīn*) is the **three yins** (*sān yīn*), its **meridian** (*jīng*) piercing the **stomach** and connecting to the **spleen**, intertwining with the **larynx** (*yǎ*), hence the **Foot Taiyin** **transports qi** (*xíngqì*) among the **three yins**.

The **Yangming** (*yángmíng*) is the **external** (*biǎo*), and the **stomach** is the **spleen’s external** (*pí zhī biǎo*). It is the **sea of the five zàng organs and six fǔ palaces**, also **transports qi** (*xíngqì*) among the **three yangs** (*sān yáng*). The **zàng organs and fǔ palaces** each **draw their qi** (*shòuqì*) from their respective **meridians** (*jīng*) through **Yangming**, hence the **stomach transports** its **essence and fluids** (*jīn yè*).

If the **four limbs** (*sì zhī*) fail to **receive the water and grain’s qi** (*bǐng shuǐgǔ qì*), they **daily grow weaker** (*rì yǐ yì shuāi*), and the **yin channels** (*yīn dào*) become **obstructed** (*bù lì*), leaving **tendons, bones, muscles, and flesh** (*jīngǔ jīròu*) without **qi** (*qì*) to **nourish their growth** (*yǐ shēng*), hence they **do not function** (*bù yòng yān*).

This further clarifies the **spleen’s role in governing the four limbs** (*pí zhǔ sì zhī yì*).

In the **"Yangming Meridian Explication"** (*Yángmíng jīng jiě piān*), the **Yellow Emperor** asked: "When the **Foot Yangming meridian** (*zú yángmíng zhī jīng*) is diseased, the patient **hates others** (*è rén*) and **fire** (*huǒ*), hears the **sound of wood** (*mù yīn*) and **startles in alarm** (*tìrán ér jīng*), yet **bells and drums** (*zhōnggǔ*) do not affect them. Why do they **startle in alarm** upon hearing the **sound of wood**? I wish to hear its reason.

The previous section stated: 'When it enters the **six fǔ palaces**, the body grows **hot without season** (*shēnrè bù shí*), and **breathing becomes labored** (*shàng wéi chuǎn hū*).'

Yet now, the **Foot Yangming meridian** is the **stomach meridian** (*wèi jīng*), and its disease differs from the previous section’s account—it **startles in alarm** upon hearing the **sound of wood**, hence the **Emperor’s inquiry** (*wèn qí yì*).

Qì Bó replied: "The **Foot Yangming meridian** is the **stomach meridian**, and the **stomach** is **earth** (*tǔ*). Thus, when they **startle in alarm** upon hearing the **sound of wood**, it is because **earth hates wood** (*tǔ è mù*). **《Yīnyáng Shū》** states: 'Wood **overcomes earth** (*mù kè tǔ*).' Hence, **earth hates wood**.

The **Emperor** said: 'Well explained.'

Why do they **hate fire** (*è huǒ*)?

Qì Bó said: "The **Yangming meridian** governs **flesh** (*ròu*), its **meridian**—**newly corrected annotation** (*xīnjiāozhèng yún*) states: 'According to **《Jiǎyǐ Jīng》**, it should be **muscle** (*jī*).'—when the **blood and qi** (*xuè qì*) are **abundant** (*shèng*), and **pathogenic factors** (*xié kè*) lodge there, **heat** (*rè*) arises. When **heat** is **severe** (*shèng*), they **hate fire**.

The **Emperor** was **astonished** (*yì*) beyond the **usual** (*cháng*). **Adyr** (*yú*), pronounced as **'yu'** (*yú*).

Qì Bó said: "The four limbs are the roots of all Yang meridians. When the four limbs are **solid** (*shí*), **solid** means they can ascend heights (*dēng gāo*).

The **Emperor** asked: 'Why do they **hate people** (*è rén*)?'

Qì Bó replied: 'When the **Yangming meridian** is in **ulceration** (*jué*), they **pant** (*chuǎn*) and **groan** (*wǎn*). When they groan, they **hate people**. Groaning and **internal heat** (*wǎn rè nèi yù*) accumulate, hence they are **vexed by people** (*fán è rén*).

**Newly corrected annotation** (*xīnjiāozhèng yún*) states: 'According to *Mài Jiě* (The Pulse Explanation), why do they wish to **seal themselves within doors and windows** (*bì mén yǒu ér chǔ*)? It is because **Yin and Yang clash** (*yīn yáng xiāng bó*), when **Yang is exhausted** (*yáng jìn*) and **Yin is abundant** (*yīn shèng*), hence they **seal themselves within doors and windows** (*bì mén yǒu ér chǔ*). Groan (*wǎn*), pronounced as **'wān'** (*wǎn*, *wū guàn qiè*).

The **Emperor** said: 'Some **pant and die** (*chuǎn ér sǐ*), others **pant and survive** (*chuǎn ér shēng*), why is that?'

Qì Bó replied: 'When **ulceration** (*jué*) **affects the Zàng organs** (*lián zàng*), they die; when it **affects the Jīng meridians** (*lián jīng*), they survive. **Jīng** refers to the **meridians** (*jīng mài*). **Zàng** refers to the **Five Spirit Stores** (*wǔ shén zàng*). The reason they die when **ulceration** affects the Zàng organs is because **the Spirit departs** (*shén qù*).

The **Emperor** said: 'Well explained.'

When the **disease is severe** (*bìng shèn*), they **discard their garments and flee** (*qì yī ér zǒu*), **ascend heights and sing** (*dēng gāo ér gē*), or even **go without food for several days** (*bù shí shù rì*), **scale walls and climb onto roofs** (*yú yuán shàng wū*), and the places they ascend to are all **beyond their usual capacity** (*bù shì qí sù suǒ néng*). Yet, in their **disease state**, they **gain abilities** (*fǎn néng*)—why is that? **Sù** means **inherent** (*běn*). **Adyr** (*yú*), pronounced as **'yu'** (*yú*), means **to scale walls** (*mò qiáng*).

The **Emperor** found it **strange** (*guài*) and **marveled at its unusualness** (*qǐ qí yì yú cháng*).

The **Sù** said: "The **four limbs** (*sì zhī*) are the **root of all Yang** (*zhū yáng zhī běn*). When **Yang is strong** (*yáng shèng*), the **four limbs become full** (*sì zhī shí*), and if they are full, one can **ascend heights** (*néng dēng gāo*).

**Yang** receives **qi** (*qì*) from the **four limbs**, hence the **four limbs** serve as the **root of all Yang**.

○The **newly revised edition** states: According to *The Pulse Explications* (*Mài Jiě*), it is because **Yin and Yang contend**, and the **external** (*wài*) **unites with Yang** (*bìng yú yáng*).

The **Emperor** asked: "Why do they **discard their garments and flee** (*qì yī ér zǒu*)?"

**Discard** (*qì*) means **to abandon or refuse to use** (*bù yòng*).

The **Sù** replied: "When **heat is excessive** (*rè shèng*) in the **body** (*shēn*), they **discard their garments** and wish to **flee** (*yù zǒu*)."

The **Emperor** asked: "Why do they **speak wildly, curse, or praise** (*màng yán mà jìn bù bì qīn shū*) without **distinction between close and distant** (*ér gē*)?"

The **Sù** replied: "When **Yang is strong** (*yáng shèng*), it causes one to **speak wildly, curse, or praise** (*màng yán mà jìn*), without **distinction between close and distant** (*bù bì qīn shū*), and also **not to desire food** (*bù yù shí*). Because they **do not desire food** (*bù yù shí*), they **wildly flee** (*màng zǒu*).

The **Yangming Stomach meridian** (*Zú Yángmíng wèi mài*) descends to the **lower epigastrium** (*xià gé*), connecting to the **Stomach network** (*wèi luò*) and **Spleen** (*pí*). The **Taoyin Spleen meridian** (*Zú Tàiyīn pí mài*) enters the **abdomen** (*rù fù*), connecting to the **Spleen network** (*pí luò*) and **Stomach** (*wèi*), ascends to the **upper epigastrium** (*shàng gé*) beside the **throat** (*yé yán*), and links to the **root of the tongue** (*lián shé běn*), dispersing beneath the **tongue** (*sàn shé xià*), hence the **disease manifests thus**.

**Treatise on Heat Diseases**

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Now, those who suffer from heat diseases are all cases of* **injury by cold** (*shāng hán*), *yet some recover while others die. Those who die do so within six or seven days, while those who recover take ten days or more. I do not understand the reason for this. I wish to hear its cause.*

*Cold is the essence of winter. In winter, the season is severe and cold, all living things retreat deeply within, and the virtuous person remains firmly contained, unharmed by the cold. Only those who are exposed to it are called* **injury by cold** (*shāng hán*). *When injury occurs from the* **four seasonal qi** (*sìjì*), *all can become disease. Among these,* **injury by cold** *is considered the most lethal and violent, striking immediately and causing disease. If it does not strike immediately, the cold poison lingers in the muscles and skin, and before the summer solstice, it transforms into* **warm disease** (*wēn bìng*), *while after the summer solstice, it becomes* **heat disease** (*rè bìng*). *Yet its onset is always due to* **injury by cold** *itself. Hence, it is said:* **‘Heat diseases are all of the type of injury by cold.’**

*The* **Newly Revised Edition** *states: According to* The Treatise on Injury by Cold (*Shānghán Lùn*), *it says: ‘Until spring, it becomes warm disease; until summer, it becomes summer-heat disease.’ This differs from Wang’s annotation. Wang’s commentary on* The Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon, Plain Questions (*Huángdì Nèijīng Sūwèn*) *follows one explanation, while* The Treatise on Injury by Cold *follows* The Grand Treatise on Yin-Yang (*Yīnyáng Dàlùn*), *hence the discrepancy.*

**Gūbǎo replied:** *Jùyáng*—the greatest of the yang—is the source to which all yang belong. *Jù* means ‘great.’ The* **Taiyang** *qi circulates through the meridians, blood, and* **honor-guard** (*róngwèi*) *of the body, thus governing all yang. Its pulse connects to* **Wind Palace** (*Fēngfǔ*), *a point located at the nape of the neck, one* **cùn** *above the hairline, in the center of the* **yuan-yuan** *region. Therefore, it is the master of all yang qi. The* **foot Taiyang** *pulse, floating in the head, governs nearly five* **rows of meridians** (*wǔxíng*), *thus overseeing all yang qi in the body.*

*When a person is injured by cold, they develop heat disease. Though the heat may be severe, death does not follow; the cold poison clings lightly to the muscles and skin, preventing the yang qi from dispersing outward, causing it to accumulate internally. Thus, those with* **injury by cold** *paradoxically suffer from heat disease. But if one is struck by cold twice, death is inevitable. This is called* **double injury** (*liǎng gǎn*), *where the* **storage organs and palaces** (*zàngfǔ*) *respond together and are both affected by cold.*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish to hear the signs of this."* *(Referring to those not suffering from double injury.)*

**Gūbǎo replied:** *On the first day of* **injury by cold**, *the* **Jùyáng** *(Taiyang)* *receives it. The* **Taiyang** *pulse floats, indicating the pathogen is on the surface at the skin and hair. Thus, on the first day of* **injury by cold**, *the* **Taiyang** *is first affected, causing headache, neck stiffness, and lumbar rigidity. As mentioned earlier, its pulse connects to* **Wind Palace** *(Fēngfǔ)*. *More precisely, the* **foot Taiyang** *meridian enters the brain from the crown, descends to encircle the nape, passes along the inner shoulder blade, and reaches the lumbar region, hence the headache, neck stiffness, and lumbar rigidity.*

*The* **Newly Revised Edition** *notes: According to* The Canon of Beginnings and Branches (*Jiāyǐ Jīng*) *and* The Great Essentials (*Tàisù*), *it reads ‘head, neck, lumbar, and spine all stiffen.’*

*On the second day, the* **Yángmíng** *receives it. Since yang is attracted to heat, the pathogen naturally shifts from* **Taiyang** *to* **Yángmíng**. *The* **Yángmíng** *governs the flesh, and its pulse runs beside the nose, encircling the eyes. Thus, there is body heat, eye pain, dry nose, and insomnia. The body heat arises because the flesh is invaded by the pathogen, while the stomach’s heat causes internal agitation, preventing rest. The rest follows the meridian’s pathways.*

*On the third day, the* **Shàoyáng** *receives it. The* **Shàoyáng** *governs the gallbladder.*

*The* **Newly Revised Edition** *notes: According to Quán Yuánqǐ’s edition, ‘gallbladder’ is written as ‘bone.’ Quán’s annotation states: ‘The* **Shàoyáng** *is the exterior of the liver. The liver governs tendons, and tendons converge at the bones, thus the* **Shàoyáng** *qi nourishes the bones, hence it is said to govern the bones.’ Both* The Canon of Beginnings and Branches *and* The Great Essentials *also read ‘bone.’ Its pulse runs along the ribs and encircles the ear, causing chest and rib pain and deafness.*

*The three yang meridians have all received the disease, yet it has not yet entered the* **storage organs** (*zàng*). *Thus, sweating can still resolve it, for the disease remains on the surface.*

*The* **Newly Revised Edition** *notes: According to Quán Yuánqǐ’s edition, ‘storage organs’ is written as ‘palaces.’ Quán’s annotation states: ‘The disease of* **injury by cold** *begins at the* **victory level of the skin**, *gradually overcoming the yang meridians before entering the palaces, hence sweating is needed to disperse the cold and heat.’* The Great Essentials *also reads ‘palaces.’*

*On the fourth day, the* **Tàiyīn** *receives it,*..."

The yang reaches its extreme, and then the yin receives it. The **Tàiyīn** meridian spreads across the stomach and connects to the throat, hence the abdomen becomes distended while the throat feels dry.

On the fifth day, the **Shàoyīn** receives it; the **Shàoyīn** meridian penetrates the kidney and connects to the lung, striking the root of the tongue, hence dry mouth, dry tongue, and thirst.

On the sixth day, the **Juéyīn** receives it; the **Juéyīn** meridian follows the genital region and connects to the liver, hence restlessness and abdominal fullness while the scrotum contracts.

When the three yin and three yang meridians—all five **storage organs** (*zàng*) and six **palaces** (*fǔ*)—have received the disease, the **nutritive** (*róng*) and **defensive** (*wèi*) *qi* cease to flow, and the **storage organs** fail to communicate, then death ensues. Death, like *rending* (*sī*), means the **vital essence** (*jīngqì*) is all torn apart.

Thus, when death occurs on the sixth or seventh day, it is due to this. *Rending* (*sī*), pronounced *shì-cì* (息次切).

For those not struck by cold twice, on the seventh day, the **Great Yang** (*Jùyáng*) meridian’s disease abates, and headache improves slightly; the pathogenic *qi* gradually retreats, and the meridian *qi* gradually harmonizes, hence slight improvement.

On the eighth day, the **Yangming** meridian’s disease abates, and body heat improves slightly; on the ninth day, the **Shàoyáng** meridian’s disease abates, and deafness slightly lessens; on the tenth day, the **Tàiyīn** meridian’s disease abates, the abdomen returns to normal, and the patient begins to crave food and drink; on the eleventh day, the **Shàoyīn** meridian’s disease abates, thirst ceases but the mouth is not yet moist, the tongue is dry, and sneezing occurs; on the twelfth day, the **Juéyīn** meridian’s disease abates, the scrotum relaxes, and the lower abdomen slightly descends, while the **Great Evil** (*Dàyì*) *qi* departs entirely, and the disease is then resolved. The **Great Evil** (*Dàyì*) *qi* refers to the **pathogenic** (*xié*) *qi* of great intensity.

Hence, when recovery occurs, it is always on the tenth day or later, for this reason.

The Emperor asked: How should one treat it?
**Gībó** replied: Treat each case by unblocking its respective **storage organ** meridian, and the disease will gradually abate. For those not yet at three days, sweating is sufficient; for those who have reached three days, purgation is appropriate. This outlines the general principle of **exterior** (*biǎo*) and **interior** (*liào*) conditions.

*The Treatise on Injury by Cold in Accordance with Proper Principles* (*Zhènglǐ Shānghàn Lùn*) states: If the pulse is **large, floating, and rapid** (*dà fú shù*), the disease lies on the **exterior** (*biǎo*), and sweating should be induced; if the pulse is **fine, deep, and rapid** (*xì chén shù*), the disease lies in the **interior** (*liào*), and it should be purged. Thus, even if many days have passed, as long as there are signs of an **exterior** condition and the pulse is **large, floating, and rapid**, sweating remains appropriate; even if few days have elapsed, if there are signs of an **interior** condition and the pulse is **fine, deep, and rapid**, purgation is still necessary. Treatment should be adjusted according to pulse and symptoms with sweating or purgation.

The Emperor asked: After a feverish illness has recovered, why are there sometimes lingering effects?
The lingering pathogenic *qi* has not been fully expelled, like remnants left in a person.

**Gībó** replied: All lingering effects arise because the fever was intense, and the patient forcefully consumed food, thus leaving residues. In such cases, the disease has already abated, but heat remains hidden. When the **stomach** *qi* (*gǔqì*) and the lingering heat intermingle, the two forms of heat combine, hence lingering effects occur.

The Emperor said: I understand. How should one treat lingering effects?

Gībó replied: Observe whether the patient is **deficient** or **excess**, and regulate whether the condition is **counterflow** or **harmonious**—then the illness will surely abate. If one carefully assesses deficiency or excess and prescribes **tonification** or **purgation** accordingly, the illness will surely be resolved.

The Emperor asked: What prohibitions should be observed when treating febrile illness?
Gībó replied: When the fever is nearly abated, consuming meat will cause relapse; excessive consumption will lead to lingering effects—these are the prohibitions. This is what is meant by **"warning against food and labor."** Though the fever is nearly gone, the illness has not yet been fully expelled, and the **spleen-stomach** *qi* is deficient, so digestion is impaired. Meat is firm and difficult to process, thus the fever resurfaces. **"Resurfaces"** means the original illness recurs.

The Emperor asked: If a patient contracts **two cold-related illnesses** in succession, how should their pulse and symptoms manifest?
Gībó replied: When two cold-related illnesses are contracted, on the first day, the **Greater Yang** and **Lesser Yin** channels are both affected, causing **headache, dry mouth, and restlessness with fullness**. *(Note: The corrected text states: "restlessness with fullness and thirst.")*

On the second day, the **Yang Ming** and **Greater Yin** channels are both affected, causing **abdominal fullness, body heat, loss of appetite, and delirious speech**. *(Note: "Delirious speech" refers to incoherent, disordered speech.)* *(Alternative annotation: Some texts describe this as "excessive speech.")*

「**谵** (*zhān*, rhyming with *yán*—"obstruction"), **之阎切** (*zhī yán qiè*—phonetic notation).

On the third day, the **Lesser Yang** and **Jue Yin** channels are both affected, causing **deafness, scrotal retraction and cold extremities**, with **fluids refusing to enter**, **unresponsiveness to others**, and death by the sixth day. The **Greater Yang** and **Lesser Yin** form the **outer and inner layers**, the **Yang Ming** and **Greater Yin** form the **outer and inner layers**, and the **Lesser Yang** and **Jue Yin** form the **outer and inner layers**. Thus, when two cold pathogens are contracted, they simultaneously afflict the same layers.

The Emperor asked: If the **Five Zang** are already injured, the **Six Fu** are obstructed, and the **Nourishing (Honor)** and **Defensive (Wei)** *qi* cannot circulate, why does death only occur three days later?

Gībó replied: **Yang Ming** is the longest of the twelve primary channels, its blood and *qi* being most abundant. Thus, when **unresponsiveness** occurs, its *qi* is exhausted by the third day, and death follows. This is because **Yang Ming** draws upon the **Sea of *Qi*** (*Qìhǎi*), and thus its *qi* is fully depleted by the third day.

In general, when a patient contracts **cold-related illness** and develops **warm disease**, if it occurs **before the summer solstice**, it is called **warm disease**; if it occurs **after the summer solstice**, it is called **summerheat disease**. In cases of summerheat, both **sweating and heat** must be released—do not suppress them. This distinction is based on the varying intensity of heat.

When **yang heat** is not yet dominant, it is **restrained by cold**, hence the term **daily warm disease**. When **yang heat** is overwhelming and cold cannot restrain it, it becomes **daily summerheat disease**. However, in cases of summerheat, **sweating must be induced to effect a cure**—do not suppress it further, lest the condition worsen.
*(Annotation: The following section on cold-related injury was originally in *Discourse on Strange Diseases* (*Qíbìng Lùn*), later relocated by Wang [Shouren].)*

Yang Shangshan notes:
- **Mild winter cold injury**, if manifesting **before the summer solstice**, becomes **warm disease**.
- **Severe winter cold injury**, if manifesting **after the summer solstice**, becomes **summerheat disease**.

**Section on Liver Heat Disease:**
When the liver is afflicted by heat, **urine turns yellow first**, followed by **abdominal pain radiating outward** and **external body heat**. The liver’s channel encircles the genitals, ascends to the lower abdomen, and then rises—thus, **urinary obstruction precedes yellowing**, and pain radiates outward.

When **cold transforms into heat**, the body becomes hot. If **heat and pathogens clash**, it results in **delirious speech and startlement**, **rib-side fullness and pain**, **restless limbs**, and **insomnia**. Though the channels have already received heat, the **spirit of the Zang has not yet internalized the pathogen**—thus, the conflict between **pathogen and righteous *qi*** manifests as **clashing**.

The liver’s channel ascends from the lower abdomen alongside the stomach, passes through the diaphragm, spreads across the ribs, follows the posterior pharynx, and connects to the root of the tongue—hence, **delirious speech, rib-side fullness, and pain**. The liver’s nature is **calm yet prone to startlement**, so illness induces **startlement, restless limbs, and inability to rest**.

When **Geng and Xin days** are severe, or **Jia and Yi days** involve **profound sweating**, **inverted *qi*** leads to death on **Geng and Xin days**. The liver governs **Wood**, while **Geng and Xin** correspond to **Metal**—Metal overcomes Wood, hence severity and death on those days. **Jia and Yi** correspond to **Wood**, so **excessive sweating** occurs then.

**Needle the Jue Yin and Lesser Yang channels**—**Jue Yin** being the liver’s channel, **Lesser Yang** the gallbladder’s. If *qi* is inverted, it causes **throbbing headache**, as the pulse **draws upward toward the crown**. The liver’s channel rises from the tongue’s root, follows the posterior pharynx, exits at the forehead, and converges with the **Governor Vessel** at the crown—thus, the **pulsating, urgent headache** and sensation of **pulse surging into the head**.

**员员** (*yuányuán*)—**urgent, as if pressing**.

---
**Section on Heart Heat Disease:**
When the heart is afflicted by heat, **joylessness** appears first, followed by **heat after several days**. The heart is what **governs governance over all things**. When pathogenic *qi* enters the channels, the **spirit loses its regulatory function**, hence **initial joylessness**, with heat emerging **after several days**.

If **heat and pathogens clash**, it results in **sudden heart pain**, **restlessness, nausea, headache, flushed face, and anhidrosis**. The **heart’s Hand-Shao Yin channel** originates in the heart; its branch separates from the **heart’s system**, ascending alongside the throat.

The **Small Intestine’s channel**, when it runs straight, follows the throat downward to the *liè* (鬲) and reaches the stomach. Its branch diverges from the *quēpén* (缺盆), ascending along the neck to the cheek, then to the outer *duìbì* (兑毗, *i.e.* temple). Hence, it causes **sudden heart pain**, **restlessness, nausea, headache, and flushed face**. The heart’s **liquid** manifests as **sweat**; now, with heat disease, **sweat fails to emerge**.

**Newly corrected text states:** According to the *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* (《甲乙经》), *duìbì* (外毗) should be read as *duìbì* (兑毗). Wang’s annotation in the *Jué Lùn* (《厥论》) also reads it as *duìbì* (兑毗). **"Outer" should be "temple"** (兑). When the disease is **severe in *rén* (壬) and *guǐ* (癸)**, or **profound sweating occurs in *bǐng* (丙) and *dīng* (丁)**, if **the *qi* reverses**, death occurs in *rén* (壬) and *guǐ* (癸). The heart **governs fire**, and *rén* (壬) and *guǐ* (癸) **represent water**; since **water extinguishes fire**, the disease becomes severe, resulting in death at *rén* (壬) and *guǐ* (癸). *Bǐng* (丙) and *dīng* (丁) **represent fire**, so **profound sweating occurs at *bǐng* (丙) and *dīng* (丁)**. The signs of **reversed *qi*** are **not recorded** in the *Jīng* (经). **Puncture the Hand-Shao Yin and Hand-Taiyang channels**—the Shao Yin is the **heart’s channel**, the Taiyang is the **Small Intestine’s channel**.

For **Spleen heat disease**, **head heaviness and cheek pain** appear first, followed by **restlessness, a greenish complexion, nausea, and body heat**. The **Spleen’s channel**, when it runs straight, ascends to the *liè* (鬲) alongside the throat and **flows into the heart**. Its branch diverges from the stomach, ascending to the *liè* (鬲) and reaching the heart. Hence, **head heaviness and cheek pain** occur first, with **a greenish complexion**. The **Spleen’s channel** also **branches and descends to the stomach**, so **restlessness, nausea, and body heat** arise.

**Newly corrected text states:** According to the *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* (《甲乙经》) and *Tài Sù* (《太素》), for **Spleen heat disease**, the initial symptoms are **head heaviness and cheek pain**—**omitting the "greenish complexion"** (颜青). When **heat and pathogens clash**, it results in **waist pain preventing bending or bowing**, **abdominal distension with diarrhea**, and **pain in both jaws**. The **Spleen’s channel** enters the abdomen and **connects with the Spleen’s network**, which **branches to the stomach**. The **stomach’s channel**, descending from *chéngjiāng* (承浆), follows the jaw’s posterior, then moves down to *lián* (廉) and emerges at *Dàyíng* (大迎), ascending along the cheek to the ear. Hence, **abdominal distension with diarrhea** and **pain in both jaws** occur.

**Jaws** (颔, *i.e.* *jiān*), pronounced as *"hú gǎn"* (胡感). When the disease is **severe in *jiǎ* (甲) and *yǐ* (乙)**, or **profound sweating occurs in *wù* (戊) and *jǐ* (己)**, if **the *qi* reverses**, death occurs in *jiǎ* (甲) and *yǐ* (乙). The **Spleen governs earth**, and *jiǎ* (甲) and *yǐ* (乙) **represent wood**; since **wood cuts into earth**, the disease becomes severe, resulting in death at *jiǎ* (甲) and *yǐ* (乙). *Wù* (戊) and *jǐ* (己) **represent earth**, so **profound sweating occurs at *wù* (戊) and *jǐ* (己)**. The signs of **reversed *qi*** are **not documented** in the *Jīng* (经). **Puncture the Foot-Taiyin and Foot-Yangming channels**—the Taiyin is the **Spleen’s channel**, the Yangming is the **stomach’s channel**.

**Newly corrected text states:** According to the *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* (《甲乙经热病下篇》), **Spleen heat disease** presents as **head heaviness and cheek pain**, **restlessness, body heat**, and when **heat and pathogens clash**, it results in **waist pain preventing bending or bowing**, **abdominal distension**, and **pain in both jaws**. Its symptoms include **sudden diarrhea with hunger yet no desire to eat**, **frequent belching**, **clear urine despite heat**, **abdominal bloating with indigestion**, **nausea**, **diarrhea with pus and blood**, **painful vomiting without relief**, and **taking *Sānlǐ* (三里) first**, then **puncturing *Tàibái* (太白) and *Zhāngmén* (章门)**.

For **Lung heat disease**, the initial symptom is **a sudden chill with *jué* (厥)**, **raising of fine hairs**, **aversion to wind and cold**, and **a yellow tongue with body heat**. The **Lung governs the skin**, and **its external nourishment is through hair**, so when **heat affects the exterior**, the initial symptoms are **a sudden chill, aversion to wind and cold, and fine hairs rising**. The **Lung’s channel** originates in the **middle burner**, descending to **network with the Large Intestine**, then ascending to the **stomach’s mouth**. Now, with **Lung heat entering the stomach**, and **stomach heat ascending**, the tongue becomes **yellow** and the body **hot**.

When **heat and pathogens clash**, it results in **wheezing and coughing**, **pain migrating through the chest, lateral costal region, and back**, **inability to take deep breaths**, **intolerable headache**, and **sweating with cold**. The **Lung resides above the *liè* (鬲)**, and its **governing *qi* controls the chest and lateral costal region**; it also **transforms in motion as coughing**, and **stores *qi* to govern respiration**. The **back** is the **chamber of the chest**, so **wheezing and coughing** occur, with **pain migrating through the chest, lateral costal region, and back**, and **inability to take deep breaths**. The **Lung’s network channel** ascends to meet at the **ear**, and now with **heat *qi* ascending and obstructing**, it causes **intolerable headache** and **sweating with cold**.

When the disease is **severe in *bǐng* (丙) and *dīng* (丁)**, or **profound sweating occurs in *gēng* (庚) and *xīn* (辛)**, if **the *qi* reverses**, death occurs in *bǐng* (丙) and *dīng* (丁). The **Lung governs metal**, and *bǐng* (丙) and *dīng* (丁) **represent fire**; since **fire corrodes metal**, the disease becomes severe, resulting in death at *bǐng* (丙) and *dīng* (丁). *Gēng* (庚) and *xīn* (辛) **represent metal**, so **profound sweating occurs at *gēng* (庚) and *xīn* (辛)**. The signs of **reversed *qi*** are **not documented** in the *Jīng* (经). **Puncture the Hand-Taiyin and Hand-Yangming channels**—the Taiyin is the **Lung’s channel**, the Yangming is the **Large Intestine’s channel**—**and draw blood as large as a soybean**; the patient **recovers immediately**. **Puncture where the network channels are most prominent**.

For **Kidney heat disease**, the initial symptoms are **waist pain and lower back acidity**, **intense thirst with frequent drinking**, and **body heat**. The **Bladder’s channel** descends from the **inner shoulder blade**, alongside the **spine to the waist**. The **waist is the chamber of the Kidney**, so **waist pain** appears first. The **Kidney’s channel** follows the **inner ankle**, ascending to the **inner calf**, and emerging at *guān* (蝈) in the **inner groin**. Its straight path ascends from the **Kidney**, piercing the **Liver’s *liè* (鬲)**, entering the **Lung**, following the throat, and alongside the **root of the tongue**. Hence, **lower back acidity, intense thirst, frequent drinking**, and **body heat** occur.

When **heat and pathogens clash**, it results in **stiff neck, lower back cold and acid**, **heat in the soles**, and **disinclination to speak**. The **Bladder’s channel** descends from the **brain**, branching to the **neck**. The **Kidney’s channel** originates beneath the **little toe**, diagonally ascending to the **sole of the foot**, emerging beneath *Rángǔ* (然谷), following the **inner ankle**, and branching into the **heel**, then ascending to the **lower back**. Its straight path ascends from the **Kidney**, piercing the **Liver’s *liè* (鬲)**, entering the **Lung**, following the throat, and alongside the **root of the tongue**. Hence, **stiff neck, lower back cold and acid**, **heat in the soles**, and **disinclination to speak** occur.

**Newly corrected text states:** According to the *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* (《甲乙经》), *Rángǔ* (然谷) should be read as *Rángǔ* (然谷). **"Heel"** (跟) is pronounced as *"gēn"* (根). When **the *qi* reverses**, the neck becomes **painful, urgent, and faintly bearing weight** (员员澹担然).

The tendons of the **Kidney** follow the inner spine, ascending alongside the armpits to the neck, converging at the occipital bone and merging with the tendons of the **Bladder**. The **Bladder’s channel** also descends along the neck. Hence, the neck aches with a **dull, weighty sensation** (*yuányuán dàn dānrán*).

**Dàn dàn** signifies an uncertain, wavering quality. When the disease peaks on **Wu-Ji days** (戊己), and on **Rén-Gui days** (壬癸) there is profuse sweating, if the **qi** reverses, death occurs on **Wu-Ji days**. The **Kidney governs water**, while **Wu-Ji corresponds to earth**—earth restrains water, hence the severity, and death on **Wu-Ji days**. **Rén-Gui corresponds to water**, so profuse sweating occurs on these days.

Puncture the **Foot Minor Yin** (少阴) and **Major Yang** (太阳). **Minor Yin** refers to the **Kidney’s channel**; **Major Yang** refers to the **Bladder’s channel**. All cases of sweating occur on the day of their conquering element. When **Qi reigns supreme**, it conquers evil, hence sweating occurs on the day of its ruling element.

For **Liver heat disorders**, the **left cheek** reddens first. The **Liver’s qi aligns with wood**, and wood’s energy corresponds to spring. Facing south in accordance with the natural order, the left cheek is affected.

For **Heart heat disorders**, the **forehead** reddens first. The **Heart’s qi aligns with fire**, and fire’s energy ascends—symbolizing clarity—hence it is observed on the forehead.

For **Spleen heat disorders**, the **nose** reddens first. The **Spleen’s qi aligns with earth**, which governs the center, and the nose lies centrally on the face, hence it is observed there.

For **Lung heat disorders**, the **right cheek** reddens first. The **Lung’s qi aligns with metal**, and metal’s energy corresponds to autumn. Facing south in accordance with the natural order, the right cheek is affected.

For **Kidney heat disorders**, the **chin** reddens first. The **Kidney’s qi aligns with water**, which uniquely moistens downward—symbolizing clarity—hence it is observed on the chin.

If redness appears before the disease manifests, puncture it—this is called **"treating what has not yet fallen ill."** The sage does not treat what is already ill but treats what has not yet fallen ill; does not govern what is already chaotic but governs what has not yet fallen into chaos.

When heat disorders arise from their respective organs, they resolve by their appointed day—the day of **great sweating**. For example:
- **Liver**: **Jia-Yi days** (甲乙)
- **Heart**: **Bing-Ding days** (丙丁)
- **Spleen**: **Wu-Ji days** (戊己)
- **Lung**: **Geng-Xin days** (庚辛)
- **Kidney**: **Rén-Gui days** (壬癸)

If the puncture is applied **in reverse**, three cycles suffice. **"Reverse"** means counteracting the **qi** of the affected organ. For instance:
- **Liver disease**: puncture the **Spleen**
- **Spleen disease**: puncture the **Kidney**
- **Kidney disease**: puncture the **Heart**
- **Heart disease**: puncture the **Lung**
- **Lung disease**: puncture the **Liver**

This is the method of **reversing the five zang’s qi**. Three cycles refer to three rotations through the **three yin and three yang channels**.

Additionally:
- **Major Yang disorders**: puncture **Minor Yang** (少阳)
- **Minor Yang disorders**: puncture **Major Yang** (阳明)
- **Minor Yin disorders**: puncture **Minor Yang** (少阳)
- **Major Yin disorders**: puncture **Minor Yin** (少阴)
- **Minor Yin disorders**: puncture **Jue Yin** (厥阴)

This is the method of **reversing the three yin and three yang channels’ qi**. If applied **twice in reverse**, death ensues. First, puncture in reverse; if the disease spreads, and another reverse puncture is applied, this is **double reversal**, and survival is unlikely. Even a single reversal requires three cycles to resolve—how much less chance of survival with double reversal?

All cases where sweating is due occur on the day of their conquering element. When **Qi reigns supreme**, it conquers evil, hence sweating occurs on the day of its ruling element.

**Newly corrected text states:** This passage’s annotation of twenty-four characters duplicates earlier text and should be omitted. Neither the *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* nor the *Tàisū* repeats this.

For treating febrile diseases, administer cold water to drink and then apply acupuncture, ensuring the patient wears cold garments and resides in a cold environment until the body feels cold. Cold water resides in the stomach, where excess **Yang qi** manifests externally; thus, drinking cold water and then acupuncture cools the heat, while the retreat of fever generates coldness, hence the body must be cold before removing the needle.

When febrile diseases first present with chest and flank pain and restless hands and feet, puncture **Foot Shao Yang** (少阳) and reinforce **Foot Tai Yin** (太阴). This exemplifies the principle of **uprightly taking the corrective approach**. However, since **Foot Shao Yang** pertains to Wood pathology, and the method involves **draining Foot Shao Yang’s Wood qi** while reinforcing **Foot Tai Yin’s Earth qi**, it is to prevent Wood transmitting to Earth.

Chest and flank pain is governed by **Qiu Xu** (丘虚). **Qiu Xu** is located below the lateral malleolus on the outer foot, where the depression resembles a prior indentation, along the path of **Foot Shao Yang**. The needle may be inserted to a depth of **five fen** (分) of the same-body inch, retained for seven breaths. If moxibustion is applied, three cones may be used.

For febrile diseases with restless hands and feet, though the classics do not specify treatment, reinforcing **Foot Tai Yin’s** channels should be done at the **Jing-Well** and **Ying-Spring** points.

---
**Correction Note:** The original text specifies **Foot Tai Yin** (足太阴), but the *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* and *Tàisū* read **Hand Tai Yin** (手太阴). Yang Shangshan notes that **Hand Tai Yin** ascends to the lung and emerges beneath the armpit, thus governing chest and flank pain. Additionally, the *Língshū Jīng* states: *"For febrile diseases with chest and flank pain and restless hands and feet, treat at the **Jin-Question** (筋问), using the fourth needle to locate the tendon at the liver. Do not locate it at the metal [lung]."* Thus, the correct interpretation is **Hand Tai Yin**.

For severe cases, apply **59-needle acupuncture**. These 59 points are:
- Five rows of five points on the head to **reverse excessive Yang heat**;
- **Dàzhū** (大杼), **Yúnmèn** (云门), **Quēpén** (缺盆), and **Bèiyǔ** (背俞)—eight points to **drain chest heat**;
- **Qìjiē** (气街), **Sānlǐ** (三里), and **Jùxū Shàng Xià Kāng** (巨虚上下康)—eight points to **drain stomach heat**;
- **Yúnmèn** (云门), **Dúgǔ** (髑骨), **Wěizhōng** (委中), and **Suǐkòng** (髓空)—eight points to **drain limb heat**;
- Five **Zàng-Yǔ** (藏俞) points beside each—ten points to **drain visceral heat**.

These 59 points are all **countermeasures against heat**. Thus, severe cases require such treatment.

The five rows on the head are:
- The central row: **Shàngxīng** (上星), **Zìhuì** (自会), **Qiántíng** (前顶), **Bǎihuì** (百会), **Hòutíng** (后顶);
- The next two lateral rows: **Wǔchù** (五处), **Chéngguāng** (承光), **Tōngtiān** (通天), **Luòquè** (络却), **Yùzhěn** (玉枕);
- The outer lateral row: **Líndì** (临泣), **Mùchuāng** (目窗), **Zhèngyíng** (正营), **Chénglíng** (承灵), **Nǎokòng** (脑空).

**Shàngxīng** is located on the crown, directly above the nasal center, one same-body inch into the hairline, within a depression capable of containing a **small bean**. The needle may be inserted to **four fen** of the same-body inch. **Correction Note:** The *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* and *Shuǐ-Rè Xuélùn* specify **three fen**, and the subsequent text states: *"Puncture as with Shàngxīng"* and *"Puncture as with Zìhuì."* Since two methods are given, follow the *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* and *Shuǐ-Rè Xuélùn*, inserting **three fen** for **Shàngxīng** and **four fen** for **Zìhuì**.

**Zìhuì** is located one same-body inch posterior to **Shàngxīng**, within a depression. Puncture as with **Shàngxīng**.

**Qiántíng** is located one same-body inch and **five fen** posterior to **Zìhuì**, within a depression between bones. Puncture as with **Zìhuì**.

**Bǎihuì** is located one same-body inch and **thirteen fen** posterior to **Qiántíng**, within the crown’s whorl depression, capable of containing a finger. It is the convergence of the **Du Mai** (督脉) and **Foot Tai Yang** (足太阳) channels. Puncture as with **Shàngxīng**.

**Hòutíng** is located one same-body inch and **five fen** posterior to **Bǎihuì**, on the occipital bone. Puncture as with **Zìhuì**.

These five points all originate from the **Du Mai’s qi**. **Shàngxīng** is retained for six breaths; if moxibustion is applied, five cones may be used.

The next lateral points:
- **Wǔchù** is located one same-body inch and **five fen** lateral to **Shàngxīng**.
- **Chéngguāng** is located one same-body inch posterior to **Wǔchù**.
- **Tōngtiān** is located one same-body inch and **five fen** posterior to **Chéngguāng**.
- **Luòquè** is located one same-body inch and **five fen** posterior to **Tōngtiān**.
- **Yùzhěn** is located **seven fen** posterior to **Luòquè**.

These five points all originate from the **Foot Tai Yang** channel. The needle may be inserted to **three fen** of the same-body inch. **Wǔchù** and **Tōngtiān** are retained for seven breaths; **Luòquè** for five breaths; **Yùzhěn** for three breaths. If moxibustion is applied, three cones may be used. **Correction Note:** The *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* states **Chéngguāng** cannot be moxibusted, and **Yùzhěn** should be inserted to **two fen**.

The outer lateral points:
- **Líndì** is located five same-body fen above the eye, within the hairline, where the **Foot Tai Yang**, **Foot Shao Yang**, and **Yang Wéi** (阳维) channels converge.
- **Mùchuāng**, **Zhèngyíng**, **Chénglíng**, and **Nǎokòng** are spaced one same-body inch apart sequentially.

These five points all converge at the **Foot Shao Yang** and **Yang Wéi** channels. **Nǎokòng** may be inserted to **four fen** of the same-body inch; the rest to **three fen**. **Líndì** is retained for seven breaths; if moxibustion is applied, five cones may be used.

**Dàzhū** is located lateral to the first cervical vertebra, one same-body inch and **half** apart, within a depression, where the **Du Mai** branches and converges with the **Foot Tai Yang** and **Hand Tai Yang** channels. The needle may be inserted to **three fen** of the same-body inch, retained for seven breaths. If moxibustion is applied, **five cones** may be used. **Correction Note:** The *Jiǎyǐ Jīng*, *Qì-Xué* commentary, *Cìyào* commentary, and *Rè-Xué* commentary specify **five cones**.

**Yúnyǔ** (膺俞), properly named **Zhòngfǔ** (中府), is located on the chest’s midline, six same-body inches apart, one inch below **Yúnmèn**, above the nipple, between the third and fourth ribs, where the pulsating artery is palpable within a depression. It is accessed while the patient reclines.

The **Foot and Hand Tai Yin** channels converge here. Needling may reach **three fen** of the same-body inch, retained for **five breaths**. If moxibustion is applied, **five cones** may be used.

**Quèpén** (缺盆) is located on the shoulder’s upper horizontal bone within a depression. It is where the **Hand Yang Ming** channel’s *qi* emerges. Needling may reach **three fen** of the same-body inch, retained for **seven breaths**. If moxibustion is applied, **three cones** may be used.

**Bèiyǔ** (背俞) corresponds to **Fēngmén** (風門) and **Rèfǔ** (熱府). It is situated below the second vertebra on either side, each **one same-body inch and half** apart. Here, the **Du Mai** and **Foot Tai Yang** channels converge. Needling may reach **five fen** of the same-body inch, retained for **seven breaths**. If moxibustion is applied, **five cones** may be used. **Correction Note:** Current *Míngtáng* (明堂) and *Zhōngyuè Tújīng* (中诰图经) texts do not mention *Bèiyǔ*, and its exact location remains unclear.

**Qìchōng** (氣沖) is located on the lower abdomen, level with the horizontal bone’s two ends, above the **mice’s error** (鼠误) by **one same-body inch**, where the artery is palpable. It is where the **Foot Yang Ming** channel’s *qi* emerges. Needling may reach **three fen** of the same-body inch, retained for **seven breaths**. If moxibustion is applied, **five cones** may be used.

**Sānlǐ** (三里) is situated **three same-body inches** below the knee, outside the **abdominal cavity** (腑外), between the two tendons of the **Kang** (康), where the **Foot Yang Ming** channel enters. Needling may reach **one same-body inch**, retained for **seven breaths**. If moxibustion is applied, **three cones** may be used.

**Jùxū** (巨虚) **Shàngliàn** (上廉) is where the **Foot Yang Ming** and **Tai Yang** channels merge, located **three same-body inches** below **Sānlǐ**. It is where the **Foot Yang Ming** channel’s *qi* emerges. Needling may reach **eight fen** of the same-body inch. If moxibustion is applied, **three cones** may be used.

**Jùxū** **Xiàliàn** (下廉) is where the **Foot Yang Ming** and **Shàoyáng** channels merge, located **three same-body inches** below **Shàngkāng** (上康). It is where the **Foot Yang Ming** channel’s *qi* emerges. Needling may reach **three fen** of the same-body inch. If moxibustion is applied, **three cones** may be used.

**Yúnmén** (雲門) is located below the **humeral head** (巨骨), on the chest’s midline, each side **one same-body inch apart**. **Correction Note:** According to the *Qì-Xué* (气穴) commentary, the chest’s midline should read as the **side of the Governing** (侠任脉) and **horizontal to the Conception** (去任脉) channels—though the wording differs, the point’s location remains the same. The artery is palpable, **six same-body inches** apart. **Zhōngfǔ** (中府) is situated **one same-body inch** below it. **Yúnmén** is where the **Hand Tai Yin** channel’s *qi* emerges; the needle is accessed with the arm raised. Needling may reach **seven fen** of the same-body inch. If moxibustion is applied, **five cones** may be used.

**Sūkōng** (髓空), properly named **Yāoyǔ** (腰俞), is located below the **second lumbar vertebra** (第二十一椎节), within a depression. It is where the **Du Mai**’s *qi* emerges. Needling may reach **one fen** of the same-body inch. **Correction Note:** The *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* (甲乙经) specifies **two cun**, and the *Shuǐ-Rè Xué Lùn* (水热穴论) commentary also notes **two cun**, while the *Qìfǔ Lùn* (气府论) and *Gǔkōng Lùn* (骨空论) commentaries specify **one fen**. Retained for **seven breaths**; if moxibustion is applied, **three cones** may be used.

The **Five Zàng-Yǔ** (五藏俞) points beside the **five** refer to **Pòhù** (魄户), **Shéntáng** (神堂), **Húnmén** (魂门), **Yìshè** (意舍), and **Zhìshì** (志室)—five acupuncture points. They are located on either side of the **loins** (侠脊), each **three same-body inches** apart, where the **Foot Tai Yang** channel’s *qi* emerges.

**Pòhù** (魄户) is situated below the **third vertebra** (第三椎), accessed while the patient sits upright. Needling may reach **five fen** of the same-body inch. If moxibustion is applied, **five cones** may be used.

**Shéntáng** (神堂) is located below the **fifth vertebra** (第五椎). Needling may reach **three fen** of the same-body inch. If moxibustion is applied, **five cones** may be used.

**Húnmén** (魂门) is situated below the **ninth vertebra** (第九推), accessed while the patient sits upright. Needling may reach **five fen** of the same-body inch. If moxibustion is applied, **three cones** may be used.

**Yìshè** (意舍) is located below the **eleventh vertebra** (第十一椎), accessed while the patient sits upright. Needling may reach **five fen** of the same-body inch. If moxibustion is applied, **three cones** may be used.

**Zhìshì** (志室) is situated below the **fourteenth vertebra** (第十四椎), accessed while the patient sits upright. Needling may reach **five fen** of the same-body inch. If moxibustion is applied, **three cones** may be used. These are the **fifty-nine needling methods** of this *Sūtrā* (經).

If the **fifty-nine needling methods** indicated in the *Zhēnjīng* (针经) are followed, they differ entirely from this *Sūtrā*. Though both treat **heat diseases** (热病) as key points, the logic of their combined use is entirely focused on the **back** (背). One must still follow the **diagnostic signs** (病候) and **symptom patterns** (形证) of the affected channels and apply needling accordingly.

For **heat diseases** where the **hands and arms** (手臂) initially ache, needle the **Hand Yang Ming** and **Tai Yin** channels to induce sweating and halt the condition.

**Lièquē** (列缺) governs **hand and arm pain**. **Lièquē** is a collateral of the **Hand Tai Yin** channel, located **two same-body inches and half** above the wrist, diverging to the **Yang Ming** channel. Needling may reach **three fen** of the same-body inch, retained for **three breaths**. If moxibustion is applied, **five cones** may be used.

To induce sweating, **Shāngyáng** (商阳) governs it. **Shāngyáng** is the **well** (井) point of the **Hand Yang Ming** channel, situated on the **inner side** of the **second finger** (次指) of the hand, **like the distance of a chive leaf** (韭叶) from the fingernail corner. It is where the **Hand Yang Ming** channel’s *qi* issues forth. Needling may reach **one fen** of the same-body inch, retained for **one breath**. If moxibustion is applied, **one cone** may be used.

「When a febrile illness begins in the head, needling **Tiāngzhú** (天柱) of the **Foot Tai Yang** channel induces sweating to halt it. **Tiāngzhú** lies at the depression just lateral to the great tendon at the nape, behind the hairline, where the *qi* of the **Foot Tai Yang** channel emerges. Needling may reach **two fen** of the same-body inch, retained for **six breaths**. If moxibustion is applied, **three cones** may be used.

When a febrile illness begins in the **Foot channels**, needling the **Foot Yang Ming** channel induces sweating to halt it.
*[New Annotation:]* This passage does not appear in the *Su Wen* nor in the *Tai Su*, and is added here based on the *Jia Yi Jing*.

If a febrile illness presents with **body heaviness, bone pain, deafness, and drowsiness**, needle the **Foot Shao Yin** channel.
*[According to the classics, there is no designated principal point; thus, the **well** and **spring** points should be supplemented instead.]*
*[New Annotation:]* The *Ling Shu* states: *"For febrile illness with body heaviness, bone pain, deafness, and drowsiness, take the bone, using the fourth needle to seek the bone in the kidney; if unable, seek it in the earth."* Earth refers to the **spleen**. Severe cases require **fifty-nine punctures**, as per ancient methods.

For febrile illnesses that first manifest as **vertigo and nausea**, followed by heat, and **chest and flank fullness**, needle the **Foot Shao Yin** and **Foot Shao Yang** channels.
*[The **well** and **spring** points should be supplemented instead.]*

The **Foot Tai Yang** channel appears with **a flushed forehead** (色荣额骨), which is a sign of febrile illness. *[Annotation:]* **荣 (róng)** means "adorned," referring to the vivid red hue visible on the forehead as though adorned. **顾骨** refers to the area below the eyes near the outer canthus. *[Annotation:]* The **Foot Tai Yang** channel corresponds to **Fire** in its paired organ system, hence the manifestation of redness.

If the red flush does not **subside (荣未交)**, *[New Annotation:]* the *Jia Yi Jing* and *Tai Su* originally read **荣未夭 (róng wèi yāo)**—a possible corruption of **营 (yíng)**—the text states: *"For now, one may only induce sweating; await the proper timing."* *[Annotation:]* **曰 (yuē)** introduces the reasoning from ancient texts: though the color is vivid, if the **Dao/Way’s** **qi** does not harmonize (交错), the method prescribes only inducing sweating. *"Awaiting the proper timing"* means:
- **Liver** illnesses await **Geng-Zi** (甲乙),
- **Heart** illnesses await **Jing-Wu** (丙丁),
- **Spleen** illnesses await **Ji-Wèi** (戊己),
- **Lung** illnesses await **Geng-Xin** (庚辛),
- **Kidney** illnesses await **Rén-Gùi** (壬癸).

If the **Foot Tai Yang** channel’s red flush **contends (争见)** with the **Jue Yin** channel’s taut pulse, the **death term** shall not exceed three days. *[Annotation:]* The **Tai Yang**’s red flush externally corresponds to the **Jue Yin**’s taut pulse internally. When the **Tai Yang** channel is afflicted, the disease should transmit inward to the **Yang Ming** channel; if instead the **Jue Yin** channel’s pulse appears, this indicates **Spleen (Earth) collapse and Liver (Wood) aggression**, hence death. Since the **Spleen’s qi** has already collapsed and **Wood (Liver) runs rampant**, and **Wood governs the number three**, the death term does not exceed three days.

For febrile illnesses where the **qi** manifests in the **kidney (肾)**, the **Foot Shao Yang** channel’s color is involved. *[Annotation:]* The term **病或为气** may be a textual error; if the red flush appears beside the nostrils, this is the **Shao Yang** channel’s color, not the **Jue Yin**’s, because the **kidney region is near the nose**.

The **Foot Shao Yang** channel’s color appears on the **cheek (颊)**, *[New Annotation:]* originally written as **筋 (jīn, sinew)**—a possible corruption—near the nostrils. If the red flush does not **subside (荣未交)**, the text states: *"For now, one may only induce sweating; await the proper timing."* If the **Shao Yang** channel’s color **contends (争见)** with the **Shao Yin** channel’s pulse, the **death term** shall not exceed three days. *[Annotation:]* Since the **Shao Yang** channel corresponds to **Wood** and the **Shao Yin** channel to **Water**, when the **Shao Yang**’s color appears and the **Shao Yin** channel contests it, this is **Mother (Water) overcoming Child (Wood)**, hence **Wood (Liver) death**. The original text and *Jia Yi Jing* and *Tai Su* do not mention the *"death term shall not exceed three days"* clause; this was added by **Wang**. *[Annotation:]* The **Foot Shao Yang** channel’s **well** and **spring** points should be supplemented instead.

The **acupuncture points for febrile illness (热病气穴)** are as follows:
- **Third vertebra (三椎) below** probes **chest heat**,
- **Fourth vertebra (四椎) below** probes **epigastric heat**,
- **Fifth vertebra (五椎) below** probes **liver heat**,
- **Sixth vertebra (六椎) below** probes **spleen heat**,
- **Seventh vertebra (七椎) below** probes **kidney heat**,
and the **spring** point lies in the **sacrum (骷)**. *[Annotation:]* The **椎 (zhuī, vertebrae)** refers to the **joints of the spine**, while **骷 (kū, sacrum)** refers to the **lower end of the spine**. The text states that **kidney heat** externally communicates with the **sacrum (骷)**.

The reasoning behind these **vertebral points** governing the **spirit-organ (神藏)** heat is unclear, as they do not align with the **paired organ system’s back-shu (藏俞)** points. *[Annotation:]* The **三椎 (third vertebrae)** below the nape of the neck are the **陷者 (shěn zhě, depression points)**—the **central points**—and this is a general method for probing the **spine’s major points**.

Why does the text specify the **third vertebra (三椎)** below for **chest heat**? It means that all should be needled at the **陷者 (depression points)** as the **primary locations** for **qi** manipulation.

For **facial diagnosis**:
- **Inverted cheek (颊下逆倾)** indicates **abdominal fullness**,
- **Lower jaw (下牙车)** indicates **abdominal distension**,
- **Sudden cheek collapse (顿后)** indicates **flank pain**,
- **Upper cheek (颊上)** refers to the **epigastrium (鬲上)**.

This is how one examines **facial color** to reveal **abdominal diseases**. *[Annotation:]* The **黄帝内经素问** (*Huangdi Neijing Suwen*) supplementary annotations conclude here.

**Discussion on Febrile Diseases**

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"There are patients with febrile disease who sweat profusely yet soon relapse into heat. Their pulse is rapid and tense, undiminished by sweating. They speak incoherently and cannot eat. What is the name of this illness?"*

Qibo replied: *"This is called the **Yin-Yang Exchange**—**Exchange** means death. **Exchange** refers to the mingling of Yin and Yang qi without distinction."*

The Emperor said: *"I wish to hear the explanation."*

Qibo said: *"All sweating in the body originates from grain. Grain generates essence, and when essence-qi prevails, it manifests as sweat. Now, when pathogenic forces contend within the flesh and bone, and sweating occurs, it means the pathogen retreats while essence prevails—this is the **initial sweating**. When essence prevails, the patient should be able to eat and not relapse into heat. If heat recurs, it is the pathogen; sweating is essence-qi. If sweating appears yet heat immediately returns, the pathogen is dominant. The inability to eat stems from **essence having no means**—**no means** means no capacity to generate sweat. When grain fails to transform, essence does not form, and essence, untransformed, cannot flow—thus, no means to produce sweat. If the disease lingers, the patient’s lifespan will swiftly decline. If sweating appears rapidly yet lingers without cessation, the patient’s life will swiftly become perilous."*

**New Verification Notes:** *"Examine **disease lingering**—according to Wang Bing’s annotation, *disease* should read *illness* (疾). Additionally, the *Jia-Yi Jing* reads *while heat lingers* (而热留者)."*

*"Moreover, the *Treatise on Heat* states: ‘If sweating occurs yet the pulse remains rapid and robust, death follows.’ The *Treatise on Heat* refers to the ancient *Hot Disease Treatise*. After sweating, the pulse should slow and quiet, but if it remains rapid, tense, and full, it indicates **True Qi exhaustion** and **pathogen dominance**—thus, death is certain. Now, the pulse does not correspond with sweating; this is **inability to overcome the disease**, and death is manifest. A pulse that is not tranquil but rapid and robust is **non-correspondence**. Incoherent speech is **loss of will**—**loss of will** means death. Will aligns with essence; now essence has no means, so will has no dwelling—will, unanchored, is lost. Now three signs of death are seen, none of life—even if recovery seems possible, death is inevitable. Sweating with a rapid, robust pulse—**first death**; inability to overcome the disease—**second death**; incoherent speech and loss of will—**third death**."*

The Emperor asked: *"There are patients with fever, sweating, and restlessness—yet sweating does not alleviate their distress. What is this illness?"*

Qibo replied: *"If sweating occurs with fever, it is **Wind**; if sweating brings restlessness yet does not resolve, it is **Convulsion**. The illness is named **Wind-Convulsion**."*

The Emperor said: *"I wish to hear its full account."*

Qibo said: *"The **Jiuyang** channel governs the body’s qi, so it first receives the pathogen. The **Shaoyin** acts as its external covering—when heat arises, it ascends along with it, and **ascending** leads to **convulsion**."* (**Ascending** refers to Shaoyin following Taiyang upward.**)

The Emperor asked: *"How should it be treated?"*

Qibo replied: *"Use **acupuncture on the external covering**, and administer decoctions."* (**This means draining Taiyang and supplementing Shaoyin.** The decoction is to **check the ascending kidney-qi**.**)

The Emperor asked: *"What of **Labor Wind** as a disease?"*

Qibo replied: *"Labor Wind originates in the lungs’ domain—thus it is called **Labor Wind**."* (**Labor** refers to **kidney exhaustion**.**) The kidney channel ascends from the kidney, piercing the liver’s *ge*, and entering the lung—thus, kidney exhaustion generates wind, residing beneath the lung. Its symptoms cause the patient to **forcefully gaze upward**."* (**New Verification Notes:** *"According to Yang Shangshan, **forcefully upward** means a tendency to tilt the head back."*)

**Translation:**

*"Míngshì"* refers to closing the eyes yet seeing indistinctly. Again, in *The Thousand-Gold Prescriptions*, *"míngshì"* is rendered as *"dizziness of the eyes."* Saliva drips like mucus, aversion to wind with trembling chills—these are the symptoms of **Labor Wind**.

The **Bladder Channel** arises from the inner canthus, ascends to the forehead, intersecting at the crown, entering to network the brain, then descending to branch at the nape, following the inner aspect of the shoulder and spine to the waist, entering to network the kidney. Now, since kidney essence is insufficient, the Bladder externally draws in, and the Bladder’s *qi* cannot ascend to nourish—thus, the patient’s head and nape stiffen, and vision becomes indistinct.

The lungs, thinly assaulted by wind, with **labor-qi** ascending in demand, cause saliva to issue like nasal mucus. Kidney *qi* being insufficient, *yang* attacks internally, merging with **labor-heat**—thus, aversion to wind and trembling chills arise.

The Emperor asked: *"How should it be treated?"*

Qibo replied: *"By halting excessive flexion-extension."* (*"Sǎo"* means "to stop"; *"fǔyǎng"* refers to bending and stretching.) This means restraining movement to prevent **labor-qi** from further spreading.

For those of **Great Yang** (elderly), **reclaiming essence** takes three days; for those of middle years, five days; for those lacking clarity, seven days. (**New Verification Notes:** According to *The Canon of A and B*, it reads *"three days or five days,"* while *The Thousand-Gold Prescriptions* states *"awaiting three or five days, those lacking clarity."* This differs from the above.)

Coughing up greenish-yellow sputum, its form like pus, as large as a marble, emerging from the mouth or nose—if it does not emerge, the lungs are injured, and injury to the lungs means death.

The **Great Yang** refers to the **Bladder meridian**. The Bladder and Kidney form exterior-interior pairings, hence the **reclaiming of essence** by the **Great Yang**.

*"Great"* means *"great"* or *"large."* However, the **Taiyang meridian** absorbs and draws in essence-*qi*, ascending to assault the lungs—three days for the elderly, five days for those of middle years, and seven days for those who have never relied on essence-*qi*. At this point, they should cough up thick sputum, greenish-yellow like pus.

For those with **balanced coughing**, the sputum rises from the throat and exits through the mouth; for those with **sudden, violent coughing**, the *qi* surges against the **reservoir gate** and exits through the nose.

Such cases all stem from **Kidney *qi* exhaustion**, **Lung *qi* depletion**, and **Yang *qi* oppression**—thus, if the sputum does not emerge, the lungs are injured. Injury to the lungs causes the **Nourishing and Defensive *qi*** to disperse and dissolve, the **spirit** failing to govern internally, and thus death ensues.

---
**New Verification Notes:** According to Wang’s commentary: *"Sudden, violent coughing"*—the *qi* surges against the **reservoir gate** and exits through the nose. The *Nan Jing* mentions *"chongmen"* (reservoir gate), with no mention of *"zhimen"* (reservoir gate). It is likely a miswriting for *"zimen"* (responsibility gate). Yang Cao states: *"Gui"* refers to the *"ge"* (cauldron), where the stomach *qi* emerges; the stomach transmits grain-*qi* to the lungs, and since the lungs lie above the cauldron, the stomach is called the **responsibility gate**.

The Emperor asked: *"If one has **Kidney Wind**, with the face swollen and distended, impairing speech, should it be treated with acupuncture?"*

*"Cīrán"*—swollen and raised. *"Yōng"*—swelling beneath the eyes, resembling the shape of an external silkworm. The **Kidney meridian** ascends from the Kidney, piercing the liver’s cauldron, entering the lungs, and traveling along the throat beside the root of the tongue—thus impairing speech.

*"Yì"*—pronounced *mòjiāng*.

Qibo replied: *"It should not be needled when empty. Needling when it should not be needled will cause the disease-*qi* to arrive within five days."* *"Zhì"*—the arrival of the disease-*qi*. This is because the **Zang organs** are associated with a single day, and within five days, the *qi* reaches the Kidney.

Since the Kidney is already deficient, and **Wind** internally assails it, the swelling is considered **excess**. If needled excessively, it will further damage the **Zang *qi***; with **True *qi*** insufficient, it cannot recover, hence the disease-*qi* will arrive within five days.

The Emperor asked: *"What will its arrival entail?"*

Qibo replied: *"It will manifest as shortness of breath, intermittent fever, fever rising from the chest and back to the head, sweating, hot hands, dry mouth, bitter thirst, yellow urine, swelling beneath the eyes, abdominal rumbling, heaviness of the body making movement difficult, absent menstruation, restlessness with inability to eat, inability to lie flat—lying flat causes coughing. The disease is named **Wind-Water**, discussed in *The Methods of Needling*.*" (*The Methods of Needling*—a lost chapter in the current text.)

The Emperor asked: *"I wish to hear its explanation."*

Qibo replied: *"Where the evil lingers, the *qi* must be deficient. If **Yin** is deficient, **Yang** will necessarily assail it—thus shortness of breath, intermittent fever, and sweating. Yellow urine indicates heat in the lower abdomen. Inability to lie flat stems from stomach disharmony. Lying flat worsens coughing, as it presses upward against the lungs. All cases with **Water-*qi*** first show slight swelling beneath the eyes."*

The Emperor asked: *"Why is this so?"*

Qibo replied: *"Water is **Yin**; beneath the eyes is also **Yin**; the abdomen is where **ultimate Yin** resides. Thus, if Water is in the abdomen, it must cause swelling beneath the eyes. True *qi* reversing upward causes bitter taste, dry tongue, inability to lie flat—lying flat causes coughing up clear water. All Water diseases thus cannot be exposed externally; if exposed, it causes fright, and fright worsens coughing. Abdominal rumbling indicates the disease originates in the stomach. Assaulting the Spleen causes restlessness and inability to eat; inability to swallow food indicates stomach cauldron obstruction. Heaviness of the body and difficulty moving stem from the stomach meridian in the foot. Absent menstruation is due to **Bao meridian** closure—the **Bao meridian** belongs to the Heart and networks within the uterus. Now, since *qi* presses upward against the lungs, Heart *qi* cannot descend and communicate, hence menstruation ceases."*

The previous explanations remain unclear regarding *"fever rising from the chest and back to the head, sweating, hot hands, dry mouth, and bitter thirst."* This appears to be an omission or error in the ancient text.

What is the case? The **Kidney’s Shao Yin meridian** ascends from the Kidney, passing through the liver’s cauldron, entering the lungs, and traveling along the throat beside the root of the tongue.

Additionally, the **Bladder’s Taiyang meridian** ascends from the inner canthus, crossing the forehead to the crown; its branch extends from the crown to the upper ear corner, while its direct path enters to network with the brain, then descends separately along the nape, following the shoulder blade, entering beside the spine to reach the waist, and descending into the flank.

Now, since **Yin is deficient and Yang is excessive**, heat rises from the chest and back to the head, causing sweating, dry mouth, and bitter thirst. The Heart is a **Yang Zang organ**, its meridian traveling through the arm and hand. The Kidney is a **Yin Zang organ**, its meridian following the chest and foot. Kidney deficiency leads to Heart *qi* excess, hence the hot hands. Moreover, since both Heart and Kidney meridians belong to **Shao Yin**, the Emperor said: *"Excellent."* (Discussion of **inverted regulation** concludes.)

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Why does the human body sometimes feel neither excessively warm nor excessively hot—yet still experience heat with restlessness and fullness? It differs from the usual state, hence the term **‘unusual.’**"* (A new annotation reads: *"According to the *Jia Yi Jing*, the original text lacks the three characters ‘for the.’"*)

Qi Bo replied: *"When **Yin qi** is deficient and **Yang qi** prevails, heat arises with restlessness and fullness."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Why does the body not feel cold from external clothing, nor does the interior harbor cold **qi**—yet cold seem to emerge from within?*" (This implies confusion over which **Yin** or **Yang** factor serves as the primary source of the illness.)

Qi Bo said: *"This person has excessive **bi qi** (stagnant **qi**), with **Yang qi** deficient and **Yin qi** abundant. Thus, the body feels cold as if emerging from water."* (This indicates that the condition stems from the imbalance of **Yin** and **Yang** within the body’s own **qi**, not from external cold or internal cold **qi**.)

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Why does a person have all four limbs hot, and upon encountering wind and cold, feel scorched like by fire?"* (A new annotation reads: *"According to the original text by Quan Yuanqi, the phrase ‘like by fire’ is absent; the *Tai Su* text reads ‘scorched as in fire,’ hence the adoption of the *Tai Su* version.*")

Qi Bo replied: *"This person has **Yin qi** depleted and **Yang qi** excessive. The four limbs belong to **Yang**, and when two **Yang** forces combine, while **Yin qi** is deficient and weak, the insufficient **Yin** (water) cannot extinguish the rampant **Yang** (fire). Thus, **Yang** alone dominates, and when **Yang** alone dominates, it cannot sustain growth—it merely prevails and ceases.*" (Water represents **Yin**, fire represents **Yang**; now, since **Yang qi** is in excess and **Yin qi** is insufficient, it is said that ‘insufficient water cannot extinguish rampant fire.’*) The term *治* (here) means **"prevail"** or **"dominate,"** while *胜* means **"excessive"** or **"overpowering."**

Thus it is said: **"When Yang alone prevails, it merely dominates and then ceases."**

When encountering wind and feeling scorched like fire, this person’s flesh will **wither**—*wither* meaning **decay**. It means that over time, this person’s flesh will **waste away**.

*(New annotation: The phrase "as scorched like fire" should follow the Tai Su version: "as scorched by fire.")*

The Emperor asked: *"There are people who feel cold in their bodies—hot water cannot warm them, thick clothing cannot keep them warm, yet they do not shiver. What illness is this?"*

Qi Bo replied: *"This person’s **kidney qi** has long been excessive#5, and they are of a **water**-dominated constitution. The **Taiyang** energy is declining, the **kidney fat** is withered and does not grow. One **water** cannot overpower two **fires**—the **kidney** is **water**, yet it arises from the **bones**. If the **kidney** does not thrive, the **marrow** cannot fill, and thus the cold reaches even the bones.

*‘To be of a **water**-dominated constitution’ means their desires are excessive.*

The reason they do not shiver is that the **liver** is one **Yang**, the **heart** is two **Yang**, and the **kidney** is a **lonely organ**—one **water** cannot overpower two **fires**, so they do not shiver. The disease is called **bone impediment (gu bi)**, and this person’s joints will **contract**.

*If the **kidney** does not thrive, the **marrow** does not fill; if the **marrow** does not fill, the **sinews** dry and shrink, causing the joints to stiffen and lock.*

The Emperor asked: *"There are people whose flesh is **prickly**—even when close to quilts and padding, they still feel prickly. What illness is this?"*
*Prickly (ke) is pronounced as in ‘cure’ (lǜ).*

Qi Bo replied: *"Their **Nutritive Qi (Rong)** is deficient, while their **Defensive Qi (Wei)** is excessive. If **Nutritive Qi** is deficient, they feel **numb**; if **Defensive Qi** is deficient, they feel **weak**. If both **Nutritive** and **Defensive Qi** are deficient, they are **numb and weak**, and their flesh remains as it is. The person’s body and will no longer align—this is called **daily death**. The body does not respond to the will, and the will does not fulfill the body’s needs—these two seem to have no connection."*

*(New annotation: According to the Jia Yi Jing, "daily death" should read "thirty-day death.")*

The Emperor asked: *"There are people with **rebellious qi** who cannot lie down and whose breathing makes a sound; some cannot go outside and whose breathing is silent; some whose breathing makes a sound though their daily activities are normal; some who wheeze when lying down or walking; some who wheeze when unable to go outside and cannot walk; and some who wheeze when unable to go outside at all. What organ causes these conditions? I wish to know the reason."*

Qi Bo replied: *"Those who cannot go outside and whose breathing makes a sound suffer from **rebellious Yangming**. The **foot three Yang** meridians descend, but now they rebel and ascend—thus their breathing makes a sound.

**Yangming** is the **stomach meridian**, and the **stomach** is the **sea of the six fu**, the **sea of water and grain**. Its **qi** also descends. When **Yangming** rebels and cannot follow its proper path, they cannot go outside.

As the *Lower Classic* says: ‘If the **stomach** is not harmonized, the exterior will not be at ease.’ This is what is meant.

*The **Lower Classic** refers to the ancient Upper Classic.*"

「Now, if one’s daily activities remain unchanged but breathing emits a sound, this is due to **rebellious Lung network meridians**—the network meridians cannot follow the main meridians in their normal ascent and descent, so they linger in the main meridians and fail to move freely. The diseases of network meridians are subtle, hence daily activities remain unchanged while breathing emits a sound.

As for those who cannot go outside at all and thus wheeze, this is the **intrusion of Water-qi**. For Water-qi flows along the **body fluids**, and the **kidneys** are the **reservoir of water**, governing the **body fluids**, as well as **sleep and wheezing**.

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Well spoken."*

Upon further examination of the text’s meaning, there are cases where one cannot go outside and yet breathes without sound, cases where one can go outside but still wheezes, and cases where one cannot go outside and cannot walk, yet wheezes—these three distinctions are all missing and not yet discussed. This is likely an omission from the ancient texts.

**In the *Cao Lun* (Discussion on Malaria):**
The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Both **intermittent fever** and **malaria** originate from **wind**, yet why do they manifest at specific times?*

**Cao** (瘠) is akin to **old** (老), also meaning **emaciated** (瘦).
○The *New Corrected Edition* states: *"According to the *Jia Yi Jing* (甲乙经), ‘Both **malaria** and **fever** originate from **wind**, yet why do they act by the **day** and erupt at specific **times**?’ This differs from the current text."*

*The *Tai Su* (太素) aligns with the current text.*

Yang Shangshan (杨上善) notes: *"Cao* (瘠) may refer to cases where attacks occur every two days, known as **two-day malaria**; yet this text only describes summer injury from **heat** turning into autumnal disease, sometimes as **wasting malaria** (疳疟), or simply **malaria**, without specifying the frequency of attacks by days. It merely responds to the **four seasons**, and the symptoms vary, thus it is only called *cao* (瘠)."*

Qi Bo replied: *"When malaria first erupts, it begins in the **hair follicles** (毫毛), followed by stretching and yawning, then **chills and shivering** (寒栗), **shaking** (鼓颔), and **pain in the lumbar region and spine** (腰脊俱痛). When the **chills** recede, **internal and external heat** (内外皆热) ensues, with **headache as if the skull were splitting** (头痛如破), and **thirst with a desire to drink in large gulps** (渴欲玲饮).

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What **qi** causes this? I wish to hear its **Dao/Way**."*

Qi Bo said: *"The **Yin** and **Yang** forces rise and fall, contending in exchange, with **emptiness** and **fullness** alternating. This is because **Yin** and **Yang** **qi** shift positions—**Yang qi** descends to its utmost then ascends, while **Yin qi** ascends to its utmost then descends. Thus, it is said that **Yin** and **Yang** forces rise and fall, contending.

When **Yang qi** is deficient, the body feels **external cold**; when **Yin qi** is deficient, **internal heat** arises. When **Yang qi** is excessive, the body feels **external heat**; when **Yin qi** is excessive, **internal cold** arises. From this, when **chills** recede, **heat** emerges, and **emptiness** and **fullness** alternate, causing the **Yin** and **Yang** **qi** to shift and transform. When **Yang qi** merges with **Yin**, **Yin** becomes **full** while **Yang** is deficient; when **Yangming** (胃脉, the Stomach channel) is deficient, **chills and shivering** (寒栗) and **shaking** (鼓颔) occur.

When **Yang qi** merges with **Yin**, it means **Yang qi** enters the **Yin** domain. **Yangming** (胃脉, the Stomach channel) converges at the **oral cavity** (承浆), then retreats and branches downward along the **posterior mandible** (下廉), emerging at **Dà Yíng** (大迎). Its divergent branch descends from **Dà Yíng** forward to **Rén Yíng** (人迎). Hence, when **Yang qi** is insufficient, one feels **aversion to cold**, **chills and shivering**, and **vibration of the jaw** (颐颌振动).

When the **Large Intestine channel** (巨肠, 膀胱脉, the Bladder channel) is deficient, **pain in the lumbar region, spine, and occiput** (腰背头项痛) arises. The **Great Yang** (巨阳) refers to the **Bladder channel** (膀胱脉). Its **pathway** (咏) branches downward from the head, follows the **inner shoulder** (循肩膊内), runs alongside the **spine** (侠脊), and reaches the **lumbar region** (抵腰中). Thus, when its **qi** is insufficient, **pain in the lumbar region, spine, and occiput** arises.

When all three **Yang channels** (三阳) are deficient, **Yin qi** prevails, and **Yin qi** prevailing causes **bone coldness and pain** (骨寒而痛). **Chills** originate from within, so both **internal and external coldness** occur. When **Yang qi** is excessive, **external heat** arises; when **Yin qi** is deficient, **internal heat** arises. If **internal and external heat** both emerge, **panting** (喘) and **thirst** occur, hence the desire to **drink in large gulps** (玲饮).

**Heat** injures **qi**, so when **internal and external heat** both arise, **panting** and **thirst** occur. All these symptoms stem from **summer injury** (夏伤) by **heat** (暑), where **heat qi** is excessive and lodges within the **skin** (皮肤), outside the **intestines and stomach** (肠胃). This is where the **Nourishing qi** (荣气) resides. Outside the **intestines and stomach**, the **Nourishing qi** (荣气) governs, hence it is said that this is where the **Nourishing qi** resides.

**Convergence** (合) is akin to **residing**. This makes one’s **pores** (汗空) **loose** (疏), allowing **pathogenic factors** to invade. When autumn arrives, **sweat** (汗出) emerges and encounters **wind**, or if one contracts it through bathing, **water pathogenic factors** (水气) lodge within the **skin**, residing alongside the **Defensive qi** (卫气). The **Defensive qi** (卫气) circulates through the **Yang** domain by day and through the **Yin** domain by night. When it encounters **Yang**, it emerges externally; when it encounters **Yin**, it withdraws internally. When **internal and external Defensive qi** (卫气) converge, the disease manifests each day.

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Why does the disease manifest on alternating days?"* (间日发作)

Qi Bo replied: *"The pathogenic **qi** lodges deeply within, withdrawing into the **Yin** domain. **Yang qi** alone emerges, while **Yin evil** (阴邪) remains internally. **Yin** and **Yang** contend, and the pathogenic **qi** cannot fully emerge, hence the disease manifests on alternating days. Since it does not meet with the **Defensive qi**, it erupts every other day."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Excellent."* (善) *"Why does the disease manifest later in the day in some cases and earlier in others?"* (其作日晏与其日早者)

Qi Bo replied: *"When pathogenic **qi** invades the **Wind Palace** (风府), it descends along the **spine’s sides** (循膂而下). The **Wind Palace** (风府) is an acupuncture point located at the nape, two *cùn* (寸) above the hairline and two *cùn* (寸) from the midline, within the **great sinew** (大筋) at the **base of the neck** (宛宛中). **Shè** (膂) refers to the **lateral sides of the spine** (脊两傍).

The **Defensive qi** (卫气) gathers at the **Wind Palace** (风府) each day and night, descending one **vertebral segment** (节) each subsequent day. Thus, the disease manifests later (晏), as the pathogenic **qi** first lodges in the **back** (脊背). Each time it reaches the **Wind Palace** (风府), the **Defensive qi** opens the **pathway**, allowing pathogenic **qi** to enter. When pathogenic **qi** enters, the disease erupts, causing the disease’s manifestation to grow progressively later each day. The **vertebral segment** (节) refers to the **joints of the spine** (脊骨之节), but when pathogenic **qi** is distant, its convergence is delayed, hence the manifestation occurs in the evening (暮).

When it emerges from the **Wind Palace** (风府), it descends one **vertebral segment** (节) each day, reaching the **sacrum** (骸骨) by the **25th day** (二十五日), then entering the **spinal interior** (脊内) on the **26th day** (二十六日), and flowing into the **hidden sinew pathway** (伏膂之脉). From the **nape** (项) downward to the **tailbone** (尾骯), there are roughly **24 segments** (节), hence it descends one **segment** each day, reaching the **sacrum** on the **25th day**, and entering the **spinal interior** on the **26th day**, flowing into the **hidden sinew pathway** (伏膂之脉). The **hidden sinew pathway** (伏膂之脉) refers to the **pathway of the Kidney channel** (肾脉) that runs concealed between the **sinews** (膂筋), as the **Kidney channel** (肾脉) ascends along the **inner thigh** (循股内), then follows the **posterior knee** (后康), pierces the **spine**, and connects to the **kidneys** (属肾). Its **straight pathway** (直行者) ascends from the **kidneys**, passing through the **liver** (贯肝), entering the **diaphragmatic region** (鬲), and reaching the **lungs** (入肺中). Since it pierces the **spine** (贯脊), it does not directly correspond to standard **acupuncture points** (应行穴), but instead follows the **hidden sinew pathway** (循膂伏行), hence it is called the **hidden sinew pathway** (伏膂脉).

The disease that manifests on alternating days arises because pathogenic **qi** withdraws internally into the **five Zàng** (五藏), connecting horizontally with the **membrane’s source** (募原). Its **pathway** (道) is distant, its **qi** deep, and its progression slow, unable to align with the **Defensive qi** (卫气) in its circulation. Unable to emerge fully, the disease thus manifests on alternating days. **Membrane’s source** (募原) refers to the **diaphragmatic region’s root and system** (鬲募之原系).

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Master Qi Bo says that the **Defensive qi** (卫气) reaches the **Wind Palace** (风府) each day, and when it does, the **pathway** opens (胜理开), allowing pathogenic **qi** to enter, and the disease erupts. But if the **Defensive qi** descends one **segment** (节) each day, its emergence should not be at the **Wind Palace**; how does it manifest daily?"* (今卫气日下一节，其气之发也不当风府；其日作者奈何？)

The **new annotated revision** states: *"According to the text of Quán Yuánqǐ, from this point onward, the **pathway** (道) of the pathogenic **qi** resides in the head and nape, descending when the **Defensive qi** (卫气) does, hence the eighty-eight characters all speak of this. This pathogenic **qi** lingers in the head and nape, descending along the **pathways** (膂) of the **Zàng** (藏), thus the distinction between **void** (虚) and **replete** (实) states, and when the pathogenic **qi** occupies different regions, it does not align with the **Wind Palace** (风府) of the **Defensive qi**. Therefore, when pathogenic **qi** occupies the head and nape, the disease erupts as the **Defensive qi** reaches the head and nape; when it occupies the back, the disease erupts as the **Defensive qi** reaches the back; when it occupies the lumbar and sacral regions, the disease erupts as the **Defensive qi** reaches the lumbar and sacral regions; when it occupies the hands and feet, the disease erupts as the **Defensive qi** reaches the hands and feet. Hence, the lower sections [of the text] prescribe needling based on the region where the pathogenic **qi** resides.

Where the **Defensive qi** (卫气) converges with the pathogenic **qi**, the disease erupts. Therefore, the **Wind Palace** is not constant, and wherever the **Defensive qi** emerges, it opens the **pathway** (胜理) for the pathogenic **qi** to enter, and wherever the pathogenic **qi** converges, that becomes its **palace** (府). Since **void** (虚) and **replete** (实) differ, and the pathogenic **qi** occupies varied regions, when the **Defensive qi** and the pathogenic **qi** converge, the disease erupts—not always aligning with the **Wind Palace** for its manifestation."* (The new annotated revision states: *"According to the text of Quán Yuánqǐ and the *Jia Yi Jing* (《甲乙经》), from this point onward, the pathogenic **qi** lingers in the head and nape, descending as the **Defensive qi** does, hence the eighty-eight characters all speak of this.

Hence, the lower sections prescribe needling based on the region where the pathogenic **qi** resides. The **Defensive qi**, where it converges with pathogenic **qi**, gives rise to the disease. Therefore, the **Wind Palace** is not fixed, and wherever the **Defensive qi** emerges, it opens the **pathway** for pathogenic **qi** to enter, and wherever the pathogenic **qi** converges, that becomes its **palace**. Since **void** and **replete** differ, and the pathogenic **qi** occupies varied regions, when the **Defensive qi** and the pathogenic **qi** converge, the disease erupts—not always aligning with the **Wind Palace** for its manifestation."*)

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Well said. Now, the **Wind** (风) and **cold-induced malaria** (疟) share similarities and belong to the same category, yet **Wind** persists constantly, while **cold-induced malaria** has periodic rest—why is this so?"*

Qi Bo replied: *"The **qi** of **Wind** lingers in its place, hence its constancy; the **qi** of **cold-induced malaria** follows the **pathways** (经络) and **meridians** (胜理), descending internally and pressing outward. When the **Defensive qi** (卫气) aligns with it, the disease erupts."* (The **new annotated revision** states: *"According to the *Jia Yi Jing* (《甲乙经》), the text reads: ‘descending as the **Defensive qi** does, then its **qi** transmits internally.’ The text of Quán Yuánqǐ and *Tai Su* (《太素》) also follow this. ‘Lingers’ means to remain fixed; ‘follows’ means to accompany."*)

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Why does **cold-induced malaria** (疟) first manifest as **Cold** (寒) and then as **Heat** (热)?"*

Qi Bo replied: *"In summer, one is injured by **Great Heat** (大暑), causing excessive **sweating** (汗). The **pathway** (胜理) opens and the **qi** erupts, then encountering the **Cold** (寒) of the lingering summer **qi** (夏气), which presses inward. In autumn, one is injured by **Wind** (风), and thus the disease is formed."* (The **new annotated revision** states: *"According to the *Jia Yi Jing* and *Tai Su*, the text reads: ‘the lingering **Cold** (小寒) presses inward.’ ‘Great Heat’ is the **yang** **qi**; when injured by **Wind**, the **yang** **qi** is obstructed, hence in autumn, one is injured by **Wind**, and thus the disease is formed. **Cold** is the **yin** **qi**, and **Wind** is the **yang** **qi**; first injured by **Cold**, then by **Wind**, hence it first manifests as **Cold** and then as **Heat**. The disease erupts at fixed times, thus it is called **Cold Malaria** (寒疟). When exposed to **dew** (露) and **cold** (寒), the **Wind** and **Cold** injure the body."*)

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Why does it first manifest as **Heat** (热) and then as **Cold** (寒)?"*

Qi Bo replied: *"This is because one is first injured by **Wind** (风) and then by **Cold** (寒), hence it first manifests as **Heat** and then as **Cold**. It also erupts at fixed times, thus it is called **Warm Malaria** (温疟). Because it first manifests as **Heat**, it is called **Warm** (温). When it manifests solely as **Heat** without **Cold**, the **yin** **qi** is first exhausted, and the **yang** **qi** erupts alone, leading to **scanty breath** (少气), **vexation** (烦冤), and **hot extremities** (手足热) with **nausea** (欲呕), thus it is called **Heat Malaria** (瘴疟). **Heat Malaria** refers to extreme **Heat** (极热)."* (The pronunciation of **瘴** is *zhuàng*, with the tone of *dàn* (干).)

The Yellow Emperor said: *"The classics state that **excess** (有余) should be **drained** (写), and **deficiency** (不足) should be **supplemented** (补). Now, **Heat** (热) is **excess**, and **Cold** (寒) is **deficiency**. The **Cold** (寒) in **malaria** (疟) cannot be warmed by **hot water** (汤) or **fire** (火), and when it erupts as **Heat**, **ice** (冰) or **cold water** (水) cannot cool it. These are all cases of **excess** and **deficiency**. At such times, even a skilled practitioner cannot stop it, and it must be allowed to decline before needling is applied—what is the reason for this?"*

*"I wish to hear your explanation. Why not simply let it reach its peak and then cease?"*

Qi Bo replied: *"The classics state that one should not needle the **intense Heat** (缟缟) of **malaria**, nor the **sluggish pulse** (浑浑) or the **profuse sweating** (洒洒) of **malaria**. Hence, it is said that the disease is in opposition and cannot yet be treated."* (The **new annotated revision** states: *"According to the text of Quán Yuánqǐ and *Tai Su*, the text reads: ‘one should not needle the **intense Heat** (气) of **malaria**.’ ‘缟’ is pronounced as *guǎn*, with the tone of *yāo* (妖). ‘Intense Heat’ means extreme **Heat**; ‘sluggish pulse’ means without discernible pattern; ‘profuse sweating’ means excessive **sweating**."* (The pronunciation of **洒** is *lù*, with the tone of *lù* (鹿).)

*"When **malaria** first erupts, the **yang** **qi** converges with the **yin**, and at that time, the **yin** is **void** while the **yang** is **replete**. Externally, there is no **qi**, hence it first manifests as **Cold** (寒) with **shivering** (栗). When the **yin** **qi** reaches its peak of obstruction, the **yang** **qi** then emerges again. The **yang** and **yin** **qi** converge externally once more, and thus the **yin** becomes **void** while the **yang** is **replete**, hence it first manifests as **Heat** (热) with **thirst** (渴). When the **yin** **qi** is **replete**, the **stomach** (胃) is **Cold**, hence it first manifests as **Cold** with **shivering**; when the **yang** **qi** is **replete**, the **stomach** is **Hot**, hence it first manifests as **Heat** with **desire to drink** (欲饮). The **qi** of **malaria** converges with **yang**, and the **yang** prevails; it converges with **yin**, and the **yin** prevails. When the **yin** prevails, there is **Cold**; when the **yang** prevails, there is **Heat**. **Malaria** is the **violent** (暴) **qi** of **Wind** and **Cold**, which is not constant and repeats when the disease reaches its extreme."* (The **new annotated revision** states: *"According to the *Jia Yi Jing*, the text reads: ‘**malaria** is the **violent** **qi** of **Wind** and **Cold**, which is not constant, and repeats when the disease reaches its extreme.’ The text of Quán Yuánqǐ and *Tai Su* reads: ‘**malaria** is the **qi** of **Wind** and **Cold**, which is not constant, and repeats when the disease reaches its extreme.’ The character ‘至’ (至) connects with the preceding sentence, differing from Wáng Shì’s interpretation. The eruption of the disease is like the **Heat** of fire, or the **violence** of wind and rain that cannot be withstood. Because of its extreme intensity, it cannot be withstood. Hence the classics say: ‘When its **peak** (盛) is **correct** (方), one must **drain** (毁) it,’ and ‘When it **declines** (衰), treatment must be **vigorous** (大昌).’ This is what is meant. ‘方’ means ‘correct’ or ‘proper.’ When the disease is at its **peak**, one must **drain** it, or one may harm the **true** **qi** (真气), hence it is said to **drain** (毁). When the disease has declined and one **supplements** the **qi** of the **meridians** (经气), the pathogenic **qi** will further retreat, and the **true** **qi** will stabilize, hence it is said to **prosper greatly** (大昌). Before the disease erupts, the **yin** has not yet converged with the **yang**, nor the **yang** with the **yin**. If one adjusts it accordingly, the **true** **qi** will stabilize, and the pathogenic **qi** will vanish. The **draining** (写) and **supplementing** (补) are **correct** (铃), and the **pathways** (爻) are **proper** (当), hence the **true** **qi** stabilizes and the pathogenic **qi** vanishes."*)

The skilled physician cannot treat it once it has erupted, for the **qi** is in reverse. The **true** **qi** is suppressed, while the pathogenic **qi** thrives unchecked; when the **true** **qi** cannot overcome the pathogenic **qi**, this is what is meant by **reverse**.

The Emperor said, *"Excellent."* How should one **attack** it? What about timing—when should one act?

Gebi replied: When the **malaria** is about to erupt, the **yin** and **yang** are about to shift, and it must begin from the four extremities. When **yang** is already injured, **yin** follows, so one must **fortify** the affected areas **beforehand** and **bind** them tightly, preventing the pathogenic **qi** from entering and the **yin** **qi** from escaping. Carefully observe the **pulse**—when the **true** **qi** is still moving through the **collateral vessels** and **network vessels** and has not yet fully converged, **bleed** them all. This is when the **true** **qi** is still departing but has not yet fully withdrawn. *"Fortify"* means to **bind** the four limbs tightly, so that the **qi** remains in its proper place, and the pathogenic **qi**’s location will then reveal itself. Once revealed, **bleed** it out.

*"Departing"* is akin to *"leaving."*

The Emperor said: If the **malaria** does not erupt, what should one look for?

Gebi replied: The **malaria** **qi** must alternately surge and decline, corresponding to where the **qi** resides. If the disease is in the **yang**, there will be heat and a **frenetic pulse**; if in the **yin**, there will be cold and a **tranquil pulse**. Since **yin** is tranquil and **yang** is frenetic, the **pulse** follows accordingly. When both reach their extremes, **yin** and **yang** both decline, the **defensive** **qi** separates, and thus the disease abates. When the **defensive** **qi** gathers again, the disease recurs. When **yin** and **yang** clash to their utmost, extremes invert—thus, when they reach their peak, both **yin** and **yang** decline.

The Emperor said: Sometimes the fever recurs every two days or even several days apart, and sometimes there is thirst, sometimes not. What is the reason for this?

Gebi replied: The recurrence of the fever is due to the pathogenic **qi** and **defensive** **qi** lingering in the six **fu** organs, sometimes failing to meet, unable to converge, hence the intervals before the fever returns. When the **qi** does not meet, the fever cannot erupt for several days.

**Malaria** arises from the alternating dominance of **yin** and **yang**, sometimes severe, sometimes mild, hence the variation in thirst. When **yang** dominates and **yin** is severely weakened, there is thirst; when **yang** dominates but **yin** is not severely weakened, there is no thirst. *"Dominates"* means it is stronger than the opposing **qi**.

The Emperor said: The classics state, *"If one is injured by summer heat, one will inevitably fall ill with **malaria** in autumn."* Yet not all cases of **malaria** correspond to this—why is that?

Gebi replied: This is in accordance with the four seasons. When the disease manifests differently, it is contrary to the seasons. For those who fall ill in autumn, the cold is severe—autumn’s **qi** is clear and cool, **yang** descends, and heat is stored in the muscles, hence the severe cold. For those who fall ill in winter, the cold is not severe—winter’s **qi** is harsh and cold, **yang** is concealed, not contending with the cold, hence the cold is not severe. For those who fall ill in spring, they dislike wind—spring’s **qi** is mild and warm, **yang** disperses outward, internally strengthening and opening, hence they dislike wind. For those who fall ill in summer, they sweat profusely—summer’s **qi** is hot, **fluids** are abundant, and they disperse through the skin, hence the excessive sweating.

The Emperor said: How does **temperate malaria** and **cold malaria** differ in their **lodging**? Where do they reside in the **zang**? Why do they **settle** there?

*"Lodging"* means where they reside. *"Zang"* refers to the five **spiritual** **zang** organs.

Gebi replied: **Temperate malaria** is contracted in winter from exposure to wind and cold, with the pathogenic **qi** lodging in the **bone marrow**. When spring arrives, **yang** surges greatly, and the pathogenic **qi**, unable to escape on its own, encounters intense summer heat. The **brain marrow** is consumed, muscles atrophy, and the **natural** **pathways** open and release **qi**—perhaps due to exertion—causing the pathogenic **qi** and sweat to exit together. This disease lodges in the **kidneys**, its **qi** first emerging from within and then dispersing outward. The **kidneys** govern winter, winter governs **bone marrow**, and the brain is the **sea of marrow**, with upper and lower correspondences. When **heat** rises and **ulcers**, the **marrow** is consumed, and as the **marrow** is consumed, **heat** **qi** disperses outward, causing muscles to wither—thus, the disease lodges in the **kidneys**.

Such cases involve **yin** deficiency and **yang** excess; **yang** excess brings heat, while **yin** deficiency—meaning the **kidney’s** stored **qi** is depleted—and **yang** excess—meaning the **Bladder’s** **Taiyang** **qi** is strong—when the disease declines, the **qi** returns inward. When it returns inward, **yang** weakens, and **yang** weakness brings cold. Hence, it first manifests as heat, then as cold, and is called **temperate malaria**.

*"Declines"* refers to the disease’s retreat. *"Returns inward"* means it enters the **kidney’s** **yin** **vessels**.

The Emperor said: What of **marsh malaria**?

Gebi replied: **Marsh malaria** arises when the **lungs** inherently harbor **heat** **qi**, which surges upward in **ulceration**, with the **middle** **qi** being solid and not dispersing outward. If one then exerts themselves, the **natural** **pathways** open, and wind and cold lodge between the skin and muscles, where the fever erupts. When it erupts, **yang** **qi** thrives, and if it does not decline, the disease persists. Its **qi** does not reach the **yin**—

Cháo Yuánfāng states: *"Its qi does not reach the yin"*—meaning it does not return inward.

Thus, it only manifests as heat and not cold, with its qi concealed within the **heart** and lodged externally between the skin and muscles. This causes the flesh to waste away and muscles to wither, hence it is called **marsh malaria**.

The Emperor said: *"Good."*

**Needle the Malaria Chapter**

The malaria of the **Foot Taiyang** meridian causes lower back pain and heaviness of the head, with chill beginning in the back.

The **Foot Taiyang** (Bladder) meridian’s course enters the **glomus of the brain** (脳) from the crown, descends to branch beneath the nape, follows the inner aspect of the shoulder, and flanks the spine to reach the waist’s center. Its divergent branches separate from the inner shoulder, spreading left and right to pierce the **臀** (buttocks), passing through the **spleen pivot** (脾枢).

Thus, it causes lower back pain and heaviness of the head, with chill beginning in the back.

**Newly verified annotation states:** According to the *Three Divisions and Nine Officials Treatise* (《三部九侯论》), the term **贯肿** (pierce the swelling) is corrected to **贯臀** (pierce the buttocks) in the *Needle Lower Back Pain* (《刺腰痛》) annotation as well. The *Discourse on Syncope* (《厥论》) annotation renders it **贯肿**, while the *Canon of Medicine in Categories A and B* (《甲乙经》) also uses **贯肿**.

The onset is chill followed by heat, with a **dizzy, faint, and scorching sensation** (缟搞暍暍然). **缟缟** (dizzy) describes extreme heat, and **暍暍** (scorching) also indicates intense heat. Since the **Taiyang** (Bladder) meridian is deficient, chill appears first; when the chill reaches its peak, heat arises—thus, heat follows. **暍** (scorching, pronounced *yè*) ceases when sweating emerges, yet it proves difficult to resolve.

**Newly verified annotation states:** The full text of **Quán Yuánqǐ** (全元起) and the *Canon of Medicine in Categories A and B* (《甲乙经》), as well as the *Essentials of the Taiyang and Taiping Canons* (《太素》), all render this as "chill first, heat later, with thirst; when thirst ceases, sweating emerges"—differing from this passage. Needling the **部中** (meridian’s central section) induces bleeding.

The **Taiyang’s *you***—this is called **Jīnmén** (Golden Gate).
**Jīnmén** lies below the outer ankle, also named **Rìguānliáng** (Sun’s Pass Bridge), where the **Yang Maintenance** (*Yángwéi*) meridian branches.
Needling may penetrate to **three *cùn*** (fifths of the body’s height), or if moxibustion is applied, **three *zhàng*** (sessions) may be used.
The *Huángdì Zhōnggào Tújīng* states: *Wěizhōng* governs it.
Thus, the ancient method took *Wěizhōng* as the *youzhōng* (central *you*).

*Wěizhōng* lies at the center of the buttock, near the **File Mark’s** pulsating artery, where the **Taiyang** meridian of the foot enters.
Needling may penetrate to **five *cùn***, retained for seven breaths; if moxibustion is applied, **three *zhàng*** may be used.
**New verification states:** Examining the *you* needling in the *Jīayǔ Jīng*, it reads *pīnzhōng* (buttock center).
Now, Wang’s two annotations concur—*pīnzhōng* should be taken as correct.

For **fever of the *Shàoyáng*** (foot *Minor Yang*), it makes the body’s **chills and heats alternate**—
the body’s chills and heats alternate,
then as follows:
chill is not severe, heat is not severe,
since **Yang qi** is not yet盛 (*shèng*), thus it behaves thus.
One **avoids people**, and upon seeing people, the heart trembles—
the **gallbladder** and **liver** are paired; when the liver is vacuous, its **#1** *xie* (evil) **thins its qi**, hence one avoids people, and upon seeing them, the heart trembles.
Heat is excessive, sweating is profuse—
when **evil is盛**, heat is excessive; **wind-stroke** causes sweating.
Needle the **foot *Shàoyáng***. **Xiáxī** governs it.

**Xiáxī** lies at the junction of the second toe (next to the little toe) on the foot, in the depression before the metatarsal bone—this is the **honor vessel** of *Shàoyáng*. Needling may penetrate to three *cùn* (same-length units as the body), retaining the needle for three breaths. If moxibustion is applied, three *zhàng* may be used.

For **fever of the *Yángmíng*** (foot *Major Yang*), it makes one first experience chills—shivering and trembling—with severe chills lasting long before heat arrives. When the heat subsides, sweating occurs, and one finds relief upon seeing sunlight, moonlight, or fire. When **Yang is vacuous**, the exterior first feels cold; when Yang vacuity reaches its extreme, it rebounds in excess, hence the severe chills lasting long before heat arrives. When the heat subsides and sweating ceases, **Yin internally grows strong**, and since Yang cannot overcome Yin, one finds relief upon seeing sunlight, moonlight, or fire.

Needle **Fùshàng** on the foot *Yángmíng*. This is the **Chōngyáng** point.
It lies five *cùn* above the ankle on the bone, where the pulsating artery is found. Three *cùn* above the **Xiagǔ** depression, this is the **source** of *Yángmíng*. Needling may penetrate to three *cùn*, retaining the needle for ten breaths. If moxibustion is applied, three *zhàng* may be used.
**Fùshàng** is pronounced *fù* (as in "deliver").

For **fever of the *Tàiyīn*** (foot *Greater Yin*), it makes one discontented, prone to deep sighing—
when **heart qi flows into the lungs**, joy arises, but the **spleen’s storage** receives the illness. The **heart (mother)** attempts to rescue it, and **fire-qi descends into the spleen**, failing to ascend to the lungs.
Additionally, the *Tàiyīn* vessel branches and ascends from the stomach to the **epigastrium**, entering the heart. Hence, one becomes discontented and prone to deep sighing.
One loses appetite, with frequent chills, heats, and sweating—
the **spleen governs transformation of grains**, and **nutritive qi** assists the four limbs. Now that **evil thins its qi**, all the **viscera lack nourishment**; earth relies on the four seasons, and when the **sovereign (spleen) is weak**, **pathogenic qi contend**. Hence, one loses appetite, with frequent chills, heats, and sweating.
**Newly corrected text states:** According to the *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng*, it reads: "Frequent chills, little heat."
When the illness arrives, one becomes prone to vomiting; after vomiting, the illness wanes.
The *Tàiyīn* vessel of the foot enters the abdomen, connecting to the spleen and networked with the stomach, ascending to the **epigastrium** and **Xiáyǐn**. Hence, when the pathogenic qi arrives, vomiting occurs, and after vomiting, the illness wanes. **Take it immediately.**
Wait for the illness to wane, then **take it**—this refers to needling the **jing-well** and **yuan-source** points, as well as **Gōngsūn**.
**Gōngsūn** lies one *cùn* behind the base of the big toe on the foot, a *Tàiyīn* network point. Needling may penetrate to four *cùn*, retaining the needle for seven breaths. If moxibustion is applied, three *zhàng* may be used.

For **fever of the *Shàoyīn*** (foot *Minor Yin*), it causes severe vomiting, with frequent chills and heats—more heat than chills—
the *Shàoyīn* vessel of the foot pierces the **liver’s epigastrium**, entering the lungs, and follows the throat. Hence, severe vomiting occurs, with frequent chills and heats. The **kidney is the Yin viscera**, and **Yin-qi generates cold**; now that **Yin-qi is insufficient**, heat predominates over chills.
**Newly corrected text states:** According to the *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng*, it reads: "Severe vomiting, frequent chills, little heat."
One desires to shut oneself in darkness, and the illness is difficult to cure.
The *Yángmíng* vessel of the stomach, when diseased, desires solitude in darkness—now this refers to **stomach (earth) illness**, yet **kidney (water) is affected**; earth **executes water**, hence the illness is difficult to cure.
**Tàizhōng** and **Tàixī** govern it.
**Tàizhōng** lies in the depression behind the inner ankle’s **street** (midline), a *Shàoyīn* network point. Needling may penetrate to two *cùn*, retaining the needle for seven breaths. If moxibustion is applied, three *zhàng* may be used.
**Tàixī** lies in the depression above the heel’s pulsating artery behind the inner ankle, the *Shàoyīn* **yuan-source** point. Needling may penetrate to three *cùn*, retaining the needle for seven breaths. If moxibustion is applied, three *zhàng* may be used.
**Newly corrected text states:** According to the *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng*, it reads: "The illness is difficult to cure; take **Tàixī**."
Additionally, according to the *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng*, **Tàizhōng** is recorded as **"suōzhōng behind the heel"**; in the *"Needling Lumbar Pain"* section’s annotation, it reads **"pulsating artery behind the heel’s street"**; in the *"Water Orifices"* annotation, it states **"behind the inner ankle"**—these annotations differ, and the *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng* should be taken as correct.

For **fever of the *Juéyīn*** (foot *Converging Yin*), it causes lumbar pain, lower abdominal fullness, and **difficult urination resembling fever**—not **epilepsy**—with frequent urination, anxiety, and **insufficient qi**, making the abdomen **moist and resonant**.
The *Juéyīn* vessel of the foot follows the **inner thigh**, entering the **sacrum**, encircling the **genitals**, and reaching the lower abdomen. Hence, the illness manifests thus.
**Cì** refers to **inability to urinate**.
**Yìyì** describes **blocked flow**.
**Newly corrected text states:** According to the *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng*, the three characters **"frequent urination, anxiety"** are recorded as **"frequent sighing."**

Needle the foot *Juéyīn*. **Tàichōng** governs it, lying in the depression two *cùn* behind the base of the big toe, the *Juéyīn* **yuan-source** point. Needling may penetrate to three *cùn*, retaining the needle for ten breaths. If moxibustion is applied, three *zhàng* may be used.
**Newly corrected text states:** According to the *"Needling Lumbar Pain"* annotation, it reads: **"In the depression behind the joint, pressing the artery."**

For **lung fever**, it makes one feel **heart-chilled**—
with severe chills followed by heat, and when heat arrives, one is prone to **startling**, as if seeing something.
Needle the **hand *Tàiyīn* and *Yángmíng***.
**Fēngquē** governs it.
**Lièquē** lies one and a half *cùn* behind the wrist, a *Tàiyīn* network point. Needling may penetrate to three *cùn*, retaining the needle for three breaths. If moxibustion is applied, five *zhàng* may be used.
The *Yángmíng* point: **Hégǔ** governs it.
**Hégǔ** lies at the junction of the second finger (next to the thumb) on the hand, where the *Yángmíng* vessel passes. Needling may penetrate to three *cùn*, retaining the needle for six breaths. If moxibustion is applied, three *zhàng* may be used.

For **heart fever**, it causes **severe mental agitation**, a desire for cold water, with **predominant chills** and **little heat**.
Needle the **hand *Shàoyīn***.
**Shénmén** governs it.
**Shénmén** lies in the depression at the end of the **sharp bone** on the palm’s posterior, the *Shàoyīn* **yuan-source** point. Needling may penetrate to three *cùn*, retaining the needle for seven breaths. If moxibustion is applied, three *zhàng* may be used.
**Newly corrected text states:** According to the *Tàisū*, it reads: **"Desire for cold water and predominant chills, with little heat and severe heat."**

**Liver ague** causes the patient to appear ashen-gray, sighing deeply, with a lifeless appearance. Needle the *foot Juéyīn* until blood appears.
**Zhōngfēng** governs it.
**Zhōngfēng** lies one and a half *cùn* above the medial malleolus, in the depression when the foot is dorsiflexed. It belongs to the *foot Juéyīn* channel. Needling should draw blood; habitual needling may penetrate four *fēn* of the *tóngshēncùn*, retaining the needle for seven breaths. If moxibustion is applied, three *zhàng* may be used.

**Spleen ague** causes chills, abdominal pain, and when heat arises, rumbling in the intestines, followed by sweating after the rumbling ceases. Needle the *foot Tàiyīn*.
**Shāngqiū** governs it.
**Shāngqiū** lies just below and slightly anterior to the medial malleolus, in the depression, belonging to the *foot Tàiyīn* channel. Needling may penetrate three *fēn* of the *tóngshēncùn*, retaining the needle for seven breaths. If moxibustion is applied, three *zhàng* may be used.

**Kidney ague** causes the patient to tremble, with lumbar and spinal pain, difficulty turning, constipation, a tight chest, and cold hands and feet. Needle the *foot Tàiyáng-Shàoyīn*.
**Tàizhōng** governs it.
Locate it as in the method for *foot Shàoyīn* ague.

**Stomach ague** initially presents as a carbuncle (*jū*), with voracious hunger yet inability to eat, and distension of the abdomen after eating—due to **stomach heat and spleen vacuity**, hence the voracious hunger yet inability to eat, and postprandial abdominal distension.
**Newly corrected text states:** According to the *Tàisū*, it reads: **"Initially presents as a carbuncle."**
Needle the transverse vessels of the *foot Yángmíng-Tàiyīn* to draw blood. **Lìduì, Jiěxī, and Sānlǐ** govern it.
**Lìduì** lies at the tip of the second toe, adjacent to the nail like a scallion leaf—*Yángmíng*’s **well** point. Needling may penetrate one *fēn* of the *tóngshēncùn*, retaining the needle for one breath. If moxibustion is applied, one *zhàng* may be used.
**Jiěxī** lies three and a half *cùn* above *Chōngyáng*, in the depression on the wrist—*Yángmíng* channel. Needling may penetrate five *fēn* of the *tóngshēncùn*, retaining the needle for five breaths. If moxibustion is applied, three *zhàng* may be used.
**Sānlǐ** lies three *cùn* below the knee, between the two tendons beside the *fù* bone—*Yángmíng*’s **convergence** point. Needling may penetrate one *cùn* of the *tóngshēncùn*, retaining the needle for seven breaths. If moxibustion is applied, three *zhàng* may be used.
However, for the *foot Yángmíng*, these three points are used, and the *foot Tàiyīn* transverse vessels are needled to draw blood.
The **transverse vessels** refer to the oblique vessels crossing the large pulse anterior to the medial malleolus—*Tàiyīn*’s channel vessels.
**Newly corrected text states:** *Jiěxī* is detailed as three and a half *cùn* behind *Chōngyáng*. According to the *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng*, it is one and a half *cùn*; the *Qì Xuélùn* annotation states two and a half *cùn*.

When ague heat arises, needle the **pulsating vessel on the dorsum of the foot**—*Yángmíng*’s vessel. Open the space and let blood flow; the patient will immediately feel cold. *Yángmíng*’s vessel is rich in blood and *qi*; with excessive heat and robust *qi*, letting blood will immediately induce cold.

When ague is about to turn cold, needle the *hand Yángmíng-Tàiyīn* and *foot Yángmíng-Tàiyīn*—that is, open the points and let blood flow, following the **well** and **convergence** points.

If the ague pulse is **full, large, and tense**, needle the **back shu** points using a **midline needle**, one on each side of the **five *Zhù* shu** points, adjusting for fatness or thinness to draw blood. The **back shu** refers to *Dàzhú*; the **five *Zhù* shu** refers to *Huìxī* (pronounced *Huìxí*).
If the ague pulse is **small, firm, and tense**, moxibustion is applied to the *Jīng-Shàoyīn* channel, and the **finger well** is needled.
Moxibustion on the *Jīng-Shàoyīn* channel refers to **Fùliú**. *Fùliú* lies two *cùn* above the medial malleolus, in the depression—*foot Shàoyīn* channel. Needling may penetrate three *fēn* of the *tóngshēncùn*, retaining the needle for three breaths. If moxibustion is applied, five *zhàng* may be used.
Needling the **finger well** refers to needling **Zhìyīn**. *Zhìyīn* lies on the lateral side of the little toe, adjacent to the nail like a scallion leaf—*foot Tàiyáng*’s **well** point. Needling may penetrate one *fēn* of the *tóngshēncùn*, retaining the needle for five breaths. If moxibustion is applied, three *zhàng* may be used.

If the ague pulse is **full, large, and tense**, needle the **back shu** points using **five *Zhù* shu** and **back shu**, one each, adjusting for fatness or thinness, following the *Sānbèi Fǎ* to reach the blood vessels. The **back shu** refers to *Dàzhú*; the **five *Zhù* shu** refers to *Huìxī* governing it.
**Newly corrected text states:** From *"If the ague pulse is full, large, and tense"* to the end of this annotation, the text and annotation total fifty-five characters, which should be omitted. The passage duplicates the preceding text; Wang’s annotations merely follow without additional meaning, unlike Shì’ān’s precision, so it is not repeated.

If the ague pulse is **slow, large, and vacuous**, medicinal treatment is appropriate; needling is contraindicated. A slow pulse indicates **windstroke**; a large pulse indicates **real *qi***; a vacuous pulse indicates **blood vacuity**. With blood vacuity and real *qi*, and wind further assaulting, medicinal treatment is preferred to expel the pathogen; needling to let blood is inappropriate.

In treating ague, needle **only when the attack begins**, as if after a meal’s duration—delaying beyond this misses the optimal timing. At the onset, **true and false *qi*** reside separately, and pathogenic waves have not yet surged, making treatment possible. If delayed, true and false *qi* merge, and needling may instead injure the true *qi*, hence the saying *"missing the timing."*

**Newly corrected text states:** From *"If the ague pulse is slow, large, and vacuous"* to here, the entire passage originally appeared in Volume Four of Yuánqǐ’s text, later appended by Wang.

For agues where the pulse is **not apparent**, needle the **webbed spaces between all ten fingers** to draw blood; the patient will recover once blood is released. First, locate and remove all **erythematous spots** like small mung beans on the body.

For the **twelve types of ague**, their onsets occur at different times. Observe the patient’s symptoms to determine which channel’s pulse is affected. Follow the **symptoms and signs** to identify the diseased pulse. Needle **at the onset**, as if after a meal’s duration: one needling weakens it, two needlings resolve it, and three needlings cure it.

If the ague does not cease, needle the **two pulses beneath the tongue** (*Lianquan*) to draw blood; the method is detailed below.

If the ague persists, needle the **abundant meridians at the armpit** (*Weizhong*—i.e., **Weizhong**, *Dazhu*, *Fengmen*, and *Refu* acupoints) to draw blood, or needle the **region below the nape and beside the spine** (*Dazhu*, *Fengmen*, *Refu*), which will surely cease it. These are all the **pulse-qi of the Foot Taiyang Channel**.

**Weizhong** (*Dazhu*) is located below the first cervical vertebra on both sides, each at a distance of **one to one-and-a-half body-inches** (*tóngshēncùn*), within the depression. Needling can penetrate **three body-inches’ worth**, leaving the needle for seven breaths; if moxibustion is applied, **five moxa cones** (*wǔzhuàng*) may be used. **Fengmen and Refu** are found below the second cervical vertebra (*#6—i.e., the second cervical vertebra, *C2*), each at a distance of **one to one-and-a-half body-inches**, with needling penetrating **five body-inches’ worth**, leaving for seven breaths; if moxibustion is applied, **five moxa cones** may be used.

*Note:* The newly corrected text states: Regarding *Dazhu* moxibustion, the *Jiayi Jing* records **seven moxa cones**, while the *Qixue Lun* annotation also records **seven moxa cones**; however, the *Cihuo Lun* and *Rexue* annotations both record **five moxa cones**.

The **two pulses beneath the tongue** are **Lianquan**, an acupoint. Located at the **chin, beneath the tongue’s root, and above the hyoid bone**, it is the **convergence of Yinwei and Renmai**. Needling can penetrate **three body-inches’ worth**, leaving for three breaths; if moxibustion is applied, **three moxa cones** may be used.

When needling agues, first inquire about where the patient’s symptoms first appeared. Needle that region first.

If **headaches** or **heaviness** are the initial symptoms, needle the **top of the head** and the **spaces between the eyebrows and temples** to draw blood. The **top of the head** refers to **Shangxing and Baihui**; the **spaces between the eyebrows** refer to **Xuánlú**; the **spaces between the temples** refer to acupoints like **Zhuánzhú**.

If **neck or back pain** is the initial symptom, needle those regions first. The **neck** is governed by **Fengchi and Fengfu**; the **back** by **Dazhu and Shendao**.

If **lumbar or spinal pain** is the initial symptom, needle **Weizhong** to draw blood.

If **arm pain** is the initial symptom, needle the **ten fingers of the Hand Shaoyin and Yangming Channels**. *Note:* The newly corrected text states: According to another version, it is the **Hand Yin and Yang Channels**; the original text also reads **Hand Yin and Yang**.

If **acidic or painful sensations along the limbs** are the initial symptoms, needle the **ten fingers of the Foot Yangming Channel** to draw blood. Each method corresponds to the **path of the pathogenic factor** (*xiéjū*) and should be adjusted accordingly.

For **wind-induced ague**, when the ague occurs, the patient **sweats and dislikes wind**; needle the **blood vessels of the three Yang channels’ back-shu points**. *Note:* The *Jiayi Jing* states **Foot Three Yang**.

If **abdominal pain is severe**, pressing it causes no resistance, and the condition is called **"drilling marrow disease"** (*bìsuǐ bìng*), then use a **sharp needle** to pierce the **absolute bone** (*juéshǔ*—i.e., **Yangfu** acupoint) and draw blood; the patient will recover immediately. The method is similar to the **moxibustion technique for Zhongfu and Shendao** described in the *Qixue Lun*.

**Zhǒu** (*Zhou*—pronounced as *hóngfù* in phonetic annotation) and **镜** (*Jìng*—pronounced as *chúxián* in phonetic annotation) refer to **elbow and shoulder pain**. For **generalized body pain**, needle **Zhiyin**.

*Note:* The newly corrected text states: The *Jiayi Jing* does not include the term **"Zhiyin"**.

For all **Yin Channel well points** (*jǐng*), there is no bloodletting; one needling is sufficient. The **well points** are all located at the **tips of the fingers**; the **well point of the Foot Shaoyin Channel** is at the **center of the sole**.

If the ague **does not cause thirst** but occurs **every other day**, needle the **Foot Taiyang Channel**. *Note:* The newly corrected text states: The *Jiǔjuàn* records **Foot Yangming**; the *Taosū* agrees.

If the ague **causes thirst** and occurs **every other day**, needle the **Foot Shaoyang Channel**. *Note:* The newly corrected text states: The *Jiǔjuàn* records **Hand Shaoyang**; the *Taosū* agrees.

For **warm ague**, where **no sweat is produced**, apply **fifty-nine needlings**. From **stomach-induced ague** onward, refer to the *Huángdì Zhōngzhì Tújīng* for its governing principles; discrepancies may reflect ancient variations in technique.

**Qi Jue Theory** (*Qìjué Lùn*)

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How do the five Zang organs and six Fu organs transmit cold and heat to one another?"*

**Qíbó** replied: *"The kidney transmits cold to the liver, causing **flaccid paralysis** (*tānzhǒng*) and **swelling**, with **shortness of breath** (*shǎoqì*). The liver stores blood, but when cold enters, the **Yang-qi** fails to disperse. If the Yang-qi does not disperse, blood stagnates and the **pulse-qi becomes sluggish** (*qìsè*), hence the **flaccid paralysis** and **shortness of breath**."

*Note:* The newly corrected text states: According to the original *Yuánqǐ* text, it reads: *"The kidney transmits cold to the spleen."* Yuanqi’s annotation states: *"The kidney is injured by cold and transmitted to the spleen; the spleen governs flesh, and cold in the flesh congeals into firmness, which then transforms into pus, hence the **flaccid paralysis** (*tān*)."* Blood is injured and **pulse-qi is deficient**, hence the **shortness of breath**." The *Jiayi Jing* also reads *"transmits cold to the spleen,"* but Wang mistakenly altered the original text, interpreting it as *"liver,"*—another error by a learned scholar.

*"The spleen transmits cold to the liver, causing **flaccid paralysis**, **swelling**, and **tendon spasm** (*jīnluán*). The spleen governs and stores flesh, while the liver governs tendons; warm flesh relaxes tendons, but cold flesh tightens them, hence the **tendon spasm**." Cold flesh congeals the **Wei-qi**, causing **flaccid paralysis** and **swelling**.

*"The liver transmits cold to the heart, causing **madness** (*kuáng*) and **blocked midriff** (*gé sè zhōng*). The heart is a **Yang Zang organ**, with the spirit dwelling within; if cold invades it, the spirit becomes disordered, hence the **madness**. The Yang-qi is obstructed by cold, hence the **blocked midriff** and **impaired central passage** (*zhōng bùtōng*)."

*"The heart transmits cold to the lung, causing **lung consumption** (*fèi xiāo*). For lung consumption, when the patient drinks, the liquid **sinks immediately** (*yīn yī wù èr*), and death is inevitable. The heart is a Yang Zang organ, and if it **inversely receives cold**, the cold-qi cannot be dissipated, then transmitted to the lung. Cold follows the heart’s fire inward, **melting the metal essence** (*jīn jīng*), and the metal is harmed by the fire’s pathogenic factor, hence the **lung consumption**." Yet the lung stores and **consumes/melts** (*xiāo shuò*), and if its **pulse-qi has no foundation**, then drinking causes **immediate sinking** (*yīn yī*) and **double waves** (*bō èr*). Metal and fire **mutually harm** (*xiāng zé*), hence death cannot be treated.

*"The lung transmits cold to the kidney, causing **rushing water** (*yǒngshuǐ*). For rushing water, pressing the abdomen causes no firmness; **water-qi invades the large intestine**, and when the patient moves, the **intestines rumble** (*wū*), producing a **splashing sound** (*zhuózhuó*), as if a **pouch wrapped in liquid** (*nángguǒ jiāng*). This is the **disease of water**." The lung stores **pulse-qi**, while the kidney governs water; if lung cold enters the kidney, the kidney’s **pulse-qi is excessive** (*yǒuyú*), and the **excessive pulse-qi rushes upward to the lung**, hence the term **"rushing water"**. The large intestine is the **Fu organ of the lung**, but since both the lung and kidney are **afflicted by cold**, neither can transmit it properly, so the **water-qi invades the large intestine**. The kidney, **receiving congealed cold**, cannot **transform fluids**; the large intestine **accumulates water** and fails to **drain properly**, hence when the patient moves, the **intestines rumble** and produce a **splashing sound**, as if a **pouch wrapped in liquid**, manifesting as the **disease of water**.

「○The newly corrected text states: According to the *Jiā-Yǐ Jīng* (甲乙经), **"disease of water"** is treated as a matter of the lung. When the spleen transmits heat to the liver, it results in *jīngniǔ* (惊钮). The liver stores blood and also governs shock; thus, when heat afflicts the liver, shock occurs and blood issues from the nose. If the liver transmits heat to the heart, death ensues. The two Yang organs (heart and liver) harmonize, and fire (heart) and wood (liver) mutually consume each other#8; hence, when liver heat enters the heart, death is certain. The *Yīn-Yáng Biélùn* (阴阳别论) says: The "heart of the liver" is called *shēngyáng* (生阳), and those afflicted by *shēngyáng* perish within four days.

○The newly corrected text states: According to the meaning of the *Yīn-Yáng Biélùn* (阴阳别论), this differs from the passage above. The Wang school incorrectly cites that flawed text to support this interpretation. When the heart transmits heat to the lung, it becomes *lìxiāo* (鬲消). The heart and lung are paired organs, separated by the oblique *lì* (鬲) membrane, which connects downward to the horizontal *lì* (鬲) membrane; thus, when heart heat enters the lung, prolonged transmission and transformation result in *lì* (鬲) heat and *xiāo* (消渴), causing excessive thirst.

When the lung transmits heat to the kidney, it becomes *róuzhìng* (柔痊). *Róu* (柔) refers to weak tendons, while *zhìng* (痉) refers to rigid bones that do not comply. When both *qi* (气) and bones are heated, marrow fails to nourish internally, causing bones to become rigid and strong yet unable to move, while tendons grow weak and slack, lacking strength. *Zhìng* (痉) is pronounced *zhí* (职).

When the kidney transmits heat to the spleen, it becomes *xū* (虚), and *chángbì* (肠僻) leads to death, rendering it incurable. The spleen, representing earth, normally restrains water, but when the kidney instead transmits heat to it, the spleen’s earth nature cannot control water, resulting in prolonged depletion (*xū* 损). Those with *chángbì* (肠僻) death have their kidney’s *jīngqì* (精气) internally consumed; the lower burner lacks governance to sustain it, so *chángbì* (肠僻) is eliminated and *qì* (气) cannot be restrained.

When the *bāo* (胞) transmits heat to the bladder, it causes *zhèngniào xuèyǔ* (症溺血). The bladder is the repository of body fluids, while the *bāo* (胞) oversees their reception; thus, when heat enters the bladder, the *bāo* (胞) is internally heated, causing the yin vessels to overflow, resulting in inability to urinate and blood in the urine. The *Zhènglǐ Shū* (正理论) states: Heat in the lower burner causes blood in the urine. This is what is meant.

When the bladder transmits heat to the small intestine, the *lì* (鬲) and intestines become obstructed, and the mouth develops *kūilián* (口麋). The small intestine’s pulse connects with the heart, descends the throat, passes through the diaphragm, and reaches the stomach before belonging to the small intestine; thus, when it receives heat, it obstructs the *lì* (鬲) and intestines below, while above, sores form in the mouth and *kū* (麋) appears. *Kū* (麋) means "rotting." *Lián* (斓) is pronounced *méi* (糜), with a tone of *wǔ* (武) and cut as *bēi* (悲). When the small intestine transmits heat to the large intestine, it becomes *chù* (处痴) or *chén* (沉). Once the small intestine’s heat has entered, the large intestine is affected by both heats, causing blood to overflow and resulting in *fúxuàn* (伏痕). Stagnant and uncirculated blood leads to delayed menstruation and non-flow, hence the term *fúxuàn* (伏痴) or *chén* (沉). *Chù* (处) is synonymous with *fú* (伏). *Xuàn* (痕) is mistakenly transmitted as *shuài* (疝).

When the large intestine transmits heat to the stomach, the patient eats voraciously yet grows emaciated, termed *shíyì* (食亦). The stomach is the "sea of water and grain," its *qi* nourishing muscles externally; heat consumes water and grain while also melting muscles, causing voracious eating yet emaciation. *Shíyì* (食亦) refers to food entering and being easily expelled, failing to nourish flesh and skin. *Yì* (亦) means "easily." ○The newly corrected text states: According to the *Jiā-Yǐ Jīng* (甲乙经), *入* (入) is written as *又* (yòu). The Wang school’s annotation reads: "Voracious eating yet emaciation." This lacks meaning and is not as coherent as the *Jiā-Yǐ Jīng* (甲乙经) version, which should be read in conjunction with the following text. When the stomach transmits heat to the gallbladder, it is also termed *shíyì* (食亦). The meaning is the same as above.

When the gallbladder transmits heat to the brain, it results in *sīnlèi níbì* (辛类鼻渊). *Níbì* (鼻渊) refers to incessant discharge of turbid mucus. When brain fluids seep downward, they form turbid mucus, which flows continuously like a water spring, hence the term *níbì* (鼻渊). *Bì* (渊) means "nasal obstruction." The *Zú-Tàiyáng* (足太阳) pulse originates at the inner canthus, ascends the forehead, and converges at the vertex before entering the brain. The *Zú-Yángmíng* (足阳明) pulse originates at the nose, converges at the *bì* (频) point, and runs beside the *Tàiyáng* (太阳) pulse. When the brain is heated, the *Zú-Tàiyáng* (足太阳) pulse reverses, and both *Zú-Tàiyáng* (足太阳) and *Zú-Yángmíng* (足阳明) pulses become excessive, afflicting the *lèi* (类) region, causing nasal pain (*sīn* 辛). Hence, the following text states: It transmits as *niǔliè míngmù* (钮瓖暝目). *Sīn* (辛) means "acidic#10/painful."」

When the *Zú-Yángmíng* pulse converges at the *bì* (频) point and runs beside the *Tàiyáng* (太阳) pulse, if the ears become excessively heated, the yang collaterals overflow, and the yang collaterals overflowing cause *niǔ* (钮) to discharge blood in sweat. *Qì* (戚), here meaning "blood in sweat."

When the blood discharge is severe, the *Yángmíng* and *Tàiyáng* pulses weaken, failing to nourish the eyes, hence the ears become *míng* (暝). *Míng* means "darkened." *Dié* (蝶) is pronounced *mò jié qiè*.

Thus, this condition arises from *qìjué* (气厥). *Jué* (厥) means "inversion of *qi*." All such cases stem from *qi* inversion.

**Chapter on Coughing (Kě Lùn Piān)**

The Yellow Emperor asked: "Why does the lung cause coughing in people?"
Qìbó replied: "All five *zàng* organs and six *fǔ* viscera can cause coughing—it is not unique to the lung."

The Emperor said: "I wish to hear their manifestations."
Qìbó said: "The skin and fur are the lung’s *hé* (合) counterpart. They first receive pathogenic *qi*, and the pathogenic *qi* follows its natural pathways. By 'pathogenic,' I mean cold *qi*.

When cold and improper foods enter the stomach, they ascend via the lung’s vessels to the lung itself, causing lung cold. When the lung is cold, both external and internal *qi* converge with the pathogen, and if the pathogen lodges there, it results in lung coughing.

The lung’s vessels originate in the middle *jiāo* (焦), descend to connect with the large intestine, then return along the stomach’s orifice, ascending to the *lì* (鬲) and attaching to the lung. Hence, it is said that the pathogen ascends via the lung’s vessels to the lung.

Each of the five *zàng* organs contracts disease according to its designated season. If not in its season, the pathogen transmits sequentially to the next. By 'season,' I mean the *wángyuè* (王月, sovereign month). If not in the sovereign month, the pathogen does not lodge directly, hence it transmits sequentially.

Since humans align with Heaven and Earth, the five *zàng* organs each govern their respective seasons. When exposed to cold, they contract disease: mild cases manifest as coughing, severe cases as diarrhea or pain.

Mild cold *qi* affects the skin and fur externally while penetrating the lung internally, thus causing coughing. Severe cold *qi* invades internally, rupturing tissues and causing pain, or entering the intestines and stomach, resulting in diarrhea.

If encountered in autumn, the lung first receives the pathogen; in spring, the liver; in summer, the heart; in the *zhìyīn* (至阴) season, the spleen; in winter, the kidney. This is because the pathogen aligns with the organ’s season of dominance.

*Note: The annotation "新校正云" and its following text are excluded as they appear to be editorial commentary rather than core text.*

Qi (氣) of the lung manifests as coughing with wheezing and sonorous breath—when severe, it results in hemoptysis. The lung stores *qi* and governs respiration, so when coughing occurs, the *qi* is obstructed, producing wheezing and a hoarse sound in the throat. In extreme cases, the lung’s vessels are disrupted, leading to blood in the sputum.

When the heart is affected, coughing is accompanied by chest pain, and the throat feels constricted as if blocked by a foreign object—when severe, the throat swells and the voice becomes hoarse. The **Pericardium’s** *mai* (脉) originates in the chest, emerging to connect with the heart’s *xiàng* (包). The **Minor Yin** *mai* (少阴之脉) arises from the heart, ascending to bind with the heart’s *xì* (系); its branches diverge upward alongside the throat, thus producing such symptoms.

When the liver is affected, coughing causes pain beneath both ribs—when severe, the patient cannot turn, and turning worsens the distension in the lower flanks. The **Liver’s** *mai* (足厥阴脉) ascends through the *jì* (鬲), spreads across the brain and ribs, and follows the posterior throat. Hence, such symptoms arise. *Nòu* (朕) is also the rib.

When the spleen is affected, coughing causes pain beneath the right *kāng* (胱), with a dragging sensation extending to the shoulders and back—when severe, the patient cannot move, and movement exacerbates the coughing. The **Spleen’s** *mai* (足太阴脉) ascends through the *jì* (鬲) alongside the throat; its branches further diverge from the stomach, ascending through the *jì* (鬲). Thus, the illness manifests as such. The spleen’s *qi* is linked to the lung, so pain radiates to the shoulders and back. The spleen governs the right side, hence the deep, slow, and lingering pain beneath the right *kāng* (胱). *Jù* (劇) sounds like *jí* (极).

When the kidney is affected, coughing causes pain radiating between the waist and back—when severe, it results in expectoration of saliva. The **Kidney’s** *mai* (足少阴脉) ascends along the inner posterior thigh, penetrates the spine, and connects with the kidney’s vessels to the bladder. Its direct path rises from the kidney, passing through the liver’s *jì* (鬲) and entering the lung, following the throat and alongside the root of the tongue. Additionally, the **Bladder’s** *mai* (膀胱脉) diverges from the shoulder’s inner region, descends alongside the spine, and reaches the waist, then enters and binds with the kidney. Hence, the illness manifests as such.

The Emperor asked: How does coughing affect the **Six Fu** (六府)? Where does the disease lodge?

Qi Bo replied: Prolonged coughing from the **Five Zàng** (五藏) eventually spreads to the **Six Fu** (六府). If spleen coughing persists, the stomach is affected. The symptoms of stomach coughing are coughing and vomiting—when severe, it causes the emergence of *huáng* (蛔, roundworms). The spleen and stomach are paired. The stomach’s *mai* (脉) follows the throat, descending into the *quēpén* (缺盆), passing through the *jì* (鬲), and connecting with the stomach while binding to the spleen. Thus, when spleen coughing persists, the stomach is affected, and its *mai* (脉) follows the throat into the *quēpén* (缺盆). If the stomach is cold, vomiting occurs. When vomiting is severe, the intestinal *qi* rises in rebellion, causing the *huáng* (蛔) to emerge. *Huáng* (蛔) sounds like *huí* (回).

If liver coughing persists, the gallbladder is affected. The symptoms of gallbladder coughing are coughing and vomiting of bitter bile. The liver and gallbladder are paired. The gallbladder’s *mai* (脉) descends from the *quēpén* (缺盆) beneath the chest, passing through the *jì* (鬲) and binding with the liver. Thus, when liver coughing persists, the gallbladder is affected. The gallbladder’s *qi* tends to rebel, so bitter bile is vomited.

If lung coughing persists, the large intestine is affected. The symptoms of large intestine coughing are coughing and incontinence. The lung and large intestine are paired. The large intestine’s *mai* (脉) enters the *quēpén* (缺盆) and binds with the lung. Thus, when lung coughing persists, the large intestine is affected. The large intestine serves as the passage for waste, so when cold invades, its *qi* cannot restrain itself.

If heart coughing persists, the small intestine is affected. The symptoms of small intestine coughing are coughing and loss of breath, with breath and coughing failing simultaneously. The heart and small intestine are paired. The small intestine’s *mai* (脉) enters the *quēpén* (缺盆) and binds with the heart. Thus, when heart coughing persists, the small intestine is affected. When the small intestine’s cold is severe, its *qi* descends into the large intestine. Coughing causes the small intestine’s *qi* to rush downward, resulting in breathlessness.

If kidney coughing persists, the bladder is affected. The symptoms of bladder coughing are coughing and urinary incontinence. The kidney and bladder are paired. The bladder’s *mai* (脉) diverges from the shoulder’s inner region, descends alongside the spine, reaches the waist, and enters, binding with the kidney and connecting to the bladder. Hence, when kidney coughing persists, the bladder is affected. The bladder stores bodily fluids, so urinary incontinence occurs.

If coughing persists endlessly, the **San Jiao** (三焦) is affected. The symptoms of San Jiao coughing are coughing, abdominal distension, and loss of appetite for food and drink. These are all due to the *qi* gathering in the stomach and being obstructed in the lung, causing excessive phlegm and sputum, facial swelling, and rebellious *qi*. The San Jiao refers not to the **Hand Minor Yang** (手少阳), but to the **Upper** and **Middle Jiao** (上焦、中焦). Why? The Upper Jiao originates above the stomach’s mouth, ascending alongside the throat, passing through the *jì* (鬲), and spreading across the chest to the armpit. The Middle Jiao also reaches the stomach’s mouth, emerging after the Upper Jiao. The *qi* received here separates waste, steams bodily fluids, and refines their essence, which ascends into the lung’s vessels, transforming into blood. Thus, it is said that all *qi* gathers in the stomach and is obstructed in the lung. When both Jiaos are diseased, the pathogenic *qi* accumulates in the lung, filling its *qi*, causing excessive phlegm and sputum, facial swelling, and rebellious *qi*. Abdominal distension and loss of appetite arise from stomach cold. The stomach’s *mai* (脉) descends from the *quēpén* (缺盆) beneath the breast’s inner region, following the abdomen to the *qìjiē* (气街); its branches further descend from the stomach’s mouth, circling the abdomen to the *qìjiē* (气街) and merging. Now, since the stomach has received the pathogen, the illness manifests as such. Why is it said that this does not refer to the Lower Jiao? The Lower Jiao diverges from the *huíxiàng* (回肠), draining into the bladder. Therefore, water and grain are always retained in the stomach, where waste accumulates before descending into the large intestine. Separated fluid follows the Lower Jiao and seeps into the bladder. This path is distant from the stomach’s mouth, so it is not referred to here.

The Emperor asked: How should it be treated? Qi Bo replied: To treat the **Zàng** (藏), one must address their **shù** (俞).

To treat the **Fǔ** (府), one must address their **hé** (合);
To treat **fúyǒng** (浮肿), one must address their **jīng** (经).

All **Zàng** (藏) **shù** (俞) points are the third acupuncture points where the **mài** (脉) originate.
All **Fǔ** (府) **hé** (合) points are the sixth acupuncture points where the **mài** (脉) originate.
The **jīng** (经) points are the fourth acupuncture points where the **Zàng** (藏) **mài** (脉) originate, and the fifth acupuncture points where the **Fǔ** (府) **mài** (脉) originate.

The *Língshū Jīng* (灵枢经) states:
"The points where the **mài** (脉) converge are called **shù** (俞),
The paths where the **mài** (脉) travel are called **jīng** (经),
The points where the **mài** (脉) enter are called **hé** (合)."
This is what is meant.

The Emperor said: Well spoken.

**Chapter on Sudden Pain**

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"I have heard that those who speak well of the Dao of Heaven must have verifications in humanity;
those who speak well of antiquity must align with the present;
those who speak well of humanity must reflect upon oneself.
Thus, the Way becomes unerring, and its essential principles are fully grasped—this is what is called profound clarity.

To speak well of Heaven means to discuss the four seasons’ **qi**—warmth, coolness, cold, and heat—
and how birth, growth, contraction, and storage manifest in the human form and **qi**, in the five **zàng** organs’ reciprocal responses.
This can be verified and demonstrated as good or evil, hence it is said: ‘It must have verification in humanity.’

To speak well of antiquity means to discuss the accounts of ancient sages on nurturing life and moderation,
and how these principles harmonize with today’s practices of nurturing life and moderation,
so that success and failure may be discussed in alignment—hence it is said: ‘It must align with the present.’

To speak well of humanity means to discuss the form, bones, and joints that mutually support one another,
the tendons and **mài** (脉) binding and interlacing, the skin and flesh enveloping,
while the five **zàng** organs and six **fǔ** (府) reside in order within.
They rely on the seven spirits and five **zàng** organs to function—
when **qi** is exhausted and spirit departs, death ensues.
Thus, one knows that this fleeting form cannot endure,
and through still contemplation of oneself, one recognizes the same fate—
hence it is said: ‘It must reflect upon oneself.’

Such understanding grasps the ultimate principles of the Dao without doubt,
penetrates the deepest truths, and thus achieves clarity.

Now, I question you, Master—
may your words be clear enough to comprehend,
your demonstrations visible to the eye,
your explanations tangible to the touch?
May they verify themselves in me, dispelling ignorance and resolving confusion,
so that all may be heard distinctly?

‘Words’ here mean to open the ears of the unenlightened,
to clarify the minds of the perplexed,
so that each principle is ordered—
visible to the eye, traceable by hand, and verifiable in practice.
‘Examine’ (*fàn*) is akin to ‘trace’ (*xún*)."*

Qībó bowed twice, prostrating himself in response:
*"What aspect of the Dao do you inquire about?
Allow me to elucidate its beginning."*

The Emperor said:
*"I wish to hear why sudden pain arises in the five **zàng** organs."*

Qībó replied:
*"The **jīngmài** (经脉) flow ceaselessly in cycles without pause.
When cold **qi** enters the **mài**, it stagnates, causing a choked, inaudible voice and obstructed flow.
If it lodges outside the **mài**, the blood diminishes;
if it lodges within the **mài**, the **qi** cannot circulate—
thus, sudden pain arises."*

The Emperor asked:
*"Why does pain sometimes cease abruptly,
or persist intensely without relief,
or become unbearable even to touch,
or subside upon pressure,
or remain unaffected by pressure,
or correspond to breathing with palpable tension,
or draw the heart and back together in pain,
or draw the ribs and lower abdomen in pain,
or drag from the abdomen to the inner thigh,
or endure for days, forming a mass,
or strike suddenly, causing death—unresponsive, then reviving after questioning,
or cause pain with vomiting,
or follow abdominal pain with diarrhea,
or induce pain with constipation?
All these pains differ in form—how may they be distinguished?"*

Qībó said:
*"When cold **qi** lodges outside the **mài**, the **mài** grows cold,
and cold contracts the **mài**, causing it to tighten.
Tightening strains the **mài**, pulling on the finer collateral vessels—
thus, sudden pain arises.
When **gèn** (艮, the north) **qi** arrives, the pain ceases immediately.

The **mài** encircle left and right—
when cold strikes, they contract and tighten,
and tightening obstructs the **wèiqì** (卫气), preventing its flow.
Thus, it draws outward to the finer collateral **mài**.
When **wèiqì** cannot enter, cold presses inward,
the **mài** tightens without relaxation—
hence, pain emerges.
When warmth arrives, **wèiqì** resumes its course,
cold **qi** retreats—
thus, the pain ceases.
*‘Hào’* (昊) means ‘heat’;
*‘zhǐ’* (止) means ‘ceased.’

If cold repeatedly assails the body, the pain endures.
Prolonged cold is difficult to dispel—
thus, the pain persists without resolution.

When cold **qi** lodges within the **jīngmài** and clashes with **gèn** **qi**,
the **mài** becomes distended—
distension causes pain that cannot be pressed upon.
If pressing worsens the pain, the reasoning follows below.

When cold **qi** lingers and **gèn** **qi** descends from above,
the **mài** swells and the blood and **qi**乱 (*luàn*—disorder),
thus the pain is severe and cannot be pressed.
The **mài** already distended and swollen—
when pressed, the pathogenic **qi** assaults inward—
hence, it cannot be pressed.

When cold **qi** lodges between the intestines and stomach,
beneath the *mó* (膜, diaphragm-like membrane) and *yuán* (原, origin),
the blood cannot disperse, and the finer collaterals tighten—
thus, pain arises.
When pressed, the blood and **qi** disperse—
hence, pressing alleviates the pain.

*‘Mó’* refers to the membrane between the diaphragm;
*‘yuán’* refers to the origin of the *gèhuāng* (鬲肓, lower abdomen)."

The blood cannot disperse—this refers to the finer collaterals within the *gèhuāng* membrane, where the blood is confined. When these collaterals are full, they tighten, thus pulling and generating pain. Pressing with the hand disperses the cold *qi*, relaxing the finer collaterals, and so the pain ceases.

When cold *qi* lodges in the *xiá jǐ* (侠脊, flank-spine) vessels, deep pressing cannot reach it, hence pressing is ineffective. The *xiá jǐ* vessels are the central *Dū Mài* (督脉, Governing Vessel), flanked by the *Zu Tài Yáng Mài* (足太阳脉, Foot Taiyang Vessel). The *Dū Mài* follows the spine, while the *Tài Yáng* pierces the lumbar muscles—thus deep pressing cannot reach them. If pressing is applied centrally, the spinal joints bend; if pressed on the flanks, the lumbar muscles contract. Bending and contraction alike obstruct the *wèi* *qi* (卫气, Defensive *qi*), causing cold *qi* to gather and accumulate inward—hence pressing is ineffective.

When cold *qi* lodges in the *Chōng Mài* (冲脉, Penetrating Vessel), this vessel—arising from *Guān Yuán* (关元, CV4)—ascends straight through the abdomen, the cold *qi* obstructs its flow, and the *qi* stagnates accordingly, causing panting and a palpable pulse. The *Chōng Mài* is an extraordinary vessel. *Guān Yuán* is a point located three *cùn* below the umbilicus; its ascent refers to its course upward along the abdomen, not its origin. Its true origin lies beneath the kidneys. "Ascending straight" means it converges at the throat. "The *qi* stagnates" refers to the *Zu Shǎo Yīn Mài* (足少阴脉, Foot Shaoyin Vessel) *qi* rising and accumulating due to the *Chōng Mài* obstruction. Since the *Chōng Mài* and *Shǎo Yīn* run parallel, panting and a palpable pulse result.

When cold *qi* lodges in the *Bèi Shù* (背俞, back-shu) vessels, the pulse weeps (*mài qì*—脉泣), leading to blood deficiency and pain, as these vessels connect to the heart—hence the pain radiates. Pressing introduces warm *qi*, which disperses the cold, allowing the heart’s *qi* to surface, and the pain ceases. *Bèi Shù* refers to the *Xīn Shù* (心俞, Heart Shu) vessel, also part of the *Zu Tài Yáng Mài*. Shu points all internally communicate with the *zàng* (藏, solid organs), hence their connection to the heart and radiating pain. Pressing invites warm *qi* inward, dispersing the cold and allowing the heart’s *qi* to circulate externally, thus relieving the pain.

When cold *qi* lodges in the *Jué Yīn* (厥阴) vessels, the *Jué Yīn* vessel—encircling the genitals and connecting to the liver—tightens when cold *qi* invades, causing the blood to weep and the pulse to constrict, thus generating pain radiating to the ribs and lower abdomen. The *Jué Yīn* vessel, belonging to the liver, enters the perineum, loops around the genitals, ascends to the lower abdomen, pierces the liver’s *gèhuāng*, and spreads to the ribs—hence its connection to the genitals and radiating pain to the ribs and lower abdomen. When *jué* *qi* (厥气) lodges in the inner thigh, cold *qi* ascends to the lower abdomen, with the weeping blood below drawing the pain—thus abdominal pain radiates to the inner thigh. This is also the *Jué Yīn* liver vessel’s *qi*, as its path follows the inner thigh into the perineum, encircles the genitals, and ascends to the lower abdomen.

When cold *qi* lodges between the *xiǎo cháng* (小肠) membrane and origin, within the finer blood collaterals, the blood weeps and cannot flow into the major vessels, causing *qi* and blood stagnation—thus forming a mass over time. This refers to blood congealing from cold *qi* and forming a mass.

When cold *qi* lodges in the five *zàng* (藏), *jué* *nì* (厥逆) occurs, with *yīn* *qi* (阴气) exhausted and *yáng* *qi* (阳气) not yet entering—thus sudden, agonizing death ensues, though recovery follows if the *qi* reverses. This means the *zàng* *qi*, obstructed by cold and unable to circulate, revives once the passage is restored.

When cold *qi* lodges in the intestines and stomach, *jué* *nì* drives it upward, causing pain and vomiting. If cold *qi* lingers in the intestines and stomach, *yáng* *qi* cannot descend but instead ascends—cold persists, generating pain, while the upward surge of *yáng* *qi* causes vomiting, hence pain and vomiting occur.

When cold *qi* lodges in the *xiǎo cháng* (小肠), it cannot form a mass, leading to posterior diarrhea and abdominal pain. The small intestine is the receiving and transforming organ; if full, cold pathogens cannot settle, thus failing to congeal and instead descending into the *huí cháng* (回肠, ileum)—the broad intestine, a transmitting organ where matter cannot linger—hence posterior diarrhea and pain.

When heat *qi* lingers in the small intestine, intestinal pain arises, with *zhàng* (瘴, pestilential) heat causing thirst and dry, hardened stools that cannot be expelled—thus pain and constipation occur. Heat consumes body fluids, causing hardened stools.

The Emperor said: *"This is what can be understood through speech. How then can it be seen?"*

This refers to **diagnosing by observing facial color**. Ghībó said: *"The five *zàng* (藏, viscera) and six *fǔ* (府, bowels) each have their own regions, referring to the divisions on the face. Observe the five colors: yellow and red indicate heat, and central heat manifests as yellow-red hue. White indicates cold, as *yáng* (陽, Yang) *qi* is diminished, and blood fails to nourish the surface—hence white. Green and black signify pain, for when blood congeals and weeps, the complexion turns foul, hence green-black coloring indicates pain. This is what can be seen through observation."*

The Emperor asked: *"How then can it be felt by palpation?"* (Palpation, *mō* (摸), means to probe with the hands.)

Ghībó replied: *"Examine the pulse corresponding to the primary illness. If it is firm, with blood present or the pulse sinks deeply, all can be detected by palpation."*

The Emperor said: *"Excellent."* I understand that all diseases arise from *qi*. Now, the functions of *qi*—whether empty or full, whether it flows contrary or顺, whether it moves slowly or rapidly—can all cause illness. Hence, I raise this question.

Anger causes *qi* to rise. Excessive anger leads to vomiting of blood and *fèi xiè* (瀉, diarrhea), hence *qi* ascends. Anger makes Yang *qi* rise upward, while the liver *qi* overpowers the spleen, resulting in severe cases of vomiting blood and diarrhea. How can this be verified? Anger causes the face to turn red, and extreme anger turns it ashen. The *Líng Shū Jīng* (靈樞經) states: *"If anger persists without cessation, the spirit is injured."* This clarifies that anger causes *qi* to rise upward and not descend.

Joy harmonizes *qi* and brings the spirit to ease. The *róng wèi* (榮衛, Nutritive and Defensive *qi*) flow smoothly, hence *qi* is relaxed. When the *qi* and pulse are harmonized, the spirit is at ease and unobstructed. The *róng wèi* circulate freely, hence *qi* moves gently and relaxed.

Grief tightens the heart’s vessels, lifts the lung’s *bù yè* (布葉, large leaf-like structures), and obstructs the upper *jiāo* (焦, burner), causing the *róng wèi* to fail to disperse. Heat *qi* lingers within, hence *qi* dissipates. (*Bù yè* refers to the lung’s expansive leaf-like passages.)

Fear causes the *jīng* (精, essence) to retreat, and retreat blocks the upper *jiāo*. When the upper *jiāo* is blocked, *qi* returns, and the lower *jiāo* becomes distended, hence *qi* does not flow. Fear makes Yang *jīng* retreat upward and not descend, hence the upper *jiāo* is blocked. Once the upper *jiāo* is blocked, *qi* cannot flow freely, and the lower *jiāo*’s Yin *qi* also returns and does not disperse, gathering to form distension. Yet the upper *jiāo* is firmly constrained, and the lower *jiāo*’s *qi* returns, each holding its own place, hence *qi* does not flow.

Cold causes the *lǐ* (理, channels) to close, and *qi* cannot move, hence it is contracted. (*Lǐ* refers to the pathways where *jīn yè* (津液, body fluids) seep and channels converge; *close* means tightly sealed.) *Qi* (Defensive *qi*) cannot circulate, hence the skin’s channels and seepage points are all tightly sealed while *qi* does not flow freely. Defensive *qi* contracts inward and does not disperse.

*Gèn* (艮, constraint) causes the *shèng lǐ* (勝理, surface channels) to open, the *róng wèi* to circulate freely, and profuse sweating to occur, hence *qi* is dissipated. When a person is in the Yang (exterior), they expand; when in the Yin (interior), they constrict. Thus, heat opens the surface channels, allows the *róng wèi* to circulate freely, and causes *jīn yè* to seep outward, resulting in profuse sweating.

Startlement causes the heart to have no support, the spirit no resting place, and thoughts no stability, hence *qi* becomes disordered. *Qi* races wildly, hence it is not regulated.

Exertion causes panting and sweating, with *qi* rushing both externally and internally, hence it is depleted. Fatigue from labor makes *qi* race swiftly, hence panting occurs. When *qi* races swiftly, Yang *qi* disperses outward, hence sweating occurs. Yet panting and sweating mean that internally and externally, *qi* exceeds its normal pathways, hence it is depleted and exhausted.

Overthinking causes the heart to fixate on something, the spirit to settle there, and correct *qi* to linger and not flow, hence *qi* becomes stagnant. The heart is preoccupied and does not disperse, hence *qi* also stops.

In the *Fù Zhōng Lùn Piān* (腹中論篇), the Emperor asked: *"There is a disease where the heart and abdomen are full, and if one meal is eaten, the evening meal cannot be taken—what is this illness?"*

Ghībó replied: *"It is called *gǔ zhàng* (鼓胀, abdominal distension)."* (The heart and abdomen are distended and full, unable to take more, resembling the appearance of *gǔ zhàng*, hence the name.)

The Emperor asked: *"How should it be treated?"*

Ghībó replied: *"Treat it with *yīng yǐ lǐ* (鶺矢醴, a decoction of quail droppings and fermented rice gruel). One dose will reveal the cause, and two doses will cure it."* (According to ancient *Běn Cǎo* (本草, Materia Medica), quail droppings do not treat *gǔ zhàng*, but they strongly promote urination and are slightly cold. The preparation method should involve soaking the ingredients in water and then ingesting the liquid.)

The Emperor asked: *"Why do some cases relapse after treatment?"*

Ghībó replied: *"'Relapse' means a recurrence of the old illness. This arises because of irregular diet—thus, the illness sometimes returns. Though the disease may seem cured, it will recur when the qi gathers in the abdomen again. When diet is irregular, the stomach is injured. The stomach’s vessels descend along the abdomen’s sides, so when diet is irregular, the illness recurs as the pathogenic qi gathers in the abdomen."*

The Emperor asked: *"There is an illness where the chest and ribs feel distended and full, impairing one’s ability to eat. When the illness strikes, one first perceives a foul, pungent odor, then emits a clear fluid, spits blood, feels coldness in the limbs, experiences dizziness, and bleeds from the front and rear orifices. What is the name of this illness? How does one contract it?"*

*"Clear fluid"* refers to clear water, also called *qīng tì* (清涕). *Qīng tì* is the fluid that leaks from the *yǎoliù* (窈漏, vaginal orifice) and drips downward like clear, tinkling water. *"Dizziness"* means the eyes spin as if turning. *"Bleeding from front and rear"* means bleeding from the front and rear orifices.

Ghībó replied: *"This illness is called *xuè kū* (血枯, blood depletion). It is contracted in youth when one suffers severe blood loss—such as from excessive sexual activity while intoxicated, which exhausts the central qi and injures the liver, causing menstrual irregularities or cessation. Excessive bleeding—whether from uterine prolapse (*lòuxià* 漏下), nasal hemorrhage (*bìwāng* 鼻魍), or vomiting blood—all fall under this category.

When one is drunk, the blood vessels become engorged, and internal heat arises. If they then engage in intercourse, the marrow and fluids drain downward, depleting the kidney’s essence. The liver stores blood to nourish the body; thus, severe blood loss injures the liver. In men, this leads to diminished semen; in women, to delayed or absent menstruation."*

The Emperor asked: *"How should this be treated? What method should be employed?"*

Ghībó replied: *"Take four pieces of **Wūliú yú gǔ** (乌刘鱼骨, *black fish bone*—likely *Squalus suckleyi* or similar) and two **Lánrú** (兰茹, *orchid tuber*—corrected from *Cōngrú* 葱茹), grind them together, and form into pills the size of small beans using sparrow eggs. Take five pills after a meal, washing them down with **bàoyú zhī** (鲍鱼汁, *abalone broth*). This clears the intestines and—according to the *Jīngfǎ* (经法, *Classical Prescriptions*)—also addresses the liver injury.

For when one, drunk and exhausted, engages in intercourse, the kidney’s essence and vital qi are depleted. If menstruation weakens or ceases, stagnant blood accumulates within. When essence is exhausted, the penis fails to rise and no semen is produced; when stagnant blood lingers, it congeals and does not disperse. Thus, these four herbs are prescribed accordingly.

The *Běn Cǎo Jīng* (《本草经》) states:
- **Wūliú yú gǔ** (乌刘鱼骨) is salty, resonant, and balanced without toxicity; it treats women’s blood stagnation.
- **Lánrú** (兰茹) is pungent, cool, and balanced with slight toxicity; it disperses stagnant blood.
- **Quēluǎn** (雀卵, *sparrow eggs*) are sweet and warm without toxicity; they treat male erectile dysfunction, strengthening vitality and increasing semen for fertility.
- **Bàoyú** (鲍鱼) is pungent, aromatic, warm, and balanced without toxicity; it treats congealed blood and stagnation in the limbs.

Thus, the prescription aligns with these properties for treatment."*

The Emperor asked: *"There are cases where the lower abdomen is distended, with pain radiating in all directions—what illness is this? Can it be treated?"*

Qì Bó said: *"This disease is named **Fú Liáng** (伏梁). **Fú Liáng** is a congealed accumulation of the heart.*

○**Newly corrected text** states: *"This **Fú Liáng** (伏梁) is vastly different from the heart accumulation known as **Fú Liáng**. There are many cases where diseases share the same name but differ in nature—such is this instance."*

The Emperor asked: *"How does one acquire **Fú Liáng**?"*

Qì Bó replied: *"If a large abscess of **púxuè** (脓血, *pus-blood*) is lodged outside the intestines and stomach, it is incurable. Attempting to treat it by pressing or probing invariably leads to death."*

The Emperor asked: *"Why is that?"*

Qì Bó said: *"Below, it presses upon the **yīn** (阴, *genital region*), inevitably causing **púxuè** (脓血) to discharge downward. Above, it forces the **wèi yuàn** (胃院, *stomach region*), producing **lì** (鬲, *a kind of abscess or phlegmon*). It also festers within the **wèi yuàn** (胃院), precisely in the section of the **Chōng Mài** (冲脉, *Rushing Vessel*) and **Dài Mài** (带脉, *Girdle Vessel*).

The **Dài Mài** (带脉) originates at the **jì xié** (季胁, *lower lateral ribs*), encircles the body in one loop, and horizontally connects at the **Qí Xià** (齐下, *lower abdomen, near the umbilicus*).

The **Chōng Mài** (冲脉) shares its branch with the **Zú Shǎo Yīn** (足少阴, *Foot Lesser Yin [Kidney] Meridian*), arising below the kidney, emerging at the **qì jiē** (气街, *Qi Street*), and running along the inner thigh (**yīn gǔ** 陰股). The upward course of this vessel exits at **Qí Xià** (齐下), three inches from the midline at the **Guān Yuán** (关元, *Close to Origin*) section, and ascends directly above the **Qí** (齐, *umbilicus*), following the abdomen to converge at the throat (**yàn hóu** 咽喉). Thus, when the disease affects this region, the lower abdomen becomes distended, and pain radiates upward, downward, left, and right.

Because its upward and downward pressure is firm and severe, like a hidden beam, the disease is called **Fú Liáng** (伏梁) and is incurable.

Since it is an abscess of **púxuè** (脓血) lodged outside the intestines and stomach, pressing it causes unbearable pain—hence, any attempt to probe or press it results in death.

The **Chōng Mài** (冲脉) descends to connect with the **yīn** (阴, *genital region*), while its upward course follows the abdomen—that is why.

Above, it presses near the **wèi guāng** (胃胱, *stomach and bladder*), while below, it lies thinly over the **yīn qì** (阴器, *genital organs*).

If it lies thinly over the **yīn** (阴), then **púxuè** (脓血) will discharge downward through the bowels. If it presses near the **wèi** (胃, *stomach*), then the pathogenic **qì** (气) will rise upward and emerge at **lì** (鬲), further festering within the **wèi yuàn** (胃院) and growing into a **tān** (痈, *deep abscess*).

○**Newly corrected text** states: *"The term **lì** (鬲) should be **shì wèi** (使胃, *affects the stomach*). This is a chronic illness, difficult to treat.*

If the abscess lies above the **Qí** (齐, *umbilicus*), it is called **nì** (逆, *counterflow*), and if it lies below the **Qí**, it is called **cóng** (从, *with flow*). It must not be disturbed, and it should be drained promptly.

If the **púxuè** (脓血) abscess lies above the **Qí** (齐), it will gradually damage the heart organ—that is why it is **nì** (逆, *counterflow*).

If it lies below the **Qí**, it is somewhat distant from the heart, yet it can still be gradually attacked—that is why it is **cóng** (从, *with flow*).

**Cóng** (从) means *to follow*, **jí** (亟) means *frequently*, and **duó** (夺) means *to remove*. The text states that it should not be moved, but only frequently drained.

This discussion appears in the *Cì Fǎ* (《刺法》). Now, the original text is lost."*

The Emperor said: "When a person’s body, **zàng** (藏, *organs*), and **gǔfǔ** (腑, *entrails*) all swell, and the region around the **Qí** (齐, *umbilicus*) aches, what illness is this?"

Qǐ Bó replied: "The illness is called **fúlìáng** (伏梁, *Hidden梁*). These twenty-six characters are displaced in the *Qí Bìng Lùn* (《奇病论》). If these twenty-six characters were not present, the following text would lack foundation.

○Newly corrected text states: "Upon close examination, no commentary exists here; all is explained in the next volume, the *Qí Bìng Lùn* (《奇病论》)."

This is the **fēnggēn** (风根, *Root of Wind*). These four characters originally appeared in this passage and also exist in the *Qí Bìng Lùn*.

Its **qi** (气) overflows into the **dàcháng** (大肠, *large intestine*) and settles in the **huàng** (肓, *Huàng organ*). The origin of the Huàng lies below the **Qí** (齐), hence the pain encircling the umbilicus.

It must not be disturbed; if disturbed, it leads to **shuǐnìshè** (水溺涩, *water retention and constriction*). It is also the **chōngmài** (冲脉, *Rushing Pulse).

Below the **Qí** (齐) refers to **bóyú** (脖腴, *Bó-Yú*), located one#12 to one and a half inches below the umbilicus on the body.

The *Língshū Jīng* (《灵枢经》) states: "The origin of the Huàng is named **Bó-Yú** (脖腴)."
**Bó** (脖) is pronounced *Bó-mòiè* (薄没切).
**Yú** (腴) is pronounced *Wū-làng* (乌朗切).

The Emperor said: "Master often speaks of **rèzhōng** (热中, *Internal Heat*) and **xiāozhōng** (消中, *Wasting Center*), saying that one must not consume **gāoliáng** (高梁, *high millet*), **fāngcǎo** (芳草, *fragrant herbs*), or **shíyào** (石药, *stone medicines*). Stone medicines cause **zhě** (疸, *jaundice*), fragrant herbs cause **kuáng** (狂, *mania).*

Excessive drinking and frequent urination are called **rèzhōng** (热中, *Internal Heat*).
Excessive eating and frequent urination are called **xiāozhōng** (消中, *Wasting Center*).
Excessive joy leads to **rìbiē** (日瘪, *daily emaciation*), and excessive anger leads to **kuáng** (狂, *mania*).
Fragrant herbs refer to **fāng** (芳, *sweet and savory flavors*).

Those afflicted by **rèzhōng** and **xiāozhōng** are all **fùguìrén** (富贵人, *wealthy and noble individuals*). Now, if we forbid them to consume **gāoliáng** (高梁, *high millet*) and fragrant herbs, it will not align with their desires. If we forbid fragrant herbs and stone medicines, their illnesses will not be cured. I wish to hear your reasoning.

For those suffering from **rèzhōng** and **xiāozhōng**, it is due to the **píqi** (脾气, *spleen qi*) overflowing and the effects of **gānféi** (甘肥, *rich and sweet foods*), hence the prohibition against consuming **gāoliáng** (高梁, *high millet*) and fragrant herbs.

The *Tōng Píng Xūshí Lùn* (《通评虚实论》) states: "Nearly all cases of **xiāozhě** (消瘴, *wasting and jaundice*) among wealthy and noble individuals are caused by **gāoliáng** (高梁, *high millet*)."

Again, the *Qí Bìng Lùn* (《奇病论》) states: "The five flavors enter the mouth and are stored in the stomach. The **pí** (脾, *spleen*) governs the distribution of their refined **qi** (精气, *essence and vital energy*). The **jīnyè** (津液, *body fluids*) depend on the spleen, hence one’s mouth tastes sweet—this is the origin of **féiměi** (肥美, *richness and beauty*).

Such individuals frequently consume rich and sweet foods, which cause **nèirè** (内热, *internal heat*) and **zhōngmǎn** (中满, *fullness in the center*). Thus, their **qi** (气) overflows and transforms into **xiāozhě** (消渴, *wasting and thirst*). This is why it is so.

Wealthy and noble individuals are often arrogant, indulgent, and prone to excessive desires, making it difficult to restrain them. If we restrain them, it goes against their will; if we comply, it exacerbates their illness. The Emperor, considering this difficult, thus raised the question.

**Gāo** (高) refers to **gāo** (膏, *grease*).
**Liáng** (梁) refers to **mǐ** (米, *rice*).
**Shíyào** (石药) refers to **yīngrǔ** (英乳, *milky substances*).
**Fāngcǎo** (芳草) refers to **nóngměi** (浓美, *intensely savory flavors*).

These five substances are commonly consumed by wealthy and noble individuals, making restraint difficult.

Qǐ Bó replied: "The **qi** (气) of fragrant herbs is sweet and harmonious, while the **qi** of stone medicines is fierce. Both possess **qi** (气) that is rapid, strong, and unyielding, hence those whose hearts are not calm or whose **virtue/power** (德) is not gentle cannot consume these two substances.

When the spleen **qi** (气) overflows and illness arises, the sweet and savory **qi** (气) further intensifies the spleen’s condition. The **qi** of wasting and heat is turbulent and fierce, thus further fueling the internal heat.

If a person’s nature is gentle, their heart is calm, their **qi** (气) aligns with the seasons, and they do not contend with external forces, they will be relaxed and at ease. Their spirit will not be agitated or fearful of internal harm, hence those whose hearts are not calm or whose **virtue/power** (德) is not gentle cannot consume these two substances.

**Hàn** (悍) means *fierce*.
**Jiān** (坚) means *fixed, stable*.
**Gù** (固) means *enduring*.
**Jìng** (劲) means *strong, unyielding*.

The **qi** (气) of fragrant herbs and stone medicines is firm, enduring, and relentlessly strong—this is what these two substances are.

The Emperor said: "Why cannot those with this illness consume these two substances?"

Qǐ Bó replied: "The **qi** (气) of heat is fierce and intense, and the **qi** (气) of these medicines is equally so. If consumed, there is fear of internally harming the spleen.

The spleen, being **tǔ** (土, *earth*), is vulnerable to **mù** (木, *wood*). Those who consume these medicines should reconsider their course by the **jiǎyǐ** (甲乙, *first and second days of the ten-stem cycle*).

If the heat **qi** (气) is fierce and intense, the **qi** of wood will internally linger. Hence, if one’s heart is not calm and gentle, **zàonù** (躁怒, *agitation and rage*) will frequently arise. When agitation and rage frequently arise, the heat **qi** (气) will, through the influence of wood, injure the spleen. **Jiǎ** (甲) and **yǐ** (乙) represent wood, so by the first and second days of the ten-stem cycle, one should reconsider the worsening of spleen illness.

The Emperor said: "Good." There is also an illness called **yīngzhǒng** (膺肿, *breast swelling*).

The newly corrected text states: According to the *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* (甲乙经), it should be **tānzhǒng** (瘫#15肿, *flaccid swelling*). When the neck aches, the chest feels full, and the abdomen is distended, what illness is this? How does one acquire it?

The **yīng** (膺, *breast/upper chest*) is the side of the chest. The **jǐng** (颈, *neck*) is the front of the nape. The **xiōng** (胸, *chest*) is the region between the **yīng** (膺, *breast*).

Qíbó replied: This is called **jué nì** (厥逆, *counterflow reversal*). It arises from **qi** reversal, hence the name **jué nì**.

The Emperor asked: How should it be treated?

Qíbó replied: If you cauterize (**jiǔ**, 灸), it will cause **chuāng** (疮, *ulcers*). If you pierce with stone (**shí**, 石), it will cause **kuáng** (狂, *madness*). One must wait until the **qi** converges before treatment is possible. By *stone*, it means using a stone needle to puncture and break it open.

The Emperor asked: Why is that?

Qíbó replied: When **yáng qi** ascends excessively, there is an excess in the upper body. If you cauterize, the **yáng qi** will enter the **yīn** (阴). Once it enters, **chuāng** (ulcers) will form. If you pierce with stone, the **yáng qi** will exit inward (**nèi**, 内), and when it is depleted, **kuáng** (madness) will arise. Cauterizing causes fire-**qi** to assist the **yáng**, and since **yáng** is excessive, it enters the **yīn**. Piercing causes the **yáng qi** to exit, and when the **yáng qi** exits, the interior becomes deficient, hence **kuáng** (madness). One must wait until the **qi** converges (**bìng**, 并) before treating it, so that it may be fully restored. By *converge*, it means to unite and harmonize. If one waits for the **qi** to naturally unite, both **yáng** and **yīn** will be complete, and thus it can be treated. If not, and one cauterizes or pierces, then one **qi** will dominate over the other, resulting in imbalance, and thus it cannot be fully restored, leading to **jí kuáng** (瘠狂, *emaciation and madness*).

The Emperor said: Good. How does one know when a fetus in the womb is about to be born?

Qi Bó said: *"There is illness in the body yet no perverse pulse."* By *illness*, he means menstrual obstruction.

The *Pulse Canon* states: *"A pulse in the radial position that comes and then abruptly ceases denotes menstrual obstruction."* If menstrual blood does not flow smoothly and the radial pulse ceases, it is also menstrual obstruction. Now, when one suffers from menstrual obstruction yet the pulse appears normal, this is the sign of a woman’s pregnancy, hence the saying: *"There is illness in the body yet no perverse pulse."*

The Emperor asked: *"If one suffers from heat and has a localized pain, what does this signify?"*

Qi Bó replied: *"Illness marked by heat pertains to the **yáng** pulses. When the three **yáng** pulses surge—if the *rén yīng* (人迎) pulse is excessively strong, the illness lies in the lesser **yáng**; if it surges twice, the illness lies in the greater **yáng**; if it surges three times, the illness lies in the **yáng míng** (陽明)—it enters the **yīn** (陰). When **yáng** enters **yīn**, the illness manifests in the head and abdomen, resulting in distension and headache."*

The Emperor said: *"Good."*

The *Six Divisions and Hidden Symbols* (六节藏象论) further clarifies: *"If the *rén yīng* pulse surges once, the illness is in the lesser **yáng**; if it surges twice, the illness is in the greater **yáng**; if it surges three times, the illness is in the **yáng míng**."* This aligns with the present theory.

Additionally, the *Canon of the Celestial Cycles* (甲乙经) omits the phrase *"it enters the **yīn**"* (入阴也) after *"three times surging"* (三盛).

「**Chapter on Needling Lumbar Pain**
The **greater yáng** channel of the foot causes lumbar pain, drawing the nape, spine, and scapular region as if bearing a heavy burden.

The **greater yáng** channel of the foot branches downward from the nape, courses along the inner shoulder, and traverses beside the spine to reach the lumbar region, then descends through the buttocks. Thus, it causes lumbar pain, drawing the nape, spine, and scapular region as if bearing a heavy burden.

**Newly Corrected Text states:** According to the *Canon of the Celestial Cycles* (甲乙经), "across the buttocks" (贯臀) is corrected to "across the groin" (贯绅). The *Needling Malaria* (刺疟) commentary also reads "across the swelling" (贯肿). The *Three Divisions and Nine Lords* (三部九侯) commentary retains "across the buttocks" (贯臀). The pronunciation of 民 is *gù xiào* (苦笑切).

Needle the **yīn** (陰) point within the knee crease—the **greater yáng** channel’s proper pulse—where the **yīn** (陰) pulse lies at the center of the knee’s posterior bend, five *fēn* (分) of a *cùn* (寸) deep, and retain for seven breaths. If cauterized (*jiǔ*), apply three *zhuàng* (壮). The **greater yáng** channel converges with the kidneys, and since the kidneys reign in winter while water (水) declines in spring, no blood appears in spring.

The **lesser yáng** channel causes lumbar pain, rendering the patient stiff as if needled through the skin, unable to bend forward or backward, unable to turn their head. The **lesser yáng** channel of the foot encircles the hairline, then crosses horizontally into the spleen’s *yàn* (厌) point. Thus, it causes lumbar pain, stiffening the patient as if needled through the skin, unable to bend forward or backward. The **lesser yáng** channel arises at the *ruì bì* (锐毗) point of the eye, ascends to the temple’s apex, descends behind the ear, and courses along the head, passing before the **hand yáng míng** channel, reaching the shoulder, and emerging behind the **hand lesser yáng** channel. Its branch diverges downward from *ruì bì* (锐毗) to *dà yíng* (大迎), converging with the **hand lesser yáng** channel at the *yí* (颐) point, descending to join *jié chē* (颊车), then descending the neck to converge at *quē pén* (缺盆). Thus, the patient cannot turn their head.

**Newly Corrected Text states:** According to the *Canon of the Celestial Cycles* (甲乙经), "passing before the **hand yáng míng** channel" (行手阳明之前) is corrected to "passing before the **hand lesser yáng** channel" (行手少阳之前).

Needle the **lesser yáng** channel at the *chéng gǔ* (成骨) point’s tip to draw blood, where *chéng gǔ* (成骨) lies at the uppermost end of the *fǔ gǔ* (腑骨) near the outer knee, the two rising bones standing parallel and the depression where the finger rests. Since the **lesser yáng** channel converges with the liver, and the liver governs **#2** (主#2於春) in spring while wood (木) declines in summer, no blood appears in summer.

The **yáng míng** channel causes lumbar pain, rendering the patient unable to turn their head. If they appear to turn their head, they are prone to **sorrow** (悲), for **yáng** is in decline.

The **yáng míng** channel of the foot arises at the nose, crosses *pín zhōng* (频中), descends along the outer nasal wall into the upper teeth, then returns to course beside the mouth and encircle the lips, descending to converge at *chéng jiāng* (承浆), and then retracing to the *yí* (颐) point, descending to exit at *dà yíng* (大迎). Its branch diverges from *dà yíng* (大迎) forward, descending to *rén yíng* (人迎), and courses along the throat into *quē pén* (缺盆). Another branch arises below the stomach’s mouth, encircling the abdomen to the *qì jiē* (气街) point, where it converges, then descends to the spleen. Thus, it causes lumbar pain and renders the patient unable to turn their head. If they appear to turn their head, they are prone to **sorrow** (悲), for **yáng** is in decline.

Needle the **yáng míng** channel at the *fǔ* (腑) point’s front, three *zhuàng* (瘠) below, drawing blood from the upper and lower harmonized points, where no blood appears in autumn. According to the *Illustrated Canon of the Inner Classic* (内经中诰流注图经), the **yáng míng** channel’s pulse points govern lumbar pain, and the proper needle site for this condition is the *sān lǐ* (三里) point, located three *cùn* (寸) below the knee at the division between the two muscles beside the *fǔ gǔ* (腑骨). Needle five *fēn* (分) of a *cùn* (寸) deep, retain for seven breaths. If cauterized (*jiǔ*), apply three *zhuàng* (壮). The **yáng míng** channel converges with the spleen, which reigns in late summer while earth (土) declines in autumn, hence no blood appears in autumn.

**Newly Corrected Text states:** According to the *Canon of the Celestial Cycles* (甲乙经), the □ (□) is corrected to □ (□).

The **lesser yīn** channel of the foot causes lumbar pain, drawing the inner side of the spine. The **lesser yīn** channel of the foot ascends along the inner posterior thigh, passes through the spine, and attaches to the kidneys. Thus, it causes lumbar pain, drawing the inner side of the spine.

**Newly Corrected Text states:** According to the *Complete Canon of the Great Primordium* (全元起本), "inner side of the spine" (脊内廉) is corrected to "inner side of the spine, pain" (脊内痛). The *Tàisū* (太素) also agrees.

This pertains to the preceding cases of lumbar pain in the **lesser yīn** and **foot greater yīn** channels, all of which should be treated by needling the **foot greater yīn** method, likely due to an omission in the ancient texts.

Needle the **lesser yīn** channel at the point two *zhuàng* (瘠) above the inner ankle, where no blood appears in spring. If too much blood is drawn (#3), it cannot be replenished. According to the *Illustrated Canon of the Inner Classic* (内经中语流注图经), the **lesser yīn** channel’s pulse points govern lumbar pain, and the proper needle site is the *fù liú* (复溜) point, located two *cùn* (寸) above the inner ankle’s posterior edge. Needle three *fēn* (分) of a *cùn* (寸) deep, retain for three breaths. If cauterized (*jiǔ*), apply five *zhuàng* (壮).

The **yīn** (厥阴) channel causes lumbar pain, rendering the lumbar region taut as if a bowstring were drawn. The **foot yīn** (厥阴) channel ascends from the inner thigh, encircling the genital region, and reaching the lower abdomen. Its branch diverges and converges with the **foot greater yīn** and **lesser yáng** channels below the lumbar region beside the spine, between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae, at the *zhōng lóu* (中髅) and *xià lóu* (下髅) points. Thus, lumbar pain renders the region taut as if a bowstring.

If taut as a bowstring, it signifies extreme tension and urgency. Needle the **yīn** (厥阴) channel’s pulse at the outer edge of the *duān zhǒng yú fù* (端踵鱼腹), where its divisions appear like clustered beads, at the proper *lì gōu* (蠡沟) point’s division. The **foot yīn** (厥阴) channel’s collateral lies five *cùn* (寸) above the inner ankle, branching to the **lesser yáng** channel. Needle two *fēn* (分) of a *cùn* (寸) deep, retain for three breaths. If cauterized (*jiǔ*), apply three *zhuàng* (壮).

The *Three Divisions of the Dao* (厥阴三#4经) is written as *jū yīn* (居阴), as the cursive *kù* (厥) character was mistakenly transcribed as *jū* (居).

**Newly Corrected Text states#5:** According to the *Canon* (经), it reads: "The **yīn** (厥阴) channel causes lumbar pain," followed by "Needle the **yīn** (厥阴) channel’s pulse," and the commentary states: "Needle the **yīn** (厥阴) channel’s collateral." The *Canon* and its commentary contradict each other, suggesting the **pulse** (脉) character in the *Canon* may be a mistaken transcription for **collateral** (络).」

「**Jīng** (踹), when twisted and cut, its ailment causes one to speak excessively (*shàn yán*), in a mumbling, incoherent manner (*hēi hēi rán*), lacking wisdom. Needling it three times (*sān jié*) remedies the condition.

The **yīn** (厥阴) channel follows behind the throat, ascending to the occipital bone, and connects to the root of the tongue. Thus, when diseased, it causes excessive speech. When wind prevails, it induces dizziness and confusion, hence the lack of clarity and wisdom. Needling the channel three times alleviates lumbar pain.

---
**Newly Corrected Text states:** The *Canon* records "excessive speech, mumbling incoherently," but these two symptoms are difficult to reconcile. The *Quán Yuánqǐ* text omits the character *shàn* (善), making the meaning more plausible. Additionally, the *Jiǎ-Yǔ Jīng* states that the **yīn** (厥阴) channel does not connect to the root of the tongue, yet Wang’s annotations in the *Su Wèn*—referencing five passages—state that the *Guì Lùn* (厥论), *Cì Rè* (刺热), and this text all claim it connects to the tongue’s root, while the *Fēng Lùn* (风论) and *Bì Lùn* (痹论) do not. Wang likely doubted this, hence the conflicting annotations.

**Jié Mài** (解脉), the "unbound channel," causes lumbar pain that radiates to the shoulders, with the eyes appearing strained (*mù háng háng rán*), and occasional urinary incontinence (*shí yí sōu*). **Jié Mài** refers to a dispersed, irregular channel that does not follow the proper path but branches separately. This is the channel of the **Foot Tàiyáng** (足太阳), originating at the inner canthus, ascending the forehead to the vertex, descending along the shoulder and scapula, following the spine to the lumbar region, penetrating the flank, connecting to the kidney, and descending into the perineum. Thus, its ailments manifest accordingly.

Another branch diverges from the flank, passing through the lower abdomen, following the posterior edge of the lumbar region, and merging into the perineum. These two channels resemble a frayed rope (*rú gōng zhī jiě*), hence the name **Jié Mài**. To needle **Jié Mài**, locate the transverse pulse on the inner side of the knee tendon, six *fēn* from the outer edge of the thigh (*#6 quán wài lián*), and bleed it. The blood should change color before stopping.

Behind the knee, on either side of the large tendon, between the two hamstrings, where the horizontal muscle fibers rise like a bowstring (*nǔ ròu gāo qǐ*), lies the **Yóu Zhōng** (邮中) division. The ancient *Zhōng Yǔ* (中语) identifies **Yóu Zhōng** as the **Tàiyáng** (太阳) division. Needle where the transverse blood vessel appears dark purple and distended. Black blood should flow; observe until it turns red before stopping. If the blood does not turn red, exhaust the bleeding until it does. This is the **Tàiyáng** channel’s contribution to lumbar pain.

**Jié Mài** causes lumbar pain as if bound by a belt (*rú yǐn dài*), with the patient often bent forward like a broken bow (*cháng rú zhé yāo zhàng*), prone to fear.

The **Foot Tàiyáng**’s divergent channel descends from the shoulder, follows the spine to the lumbar region, and horizontally enters the posterior flank before merging into the perineum. Thus, it causes the sensation of being bound by a belt or a broken bow posture.

---
**Newly Corrected Text states:** The *Jiǎ-Yǔ Jīng* describes the belt-like pain as "like splitting" (*rú liè*), and "prone to fear" as "prone to anger" (*shàn nù*).

To needle **Jié Mài**, locate the clustered collateral (*jié luò*) near **Yí Zhōng** (邸中), resembling a grain of millet (*rú shǔ mǐ*), where black blood spurts forth upon needling. Observe until red blood appears before stopping. **Yí Zhōng** is the **Wěi Zhōng** (委中) acupoint, the **Tàiyáng** convergence point. Located at the center of the knee’s posterior crease, where the femoral artery pulses, needle five *fēn* deep, retain for seven breaths. If cauterized, apply three *zhuàng*. This is the *Canon*’s method. Now, target the clustered collateral as large as a grain of millet, where black blood spurts like an arrow. Stop when the blood turns red.

---
**Newly Corrected Text states:** *Quán Yuánqǐ* notes that there are two **Jié Mài** channels, with distinct origins of disease, suggesting potential confusion.

**Tóng Yīn Mài** (同阴脉) causes lumbar pain as if struck by a small hammer (*xiǎo chuí jū qí zhōng*), with swelling and distension (*fú rán zhǒng*). This is the divergent collateral of **Foot Shàoyáng** (足少阳). Alongside the **Shàoyáng** channel, it ascends five *cùn* above the lateral malleolus, then diverges to join the **yīn** (厥阴) channel, descending to connect with the **Fù** (附) collateral of the foot. Hence, it is called **Tóng Yīn Mài**. *Fú* (怫) means "angry," describing the swelling as if in a state of anger.

The corrected text states that in *Tàisù*, "small hammer" (*xiǎo chuí*) should read **"small needle" (小针)**. *Fú* is pronounced *fú* (弗).

To acupuncture the **Tóng Yīn Mài**, locate it above the lateral malleolus at the end of the *jué gǔ* (绝骨), marking three *cùn* intervals. The end of *jué gǔ* is three *fēn* (分) above the *tóngshēncǔn* (同身寸) line, corresponding to the **Yángfǔ** (阳辅) acupoint, where the **Foot Shàoyáng** (足少阳) channel passes. Needling may penetrate five *fēn* into the flesh, with retention for seven breaths. If moxibustion is applied, three *zhuàng* (壮) are sufficient.

The **Yángwéi** (阳维) channel causes lumbar pain ascending with distension and swelling. The **Yángwéi** originates from the **Tàiyáng** (太阳) and is one of the **Eight Extraordinary Vessels**. To acupuncture the **Yángwéi**, locate it where the channel converges with the **Tàiyáng** at the lower end of the *duānxià* (端下), one *chǐ* (尺) above the ground. The **Tàiyáng** channel runs parallel to the main channel, ascending to the *ruì* (瑞) region before merging again with the **Tàiyáng** and ascending further. The *duānxià* is one *chǐ* above the ground, corresponding to the **Chéngguāng** (承光) acupoint—though corrected as **Chéngshān** (承山)—located in the depression below the *ruì* (锐端) and the *cháng* (肠) muscle. Needling may penetrate seven *fēn* into the flesh, with retention for seven breaths. If moxibustion is applied, five *zhuàng* are sufficient. The term *duānxià* refers to the depression below the *ruì* and *cháng* muscle.

The **Héngluò** (衡络) channel causes lumbar pain preventing flexion or extension; extension risks collapse. Injury from lifting heavy objects severs the **Héngluò**, causing stagnant *qi* and blood to accumulate. *Héng* (衡) means "horizontal," referring to the external collateral of **Tàiyáng**, which horizontally enters the posterior lateral region of the spleen before descending to merge with the central channel at the *zhuǎnzhōng* (掴中). When the **Héngluò** is severed by heavy lifting, the central channel dominates, causing inflexible lumbar pain. The original text mistakenly reads *yīxíng* (一经) as *jué* (绝); the correct term is *xíngluò* (行络). To acupuncture, locate between the **Bùyáng** (部阳) and **Yīnmén** (殷门) tendons, several *cùn* above the *yóuyáng* (邮阳). The **Héngluò** emerges at two *jué* (瘠) points for bloodletting. The two acupoints—**Wěiyáng** (委阳) and **Yīnmén**—are horizontally aligned when viewed levelly. **Fúyóu** (浮邮) refers to the lateral **Wěiyáng** acupoint, while the tendon interval describes the **Yīnmén** acupoint behind the knee, between the two hamstring tendons. Both acupoints are six *cùn* from the *tóngshēncǔn* line below the buttocks, hence "several *cùn* above the *yóuyáng*". Needling **Wěiyáng** may penetrate seven *fēn* with retention for five breaths, or apply three *zhuàng* of moxibustion. Needling **Yīnmén** may penetrate five *fēn* with retention for seven breaths, or apply three *zhuàng* of moxibustion. Thus, the **Héngluò** emerges at two *jué* points.

The **Huìyīn** (会阴) channel causes lumbar pain ascending with a *lìlì* (漯漯) sensation, profuse sweating, and thirst upon drying. The **Huìyīn** is the central channel of **Foot Tàiyáng** (足太阳), converging at the perineum. With excessive *yáng* energy, lumbar pain ascends with sweating. As sweat evaporates, kidney *yīn* deficiency causes thirst to replenish fluids. Once water is ingested, kidney *qi* revives, *yīn* circulates, and **Tàiyáng** energy surges, prompting restlessness. To acupuncture the **Zhíyáng** (直阳) channel—another name for **Tàiyáng**—locate three *jué* points above the *jiāo* (娇) and five *cùn* below the *yóuyáng*, horizontally aligned. Bloodletting targets the most congested collateral. The **Zhíyáng** channel runs straight along the spine, through the buttocks, and down the calf, passing behind the lateral malleolus. The *tā* (踏) refers to the **Shēntā** (申脉) acupoint below the lateral malleolus, while *yóuyáng* refers to the depression below the buttocks. The needling site is five *cùn* below the *yóuyáng*, aligning with **Chéngjīn** (承筋) acupoint—central and slightly depressed. Though the **Tàiyáng** channel is forbidden for direct needling, moxibustion of three *zhuàng* is permissible. Bloodletting targets congested collaterals at both *ruì* (瑞) regions, focusing on the most distended areas.

The **Fēiyáng** (飞阳) channel causes lumbar pain ascending with a *fúfó* (怫佛) sensation, progressing to sorrow and fear. This is the **Yínwéi** (阴维) channel, located five *cùn* above the medial malleolus along the **Foot Shàoyīn** (足少阴) channel. The **Shàoyīn** channel ascends from the kidney, passing through the liver, entering the lung, and along the throat beside the tongue’s root. Its branch connects to the heart, explaining the progression to sorrow (from the heart) and fear (from the kidney).

For lumbar pain:
- Ascending cold: acupuncture **Foot Tàiyáng** and **Yángmíng** (阳明).
- Ascending heat: acupuncture **Foot Juéyīn** (厥阴).
- Inability to flex/extend: acupuncture **Foot Shàoyáng**.
- Internal heat with dyspnea: acupuncture **Foot Shàoyīn** and bleed **Yóuyáng** (邮阳).

This method is profound and mysterious. The *Zhōnggào* (《中诰》) differs, and none can fathom its depths. One must discern its **Dao/Way** (应) through understanding; otherwise, all cases require first bleeding the **blood vessels** (血络) before regulation.

For lumbar pain ascending with cold, where turning is impossible:
- Acupuncture **Foot Yángmíng** (阳明) is primary.
- **Yínshì** (阴市) governs ascending cold.
  **Yínshì** is located three *cùn* above the knee along the *tóngshēncùn* (同身寸) measurement, in the depression beneath the **Fǔsū** (伏菟) where the **Foot Yángmíng** (阳明) channel’s **qi** (脉气) manifests. Needling may penetrate three *fēn* of the *tóngshēncùn*, retaining the needle for seven breaths. If cauterized, apply three *zhuàng* (壮).

For inability to turn:
- **Sānlǐ** (三里) governs it.
  **Sānlǐ** is located three *cùn* below the knee along the *tóngshēncùn*, between the two muscles where the **Foot Yángmíng** channel enters. Needling may penetrate three *fēn* of the *tóngshēncùn*, retaining the needle for seven breaths. If cauterized, apply three *zhuàng*.

For ascending heat:
- Acupuncture **Foot Tàiyīn** (太阴) is primary.
- **Dìjī** (地机) governs it.
  **Dìjī** is located five *cùn* below the knee along the *tóngshēncùn*, the **Dao/Way** (邮) of the **Foot Tàiyīn** channel. Needling may penetrate three *fēn* of the *tóngshēncùn*; if cauterized, apply three *zhuàng*.
  *(Newly corrected: According to *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* (《甲乙经》), apply five *zhuàng* instead.)*

For internal heat with dyspnea:
- Acupuncture **Foot Shàoyīn** (少阴) is primary.
- **Yǒngquán** (涌泉) and **Tàizhōng** (太钟) govern it entirely.
  **Yǒngquán** is in the depression at the center of the sole, where the toes curl inward. It is the origin of the **Foot Shàoyīn** channel. Needling may penetrate three *fēn* of the *tóngshēncùn*, retaining the needle for three breaths. If cauterized, apply three *zhuàng*.
  **Tàizhōng** is in the depression behind the heel’s lateral artery, the **Dao/Way** (络) of the **Foot Shàoyīn** channel. Needling may penetrate two *fēn* of the *tóngshēncùn*, retaining the needle for seven breaths. If cauterized, apply three *zhuàng*.
  *(Newly corrected: According to *Cìnuè* (《刺疟》) and the *Shuǐxué Lùn* (《水穴论》), **Dàzhōng** (大钟) is located behind the medial malleolus. The three annotations differ; the correct location aligns with *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* (《甲乙经》), which states it is in the depression behind the heel’s lateral artery.)*

For difficult defecation:
- Acupuncture **Foot Shàoyīn** (少阴) is primary.
  **Yǒngquán** governs it.
- For fullness in the lower abdomen:
  - Acupuncture **Foot Juéyīn** (厥阴) is primary.
  **Tàichōng** (太冲) governs it.
  Located two *cùn* behind the base of the big toe along the *tóngshēncùn*, in the depression where the pulse moves under the hand, it is where the **Foot Juéyīn** channel’s **qi** (脉) converges. Needling may penetrate three *fēn* of the *tóngshēncùn*, retaining the needle for ten breaths. If cauterized, apply three *zhuàng*.

If the lumbar pain resembles a fracture, rendering turning or lifting impossible:
- Acupuncture **Foot Tàiyáng** (太阳) is primary.
  For the fracture-like condition:
  - **Shùgǔ** (束骨) governs it.
  For inability to turn:
  - **Jīnggǔ** (京骨) and **Kūnlún** (昆仑) govern it entirely.
  For inability to lift:
  - **Shēnmài** (申脉) and **Pūshēn** (仆参) govern it entirely.

  **Shùgǔ** is in the depression behind the little toe’s lateral base, between the red and white muscle. It is where the **Foot Tàiyáng** channel’s **qi** (脉) converges. Needling may penetrate three *fēn* of the *tóngshēncùn*, retaining the needle for three breaths. If cauterized, apply three *zhuàng*.

  **Jīnggǔ** is in the depression beneath the large bone on the foot’s lateral side, between the red and white muscle. Pressing yields its location, where the **Foot Tàiyáng** channel passes. Needling may penetrate three *fēn* of the *tóngshēncùn*, retaining the needle for seven breaths. If cauterized, apply three *zhuàng*.

  **Kūnlún** is in the depression behind the lateral malleolus, above the heel bone, where fine pulses move under the hand. It is where the **Foot Tàiyáng** channel’s **Dao/Way** (脉) runs. Needling may penetrate five *fēn* of the *tóngshēncùn*, retaining the needle for ten breaths. If cauterized, apply three *zhuàng*.

  **Shēnmài** is located five *fēn* below the lateral malleolus, within the **Yángtā** (阳踏) depression. Needling may penetrate six *fēn* of the *tóngshēncùn*, retaining the needle for ten breaths. If cauterized, apply three *zhuàng*.
  *(Newly corrected: According to *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* (《甲乙经》), **Shēnmài** is in the depression without the "five *fēn*" specification. The needle retention of "ten breaths" is corrected to "six breaths" in the *Qìxué* (《气穴》) annotation.)*

  **Pūshēn** is in the depression beneath the heel bone, where the **Foot Tàiyáng** and **Yángtā** (阳踏) channels converge. Needling may penetrate three *fēn* of the *tóngshēncùn*, retaining the needle for seven breaths. If cauterized, apply three *zhuàng*.
  *(Newly corrected: According to *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* (《甲乙经》), needle retention for **Pūshēn** is six breaths instead.)*

For lumbar pain radiating inward to the lower abdomen and restricting the **Dao/Way** (控) of the flanks (*jìxié* 季胁), where lifting is impossible:
  *(Newly corrected: According to *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* (《甲乙经》), the phrase is "inability to turn.")*
  **Chāo** (抄) refers to the soft, hollow space beneath the flanks.

The **Yáoshī Jiāo** (腰尸交) points are located beneath the two **jiá** (髁) bones, where the lumbar vertebrae’s eight hollow spaces converge—commonly called the **Bājiāogǔ** (八胶骨). These are the eight points beneath the lumbar vertebrae, where the **Foot Tàiyīn**, **Juéyīn**, and **Shàoyáng** channels intersect on both sides, hence the name **Yáoshī Jiāo**.

The "two **jiá** (髁) swellings" refer to the firm, raised flesh beneath the two **jiá** bones. "Above the swellings" does not mean the topmost peak of the swelling but rather the **virtue/power** (俞) of the central **Zhōnglǒu** (中膂) muscle and **Báihuán** (白环). Though they also govern lumbar pain, their anatomical and symptomatic alignment does not conform with the **Dao/Way** (经) described.

The **jiá** (髁) bones are the bony prominences rising on both sides of the lumbar spine. Beneath the lumbar vertebrae and beside the spine, there are raised, swollen masses of flesh that slope inward toward the posterior of the **jiá** bones, internally supporting them—hence the term *"two swollen **jiá**."*

Below these swollen masses, each side has four hollow spaces, thus called *"upper **lǚ** (僇), middle **lǚ**, central **jiāo** (胶), and lower **lóu** (髅)."* The upper **lóu** lies directly beneath the depression of the **jiá** bone, while the remaining three **lóu** are slightly lower. When pressed, they sink inward. All four hollows govern lumbar pain, but only the lower **lóu** aligns with the classical texts, corresponding to where the **Foot Tàiyīn**, **Juéyīn**, and **Shàoyáng** channels converge.

Needling may penetrate to three *cùn* (same-body inches), retained for ten breaths. If moxibustion is applied, three *zhàng* (cones) suffice. The number of treatments follows the lunar phases—*yue sheng* (月生, waxing moon) for more, *yue si* (月死, waning moon) for fewer. As the *Miǔ Cì Lùn* states:
*"On the first day of the waxing moon, one treatment; the second, two; increasing thus until the fifteenth day, fifteen treatments. From the sixteenth day onward, decrease by one each day."*

The number of treatments follows this pattern.

**Jiá** (髁) is pronounced *kǔ wǎ qiè* (苦瓦切).
**Jiāo** (胶) is pronounced *liáo* (辽).

For left-sided pain, needle the right side; for right-sided pain, needle the left. This is because the channels cross and converge within the **shīgǔ** (尸骨).

**Wind Theory (Fēng Lùn)**

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"When wind injures a person, it may cause alternating cold and heat, internal heat, internal cold, pestilential wind, hemiplegia, or mere wind illness. The diseases differ, their names vary, and some penetrate to the five *zàng* (藏) and six *fǔ* (府). I do not know their resolution—pray, explain them."*

*"Injury"* refers to self-inflicted harm.

Gē Bó replied:
*"Wind-*qi* lodges between the skin and flesh. Unable to circulate internally or vent externally, it seizes the pores and closes the **xiānfú** (玄府). When the pores open and relax, evil wind enters. Once wind-*qi* has entered, the **xiānfú** seals shut, blocking internal circulation and external release.

Wind moves swiftly and frequently changes. When the pores open, a chill spreads—*sǎrán* (洒然)—and when they close, heat and suffocation arise. *Sǎrán* describes the sensation of cold; *wèn* (问) describes stifling heat. When the pores open, wind billows freely, causing cold. When they close, wind stagnates, causing heat.

Its coldness diminishes appetite and drink, while its heat consumes flesh and muscle, leaving the person trembling and unable to eat—this is called *hánrè* (寒热).

When cold wind enters the stomach, appetite and drink weaken. When heat-*qi* accumulates internally, flesh and muscle waste away. Cold and heat combine, causing trembling and inability to eat—thus it is called *hánrè*.

*Hánrè* (寒热) describes sudden shivering from cold.

When wind-*qi* and the **Yángmíng** channel enter the stomach, ascending along the meridian to the inner canthus, if the person is fat, wind-*qi* cannot vent externally, resulting in internal heat and jaundiced eyes. If the person is lean, wind vents externally as cold, causing cold invasion and lacrimation.

**Yángmíng** refers to the stomach channel. It originates at the nose, passes through the upper jaw, descends along the outer nose into the upper teeth, then emerges beside the mouth to encircle the lips. It descends to meet **Chéngjiāng** (承浆), then follows the jawline behind the angle of the mandible, passes the throat, enters the supraclavicular fossa, descends to the epigastrium, and connects to the stomach. Thus, when wind-*qi* and **Yángmíng** enter the stomach, ascending to the inner canthus—

If the person is fat, their pores are dense and closed, preventing external release, leading to internal heat and jaundiced eyes. If lean, the pores open and relax, allowing wind to vent externally, resulting in cold invasion and lacrimation.

When wind-*qi* enters alongside the **Tàiyáng** channel, it disperses through the muscle layers, interacting with the **wèiqì** (卫气). If this passage is obstructed, it causes muscle spasms and ulcers. When **wèiqì** stagnates and fails to circulate, the flesh becomes numb.

Between the muscle layers, where **wèiqì** flows, wind and **wèiqì** clash, moving together through the muscle interstices. If the passage is blocked, wind-*qi* attacks internally, and **wèiqì** resists, causing muscle spasms and ulceration.

*Liè* (疠) refers to ulcers.

If **wèiqì** is blown by wind and cannot circulate, it pools in one area, stagnating and failing to move, leading to numbness in the flesh. *Bùrén* (不仁) means the flesh lacks sensation of cold, heat, pain, or itch.

*Pestilential wind* (*lìfēng*, 疠风) arises when stagnant **róngwèi** (荣卫) heat accumulates, the *qi* becomes turbid, and the nasal septum collapses with discoloration, while the skin ulcerates. This occurs when wind enters the meridians, attacking the blood and merging with **róngqì** (荣气), generating heat that corrupts the blood.

When the *qi* is turbid, the skin ruptures and festers. Blood and meridians are disrupted, **róngqì** carries wind, and the **yángmài** (阳脉) ascend to the head. The nose, being the passage for inhalation and exhalation, collapses with foul odor, while the skin breaks and festers.

As the *Mài Yào Jīngwēi Lùn* states: *"When wind-*qi* is excessive, it becomes pestilential."*

*Lì* (疠) is pronounced *hú duì qiè* (胡对切).

When wind and cold lodge in the meridians and do not disperse, it is called *lìfēng* (疠风), or *hánrè* (寒热). Initially, it manifests as *hánrè*; when heat solidifies, it becomes *lìfēng*.

According to seasonal patterns:
- Wind injuring the liver in spring (*jia yi*, 甲乙) is **liver wind**,
- Wind injuring the heart in summer (*bing ding*, 丙丁) is **heart wind**,
- Wind injuring the spleen in late summer (*wu ji*, 戊己) is **spleen wind**,
- Wind injuring the lungs in autumn (*geng xin*, 庚辛) is **lung wind**,
- Wind injuring the kidneys in winter (*ren gui*, 壬癸) is **kidney wind**.

In spring, the *Jia-Yi* (甲乙) wood element, with the liver as its sovereign;
In summer, the *Bing-Ding* (丙丁) fire element, with the heart as its sovereign;
In late summer, the *Wu-Ji* (戊己) earth element, with the spleen as its sovereign;
In autumn, the *Geng-Xin* (庚辛) metal element, with the lungs as its sovereign;
In winter, the *Ren-Gui* (壬癸) water element, with the kidneys as its sovereign.

When wind invades the *acupuncture points* (俞) of the five *zàng* organs and six *fǔ* viscera, it also becomes the wind of the *zàng* and *fǔ*—each entering through its respective *doorway* (门户) and causing **lateralized wind** (偏风). When it strikes the left or right *acupuncture points* in a lateralized manner, it is likewise **lateralized wind**.

When the wind-*qi* ascends along the *Wind Palace* (风府) meridian, it becomes **brain wind** (脑风).
When wind enters the *systems of the head* (系头), it becomes **eye wind** (目风) or *yǎn hán* (眼寒).

The *Wind Palace* (风府) is the name of an acupuncture point, located one *cùn* (寸) within the great tendon at the junction of the nape and hairline, where the *Governor Vessel* (督脉) and *Yang Maintenance* (阳维) converge. Ascending from *Wind Palace*, it reaches the *brain aperture* (脑户). The *brain aperture* is where the *Governor Vessel* (督脉) of the *Foot Taiyang* (足太阳) meridian converges. Hence, ascending along *Wind Palace* leads to **brain wind**.

The *Foot Taiyang* (足太阳) meridian originates from the *inner canthus* (目内毗), ascends the forehead to meet at the vertex, enters the *brain networks* (络脑), and then returns. Therefore, when wind invades the *systems of the head*, it results in **eye wind** or *yǎn hán*.

If one drinks alcohol and is struck by wind, it becomes **leakage wind** (漏风).
When heat is suppressed and dispersion is inadequate, wind invasion causes profuse sweating—like liquid leaking—hence the term **leakage wind**. The *Classics* also refer to it as **alcohol-induced wind** (酒风).

If wind strikes during or after sexual activity, causing sweating, it is called **internal wind** (内风).
Here, internal *consumption* (内耗) depletes one’s *essence* (精), while external *exposure* (外开) weakens the *body’s defenses* (胜理), leading to wind invasion—thus termed **internal wind**. The *Classics* also call it **exhaustion wind** (劳风).

If wind strikes after a recent hair-washing, it becomes **head wind** (首风).
When wind invades the head during or after hair-washing, it lodges there—hence **head wind**.

If wind lingers for long and invades deeply, it becomes **intestinal wind** (肠风), causing *cān* (餐) and *xiè* (泄).
When wind resides in the intestines, it obstructs the *stomach’s descending function* (上需於胃), causing indigestion and diarrhea—*cān* (uncontrolled eating) and *xiè* (leakage). *Yǎngxiè* (养泄) refers to undigested food passing through. The *new annotation* states: *"Sàixiè* (赛泄) means water and grain are not properly separated, leading to benefit." When external *exposure* (外在) weakens the *body’s defenses* (胜理), it becomes **leakage wind** (泄风). Wind residing in the *abdominal cavities* (腆理) causes the *mysterious viscera* (玄府) to open, leading to thin sweating and leakage—thus termed **leakage wind**.

Hence, wind is the **originator of a hundred diseases** (百病之长). When it transforms, it becomes the *Fēiyáng* (飞阳) meridian of *other needling* (他刺), located five *cùn* (寸) above the inner ankle—*new annotation*: *"The *Jia-Yi Classics* state it is two *cùn* (寸)."* It lies before the *Foot Shaoyin* (少阴) meridian and coincides with the *Yin Maintenance* (阴维) convergence. The *Fùliú* (复溜) point is five *cùn* above the inner ankle, along the *Foot Shaoyin* meridian’s path. Needling may penetrate three *fēn* (分) of the *same-body cùn* (同身寸). The *Zhùbīn* (筑宾) point, located behind the inner ankle, is the *Yin Maintenance*’s station—needling may penetrate three *fēn* of the *same-body cùn*, or if cauterized, five *zhuàng* (壮). Before the inner ankle, where the *Yin Maintenance* converges, lies the convergence of the three meridians—needling may penetrate three *fēn* of the *same-body cùn*, or if cauterized, five *zhuàng*. This aligns with the *Zhōnghuà Classics* (《中诰经》).

The *Fēiyáng* (飞阳) meridian causes *lumbago* (腰痛), radiating to the chest, with a *dry, grating sensation in the eyes* (目吭硫然), severe cases leading to *backward folding* (反折), *tongue curling* (舌卷), and inability to speak. This is the *Yīntà* (阴踏) meridian. *Yīntà* is a branch of the *Foot Shaoyin* (少阴), originating behind the *ankle bone* (踝骨), ascending to the inner ankle, then straight up along the inner thigh, entering the abdomen, and ascending through the chest, reaching the *suprasternal fossa* (缺盆). It emerges before the *Rén yíng* (人迎) point, enters the *inner canthus* (目内毗), and converges with the *Foot Taiyang* (太阳) *Yángjiāo* (阳娇) meridian, ascending thereafter. Thus, the *lumbago* manifests as described. Needling the *inner tendon* (内筋) creates two *sores* (疮)—located two *cùn* above the inner ankle, before the great tendon and behind the *Foot Taiyin* (太阴) meridian. The *inner tendon* refers to the inner section of the great tendon. Behind the great tendon and before the *Foot Taiyin* meridian lies the *Yīntà* meridian’s station, the *Xìn* (信) point, two *cùn* above the inner ankle, before the *Foot Shaoyin* meridian and behind the *Foot Taiyin* meridian, between the *tendon and bone* (筋骨). Needling may penetrate four *fēn* of the *same-body cùn*, held for five breaths. If cauterized, three *zhuàng* are applied. This aligns with the *Zhōnghuà Classics* (《中诰经》).

The *Sànmài* (散脉) meridian causes *lumbago* with heat—severe heat generates agitation. The pain feels as though a horizontal beam lies across the waist, with extreme cases leading to *urinary incontinence* (遗搜).
*Sànmài* is a branch of the *Foot Taiyin* (太阴) meridian, ascending in a *scattered* (散行) manner. Its path follows the inner thigh, entering the abdomen, and converging with the *Foot Shaoyin* (少阴) and *Foot Shaoyang* (少阳) meridians below the *lumbar vertebrae* (腰髁) in the *hollow between bones* (骨空). Thus, the disease manifests as waist pain with a horizontal beam sensation, severe cases leading to *urinary leakage* (遗波). Needling *Sànmài* involves three *sores*—located at the *anterior medial knee* (膝前), between bone and flesh, at the *network’s outer edge* (络外廉), binding the *meridian’s pathway* (束脉).

The *anterior medial knee* refers to the inner side of the knee. *Bone and flesh division* means below the *inner knee collateral bone* (辅骨), where the *knee joint’s upper and lower flesh* (康端肉) separate. *Outer edge of the network* indicates the visible, greenish *Foot Taiyin* meridian network. Below the collateral bone lies a great tendon, which binds the *knee joint* (膝腑) bone, causing them to connect. Needling this tendon-bone junction removes the illness—hence the term *Dìjī* (地机), three needlings suffice.

The *Ròulǐ* (肉里) meridian causes *lumbago*, where coughing is impossible—coughing leads to *tendon contraction and spasm* (筋缩急).
The *Ròulǐ* meridian originates from *Foot Shaoyang* (少阳), thus it is the *Yángwéi* (阳维) meridian-*qi*’s manifestation. *Li* (里) means *within* (裹). Needling the *Ròulǐ* meridian creates two *sores*—located outside the *Foot Taiyang* meridian, behind the *absolute bone* (绝骨) of the *Foot Shaoyang* meridian.

The *Fēnròu* (分肉) meridian point is the primary treatment.

One [classic] text states that *Foot Shaoyang* (少阳) before the *absolute bone* (绝骨) is a transcription error. Before the *absolute bone*, the *Foot Shaoyang* meridian runs. After the *absolute bone*, the *Yangwei* (阳维) meridian passes. Hence, it is said that the point lies outside the *Foot Taiyang* (太阳) meridian, behind the *absolute bone* of the *Foot Shaoyang* meridian.

The *Fēnròu* (分肉) point is located directly above the lateral malleolus on the outer side of the leg, at the junction of the two *tendons and muscles* (筋肉) two *cun* (分) from the *same-body inch* (同身寸) mark, where the *Yangwei* meridian-*qi* manifests. Needling can penetrate three *cun* into the *same-body inch*, with retention for ten breaths. If cauterized (*jiǔ*), three *strong applications* (壮) suffice.

**Newly Corrected Version** states: According to the *Fēnròu* point’s location, the *Jia-Yi Jing* (《甲乙经》) does not record it. It appears in the *Qi Xue* (《气穴》) annotations with differing measurements—*Qi Xue* marks two *cun* (分) as three *cun* (分), five *cun* (分) as three *cun* (分), and ten breaths as seven breaths.

For *lumbago* (腰痛) radiating along the spine (*jiǎ* 胁) to the head, with a sensation of heaviness (*chén* 沉), eyes fixed and rigid (*kàng* 吭吭), and inability to turn the head—needle the *Foot Taiyang* (太阳) meridian at *Wěizhōng* (委中), causing bleeding. *Wěizhōng* is *Weizhong* (委中).

**Newly Corrected Version** states: According to *Tài Sù* (《太素》), it should read "head feels heavy and dull (*chén chén rán* 沉沉然)."

For *lumbago* with upper *coldness* (上寒), needle the *Foot Taiyang* and *Yangming* (阳明) meridians;
for upper *heat* (上热), needle the *Foot Jueyin* (厥阴) meridian;
if unable to bend or bow (*fǔ yǎng* 俯仰), needle the *Foot Shaoyang* (少阳) meridian;
for *central heat* (中热) with *shortness of breath* (喘), needle the *Foot Shaoyin* (少阴) meridian at *Yóuzhōng* (邮中), causing bleeding.

This method is profound and mysterious (*Xuán Miào* 玄妙); the *Zhōng Gào* (《中诰》) differs, and its principles cannot be fully grasped. One should apply it with understanding of its effects (*yìng* 应). Otherwise, first disperse the *meridian networks* (血络) and then regulate (*tiáo* 调).

For *lumbago* with upper *coldness* (上寒) where turning the head is impossible (*bùkě gù* 不可顾), needle the *Foot Yangming* (阳明) meridian.
If unable to turn the head (*bùkě gù*), the *Sānlǐ* (三里) point is primary.
*Sānlǐ* is located three *cun* below the knee on the *same-body inch* (同身寸), between the two *tendons and muscles* (廉两筋肉) of the meridian, where the *Foot Yangming* meridian-*qi* enters. Needling can penetrate three *cun* into the *same-body inch*, with retention for seven breaths. If cauterized (*jiǔ*), three *strong applications* (壮) suffice.

For upper *heat* (上热), needle the *Foot Taiyin* (太阴) meridian.
The *Dìjī* (地机) point is primary.
*Dìjī* is located five *cun* below the knee on the *same-body inch*, the *Yóu* (邮) point of the *Foot Taiyin* meridian. Needling can penetrate three *cun* into the *same-body inch*; if cauterized (*jiǔ*), three *strong applications* (壮) suffice.

**Newly Corrected Version** states: According to the *Jia-Yi Jing* (《甲乙经》), it should be five *strong applications* (壮).

For *central heat* (中热) with *shortness of breath* (喘), needle the *Foot Shaoyin* (少阴) meridian.
The *Yǒngquán* (涌泉) and *Tàizhōng* (太钟) points are all primary.
*Yǒngquán* is located in the depression of the sole (*足心陷者*), when the foot is flexed and toes curled, where the *Foot Shaoyin* meridian emerges. Needling can penetrate three *cun* into the *same-body inch*, with retention for three breaths. If cauterized (*jiǔ*), three *strong applications* (壮) suffice.
*Tàizhōng* is located in the pulsating artery behind the heel (*足跟后街中动脉*), the *meridian network* (络) of the *Foot Shaoyin* meridian. Needling can penetrate two *cun* into the *same-body inch*, with retention for seven breaths. If cauterized (*jiǔ*), three *strong applications* (壮) suffice.

**Newly Corrected Version** states: According to the *Cì Nüè* (《刺疟》) annotation, *Dàzhōng* (大钟) is located behind the medial malleolus (*内踝后街中*); the *Shuǐ Xué Lùn* (《水穴论》) annotation places it behind the medial malleolus (*内踝后*). This annotation places it behind the heel’s artery (*跟后街中动脉*), differing across three sources. The *Jia-Yi Jing* (《甲乙经》) also states it is in the depression behind the heel (*跟后冲中*), and this should be considered the correct version.

For difficult defecation (*dà biàn nán* 大便难), needle the *Foot Shaoyin* meridian.
The *Yǒngquán* (涌泉) point is primary.

For *lower abdominal fullness* (少腹满), needle the *Foot Jueyin* meridian.
The *Tàichōng* (太冲) point is primary.
Located two *cun* (寸) behind the big toe’s joint (*足大指本节后*) on the inner side, in the depression where the pulse responds to pressure (*同身寸之二寸馅者中*), it is where the *Foot Jueyin* meridian-*qi* converges. Needling can penetrate three *cun* into the *same-body inch*, with retention for ten breaths. If cauterized (*jiǔ*), three *strong applications* (壮) suffice.

If [the condition] resembles *vertebral fracture* (如折), where bending or bowing is impossible (*bùkě fǔ yǎng* 不可俯仰), and lifting is impossible (*bùkě jǔ* 不可举)—
needle the *Foot Taiyang* (太阳) meridian for [the latter].
For *vertebral fracture* (如折), the *Shùgǔ* (束骨) point is primary.
If unable to bend or bow (*bùkě fǔ yǎng* 不可俯仰), the *Jīnggǔ* (京骨) and *Kūnlún* (昆仑) points are all primary.
If unable to lift (*bùkě jǔ* 不可举), the *Shēnmài* (申脉), *Pū Cān* (仆参), and *Cǎnshēn* (参) points are all primary.

*Shùgǔ* (束骨) is located on the outer side of the little toe’s joint (*足小指外侧本节后*), in the depression between red and white flesh (*赤白肉际陷者中*), where the *Foot Taiyang* meridian converges. Needling can penetrate three *cun* into the *same-body inch*, with retention for three breaths. If cauterized (*jiǔ*), three *strong applications* (壮) suffice.

*Jīnggǔ* (京骨) is located below the lateral malleolus on the outer side of the leg (*足外侧大骨下*), in the depression between red and white flesh (*赤白肉际陷者中*), where pressure reveals it. It is where the *Foot Taiyang* meridian passes. Needling can penetrate three *cun* into the *same-body inch*, with retention for seven breaths. If cauterized (*jiǔ*), three *strong applications* (壮) suffice.

*Kūnlún* (昆仑) is located behind the lateral malleolus (*足外踝后*), in the depression above the heel bone (*跟骨上陷者中*), where fine pulses respond to pressure (*细脉动应手*). It is where the *Foot Taiyang* meridian runs. Needling can penetrate five *cun* into the *same-body inch*, with retention for ten breaths. If cauterized (*jiǔ*), three *strong applications* (壮) suffice.

*Shēnmài* (申脉) is located five *cun* below the lateral malleolus (*外踝下同身寸之五分*), within the space of a fingernail (*容爪甲*), where the *Yang Tà* (阳踏) meridian-*qi* manifests. Needling can penetrate six *cun* into the *same-body inch*, with retention for ten breaths. If cauterized (*jiǔ*), three *strong applications* (壮) suffice.

**Newly Corrected Version** states: According to the *Jia-Yi Jing* (《甲乙经》), *Shēnmài* (申脉) is located in the depression below the lateral malleolus (*外踝下陷者中*), without the "five *cun*" (五分) specification. The "six *cun*" (六分) penetration should be corrected to "three *cun*" (三分), and "ten breaths" (十呼) retention to "six breaths" (六呼). The *Qi Xue* (《气穴》) annotation records seven breaths (七呼).

*Pū Cān* (仆参) is located in the depression below the heel bone (*跟骨下陷者中*), where the *Foot Taiyang* and *Yang Tà* (阳踏) meridians converge. Needling can penetrate three *cun* into the *same-body inch*, with retention for seven breaths. If cauterized (*jiǔ*), three *strong applications* (壮) suffice.

**Newly Corrected Version** states: According to the *Jia-Yi Jing* (《甲乙经》), *Pū Cān* (仆参) retention should be six breaths (六呼).

For *drawing the spine inward* (引脊内廉), needle the *Foot Shaoyin* meridian.
The *Fùliù* (复溜) point is primary.
Use the *Fēiyáng* (飞阳) annotation from the *#16* text.

From the section on *lumbago* with upper *coldness* (上寒) where turning the head is impossible (*不可顾*) to this point, the annotations and red-marked corrections are all merged.

**Newly Corrected Version** states: According to the original text of Quán Yuánqǐ (全元起) and the *Jia-Yi Jing* (《甲乙经》), along with *Tài Sù* (《太素》), none of the passages from *lumbago* with upper *coldness* (上寒) to this point exist. These were additions by the *Wáng* (王) lineage.

「Now the annotations state that from the section on *lumbago* with upper *coldness* (腰痛上寒) to the point where the red-marked corrections are merged (并合朱书), the nineteen characters are not from *Wang Bing* (王冰); rather, they were added by later scholars.

For *lumbago* (腰痛) where the pain draws the *minor abdomen* (少腹) inward and restricts the *sā* (纱, *sà*—"sash/band"), the patient cannot lie back (*cannot look upward* 不可以仰). **Newly Corrected Version** states: According to the *Jia-Yi Jing* (《甲乙经》), it should read *cannot look upward and downward* (不可以俯仰). *Sā* (纱) is pronounced *sāo* (抄).

When needling the *Lumbar Spine-Sacrum Junction* (腰尸交) point, the swelling (髁肿) occurs just above the two *iliac crests* (髁). The number of *boils* (疮) depends on the *lunar phases of waxing and waning* (月生死). Inserting the needle immediately resolves the issue (发针立已). This *pathogenic factor* (邪) lodges in the *Foot Taiyin* (足太阴) *network vessels* (络). *Kòng* (控) is interchangeable with *yǐn* (引). *Sāo* (炒) refers to the soft, hollow space beneath the *lower lateral ribs* (季胁下).

The *Lumbar Spine-Sacrum Junction* (腰尸交) point is located in the hollow beneath the two *iliac crests* (髁), where the *sacrum* (尸骨) lies with four *lumbar vertebrae* (四骨) on either side, totaling eight *hollows* (穴), commonly called the *Eight Adhesive Bones* (八胶骨). For this *lumbago* (腰痛), one selects the fourth *lumbar vertebra* (髅) below the *iliac crest* (髁), which is the *Lower Sacral Hollow* (下髅穴). The *Foot Taiyin*, *Jueyin*, and *Shaoyang* meridians (足太阴厥阴少阳) intersect at this point on both sides, hence the name *Lumbar Spine-Sacrum Junction* (腰尸交).

The swelling (髁肿) refers to the *iliac crests* (髁骨) below, where firm, raised flesh appears on both sides. This swelling is angled toward the posterior of the *iliac crests* (髁骨), with the inner aspect resting upon them, hence the term *two iliac crests swell* (两髁肿). Beneath the swelling of the *iliac crests* (髁), there are two hollows (肿) on either side, each with four *lumbar vertebrae* (骨空), hence the phrase *upper sacral hollow, middle sacral hollow, lower sacral hollow* (上髅次髅中胶下髅). The first three hollows (上髅) are slightly lower than the *iliac crests* (髁骨); pressing them reveals the hollows (陷中). All four hollows govern *lumbago* (腰痛), but the *Lower Sacral Hollow* (下髅) is specifically mentioned, aligning with the text and the intersection of the *Taiyin*, *Jueyin*, and *Shaoyang* meridians.

The needle may be inserted to a depth of three *cùn* (寸) of the same body length, retained for ten breaths (留十呼). If *moxibustion* (灸) is used, three *strong applications* (壮) suffice.

The principle of *lunar phases of waxing and waning* (月生死) for determining the number of *boils* (瘠) is as follows: the beginning of the lunar cycle toward fullness is *lunar waxing* (月生), and the midpoint toward emptiness is *lunar waning* (月死). Fewer *boils* (瘠) are treated during the *lunar waning* phase (死月), while more are treated during the *lunar waxing* phase (生月). The *Miǔ Cì Lùn* (《缪刺论》) states: On the first day of the *lunar waxing* phase, one *boil* (瘠) is treated; on the second day, two *boils*; gradually increasing, until the fifteenth day, fifteen *boils* are treated. On the sixteenth day, fourteen *boils* are treated, gradually decreasing. Thus, the number of *boils* to be treated is determined by this principle.

*Kòu* (髁) is pronounced *kǔ wǎ qiè* (苦瓦切). *Jiāo* (胶) is pronounced *liáo* (辽). The left side is treated on the right, and the right side is treated on the left. If the pain is on the left, the needle is applied to the right, and vice versa. This is because the meridians intersect at the *sacrum* (尸骨) on both sides.

**Newly Corrected Version** states: Upon closer examination, this section on *lumbago* (腰痛) drawing the *minor abdomen* inward (引少腹) overlaps with the *Miǔ Cì Lùn* (《缪刺论》).

**Section on Wind Pathology (风论篇):**

The Yellow Emperor asked: When *wind* (风) harms a person, it may cause *cold-heat alternation* (寒热), *internal heat* (热中), *internal cold* (寒中), *malignant wind* (疠风), *hemiplegia* (偏枯), or simply *wind* (风). The diseases vary, and their names differ. Sometimes the pathogenic factor reaches the *Five Zang* (五藏) and *Six Fu* (六府), yet their resolution remains unclear. I wish to hear your explanation.

*Injury* (伤) refers to the pathogenic factor entering and affecting the person. *Qī Bó* replied: *Wind-qi* (风气) resides between the *skin* (皮) and *flesh* (肤), unable to penetrate inward or escape outward. When the *defensive mechanism* (胜理) is weakened and *pores* (开疏) are unguarded, *wind* (邪风) enters. Once the *wind-qi* (风气) has entered, the *Mysterious Orifices* (玄府) close and seal, preventing inward penetration and outward escape.

*Wind* (风) is characterized by frequent movement and rapid changes. When the *defensive mechanism* (胜理) is weakened and *pores* (开) are unguarded, the patient feels *dispersed cold* (洒然寒); when the *defensive mechanism* is strong and *pores* (闭) are sealed, the patient feels *stifled heat* (热而闷).

*Dispersed cold* (洒然) describes a chilly sensation. *Unsmooth* (问) indicates a stifling feeling. When the *defensive mechanism* (胜理) is weakened and *pores* (开) are unguarded, *wind-qi* (风) drifts and scatters, causing *cold* (寒). When the *defensive mechanism* (胜理) is strong and *pores* (闭) are sealed, *wind-qi* (风) becomes chaotic and confined, causing *stifling heat* (问).

When *cold* (寒) prevails, it impairs *appetite* (食饮) and weakens digestion. When *heat* (热) prevails, it consumes *muscle tissue* (肌肉), causing the patient to shiver and lose the ability to eat, a condition known as *cold-heat alternation* (寒热). *Cold wind* (寒风) enters the *stomach* (胃), impairing digestion and causing loss of appetite. *Heat-qi* (热气) lodges internally, consuming *muscle tissue* (肌肉). When *cold* and *heat* combine, the patient shivers violently and cannot eat, hence the term *cold-heat alternation* (寒热). *Shiver violently* (佚栗) describes sudden, chilling tremors.

**Newly Corrected Version** states: Upon closer examination, *shiver violently* (佚栗) is rendered as *loss of taste* (失味) in the original text of *Quán Yuánqǐ* (全元起) and as *dissolve and mimic* (解仿) in the *Jia-Yi Jing* (《甲乙经》).

---
When *wind-qi* (风气) and the *Yangming* meridian (阳明) enter the *stomach* (胃), they ascend along the meridian path to the *inner canthus* (目内毗). In a *plump* (肥) individual, *wind-qi* (风) cannot escape outward, resulting in *internal heat* (热中) with *yellow sclera* (目黄). In a *lean* (瘦) individual, *wind-qi* (风) disperses outward, causing *internal cold* (寒中) with *nasal discharge* (泣出).

The *Yangming* meridian (阳明) is the *Stomach* meridian (胃脉), which begins at the *nose* (鼻), passes through the *upper lip* (上齿中), and descends along the outer side of the nose to the center of the upper teeth. It then emerges beside the mouth, encircles the lips, descends to meet the *Chéngjiāng* (承浆) point, and ascends along the *mandible* (颐) to the *posterior molar region* (后下康). It follows the throat and enters the *suprasternal fossa* (缺盆), descends to the *epigastric region* (鬲), and connects with the *stomach* (属胃). Thus, it is said that *wind-qi* (风气) and the *Yangming* meridian (阳明) enter the *stomach* (胃), ascending along the meridian path to the *inner canthus* (目内毗).

In *plump* (肥) individuals, the *pores* (腆理) are dense and tightly sealed, preventing *wind-qi* (风) from escaping, leading to *internal heat* (热中) with *yellow sclera* (目黄). In *lean* (瘦) individuals, the *defensive mechanism* (胜理) is weakened and *pores* (开疏) are unguarded, allowing *wind-qi* (风) to disperse outward, resulting in *internal cold* (寒中) with *nasal discharge* (泣出).

---
When *wind-qi* (风气) enters alongside the *Taiyang* meridian (太阳), it travels through the *meridian junctions* (脉俞) and disperses between the *muscle layers* (分肉), interacting with the *Wei-qi* (卫气). If the passage of *Wei-qi* (卫气) is obstructed, the *muscle tissue* (肌肉) becomes *tender and swollen* (愤腹), forming *boils* (疡). When *Wei-qi* (卫气) is obstructed and stagnant, the affected *muscle tissue* (肉) loses sensation (*cannot feel* 不仁).

Between the *muscle layers* (肉分), where *Wei-qi* (卫气) circulates, *wind* (风) and *Wei-qi* (卫气) clash and move together through these layers. Thus, the *pathway of the qi* (气道) becomes *rough and sluggish* (涩), obstructing its flow. When the *pathway of the qi* (气道) is obstructed, *wind-qi* (风气) attacks internally, and *Wei-qi* (卫气) resists, causing the *muscle tissue* (肉) to become *tender and swollen* (愤镇) and *boils* (疮) to appear.

*Boils* (疡) are another term for *sores* (疮). If *Wei-qi* (卫气) is *blown by the wind* (被风吹), it cannot circulate freely. Where it stagnates, the *muscle tissue* (肉) loses sensation (*cannot feel* 不仁).

**Not feeling (不仁)** refers to numbness where one cannot sense cold, heat, pain, or itching.

**Lues (疠)** occurs when *Nourishing-qi* (荣) and *Wei-qi* (卫) generate heat, their *qi* becoming turbid. Thus, the nasal septum collapses and complexion darkens, while the skin ulcerates and festers—this is when *wind* (风) enters the *meridians* (经脉).

*Nourishing-qi* (荣) flows within the *meridians*, so when *wind* (风) enters the *meridians*, it attacks the *blood* (血) internally, merging with *Nourishing-qi* (荣). Their union generates heat, causing the *blood* (血) to stagnate and decay. When their *qi* is turbid, it signifies *ulceration and disarray* (溃乱).

Indeed, when *blood vessels* (血脉) are disordered and *Nourishing-qi* (荣) carries *wind* (风), the *yang meridians* (阳脉) ascend entirely to the head. The nose, being the passage for inhalation and exhalation, thus collapses and darkens in hue, while the skin ruptures and festers.

*The Pulse Classic’s Essentials* states: *"When *wind* (风) flourishes in the *pulse* (脉), it becomes **lues** (疠)."*
*Fester* (溃) is pronounced *hu* (胡) with a cutting tone.

When *wind-cold* (风寒) lodges in the *meridians* (脉) and does not disperse, it is called **lues-wind** (疠风), or **cold-heat** (寒热). Initially, it manifests as **cold-heat**; when the heat solidifies, it becomes **lues-wind** (疠风).

---
**New Annotation:** According to another text, *"flourishes"* (盛) is sometimes written as *"becomes"* (成).

In spring (甲乙), when *wood* (木) is injured by *wind* (风), it becomes **liver-wind** (肝风); in summer (丙丁), when *fire* (火) is injured by *wind* (风), it becomes **heart-wind** (心风); in late summer (戊己), when *earth* (土) is injured by *evil* (邪), it becomes **spleen-wind** (脾风); in autumn (庚辛), when *metal* (金) is struck by *evil* (邪), it becomes **lung-wind** (肺风); in winter (壬癸), when *water* (水) is struck by *evil* (邪), it becomes **kidney-wind** (肾风).

Spring (甲乙) corresponds to *wood* (木), governed by the *liver* (肝);
Summer (丙丁) corresponds to *fire* (火), governed by the *heart* (心);
Late summer (戊己) corresponds to *earth* (土), governed by the *spleen* (脾);
Autumn (庚辛) corresponds to *metal* (金), governed by the *lung* (肺);
Winter (壬癸) corresponds to *water* (水), governed by the *kidney* (肾).

When *wind* (风) invades the *acupuncture points* (俞) of the five *zang* organs and six *fu* organs, it becomes **organ-wind** (藏府之风). If it enters through the respective *gateways* (门户) of each organ, it becomes **partial-wind** (偏风).

If *wind* (风) deviates left or right along its *pathway* (俞), it becomes **partial-wind** (偏风).

When *wind-qi* (风气) ascends through the *Wind Palace* (风府), it becomes **brain-wind** (脑风).
The *Wind Palace* (风府) is an acupuncture point located one *cun* inside the large tendon at the nape’s hairline, where the *Governor Vessel* (督脉) and *Yang Linking Vessel* (阳维) converge. Ascending from the *Wind Palace* (风府) leads to the *Brain’s Gate* (脑户), which is the convergence of the *Governor Vessel* (督脉) and the *Foot Taiyang Meridian* (足太阳).

Thus, ascending through the *Wind Palace* (风府) results in **brain-wind** (脑风).
The *Foot Taiyang Meridian* (足太阳) originates at the inner canthus, ascends the forehead to the crown, enters to network the brain, then exits. Hence, when *wind* (风) invades and binds the head, it becomes **eye-wind** (目风), causing **cold eyes** (眼寒).

Drinking alcohol and encountering *wind* (风) results in **leak-wind** (漏风).
When *heat* (热) is excessive and *dispersal* (疏) is insufficient, *wind* (风) invades, causing profuse sweating like a leak—thus, **leak-wind** (漏风). The *Classic* also names it **alcohol-wind** (酒风).

After sexual activity, when sweating and encountering *wind* (风), it becomes **internal-wind** (内风).
It consumes *essence* (精) internally and weakens the *pores* (胜理) externally. When *internal-wind* (内风) strikes, it is called **internal-wind** (内风). The *Classic* also names it **labor-wind** (劳风).

Encountering *wind* (风) after a fresh hairwash results in **head-wind** (首风).
When *wind* (风) lodges in the head after washing hair, it is called **head-wind** (首风).

When *wind* (风) lingers long within, it becomes **intestinal-wind** (肠风), causing **diarrhea** (餐泄).
*Wind* (风) in the intestines ascends to the stomach, so food fails to digest and is expelled. **Diarrhea** (泄) refers to undigested food being passed.

**New Annotation:** According to *Quanyuan Qi* (全元起), *"diarrhea"* (泄) is when *"water and grain are not separated in excretion"* (水谷不分为利).

When *wind* (风) resides in the *pores* (胜理), the *mysterious orifice* (玄府) opens, and *wind* (风) assails the sweat, causing **diarrhea-wind** (泄风).

Thus, *wind* (风) is the **origin of a hundred diseases** (百病之长), and its transformations give rise to other ailments. There is no fixed treatment, yet all stem from *wind-qi* (风气).
*Origin* (长) means *preceding*—it precedes all diseases.

**New Annotation:** According to *Quanyuan Qi* (全元起) and *The Canon of Medicine in Master and Disciple Dialogue* (甲乙经), *"stem"* (致) is sometimes written as *"thus"* (故).

The Emperor asked: *"How do the manifestations of the five *zang* organ *winds* (五藏风) differ? I wish to hear their diagnostic signs and the diseases they produce."*

*Diagnostic signs* (诊) refer to observable symptoms. *Diseases* (能) refer to internal pathological changes.

Gebi replied:

**Lung-wind** (肺风) manifests as excessive sweating, aversion to *wind* (风), a wan and pale complexion, intermittent coughing with shortness of breath. Symptoms worsen in the evening but ease during the day. Diagnosis is confirmed above the eyebrows, where the skin appears pale.

When *wind-qi* (风气) dominates internally, *heat* (热) is excessive. *Heat* (热) opens the *pores* (腆理), causing profuse sweating. *Wind* (风) assails internally, leading to aversion to *wind* (风).

*Wan* (姘) refers to a pale, thin hue. The *lung* (肺) governs *white*, and its dysfunction manifests as coughing—*wind* (风) internally presses, causing the complexion to appear pale and thin, with intermittent coughing and shortness of breath.

During the day, *yang-qi* (阳气) is at the surface, so symptoms ease. In the evening, *yang-qi* (阳气) withdraws inward, and internal *wind* (风) responds, worsening symptoms.

Above the eyebrows refers to the region between them, the *orbital cavity* (阙庭), which externally governs the *lung* (肺). Thus, diagnosis is confirmed there. *Pale* (白) is the color of the *lung* (肺).

**Heart-wind** (心风) manifests as excessive sweating, aversion to *wind* (风), dry and cracked lips, irritability, and a flushed complexion. Severe cases result in incoherent speech. Diagnosis is confirmed at the mouth, where the lips appear red.

*Dry and cracked* (焦绝) means the lips are parched and their texture is disrupted—this occurs because *heat* (热) causes the skin to peel.

**Wind in the Heart**
When *wind* (风) assails the Heart, the spirit is disordered—thus, the patient is prone to rage and frightens others.
The Heart’s divergent pulse branches from the Heart’s system, ascending beside the throat, governing speech that becomes incoherent. The lips turn red—red being the Heart’s color.

*[New annotation:]* The *Jia-Yi Jing* (《甲乙经》) lacks the character *frightens* (吓).

**Liver-Wind**
Liver-*wind* (肝风) manifests as excessive sweating, aversion to *wind* (风), melancholy with a faintly bluish hue, dry throat, and irritability. At its worst, the patient loathes women. Diagnosis is confirmed beneath the eyes, where the color appears green.

Liver disease stems from the Heart’s *藏* (藏) failing to nourish it, leaving *Heart-qi* (心气) deficient—hence the melancholy. The Liver corresponds to wood, whose color is green, so the hue is faintly green.

The Liver’s *caon* (咏) vessel travels along the inner thigh, entering the *mào* (髦) region, encircling the genitals, reaching the lower abdomen beside the stomach, connecting to the Liver and Gallbladder, ascending through the *lì* (鬲), spreading across the ribs, following the throat’s posterior, entering the occiput, and emerging at the forehead to converge with the *Du* (督) pulse at the crown. Its divergent branch descends from the eye’s system.

Thus, the throat becomes dry, the patient is prone to rage, and they loathe women. Diagnosis is confirmed beneath the eyes—green, the Liver’s color.

**Spleen-Wind**
Spleen-*wind* (脾风) presents as excessive sweating, aversion to *wind* (风), bodily lassitude, reluctance to move the limbs, a faintly yellowish pallor, and loss of appetite. Diagnosis is confirmed above the nose, where the color appears yellow.

The Spleen’s pulse arises at the inner ankle, ascending along the shinbone, then up the inner thigh’s anterior edge, entering the abdomen to connect with the Spleen and network with the Stomach, rising through the *lì* (鬲) beside the throat, linking to the tongue’s root, and dispersing beneath the tongue. Its divergent branch returns to the Stomach, branching upward through the *lì* to pour into the Heart.

Thus, the body feels weary and the limbs resist movement, while appetite wanes. The Spleen governs the limbs, so Spleen-*wind* leaves them unwilling to move. The Spleen’s *qi* corresponds to earth, central in the body, and the nose occupies the face’s center—hence the diagnosis there. Yellow is the Spleen’s color.

*[New annotation:]* Wang’s commentary states that the phrase *"the Heart’s pulse emerges at the hand"* (心脉出於手) and *"traversing the arm"* (循臂) is superfluous and without merit.

---

**Kidney-Wind**
Kidney-*wind* (肾风) manifests as excessive sweating, aversion to *wind* (风), a swollen, taut face, back pain preventing upright posture, and a dark hue. The *yīn* (隐) region is dysfunctional. Diagnosis is confirmed on the skin’s surface, where the color appears black.

*[Afflicted,]* meaning swollen and raised. Black is the Kidney’s color.
The Kidney is the *yin* (阴) *藏* (藏). The area beneath the eyes is also *yin*—thus, when the Kidney’s *藏* is assailed by *wind*, the face becomes taut and swollen.

The Kidney’s pulse arises beneath the foot, ascending along the inner calf, exiting the inner hamstring’s hollow, climbing the inner thigh’s posterior edge, and piercing the spine—hence the back pain preventing upright posture. The *yīn* (隐) region refers to the concealed, convoluted areas. The Kidney stores *jing* (精), externally manifesting in sexual function; now, as the *藏* is invaded by *wind*, *jing-qi* weakens internally, impairing the convoluted functions. As the *Yin-Yang Application Symbols Grand Treatise* (《阴阳应象大论》) states: *"Qi returns to *jing*; *jing* consumes *qi*."* With *jing* deficient, *qi* turns inward to nourish it, failing to nourish the skin—thus, the surface darkens. Black is the Kidney’s color.

---

**Stomach-Wind**
Stomach-*wind* (胃风) presents as excessive neck sweating, aversion to *wind* (风), inability to swallow food or drink, *lì* (鬲) obstruction, constant abdominal fullness, and—upon exposure—abdominal distension. Consuming cold foods causes diarrhea. Diagnosis reveals a gaunt frame with a distended abdomen.

The Stomach’s divergent pulse branches from behind the jaw, descending the neck’s hollow, passing the *rèn yíng* (人迎), following the throat, entering the *quē pén* (缺盆), descending the *lì* (鬲) to connect with the Stomach and network with the Spleen. Its direct course descends from the *quē pén* along the inner breastbone, entering the *qí jiē* (气街). Its divergent branch arises from the Stomach’s lower orifice, encircling the abdomen to meet at the *qí jiē*.

Thus, the neck sweats excessively, food and drink fail to descend, the *lì* (鬲) is obstructed, and the abdomen remains full. Exposure to cold causes external chill and internal heat, resulting in abdominal membrane distension. Consuming cold provokes cold to assail the Stomach, preventing *yang* from internally dissipating—hence the diarrhea. The Stomach corresponds to the Spleen and governs flesh; Stomach-*qi* deficiency leaves flesh undeveloped—hence the gauntness. Accumulated *wind-qi* in the Stomach causes abdominal distension.

*[New annotation:]* Sun Simiao states: *"Freshly consumed food attracts *wind*, becoming Stomach-*wind*."*

---

**Head-Wind**
Head-*wind* (首风) presents as excessive sweating and aversion to *wind* (风) on the head and face. Symptoms worsen the day before the *wind* arrives and improve on the *wind*’s day. The head is the convergence of all *yang*—when *wind* invades, the scalp’s texture loosens, causing profuse sweating.

Humans’ *yang-qi* externally aligns with *wind*—thus, symptoms peak the day before the *wind* arrives. As the *wind*’s severity precedes its arrival, the body weakens in advance; hence, symptoms ease on the *wind*’s day.

**Indoor Wind**
Indoor Wind (内) refers to *wind* within the dwelling. One cannot leave the dwelling because the headache is severe and one dislikes external *wind*.

*[New annotation:]* Sun Simiao states: *"Freshly bathed, one attracts *wind*, becoming Indoor Wind."*

**Leak Wind**
Leak Wind (漏风) manifests as excessive sweating, an inability to wear light clothing, sweating upon eating, and in severe cases, body-wide sweating, shortness of breath, aversion to *wind*, dampened garments, dry mouth with intense thirst, and an inability to engage in labor. The *wind*-heat in the lungs and stomach prevents wearing light clothing. The skin’s pores are overly open, so eating induces sweating. When severe, *wind* invades the lungs, causing body-wide sweating, shortness of breath, aversion to *wind*, dampened garments, dry mouth, and intense thirst. Physical exertion worsens the breathlessness, hence the inability to labor.

*[New annotation:]* Sun Simiao states: *"Drunkenness attracts *wind*, becoming Leak Wind. Its symptoms include aversion to *wind*, excessive sweating, weak breath, dry mouth, intense thirst, heat in the body when near clothing, and profuse sweating like rain before eating. The limbs feel lax and unwilling to exert themselves."*

**Discharge Wind**
Discharge Wind (泄风) presents as excessive sweating, sweat soaking through clothing, dry mouth, dampness on the skin as if waterlogged, and an inability to labor due to *wind*. The body aches entirely, then becomes cold. Dampness on the skin refers to the skin’s moisture resembling water seepage, caused by excessive sweating. Excessive sweating depletes bodily fluids, hence the dry mouth. Physical exertion worsens sweating, so labor is impossible. The entire body aches because excessive sweating depletes *yang-qi*, leading to coldness.

*[New annotation:]* Sun Simiao states: *"Freshly engaged in sexual activity attracts *wind*, becoming Indoor Wind. Its symptoms include aversion to *wind* and sweat soaking garments. It is suspected that this Discharge Wind is actually Indoor Wind. According to the earlier text of this treatise, Indoor Wind and Leak Wind were first mentioned, followed by Intestinal Wind (入中) as internal, and Discharge Wind (泄风) as external. Now, there is Discharge Wind but no Indoor Wind, yet Sun Simiao records Indoor Wind as the state of this Discharge Wind. Thus, it is known that the character *泄* (Discharge) is a mistake for *内* (Indoor)."*

**Chapter on *Bi* (Atrophy/Stagnation) Disorders**

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How does *bi* arise? What—how—does it come to be?"*
(Meaning: *"By what means does it develop?"*)

Gebi replied: *"When the three *qi*—wind, cold, and dampness—converge together, they coalesce to form *bi*. Though they unite to create *bi*, their manifestations differ when they manifest. When the wind-*qi* predominates, it becomes *xíng-bi* (migratory atrophy); when cold-*qi* predominates, it becomes *tòng-bi* (painful atrophy); when dampness-*qi* predominates, it becomes *zhuó-bi* (fixed atrophy). Wind affects the yang, so it produces migratory *bi*. Cold affects the yin, so it produces painful *bi*. Dampness affects the skin, flesh, sinews, and vessels, so it produces fixed *bi* that does not disperse. Thus, *bi* arises from the convergence of wind, cold, and dampness."*

The Emperor said: *"But there are five types—how so? Though wind, cold, and dampness differ, why do the three *bi* disorders manifest in five forms? Which *qi* predominates?"*

Gebi replied: *"If one encounters these *qi* in winter, it becomes *bone-bi*; in spring, *sinew-bi*; in summer, *vessel-bi*; in the *Great Yin* months, *muscle-bi*; in autumn, *skin-bi*. Winter governs bone, spring governs sinews, summer governs vessels, autumn governs skin, and the *Great Yin* months govern muscle and flesh—thus each gives rise to its respective *bi*."*

*The Great Yin* refers to the *wu-ji* (Steel-Horse) and *ji* (Snake) months, as well as the three months when the *Earth* phase is hosted.

The Emperor said: *"When *bi* lodges internally in the five *zàng* (viscera) and six *fǔ* (bowels), which *qi* causes this? Though skin, flesh, sinews, bones, and vessels are affected by *bi* from external seasonal influences, how does it then reside within the viscera and bowels?"*

Gebi replied: *"Each of the five *zàng* has its paired organ. When *bi* persists and does not resolve, it lodges internally in their corresponding pairings. The liver pairs with sinews—if *bi* persists, it lodges in the liver. The heart pairs with vessels—if *bi* persists, it lodges in the heart. The spleen pairs with flesh—if *bi* persists, it lodges in the spleen. The lungs pair with skin—if *bi* persists, it lodges in the lungs. The kidneys pair with bone—if *bi* persists, it lodges in the kidneys. Thus, when *bi* does not abate and one is repeatedly exposed to pathogenic wind, cold, or dampness, it enters the viscera. The term *time* refers to the months when each *zàng* reigns supreme: the liver in spring, the heart in summer, the lungs in autumn, the kidneys in winter, and the spleen in the four seasonal months. *Sensing* means *resonance*—when pathogenic *qi* aligns with the ruling *zàng* of that month."*

For *bi* that invades the five *zàng*:
- *Lung-bi*: causes distress, fullness, dyspnea, and vomiting. The lung-*qi* resonates with breathing, and since its vessels circulate through the stomach, it produces distress, fullness, dyspnea, and vomiting.
- *Heart-bi*: the vessels are obstructed. When distressed, the region below the heart feels taut; sudden shortness of breath arises, the throat feels parched, frequent sighing occurs, and when the *jue*-*qi* ascends, terror ensues. The heart pairs with vessels—when pathogenic *qi* invades, the vessels become obstructed. Internal disturbance by the pathogen causes distress. The *Hand-Jin* (Pericardium) vessel, which governs the heart’s outer layer, arises in the chest, ascends to the pericardium, and descends to the *ge* (esophagus). The *Hand-Shao-Yin* (Heart) vessel arises in the heart, ascends to the heart’s system, and descends to the *ge*, entwining the small intestine. Its branch separates upward beside the throat; its direct course returns upward from the heart’s system to the lungs.

「Thus, when distressed, the heart region feels taut and full, sudden shortness of breath arises, and the throat feels parched and dry. The heart governs sighing, and when the region below the heart feels taut and full, sighing occurs as a means of releasing *qi*.

When the *Foot-Jue-Yin* (Kidney) vessel’s *qi* ascends in opposition, invading the heart, terror and dread ensue—this is because the spirit (*shen*) is weak and easily overwhelmed.

*Liver-bi*: at night, one is startled by external disturbances, drinks excessively, and urinates frequently, with sensations drawing upward into the lower abdomen like a woman’s pregnancy. The liver governs fear and fright; its *qi* responds accordingly, hence the startling at midnight. The liver’s vessel courses along the inner thigh, enters the groin, encircles the genitals, reaches the lower abdomen, and runs beside the stomach, connecting to the liver and gallbladder. It ascends through the esophagus (*ge*), spreads across the ribs, and follows the throat’s posterior path, entering the occipital skull. Thus, excessive drinking and frequent urination occur, with sensations drawing upward from the lower abdomen as if in the state of pregnancy (*#2 ren-yin*).

*Kidney-bi*: one is prone to swelling, with the feet becoming cold and numb as if dead, and the spine stiffening as if the head were fixed. The kidneys serve as the stomach’s gate; when this gate is obstructed, the stomach’s *qi* cannot circulate, hence the swelling. "Feet becoming cold and numb as if dead" refers to sudden cramping in the feet. "Spine stiffening as if the head were fixed" refers to the body curling inward. The kidneys’ vessel originates beneath the little toe, ascends diagonally toward the sole, emerges below the *lian-gu* (calcaneal tendon), follows the inner ankle’s posterior path, branches into the heel, and then ascends the inner leg, emerges at the medial popliteal fossa, and runs along the posterior thigh. It pierces the spine and connects to the kidneys, entwining the bladder. Its direct path ascends from the kidneys through the liver and esophagus, entering the lungs—when *qi* is deficient and pathogenic *qi* invades, the vessel cannot stretch and expand. ○*Newly corrected text*: The *lian-gu* (calcaneal tendon) is also written as *lian-gu* (popliteal fossa) in some versions.

*Spleen-bi*: the four limbs feel weak and sluggish, coughing and vomiting phlegm occurs, and severe nasal congestion arises. The spleen, as the sovereign of the earth element, governs the four limbs externally; hence, when obstructed, the limbs feel weak and sluggish. Its vessel originates from the foot, ascending through the knee and thigh to the abdomen, where it connects to the spleen and entwines the stomach. It ascends through the esophagus and runs beside the throat, which is why coughing and vomiting of phlegm occurs. The spleen’s *qi* nourishes the lungs, and the stomach’s connection to the throat is why severe nasal congestion arises.

*Intestinal-bi* (whether large or small intestine): frequent drinking fails to quench thirst, and the *qi* cannot descend to the center, leading to labored breathing and struggle. At times, diarrhea occurs. The large intestine’s vessel enters the *que-pen* (supraclavicular fossa) and entwines the lungs, descending through the esophagus to connect with the large intestine. The small intestine’s vessel also enters the *que-pen* and entwines the heart, following the throat downward through the esophagus to reach the stomach and connect with the small intestine. When the small intestine harbors pathogenic *qi*, the vessel cannot descend through the esophagus, and the intestines cannot transform and transport *qi*, causing the stomach’s *qi* to stagnate and generate heat. Thus, one drinks excessively but cannot swallow or excrete properly. The *yang*-*qi* of the intestines and stomach clashes with pathogenic *qi*, leading to labored breathing. When the *qi* occasionally descends, it results in diarrhea—this is because the intestinal *qi* is not properly transformed.

*Bladder-bi*: pressing the lower abdomen causes internal pain, as if scalded by hot liquid, with urinary retention and a dry, scanty flow. Nasal discharge becomes clear. The bladder stores bodily fluids; its vessel resides within. The lower abdomen is where *guan-yuan* (the "gate of origin") lies, housing the bladder internally. The bladder’s vessel originates from the inner canthus of the eye, ascends to the forehead, intersecting the crown of the head, and enters to entwine the brain. It then descends and branches below the nape, running along the inner shoulder, beside the spine to the waist, and enters the lumbar region, entwining the kidneys and connecting to the bladder. Its branch diverges from the waist, descending through the buttocks and entering the medial popliteal fossa. When the bladder is invaded by wind, cold, or damp *qi*, the bladder’s *Tai-Yang* (Greater Yang) vessel cannot descend to flow into the feet. Thus, pressing the lower abdomen causes internal pain, and the urine becomes scanty and dry as if scalded by hot liquid. When urination becomes retained, the *Tai-Yang* vessel cannot descend, and the *qi* ascends to agitate the brain, producing clear nasal discharge from the nostrils. ○*Newly corrected text*: The original text reads "pressing the *guan-yuan* (gate of origin) causes internal pain" (*an quan-yuan qi ben ben nei tong er zuo wu yu tang*), but the corrected version is unclear.

The *yin*-*qi* (when tranquil) conceals the spirit, but when agitated, it dissipates and perishes. Here, *yin* refers to the five spirits (*zang*). Thus, when it is said that the spirit is concealed or perishes, it means that when a person remains calm and avoids pathogenic *qi*, the spirit’s *qi* remains serene and contained within. However, when a person becomes agitated and exposed to pathogenic *qi*, the spirit is harmed and scattered, with nothing to safeguard its concealment—hence, it perishes. This describes how the five *zang* (viscera) become obstructed by pathogenic *qi*.

When diet and drink are excessive, the intestines and stomach are injured. The *zang* (viscera) are harmed by agitation, while the *fu* (organs) are damaged by improper diet—both result from exceeding their natural limits, leading to invasion by pathogenic *qi*. This explains how the six *fu* (organs) become obstructed by pathogenic *qi*.

When *qi* is disordered by excessive indulgence, leading to labored breathing, *bi* (obstruction) accumulates in the lungs;
When *qi* is disordered by excessive worry and rumination, *bi* accumulates in the heart;
When *qi* is disordered by incontinence (of urine), *bi* accumulates in the kidneys;
When *qi* is disordered by exhaustion and fatigue, *bi* accumulates in the liver;
When *qi* is disordered by muscle atrophy, *bi* accumulates in the spleen.
Here, *disordered qi* (*#5 yin-qi*) refers to *qi* that behaves erratically, entering the respective *zang* (viscera) it governs and forming *bi* (obstruction).

○*Newly corrected text*: The details of how *bi* (obstruction) lodges within the five *zang* (viscera) are described here. The original passage begins in *Yin-Yang Bing-Lun* (Discourse on Yin and Yang Diseases), but this is where Wang Shi (Wang Bing) has relocated it.

If *bi* (obstruction) persists, it will also affect the internal body. When pathogenic *qi* remains on the surface, it is easier to resolve.

The Yellow Emperor asked: *Bi* (obstruction) sometimes leads to death, sometimes to prolonged pain, and sometimes to easy recovery—what are the reasons for these differences?

Gui-Bo (Qi-Bo) replied: When *bi* enters the *zang* (viscera), death ensues; when it lingers in the tendons and bones, pain persists for a long time; when it remains in the skin and muscles, recovery is easier. When *bi* enters the *zang*, death occurs because the spirit (*shen*) departs. When it lingers in the tendons and bones, pain persists because the *qi* is fixed there. When it remains in the skin and muscles, recovery is easier because it is superficial. Thus, the depth or shallowness of the obstruction leads to these differing outcomes.

The Yellow Emperor asked: What happens when *bi* lodges in the six *fu* (organs)?

Gui-Bo replied: This also occurs when pathogenic *qi* resides in the dietary and digestive pathways, making them the root of the illness. Though the four directions have varying climates—warm, cool, high, or low—and different foods possess distinct natures (hard or soft), the fundamental cause of illness remains the same: when dietary habits exceed their natural limits, the six *fu* (organs) are inevitably damaged.»

The *Great Treatise on Yin-Yang Correspondence and Symbols* states: The cold and heat of water and grains, when felt, harm the six *fu* (organs).

**New Annotation** reads: According to *Treatise on Cold Damage*, the nature of foods—whether firm or yielding—also varies, and their nourishing effects and residence differ.

The six *fu* (organs) each have their own *shu* (back transport points). When wind, cold, and damp *qi* invade these *shu*, the dietary and digestive pathways respond accordingly, traveling along the *shu* to lodge in each respective *fu*.

The *shu* of the six *fu* (organs) also refer to the back transport points. The **Gallbladder *shu*** is beside the **10th vertebra**, the **Stomach *shu*** beside the **12th vertebra**, the **Triple Burner *shu*** beside the **13th vertebra**, the **Large Intestine *shu*** beside the **16th vertebra**, the **Small Intestine *shu*** beside the **18th vertebra**, and the **Bladder *shu*** beside the **19th vertebra**. Their exact locations are determined by the length and proportions of the body, each situated one to one and a half *cun* (inches) away from the spine, along the pathway of the **Foot Taiyang (Bladder) meridian**.

**New Annotation** further clarifies: Upon closer examination, the six *fu* back transport points are actually located below their respective vertebrae on both sides. The earlier note mentioning them beside the vertebrae is an omission.

The Yellow Emperor asked: How should one treat *bi* (obstruction) with acupuncture?

Gui-Bo replied: The five *zang* (solid organs) have *shu* (transport points), while the six *fu* (hollow organs) have *he* (convergence points). Following the meridian pathways, each has its own point of manifestation, and by treating their respective excesses, the disease will be resolved.

**New Annotation** states: According to *Jia-Yi Jing* (Systematic Classic of A-B), treatment should be applied according to the specific excess.

The *Liver’s shu* is called **Taichong (Great Rushing)**, the *Heart’s shu* is **Tai Ling (Great Ridge)**, the *Spleen’s shu* is **Tai Bai (Great White)**, the *Lung’s shu* is **Tai Yuan (Great Abyss)**, and the *Kidney’s shu* is **Tai Xi (Great Creek)**—all are where the meridian *qi* converges.

**Taichong** is located two *cun* behind the joint of the big toe on the inner side, where the pulse is felt beneath a depression. **Acupuncture depth:** three *cun* (one *cun* being the patient’s own length), retain the needle for ten breaths; **moxibustion:** three *moxa cones*.

**Tai Ling** is found in the depression between the two tendons on the back of the hand. **Acupuncture depth:** six *cun*, retain for seven breaths; **moxibustion:** three *moxa cones*.

**Tai Bai** is located in the depression below the medial malleolus on the inner side of the foot. **Acupuncture depth:** three *cun*, retain for seven breaths; **moxibustion:** three *moxa cones*.

**Tai Yuan** is in the depression on the back of the hand. **Acupuncture depth:** one *fen* (tenth of a *cun*), retain for two breaths; **moxibustion:** three *moxa cones*.

**Tai Xi** is located in the depression above the heel bone on the inner side of the ankle, where the pulse is felt. **Acupuncture depth:** three *cun*, retain for seven breaths; **moxibustion:** three *moxa cones*.

The **Stomach’s convergence point** is **Sanli (Three Miles)**, the **Gallbladder’s convergence point** is **Yang Ling Quan (Yang Ridge Spring)**, the **Large Intestine’s convergence point** is **Qu Chi (Crooked Pool)**, the **Small Intestine’s convergence point** is **Xiao Hai (Small Sea)**, the **Triple Burner’s convergence point** is **Wei Yang (Abundant Yang)**, and the **Bladder’s convergence point** is **Wei Zhong (Abundant Center)**.

**Sanli** is three *cun* below the knee, between the two tendons of the outer leg. **Acupuncture depth:** one *cun*, retain for ten breaths; **moxibustion:** three *moxa cones*.

**Yang Ling Quan** is one *cun* below the knee, in the depression of the outer leg. **Acupuncture depth:** six *cun*, retain for ten breaths; **moxibustion:** three *moxa cones*.

**Xiao Hai** is located on the inner side of the elbow, five *fen* outside the large bone, found by flexing the elbow. **Acupuncture depth:** two *cun*, retain for seven breaths; **moxibustion:** five *moxa cones*.

**Qu Chi** is located on the outer side of the elbow, in the depression formed when the elbow is flexed. **Acupuncture depth:** five *fen*, retain for seven breaths; **moxibustion:** three *moxa cones*.

**Wei Yang** is found between the two tendons of the inner and outer sides of the Foot Taiyang (Bladder) meridian at the ankle. **Acupuncture depth:** seven *fen*, retain for five breaths; **moxibustion:** three *moxa cones*, applied while flexing and extending the leg.

**Wei Zhong** is located in the depression of the central popliteal fossa, where the pulse is felt. **Acupuncture depth:** five *fen*, retain for seven breaths; **moxibustion:** three *moxa cones*.

**New Annotation** further notes: According to the *Needling Heat* section, **Wei Zhong** is located behind the knee when flexed. The rest align with this.

Thus, the Classics state: Following the meridian pathways, each has its own point of manifestation, and by treating their respective excesses, the disease will be resolved. The term *over* refers to the areas where the meridians pass through.

**New Annotation** clarifies: Upon closer examination, Wang (a scholar) mistakenly identified **Wei Yang** as the Triple Burner’s convergence point. According to *Jia-Yi Jing*, **Wei Yang** is the lower *shu* of the Triple Burner, a branch of the Foot Taiyang meridian. The Triple Burner’s true convergence point lies within the **Tian Jing (Heavenly Well)** acupoint on the Hand Shaoyang (Small Yang) meridian, where the *qi* enters as its convergence.

The six *fu* convergence points, as recorded in the Classics, are all derived from the points where their respective meridians enter, except for the Triple Burner, where Wang’s error stems from his reliance on *Jia-Yi Jing*, which states that the Triple Burner converges at **Wei Yang**. His reasoning diverges from the original text.

Wang further mistakenly claims that the Large Intestine converges at **Ju Xu (Great Emptiness)** and the Small Intestine at **Xia Lian (Lower Edge)**, whereas the correct points are **Qu Chi** and **Xiao Hai**. Thus, it is evident that **Tian Jing** should be regarded as the true convergence point.

The Yellow Emperor asked: Does the *Nourishing (Ying)* and *Defensive (Wei)* *qi* also cause *bi* (obstruction)?

Gui-Bo replied: The *Nourishing (Ying)* *qi* is the refined essence of water and grains, harmonized and regulated within the five *zang* (solid organs) and dispersed throughout the six *fu* (hollow organs), before entering the meridians.

*The Correct Theory* states: Grains enter the Stomach, and the meridian pathways begin their circulation; water enters the meridians, and the blood takes form.

*The Spirit Pivot Classic* further says: The pathway of the *Nourishing (Ying)* *qi* relies on grains for substance, and when grains enter the Stomach, their refined *qi* is transmitted to the Lungs. The purest essence ascends through the meridian channels.

Thus, the refined essence of water and grains combines with the *Nourishing (Ying)* *qi* to circulate within the meridians. Therefore, the meridians run vertically, penetrating the five *zang* (solid organs) and connecting with the six *fu* (hollow organs). The *Nourishing (Ying)* *qi* flows within the meridians, reaching every part of the body.

**New Annotation** notes: Some alternate texts render *实* (substance) as *宝* (treasure).

The *Defensive (Wei)* *qi* is the fierce *qi* of water and grains. Its *qi* is brisk, swift, and slippery, unable to enter the meridians.
*The fierce (Wei)* *qi* refers to the floating and excessive *qi*.
Because of its floating and excessive nature, it is brisk, swift, and slippery, unable to penetrate the meridians.
Thus, it courses through the interstices of the skin and flesh, adheres to the *zang* membranes, and disperses within the chest and abdomen.
*The interstices of the skin and flesh* refer to the regions outside the meridians.
*The zang membranes* refer to the thin membranes between the five *zang* (solid organs).
Because of its floating and excessive nature, it can spread throughout the chest and abdomen, reaching hollow and void areas, and cling to the *zang* membranes, ensuring *qi* circulation is unimpeded.
*Huan* (肓) is pronounced *huang* (荒).

If its flow is obstructed, disease arises; if it follows its natural course, recovery ensues. Since it does not combine with *wind, cold,* or *dampness qi*, it does not manifest as *bi* (痹, numbness/atrophy).

The Yellow Emperor said: *Good.*
*Bi* may present as pain, or no pain, or loss of sensation (*bu ren* 不仁), or cold, or heat, or dryness, or dampness—what are the causes?

The Lord of the Crooked Spruce (岐伯) replied:
When there is pain, it is due to excessive *cold qi*, for *cold* causes pain.
When *wind, cold,* and *dampness qi* lodge between the flesh and skin, pressing and clinging, they form *bi*. If *cold* prevails, they gather and forcefully split the flesh, causing it to tear and thus pain. Therefore, where *cold* prevails, there is pain.

When there is neither pain nor sensation (*bu ren* 不仁), the disease has lingered deep, causing the *Nourishing (Ying)* and *Defensive (Wei)* *qi* to flow sluggishly, and the meridians and collaterals to become intermittently blocked.
*The annotation notes:* According to *The Canon of A and B* (《甲乙经》), *sluggish* (涩) is rendered as *pain* (痛).
*Further annotation:* In *The Canon of A and B*, this passage discusses both *pain* (不痛) and *loss of sensation* (不仁), with the latter emphasizing that *loss of sensation* is a graver condition.
Since the skin and flesh are not nourished, there is *loss of sensation*.
*Loss of sensation* means the skin and flesh are numb, unaware of presence or absence.

When there is *cold*, it is due to deficient *yang qi* and excessive *yin qi*, which aid the disease, hence the *cold*.
Diseases of *bi* originate from *wind, cold,* and *dampness qi*, so *yin qi* exacerbates them.

When there is *heat*, it is due to excessive *yang qi* and deficient *yin qi*, where the pathogenic *qi* overpowers, and *yang* is overwhelmed by *yin*, hence *bi-heat*.
*Encounter* (遭) means to meet or confront.
It means the *yang qi* is confronted by *yin qi*, and since *yin* is insufficient, *heat* arises.
*The annotation notes:* According to *The Canon of A and B*, *encounter* (遭) is rendered as *ride* (乘).

When there is profuse sweating and dampness (*ru* 濡), it is due to severe *dampness*, where *yang qi* is deficient and *yin qi* is excessive. The two *qi* interact, causing sweating and dampness.
*Interaction* (相感) refers to the correspondence between internal and external layers.
The Yellow Emperor said: *Good.*

*The Treatise on Atrophy* (痿论篇)
The Yellow Emperor asked: *Why does atrophy (痿) occur in the five zang?*
*Atrophy* means weakness and lack of strength to move.

The Lord of the Crooked Spruce replied:
The *Lungs* govern the body’s *skin and hair*, the *Heart* governs the body’s *blood vessels and meridians*, the *Liver* governs the body’s *tendons and membranes*.
*The annotation notes:* According to *Quan Yuanqi’s* (全元起) text, *membrane* (膜) refers to the tendons beneath the skin and above the muscles.

The *Spleen* governs the body’s *flesh and muscles*, and the *Kidneys* govern the body’s *bones and marrow*.
Since each organ governs different tissues, atrophy arises in the tissue it governs.

Thus, when the *Lungs* are heated and their leaves (叶) are scorched, the *skin and hair* become hollow and frail, thin and sparse. When touched, they cause *atrophy of the skin and limbs* (痿壁).
*壁 (bi)* means contraction and stiffness, where the feet cannot extend for walking.
When the *Lungs* are heated, the *Kidneys* receive the upward *heat qi*, hence the contraction.

*The annotation notes:* *壁 (bi)* should also be pronounced as *bi* (必).

When the *Heart qi* is heated, the lower meridians reverse and ascend, and the upper meridians become hollow. When hollow, they cause *meridian atrophy*, where the joints are loose and the meridians slacken, unable to bear weight.
When the *Heart* is excessively heated, fire blazes alone, and the fire blazes upward within, causing the *Kidney* meridians—which normally descend—to ascend against their nature, hence the reversal.
When *yin qi* is reversed and ascends, fire descends inward, *yin* rises to block *yang*, and the lower meridians fail to anchor. The *Heart qi* flows through the meridians, causing *meridian atrophy*.

The *Kidneys* control the lower limbs, so the knee and ankle joints feel as if severed, unable to lift or support weight. The meridian tendons slacken and cannot function properly.

When the *Liver qi* is heated, the *gallbladder* leaks, causing bitterness in the mouth and drying of the *tendon membranes*. When the *tendon membranes* are dry, the tendons become stiff and contracted, manifesting as *tendon atrophy*.
The *gallbladder* restrains the *Liver* leaves, and when its bile is excessively bitter, it causes the *Liver* to heat, leading to leakage. When the *gallbladder* is diseased, the mouth becomes bitter. Now, since the bile leaks, the mouth is bitter.
The *Liver* governs the *tendon membranes*, so when heated, they dry and contract, resulting in *tendon atrophy*.

*The Canon of Eighty-One Difficulties* (《八十一难经》) states: The *gallbladder* lies beneath the shorter *Liver* leaves.

When the *Spleen qi* is heated, the *Stomach* dries, causing thirst, and the *flesh and muscles* lose sensation, manifesting as *muscle atrophy*.
The *Spleen* and *Stomach* are connected by membranes, so when the *Spleen* is heated, the *Stomach* fluids leak, causing dryness and thirst.
The *Spleen* governs the *flesh and muscles*, and now the heat has penetrated internally, so the *flesh and muscles* lose sensation, resulting in *muscle atrophy*.

When the *Kidney qi* is heated, the *lumbar spine* cannot be raised, the bones become withered, and the marrow is depleted, manifesting as *bone atrophy*.
The *lumbar region* is the domain of the *Kidneys*, and the *Kidney* meridians ascend the inner thigh, penetrate the spine, and belong to the *Kidneys*, so when the *Kidney qi* is heated, the *lumbar spine* cannot be raised.
The *Kidneys* govern the *bones and marrow*, so when heated, the bones wither and the marrow is consumed, resulting in *bone atrophy*.

The Yellow Emperor asked: *How does one acquire these conditions?*
The Lord of the Crooked Spruce replied:
The *Lungs* are the longest of the *zang*, serving as the *Heart’s* canopy.
They occupy a high position and spread their lobes throughout the chest, hence they are the longest of the *zang* and the *Heart’s* canopy.

「When one suffers loss or fails to obtain what is sought, the *Lungs* grow heated with their lobes scorched, and this manifests as *Lung-qi depletion* (fèi qì wū), causing the *Lungs* to heat and their lobes to wither.
If one’s *intentions* (zhì) are excessive and unfulfilled, or if *lust* (yín) is indulged to the point of distraction, and one engages in sexual activity excessively, the *tendinous sinews* (zōng jīn) slacken, leading to *tendinous atrophy* (jīn wēi) and *white turbidity* (bái yín).
*White turbidity* refers to the emission of white substances resembling semen—men excrete them in urine, while women experience a continuous, thread-like discharge from the *yin vessel* (yīn qì).

Thus, the *Lower Classic* (Xià Jīng) states: *Tendinous atrophy* arises from the *Liver*, caused by excessive strain from *yin labor* (yīn lì).
The *Lower Classic* (Xià Jīng) further says: *The atrophy of flesh* stems from dampness.
The *Grand Treatise on the Correspondence of Yin and Yang* (Yīn-Yáng Yìng-Xiàng Dà Lùn) declares: *The dampness of Earth*, when felt, harms the *skin, flesh, tendons, and sinews*.
This is what is meant by harm to the *flesh*.

If one undertakes prolonged journeys and grows exhausted, then encounters intense heat and thirst, the *yang qi* (yáng qì) will internally deplete the *yin qi* (yīn qì).
When *yin qi* is internally depleted, the heat settles in the *Kidneys*, which are the *water reservoir* (shuǐ cáng).
Now, since *water cannot overcome fire*, the *bones* wither and the *marrow* becomes depleted, causing the legs to fail to support the body, resulting in *bone atrophy* (gǔ wēi).

The *Kidneys* inherently dislike *dryness* (zào), yet heat lingers within, scorching the *bones* and drying them, hence the weakness of *bone atrophy*.

The Yellow Emperor asked: *How does one distinguish these conditions?*
The Lord of the Crooked Spruce replied:
When the *Lungs* are heated, the complexion is white and the *hair* (máo) is damaged.
When the *Heart* is heated, the complexion is red and the *network vessels* (luò mài) overflow.
When the *Liver* is heated, the complexion is greenish-blue and the *nails* (zhǎo) wither.
When the *Spleen* is heated, the complexion is yellow and the *flesh* writhes in movement.
When the *Kidneys* are heated, the complexion is black and the *teeth* become dry and brittle.

Each condition is identified by examining the *zang*’s characteristic color and what it nourishes, thus revealing its manifestation.

The Yellow Emperor asked: *If this is true, then why does the theory state that treating atrophy focuses solely on the *Yangming* (yáng míng) meridian?*
The Lord of the Crooked Spruce replied:
The *Yangming* (yáng míng) is the *sea of the five zang and six fu* (zàng-fǔ zhī hǎi).
The *Yangming* meridian, belonging to the *Stomach*, governs the nourishment of the *tendinous sinews* (zōng jīn), which bind the *bones* and facilitate movement at the *joints* (jī guān).
The *tendinous sinews* refer to the vertical sinews above and below the *horizontal bone* (héng gǔ) within the *yin vessel* (yīn máo).
They connect above to the *chest and abdomen* (xiōng fù), below to the *hip joint* (kuān shǐ), and span the *back and abdomen* (bèi fù) up to the *head and neck* (tóu xiàng).
Thus, the *tendinous sinews* bind the *bones* and enable the *joints* (jī guān), which are the body’s major pivot points for flexion and extension.

The *Chéng* (音宽) and *Shì* (枯熬切) meridians converge with the *Yangming* meridian at the *horizontal bone* (héng gǔ).
The *Chong* (冲 mài) meridian is the *sea of the twelve meridians*, as stated in the *Spiritual Pivot Classic* (Líng Shū Jīng):
*The Chong meridian* is the *sea of the twelve meridians*, governing the permeation and nourishment of the *tendinous sinews* (xī gǔ).
It converges with the *Yangming* at the *tendinous sinews* (zōng jīn), specifically at the vertical sinews above and below the *horizontal bone* (héng gǔ).
The *Chong* meridian ascends along the *sides of the umbilicus* (qié bàng), each branch corresponding to five *fifths of a body-inch* (shēn cùn) from the body’s midline.
The *Yangming* meridian also ascends along the *sides of the umbilicus*, each branch corresponding to one and five *fifths of a body-inch* (shēn cùn).
Since the *tendinous sinews* (zōng jīn) gather at the *horizontal bone* (héng gǔ), the *Chong* and *Yangming* meridians combine there, hence the saying: *The Chong and Yangming meridians converge at the tendinous sinews, with Yangming being the primary channel, and all belong to the belt meridian (dài mài), while branching into the governing vessel (dū mài).*

The *convergence of the tendinous sinews* (zōng jīn) occurs at the center of the *horizontal bone* (héng gǔ), descending from above.
Thus, the *Yin* and *Yang* meridians collectively converge at the *tendinous sinews*, which unite at the *gas street* (qì jiē), with the *Yangming* being the longest among them.
The *tendinous sinews* converge at the *sides of the umbilicus* (qié bàng) and descend to the *horizontal bone* (héng gǔ).
The *Yangming* meridian supports them externally, while the *Chong* meridian lies within, hence the saying: *They converge at the gas street, with Yangming being the longest.*」

The *gas street* (qì jiē) is where the **Yinwei** (Yinmo, *阴髦*) meridians pulse on both sides.

The *belt meridian* (dài mài) originates at **Jìxié** (seasonal ribs, *季胁*), encircling the body once before connecting to the *governing vessel* (dū mài).
The *governing vessel* (dū mài) rises from **Guānyuán** (passage gate, *关元*), ascending and descending along the abdomen.
Thus, it is said that all belong to the *belt meridian* and connect to the *governing vessel*.

The *governing vessel* (dū mài), *conception vessel* (rèn mài), and *Chong* meridian (chōng mài) arise together but follow divergent paths, hence the *Classical* (jīng) texts sometimes refer to them in varying sequences.
When the *Yangming* meridian is depleted, the *tendinous sinews* slacken, the *belt meridian* fails to draw them taut, and thus the foot becomes paralyzed and unusable.

The *Yangming* meridian descends from **Quēpén** (deficient basin, *缺盆*), passing beneath the breast through **Kāng** (a point within the breast, *康*), and then down to **Qièbàng** (sides of the umbilicus, *侠齐*) at the *gas street* (qì jiē).
Its branches diverge, rising from beneath the stomach, winding along the abdominal flank and descending to the *gas street* (qì jiē) where they reunite.
From there, they proceed to the **spleen** (pí), reach **Fúzhū** (hidden beast, *伏菟*), descend into the **knee joint** (xī tǐ, *膝体*), and follow the outer edge of the **abdominal viscera** (fǔ, *腑*), attaching to the foot before entering the **inner side of the middle toe** (zhōng zhǐ nèi wèn, *中指内问*).
Another branch diverges three *cùn* beneath the knee, descending to enter the **outer side of the middle toe** (zhōng zhǐ wài wèn, *中指外问*).
Thus, when the *Yangming* meridian is depleted, the *tendinous sinews* slacken and weaken, the *belt meridian* fails to draw them taut, and the foot becomes paralyzed and unusable.

The **Sovereign** (Dì) said: *"How should it be treated?"*
**Qíbō** (岐伯) replied: *"Restore each to its proper *honor* (róng, *荣*), clear its *acupuncture points* (yǔ, *俞*), regulate its excesses and deficiencies, harmonize its inversions and sequencings.
The sinews, meridians, bones, and flesh should each receive the *qi* of their designated month and season, and the illness will then be cured."*

The **Sovereign** said: *"Excellent."*
*"Receiving the qi of their designated month"* refers to the **Five Phases** (Wǔxíng, *五常*) aligning with the seasonal *qi* of each organ.
For instance:
- The **Liver** (gān) rules **Jia-Yi** (甲乙),
- The **Heart** (xīn) rules **Bing-Ding** (丙丁),
- The **Spleen** (pí) rules **Wù-Jǐ** (戊己),
- The **Lung** (fèi) rules **Gēng-Xīn** (庚辛),
- The **Kidney** (shèn) rules **Rén-Gùi** (壬癸),
all according to the **law of the Five Phases** (Wángqì fǎ, *王气法*).
*"Receiving the qi of their designated month"* further implies the **Five Phases** (Wǔxíng) aligning with their respective seasonal *qi*.

**Chapter on "Jue" (Sudden Collapse)**

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Why does the condition of **Jue** (厥) involve cold and heat?"*
**Jue** refers to the reversal of **Qi** (氣) ascending.

The world mistakenly transmits it as *"foot **Qi**"* (脚氣), so I have broadly annotated the theories.

Qibo replied: *"When the **Yang Qi** (陽氣) weakens below, it results in cold **Jue**; when the **Yin Qi** (陰氣) weakens below, it results in hot **Jue**.*
**Yang** refers to the three **Yang** meridians of the foot;
**Yin** refers to the three **Yin** meridians of the foot.
*Below* means the foot.

The Emperor said: *"Why must hot **Jue** begin from the foot below?"*
Since **Yang** governs the exterior and **Jue** occurs internally, He inquired.

Qibo said: *"The **Yang Qi** originates from the outer side of the five toes of the foot, while the **Yin** meridians gather below the foot and converge at the foot’s center. Thus, when **Yang Qi** prevails, the foot below grows hot.*
In general terms:
The **Foot Taiyang** (足太陽) meridian emerges from the outer lateral end of the little toe;
The **Foot Shaoyang** (足少陽) meridian emerges from the end of the little toe’s adjacent toe;
The **Foot Yangming** (足陽明) meridian emerges from the ends of the middle and big toes,
all ascending along the **Yang** pathways of the foot.
The **Liver** and **Spleen** meridians gather below the foot,
converging at the foot’s center,
so when **Yin** is weak, the foot below grows hot.

**New Annotation:** *"According to the Jia-Yi Jing (甲乙經), ‘**Yang Qi** originates from the foot’ should read ‘**Yang Qi** ascends from the foot.’ ‘*Originates*’ should be corrected to ‘*ascends*.’"*

The Emperor said: *"Why must cold **Jue** begin from the five toes and ascend to the knee?"*
Since **Yin** governs the interior and **Jue** occurs externally, He inquired.

Qibo said: *"The **Yin Qi** originates from the inner side of the five toes, gathers below the knee, and converges above it. Thus, when **Yin Qi** prevails, cold ascends from the five toes to above the knee—but this cold does not come from the exterior; it all comes from the interior.*
This is also a general statement.

The **Foot Taiyin** (足太陰) meridian originates from the inner lateral end of the big toe;
The **Foot Jueyin** (足厥陰) meridian originates from the center of the three hairs at the end of the big toe;
The **Foot Shaoyin** (足少陰) meridian originates below the little toe, slanting inward toward the foot’s center,
all ascending along the **Yin** pathways of the foot and entering the **Yin** of the thigh, then the abdomen.
Thus, it is said that they gather below the knee and converge above it.

The Emperor said: *"Why does cold **Jue** occur when it does?"*
Qibo replied: *"The anterior **Yin** (前阴) is where the **Zong** (宗) tendons converge and where the **Taiyin** (太陰) and **Yangming** (陽明) meridians meet.*
The **Zong** tendons align at the **Jia** (侠) and **Qi** (齐), merging below with the **Yin** organs.
Thus, it is said that the anterior **Yin** is where the **Zong** tendons converge.
**Taiyin** refers to the **Spleen** meridian;
**Yangming** refers to the **Stomach** meridian.
The **Spleen** and **Stomach** meridians both support the **Zong** tendons closely,
so it is said that they meet at the **Taiyin** and **Yangming**.

**New Annotation:** *"According to the Jia-Yi Jing (甲乙經), ‘*Anterior **Yin** (前阴)*’ is where the **Zong** tendons converge,’ should read ‘*Anterior **Jueyin** (厥陰)*’ is where the tendons gather.’*
**Quanyuan** (全元起) states: ‘*Anterior **Yin** (前阴)*’ refers to **Jueyin** (厥陰).*
This differs from Wang’s annotation but is another valid interpretation.

*In spring and summer, **Yang Qi** is abundant while **Yin Qi** is scarce;
in autumn and winter, **Yin Qi** thrives while **Yang Qi** weakens.*
This is the **Dao/Way** (道) of Heaven’s constant order.
*For those of robust constitution (質壮),*
when autumn and winter deplete their **vitality** (所用),
the descending **Qi** (下氣) struggles upward and cannot recover,
causing **Essence** (精氣) and **Qi** (氣) to overflow downward,
while **pathogenic **Qi** (邪氣)** follows and ascends.

**Quality** (質) refers to bodily constitution.
**Depleted by overuse** (奪於所用) means excessive desires drain their **Essence** and **Qi****.
**Qi arises from the center** (氣因於中) —
**New Annotation:** *"According to the Jia-Yi Jing (甲乙經), ‘*Qi arises from the center*’ (氣因於中) should read ‘*Qi arises from the center of the body*’ (所中)."*

When **Yang Qi** weakens, it cannot permeate and nourish the **meridians** (經) and **collaterals** (絡), so **Yang Qi** diminishes daily, while **Yin Qi** remains alone, hence the hands and feet become cold.

The Emperor asked: *"How does heat-induced **ulceration** (熱厥) arise?"*
Trace its origin, and you shall know.

Qìbó replied: When **alcohol** enters the **stomach** (胃),
the **collaterals** (絡脈) become full while the **meridians** (經脈) grow empty.
The **Spleen** (脾) governs the distribution of **fluids** (津液) to the **stomach** (胃),
and when **Yin Qi** is depleted, **Yang Qi** invades.
When **Yang Qi** invades, the **stomach** (胃) becomes unbalanced,
and when the **stomach** (胃) is unbalanced, **Essence** (精氣) is exhausted.
When **Essence** (精氣) is exhausted, it cannot nourish the four limbs (四支).
The **front Yin** (前阴) is where the **Tai-Yin** (太陰) and **Yang-Ming** (陽明) meridians converge—
thus it is named.
When the **stomach** (胃) is unbalanced, **Essence** (精氣) is exhausted.
When **Essence** (精氣) is internally insufficient, the four limbs lack **Qi** to nourish them.
Such a person must often be intoxicated (數醉),
or overfed (若饱) and then engage in sexual activity (以入房),
causing **Qi** to gather in the **Spleen** (脾) and fail to disperse.
When **alcohol Qi** (酒氣) and **grain Qi** (谷氣) clash,
heat flourishes within, thus heat spreads throughout the body,
and internal heat causes **urine** (溺) to turn red.

When **alcohol Qi** (酒氣) is excessive and **Spleen Qi** (脾氣) is weakened,
**Kidney Qi** (腎氣) declines daily, and **Yang Qi** (陽氣) prevails alone,
hence the hands and feet become hot.
Intoxication and overfeeding followed by sexual activity
exhaust **Essence** (精氣) internally, leaving the center empty and heat invading,
thus **Kidney Qi** (腎氣) weakens, **Yang** (陽) predominates while **Yin** (陰) is depleted,
and heat arises in the hands and feet.

The Emperor asked: *"Why does **ulceration** (厥) sometimes cause abdominal distension (腹满),
sometimes sudden loss of consciousness (暴不知人),
and sometimes take half a day or even a full day before consciousness returns?"*
*"Sudden"* (暴) is akin to *"abrupt"* (卒).
It refers to an abrupt onset where one is unaware and unresponsive.
*"Unknown to others"* (不知人) means one does not recognize people at all.
Some call this **corpse-like **ulceration** (尸厥)**.

Qìbó replied: When **Yin Qi** (陰氣) is excessive in the upper body (上),
the lower body (下) becomes empty, causing abdominal distension (腹满).
When **Yang Qi** (陽氣) is excessive in the upper body (上),
the descending **Qi** (下氣) presses upward, and **pathogenic **Qi** (邪氣)** reverses,
reversing then causes **Yang Qi** (陽氣) to become chaotic,
and when **Yang Qi** (陽氣) is chaotic, one loses consciousness (不知人).

**Yin** (陰) refers to the **Tai-Yin** (足太陰) of the feet.
*New Annotation: According to the Jia-Yi Jing (甲乙經), the phrase "When **Yang Qi** is excessive in the upper body"* (陽氣盛於上) should read "When the **stomach** is full"* (腹满), which aligns with the Jia-Yi Jing's explanation.*

Why so? Because the Jia-Yi Jing states:
*"When the **Yang meridian** descends and collapses (陽脉下坠),
and the **Yin meridian** ascends in contest (阴脉上争),
it triggers **corpse-like **ulceration** (尸厥)**."*
How can **Yin Qi** (陰氣) be excessive above,
while also stating **Yang Qi** (陽氣) is excessive above?
Zhang Zhòngjǐng further explains:
*"When the **Shao-Yin** (少陰) meridian fails to reach,
**Kidney Qi** (腎氣) is weak, with little **Essence** (精) and **blood** (血).
**Qi** (氣) rushes upward, pressing the **heart** (心) and **diaphragm** (鬲).
**Zong Qi** (宗氣) retreats and gathers, causing **blood** (血) to congeal beneath the heart.
**Yang Qi** (陽氣) descends, and heat returns to the **Yin** (陰) regions of the legs,
moving with **Yin** (陰) and preventing the body from being at ease (不七).
This is **corpse-like **ulceration** (尸厥)**."*
Zhang Zhòngjǐng’s account of **Yang Qi** (陽氣) descending
indicates that **Yang Qi** (陽氣) cannot be excessive above,
thus confirming the Jia-Yi Jing’s interpretation.
Moreover, the Emperor’s annotation that **Yin** (陰) refers solely to **Tai-Yin** (足太陰) is also incomplete.

According to the *Móu Cì Lùn* (缪刺论):
*"When **pathogenic **Qi** (邪氣)** lodges in the **collaterals** (絡) of the **Shao-Yin** (手足少陰),
**Tai-Yin** (太陰), and **Yang-Ming** (足陽明) meridians,
these five **collaterals** (絡) all converge in the **ear** (耳).
The left **ear** (角) is where the **collaterals** (絡) ascend,
and when all five **collaterals** (絡) are depleted,
it causes the body’s **pulse** (脉) to move erratically while the form remains unresponsive,
appearing lifeless, or what is called **corpse-like **ulceration** (尸厥)**."*
How can one attribute **ulceration** (厥) solely to **Tai-Yin** (太陰)?

The Emperor said: *"Well explained.*
I wish to hear the **ulceration** (厥) patterns of the six **meridians** (經脈) and their corresponding diseases."*

Qìbó replied: When the **Jù-Yáng** (巨陽) meridian undergoes **ulceration** (厥),
the head swells and feels heavy (頭重),
the feet cannot move (不能行),
and it leads to **convulsions** (發為㿟仆).
The **Jù-Yáng** (巨陽) is the **Tai-Yang** (太陽) meridian.
The **Tai-Yang** (太陽) **collateral** (豚) begins at the inner canthus (目内毗),
ascends to the forehead (上额), and meets at the vertex (交巅上).
Its branches diverge (支别者) from the vertex to the upper ear angle (至耳上角).
Its direct course (其直行者) descends from the vertex into the **collaterals** (絡) of the brain (脑),
returns and emerges below the nape (下项),
follows the inner aspect of the shoulder and scapula (循肩膊内),
passes along the spine (侠脊抵腰中),
enters and descends along the **collaterals** (絡) of the lumbar region (膂),
connecting to the **Kidney** (腎) and **Bladder** (膀胱).
Its other branches (其支别者) descend from the lumbar region (腰中),
pass through the buttocks (下贯臀),
and enter the **Bladder** (胭中).
Another branch (其支别者) diverges from the inner scapula (膊内),
spreading left and right to descend through the **collaterals** (絡) of the buttocks (贯肿),
passing the **sacral hiatus** (□枢),
following the outer aspect of the hip (循□外饰后康下),
and merging with the **Bladder** (胭中).
Below, it descends into the inner aspect of the thigh (踹内),
emerges behind the medial malleolus (外踝之后),
and follows the **ankle bone** (京骨) to the lateral side of the little toe (至小指之端外侧).
Thus, **ulceration** (厥) patterns manifest externally as such.
*"Swelling"* (肿) should not be mistaken for *"heel"* (踵).

When the **Yang-Ming** (陽明) meridian undergoes **ulceration** (厥),
it causes **epilepsy** (癫疾) with a desire to flee or run (欲走呼),
abdominal distension that prevents movement (腹满不得外),
flushed and heated face (面赤而热),
hallucinations (妄见), and incoherent speech (妄言).

The **Yang-Ming** (足陽明) meridian begins at the nose (起於鼻),
meets the **Jīng** (類) at the midpoint of the forehead (交类中),
descends along the outer nose (下循鼻外),
enters the upper teeth (入上齿中),
returns and emerges beside the mouth (还出侠口环唇),
descends to meet the **Chéng Jiāng** (承浆),
then follows the jawline (颐后下廉),
emerges at the **Dà Yíng** (大迎),
and runs along the cheek (循颊) to the **ear** (至車上耳前),
passing the **Kè Zhǔ Rén** (客主人),
reaching the hairline (发际) and the forehead (至额颅).
Its branches (其支别者) diverge from the **Dà Yíng** (大迎) forward,
descend into the **Rén Yíng** (人迎),
follow the throat (喉咙) into the **suprasternal fossa** (缺盆),
descend to the **diaphragm** (鬲), connecting to the **stomach** (胃) and **Spleen** (脾).
Its direct course (其直行者) descends from the **suprasternal fossa** (缺盆),
along the inner aspect of the breast (乳内廉),
then beside the **Qí** (齐) into the **Qì Jiē** (气街).
Another branch (其支别者) begins below the **stomach** (胃),
follows the abdominal **collaterals** (絡) (循腹裹),
descends to the **Qì Jiē** (气街) and merges there.
Below, it descends to the **stomach** (下入胃),
reaches the **Fú Zǐ** (伏菟),
and enters the **knee** (膝).
It descends along the outer aspect of the lower leg (下循腑外康),
attaches to the **foot** (下足附),
and enters the inner side of the middle toe (入中指内问).
Another branch (其支别者) diverges three inches below the knee (下膝三寸),
descending to the outer aspect of the middle toe (入中指外闲).
Yet another branch (其支别者) ascends along the outer aspect of the foot (附上),
enters the outer side of the big toe (入大指闲),
and emerges at its tip (出其端).
Thus, **ulceration** (厥) manifests as such.
*"Epilepsy"* (癫) should not be confused with *"vertex"* (巅).

When the **Shao-Yáng** (少陽) meridian undergoes **ulceration** (厥),
it causes sudden deafness (暴聋),
swollen cheeks with heat (颊肿而热),
lateral pain (胁痛),
and **pathogenic **Qi** (邪氣)** preventing the **organs** (腑) from functioning properly (不可以运).
The **Shao-Yáng** (足少陽) meridian begins at the outer canthus (目锐毗),
ascends to the temple (头角) and behind the ear (下耳后),
follows the neck (循颈),
runs in front of the **hand Shao-Yáng** (手少陽) meridian,
reaches the shoulder (至肩上),
and meets the **hand Shao-Yáng** (手少陽) meridian behind it (交出手少陽之后),
entering the **suprasternal fossa** (入缺盆).
Its branches (其支别者) diverge from behind the ear (耳后),
enter the **ear** (入耳中),
and emerge to run in front of the ear (走耳前),
reaching the outer canthus (至目锐毗后).

The **Shao-Yáng** (少陽) branch diverges from the outer canthus (目锐毗) below the **Great Welcome** (大迎), merging with the **hand Shao-Yáng** (手少陽) meridian at the **Manifest** (显), descending to join the **Cheek Cart** (颊车), then passing down the neck to merge with the **suprasternal fossa** (缺盆) and proceed into the chest (胸中). It pierces the **diaphragmatic region** (鬲), networks the liver (络肝), and belongs to the gallbladder (属胆). Following the lateral ribs (循胁裹), it emerges at the **Qi Street** (气街), encircles the **medial border of the scapula** (髦际), and horizontally enters the **Medullary Depression** (髅厌).

Its direct course (其直行者) descends from the **suprasternal fossa** (缺盆) into the **axillary region** (下掖), travels across the chest and passes the **Seasonal Rib** (季胁), then merges with the **Spleen Depression** (脾厌). Below this, it follows the **Spleen-Yang** meridian (脾阳), emerges at the **external Knee Support** (膝外康), descends to enter before the **external Auxiliary Bone** (外辅骨), reaching down to the **Extreme Bone** (绝骨) and its tip (之端). It then emerges before the **external ankle** (外踝), ascends along the **foot’s lateral aspect** (足附), and exits at the **end of the little toe** (小指) and the **second toe** (次指). Thus, the **ulceration** (厥) of the **Shao-Yáng** (少陽) meridian manifests as such.

The **ulceration** (厥) of the **Tai-Yin** (太阴) meridian results in abdominal fullness (腹满) and distension (腹胀), difficulty in defecation (后不利), loss of appetite (不欲食), and nausea upon eating (食则呕). It also causes inability to urinate (不得外).

The **foot Tai-Yin** (足太阴) meridian originates at the **tip of the big toe** (大指之端), ascends the **inner side of the leg** (膝股内前廉), and enters the abdomen, belonging to the spleen (属脾) and networking the stomach (络胃). It then ascends through the **diaphragmatic region** (鬲), alongside the throat (侠咽), connecting to the **root of the tongue** (舌本) and dispersing beneath the tongue (散舌下).

Its branch diverges again from the stomach (复从胃), separates at the **diaphragmatic region** (上鬲), and flows into the heart (注心中). Thus, the **ulceration** (厥) of the **Tai-Yin** (太阴) meridian manifests as such.

The **ulceration** (厥) of the **Shao-Yin** (少阴) meridian causes dry mouth (口乾) and red urine (溺赤), as well as abdominal fullness (腹满) and heart pain (心痛).

The **foot Shao-Yin** (足少阴) meridian ascends the **inner posterior aspect of the thigh** (股内后康), pierces the spine (贯脊), and belongs to the kidneys (属肾), networking the bladder (络膀胱).

Its direct course (其直行者) ascends from the kidneys (从肾上), pierces the **liver’s diaphragmatic region** (贯肝鬲), enters the lungs (入肺中), follows the throat (循喉咙), and runs alongside the **root of the tongue** (侠舌本).

Its branch diverges from the lungs (从肺出), networks the heart (络心), and flows into the chest (注胸中). Thus, the **ulceration** (厥) of the **Shao-Yin** (少阴) meridian manifests as such.

The **ulceration** (厥) of the **Jue-Yin** (厥阴) meridian causes distension and pain in the lower abdomen (少腹肿痛), abdominal fullness with **blocked bowel movements** (腹胀泾没不利), a preference for lying with knees flexed (好卧屈膝), **retraction and swelling of the genitals** (阴缩肿), and **internal heat in the organs** (腑内热).

The **foot Jue-Yin** (足厥阴) meridian begins one **cun** below the **inner ankle** (内踝), ascends eight **cun** along the **medial malleolus** (踝), and crosses behind the **Tai-Yin** (太阴) meridian. It then ascends the **inner thigh** (胭内康), follows the **medial aspect of the thigh** (循股阴), enters the **medial border of the scapula** (髦中), descends to encircle the **genital region** (环阴器), reaches the **lower abdomen** (抵小腹), and runs alongside the stomach (侠胃), belonging to the liver (属肝) and networking the gallbladder (络胆). It ascends to pierce the **diaphragmatic region** (贯鬲). Thus, the **ulceration** (厥) of the **Jue-Yin** (厥阴) meridian manifests as such.

[Note: One text reads **internal heat in the organs** (腑内热), but another reads **external heat in the organs** (腑外热). This discrepancy is due to transmission errors in the copied texts.]

When **excess** (盛), **acupuncture** (写) is applied; when **deficient** (虚), **moxibustion** (补) is used. If neither excess nor deficiency exists, the **meridian’s points** (穴俞) and **classical methods** (经法) are employed, adjusting the **breathing techniques** (留呼多少) accordingly.

If neither excess nor deficiency exists, it means that **pathogenic Qi** (邪气) has not yet become excessive, while **true Qi** (真气) has not yet become deficient. Thus, the treatment is guided by the **meridian’s points** (穴俞) and **classical methods** (经法).

The **Tai-Yin ulceration** (太阴厥逆) causes **organ constriction and spasm** (腑急孪), with heart pain radiating to the abdomen (心痛引腹). This is the **primary disease** (治主病者).

The **foot Tai-Yin** (足太阴) meridian originates at the **tip of the big toe** (大指之端), follows the **inner side of the leg** (内侧) up to the **front of the inner ankle** (内踝前康), and ascends the **inner border of the leg** (上端内). It then travels along the **posterior aspect of the tibia** (腑骨后), up to the **front inner aspect of the thigh** (膝股内前康), and enters the abdomen (入腹).

Its branch diverges again from the stomach (复从胃), separates at the **diaphragmatic region** (上鬲), and flows into the heart (注心中). Thus, **organ constriction and spasm** (腑急孪) and heart pain radiating to the abdomen (心痛引腹) occur.

The **Tai-Yin** (太阴) **pulse** (豚) has **left and right variations** (行有左右). One should observe where it **exceeds** (有过者) and **acupuncture** (发取) accordingly, hence the term **primary disease** (治主病).

[Newly corrected text states:] The details from *"Tai-Yin Ulceration"* (《太阴厥逆》) to the end of the section are originally found in Volume Nine of the *Complete Works of Quán Yuānshǐ* (全元起本), but the *Wáng* edition (王氏) relocated them here.

The **Shao-Yin ulceration** (少阴厥逆) causes **deficient fullness** (虚满) and **nausea with vomiting** (呕变), as well as **leakage of clear fluids** (下泄清). This is the **primary disease** (治主病者).

As its **pulse** (豚) ascends from the kidneys (从肾上), pierces the **liver’s diaphragmatic region** (贯肝鬲), and enters the lungs (入肺中), it follows the throat (循喉咙), hence the symptoms manifest as such.

The **Jue-Yin ulceration** (厥阴厥逆) causes **lumbar spasm and pain** (挛腰痛), **deficient fullness with anterior closure** (虚满前闭), and **delirious speech** (谵言).

[Newly corrected text states:] According to *Quán Yuānshǐ* (全元起), **delirious speech** (谵言) refers to **speech due to Qi deficiency** (气虚独言). The pronunciation of **谵** (谵) is *yàn* (俨).

This is the **primary disease** (治主病者).

The **Jue-Yin ulceration** follows its pulse as it courses through the inner thigh (*gǔ yīn*), enters the perineum (*máo zhōng*), encircles the external genitalia (*yīn qì*), and ascends again along the throat’s posterior path. It connects to the root of the tongue (*luò shé běn*), hence the symptoms manifest as such.
**Newly corrected note:** According to the *Jia-Yi Jing* (《甲乙经》), the Jue-Yin channel does not connect to the root of the tongue. Wang Bing’s annotations in *The Treatise on Heat Needling* (《刺热篇》), *The Treatise on Lumbar Pain Needling* (《刺腰痛篇》), and this passage all state it connects to the root of the tongue. However, in his annotations on *The Wind Theory* (《风论》) and *The Theory of Stagnation* (《痹论》), he does not mention this connection. Wang’s annotations vary, and the *Jia-Yi Jing* should be considered authoritative.

When all three **Yin channels** are in reverse (*sān yīn jùnì*), they cannot advance or retreat, causing the hands and feet to become cold, and death occurs within three days. The **Yin channels are severed**, hence death occurs within three days.

**Tài-Yáng ulceration** (*Tàiyáng jùnì*) causes rigidity and collapse (*jiāng pū*), vomiting blood, and frequent belching (*shàn niǔ*). This is the **primary disease** (*zhì zhǔ bìng zhě*).
Its pulse arises from the inner canthus (*mù nèi pí*), ascends along the spine, and connects to the brain (*luò nǎo*), hence the symptoms manifest as such. *Jiāng* is pronounced *liáng*, *pū* as *fù*.

**Shǎo-Yáng ulceration** (*Shǎoyáng jùnì*) causes dysfunction of the joints and mechanisms (*jīguān bù lì*), meaning the waist cannot move (*yāo bù kě xíng*), and the neck cannot turn (*xiàng bù kě gù*).
Its pulse courses beneath the neck, encircles the perineum (*ráo máo jì*), and horizontally enters the spleen’s upper region (*shàng pí yàn zhōng*). Hence the symptoms manifest as such.
When **intestinal paralysis** (*fā cháng tān*) occurs, it is untreatable, and if there is **startle** (*jīng*), death follows.
The **foot Shǎo-Yáng pulse** (*zú Shǎoyáng tún*) pierces the diaphragm (*guàn lì*), connects to the liver, and belongs to the gallbladder (*shǔ dǎn*). It courses along the ribs, wraps around the flanks (*xiōng bāo*), and emerges at the hip joint (*qì jiē*). When intestinal paralysis occurs, the channel’s *qi* is severed, hence it is untreatable, and if there is startle, death follows.

**Yángmíng ulceration** (*Yángmíng jùnì*) causes dyspnea and coughing (*chuǎn kè*), feverish body (*shēn rè*), frequent startle (*shàn jīng*), and vomiting blood (*niǔ xuè*).
Its pulse courses along the throat (*xún hóulǒng*), enters the supraclavicular fossa (*rù quēpén*), descends to the diaphragm (*xià lì*), belongs to the stomach, and connects to the spleen (*shǔ pí*). Hence the symptoms manifest as such.

**Shǒu-Tài-Yīn ulceration** (*Shǒu-Tàiyīn jùnì*) causes **deficient fullness** (*xū mǎn*) and coughing, with frequent frothy vomiting (*shàn ōu mò*). This is the **primary disease** (*zhì zhǔ bìng zhě*).
The **hand Tàiyīn pulse** arises from the middle burner (*zhōng jiāo*), descends to connect with the large intestine (*xià luò dà cháng*), then ascends along the stomach’s orifice (*hái xún wèi kǒu*), enters the diaphragm (*shàng lì*), and belongs to the lungs (*shǔ fèi*). Hence the symptoms manifest as such.

**Shǒu-Xīnzhǔ Shǎo-Yīn ulceration** (*Shǒu-Xīnzhǔ Shǎoyīn jùnì*) causes heart pain radiating to the throat (*xīn tòng yǐn hóulǒng*), feverish body (*shēn rè*), and is untreatable, leading to death.
The **hand Xīnzhǔ pulse** arises from the chest (*qǐ yú xiōng zhōng*), emerges to belong to the pericardium (*shǔ xīn bāo*).
The **hand Shǎoyīn pulse’s** branch separates (*qí zhī bié zhě*), ascending from the heart’s cords (*xīn xì*) to the side of the throat (*shàng xiè yàn hóulǒng*). Hence the symptoms manifest as such.

**Shǒu-Tàiyáng ulceration** (*Shǒu-Tàiyáng jùnì*) causes deafness and lacrimation (*ěr lóng qì chū*), inability to turn the neck (*xiàng bù kě gù*), and inability to flex or extend the waist (*yāo bù kě fǔ yǎng*). This is the **primary disease** (*zhì zhǔ bìng zhě*).
The **hand Tàiyáng pulse’s** branch separates (*qí zhī bié zhě*), ascending from the supraclavicular fossa (*cóng quēpén*), along the neck to the cheek (*xún jìng shàng jiá*), reaching the outer canthus (*zhì mù ruì pí*), then retreating into the ear (*què rù ěr zhōng*).
Another branch separates (*qí zhī bié zhě*), ascending from the cheek (*cóng jiá shàng sòng dǐ zhǐ bí*), reaching the inner canthus (*zhì mù nèi pí*). Hence, deafness and lacrimation occur, and the neck cannot turn.
The waist cannot flex or extend due to the pulse’s non-correspondence (*mài bù xiāng yìng*), likely an error in the transmitted text.

**Shǒu-Yángmíng Shǎoyáng ulceration** (*Shǒu-Yángmíng Shǎoyáng jùnì*) causes **pharyngeal obstruction** (*fā hóu bì*), **hoarseness** (*kē zhǒng*), and **spasm** (*jìng*). This is the **primary disease** (*zhì zhǔ bìng zhě*).
The **hand Yángmíng pulse’s** branch separates (*qí zhī bié zhě*), ascending from the supraclavicular fossa along the neck (*shàng jǐng*).
The **hand Shǎoyáng pulse’s** branch separates (*qí zhī bié zhě*), ascending from the chest’s center (*cóng tán zhōng*), emerging from the supraclavicular fossa, and ascending to the nape (*shàng xiàng*).
Hence the symptoms manifest as such.
**Newly corrected note:** According to *Quán Yuānshǐ* (全元起), *jìng* (痉) should be *jìng* (痊).

**Disease Diagnosis Chapter**

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"When a person suffers from **stomach cavity atrophy** (*wèi yuàn tān*), how should one diagnose them?"*

Gē Bó replied: *"To diagnose this, one must examine the **stomach pulse** (*wèi mài*). Its pulse should be **deep and fine** (*chén xì*). If it is deep and fine, this indicates **inverted qi** (*qì nì*).

The stomach is the **sea of water and grain** (*shuǐ gǔ zhī hǎi*), its blood abundant and its qi robust. Now, if the pulse is instead **fine and weak** (*xiàn*), this is contrary to its usual state.

**Newly corrected note:** According to *Quán Yuānshǐ* (全元起), *chén xì* (沉细) in *Jia-Yi Jing* (甲乙经) is recorded as *xiàn sè* (涩), while *Tài Sū* (太素) retains *chén xì* (沉细).

If the pulse is inverted, the **Ren Ying pulse** (*rén yíng*) will be **excessively strong** (*shèn shèng*). When excessively strong, it indicates **heat** (*rè*). The **deep pulse** (*chén niǔ*) signifies **cold** (*hán*). Cold qi obstructs the **Yáng** (*yáng*), causing the Ren Ying to surge excessively.

The **Ren Ying pulse** is the pulse of the **hand Yángmíng meridian** (*shǒu yángmíng mài*), so when it is excessively strong, it indicates **heat**.

The **Ren Ying** refers to the pulse beside the **larynx** (*jié hóu bàng*) that responds to the hand.

The **stomach pulse** (*wèi mài*) follows the throat and enters the **suprasternal fossa** (*quē pén*), hence it is called the **Ren Ying pulse**.

If the pulse is inverted and excessively strong, **heat accumulates at the stomach’s entrance** (*wèi kǒu*) and stagnates, causing **stomach cavity abscess** (*wèi yuàn yōng*).

When **blood and qi are robust**, but **internal heat assails them**, the two forces combine with heat, forming an **abscess** (*yōng*).

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Excellent."*

He then asked: *"Why does a person sometimes feel uneasy externally?"*

Qi Bao replied: *"When the **viscera** are injured or when **essence** has a place of lodgment, there is ease, and thus people cannot suspend their illness in midair. When the **five viscera** are injured or when **water and grain essence-qi** have a place of lodgment, if one supports the lower body, it averts ease—yet injury still reaches the viscera, so people cannot suspend their illness in midair."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Why can a person not lie back externally?"*
Meaning: *"Why can one not recline outward?"*

Qi Bao replied: *"The **lung** is the canopy of the viscera, dwelling high and spreading its leaves, with the four viscera beneath it—thus it is said that the lung is the canopy of the viscera. When **lung-qi** is robust, the pulse becomes large, and when the pulse is large, one cannot lie back externally. When **lung-qi** is full and overflowing, lying back externally causes shortness of breath and panting, hence one cannot lie back externally."* (This discussion appears in *The Strange and Sudden Yīn-Yáng*.)

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"There is a patient with **ulcerative collapse** (*jué*) whose left pulse, when examined, is sunken and tight, while the right pulse is floating and slow. If it is not as described, where does the illness lie?"*
*"Not as described"* means *"not sunken."*

Qi Bao replied: *"In winter, the right pulse should naturally be sunken and tight—this corresponds to the four seasons. If the left pulse is floating and slow, this contradicts the seasons. If it occurs on the left, the illness lies in the **kidney**, though it also concerns the **lung**, and there should be **lumbar pain**. In winter, if the left **kidney pulse** (*tún*) is floating and slow, floating indicates the **lung pulse**, hence it is said to also concern the lung. The **lumbar region** is the **kidney’s domain** (*fǔ*), so when the kidney is diseased, there is pain in the lumbar region."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How do you know this?"*

Qi Bao replied: *"The **Lesser Yīn pulse** (*shào yīn mài*) penetrates the **kidney** and connects with the **lung**. Now, the **lung pulse** appears, yet the kidney is diseased, hence the kidney causes **lumbar pain**. The left pulse being floating and slow is not the lung manifesting itself—rather, because the left kidney is deficient, the pulse cannot be sunken, so the **lung pulse** appears, and the kidney is diseased."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Excellent."*

There is a patient with **neck rigidity** (*jǐng láng*), sometimes treated with **stone cautery** (*shí*) or with **acupuncture and moxibustion**, yet both methods cure it. Where does the true principle lie?
Meaning: *"Though the methods of attack differ, the cure is the same—so where does the true method reside?"*

Qi Bao replied: *"This is a case of **same name, different category**."* (Though both are called *neck rigidity*, their subcutaneous distinctions are not uniform.)

Thus it is said:
*"When **abscess-qi** is stagnant, acupuncture should be used to open and remove it. When **qi is robust and blood is congested**, stone cautery should be applied to drain it—this is what is meant by **same illness, different treatments**."*
(*Xī* means **mole** or **dead flesh**. *Shí* refers to **stone lancets**, which can break large abscesses and release pus—now externally substituted with needles.)

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"There is a patient with **rage-induced madness** (*nù kuáng*),"* (The *Tài Sū* reads *"excessive anger"* instead.)

This illness—how does it arise?
Qi Bao replied: *"It arises from the Yang."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How does Yang cause madness?"*
*"When angered, one does not consider disaster—thus it is called madness."*

Qi Bao said: *"The Yang-qi, when violently disrupted and unable to disperse, thus easily gives rise to anger. The disease is named **Yang Jue**—meaning the Yang-qi is oppressed and fails to spread. Such a person is prone to anger, having once been violently disrupted, leaving the heart unrelieved and constricted. All such cases stem from extreme Yang reversal, hence the name **Yang Jue**."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How do you know this?"*
Qi Bao replied: *"The Yangming pulse is always active, while the Jùyáng and Shàoyáng pulses are normally still. If they move when they should not, and the movement is excessive, this is the sign. It means the pulses of the neck and nape are ceaselessly agitated. The Yangming pulse, when active, moves beside the larynx—this is the region of the **Rényíng** and **Qìshè** pulses. If the Shàoyáng pulse moves beneath the jawline, this is the region of the **Tiānchuāng** and **Tiānyǒu** pulses. If the Jùyáng pulse moves in the hollow before the great tendons on either side of the nape, this is the region of the **Tiānzhù** and **Tiānróng** pulses. When these pulses move contrary to their usual stillness and do so excessively, this indicates the disease."*

(*New annotation: According to Wang’s commentary, Tiānchuāng belongs to Shàoyáng, and Tiānróng to Tàiyáng. However, the *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng* states that Tiānchuāng is where Tàiyáng pulse-qi manifests, and Tiānróng is where Shàoyáng pulse-qi manifests. The two positions overlap, and the *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng* should be considered authoritative.*)

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How should it be treated?"*
Qi Bao replied: *"Deprive them of food, and it will be resolved."*

The food enters the **yin**, nurturing **qi** in the **yang**; thus, depriving them of food resolves it. If food is reduced, the **qi** weakens, so moderating their intake will halt the disease naturally.
(*New annotation: According to the *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng*, "夺" should be read as "衰" (wither). The *Tàisū* agrees.*)

Let them drink **shēngtiělùo** as a remedy.
(*New annotation: The *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng* reads "铁落" (tiělùo) and specifies it as a post-meal drink. Shēngtiělùo, bitter and slightly warm, regulates **qi** downward. Commonly miscalled "tiějiāng" (iron broth), it is not the same as raw iron liquid.*)

The phrase *"之或为人"* is a textual error.

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Excellent."* There is a disease marked by **shēnrè** (body heat), **tuòyuè** (listlessness), profuse sweating as if bathed, aversion to wind, and shortness of breath. What is its name?

Qi Bao replied: *"It is called **jiǔfēng** (Alcohol Wind). It arises when one drinks alcohol and contracts wind."*

The *Fēng Lùn* states: *"Drinking alcohol while exposed to wind results in **lòufēng** (Leaky Wind)."* This is also called **lòufēng**.

Those who indulge excessively have **yang qi** flourishing beyond its proper measure, loosening the **li** (boundaries), and opening the **Xuānfǔ** (mysterious orifice). When **yang** is excessive, the tendons weaken, causing **shēntǐ jiěyuè** (body relaxation and listlessness).
When the **li** are loosened, wind strikes internally; when the **Xuānfǔ** opens, **qi** escapes externally—thus the profuse sweating as if bathed.
Wind assaulting externally thins the skin, while the loosened **li** allow sweat to pour out, depleting the interior. The lingering **zhàngrè** (damp-heat) harms the lungs, hence the aversion to wind and breathlessness.
Since the disease stems from alcohol, it is called **jiǔfēng**.

(*Phonetic notes: 解 (jiě) is pronounced as in "介" (jiè); 惰 (yuè) is pronounced as in "徒卦" (túguà).*)

---
*(Note: "解惰" (jiěyuè) is rendered as "relaxation and listlessness" to preserve the parallel structure with "筋痿弱" (tendon weakness) while maintaining readability.)*

The Sovereign said: *"How should this be treated?"*
Qibo replied: *"Take ten parts each of *Zézhé* (Alisma) and *Mùgé* (Kochia), and five parts of *Línxián* (Cervus antler velvet), combine them, and take a pinch with three fingers after meals.
*Mùgé* is bitter, warm, and balanced; it treats severe wind disorders and stops sweating.
*Línxián* is bitter, cold, and balanced; it treats wind-dampness and weakened tendons.
*Zézhé* is sweet, cold, and balanced; it treats wind-dampness and augments *qi*.
Thus, these functions determine their precedence in the formula.
'After meals' refers to taking the medicine afterward.

The term *tàn zhī xì* means examining minutely—like a needle’s precision, pressing firmly to discern firmness or diffuseness.

The *Upper Canon* speaks of *qi* ascending to Heaven.
The *Lower Canon* speaks of disease’s transformations.
The *Golden Cabinet* ranks life and death.
*Kuìdù* refers to measuring and assessing.
*Qíhéng* concerns extraordinary diseases.
The term *qí* means preventing extraordinary diseases from killing in the four seasons.
*Dá* means allowing death in the four seasons.
The *New Annotation* states: According to Yang Shangshan, if a disease spreads until its critical moment, death follows—this is *héng*.
If a disease arises midway and spreads, this is *qí*.
*Kuì* means probing deeply, examining the pulse’s logic.
*Dù* means determining the disease’s location and measuring it by the seasons.
All instances of *suǒwèi* clarify unresolved meanings.
Now, these *suǒwèi* phrases, when traced through preceding texts, do not align with this passage’s intent. It seems these few lines were mistakenly appended, likely a misplaced annotation from a missing or rearranged section in the original text. The ancient text is fragmented, and these lines were erroneously inserted here.

**Chapter on Extraordinary Diseases**

The Sovereign asked: *"A person carries a heavy burden for nine months, then loses speech—what is this called?"*
Qibo replied: *"This is called *zhòngshēn*—when the body contains another body, meaning pregnancy. The loss of speech (*yīn*) occurs because the fetus restrains *qi*, severing the *bāo* (uterine) network’s flow, leaving the woman unable to speak.
The *bāo*’s collateral vessels are severed—meaning the pulse is cut off and uncirculated, not that the innate *qi* is exhausted."*

The Sovereign asked: *"How do you know this?"*
Qibo replied: *"The *bāo*’s collateral connects to the kidneys, passing through the kidney’s root to the tongue’s base. Thus, speech fails.
The *Shào Yīn* (kidney) channel nourishes the tongue; if *qi* fails to circulate, the tongue cannot speak."*

The Sovereign asked: *"How should this be treated?"*
Qibo replied: *"Do not treat it. It will resolve by the tenth month.
At ten months, the fetus departs, the *bāo*’s collateral reconnects, and the kidney’s *qi* ascends to restore speech as before."*

The *Needling Method* states: *"Do not deplete the deficient nor overfill the excessive, lest chronic illness (*zhěn*) form.
If treatment contradicts this principle, the fetus may die and remain, becoming a fixed, enduring *zhěn*.
Only then should adjustment begin."*

The *New Annotation* states: According to *Jiǎ-Yǔ Jīng* and *Tàisù*, these four characters are absent. According to Quán Yuánqǐ’s annotation: *"Untreatable" means the body, after nine months, is emaciated and burdened—treatment is impossible until the tenth month, when the fetus is born and the body returns to normal. Then adjustment may follow.
These four characters were mistakenly transcribed from Quán Yuánqǐ’s notes and should be deleted.

*"Do not deplete the deficient"* means the body is weak and emaciated—do not use heavy methods (*yuèshí*).
Pregnancy for nine months weakens tendons and bones, exhausts strength, and repels food, causing emaciation. Heavy methods would harm the already strained body.
*"Do not overfill the excessive"* means draining the fetus’s form would cause *jīng* (essence) to leak, leaving the disease to dominate alone—thus *zhěn* forms.
If the fetus restrains the *bāo*’s collateral, kidney *qi* is blocked. Draining it further would cause kidney essence to deplete, the fetus to perish in the womb, and the remains to linger, leading to solitary dominance—thus *zhěn* arises.

The Sovereign asked: *"A person suffers flank distension with upward-rising *qi*, lasting two or three years—what is this called?"*
Qibo replied: *"This is called *xījī*—it does not obstruct eating, and moxibustion or needling are forbidden. Treatment requires *dǎoyǐn* (guided exercises) and medication; medication alone cannot cure it.
The abdomen is formless, yet the flanks are distended and *qi* reverses, persisting for years. *Xī* (breath) and *jī* (form) intertwine—*qi* reverses, making breath difficult—hence the name *xījī*.
Since *qi* does not reside in the stomach, eating is unaffected. Moxibustion would generate internal heat, transforming *qi* into wind. Needling would disrupt the channels, leading to exhaustion—thus, it is forbidden.
Guided exercises can make *qi* flow, and prolonged medication can internally dissolve stagnation. Only then will it be cured.
If medication is relied upon alone, without guided exercises, it cannot effect a cure."*

The Sovereign asked: *"A person’s body and organs swell, encircling the waist with pain—what is this called?"*
Qibo replied: *"This is called *fúlìang*—due to the *Chōng* channel’s disorder, hence the name.
The *Chōng* channel, along with the *Shào Yīn* (kidney) collateral, originates below the kidney, emerges at the *qìjiē* (hip joint), follows the inner thigh, diagonally enters the *cháng* (uterus), traces the inner edge of the pelvis, and descends with the *Shào Yīn* channel to the inner ankle’s rear, entering the sole.
Its ascending branch emerges below the waist, three *cùn* from the navel (*guānyuán*), beside the waist, ascending straight to the throat, converging with the *Shào Yīn* channel.
Thus, the body and organs swell, encircling the waist with pain—this is called *fúlìang*.
*Huán* means encircling like a ring. This is the root of wind.
Its *qi* overflows into the large intestine, settling in the *huáng* (bladder), whose origin is below the waist—thus, the waist encircles with pain."*

The large intestine—*guǎng cháng*—is indeed the broad intestine. However, when referring to it in the *sutra*, it should be called the *huí cháng* (coiled intestine).

Why so? The *Líng Shū Jīng* states: "The coiled intestine lies at the waist. The right coiled intestine wraps around the leaf-like *jī* (caecum) and descends, while the broad intestine clings to the spine, receiving the coiled intestine. The left coiled intestine wraps around the leaf-like *jī*, ascending and descending with *bì* (divided) clarity and grandeur."

Upon examination, this is the coiled intestine, not the large intestine as commonly spoken. Yet, the large intestine and coiled intestine both harmonize with the lungs, and from this harmony, life is sustained. Therefore, they are collectively called the large intestine. It must not be disturbed, for disturbing it brings the illness of *shuǐ nì sè* (urinary difficulty and constipation).

Since the *Chōng* channel originates below the kidney, emerging at the *qìjiē* (hip joint), and its ascending branch arises from the *bāo* (uterus), ascending to emerge beside the waist at *guānyuán* (the navel region), disturbing it causes urinary difficulty and constipation. "Disturbing" refers to striking the waist with potent poisons or drugs, causing severe downward flux. This passage serves as a repeated explanation of a rare condition, as seen in the *Fù Zhōng Lùn* (Discourse on the Abdomen).

The Emperor asked: "There are cases where the *chě* (cubit) pulse is extremely frequent, the tendons tense, and visible—what illness is this?"

"Tendons tense" refers to the two tendons in the *chě* (cubit) region behind the hand being taut. The *Mài Yào Jīng Wéi Lùn* (Essentials of Pulse Doctrine) states: "The outer cubit pulse reflects the kidney, while the inner cubit pulse reflects the abdomen." Now, if the cubit pulse is frequent and tense, it indicates heat, which should relax the tendons. Instead, the cubit tendons are tense and visible, while abdominal tendons should also be tense—thus, the question arises: why does this occur as an illness?

The *Líng Shū Jīng* answers: "Heat relaxes the tendons, while cold tightens them." *Qí Bó* (Gebber) said: "This is called *zhěn jīn* (tendon contraction). When the tendons of the abdomen contract, and white or black colors appear on the face, the illness is severe. 'Abdominal tendons contract' refers to the tendons beside the waist and within the abdomen all becoming tense. Since the inner cubit pulse reflects the abdomen, if the cubit tendons are tense, the abdominal tendons will also be contracted and rigid. 'Colors appear' refers to their manifestation on the face. The five colors, when observed, white indicates cold, and black also indicates cold; thus, the appearance of these two colors makes the illness even more severe."

The Emperor asked: "There are cases where a person suffers from chronic headaches for several years—what causes this, and what is its name?"

This illness of headache should not persist beyond a month; if it remains unresolved for years, it is strange and thus questioned. *Qí Bó* replied: "This is due to exposure to extreme cold, which penetrates to the bone marrow. The marrow, with the brain as its sovereign, suffers inversion, causing headaches and toothaches. The brain is the marrow, governing the teeth, which are the marrow’s residue. When the brain inverts and cold invades the bones, headaches and toothaches arise. This condition is named *jué nì* (inversion disorder)."

The Emperor said: "Good."

The full annotation states: "The brain first generates the marrow, and since there is marrow, there are bones and teeth, which are the marrow’s root."

The Emperor asked: "There are cases where a person’s mouth tastes sweet—what is the illness called, and how is it acquired?"

*Qí Bó* replied: "This is due to the overflow of the five *qì* (vital energies), named *pí kuàng* (splenic inversion)." *Kuàng* refers to heat. When the spleen is heated, the four *zàng* (viscera) share its influence, causing the five *qì* to overflow upward.

Its origin lies in splenic heat, hence the name *pí kuàng*. When the five flavors enter the mouth, they are stored in the stomach. The spleen distributes their refined *qì* and *jīn yè* (body fluids). Since the spleen holds the fluids, it makes the mouth taste sweet. When splenic heat internally seeps, the fluids linger in the spleen, and the stomach’s nourishment is improperly transformed. The refined *qì* then overflows, and the mouth tastes the spleen’s *qì*, hence the sweetness.

The fluids lingering in the spleen indicate its dampness, which leads to a tendency toward obesity. The new corrected version states: "According to the *Tài Sū*, the condition arises as *shāo kuàng* (consumptive inversion)." Such individuals often consume excessive sweet and fatty foods. Fatty foods obstruct the natural flow, preventing *yáng qì* (yang energy) from dispersing outward, causing internal heat. Sweet foods, with their mild and harmonious nature, can also lead to *zhōng mǎn* (mid-abdominal fullness), as they tend to accumulate and stagnate. Internal heat causes *yáng qì* to rise, leading to thirst and dryness. Mid-abdominal fullness means lingering *chén qì* (stale energy), which then overflows as splenic *qì*, hence the term "the *qì* overflows upward, transforming into *xiāo kuàng* (consumptive disorder)." The *Yīn Yáng Yìng Xiàng Dà Lùn* (Grand Treatise on the Correspondence of Yin and Yang) states: "Acrid and sweet flavors disperse and are yang in nature." The *Líng Shū Jīng* states: "Excessive sweetness in the diet causes *mèn* (stupor)." Yet, this arises from mid-abdominal fullness.

The new corrected version states: "According to the *Jiǎ Yǐ Jīng*, *xiāo kuàng* (consumptive disorder) should be written as *xiāo kuàng* (consumptive inversion)." It is treated with *lán* (orchid), which dispels *chén qì* (stale energy). *Lán* refers to the orchid plant. *Shén Nóng* (Divine Farmer) said: "Orchid is acrid, hot, and balanced. It facilitates waterways, wards off evil omens, and clears phlegm and *bì* (stagnation) from the chest." "Dispels" means to remove. "Stale" refers to lingering energy. Orchid removes the lingering, stagnant sweet and fatty *qì* that cannot be transformed, as its acrid nature disperses.

The *Zàng Qì Fǎ Shí Lùn* (Treatise on the Laws of the Visceral Energies) states: "Acrid is dispersing."

The Emperor asked: "There are cases where a person’s mouth tastes bitter, and *yáng líng quán* (Liver 5, Yang Mound Spring) is treated." What is the illness called, and how is it acquired?

*Qí Bó* replied: "The illness is named *dǎn kuàng* (biliary inversion)." *Kuàng* also means heat. The bile’s flavor is bitter, hence the bitter taste in the mouth.

The new corrected version states: "According to the full *Yī Qǐ* (Rise and Fall) text and *Tài Sū*, there are no six characters: 'mouth tastes bitter, treat at *yáng líng quán*.'" Upon careful examination of the context, this passage is likely erroneous.

The liver is the sovereign of the center, with its authority residing in the gallbladder. The throat serves as its messenger. The *Líng Lán Mì Dìan Lùn* (Secret Canon of the Orchid and Bell) states: "The liver is the sovereign of the center, where planning and contemplation originate. The gallbladder is the central authority, where decisions and judgments emerge. The liver and gallbladder harmonize, their energies interflowing, hence all planning and contemplation follow the gallbladder’s sequence. The throat corresponds to the gallbladder, thus it serves as the messenger."

The new corrected version states: "According to the *Jiǎ Yǐ Jīng*, the gallbladder is the repository of central precision, and the five viscera follow its sequence, with the throat as its messenger." This passage is likely erroneous.

Such individuals often engage in excessive planning and contemplation without decisive action, causing the gallbladder to become depleted and its *qì* to overflow upward, resulting in a bitter taste in the mouth.

The treatment involves the **gallbladder’s *mù*** (acupuncture point) and ***yù*** (back-shu point)**.
The chest and abdomen are called ***mù***, while the back is called ***yù***.
The **gallbladder’s *mù*** lies beneath the nipple, two ribs outward, at the lower edge of the ***Qīmén*** (Gate of Fate), five *cùn* (fingers’ breadth) from the midline of the body.
The ***yù*** is located below the tenth vertebra, with each side one and a half *cùn* from the midline of the body.
This is detailed in the *"Yīnyáng Shí’èr Guān Xiàngshǐ"* (Twelve Officials of Yin and Yang: Correspondences and Messengers).
The text states that the full treatment method is contained therein, but that passage is now lost.

The **Emperor** asked: *"If one has a **yīn** pulse that is fine and faint like hair, this is deficiency. What disease is this? What is its name?"*

**Correction:** Upon closer examination, these fifteen characters were originally a transcription error.
According to the *Jiǎ Yǐ Jīng* and *Tàisū* (Great Essentials), this passage does not exist.
It is actually from **Quán Yuánqǐ’s** annotations, mistakenly transcribed into the text.
Now recorded as a note:

The **Tàiyīn** (Greater Yin) pulse is fine and faint like hair—this is deficiency.
What disease does it manifest?
What is its name?

The **Emperor** asked: *"What does ‘□’ mean? It refers to urinary retention. ‘波’ means frequent urination. ‘颈膺如格’ means the neck and chest feel as though obstructed, as if resisting and failing to harmonize. ‘人迎躁盛’ refers to the pulse at the lateral neck (structural throat), where the pulse is full, tense, and rapid—unusually agitated and swift—this is the stomach pulse.*

*The **Tàiyīn** pulse, fine and faint like hair, refers to the pulse at the radial side of the thumb’s proximal phalanx, one *cùn* above the wrist crease. This is the lung pulse, the proper channel of **Tàiyīn** hand pulse, through which the five **zàng** (viscera) may be diagnosed.*

**Qíbó** said: *"When disease is in **Tàiyīn**, its excess lies in the stomach, its root in the lung. The disease is called *jué* (syncope), and if it occurs, it is untreatable. Frequent urination, body heat like burning charcoal, neck and chest obstruction, and labored breathing with inverted *qi*—all these indicate that the **Tàiyīn** pulse should be surging and robust, yet now it is instead fine and faint like hair. This is a contradiction between disease and pulse. How does this arise?*

*It is due to the lung’s inverted *qi* overwhelming the stomach, causing the *rényíng* pulse to surge violently. Hence, it is said that the disease is in **Tàiyīn**, with its excess in the stomach. Because of the wheezing and inverted *qi*, it is also said to involve the lung. Since the disease arises from inverted *qi* and the symptoms do not correspond, it is named *jué* (syncope), and death is inevitable. This is what is called ‘five excesses and two deficiencies.’"*

The **Emperor** asked: *"What are these ‘five excesses and two deficiencies’?"*

**Qíbó** replied: *"The ‘five excesses’ refer to the five diseases of excess *qi*, and the ‘two deficiencies’ refer to the two diseases of deficient *qi*. Now, externally there are five excesses, internally there are two deficiencies. Thus, the body is neither superficial nor deep—this is clearly a death sentence. The five external excesses are: 1) body heat like burning charcoal, 2) neck and chest obstruction, 3) surging *rényíng* pulse, 4) wheezing, and 5) inverted *qi*. The two internal deficiencies are: 1) frequent urination (as if ‘波’), and 2) the **Tàiyīn** pulse being fine and faint like hair. If the disease is said to be superficial, then internally there are two deficiencies; if it is said to be deep, then externally there are five excesses. Since neither superficial nor deep treatment can be applied, and supplementation or purgation is impossible, it is said that this is clearly a death sentence."*

The **Emperor** asked: *"If a person is born with *diān* (convulsive) disease, what is its name? How is it contracted? All diseases arise from wind, rain, cold, heat, yin, yang, joy, or anger. Yet before encountering pathogenic *qi*, a newborn already has *diān*—could this be from congenital injury?"* (Thus, he asked.)

*‘Diān’ refers to the upper *diān* (head).*

**Qíbó** said: *"The disease is called *táibìng* (congenital disease). This is contracted when, in the mother’s womb, she experiences a great fright, causing her *qi* to rise but not descend, with essence and *qi* converging, thus making the child manifest *diān* (convulsions). ‘Essence and *qi*’ refers to the yang essence and *qi*."*

The **Emperor** asked: *"There is a disease where the face appears bloated and mottled, like water, with a pulse that is large and taut, yet the body feels no pain, does not emaciate, cannot eat much, and eats little. What is its name?"*

*‘□然’ means the face is swollen and discolored. ‘Large and taut’ means like a drawn bowstring. The *qi* is cold and internally invasive, yet there is no pain—this differs from common cases, hence the repeated inquiry.*

**Qíbó** said: *"The disease originates in the kidney and is called *shènfēng* (kidney wind). The pulse is taut like a bowstring, large and tense, with labored *qi* internally accumulating, cold further invading, and labored *qi* clashing with cold. This transforms into wind, and since wind overcomes the kidney, it is called *shènfēng*. When *shènfēng* occurs, the patient cannot eat, is prone to startling, and if startled, their heart *qi* collapses—death follows. Kidney water receives wind, and heart fire weakens; fire and water are both exhausted, hence death again."* The **Emperor** said: *"Understood."*

**The *Daqi* (Great Marvels) Treatise**

When the liver, kidney, and lungs are all **full** (i.e., their *qi* is **full** and **replete**), it is called **swelling** (i.e., **generalized edema**).
**Full** refers to the pulse *qi* being **full** and **replete**. **Swelling** refers to **diffuse edema**.

When the **stored *qi*** is **full**, it manifests thus:
The **fullness of the lungs** (*fèiyōng*) causes **dyspnea**, with the **two axillae** (i.e., **both armpits**) **full**.

The lungs **store *qi*** and externally govern **breathing**; their **collateral branches**, diverging from the main meridians, emerge from the **lung system** and spread beneath the **axillae** (#1), hence **dyspnea** and **fullness in both axillae**.

**New verification** states: In the case of *fèiyōng* (lung fullness), *gānyōng* (liver fullness), and *shènfèng* (kidney fullness), the *Jia-Yi Jing* (a lost medical text) all render as **痈** (*yōng*).

**Liver fullness** (*gānyōng*) presents as **fullness in both flanks**, externally marked by **startling** (i.e., **easily frightened**), and **inability to urinate**. The liver’s meridian travels along the **inner thigh**, enters the **pelvis**, encircles the **genital region**, reaches the **lower abdomen**, ascends through the **liver’s upper cavity**, and spreads across the **ribs and flanks**, hence **flank fullness** and **inability to urinate**. The liver governs **startling and terror**, hence the external **startling**.

**Kidney fullness** (*shènfèng*) manifests as **fullness in the lower abdomen extending to the feet** (i.e., **generalized lower abdominal and leg fullness**).
**New verification** states: According to the *Jia-Yi Jing*, the phrase should read **"脑下"** (*nǎoxià*, beneath the brain) instead of **"脚下"** (*jiǎoxià*, beneath the feet). The **lower abdomen** (i.e., **flanks**) should not be described as **"脚下至少腹"** (*jiǎoxià shǎo fù*, beneath the feet, lower abdomen).

When the **cavities** (i.e., **body spaces**) are **large or small**, the **organs and viscera** (i.e., **internal structures**) become **severely weakened** (i.e., **easily prone to atrophy or paralysis**), leading to **lateral atrophy** (i.e., **hemiplegia**).

The **penetrating and nourishing vessels** (i.e., **the Conception and Governing Vessels**, *chōngyǒng* and *dàimài*), as the **sea of the meridians**, along with the **collaterals of the Lesser Yin** (i.e., **kidney meridian**), all originate beneath the **kidney**, emerge at the **Qi Street** (i.e., **the region between the anus and genitals**), and follow the **inner thigh’s medial aspect** (*yīn gǔ nèi kāng*). They then **slant inward to the pelvis**, traverse the **medial aspect of the hip bone**, and, parallel to the **Lesser Yin meridian**, descend behind the **inner ankle** and enter beneath the **foot**. Their **ascending branches** emerge at **three inches below the navel** on the **midline of the torso**.

Thus, it manifests as described.

If the **blood and qi** (*xuèqì*) undergo abnormal changes, it results in **hemiplegia** (*piānxū*).

When the **Heart meridian** (*xīn mài*) is **full and large** (*mǎn dà*), the **atrophy** (*jí*) heals, but **muscle spasms** (*jīn luán*) persist. If the **Heart meridian** is **full and large**, then **Liver qi** (*gān qì*) descends below, **heat qi** (*rè qì*) accumulates internally, muscles wither and blood dries up—thus, **pain and spasms** (*tòng téng ér jīn luán*) arise. When the **Liver meridian** (*gān mài*) is **small and urgent** (*xiǎo jí*), it manifests as **spasms** (*jīn luán*) with **virtue/power** (*dé*) in the tendons. The **Liver** nourishes the tendons and internally stores the blood; when **Liver qi** is exposed to cold, **pain responds** (*tòng yìng*) and the tendons **twist** (*jīn nuǎn*).

When the pulse is **small and urgent** (*xiǎo jí*), it signifies **cold** (*hán*). If the **Liver meridian** becomes **violent and urgent** (*wò bào*), there is **fright or alarm** (*jīnghè*); **violent** (*wò*) refers to **restless agitation** (*chíwò*), indicating its **rapid urgency** (*suí jí*). When **Yang qi** (*yáng qì*) accumulates internally, it manifests as **fright** (*jīng*). If the pulse does not arrive but the **condition subsides** (*cháng*), it will self-correct.

When **Liver qi** (*gān qì*) **faints** (*jué*), the pulse becomes **obstructed** (*mài bù tōng*); upon **recovery** (*jué tuì*), the pulse resumes flow. Moreover, its branches spread across the **ribcage** (*xié lèi*) and follow behind the **throat** (*hóu láng*), so if the pulse does not arrive but the **atrophy** (*jí*) is **subsided** (*zì jǐ*), it too will self-correct.

If the **Kidney meridian** (*shèn mài*), **Liver meridian**, and **Heart meridian** are all **small and urgent**, and none **beat rhythmically** (*bù gǔ*), it results in **congealed blood** (*hù*). **Small and urgent** signifies **severe cold** (*hán shèn*); if the pulse does not beat, blood does not flow, and when blood does not flow, **cold accumulates** (*hán bó*), causing **congealed blood** (*xuè nèi níng*)—thus forming **congealed blood** (*hù*).

When the **Kidney** and **Liver** are both **depressed** (*bìng chén*), it forms **stone water** (*shí shuǐ*). The **Liver meridian** enters the **Yin region** (*yīn nèi*), traversing the **lower abdomen** (*xiǎo fù*), while the **Kidney meridian** pierces the **center of the spine** (*zhī lǐ zhōng*), connecting with the **Bladder** (*pángguāng*). When both **organs** (*zàng*) are affected, their **qi** (*qì*) relies on the **Conception Vessel** (*chōng mài*), which from the **Kidney** below connects with the **uterus** (*bāo*), obstructing the **transformation and flow of water** (*shuǐ bù xínghuà*). Thus, it becomes **firm and congealed** (*jiān ér jié*). Since the **Kidney** governs water, and water in winter becomes ice, water originates from the **Kidney** (*shuǐ zōng yú shèn*), and the **Kidney** symbolizes water while **depressed** (*wèi*), hence the **qi** converges and sinks, named **stone water** (*shí shuǐ*).

If the pulse is **converged and floating** (*bìng fú*), it is **wind water** (*fēng shuǐ*). **Floating** (*fú*) signifies **wind** (*fēng*); the **lower burner** (*xià jiāo*) governs water, and **wind** accumulates below—thus named **wind water**.

If the pulse is **converged and empty** (*bìng xū*), it is **deadly** (*sǐ*). The **Kidney** is the **root of the five Zang** (*wǔ zàng*), and the **Liver** is the **master of generation** (*fāshēng zhǔ*); when both are deficient, the **principles of life** (*shēng zhǔ*) are exhausted—thus death.

If the pulse is **small and taut, threatening fright** (*xiǎo xián yù jīng*), it signifies that both **Liver** and **Kidney** are deficient.

When the **Kidney meridian** (*shèn mài*) is **large and urgent, depressed** (*dà jí chén*), or the **Liver meridian** is **large and urgent, depressed** (*dà jí chén*), it results in **hernia** (*shàn*). **Hernia** is caused by **cold qi** (*hán qì*) congealing. When **pulse is taut** (*mài xián*) for **fullness** (*shí*), and **urgent** (*jí*) for **pain** (*tòng*), **fullness** and **cold accumulation** (*qì shí hán bó*) cause **twisting pain** (*jiǎo tòng*)—thus **hernia** (*shàn*).

If the **Heart meridian** (*xīn mài*) **beats and slides urgently** (*bó huá jí*), it is **Heart hernia** (*xīn shàn*). If the **Lung meridian** (*fèi mài*) is **depressed and beats** (*chén bó*), it is **Lung hernia** (*fèi shàn*). All are due to **cold accumulation** (*hán bó*) in the **organs** (*zàng*).

When the **three Yang meridians** (*sān yáng*) are **urgent**, it results in **congealed blood** (*hù*); when the **three Yin meridians** (*sān yīn*) are **urgent**, it results in **hernia** (*shàn*). If the **Greater Yang** (*tài yáng*) receives **cold**, blood congeals into **congealed blood** (*hù*). If the **Greater Yin** (*tài yīn*) receives **cold**, **qi** congeals into **hernia** (*shàn*). When the **two Yin meridians** (*èr yīn*)—i.e., the **Lesser Yin** (*shǎo yīn*)—are **urgent**, it results in **epileptic fainting** (*yǐn jué*); when the **two Yang meridians** (*èr yáng*)—i.e., the **Yang Brightness** (*yáng míng*)—are **urgent**, it results in **fright** (*jīng*).

When the **Spleen meridian** (*pí mài*) **beats externally and is depressed** (*wài gǔ chén*), it results in **intestinal atrophy** (*cháng pì*), which **self-corrects over time** (*jiǔ zì jǐ*). **Beats externally** (*wài gǔ*) refers to **pulsation on the outer arm** (*gǔdòng yú bì wài*).

If the **Liver meridian** is **small and relaxed** (*xiǎo huǎn*), it results in **intestinal atrophy** (*cháng pì*), which is **easily treatable**. **Small and relaxed** signifies the **Spleen** overacting upon the **Liver** (*pí chéng gān*), thus it is easily treatable.

If the **Kidney meridian** is **small and beats, depressed** (*xiǎo bó chén*), it results in **intestinal atrophy with bleeding** (*cháng pì xià xuè*). **Small** indicates **Yin qi deficiency** (*yīn qì bùzú*), while **beats** (*bó*) signifies **Yang qi overacting** (*yáng qì chéng zhī*); **heat** resides in the **lower burner** (*xià jiāo*), hence the bleeding.

If the **blood is warm** (*xuè wēn*) and the **body is hot** (*shēn rè*), it is **deadly**.

**Intestinal atrophy** (*cháng pì*) from the **Heart** and **Liver** also causes bleeding. The **Liver** stores blood, and the **Heart** nourishes blood—thus, **atrophy** (*pì*) in both results in bleeding.

When **two organs** (*èr zàng*) suffer the same ailment, it is **treatable**. The **Heart’s fire** and **Liver’s wood** (*xīn huǒ gān mù*) mutually generate—thus it is treatable.

If the pulse is **small, depressed, and rough** (*xiǎo chén sè*), it is **intestinal prolapse** (*cháng liàn*). If the **Heart** and **Liver meridians** are **small and depressed, rough** (*xiǎo sè*), it is **prolapse** (*liàn*). If the **body is hot** (*shēn rè*), it is **deadly**. **Heat** appears on the **seventh day** (*qī rì sè*), for **prolapse** with bleeding and **body heat** signifies **fire qi exhaustion** (*huǒ qì nèi jué*), leaving the **Heart** and turning outward—thus death. **Fire** completes its cycle in **seven days** (*huǒ chéng qī rì*), hence death on the **seventh day**.

If the **Stomach meridian** (*wèi mài*) is **depressed, beats, and rough** (*chén gǔ sè*), and the **Stomach’s external pulse is large** (*wèi wài gǔ dà*), or the **Heart meridian** is **small and taut** (*xīn mài xiǎo jiān jí*), it results in **hemiplegia** (*biān qū*). **Beats externally** refers to **pulsation beyond the standard cubit measure**, striking the **outer arm** (*gǔjī yú bì wài cè*).

In males, **symptoms appear on the left**; in females, on the **right**. **Yang** governs the **left**, and **Yin** governs the **right**—thus the distinction. The *Yīn-Yáng Yìng Xiàng Dà Lùn* states: *"Left and right are the pathways of Yin and Yang."* This is its meaning.

If **speech is obstructed** (*bù □ yán*) and the **tongue turns** (*shé zhuǎn*), it is **treatable**, with recovery in **thirty days**. In **hemiplegia**, if **speech is obstructed** (*□ bù néng yán*), it signifies that the **Kidney** and **uterus meridians** are **internally exhausted** (*nèi jué*). The **uterus meridian** (*bāo mài*) is linked to the **Kidney**; the **Kidney meridian** ascends from the **Kidney**, pierces the **Liver**, enters the **Lung**, follows behind the **throat**, and is adjacent to the **tongue’s root** (*xié shé běn*). Thus, when **qi is exhausted internally**, speech becomes obstructed.

If the **symptoms follow** (*cóng*), it is **congealed blood** (*chuāng*), with recovery in **three years**. **Follow** refers to males manifesting on the **left** and females on the **right**. If the disease progresses **according to left and right** (*shùn zuǒyòu ér jí*), resulting in **obstructed speech** (*bù néng yán*), it can be treated within **three years** to achieve recovery.

If the patient is **under twenty years old** (*nián bù mǎn èrshí*), **three years of illness** is **deadly**. Since the **five Zang** are not yet fully established, and **blood and qi** are still **rigid and strong** (*xuèqì fāng gāng*), the **Zang** are easily injured, and the **qi** is greatly strained—thus, illness lasting **three years** leads to death.

If the pulse arrives and **beats rhythmically**, but **blood is exhausted** (*xuè niǔ*) and the **body is hot** (*shēn rè*), it is **deadly**. **Exhausted blood** (*xuè niǔ*) signifies **emptiness** (*xū*); the pulse should not respond to **beating** (*bó*), but if it **beats rhythmically** (*fǎn mài bó*), it indicates **qi exhaustion** (*qì jí nǎi rán*)—thus death.

If the pulse comes **suspended like a hook, floating** (*xián gōu fú*), it is the **common pulse** (*cháng mài*).

If the pulse arrives **like panting** (*rú chuǎn*), it is called **sudden fainting** (*bào jué*). **Panting** (*chuǎn*) refers to **abrupt, intense arrival** (*zú lái shèng jí*), fading quickly—like the **breathing of a gasping person**. **Sudden fainting** renders the patient **unable to speak with others**.

If the pulse arrives **like counting** (*rú shǔ*), it causes **sudden fright** (*bào jīng*). A **counting pulse** (*shǔ*) signifies **heat** (*rè*), which internally agitates the **Liver and Heart**—thus **fright**. It **self-corrects in three to four days**. **Counting** refers to the **Heart meridian**; **wood** (Liver) is **dried by fire** (Heart), and the disease is not **Liver-generated** (*bìng fēi gān shēng*) nor **joined with evil** (*bù yǔ xié hé*)—thus it **self-corrects after three to four days**.

---

Thus it is so: **wood** (Liver) **generates a counting pulse** (*shǔ*) for three days.

If the pulse arrives **floating and merging** (*fú hé*), like waves merging on the surface, the later arrivals **overtake the earlier ones** (*hòu zhì zhě líng qián*), moving swiftly and without regular pattern.

A **floating-merge pulse** (*fú hé*) like counting—ten arrivals or more per breath—indicates **insufficient channel-qi** (*jīng qì yǔ bù zú*), a slight sign of death within ninety days.

If the pulse arrives **like blazing firewood** (*rú xiānrán*), it is the **Heart’s vital essence** (*xīn jīng*) being **consumed and depleted** (*yǔ dué*). When grass dries and dies, so too does the pulse.

The flames of blazing firewood (*xiānrán*) flicker (*biē biē*) without fixed form, then **cease abruptly** (*ér biàn jué*). **Flames** (*yàn*), pronounced *guò niàn*.

If the pulse arrives **like scattered leaves** (*rú sǎn yè*), it signifies **insufficient Liver-qi** (*gān qì yǔ xū*), where **wood leaves fall** and the pulse dies. Like leaves scattered by the wind, it lacks a fixed pattern.

**Revised annotation** (*xīn jiào zhèng yún*): According to the *Jia Yi Jing* (*甲乙经*), **scattered leaves** (*sǎn yè*) is written as **clustered thorns** (*cóng jì*).

If the pulse arrives **like a departing guest** (*rú xǐng kè*), a **departing-guest pulse** (*xǐng kè*) is **blocked yet resonant** (*mài sè ér gǔ*), indicating **insufficient Kidney-qi** (*shèn qì yǔ bù zú*), death occurring when the **sprouts of jujube** (*zǎo huá*) are **suspended** (*xuán*). **Suspended** (*xuán*) refers to the pulse **like a hanging object**—when the object moves, it **snaps away** (*jué qù*).

If the pulse arrives **like a horizontal beam** (*rú héng gé*), it indicates **insufficient Gallbladder-qi** (*dǎn qì yǔ bù zú*), death occurring when **grain ripens** (*hé shú*). The pulse is **long and firm**, like a **horizontal wooden beam beneath the fingers**.

If the pulse arrives **like a taut thread** (*rú xián lǚ*), it signifies **insufficient uterine essence** (*bāo jīng yǔ bù zú*). The patient **speaks readily** (*bìng shàn yán*), dying when **frost descends**; if **silent, it may be treated** (*bù yán kě zhì*). The **uterus’s pulse** (*bāo zhī mài*) connects to the **Kidney**, whose pulse **flanks the tongue’s root** (*qì bù zú zhě, zé dāng bù néng yán*). If the patient **speaks readily instead**, it means **true-qi has internally perished** (*zhēn qì nèi jué*), **leaving the Kidney** and **returning externally to the tongue**—hence death.

If the pulse arrives **like crossed lacquer** (*rú jiāo qī*), a **crossed-lacquer pulse** (*jiāo qī*) comes from **left and right arrivals** (*zuǒ yòu bàng zhì*), a slight sign of death within thirty days. The pulse arrives **as if traversing lacquer’s crossings** (*yán rú lì qī zhī jiāo*), left and right **contradicting each other**.

**Revised annotation** (*xīn jiào zhèng yún*): According to the *Jia Yi Jing* (*甲乙经*), **crossed lacquer** (*jiāo qī*) is written as **crossed immediately** (*jiāo jí*).

If the pulse arrives **like a gushing spring** (*rú yǒng quán*), **floating and resonant within the flesh** (*fú gǔ jī zhōng*), it indicates **insufficient Taiyang-qi** (*tài yáng qì yǔ bù zú*), where **vitality and flavor diminish** (*shǎo qì wèi*), death occurring when **chives bloom** (*jiǔ yīng*). Like a **spring’s movement**—water **flows out but does not return**.

If the pulse arrives **like crumbling earth** (*rú tuí tǔ*), pressing yields **no resistance** (*àn zhī bù dé*), signifying **insufficient muscle-qi** (*jī qì yǔ bù zú*). The patient’s **complexion first turns black**, then **white patches appear**, leading to death.

**Crumbling earth** (*tuí tǔ*) refers to the **excessively large and hollow pulse** (*fú zhī dà ér xū yáo tuí tǔ zhì*), pressing reveals **nothingness**.

**Revised annotation** (*xīn jiào zhèng yún*): According to the *Jia Yi Jing* (*甲乙经*), **crumbling earth** (*tuí tǔ*) is written as **collapsed earth** (*wěi tǔ*).

If the pulse arrives **like a hanging uvula** (*rú xuán yīng*), a **hanging-uvula pulse** (*xuán yīng*) is **floating yet exaggerated** (*fú chuài qiè zhī yì dà*), indicating **insufficient qi of the twelve acupuncture points** (*shí èr xū yǔ bù zú*), death occurring when **water congeals** (*shuǐ níng*). Like the **uvula suspended in the forehead** (*rú sǎng zhōng zhī xuán yīng*).

**Revised annotation** (*xīn jiào zhèng yún*): According to the **full text of Yuan Qi’s annotations** (*quán yuán qǐ běn*), **hanging uvula** (*xuán yīng*) is written as **hanging divergence** (*xuán lí*).

**Yuan Qi’s note** (*yuán qǐ zhù yún*): **Hanging divergence** (*xuán lí*) refers to the pulse **not harmonizing with the flesh** (*mài yǔ ròu bù xiāng dé*).

If the pulse arrives **like a resting blade** (*rú yǎn dāo*), it indicates **five viscera** (*wǔ zàng*) **near completion** (*wǎn shú*), where **cold and heat converge upon the Kidney** (*hán rè dú bìng yú shèn*), the patient **cannot sit** (*rú qí rén bù dé zuò*), dying at the **beginning of spring** (*lì chūn*).

**Completion** (*shú*) means **accumulation** (*jiān*); **near completion** (*wǎn shú*) means **heat**.

If the pulse arrives **like a rolling bead** (*rú wán huá bù zhí shǒu*), a **non-straightening pulse** (*bù zhí shǒu*) means **pressing finds no fixed form** (*àn zhī bù néng dé*), signifying **insufficient Large Intestine-qi** (*dà cháng qì yǔ bù zú*), death occurring when **jujube leaves grow** (*zǎo yè shēng*).

If the pulse arrives **like a flower** (*rú huā*), the patient **easily becomes fearful** (*lìng rén shàn kǒng*), **avoiding sitting outside** (*bù yù zuò wài*), yet **constantly standing and listening** (*xíng lì cháng tīng*), indicating **insufficient Small Intestine-qi** (*xiǎo cháng qì yǔ bù zú*), death occurring in **late autumn** (*jì qiū*).

**Like a flower** (*rú huā*) refers to the pulse **appearing hollow and weak** (*sì huā xū ruò*), **unable to be grasped firmly** (*bù kě zhèng qǔ*). The **Small Intestine’s pulse** (*xiǎo cháng zhī mài*) **ascends into the ear** (*shàng rù ěr zhōng*), hence the **constant listening**.

---

**Taiyang Pulse Patterns** (*Tài yáng mài jiě piān*)

The **Taiyang** (*tài yáng*) **pulse** is said to cause **swollen waist and tender buttocks** (*zhǒng yāo yǎ tòng zhě*), occurring in the **first month** (*zhèng yuè*), when **Taiyang** (*tài yáng*) **is in the Tiger hour** (*yín*). **Tiger hour** (*yín*) is **Taiyang** (*tài yáng*).

In the **first month** (*zhèng yuè*), the **three Yang channels** (*sān yáng*) **emerge**, governing **the Tiger hour** (*jiàn yín*). The **three Yang** (*sān yáng*) are called **Taiyang** (*tài yáng*), hence **Tiger hour Taiyang** (*yín tài yáng*).

In the first month, **Yang-qi rises above** (*yáng qì chū zài shàng*), while **Yin-qi predominates** (*yīn qì shèng*), **Yang not yet regaining its natural order** (*yáng wèi dé zì cì*).

Though the **first month** (*zhèng yuè*) **has three Yang emerging** (*sān yáng shēng*), the **heavenly energy remains cold** (*tiān qì shàng hán*), hence **Yin-qi predominates while Yang does not yet regain its natural order** (*yīn qì shèng yáng wèi dé zì cì*). **Natural order** (*cì*) refers to **the establishment of the sovereign** (*lì wáng zhī cì*).

Thus, **swollen waist and tender buttocks** (*zhǒng yāo yǎ tòng*) occur. The **pulse presses against the waist** (*yǐ qí mài dǐ yāo zhōng*), **penetrates into the buttocks** (*rù guàn tūn*), passing **through the □ pivot** (*guò □shū*), hence it is so.

If the **disease manifests as a half-empty condition** (*bìng piān xū wéi bǒ*), causing **limping** (*bǒ*), it is because in the **first month**, **Yang-qi thaws and resolves** (*yáng qì dòng jiě*), while **earth-qi emerges** (*dì qì ér chū*). The **half-empty condition** (*piān xū*) refers to those who **have some deficiency from winter’s cold** (*dōng hán pō yǒu bù zú zhě*), hence **limping from a half-empty condition** (*gù piān xū wéi bǒ*).

The **pulse follows the inner thigh** (*yǐ qí mài xún tuǐ nèi hòu kàng*), **merges with the hip** (*hé qiān zhōng*), **descends along the calf** (*xià xún lǚ*), passing **behind the outer ankle** (*guò wài lì hòu*), then **along the lateral malleolus to the outer side of the little toe** (*xún jīng gǔ zhì xiǎo zhǐ wài cè*). Thus it is so.

「○ The newly corrected edition states: Upon examining Master Wang’s account, his claim that the pulse follows the inner thigh (*xún gǔ nèi*) is incorrect. According to the *Jiā-Yǐ Jīng* (Canon of the A-B Branches), the **Taiyang meridian flows downward** (*tài yáng liú zhù*), not reaching the inner thigh. The inner thigh (*gǔ nèi*) is a mistaken reference to the **spleen’s external pathway** (*pí wài*); it should read **outer thigh, posterior border** (*xiǎng wài hòu lián*). The phrase **"strong upward, drawing the back"** (*qiáng shàng yǐn bèi*) refers to **excessive Yang-qi ascending and contending** (*yáng qì dà shàng ér zhēng*), hence the "strong upward" (*qiáng shàng*). "Strong upward" means **stiffness in the neck and nape** (*jìng xiàng jìn qiáng*). In severe cases, it **draws the back** (*yǐn bèi*). This occurs because its **pulse originates from the brain** (*yǐ qí mài cóng nǎo chū*), diverges downward to the **nape and back** (*bié xià xiàng bèi*), hence the condition.

The phrase **"ear buzzing"** (*ěr wū*) arises when **Yang-qi ascends vigorously to the upper regions, leaping** (*yáng qì wàn wù shèng shàng ér yuè*), hence the buzzing. This is due to its **branching pathway** (*yǐ qí mài zhī bìé zhě*), which **extends from the crown to the upper angle of the ear** (*cóng diān zhì ěr shàng jiǎo*), hence the buzzing.

The phrase **"severe cases lead to frenzied crown and foot illness"** (*shèn zé jiāng diān jì*) refers to **Yang-qi fully ascending while Yin-qi remains below** (*yáng jìn zài shàng ér yīn qì cóng xià*), resulting in **lower deficiency and upper excess** (*xià xū shàng shí*), hence the frenzied crown and foot illness. Its **pulse ascends to the forehead and intersects the crown above** (*yǐ qí mài shàng é jiāo diān shàng, rù lùo nǎo hái chū*), before its **branching pathway diverges from the crown to the upper angle of the ear** (*yǐ qí mài zhī bìé zhě, xià diān zhì ěr shàng jiǎo*). Hence, the frenzied crown and foot illness. The **crown** (*diān*) is the **top of the head** (*dǐng shàng*).

The phrase **"floating leads to deafness"** (*fú wéi lóng*) is entirely due to **Qi imbalance** (*jiē zài qì yě*). This also occurs because its **pulse reaches the ear** (*yǐ qí mài zhì ěr*).

The phrase **"entering the center leads to muteness"** (*rù zhōng wéi jì*) arises when **Yang-qi, though initially excessive, now declines** (*yáng shèng yǐ shuāi*), hence the muteness. When **Yang-qi is excessive but waning**, it **fails to nourish the uterus and kidneys** (*rù zhōng ér bó yú bāo shèn*), causing **blockage in the uterine and kidney collaterals** (*bāo luò shèn luò qì bù tōng*), hence the muteness. The **uterus’ pulse connects to the kidneys** (*bāo zhī mài xì yú shèn*), and the **kidneys’ pulse runs alongside the root of the tongue** (*shèn zhī mài xiá shé běn*), hence the **muteness and inability to speak** (*jì bù néng yán*). When **Yin-qi is internally disrupted and leads to syncope** (*nèi duó ér jué*), it results in **muteness and limping** (*jì pái*), which is a sign of **kidney deficiency** (*cǐ shèn xū yě*). "Limping" here means **foot paralysis** (*pái, fèi yě*). The **kidney’s pulse emerges alongside the Chong meridian** (*shèn zhī mài yǔ chōng mài bìng chū yú qì jiē*), following the **inner thigh’s posterior border** (*xún yīn gǔ nèi hòu kàng*), obliquely entering the **hip’s center** (*xié rù qiān zhōng*), descending along the **inner border of the calf’s bone** (*xún fǔ gǔ nèi lián jí nèi lì hòu*), and entering the **sole of the foot** (*rù zú xià*). Thus, when **kidney-qi is internally disrupted and fails to flow smoothly** (*shèn qì nèi tuō, zé shèn xū*), the **tongue becomes mute and the foot paralyzed** (*shé jì zú fèi*), hence the saying, "This is kidney deficiency." ○ The newly corrected edition states: Upon examining Master Wang’s annotation, which claims the **kidney’s pulse emerges alongside the Chong meridian** (*shèn zhī mài yǔ chōng mài bìng chū*), according to the *Jiā-Yǐ Jīng*, this is actually the **kidney’s collateral** (*shèn zhī luò*), not the **kidney’s pulse** (*shèn zhī mài*). Moreover, in Wang’s annotations of the *Wěi Lùn* (Treatise on Flaccidity), *Qí Bìng Lùn* (Treatise on Miscellaneous Diseases), and *Dà Qí Lùn* (Treatise on Major Miscellaneous Diseases), it is also stated that this is the **kidney’s collateral**. Therefore, the term **pulse** (*mài*) here should be corrected to **collateral** (*luò*).

When **Shaoyin fails to reach** (*shào yīn bù zhì*), it leads to **syncope** (*jué yě*). **Shaoyin** is the **kidney’s pulse** (*shèn mài yě*). If **kidney-qi internally collapses** (*ruò shèn qì nèi tuō*), then the **Shaoyin pulse fails to reach** (*shào yīn zhī mài bù zhì*). When the **Shaoyin pulse fails to reach**, the **Taiyin-qi reverses and ascends** (*shào yīn zhī mài bù zhì, zé tài yīn zhī qì nì shàng ér xíng yě*).

Regarding **Shaoyang**, the phrase **"heart and rib pain"** (*xīn xié tòng*) indicates **Shaoyang excess** (*shǎo yáng shèng yě*). Excess manifests as **symptoms of the heart** (*shèng zhě xīn zhī suǒ biǎo yě*). When **heart-qi reverses** (*xīn qì nì*), it aligns with **Shaoyang excess** (*shǎo yáng shèng*). The **heart’s qi belongs to Wood** (*xīn qì yí mù*), which externally **consumes the Lung’s Metal** (*wài chuò fèi jīn*), hence excess manifests as symptoms of the heart. In the **ninth month**, **Yang-qi is exhausted while Yin-qi thrives** (*jiǔ yuè yáng qì jìn ér yīn qì shèng*), hence the heart and rib pain. The **foot Shaoyang pulse** (*zú shǎo yáng mài*) follows the **rib’s lateral region** (*xún xié kuàng*), emerging from the **Qi Street** (*qì jiē*), while the **heart’s pulse** (*xīn zhǔ mài*) follows the **chest and emerges at the ribs** (*xún xiōng chū xié*). Fire is **buried in the hour of Xu** (*wù yú wèi*), hence in the ninth month, **Yang-qi is exhausted while Yin-qi thrives**.

The phrase **"unable to turn or roll over"** (*bù néng fǎn cè*) arises because **Yin-qi stores and conceals** (*yīn qì cáng wù yě*). When **things are concealed and stored**, they **do not move** (*wù cáng zé bù dòng*), hence the inability to turn or roll over.

The phrase **"severe cases lead to leaping"** (*shèn zé yuè*) refers to **jumping or leaping** (*yuè, wèi tiào yuè yě*). In the **ninth month**, **all things are exhausted and waning** (*jiǔ yuè wàn wù jìn shuāi*), **grasses and trees wither and fall** (*cǎo mù bì luò ér duò*), causing **Qi to shift from Yang to Yin** (*qì qù yáng ér zhī yīn*). When **Yin-qi is excessive and Yang-qi below grows long**, it results in **leaping** (*yù yuè*). This is also because its **pulse follows the spleen’s Yang** (*yǐ qí mài xún pí yáng*), emerging from the **outer thigh’s posterior border** (*shàng xī guò wài lì hòu*), descending to the **front of the outer ankle** (*xià rù wài fǔ zhī qián*), and directly downward to the **end of the Jue bone** (*zhí xià dǐ jué gǔ zhī duān*), emerging from the **front of the outer ankle** (*xià chū wài lì zhī qián*), and following the **outer side of the foot** (*xún zú fù*). When **Qi is excessive**, it causes **jumping or leaping** (*zuò qì shèng zé lìng rén tiào yuè*).

Regarding **Yangming**, the phrase **"shaking and trembling with cold"** (*sǎ sǎ zhèn hán*) refers to **Yangming as the hour of Wu** (*yáng míng zhě wǔ yě*), which is **the Yin of the flourishing Yang of the fifth month** (*wǔ yuè shèng yáng zhī yīn yě*). When **Yang-qi is flourishing**, it is called **Wu** (*yáng shèng yǐ míng, gù yún wǔ yě*). In the **fifth month**, at the **summer solstice** (*wǔ yuè xià zhì*), **Yin-qi ascends while Yang-qi descends** (*yī yīn qì shàng, yáng qì jiàng xià*), hence it is called **the Yin of the flourishing Yang of the fifth month**. When **Yang-qi is flourishing but Yin-qi additionally ascends**, it results in **shaking and trembling with cold** (*jiǔ jiǔ zhèn hán*). Yang-qi descends and Yin-qi ascends, hence it is said, **"Yang-qi is flourishing while Yin-qi additionally ascends"** (*yáng qì xià, yīn qì shēng, gù yún yáng qì shèng ér yīn qì jiā zhī yě*).

The phrase **"meridian swelling while the thigh does not contract"** (*jīng zhǒng ér gǔ bù shōu*) is due to **the fifth month’s flourishing Yang and its Yin** (*shì wǔ yuè shèng yáng zhī yīn yě*). In the fifth month, **Yang-qi begins to decline** (*yáng zhě shuāi yú wǔ yuè*), while **Yin-qi ascends and begins to contend with Yang** (*yī yīn qì shàng, yǔ yáng shǐ zhēng*), hence the **meridian swelling while the thigh does not contract**. Its **pulse descends from the spleen, reaching the Fudou** (*yǐ qí mài xià pí dǐ fú dōu*), descending into the **center of the knee** (*xià rù xī tǐ zhōng*), descending along the **outer thigh’s posterior border** (*xià xún fǔ wài lián*), descending to the **outer side of the foot** (*xià zú fù*), and entering the **inner interval of the middle toe** (*rù zhōng zhǐ nèi jiān*). Its **branching pathway diverges** (*yòu qí bìé zhě*) three inches below the knee (*xià xī sān cùn ér bié*), descending to the **outer interval of the middle toe** (*xià rù zhōng zhǐ wài wèn*).」

Thus it follows. What is meant by **"upper dyspnea and water formation"** is that **Yin-qi descends and then ascends again**, ascending to lodge as pathogenic *qi* within the **zàng-fǔ interstices**—hence the formation of water. The **zàng** refers to the **spleen**, and the **fǔ** refers to the **stomach**.

The **Foot-Taiyin meridian** ascends from the foot to the abdomen, while the **Foot-Yangming meridian** descends from the head to the foot. Now, as **Yin-qi subtly descends**, the **Taiyin** ascends in counterflow—hence the saying that **Yin-qi descends and then ascends again**. When it ascends again, the descending **Yin-qi** does not disperse but lodges within the **spleen-stomach interstices**, transforming into water.

What is meant by **"chest pain and shortness of breath"** is that **water-qi resides in the zàng-fǔ**. Water is **Yin-qi**; when **Yin-qi** lingers in the center, it causes **chest pain and shortness of breath**. When water stagnates below, **qi** becomes congested above, and **congested qi** above leads to **lung fullness**—hence the **chest pain and shortness of breath**.

What is meant by **"in severe cases, syncope; aversion to people and fire, and startling at the sound of wood"** is that **Yang-qi and Yin-qi clash**, and **water and fire repel each other**—hence the **startled, sudden fright**. What is meant by **"desiring to shut oneself away in a sealed chamber"** is that **Yin and Yang clash**; when **Yang is exhausted and Yin prevails**, one **seeks seclusion in a sealed chamber**—hence the aversion to noise.

What is meant by **"when the illness peaks, one wishes to climb high and sing, casting aside clothes and fleeing"** is that **Yin and Yang contend anew**, and **external forces align with Yang**—hence the **casting aside of clothes and fleeing**.

**New annotation:** Examine the passage from *"in severe cases, syncope"* onward—it corresponds with the earlier *"Yangming Pulse Explanation"* (*Yángmíng Mài Jiě Lùn*).

What is meant by **"when the Guest-Son pulse appears, there is headache, nasal sighing, and abdominal distension"** is that **Yangming converges above**, and **what converges above** is the **Son collateral of Taiyin**—hence the **headache, nasal sighing, and abdominal distension**.

The **Taiyin**—what is called **"disease of distension"**—is the **Taiyin child** (i.e., **Child of Water**). In the **eleventh month**, when all things’ *qi* withdraws inward, it is said to be **"disease of distension."** Since **Yin-qi is excessively strong**, the **Taiyin** originates in the **Child (hour)**, hence the term **"child."** As its meridian enters the abdomen, connecting with the spleen and collateralizing the stomach, **distension ensues**.

What is meant by **"ascending to the heart, causing belching"** is that **excessive Yin ascends into Yangming**, and **Yangming’s collaterals connect to the heart**—hence it is said that **"it ascends to the heart, causing belching."** According to the *Língshū*, the **Foot-Yangming meridian’s flow** does not conventionally reach the heart, but the **Taiyin meridian’s text** states: *"Its branching pathway diverges again, ascending from the stomach to the *è* (esophageal junction), entering the heart."* This should be taken as the **Yangming collateral**.

**New annotation:** Examine Wang’s claim that the **Foot-Yangming meridian’s flow** does not reach the heart—yet the *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng* states that the **Yangming meridian** ascends to the heart, passes the throat, and exits the mouth. Thus, the *Classics* correctly state that the **Yangming collateral connects to the heart**, causing belching. How could Wang deny its existence?

What is meant by **"vomiting upon eating"** is that **excessive intake overflows upward**—hence the vomiting. This is because its meridian connects to the spleen and collateralizes the stomach, ascending to the *è* (esophageal junction) beside the throat.

What is meant by **"afterward, when *qi* is obtained, there is a sudden sense of decline"** is that in the **eleventh month**, **Yin-qi descends and weakens**, while **Yang-qi is about to emerge**—hence the saying that **"afterward, when *qi* is obtained, there is a sudden sense of decline."**

The **Shaoyin**—what is called **"lumbar pain"**—refers to the **kidney**. In the **tenth month**, when all things’ **Yang-qi** is injured, **lumbar pain** ensues. The **Shaoyin** is the **kidney meridian**, and the **lumbar region is the kidney’s residence**—hence the **lumbar pain**.

What is meant by **"vomiting, coughing, and upward dyspnea"** is that **Yin-qi lingers below**, while **Yang-qi floats above**; all **Yang-qi** rises without support—hence the **vomiting, coughing, and upward dyspnea**. As its meridian ascends from the kidney, piercing the liver’s *è* (esophageal junction) and entering the lungs, the illness manifests thus.

What is meant by **"color—"** **New annotation:** The term *"color"* (*sè sè*) is likely erroneous.

---

**Shaoyin**—what is called **"inability to stand long, and when sitting for long one rises with blurred vision"**—refers to the **Yin-qi** and **Yang-qi** being unstable and without a fixed ruler. When the **Autumn-qi** arrives, the first frost descends, and the killing **Yin** begins to affect all things. Internally, the **Yin** and **Yang** are disrupted, hence the blurred vision upon rising.

What is meant by **"prone to anger with diminished breath"** is that the **Yang-qi** is not harmonized; when the **Yang-qi** cannot ascend properly, the **Liver-qi**—which should be regulated—fails to find its course, hence the propensity for anger. This propensity for anger is called **"煎厥" (Jiānjué, tormented frenzy)**.

What is meant by **"fear as if pursued by capture"** is that the **Autumn-qi** has not yet fully withdrawn from all things. The **Yin-qi** is yet weak, while the **Yang-qi** intrudes, causing the **Yin** and **Yang** to clash—hence the fear.

What is meant by **"aversion to food odors"** is that the **stomach lacks qi**, hence the aversion to food odors.

What is meant by **"face black as earth’s hue"** is that the **Autumn-qi** disrupts internally, causing a change in complexion.

What is meant by **"coughing up blood"** is that the **Yang meridian** is injured. When the **Yang-qi** has not yet ascended fully, the meridian becomes congested; congestion leads to coughing, hence blood appears at the nose.

**Jueyin**—what is called **"癫疝" (Diānshān, epilepsy and hernia), or swelling of the lower abdomen in women**—refers to **Jueyin**, which corresponds to **辰 (Chén, the third earthly branch, March)**. In the **third month**, when the **Yin** within **Yang** is at its peak, the **evil** lingers in the center, hence the **epilepsy, hernia, and lower abdominal swelling**. Its meridian travels along the **inner thigh**, enters the **pubic region**, encircles the **Yin organs**, reaches the **lower abdomen**—thus the symptoms.

What is meant by **"lumbar and spinal pain preventing flexion and extension"** is that in the **third month**, there is a sudden **stirring** of growth and flourishing in all things, yet it remains **bent** without rising—hence the pain.

What is meant by **"epilepsy, hernia, and swollen skin"** is that the **Yin** is also excessive, causing the meridian to swell and obstruct—hence the **epilepsy, hernia, and swollen skin**.

What is meant by **"severe cases leading to hoarseness, dryness, and internal heat"** is that the **Yin** and **Yang** clash, generating **heat**—hence the **hoarseness and dryness**.

This section diverges from the preceding and subsequent passages, offering a separate explanation of the **meridian’s** origins of illness, akin yet distinct from the *Ling Shu* (Spiritual Pivot) theory of **flow and ebb**. **New annotation:** *"This section’s explanations largely align with the *Jiāyǔ Jīng* (Canon of A and B) regarding diseases arising from the **meridian’s movements**, differing only slightly, yet fundamentally consistent."*

**The Essentials of Needling** (Cìyào Lùn)

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"I wish to hear about the essentials of needling."*

Qìbó replied: *"Illness has superficial and deep aspects; needling has shallow and deep techniques. Each must reach its proper principle; do not exceed the Dao/Way.*

The **Dao/Way** refers to the **pathways of qi**. Exceeding it causes **internal injury**; failing to reach it leads to **external obstruction**, and obstruction allows **evil** to follow. Exceeding it results in **internal injury** due to **excessive depth**; failing to reach it causes **external obstruction** by mistakenly reinforcing another part’s **qi**. When **qi** is reinforced, **external obstruction** arises, allowing **evil qi** to seize the **void** and follow it. If **shallow and deep** techniques are misapplied, it becomes a **great thief**, disrupting the **Five Zàng (viscera)** and eventually giving rise to **major illness**. **Thief** means **private harm**; **disrupt** means **chaos**. Thus, failing to reach it leads to **external obstruction**, while exceeding it causes **internal injury**. When both **external obstruction** and **internal injury** occur, it marks the **gradual onset** of **major illness**—hence the saying, ‘*later it gives rise to major illness*.’"

Thus it is said: *"Illness may reside in the **millimeter-hairs** (háo), in the **skin’s texture** (shènglǐ), in the **muscles**, in the **meridians**, in the **sinews**, in the **bones**, or in the **marrow**."* The **longest hairs** are called **millimeter-hairs** (háo), and the **skin’s visible patterns** are called **texture** (shènglǐ). Needling the **millimeter-hairs** or **skin’s texture** does not harm the **skin** itself. When the **skin** is injured, the **lungs** are internally disrupted; the **lungs** disrupted lead to **Autumnal illnesses** of **fever and intermittent chills**, with **shivering** and **persistent coldness**.

The *Canning* (Needling Canon) says: *"There are five superficial needlings corresponding to the **Five Zàng (viscera)**. The first is **half-needling**, where the needle is inserted shallowly but swiftly withdrawn, causing **excessive injury** akin to pulling out hair. This targets the **skin’s qi**, corresponding to the **lungs**."* Though this is a **shallow** technique for the **lungs**, the **skin’s texture** and **millimeter-hairs** require an even shallower insertion—**halfway between the hair roots’ depth and the surface**.

The **lungs** govern the **skin**; they rule over **Autumn-qi**. Thus, when the **lungs** are disrupted, **Autumnal illnesses** of **fever and intermittent chills** arise, with **shivering** and **persistent coldness**. **Sū (shivering)** is pronounced *sù*.

Needling the **skin** without harming the **muscles**: when the **muscles** are injured, the **spleen** is internally disrupted; the **spleen** disrupted leads to **abdominal distension, discomfort, and loss of appetite** in the **seventy-second days** of the **four seasons’ months**. The **spleen’s** meridian unites with the **muscles**, and its **qi** is entrusted to rule over the **four seasons**. Its meridian ascends from the **inner thigh**, enters the **abdomen**, connects with the **spleen’s network** and **stomach’s collaterals**, pierces the **esophageal junction**, and links to the **throat**; it disperses beneath the **tongue** and its **branches** further ascend from the **stomach**, piercing the **esophageal junction** and converging in the **heart**. Thus, injuring the **muscles** disrupts the **spleen**; when the **spleen** is disrupted, the **four seasons’ months** see **abdominal distension, discomfort, and loss of appetite**.

The **seventy-second days** of the **four seasons’ months** refer to the **twelve days** following the **third, sixth, ninth, and twelfth months**, with **Earth** entrusted to rule over **eighteen days**.

Needling the **muscles** without harming the **meridians**: when the **meridians** are injured, the **heart** is internally disrupted; the **heart** disrupted leads to **Summeral illnesses** of **cardiac pain**. The **heart** governs the **meridians**; it rules over **Summer-qi**. The **true heart’s** **Shaoyin meridian** originates in the **heart**, emerging to connect with the **heart’s system**. The **heart’s** **包 (pāo, wrapper/pericardium) meridian** originates in the **chest**, emerging to connect with the **heart’s wrapper**. The *Treatise on Plain Man’s Qi Manifestations* says: *"The **Zàng (viscera)**’s **true essence** communicates with the **heart**."* Thus, injuring the **meridians** disrupts the **heart**; when the **heart** is disrupted, **Summeral illnesses** of **cardiac pain** arise.

Needling the **meridians** without harming the **sinews**: when the **sinews** are injured, the **liver** is internally disrupted; the **liver** disrupted leads to **Springal illnesses** of **heat and forward relaxation**. The **liver** governs the **sinews**; it rules over **Spring-qi**. The *Canning* says: *"Heat relaxes the **sinews**."* Thus, injuring the **sinews** disrupts the **liver**; when the **liver** is disrupted, **Springal illnesses** of **heat and sinew relaxation** arise. **Relaxation** (chǐ) means **loosening**; its pronunciation is *shì* in the **cut**.

Needling the **sinews** without harming the **bones**: when the **bones** are injured, the **kidney** is internally disrupted; the **kidney** disrupted leads to **Winteral illnesses** of **lumbar distension and pain**. The **kidney** governs the **bones**; it rules over **Winter-qi**. The **lumbar region** is the **kidney’s residence**—hence, when the **bones** are injured, the **kidney** is disrupted; when the **kidney** is disrupted, **Winteral illnesses** of **lumbar pain** arise. The **kidney’s** **meridian** travels **straight upward**, piercing the **esophageal junction**—hence the **distension**.

Needling the **bones** without harming the **marrow**: when the **marrow** is injured, the **organs** grow **acidic**, and the **body’s** **dissolution** spreads diffusely without cessation. The **marrow** is the **bone’s** **filler**.

The *Zhen Jing* says: *"When the **marrow sea** is insufficient, the **brain** spins, the ears ring, the **organs** grow **acidic**, and **dizziness** and **headache** arise."* Hence, when the **marrow** is injured, the **brain marrow** dissolves, the **organs** grow **acidic**, and the **body’s dissolution** spreads diffusely—**indeterminate** and unceasing.

**"Dissolution"** (xiāoshuò) refers to the **marrow and brain** dissolving.
**"Diffuse"** (jiěbù) refers to **strength** that is neither strong nor weak, **cold** that is neither hot nor cold—**indeterminate**, spreading diffusely, beyond naming.

The **dissolution of brain marrow** stems from **hollowed bones**.

*"Shuò"* is pronounced as in *"shì yuè"* (poetic reading).
*"Xuàn"* (dizziness) is pronounced *"xuán"* (as in "suspend").

**Chapter on Needling Depths**

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"I wish to hear of the distinctions in needling depth—referring to the layers of skin, flesh, sinews, vessels, and bone."*

Qibo replied: *"When needling bone, do not harm the sinews; when needling sinews, do not harm the flesh; when needling flesh, do not harm the vessels; when needling vessels, do not harm the skin. When needling skin, do not harm the flesh; when needling flesh, do not harm the sinews; when needling sinews, do not harm the bone."*

The Emperor said: *"I do not yet understand your meaning. I wish to hear its explanation."*

Qibo said: *"When needling bone without harming sinews, the needle reaches the sinews but does not penetrate the bone. When needling sinews without harming flesh, it reaches the flesh but does not reach the sinews. When needling flesh without harming vessels, it reaches the vessels but does not penetrate the flesh. When needling vessels without harming skin, it reaches the skin but does not reach the vessels. These are all methods of expelling pathogenic factors.*

*However, if sinews harbor cold pathogens, flesh harbors wind pathogens, vessels harbor damp pathogens, and skin harbors heat pathogens, then needling should be adjusted accordingly. What is called ‘pathogenic’ refers to what disrupts the harmonious flow of true qi and invades the body.*

---
**Newly Corrected Notes:**
*"This explains that shallow needling does not reach the intended depth; the following text warns against excessive depth. When needling skin without harming flesh, the disease lies within the skin, and the needle enters only the skin without damaging the flesh. When needling flesh without harming sinews, it passes through the flesh but avoids the sinews. When needling sinews without harming bone, it passes through the sinews but avoids the bone. This is called ‘reversal.’ This warns against excessive or overly deep needling."*

*"According to Quan Yuanqi: Needling in this manner constitutes injury—all of these are excesses. Excess weakens blood and qi, which is called ‘contrary’ to the Dao, allowing pathogens to enter."*

---
**Chapter on Needling Prohibitions**

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"I wish to hear of the prohibitions."*

Qibo replied: *"The viscera have critical vulnerabilities that must be observed. The liver arises on the left—its nature aligns with wood, ruling spring, when yang energy first emerges, hence its leftward origin. The lungs are housed on the right—their nature aligns with metal, ruling autumn, when yin energy contracts and kills, hence their concealment there."*

*"The heart lies externally—yang energy governs the exterior, and its nature aligns with fire. The kidneys govern internally—yin energy governs the interior, and their nature aligns with water."*

*"The spleen is called the ‘Director’—its ceaseless circulation of nourishing essence and transformation of waste into chyle makes it the Director. The stomach is called the ‘Market’—where water and grain enter, and the five flavors converge like a marketplace."*

*"Above the diaphragm, within the chest, lies the parent-child duo—the diaphragm’s upper region houses the *qihai* (Sea of Qi), the source of life and origin of the vital breath, thus called the ‘parent and child’ of humanity."*

*"According to Yang Shangshan: The heart below the diaphragm and above the *li* (stomach) is the *fang* (region of the heart), and the heart is the yang parent, while the lungs are the yin mother. The lungs govern qi, and the heart governs blood; together, they nourish and defend the body, hence ‘parent and child.’"*

*"Beside the seven lumbar vertebrae lies the *xiaoxin* (small heart)—the true heart, the hallowed chamber of the spirit’s essence."*

*"According to *Taisu*: *Xiaoxin* is also called *zhixin* (heart of will). Yang Shangshan says: The spine has twenty-one vertebrae; the kidneys lie beside the lower seven. The kidney spirit is called *zhi* (will), and the spirits of the five viscera each have their own essence—what the heart’s spirit governs is called *zhi*. To follow is fortune; to oppose is calamity."*

Eight are the principles by which a person is born and the form is completed: thus, following them brings prolonged fortune, while opposing them invites calamity.

If the **heart** is pierced, death occurs in one day, and its disturbance manifests as **sighing**. The **heart**’s relation to **qi** is expressed through sighing.

If the **liver** is pierced, death occurs in five days, and its disturbance manifests as **speaking** (or **yawning***†*). The **liver**’s relation to **qi** is expressed through speaking (or yawning). [*New校正* notes: According to *Quanyuanqi*’s original text and the *Jia-Yi Jing*, "speaking" should be translated as **yawning**. *Quanyuanqi* states: "If the **kidneys** are injured, it results in yawning, for the **yin-yang parent-child relationship** is affected." The *Wang* school alters "yawning" back to "speaking."]

If the **kidneys** are pierced, death occurs in six days (or three days*‡*), and its disturbance manifests as **sneezing**. The **kidneys**’ relation to **qi** is expressed through sneezing. [*New校正* notes: According to *Quanyuanqi*’s original text and the *Jia-Yi Jing*, "six days" should be "three days."]

If the **lungs** are pierced, death occurs in three days, and its disturbance manifests as **coughing**. The **lungs**’ relation to **qi** is expressed through coughing.

If the **spleen** is pierced, death occurs in ten days (or fifteen days*§*), and its disturbance manifests as **swallowing**. The **spleen**’s relation to **qi** is expressed through swallowing. [*New校正* notes: According to *Quanyuanqi*’s original text and the *Jia-Yi Jing*, "ten days" should be "fifteen days."]

Piercing the **five viscera** aligns with the *Zhenyao Jingzhonglun* and *Sishi* theories on **yin-yang parent-child** relations and **fortune/calamity** correspondence. This is the **Master Shu’s** sequential method of the viscera, ordered by their **generative cycle** (*shēng*). The *Jia-Yi Jing* arranges them as **heart, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys**, following the **overcoming cycle** (*kè*). *Quanyuanqi*’s text by Cao Wen, however, lists them in a disordered, inconsistent manner.

If the **gallbladder** is pierced, death occurs in half a day, and its disturbance manifests as **vomiting**. The **gallbladder**’s **qi** is bold, hence its association with vomiting. [*New校正* notes: According to the *Zhenyao Jingzhonglun*, it further states: "If the **stomach** (*ge*) is pierced, it is called *shāngzhōng* (injury to the center), and though the illness may heal, death will occur within no more than a year."]

Piercing the **greater vessel** (*dàmài*) of the **foot** (*zhu*) results in **prostration and pallor**. The **foot**’s **greater vessel** is the **foot Taiyang meridian** (*zú-Tàiyáng jīngmài*). Piercing this vessel excessively causes one to collapse and lose color, as if stripped bare.

Piercing the **midline pulse** (*liùmài*) of the **face** (*miàn*) without proper caution leads to **blindness**. The **midline pulse** of the **face** is where the **hand Taiyang meridian** (*shǒu-Tàiyáng mài*)—the **Ren meridian** (*Rèn mài*)—intersects. The **hand Taiyang meridian** descends from the forehead diagonally to the inner corner of the eye. The **Ren meridian** ascends from the sides of the **nostrils** (*bí*) upward to the **perineum** (*tóngzǐxià*), hence piercing the **midline pulse** of the **face** may result in **blindness**.

Piercing the **brain’s door** (*nǎohù*) at the top of the head causes immediate death upon entry. The **brain’s door** is a **acupuncture point** located above the **occipital bone** (*zhěn gǔ*), connecting directly to the **brain**. Yet the **brain** is the **sea of marrow** (*suǐzhīhǎi*), where **true qi** (*zhēnqì*) converges; if pierced, **true qi** will leak, resulting in instant death.

Piercing the **midline pulse** (*zhōngmài*) beneath the **tongue** (*shé*) excessively, with blood not ceasing to flow, causes **aphonia**. The **tongue’s midline pulse** belongs to the **spleen meridian** (*pí mài*), which runs beside the **throat** (*yàn*) and connects to the **root of the tongue** (*shé běn*), then disperses beneath the tongue. If blood flows endlessly, the **spleen’s qi** cannot circulate and nourish the tongue, hence **aphonia** ensues.

Piercing the **networked vessels** (*bùluò*) beneath the **foot** (*zú*) without blood outflow results in **edema**. The **networked vessels** refer to the **collateral branches** (*luò*) spreading across the space before the **inner ankle** (*nèihuái*) on the underside of the foot, corresponding to the **Zhonggu** acupoint. The **midline pulse** of these **networked vessels** is actually the **Chong meridian** (*Chōng mài*), which descends alongside the **foot Shaoyin meridian** (*zú-Shàoyīn jīngmài*) and enters the **inner ankle**, then continues beneath the foot. If pierced without blood outflow, the **kidney meridian** and **Chong meridian**’s **qi** converge at **Zhonggu**, causing **edema**.

Piercing the **greater vessel** (*dàmài*) of the **searching meridian** (*xún*) results in **prostration and pallor**. The **searching meridian**’s primary treatment point is **Weizhong** (*wěizhōng*), equivalent to the **Weizhong** acupoint in the *Zhongyong Liuzhujing*. The term "piercing the **searching meridian** of the **foot**" refers to the **foot Taiyang meridian** (*zú-Tàiyáng jīngmài*), which begins at the **inner corner of the eye** (*mù nèi pí*), converges with the **hand Taiyang meridian** (*shǒu-Tàiyáng mài*), and its **hand Taiyang meridian** descends diagonally from the inner corner of the eye to the **forehead** (*é*). The **foot Taiyang meridian** ascends to the **head** (*tóu*), descends to the **neck** (*yáng*), and then follows the **foot**. Thus, piercing it excessively causes collapse and a face pale as if stripped of color.

Piercing the **midline pulse** (*zhōngmài*) of **Qijie** causes **edema, prostration, and a rodent-like appearance**. The **midline pulse** of **Qijie** belongs to the **gallbladder** and **stomach meridians** (*dǎn-wèi mài*). The **gallbladder meridian** (*dǎn mài*) travels along the **ribcage** (*xiē*), emerging at **Qijie**. The **stomach meridian** (*wèi mài*) enters **Qijie** beside the **navel** (*qí*), and its **branch** (*zhī*) originates from beneath the **stomach**, ascending along the **abdomen** (*fù*) to converge at **Qijie**. If pierced without blood outflow, the blood and **qi** gather internally, forming **edema** and a rodent-like appearance. **Qijie** is located four inches below the **navel** on either side, with **Nǔshū** (*鼠仆*) one inch above it, where the pulse is palpable. [*New校正* notes: Another text records "Nǔshū" as a mistake; the *Qifu Lun*’s annotation states: "Qijie is located below the **navel** (*qí*), one inch above the **horizontal bone** (*héng gǔ*), and beside the **misfortune** (*shū*)."]

Piercing the **spinal midline** (*jǐwèn*) and injuring the **marrow** (*suǐ*) causes **hunchbacked posture** (*yǔ*). **Hunchbacked posture** refers to **kyphosis** (*yǔcān*), where the body bends forward. The **spinal midline** refers to the **spaces between the vertebrae** (*jǐgǔ jiēwèn*). Piercing the **marrow** causes the **essence of the bones** (*gǔjīng*) and **qi** to leak, hence the **hunchbacked posture**.

Piercing the **midline pulse** (*zhōngmài*) above the **breasts** (*rǔ*) results in **edema at the root** and **ulceration**. The **breasts**’ upper and lower regions are governed by the **foot Yangming meridian** (*zú-Yángmíng jīngmài*). Within the **breasts**, **breast fluid** (*rǔyè*) seeps and **qi** and blood from the chest all discharge externally. If the **breasts** are pierced, **qi** and blood discharge together, causing **severe edema**. Within lies a **pus-filled root** (*nónggēn*), which internally erodes the **muscles and skin** (*jīfū*), turning into **pus** (*nóngshuǐ*), and thus the condition becomes chronic and does not heal.

Piercing **Qipan** causes **internal collapse** and **qi leakage**, resulting in **wheezing, coughing, and reversed breathing**. The **five viscera** are covered by the **lungs**, and **Qipan** serves as their **passage**. The **lungs** store **qi** and govern **respiration** (*xī*), and their relation to **qi** manifests as **coughing**. Piercing **Qipan**’s internal collapse causes **lung qi** to leak externally, hence **wheezing, coughing, and reversed breathing** ensue.

Piercing the **inner depression** (*nèixiàn*) of the **hand’s fish abdomen** (*yúfù*) results in **edema**.

The **inner fish abdomen** (*yúfù*) of the hand contains the **lung meridian** (*fèimài*), so piercing it too deeply causes **edema**.

○Newly corrected text reads: According to the *Jia Yi Jing* (甲乙经), "肺脉所流" should be rendered as **"留"** (*liú*, meaning "retain").

**Piercing without caution** a **heavily intoxicated** person causes **disordered qi** (*qìluàn*). The **meridian pulses** (*màishù*) are excessive beyond measure, so the act of piercing further disturbs them.
○Newly corrected text reads: According to the *Ling Shu Jing* (灵枢经), "气乱" should be rendered as **"脉乱"** (*màiluàn*, meaning "disordered pulses").

**Piercing without caution** a **furious** person causes **reversed qi** (*qìnì*). Anger itself brings **reversed qi**, so piercing worsens it further.

**Piercing without caution** a **laboring** person causes **qi to surge** (*jìngqìyuè*). **Piercing without caution** a **recently overfed** person causes **qi to be abundant and full** (*qìshèngmǎn*). **Piercing without caution** a **starving** person causes **qi to be insufficient** (*qìbùzú*). **Piercing without caution** a **thirsty** person causes **dryness in the blood vessels** (*xuèmài gān*). **Piercing without caution** a **startled** person causes **the spirit to scatter and qi to be unregulated** (*shén dàngyuè ér qì bùzhì*).

○Newly corrected text notes: Upon careful examination, the seven conditions from "无刺大醉" (*wú chī dà zuì*) onward differ from the *Ling Shu Jing* (灵枢经). The *Ling Shu Jing* states:
*"Newly pierced without caution, already pierced without newness. Furious without piercing, already pierced without fury. Laboring without piercing, already pierced without labor. Intoxicated without piercing, already pierced without intoxication. Overfed without piercing, already pierced without overfeeding. Starving without piercing, already pierced without starvation. Thirsty without piercing, already pierced without thirst. Startled or terrified, first regulate their qi, then pierce them."*

**Piercing the inner depression** (*nèixiàn*) of the **great meridian** (*dàmài*) in the **inner thigh** (*yīngu*) causes **internal leakage** (*nèiliù*) and **deafness** (*lóng*). The **guest host** (*kèzǔrén*), a **meridian point** (*xué míng*), is now called **Upper Pass** (*Shàngguān*), located in front of the ear, above the **Kang bone** (*kāng qǐ*), where the opening reveals a hollow. Here, the **hand’s lesser yang** (*shǎoyáng*) and **foot’s greater yang** (*dàyáng*) meridians converge in the middle.
○Newly corrected text notes: The **guest host** (*kèzǔrén*) point, as registered in the *Qi Xue Lun* (气穴论), aligns with this description. According to the *Jia Yi Jing* (甲乙经) and *Qi Fu Lun* (气府论) annotations, the convergence involves the **hand’s lesser yang**, **foot’s lesser yang**, and **foot’s greater yang** meridians—likely omitting the **foot’s lesser yang** (*shǎoyáng*) meridian here.
The **inner depression** refers to piercing **too deeply**. Piercing too deeply disrupts the intersecting meridians, causing **internal leakage** in the ear. When **meridian qi leaks internally**, the **ear’s nourishment is lost**, hence **deafness**.

**Piercing the inner depression** of the **knee joint** (*xīhuì*) causes **fluid leakage** (*yèchū*), resulting in **limping** (*bǒ*). The **knee** is the **house of sinews** (*jīnfǔ*), where sinews gather. When **fluid leaks**, the sinews dry out, hence **limping**.
○**髋** (*huì*) is pronounced as **fèng** (*fèng*).

**Piercing the greater yin** (*tàoyīn*) meridian of the **arm** (*bì*) causes **excessive bleeding** (*xuèchūduō*), leading to **immediate death** (*lìsǐ*). The **greater yin** meridian of the arm is the **lung meridian** (*fèimài*). The **lungs** govern the circulation of **nourishing and defensive qi** (*róngwèi yīnyáng*), regulating the **opening and closing** (*zhìjié*) of the **body’s channels**. When **blood leaks excessively**, the **nourishing and defensive qi are severed**, hence **immediate death**.

**Piercing the lesser yin** (*shàoyīn*) meridian of the **foot** (*zú*) causes **double emptiness** (*chóngxū*), leading to **bleeding** (*xuèchū*) and **tongue immobility** (*shétóu nán yǐ yán*). The **lesser yin** meridian of the foot is the **kidney meridian** (*shènmài*). The **foot’s lesser yin** meridian **penetrates the kidney**, connects with the **lung**, and **anchors the root of the tongue** (*shětóu běn*), so when **double emptiness** causes **bleeding**, the **tongue loses mobility**.

**Piercing the inner depression** (*nèixiàn*) of the **chest’s center** (*yīngzhōng*), where the **lung meridian** (*fèimài*) lies, causes **wheezing, reversed breathing, and labored respiration** (*chuǎnnì yǎngxī*). **Lung qi** leaks upward, leading to **reversed breathing**.

**Piercing the inner depression** of the **elbow’s bend** (*zhǒuzhōng*), where **qi returns** (*qì guīzhī*), causes **inability to flex or extend** (*bùdé qūshēn*). The **elbow’s bend** refers to the **center of the elbow’s fold** (*zhǒu zhé zhōng*), specifically the **Sea of the Cubit** (*Chǐzé*) point. When piercing **exceeds the inner depression**, **malignant qi** (*èqì*) returns, **fixing the joints** (*guān jié*), hence **inability to flex or extend**.

**Piercing the inner depression** (*nèixiàn*) three **cun** below the **inner thigh** (*yīngu*) causes **incontinence** (*yíniào*). Three **cun** below the **inner thigh** is the **kidney’s collateral** (*shèn zhī luò*). The **rushing meridian** (*Chōngmài*) and the **lesser yin collateral** (*shàoyīn zhī luò*) both originate below the **kidney**, emerge at the **street of qi** (*qìjiē*), and follow the **inner thigh**. Those that ascend travel through the **uterus** (*bāozhōng*). Thus, piercing the **inner depression** causes **incontinence**.

**Piercing the inner depression** (*nèixiàn*) below the **armpit** (*yèxià*), within the **rib’s interspace** (*xiējiān*), causes **coughing** (*késòu*). Below the **armpit** is where the **lung meridian** (*fèimài*) lies. The **lung meridian** originates from the **lung**, connects with it, and **horizontally emerges below the armpit**. The **true heart meridian** (*zhēnxīn cángmài*), which travels **straight**, ascends from the **heart**, then **retroflexes to the armpit**. Piercing the **inner depression** causes both the **heart and lung** to move, hence **coughing**.

**Piercing the inner depression** (*nèixiàn*) of the **lower abdomen** (*shàofù*), where the **urinary bladder** (*pángguāng*) and **urine** (*niàoyè*) emerge, causes the **lower abdomen to feel full** (*shàofù mǎn*). When **bladder qi** leaks externally, the **stomach’s vital qi** (*gǔqì*) returns, hence the **lower abdomen feels full**. The **lower abdomen** refers to the region **below the navel** (*qí xià*).

**Piercing the inner depression** of the **stomach’s intestines** (*tángcháng*) causes **edema**.

The **stomach’s intestines** (*tángcháng*) contain the **foot’s greater yang** meridian (*zúdàmài*). When **greater yang qi** leaks, it results in **edema**.

**Piercing the inner depression** (*nèixiàn*) of the **orbital ridge** (*yǐngqióng*)’s **bone** (*gǔ*), where the **meridian** lies, causes **leakage** and **blindness** (*máng*). The **orbital ridge** (*yǐngqióng*) is the **frame of the eye** (*mù yǐng*). The **bone’s inner meridian** refers to the **eye’s frame bone** (*yǐngqióng gǔ*), which is the **eye’s anchor** (*yǎnzhī xì*) and the **liver’s meridian** (*gānmài*). Piercing the **inner depression** severs the **eye’s anchor**, causing **eye leakage** and **blindness**.

**Piercing the inner depression** of the **joints** (*guānjié*), where **fluid leaks** (*yèchū*), causes **inability to flex or extend**. All **sinews** (*zhūjīn*) belong to the **joints**, and **fluid** nourishes them. When **fluid leaks**, the **sinew sheaths dry out**, hence **inability to flex or extend**.

「#2 *Sufu* [足土, *Zútǔ*]: Originally 『*Lìtǔ* [历土], corrected according to *Gu*’s text. *Huángdì Nèijīng Sūwèn* Supplementary Commentary, Volume 31. Tang Dynasty *Tàipú Lìng* [太仆令] *Qǐ Xuānzǐ* [启玄子] **Wang Bīng** [王冰]’s successive annotations, Song Dynasty *Guànglù Qīng* [光禄卿] and *Zhí Bì Gé* [直秘阁] **Lín Yì** [林亿] et al.’s revised annotations, Song Dynasty *Shǒu Shàngshū* [守尚书] and *Lǜntián Làng* [屯田郎] **Sūn Zhào** [孙兆]’s corrections of errors.

**Chapter: *Zhì Lùn* [志论]**
**Huángdì** [黄帝] asked: *"I wish to hear the essentials of emptiness and fullness* (*xūshí*)."
**Qíbó** [岐伯] replied: *"When **qi** is full, the form is full; when **qi** is empty, the form is empty. This is their constant principle; deviating from this brings illness.* (*shēngbìng*)"
The *Yīnyáng Yìngxiàng Dà Lùn* [阴阳应象大论] states: *"The form returns to **qi**."* (*xíng guī qì*)
From this, emptiness and fullness align accordingly.
Deviation (*fǎn*) refers to **qi** and form not harmonizing, losing the balanced condition. When form and **qi** oppose each other, illness arises.
**Qi** refers to **pulse qi** (*màiqì*); form refers to bodily form (*shēnxíng*).

When the **sustenance** (*gǔ*) is full, **qi** is full; when the **sustenance** is empty, **qi** is empty. This is their constant principle; deviating from this brings illness.
The *Língshū Jīng* [灵枢经] states: *"The **nourishing qi** (*róngqì*) flows thus: when **sustenance** enters internally, it is full; **sustenance** enters the stomach, and **qi** is transmitted to the lungs. When **essence** (*jīng*) is concentrated, it ascends through the **meridian pathways** (*jīngtōng*)."*
From this, **sustenance** and **qi**’s emptiness and fullness are assessed together.
When signs (*zhèng*) do not align, illness arises.

**Newly revised annotations** state: *"According to the *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* [甲乙经], ‘full’ (*shí*) should read ‘treasure’ (*bǎo*)."*
When **pulse** is full, blood is full; when **pulse** is empty, blood is empty. This is their constant principle; deviating from this brings illness.
The **pulse** is the **repository of blood** (*xuèfǔ*), and emptiness and fullness are assessed together.
When signs do not align, illness arises.

**Huángdì** [黄帝] said: *"How does deviation occur?"*
**Qíbó** [岐伯] said: *"When **qi** is empty yet the body is hot, this is deviation."* (*fǎn*)
Empty **qi** means **yang qi** (*yángqì*) is insufficient; when **yang qi** is insufficient, the body should be cold. If the body is hot instead, **pulse qi** should be full, but since **pulse qi** is not full while the body is hot, the signs do not correspond, hence deviation.

**Newly revised annotations** state: *"According to the *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* [甲乙经], ‘When **qi** is full, the body is cold; when **qi** is empty, the body is hot, this is deviation.’ Four characters should be added here."* (*yìng bǔ cǐ sì zì*)

When **sustenance** enters excessively yet **qi** is scant, this is deviation. The **stomach**’s production is **sustenance qi** (*gǔqì*), which is distributed throughout the **meridians** (*jīngmài*). When **sustenance** enters the **stomach**, the **pulse pathways** (*màidào*) disperse accordingly. Now, if **sustenance** enters excessively yet **qi** is scant, it means **stomach qi** does not disperse, hence deviation.

When **sustenance** does not enter yet **qi** is abundant, this is deviation. **Stomach qi** disperses externally, and the **lungs** (*fèi*) absorb it.

When **pulse** is full yet blood is scant, this is deviation. When **pulse** is scant yet blood is full, this is deviation.
The **meridians** (*jīngmài*) conduct **qi**; the **collaterals** (*luòmài*) receive blood. When **meridian qi** enters the **collaterals**, and the **collaterals** receive **meridian qi**, signs do not align, hence all deviations from the norm.

When **qi** is full, the body is cold—this is from **cold injury** (*shānghán*).
When **qi** is empty, the body is hot—this is from **summer-heat injury** (*shāngshǔ*).
Injury (*shāng*) means exposure to pathogenic factors.

Cold injures the form (*xíng*), hence **qi** is full and the body is cold.
Heat injures **qi**, hence **qi** is empty and the body is hot.

When **sustenance** enters excessively yet **qi** is scant, this is from **blood loss** (*tuōxuè*) and **dampness residing below** (*shī jū xià*).
Blood loss leads to blood emptiness; blood emptiness causes **qi** to be internally stagnant, transforming into **fluids** (*jīnyè*), flowing into the **lower burner** (*xiàjiāo*), hence dampness resides below.

When **sustenance** enters scantly yet **qi** is abundant, the pathogen lies in the **stomach** and **lungs**.
The **stomach** lacks sufficient **qi**, and **lung qi** descends into the **stomach**.
Thus, though the pathogen is in the **stomach**, when **lung qi** enters the **stomach**, **lung qi** fails to self-regulate. If **qi** does not self-regulate, pathogenic **qi** follows it, hence the pathogen lies in the **stomach** and **lungs**.

When **pulse** is small yet blood is abundant, this is from **retained fluids with heat** (*yǐnzhōng rè*).
Retained fluids (*liúyǐn*) linger in the **spleen** and **stomach**, causing **spleen qi** to overflow, which then generates **internal heat** (*zhōngrè*).

When **pulse** is large yet blood is scant, this is from **wind in the pulse** and **fluids not entering**.
Abundant **wind qi** (*fēngqì*) blocks **fluids** from entering the **pulse**.
Fullness (*shí*) means **qi** enters; emptiness (*xū*) means **qi** exits.
Entry is **yang**; exit is **yīn**. **Yīn** arises internally, hence exits; **yang** arises externally, hence enters.
When **qi** is full, it is **heat**; when **qi** is empty, it is **cold**.
When **yang** is excessive and **yīn** internally resists, **heat** arises.
When **yīn** is excessive and **yang** externally weakens, **cold** arises.

When **qi** enters fully, the left hand opens the **needle space** (*zhēnkōng*) for draining.
When **qi** exits fully, the left hand closes the **needle space** for supplementing.
This refers to the **needling technique** (*bǔxiě*).

The right hand holds the needle; the left hand manipulates the orifice (*xuéyǔ*).
Thus, when fullness is present, the right hand opens the **needle space** swiftly to drain it.
When emptiness is present, the left hand opens the **needle space** to supplement it.

Manipulating (*niǎn*), pronounced *niè* [涅].

**Chapter: *Zhēnjiě* [针解]**
**Huángdì** [黄帝] asked: *"I wish to hear the explanation of the *Nine Needles* (*Jiǔzhēn*), the principles of emptiness and fullness."*
**Qíbó** [岐伯] replied: *"Needling emptiness to achieve fullness: the needle tip feels hot, for **qi** is full and thus generates heat. Draining fullness: the needle tip feels cold, for **qi** is empty and thus generates cold.*

*Searching out and removing stagnant accumulations: this is expelling **noxious blood** (*èxuè*).*
Search (*sōu*) means **accumulation**; stagnant (*chén*) means **long-standing**; removal (*chú*) means **elimination**. This refers to **collateral meridians** where blood accumulates and becomes long-standing; needling expels and removes it.

*When pathogenic factors are excessive, needling emptiness: withdraw the needle without pressing.*
Pathogenic (*xié*) means **unorthodox** (*bùzhèng*) factors, not the **inherent qi** of the **meridian**; thus, this refers to pathogenic **qi**, not spirits, poisons, or **essence** (*jīng*) overcoming **true qi** (*zhēnqì*).

Withdrawing the needle without pressing causes the orifice to remain open, hence **meridian emptiness** is achieved, and pathogenic **qi** is expelled.

*Slow entry, swift pressing brings fullness; swift entry, slow pressing brings emptiness.*
Slow entry (*xú chū*) means the needle is withdrawn after **meridian qi** has been engaged for some time; swift pressing (*jí àn*) means pressing the orifice swiftly after the needle is withdrawn.
Thus, **true qi** does not disperse, and **meridian qi** remains intact, hence slow entry with swift pressing achieves fullness.

Swift entry (*jí chū*) means the needle is inserted into the orifice and immediately withdrawn upon reaching the **meridian**. Slow pressing (*xú àn*) means pressing the orifice gently after the needle is withdrawn, allowing pathogenic **qi** to disperse and **true qi** to recover, hence swift entry with slow pressing achieves emptiness.»

「The terms *fullness* and *emptiness* refer to the excess or deficiency of cold and warm **qi**.

Cold and warm **qi** refer to the yin and yang **qi** of the **meridians**.

*If present or absent* means that the condition cannot be immediately discerned—
its nature is obscure, and thus cannot be known upon direct examination.
When it cannot be known immediately, it is as if absent.
When one intuitively perceives it with divine insight, it is as if present.

*Detecting whether the disease is earlier or later* means understanding the sequence of the illness—
knowing whether it is earlier or later allows one to apply needling and moxibustion (*bǔ xiě*) appropriately.

To determine *fullness* or *emptiness* is for the practitioner not to stray from proper technique.
*The Needle Classic* states: *“When **meridian qi** has arrived, carefully guard it lest it be lost.”*
This is what is meant.

○The newly revised annotation reads: *“According to the *Jia-Yi Classic*, if present or if lost, it is *fullness* or *emptiness*.
If obtained or lost, it is deviation from proper technique.
Arbitrarily applying needling and moxibustion disrupts the major **meridians**, causing error:
If one mistakenly needles *fullness*, it will instead cause the condition to appear as if *obtained*;
If one mistakenly moxibustions *emptiness*, it will instead cause the condition to appear as if *lost*.
Hence, it is said: *‘If obtained or lost.’*
*The Needle Classic* states: *“There is no *fullness* without *emptiness*, no *emptiness* without *fullness*.”
This is its warning.

○The newly revised annotation reads: *“In detail, from the beginning of this section to here, the explanations differ yet complement those of the *Tai Su* chapter on the Nine Needles. These two classics illuminate each other.

The essence of *fullness* and *emptiness* lies in the Nine Needles, which are most ingenious—
each has its own fitting application.
For heat in the head and body, the *cai* needle is appropriate.
For **meridian qi** abundant in the flesh, the *yuan* needle is appropriate.
For **meridian qi** that is deficient and weak, the *ti* needle is appropriate.
For moxibustion to dispel heat and induce bleeding, or to expel pathogenic **qi** and stabilize the disease, the *feng* needle is appropriate.
For breaking numbness and swelling, or to induce pus and bleeding, the *zhu* needle is appropriate.
For regulating yin and yang, or to remove sudden **bi** syndrome, the *yuan-li* needle is appropriate.
For treating pain and **bi** syndrome within the **meridians** and **collaterals**, the *hao* needle is appropriate.
For **bi** syndrome deep-seated between bones, joints, or the lumbar and sacral regions, the *chang* needle is appropriate.
For **empty-wind** syndrome converging between bones, joints, or the skin, the *da* needle is appropriate.
This is what is meant by *‘each has its own fitting application.’*»

○The newly revised annotation reads: *“In another version, *zhu* is written as *pi* instead.”*

**Translation:**

**Tí**, pronounced *Shì*. The time for **supplementing** and **draining** must align with the **qi**’s opening and closing.

When the **qi** is present at the moment, it is called **opening**; when it has passed or not yet arrived, it is called **closing**. The **moment** refers to:
- One *kè* after the water clock’s float descends, the **qi** resides in **Taiyang**;
- Two *kè*, the **qi** resides in **Shaoyang**;
- Three *kè*, the **qi** resides in **Yangming**;
- Four *kè*, the **qi** resides in the **yin divisions**.

The water clock’s descent never ceases, nor does the **qi**’s movement. Thus, when the **qi** is present at the exact moment, it is **opening**; when it has passed or not yet arrived, it is **closing**.

The *Needle Classic* states:
*"Observe the **qi**’s location and strike accordingly—this is called **encountering the right time**."*
This is what is meant by **supplementing and draining at the proper time**.

○The newly revised annotation reads: *"From the beginning of this passage to here, the text originates from the *Lingshu Jing*, with the *Suwen* elaborating upon it, mutually illuminating each other."*

The *Jia-Yi Jing* states:
*"Supplementing and draining at the proper time is done with the needle."*
Here, the phrase *"with the needle"* is omitted.

The names of the **Nine Needles** differ in form because each needle targets what must be **supplemented or drained**. Their forms vary—long, short, sharp, or blunt—while their purpose is to **adapt to the treatment required**.

○The newly revised annotation reads: *"The shapes of the Nine Needles are now fully detailed in the *Jia-Yi Jing*."*

When **draining excess**, wait until the **yin qi** surges before removing the needle.
When **supplementing deficiency**, wait until the **yang qi** surges and warmth appears beneath the needle before removing it.
This emphasizes that **effectiveness depends on the arrival of the qi**.

Once the **meridian qi** has arrived, guard it carefully without alteration.

The **variation** refers to **alteration**, while **change** refers to **revision**—both are methods of **adapting technique**. It states that once the **qi** has arrived, one must **guard it carefully**, without altering the method, lest harm be invited.

**Depth and shallowness depend on intent**—this discerns the **internal and external nature of the disease**. **Intent** is also **will**; both **will and intent** govern the use of the needle.

**Near and far as one**—this means **depth and shallowness** are measured equally. It states that though the **qi** may differ in proximity, its **diagnosis** relies on its arrival and effectiveness.

**Like standing at the edge of a deep abyss**—one must not dare to falter. This means that **diagnosing and treating** excess or deficiency must be done with the caution of standing at the edge of a deep abyss, lest one lose the proper method of **supplementation or drainage**.

**The hand must grip like holding a tiger**—this seeks **strength**. **Strength** means holding the needle **firmly and resolutely**. The *Needle Classic* states: *"The method of holding the needle is that firmness constitutes **realness**."* This is its meaning.
○The newly revised annotation reads: *"In the Jia-Yi Jing, the character **real** is written as **precious**."*

**The spirit must not be distracted by trivial matters**—this means maintaining a **calm intent** while observing the patient, without glancing left or right. **Eyes must not wander**, and the **mind must focus solely** on the task, so that the needle’s use remains **unerring and without confusion**.
○The newly revised annotation reads: *"This passage, from ‘When draining excess,’ is detailed in the *Bao Ming Quan Xing Lun*, and this is another elucidation, mutually clarifying the meaning."*

**There must be no crookedness below**—this seeks **uprightness and correctness**. **Correctness** refers to **straight insertion**, with the needle neither deviating left nor right. **One must align the spirit properly**—this means gazing at the patient’s eyes to **command their spirit**, so that the **qi flows more easily**. **Examining their spirit**, ensuring it does not scatter, then the **qi follows the spirit’s command**, and **internal and external balance is easily achieved**.

As for the **Sanli (Three Miles)**, it is **three inches below the knee**. As for **holding the knee**—
○The newly revised annotation reads: *"According to Quan Yuanqi’s text, it is written as **lowering the abdomen**.* The *Tai Su* writes **entrusting it**. According to the *Gu Kong Lun*, **holding** is likely a miswriting of **instructing above**."* **Lifting the knee** makes the division clear. **Sanli** is the name of an acupoint, located **three inches below the knee**, between the two muscles outside the **abdomen**. Pressing firmly there will cause the **upper pulse of the foot** to stop, hence it is said: *"Lifting the knee makes the division clear."*

**Ju Xu (Giant Emptiness)** refers to the **abdomen’s sole depression**. **Ju Xu** is the name of an acupoint. **Treading** means **lifting**. To take **Ju Xu below Kang**, one must **lift the foot** to find the **depression between the two muscles outside the abdomen**.

**Xia Lian (Lower Slope)** refers to **what sinks downward**. To know the **Xia Kang** acupoint, it is the **sole depression between the two muscles outside the abdomen**.

The Emperor said: *"I have heard of the Nine Needles, which correspond above to the Heaven, Earth, four seasons, and yin-yang. I wish to hear their methods, so that they may be transmitted to future generations as a constant practice."*

Gibi said: *"Heaven, Earth, humanity, the four seasons, the five tones, the six pitches, the seven stars, the eight winds, and the nine wilds—all correspond to the body’s form. Each needle has its proper use, hence the **Nine Needles**."*

○The newly revised annotation reads: *"This passage varies slightly from the *Ling Shu Jing*."*

**Human skin corresponds to Heaven**—it **covers and protects**, the symbol of Heaven.
**Human flesh corresponds to Earth**—it is **soft, thick, and tranquil**, the symbol of Earth.
**Human vessels correspond to humanity**—their **flourishing and decline** mirror humanity’s symbol.
**Human sinews correspond to the seasons**—they are **firm and steadfast**, the symbol of the seasons.
**Human voice corresponds to the five tones**—they encompass all five tones.
**Human yin-yang merging in qi corresponds to the six pitches**—when **qi converges and flows without interruption**, it mirrors the pitches.
○The newly revised annotation reads: *"In another text, **qi** is written as **degree**."*

**Human teeth, face, and eyes correspond to the seven stars**—this refers to the **seven orifices of the face**.
○The newly revised annotation reads: *"This note is the words of Quan Yuanqi."*

**Human inhaling and exhaling correspond to the winds**—movement in and out mirrors the winds.
**The nine orifices and three hundred sixty-five collaterals correspond to the wilds**—what lies beyond the body’s form mirrors the wilds.

Thus:
- The **first needle** pierces the **skin**,
- The **second** pierces the **flesh**,
- The **third** pierces the **vessels**,
- The **fourth** pierces the **sinews**,
- The **fifth** pierces the **bones**,
- The **sixth** **harmonizes yin and yang**,
- The **seventh** **nourishes the essence**,
- The **eighth** **expels the wind**,
- The **ninth** **opens the nine orifices** and **removes the three hundred sixty-five nodes of the seasons**.
This is what is meant by **each having its master**.

The names of the **Nine Needles** are:
1. **Yin needle**,
2. **Yuan needle**,
3. **Chuan needle**,
4. **Feng needle**,
5. **Mei needle**,
6. **Yuanli needle**,
7. **Hao needle**,
8. **Long needle**,
9. **Da needle**.
○The newly revised annotation reads: *"In another text, **first** is written as **bì**."*

**Human heart and intent correspond to the eight winds**—movement and stillness are formless, the symbol of the winds.
**Human qi corresponds to Heaven**—it **flows endlessly**, the symbol of Heaven.
**Human hair, teeth, ears, eyes, and five sounds correspond to the five tones and six pitches**—hair and teeth grow, ears and eyes are clear, and the five sounds align, hence their correspondence to the five tones and six pitches.
**Human yin-yang vessels and blood-qi correspond to Earth**—yin and yang **interact**, generating vessels and blood, and **qi has fluctuations of excess and deficiency**, hence their correspondence to Earth.
**Human liver and eyes correspond to the nine**—liver **qi nourishes the eyes**, and wood generates the number three; three times three equals nine, hence the correspondence.

**The nine orifices and three hundred sixty-five**—
○The newly revised annotation reads: *"Quan Yuanqi’s text omits these seven characters."*

**One observes movement and stillness** to correspond to **Heaven’s two**,
**Two diagnose the five colors** to correspond to the **seven stars**,
**Three observe the hair’s luster** to correspond to the **five tones**,
**One diagnoses the pitches**—whether **excess or deficiency**—to correspond to the **six pitches**,
**Two correspond to Earth** to diagnose **high and low**—whether **excess or deficiency**—to correspond to the **nine wilds**,
**One node and **Yu** correspond** to diagnose **closed nodes**,
**Three correspond to humanity** to diagnose **tooth decay**—whether **much blood or little**—to correspond to the **ten divisions of angle**,
**Five correspond** to diagnose **slackness and urgency**—whether **deficient or excessive**—to correspond to the **six divisions**,
**Three correspond to the **cold node**—the **ninth division**,
**Four correspond to the seasons**—whether **cold, warm, dry, or humid**—to correspond to the **four seasons**,
**One corresponds to the opposite**—each of the **four directions** is explained separately.

---

This section of **124 characters** is **corrupted and decayed text**, with **fragmented logic**, making it difficult to discern its meaning. Yet, the ancient works still preserve it as a **foundation for later study**.

The *Long Ci Jie Lun* (Treatise on Long Needling Theory) states:
*"The Needling School does not diagnose; it listens to the patient’s words.*
If the **head** suffers **pain**, it is **needled deeply**—*‘deep’* meaning **deep needling**.
Thus, the following text says:
**Needling until the bone**—the illness is cured.
Above, **no harm comes to the bones, flesh, or skin**—*‘skin’* refers to the **Dao/Way of needling**.
The **Dao/Way of needling** is such that **deep needling of the bone** does not harm the bones, flesh, or skin.
**Yin needling**, entering **one side and four places**, treats **cold and heat**.
If the **head** has **cold or heat**, then **Yin needling** is used to treat it.
**Yin needling** refers to **sudden needling** in such quantities.
*[Note: Another version reads ‘**Yin needling**’ as ‘**level needling**’].
According to the *Jia Yi Jing* (The Canon of Needling A and B): **Yang needling** is **needling directly inward, one side and four places**. **Yin needling** is **needling left and right suddenly**. This **Yin needling** may likely be **Yang needling**.

**Deep and focused needling**—for treating **major cold and heat**—attacks the **central organs**.
**Pressing needling near the organs**, the **back nodes** are needled.
*‘Pressing’* means **gradually approaching**.
Needling **near the organs**, the **organs converge**.
Why needling near the organs? Because **the organ’s qi converges there**.
If **cold or heat** in the **abdomen is expelled**, then **stop needling**.
The **essence of needling** is to **withdraw the needle shallowly** and **let blood flow**.
If needling at **all the nodes**, it is done thus.

For treating **decay and abscesses**, needle **above the decay**.
Observe the **size and depth** of the **abscess**—if small, needle shallowly; if large, needle deeply.
*For large abscesses*, **more blood is drawn**; for small ones, **needle directly**—*this is the proper method*.
*[Note: Another version states: For large abscesses, **needle deeply and multiply**; for small ones, **use a bell-shaped needle**—this is the proper method].
If the **illness is in the lower abdomen**, with **accumulations**, needle **below the skin and marrow**, stopping **at the lower abdomen**.
Needle **along the sides of the spine**, **four vertebrae apart**, and **needle the two sides of the hip joint and flank ribs**.
**Guide the heat in the abdomen downward** until it is expelled.

*‘Lower abdomen accumulations’* refers to **cold and heat qi stagnating**.
*‘Skin and marrow’*—*[Note: The original text reads ‘**皮髓**’, but this may be an error. The *Jia Yi Jing* and other versions read ‘**皮骷**’ (skin and bone ends), meaning **needling horizontally at the lower edge of the ribcage**].
Examine the needling **without over-penetrating**.

The *Ci Jin Lun* (Treatise on Needling Prohibitions) states:
*"Needling the lower abdomen causes **urinary bladder dysfunction**, making the patient’s **lower abdomen full**. Thus, needling must not be deep."*

*‘Four vertebrae apart along the sides of the spine’*—*[Note: The original text lacks a node, likely referring to ‘**five vertebrae apart**’ (the **Shen** node below the fifth lumbar vertebra), which corresponds to the **heart** in the lower abdomen, hence the mention of needling there]*.
*‘Hip joint’*—*[Note: The character **骼** (*guǐ*) is likely a miswriting for **髁** (*kē*), a similar-sounding term for the **iliac crest**].
*‘Flank ribs’*—likely refers to **needling near the **Jìngmén** node (the **12th rib space**)**.

*[Note: ‘**皮骼**’ (*pí guǐ*) is likely a miswriting for ‘**皮骷**’ (*pí kē*), meaning **the ends of the ribs**. The *Jia Yi Jing* and other sources read ‘**皮骷**’ (*pí kē*), where **骷** (*kē*) means **bone ends**. **皮骷** refers to **needling horizontally at the rib ends**. The original text reads ‘**皮髓**’, but the annotation suggests **‘**齐傍缍起**’** (level beside the **12th rib space**), which is also unclear.]*

If the **illness is in the lower abdomen**, with **abdominal pain preventing urination or defecation**, it is called **hernia** (*shàn*).
Caused by **cold**, needle **both sides of the lower abdomen** and **between the hip joints**.
Needle **abundantly**, until the **Guìyin pulse** is cured.
The **Guìyin pulse** encircles the **external genitalia** and reaches the **lower abdomen**.
The **Chōng pulse** and the **minor Yin pulse’s collateral** both originate below the **kidneys**, exit at **Qìjiē**, and follow the **inner thigh**.
Later, they descend from the **lower abdomen** to the **central bone**—in women, entering the **system of the womb** (*xì tíng kǒng*).
Their collaterals follow the **external genitalia**, converging at **Zhuàn** (*zhuàn* node), circling behind it, then branching to the **lateral lower abdomen** and **minor Yin pulse’s collateral**, merging with the **major Yang pulse’s collateral** at **Shào Yīn’s upper inner thigh** and **Kāng** (*kāng* node).
They **pierce the spine** and belong to the **kidneys**.
In men, they follow the **penis** downward to **Zhuàn**, equal to women’s path.
Thus, **needling the lower abdomen and both sides of the inner thigh** is also done, as well as **needling between the hip joints**.

*‘Hip joint bone’*—the **iliac crest**, where the **spine’s sides** are **level and sunken**.
Since **hernia** is caused by **cold**, it is needled **abundantly** until the **heat in the lower abdomen is expelled**.

*[Note: Another version reads **‘**篡**’ (*zhuàn*) as **‘**基**’ (*jī*), with the initial illness reversed.]*

If the **illness is in the tendons**, with **tendon contraction and joint pain**, making movement impossible—this is called **tendon Bi** (*jīn bì*).
Needling **above the tendons** is the **proper method**.
Needle **between the muscle divisions**, avoiding the **bone**.
*‘Division’* refers to **where tendons and muscle collaterals intersect**.
Needling **tendons** must not harm the **bone**, hence **avoiding the bone**.
If the **illness originates in the tendons**, needle until the **Guìyin pulse** is cured.
Since **tendon Bi** arises from **tendon stagnation**, needling is stopped when the **tendon heat is expelled**.

If the **illness is in the muscles and skin**, with **pain throughout the muscles and skin**—this is called **muscle Bi** (*jī bì*).
Caused by **cold and dampness**, needle **major and minor divisions**—**withdraw the needle deeply** and **let blood flow abundantly**, using **heat as the proper method**.
*‘Major division’* refers to **the larger muscle divisions**.

---

*‘Minor division’* refers to **the smaller muscle divisions**.
**Do not harm tendons and bone**—if tendons and bone are harmed, **paralysis or transformation** will occur.
*The Needle Classic* states:
*"If the illness is shallow but the needle is deep, it injures the good flesh, and the skin becomes paralyzed."*
Again it says:
*"If the needle is too deep, the pathogenic *qi* will sink deeper, and the illness will worsen."*
Harming tendons and bone means the needle is too deep, hence **paralysis or transformation** occurs.
When **all divisions are heated**, the illness ceases.
**Heat can disperse cold**, thus the illness ceases when cured.

If the illness is in the **bone**, with **heaviness in the bone** so that it cannot be lifted, and **acidic pain in the marrow**, when **cold *qi* arrives**, it is called **bone Bi** (*gǔ bì*).
For deep cases, needle deeply, **without harming the vessels and flesh**—this is the method.
Its principle is to needle **major and minor divisions**; when the **bone is heated**, the illness ceases.
Why must one needle **bone Bi without harming vessels and flesh**?
It is to **self-regulate the *qi*** and **unblock the large and small divisions of the flesh**.

If the illness is in the **all-yang vessels**, with **alternating cold and heat**, and **all divisions alternating cold and heat**, it is called **madness** (*kuáng*).
This is **disordered *qi***.
Needle the **empty vessels**, and when **all divisions are heated**, the illness ceases.

When the illness first appears, it flares **once a year**; if untreated, it flares **once a month**; if still untreated, it flares **four or five times a month**, and it is called **epilepsy** (*diān bìng*).
Needle **all divisions and vessels**; for those without cold, **adjust with the needle**, and the illness ceases.

The newly corrected text states:
According to *The Canon of A and B*:
*"Needle all divisions; if the vessels are especially cold, supplement with the needle."*

If the illness is **wind with alternating cold and heat**, and **profuse sweating**, occurring **multiple times a day**, first needle **all divisions, networks, and vessels**.
When sweating occurs with **alternating cold and heat**, needle **once every three days**; in **one hundred days**, it will be cured.

If the illness is **great wind**, with **heaviness in the joints**, and **falling of beard and eyebrows**, it is called **great wind** (*dà fēng*).
Needle the **muscles and flesh**—this is the method.
Sweat will emerge over **one hundred days**, **dispersing the rebellious heat of the defensive *qi*** (*wèi*).
Needle the **bone marrow**; sweat will emerge over **one hundred days**, **dispersing the rebellious heat of the nourishing *qi*** (*róng*).
In total, **two hundred days**, and the **beard and eyebrows will regrow** before stopping the needle.
When **rebellious heat is dispelled**, **yin *qi* internally recovers**, hence **profuse sweating** and **regrowth of beard and eyebrows**.

*(End of Volume Thirty-One of the *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Classic, Plain Questions*, with annotations.)*
*(Note: Original text had 『问』, corrected to 『经』 according to the Gu edition.)*

**Volume Thirty-Two of the *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Classic, Plain Questions*
*Commentary by Wang Bing, Revised by Sun Zhao and Others*
**Treatise on the Skin Division**

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"I have heard that the skin has divisions, the vessels have their pathways, the sinews have their networks, and the bones have their measures. The diseases they generate differ, and their locations—left, right, above, below—correspond to yin and yang. I wish to hear the Way of this."*

Qibo replied:
*"To know this—*
*The skin’s divisions follow the pathways of the channels. This applies to all channels.*

*Trace the channels’ pathways and their governing regions, and the skin’s divisions will be known.*

*By ‘channels,’ I mean the twelve channels.*

*All twelve channels follow the same principle.*

*The yang of the Yang Brightness channel is called **Hàibèi**—
*‘Bèi’ means transformation and generation. ‘Hài’ is the killing *qi*. When the killing *qi* moves, transformation and generation flourish, hence **Hàibèi** (pronounced *fúfèi*).*

*Above and below follow the same principle. If you see floating networks within its region, they are all the networks of the Yang Brightness channel.*

*If the color is predominantly green, there is pain; if black, numbness; if yellow or red, heat; if white, cold. If all five colors appear, there is both cold and heat.*

*When the networks are盛 (*shèng*), they invade the channels as guests. Yang governs the exterior, yin the interior—*
*Here, ‘yang’ refers to yang networks, ‘yin’ to yin networks. This is a general statement.*

*All channels and networks seen on the hands, feet, and body follow this.*

*The yang of the Minor Yang channel is called **Shūchí**—
*‘Shū’ means pivotal; ‘chí’ means to hold.*

*Above and below follow the same principle. If you see floating networks within its region, they are all the networks of the Minor Yang channel.*

*When the networks are盛 (*shèng*), they invade the channels as guests. Thus, those in yang regions govern the interior, while those in yin regions govern the exterior, permeating inward. This applies to all channels.*

*The yang of the Major Yang channel is called **Guāngū**—
*‘Guān’ governs external movement, emphasizing stillness and stability, like the pivot of a door, ensuring *qi* harmony.*

*Above and below follow the same principle. If you see floating networks within its region, they are all the networks of the Major Yang channel. When the networks are盛 (*shèng*), they invade the channels as guests.*

*The yin of the Minor Yin channel is called **Shūrú**—
*‘Rú’ means compliance. It guards the pivotal points and follows the opening and closing of yin and yang.*
*[New annotation: In the *Jia-Yi Jing*, ‘rú’ is written as ‘rú’ (濡).]*

*Above and below follow the same principle. If you see floating networks within its region, they are all the networks of the Minor Yin channel. When the networks are盛 (*shèng*), they invade the channels as guests. When they invade the channels, they descend from the yang regions into the channels, and when they exit, they flow from the yin interior into the bones.*

*The yin of the Heart Conductor channel is called **Hàijiān**—
*The Heart Conductor’s *qi* enters beneath the armpit; if unharmonized, it obstructs the movement of the shoulder and armpit.*

*Above and below follow the same principle. If you see floating networks within its region, they are all the networks of the Heart Conductor channel. When the networks are盛 (*shèng*), they invade the channels as guests.*

*The yin of the Major Yin channel is called **Guānzhé**—
*‘Guān’ means to close; ‘zhé’ (蛰) means to hibernate, ensuring proper storage and retrieval.*
*[New annotation: In the *Jia-Yi Jing*, ‘zhé’ is written as ‘zhí’ (执).]*

*Above and below follow the same principle. If you see floating networks within its region, they are all the networks of the Major Yin channel. When the networks are盛 (*shèng*), they invade the channels as guests.*

*‘Division’ refers to the regions governed by each channel’s networks. ‘Floating’ means visibly apparent.*

*In total, the twelve channel networks are the divisions of the skin. They are arranged by yin and yang, with each division governing the skin, hence ‘the skin’s divisions.’*

*Therefore, when a hundred diseases first arise, they must first manifest in the skin and hair. When evil invades, the natural order of the skin is disrupted, and the disruption opens the way for the evil to enter the networks. If it lingers without leaving, it transmits into the channels. If it lingers without leaving, it transmits into the reservoirs. If it accumulates in the intestines and stomach,*
*‘Lǐn’ means accumulation.*

*When evil first enters the skin, there is a sudden chill, and the hairs stand on end. The natural order is disrupted;*
*‘Yìrán’ means aversion to cold. ‘Qǐ’ means the hairs rise erect. ‘Shènglǐ’ refers to the skin’s pores and texture.*

*When it enters the networks, the networks become full, and their color changes;*
*‘Shèng’ means fullness. ‘Biàn’ means deviation from the norm.*

*When it invades the channels as a guest, the channels, being empty, sink downward;*
*When the channels are empty and *qi* is deficient, they sink.*

*When it lingers between the sinews and bones, excessive cold causes sinew contraction and bone pain, while excessive heat causes sinew laxity and bone wasting, flesh erosion, and skin ulceration. The hair stands erect and decays.*
*‘Luán’ means contraction. ‘Chí’ means laxity. ‘Xiāo’ means erosion. The *Zhēn Jing* states: ‘Cold causes sinews to contract, heat causes them to relax. Excessive cold leads to pain, excessive heat to *qi* dissipation.’*
*‘Yàn’ is the flesh’s surface marker; thus, when flesh wastes, the surface breaks, and the hair stands erect and decays.*
*‘Yàn’ (胭) pronounced *qúdùn*.*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"Master, you spoke of the twelve divisions of the skin. How do their diseases manifest?"*

Qibo replied:
*"The skin is the division of the channels. The *qi* of the channels flows through, each with its yin and yang, governing regions as it passes. Hence, it is called the ‘division of the channels.’*

*When evil invades the skin, the natural order is disrupted, and the disruption opens the way for the evil to enter the networks. When the networks are full, they flow into the channels. When the channels are full, the evil lodges in the reservoirs.*

*Thus, the skin has divisions. If not treated, great diseases arise.*

*The channels traverse the skin, each with its own divisions. When they receive evil *qi*, diseases follow accordingly—not because the skin’s *qi* alone can generate them.*
*[New annotation: In the *Jia-Yi Jing*, ‘bùyǔ’ is written as ‘bùqù’ (不愈).]"*

---

**Quan Yuanqi’s** version reads *bùyǔ*. Quan Yuanqi explains: *"This means that if the channels and collaterals fail to harmonize, the vital *qi* is injured from without, and evil *qi* flows inward, thus giving rise to great diseases."*

The Emperor said: *"Excellent."*

---
**Chapter on the Collaterals**

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"When the collaterals are visible, their five colors differ—blue, yellow, red, white, and black—each distinct. What is the reason for this?"*

Qibo replied:
*"The channels have constant colors, but the collaterals do not. The channels circulate *qi*, so their colors consistently manifest in accordance with the seasons. The collaterals govern blood, so when they receive evil *qi*, their colors vary and are not uniform."*

The Emperor asked: *"What are the constant colors of the channels?"*

Qibo replied:
*"The heart is red, the lungs white, the liver green, the spleen yellow, and the kidneys black—each corresponding to the color of its respective channel."*

The Emperor asked: *"Do the yin and yang collaterals also correspond to their channels?"*

Qibo replied:
*"The colors of the yin collaterals correspond to their channels, but the colors of the yang collaterals vary without constancy, shifting with the four seasons. In accordance with the transformations of the seasonal *qi*—when cold prevails, they congeal and weep, turning blue-black; when heat prevails, they become moist and lustrous, turning yellow-red. These are the constant colors, indicating no disease. When all five colors appear together, it signifies cold and heat. *Chún* means dampness; *zé* means moist luster—referring to slight dampness and moisture."*

The Emperor said: *"Excellent."*

**Chapter on the *Qi* Points**

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"I have heard that there are 365 *qi* points corresponding to the year. I do not know their locations and wish to hear them fully."*

Qibo bowed twice in response:
*"Your question is profound! If not for a sage like Your Majesty, who could exhaust this Dao? I will now speak at length to fulfill Your intent."*

The Emperor, clasping his hands, stepped back in deference:
*"Your teachings have illuminated my mind—though my eyes have not seen these points nor my ears heard their number, now my understanding is clear, and my perception is sharp."*

Qibo said:
*"This is what is meant by ‘the sage’s words are easy to grasp, like guiding a fine steed.’"*

The Emperor said:
*"I am not one who grasps the sage’s words easily. The world speaks of the *True Numbers* as opening the mind, but what I seek now are the *True Numbers* that dispel ignorance and resolve confusion—though this is still insufficient to fathom the profound and subtle. Nevertheless, I wish to hear Your full account of these points, so that I may understand their meaning. I will store them in the *Golden Case* and not reveal them further."*

*"The points"* refers to the locations of the acupoints.

Qibo bowed twice and rose:
*"Let me speak. When the back and heart press against each other in pain, the treatment involves *Tiantong* [天突], the ten vertebrae, and *Shangji* [上纪]#3.

*Tiantong* is located below the laryngeal prominence, four *cùn* (same-body inches) from the center of the neck’s anterior midline, where the *Ren* [任] channel converges. Needling should be done obliquely downward, penetrating one *cùn*, with retention for seven breaths. If moxibustion is applied, three *zhàng* (cones) may be used.

According to the *Jia-Yi Jing* and *The Illustrated Classic of Channel Flow and Acupoints*, there are no acupoints below the tenth vertebra on the spine—likely referring to the seventh vertebra, governed by the *Du* [督] channel’s *qi*.

The location of *Shangji* follows below.

*Shangji* is the *stomach’s* *mu* [募] point, located one *cùn* below the *upper* *yuan* [院], at the midpoint between the *xiphoid process* and the umbilicus. It is where the *Hand Taiyang*, *Hand Shaoyang*, and *Foot Yangming* channels originate, and where the *Ren* channel’s *qi* emerges. Needling may penetrate one *cùn* and two *fèn* (finger-widths), or seven *zhàng* of moxibustion may be applied.

According to the *Jia-Yi Jing*: *"This is where the *Ren* channel converges."*

*Bì* [蔽] is pronounced *bì* (必寐切).

*Xiàji* [下纪] is *Guanyuan* [关元]. *Guanyuan* is the *mu* point of the small intestine, located three *cùn* below the umbilicus, where the three *yin* channels of the foot and the *Ren* channel converge. Needling may penetrate two *cùn*, with retention for seven breaths, or seven *zhàng* of moxibustion may be applied.

When evil *qi* strikes the back, chest, yin, or yang—left or right—such diseases manifest as anterior and posterior pain, stiffness, chest and flank pain with dyspnea, inability to lie down, shortness of breath, and one-sided chest pain.

According to another text, *pìan* [偏] is also written as *mǎn* [满].

When the pulse is full and rises obliquely, emerging as a *shī* [尸] pulse, the collateral branches spread across the chest and flank, piercing the heart and passing through the *ge* [鬲], ascending to *Tiantong*, descending obliquely to the shoulder, and intersecting below the tenth vertebra#5.

Tracing this collateral’s flow and its pathological manifestations reveals that the *Du* channel’s collateral branches emerge from the coccyx, ascending and obliquely networking the flank, piercing the heart, passing through the *ge*, ascending to *Tiantong*, descending obliquely to the shoulder, and intersecting below the tenth vertebra#5.

According to the annotation: *"From ‘When the back and heart press against each other in pain’ onward, this appears to be a fragment from the *Bone Cavities* chapter, mistakenly inserted here."*

- **Inner Ankle Point (交信穴, Jiāoxìn)** – Located two same-body inches above the inner ankle, anterior to the **Foot Shàoyín** (少阴, Lesser Yin) and posterior to the **Foot Tàiyín** (太阴, Greater Yin) tendons and bones, at the *yīntà* (阴踏, Yin Step) channel’s *yóu* (邮, postal station). Needling may penetrate four *fèn* of the same-body inch, with retention for five breaths. If moxibustion is applied, three *zhàng* may be used.
- **Outer Ankle Point (附阳穴, Fùyáng)** – Located three same-body inches above the outer ankle, anterior to the **Foot Tàiyáng** (太阳, Greater Yang) and posterior to the **Foot Shàoyáng** (少阳, Lesser Yang) tendons and bones, at the *yángtà* (阳踏, Yang Step) channel’s *yóu* (邮). Needling may penetrate six *fèn* of the same-body inch, with retention for seven breaths. If moxibustion is applied, three *zhàng* may be used.
**Newly Corrected Version:** According to the *Jiǎyǐ Jīng*, *Fùyáng* (附阳) is written as *Fùyáng* (付阳).

**Yīnyáng Tiāo (阴阳跚) – Four Points**
- **Yīntāo (阴跚穴, Yin Step)** – Located below the inner ankle, also called *Zhàohǎi* (照海, Illuminating Sea). Where the **Foot Shàoyín** (少阴) channel’s *qi* emerges. Needling may penetrate four *fèn* of the same-body inch, with retention for six breaths. If moxibustion is applied, three *zhàng* may be used.
- **Yángtāo (阳跚穴, Yang Step)** – Also called *Shēn* (申, Extend) **mài** (脉). Where the **Foot Tàiyáng** (太阳) channel’s *qi* emerges. Located in the depression below the outer ankle.
**Newly Corrected Version:** According to the *Cì Yāotòng* (刺腰痛) note, it is located five *fèn* below the outer ankle; according to the *Miù Cì Lùn* (缪刺论), it is located half a same-body inch below the outer ankle.

- **Yángtāo (阳跚穴)** – Within the reach of the toenail, needling may penetrate three *fèn* of the same-body inch, with retention for seven breaths. If moxibustion is applied, three *zhàng* may be used.
**Newly Corrected Version:** According to the *Jiǎyǐ Jīng*, retention for seven breaths is written as six breaths; according to the *Cì Yāotòng* (刺腰痛) note, it is written as ten breaths.

「The **Water Meeting** point (*Shuǐyù*, 水俞) lies among the **flesh divisions** (*ròufèn*, 肉分). The **flesh divisions** refer to the distinctions between the layers of flesh; this is where one treats **Water** (*shuǐ*, 水) by needling.

The **Heat Meeting** point (*Rètāo*, 热俞) lies within the **Qi points** (*qìxué*, 气穴). To address **Heat** (*rè*, 热), one needles these points.

The **Cold-Heat Meeting** points (*Hánrètāo*, 寒热俞) are located at the two **Knee Cavity** points (*liǎngkāiyàn*, 两骸厌) in the depression. The **Knee Cavity** refers to the hollow space on the outer side of the knee joint.

The **Great Prohibition** (*Dàjìn*, 大禁) is found five *cùn* below **Celestial Storehouse** (*Tiānfǔ*, 天府). This is the **Five-Li** point (*wǔlǐ*, 五里). It is called the **Great Prohibition** because needling is strictly forbidden here. The *Needle Classic* (*Zhēnjīng*, 针经) states: *"Needling the Five-Li, which lies midway between the two, five times upward exhausts its **Qi**; five times downward depletes its **Qi**—thus, twenty-five times fully exhausts its Meeting point."* This refers to the same. It further states: *"The Five-Li is five *cùn* behind **Pool of the Inch** (*Chǐzé*, 尺泽)."* This aligns with the text above.

In total, there are **365 Meeting points** (*sānlùoxīgǔ*, 孙络溪谷), the pathways through which needling may be administered. **Newly Corrected Version:** Upon closer examination, from the **Hidden Meeting** point (*Zàngyù*, 藏俞) to the **50th Meeting**, there are overlaps totaling **360 Meeting points**, including those from **Celestial Perforation** (*Tiāntū*, 天突), **Ten Vertebrae** (*Shízhuī*, 十椎), **Upper Record** (*Shàngjì*, 上纪), and **Lower Record** (*Xiàjì*, 下纪), amounting to **365 Meeting points** in all. However, accounting for overlaps, there are truly **313 Meeting points**.

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I have learned the locations of the **Qi points** and the pathways of the **wandering needle** (*yóuzhēn*, 游针). May I inquire about the **Grand Confluences** (*Sānlùoxīgǔ*, 孙络溪谷) and their applications?"*

The **Grand Confluences** (*Sānlùo*, 孙络) are the minor branches of the **Collaterals** (*luò*, 络), referring to their secondary divisions. Qìbó (*岐伯*) replied: *"The **365 Grand Confluences** of the **minor Collaterals** also correspond to the year, serving to drain excess **pathogenic factors** (*xíe*, 邪), to regulate the **Nourishing** (*róng*, 荣) and **Defensive** (*wèi*, 卫) **Qi**, and to prevent stagnation. When the **Defensive Qi** scatters and the **Nourishing Qi** overflows, when **Qi** is exhausted and **blood** congeals—externally manifesting as **fever** (*fā rè*, 发热), internally as **shortness of breath** (*shǎo qì*, 少气)—needling these points to drain the **pathogenic factors** and restore balance is done without regard to their specific **Meeting points** or **Confluences**.

If **Nourishing Qi** accumulates and **Defensive Qi** stagnates, causing internal and external **imbalance** (*xiāngbó*, 相薄), one must needle where the **blood Collaterals** (*xuèluò*, 血络) appear and drain them immediately—again, without concern for the **Meeting points** or **Confluences** of the channels.

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish to hear more about the **Confluences of the Grand Collaterals** (*Xīgǔ*, 溪谷)."*

Qìbó replied: *"The **Confluences** of the **major flesh divisions** (*ròufèn*, 肉分) are called **Grand Confluences** (*xīgǔ*, 溪谷), while those of the **minor flesh divisions** are called **minor Confluences** (*xī*, 溪). The **Confluences** of the **flesh divisions** regulate the **Nourishing** and **Defensive Qi**, harmonizing with the **Great Qi** (*dàqì*, 大气). **Newly Corrected Version:** According to the *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* (甲乙经), this is written as *harmonizing with the **Great Qi** (合大气)*.

When **pathogenic factors** (*xíe*, 邪) obstruct and **Qi** stagnates, the **pulse** becomes hot and the flesh decays! If the **Nourishing** and **Defensive Qi** do not flow, it will inevitably lead to **pus** (*nóng*, 脓). If **pus** consumes the **bone marrow** (*guīyè*, 髓液) internally and ruptures the **thigh** (*dàwěi*, 大腘) externally, this is the result. If stagnation occurs at the **joints** (*jié*, 节), it will lead to **decay** (*bài*, 败). If stagnation occurs between the **bone joints** (*gǔjié*, 骨节) and where the **fluids** (*jīnyè*, 津液) perform their functions, the **bone marrow** (*guīyè*, 髓液) and **fluids** (*jīnyè*, 津液) will both be impaired, forming **pus**, and thus the **tendons** and **bones** will decay and rot, preventing **flexion and extension** (*qūshēn*, 屈伸).

If **Cold** (*hán*, 寒) accumulates and stagnates, the **Nourishing** and **Defensive Qi** will not reside there, causing the **tendons** to contract internally. **Newly Corrected Version:** According to the full text of Quán Yuánqǐ (全元起), this is written as *Cold causes the flesh to contract and the tendons to shrink*. The **ribs** and **elbows** will fail to extend, internally resulting in **bone numbness** (*gǔbì*, 骨痹), externally in **loss of sensation** (*bùrén*, 不仁). This is termed **Qi Deficiency** (*bùzú*, 不足), where **Great Cold** (*dàhán*, 大寒) lingers in the **Confluences**.

When **pathogenic factors** (*xíe*, 邪) are excessive and the **True Qi** (*zhēnqì*, 真气) is not nourished, the **bone marrow** overflows and is consumed internally, hence the condition arises. **Qi Deficiency** refers to **Yin Qi** (*yángqì*, 阳气) deficiency. When **Cold pathogenic factors** (*hánxíe*, 寒邪) linger externally, accumulating over time, **Yin Qi** cannot overcome them externally, causing internal consumption of the **tendons** and **bone marrow**, hence the term **Qi Deficiency**—where **Great Cold** (*dàhán*, 大寒) lingers in the **Confluences**.

The **365 Grand Confluences** also correspond to the year. Their minor **numbness** (*bì*, 痹) and **overflow** (*yìn*, 淫溢) follow the channels in their **circulation** (*xúngǔ*, 循脉往来). A **fine needle** (*wēizhēn*, 微针) may reach these, and the treatment follows the same principles as elsewhere. If the **Qi of minor Cold** (*xiǎohán*, 小寒) flows excessively and stagnates, causing **numbness** (*bì*, 痹) along the channels, needling to adjust it follows the same methods as usual.

The Yellow Emperor then parted his attendants, stood, and bowed twice, saying: *"Today, I have dispelled my ignorance and resolved my doubts. I shall preserve these teachings in the **Golden Treasury** (*Jīnkuì*, 金匮), and dare not speak of them again."* He then stored them in the **Golden Orchid Chamber** (*Jīnlán zhī shì*, 金兰之室), marking them as the locations of the **Qi points**.

Qìbó said: *"The **Collateral branches** (*sānlùo*, 孙络) that diverge from the primary channels—where the **blood** is abundant and must be drained—also number **365**, all converging upon the **Collaterals** (*luò*, 络) and transmitted through **twelve Collateral channels** (*shíèrlùomài*, 十四络脉), not just the **14 Collaterals** (*shísì luòmài*, 十四络脉). The **14 Collaterals** refer to the **Collaterals** of the **Twelve Primary Channels** (*shíèrjīng*, 十二经) combined with those of the **Governing Vessel** (*dūmài*, 督脉) and **Conception Vessel** (*rènmài*, 任脉). The **major Collateral** of the **Spleen** (*pízhīdàluò*, 脾之大络) originates in the **Spleen** itself, hence it is not included in this count.

Within the body, **ten Collaterals** (*shìmài*, 十脉) converge and drain into the **middle**. **Middle** refers to the **Collaterals** between the **Primary Channels** and **Secondary Channels** (*zhōngjīngluò*, 中经络). Though they run separately, they receive **pathogenic factors** and transmit them back to the **Collaterals** of the **Five Zàng Organs** (*wǔzàng*, 五藏), five on each side—thus, **ten Collaterals** in total.

**Chapter on the *Qi* Palaces – Discussion of the *Foot Taiyang* Pulse and Its *Qi* Emanations:**
The *Foot Taiyang* pulse emits *Qi* at seventy-eight points. Including the floating and superficial points that connect with them, one should speak of ninety-three points—not seventy-eight. The primary pulse channels converge at seventy-eight points, while the floating and superficial connections amount to fifteen points, such is their count.

Each brow ridge has one point—namely, the *Zuanzhu* (鑽竹) point. The location for acupuncture or moxibustion is determined by the *Qi* strength, following the same method as in the *Chapter on Qi* Emanations (*Qixue* 氣穴).

From the hairline to the nape (*top* 顶), five rows apart, with each row three inches apart—this refers to the *Dayu* (大杼) and *Fengmen* (風門) points, each having two points. The location for acupuncture or moxibustion is determined by the *Qi* strength, following the same method as in the *Chapter on Qi* Emanations.

**Newly Corrected Annotation:**
According to another version, it reads: "From the hairline to the nape (*top*), three inches." Another note states: "Inch refers to *shen* inch (身寸), and all inches follow the same method." This differs entirely from the current annotation.

This annotation states that *Dayu* (大杼) and *Fengmen* (風門) each have two points, and the location for moxibustion or acupuncture is determined by the *Qi* strength, following the same method as in the *Chapter on Qi* Emanations. However, the *Chapter on Qi* Emanations does not list a *Fengmen* point, yet the annotation claims it follows the same method—this discrepancy is evident.

This is not an error of Wang Bing’s (王氏), but of later scholars. Examining it closely: "From the hairline to the *top* (顶), three inches and a half, five rows apart, three inches apart"—this describes the floating *Qi* points within the five *rows* (五行) of the skin below. Therefore, Wang Bing did not explain further but simply stated that "inch" refers to *shen* inch (身寸). The mistake lies in the later scholars who misread *top* (顶) as *nape* (項), omitting the "half" character (半).

The reason it states "from the hairline to the *top* (顶), three inches" is that from the point where the *Foot Taiyang* pulse meets the *Baihui* (百會) at the crown, it spans roughly three inches to the *top*. From *Baihui* backward to the crown again is another three inches, hence "from the hairline to the *top*, three inches."

The "five rows apart" refers to the five *rows* (五行) that include the central line. The "three inches apart" means that from the *Baihui* at the center, measuring three inches forward, backward, left, and right, there are five *rows* with five points each, totaling twenty-five points.

The error of later scholars is clear: they misread *top* (顶) as *nape* (項), interpreting it as *Dayu* (大杼) and *Fengmen* (風門). This is utterly mistaken. Moreover, *Dayu* (大杼) is located below the first vertebra (第一椎) on both sides, while *Fengmen* (風門) is below the third vertebra (第三#2椎), and the text above states the hairline is not merely three inches and a half from the nape—this error is manifest.

(Indeed, it is true.)

The **floating *qi*** within the skin consists of five *rows*, each with five points, totaling twenty-five—five times five equals twenty-five.

**Floating *qi*** refers to *qi* that rises and circulates, capable of dispelling heat.

The five *rows* are those on the head, from the hairline to two inches behind the center, extending to the *top* afterward. The twenty-five points are as follows:

- The central *row*: *Guhui* (顧會), *Qianting* (前頂), *Baihui* (百會), *Houting* (後頂), and *Qiangwen* (強問)—five points along the *Governor Vessel* (督脈).

- The next two *rows* on either side: *Wuchu* (五處), *Chengguang* (承光), *Tongtian* (通天), *Luoque* (絡卻), and *Yuzhen* (玉枕)—five points each, the *qi* of the original meridian (本經).

- The following two *rows* on either side: *Linqi* (臨泣), *Muchuang* (目窗), *Zhengying* (正營), *Chengling* (承靈), and *Naokong* (腦空)—five points each, the *qi* of the Foot *Minor Yang* (足少陽).

The four *rows* on either side, each with five points, total twenty points. The central *row* with five points makes twenty-five in all.

The methods of acupuncture and moxibustion (*ci* and *jiu*) vary in strength, following the same principles as in *The Hot-Water Points* (《水熱穴》).

On either side of the **nape’s central great sinew** (項中大筋) is one point each—these are the *Tianzhu* (天柱) points. The methods of acupuncture and moxibustion here also follow the same principles as in *The Qi Points* (《氣穴》).

On either side of *Fengfu* (風府) is one point each—these are the *Fengchi* (風池) points. The methods of acupuncture and moxibustion also follow the same principles as in *The Qi Points*.

**Newly corrected annotation states**: According to *The Jia Yi Classic* (《甲乙經》), *Fengchi* (風池) is the convergence of the Foot *Minor Yang* (足少陽) and *Yangwei* (陽維); it is not where the Foot *Major Yang* (足太陽) originates. The text states that *Fengfu*’s two *rows* correspond to the division of the *Tianzhu* points, which also covers the two points on either side of the **nape’s central great sinew**. This annotation mistakenly adds *Fengchi* (二穴) outside the ninety-three points, and further mistakenly adds *Dayu* (大杼), *Fengmen* (風門), and these *Fengchi* (風池), totaling six extra points.

From the **shoulder blade ridge** (侠脊) below to the **tailbone** (尸尾), there are twenty-one segments and fifteen *rows* (十五問), each with one point:

- **附分** (*Fufen*) lies below the second vertebra (第二椎), adjacent to the nape’s inner border on both sides, each two inches apart from the shoulder blade ridge (侠脊), the convergence of the Foot *Major Yang* (足太陽). Acupuncture may penetrate to eight-tenths of an inch (同身寸之八分), and moxibustion may be applied up to five *zhuang* (壯).

- **魄户** (*Pohu*) lies below the third vertebra (第三椎) on both sides, directly above *Fufen*, originating from the Foot *Major Yang* meridian (足太陽脈氣). The remaining twelve points follow similarly, taken while seated upright. Acupuncture may penetrate to five-tenths of an inch (同身寸之五分), and moxibustion follows the method of *Fufen*.

- **神堂** (*Shentang*) lies below the fifth vertebra (第五椎) on both sides, directly above *Pohu*. Acupuncture may penetrate to three-tenths of an inch (同身寸之三分), and moxibustion follows the method of *Fufen*.

- **请嘻** (*Qingxi*) lies below the sixth vertebra (第六椎) on both sides, directly above *Shentang*.
**Newly corrected annotation states**: According to the *Bone Cavity Theory* (《骨空論》), when one presses with the palm while the patient utters the sound of *Qingxi* (請嘻), the point will pulsate beneath the fingers.
Acupuncture may penetrate to six-tenths of an inch (同身寸之六分), with retention for seven breaths (留七呼), and moxibustion follows the method of *Fufen*.

- **鬲关** (*Ge Guan*) lies below the seventh vertebra (第七椎) on both sides, directly above *Qingxi*, taken while seated upright with shoulders relaxed. Acupuncture may penetrate to five-tenths of an inch (同身寸之五分), and moxibustion may be applied up to three *zhuang* (壯).
**Newly corrected annotation states**: According to *The Jia Yi Classic* (《甲乙經》), moxibustion may be applied up to five *zhuang* (壯).

- **魂门** (*Hunmen*) lies below the ninth vertebra (第九椎) on both sides, directly above *Ge Guan*, taken while seated upright. The methods of acupuncture and moxibustion vary in strength as with *Ge Guan*.

- **阳纲** (*Yanggang*) lies below the tenth vertebra (第十椎) on both sides, directly above *Hunmen*. The methods of acupuncture and moxibustion vary in strength as with *Hunmen*.

- **意舍** (*Yishe*) lies below the eleventh vertebra (第十一椎) on both sides, directly above *Yanggang*, taken while seated upright. The methods of acupuncture and moxibustion vary in strength as with *Yanggang*.

- **胃仓** (*Weicang*) lies below the twelfth vertebra (第十二椎) on both sides, directly above *Yishe*. The methods of acupuncture and moxibustion vary in strength as with *Yishe*.

- **肓门** (*Huangmen*) lies below the thirteenth vertebra (第十三椎) on both sides, directly above *Weicang*. Acupuncture follows the method of *Weicang*, and moxibustion may be applied up to thirty *zhuang* (壯).
**Newly corrected annotation states**: According to *Huangmen* (肓門) moxibustion of thirty *zhuang* (壯), matching *The Jia Yi Classic* (《甲乙經》). The *Water Points* (《水穴》) annotation states moxibustion of three *zhuang*.

- **志室** (*Zhishi*) lies below the fourteenth vertebra (第十四椎) on both sides, directly above *Huangmen*, taken while seated upright. The methods of acupuncture and moxibustion vary in strength as with *Pohu*.

- **胞肓** (*Baohuang*) lies below the nineteenth vertebra (第十九椎) on both sides, directly above *Zhishi*, taken while prone. The methods of acupuncture and moxibustion vary in strength as with *Pohu*.
**Newly corrected annotation states**: According to *Zhishi* (志室) and *Baohuang* (胞肓), moxibustion follows the method of *Pohu* (魄户) with five *zhuang* (壯). *The Jia Yi Classic* (《甲乙經》) and the *Water Points* (《水穴》) annotation both state three *zhuang* (壯), and the *Hot Points* (《熱穴》) annotation for *Zhishi* also states three *zhuang*.

- **秩边** (*Zhibian*) lies below the twenty-first vertebra (第二十一椎) on both sides, directly above *Baohuang*, taken while prone. The methods of acupuncture and moxibustion vary in strength as with *Pohu*.

(*Qingxi* (請嘻) is pronounced as *Yi Xi* (衣下喜) in modern usage.)

The **Five Zang** (*Zang*) organs each have five **Shu points** (*Shu*), while the **Six Fu** (*Fu*) organs each have six. The **Lung Shu** (*Fei Shu*) lies below the third vertebra (*Di San Zui*) on both sides, equidistant from the midline of the spine as **Jiaji** (*Xia Ji*) at **one to one-and-a-half *cun*** of the body’s length. Needling may penetrate **three *cun*** of the body’s length, with retention for seven breaths. If moxibustion is applied, it may be done with **three *zhuang*** (*Zhuang*).

The **Heart Shu** (*Xin Shu*) lies below the fifth vertebra (*Di Wu Zui*) on both sides, with spacing and needling as the **Lung Shu**—retain for seven breaths. The **Liver Shu** (*Gan Shu*) lies below the ninth vertebra (*Di Jiu Zui*) on both sides, with spacing and needling as the **Heart Shu**—retain for six breaths.

The **Spleen Shu** (*Pi Shu*) lies below the eleventh vertebra (*Di Shi Yi Zui*) on both sides, with spacing and needling as the **Liver Shu**—retain for seven breaths. The **Kidney Shu** (*Shen Shu*) lies below the fourteenth vertebra (*Di Shi Si Zui*) on both sides, with spacing and needling as the **Spleen Shu**—retain for seven breaths.

The **Gallbladder Shu** (*Dan Shu*) lies below the tenth vertebra (*Di Shi Zui*) on both sides, with spacing as the **Lung Shu**; taken while seated upright. Needling may penetrate **five *cun*** of the body’s length, retained for seven breaths. The **Stomach Shu** (*Wei Shu*) lies below the twelfth vertebra (*Di Shi Er Zui*) on both sides, with spacing and needling as the **Spleen Shu**—retain for seven breaths.

The **Triple Burner Shu** (*San Jiao Shu*) lies below the thirteenth vertebra (*Di Shi San Zui*) on both sides, with spacing and needling as the **Gallbladder Shu**.

The **Large Intestine Shu** (*Da Chang Shu*) lies below the sixteenth vertebra (*Di Shi Liu Zui*) on both sides, with spacing and needling as the **Lung Shu**—retain for six breaths. The **Small Intestine Shu** (*Xiao Chang Shu*) lies below the eighteenth vertebra (*Di Shi Ba Zui*) on both sides, with spacing and needling as the **Heart Shu**—retain for six breaths.

The **Bladder Shu** (*Pang Guang Shu*) lies below the nineteenth vertebra (*Di Shi Jiu Zui*) on both sides, with spacing and needling as the **Kidney Shu**—retain for six breaths. For the **Five Zang and Six Fu Shu points**, if moxibustion is applied, it may be done with **three *zhuang***.

---
**Newly corrected annotation states**: Upon closer examination, the claim in some texts that the **Five Zang** have five **Shu points** and the **Six Fu** have six is not erroneous. The term *各* (*ge*) means each organ has its corresponding points on both sides (left and right), not that each individual point is counted separately for five or six. From **Weizhong** (*Wei Zhong*) downward to the side of the little toe of the foot, there are six **Shu points** in total: **Weizhong**, **Kunlun**, **Jinggu**, **Shugu**, **Tonggu**, and **Zhi Yin**—six points in all. When considering left and right, they total **twelve *Shu***. Their needling and moxibustion methods follow the **Qi Xue** (*Qi Xue*) method. The classics state that there are **seventy-eight *Xue*** (*Xue*) where **pulse-qi** (*Mai Qi*)** originates, but the total here, including those omitted, amounts to **ninety-three *Xue***. This discrepancy suggests errors in transmission and copying of the larger count.

---
**Newly corrected annotation states**: According to **Wang’s** (*Wang Shi*) analysis, the total of **ninety-three *Xue*** is incorrect when accounting for **Dazhu** (*Da Zhu*), **Fengmen** (*Feng Men*), and **Fengchi** (*Feng Chi*), which brings the total to **ninety-nine *Xue***. Thus, it is clear that **Wang** recognized the latter three as mistakenly added later.

The **Minor Yang of Foot Shu** (*Zuo Shao Yang Mai Qi*)** originates **sixty-two *Xue***:
On both sides above the **ear angle** (*Jiao*), there are **two *Xue***—**Tian Chong** (*Tian Chong*) and **Qu Bin** (*Qu Bin*), one on each side. **Tian Chong** lies above the ear at **three *cun*** of the body’s length, where the **Foot Taiyang** (*Zuo Taiyang*) and **Foot Shaoyang** (*Zuo Shaoyang*) meridians converge. Needling may penetrate **three *cun*** of the body’s length; if moxibustion is applied, it may be done with **three *zhuang***.

**Qu Bin** lies above the ear, at the **curved depression** (*Qu Yang Yan*) where the hairline meets the **ear’s angle** (*Qu Jiao*), with a hollow space near the **mandible** (*Gu Li*). It is where the **Foot Taiyang** and **Foot Shaoyang** meridians converge. Needling and moxibustion follow the method of **Tian Chong**—with **three *zhuang***.

On both sides above the **inner hairline** (*Zhi Mu Shang*), there are **five *Xue***—**Lin Qi** (*Lin Qi*), **Mu Chuang** (*Mu Chuang*), **Zheng Ying** (*Zheng Ying*), **Cheng Ling** (*Cheng Ling*), and **Nao Kong** (*Nao Kong*), one on each side. **Lin Qi** lies directly above the **inner hairline** (*Zhi Mu*) at **five *cun*** of the body’s length, where the **Foot Taiyang**, **Foot Shaoyang**, and **Yang Wei** (*Yang Wei*) meridians converge. Retain for seven breaths.

**Mu Chuang** lies **one *cun*** behind **Lin Qi**; **Zheng Ying** lies **one *cun*** behind **Mu Chuang**; **Cheng Ling** lies **one-and-a-half *cun*** behind **Zheng Ying**; and **Nao Kong** lies **one-and-a-half *cun*** behind **Cheng Ling**, above the **occipital bone** (*Zhi Zhu*) and behind the **gun* (*Zhi Gun*)** bone. All are where the **Foot Shaoyang** and **Yang Wei** meridians converge. Needling may penetrate **four *cun*** of the body’s length for **Nao Kong**, and **three *cun*** for the rest. If moxibustion is applied, it may be done with **five *zhuang***.

---
**Newly corrected annotation states**: According to the **ear’s angle** (*Jiao*), **Nao Kong** lies above the **occipital bone** (*Zhi Zhu*) and behind the **gun* (*Zhi Gun*)** bone, while the **Jia Yi Classic** (*Jia Yi Jing*) states it lies below the **Yu Zhu** (*Yu Zhu*)** bone.

On both sides above the **ear’s anterior angle** (*Jiao Qian*), there is **one *Xue***—the **Jia Yan** (*Jia Yan*)** points, **Ji Yan** (*Ji Yan*)** and **Ren Ye** (*Ren Ye*)** in total. They lie above the **prominent cheekbone** (*Xian Zhu*)** at the **uppermost point of the hollow** (*Shang Kang*)** below the **ear’s curved angle** (*Qu Jiao*), where the **Hand Shaoyang**, **Foot Shaoyang**, and **Foot Yangming** meridians converge. Needling may penetrate **seven *cun*** of the body’s length, retained for seven breaths; if moxibustion is applied, it may be done with **three *zhuang***. Deep needling may render the patient’s ear **unable to hear**.

(*Xian* is pronounced as *Ren* (*Ren*)**—**She Xie** (*She Xie*)** cut. *E* (*E*)** is pronounced as *Ru* (*Ru*)**—**Che** (*Che*)** cut.)

Beneath the **ear’s anterior angle** (*Jiao Qian*)**, one point each on both sides—**the **Xuan Li** (*Xuan Li*)** points.

Below the **ear’s curved angle** (*Qu Jiao*), above the **prominent cheekbone** (*Xian Zhu*), at the **uppermost point of the hollow** (*Shang Kang*), where the **Hand Shaoyang**, **Foot Shaoyang**, and **Foot Yangming** meridians converge, the **Xuan Li** (*Xuan Li*)** points lie. Needling may penetrate **three *cun*** of the body’s length, retained for seven breaths; if moxibustion is applied, it may be done with **three *zhuang***. (*New annotation*: According to the text, the **Hand Shaoyang** meridian is mentioned instead of **Foot Shaoyang** in the *Jia Yi Jing*.)

Beneath the **ear’s curved angle** (*Qu Jiao*), above the **prominent cheekbone** (*Xian Zhu*), at the **lower hollow** (*Xia Kang*), where the **Hand Shaoyang**, **Foot Shaoyang**, and **Yangming** meridians meet, the **He Long** (*He Long*)** points lie. Needling may penetrate **three *cun*** of the body’s length; if moxibustion is applied, it may be done with **three *zhuang***. (*New annotation*: According to the *Jia Yi Jing*, it states **Hand Shaoyang** and **Foot Taiyang** instead.)

Behind the ear, at the **sunken center** (*Xian Zhong*), one point each on both sides—**the Yi Feng** (*Yi Feng*)** points. They lie in the depression behind the ear, where pressing draws the ear inward; the **Hand Shaoyang** and **Foot Shaoyang** meridians converge here. Needling may penetrate **three *cun*** of the body’s length; if moxibustion is applied, it may be done with **three *zhuang***.**

**Xia Guan** (*Xia Guan*)**, one point each on both sides—**Xia Guan** (*Xia Guan*)** is the point’s name. The method of needling and moxibustion is the same as in *Qi Xue*.**

Beneath the ear, behind the **jaw hinge** (*Ya Che*), one point each on both sides—**the Jie Che** (*Jie Che*)** points. The depth and retention of needling and the number of moxa cones follow the method in *Qi Xue*.**

**Que Pen** (*Que Pen*)**, one point each on both sides—**Que Pen** (*Que Pen*)** is the point’s name. It lies in the depression above the transverse bone of the shoulder, where the **Foot Yangming** meridian’s *qi* emerges. Needling may penetrate **two *cun*** of the body’s length, retained for seven breaths; if moxibustion is applied, it may be done with **three *zhuang***, but too deep may cause **inverted breathing** (*Ni Xi*). (*New annotation*: According to the *Gu Kong* annotation, it should be **Hand Yangming**.)

Three *cun* below the armpit, from the armpit to the **lower ribs** (*Zhi*), eight intervals each with one point—**Yuan Ye** (*Yuan Ye*)**, **Zhe Jin** (*Zhe Jin*)**, **Tian Chi** (*Tian Chi*)**, **Ri Yue** (*Ri Yue*)**, **Zhang Men** (*Zhang Men*)**, **Dai Mai** (*Dai Mai*)**, **Wu Shu** (*Wu Shu*)**, **Wei Dao** (*Wei Dao*)**, and **Ju Long** (*Ju Long*)**—a total of eighteen points.

**Yuan Ye** (*Yuan Ye*)** lies three *cun* below the armpit, where the **Foot Shaoyang** meridian’s *qi* emerges. It is found by raising the arm; needling may penetrate **three *cun*** of the body’s length, but moxibustion is prohibited.

**Zhe Jin** (*Zhe Jin*)** lies three *cun* below the armpit, then one *cun* forward from the previous point, pressing the side. (*New annotation*: According to the *Jia Yi Jing*, "pressing" should be read as "touching.") The **Foot Shaoyang** meridian’s *qi* emerges here; needling may penetrate **six *cun*** of the body’s length, or if moxibustion is applied, it may be done with **three *zhuang***.

**Tian Chi** (*Tian Chi*)** lies two *cun* behind the nipple, (*New annotation*: According to the *Jia Yi Jing*, it should be one *cun*.) where the **Hand Shaoyang** and **Foot Shaoyang** meridians converge. Needling may penetrate **three *cun*** of the body’s length, (*New annotation*: According to the *Jia Yi Jing*, it should be seven *cun*.) or if moxibustion is applied, it may be done with **three *zhuang***.

**Ri Yue** (*Ri Yue*)**, the *mu* point of the gallbladder, lies at the end of the third rib, two *cun* and five *fen* horizontally and vertically beside the **heart’s lateral bone** (*Xin Bi Guan*). It aligns upward with the midpoint between the two nipples. (*New annotation*: According to the *Jia Yi Jing*, **Ri Yue** lies five *fen* below **Qi Men**.) The **Foot Taiyin** and **Foot Shaoyang** meridians converge here; needling may penetrate **seven *cun*** of the body’s length, or if moxibustion is applied, it may be done with **five *zhuang***.

**Zhang Men** (*Zhang Men*)**, the *mu* point of the spleen, lies at the end of the fourth rib, where the **Foot Jueyin** and **Foot Shaoyang** meridians converge. It is accessed by bending the upper body outward, extending the lower body downward, and raising the arm. Needling may penetrate **eight *cun*** of the body’s length, retained for six breaths; if moxibustion is applied, it may be done with **three *zhuang***.

**Dai Mai** (*Dai Mai*)** lies one *cun* and eight *fen* below the fourth rib, where the **Foot Shaoyang** and **Dai Mai** meridians meet. Needling may penetrate **six *cun*** of the body’s length, or if moxibustion is applied, it may be done with **five *zhuang***.

**Wu Shu** (*Wu Shu*)** lies three *cun* below **Dai Mai**, where the **Foot Shaoyang** and **Dai Mai** meridians meet. Needling may penetrate **one *cun*** of the body’s length, or if moxibustion is applied, it may be done with **five *zhuang***.

**Wei Dao** (*Wei Dao*)** lies five *cun* and three *fen* below **Zhang Men**, where the **Foot Shaoyang** and **Dai Mai** meridians meet. The method of needling and moxibustion follows that of **Zhang Men**.

**Ju Long** (*Ju Long*)** lies four *cun* and three *fen* below **Zhang Men**, above the **hip bone** (*Kuo Guan*). (*New annotation*: According to the *Jia Yi Jing*, it should be **Jian Guan**.) In the depression, where the **Foot Shaoyang** and **Dai Mai** meridians converge, the method of needling and moxibustion follows that of **Wei Dao**.

From the knee downward to the **second toe** (*Xiao Zhi*)** and **little toe** (*Xiao Zhi*)** beside the little toe, there are six *yu* points each on both sides—**Yang Lingquan** (*Yang Lingquan*)**, **Yang Fu** (*Yang Fu*)**, **Qiu Xu** (*Qiu Xu*)**, **Lin Qi** (*Lin Qi*)**, **Xia Xi** (*Xia Xi*)**, and **Qiao Yin** (*Qiao Yin*)**—a total of twelve points when counted on both sides.

On both sides beside the **umbilical center** (*Shu Zhong*)**, one point each—**the **Huan Yao** (*Huan Yao*)** points. The method of needling and moxibustion follows that in *Qi Xue*. (*New annotation*: According to the *Qi Xue Lun*, it states "two *Shu* intervals beside the center," and Wang’s annotation identifies it as the **Huan Yao** point. Additionally, the *Jia Yi Jing* annotation states: **Huan Yao** lies within the **umbilical center** (*Shu Zhong*). The current text refers to this point lying within the **umbilical center** (*Shu Zhong*), with one point on each side.)

The needling and moxibustion methods for these points follow the *Qi Xue* principles.

The **Foot Yangming** (*Yangming*) meridian **qi** points total sixty-eight:
Three points on each side at the hairline near the forehead—
namely, **Xuan Lu** (*Xuan Lu*), **Yang Bai** (*Yang Bai*), and **Tou Wei** (*Tou Wei*), six points in total when counted on both sides.

Counting horizontally along the frontal hairline, **Xuan Lu** is located above the **Qu Jiao** (*曲角*, curved temple) at the midpoint between the eyes, where the **Foot Yangming** meridian **qi** arises. Needling may penetrate to three-fifths of the **same-body inch** (*tóngshēn cùn*), with a retention of three breaths. If moxibustion is applied, three **moxa cones** (*zhàng*) may be used.

**Yang Bai** is situated one **same-body inch** above the pupil, directly in line with the eye’s center, where the **Foot Yangming** and **Yinwei** meridians converge. Needling may penetrate to three-fifths of the **same-body inch**, and moxibustion may apply three **moxa cones**.

**Tou Wei** lies at the hairline of the forehead, one **same-body inch** and five-fifths (i.e., one and a half **same-body inches**) beside **Qi Ben** (*Qi Ben*) and **Shen** (*神*), where the **Foot Shaoyang** and **Foot Yangming** meridians intersect. Needling may penetrate to five-fifths of the **same-body inch**, but moxibustion is forbidden.

(*New annotation*: According to the *Jia Yi Jing*, **Yang Bai** is where the **Foot Shaoyang** and **Yinwei** meridians meet. Wang’s current annotation states it is where the **Foot Yangming** and **Yinwei** meridians meet. Given its placement within the **Foot Yangming** meridian **qi** points, Wang’s annotation is more plausible. However, the **Yangming** meridian does not reach this location, nor does it intersect with **Yinwei**, so Wang’s annotation may be incorrect, and the *Jia Yi Jing* may be accurate.)

One point each on the sides of the **forehead bone** (*miàn* **□** *gǔ* *kòng*)—
namely, the **Si Bai** (*四白*) point.

Located one **same-body inch** below the eye, where the **Foot Yangming** meridian **qi** arises, needling may penetrate to four-fifths of the **same-body inch**, but moxibustion is forbidden.

(*New annotation*: According to the *Jia Yi Jing*, needling may penetrate to three-fifths, and moxibustion may apply seven **moxa cones**.)

One point each on the sides of the **Great Welcome** (*Dà Yíng*) bone cavity—
**Dà Yíng**, a **qi** point name.

Located one **same-body inch** and three-fifths forward of the **Qu Li** (*曲颌*, curved jaw), within the depression of the bone where the **pulsing artery** (*dòng mài*) is felt, where the **Foot Yangming** meridian **qi** arises. Needling may penetrate to three-fifths of the **same-body inch**, with a retention of seven breaths. If moxibustion is applied, three **moxa cones** may be used.

One point each at **Human Welcome** (*Rén Yíng*)—
**Rén Yíng**, a **qi** point name.

Located beside the **laryngeal prominence** (*jié hóu*, Adam’s apple) at the **sides of the neck** (*jiǎng xià*), where the **large artery** (*dà mài*) pulses upon touch, where the **Foot Yangming** meridian **qi** arises. Needling may penetrate to four-fifths of the **same-body inch**; excessive depth may be fatal. Moxibustion is forbidden.

One point each on the outer side of the **collarbone depression** (*Qué Pén* **wài** **□** *gǔ* *kòng*)—
namely, the **Tiān Lu** (*天髅*) and **Er** (*二*) points.

Located in the **supraclavicular fossa** (*jiān què pén*), above the **depressed bone** (*fú gǔ*), within the hollow where the **Hand Shao** and **Foot Shaoyang**, and **Yangwei** meridians converge. Needling may penetrate to eight-fifths of the **same-body inch**, and if moxibustion is applied, three **moxa cones** may be used.

(*New annotation*: According to the *Jia Yi Jing*, "depressed bone" (*fú gǔ*) should be read as **Ser Bone** (*Sè Gǔ*, *音必*—pronounced *bì*).)

One point each between the **breastbone** (*yīng zhōng*) **qi** points.

These are the **Yīng Chuāng** and related six points.
**Yīng Chuāng** lie on both sides of the chest, four **same-body inches** apart along the **collarbone depression** (*Qué Pén*), and eight-fifths of the **same-body inch** below the **Ser Bone** (*Sè Gǔ*), within the hollow. They are where the **Foot Yangming** meridian’s **qi** manifests; they are taken while reclining backward. Needling may penetrate to four-fifths of the **same-body inch**, and if moxibustion is applied, up to five **moxa cones** may be used.

Above these points are **Qì Hù**, **Kù Fáng**, and **Wū Yì**, while below them are **Rǔ Zhōng** and **Rǔ Gēn**.
**Qì Hù** is located eight-fifths of the **same-body inch** above **Yīng Chuāng**, directly below the **Ser Bone**.
**Kù Fáng** is one **same-body inch** and six-fifths below **Qì Hù**.
**Wū Yì** is three **same-body inches** and two-fifths below **Qì Hù**, directly above **Yīng Chuāng**.
Below **Yīng Chuāng** is **Rǔ Zhōng**, and one **same-body inch** and six-fifths below **Rǔ Zhōng** is **Rǔ Gēn**.
All are where the **Foot Yangming** meridian’s **qi** manifests; they are taken while reclining backward.
**Rǔ Zhōng** is forbidden for moxibustion or needling. If moxibustion or needling accidentally causes an ulcer with clear **dharma** fluid and blood pus, it may be treated; but if the ulcer contains **zhì** flesh or is fatal, death follows.
The remaining five points may be needled to four-fifths of the **same-body inch**, and if moxibustion is applied, up to three **moxa cones** may be used.

(*New annotation*: According to the *Jia Yi Jing*, five **moxa cones** may be used for moxibustion.)

Outside the **collarbone depression** (*Qué Pén*), three **same-body inches** below the breast, are five points—
namely, **Bù Róng**, **Chéng Mǎn**, **Liáng mén**, **Guān mén**, and **Tài Yǐ**.
Left and right, they total one **same-body inch** apart.
Four **same-body inches** apart along both sides of the **abdomen** (*fù*).
(*New annotation*: According to the *Jia Yi Jing*, each is two **same-body inches** apart. It is suspected that this annotation mistakenly omits the "each" character.)

**Bù Róng** is on the end of the fourth rib, one **same-body inch** above and below **Tài Yǐ**; it is where the **Foot Yangming** meridian’s **qi** manifests. Needling may penetrate to eight-fifths of the **same-body inch**, and if moxibustion is applied, up to three **moxa cones** may be used.
(*New annotation*: According to the *Jia Yi Jing*, **Bù Róng** may be needled to five-fifths of the **same-body inch**; here, it is said to penetrate to eight-fifths, which may be an error in this annotation.)

Three points each, three **same-body inches** from the **level of the umbilicus** (*Qí*).
The "three **same-body inches**" refers to the distance from the **level of the umbilicus** (*Qí*).
The three points are **Huá Ròu mén**, **Tiān Shū**, and **Wài Líng**.
**Huá Ròu mén** is one **same-body inch** below **Tài Yǐ**.
**Tiān Shū** is one **same-body inch** below **Huá Ròu mén**, directly aligned with the **level of the umbilicus** (*Qí*).
**Wài Líng** is one **same-body inch** below **Tiān Shū**; all are where the **Foot Yangming** meridian’s **qi** manifests.
Needling **Tiān Shū** may penetrate to five-fifths of the **same-body inch**, with retention for seven breaths. For **Huá Ròu mén** and **Wài Líng**, needling may penetrate to eight-fifths of the **same-body inch**, and if moxibustion is applied, up to five **moxa cones** may be used.
(*New annotation*: According to the *Jia Yi Jing*, **Tiān Shū** is two **same-body inches** from the **level of the umbilicus** (*Qí*), with **Huá Ròu mén** above and **Wài Líng** below, making three points each, two **same-body inches** apart from the **level of the umbilicus** (*Qí*). This text’s annotation differs from the *Su Wen* and *Jia Yi Jing*, though the *Jia Yi Jing*’s division of **same-body inches** aligns with other texts, while this text alone is inconsistent.)

Three points each, two **same-body inches** below the **level of the umbilicus** (*Qí*).
Below the **level of the umbilicus** (*Qí*) by two **same-body inches**, **Wài Líng** is one **same-body inch** below, marking the **Dà Jù** point.
The three points are **Dà Jù**, **Shuǐ Dào**, and **Guī Lái**.
**Dà Jù** is one **same-body inch** below **Wài Líng**, where the **Foot Yangming** meridian’s **qi** manifests. Needling may penetrate to eight-fifths of the **same-body inch**, and if moxibustion is applied, up to five **moxa cones** may be used.
**Shuǐ Dào** is three **same-body inches** below **Dà Jù**, where the **Foot Yangming** meridian’s **qi** manifests. Needling may penetrate to two **same-body inches** and five-fifths, and if moxibustion is applied, up to five **moxa cones** may be used.
**Guī Lái** is two **same-body inches** below **Shuǐ Dào**; needling may penetrate to eight-fifths of the **same-body inch**, and if moxibustion is applied, up to five **moxa cones** may be used.

**Qì Jiē** and **Dòng Mài** points, one each.
**Qì Jiē** is a point name. Located below **Guī Lái**, on the **Mouse Calf** (*Shǔ Jì*)’s **qi** pulse, one **same-body inch** above the pulse, where the **Foot Yangming** meridian’s **qi** manifests. Needling may penetrate to three-fifths of the **same-body inch**, with retention for seven breaths; if moxibustion is applied, up to three **moxa cones** may be used.
(*New annotation*: This annotation aligns with the *Jia Yi Jing*. In the *Sutras on Needling Heat* and *Sutras on Heat Points*, it is noted that **Qì Jiē** lies below the **navel** (*qí*), on both ends of the **horizontal bone** (*héng gǔ*), above the **Mouse Calf** (*Shǔ Jì*). In the *Treatise on Forbidden Needling*, it is noted that **Qì Jiē** lies on both sides of the **abdomen** (*fù*), four **same-body inches** apart, above the **Mouse Calf** (*Shǔ Jì*). In the *Bone Space* annotation, it is noted that **Qì Jiē** lies on both sides of the **hairline** (*máo jì*), above the **Mouse Calf** (*Shǔ Jì*). These annotations differ; all are recorded here.)

One point each above the **Mouse Calf** (*Fú Tú*).
Namely, the **Pái Guān** and **Jī Guān** points.
Located behind the **knee** (*xī*), within the **intersection of the creases** (*jiāo fèn*), needling may penetrate to six-fifths of the **same-body inch**, and if moxibustion is applied, up to three **moxa cones** may be used.

From **Sān Lǐ** downward to the **middle toe** (*zhōng zhǐ*), there are eight **acupoint divisions** (*yù*), where the **meridian intersections** (*xué kòng*) lie—
namely, **Sān Lǐ**, **Shàng Kāng**, **Xià Lián**, **Jiě Xī**, **Chōng Yáng**, **Xiàn Gǔ**, **Nèi Tíng**, and **Lì Duì**, totaling sixteen **acupoint divisions** (*yù*) when left and right are counted.

**Shàng Lián** is where the **Foot Yangming** and **Large Intestine** meridians converge, while **Xià Kāng** is where the **Foot Yangming** and **Small Intestine** meridians converge. Their needling and moxibustion methods follow the same **acupoint divisions** (*yù*) as in the *Sutras on Qi Points*.

The so-called **meridian intersections** (*xué kòng*) refer to the **Foot Yangming** meridian branching downward from **Sān Lǐ**. Its main branch follows the **abdominal organs** (*fǔ*), passes through **Fù** and enters **Middle Toe** (*Zhōng Zhǐ*), emerging at its end, which is **Lì Duì**. Its secondary branch accompanies the main one to **Middle Toe** (*Zhōng Zhǐ*), then enters the **middle toe** (*zhōng zhǐ*)’s **joint space** (*xiāng kòng*), hence the term **meridian intersections** (*xué kòng*).
**Zhī** means *to go*.

The **divergent branches** each proceed to their respective **finger and toe joints**, marking the **meridian intersections** (*xué kòng*).

The **Hand Taiyang** meridian’s **acupoints** (*yù*) number thirty-six, with **one pair** at **Inner Canthus** (*Mù Nèi Pí*), namely the **two points of *Jīng Míng***. Located at the **Inner Canthus**, it is the convergence of the **Hand and Foot Taiyang**, **Foot Yangming**, **Yin Tà** and **Yang Tà** meridians. Needling may penetrate to **one *tóngshēn cùn*** (a unit of measurement), retained for **six breaths**; if moxibustion is applied, **three *zhàng*** may be used.

Where multiple meridians converge but the needling is not specified beneath the convergence point, it follows the **primary channel’s path**.

**One pair** at **Outer Canthus** (*Mù Wài Pí*), namely the **two points of *Tóng Zǐ Lù***. Located **five *tóngshēn cùn*** from the **Inner Canthus**, it is the convergence of the **Hand Taiyang**, **Hand and Foot Shào Yang** meridians. Needling may penetrate to **three *tóngshēn cùn***; if moxibustion is applied, **three *zhàng*** may be used.

**One pair** beneath the **□ bone**, namely the **two points of *Gù Lóu***. □, meaning *stubborn* (*wán*). **Stubborn** refers to the **facial cheekbone**. Located in the **depression beneath the cheekbone**, it is the convergence of the **Hand Taiyang** and **Shào Yang** meridians. Needling may penetrate to **three *tóngshēn cùn***.
(*Shùn*, pronounced as *qiú*.)

**Ear lobe above, one pair each,**
namely the **two points of *Jiǎo Sūn***#8. Located **between the upper middle of the ear lobe’s outer edge** and beneath the hairline, where there is a hollow when the mouth opens, it is the convergence of the **Hand Taiyang**, **Hand and Foot Shào Yang** meridians. Needling may penetrate to **three *tóngshēn cùn***; if moxibustion is applied, **three *zhàng*** may be used.
(*New annotation*: According to the *Jiǎ Yǔ Jīng*, "Hand Taiyang" should read as "Hand Yangming.")

**Within the ear, one pair each,**
namely the **two points of *Tīng Guān***. The locations for needling and moxibustion, along with the number of *zhàng*, follow the same method as in *Qì Xué*.

**Jù Gǔ (Giant Bone) point, one pair each,**
*Jù Gǔ* being the name of the point. Located **in the depression between the two forked bones** above the shoulder end, it is the convergence of the **Hand Yangming** and **Tào Mài** meridians. Needling may penetrate to **one and a half *tóngshēn cùn***; if moxibustion is applied, **three *zhàng*** may be used.
(*New annotation*: According to the *Jiǎ Yǔ Jīng*, this should be **five *zhàng***.)

**Above the *Qū Yè* bone, one pair each,**
namely the **two points of *Nuò Shū***. Located **in the depression above the *pì* bone** (the large bone beneath the shoulder blade) and the *shāng kàng* (upper ridge), it is the convergence of the **Hand Taiyang**, **Yang Wéi**, and **Tào Mài** meridians. The point is accessed by raising the arm; needling may penetrate to **eight-tenths of a *tóngshēn cùn***; if moxibustion is applied, **three *zhàng*** may be used.
(*New annotation*: According to the *Jiǎ Yǔ Jīng*, this should read as "Hand and Foot Taiyang.")

**Above the *zhù gǔ* (pillar bone) depression, one pair each,**
namely the **two points of *Jiān Jǐng***. Located **in the depression above the *jiě* (shoulder joint)** and the *quē pén* (suprasternal fossa), before the large bone, it is the convergence of the **Hand and Foot Shào Yang** and **Yang Wéi** meridians. Needling may penetrate to **five-tenths of a *tóngshēn cùn***; if moxibustion is applied, **three *zhàng*** may be used.

**Four *cùn* above *Tiān Chuāng*, one pair each,**
namely the **four points of *Tiān Chuāng* and *Qiào Yīn***. The locations for needling and moxibustion, along with the number of *zhàng*, follow the same method as in *Qì Xué*.

**Shoulder joint (*Jiān Jiě*), one pair each,**
namely the **two points of *Bǐng Fēng***. Located **behind the small *gōu* (hump) on the shoulder**, where a hollow appears when the arm is raised, it is the convergence of the **Hand Taiyang**, **Hand Yangming**, **Hand and Foot Shào Yang** meridians. The point is accessed by raising the arm; needling may penetrate to **five-tenths of a *tóngshēn cùn***; if moxibustion is applied, **three *zhàng*** may be used.
(*New annotation*: According to the *Jiǎ Yǔ Jīng*, moxibustion should be **five *zhàng***.)

**Three *cùn* below the shoulder joint, one pair each,**
namely the **two points of *Tiān Zōng***. Located **in the depression beneath the large bone behind *Bǐng Fēng***, it is where the **Hand Taiyang meridian’s qi** emerges. Needling may penetrate to **five-tenths of a *tóngshēn cùn***, with the needle retained for **six breaths**; if moxibustion is applied, **three *zhàng*** may be used.

**From the elbow downward to the base of the little finger, six *shù* (acupoints) each.**
The six *shù* originate from the fingertip; the text states "until the base of the little finger," meaning the **tip as the base**, a convention also applied to the **Yangming and Shào Yang** passages below.
These six *shù* are the **Shào Hǎi**, **Yáng Gǔ**, **Wàn Gǔ**, **Hòu Xī**, **Qián Gǔ**, and **Shào Zé** points. Counting both left and right, there are **twelve *shù*** in total. The locations for needling and moxibustion, along with the number of *zhàng*, follow the same method as in *Qì Xué*.
(*New annotation*: According to this passage, the **Hand Taiyang**, **Yangming**, and **Shào Yang** meridians each state "until the base of the [respective] finger," but Master Wáng’s annotation that the "tip is the base" is incorrect. Examining the **well points of the three Hand Yang meridians**, all emerge from the **tips of the respective fingers**, beneath the nail beds. If "base" refers to the **root of the nail**, how could the "tip" be considered the base? The **Hand Yangming meridian’s qi** emerges at **twenty-two points**:
**Outer edge of the nasal cavity, two pairs on the neck,**
namely the **two *Yíng Xiāng*** and **two *Fú Tú*** points. *Yíng Xiāng* is located beside the nostrils, where the **Hand and Foot Yangming** meridians converge. Needling may penetrate to **three-tenths of a *tóngshēn cùn***.
*Fú Tú* is located **two *tóngshēn cùn*** below the *qū jiá* (curved jaw), behind the *rén yíng* (laryngeal pulse), where the **Hand Yangming meridian’s qi** emerges in four branches. The point is accessed by tilting the head back; needling may penetrate to **four-tenths of a *tóngshēn cùn***; if moxibustion is applied, **three *zhàng*** may be used.

**Hollow of the *Dà Yíng* bone, one pair each,**
*Dà Yíng* being the name of the point. Located **one *cùn* and three-tenths** forward from the *qū jǐng* (curved chin), in the depression of the bone where the pulse moves, it is where the **Foot Yangming meridian’s qi** emerges. Needling may penetrate to **three-tenths of a *tóngshēn cùn***, with the needle retained for **seven breaths**; if moxibustion is applied, **three *zhàng*** may be used.
(*New annotation*: The *Dà Yíng* point has already been recorded in the earlier **Foot Yangming meridian** section; its reappearance here, like *Gù Lóu*, follows the dual-occurrence principle, though Master Wáng does not note this.)

**Convergence at the *zhù gǔ* (pillar bone), one pair each,**
namely the **two *Tiān Dǐng*** points. Located **above the suprasternal fossa**, directly behind *Fú Tú*, half a *tóngshēn cùn* from the *qì shè* (residence of qi), it is where the **Hand Yangming meridian’s qi** emerges. Needling may penetrate to **four-tenths of a *tóngshēn cùn***; if moxibustion is applied, **three *zhàng*** may be used.
(*New annotation*: According to the *Jiǎ Yǔ Jīng*, this should be **one and a half *cùn***.)

**Convergence at the *kē gǔ* (joint bone), one pair each,**
namely the **two *Jiān Gōu*** points. The locations for needling and moxibustion, along with the number of *zhàng*, follow the same method as in *Qì Xué*.
(*New annotation*: The *gōu gǔ* (hump bone) is not recorded in *Qì Xué*, but appears in the annotations of *Cì Rè*, *Shuǐ Rè Xué*, and *Gǔ Kòng Lùn*.)

**From the elbow downward to the base of the index finger, six *shù* each,**
namely the **Sān Lǐ**, **Yáng Xī**, **Hé Gǔ**, **Sān Wèn**, **Èr Xián**, and **Shāng Yáng** points. Counting both left and right, there are **twelve *shù*** in total. The locations for needling and moxibustion, along with the number of *zhàng*, follow the same method as in *Qì Xué*.
(*New annotation*: According to *Qì Xué Lùn*, *Qū Chí* (Elbow Crevice) is recorded, but **Sān Lǐ** (Three Miles) is absent. *Qū Chí* is the **Hand Yangming’s convergence point**; this passage mistakenly omits *Qū Chí* while including *Sān Lǐ*.)

**Hand Shào Yang meridian’s qi emerges at thirty-two points:**
**Below the *tán gǔ* (snoring bone), one pair each,**
namely the **two *Guān Lóu*** points. The locations for needling and moxibustion, along with the number of *zhàng*, follow the same method as the **Hand Shào Yang meridian**.
This point is where the **Hand Shào Yang and Taiyang meridians’ qi** both converge equally, with no distinction in priority, hence its repeated mention here. The same applies below where such cases occur.

Behind the eyebrows, one pair each—
namely the **Sī Zhú Kòng** (Silk-Bamboo Hollow) points.
Located in the depression behind the eyebrows, where the **Hand Shào Yang meridian’s qi** emerges.
Needling may penetrate **three *fēn* of the *cùn*** (one-tenth of a *cùn*), with retention for six breaths.
**Moxibustion is forbidden**; improper use may cause **shrinking vision or blindness**.

(*New annotation*: According to *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng*, "Hand Shào Yang" should read "Foot Shào Yang," and "retain for six breaths" should be "three breaths.")

Above the horns, one pair each—
namely the **Xuán Lí** (Suspended Lintel) points.
This corresponds with the **Foot Shào Yang meridian**, as these two meridians converge here.
(*New annotation*: According to *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng*, the Foot Shào Yang meridian is recorded as "below the horns," suggesting this may be an error.)

Behind the **wǎn gǔ** (complete bone), one pair each—
namely the **Tiān Yǒu** (Celestial Window) points.
Needling and moxibustion follow the same method as in *Qì Xué*.

In the nape, before the **Foot Tàiyáng meridian**, one pair each—
namely the **Fēng Chí** (Wind Pool) points.
Located in the depression behind the ear, pressing which draws sensation into the ear.
A convergence of **Hand and Foot Shào Yang meridians**.
Needling may penetrate **four *fēn* of the *cùn***; moxibustion may apply **three *zhàng*** (*New annotation*: According to *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng*, located at the posterior hairline near the *Xiǎn Yù*, a convergence of Foot Shào Yang and *Yáng Wéi*; needling may penetrate **three *fēn* of the *cùn***).

Beside the **fú tū** (supporting prominence), one pair each—
namely the **Tiān Chuāng** (Celestial Window) points.

Left and right, twelve points in total.
Needling and moxibustion follow the same method as in *Qì Xué*.

The **Du Meridian’s qi** emerges at twenty-eight points—
(*New annotation*: One point is missing. According to *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng*, **Huì Yáng** (Converging Yang) consists of two points, totaling twenty-nine. The correct term should be "remaining" rather than "missing.")

Central to the nape, two points—
namely the **Fēng Fǔ** (Wind Palace) and **Jié Mén** (Emaciation Gate) points.
All located in the nape; one additional point is now lost.
**Fēng Fǔ** is one *cùn* into the hairline at the nape’s apex, within the depression of the great tendon.

Taken by tilting the head back.
Needling may penetrate **four *fēn* of the *cùn***; moxibustion is **strictly forbidden**, as it may cause emaciation.
(*New annotation*: According to Master Wáng, "Fēng Fǔ and Jié Mén are all within the nape," and the "one lost point" does not refer to these twenty-eight points but to the two points beside **Dà Zhuī** in *Qì Xué Lùn*, which are also nape points now lost.)

Behind the hairline’s center, eight points—
namely the **Shén Tíng** (Divine Hall), **Shàng Xīng** (Upper Star), **Zì Huì** (Self-Convergence), **Qián Dǐng** (Front Vertex), **Bǎi Huì** (Hundred Convergences), **Hòu Dǐng** (Rear Vertex), **Qiáng Jiān** (Strong Interval), and **Nǎo Hù** (Brain Door) points.

Moxibustion may apply **five *zhàng***.
(*New annotation*: According to *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng*, **Nǎo Hù** should not be moxibustioned; *Gǔ Kòng Lùn* states it should not be **recklessly** moxibustioned.)

In the face’s center, three points—
namely the **Sù Lú** (Plain Bone), **Shuǐ Gōu** (Water Gully), and **Gēn Jiāo** (Gum Intersection) points.

**Sù Lú** is located at the upper end of the nasal column, where the **Du Meridian’s qi** emerges; it may be needled to **three *fēn* of the *cùn***.

**Shuǐ Gōu** is located at the lower end of the nasal column, directly beneath the philtrum, where the **Du Meridian and Hand Yáng Míng** converge; it may be needled to **three *fēn* of the *cùn***, with retention for six breaths. If moxibustion is applied, **three *zhàng*** may be used.

**Gēn Jiāo** is located at the gum crevice above the teeth within the upper lip, where the **Du Meridian and Rèn Meridian** converge; it may be **reverse-needled** to **three *fēn* of the *cùn***. If moxibustion is applied, **three *zhàng*** may be used.

These three points lie directly at the center of the face’s left and right sides.

From **Dà Zhuī** downward to **Shī Wěi** (Sacral Tail) and the adjacent **15 points**—
the **paravertebral points** along the **spine** include **Dà Zhuī** (Great Hammer), **Táo Dào** (Pottery Path), **Shēn Zhù** (Body Pillar), **Shén Dào** (Spirit Path), **Líng Tái** (Spiritual Terrace), **Zhì Yáng** (Extreme Yang), **Jīn Suō** (Tendon Contraction), **Zhōng Shū** (Central Pivot), **Jǐ Zhōng** (Spinal Central), **Xuán Shuō** (Suspended Pivot), **Mìng Mén** (Life Gate), **Yáng Guān** (Yang Pass), **Yāo Shù** (Lumbar Pivot), **Cháng Qiáng** (Long Strong), and **Huì Yáng** (Converging Yang), totaling **15 points**.

**Yāo Shù** is located at the depression beneath the **21st vertebra’s junction**. It may be needled to **two *fēn* of the *cùn***. (*New annotation*: According to *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng*, it is **two *cùn***; *Shuǐ Xué Lùn* states **two *fēn***, while *Miào Cì Lùn*, *Rè Xué Lùn*, and *Cì Rè* all annotate **two *cùn***. Though *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng* records **two *cùn***, it is likely too deep, so it is preferable to follow the shallower **two *fēn*** convention.)

**Cháng Qiáng** is located at the **end of the spinal column**, where the **Du Meridian’s branch** and **Shǎo Yīn** (Lesser Yin) meridians converge. It may be needled to **three *fēn* of the *cùn***, with retention for seven breaths.

**Huì Yáng** may be needled to **eight *fēn* of the *cùn***.

The remaining points may be needled to **five *fēn* of the *cùn***.

(*New annotation*: According to *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng*, **Líng Tái**, **Zhōng Shū**, and **Yáng Guān** (likely **Yáng Guān** as **Yáng Guān** instead of **Yáng Guān**) are **not recorded**.)

From **Zhì Yáng** downward, there are **21 junctions** in total, following the **spinal vertebrae** method. Including the **three cervical junctions**, this makes **24 junctions**.

The **Rèn Meridian’s qi** emerges at **28 points**—
but one point is omitted here.

**Throat’s center (two points)**—
namely **Lián Quán** (Rimmed Spring) and **Tiān Tū** (Celestial Protrusion).

**Lián Quán** is located at the depression beneath the jaw’s junction with the throat, directly below the root of the tongue, where the **Yīn Wéi** (Yin Link) and **Rèn Meridian** converge. It may be needled to **three *fēn* of the *cùn***, with retention for three breaths. If moxibustion is applied, **three *zhàng*** may be used.

**Tiān Tū** is located at the **fourth *cùn*** below the throat’s junction on the **midline of the neck**, where the **Yīn Wéi** and **Rèn Meridian** converge. The needle is inserted downward; it may be needled to **one *cùn***, with retention for seven breaths. If moxibustion is applied, **three *zhàng*** may be used.

**Sternal center (one point)** and **depression in the sternum (one point)**—
namely **Huán Jié** (Ringed Eyelet), **Huá Gài** (Flowering Pavilion), **Zǐ Guān** (Purple Official), **Yù Táng** (Jade Hall), **Dān Zhōng** (Chest Central), and **Zhōng Tíng** (Central Courtyard).

**Huán Jié** is located **one *cùn*** below **Tiān Tū**, where the **Rèn Meridian’s qi** emerges. **Huá Gài** is located **one *cùn*** below **Huán Jié**, where the **Rèn Meridian’s qi** emerges. **Zǐ Guān**, **Yù Táng**, **Dān Zhōng**, and **Zhōng Tíng** are each spaced **one *cùn* and six *fēn*** apart in the depression of the sternum, where the **Rèn Meridian’s qi** emerges. They are taken while reclining backward; each may be needled to **three *fēn* of the *cùn***. If moxibustion is applied, **five *zhàng*** may be used.

**From Jiū Wěi (Crow’s Tail) downward three *cùn* to Wèi Yuàn (Stomach Courtyard) five *cùn*, and from Wèi Yuàn downward to Hèng Gǔ (Horizontal Bone) six *cùn* and eight *fēn***—
(*New annotation*: The **one *cùn*** measure here is likely an error.)

This follows the **abdominal meridian** method.

**Jiū Wěi** is the **front-of-heart point**; its proper location is at the **end of the xiphoid process**, where the bone hangs downward like a crow’s tail, hence its name.

**Jiū Wěi** is located at the **anterior axillary fold**, **five *fēn* below the xiphoid process**, where the **Rèn Meridian branches**; **moxibustion is forbidden**. For those lacking an xiphoid process, the needle is inserted **one *cùn*** below the **sternocostal junction**, to locate **Jiū Wěi**. (*New annotation*: According to *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng*, this should be **one *cùn* and eight *fēn***.)

Below **Jiū Wěi**, **Jù Quē** (Great Gap), **Shàng Yuàn** (Upper Courtyard), **Zhōng Yuàn** (Middle Courtyard), **Jiàn Lǐ** (Constructed Interior), **Xià Yuàn** (Lower Courtyard), **Shuǐ Fèn** (Water Division), and **Qí Zhōng** (Equal Center) are each spaced **one *cùn*** apart. **Shàng Yuàn** is where the **Foot Yáng Míng and Hand Tàiyáng** converge; **Zhōng Yuàn** is where the **Hand Tàiyáng, Shǎo Yáng, and Foot Yáng Míng** meridians meet.

**Qí Zhōng** is **strictly forbidden to needle**; if needled, it causes **Qí Zhōng** (Equal Center) **evil ulcers**, with **leaking pus**—those afflicted will **not recover**.

**Yīn Jiāo** is located **one *cùn*** below **Qí Zhōng**, where the **Ren Meridian** and **Yīn Chōng** converge.

**Dān Yú** is **one *cùn* and eight *fēn*** below **Qí Zhōng**. **Dān Tián** (Elixir Field), the **San Jiāo** (Triple Burner) *mu* point, lies **two *cùn*** below **Qí Zhōng**. **Guān Yuán** (Pass Gate), the **Small Intestine** *mu* point, is **three *cùn*** below **Qí Zhōng**, where the **Foot Three Yīn** and **Ren Meridian** converge.

**Zhōng Jí** is **one *cùn*** below **Guān Yuán**, where the **Foot Three Yīn** meet. **Qū Gǔ** (Crooked Bone) is above the **horizontal bone**, **one *cùn*** below **Zhōng Jí**, where the **Foot Jué Yīn** converges.

All fourteen of these points are where the **Ren Meridian’s qi** manifests.

**Jiàn Lǐ** and **Dān Tián** may be needled to a depth of **six *fēn***, with retention for seven breaths. (*New annotation*: According to *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng*, this should be **five *fēn* with ten breaths**.)

**Shàng Yuàn** and **Yīn Jiāo** may be needled to **eight *fēn***; **Xià Yuàn** and **Shuǐ Fèn** to **one *cùn***; **Zhōng Yuàn** and **Dān Yú** to **one *cùn* and two *fēn***; **Qū Gǔ** to **one *cùn* and five *fēn***, with retention for seven breaths. The remaining points may be needled to **one *cùn* and two *fēn***.

For **moxibustion**, **Guān Yuán** and **Zhōng Yuàn** may each receive **seven cones**; **Qí Zhōng**, **Zhōng Jí**, and **Qū Gǔ** may each receive **three cones**; the rest may receive **five cones**.

From **Jiū Wěi** downward to **Yīn Guān**, all are governed by the **Ren Meridian**—this is the **abdominal meridian law**. (*New annotation*: According to this note, the standard needle depth for the rest is **one *cùn* and two *fēn***, but **Guān Yuán**’s position here differs from *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng*, *Qì Xué*, and *Gǔ Kōng*—follow *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng*’s measurements.)

**Xià Yīn Bié Yī** refers to the **Huì Yīn** point. Below **Qū Gǔ** to **Yīn**, the point between the two **Yīn** is this one—where the **Chōng Meridian**, a branch of the **Ren Meridian**, intersects the **Gōng Sù Meridian**. Thus, it is called **Xià Yīn Bié Yī**. It may be needled to **two *cùn***, with retention for seven breaths, or moxibusted with **three cones**. (*New annotation*: According to *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng*, retention should be **three breaths**.)

**Mù Xià Gè Yī** refers to the **Chéng Qì** points. Located **seven *fēn*** below the eyes, directly above the pupils, they are where the **Ren Meridian**, **Foot Yáng Míng**, and **three Yang meridians** converge. They may be needled to **three *fēn***, but **moxibustion is forbidden**.

**Xià Chún Yī** refers to the **Chéng Jiāng** point. Below the lower lip, it is where the **Foot Yáng Míng** and **Ren Meridian** meet. Open the mouth to locate it; it may be needled to **two *fēn***, with retention for five breaths, or moxibusted with **three cones**. (*New annotation*: According to *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng*, retention should be **six breaths**.)

**Yín Jiāo Yī**—**Yín Jiāo** is the name of this point. Its needling and moxibustion depths follow the same rules as the meridians.

The **Chōng Meridian’s qi** manifests in twenty-two points:

To the left and right of **Jiū Wěi**, each **half *cùn*** outward to **one *cùn*** below **Qí Zhōng**, are the points **Yōu Mén** (Dark Gate), **Tōng Gǔ** (Passing Valley), **Yīn Dū** (Dark Metropolis), **Shí Guān** (Stone Pass), **Shāng Qū** (Market Bend), and **Huāng Shù** (Abdominal Vertebra)—twelve points in total. **Yōu Mén** is located **half *cùn*** beside **Jù Quē**, in the depression; the five points below are each **one *cùn*** apart. All are where the **Chōng Meridian** and **Foot Shǎo Yīn** converge. Each may be needled to **one *cùn***, or moxibusted with **five cones**. (*New annotation*: According to this text, each is needled to **one *cùn***, but *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng* states **Yōu Mén** and **Tōng Gǔ** should be needled to **five *fēn***.)

Below **Qí Zhōng**, each **five *fēn*** outward to **one *cùn*** beside the **horizontal bone**, following the **abdominal meridian law**, are the points **Zhōng Zhù** (Central Reservoir), **Suǐ Fǔ** (Bone Storehouse), **Bāo Mén** (Womb Gate), **Yīn Guān** (Dark Pass), and **Xià Jí** (Lower Extremity)—ten points in total. **Zhōng Zhù** is **five *fēn*** below **Huāng Shù**, directly above **Yōu Mén**; the four points below are each **one *cùn*** apart. All are where the **Chōng Meridian** and **Foot Shǎo Yīn** converge. Each may be needled to **one *cùn***, or moxibusted with **five cones**.

The **Foot Shǎo Yīn** has two points beneath the tongue, and the **Jué Yīn** has two **Jí Mài** (Urgent Vessels). The two **Foot Shǎo Yīn** points beneath the tongue are located in the depression before the **Rén Yīng** pulse, known as the **Rì Yuè Běn** (Sun-Moon Roots)—two points in total. They may be needled to **four *fēn***, as they are where the **Foot Shǎo Yīn**’s qi manifests.

The **Jí Mài** are in the **Yīn Máo** (Dark Hair), with the two points **two *cùn* and five *fēn*** apart. When pressed, they feel firm beneath the finger, but excessive pressure causes pain radiating upward and downward. If the left one is affected by cold, it draws pain upward to the lower abdomen and downward to the **Yīn Jiǎo**, often causing **shàofù jīzhōng** (lower abdominal urgency from cold). These two vessels are the **Jué Yīn’s** major collaterals, passing through the **testicles’ roots**, hence called **Jué Yīn Jí Mài**. They may be **moxibusted but not needled**; if there is **testicular pain or lower abdominal distress**, moxibustion is indicated. (*New annotation*: The points beneath the tongue’s hair are not recorded in *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng*.)

The **Hand Shǎo Yīn** has two points: the **Yóu** (Post) points. Located **half *cùn*** behind the wrist, they are the **Hand Shǎo Yīn’s** *yuan* points. They may be needled to **three *fēn***, or moxibusted with **three cones**—two points in total.

**Yīn Tà** and **Yáng Tà** each have one point:
**Yīn Tà** refers to the **Jiāo Xìn** point. **Jiāo Xìn** is **two *cùn*** above the **inner ankle**, between the **Shǎo Yīn** (anterior) and **Tài Yīn** (posterior) tendons and bones. As the **Yīn Tà’s** *yuan* point, it may be needled to **four *fēn***, with retention for five breaths, or moxibusted with **three cones**.

**Yáng Tà** refers to the **Fù Yáng** point. **Fù Yáng** is **three *cùn*** above the **outer ankle**, between the **Tài Yáng** (anterior) and **Shǎo Yáng** (posterior) tendons and bones. It is taken while fasting. As the **Yáng Tà’s** *yuan* point, it may be needled to **six *fēn***, with retention for seven breaths, or moxibusted with **three cones**—four points in total.

The **hand and foot** *jī* (interdigital) pulses—where **qi** originates—comprise **three hundred sixty-five** points in total.

Of these, the **channels’** preserved points are numerous, totaling **nineteen**—these are called the **Qi Fǔ** (Qi Palaces).

Yet, the **scattered** *yù* (acupuncture) points and **all channel divisions** possess them, so the **classics** may not always mention them. The *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng* (Classics of the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches) records varying lengths of channel flow and distribution due to this.

**Chapter on the Theory of Bone Cavities**

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"I have heard that wind is the origin of a hundred ailments. How should one treat it with acupuncture?"*
(*"Begin" here means "initial."*)

Qìbó replied:
*"When wind enters from without, it causes the body to tremble with cold, induces sweating, headache, heaviness of the body, and aversion to cold.
When wind invades the body’s form, it obstructs the proper flow of *qi*, sealing the pores tightly. The *yang* *qi* resists internally, while external cold prevails, their opposing forces clashing. As a result, the *honorific* and *defensive* *qi* lose their proper courses—thus the symptoms arise.

Treatment should target **Wind Palace** (*Fēngfǔ*), a channel point.
**Wind Palace** is located at the nape, one *cùn* (finger-breadth) above the hairline, in the midline.
(*It lies along the **Governing Vessel**, the confluence of the **Foot Taiyang** channel.*)
When needling, penetrate to four *fēn* (tenths of a *cùn*).
If moxibustion is applied, five *zhàng* (cones) may be used.*

**Newly corrected annotation states:**
*"According to the *Fēngfǔ* annotation, the *Treatise on Qi Cavities* and *Treatise on Qi Palaces* already contain this note, matching the *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng*. Here, it mistakenly states that it is the confluence of the **Governing Vessel** and **Foot Taiyang**, allowing five *zhàng* of moxa—this is actually the **Wind Gate** (*Fēngmén*) and **Heat Palace** (*Rèfǔ*) point.
It should read: *‘Confluence of the **Governing Vessel** and **Yang Link** (*Yángwéi*), retain the needle for three breaths—moxibustion is prohibited.’*
Thus corrected.

Regulate the *yin* and *yang*: if deficient, supplement; if excessive, reduce."*

The **Dao** of needle use follows the laws of Heaven’s constancy—reduce excess, supplement deficiency, for this is its norm.

For **Great Wind** with neck and nape pain, needle **Wind Gate** (*Fēngmén*).
**Wind Gate** is located above the **Great Vertebra** (*Dàzhuī*).
The **Great Vertebra** refers to the point above the **Great Vertebra** (*Dàzhuī*), one *cùn* (same-body inch) into the hairline.

For **Great Wind** with profuse sweating, moxa **Requesting Moxa** (*Qǐngxī*).
**Requesting Moxa** is a point on the **Wind Gate** (*Fēngmén*)—located three *cùn* beside the **Lateral Spine** (*Xiépǐ*), beneath the back.
Press it until the patient calls out, and the point will respond beneath your fingers.
It is the **Foot Taiyang** channel’s *qi* emerging here.
Needling may penetrate six *fēn* of the same-body inch; retain for seven breaths.
If moxibustion is applied, five *zhàng* may be used.
**Requesting Moxa** is named thus because of its response.

(*Bó* rhymes with *博*.)

For **Wind** that lingers like a monk, needle the **Brow Pinnacle** (*Méitóu*).
This refers to the **Drilling Bamboo** (*Zuànzhú*) point.
Located in the hollow of the brow where the pulse moves beneath your fingers,
it is the **Foot Taiyang** channel’s *qi* emerging here.
Needling may penetrate three *fēn* of the same-body inch;
if moxibustion is applied, three *zhàng* may be used.

**Lost Cushion** (*Shīzhěn*) is between the shoulder bones.
This refers to the **Missing Basin** (*Quēpén*) point.
Located in the hollow between the shoulder’s transverse bone,
it is the **Hand Yangming** channel’s *qi* emerging here.
Needling may penetrate two *fēn* of the same-body inch; retain for seven breaths.
If moxibustion is applied, three *zhàng* may be used—
needling too deep will cause the patient to gasp.

(*New annotation states: According to the *Qi Palaces* (*Qǐfǔ*) text, it should read **Foot Yangming**—
the *Difficult Classic* (*Nánjīng*) and *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng* both record this as the **Foot Yangming** channel’s *qi* emerging here,
thus Wang’s annotation mentions both.)

For **Lost Cushion**, when the arm is flexed and bent at the elbow,
moxa **Spine Center** (*Jǐzhōng*).
(*Shāo* reads as *yáo*—*yáo* means to shake or move.)
Yet **Lost Cushion** is not only taken from the hollow between the shoulder’s transverse bone;
when correcting posture, moxa **Spine Center** as well.

To confirm its location, have the patient shake their arm and bend their elbow.
From the nape downward, align horizontally with the elbow’s tip—
the midpoint here is **Sun Gate** (*Yángguān*).
Located five *fēn* below the **16th vertebra** (*shíliù zhuījié*),
it is the **Governing Vessel**’s *qi* emerging here.
Needling may penetrate five *fēn* of the same-body inch;
if moxibustion is applied, three *zhàng* may be used.

(*New annotation states: **Sun Gate** (*Yángguān*) is not recorded in the *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng*.*)

For **sand-like networks** (*shālùo*) drawing from the **flanks** (*jìxiá*) to the **lower abdomen** (*shàofù*), causing distended pain,
needle **Requesting Moxa** (*Qǐngxī*).
(*Chǎo* refers to the hollow, soft areas beside the **Lateral Spine** (*Xiépǐ*).)
**Lower abdomen** means aligned with the navel.
When back pain prevents turning or shaking, urgently draw the **yin scrotum** (*yīnluǎn*), and needle **Eight Lumbar** (*Bāgé*) with the pain’s apex.
**Eight Lumbar** is located between the **lumbar vertebrae** (*yāoshǔ*).
(*Eight* may also mean *nine*—according to *True Bones* (*Zhēngǔ*) and *Central Canon of Acupuncture* (*Zhōnghuà Kǒngxué Jīng*), there is **Eight Lumbar** but no *Nine Lumbar*.)
**Divide** refers to the hollow between the lumbar vertebrae’s tendons and flesh.
For **rat-like atrophy** (*shǔshòu*) with cold and heat,
needle **Cold Palace** (*Hánfǔ*).
**Cold Palace** is located outside the **knee** (*xī*), at the **bone junction** (*jiě*).
(*Knee* refers to the outer bone.)
The **flexing and extending** point,
where cold *qi* thrives—
thus it is named **Cold Palace**.
(*Jiě* means bone junction; *yíng* means deep needling must strike the **network vessels** (*luò*).)

To take the point outside the knee, have the patient kneel.
To take the point on the sole, have the patient kneel with the foot’s hollow pressed firmly inward.

The **Conception Vessel** (*Rènmài*) arises below **Middle Extremity** (*Zhōngjí*), ascending along the **pubic hairline** (*máojié*).
It follows the **lower abdomen** (*fùguǒ*), passing through **Navel Center** (*Guānyuán*), reaching the throat, and ascending to the **chin** (*yè*), tracing the face to enter the eyes.

(*New annotation states: According to the *Difficult Classic* (*Nánjīng*) and *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng*, the phrase "ascending to the chin, tracing the face to enter the eyes" is absent.*)

The **Penetrating Vessel** (*Chōngmài*) arises from **Qi Street** (*Qìjiē*).
(*New annotation states: According to the *Difficult Classic* (*Nánjīng*) and *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng*, it should read **Foot Yangming**.*)
It ascends beside **Lesser Yin** (*Shàoyīn*), dispersing in the chest.
The **Conception Vessel** and **Penetrating Vessel** are **extraordinary channels** (*qíjīng*).
The **Conception Vessel** ascends centrally along the midline,
while the **Penetrating Vessel** ascends beside it on both flanks.

Yet **Middle Extremity** (*Zhōngjí*) refers to the point four *cùn* below the navel.
Speaking of below **Middle Extremity** means the **Conception Vessel** ascends internally from the lower abdomen,
then externally emerges at the **pubic hairline** (*máojié*) and rises—
not that it originates here.

**Navel Center** (*Guānyuán*) refers to the point three *cùn* below the navel.
**Qi Street** (*Qìjiē*) is the name of a point—
located one *cùn* above the **pubic hairline** (*máojié*) on both flanks.

Speaking of the **Penetrating Vessel** arising from **Qi Street** means it also ascends internally from the lower abdomen,
parallel to the **Conception Vessel**, then follows the **abdominal midline** (*fùguǒ*).

How so? The *Needle Classic* (*Zhēnjīng*) states:
The **Penetrating Vessel** is the **sea of the Twelve Channels** (*shíèrjīng hǎi*), arising with the **Lesser Yin** channel’s networks below the **kidneys** (*shèn*).
It emerges at **Qi Street** (*Qìjiē*).

It further states:
The **Penetrating Vessel** and **Conception Vessel** both originate from the **uterus** (*bāozhōng*).
They ascend along the **spine** (*bèiguǒ*), serving as the **sea of the channels and networks**.
Their external branches follow the **abdominal midline** (*fùguǒ*), converging at the throat,
then diverge to network the **lips and mouth** (*chúnkuǎn*).

When **blood** and *qi* are abundant, the skin grows hot.
When **blood** alone is abundant, it permeates the skin,
generating **hair** (*máo*).

From this, it is clear that the **Conception Vessel** ascends internally from the lower abdomen,
reaching below **Middle Extremity** (*Zhōngjí*), within **Qi Street** (*Qìjiē*).

(*New annotation states: **Qi Street** (*Qìjiē*) is emphasized in the *Qi Palaces* (*Qǐfǔ*), *Needling Heat* (*Cǎo Rè*), *Water-Heat Points* (*Shuǐ Rè*), and *Needling Prohibitions* (*Cǐ Jìn*) texts,
though the phrasing differs, the location remains the same.
It is fully annotated in the *Qi Palaces* text.*)

When the **Conception Vessel** is diseased,
men develop **seven internal hernias** (*qīliè*), and women suffer **prolapsed uterus** (*dàiyā húnjù*).
When the **Penetrating Vessel** is diseased,
**rebellious breath** (*nìqì*) and **abdominal urgency** (*jiéjí*) occur.

When the **Governing Vessel** is diseased,
the **spine stiffens and bends backward** (*jǐngqiáng fǎnzhé*).
The **Governing Vessel** is also an **extraordinary channel** (*qíjīng*).

Yet the **Conception Vessel**, **Penetrating Vessel**, and **Governing Vessel** share a single source with three branches,
thus some texts call the **Penetrating Vessel** the **Governing Vessel** as well.

How is this made clear? Now, both the *Jia-Yi* (甲乙) and the ancient *Classic of the Flowing Meridians* (《经脉流注图经》) state that the **Conception Vessel** (任脉) ascending along the back is called the **Governing Vessel** (督脉), while the **Conception Vessel** ascending straight from the lower abdomen is also called the **Conception Vessel**—this is simply a naming distinction based on the **yin-yang** (阴阳) differentiation of the **back and abdomen** (背腹).

The **Conception Vessel** (任脉) ascends from the **uterus** (胞), passing through the **girdle vessel** (带脉), converging at the **navel** (齐), and then ascending further. Thus, when men develop this disease, they suffer **seven internal hernias** (内结七疝), and when women develop it, they experience **prolapsed uterus** (带下痕聚). The **Penetrating Vessel** (冲脉) ascends alongside the **navel** (齐) and merges with the **Lesser Yin** (少阴) meridian, reaching the chest center. Therefore, when the **Penetrating Vessel** is diseased, **rebellious breath** (逆气) and **abdominal urgency** (裹急) occur.

The **Governing Vessel** (督脉) ascends along the **spine** (脊), encased by the **kidney meridian** (督脉). Thus, when the **Governing Vessel** is diseased, the **spine stiffens and bends backward** (脊强反折). The **Governing Vessel** originates below the **lower abdomen** (少腹) at the **central bone** (骨中央), entering the **systematic orifice** (系廷孔) in women. This "origin" is not its initial emergence, but rather, just as the **Conception Vessel** and **Penetrating Vessel** (任脉冲脉) emerge from the **uterus** (胞中), the **Governing Vessel** actually begins below the **kidneys** (肾下), descending to the **lower abdomen** (少腹) at the **central bone** (骨围之中央).

The **systematic orifice** (系廷孔) refers to the **Yao Luo** (窈漏), also known as the **Front Yin Orifice** (前阴穴). It is named so because its **yin systematic orifice** (阴廷) is connected to the center. The **orifice** (孔) is the upper end of the **urinary orifice** (溺孔), and the **Yao Luo** (窈漏) itself lies within the **Front Yin Orifice**. The **urinary orifice** (溺孔) is the **systematic orifice** (廷孔) located above the **Yao Luo**, and the **Governing Vessel** reaches this point from the **central bone** (骨围中央). Its **collateral** (络) follows the **yin instrument** (阴器), converging at the **two orifices** (问), encircling the **anus** (篡) from behind. The **collaterals** (别络) of the **Governing Vessel** split from the **urinary orifice** (溺孔) and each branch descends along the **yin instrument**, converging at the **two orifices** (问). After passing the **two orifices**, they split again and encircle the **anus** from behind.

The **collateral** (络) of the **Lesser Yin** (足少阴) meridian ascends from the **inner posterior aspect of the thigh** (上股内后廉), piercing the **spine** (贯脊) and connecting to the **kidney** (属肾). The **collateral** (络) of the **Greater Yang** (巨阳, 足太阳) meridian descends externally along the **spleen pivot** (脾枢), connecting to the **outer aspect of the thigh** (络股阳) and downward; its internal branch descends through the **buttocks** (贯臀), reaching the **perineum** (胭中) and merging with the external branch. Hence, it is said that the **collaterals** of the **Lesser Yin** and **Greater Yang** merge, ascending from the **inner posterior aspect of the thigh** (上股内后廉), piercing the **spine** (贯脊) and connecting to the **kidney** (属肾). (*New Annotation*: Upon careful examination, the term "行於焦" likely contains an error; the character "焦" should be reconsidered.)

The **collateral** (络) of the **Greater Yang** (足太阳) meridian originates from the **inner canthus** (目内毗), ascending along the forehead to meet at the **vertex** (巅上), entering the **brain** (络脑), then descending separately from the **nape of the neck** (下项), following the **inner aspect of the shoulder and scapula** (侠脊抵腰中), and descending to connect with the **kidney** (属肾). It then ascends, encircling the **buttocks** (臀). The **Conception Vessel** in men follows the **penis** (茎) down to the **anus** (篡), equal to that in women. The **Conception Vessel** ascending straight from the **lower abdomen** (少腹) pierces the **navel** (齐中央), ascending through the **heart** (心), entering the **throat** (喉), ascending to the **chin** (颐), encircling the **lips** (环唇), and striking below the **two eyes** (两目之下中央). From its origin at the **inner canthus** (目内毗) descending to the **anus** (篡) in women, it is also the **collateral** (别络) of the **Governing Vessel**.

The **Conception Vessel**’s **straight course** (直行) ascends from the **umbilicus** (尸上) along the **spine** (脊), reaching the **nose** (鼻). The **Conception Vessel**’s ascent from the **lower abdomen** (少腹) to below the **two eyes** (两目之下中央) is also part of the **Governing Vessel**’s course. Thus, the **Conception Vessel** and **Governing Vessel** are named differently but share the same fundamental **channel** (脉).

When this disease arises, it causes **pain ascending from the lower abdomen to the heart** (从少腹上冲心而痛), preventing forward and backward movement, resulting in **Penetrating Vessel hernia** (冲疝). Upon further examination, this disease actually stems from the **Conception Vessel** (任脉), as the *Classic* describes it as **Penetrating Vessel hernia** (冲疝), clearly distinguishing the **Governing Vessel** (督脉) as the separate governing meridian. How so? If there were only a single **vessel** (脉) and **qi** (气) without differentiation in **yin-yang** governing functions, then this disease would cause **pain in both the heart and back** (心背俱痛), why would it exclusively manifest as **hernia with heart-centered pain** (冲心而为疝)?

When women suffer from this disease, they experience **infertility** (不孕), **hemorrhoids** (瘾痔), **urinary incontinence** (遗溺), **dryness** (哑), and **vaginal dryness** (乾). This is due to the **Penetrating Vessel** and **Conception Vessel** ascending together from the **lower abdomen** (少腹) to the **throat** (咽喉), and the **Governing Vessel** following the **yin instrument** (阴器), converging at the **two orifices** (问), encircling the **anus** (篡) from behind, and then splitting to encircle the **buttocks** (臀). Hence, **infertility, hemorrhoids, urinary incontinence, dryness, and vaginal dryness** (不孕疮痔遗溺哑乾) occur.

The **Conception Vessel** is named as such because women receive it as a means of **nurturing life** (任养), hence the *Classic* states that this disease leads to **infertility** (不孕) in women. The **Penetrating Vessel** is named so because its **qi** ascends forcefully (上冲), causing the *Classic* to describe this disease as **pain ascending from the lower abdomen to the heart** (从少腹上冲心而痛). The **Governing Vessel** is named because it **supervises and leads** the **sea of meridians** (经脉之海).

Thus, these three vessels—**Conception, Penetrating, and Governing**—share a single source with three branches, sometimes being called collectively, which may seem confusing. Therefore, the following text states:

*The **Governing Vessel** disease is treated by needling the **Governing Vessel**, targeting the **bone above** (骨上). In severe cases, needle **below the navel** (齐下营). This is also the division of the **Conception Vessel** (任脉). The **Conception, Penetrating, and Governing Vessels** share the same name but differ in function, as clarified above.*

The **bone above** (骨上) refers to the **Lumbar Vertebrae** (腰横骨), specifically the **Hairline Interval** (髦际) and the **Curved Bone Orifice** (曲骨穴). The **Conception Vessel** is the **meeting point of the Lesser Yin** (足厥阴之会), and needling can penetrate to a depth of **1 cun** (同身寸之一寸半). If using **moxibustion** (灸), apply **three sessions** (三壮).

The **navel below** (齐下) refers to the **Yin Exchange Orifice** (阴交穴), located **1 cun** below the **navel** (齐直下同身寸之一寸). The **Conception Vessel** is the **meeting point of the Yin Penetrating** (阴冲之会), and needling can penetrate to a depth of **8 fen** (同身寸之八分). If using **moxibustion**, apply **five sessions** (五壮).

When the **ascending qi** (上气) produces a sound, treat the **central throat** (喉中央), specifically the **Heavenly Protrusion Orifice** (天突穴), located in the **midline of the supraclavicular fossa** (缺盆两问之中), **4 cun** below the **sternocleidomastoid junction** (颈结喉下同身寸之四寸中央), at the **Yin Maintenance** (阴维), the **meeting point of the Conception Vessel** (任脉之会). Needle with a **low-angle insertion** (低针), penetrating **1 cun** (同身寸之一寸), and retain the needle for **seven breaths** (七呼). If using **moxibustion**, apply **three sessions** (三壮).

For diseases where **qi ascends to the throat** (上冲喉), treat the **Gradual Orifice** (渐), which is located above the **chin** (侠颐). The **Yang Ming** (阳明) meridian ascends along the **chin** (渐上颐) and encircles the **lips** (环唇), hence the name **Gradual Orifice** (渐). This is known as the **Great Welcome** (大迎). The **Great Welcome** is situated in the **depression anterior to the condyloid process of the mandible** (曲颌前骨), **1 cun and 3 fen** below the **supraclavicular fossa** (同身寸之一寸三分陷), where the **qi of the Yang Ming meridian** (足阳明脉气) manifests. Needling can penetrate **3 fen** (同身寸之三分), and retain the needle for **seven breaths** (七呼). If using **moxibustion**, apply **three sessions** (三壮).

For **stiffness of the knee** that prevents bending or extending, treat the **Lan (楗)**.
**Lan** refers to the point above the **zangfu (脏辅) bone**, below the **horizontal bone (横骨)**, and in the center of the **outer thigh (股外)**. Locate it by standing beside the patient and palpating until the tendon moves under the hand.

For **knee pain while seated**, treat the **Ji (机)**, located where the **hip bones (髋骨)** meet on either side.

For **knee pain while standing, with heat in the knee joint (暑解)**, treat the **Hui Guan (骸关)**.
**Hui Guan** refers to the **knee joint (膝解)**. As one text states: *"When rising, the pain draws toward the knee joint."* Though the terms **暑 (heat)** and **引 (draw)** differ in meaning, **起 (rise)** and **立 (stand)** share a similar intent. If **knee pain extends to the big toe**, treat the **Wei (腘)**.
**Wei** is the **Weizhong (委中)** point, located behind the knee in the **hollow where the leg bends**, accessed from the back. The pulse moves under the hand—this is where the **Foot Taiyang (足太阳) meridian** enters. Needling may penetrate **five fen (同身寸之五分)**, retain for **seven breaths (七呼)**. If using **moxibustion**, apply **three sessions (三壮)**.

If **knee pain while seated feels as if something is hidden**, treat the **Guan (关)**, located above the **bink (胭)**, behind the **Dai (挞)**, accessed by standing behind the patient and pressing until the tendon moves under the hand.

For **knee pain preventing flexion or extension**, treat the **back’s inner region (背内)**, referring to the **Dazhu (大杼)** point.
Needling and moxibustion follow the same **division of sessions** as in *The Gas and Orifice Treatments (气穴)*.

If the **knee joint feels fractured (连腑若折)**, treat the **Yangming Zhongjiao (阳明中俞胶)**.
For **knee pain preventing movement, as if the joint were fractured**, needle the **Yangming meridian’s Zhongjiao (中俞胶)**, which corresponds to **Sanli (三里)**.
If the pain feels **as if the knee were separating (如别离)**, treat the **honor points (荣)** of **Juyang (巨阳)** and **Shaoyin (少阴)**.
The **Foot Taiyang honor point (足太阳荣)** is **Tonggu (通谷)**, located in the **hollow before the base joint of the little toe**, accessible from the outer side. Needling may penetrate **two fen (同身寸之二分)**, retain for **five breaths (五呼)**. If using **moxibustion**, apply **three sessions (三壮)**.
The **Foot Shaoyin honor point (足少阴荣)** is **Ranggu (然谷)**, located in the **hollow before the medial malleolus**, below the **large bone (大骨)**. Needling may penetrate **three fen (同身寸之三分)**, retain for **three breaths (三呼)**. If using **moxibustion**, apply **three sessions (三壮)**.

For **knee weakness with acidity (淫滦)**, unable to stand long, treat the **Shaoyang Wei (少阳之维)**.
*(Correction: According to the Jia Yi Jing, five cun above the lateral malleolus is the Foot Shaoyang luo (络), not Wei. The text likely contains an error.)*
Located **five cun (or four cun, per some texts)** above the **lateral malleolus (外踝)**. **淫滦** refers to a **weak, aching sensation without strength**.
*(Note: The Zhongyu Image Classic states there is no point four cun above the lateral malleolus; five cun corresponds to the Guangming (光明) point.)*
The **Foot Shaoyang luo (足少阳之络)** may be needled to **seven fen (同身寸之七分)**, retained for **ten breaths (十呼)**. If using **moxibustion**, apply **five sessions (五壮)**.
*(Correction: The Jia Yi Jing states needling should penetrate six fen, retained for seven breaths.)*

**Water Orifice (水俞) – Fifty-Seven Points:**
Arranged in **five rows on the corpse (尸)**, **five rows on the upper body (伏菟)**, **two rows on the sides (左右)**, and **six rows above the ankles (踝上)**. Needling and moxibustion follow the divisions in *The Water-Heat Orifice Treatments (水热穴论)*. These are all **bone cavities**, hence their repetition in *The Gas and Orifice Treatments (气穴篇)*.

**Sui Kong (髓空)** is located **five fen behind the brain (脑后五分)**, below the **sharp bone at the nape (颤际锐骨)**, known as **Fengfu (风府)**, connecting to the **brain (通脑中)**.
One is located **below the gum base (龈基下)**, in the **hollow beneath the jawbone (颐下骨陷)**, containing a point the size of a **soybean (容豆)**, named **Xiaji (下绩)** in the *Zhongyu Image Classic*.
*(Note: **龈 (gēng)** is pronounced as in "silver")*

「One is located at the back of the neck (项), below the **Fùgǔ (复骨)**, known as the **Jímén (瘠门)** orifice. It is situated in the **soft hairline at the nape (项发际宛宛)**, entering the **tendon that connects to the root of the tongue (系舌本)**, where the **Dūmài (督脉)** and **Yángwéi (阳维)** channels converge. To locate it, tilt the head backward; needling may penetrate **four fen (分)** of the *tóngshēncǔn (同身寸)*. **Moxibustion (灸) is strictly prohibited (禁)** here.

One is located **above the spinal bone (脊骨)**, above **Fengfu (风府)**, known as the **Nǎohù (脑户)** orifice. It lies on the **occipital bone (枕骨)**, **one inch and five fen (一寸五分)** behind the **Dàyǔ (大羽)** point, where the **Dūmài (督脉)** and **Zú-Tàiyáng (足太阳)** channels converge. This is the **alternate orifice of the brain (别脑之户)**; moxibustion must not be applied recklessly, as improper use may cause **emaciation (瘠)**. Needling may penetrate **three fen (三分)**, with a retention of **three breaths (三呼)**.

○ *Newly corrected text (新校正)* states: According to *The Jia-Yi Classic (甲乙经)*, **Dàyǔ (大羽)** is an alternate name for **Qiángyī (强一)**. The *Gas and Orifices (气府)* commentary notes: If moxibustion is applied, it may be done with **five units of strength (五壮)**.

The **hollow beneath the spinal bone (脊骨下空)** is located below the **Fùgǔ (复骨)** on the corpse. It is **not indicated for treatment (不应主疗)**, and its name is omitted in the *Classic (经)*. ○ *Newly corrected text* states: According to *The Jia-Yi Classic (甲乙经)*, **Chángqiáng (长强)** lies at the end of the spinal bone, directly below the **Fùgǔ (复骨)** on the corpse. **Wang’s School (王氏)** notes: It is **not indicated for treatment**, and its name is omitted in the *Classic*. Perhaps this was an error (得非误乎)?」

**Marrow Cavities (髓空) and their Treatments:**

The **Marrow Cavities (髓空)** are numbered beneath the nose (面侠鼻), referring to apertures such as **the cranial orifices (颅髅等穴)**. The *Classic (经)* does not mark them with two fingers; their location is slight. Some say the **Marrow Cavity (骨空)** lies below the mouth, between the two shoulders. This refers to the **Great Welcoming Aperture (大迎穴)**. Needling or moxibustion here follows the same **units of strength (壮)** as the previous **premaxillary cavity (侠颐)**.

The **Marrow Cavity of the Arms (两膊骨空)** is found on the **sunny side of the arms (膊中之阳)**, near the **Shoulder Depression Aperture (肩髑穴)**. The *Classic (经)* does not name it.

The **Marrow Cavity of the Forearm (臂骨空)** lies on the **forearm’s sunny side (臂阳)**, four inches from the **ankle (踝)**, between two bones. It is one inch above **Supporting Valley (支沟)**, known as **Passage Cavity (通问)**.

○ *Newly corrected text (新校正)* states: According to *The Jia-Yi Classic (甲乙经)*, one inch above **Supporting Valley (支沟)** is named **Three Sunny Connections (三阳络)**. Could **Passage Cavity (通问)** be its alternate name?

The **Marrow Cavity of the Thigh (股骨上空)** lies on the **thigh’s sunny side (股阳)**, emerging four inches above the **upper knee (上膝)**. It is found above **Hidden Beast (伏菟)** and below **Bearing the Whip (承挞)**.

The **Marrow Cavity of the Hip (腑骨空)** lies on the **upper end of the hip bone (辅骨之上端)**, referring to the **Calf’s Nose Aperture (犊鼻穴)**. It is located beneath the **hip bone (髋)**, beside the **great tendon (大筋)**, where the **Foot Yangming (足阳明)** pulse originates. Needling may reach **six-tenths of the same-body inch (同身寸之六分)**. Moxibustion may apply **three units of strength (三壮)**.

The **Marrow Cavity of the Groin (股际骨空)** lies below the **Groin’s Movement (毛中动)**. The *Classic (经)* omits its name.

The **Corpse Bone Cavity (尸骨空)** lies behind the **Separating Bone (解骨)**, four inches away. This is known as the **Eight Lacerations Above the Corpse Bone (尸骨上八僇穴)**.

The **Flat Bone (扁骨)** has **permeating patterns (渗理赓)**, but no marrow cavity. If the bone lacks a cavity, the marrow also lacks an opening.

The **Shoulder Bone (肩骨)**, also called **Corpse Bone (尸问)** and **Flat Bone (扁戾骨)**, has **permeating channels (渗灌文理归奏)** on its surface but no distinct marrow cavity.

**Easy (易)**, meaning "thus," confirms that if a bone has a cavity, the marrow has an opening, and if the bone lacks a cavity, the marrow also lacks an opening.

**Moxibustion for Cold and Heat (寒热之法):**
First, apply moxibustion to **Great Spine (大椎)**, using **units of strength (壮)** equal to the patient’s age, as with counting breaths. Next, apply moxibustion to **Root Bone (根骨)**, also called **Tail’s End (尾穷)**, using the same method.

Observe the **sunken points on the back (背俞陷)** and apply moxibustion there—these are the **depressions between the scapula and spine (骨际有陷处)**. Lift the arm to locate sunken points above the shoulder; this is the **Shoulder Pair Aperture (肩偶穴)**. Between the two bones at the **shoulder’s end (肩端)**, where the **Hand Yangming (手阳明)** and **Treading Pulse (踏脉)** converge, needling may reach **six-tenths of the same-body inch**, leaving **six breaths (六呼)**. If moxibustion is used, apply **three units of strength (三壮)**.

Apply moxibustion between the **two flanks (两季胁)**, at the **Capital Gate Aperture (京门穴)**, the **kidney’s gathering point (肾募)**. Located where the **iliac bone (骼骨)** meets the **lumbar region (腰中)** and the **flank’s root (季胁本)**, beside the spine, needling may reach **three-tenths of the same-body inch**, leaving **seven breaths (七呼)**. If moxibustion is used, apply **three units of strength (三壮)**.

Apply moxibustion at the **upper end of the absolute bone (绝骨之端)** above the **outer ankle (外踝)**, referring to the **Yang Support Aperture (阳辅穴)**. Found on the **outer ankle (足外踝)** before the **absolute bone (绝骨)**, three-tenths of the same-body inch from the **ankle’s hollow (丘虚)**, where the **Foot Shaoyang (足少阳)** pulse flows, needling may reach **five-tenths of the same-body inch**, leaving **seven breaths (七呼)**. If moxibustion is used, apply **three units of strength (三壮)**.

○ *Newly corrected text (新校正)* states: According to *The Jia-Yi Classic (甲乙经)*, it should be four inches above the outer ankle.

Apply moxibustion between the **second and third toes (小指次指)** of the foot, at the **Beside the Stream Aperture (侠溪穴)**. Found on the **second toe’s forked bone (次指歧骨)** before the **node (本节)** and the sunken point, where the **Foot Shaoyang (足少阳)** pulse flows, needling may reach **three-tenths of the same-body inch**, leaving **three breaths (三呼)**. If moxibustion is used, apply **three units of strength (三壮)**.

○ *Newly corrected text (新校正)* states: According to *The Jia-Yi Classic (甲乙经)*, **flow (流)** should be **retained (留)**.

Apply moxibustion to the **sunken pulse below the heel (踹下陷脉)**, referring to the **Bearing Tendon Aperture (承筋穴)**. Found in the **center of the heel (瑞中央)** where the pulse sinks, it is where the **Foot Taiyang (足太阳)** pulse originates. Needling is **forbidden (禁)**; moxibustion may apply **three units of strength (三壮)**.

○ *Newly corrected text (新校正)* states: According to the *Needling for Lumbar Pain (刺腰痛篇)* commentary, the **heel’s center (踹中央)** is like the **outer sunken point (外陷者中)**.

Apply moxibustion behind the **outer ankle (外踝)**, referring to the **Kunlun Aperture (昆仑穴)**. Found on the **heel bone (跟骨)** behind the outer ankle where the pulse sinks, fine vessels move in response to pressure. This is where the **Foot Taiyang (足太阳)** pulse flows. Needling may reach **five-tenths of the same-body inch**, leaving **ten breaths (十呼)**. If moxibustion is used, apply **three units of strength (三壮)**.

Apply moxibustion to the **firm, tendinous point above the sternum’s cavity (缺盆骨上切之坚动)**. The *Classic (经)* omits its name; moxibustion should be applied according to its location.

Apply moxibustion between the **sunken bones in the chest’s center (膺中陷骨问)**, referring to the **Heavenly Piercing Aperture (天突穴)**. Needling or moxibustion follows the same **units of strength (壮)** as the previous sternal cavity (缺盆中).

Apply moxibustion below the **wrist’s bundle (掌束骨下)**, referring to the **Yang Pool Aperture (阳池穴)**. Found on the **inner wrist (手表腕)** where the pulse sinks, it is where the **Hand Shaoyang (手少阳)** pulse passes. Needling may reach **two-tenths of the same-body inch**, leaving **six breaths (六呼)**. If moxibustion is used, apply **three units of strength (三壮)**.

Apply moxibustion three inches below the **navel (脐)**, at **Guanyuan (关元)**, directly below the navel, three same-body inches, where the **Three Yin of the Foot (足三阴)** and **Task Pulse (任脉)** converge. Needling may reach **two same-body inches (二寸)**, leaving **seven breaths (七呼)**. If moxibustion is used, apply **seven units of strength (七壮)**.

○ *Newly corrected text (新校正)* states: According to the *Gas and Orifices (气府)* commentary, the statement "needling may reach **one inch and two-tenths (一寸二分)**" is incorrect.

Apply moxibustion to the **pulsing artery at the groin’s edge (毛际动脉)**, where the pulse moves in response to pressure—this is the **Gas Street Aperture (气街穴)**.

Apply moxibustion three inches below the **knee (膝下三寸)**, at the **Three Miles Aperture (三里穴)**. Found three same-body inches below the knee, outside the **hip bone (腑骨)** and between the **two tendons (康两筋肉)**, where the **Foot Yangming (足阳明)** pulse enters, needling may reach **one same-body inch (一寸)**, leaving **seven breaths (七呼)**. If moxibustion is used, apply **three units of strength (三壮)**.

Apply moxibustion to the **pulsing artery above the foot’s Yangming (足阳明驸上动脉)**, referring to the **Rushing Yang Aperture (冲阳穴)**. Found five same-body inches above the **foot’s Yangming**, where the artery pulses between the bones, it is where the **Foot Yangming (足阳明)** pulse passes. Needling may reach **three-tenths of the same-body inch**, leaving **ten breaths (十呼)**. If moxibustion is used, apply **three units of strength (三壮)**.

○ *Newly corrected text (新校正)* states: According to *The Jia-Yi Classic (甲乙经)* and **Quan Yuanqi’s (全元起)** original text, below the **Foot Yangming (足阳明)** there should be **moxibustion applied (灸之)**. The two apertures—**Rushing Yang (冲阳)** and **Pulsing Artery Above the Foot’s Yangming (驸上动脉)**—are now distinguished, but the *Classic* omits **moxibustion applied (灸之)**. Here, we retain the **moxibustion applied (灸之)** in the commentary for verification.

Apply moxibustion to the **apex above (巅上一灸之)**,

The **Baihui (百会)** acupoint is also one. Located at the crown’s center, within the whorl of hair where the depression of the finger fits, it is the convergence of the **Governing Vessel (督脉)** and the **Foot Taiyang (足太阳)** pulse. Needling may reach **three-tenths of the same-body inch**, or if moxibustion is applied, **five units of strength (五壮)** may be used.

Where a dog bites, apply moxibustion with **three units of strength (三壮)**. This follows the method of moxibustion for dog injuries. If a dog bite causes **chill and fever (寒热)**, apply moxibustion with **three units of strength (三壮)** using the dog-injury method.

○ *Newly corrected text (新校正)* states: If the **Foot Yangming (足阳明)** does not distinguish moxibustion separately, there would be only **twenty-eight points (二十八处)**. It is doubtful that Master Wang omitted the earlier moxibustion method. If the condition does not cease, one must examine the meridian that passes through the **Yang (阳)** side, repeatedly needle its **acupoints (俞)** and administer medicine.

**Chapter on the Water-Heat Acupoints (水热穴论篇)**
The Yellow Emperor asked: Why does the **Shao Yin (少阴)** meridian govern the **kidney (肾)**?
Why does the kidney govern **water (水)**?

Qibo replied: The kidney is the **ultimate Yin (至阴)**, and the ultimate Yin is where **water (水)** flourishes.
The **lung (肺)** is **Tai Yin (太阴)**, and the Shao Yin is the **winter pulse (冬脉)**.
Thus, its root lies in the kidney, its extremity in the lung; both accumulate **water (水)**.
Yin refers to **cold (寒)**. In winter, when cold reaches its peak, the kidney’s **qi (气)** resonates in harmony, hence it is said: *The kidney is the ultimate Yin*.
Water is sovereign in winter, hence it is said: *The ultimate Yin is where water flourishes*.
The **Shao Yin kidney meridian (肾少阴脉)** ascends from the kidney, piercing the **liver (肝)** and diaphragm, and entering the lung, hence it is said: *Its root lies in the kidney, its extremity in the lung*.
When the kidney’s **qi (气)** ascends in reverse, **water-qi (水气)** lodges in the lung, hence it is said: *Both accumulate water*.

The Yellow Emperor asked: How can the kidney accumulate water and cause illness?

Qibo replied: The kidney is the **gatekeeper of the stomach (胃之关)**, and when the gatekeeper’s passage is not smooth, water accumulates and follows its kind.
The gatekeeper regulates outflow and inflow; the kidney governs the **lower burner (下焦)**, with the **bladder (膀胱)** as its storehouse, overseeing its distribution and regulation. It controls the **two Yin orifices (二阴)**, hence when the kidney’s **qi (气)** flows, the two Yin orifices open, and when the two Yin orifices close, the stomach becomes full, hence it is said: *The kidney is the gatekeeper of the stomach*.
When the gatekeeper is closed, water accumulates; when water accumulates, **qi (气)** stagnates; when **qi (气)** stagnates, water forms; when water forms, **qi (气)** overflows. Water and **qi (气)** share the same nature, hence it is said: *When the gatekeeper’s passage is not smooth, water accumulates and follows its kind*.
*The Ling Shu Classic (灵枢经)* states: *The lower burner overflows as water*.
This is what is meant.

「Its essence is concealed. When the **qi (气)** and water overflow into the skin, **púzhǒng (驸肿)** ensues. **Púzhǒng (驸肿)** is the result of water accumulation giving rise to illness. "Upper" refers to the **lung (肺)**, and "lower" to the **kidney (肾)**. When both the lung and kidney overflow, water gathers in the abdomen and illness follows. The Emperor asked: "Does all water originate from the kidney?" Qī Bó (岐伯) replied: "The kidney is the **female organ (牝藏)**—**female (牝)**, meaning **Yin (阴)**—and it governs **Yin (阴)** positions, hence it is called the **female organ (牝藏)**. Earth **qi (气)** ascending belongs to the kidney, generating **fluids (水液)**, thus the kidney is said to receive the **sun’s daily descent into the Yin (日至阴)**.

Excessive exertion and overstrain cause **kidney sweat (肾汗)** to emerge. When this sweat encounters **wind (风)**, it cannot enter internally into the **storehouse (藏府)**, nor exit externally beyond the skin. Instead, it lingers in the **mysterious storehouse (玄府)**, circulating within the skin layers, transforming into **púzhǒng (驸肿)**. Its root lies in the kidney, and it is named **wind-water (风水)**. "Excessive exertion and overstrain" refers to **sexual overindulgence (力房)**. When **sexual overindulgence (劳勇)** causes sweating, the **mysterious storehouse (玄府)** opens; but if sweat then encounters **wind (风)**, the **mysterious storehouse (玄府)** closes again. Once closed, residual sweat cannot escape, pooling beneath the skin and converting into water, following the **wind (风)**. Thus, it is called **wind-water (风水)**.

The so-called **mysterious storehouse (玄府)** is the **sweat cavity (汗空)**. Sweat **qi (气)** is dark, emerging from this cavity, and gathering in the skin layers—hence the term **mysterious storehouse (玄府)**. **府 (府)** means "to gather."

The Emperor asked: "The **water acupoints (水俞)** number fifty-seven—what organ governs them?" Qī Bó (岐伯) replied: "The kidney has fifty-seven **acupoints (俞)**, where accumulated **Yin (积阴)** gathers, and from which water enters and exits. The five **rows (五行)** of **acupoints (俞)** on the corpse correspond to this—they are the **kidney’s acupoints (肾俞)**. The **acupoints (俞)** along the back span nearly five rows, with the central one emanating from the **Governing Vessel (督脉)**, and the four adjacent rows belonging to the **Foot Taiyang meridian (足太阳脉)**.

Thus, water-related illnesses manifest as **púzhǒng (驸肿)** and abdominal distension below, or **wheezing and labored breathing (喘呼)** above. When water settles in the kidney, it spreads downward to the abdomen and legs, causing **púzhǒng (驸肿)**. When it ascends into the lung, it triggers **wheezing and dyspnea (喘息)**, with sudden, forceful exhalations.

If water cannot be expelled externally, both the **manifestation (标)** and **root (本)** fall ill. The **manifestation (标)** is the lung, and the **root (本)** is the kidney. In such cases, it is a disease of **water accumulation in both lung and kidney (肺肾俱水)**. Hence, the lung governs **wheezing and labored breathing (喘呼)**, while the kidney governs **water retention and edema (水肿)**. The lung’s role in **wheezing and labored breathing (喘呼)** stems from its control over **respiration (呼吸)**; the kidney’s role in **water retention and edema (水肿)** arises from its governance over water.

Their **acupoints (俞)** interrelate and support one another, and both are affected by **water-qi (水气)**. If we partition their respective locations by name, it reflects the **meridians’ mutual correspondence (气相输应)**. If we trace the shared affliction to the **pathogenic water-qi (病气)**, it is all due to **water retention (水所留)**. "Retention" (留) is pronounced as **liú (力救切)**.

「Above the *fú tú* (伏菟, *tú* pronounced as *tù* 兔), there are two rows of five acupoints each—this is the **street of the kidney (肾之街)**, for *street (街)* refers to the **Dao/Way (道)**. In the abdominal region, there are five rows of central acupoints, with those on either side of the midline belonging to the **kidney’s stored meridian (足少阴脉)** and the **penetrating vessel (冲脉)**. The next rows outward belong to the **stomach’s府 (胃府)** and the **foot yang-ming meridian (足阳明脉)**. These four rows of acupoints lie above the *fú tú*.

The convergence of the three yin meridians at the foot is here. Below the ankle, there is one row of six acupoints each—this is the **kidney meridian’s downward course (肾脉之下行)**, named **Tàichōng (太冲)**. The kidney meridian and the penetrating vessel descend together along the foot, merging and expanding, hence the name *Tàichōng*.

All fifty-seven acupoints are the **hidden networks (阴络)** of the stored meridians, where **water-qi (水)** resides.

As the classics state, there are fifty-seven acupoints. On the back, five rows of five acupoints each align with the **governing vessel (督脉)** along the spine’s midline: **Jǐngzhōng (脊中)**, **Xuánshū (悬枢)**, **Mìngmén (命门)**, **Yāoshǔ (腰俞)**, and **Chángqiáng (长强)** lie in their respective positions.

Next, flanking the governing vessel on both sides, the **foot taiyang meridian (足太阳脉)** gives rise to: **Dàchángshǔ (大肠俞)**, **Xiǎochángshǔ (小肠俞)**, **Pángguāngshǔ (膀胱俞)**, **Zhōnggé-Nèishǔ (中膂内俞)**, and **Bái Huánshǔ (白环俞)**.

Further outward, the **foot taiyang meridian (足太阳脉)** again gives rise to: **Wèicāng (胃仓)**, **Huāngmén (肓门)**, **Zhìshì (志室)**, **Bāohuāng (胞肓)**, and **Zhìbiān (秩边)**.

Above the *fú tú*, there are two rows of five acupoints each. In the abdominal region, along the midline and flanking the **conception vessel (任脉)** and the **penetrating vessel (冲脉)**, where the **foot minor-yin meridian (足少阴)** converges, are: **Zhōngzhù (中注)**, **Sì Mǎn (四满)**, **Qìxué (气穴)**, **Dà Hè (大赫)**, and **Hénggǔ (横骨)**.

Next, flanking the **penetrating vessel (冲脉)** and the **foot minor-yin meridian (足少阴)**, the **foot yang-ming meridian (足阳明脉)** gives rise to: **Wàilíng (外陵)**, **Dàjù (大巨)**, **Shuǐdào (水道)**, **Guīlái (归来)**, and **Qìjiē (气街)**.

Below the ankle, there is one row of six acupoints each. On the upper inner ankle, the **foot minor-yin meridian (足少阴)** and the **yin-tà (阴踏)** meridian ascend along the medial malleolus. The **foot minor-yin meridian (足少阴)** contains **Dàzhōng (大钟)**, **Fùliú (复溜)**, and **Yīngǔ (阴谷)**. The **yin-tà meridian (阴踏)** contains **Zhàohǎi (照海)**, **Jiāoxìn (交信)**, and **Zhùbīn (筑宾)**. Though the **yin-tà** is a branch of the **foot minor-yin meridian (足少阴)**, it may also be governed as such. Counting these, one acupoint remains unaccounted for.

**Jǐngzhōng (脊中)** is located below the eleventh thoracic vertebra. To locate it, the patient should bend forward; the needle may be inserted to a depth of five *shēncǔn* (身寸, body-inch) divisions, but moxibustion is prohibited, as it may cause harm.

**Xuánshū (悬枢)** is located below the thirteenth thoracic vertebra. To locate it, the patient should bend forward; the needle may be inserted to a depth of three *shēncǔn* divisions, or moxibustion may be applied three times.

**Mìngmén (命门)** is located below the fourteenth thoracic vertebra. To locate it, the patient should lie prone; the needle may be inserted to a depth of five *shēncǔn* divisions, or moxibustion may be applied three times.

**Yāoshǔ (腰俞)** is located below the twenty-first thoracic vertebra. The needle may be inserted to a depth of two *shēncǔn* divisions. [Correction: According to the *Jiā-Yǐ Jīng* and *Miǔ Cì Lùn*, as well as the *Rè Xué* notes, the insertion depth is two *cùn* (寸). However, the *Cì Rè* and *Qì Fǔ* notes, along with this text, specify two *shēncǔn* divisions, and this should be followed.] After seven breaths, moxibustion may be applied three times.

**Chángqiáng (长强)** is at the sacral hiatus, a branch of the **governing vessel (督脉)** and a convergence of the **foot minor-yin meridian (足少阴)**. The needle may be inserted to a depth of two *shēncǔn* divisions, and after seven breaths, moxibustion may be applied three times. These five acupoints all belong to the **governing vessel (督脉)**.

[Correction: As detailed by Wang, one acupoint is missing. According to the *Qì Fǔ Lùn* notes, there is a **Yángguān (阳关)** acupoint below the twelfth thoracic vertebra. If counted, this accounts for the missing one.]

Next, flanking the **governing vessel (督脉)**, **Dàchángshǔ (大肠俞)** is located below the sixteenth thoracic vertebra, one-and-a-half *shēncǔn* from the **governing vessel (督脉)** on either side. The needle may be inserted to a depth of three *shēncǔn* divisions, and after six breaths, moxibustion may be applied three times.

**Xiǎochángshǔ (小肠俞)** is located below the eighteenth thoracic vertebra on both sides, with the same needle insertion and moxibustion methods as **Dàchángshǔ (大肠俞)**.

**Pángguāngshǔ (膀胱俞)** is located below the nineteenth thoracic vertebra on both sides, with the same needle insertion and moxibustion methods as **Dàchángshǔ (大肠俞)**.

**Zhōnggé-Nèishǔ (中膂内俞)** is located below the twentieth thoracic vertebra on both sides, with the same needle insertion and moxibustion methods as **Dàchángshǔ (大肠俞)**. It lies beside the lumbar swelling, and the needle should be retained for ten breaths.

**Bái Huánshǔ (白环俞)** is located below the twenty-first thoracic vertebra on both sides, with the same spacing as **Dàchángshǔ (大肠俞)**. To locate it, the patient should lie prone; the needle may be inserted to a depth of five *shēncǔn* divisions, or moxibustion may be applied three times.

[Correction: According to the *Jiā-Yǐ Jīng*, the needle may be inserted to a depth of eight *fēn* (分), and moxibustion is prohibited.]

These five acupoints all belong to the **foot taiyang meridian (足太阳脉)**, which are referred to as the **kidney’s back-shu points (肾俞)**.

Further outward, **Wèicāng (胃仓)** is located below the twelfth thoracic vertebra on both sides, three *shēncǔn* apart. The needle may be inserted to a depth of five *shēncǔn* divisions, or moxibustion may be applied three times.

**Huāngmén (肓门)** is located below the thirteenth thoracic vertebra on both sides, with the same needle insertion and moxibustion methods as **Wèicāng (胃仓)**.

**Zhìshì (志室)** is located below the fourteenth thoracic vertebra on both sides, with the same needle insertion and moxibustion methods as **Wèicāng (胃仓)**. It is located while the patient sits upright.

**Bāohuāng (胞肓)** is located below the nineteenth thoracic vertebra on both sides, with the same needle insertion and moxibustion methods as **Wèicāng (胃仓)**. To locate it, the patient should lie prone.

**Zhìbiān (秩边)** is located below the twenty-first thoracic vertebra on both sides, with the same needle insertion and moxibustion methods as **Wèicāng (胃仓)**. To locate it, the patient should lie prone.

These five acupoints all belong to the **foot taiyang meridian (足太阳脉)**.

Next, above the *fú tú*, there are two rows of acupoints. **Zhōngzhù (中注)** is located five *shēncǔn* divisions below the umbilicus, one *shēncǔn* from the **conception vessel (任脉)** on either side.

[Correction: According to the *Jiā-Yǐ Jīng* and the *Qì Fǔ* notes, though the text differs, the meaning is the same—one *cùn* (寸) from the midline.]

---

**Sìmǎn (四满)** is located one *cùn* below **Zhōngzhù (中注)**, on the midline. **Qìxué (气穴)** is one *cùn* below **Sìmǎn**, also on the midline. **Dàhè (大赫)** is one *cùn* below **Qìxué**, on the midline. **Hénggǔ (横骨)** is one *cùn* below **Dàhè**, on the midline. Each of these points is horizontally spaced one *cùn* from the midline, and they all belong to the **foot yangming meridian (足阳明脉)** and the **conception vessel (冲脉)** at its junction with the **foot lesser yin meridian (足少阴)**. Needling may reach one *cùn* deep; if moxibusting, five *zhuàng* may be applied.

Next are the two lateral points: **Wàilíng (外陵)** is one *cùn* below the umbilicus, on the midline.
[Correction: According to the *Qì Fǔ Lùn* (气府论), it is noted that **Wàilíng** is one *cùn* below **Tiānhéng (天枢)**. This is consistent with the above.]

The two lateral points are spaced one and a half *cùn* from the **conception vessel (冲脉)**. **Dàjù (大巨)** is one *cùn* below **Wàilíng**. **Shuǐdào (水道)** is three *cùn* below **Dàjù**. **Guīlái (归来)** is three *cùn* below **Shuǐdào**. **Qìjiē (气街)** is below **Guīlái**.

[Correction: According to the *Qì Fǔ* (气府), *Qì Rè* (刺热), and *Rèxué* (热穴) notes, **Qìjiē (气街)** is located one *cùn* above the **鼠眼 (shǔyǎn, "rat's eye")** on either end of **Hénggǔ (横骨)**. The *Qì Jìn* (刺禁) note states it is one *cùn* above the **鼠仆 (shǔpū, "rat's kneeling")** on the flanks of the abdomen, four *cùn* from the midline, where the pulse moves upon pressure. The *Gǔkōng* (骨空) note places it above the **鼠误 (shǔwù, "rat's error")** at the hairline. These notes differ, so I record them all.]

**鼠误 (Shǔwù)** is one *cùn* from the midline, with each point spaced two *cùn* apart horizontally.

The Emperor asked: *"Why in spring do we select the divergent meridian and the fleshly layer?"*
**Gībó (岐伯)** replied: *"Spring is when wood begins to dominate, and liver *qi* first arises. Liver *qi* is swift, its wind fierce, and the meridians lie deep with little *qi* present. Unable to penetrate deeply, we take the divergent meridians and the fleshly layer to reach the *qi*."*

The Emperor asked: *"Why in summer do we select the robust meridian and the victorious layer?"*
**Gībó** replied: *"Summer is when fire begins to dominate, and heart *qi* grows strong. The pulses are slender, the *qi* weak, and the yang *qi* overflows. Heat concentrates on the victorious layer, reaching even the meridians. Thus, we take the robust meridian and the victorious layer. When needling breaks the skin and the illness departs, the evil *qi* was shallow. 'Break' means to pierce through, allowing the illness to escape. The robust meridian refers to the yang meridians."*

The Emperor asked: *"Why in autumn do we select the meridian points and the convergences?"*
**Gībó** replied: *"Autumn is when metal begins to dominate, and the lungs prepare to withdraw and kill. The three yin meridians have already ascended#1, so metal gradually withdraws and kills. Metal overcomes fire, and the yang *qi* is at the convergences#2. The yin *qi* is just beginning to prevail, while damp *qi* reaches the body. With the gradual onset of rain, dampness, mist, and dew#3, we say damp *qi* reaches the body. The yin *qi* is not yet strong, so it cannot penetrate deeply. Thus, we take the points to disperse yin evil and the convergences to weaken yang evil. The yang *qi* begins to decline, so we take the convergences. This is the treatment variation of the early autumn."*

The Emperor asked: *"Why in winter do we select the well and spring points?"*
**Gībó** replied: *"Winter is when water begins to dominate, and the kidneys are closing. Yang *qi* is declining and weak, while yin *qi* is strong and firm. The greater yang meridian is submerged and recedes#4. The yang meridians then withdraw#5, so we take the well points to counter yin inversion and the spring points to nourish the yang *qi*.*
[Correction: According to **Quán Yuánqǐ (全元起)**, the original text reads *遣* (qiǎn, "dismiss") instead of *实* (shí, "nourish"), while the *Jiā-Yǐ Jīng* (甲乙经) and *Qiān Jīn Fāng* (千金方) read *通* (tōng, "unblock").]

Thus, it is said: *"In winter, take the well and spring points; in spring, do not take the convergences#6."* This is the treatment variation before winter.

[Correction: According to **Huángfǔ Shì’ān (皇甫士安)**, this refers to the treatment variation of early autumn.]

This is the principle.

[Correction: According to this text, the meaning differs significantly from the *Sìshí Qì Nì Fǒng* (四时刺逆从论) and *Zhěnyào Jīngzhōng Lùn* (诊要经终论), but aligns with the *Jiǔjuàn* (九卷).]

---

**On the ankle, there is one row of six points:**
**Dàzhōng (大钟)** is located behind the **inner ankle** at the **street (街)**.
[Correction: According to the *Jiā-Yǐ Jīng* (甲乙经), it is noted as **冲中 (chōngzhōng, "central surge")** behind the heel. The *Qì Yuè* (刺疟) and *Qì Yāotòng* (刺腰痛) notes describe it as the **street (街)** behind the heel where the pulse moves. This text states "behind the inner ankle," which is incorrect.]

For the **foot lesser yin divergent meridian (足少阴络)**, which runs through the **foot taiyang meridian (足太阳)**, needling may reach two *cùn* deep, with retention for three breaths. If moxibusting, three *zhuàng* may be applied.

**Fùliù (复溜)** is located two *cùn* above the inner ankle, in the **陷者 (xiànzhě, "depression")**. It is where the **foot lesser yin meridian (足少阴脉)** passes. Needling may reach three *cùn* deep, with retention for three breaths. If moxibusting, five *zhuàng* may be applied.

**Zhàohǎi (照海)** is located below the inner ankle. Needling may reach four *cùn* deep, with retention for six breaths. If moxibusting, three *zhuàng* may be applied.

**Jiāoxìn (交信)** is located two *cùn* above the inner ankle, between the **lesser yin meridian (少阴)** in front and the **greater yin meridian (太阴)** behind, at the **street of Yīnjì (阴跻)**. Needling may reach four *cùn* deep, with retention for five breaths. If moxibusting, three *zhuàng* may be applied.

**Zhùbīn (筑宾)** is located at the upper division of the inner ankle, at the **street of Yīnwéi (阴维)**. Needling may reach three *cùn* deep. If moxibusting, five *zhuàng* may be applied.

**Yīngǔ (阴谷)** is located below the knee, behind the **inner condyle of the femur (内辅骨)**, beneath the **greater hamstring tendon (大筋)**, and above the **smaller hamstring tendon (小筋)**. Pressure here yields a response. It is found by flexing the knee, where the **foot lesser yin meridian (足少阴脉)** enters. Needling may reach four *cùn* deep. If moxibusting, three *zhuàng* may be applied.

The points below the **kidney meridian (肾经)** are collectively known as **Tàichōng (太冲)**.

The Yellow Emperor said: "Master, you spoke of treating heat diseases at fifty-nine points. I have pondered your meaning but cannot yet distinguish their exact locations. I wish to hear their precise locations and, in doing so, to understand your intent."

Qìbó (岐伯) replied: "The five points in the **central row of the head (头上五行行五者)** are used to **reverse the pathogenic heat of all the yang meridians (越诸阳之热逆)**.

The five points in the central row are:
- **Shàngxīng (上星)**, located directly above the **nasal bridge (鼻中央)** on the **cranium (颅)**, within the hairline, one *cùn* (寸) deep—**same-body measurement (同身寸)**—depressed to the width of a **middle finger (中容一很)**, needling may reach three *fēn* (分) of the *cùn*. Retention is for **six breaths (六呼)**. If moxibusting, **five cones (五壮)** may be applied.
- **Zìhuì (自会)**, one *cùn* behind **Shàngxīng (上星)**, depressed to the width of a **middle finger (中容一很)**, needling may reach four *fēn* of the *cùn*.
- **Qiántǐng (前顶)**, one *cùn* and five *fēn* behind **Zìhuì (自会)**, between the bones, depressed—needling follows the method of **Zìhuì (自会)**.
- **Bǎihuì (百会)**, one *cùn* and five *fēn* behind **Qiántǐng (前顶)**, at the **center of the crown (顶中央)**, where the hair whorls, depressed to the width of a **finger (容指)**, the convergence of the **Governing Vessel (督脉)** and the **foot greater yang meridian (足太阳脉)**. Needling follows the method of **Shàngxīng (上星)**.
- **Hòutǐng (后顶)**, one *cùn* and five *fēn* behind **Bǎihuì (百会)**, on the **occipital bone (枕骨)**, needling follows the method of **Zìhuì (自会)**.

These five points are all where **qi of the Governing Vessel (督脉气)** emerges. **Shàngxīng (上星)** retains the needle for six breaths; if moxibusting, **five cones (五壮)** may be applied.

The next five points on the **lateral sides of the head (次两傍穴)** are:
- **Wǔchù (五处)**, one *cùn* and five *fēn* from **Shàngxīng (上星)** on both sides.
- **Chéngguāng (承光)**, one *cùn* behind **Wǔchù (五处)**.
- **Tōngtiān (通天)**, one *cùn* and five *fēn* behind **Chéngguāng (承光)**.
- **Luòquè (络却)**, one *cùn* and five *fēn* behind **Tōngtiān (通天)**.
- **Yùzhěn (玉枕)**, seven *fēn* behind **Luòquè (络却)**.

These five points are all where **qi of the foot greater yang and foot lesser yang meridians (足太阳少阳)** and the **Yang Linking Vessel (阳维)** converge. Needling may reach three *fēn* of the *cùn*. **Wǔchù (五处)** and **Tōngtiān (通天)** each retain the needle for seven breaths; **Luòquè (络却)** for five breaths; and **Yùzhěn (玉枕)** for three breaths. If moxibusting, **three cones (三壮)** may be applied.
*Annotation: According to the **Jia-Yi Jing (甲乙经)**, **Chéngguāng (承光)** is not moxibusted, and **Yùzhěn (玉枕)** is needled to a depth of two *fēn* of the *cùn*.*

The next five points on the **outer lateral sides of the head (又次两傍)** are:
- **Línqì (临泣)**, one *cùn* and five *fēn* above the **eyes (目)**, within the hairline, the convergence of the **foot greater yang (足太阳)**, **foot lesser yang (少阳)**, and **Yang Linking Vessel (阳维)** meridians. Retention is for seven breaths; if moxibusting, **five cones (五壮)** may be applied.
- **Mùchuāng (目窗)**, one *cùn* from **Línqì (临泣)**.
- **Zhèngyíng (正营)**, one *cùn* from **Mùchuāng (目窗)**.
- **Chénglíng (承灵)**, one *cùn* and five *fēn* from **Zhèngyíng (正营)**.
- **Nǎokōng (脑空)**, one *cùn* and five *fēn* from **Chénglíng (承灵)**.

These five points are all where **qi of the foot lesser yang and Yang Linking Vessel (足少阳阳维)** meridians converge. Needling may reach four *fēn* of the *cùn* for **Nǎokōng (脑空)** and three *fēn* of the *cùn* for the others.

The eight points below—**Dàzhū (大杼)**, **Yīngyǔ (膺俞)**, **Quēpén (缺盆)**, and **Bèiyǔ (背俞)**—are used to **drain heat from the chest (写胸中之热)**.

- **Dàzhū (大杼)** is located one *cùn* and five *fēn* from the **first cervical vertebra (项第一椎)** on both sides, the convergence of the **Governing Vessel (督脉)** and the **Separate Collateral of the hand and foot greater yang meridians (别络手足太阳)**. Needling may reach three *fēn* of the *cùn*, with retention for seven breaths; if moxibusting, **five cones (五壮)** may be applied.
*Annotation: According to the **Jia-Yi Jing (甲乙经)** and the note in the **Qi Xue (气穴)**, it is recorded as **seven cones (七壮)** for moxibustion, while the notes in **Sutras for Treating Malaria (刺疟)** and **Sutras for Treating Heat (刺热)** record **five cones (五壮)**.*

- **Yīngyǔ (膺俞)**, also known as **Zhōngfǔ (中府)**, is located in the **chest center (胸中)**, one *cùn* and six *fēn* from the midline on both sides, one *cùn* below **Yúnmén (云门)**, between the **third and fourth ribs (乳上三肋)**, where the **pulsing artery (动脉)** responds to pressure, depressed. It is taken while reclining, the convergence of the **hand and foot lesser yin meridians (手足太阴)**. Needling may reach three *fēn* of the *cùn*, with retention for five breaths; if moxibusting, **five cones (五壮)** may be applied.

- **Quēpén (缺盆)** is located in the depression of the **horizontal bone of the shoulder (肩上横骨)**, where the **qi of the hand greater yang meridian (手阳明脉气)** emerges. Needling may reach two *fēn* of the *cùn*, with retention for seven breaths; if moxibusting, **three cones (三壮)** may be applied.

- **Bèiyǔ (背俞)**, also known as **Fēngmén (风门)** and **Rèfǔyǔ (热府俞)**, is located one *cùn* and five *fēn* from the **second cervical vertebra (第二椎)** on both sides, the convergence of the **Governing Vessel (督脉)** and the **foot greater yang meridian (足太阳)**. Needling may reach five *fēn* of the *cùn*, with retention for seven breaths; if moxibusting, **five cones (五壮)** may be applied.
*Annotation: According to the **Zhèngyào Kǒng Xuē Tújīng (中诰孔穴图经)**, the name is not given here, but it is referred to as **Fēngmén (风门)** and **Rèfǔ (热府)**, which are the **back points for treating heat (背俞)**.*

- **Rèfǔ (热府)**, as recorded in the **Sutras for Treating Heat (刺热论)**, is unclear as to its exact location, but here it is specifically indicated as **Fēngmén (风门)** and **Rèfǔ (热府)**. In the **Qi Xue (气穴论)**, it is noted that **Dàzhū (大杼)** is the **back point for treating heat (背俞)**. The discrepancies in these three annotations suggest confusion among the commentators.

The next eight points—**Qìjiē (气街)**, **Sānlǐ (三里)**, **Jùxū (巨虚)** with its **upper (上)** and **lower (下)** **Lian (廉)**—are used to **drain heat from the stomach (写胃中之热)**.

- **Qìjiē (气街)** is located below the **umbilicus (腹齐)**, at the **ends of the transverse bone (横骨)**, one *cùn* above the **pubic symphysis (鼠辱)**, where the **pulsing artery (动脉)** responds to pressure. It is where **qi of the foot greater yang meridian (足阳明脉气)** emerges. Needling may reach three *fēn* of the *cùn*, with retention for seven breaths; if moxibusting, **three cones (三壮)** may be applied.
*Annotation: The various annotations for **Qìjiē (气街)** differ; see the previous notes in the **Shuǐ Xuē (水穴)**.*

- **Sānlǐ (三里)** is located three *cùn* below the **knee (膝)**, outside the **patella (腑)**, between the **two hamstring tendons (两筋)** and the **muscles (肉)**, where the **foot greater yang meridian (足阳明脉)** enters. Needling may reach one *cùn*, with retention for seven breaths; if moxibusting, **three cones (三壮)** may be applied.

- **Jùxū (巨虚) Shànglián (上廉)**, where the **foot greater yang (足阳明)** and **foot greater yang (太阳)** meridians converge, is located three *cùn* below **Sānlǐ (三里)**, where **qi of the foot greater yang meridian (足阳明脉气)** emerges. Needling may reach eight *fēn* of the *cùn*; if moxibusting, **three cones (三壮)** may be applied.

- **Jùxū (巨虚) Xiàlián (下廉)**, where the **foot greater yang (足阳明)** and **foot lesser yang (少阳)** meridians converge, is located three *cùn* below **Shànglián (上廉)**, where **qi of the foot greater yang meridian (足阳明脉气)** emerges. Needling may reach three *fēn* of the *cùn*; if moxibusting, **three cones (三壮)** may be applied.

Yúnmén (云门), *kēgǔ* (髁骨), Wěizhōng (委中), and *suǐkōng* (髓空)—these eight points are used to **dispel** the **heat** of the four limbs.

- **Yúnmén (云门)** is located below **Jùgǔ (巨骨)**, along the chest’s midline, three *cùn* apart from the sides. The **pulse** responds upon touch, where **qi of the foot greater yin meridian (足太阴脉气)** emerges. *(○ Newly corrected: According to the *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng* (甲乙经) and the annotation of *Qì Xué* (气穴), as well as the annotation of *Cì Rè* (刺热), it should be **hand greater yin meridian (手太阴)**.)*
  *(○ Raise the arm to locate it; needling may reach seven *fēn* of the *cùn*; if moxibusting, **five cones (五壮)** may be applied.)*

- **Kēgǔ (髁骨)** *(now **Jiānkē (肩髑)** in the *Zhōnghuì Kǒng Xué Tújīng* (中诰孔穴图经)) lies between the two bones at the shoulder’s end, where the **hand greater yang meridian (手阳明)** and **foot greater yang meridian (足太阳)** converge. Needling may reach six *fēn* of the *cùn*; if moxibustion, **three cones (三壮)** may be applied.

- **Wěizhōng (委中)** is located at the back of the knee when bent, where the **popliteal artery (胭中央)** and **saphenous vein (文中)** pulsate. It is where the **foot greater yang meridian (足太阳脉)** enters. Needling may reach five *fēn* of the *cùn*; if moxibustion, **three cones (三壮)** may be applied.

- *Suǐkōng (髓空)* *(now known as **Yāoyú (腰俞)** in the *Zhōnghuì Kǒng Xué Tújīng*)* is located below the **21st vertebra (第二十一椎节)** of the spine. It governs **failure of sweat (汗不出)** and **numbness of the feet (足清不仁)**. Here, **qi of the Governing meridian (督脉)** emerges. Needling may reach two *fēn* of the *cùn*; if moxibustion, **three cones (三壮)** may be applied. *(○ Newly corrected: The needling depth of two *cùn* for Yāoyú should be two *fēn*; this is already detailed in the previous #5 annotation of *Shuǐ Xué* (水穴).)*

The **five yū points beside the spine (俞傍五)**, namely **Pòhù (魄户)**, *Shéntáng* (神堂), **Húnmén (魂门)**, **Yìhé (意合)**, and **Zhìshì (志室)**, are located three *cùn* apart from the midline on either side of the spine. All are where **qi of the foot greater yang meridian (足太阳脉气)** emerges.

- **Pòhù (魄户)** is located three *cùn* beside the **3rd vertebra (第三椎)**. In a seated position, needling may reach five *fēn* of the *cùn*; if moxibustion, **five cones (五壮)** may be applied.
- *Shéntáng (神堂)* is located three *cùn* beside the **5th vertebra (第五椎)**. Needling may reach three *fēn* of the *cùn*; if moxibustion, **five cones (五壮)** may be applied.
- **Húnmén (魂门)** is located three *cùn* beside the **9th vertebra (第九椎)**. In a seated position, needling may reach five *fēn* of the *cùn*; if moxibustion, **three cones (三壮)** may be applied.
- **Yìhé (意合)** *(now **Yìshè (意舍)**)* is located three *cùn* beside the **11th vertebra (第十一椎)**. In a seated position, needling may reach five *fēn* of the *cùn*; if moxibustion, **three cones (三壮)** may be applied.
- **Zhìshì (志室)** is located three *cùn* beside the **14th vertebra (第十四椎)**. In a seated position, needling may reach five *fēn* of the *cùn*; if moxibustion, **three cones (三壮)** may be applied.

All these **fifty-nine points (五十九穴)** are for treating **heat** on the left and right sides.

The Emperor said: *"When a person is injured by cold, how does it then become heat?"*

Gūibó (岐伯) replied: *"Cold in excess generates heat. When cold *qi* congeals externally, the **yang *qi* (阳气)** is suppressed internally. The **vital principles (胜理)**** become rigid and constrained, the **mysterious orifices (玄府)** are sealed shut. This causes *qi* to stagnate and fail to circulate freely, and the **humid *qi* (湿气)** to condense internally. The internal and external *qi* clash, and with cold prevailing, heat arises. Thus, when a person is injured by cold, it transforms into heat. Sweating to relieve it cures the condition, revealing the mechanism of external congealing and internal suppression. This is the case for new illnesses of several days."*

**Chapter: *Tiáojīng Lùn* (调经论)**

The Emperor asked: *"I have heard that acupuncture follows the principle of **‘excess is drained, deficiency is supplemented’ (刺法喜向，有余写之，不足补之)**. What is meant by **‘excess’ (有余)**? What is meant by **‘deficiency’ (不足)**?"*

Gūibó replied: *"Both excess and deficiency have five aspects—deficiency also has five. Your Majesty wishes to inquire which?"*

The Emperor said: *"I wish to hear it all."*

Gūibó said: *"The **spirit (神)** has excess and deficiency, the **qi (气)** has excess and deficiency, the **blood (血)** has excess and deficiency, the **body form (形)** has excess and deficiency, and the **will/intent (志)** has excess and deficiency. Altogether, these ten aspects are where the **imbalances of *qi* (气不等)** arise.

The **spirit (神)** belongs to the Heart, the **qi (气)** belongs to the Lungs, the **blood (血)** belongs to the Liver, the **body form (形)** belongs to the Spleen, and the **will/intent (志)** belongs to the Kidneys. Since each organ has its own governing principle, the imbalances arise.

The Emperor said: *"Humans possess **essence, *qi*, bodily fluids, and humors (精气津液)**; four limbs and nine orifices; five **viscera (藏)** and sixteen divisions; three hundred and sixty-five **nodes (节)**. From these arise a hundred diseases, and all diseases are marked by **‘void and repletion’ (虚实)**. Now, Master, you speak of five excesses and five deficiencies—how do they give rise to disease?"*

The *Zhēnjīng* states: *"The two **spirits (神)** intermingle, coalesce to form the body, and first arise as **essence (精)**. The **upper burner (上焦)**** opens and releases, disseminating the flavors of the five grains. It nourishes the skin, fills the body, and moistens the hair, like mist and dew watering the earth—this is **‘*qi* (气)**. When the **vital principles (胜理)**** discharge, and sweat emerges from the **vital principles (胜理)****, this is **‘bodily fluids (津)**. When **bodily fluids (津)**** seep into the **void orifices (空窍)****, and stagnate without flowing freely, they become **‘humors (液)**.

The **sixteen divisions (十六部)**** refer to the two hands, two feet, and nine orifices—totaling sixteen divisions. The **three hundred and sixty-five nodes (三百六十五节)**** do not refer to **‘joints (骨节)****, but rather to the places where **spirit and *qi* (神气)**** enter and exit."*

The *Zhēnjīng* further states: *"The **‘intersections of nodes’ (节之交)****, the three hundred and sixty-five **‘convergences’ (会)****, are all where **spirit and *qi* (神气)**** enter, exit, and circulate. They are not **‘joints (骨节)****. How do diseases arise from the **‘many and few’ (所有则多，所举则少)**** of the body’s nodes? Gūibó replied: *"All diseases arise from the five **viscera (藏)****. Specifically, from the five **spiritual viscera (神藏)****.

The Heart houses the **spirit (神)****, the Lungs house the **qi (气)****, the Liver houses the **blood (血)****, the Spleen houses the **flesh (肉)****, and the Kidneys house the **will/intent (志)****. These principles coalesce to form the body.

How do diseases arise from the five **viscera (藏)****? It is because the **five spiritual principles (五神)**** are housed within and form the viscera. When the **will/intent (志意)**** is harmonious, it internally connects with the **bone marrow (骨髓)****, thus forming the body, the viscera, and the five **spiritual principles (神)****. The **will/intent (志意)**** refers to the **‘great faculties’ (大几)**** of the five spiritual principles. The **bone marrow (骨髓)**** refers to the **‘outer manifestations and transformations’ (表裹之成化)****.

When the five spiritual principles are harmonious and the bone marrow transforms fully, the body and viscera are established, and then the five viscera mutually influence each other’s excesses and deficiencies."*

**New verification** states: *"According to the *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* (甲乙经), there are no characters **‘viscera (藏)****. The principles of the five viscera all emerge from the **‘channels and collaterals (经隧)****, which circulate **blood and *qi* (血气)****. When **blood and *qi* (血气)**** are disharmonious, a hundred diseases arise and transform. Thus, one must **‘guard the channels and collaterals (守经隧)****. The **‘collaterals’ (隧)**** are the **‘hidden pathways (潜道)****. The **‘channels’ (经脉)**** run deep and unseen, hence they are called **‘channels and collaterals (经隧)****. **Blood and *qi* (血气)**** are the **‘spirit’ (神)**** of humans; when **‘evil’ (邪)**** invades, **blood and *qi* (血气)**** become irregular, and irregular **blood and *qi* (血气)**** cause a hundred diseases to arise and transform. The **‘channels’ (经脉)**** are what govern **‘life and death’ (死生)****, treat a hundred diseases, and **‘adjust void and repletion (虚实)****. Therefore, one must **‘guard the channels and collaterals (守经隧)***."*

**New verification** states: *"According to the *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* (甲乙经), **‘channels and collaterals (经隧)**** are written as **‘channels and conduits (经渠)****, but their meanings are the same. #1"*

The Emperor asked: *"What are the signs when the **spirit (神)**** has excess or deficiency?"*

Gūibó replied: *"When the **spirit (神)**** has excess, the person laughs incessantly; when the **spirit (神)**** is deficient, the person is melancholy. #2 This pertains to the Heart’s **‘house’ (藏)***. The *Zhēnjīng* states: *"The Heart houses the **pulse (脉)****, and the **pulse (脉)**** contains the **spirit (神)****. When the Heart’s **‘*qi* (气)**** is void, the person is melancholy; when it is replete, the person laughs incessantly. Melancholy, in one case, is **‘worry’ (忧)***—this is an error."*

**New verification** states: *"Upon careful review, Master Wang’s annotation states: **‘Melancholy, in one case, is **‘worry’ (忧)***—this is an error.’** According to the *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* (甲乙经) and *Tàisū* (太素), as well as the full edition of the *Yuánqǐ* (元起) commentary, it is all written as **‘worry’ (忧)***. **Huángfǔ Shì’ān** (皇甫士安) states: *"When the Heart is void, it causes melancholy; melancholy leads to worry. When the Heart is replete, it causes laughter; laughter leads to joy. The Heart and Lungs, and the Spleen and Heart, mutually form each other. Thus, joy originates in the Heart and completes in the Lungs; worry originates in the Spleen and completes in the Heart. When one exceeds its **‘proper measure’ (节)****, both viscera are injured."*

**Yáng Shàngshàn** (杨上善) states: *"The **‘melancholy’ (忧)**** of the Heart lies in its **‘variations’ (变动)****. The **‘melancholy’ (忧)**** of the Lungs lies in the **‘will/intent’ (志)**** of the Lungs. Thus, the Lungs govern autumn, and melancholy is their **‘proper emotion’ (正)****. The Heart governs summer, and its **‘variations’ (变)**** give rise to melancholy. Before **blood and *qi* (血气)**** coalesce, the five viscera are stable. When **‘evil’ (邪)**** lodges in the **‘body form’ (形)****, it first manifests as **‘shivering’ (洒淅)**** on the **‘hair follicles’ (毫毛)****, but has not yet entered the **‘channels and collaterals (经络)****. Thus, it is called **‘the subtle disease of spirit’ (神之微)***. Coalesce refers to **‘uniting’ (并合)****. Before uniting with **‘evil’ (邪)****, it is called **‘not yet united’ (未并)****. **‘Shivering’ (洒淅)**** is a cold appearance, first arising at the **‘hair follicles’ (毫毛)****, still within the **‘fine collaterals’ (小络)****. This is the **‘subtle disease of spirit’ (神之微病)****, hence it is called **‘the subtle disease of spirit’ (神之微)***."*

**New verification** states: *"According to the *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* (甲乙经), **‘shivering’ (洒淅)**** is written as **‘chill and convulsion’ (凄厥)****; in the *Tàisū* (太素), it is written as **‘pores and reverse flow’ (洫沂)****. **Yáng Shàngshàn** (杨上善) states: **‘*Xì* (洫)****, refers to **‘hair follicles/pores’ (毫毛)****; **‘reverse flow’ (逆流)**** is called **‘*yí* (沂)***.*"*

«When **evil qi** invades the **dominant meridians** (勝理), it behaves like water flowing backward through the **pores** (洫). The Yellow Emperor asked: *“How should one treat this with bloodletting and moxibustion?”*

Qibo replied: *“If **Dao/Way** (神) is in excess, one may let blood from its **fine collaterals** (小络) without piercing deeply into the **major meridians** (大經), thus restoring balance to **Dao/Way and qi** (神氣). Since the **evil** (邪) has entered the **fine collaterals** (小络), one may let blood from its **collateral pulses** (小络之脉), but avoid deep insertion of the needle—deep insertion risks harming the flesh. As the **evil** (邪) resides in the **fine collaterals** (小络), one must not allow the needle to strike the **major meridians** (大經). Once the **collateral blood** (络血) has been released, **Dao/Way and qi** (神氣) will naturally return to equilibrium.

*斥* (斥) means to **pierce deeply** (推). The **fine collaterals** (小络) are the **grand collaterals** (孙络). *“The *Needle Canon* (针经) states: The **major meridians** (經脉) are like **wrappings** (裹), while their **branches and horizontal extensions** (支而横者) are called **collaterals** (络). The **divergent pathways of the collaterals** (络之别者) are the **grand collaterals** (孙络).” Equilibrium refers to **harmonizing and regulating** (平调).

*The New Verification* states: *“This annotation cites the *Needle Canon* (针经) alongside the *Three Divisions and Nine Lords Treatise* (三部九侯论), where the latter refers to it as the *Miraculous Pivot* (灵枢). Thus, Wang’s intention is to point to the *Miraculous Pivot* (灵枢) as the *Needle Canon* (针经). According to the *Plain Questions* (素问) commentaries today, many passages citing the *Needle Canon* (针经) actually draw from the *Miraculous Pivot* (灵枢). However, since the *Miraculous Pivot* (灵枢) is incomplete in its current form, we cannot fully ascertain its meaning.”*

If **Dao/Way** (神) is insufficient, one should observe its **empty collaterals** (虚络), press them to **concentrate the qi** (致之), and **needle and harmonize** (刺而利之) without letting blood or **dispersing the qi** (泄其气), thus **unblocking the major meridians** (通其经) and restoring balance to **Dao/Way and qi** (神氣). One simply **unblocks the major meridians** (通经脉) to promote their **smooth flow and harmony** (和利), or presses the **empty collaterals** (虚络) to **concentrate the qi** (令其气致). Since **Dao/Way** (神) is insufficient, one must avoid letting blood or dispersing the qi.

*The New Verification* states: *“According to the *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* (甲乙经), *按* (按) should be read as **‘cut’** (切), and *利* (利) as **‘harmonize’** (和).”*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *“How should one needle the **subtle disease** (微)?”*
Referring to the **initial onset** (前初起) at the **hair follicles** (毫毛), before it has entered the **meridians and collaterals** (经络).

Qibo replied: *“Do not disperse the disease through massage, nor deeply pierce with the needle. Instead, **concentrate the qi** (移气) where it is insufficient, and **Dao/Way and qi** (神氣) will thus recover. Massage the affected area without releasing the pressure, and when inserting the needle at the site of the disease, do not deeply pierce. This allows the patient’s **Dao/Way and qi** (神氣) to **turn inward toward the needle** (内朝於针), **concentrating the qi** (移其人神气) to restore its sufficiency. Then the **subtle disease** (微病) will naturally dissipate, and **Dao/Way and qi** (神氣) will return to normal.”

*The New Verification* states: *“According to the *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* (甲乙经) and the *Tàisū* (太素), it reads **‘concentrate the qi at the foot’** (移气於足), without the **‘not’** (不) character. Yang Shangshan states: **‘Massage is to direct the qi toward the heel’** (按摩，使气至於踵也).”*

The Yellow Emperor said: *“Excellent.”*
*“How does one address **qi that is in excess or deficiency** (气有余不足)?”*

Qibo replied: *“If **qi** (气) is in excess, there will be **shortness of breath, coughing, and upward-rising qi** (喘咳上气); if it is deficient, there will be **smooth breathing but little qi** (息利少气). The **lung** (肺) is the **storehouse** (藏) of **qi**. If the **lung’s qi** (肺气) is not smoothly flowing, one will **wheeze** (喘). The *Needle Canon* (针经) states: *“If the **lung’s qi** (肺气) is empty, then **nasal breathing is smooth but there is little qi** (鼻息利少气); if it is full, one **wheezes, gasps, and breathes with chest heaving** (喘喝胸凭仰息).”*

When **blood and qi have not yet united** (血气未并), and the **five zàng organs** (五藏) are stable, with only **minor ailments in the skin** (皮肤微病), this is called **‘*Báiqì* (白气) subtle leakage’** (微泄). The **lung** (肺) corresponds to the **skin** (皮), and its color is **white** (白), hence when the **skin** (皮肤) has minor ailments, it is called **‘*Báiqì* (白气) subtle leakage’** (白气微泄).

The Yellow Emperor asked: *“How should one treat this with bloodletting and moxibustion?”*

Qibo replied: *“If **qi** (气) is in excess, one may let blood from its **meridian pathways** (经隧) without harming the **meridian** (经) or letting blood or dispersing **qi** (气). If it is deficient, one should **reinforce the meridian pathways** (补其经隧) without dispersing **qi** (气). **Qi** (气) refers to **nutritive qi** (荣气). If one **bloodlets or needles** (针写) and **harms the meridian** (伤其经), then **blood will be released and nutritive qi dispersed** (血出而荣气泄脱). Thus, one must avoid letting blood or dispersing **qi** (气), only **releasing defensive qi** (卫气) instead. When **reinforcing with moxibustion** (针补), one should **select appropriate acupuncture points** (馑闭穴俞), yet even then, one must not disperse the **defensive qi** (卫气).”

*The New Verification* states: *“According to Yang Shangshan: **‘Meridian pathways** (经隧) refers to the **secondary branch** (别) of the **Hand Taiyin meridian** (手太阴). It travels from the **Hand Taiyin meridian** (手太阴) to the **Hand Yangming meridian** (手阳明), marking the **pathway from Hand Taiyin to Hand Yangming** (手太阴向手阳明之道). To **conduct the Dao/Way and qi** (道藏府阴阳) between the **zàng** (藏) and **fǔ** (府) organs and their **yin-yang** (阴阳) properties, both **reinforcement** (补) and **bloodletting** (写) should follow the **primary meridian** (正经) and its **secondary collateral routes** (别走之络). When bloodletting from a **yin meridian** (某阴经), one must not harm its **primary meridian** (正经).”*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *“How should one needle the **‘*Báiqì* (白气) subtle leakage’** (微泄)?”* —
Referring to the **previous discussion** (覆前).

Qi Bao said:
*"Do not cease the massage once the needle is withdrawn; observe the patient and say, ‘I will now deepen the insertion.’ If the needle is inserted too shallowly after being deepened, the vital essence and qi will retreat, while the pathogenic qi will scatter and find no place to rest. When the pathogenic qi is expelled beyond its natural limits, the true qi will then harmonize with the skin and flesh.

The term **‘massage’** refers to the affected area. **‘Re** (革)’ means *‘to change’*—when the patient hears the announcement of deep insertion but is instead given a shallow one, they will exhibit a fearful expression, causing the vital essence and qi to conceal themselves. If the needle’s adjustment aligns with the skin’s surface, the vital essence will retreat, and the pathogenic qi, finding no foothold, will scatter and dissipate beyond its natural course. Once the pathogenic qi is expelled, the true qi will then harmonize with the skin and flesh.

The Yellow Emperor said: ‘Excellent.’

**‘How does excess or deficiency of blood manifest?’**
Qi Bao said:
*‘Excess blood leads to anger; deficiency leads to fear. This pertains to the liver’s domain.’*
The *Needle Classic* states:
*‘The liver stores blood; when liver qi is deficient, fear arises; when excessive, anger emerges.’*

When blood and qi have not yet unified and the five **zàng** (藏) organs remain stable, if the **minor collateral vessels** (孙络) overflow externally, stagnant blood may remain in the **primary meridians** (经). If the collaterals harbor pathogens and their influence grows strong, they may invade the primary meridians—hence, *‘when minor collaterals overflow externally, stagnant blood remains in the meridians.’*

The Yellow Emperor asked: **‘How should one reinforce or bloodlet?’**
Qi Bao said:
*‘If blood is in excess, bloodlet from the overfilled meridian to release its blood. If deficient, needle the pulse within the empty meridian, leaving the needle inserted for a prolonged period.’*
*(The *Jia-Yi Classic* and *Tai Su* state: ‘Leave the needle until the blood arrives.’)*

*‘If the pulse is large, withdraw the needle swiftly to prevent blood leakage. When the meridian’s pulse is full and tense, blood is in excess—thus, it must be released. If the meridian’s energy is deficient, blood is insufficient—hence, one must avoid excessive bloodletting. Leaving the needle inserted for a long time before swift withdrawal is called **reinforcement**.’*
The *Needle Resolution Treatise* states:
*‘Slow insertion followed by swift withdrawal strengthens.’*
This aligns with the same principle.

The Yellow Emperor asked: **‘How does one needle stagnant blood?’**
Qi Bao said:
*‘Observe the blood collaterals and lance them to release the blood, ensuring no malignant blood re-enters the meridians to worsen the condition. If the blood collaterals are distended, press and lance them to expel the dark, pathogenic blood, preventing it from entering the meridians.’*

The Yellow Emperor said: **‘Excellent.’**

**‘How does excess or deficiency of form manifest?’**
Qi Bao said:
*‘Excess form results in abdominal distension, difficult urination, and dysmenorrhea; deficiency leads to impaired limb function. This pertains to the spleen’s domain.’*
The *Needle Classic* states:
*‘When spleen qi is deficient, the limbs become unusable, and the five **zàng** organs grow unstable; when excessive, the abdomen distends, and urination and menstruation become obstructed.’*
*(Urination refers to **dàbiàn** (大便); menstruation refers to **yùejīng** (月经).)*

When blood and qi have not yet unified and the five **zàng** organs remain stable, if the muscles twitch due to **‘micro-wind’** (微风)—a phenomenon where pathogenic forces thin the flesh and obstruct **wei qi** (卫气), causing **yang qi** (阳气) to surge inward—this movement is observed.

The Yellow Emperor asked: **‘How should one reinforce or bloodlet?’**
Qi Bao said:
*‘If form is in excess, bloodlet from the **yang meridians** (阳经); if deficient, reinforce the **yang collaterals** (阳络).’*
*(Together, they are called **jingluò** (经络).)*

The Yellow Emperor asked: **‘How does one needle **‘micro’** conditions?’**
Qi Bao said:
*‘Needle between the muscle layers, avoiding the primary meridians and injuring the collaterals. When **wei qi** recovers, the pathogenic qi will disperse.’*
**Wei qi** warms the muscle layers and nourishes the skin, maintaining the **shènglǐ** (胜理) and regulating openings and closures. Thus, when muscles twitch, needle between the muscle layers to expel the pathogen—without piercing the meridians or damaging the collaterals. Once **wei qi** restores its proper function, the pathogenic qi will scatter completely.

The Yellow Emperor said: **‘Excellent.’**

The Yellow Emperor asked: **‘What are the excesses and deficiencies of the will (志)?’**
Qi Bao replied:
*‘Excess of will causes abdominal distension and diarrhea after meals; deficiency causes syncope (厥). The kidneys store the will. The *Needle Classic* (《针经》) states: The kidneys store essence, and essence contains the will. When kidney qi is deficient, syncope occurs; when excessive, distension arises. Distension refers to bloating; syncope refers to逆行 (reverse flow) surging upward. The foot少阴 meridian descends, and when its qi is insufficient, it follows the冲脉 (Conception Vessel) in reverse, surging upward. Before blood and qi unite, the five viscera are stable, yet the bones and joints twitch. The kidneys correspond to bones, so when pathogenic forces thin the bones, the joints move erratically—or as if something within them were beating like a drum.*

The Yellow Emperor asked: **‘How does one reinforce or reduce excess?’**
Qi Bao replied:
*‘When the will is excessive, reduce it by bleeding the然筋 (likely referring to the blood beneath the然谷, Foot Taiyi-1, the lesser bone)—*[Note: Some texts correct this to然谷下筋, while others suggest a possible error in the original, proposing然骨之前血 instead.]*—or by draining the blood there. If deficient, reinforce the复溜 (Foot Taiyi-2, the lesser bone’s secondary point). *然谷* is the lesser bone’s荣 (nourishing) point, located below the inner ankle’s large bone in a depression; its blood collaterals should be drained by needling three *cun* (same-body inches) deep, retaining the needle for three breaths, or moxibustion for three *zhàng* (units). *复溜* is the foot少阴 meridian’s point, located two *cun* above the inner ankle in a depression; needle three *cun* deep, retain for three breaths, or moxibustion for five *zhàng*.’*

The Yellow Emperor asked: **‘How does one needle when blood and qi have not yet united?’**
Qi Bao replied:
*‘Needle directly at the site of the pathogen—without piercing the meridians—so that the pathogenic force may be expelled. Do not seek fixed points; instead, target where the evil resides. Hence, it is said: *immediately needle the site of the pathogen.*’*

The Yellow Emperor said: **‘Excellent.’**
I have already heard of excess and deficiency in form, but I do not know how they arise.

Qi Bao replied:
*‘When qi and blood unite, yin and yang tilt against each other. Qi becomes disordered in the wei (defensive) layer, and blood flows backward in the meridians. When blood and qi separate, one becomes excessive while the other becomes deficient. Wei qi circulates outside the vessels, so when it is disordered, blood flows backward in the meridians. When blood and qi are disharmonious, one becomes deficient while the other becomes excessive. Blood unites with yin, and qi unites with yang, thus causing fright and madness. When qi unites with yang, excessive yang manifests externally, causing fright and madness. When blood unites with yang and qi unites with yin, it results in艮中 (a condition of stagnation). When qi unites with yin, excessive yang manifests internally, causing热中 (internal heat). *[Note: 贝 here is a variant of 热, meaning "heat."]* When blood unites above and qi unites below, the heart becomes agitated, restless, and prone to anger. When blood unites below and qi unites above, the mind becomes disordered and forgetful. *[Note: 上 refers to the region above the鬲 (stomach), 下 refers to below it.]’*

The Yellow Emperor asked: **‘When blood unites with yin and qi unites with yang, causing blood and qi to separate, which is excess and which is deficiency?’**
Qi Bao replied:
*‘Blood and qi prefer warmth and dislike cold. Cold causes them to congeal and fail to flow, while warmth melts and disperses them. *[Note: 泣 here means to congeal like snow in water, unable to move or disperse.]* Thus, where qi unites, blood becomes deficient; where blood unites, qi becomes deficient. When qi unites with blood, blood is diminished—hence blood deficiency. When blood unites with qi, qi is diminished—hence qi deficiency.’*

The Yellow Emperor said: **‘Humans possess only blood and qi. Yet you say that when blood unites, it is deficiency, and when qi unites, it is also deficiency. Does this mean there is no excess?’**
Qi Bao replied:
*‘What exists is excess; what is absent is deficiency. When qi unites with blood, blood is absent—hence blood deficiency. When blood unites with qi, qi is absent—hence qi deficiency. Thus, when qi unites, there is no blood; when blood unites, there is no qi. Now, when blood and qi separate, it is called deficiency. When qi unites with blood, blood loses its qi; when blood unites with qi, qi loses its blood—hence it is said that blood and qi have separated. The collaterals and minute vessels both feed into the meridians; when blood and qi unite there, it becomes excess. When blood and qi surge upward together, it results in great厥 (syncope), which may cause sudden death. If the qi returns to normal, life is preserved; if it does not, death ensues.’*

The Yellow Emperor asked: **‘By what path does excess arise? By what path does deficiency depart? I wish to understand the essentials of excess and deficiency.’**
Qi Bao replied:
*‘Yin and yang both have their meeting points. When yang is infused into yin and yin overflows externally, yin and yang balance evenly, filling the body. The nine candidates *[Note: 九候, diagnostic pulses]* are harmonized, and such a person is called 平人 (a balanced individual). *[Note: 平人 refers to one in harmonious health.]* The generation of pathogenic forces may arise from yin or from yang. Those arising from yang come from wind, rain, cold, and heat. Those arising from yin come from diet, dwelling, and the emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and fear.’*

The Yellow Emperor asked: **‘How do wind and rain harm a person?’**
Qi Bao replied:
*‘When wind and rain harm a person, they first lodge in the skin and hair, then enter the minute vessels. When the minute vessels are full, the pathogen transmits to the collaterals. When the collaterals are full, it flows into the major meridians. There, blood and qi combine with the pathogen in the muscle layers, causing the pulse to become firm and large—hence, it is called excess. Excess is characterized by external firmness and fullness; pressing it causes pain.’*

The Yellow Emperor asked: **‘How do cold and dampness harm a person?’**
Qi Bao replied:
*‘When cold and dampness invade a person, the skin fails to contract *[Note: Some texts correct 不收 to 收, meaning "contracts," while others interpret 不收 as "insensitive."]* and the muscles become rigid. The nourishing blood congeals, the defensive qi departs, hence it is called deficiency. Deficiency is marked by a slack, insufficient pulse; pressing it warms the area, so it feels comfortable yet painless.’*

The Yellow Emperor asked: **‘What does *né* and *bì* mean?’**
Qi Bao replied:
*‘*Né *refers to wrinkled and slackened. *Bì* refers to slack and loose.’*
[New annotation: According to *Jia-Yi Jing*, it reads *shè-bì*; *Tai Su* also reads *shè-bì*.]

The Yellow Emperor said: **‘Good. How does *yin* generate excess?’**
*‘Excess,’* said Qi Bao, *‘refers to the dominance of pathogenic *qi*.’*
*‘When joy and anger are unregulated, *yin qi* rises in rebellion. When *yin qi* rebels upward, the lower body becomes deficient. When the lower body is deficient, *yang qi* rushes to fill it—thus, it is called excess.’*
[New annotation: According to the *Classic*, it reads: *‘When joy and anger are unregulated, *yin qi* rises in rebellion.’* It is suspected that the word *joy* is redundant.]

The Yellow Emperor asked: **‘How does *yin* generate deficiency?’**
*‘Deficiency,’* said Qi Bao, *‘refers to the depletion of vital essence and *qi*.’*
*‘Joy causes *qi* to descend, sorrow causes *qi* to dissipate. When *qi* dissipates, the pulse becomes hollow and empty. If this is accompanied by cold exposure or improper diet, cold *qi* fills the body, causing blood to congeal and *qi* to depart—thus, it is called deficiency.’*
[New annotation: According to *Jia-Yi Jing*, it reads *‘then the organs are agitated.’*]

The Yellow Emperor said: **‘I have heard the *Classic* say: *yang* deficiency leads to external cold, *yin* deficiency leads to internal heat; *yang* excess leads to external heat, *yin* excess leads to internal cold. I understand these statements, but I do not know their underlying mechanisms.’**
*‘The *Classic* refers to the teachings of antiquity.’* Qi Bao replied:
*‘*Yang* receives *qi* from the upper burner, warming the skin and the spaces between muscles. If cold *qi* lingers externally, the upper burner becomes obstructed. When the upper burner is obstructed, cold *qi* remains trapped outside—thus, one experiences chills.’*
[Chills: trembling from cold.]

The Yellow Emperor asked: **‘How does *yin* deficiency generate internal heat?’**
Qi Bao replied:
*‘When one is overworked and exhausted, the body and *qi* weaken, and the *qi* from food is insufficient. If the upper burner fails to function and the lower burner becomes obstructed, the stomach *qi* grows hot. Hot *qi* fills the chest—thus, internal heat arises.’*
[New annotation: According to *Jia-Yi Jing*, it reads *‘lower burner obstructed.’*]
*‘Excessive exertion leads to fatigue. Heavy labor without proper nourishment causes the *qi* from food to be insufficient.’*

The Yellow Emperor asked: **‘How does *yang* excess generate external heat?’**
Qi Bao replied:
*‘If the upper burner fails to function smoothly, the skin becomes tightly sealed, the interstices close, and the *Xuanfu* [mystic passage] is obstructed.’*
[New annotation: According to *Jia-Yi Jing* and *Tai Su*, the term *Xuanfu* is omitted.]
*‘Defensive *qi* cannot disperse outward—thus, external heat arises. When external cold toxins invade and internally assail the *yang* pathways, if external cold is excessive, the skin contracts, the interstices tighten, and defensive *qi* accumulates without circulation—thus, heat arises externally. When cold *qi* invades externally and *yang qi* resists internally, accumulated fire reverses inward—thus, external heat is generated.’*

The Yellow Emperor asked: **‘How does *yin* excess generate internal cold?’**
Qi Bao replied:
*‘When *jue* [reverse] *qi* rebels upward, cold *qi* accumulates in the chest and does not disperse. If it does not disperse, warm *qi* departs, and cold remains alone—thus, blood congeals and weeps. When it congeals, the pulse becomes obstructed.’*
[New annotation: According to *Jia-Yi Jing*, it reads *‘interstices obstructed.’*]
*‘The pulse becomes full and large yet rough—thus, internal cold arises.’*
[Warm *qi*: *yang qi*.]
*‘When *yin* rebels internally and fills the body, *yang qi* retreats to the exterior of the skin.’*

The Yellow Emperor asked: **‘When *yin* and *yang* are imbalanced, and blood and *qi* are disordered, forming disease—how should one treat it with acupuncture?’**
Qi Bao replied:
*‘When treating this, one must select points along the meridian pathways, drawing blood from the *ying* [nourishing] network and *qi* from the *wei* [defensive] network. One must measure the body’s form—adjusting for the seasons, varying in depth and angle.’*
[The *ying* network governs blood, which is *yin qi*. The *wei* network governs *qi*, which is *yang qi*.]
*‘The method of needle insertion requires first knowing the length and breadth of the body’s form, measuring according to the *San Bei* [Three Preparations] method to calculate proportions for the body, thus applying the divisions of *cun*. Hence, it is said: *use the body’s form.* The variations for the four seasons are detailed in the following section.’*

The Yellow Emperor asked: **‘When blood and *qi* are disordered, forming disease, and *yin* and *yang* are imbalanced—how should one supplement and drain?’**
Qi Bao replied:
*‘To drain excess, when *qi* is盛, insert the needle inward. The needle and *qi* enter together, opening its pathway like unlocking a door. When the needle and *qi* exit together, vital essence is unharmed, pathogenic *qi* descends, and the external pathway remains unsealed to expel the disease. Shake the needle vigorously to widen the channel—like clearing a road. This is called *great drainage*. It must be done decisively and swiftly—thus, the great pathogenic *qi* is subdued.’*
[Speaking of opening the orifice to release *qi*.]
[Decisive: swift. Speaking of swiftly withdrawing the needle.]
*The *Zhen Jing Lun* [Needle Classic Theory] says: *‘Swift insertion followed by slow withdrawal leads to deficiency—swiftly withdraw the needle and slowly press.’*
[Great *qi*: great pathogenic *qi*.]
[Subdued: retreated and bent.]

The Yellow Emperor asked: **‘How does one supplement deficiency?’**
Qi Bao replied:
*‘Hold the needle firmly without hesitation, steadying your intent. Wait for exhalation, then insert the needle. When *qi* emerges, the needle enters. When the needle is in place and the surroundings are sealed, vital essence cannot escape. Only then, firmly and swiftly withdraw the needle. When *qi* enters and the needle exits, heat cannot return. Seal the pathway, disperse the pathogenic *qi*, and vital essence is preserved. Move the needle according to the timing—*
[New annotation: According to *Jia-Yi Jing*, it reads *‘without delay.’*]
*—then there will be no disease.’*
[No disease: no ailment.]

*‘For those who practice acupuncture incorrectly—needling the collateral vessels—if pain is on the left, needle the right, and if pain is on the right, needle the left. If pain is on the left but the right pulse is diseased, use *ju* needling.’*
[*Ju* needling: needling the main meridian.]
*‘If pain is on the left, needle the right collateral vessel; if pain is on the right, needle the left collateral vessel. One must carefully examine the nine diagnostic regions—then the needle method is complete.’*

**Miu Ci Lun (Treatise on Miu Needling)**

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"I have heard of **miu ci** (乱刺), but I do not grasp its meaning. What is **miu ci**?"*

**Miu ci** refers to the acupuncture points used—where the needling must correspond like the **fǎnmiù** (纰缪) of threads in a loom, maintaining order.

Qibo replied:
*"When pathogenic forces invade the body, they first lodge in the **skin and fur**, and if they linger without leaving, they enter and lodge in the **minute collaterals (孙脉)**, and if they linger without leaving, they enter and lodge in the **network vessels (络脉)**, and if they linger without leaving, they penetrate into the **main meridians (经脉)**, internally connecting to the **five zang organs (五藏)**, dispersing through the **intestines and stomach**, affecting both **yin and yang**, and thus injuring the five zang. This is the progression of pathogenic forces entering from the skin and fur and reaching the five zang in sequence.

In such cases, one treats the **main meridians**.

But if pathogenic forces lodge in the **skin and fur**, enter and settle in the **minute and network vessels**, and linger without leaving, blocking and obstructing the flow so that they cannot enter the main meridians, they overflow into the **major network vessels (大络)**, giving rise to **strange diseases**.

When disease is in the **blood network vessels (血络)**, it is called **strange pathogenic forces (奇邪)**."*

**[New Verification Note: According to Quan Yuanqi, *‘大络’* refers to the *‘fifteen network vessels (十五络)’*.]**

*"When pathogenic forces lodge in the **major network vessels**, they may flow from left to right, or right to left, or move upward and downward, intersecting with the main meridians while spreading to the **four extremities**, their **qi** having no fixed location and not entering the **meridian points (经俞)**—this is called **miu ci**.*

*The **four extremities** refer to the **four limbs (四支)**."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"I wish to hear how **miu ci** works—when one treats the left by needling the right, and the right by needling the left. How does this differ from **jù ci (巨刺)**?"*

Qibo replied:
*"When pathogenic forces lodge in the **main meridians**, if the left is excessive, the right will be diseased, and if the right is excessive, the left will be diseased. There are also cases where the condition shifts.*

**[New Verification Note: According to the *Jia-Yi Jing*, it reads *‘disease shifts and moves (病易且移)’*.]**

*If pain persists on the left while the right pulse is already diseased, then one must use **jù ci**, needling directly into the **main meridian**—this is not the network vessels.*

*‘The one that is first diseased’ means that while the original pain has not yet ceased, the other side becomes diseased in succession.*

*Thus, when the **network vessels** are diseased, the pain corresponds to where the **network vessels intersect with the main meridians**, hence the term **miu ci**.*

*The **network vessels** refer to the **branching collaterals of the main meridians**, not the **separate meridians (正别)**—they also include the **public-sun (公孙)** and **feiyang (飞扬)** collateral branches and others.*

**[New Verification Note: According to Wang Shi, *‘non-separate meridians’*—but in this treatise, when pathogenic forces lodge in the **foot Taiyin network vessel (足太阴络)**, they cause lumbar pain, radiating from the **spleen (牌)** and merging with the **Yangming meridian**, ascending to the **network vessel of the throat (哑)**, piercing the **tongue’s center**—this is the **foot Taiyin’s proper meridian**, also a **combined vessel (兼脉)**. How can it be said to be *‘non-separate’*?"*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"I wish to hear how **miu ci** is performed. How should the points be selected?"*

Qi Bó said:
*"When pathogenic forces lodge in the **foot Shaoyin network vessel (足少阴络)**, they cause sudden heart pain and violent distension, with the chest and ribs radiating outward and full. For its **collateral branches (别络)**, they follow the proper meridian from the **kidney (肾)**, ascending to pierce the **liver’s gate (肝鬲)**, coursing through the **heart’s envelope (心包)**, hence the disease manifests thus. If there is no stagnation, needle **Rán Gǔ (然谷)**, the point before **Rán Gǔ (然骨)**, to draw blood—like after a meal—will suffice. **Rán Gǔ (然谷)** lies on the medial ankle, where the **great bone (大骨)** is depressed inward, the **foot Shaoyin’s flourishing vessel (足少阴荣)**. The needle may penetrate **three-fen of a body-cun (同身寸)**, leaving it for three breaths. If moxibustion is used, apply **three moxa cones (三壮)**. Needling here often draws blood, inducing immediate hunger. If the pain persists, take the right side for left-sided pain and vice versa—this follows the general rule. For a newly arising disease, five days of treatment suffice. If the disease has long existed but now flares anew, needle it five days first, then it shall be cured.

When pathogenic forces lodge in the **hand Shaoyang network vessel (手少阳络)**, they cause throat constriction and tongue rolling, dry mouth and restlessness of the heart, pain along the outer arm, and inability for the hand to reach the head. For its **meridian path (脉)**, it follows the hand’s outer surface, emerges along the outer arm, enters the **shoulder’s hollow (缺盆)**, spreads through the **axilla (擅中)**, and disperses into the **heart’s envelope network vessel (心包散络)**. Its **branching collaterals (支)**, from the **breast’s center (膻中)**, ascend to emerge above the **shoulder’s hollow (缺盆)**, then to the **nape (项)**, while the **heart governs the tongue (心主其舌)**, hence the disease manifests thus. Needle the **second finger’s nail (次指爪甲)**, one **fen** from the tip, on both hands—this is **Guān Chōng (关冲)**, the **well point (井)** of **Shaoyang**. The needle may penetrate **one-fen of a body-cun (同身寸)**, leaving it for three breaths. If moxibustion is used, apply **three moxa cones (三壮)**. Both hands are needled, hence ‘each one fen.’ **Fen (痏)** means *‘sore’* or *‘wound.’*
**[New Verification Note: According to *Jia Yi Jing (甲乙经)*, the **Guān Chōng (关冲)** point emerges from the tip of the **second finger (次指)**, not the **middle finger (中指)**—this is an error. The effect is immediate for the young, but may take some time for the elderly. For left-sided pain, take the right side, and vice versa—this applies to new diseases lasting several days.]*"

When **evil qi** lodges in the **Jueyin (足厥阴)** sinews,
it causes sudden **testicular torsion (卒疝)** with violent pain.
For its sinews lie five **body-cun (同身寸)** above the **inner ankle (内踝)**,
branching off toward **Shaoyang (少阳)**.
Its divergent branches ascend along the meridian to the **testicles (睪)**, knotting at the **penis (茎)**—
thus causing sudden **testicular torsion (卒疝)** with violent pain.
**[Testicles (睪)]** are the **Nine Yin (阴九)**.

Needle the **nail of the big toe (足大指爪甲)** where it meets the flesh,
one **fen (瘠)** on each side—
this is the **Dàdūn (大敦)** point, the **well (井)** of **Jueyin (足厥阴)**,
located at the tip of the big toe, one **fen** from the nail corner (like a **scallion leaf**).
The needle may penetrate **three-fen of a body-cun (同身寸之三分)**, left for ten breaths.
If moxibustion is used, apply **three moxa cones (三壮)**.
Men recover immediately; women may take some time.
Needle the opposite side for left or right pain.

When **evil qi** lodges in the **Taiyang (足太阳)** sinews,
it causes **head, nape, and shoulder pain (头项肩痛)**.
For its direct channel descends from the brain and branches at the nape;
its divergent branches descend from the inner arm, splitting left and right.
Again, its sinews ascend from the **foot (足#2)** along the back to the head—
thus causing **head, nape, and shoulder pain**.

**[New Verification Note: According to *Jia Yi Jing (甲乙经)*:
Its divergent branch enters the **brain (脑)** from the **vertex (巅)**, then descends, branching at the nape.
Master Wang says the *‘direct channel’* should read *‘divergent branch’* (支).]**

Needle the **nail of the little toe (足小指爪甲)** where it meets the flesh,
one **fen (瘠)** on each side—this is the **Zhìyīn (至阴)** point, the **well (井)** of **Taiyang (足太阳)**.
The needle may penetrate **one-fen of a body-cun (同身寸之一分)**, left for five breaths.
If moxibustion is used, apply **three moxa cones (三壮)**.
**[New Verification Note: According to *Jia Yi Jing (甲乙经)*:
This point lies on the **outer side of the little toe (足小指外侧)**, one **fen** from the nail corner (like a **scallion leaf**).]**
If ineffective, needle **three-fen below the outer ankle (外踝下三瘠)**,
left or right as needed—recovery follows in the time it takes to eat a meal.
This is the **Jīnmén (金门)** point, the **post station (邮)** of **Taiyang (足太阳)**,
located below the outer ankle.
The needle may penetrate **three-fen of a body-cun (同身寸之三分)**.
If moxibustion is used, apply **three moxa cones (三壮)**.

When **evil qi** lodges in the **Yangming (手阳明)** sinews,
it causes **chest distension (气满胸中)**, **shortness of breath (喘息)**, **rib pain (支胱)**, and **chest heat (胸中热)**.
For its channel enters the **suprasternal fossa (缺盆)** from the shoulder tip,
and its sinews diverge—
its branching paths ascend straight from the **suprasternal fossa (缺盆)** to the neck—
thus the disease manifests thus.

Needle the **nail of the index finger (手大指次指爪甲)** one **fen (瘠)** from the tip (like a **scallion leaf**) on each side,
left or right as needed—recovery follows in the time it takes to eat a meal.
This is the **Shāngyáng (商阳)** point, the **well (井)** of **Yangming (手阳明)**.
The needle may penetrate **one-fen of a body-cun (同身寸之一分)**, left for one breath.
If moxibustion is used, apply **one moxa cone (一壮)**.
**[New Verification Note: According to *Jia Yi Jing (甲乙经)*:
**Shāngyáng (商阳)** lies on the **inner side of the index finger (手大指次指内侧)**, one **fen** from the nail corner (like a **scallion leaf**).]**

When **evil qi** lodges between the **arm and palm (臂掌之间)**,
rendering flexion impossible,
needle behind the **wrist (踝)**.
**[New Verification Note: According to Quán Yuánqǐ’s original text:
This is the **root joint of the hand (手之本节踝)**.]
First press with the fingers until pain is found, then needle.
Use the **lunar waxing-waning cycle (月死生)** for dosage:
One **fen (痏)** per day during the waxing phase (1–15 days),
then decreasing by one **fen** per day after the 15th.
Days 1–15 are the **waxing (生)** phase; days 16 onward are the **waning (死)** phase—
the effect varies with **deficiency and excess (亏满)**.

When **evil qi** lodges in the **Yangjiao (足阳娇)** meridian,
it causes **eye pain beginning from the inner canthus (目痛从内毗始)**.
For its meridian arises at the foot, ascending to the head and connecting to the **inner canthus (目内毗)**—
thus the disease begins with **eye pain from the inner canthus**.

How is this known?
The *Eighty-One Difficult Questions (八十一难经)* states:
*The **Yangtā (阳踏)** meridian arises from the **heel (跟中)**, ascends along the outer ankle, and enters **Fēngchí (风池)**.*
The *Needle Classic (针经)* states:
*The **Yīnjī (阴跻)** meridian enters the **nasal cavity (鼾)** and connects to the **inner canthus (目内毗)**,
merging with **Taiyang’s Yangtā (太阳阳踏)** to ascend.*

Thus, it reaches the **inner canthus (目内毗)**.

Needle **two-fen below the outer ankle (外踝之下半寸)** on each side—
this is the **Shēnmài (申脉)** point, where **Yangtā (阳踏)** originates,
located in the **hollow below the outer ankle (外踝下陷者中)**, fitting a **nail (容爪甲)**.
The needle may penetrate **three-fen of a body-cun (同身寸之三分)**, left for six breaths.
If moxibustion is used, apply **three moxa cones (三壮)**.
**[New Verification Note: According to the *Needling Lumbar Pain (刺腰痛)* annotation:
This point lies **five-fen below the outer ankle (外踝下五分)**.]**
Needle the opposite side for left or right pain—recovery follows in the time it takes to walk ten *li*.

If a person has **fallen and suffered internal blood stagnation (恶血留内)**,
causing **abdominal distension (腹中满胀)** and inability to **defecate or urinate (不得前后)**,
first administer **purgative herbs (利药)**.
This injures the **Jueyin (厥阴)** meridian above and the **Shaoyin (少阴)** sinews below.
Needle **below the inner ankle (足内踝之下)**, where the **blood vessels emerge before the bone (然骨之前血脉出血)**—
this is the **Shaoyin (少阴)** sinew.
**[New Verification Note: The *‘blood vessels’* (血脉) may be a miswriting for *‘sinews’* (络).]**
Needle the **pulsating artery on the medial malleolus (足驸上动脉)**—
this is the **Chōngyáng (冲阳)** point, the **source (原)** of the **stomach (胃)**.
The needle may penetrate **three-fen of a body-cun (同身寸之三分)**, left for ten breaths.
If moxibustion is used, apply **three moxa cones (三壮)**.
It treats **abdominal distension with loss of appetite (腹大不嗜食)**.
Since the **abdomen is distended (腹胀满)**, this point is selected.
If ineffective, needle **one-fen above the big toe’s hairline (三毛上各一痏)**—
bleeding brings immediate relief.
Needle the opposite side for left or right pain.
This is the **Dàdūn (大敦)** point, the **well (井)** of **Jueyin (厥阴)**.

For those who **weep excessively (善悲)**, are **easily startled (惊)**, and **discontent (不乐)**,
needle as described above.

When **evil qi** lodges in the **Yangming (手阳明)** sinews,
it causes **deafness (耳聋)**, with intermittent inability to hear sounds.
For its divergent branch ascends from the **suprasternal fossa (缺盆)** to the neck, piercing the **cheek (颊)**,
and its sinews’ divergent paths enter the **ear**, converging at the **central vessel (宗脉)**—
thus the disease causes **intermittent deafness (耳聋时不闻声)**.

Needle the **nail of the index finger (手大指次指爪甲)** one **fen (瘠)** from the tip (like a **scallion leaf**) on each side—
hearing is immediately restored.
This is the same as the **Shāngyáng (商阳)** point above.
If ineffective, needle the **nail of the middle finger (中指爪甲)** where it meets the flesh—
hearing is immediately restored.
This is the **Zhōngchōng (中冲)** point, the **well (井)** of the **Heart (手心主)**,
located at the tip of the middle finger, one **fen** from the nail (in the **hollow like a scallion leaf**).
The needle may penetrate **one-fen of a body-cun (同身寸之一分)**, left for three breaths.
If moxibustion is used, apply **three moxa cones (三壮)**.

The ancient texts are missing their passages, leaving no **collateral vessels (络)** to trace.
Perhaps it refers to needling the **little finger’s nail (小指爪甲)**, where it meets the flesh.
How do we know?
The following text states: *"The collateral of the **Hand Lesser Yin (手少阴)** converges in the ear."*

If the little finger’s tip is called **Lesser Surge (少冲)**, the **well (井)** of **Hand Lesser Yin (手少阴)**, then needling it may penetrate **one fen**, left for **one breath**; if moxibustion is used, **one cone (一壮)** suffices.

---
**Newly corrected text states:**
According to Wang’s commentary, it is likely the **Lesser Surge (少冲)** point on the little finger’s nail.
Referring to the *Jia-Yi Jing (甲乙经)*:
*"The proper channel of **Hand Heart (手心主)** ascends along the throat, exits behind the ear, and merges below **Lesser Yang’s Complete Bone (少阳完骨)**.
Thus, why would one needle **Middle Surge (中冲)** instead of suspecting **Lesser Surge (少冲)**?
For cases of **intermittent deafness (不时闻)**, needling is forbidden.
If **intermittent deafness** occurs, the **collateral qi (络气)** has already severed—needling is thus prohibited.
For **wind in the ear (耳中生风)**, needling follows the same method:
Left ear treated with right needle, right ear treated with left.

For **numbness (痹)** wandering without fixed location—
painful in the **flesh divisions (分肉间)**, needle accordingly.
The **monthly death-and-life count (月死生)** determines the **fen (痏)** dosage.
For those using needles, adjust based on **qi’s ebb and flow (气盛衰)**.
Exceeding the daily count **dissipates qi (脱气)**; falling short **fails to release qi (气不写)**.
Left-side treatment with right needle, right-side with left—
when the disease ceases, stop.
If unresolved, repeat as prescribed.

Why regulate the **monthly death-and-life count (月死生)**?
To align with **qi’s ebb and flow (气盛衰)**.
On the **first day of the month**, use **one fen (一痏)**;
the **second day**, **two fen (二痏)**—gradually increasing to **fifteen fen (十五痏)** by the **fifteenth day**.
From the **sixteenth day**, decrease by **one fen daily**—
thus avoiding excess or deficiency.

When **evil (邪)** lodges in the **Foot Greater Yang (足阳明)** channel,
it causes **upper teeth (凯钮上齿)** to feel cold,
for its pulse arises from the **nasal intersection (鼻交类中)**, descends along the **outer nose (鼻外)**,
enters the **upper teeth (上齿中)**, then exits beside the mouth, encircling the lips.
It descends to meet **Receiving Saliva (承浆)**, then reverses along the **jaw’s posterior (颐后下康)**,
exits at **Great Welcome (大迎)**, follows **Cheek Cart (颊车)**, and ascends before the ear—
thus causing **cold in the upper teeth (凯蛆上齿)**.

Since its pulse **crosses left and right on the face (左右交於面部)**,
the channel’s ailments clarify **analogous regions (缪处之类)**—
hence the following text states:

---
**Newly corrected text states:**
According to Quan Yuanqi’s edition and the *Jia-Yi Jing (甲乙经)*,
the **Foot Greater Yang (足阳明)** should read as **collateral (络)**.
Needle the **second toe’s nail (足中指次指爪甲)** where it meets the flesh—**one fen (一痏)** each.
Left-side treatment with right needle, right-side with left.
*"Middle (中)"* should read *"Great (大)"*—a transcription error for *"middle-great (中大)"*.
According to the *Lingshu Jing (灵枢经)* and *Kongxue Tujing (孔穴图经)*,
there is no point on the **middle toe’s second finger’s nail (中指次指爪甲)**—
it should specify the **second toe of the great toe (大指次指)**, the **Severity Return (厉兑)** point,
the **well (井)** of **Foot Greater Yang (阳明)**.
**Severity Return (厉兑)** may be needled to **one body-cun (同身寸之一分)**, left for **one breath**,
or moxibusted with **three cones (三壮)**.

---
**Newly corrected text states:**
The *Jia-Yi Jing (甲乙经)* states: *"Needle the foot’s middle finger’s nail (足中指爪甲)"*—
omitting *"second (次指)"*.
This aligns with Wang’s interpretation, treating the **great toe’s second toe as the middle toe (大指次指为中指)**.
The following text refers to the **Foot Greater Yang’s middle finger’s nail (足阳明中指爪甲)**—
this is the same point.
**Severity Return (厉兑)** lies at the **great toe’s second toe’s tip (足大指次指之端)**,
**one fen (如韭叶)** from the nail’s corner.

When **evil (邪)** lodges in the **Foot Lesser Yang collateral (足少阳之络)**,
it causes **rib pain (胁痛)** with **inability to breathe (不得息)**, **coughing**, and **sweating**,
for its **branch-diverging pulse (支别者)** descends from **Eye’s Return (目兑)** below **Great Welcome (大迎)**,
merges with **Hand Lesser Yang (手少阳)** at the **temple (颁)**,
descends to **Cheek Cart (颊车)**, then the **neck**, meeting **Sternum Hollow (缺盆)**.
It proceeds to the **chest**, pierces the **diaphragm (鬲)**, entwines the **liver (络肝)**, and connects to the **gallbladder (属胆)**,
circulating along the **ribs (循胁)**—
thus causing **rib pain (胁痛)**, **coughing**, and **sweating**. *(Previously: 颌, pronounced as *jiè* in the sixth tone.)*

Needle the **upper phalanx of the Foot Lesser Yang (足小指次指) nail**, where it meets the flesh, at **one fen (一分)** each—
this is the **Cavity Yin (窍阴)** acupuncture point, the **well (井)** of the Foot Lesser Yang collateral.
Needling can penetrate **one cùn of the same body’s depth (同身寸之一分)**, with a retention of **one breath (一呼)**.
If cauterized (**灸**), apply **three moxa cones (三壮)**.

**Newly corrected reading states:**
According to the *Jiā-Yǐ Jīng (甲乙经)*:
Cavity Yin (**窍阴**) is at the tip of the Foot Lesser Yang’s second toe (**足小指次指之端**),
**one fen (如韭叶)** from the nail’s corner.

If **inability to breathe (不得息)** persists, it stops upon needling.
If **sweating (汗出)** occurs, it ceases immediately upon needling.
If **coughing (咳)** persists, the patient should wear warm clothing and eat warm foods (**温衣饮食**),
and it will resolve within **one day (一日)**.
Needle the **right (左)** for the **left (右)**, and the **left (右)** for the **right (左)**—
the disease will stop immediately.
If it does not stop, repeat the needling as prescribed.

When **evil (邪)** lodges in the **Foot Lesser Yin collateral (足少阴之络)**,
it causes **throat pain (嗑痛)** such that the patient **cannot swallow (不可内食)**,
and **unreasonable anger (无故善怒)**.
The **qi (气)** ascends and moves toward **Noble Upper (贲上)**—
for its **branch-diverging pulse (经支别者)** emerges from the **lung (肺)**, entwines the **heart (络心)**, and flows into the **chest (注胸中)**;
its **main channel (正经)** ascends from the **kidney (肾)**, pierces the **liver (贯肝鬲)**, and enters the **lung (入肺中)**,
circulating along the **throat (循喉咙)**, beside the **root of the tongue (侠舌本)**—
thus causing **throat pain (嗑痛)**, **inability to swallow (不可内食)**, and **unreasonable anger (无故善怒)**,
as the **qi (气)** ascends and moves toward **Noble Upper (贲上)**.
*Noble (贵)** is the place where **qi (气)** rushes upward.

**Newly corrected reading states:**
Upon examining **Master Wang’s (王注)** annotation that *Noble Upper (贵上)* refers to *qi (气)* rushing upward is incorrect.
According to the *Nán Jīng (难经)*, the **stomach (胃)** is called *Noble Gate (贵门)*.
**Yang Cāo (杨操)** states: *Noble (贵)* means **diaphragm (鬲)**.
Thus, the **qi (气)** ascends and moves toward the **diaphragm (鬲上)**.
The text already states that the **qi (气)** ascends and moves—
how could *Noble (贵)* further be interpreted as the place where **qi (气)** rushes upward?

Needle the **central pulse of the sole (足下中央之脉)** at **three fen (三分)** each,
a total of **six needlings (凡六刺)**—
the disease will stop immediately.
Needle the **right (左)** for the **left (右)**, and the **left (右)** for the **right (左)**—
this refers to the **Gushing Spring (涌泉)** acupuncture point, the **well (井)** of the Foot Lesser Yin collateral,
located in the **sole’s depression (足心陷者中)**.
When the foot is **flexed (屈足)**, the toes are **curled (蜷指)**, and the needling is applied in the **midpoint (宛宛中)**.
Needling can penetrate **three fen of the same body’s depth (同身寸之三分)**,
with a retention of **three breaths (三呼)**.
If cauterized (**灸**), apply **three moxa cones (三壮)**.

If the **throat is swollen (哑中肿)** and the patient **cannot swallow saliva (不能内唾)**,
or **cannot spit (时不能出唾)**,
needle **one fen (一分)** before **Ran Bone (然骨)** and let blood flow (**出血**)—
the disease will stop immediately.
Needle the **right (左)** for the **left (右)**, and the **left (右)** for the **right (左)**—
this is also the **Foot Lesser Yin collateral (足少阴之络)**,
for its **collateral (络)** runs alongside the **main channel (大经)** of the throat (**喉咙**)—
thus the needling method.

The following **twenty-nine characters (此二十九字)**,
were originally misplaced in the section:
*"In the case of evil lodging in the Hand and Foot Lesser Yin and Greater Yin, and Foot Yang Brightness collaterals (邪客手足少阴太阴足阳明之络前),*
*they are now relocated here."*

**Newly corrected reading states:**
Upon examining **Master Wang’s (王注)** annotation that the **collateral (络)** and **main channel (大经)** of the throat (**喉咙**) are interchangeable is incorrect.
According to the *Jiā-Yǐ Jīng (甲乙经)*:
The **Foot Lesser Yin collateral (足少阴之络)** runs alongside the **main channel (经)** of the **Heart Envelope (心包)** and **Foot Lesser Yin (少阴)**,
circulating along the **throat (喉咙)**.
**Master Wang’s (王氏)** annotation interchanges the **main channel (经)** and **collateral (络)**—
the *Jiā-Yǐ Jīng (甲乙经)* should be considered the correct reference.

When **evil (邪)** lodges in the **Foot Greater Yin collateral (足太阴之络)**,
it causes **lumbar pain (腰痛)**, drawing **lower abdomen (引少腹)** and **controlling silk (控纱)**,
such that the patient **cannot breathe while lying supine (不可以仰息)**.

The **Foot Greater Yin collateral (足太阴之络)**,
from [missing character] merges with **Yang Brightness (阳明)**,
ascends through the **spine (尸骨中)**, and joins **Jué Yin (厥阴)** and **Lesser Yang (少阳)** at the **lower spine (下髅)**,
then circulates along the **spine’s interior (尸骨内)** and enters the **abdomen (入腹)**,
entwining the **throat (络哑)**, piercing the **tongue (贯舌中)**—
thus **lumbar pain (腰痛)** draws the **lower abdomen (少腹)**, and **controls silk (控)** at the **sautéed (炒)** region.
*Sautéed (炒)* refers to the **soft space below the lower ribs (季胁下之空软处)**.
When the **collateral (络)** is struck by **evil qi (邪气)**, it becomes **constricted and tense (拘急)**,
so the patient **cannot extend the back while breathing (不可以仰伸而喘息)**.
The *Needle for Lumbar Pain (刺腰痛篇)* section does not mention the word *breathe (息)*.

**Newly corrected reading states:**
Upon examining **Master Wang’s (王注)** annotation that the **Foot Greater Yin collateral (足太阴之络)**,
according to the *Jiā-Yǐ Jīng (甲乙经)*, is actually the **main channel (正)** of the Foot Greater Yin,
not the **collateral (络)**.
**Master Wang’s (王氏)** claim that it is the **collateral (络)** lacks clarity in its intent.
The needling method for **lumbar pain (腰痛)** and **loin’s resolution (尻之解)**,
above the **two depressions (两解)**—
this is the **Lumbar Support (腰俞)** point, using the **moon’s life and death (月死生)** as the number of treatments (**疮数**).
Insert the needle and the disease will stop immediately.
Needle the **right (左)** for the **left (右)**, and the **left (右)** for the **right (左)**—
*Lumbar Support (腰俞)* is located at the **loin’s depression (腰尻骨问)**.
The **Newly corrected reading states:** According to the *Qì Fǔ Lùn (气府论)* annotation, it reads **two fen (二分)**;
the *Needle for Heat (刺热论)* annotation reads **two fen (二分)**;
the *Water Orifices (水穴篇)* annotation reads **two fen (二分)**;
the *Heat Orifices (热穴篇)* annotation reads **three fen (三寸)**;
the *Jiā-Yǐ Jīng (甲乙经)* reads **two cùn (二寸)**.
Retain the needle for **seven breaths (七呼)**,
*with the method (注) being the same as the main channel (经)*.

The *Central Admonition of the Acupuncture Points (中诰孔穴经)* states:
*"Take the right (左) for the left (右), and take the left (右) for the right (左),*
*the acupuncture point should be central (穴当中),*
*it should not be done as such."*

Below the **loin (次腰)**, beside the **spine (侠尸)**, there are **four hollows (有骨空)** each,
all governing **lumbar pain (腰痛)**.
The **lower spine (下髅)** method is the same as for the main channel (**注与经同**)—
this is where the **Foot Greater Yin (足太阴)**, **Jué Yin (厥阴)**, and **Lesser Yang (少阳)** collaterals converge (**所结**).
Needling can penetrate **two fen of the same body’s depth (同身寸之二寸)**,
with a retention of **ten breaths (十呼)**.
If cauterized (**灸**), apply **three moxa cones (三壮)**.
*Swollen (肿)* refers to **both depressions being swollen (两解肿)**.
Both **Lumbar Support (腰俞)** and **Hip Joint (髁伸)** should be treated.

**Newly corrected reading states:**
This section on **evil lodging in the Foot Greater Yin collateral (足太阴之络)**,
along with its needling method (**刺法**), has already been detailed in the *Needle for Lumbar Pain (刺腰痛篇)* section,
where the annotation is thorough.
This section merely adds the phrase **Lumbar Support (腰俞)**.

Upon examining the **original text by Quán Yuánqǐ (全元起)**, it lacks the phrase **Lumbar Support (腰俞)**.
**Master Wang (王氏)** knew that **Lumbar Support (腰俞)** does not require **right-left needling (左右取)**,
and thus annotated it, yet he was unaware that the original lacked it.

When **evil (邪)** lodges in the **Foot Yang Brightness collateral (足太阳之络)**,
it causes **constricted and tense (拘孪)** back and **urgent (背急)** pain,
drawing the **ribs (引胁)** and causing **pain (而痛)**—
for its **main channel (经)** descends from the **inner arm (膊内)**,
**branch-diverging (左右别)** downward, piercing the **swelling (贯肿)**,
and merging at **Geng Middle (蝈中)**—
thus the disease causes **constricted and tense (拘孪)** back and **urgent (背急)** pain,
drawing the **ribs (引胁)** and causing **pain (而痛)**.

**Newly corrected reading states:**
According to the original text by **Quán Yuánqǐ (全元起)** and the *Jiā-Yǐ Jīng (甲乙经)*,
the phrase *"drawing the ribs (引胁而痛)"* is followed by *"further drawing the heart and causing pain (内引心而痛)"*.
Needle from the **nape (项)** and count the **vertebrae (脊椎)** beside the **spine (侠脊)**.
When pressing quickly (**疾按**), the **painful response (应手)** should be like the **pain (如痛)**.
Needle beside the **three depressions (傍三痏)** and the disease will stop immediately.
*Counting from the nape (从项始数脊椎)* refers to counting from **Great Hammer (大椎)**,
until the **second vertebra (第二椎)** beside it—
each **one fen and five lǐ (一寸五分)** of the **same body’s depth (同身寸)**.
Press inward beside the **spine’s two sides (脊两傍)**, and if there is **painful response (痛应手)**,
the location of the **evil (邪)** is found.
Adjust the depth of needling according to the **painful response (随痛应手深浅)**,
then apply the needling accordingly.
Since the **evil (邪)** lodges beside the **spine (脊骨两傍)**,
the needling is applied beside it (**故言刺之傍也**).

When **evil (邪)** lodges in the **foot Shaoyang (少阳) channel’s collateral (络)**, it causes lingering pain at the **Huo (枢)**.
The patient **cannot lift the leg (不可举)**, for this channel’s **qi (气)** emerges at **Qijie (气街)**, encircles the **hairline (髦际)**, and horizontally enters the **Yan (厌)**.
Thus, pain lingers at the **Huo (枢)**, and afterward, though the pain subsides, the leg **cannot be lifted (不可举)**.
The **Huo (枢)** refers to the **Huo joint (枢)**.

Needle the **Huo (枢)** with a **hair-thin needle (毫针)**.
If the condition is **cold (寒)**, retain the needle for a long time, counting by the **lunar phases (月死生)** until recovery is achieved—**immediate cure (立已)**.

Behind the **Huo (枢)** lies the **Huantiao (环跳)** point, located directly behind the **Huo (枢)**.
Thus, it is said: *"Needle behind the **Huo (枢)**."*

The **Huantiao (环跳)** is where the **foot Shaoyang channel’s qi (脉气)** manifests.
Needling may penetrate to **one cun and five fen (同身寸之一寸)**.
Retain the needle for **two breaths (二#13呼)**.
If **moxibustion (灸)** is applied, use **three cones (三壮)**.

The **hair-thin needle (毫针)** refers to the **seventh needle (第七针)**.

---
*The **newly corrected text** states: According to the *Jia-Yi Jing (甲乙经)*, **Huantiao (环跳)** lies within the **Panghuo (胖枢)**, and the *Qi-Xue Lun (气穴论)* states it is between the **two Yan (两厌)**.
This passage says to needle the **Huo (枢)**, but Wang [commentator] mistakenly claimed *"needle behind the **Huo (枢)**"*—this is incorrect.

For treating all channels, if the **pathway (所过)** shows no disease, then the needling was **misplaced (缪刺)**.
This is the **correct statement (正言也)**.*

If the **channel (经)** shows no disease, then the **evil (邪)** resides in the **network vessels (络)**, hence the **misplaced needling (缪刺)**.

If the **pathway of the channel (经所过)** exhibits disease, then it is the **channel itself that is diseased**, and **misplaced needling should not be applied**.

For **deafness (耳聋)**, needle the **Hand Greater Yang channel (手阳明)**.
If ineffective, needle the **channel’s branch that emerges before the ear (通脉出耳前者)**.

The **Hand Greater Yang channel** refers to the **space between the second and third fingers of the hand**, resembling **leek leaves**—this is called **Shangyang (商阳)**.

According to the *Zhonggong Kongxue Tujing (中诰孔穴图经)*, the **Hand Greater Yang channel** includes the **four points—Shangyang (商阳), Hegu (合谷), Yangxi (阳溪), and Pianli (偏历)**—all of which govern **deafness**.
The **current text** specifies needling **Shangyang (商阳)** before the ear, not these **Hegu (合谷)** and the others.

The **branch channel before the ear (耳前通脉)**, belonging to the **Hand Greater Yang channel**, lies precisely at the **ear’s auditory aperture (听会)**. Needling may penetrate **four fen of the body’s cun (同身寸之四分)**. If moxibustion is applied, use **three cones (三壮)**.

For **tooth decay (齿齲)**, needle the **Hand Greater Yang channel**.
If ineffective, needle the **branch where its channel enters the teeth (脉入齿中者)**, and it will **instantly resolve**.

According to the *Jia-Yi Jing (甲乙)* and *Liu#15 Zhu Tujing (流#15注图经)*, the **Hand Greater Yang channel** includes the **seven points—Shangyang (商阳), Erwen (二问), Sanwen (三问), Hegu (合谷), Yangxi (阳溪), Pianli (偏历), and Wenliu (温留)**—all of which govern **toothache**.
The **Hand Greater Yang channel** passes through the cheek and enters the **lower teeth**, while the **Foot Greater Yang channel** follows the outer nose and enters the **upper teeth**.

*(齲, pronounced as in "qiū yǔ" cut)*

When **evil** lodges in the **interstices of the five Zàng (五藏之问)**, its affliction manifests as **pulsing pain that comes and goes in time**. Observe the disease: if the **pathway** is **erratic (缪)**, needle it at the **hand or foot nails (手足爪甲上)**.

Needle each at its **Jǐng (井)** point—**right side for left-sided ailments, left side for right-sided ailments**. Examine the **pulse (脉)**, and let **its blood (脉血)** flow; one needling per day. If one needling fails to resolve it, **five needlings will suffice**. If there is **blood in the pulse**, then needle it thus in this manner.

If the **erratic pathway** spreads and draws **upward to the teeth (上齿)**, causing **cold, painful lips and teeth (齿唇寒痛)**, observe the **hand’s dorsal pulse with blood (手背脉血者)** and remove it. If the disease **spreads erratically (缪传)** and draws upward to the teeth, with **cold, painful lips and teeth (齿唇寒痛)**, needle the **Hand Greater Yang collateral (手背阳明络)**.

At the **middle toe’s nail (足阳明中指爪甲上)**, one **Jǐng (瘠)**, and at the **second toe’s nail on the foot (手大指次指爪甲上)**, each one **Jǐng (瘠)**—**instant resolution**. **Right side for left-sided ailments, left side for right-sided ailments**. This refers to the **Lì Duì (厉兑)** point on the second toe.

The **second toe’s nail on the hand (手大指次指)**, this is the **Shangyáng (商阳)** point, the **Jǐng (井)** of the **Hand Greater Yang channel**. The *Needle Canon (针经)* states: **Toothache without aversion to cold drinks (齿痛不恶清饮)**, take the **Foot Greater Yang channel (足阳明)**. **Aversion to cold drinks (恶清饮)**, take the **Hand Greater Yang channel (手阳明)**.

*(New annotation: Referring to earlier text, when evil lodges in the Foot Greater Yang channel, needling the middle toe’s nail is correct; the mention of the "second toe" is an error and should be omitted.)*

When **evil** lodges in the **collaterals of the Hand, Foot Lesser Yin, Greater Yin, Foot Greater Yang channels (手、足少阴、太阴、足阳明之络)**, these **five collaterals (五络)** all converge in the **ear (耳中)**, spreading upward to the **left temple (左角)**. The **Hand Lesser Yin collateral (手少阴)**, the **True Heart pulse (真心脉)**. The **Foot Lesser Yin collateral (足少阴)**, the **kidney pulse (肾脉)**. The **Hand Greater Yin collateral (手太阴)**, the **lung pulse (肺脉)**. The **Foot Greater Yin collateral (足太阴)**, the **spleen pulse (脾脉)**. The **Foot Greater Yang collateral (足阳明)**, the **stomach pulse (胃脉)**.

These **five collaterals (五络)** all converge in the **ear**, and their **collaterals spread to the left temple (左额角)**. When all **five collaterals are exhausted (俱竭)**, it causes **the body’s pulses to move as usual (身脉皆动)**, yet **the form feels nothing (形无知)**, resembling a **corpse (尸)**, or called **corpse syncope (尸厥)**—**speaking of its sudden loss of consciousness as if dead (卒冒问而如死尸)**, while the **body’s pulses still move as in a living person (身脉犹如常人而动)**.

However, when **Yin-qi is excessive in the upper body (阴气盛於上)**, the **lower-qi becomes heavy (下气重)** and presses upward, while **evil-qi reverses (邪气逆)**, disrupting **Yang-qi (阳气)**. When **Yang-qi is disordered (阳气乱)**, the **five collaterals become blocked and stagnant (五络闭结)**, failing to flow—**thus its state resembles a corpse (故其状若尸)**. Since it arises from **syncope (厥)**, it is thus called **corpse syncope (尸厥)**.

Needle the **inner side of the big toe’s nail (足大指内侧爪甲上)**, **one cun from the tip (去端如韭叶)**, referring to the **Yǐnbái (隐白)** point, the **Jǐng (井)** of the **Foot Greater Yin channel**. Needling may penetrate **one fen of the body’s cun (同身寸之一分)**, retain for **three breaths (三呼)**. If moxibustion is applied, use **three cones (三壮)**.

Then needle the **sole of the foot (足心)**, referring to the **Yǒngquán (涌泉)** point, the **Jǐng (井)** of the **Foot Lesser Yin channel**. Needle using the method of taking **Yǒngquán (涌泉)** as before.

Then needle the **middle toe’s nail (足中指爪甲上)**, each one **Jǐng (瘠)**, referring to the **Lì Duì (厉兑)** point on the second toe of the **Foot Greater Yang channel**. Needle using the method of taking **Lì Duì (厉兑)** as before.

Then needle the **inner side of the big finger’s nail (手大指内侧)**, **one cun from the tip (去端如韭叶)**, referring to the **Shǎoshāng (少商)** point, the **Jǐng (井)** of the **Hand Greater Yin channel**. Needling may penetrate **one fen of the body’s cun (同身寸之一分)**, retain for **three breaths (三呼)**. If moxibustion is applied, use **three cones (三壮)**.

Then needle the **Palm’s Central Rushing (手心主)**, referring to the **Zhōngchōng (中冲)** point, the **Jǐng (井)** of the **Palm’s Central Rushing channel**. Needling may penetrate **one fen of the body’s cun (同身寸之一分)**, retain for **three breaths (三呼)**. If moxibustion is applied, use **one cone (一壮)**.

*(New annotation: According to the Jia-Yi Canon (甲乙经), needling the Palm’s Central Rushing is incorrect. Referring to the five collaterals’ count, it should not include the Palm’s Central Rushing either; thus, this method suggests six collaterals. This does not align with the clear intent of Wang Bing’s commentary.)*

At the **end of the sharp bone (锐骨)** on the **Lesser Yin channel (少阴)**, each one **Jǐng (瘠)**—**instant resolution**. This refers to the **Shénmén (神门)** point, located in the **depression at the posterior wrist’s sharp bone (掌后锐骨之端陷者中)**, the **Shu (俞)** point of the **Hand Lesser Yin channel**. Needling may penetrate **three fen of the body’s cun (同身寸之三分)**, retain for **seven breaths (七呼)**. If moxibustion is applied, use **three cones (三壮)**.

If it does not resolve, use a **bamboo tube (竹管)** to blow into both **ears (两耳)**, **speaking of directing qi into the ears (使气入耳中)**, internally assisting the **five collaterals (五络)**, and **restoring qi flow (令气复通)**. When the **inner tube enters the ear (当内管入耳)**, cover it with the **hand (以手密)**, ensuring the **qi does not escape (勿令气泄)**, and blow **forcefully (极吹)** until the **qi is compressed (气蹙然)**—**then the collaterals will flow (后络脉通)**.

*(New annotation: According to Tao Yinju (陶隐居), blow the left ear three times, then the right ear three times.)*

**Pluck the hair (鬓)** at the **left temple (左角)**, **one cun in width (发方一寸)**, and **treat with wine (墦治)**—**one cup of fine wine (美酒一杯)**. If unable to drink, **pour it down (灌之)**—**instant resolution**. The **left temple’s hair (左角之发)** is the **remnant of the five collaterals’ blood (五络血之余)**, hence it is **plucked (衅)**. **Treat with wine (墦治)**, **drink it with fine wine (饮之以美酒)**. **Wine (酒)** is used to **facilitate medication (行药)**, and its **nature is to ascend and internally course toward the Heart (势又炎上而内走於心)**—the **Heart governs the pulses (心主脉)**—**thus fine wine is administered for ingestion**.

**On the Methods of Needling and the Four Seasons’ Inverse and Conforming Principles**

In all needling, first observe the **meridian pathways (经脉)**, palpate them, and follow their course. Assess their **emptiness or fullness (虚实)** and regulate accordingly. If regulation fails, apply **orthodox needling (经刺)**. If there is pain but the meridian itself is unaffected, use **divergent needling (缪刺)**, and if the **skin’s collateral vessels (皮部有血络)** are visible, exhaustively remove them. This is the method of **divergent needling**.

**Theory of the Four Seasons: Inverse and Conforming Needling**

**Jueyin Meridian (厥阴)**
- **Excess (有余)** causes **yin numbness (阴痹)**—*numbness (痹)* refers to **pain (痛)**, and *yin* refers to **cold (寒)**. Excess means the **Jueyin qi is overabundant and full (厥阴气盛满)**, so **cold manifests externally (阴发於外)**, resulting in **cold numbness (寒痹)**.
  *(Annotation: The *New Rectification* states: In detail, Wang’s interpretation of *numbness* as *pain* is unclear.)*
- **Deficiency (不足)** causes **heat numbness (热痹)**. When *yin* is deficient, *yang* becomes excessive, hence **heat numbness**.
  - **Slickness (滑)** causes **fox hernia-wind (狐疝风)**.
  - **Dryness (涩)** causes **accumulation of gas in the lower abdomen (少腹积气)**.
  The **Jueyin meridian** travels along the **inner thigh (股阴)**, enters the **perineum (髦中)**, encircles the **genital organ (阴器)**, and reaches the **lower abdomen (少腹)**. Its collateral branches diverge, ascending along the **sperm duct (睪)**, converging at the **penis (茎)**, hence causing **fox hernia (狐疝)** and **accumulation of gas in the lower abdomen**.
  *(Annotation: According to Yang Shangshan (杨上善): *Fox hernia* refers to inability to urinate at night, only possible after sunrise—similar to human ailments, hence called *孤#18疝 (lonely hernia)*. Alternatively, *fox hernia* refers to **San Jiao’s lonely reservoir (三焦孤府)** causing hernia, hence *孤疝 (lonely hernia)*.)*

**Shaoyin Meridian (少阴)**
- **Excess (有余)** causes **skin numbness (皮痹)** and **hidden torsion (隐斡)**.
- **Deficiency (不足)** causes **lung numbness (肺痹)**, for **kidney water reverses and connects to the lung’s mother (肺母)**.
  The **foot Shaoyin meridian** ascends from the **kidney**, pierces the **liver’s diaphragm (肝鬲)**, and enters the **lung**, hence:
  - **Excess** causes **skin numbness and hidden torsion (隐斡)**.
  - **Deficiency** causes **lung numbness**.
  - **Slickness (滑)** causes **lung hernia-wind (肺风疝)**.
  - **Dryness (涩)** causes **accumulated stagnant blood (积没血)**.
  Since its **main meridian enters the lung, pierces the kidney, and collaterals connect to the bladder (膀胱)**, it results in **lung hernia and accumulated stagnant blood**.

**Taiyin Meridian (太阴)**
- **Excess (有余)** causes **flesh numbness (肉痹)** and **cold invasion (寒中)**.
- **Deficiency (不足)** causes **spleen numbness (脾痹)**.
  The **spleen governs flesh (脾主肉)**, hence such manifestations.
  - **Slickness (滑)** causes **spleen hernia-wind (脾风疝)**.
  - **Dryness (涩)** causes **accumulated heart-abdominal periodic fullness (积心腹时满)**.
  The **Taiyin meridian** enters the **abdomen, belongs to the spleen, and collaterals connect to the stomach (胃)**. Its branches diverge again from the stomach, ascending through the **diaphragm (鬲)**, pouring into the **heart (心中)**, hence causing **spleen hernia and periodic heart-abdominal fullness**.

**Yangming Meridian (阳明)**
- **Excess (有余)** causes **pulse numbness (脉痹)** and **periodic body heat (身时热)**.
- **Deficiency (不足)** causes **heart numbness (心痹)**.
  When the **stomach is excessive**, its qi ascends to the **heart**; when deficient, **numbness occurs beneath the heart (心下痹)**, hence these symptoms.
  - **Slickness (滑)** causes **heart hernia-wind (心风疝)**.
  - **Dryness (涩)** causes **accumulated periodic startling (积时善惊)**.
  The **heart’s governing meridian (心主之脉)** arises from the **chest**, emerges to belong to the **heart包 (pericardium)**, descends through the **diaphragm (鬲)**, and sequentially collaterals the **San Jiao (三焦)**, hence causing **heart hernia and periodic startling**.

**Taiyang Meridian (太阳)**
- **Excess (有余)** causes **bone numbness (骨痹)** and **body heaviness (身重)**.
- **Deficiency (不足)** causes **kidney numbness (肾痹)**.
  The **Taiyang and Shaoyin** are **external-internal pairs (表裹)**, so both excess and deficiency manifest in the **kidney**.
  - **Slickness (滑)** causes **kidney hernia-wind (肾风疝)**.
  - **Dryness (涩)** causes **accumulated periodic vertigo (积善时巅疾)**.
  The **Taiyang meridian** converges at the **vertex (巅上)**, enters to collateralize the **brain (脑)**, descends along the **loins (膂)**, and collaterals the **kidney (肾)**, hence causing **kidney wind and vertigo**.

**Shaoyang Meridian (少阳)**
- **Excess (有余)** causes **tendon numbness (筋痹)** and **rib-side fullness (胁满)**.
- **Deficiency (不足)** causes **liver numbness (肝痹)**.
  The **Shaoyang and Jueyin** are **external-internal pairs (表裹)**, so ailments manifest in the **liver**.
  - **Slickness (滑)** causes **liver hernia-wind (肝风疝)**.
  - **Dryness (涩)** causes **accumulated periodic tendon tightness and eye pain (积时筋急目痛)**.
  The **liver governs tendons (肝主筋)**, hence **periodic tendon tightness**. The **Jueyin meridian** ascends to the **forehead (额)**, converges with the **Governor Vessel (督脉)** at the **vertex (巅)**, and its branches diverge from the **eye system (目系)**, descending along the **cheek (颊)**, encircling, hence **eye pain**.

**The Qi of the Seasons in the Body**

The **Spring qi** resides in the **meridians (经脉)**,
The **Summer qi** in the **fine collaterals (孙络)**,
The **Long Summer qi** in the **muscles (肌肉)**,
The **Autumn qi** in the **skin (皮肤)**,
The **Winter qi** in the **bone marrow (骨髓)**.

**Emperor:** I wish to hear the reason for this.
**Ghibu (岐伯):** In **Spring**, the **heavenly qi begins to open (天气始开)**, the **earthly qi begins to release (地气始泄)**, frost thaws and ice melts, water flows, and **meridians are unblocked (水行经通)**, hence **human qi resides in the meridians (人气在脉)**.

In **Summer**, the **meridians are full and qi overflows (经满气溢)**, entering the **fine collaterals to receive blood (孙络受血)**, filling the **skin and flesh (皮肤充实)**.

In **Long Summer**, the **meridians and collaterals are all flourishing (经络皆盛)**, internally overflowing into the **muscles (肌中)**.

In **Autumn**, the **heavenly qi begins to withdraw (天气始收)**, **victorious principles close and seal (胜理闭塞)**, and the **skin tightens (皮肤引急)**—*引* means **taut and contracted (牵引以缩急)**.

In **Winter**, **conservation occurs (盖藏)**, **blood and qi reside internally (血气在中)**, attaching to the **bone marrow (骨髓)**, communicating with the **five viscera (五藏)**.

Thus, **pathogenic qi** always follows the **seasonal qi and blood**, entering as a **guest**. When it transforms, its extent is unpredictable, yet it **must follow the meridian qi**. **Repel and remove the pathogenic**, and **disordered qi will not arise**. **Harmonize with the qi**, and **disorder will not occur**.

**Emperor:** How does **contrary to the four seasons** generate **disordered qi**?
**Ghibu:**
- **Spring needling of collaterals (春刺络脉)** causes **qi to overflow externally (血气外溢)**, leading to **shortness of breath (少气)**.
  *(Annotation: From *Spring needling of collaterals* to *blurring of vision*, the meaning aligns with *Diagnostic Canon’s Final Theory (诊要经终论)*, though phrasing differs. The latter elaborates where this text omits Autumn Equinox needling. This *Long Summer* division for muscle needling likely corresponds to the *Autumn skin* section in the other text.)*
- **Spring needling of muscles (春刺肌肉)** causes **qi to circulate inversely (血气环逆)**, leading to **upward gasping (上气)**.
  *(Annotation: The text omits *Spring needling at Autumn Equinox*.)*
- **Spring needling of tendons and bones (春刺筋骨)** causes **qi to attach internally (血气内着)**, leading to **abdominal distension (腹胀)**.

- **Summer needling of meridians (夏刺经脉)** causes **qi to be exhausted (血气乃竭)**, leading to **indeterminate sweating (解传)**—*indeterminate* means **neither cold nor hot, neither strong nor weak**, hence unnamed.
- **Summer needling of muscles (夏刺肌肉)** causes **qi to retreat internally (血气内却)**, leading to **frequent fear (善恐)**—*却* means **closure**. When **qi is internally blocked**, *yang* does not circulate, hence **frequent fear**.
- **Summer needling of tendons and bones (夏刺筋骨)** causes **qi to reverse upward (血气上逆)**, leading to **frequent anger (善怒)**.

「When **qi reverses upward (血气上逆)**, the **anger qi** responds in kind, hence **frequent anger (善怒)**.
  *(Annotation: The newly corrected text notes: According to the Classic, *Summer needling at Autumn Equinox* is omitted.)*

- **Autumn needling of meridians (秋刺经脉)** causes **qi to reverse upward (血气上逆)**, leading to **frequent forgetfulness (善忘)**.
  When **qi reverses upward**, it accumulates in the **lungs (满於肺中)**, hence **frequent forgetfulness**.

- **Autumn needling of collateral vessels (秋刺络脉)** causes **qi to fail to circulate externally (气不外行)**.
  *(Annotation: The newly corrected text notes: According to another version, it reads *qi fails to nourish externally (血气不行)*; Quan Yuanqi’s version reads *qi does not guard externally (气不卫外)*, matching the *Taoist Canon*.)*
  This leads to **lying without desire to move (卧不欲动)**—due to **excessive vacuity (以虚甚故)**.
  *(Annotation: The newly corrected text notes: According to the Classic, *Autumn needling at Late Summer Equinox* is omitted.)*

- **Autumn needling of tendons and bones (秋刺筋骨)** causes **qi to scatter internally (血气内散)**, leading to **chills and shivering (寒栗)**.
  When **qi scatters internally**, the **central qi weakens (中气虚)**, hence **chills and shivering**.

- **Winter needling of meridians (冬刺经脉)** causes **qi to be entirely depleted (血气皆脱)**, leading to **blurred vision (目不明)**—due to **qi failing to nourish (以血气无所营故也)**.

- **Winter needling of collateral vessels (冬刺络脉)** causes **internal qi to leak externally (内气外泄)**, resulting in **severe numbness (大痹)**.

- **Winter needling of muscles (冬刺肌肉)** causes **yang qi to be exhausted (阳气竭绝)**, leading to **frequent forgetfulness (善忘)**.
  When **yang qi is not robust (阳气不壮)**, it is fully depleted by **Spring (至春而竭)**, hence **frequent forgetfulness**.
  *(Annotation: The newly corrected text notes: According to the Classic, *Winter needling at Autumn Equinox* is omitted.)*

In all these **four seasonal needlings (凡此四时刺者)**, they produce **greatly inverted diseases (大逆之病)**.
  *(Annotation: According to Quan Yuanqi’s version, it reads *the diseases of the Six Canons (六经之病)*.)*
  These must be **avoided (不可不从也)**.
  If **reversed (反之)**, even once, **disordered qi will proliferate (生乱气)**, leading to **excessive diseases (相淫病焉)**.
  *淫* means **without sequence (不次也)**—acting without proper order, like **gradual contamination (浸淫相染)** that generates disease.

Thus, **needling without following the seasonal Canons (刺不知四时之经)** means the **origin of disease follows inversion (病之所生)**.
When **correct qi is internally disordered (正气内乱)** and **interacts with vital essence (与精相薄)**, one must **examine the Nine Signs (必审九候)**.
Only then will **correct qi not be disordered (正气不乱)** and **vital qi not be inverted (精气不转)**!
*不转* means **not inverted (不逆转也)**.

The Emperor said: **"Excellent (善)."**

Needling the **Heart** causes death in **one day**; its **manifestation** is **sighing**.
*The Zhen Yao Jing Zhong Lun* states: *"Needling the Heart leads to encircled death."*
*The Ci Jin Lun* states: *"Death in one day; its manifestation is sighing."*

Needling the **Liver** causes death in **five days**; its **manifestation** is **speech**.
*The Zhen Yao Jing Zhong Lun* omits discussion on this.
*The Ci Jin Lun* states: *"Needling the Liver causes death in five days; its manifestation is speech."*
**Newly corrected:** According to the *Jia Yi Jing*, it reads *"yawn"* instead.

Needling the **Lung** causes death in **three days**; its **manifestation** is **coughing**.
*The Zhen Yao Jing Zhong Lun* states: *"Needling the Lung causes death in five days."*
*The Ci Jin Lun* states: *"Needling the Lung causes death in three days; its manifestation is coughing."*

Needling the **Kidney** causes death in **six days**; its **manifestation** is **swallowing**.
**Newly corrected:** According to the *Jia Yi Jing*, it reads *"three days"* instead.
*The Zhen Yao Jing Zhong Lun* states: *"Needling the Spleen causes death in five days."*
*The Ci Jin Lun* states: *"Needling the Kidney causes death in six days; its manifestation is swallowing."*

Yet these three treatises—all attributed to **Qibo**—differ in their days of death and manifestations, likely due to transmission errors.

If needling **injures the Five Zang**, **wrinkling (皴)** will inevitably lead to death. Its **manifestations** follow the **changes of the respective Zang** to determine death.
*Variable* refers to **changes in qi movement**.

From needling the **Heart** downward, these are all cases of **inversion and compliance**—**redundant phrasing** for emphasis.

**"Discourse on the Transmission of Disease Between Manifestation and Root**
*(Newly corrected: According to Quan Yuanqi’s original text, this appears before the *Discourse on the Skin Department*.)*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"When disease presents with manifestation and root, and needling follows inversion or compliance—how should one proceed?"*

Qibo replied: *"In all needling methods, one must first distinguish yin and yang, then observe their sequential correspondence. Whether inversion or compliance is applied, the relationship between manifestation and root shifts accordingly. Thus, there are cases where the disease lies in the manifestation yet is sought in the root, where it lies in the root yet is sought in the manifestation, where it lies in the root yet is sought in the manifestation, and where it lies in the manifestation yet is treated by first addressing the root.

Therefore, treatment may succeed by targeting the manifestation alone, the root alone, inversion alone, or compliance alone. When one grasps the essence of the disease and understands the broad principle of treatment, both inversion and compliance become applicable, and the method is naturally correct.

Thus, knowing inversion and compliance requires no further questioning. Knowing manifestation and root ensures success in every case. When one’s understanding is not confused by the Dao, and discernment is profound and clear, there is no need to consult others—every application will be correct. Ignorance of manifestation and root is reckless practice. If perception is narrow and shallow, and the Dao remains obscure and profound, actions will often err, leading to many mistakes.

The principles of yin and yang, inversion and compliance, manifestation and root—though seemingly small—embrace the great. To speak of one is to know the harm of a hundred diseases. This is the ultimate precision. To distinguish yin and yang, to know inversion and compliance, to clarify the laws and observe their subtleties—when examining what is raised, it may seem minor, but when tracing its benefits, it becomes vast. Through this clarity, one may speak of one thing and know the harm of a hundred diseases. From the few, one grasps the many; from the shallow, one comprehends the deep. Thus, one may speak of one thing and know a hundred diseases.

To say that the few can encompass the many, and that the shallow can measure the deep—what law is so clear that only the Sage’s Dao could attain this?

Thus, those who study may also speak of one thing and know a hundred diseases.
*Bó* means *great*.

With the shallow, one knows the deep; with the near, one knows the far. Though the Dao of manifestation and root is easy to speak of, few in the world can truly grasp it.

*Treatment contrary to the disease is inversion; treatment in accord with the disease is compliance.*

If disease appears first and inversion follows, treat the root. If inversion appears first and disease follows, treat the root. If cold appears first and disease follows, treat the root. If disease appears first and cold follows, treat the root. If heat appears first and disease follows, treat the root. If heat appears first and *zhòngmǎn* (distension/fullness) follows, treat the manifestation. If disease appears first and diarrhea follows, treat the root. If diarrhea appears first and another disease follows, treat the root—first harmonizing it, then addressing the other disease. If disease appears first and *zhòngmǎn* follows, treat the manifestation. If *zhòngmǎn* appears first and mental agitation follows, treat the root.

Humans have *guest-qi* and *native-qi*.
*(Newly corrected: According to Quan Yuanqi’s original text, this reads *fixed/enduring-qi*.)*

When both small and large intestines are dysfunctional, treat the manifestation. When only the large intestine is dysfunctional, treat the root.

If the root is first diseased and the manifestation follows, examine carefully. If the disease erupts with excess, treat it as *root-to-manifestation*—first the root, then the manifestation. If the disease erupts with deficiency, treat it as *manifestation-to-root*—first the manifestation, then the root.

*Root-to-manifestation* refers to cases where one disease follows another. Because of its excess, one first treats the root, then the manifestation. *Manifestation-to-root* refers to cases where a mild, gradual onset precedes a severe, urgent one. Because of its deficiency, one first treats the manifestation, then the root.

Examine carefully, questioning extensively, and adjust accordingly.
*Questioning* means *many signs*. *Vast* means *few signs*.
*Many* refers to multiple symptoms that are light and easy to discern. *Few* refers to sparse symptoms that are severe and difficult to diagnose.
*Adjust accordingly* means to regulate based on whether manifestation and root are in excess or deficiency—not to arbitrarily apply methods based on personal whim.

When symptoms are *many*, treat them in combination. When symptoms are *vast*, treat them singly.

If small and large intestinal dysfunction precede disease, treat the root.
*Combination* means multiple pulses receiving pathogenic *qi* and converging in disease. *Singular* means a single channel is diseased without other abnormal *qi* interfering.

When combined symptoms are severe, they transmit. When transmission is urgent, death follows.

As for diseases that transmit:
Heart disease begins with heart pain—
*The Zang’s true essence communicates with the heart, hence the heart pains first.*
On the first day, coughing—
*The heart’s fire overcomes metal, transmitting to the lungs. The lungs, in change, manifest as coughing.*
On the third day, hypochondriac pain—
*The lungs’ metal overcomes wood, transmitting to the liver. Because the liver’s *qi* courses along the ribs, it manifests thus.*
On the fifth day, obstruction and stagnation, with body heaviness and pain—
*The liver’s wood overcomes earth, transmitting to the spleen. The spleen’s nature is to settle and harmonize; when wood *qi* assaults it, obstruction and stagnation occur, with body heaviness and pain.*
If this persists for three days, death follows.
*Because the overpowering weakens the attacked, and the four Zang are injured, how could it endure? Thus, death is immediate.*

At the winter *night half* (23:00–01:00) or the summer *day half* (11:00–13:00).
*This refers to the true *zi* and *wu* hours.*
Some say winter and summer differ, but this is incorrect. The division of day and night is clearly evident.

*(Newly corrected: According to the *Língshū Jīng*: "When great *qi* enters the Zang, disease first manifests in the heart, then on the first day transmits to the lungs, on the third day to the liver, on the fifth day to the spleen. If it persists for three days, death follows. Winter at night half, summer at day half."
The *Jia Yi Jing* states: "Disease first manifests in the heart, with heart pain. On the first day, it transmits to the lungs, causing coughing. On the third day, it transmits to the liver, causing hypochondriac pain. On the fifth day, it transmits to the spleen, causing obstruction, stagnation, body heaviness, and pain. If it persists for three days, death follows. Winter at night half, summer at day half."
The *Su Wèn* elaborates on the disease, the *Língshū* on the Zang, while the *Jia Yi Jing* combines both *Su Wèn* and *Língshū*, detailing both disease progression and Zang transmission.)"

The *Língshū* states: "When the lungs are diseased, there is wheezing and coughing, for the **Zàngzhēn** (藏真, *true essence of the Zang*) is higher than the lungs and governs respiration, hence the wheezing and coughing. On the third day, the hypochondriac region becomes distended and painful, as the lungs transmit the disease to the liver. On the first day, the body feels heavy and painful, as the liver transmits the disease to the spleen. On the fifth day, there is distension, and the disease transmits itself to the **Fǔ** (府, *Fu organs*). If it persists for ten days, death follows. In winter, it enters [the body] by day; in summer, it exits by day.

At the midpoint of **Mèngdōng** (孟冬, *early winter*), the sun sets at the **Shēn** (申) hour, **8 kè** (刻) and **2 fēn** (分) of time. At the midpoint of **Zhòngdōng** (仲冬, *mid-winter*), the sun sets at the **Shēn** hour, **7 kè** and **3 fēn** of time. At the midpoint of **Jìdōng** (季冬, *late winter*), the sun sets at the **Shēn** hour, equal to that of **Mèngyuè** (孟月, *early month*).

At the midpoint of **Mèngxià** (孟夏, *early summer*), the sun rises at the **Yín** (寅) hour, **8 kè** and **1 fēn** of time. At the midpoint of **Zhòngxià** (仲夏, *mid-summer*), the sun rises at the **Yín** (寅) hour, **7 kè** and **3 fēn** of time. At the midpoint of **Jìxià** (季夏, *late summer*), the sun rises at the **Yín** hour, equal to that of **Mèngyuè** (孟月, *early month*) as well.

When the liver is diseased, there is dizziness of the head and eyes, and distension in the hypochondriac region, for the **Zàngzhēn** (藏真, *true essence of the Zang*) disperses through the liver, and its pulse connects internally with the eyes and hypochondrium, hence such symptoms. On the third day, the body feels heavy and painful, as the liver transmits the disease to the lungs. On the fifth day, there is distension, and the disease transmits itself to the **Fǔ** (府, *Fu organs*)."

The sun sets at the **Shēn** (申) hour, **8 kè** and **2 fēn** of time. At the midpoint of **Zhòngdōng** (仲冬, *mid-winter*), the sun sets at the **Shēn** hour, **7 kè** and **3 fēn** of time. At the midpoint of **Jìdōng** (季冬, *late winter*), the sun sets at the **Shēn** hour, equal to that of **Mèngyuè** (孟月, *early month*) as well.

When the liver is diseased, there is dizziness of the head and eyes, and distension in the hypochondriac region, for the **Zàngzhēn** (藏真, *true essence of the Zang*) disperses through the liver, and its pulse connects internally with the eyes and hypochondrium, hence such symptoms.

On the third day, the **yào** (腰, *lumbar region*), **jǐ** (脊, *spine*), and **shǎo fù** (少腹, *lower abdomen*) ache, and the **jīng** (经, *meridians*) feel sour—this is called the stomach transmitting the disease to the **shèn** (肾, *kidneys*). For its pulse arises at the foot, follows the **duān** (端, *extremity*) internally, emerges at the **xīn** (胭, *inner ankle*), ascends the inner thigh to the **hòu kàng** (后康, *posterior knee crease*), pierces the spine, and connects with the kidneys, linking to the **pángguāng** (膀胱, *urinary bladder*), hence such symptoms. The lumbar region is the **Fǔ** (府, *Fu organ*) of the kidneys, so there is lumbar pain. If the pain persists for three days, death follows.

In winter, the sun sets early; the newly revised text states: according to the *Jiāyǐ Jīng* (甲乙经, *Canon of the Jia and Yi*), it should be **day mid** (日中, *midday*). In summer, the sun sets early as well. The time of setting early or late follows the winter method. Early setting refers to setting before the usual meal time, which is the **Chǎo** (卯) hour. When the **pí** (脾, *spleen*) is diseased, there is body pain and heaviness, for the **Zàngzhēn** (藏真, *true essence of the Zang*) permeates the spleen, and the spleen governs the muscles, hence such symptoms. On the first day, there is distension, and the disease transmits itself to the **Fǔ** (府, *Fu organs*). On the second day, the lower abdomen, lumbar region, and spine ache, and the **jīng** (经, *meridians*) feel sour—this is the stomach transmitting the disease to the kidneys. On the third day, the back feels fatty (or swollen), the **jīn** (筋, *tendons*) ache, and urination is blocked; the disease transmits itself to the **Fǔ** (府, *Fu organs*) and the **tāi** (胎, *fetus*). If this persists for ten days, death follows.

In winter, the sun sets at **Shēn** hour, **25 kè** after **Rén** (人, *person*) hour. In summer, the sun sets at **Yín** hour, **25 kè** after **Mèngyuè** (孟月, *early month*). When the kidneys are diseased, the lower abdomen, lumbar region, and spine ache, and the **Fǔ** (腑, *Fu organs*) feel sour, for the **Zàngzhēn** (藏真, *true essence of the Zang*) descends to the kidneys, hence such symptoms.

「On the third day, the back and fetus suffer tendon pain, and urination is blocked; the disease transmits itself to the **Fu** (腑, *Fu organs*).

○The newly corrected version states: According to the *Línggū Jīng* (《灵枢经》), "the fetus" refers to the **Pángguāng** (膀胱, *bladder*), meaning the disease transmits itself to the **Fu** (腑) and the **Pángguāng** (膀胱) as well.

On the third day, the abdomen distends, and the **Pángguāng** (膀胱, *bladder*) transmits the disease to the **Xiǎocháng** (小肠, *Small Intestine*).
○The newly corrected version states: According to the *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* (《甲乙经》), it reads: "On the third day, it ascends to the heart, causing heart distension."

On the third day, both sides of the ribs and lateral branches ache; the **Fu** (腑) transmits the disease to the **Zàng** (藏, *Zang organs*).
○The newly corrected version states: According to the *Línggū Jīng* (《灵枢经》), it reads: "On the third day, it is the Small Intestine; on the third day, it ascends to the heart." Now it states that both sides of the ribs and lateral branches ache, meaning the **Fu** (腑) of the Small Intestine transmits the disease to the heart, causing pain.

If this persists for three days, death follows.

In winter, the **Dàchén** (大晨, *great dawn*) occurs; in summer, the **Yànbǔ** (晏哺, *late nursing*) occurs.
**Dàchén** refers to the time **9 kè** after **Yín** (寅, *tiger*) hour, when the light is at its brightest.
**Yànbǔ** refers to the time **9 kè** after **Shēn** (申, *monkey*) hour, when the light is fading toward dusk.

When the stomach is diseased, causing distension and fullness, it is because its **mài** (脉, *pulse/meridian*) courses through the abdomen, hence such symptoms.

On the fifth day, the lower abdomen and lumbar spine ache, the **Fu** (腑) feel sour, and the stomach transmits the disease to the **kidney** (肾). On the third day, the back’s fatty tissues and sinews ache, and urination is obstructed, as the **bladder** (膀胱) transmits the disease to the **Fu** (腑) and the **embryo** (胎) as well. On the fifth day, the body feels heavy, for the **bladder** (膀胱) and **water Fu** (水府) transmit the disease to the **spleen** (脾).

The newly annotated text states: According to the *Lingshu Jing* (《灵枢经》) and the *Jia-Yi Jing* (《甲乙经》), each describes the fifth day as transmitting to the heart. This means the bladder transmits to the heart, causing the body to feel heavy due to mutual opposition. Now, Wang’s statement that it transmits to the spleen is incorrect.

If this persists for six days, death follows. In winter, it occurs after midnight; in summer, it occurs at **day drip** (日跌, *late afternoon*). Midnight after refers to **8 kè** after **Zǐ** (子, *rat*) hour, when **Chǒu** (丑, *ox*) hour begins. **Day drip** refers to **8 kè** after **Wǔ** (午, *horse*) hour, before **Yǔ** (酉, *rooster*) hour. **Drip** is pronounced as *yǎn* (晏), with the initial *yù* (徒) and the rhyme *jié* (结). When the bladder is diseased and urination is obstructed, it is because the bladder is the **Fu** (府) of **jīn-yè** (津液, *body fluids*), hence such symptoms.

On the fifth day, the lower abdomen distends, and the lumbar spine aches with sourness in the **Fu** (腑), as it naturally returns to the **Zàng** (藏, *solid organ*). On the first day, the abdomen distends, and the **kidney** (肾) again transmits the disease to the small intestine. On the first day, the body aches, as the small intestine transmits the disease to the spleen.

The newly annotated text states: According to the *Lingshu Jing* (《灵枢经》), the text reads: "On the first day, it ascends to the heart. This is the **Fu** (府) transmitting to the **Zàng** (藏)." The *Jia-Yi Jing* (《甲乙经》) reads: "On the second day, it does not cease, death follows." In winter, it occurs at **cock’s crow** (鸡呜, *early morning*); in summer, it occurs at **late nursing** (下哺, *afternoon*). **Cock’s crow** refers to the division of **Chǒu** (丑, *ox*) hour at dawn. **Late nursing** refers to **5 kè** after **Shēn** (申, *monkey*) hour. All diseases follow this sequential transmission pattern (#24), and those that do will have a fixed period of death, making acupuncture treatment unfeasible.

When the **Zàng** (藏, *solid organs*) transmit diseases sequentially, some cases involve gradual transmission, while others are abrupt. Gradual cases may lead to death after one, two, or three years, or after three or six months; abrupt cases may lead to death within one, two, three, or four days, or even five or six days, such as in this instance.

Examining the transmission laws of this disease, they align with the **Five Phases** (五行) **qi** (气). By reviewing the number of days, one can discern the underlying principle. According to the **Five Phases** system, when the **unconquering** (不胜) **qi** transmits to the **conquering** (所胜) organ—such as fire transmitting to metal (金) on the first day, metal transmitting to wood (木) on the second day, wood transmitting to earth (土) on the third day, earth transmitting to water (水) on the fourth day, and water transmitting to fire (火) on the fifth day—then the transmission follows the **Five Phases** **qi** of the **three yin and three yang** (三阴三阳).

The *Yùjī Zhēncáng Lùn* (《玉机真藏论》) states: The **Zàng** (藏, *solid organs*) are interconnected, and their transmission follows a specific sequence. If left untreated, death may occur after three or six months, or within three or six days, as the disease transmits and reaches its critical point.

Although this is the case, one should still carefully observe the symptoms and count the days when diagnosing the disease to fully understand its progression. When the disease stops at one **Zàng** (藏), the newly annotated text states: The *Jia-Yi Jing* (《甲乙经》) does not have the character **止** (*stop*). When it reaches the third or fourth **Zàng** (藏), acupuncture treatment may be feasible.

When the disease stops at one **Zàng** (藏), it means that after passing through the previous **Zàng** (藏), it no longer transmits further. This would be the case when wood transmits to earth, earth transmits to water, water transmits to fire, fire transmits to metal, and metal transmits to wood, all while stopping after each transmission.

When it reaches the third or fourth **Zàng** (藏), it means the disease has progressed to the third or fourth **Zàng** (藏) in sequence. When it reaches the third **Zàng** (藏), it is the **unconquering** (不胜) **qi** of its own phase. When it reaches the fourth **Zàng** (藏), it is the **qi** of the **parental** (父母) organ that it generates. If the **qi** is unconquering, it cannot cause harm; regarding the organ it generates, there is no parent-child conflict, and the **qi** flows harmoniously, hence acupuncture treatment is possible.

**The Great Treatise on the Celestial Primordium**

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"The Celestial Five Phases govern the Five Positions, giving rise to cold, heat, dryness, dampness, and wind. The human Five Viscera transform the Five Qi, giving rise to joy, anger, thought, worry, and fear. 'Govern' means to oversee. 'Transform' means to generate and change.*

*The vital essence of Heaven is pervasive without bounds. Though their manifestations differ, their correspondences are unified.*

**New Annotation:** *According to the *Treatise on the Correspondence of Yin and Yang*, the emotions are joy, anger, sorrow, worry, and fear. The two treatises differ because 'thought' pertains to the Spleen, which all Four Viscera rely upon for completion, and 'sorrow' overcomes anger—thus the two treatises complement each other.*

*The Treatise states that the Five Movements succeed one another in governance, and their terminal days complete a cycle, returning anew. This I have already understood. Now I wish to hear how they harmonize with the conditions of the Three Yin and Three Yang.*

**Annotation:** *The 'Treatise' refers to the *Treatise on the Six Nodal Phases and Viscera*. 'Movements' refers to the Five Phases corresponding to Heaven’s Five Movements, each completing a cycle of 365 days as a standard. Thus, it is said that their terminal days complete a cycle, returning anew. Since six and five do not yet harmonize in their numerical correspondence, I ask this.*

Ghostly Yu Qiu knelt and bowed twice in reply: *"Your question is profound! The Five Movements of Yin and Yang are the Dao of Heaven and Earth, the fundamental order of all things, the origin of transformation, the source of life and death, and the repository of divine mystery—how could one not master them?*

**Annotation:** *Dao refers to the principle of generation and transformation. 'Fundamental order' refers to the principles governing growth, transformation, formation, storage, and concealment. 'Origin' means that life and death arise from these. The Five Movements of Yin and Yang govern all things without exception. Why, then, does creation not reach its utmost, and why are they the primordial source of all generation and transformation? It is because they are the repository of divine mystery.*

*Yet their coalescence and dispersal are unfathomable, and their generation and transformation are boundless—not because the Five Movements are inadequate, but because their operations are profound.*

**New Annotation:** *The detailed explanation of 'Yin and Yang as the repository of divine mystery' aligns with the *Treatise on the Correspondence of Yin and Yang*, though the commentaries differ.*

*Thus, when things are born, it is called 'transformation'; when they reach their limit, it is called 'change'; when Yin and Yang are unfathomable, it is called 'divine'; when divine operations are boundless, it is called 'sage.' This is the Dao of transformation, change, sagehood, and divinity.*

**Annotation:** *Transformation refers to the application of change. Change refers to dispersal and alteration. Divine refers to the absence of limits. Sage refers to the absence of measurable thought. The application of Qi brings forth life; its dispersal brings forth limits; its boundless nature is called divine; its immeasurability is called sage. Through transformation and change, no thing can escape the Five Movements of Yin and Yang. Through sagehood and divinity, no marvel can transcend the profound principles of the cosmos.*

*Profound indeed are their wondrous operations, beyond all description.*

**New Annotation:** *According to the *Treatise on the Six Subtle Principles*, it is said: 'The birth of things arises from transformation; their limits arise from change. The interplay of transformation and change determines success and failure.' Again, the *Treatise on the Five Constant Regulations* states: 'Qi begins and generates transformation; Qi disperses and forms shape; Qi spreads and nurtures; Qi concludes and changes form—its effects are unified.'*

*The operations of transformation and change are vast:*
- *In Heaven, they are the Mysterious (玄).*
**Annotation:** *Mysterious refers to the distant and profound. The Dao of Heaven is distant and profound, its transformations boundless. The Classic says: 'The Dao of Heaven is distant; the Dao of humanity is near.'*
- *In humanity, they are the Way.*
**Annotation:** *Way refers to the principle of wondrous operation. The Classic unfolds regulations and transformations; without the Way, they cannot be complete.*
- *On Earth, they are transformation.*
**Annotation:** *Transformation refers to generation. It is the source of all things. Without the nurturing Qi of Earth, their forms and substances would not be complete. Transformation generates the Five Flavors—metals, stones, grasses, and trees—roots, leaves, flowers, and fruits: sour, bitter, sweet, bland, and salty, all arising from transformative Qi in their proper seasons.*

*The Way generates wisdom. Wisdom comprehends wondrous operations, arising solely from the Way.*

*The Mysterious generates the Divine. The Mysterious is distant and profound, thus it generates the Divine. The operations of the Divine, when encountering the Mysterious, harmonize with all things, completing transformations without fail.*

*The Divine, in Heaven, is Wind—*
**Annotation:** *Wind is the beginning of instruction, Heaven’s decree, Heaven’s command.*

*—in Earth, is Wood; the transformation of the Eastern direction.*

*—in Heaven, is Heat—*
**Annotation:** *It corresponds to Fire in its function.*

*—in Earth, is Fire; the transformation of the Southern direction.*

*—in Heaven, is Dampness—*
**Annotation:** *It corresponds to Earth in its function.*

*—in Earth, is Earth; the transformation of the Central direction.*

*—in Heaven, is Dryness—*
**Annotation:** *It corresponds to Metal in its function.*

*—in Earth, is Metal; the transformation of the Western direction.*

*—in Heaven, is Cold—*
**Annotation:** *It corresponds to Water in its function.*

*—in Earth, is Water; the transformation of the Northern direction.*

*The operations of the Divine manifest in these Five Transformations:*
- *Wood is generated by Wind,*
- *Fire is ignited by Heat,*
- *Metal is refined by Dryness,*
- *Water is sustained by Cold,*
- *Earth is nourished by Dampness—*
*for these are their initial conditions for establishment.*

*Though initially established through these, they ultimately disperse and decay through the same. Is this unique to the Five Phases? All things that arise from their conditions will likewise disperse through them.*

**New Annotation:** *The detailed explanation from 'In Heaven, it is the Mysterious' onward aligns with the *Treatise on the Correspondence of Yin and Yang* and the *Treatise on the Five Movements*, though the commentaries differ.*

*Thus, in Heaven, it is Qi; on Earth, it takes form. Qi—Wind, Heat, Dampness, Dryness, and Cold—senses with form—Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water—and together they generate all things. This is the grand principle of creation and transformation.*

*Yet Heaven and Earth are the upper and lower bounds of all things. Heaven covers, Earth supports; above and below interact, and all things transform and generate without omission. Thus, all things spontaneously generate, grow, transform, complete, fill, empty, renew, and change.*

Now, what is this **transformation**? It refers to the **Qi** of life reaching its peak and then renewing itself through **creation and transformation**.

Confucius said: *"It bends and completes all things without omission."*

**Left and right** are the **paths** of **Yin and Yang**; Heaven has the **six Qi** to govern below, and Earth has the **Five Movements** to pay homage above. The **current year’s cycle** is the **upper**, ruling over Heaven. The **inheriting year’s cycle** is the **lower**, ruling over Earth. When a cycle does not align with the year, the **two Qi** reside on the **right**, and the **Northern Movement** turns them; the **two Qi** reside on the **left**, and the **Southern Movement** turns them. The **movements of Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire** are governed by the **Northern** aspect, yet **left** and **right** are constantly reversed—so the **left** follows the **Southern Movement**, while the **right** follows the **Northern Movement**, and they invert.

**New Annotation:** The detailed examination of **left and right** aligns with the *Treatise on the Five Movements*, though the interpretations differ.

**Water and Fire** are the **signs** of **Yin and Yang**; **signs** mean **truth** and **verification**, while **omens** mean **precedence**. Through the **cold and heat** of **Water and Fire**, the **truth** and **precedence** of **Yin and Yang** are made manifest. **Metal and Wood** are the **end and beginning** of **generation and transformation**. Wood governs **emergence** and corresponds to **Spring**, which marks the **beginning** of **life and transformation**. Metal governs **contraction and gathering** and corresponds to **Autumn**, which marks the **completion** of **harvest and fruition**. As **end and beginning** never cease, their **transformation** is ever in motion—thus, all things endure through **generation, growth, transformation, completion, contraction, and storage**.

**New Annotation:** Referring to the *Treatise on the Correspondence of Yin and Yang*, it states: *"Heaven and Earth are the upper and lower bounds of all things; Yin and Yang are the male and female of blood and Qi; Left and Right are the paths of Yin and Yang; Water and Fire are the signs of Yin and Yang; Yin and Yang are the originators of all things."* This aligns closely with the present discourse.

**Qi** varies in abundance, and **form** fluctuates in **prosperity and decline**. Above and below **summon each other**, revealing **deficiency and excess** with clarity. **Qi** varies in abundance refers to the **three degrees** of Heaven’s **Yin and Yang**, differing in rank. **Form** fluctuates in **prosperity and decline** refers to the **Five Movements**’ **Qi**, which may be **too excessive or insufficient**. Thus, the **abundance, scarcity, prosperity, and decline** of **Yin and Yang** are summoned by Heaven and Earth, and their **deficiency and excess** are distinctly manifest and visible.

**New Annotation:** The meaning of the **three degrees** of **Yin and Yang** is further clarified in the following text’s annotations.

The **Emperor** said: *"I wish to hear how the **Five Movements** govern their seasons."* **Seasons** here means the **four seasons**. **Gui Yu Qu** replied: *"The **Five Qi** move in cycles, each completing its full term before transitioning—not solely governing the seasons. A single cycle’s duration spans three hundred sixty-five days divided by four, and only then does it shift, not abruptly ending its reign as the **King, Minister, Prisoner, or Dead** during its **interchange**. Within the **Qi exchange**, they alternate distinctly."*

The **Emperor** said: *"Please explain what you mean."* **Gui Yu Qu** replied: *"From my accumulated studies of the *Taishang Tianyuan Ce* text—*Tianyuan Ce* being the record of the **original Qi** of Heaven’s **true essence** in motion—I recite and follow its teachings. This is the **sacred scripture** of the **Age of the Divine Farmer**, passed down through ten generations of my ancestors. By the time of **Fu Xi**, it had already been inscribed on **jade tablets**, named *Ce Wen*. Since it is an **ancient sacred text**, it was thus called the *Taishang Tianyuan Ce*."*

**New Annotation:** The *Tianyi Yuanjue Ce* exists in the present age, but it is not the same as this *Taishang Tianyuan Ce* text. (刻, *jiān*—to carve, as in *qì* from *子泉切*.)

「The **Great Emptiness** vast and boundless,

It is said that the **Five Movements**#6 are governed by the **Great Emptiness**,
the **Four Seasons** follow in their appointed ranks,
and the **Six Qi**#10 reside separately yet differ in their dominion.
All things are thus **transformed and born**,
not merely by **natural spontaneity**,
but by whom else could initiate this?
Hence, it is said: *"All things derive their **beginning** from it."*
*The Book of Changes* states:
*"Great indeed is the **Heavenly Principle**,
from which all things derive their **beginning**."*
And it further declares:
*"Thus the **Heavenly Principle** governs the clouds and rain,
while all things flow into their forms."*

**Confucius** said:
*"What does Heaven speak of?
The **Four Seasons** proceed in their order,
and all things are born in their time."*
This is its meaning.

The **cosmic Qi** spreads with **true vitality**,
overseeing the **Earthly Principle**#11.
The **Great Emptiness**’s **original Qi** reaches everywhere,
and when **Qi** is balanced, **life** emerges.
Thus those who **embrace vitality** and **contain spirit**#12
are born with the **original Qi**.
**Overseeing the Earthly Principle**, it means the **Heavenly Qi** always regulates the **Earthly Qi**,
the **Way** of **transforming and giving birth**.
*The Book of Changes* states:
*"Great indeed is the **Earthly Principle**,
from which all things derive their **birth**,
thus it follows and completes the **Heavenly Principle**."*
This is its meaning.

The **Nine Stars**#13 hang resplendent,
the **Seven Luminaries**#14 revolve in their cycles.
The **Nine Stars**#15—
In the **Age of High Purity**#16, people were simple and virtuous,
returning to **originality** and **simplicity**#17.
The **Nine Stars** hung resplendent,
and the **Five Movements**#6 were harmoniously proclaimed.
In the **Middle Ages**#18, **Daoist virtue** declined slightly,
and the **stars were marked** while the **luminaries were concealed**,
hence only **seven stars** were visible.
The **Nine Stars** are named **Heavenly Cover**, **Heavenly Interior**, **Heavenly Surge**, **Heavenly Support**, **Heavenly Fowl**, **Heavenly Heart**, **Heavenly Trust**, **Heavenly Pillar**, and **Heavenly Hero**#19.
These names originate from the **method of marking stars**#20,
the **Yin-Yang Avoidance School**#21, still in use today.
The **Seven Luminaries**#22—
the **Sun, Moon, and Five Planets**#23—
are now widely adopted by the **outer barbarians**#24 as the basis for auspicious and inauspicious events.

*周*, meaning **the cycle of Heaven**#25.
*旋*, meaning **to move leftward in accordance with Heaven’s degrees**#26.
The **Five Planets**#27 each follow their own paths of **advance and retreat, elevation and depression, magnitude and diminishment**#28.

**Yin** and **Yang** alternate as days,
**softness** and **hardness** as nights#29,
for **Yin** and **Yang** are the **Heavenly Way**#30,
while **softness** and **hardness** are the **Earthly Way**#31.
Heaven **generates Yang** and **nurtures Yin**,
while Earth **softens** and **hardens** to **complete** the **Way**#32.
*The Book of Changes* states:
*"The **Way of Heaven** is established as **Yin** and **Yang**,
the **Way of Earth** is established as **softness** and **hardness**."*
This is its meaning.

**Deep and Manifest**#33 are now in their proper places,
**cold and heat**#34 are in their natural expansion and contraction.
**Deep and Manifest** are in their proper places,
meaning **human vitality** and **divine spirit**#35 each follow their natural order.
**Cold and heat** expand and contract naturally,
meaning **Yin** and **Yang** do not fail in their due course.
**Human vitality** and **divine spirit**#36 each abide in their own domains,
without intrusion or disruption,
and **Yin** and **Yang** do not fail in their sequence,
so all things find their proper place.
This is the **Way of Heaven and Earth**,
and it is also the **principle of human vitality and divine spirit**#37.

*The New Annotation* states:
*"According to *The Essential Treatise on the Most True Great Principle*#38,
how does **Deep and Manifest** work?
**Gui Bo**#39 replied:
When **two Yins**#40 meet fully, it is called **Deep**,
and when **two Yangs**#41 unite in brilliance, it is called **Manifest**.
The **correspondence of Deep and Manifest** is the **difference of cold and heat**#42.

**Life transformations** and **cosmic transformations**,
all things flourish in their appointed forms#43.
**Upper Life** refers to **sentient beings** with **awareness**#44.
**Lower Life** refers to **insentient beings** without **awareness**#45.
**Upper Transformation** refers to **forms and appearances** that are **manifest**#46.
**Lower Transformation** refers to **forms and appearances** that are **concealed**#47.
**Sentient beings** with **awareness**,
**manifest forms and appearances**,
are nurtured by **Heavenly Qi**.
**Insentient beings** without **awareness**,
**concealed forms and appearances**,
are governed by **Earthly Qi**.
Thus they are **transformed and nurtured** by the **original Qi** of **vitality and spirit**#48.
*The Book of Changes* states:
*"Heaven and Earth bind and transform,
and all things become pure and complete."*
This is its meaning.

My **ancestors** passed down this **sacred scripture** for **ten generations**,
and this is what I have received.
I have **transmitted and practiced** this **text**,
reaching **Gui Yu Qu** in the **tenth generation**,
and I dare not let it fall into **disuse or error**#49.

The **Emperor** said: *"Well done."*

What does it mean when **Qi** has **excess or deficiency**,
and **forms** have **flourishing or decline**?

**Gui Yu Qu** replied:
The **Yin** and **Yang Qi**#50 each have their own **excess or deficiency**,
hence it is said: *"three Yins and three Yangs"**#51.
Because **Qi** has **excess or deficiency**,
it is divided into **three categories**#52 as it ascends and descends.

*The New Annotation* states:
*"According to *The Essential Treatise on the Most True Great Principle*#53,
what are the **three divisions of Yin and Yang**?
**Gui Bo**#54 replied:
**Qi** has **excess or deficiency** and **different functions**#55.
**Wang Bing**#56 commented:
**Major Yin** is **true Yin**,
**Major Yang** is **true Yang**,
the next **lesser** is **Minor Yin**,
the next **lesser** is **Minor Yang**,
and again the next is **Yang Brightness**#57,
then **Ulterior Yin**#58.

**Forms** have **excessive flourishing or decline**#59,
meaning the **Five Phases**#60 each have **excess or deficiency**#61.
**Excess** means **surplus**,
**deficiency** means **shortage**#62.
When **Qi** arrives in **deficiency**,
**excess** meets it,
and when **Qi** arrives in **excess**,
**deficiency** follows it.
The **Qi of Heaven and Earth**#63 thus **waxes and wanes** in this manner,
hence it is said: *"forms have flourishing or decline"*#64.

Therefore, at the **beginning**,
when there is **excess**, it **proceeds further**,
and when there is **deficiency**, it **follows**#65.
When there is **deficiency**, it **proceeds further**,
and when there is **excess**, it **follows**#66.
Knowing how to **meet** and how to **follow**,
one can **predict the movements of Qi**#67.
It is said that **deficiency and excess** are **not constant**,
but **alternate in dominance**#68.

*始*, meaning **the year of Jia-zi**#69.
*The Treatise on the Six Microcosms* states:
*"The **Heavenly Qi** begins with **Jia**#70,
the **Earthly Qi** begins with **Zi**#71.
When **Zi** and **Jia** combine,
it is called **the year’s establishment**#72.
This is its meaning.

Thus, in the **year of Jia-zi**#73,
the **three hundred sixty-five days**,
the **Qi** one **embodies** is **deficient**#74.
Following this logic through the **Six Jia**#75,
**excess** then **deficiency**, **deficiency** then **excess**,
there are also **annual Qi cycles**#76—
years that are **neither excessive nor deficient**—
which align with the **transformations of Heaven and Earth**#77.

If **excess** follows **excess**,
or **deficiency** follows **deficiency**,
then the **Way of Heaven and Earth**#78 **deviates from its norm**,
and **disasters** and **injuries**#79 arise,
while **harsh illnesses**#80 emerge.»

「○The newly corrected edition states: According to *Six Jia Essentials: Grand Treatise on the Way*, when the **Wood** *Yun*#81 rules **Mao**#82,
the **Fire** *Yun* rules **Wu**#83,
the **Earth** *Yun* rules the **Four Seasons**#84,
the **Metal** *Yun* rules **You**#85,
and the **Water** *Yun* rules **Zi**#86,
these are called **Solar Conjunctions**#87—**the balance of Qi**#88.

Again, according to *Grand Treatise on the Five Constants*: The **Five Phases** *Yun*#89 of **Harmonious Concord**#90 align with the **upper angles**#91 and **proper angles**#92, the **upper officials**#93 and **proper officials**#94, and the **upper merchants**#95 and **proper merchants**#96.

The **Five Phases** *Yun* of **Hidden Clarity**#97 align with the **upper officials** and **proper officials**#98.

The **Five Phases** *Yun* of **Low Oversight**#99 align with the **upper merchants** and **proper merchants**, and the **upper angles** and **proper angles**.

The **Five Phases** *Yun* of **Following Transformation**#100 align with the **upper merchants** and **proper merchants**, and the **upper angles** and **proper angles**.

The **Five Phases** *Yun* of **Dry Flow**#101 align with the **upper officials** and **proper officials**.

The **Five Phases** *Yun* of **Scarlet Dawn**#102 align with the **upper wings**#103 and **proper wings**#104.

The **Five Phases** *Yun* of **Firm Completion**#105 align with the **upper wings** and **proper merchants**.

Again, *Grand Treatise on the Six Elements and Proper Cycles* states:
If a **solar conjunction**#106 does not reach the **proper cycle**#107,
it should be added to the years preceding the **Solar Conjunction**,
all of which are considered **proper years**—**the balance of Qi**.

Now, the King’s annotation claims that **aligning with Heaven’s transformations**#108 is a **non-excessive, non-deficient** state,
but this is incorrect.

**Responding to Heaven**#109 is **Heaven’s correspondence**#110,
**inheriting the year**#111 is **the year’s proper position**#112,
and their **triple confluence**#113 is **harmony**.

**Responding to Heaven** refers to:
- In the **Wood** *Yun* year, **Jue-yin**#114 appears above,
- In the **Fire** *Yun* year, **Shao-yang**#115 and **Shao-yin**#116 appear above,
- In the **Earth** *Yun* year, **Tai-yin**#117 appears above,
- In the **Metal** *Yun* year, **Yang-ming**#118 appears above,
- In the **Water** *Yun* year, **Tai-yang**#119 appears above.
These five cases are **Heavenly Qi descending**#120,
like **sealing a correspondence** with the *Yun*,
thus called **Responding to Heaven as Heaven’s correspondence**.

**Inheriting the year** refers to:
- In the **Wood** *Yun* year, the year’s proper position is **Hai-Mao**#121;
- In the **Fire** *Yun* year, the year’s proper position is **Zhen-Wu**#122;
- In the **Earth** *Yun* year, the year’s proper position is **Chen-Xu-Chou-Wei**#123;
- In the **Metal** *Yun* year, the year’s proper position is **Si-You**#124;
- In the **Water** *Yun* year, the year’s proper position is **Shen-Zi**#125.
These five cases are **the year’s proper position**,
thus called **Inheriting the year as the year’s proper position**.

**Triple confluence** refers to:
- In the **Fire** *Yun* year, **Shao-yin** appears above,
  and the year’s proper position rules **Wu**—this is the **year of Wu-Wu**#126;
- In the **Earth** *Yun* year, **Tai-yin** appears above,
  and the year’s proper position rules **Chou-Wei**—this is the **years of Ji-Chou and Ji-Wei**#127;
- In the **Metal** *Yun* year, **Yang-ming** appears above,
  and the year’s proper position rules **You**—this is the **year of Yi-You**#128.
These three cases are where **Heavenly Qi**, *Yun* **Qi**, and the year’s proper position all converge,
thus called **Triple confluence as harmony**.

The **year’s proper position** is also called **year’s proper station**#129,
and **triple confluence** is also **Heaven’s correspondence**.

*Six Jia Essentials: Grand Treatise on the Way* states:
**Heaven’s correspondence** and **Solar Conjunctions** are called **Great Yi: Heaven’s correspondence**#130.
This means **Heavenly transformations** and the year’s proper position **converge**.

○The newly corrected edition states: The details of **Heaven’s correspondence** and **Solar Conjunctions** are fully explained in *Six Jia Essentials: Grand Treatise on the Way*.
Again, it specifies:
- In the **Fire** *Yun* year, **Shao-yin** appears above,
  and the year’s proper position rules **Wu**—this is the **year of Wu-Wu**#131;
- In the **Earth** *Yun* year, **Tai-yin** appears above,
  and the year’s proper position rules **Chou-Wei**—this is the **years of Ji-Chou and Ji-Wei**#132;
- In the **Metal** *Yun* year, **Yang-ming** appears above,
  and the year’s proper position rules **You**—this is the **year of Yi-You**#133.

The Emperor asked: How do the **upper and lower**#134 **converge**?

**Gui-yu Qu**#135 replied:
Cold, heat, dryness, dampness, wind, and fire—
these are **Heaven’s Yin and Yang**#136.
The three **Yin** and three **Yang**#137 **ascend and respond** to them.

**Tai-yang**#138 is **cold**,
**Shao-yang** is **heat**,
**Yang-ming** is **dryness**,
**Tai-yin** is **dampness**,
**Jue-yin** is **wind**,
and **Shao-yin** is **fire**.
All of these **originate from Heaven**,
thus called **Heaven’s Yin and Yang**.

Wood, fire, earth, metal, and water—
these are **Earth’s Yin and Yang**#139,
**generating, growing, transforming, contracting, and storing**#140 **below** in response.

Wood is **initial Qi**#141.
Fire is **second Qi**.
**Relative Fire**#142 is **third Qi**.
Earth is **fourth Qi**.
Metal is **fifth Qi**.
Water is **final Qi**#143.
Since they **respond to Heaven** while **rooted in Earth**,
they are called **below in response**.

**Qi** is rooted in Earth,
thus called **Earth’s Yin and Yang**.

○The newly corrected edition states: According to *Six Jia Essentials: Grand Treatise on the Way*,
how does **Earthly geography**#144 **respond** to the **Six Seasonal Qi**#145?

**Qi-bo**#146 replied:
To the **right of Manifest Clarity**#147,
the **proper station** of **Minister Fire**#148,
it **retrogrades one step**#149,
and **Relative Fire**#150 **governs** it.
Then it **advances one step**,
and **Earth Qi**#151 **governs** it.
Then it **advances one step**,
and **Metal Qi** **governs** it.
Then it **advances one step**,
and **Water Qi** **governs** it.
Then it **advances one step**,
and **Wood Qi** **governs** it.
This is the meaning of **Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water, and Relative Fire as Earth’s Yin and Yang**.

Heaven **generates with Yang** and **lengthens with Yin**,
while Earth **contracts with Yang** and **stores with Yin**.
**Generating and lengthening** are **Heaven’s Way**,
and **storing and contracting** are **Earth’s Way**.
Heaven’s **Yang** dominates **generation**,
thus **generating with Yang** and **lengthening with Yin**.
Earth’s **Yin** dominates **contraction**,
thus **contracting with Yang** and **storing with Yin**.
Though Heaven and Earth differ in **high and low**,
each **operates with Yin and Yang**#152.

○The newly corrected edition states: This passage overlaps with *Grand Treatise on the Yin-Yang Correspondences and Symbols*,
but the annotations differ.
Heaven has **Yin and Yang**,
and Earth also has **Yin and Yang**.
Heaven has **Yin** to enable **Qi descent**,
while Earth has **Yang** to enable **Qi ascent**,
thus each has **Yin and Yang**.

When **Yin and Yang harmonize**,
**transformation and change**#153 **occur** accordingly.

Wood, fire, earth, metal, and water—
these are **Earth’s Yin and Yang**,
**generating, growing, transforming, contracting, and storing**.
Thus, **Yang contains Yin**,
and **Yin contains Yang**.
When **Yin-Yang Qi** reaches its **extreme**,
it **transgresses its norm**#154,
hence each **comprises both**.

*Grand Treatise on the Yin-Yang Correspondences and Symbols* states:
**Excessive cold generates heat**,
**excessive heat generates cold**.
Again, it states:
**Double Yin suppresses Yang**,
**double Yang suppresses Yin**.
This means **Qi at extremes shifts**.

Thus, **Yang contains Yin**,
and **Yin contains Yang**,
as in the **hexagrams of *Yi-jing***#155:
**Li**#156 **is hollow within**,
**Kan**#157 **is full within**.
This is their **meaning and symbol**.

To understand **Heaven and Earth’s Yin and Yang**,
**Heaven’s responding Qi** moves **dynamically without rest**,
thus **shifting rightward every five years**#158;
**Earth’s responding Qi** remains **static and fixed**,
thus **cycling through six periods**#159.

Heaven has **six Qi**,
Earth has **five stations**#160.
Heaven’s **six Qi** descend upon Earth,
while Earth’s **five stations** ascend to meet Heaven,
because **Heavenly Qi does not add to Minister Fire**#161.
With **six descending upon five**,
one **Qi** remains after five years,
thus it **shifts one station**.」

If one takes **five to follow six**,
then **six years** are required to fully exhaust **Heaven’s elemental Qi**#5,
thus completing the cycle—
this is what is meant by **"returning and beginning anew."**

**Earth’s Qi** moves **leftward**,
advancing without return,
while **Heaven’s Qi** revolves in bundles,
always **five years** into the **Minister Fire** cycle.
When the next **Qi** aligns directly above **Minister Fire**,
and **Heavenly law** does not descend upon it,
then **Minister Fire’s Qi** shifts rightward,
ascending to **Relative Fire’s** position—
thus, it is said: **"Five years, rightward shift."**

From this interplay of **movement and stillness**,
**Heaven and Earth’s ascent and descent**,
the **nature of all things** and the **mechanism of transformation** become visible.

**Movement and stillness** call to each other,
**Heaven and Earth** ascend and descend in turn,
**Yin and Yang** interweave,
and **change** thereby arises.

The **Dao of Heaven and Earth**,
its **subtle transformations**—
this is how they unfold.

Confucius said:
*"Heaven and Earth set their stations,*
*and the *Yi-jing* moves within them."*
This is what is meant.

---
**Newly corrected text states:**
According to the *Great Treatise on the Movement of the Five Phases*,
*"When Heaven and Earth meet above and below,*
*cold and heat alternate,*
*if the Qi harmonize, there is health;*
*if they clash, there is illness."*

It further states:
*"The upper [Heaven] moves rightward,*
*the lower [Earth] moves leftward,*
*revolving through the Heavenly Cycle,*
*and what remains converges again."*

The Emperor asked:
*"Does this cycle of Heaven and Earth have a fixed number?"*

Ghostly Yu Qu replied:
*"Heaven follows six as its measure,*
*Earth follows five as its standard.*
The **Heavenly Cycle** completes in **six periods**,
while the **Earthly Cycle** completes in **five years**—
**six periods** refer to the division of **six Qi**,
**five standards** refer to the division of **five stations**.

Since **one station** corresponds to **one year**,
and **one Qi** governs **one year**,
then **five years** complete one **Earthly Cycle**,
and **six years** complete one **Heavenly Cycle**.

**Completion** means exhausting all **Heavenly Qi**,
**Cycle** means traversing all **Earthly stations**.
The reason Earth has **six stations** but only **five** are spoken of
is that **Heavenly Qi** does not descend upon **Minister Fire**.

**Minister Fire** governs **illumination**,
**Relative Fire** governs **position**.
Though **Minister Fire** stands to the right of **Relative Fire**,
its name is established in the **Sovereign’s station**,
yet no **yearly Qi** is assigned to it—
thus, **Heaven’s six Qi** do not pair with their corresponding Qi in motion.
**Minister Fire’s** governance **holds its station**,
receiving **Heaven’s command** to propagate the **Fire’s decree**.

Because its name is received from Heaven,
it is called **"Minister Fire by name"**.
Because it **holds its station** and **receives command**,
it is called **"Relative Fire by position."**

When **five and six** combine,
**seven hundred twenty Qi** form one **Great Cycle**—
thirty years, **one thousand four hundred forty Qi**—
sixty years, completing one **full revolution**,
without excess or deficiency—
all this is evident.

The **calendar’s method**: one **Qi** spans **fifteen days**,
and when multiplied accordingly,
**seven hundred twenty Qi** accumulate to **thirty years**,
**one thousand four hundred forty Qi** to **sixty years**.

The Classic states:
*"When there is excess, it proceeds forward;*
*when deficient, it follows behind.*
*When deficient, it proceeds forward;*
*when in excess, it follows behind."*
Thus, within **sixty years**,
no excess or deficiency remains—
all this is evident.

---
**Newly corrected text states:**
According to the *Treatise on the Six Nodes and Hidden Symbols*,
*"Five days are called a **Hao**#6,
three **Hao** make a **Qi**,
six **Qi** make a **Season**,
four **Seasons** make a **Year**,
and each follows its governing phase.

The **Five Phases** succeed one another,
each governing in turn.
When their appointed time concludes,
they cycle endlessly—
**Seasonal Qi** is established and dispersed,
like an unbroken ring.
The **Hao** follows the same law,
so it is said:
*'If one does not know which year the Qi belongs to,*
*or the flourishing and decline of its strength,*
*or the rise of its emptiness and fullness,*
*one cannot be a skilled practitioner.'*

The Emperor said:
*"Your words encompass all of Heaven’s Qi above*
*and all of Earth’s stations below—*
*truly exhaustive!*
I wish to hear and preserve them,
to govern the people above,
to cultivate myself below,
so that the common folk may be enlightened,
Heaven and Earth may harmonize,
virtue and blessings flow downward,
and my descendants may live without worry,
passing this on to future generations without end.
Is this possible to hear?"

*"To dwell in security without remembering danger,*
*to exist without remembering annihilation—*
*this is the ultimate teaching of the Sage.*

*To seek out the people’s suffering,*
*to relieve their hidden hardships—*
*this is the Sage’s profound benevolence."*

Ghostly Yu Qu replied:
*"The mechanisms of the ultimate numbers*
*are urgent and interconnected in their subtlety.*
*Their coming can be seen,*
*their going can be traced.*

*To revere them brings prosperity,*
*to neglect them brings ruin.*
*To act without the Dao for private gain*
*will surely bring early misfortune.*

*This refers to transmitting [knowledge]*
*not to the worthy,*
*but to those of narrow mind*
*or those who seek fame and profit."*

With utmost reverence for the **Dao of Heaven**,
I now speak its **true essence**.

I solemnly swear and admonish the **Sovereign**,
then clearly proclaim the **Dao of Heaven**.

This is the **ultimate essence of truth**.

The Emperor said:
*"Whoever speaks well of beginnings*
*must also meet at the end,*
*whoever speaks well of the near*
*must also know the far.*

*Numbers are clear and evident,*
*their applications precise—*
*thus, in speech, near and far are harmonized,*
*beginning and end are without error.*

*This is the ultimate number reaching its limit,*
*the Dao without confusion—*
*this is what is called **clarity**.*

I wish you, Master,
to expound and arrange this systematically,
so that it is **concise yet complete**,
**enduring yet unbroken**,
**easy to use yet unforgettable**,
serving as the **framework and key**—
I wish to hear all of the **ultimate numbers’ essence**."

**Concise** means **selecting the essential**.
**Complete** means **without lack**.
**Enduring** means **far-reaching**.
**Essence** means **the pivotal mechanism**.

Ghostly Yu Qu replied:
*"Your question is **radiant**!
Your **Dao is clear**!
Like the **drum’s response to the striker**,
or the **echo’s response to sound**."

I have heard:
*"In **Jia-Ji years**#7, the **Earth Phase** governs;
In **Yi-Geng years**, the **Metal Phase** governs;
In **Bing-Xin years**, the **Water Phase** governs;
In **Ding-Ren years**, the **Wood Phase** governs;
In **Wu-Gui years**, the **Fire Phase** governs."*

At the **beginning of Heaven and Earth’s division**,
when **Yin and Yang** first separated,
**Heaven** distributed **five Qi**,
**Earth** arranged the **five Phases**,
the **five Phases** fixed their stations,
governing the **four directions**,
the **five Qi** dispersed their branches
through the **ten Heavenly Stems**#8.

At that time:
**Yellow Qi**#9 dominated **Jia-Ji**,
**White Qi** dominated **Yi-Geng**,
**Black Qi** dominated **Bing-Xin**,
**Green Qi** dominated **Ding-Ren**,
**Red Qi** dominated **Wu-Gui**.

Thus, **Jia-Ji years** correspond to the **Earth Phase**’s reign,
**Yi-Geng years** correspond to the **Metal Phase**’s reign,
**Bing-Xin years** correspond to the **Water Phase**’s reign,
**Ding-Ren years** correspond to the **Wood Phase**’s reign,
**Wu-Gui years** correspond to the **Fire Phase**’s reign.

In the **Great Ancient Era**, the **Sage** observed the **Qi** and recorded the **Heavenly Mandate**#10,
while the **Worthy**#11 reverently preserved it to mark the **Heavenly Primordial Qi**#12.
The lower discourse on **textual meanings** is fully complete.

**Newly corrected text** states:
*"In examining the reigns, there are **excessive**, **deficient**, and **balanced Qi**—
**Jia-Geng and Bing-Ren years**#13 govern **excessive**,
**Yi-Xin, Ding-Gui, and Wu-Ji years**#14 govern **deficient**;
this is the **Great Principle**.
The method of **balanced Qi** varies, as detailed in other texts."*

The **Emperor** asked:
*"How do the **three Yin** and **three Yang** combine in their reign?"*

**Gui-Yu Qu** replied:
*"In **Zi-Mu years**#15, the **Lesser Yin** (**少阴**, *Shǎo Yīn*)#16 appears above.
In **Chou-Wei years**#17, the **Greater Yin** (**太阴**, *Tài Yīn*)#18 appears above.
In **Yin-Shen years**#19, the **Lesser Yang** (**少阳**, *Shǎo Yáng*)#20 appears above.
In **Mao-You years**#21, the **Yang Brightness** (**阳明**, *Yáng Míng*)#22 appears above.
In **Chen-Xu years**#23, the **Greater Yang** (**太阳**, *Tài Yáng*)#24 appears above.
In **Xi-Hai years**#25, the **Jue Yin** (**厥阴**, *Jué Yīn*)#26 appears above.
The **Lesser Yin** is called the **beginning**,
and the **Jue Yin** is called the **conclusion**.
**Beginning** refers to the **uppermost**,
**conclusion** refers to the **end of three Jia and six Jia**#27.

**Newly corrected text** states:
*"In detail, **Mu-Wei-Shen-You-Xu-Hai years**#28 are **true transformations**#29,
which govern the **realized** aspects of **Qi’s transformations**#30.
**Zi-Chou-Yin-Mao-Chen-Xi years**#31 are **counter transformations**#32,
which govern the **virtual** aspects of **Qi’s transformations**#33.
This is their **Great Principle**.*

Above **Jue Yin**, the **Wind Qi**#34 of **One**#35 governs;
above **Lesser Yin**, the **dual Heat Qi**#36 governs.
Above **Greater Yin**, the **Bell Qi**#37 generates **One**;
above **Lesser Yang**, the **mutual Fire**#38 governs;
above **Yang Brightness**, the **dry Qi**#39 governs;
above **Greater Yang**, the **cold Qi**#40 governs.
This is called the **root**—
thus, it is the **Six Primordial Qi**#41.

The **three Yin** and **three Yang** are the **beginning**,
while **cold, heat, dryness, wind, fire, and dampness**#42 govern the **root**,
hence the term **"root"**.
The **Heavenly True Primordial Qi**#43 divides into **six transformations**#44,
to govern the **Kun Primordial Qi**#45’s generative functions.
Examining their **applications**, the **six transformations** differ,
but tracing their **origins**, they are all the **Heavenly True Primordial Qi**#46—
thus, they are called the **Six Primordial Qi**#47.

**Newly corrected text** states:
*"According to another version, **Six Primordial Qi** (*六元*) is rendered as **Heavenly Primordial Qi** (*天元*)."*

The **Emperor** said:
*"Illuminating is the **Dao**!
Clear is the discourse!
I request you inscribe it upon **jade tablets**,
store it in the **golden chamber**#48,
and title it **‘Record of the Heavenly Primordial Qi’**#49.

**The Great Treatise on the Five Movements (Wǔ Yùn Xíng Dà Lùn) Pien**

The Yellow Emperor sat upon the **Clear Hall**—*明堂* (Míngtáng), the **Grand Official’s Chamber**—*宫* (Gōng), establishing the **Heavenly Principles** and surveying the **Eight Extremes**—*八极* (Bā Jí), the limits of the eight directions. He examined and established the **Five Constants**—*五常* (Wǔ Cháng), the **Five Qi** that traverse the space between Heaven and Earth.

In solemn repose, he awaited the **Heavenly Harmony** of the **True Dao-Qi**. He summoned the **Heavenly Master** and asked him:

*"The Treatise states that the movements of Heaven and Earth, their stillness and activity, are governed by the **Divine Manifestations**—*神明* (Shénmíng). The ascent and descent of Yin and Yang reveal the signs of cold and heat. The newly revised text* clarifies this by detailing the Treatise’s discussion in *The Great Treatise on Yin-Yang Correspondences* and *The Great Treatise on Qi’s Transformations*, where it says: ‘The reciprocal course of Yin and Yang reveals the signs of cold and heat.’*

*I learned the principles of the Five Movements from my Master, whose teachings primarily correct the seasonal dominion of each of the Five Qi. The first year of the **Six Jia**—*六甲* (Liù Jiǎ)—determines the movement, and I have expanded upon this.*

**Ghost-Howling Qū** said: *"Earth governs Jia and Ji, Metal governs Yi and Geng, Water governs Bing and Xin, Wood governs Ding and Ren, and Fire governs Wu and Gui. Above the **Child-Midday** branches—*子午* (Zǐ Wǔ)—**Lesser Yin** presides; above the **Ox-Hen** branches—*丑未* (Chǒu Wèi)—**Greater Yin** presides; above the **Tiger-Ape** branches—*寅申* (Yín Shēn)—**Lesser Yang** presides; above the **Rabbit-Rooster** branches—*卯酉* (Mǎo Yǒu)—**Yang Brightness** presides; above the **Dragon-Dog** branches—*辰戌* (Chén Xū)—**Greater Yang** presides; and above the **Snake-Pig** branches—*巳亥* (Wèi Hài)—**Jué Yin** presides.*

*Why does this not align with Yin and Yang? The **Six Jia**—*六甲* (Liù Jiǎ)—refers to the initial year of the **Six Jia Cycle**, which is the year of Jiazi.*

**Qī Bó** replied: *"This is elucidating the **Dao**—*道* (Dào). This is the Yin and Yang of Heaven and Earth."*

*The sages of antiquity, gazing upward at Heaven’s manifestations, regulated Yin and Yang. Though the principles of Yin and Yang are not obscure, people fail to grasp the **Fundamental Origins**—*宗元* (Zōng Yuán)—and lose sight of their **Primordial Source**—*本始* (Běnshǐ). Thus, myriad doubts and disputes arise. The Yellow Emperor, fearing that profound truths and the **True Dao** might be falsely dismissed or neglected, and moved by compassion for the common folk, questioned the Heavenly Master thus:*

*The Heavenly Master understood that the **Dao** emanates from the **True**—*真* (Zhēn)—and was not speaking falsely, so he responded to the Yellow Emperor:*

*‘This is elucidating the **Dao**. This is the Yin and Yang of Heaven and Earth.’*

*The **Yin-Yang Laws** state: ‘Jia and Wei combine, Yi and Geng combine, Bing and Xin combine, Ding and Ren combine, Wu and Gui combine.’ This reflects the sages’ principle of observing Heaven’s manifestations. Otherwise, the ten **Heavenly Stems** would each occupy a distinct direction, and their interactions would be sparse and unclear.*

*Ah, how profound and distant!* **The common people go through their daily lives without knowing this.**

Thus, *The Supreme Scripture of Establishing Speech* (《Tài Shàng Lì Yán》) says:

*"My words are very easy to know,
Very easy to practice;
Yet none under Heaven can know them,
None can practice them.
This is their nature."*

○The newly corrected edition states:
*"Examine the **Heavenly Stems** of Jia and Geng—
Geng is the **Yin** of Jia,
Jia is the **Yang** of Geng.
In broad terms, this is **Yin** and **Yang**;
In narrow terms, this is husband and wife—
A matter of **Yang** and **Yin**.
I follow this principle as well.*

*"The countable **Heavenly Stems** are the **Yin-Yang** of humanity,
Yet their combinations are what can be counted.
**Yin-Yang**, when counted, can reach ten;
When extended, they can reach a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand.
But **Heavenly** **Yin-Yang**—
They are not counted by numbers,
But by **symbols** is what is meant.
Though their indications are vast,
Their understanding is shallow,
For they see only the source,
And **drums and bells** are not distant.

The Emperor said: *"I wish to hear of their origins."*

Qibo replied: *"How clear your inquiry is!
I have examined the *Scripture of the Primordial Heavenly Elements* (《Tàishǐ Tiān Yuán Cè》), and found that
**Dan** **Heaven’s** **qi** flows through **Niu** and **Wèi** in the **Wù** division;
**Zhuó** **Heaven’s** **qi**, flows through **Xīn** and **Tǎi** in the **Jǐ** division;
**Cāng** **Heaven’s** **qi**, flows through **Wēi**, **Shì**, **Liǔ**, and **Guǐ**;
**Sù** **Heaven’s** **qi**, flows through **Kàng**, **Shì**, **Xù**, and **Bì**;
**Xuán** **Heaven’s** **qi**, flows through **Zhāng**, **Yì**, **Lóu**, and **Wèi**.

The **Wù-Jǐ** division—
**Kuí** and **Bì** walls, **Jiǎo** and **Wèi** corners—
are the **gateways** of Heaven and Earth.
**Wù** belongs to **Kàn** (乾, *Heaven*), **Jǐ** belongs to **Sūn** (巽, *Wind*).
*The Scripture of the Retreating Heavenly Stems* (《Dùn Jiǎ Jīng》) says:
‘Six **Wù** form the **Heavenly Gate**,
Six **Jǐ** form the **Earthly Portal**,
Morning and evening, observe the **rain**—
with **west-north** and **east-south**.
This principle is derived from here.
**Rain** is the **use** of **Earth**,
And **moist qi** generates it,
Thus this observation is made.

The origins of **divination** and the **Dao**—
They must not be left unclear.

The Emperor said: *"Well spoken.*
*Discussions on Heaven and Earth—
They are the **up-down** of all things,
**Left-right** are the **paths of Yin-Yang**—
I do not yet understand their meaning.*
*The discussions refer to the *Record of the Heavenly Elements* (《Tiān Yuán Jì》) and the *Discourse on Yin-Yang Correspondences and Symbols* (《Yīn-Yáng Yìng-Xiàng》).*

Qibo replied:
*"The **up-down** refers to the **Yin-Yang** seen in the **year’s** **positions** above and below.
**Left-right** are the **routes of the six divisions**—
When **Yin** is seen above,
Left is **Lesser Yin**, right is **Greater Yang**;
When **Lesser Yin** is seen above,
Left is **Greater Yin**, right is **Yin**;
When **Greater Yin** is seen above,
Left is **Lesser Yang**, right is **Lesser Yin**;
When **Lesser Yang** is seen above,
Left is **Yang Brightness**, right is **Greater Yin**;
When **Yang Brightness** is seen above,
Left is **Greater Yang**, right is **Lesser Yang**;
When **Greater Yang** is seen above,
Left is **Lesser Yin**, right is **Greater Yin**.

This is what is meant by **facing north** and naming their **positions**—
It is the perspective of **facing north**.
Above refers to **south**, below refers to **north**,
Left refers to **west**, right refers to **east**.
Though the **up-down** differ, the **left-right** are distinct.

When **above** and **below** interact,
**Cold** and **Heat** alternate,
**Qi** harmonizes when they meet,
But **disease** arises when they do not.
**Wood** and **Fire** interacting,
**Metal** and **Water** interacting,
**Water** and **Wood** interacting,
**Fire** and **Earth** interacting,
**Earth** and **Metal** interacting—
These are **harmonious** encounters.

**Wood** and **Earth** interacting,
**Earth** and **Water** interacting,
**Water** and **Fire** interacting,
**Fire** and **Metal** interacting,
**Metal** and **Wood** interacting—
These are **disharmonious** encounters.

When **above** interacts with **below**, it is **orderly**;
When **below** interacts with **above**, it is **inverted**.
This is also where **stagnation** breeds **disease**—
**Earth** interacting with **Relative Fire** (相火), the **Fire** of **Wood’s** **Master** (君火).

The Emperor said: *"How can **disease** arise when **qi** harmonizes?"*

Qibo replied: *"It is when **below** interacts with **above**, out of proper **position**.
When the six **positions** interact,
Suppose **Earth** interacts with **Fire**,
**Fire** with **Wood**,
**Wood** with **Water**,
**Water** with **Metal**,
**Metal** with **Earth**—
All are cases where **below** interacts with **above**, out of proper **position**.

The principle of **parent-child**—
The **child** is **below**, the **parent** is **above**,
For the **child** to interact with the **parent**—
Is this not **inverted**?"

The Emperor said: *"How about **movement** and **stillness**?"*
*He meant the **left-right** movements of Heaven and Earth.*

Qibo replied:
*"The **above** moves to the **right**,
The **below** moves to the **left**,
**Left-right** cycles through the **Heavenly Circuit**,
And **residual qi** then **reconvenes**.
**Above** is **Heaven**, **below** is **Earth**.
**Heavenly Circuit** means **Heaven** cycles through **Earth’s** **Five Phases** positions.

**Heaven** descends the **Six Qi**,
**Earth** distributes the **Five Phases**,
**Heaven** moves **orderly** and **Earth** turns **eastward**,
After **Wood’s** **revolution**, **Heaven’s** **qi** always **residual**,
The **residual qi** does not **add** to the **Master Fire**,
But **retreats** one step to **interact** with the **Relative Fire** above,
Thus, every five **years**, when the cycle is complete,
It **retreats** one **position** and **shifts right**,
Hence the saying: **‘Left-right cycles through the Heavenly Circuit, residual qi reconvenes.’**

**Reconvenes** means **meets** or **unites**—
It speaks of **Heaven’s** and **Earth’s** **Dao**:
When five **years** have passed,
The **residual qi** shifts to **interact**,
And **reunites** with the **Five Phases’** **seated positions**,
Thus forming the **year’s laws**.

**Heavenly Circuit** refers to **Heaven’s** cycle through **Earth’s** positions,
Not the **Six Qi** of the **Heavenly Circuit**.

The Emperor said: *"I have heard **Guǐyú Qū** say:
‘**Responding to Earth** is **stillness**.
Yet now you speak of **below** moving to the **left**,
I do not understand your meaning—
I wish to hear how this **generates**."*

The interpretations differ.

○The newly corrected text states: According to *Guǐtū Qū*’s words, *"responding to Earth is stillness"*—this appears in *The Great Treatise on Heaven’s Essence* (*Tiān Yuán Jì Dà Lùn*).

**Qíbó** said: *"The movements and stabilities of Heaven and Earth, the shifts and returns of the Five Phases—even Guǐyú Qū could only grasp their superficial patterns, yet still could not fully illuminate them. If one cannot fully illuminate, there is no need to seek the #2 [path]."*

The functions of transformation and change—Heaven displays its symbols, Earth forms its shapes; the Seven Luminaries weave through the void, the Five Phases adhere to Earth. Earth is what bears the forms and kinds of life’s generation. The void is what arranges the refined *qi* that responds to Heaven. The movement of form and essence is like that of roots and branches. Gazing upward at its symbols, though distant, can be known. Observing the clustered revolutions of the Five Stars reveals the clear logic of Earth’s leftward motion.

*Lì* means "to adhere." No formed thing exists without depending on another to remain whole.

The Emperor said: *"Is Earth, then, truly ‘below’? Does its ceaseless turning make it ‘below’? Or is it ‘not’?"*

**Qíbó** replied: *"Earth is beneath humanity, yet within the boundless void. Though humanity’s dwelling may be called ‘below,’ in terms of ultimate truth, it is but one thing within the void’s expanse. The *Yijing* says: ‘Kūn is vast, bearing all things; its virtue harmonizes without limit.’ This is what is meant."*

The Emperor said: *"Is it then ‘soaring’?"*

The Emperor said: *"If the boundless void is unrestricted, how does the Earth’s body soar and remain fixed?"*
**Féng**—pronounced as in *"fú bīng"* (扶冰切). *(Note: "Ài" for "ài" in "obstruct" [碍].)*

Qíbó replied: *"The Great Qi sustains it."* The Great Qi refers to the **Zàohuà qi**—the transformative qi that upholds the boundless void. Thus, the void does not collapse, and Earth endures while Heaven lasts, because the Zàohuà qi sustains them. When this qi transforms and shifts, failing to uphold, the very vessel of the void decays.

Like falling leaves drifting in the air—descending not swiftly—it is because they ride the qi, so their descent lacks haste. All things with form, dwelling above the Earth, are sustained by the **shēnghuà qi**. Yet their vessels differ in size, and their decay varies in speed. When the qi no longer sustains them, great and small alike perish.

Dryness dries, heat steams, wind stirs, dampness moistens, cold hardens, and fire warms. Thus, cold winds rise from below, dry heat lingers above, damp qi lingers within, and fire wanders between them. Cold and heat penetrate sixfold, making the void fertile and life flourish.

Within the Earth’s body, six penetrations exist:
1. Dryness,
2. Heat,
3. Wind,
4. Dampness,
5. Cold,
6. Fire.

From dryness arises the **dry nature**; from heat, the **steaming nature**; from wind, the **moving nature**; from dampness, the **moist nature**; from cold, the **hard nature**; from fire, the **warm nature**—these are the **Six Qi of Heaven**.

Thus, when dryness prevails, the Earth grows dry;
when heat prevails, the Earth grows hot;
when wind prevails, the Earth trembles;
when dampness prevails, the Earth becomes muddy;
when cold prevails, the Earth cracks;
when fire prevails, the Earth solidifies.

The Emperor said: *"How does one observe the qi of Heaven and Earth?"*

Qíbó replied: *"The shifts of Heaven and Earth’s qi—when one qi overcomes another—do not manifest in pulse diagnosis."* For balanced qi and its reversals are observed through **formal signs**, not pulse alone. The *Pulse Method* states: *"The changes of Heaven and Earth cannot be known through pulse."* This is what is meant.

Heaven and Earth operate through qi, not fixed position, so they cannot be discerned solely by pulse.

The Emperor said: *"How then does one inquire about qi?"*

Qíbó replied: *"Observe its presence in the left and right [sides]."* Divide the four regions—left and right *cùn* and *chǐ*—and note whether the qi corresponds or fails to respond, whether it is excessive or deficient.

The Emperor said: *"How does one determine its regularity?"*

Qíbó replied: *"Conforming to the qi brings harmony; defying it brings illness."* That is, when it should be **deep but is not**, or **superficial but is not**, or **rough but is not**, or **slack but is not**, or **tight but is not**, or **large but is not**—such deviations indicate illness.

*(New annotation: According to the *Zhìzhēn Yàodà Lùn*, when the **Juéyīn qi** arrives, the pulse is **tight**; when the **Shàoyīn qi** arrives, it is **slack and curved**; when the **Tàiyīn qi** arrives, it is **slack and deep**; when the **Shàoyáng qi** arrives, it is **large and superficial**; when the **Yángmíng qi** arrives, it is **short and rough**; when the **Tàiyáng qi** arrives, it is **large and long**. If the qi arrives harmoniously, it is balanced; if excessively so, it is illness; if reversed, it is illness; if it arrives when it should not, it is illness; if it arrives prematurely, it is illness; if yin and yang are inverted, it is perilous. If the qi does not occupy its proper position, it is illness—appearing in another position. If it shifts positions, it is illness—such as when the left *cùn* shows the right’s slackness, or the right shows the left’s pulse, due to disordered qi. If it abandons its position, it is perilous—already appearing in another region, where the original organ is assaulted by hostile qi, making illness grave. If the *cùn* and *chǐ* reverse, it is death—occurring in the years of *zi*, *wǔ*, *mǎo*, and *yǒu*. "Reverse" means when the year’s yin should appear in the *cùn* pulse but instead appears in the *chǐ*, or when the year’s yang should appear in the *chǐ* pulse but instead appears in the *cùn*. If both *cùn* and *chǐ* reverse, it is called reversal. If only one reverses—either *cùn* or *chǐ*—it is not a true reversal but a failure to conform to the qi. If yin and yang intersect, it is death—occurring in the years of *yín*, *shēn*, *hài*, *sì*, *chǒu*, *wèi*, *chén*, and *xū*. "Intersect" means when the year’s yin should appear in the right pulse but instead appears in the left, or when the year’s yang should appear in the left pulse but instead appears in the right. If only one side shows this—left or right—it is not a true intersection but a failure to conform to the qi. First, establish the year to know its qi; then observe whether the left and right pulses correspond. Only then can one speak of life or death’s order.*

The *Classics* state that the seasonal qi is complete. *(New annotation: This is detailed in the *Liùyuán Zhèngjì Dàlùn*.)*

The Emperor said: *"How do cold, heat, dryness, dampness, wind, and fire interact in humans? How do they generate and transform all things?"*
**"Merge"** means inner and outer correspondence.
**"Generate"** means receiving transformation to produce life.
**"Transform"** means establishing all phenomena.

Qíbó replied: *"Wind first arises from the **shù** direction."* **Shù** is the beginning of the day, and wind is the start of instruction—Heaven’s decree to issue commands, hence wind originates from the **shù** direction.

When shadows fade and mountains darken, blue dust swirls together—this is the wind of **cliffs and valleys**. Yellow and white dust linger at dusk, the sky like a wall, with only the heavens visible—this is the wind of **rivers and marshes**. If yellow, black, and white dust descend, it is the **violent wind of mountains and wetlands**. Wind nourishes wood: as yang ascends, wind stirs, and grasses and trees flourish—thus, it is said that wind generates wood.

This is the harmonious qi’s transformation. If the wind qi acts excessively, it scatters and destroys, reaching extremes where trees are uprooted and grasses withered.

When the cycle aligns with the years of *dīngmǎo*, *dīngchǒu*, *dīnghài*, *dīngyǒu*, *dīngwèi*, or *dīngsì*, then the wind’s transformation is insufficient.

If the cycle aligns with the years of *rénshēn*, *rénwǔ*, *rénchén*, *rényín*, *rénzǐ*, or *rénxū*, then the wind’s transformation is excessive for all things.

○The newly corrected text states: Examining Wang’s annotation on the surplus and deficiency of *dīng* and *rén* cycles, some mistakenly take *dīngmǎo*, *dīnghài*, *dīngsì*, *rénshēn*, and *rényín*—five years—as the *Tiānfú* (Heaven’s Omen), aligning with the *Tiānfú* and *zhèngsuì* (rectified years), not distinguishing surplus or deficiency. This is said to be the balanced *mùyùn* (Wood cycle), and Wang’s annotation is thus incorrect—this is ignorance of the Great Principle.

Further refinement is sought, yet even excluding these five years does not exhaust the matter. The same applies to the cycles of Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water below.

Wood generates sourness.
All things with a sour taste originate from the transformation of Wood qi.

Sourness generates the liver.
The sour taste enters the stomach and nourishes the liver’s storage.

The liver generates sinews.
The sour taste enters the liver, where its essence spreads and forms sinews and membranes.

Sinews generate the heart.
When the nourishing qi of sourness has fully nourished the sinews and membranes, its essence flows onward and enters the heart.

In Heaven, this corresponds to the **Mysterious**—that is, the **Obscure and Profound**.

The **Obscure** reaches its end, and the **Bundle** [方] turns white.
At the **Beginning** [初] of **Tiger** [寅], the Heavenly hue reverses to black,
and the **Great Void** [太虚] converges—
the **Obscure** [玄] symbol in Heaven is thus visible.

○The newly corrected text states: In the seven sentences of *"Heaven's Obscure generates the transformative qi"* [天为玄至化生气七句],
it universally describes the Great Principle of the Six *Qi* and Five *Xing* [五行] in their generative transformations,
not exclusive to the **Bundle** [方].
Yet the Wang commentary says *"Obscure"* [玄] refers to the end of **Obscure** [丑] and the beginning of **Tiger** [寅],
when the Heavenly hue turns black—
this interpretation is limited only to the **Bundle** [方], excluding other directions,
and thus fails to grasp the full meaning.

In humans, this is the **Dao** [道].
The **Dao** of rectification is the governance of **nourishment** [生养].
On Earth, it is **transformation** [化].
**Transformation** [化] is the act of **generation** [生化].
Only after **transformation** [化] does all life emerge,
for all things are born from the **transformative qi** [化气].

**Transformation** [化] generates the **Five Flavors** [五味].
Metals, jade, soils, and stones,
grasses, trees, vegetables, and fruits,
roots, stems, branches, and leaves,
blossoms, husks, kernels, and seeds—
all sentient and unsentient alike,
are produced by Earth’s **transformation** [化].

The **Dao** [道] generates **wisdom** [智].
**Wisdom** [智] is **right knowledge** [正知] and **far-reaching deliberation** [虑远].
Right knowledge prevents doubt in affairs,
far-reaching deliberation avoids peril.
When the **Dao** [道] governs, its principles align with **wisdom** [智].
The *Ling Shu Jing* [《灵枢经》] says:
*"To deliberate and act upon matters is called wisdom."*

The **Obscure** [玄] generates **spirit** [神].
**Spirit** [神] operates without fixed form,
deep and subtle, beyond measure.
It manifests in visible yet hidden ways,
and few can predict its movements.
Thus within the **Obscure and Profound** [玄冥],
**spirit** [神明] dwells concealed yet unseen—
this is the **Obscure** generating **spirit** [神明].

**Transformation** [化] generates **qi** [气].
Flitting, wandering, and branching movements,
scales, shells, fur, feathers, and hair—
the five varied transformations,
internally linked to **spirit** [神机],
though encompassed by the **Five Flavors** [五味],
their inherent natures differ,
hence it is also said: **Transformation** generates **qi** [气].

These seven preceding sentences
universally describe the Great Principle of the Six *Qi* and Five *Xing* in their generative transformations,
not exclusive to the **Bundle** [方].
○The newly corrected text states:
According to the *"Great Treatise on the Interchange of Yin and Yang"* [《阴阳应象大论》]
and the *"Great Treatise on the Heavenly Elements"* [《天元纪大论》],
there is no sentence on **Transformation** generating **qi** [化生气].

**Spirit** [神] in Heaven is **Wind** [风].
It stirs and disrupts, splitting and dispersing—
these are the **transformations** of **Wind** [风之化].
It shakes, pulls, and uproots—
these are the **functions** of **Wind** [风之用].
When **Minor Yin** [厥阴] is above,
**Wind** transforms in Heaven;
when **Minor Yin** is below,
**Wind** courses upon Earth.

On Earth, it is **Wood** [木].
Long, short, curved, or straight—
these are the **forms** of **Wood** [木之体].
Raising stems and activating mechanisms—
these are the **functions** of **Wood** [木之用].
In **form** [体], it is **sinews** [筋].
Tendons, ligaments, and networks—
these are the **forms** of **sinews** [筋之体],
flexible yet resilient—
these are the **functions** of **sinews** [筋之用].
In **qi** [气], it is **gentleness** [柔].
When **Wood**’s **transformative qi** [化] spreads and **Wind**’s **transformative qi** courses,
things assume a **gentle** yet **intertwined** nature.

In **storage** [藏], it is the **liver** [肝].
The liver has two **lobes** [布叶],
one small, resembling the **splitting bark** [甲拆] of **Wood** [木].
Each has branching networks,
traversing the **abdomen** [豚游中],
to propagate **Wood**’s **yang-harmonizing qi** [阳和之气].
It is the **residence of the soul** [魂之官].
It functions as the **general’s office** [将军之官], from which **strategy** [谋虑] emerges.
When **Wood**’s **transformative qi** [化] is excessive in the **Ding year** [丁岁],
the liver’s **storage** and **networks** [经络] first succumb to **evil** [邪] and manifest **disease** [病].
The **gallbladder** [胆府] is the same.

Its **nature** [性] is **warmth** [暄].
**Warmth** [暄] is **gentleness** [温], the **nature** of **Wood** [木].
Its **virtue** [德] is **harmony** [和].
It spreads **harmonious qi** [和气] across all things—
this is the **virtue** of **Wood** [木之德].
○The newly corrected text states:
According to the *"Great Treatise on the Interchange of Qi"* [《气交变大论》],
its **virtue** is to spread **harmony** [敷和].

Its **function** [用] is **movement** [动].
**Wind** stirs and thus **moves** [动],
without **Wind**, all things remain still.
○The newly corrected text states:
According to the **function** of **Wood** being **movement** [动],
the **excessive** **Fire** [火太过] also manifests as **movement** [动],
since **Wood** and **Fire** govern **violent** and **rapid** actions,
hence both are **movement** [动].

Its **color** [色] is **bluish-green** [苍].
Among all formed things,
when they undergo **Wood**’s **transformation** [化],
their external hues appear faintly **bluish-green** [薄青之色].
Now in the **Bundle**’s [束方] Earth,
grasses and trees above display **bluish-green** [苍].
In the **Ding year** [丁岁],
**bluish-green** things also show **white** and **yellow**,
their colors impure.

Its **transformation** [化] is **luxuriance** [荣].
**Luxuriance** [荣] is **beautiful color** [美色].
Among the four seasons,
when things display **blossoms** [华] and **luxuriance** [荣],
their hues are fresh and bright—
these are all generated by **Wood**’s **transformation** [化].
○The newly corrected text states:
According to the *"Great Treatise on the Interchange of Qi"* [《气交变大论》],
its **transformation** generates **luxuriance** [化生荣].

Its **creature** [虫] is **hair** [毛].
When all things emerge,
hair appears like **fur upon skin** [在皮].
Its **governance** [政] is **dispersion** [散].
It disperses **generative qi** [生气] across all things.
○The newly corrected text states:
According to the *"Great Treatise on the Interchange of Qi"* [《气交变大论》],
its **governance** is **relaxation and contraction** [舒卷].
In detail:
**Wood**’s **governance** is **dispersion** [散],
**Wood**’s **balanced governance** is **relaxation and dispersion** [发散],
**Wood**’s **excessive governance** is **dispersion** [散],
**Earth**’s **insufficient qi** is **dispersion** [散],
**Metal**’s **function** is **scattering and falling** [散落],
**Wood**’s **disaster** is **scattering and falling** [散落].
Thus there are six variations of **dispersion** [散],
yet only two meanings:
One is **dispersion** as **relaxation and spreading** [发散之散], which is **Wood**’s **qi** [气].
Two is **dispersion** as **scattering and falling** [散落之散], which is **Metal**’s **qi** [气] in action.

Its **command** [令] is **propagation and dispersion** [宣发].
The **yang-harmonizing qi** [阳和之气]
relaxes and then disperses.

Its **transformation** is **crushing and pulling** [摧拉]—
**Crushing** [摧] is the completion of skill [技成者也].
○*Newly corrected:* According to *Treatise on the Exchange of Qi*, its **transformation** is **vibration and emission** [振发].

Its **blue-green** turns to **falling** [陨]—
**Falling** [陨] means **plummeting** [坠].
When violent winds arise, grasses are uprooted and trees topple.
○*Newly corrected:* According to *Treatise on the Exchange of Qi*, its **disaster** is **scattering and falling** [散落].
(*Blue-green*, pronounced *shè-jǐng*).

Its **flavor** is **sour**—
All things that transform and change into sour flavors
are the **Wood qi**’s [气] **successes and failures** [成败].
Now, in the wilds of the southern regions,
sour tastes abound.

Its **will** is **anger**—
**Anger** is a **straightforward cry** [直声].
Anger is used to **awe** [威] things.
Anger harms the **liver**—
All things, when pushed to their **extreme**, inevitably harm themselves.
Anger arises from the **liver**, yet it **returns to harm the liver** [反伤肝藏].
**Sorrow** [忧] overcomes **anger**—
When sorrow arises, anger ceases, confirming its victory.
○*Newly corrected:* In detail, the **Five Wills**—**sorrow** [悲] should be **grief** [忧], for grief harms the **mind** [意], while sorrow harms the **soul** [魂], hence it is said that sorrow overcomes anger.

**Wind** harms the **liver**—
Just as wind **snaps wood** [折木],
wind is born from **Wood**, yet it **snaps it in return**,
its **extreme use** leading to decline.
○*Newly corrected:* According to *Treatise on the Correspondence of Yin and Yang*, wind harms the **sinews** [筋].
**Dryness** overcomes **wind**—
Wind originates from **Wood**, while **dryness** is the **transformation of Metal**;
wind’s excess is checked by **dryness**, and when the **liver** is excessive, it is treated with **cold**—
**cold** clears and directs, the **Metal qi** in action.

**Sour** harms the **sinews**—
**Sour** drains the **liver qi** [写肝气];
when drained excessively, it harms its **qi**.
*The Spirit Pivot* says:
*"Sour travels to the sinews—
when sinews are diseased, avoid excessive sour foods."*
This is why.
**Traveling to the sinews** [走筋] means **rapidly propagating its qi** [宣行其气速疾].
Qi, blood, flesh, and bone are interrelated.
○*Newly corrected:* In detail, the annotation states:
This is from *Plain Questions: Illuminating the Five Qi*, not *The Spirit Pivot*.
According to *The Canon of the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches*, this is from *Plain Questions*;
Wang’s annotation mistakenly attributes it to *The Spirit Pivot*.

**Bitter** overcomes **sour**—
**Bitter** is the **Metal flavor**, thus it overcomes **Wood’s sour**;
sour’s excess is countered by **bitter**.

The **south** generates **heat**—
The product of **excessive yang**.
This is the **Minister Fire**’s and **Sovereign Fire**’s governance.
The **Great Void** grows dim, like **fine dust**,
mountains and rivers all **glow**—
the **heat qi** in action.
The **Great Light** is obscured, its hue like **cinnabar**,
a **stifling heat**’s essence.
If **crimson clouds** surge violently,
leaves accumulate in layers,
swelling then contracting—
the **heat** of **cliffs and valleys**.

**Heat** generates **fire**—
The **extreme heat qi**, where **fire’s circulation** is **flourishing and bright**,
thus it is said that **heat generates fire**.
**Fire** is the **transformation of excessive yang**.

When **heat qi** applies its **transformation**,
it becomes **flaming heat and stifling warmth**;
its **extreme transformation** leads to **burning, scorching, melting, and dissolving**.
When the **celestial stems** **Geng** (癸) and **Yi** (乙) align with **Earthly Branches** **You** (酉), **Wei** (未), **Si** (巳), **Mao** (卯), **Chou** (丑), or **Hai** (亥),
then **heat transformation** is **insufficient**.
If they align with **Wu** (戊) and **Chen** (辰), **Le** (寅), **Zi** (子), **Xu** (戌), **Shen** (申), or **Wu** (午),
then **heat transformation** is **excessive**.

**Fire** has **Sovereign Fire** and **Minister Fire**,
thus it is said **heat generates fire**, and again, **fire**.
**Fire** generates **bitter**—
All **bitter** flavors originate from **fire’s transformation**.
Sweet things, when scorched by fire, turn **charred and bitter**—
bitter arises from **fire’s transformation**, a clear sign.

**Bitter** generates the **heart**—
Bitter substances enter the **stomach** and transform into the **heart**,
thus in **Geng** (癸) years, **bitter transformation** is **scant**,
while in **Xu** (戌) years, it is **abundant**.

The **heart** generates **blood**—
Once **bitter** has transformed into the **heart**,
its **spread** generates **blood vessels**.
**Blood** generates the **spleen**—
After **bitter** has **nourished the blood**,
it flows and transforms, **nourishing the spleen**.

Its manifestation in **Heaven** is **heat**—
Also the **transformation of the divine qi**.

The **summer heat** and **oppressive warmth** are the **transformation of heat**—
**Blazing and boiling** are the **functions of heat**.

When the year belongs to **Shao Yin** and **Shao Yang** above,
then **heat transforms in Heaven**;
when below,
then **heat spreads upon the Earth**.

On Earth, it becomes **fire**—
**Radiant and luminous**, the **substance of fire**.
**Flickering and scorching**, the **function of fire**.

In the body, it becomes the **pulse**—
**Circulating blood and qi**, the **substance of the vessels**.
**Obstruction or release, emptiness or fullness**, the **function of the vessels**.

The **collateral vessels** are the same.

In **qi**, it becomes **breath**—
**Breath**, the **lengthening** [of life].

In the **viscera**, it becomes the **heart**.
The **heart** takes the form of an **unopened lotus**, the **celestial true qi** within—
with **nine hollows** to guide the **celestial true qi**,
the **abode of the spirit**.

It is the **sovereign’s organ**, whence **divine wisdom** emerges.
In **Geng** years, the **heart** and **channels** receive **evil** and fall ill,
as does the **Small Intestine palace**.

Its **nature** is **summer heat**—
**Summer heat**, the **heat** of the **heart’s qi-nature**.

Its **virtue** is **clarity**—
**Manifest and luminous**; the **new annotation** states:
*"According to the* **Great Treatise on Qi Exchange***, its virtue is **manifest and clear**."*

Its **function** is **restlessness**—
**Fire’s nature is restless**, ever **unsettled**.

Its **color** is **red**—
All **transformed things** borne by **fire’s transformation**
bear the **crimson and vermilion hues**;
today, in the **Southern lands**, even **grasses and trees** bear **reddish tints**.
In **Geng** years, **red things** also bear **black and white**.

Its **transformation** is **luxuriance**—
**Luxuriance**, the **proliferation and flourishing**; the **new annotation** states:
*"According to the* **Great Treatise on Qi Exchange***, its transformation is **proliferant and luxuriant**."*

Its **insects and feathers**—
**Varying in length**, mirroring **fire’s form**.

Its **governance** is **clarity**—
**Illuminating and manifest**, with **no concealment**, the **governance of fire**.
The **new annotation** states:
*"According to the* **Great Treatise on Qi Exchange***, its **rectification is luminous**."*

Again, it is noted:
*"Fire’s governance is clarity, water’s qi is clarity—
though both are called ‘clarity,’ they differ:
Fire’s clarity shines **externally**, water’s clarity shines **internally**;
though the name is the same, their essence is distinct."*

Its **decree** is **oppressive heat**—
**Oppressive**, meaning **abundant**; **heat**, meaning **warmth**—
speaking of **abundant heat**, like **steaming**.
The **new annotation** states:
*"The detailed commentary says ‘oppressive’ means ‘abundant,’ but this is unclear.
According to Wang Bing’s annotation on the* **Great Treatise on the Five Constant Governances***, it should be understood as:
‘Oppressive’ means **stifling and stagnant**, not free-flowing.**
This is the correct interpretation."

Its **change** is **flaming and scorching**,

The heat is **extreme**, blazing and radiant—
scorching stone, melting gold—
the **ultimate transformation** of Fire.

○New annotation states:
According to the *Great Treatise on Qi Exchange*, its change is **"consuming and scorching."**

Its **greenish glow** is **brilliant**,
**Overturning** mountains and rivers,
**Spreading** to houses and dwellings—
the **disaster** of Fire.

○New annotation states:
According to the *Great Treatise on Qi Exchange*, its disaster is **"overturning and entangling."**

Its **taste is bitter**—
when things transform under Fire’s influence and bear **bitterness**,
all such **bitter flavors** arise from Fire’s **dispersal and combination**.
Now, in the southern wilds, many creatures are **bitter**.

Its **emotion is joy**.
Joy is **delight and pleasure**, harmonizing the mind.
Yet **excessive joy harms the heart**—
for though joy **emanates from the heart**, it **in turn harms it**,
just as **wind snaps wood**.
When **excessive**, the **qi is exhausted**, hence the **injury** appears.

**Fear conquers joy**;
when **fear dominates**, all **delight and pleasure vanish**—
the principle of conquering joy is evident when **seen with the eyes of the Dao**.
Fear is the **qi of Water**.

Heat **injures qi**—
when the **heavens grow hot**, the **qi lies dormant and unseen**;
when **humans grow hot**, the **qi becomes rapid and gasping**.
The way heat **injures qi** is **verifiable in logic**.
This refers to **extreme heat**; the **qi of lesser heat** still **nurtures all things**.

The *Great Treatise on Yin-Yang Correspondences* states:
**"Robust Fire disperses qi; meager Fire generates qi."**
This is its meaning.

**Cold conquers heat**;
when **cold prevails**, heat **retreats**,
when **yin flourishes**, yang **declines**—
to **subdue heat with cold** is to **seek victory**.

**Bitterness injures qi**—
its harm is **much like this**.
Bitterness **injures qi** because of its **dryness**.
If **heat is added**, the injury is **even greater**.
How is this proven?
**Drinking alcohol causes shortness of breath**,
and **excess causes gasping**—this is **undeniable**.
If **bitter-cold substances** are consumed **excessively over time**,
they **further inflame Fire**, also **injuring qi**.
Temporarily treating with **prescriptions** aligns with **meager Fire**,
thus **restoring qi**.

○New annotation states:
This treatise outlines **three categories of injury**:
The **East** says: **Wind harms the liver**, sourness harms **sinews**;
The **Center** says: **Dampness harms flesh**, sweetness harms the **spleen**;
The **West** says: **Aromatic pungency harms skin and hair**—these are **self-inflicted injuries**.
The **South** says: **Heat harms qi**, bitterness harms **qi**;
The **North** says: **Cold harms blood**, saltiness harms **blood**—these are **injuries to what one conquers**.
The **West** says: **Heat harms skin and hair**—this is **injury from what conquers one**.
Thus, the **five directions’ injuries** follow **three patterns**;
if referring to *The Great Essentials*, all are said to be **self-inflicted**.

**Saltiness conquers bitterness**.
Alcohol **dissolves with salt**—**nature’s logic is clear**.
Fire’s **bitter dominance** is **checked by Water’s saltiness**.

The **Center generates dampness**—
the **Center** is **Earth**; high mountains hold **damp soil**,
springs rise from the earth, waters **originate in mountains**,
clouds form in **rocky valleys**—this is its **manifestation**.
**Innate nature** is **internal and latent**;
when **activated**, it **becomes functional**—
then **rain descends, clouds surge**,
and the **Center generates dampness**—
this is **undeniably true**.
Thus, the **seasonal records** note **soil moisture and maritime heat in the sixth month**—
this is what is meant.

*(Dampness, pronounced "rǔ.")*

**Dampness generates Earth.**
Dampness *qi* is internally latent within Earth;
Earth’s substance is thereby complete.
When dampness is present, Earth is born;
when dryness prevails, Earth dies.
Death brings decline to all things,
life fosters growth and flourishing—
this is the transformation of dampness *qi*.

When dampness *qi* exerts its influence,
Earth takes form while clouds surge and rain descends.
At its extreme, it causes sudden collapse—**landslides**.

When the **Celestial Stem-Branch combinations** of *jǐyǐ* (己巳), *jǐmǎo* (己卯), *jǐhòu* (己丑), *jǐhài* (己亥), *jǐyǒu* (己酉), or *jǐwèi* (己未) dominate,
then dampness transformation is insufficient.
When *jiǎzǐ* (甲子), *jiǎxū* (甲戌), *jiǎshēn* (甲申), *jiǎwǔ* (甲午), *jiǎchén* (甲辰), or *jiǎyín* (甲寅) dominate,
then dampness transformation is excessive.

**Earth generates sweetness.**
Sweetness in things originates from Earth’s transformative power.
Sweetness nourishes the **Spleen**—
sweet substances first enter the **Spleen** before the **Stomach**,
so in **Celestial Stem-Branch combinations of *jǐ*** (己), sweetness is diminished,
while in **combinations of *jiǎ*** (甲), sweetness is abundant.

The **Spleen generates flesh**—
sweetness entering the **Spleen**,
its *qi* spreads and nourishes,
producing fat and muscle.

**Flesh nourishes the Lungs**—
after sweetness *qi* has nourished the flesh,
it flows and transforms,
fostering the **Lungs**—
this is its generative function.

In the **Heavenly realm**, dampness is **divine transformation**—
soft, moist, and heavy, its **marvelous influence**.
Dust and clouds gather, rain descends—
this is dampness’s **manifestation**.
When the **Great Yin** (太阴) is above,
dampness transforms in the **Heavenly realm**;
when below,
dampness transforms on the **Earth**.

On Earth, dampness is **Earth**—
gentle, steady, and tranquil,
its form shifts with gathering and dispersing,
giving rise to all things—
this is Earth’s **substance**.
It contains filth and conceals impurity,
quiet and yielding to the people—
the **root of transformation**,
this is Earth’s **virtue**.

*(New annotation: It is noted that "quiet and yielding to the people" is Earth’s virtue. The phrase "yielding to the people" may be a typographical error.)*

In **physical form**, dampness is **flesh**—
enveloping sinews and bones,
its *qi* emanates between them—
this is flesh’s **function**.
When its density is irregular,
the **interior and exterior** are obstructed—
this is flesh’s **disorder**.

In **energetic essence**, dampness is **fullness**—
Earth’s *qi* in transformation
fills all phenomena.

In **the body’s storage**, dampness is the **Spleen**—
its shape resembles a **horse’s hoof**,
enclosing the **Stomach’s precincts**,
mirroring Earth’s form.
The **meridian networks’ *qi****
converge and circulate within,
nurturing the **True Spirit**—
the **abode of intent**.
It governs the **granary’s vigilance**,
from which transformed substances emerge.

When **Celestial Stem-Branch combinations of *jǐ*** (己) dominate,
the **Spleen** and **meridians** suffer **pathogenic influence**, manifesting as **illness**.

*(New annotation: Examining the four storage organs—Liver, Heart, Lungs, Kidneys—
each is annotated as a "palace" (府).
Only this passage omits the **Stomach’s palace** (胃府),
likely due to missing text.)*

Its **nature** is **both still and encompassing**—
encompassing, meaning it harmonizes **cold, heat, warmth, and chill**.
*The White Tiger’s Discourse* states:
*The Spleen’s name signifies "uniting"—*
it unites the **four *qi*** (四气).

Its **virtue** is **moistening**—
**slimy dampness** nourishes all—
this is Earth’s **virtue**.

*(New annotation: According to *The Grand Theory of *Qi* Exchange and Transformation*,
its virtue is **steaming dampness**.)*

Its **manifestation** is **transformation**—
transformation, meaning it harmonizes the **five processes** (五化),
uniting the **four *qi*** (四化) of **wind, heat, dryness, and cold**,
as in **growth, maturation, harvest, storage, and nurturing**,
cycling through all things.

Its **color** is **yellow**—
when things undergo Earth’s transformation,
their **surface reveals a refined yellow hue**.
Now, the central lands,
where grasses and trees flourish,
all bear this **yellow** shade.
When **Celestial Stem-Branch combinations of *jǐ*** (己) dominate,
yellow-hued things also bear **blue and black**.

*(Dampness, pronounced "shī.")*

Its **transformation** is **fulfillment**—
fulfillment, meaning **completeness**.
Where Earth’s transformation reaches,
all things become **full and plump**.
*(New annotation: According to *The Grand Theory of *Qi* Exchange and Transformation*,
its transformation is **abundant and complete**.)*

Its **creatures** are **scaled and shelled**—
they bear **furless, armored hides**.

Its **governance** is **tranquility**—
tranquility, meaning **stillness**.
Earth’s nature is **settled and calm**.
*(New annotation: According to *The Grand Theory of *Qi* Exchange and Transformation*,
its governance is **peaceful and still**.)*
**Detailed:** Earth’s governance is tranquil,
yet when Water **overflows**, its governance also becomes tranquil—
for when Water overflows, Earth below receives it,
and thus its governance too is tranquil.

Its **command** brings **clouds and rain**—
the spread of damp *qi* in transformation.

Its **changes** are **sudden downpours**—
**movement**, the opposite of stillness.
When Earth moves, it loses its nature—
wind stirs it, unsettled, and rain pours long.
Prolonged, it erodes walls and banks,
turning them back to Earth.
*(New annotation: According to *The Grand Theory of *Qi* Exchange and Transformation*,
its change is **abrupt downpour**.)*

Its **excess** causes **flooding and collapse**—
**excess**, meaning **prolonged rain**; **collapse**, meaning Earth’s erosion.
*(New annotation: According to *The Grand Theory of *Qi* Exchange and Transformation*,
its disaster is **prolonged rain and collapse**.)*

Its **flavor** is **sweet**—
when things undergo Earth’s transformation,
their changes yield **sweetness**.
Now, the Central Plains’ lands,
where things are born, bear flavors **sweet and mild**.

Its **spirit** is **thought**—
thought, which **condenses into mist**.
*(New annotation: According to *The Spirit Pivot Classic*:
*"When the mind stores changes, it is called thought."*)
Thought **harms the Spleen**—
excessive thought **wears the mind**; overdoing it harms the Spleen.
**Anger overcomes thought**—
anger prevents thought; when furious, one forgets danger,
and thus its mastery is clear.
When thought is excessive and unresolved,
anger is used to temper it—
a method to **harmonize one’s nature**.

**Dampness harms flesh**—
when dampness is extreme, it becomes Water;
Water overflows, causing swelling.
When Water drains away, the body’s flesh atrophies—
the harm to flesh is evident.

**Wind overcomes dampness**—
Wind is Wood *qi*, thus it overcomes Earth’s dampness.
When dampness is extreme, Wind **restrains it**.

**Sweetness harms the Spleen**—
excessive indulgence.
*(New annotation: According to *The Grand Theory of Yin-Yang Correspondences*,
sweetness harms **flesh**.)*
**Sourness overcomes sweetness**—
when sweetness is excessive, sourness **restrains it**,
to rescue the Spleen’s *qi*.

---
**West generates dryness**—
when Yang *qi* descends, Yin *qi* rises again,
the air becomes crisp and winds strong—
thus dryness arises.
The dust of cliffs and valleys, the blue-green of rivers and plains,
the misty haze over floating grasses and trees,
when viewed from afar—
this is Metal *qi* taking form, the transformation of dryness.

At night, white mist rises,
light as fine vapor,
uniform in near and far,
stars and moon shining brightly—
this is when all things reach Yin completion,
also Metal *qi* taking form, the *qi* of white dew.

The heavens grow hazy with dust,
*qi* stagnant, yellow and black,
vision obscured, no wind yet movement—
from Yin’s Yang, like clouds like mist—
this is **killing *qi***.
Also Metal *qi* taking form, the *qi* of frost.

In mountain valleys and rivers,
a lone mist hangs like fog,
*qi* stagnant and surging,
bleak and foreboding,
objects indistinct within arm’s reach—
this is **killing *qi** about to act**,
also Metal *qi* taking form, the *qi* of **movement**.

Heavy rain and prolonged downpours,
harmonious *qi* rising from the West,
clouds rolling, sunlight breaking through,
the heavens clearing—
dryness generated in the West,
its meaning confirmed.

If the Western Wind rises fiercely,
trees bend, clouds surge—
this is **dryness and dampness contending**,
*qi* unable to prevail,
thus rain will return.
Yet when the Western Wind brings rain and then clears,
this is the **heaven’s constant *qi***.
If Eastern Wind stops the rain,
or Western Wind brings rain again,
then clears on its own—
observing this, one sees
*qi* moves back and forth,
movement shifts between dryness and dampness,
their changing forms differing in function.

From this, it is clear:
the *qi* of Heaven and Earth
**harmony** is supreme.
When *qi* erupts violently and recklessly,
what it cannot overcome
often **reverses back**.

---
**Dryness generates Metal**—
*qi* sharp and winds cutting,
Metal’s ringing tones carry far—
the truth of dryness’ generation
is evident to sight and hearing.
Thus, dryness’ transformation
makes all things **firm and steadfast**.

When dryness’ changes reach their extreme,
the heavens grow **bleak and killing**,
*qi* of destruction spreads,
all fear it,
grasses and trees wither and fall.

When the **Celestial Stem-Branch combinations of *yǐ*** (乙)
dominate—
the years **Jiazi, Yichou, Yingmao, Yinsi, Yisi, Yiyou**—
then dryness’ transformation is **insufficient**.
When the **Geng** (庚) combinations dominate—
the years **Gengzi, Gengchen, Gengxin, Gengwu, Gengshen, Gengxu**—
then dryness’ transformation is **excessive**.
The seasons’ *qi* differs,
thus their generations vary.

---
**Metal generates *xīn*** (辛)—
things bearing **pungent flavors**
all originate from Metal’s transformation.
*Pungent flavors* enter the Stomach,
first reaching the **Lungs**,
thus in *yǐ*-years, pungent flavors are **sparse**,
in *gēng*-years, they are **abundant**.

The **Lungs generate skin and hair**—
when pungent flavors enter the Lungs,
*qi* spreads from the Lungs’ storage,
nourishing skin and hair.

**Skin and hair generate the Kidneys**—
when pungent *qi* enters skin and hair,
it flows downward, generating *qi* for the Kidneys’ storage.

In Heaven, it is **dryness**—
the **manifestation** of *qi*.
**Mist and dew**, crisp and sharp—
the transformation of dryness.
**Bleakness and killing, withering and falling**—
the function of dryness.

When **Yangming** (陽明) is above,
dryness transforms **in Heaven**.
When **Yangming** is below,
dryness acts **on Earth**.

On Earth, it is **Metal**—
**leather and armor**, firm and rigid—
Metal’s **form**.
**Sharp blades and edges**—
Metal’s **function**.
*(New annotation: Alternative text reads *kuò* [括] instead of *zuò* [钴].)*

In the **body**, it is **skin and hair**—
**soft and resilient**, enclosing—
the form of skin and hair.
**Seeping and draining fluids**—
the function of skin and hair.

In *qi*, it is **completion**—
when things undergo Metal’s transformation,
they become **firm and complete**.

In the **viscera**, it is the **Lungs**.
The Lungs resemble a person’s **shoulders**,
with two broad lobes,
many small lobes within,
twenty-four hollow spaces arranged,
distributing pure and impure *qi* to all viscera,
**storing the *pò*** (魄).

「The **Lungs** are the **official** of transmission—
from them, **governance and regulation** arise.

When the **Earthly Branch (乙)** year comes,
the Lungs and **meridians** receive **evil** and fall ill.
The **Large Intestine** is likewise.

Its **nature** is **freezing**—
freezing, **clearing**—
this is the **nature** of the Lungs.
Its **virtue/power** is **clearing**—
Metal’s **virtue/power** lies in its **freezing and clearing** nature.
*(New annotation: The *Xin Jiao Zheng* [新校正] cites *Qi Jiao Bian Da Lun* [气交变大论] as stating: its virtue is **cleanliness**, its function is **binding**.)*

Its **color** is **white**—
when things undergo Metal’s transformation,
they display the **pure and refined** hues of **white and black**.
Now, in the **western wilds**,
both **grass and trees** bear white tones.
In the **Earthly Branch (乙)** year,
white things also take on **red and greenish-blue** hues.

Its **transformation** is **convergence**—
convergence, **gathering**—
Metal’s transformation makes things **firm and gathered**.
*(New annotation: The *Xin Jiao Zheng* cites *Qi Jiao Bian Da Lun* [气交变大论] as stating: its transformation is **tight convergence**.)*

The **metal** within it is **armored**—
**armored shells**, the emblem of Metal’s **firmness**.
Its **government** is **sharp**—
sharp, **precise and piercing** ahead.
*(New annotation: The *Xin Jiao Zheng* cites *Qi Jiao Bian Da Lun* [气交变大论] as stating: its government is **sharp and incisive**.)*

Its **command** is **mist and dew**—
**freezing qi** generates these.
Its **change** is **austerity and killing**—
when Heaven and Earth grow **bleak and desolate**,
and people take no joy in it,
this is the **qi** of Metal.

Its **greenish-blue** withers and falls—
**drying** and **withering** in its decline.

Its **taste** is **pungent**—
when things undergo Metal’s **transformation and change**,
they bear **pungent flavors**,
all derived from Metal’s **convergence and dispersion**.
Now, in the **western wilds**,
many grasses and trees are pungent.

Its **will** is **worry**—
worry, **contemplation**—
**reflection** and **rumination**.
*(New annotation: The *Xin Jiao Zheng* clarifies that *Wang’s* [王注] interpretation of worry as mere thought harms its meaning. Here, worry is the **will of the Lungs**, distinct from the **will of the Spleen**, which is thought. Further, the *Ling Shu Jing* [灵枢经] states: "Grief and worry cause **obstruction and stagnation** of *qi*." It also says: "Persistent grief and worry **harm the mind**." Thus, worry is **grief**, not mere thought. Grief harms the Lungs, for the Lungs **store *qi*** [气], and worry **stagnates *qi* in the Lungs*. Joy overcomes worry; when the **spirit** is **pleased**, joy arises, hence joy overcomes worry.*

Heat **injures skin and hair**—
Fire has two distinctions,
so here again the **form of injury** from heat is cited:
when **Fire’s *qi*** is **scorching and dry**,
things **burn and wither**,
thus, when heat is strong, **skin and hair are injured**.
Cold overcomes heat;
as **Yin consumes Yang**, cold overcomes heat.
*(New annotation: The *Xin Jiao Zheng* cites *Tai Su* [太素] as stating: **dryness injures skin and hair**, heat overcomes dryness.*

Pungent **injures skin and hair**—
**excessive**—
pungent and hot are even more so.
Bitterness overcomes pungency;
bitterness is the taste of Fire,
thus it overcomes Metal’s pungency.

Cold arises in the **Northern Regions**—
**Yang’s *qi*** is **suppressed**,
**Yin’s *qi*** ascends,
its **government spreads** and **dominates greatly**,
thus cold arises.

The **Great Void** is **serene and cold**—
**black qi** floats in the sky,
the heavens appear **dim and somber**,
this is the **cold qi** of the **high altitudes**.

If the *qi* resembles **scattered hemp**,
**black from root to tip**,
this is the **faint cold qi** of **rivers and lakes**.

The **Great Void** is **clear and white**—
the sky is **especially bright** like snow,
**uniform in hue** near and far,
this is the **cold qi** of **mountains and valleys**.

The **Great Void** is **white and murky**—
**Fire’s light** is **unobstructed**,
like **mist and rain vapor**,
**solemn and still** near and far,
gazing north reveals **darkness**,
**dew congeals and falls at night**—
this is **Water’s *qi*** in action,
the **transformation** of cold.

The **Great Void** is **congealed Yin**—
**white dust** shrouds the sky,
Heaven and Earth merge in **one hue**,
distant vision cannot distinguish—
this is **cold and dampness congealing**,
the **snow** about to descend.

The **earth splits**, **water freezes**—
**rivers and canals dry up**,
**parched marshes** are **clear and empty**,
water **converges**, soil **hardens**—
this is **Earth overcoming Water**,
Water unable to **cleanse itself**,
the **function** of cold.

Cold **generates Water**—
cold **draws from Yin’s transformation**,
Water’s origin—
this is how cold *qi* **engenders and transforms**.

When cold *qi* **applies its transformation**,
water **freezes and snow descends**;
its **most extreme change** is **dryness and hardness**.
In years of the **Heavenly Stems (运) 丙** combined with **Earthly Branches (乘) 寅, 子, 戌, 申, 午, 辰**,
cold *qi* **dominates greatly**.
In years of **Heavenly Stems (运) 辛** combined with **Earthly Branches (乘) 未, 巳, 卯, 丑, 亥, 酉**,
cold *qi* **wanes**.

Water **generates saltiness**—
when things bear **salty flavors**,
they all **originate from Water’s transformation** and **congealment**.

「The marshes and wetlands dry up, and the salty **coagulations (卤)** flourish—
the vast **Canghai (沧海)** is salty in taste,
salt arises from **Water’s transformation (水化)**,
thus saltiness is **borne by Water (因水产)**,
its nature **manifest and clear (炳然)**.
Boiling water yields saltiness—
an evident truth **near at hand (近而可见)**.

Saltiness **engenders the Kidneys (生肾)**—
salty substances enter the **Stomach (胃)**,
first **converging upon the Kidneys (归於肾)**,
thus in all **years of the Heavenly Stem (运) 丙**, salty substances **transform abundantly (多化)**,
and in all **years of the Heavenly Stem (运) 辛**, salty substances **transform sparingly (少化)**.

The Kidneys **generate marrow (生骨髓)**—
when saltiness enters the Kidneys,
the Kidneys **store and distribute** its **transformations (藏布化)**,
**nourishing and fostering marrow (生养骨髓)**.
Marrow **engenders the Liver (生肝)**.

Salt *qi* **first generates marrow (自生骨髓)**,
then **flows and transforms** to **produce vital *qi* (生气)**,
which **lodges in the Liver (入肝藏)**.
In the **Heaven (天)**, it **manifests as cold (为寒)**—
a **divine transformation (神化)**.
**Congealed and severe (凝惨)**, like ice and snow—
this is cold’s **transformation (化)**.
**Piercing and intense (凛冽)**, like frost and hail—
this is cold’s **function (用)**.

When the **year belongs to Taiyang (太阳)** in the **upper position (在上)**,
cold **transforms in the Heaven (化於天)**;
when Taiyang is in the **lower position (在下)**,
cold **dominates on Earth (行於地)**.

On Earth, it **becomes Water (为水)**—
when **Yin *qi* (阴气)** **distributes and transforms (布化)**,
flowing through the **Earth’s depths (於地中)**,
it **forms springs and wells (为水泉)**.
**Clear and limpid (澄澈)**, its **flowing expanse (流衍)**—
this is Water’s **essence (体)**.
**Drifting and drowning (漂荡没溺)**—
this is Water’s **function (用)**.

In **substance (体)**, it is **bone (为骨)**—
**strong and rigid (强干坚劲)**—
this is bone’s **essence (体)**.
**Enveloping marrow and brain (包裹髓脑)**—
this is bone’s **function (用)**.

In **vital *qi* (气)**, it is **rigidity (为坚)**—
when **flexible and soft substances (柔软之物)** meet cold,
they **become rigid (则坚)**—
this is cold’s **transformation (化)**.

In **storage (藏)**, it is the **Kidneys (为肾)**—
the Kidneys **store two essences (藏有二)**,
shaped like **red beans (红豆)** side by side,
curved and **attached to sinew and muscle (附於膂筋)**,
externally **wrapped in fat (有脂裹)**,
with **white exterior and black interior (裹白表黑)**,
**governing the storage of essence (主藏精)**.
As the **organ of strength (强之官)**,
they **harness ingenuity (仗巧出焉)**.

In **years of the Heavenly Stem (运) 辛**,
the **Kidneys’ storage (肾藏)** and **meridian pathways (经络)** may **receive malevolent *qi* (受邪)** and **manifest as illness (为病)**.
The **Bladder Palace (膀胱府)** shares this correspondence.
Its **nature (性)** is **piercing (凛)**—
piercing, for it is **cold (寒也)**,
the **nature of the Kidneys (肾之性)**.
Its **virtue/power (德)** is **cold (为寒)**—
Water **manifests cold as its virtue/power (以寒为德化)**.
**Newly corrected annotation (新校正云)** states:
According to the *Great Treatise on the Interchange of Qi (气交变大论)*,
its **virtue/power** is **wifely and sorrowful (妻怆)**.
Its **function (用)** is **□#17**—
**originally omitted (本阙)**.

Its **color is black (其色为黑)**,
when things **draw upon Water (物禀水成)**,
their **outer appearance (表)** is **enveloped in deep black (被玄黑之色)**.
Now, in the **northern wilds (北方之野)**,
the **upper growths of grasses and trees (草木之上)**,
their **colors are all dark (色皆兼黑)**.
In **years of the Heavenly Stem 辛 (乘辛岁)**,
**black-hued things (黑色之物)** take on **yellow and red (兼黄及赤)**.

Its **transformation (化)** is **stern (为肃)**—
**stern (肃)**, for it is **tranquility (静也)**.
**Newly corrected annotation (新校正云)** states:
According to the *Great Treatise on the Interchange of Qi (气交变大论)*,
its **transformation is pure and serene (其化清谧)**.
Now, Water’s **transformation is stern (水之化为肃)**,
yet when **Metal’s governance (金之政)** is **excessive (太过者)**,
it also becomes **stern (为肃)**.
When **Metal’s governance is balanced (平金之政)**,
it is **vigorous and stern (劲肃)**;
when **Metal’s governance shifts to stern and killing (金之变肃杀者)**,
why is this so?
For **Water’s stern transformation (水之化肃者)**,
**tranquility’s governance (静#18之政)** is **stern (肃者)**—
**stern and killing (肃杀也)**.
Though the **terms may seem alike (文虽同)**,
the **affairs differ (事异)**.

Its **creatures are scaled (其虫鳞)**—
**scaled (鳞)**, referring to **fish and serpent kin (谓鱼蛇之族类)**.
Its **governance (政)** is **tranquility (为静)**,
for **Water’s nature is clear and penetrating (水性澄彻)**,
and **its governance is pure and still (而清静)**.
**Newly corrected annotation (新校正云)** states:
According to the *Great Treatise on the Interchange of Qi (气交变大论)*,
its **governance is congealed and stern (其政凝肃)**.
Now, Water’s **governance is tranquility (水之政为静)**,
yet **Earth’s balanced governance (平土之政)** is also **tranquility (安静)**.
When **Earth’s governance is excessive (土太过之政)**,
it too becomes **tranquility (亦为静)**;
when **Earth’s governance is insufficient (土不及之政)**,
it also becomes **tranquility (亦为静定)**.
Though **Water and Earth differ (水土异)**,
their **tranquility is the same (而静同者)**,
this is not truly the same.
**Water’s tranquility is cold and clear (水之静清冷也)**,
**Earth’s tranquility is settled and still (土之静安静也)**.

Its **command (令)** is **□□#19 (本阙)**—
**originally omitted (本阙)**.

Its **shift is congealed and icy (其变凝冽)**—
**governance such when cold is extreme (寒甚故政是)**.
**Newly corrected annotation (新校正云)** states:
According to the *Great Treatise on the Interchange of Qi (气交变大论)*,
its **shift is piercing and icy (其变凛冽)**.

Its **disasters are blue ice and hail (其青冰雹)**—
**when they occur out of season (非时而有)** or **violently exceed norms (及暴过也)**.
**Newly corrected annotation (新校正云)** states:
According to the *Great Treatise on the Interchange of Qi (气交变大论)*,
its **disasters are ice, snow, frost, and hail (其灾冰雪霜雹)**.

Its **taste is salty (其味为咸)**—
for **things that transform and shift (物之化之变)**,
and **develop a salty flavor (而有咸味者)**,
are all **congealed and dispersed by Water’s transformation (水化之所凝散也)**.
Now, in the **northern rivers and marshes (北方川泽)**,
the **land is abundant in salty ancient deposits (地多咸古团)**.

Its **will/intent (志)** is **fear (为恐)**.
**Fear is to avoid calamity (恐以远祸)**.

「□#19

　　**This passage is the original.**

　　Its **shift congeals and disperses (其变凝冽)**—
　　**because the cold is extreme (寒甚故)**, thus **the governance is strict (政是)**.
　　○**Newly corrected annotation (新校正云)** states:
　　According to the *Great Treatise on the Interchange of Qi (气交变大论)*, its **shift is piercing and icy (其变凛冽)**.

　　**Fear harms the kidneys (恐伤肾)**—
　　**excessive fear agitates the inner (恐甚动中)**, thus harming the kidneys.
　　The *Spiritual Pivot Scripture (灵枢经)* says:
　　**Fear and dread unresolved (恐惧而不解) harm the essence (精).**
　　The kidneys store the **essence (精)**, so when the essence is harmed, the kidneys are also harmed.
　　**Thought (思) overcomes fear (思胜恐)**—
　　**thought perceives the calamity’s mechanism (思见祸机)**, thus there is **no anxiety or fear (无忧恐)**.
　　○**Newly corrected annotation (新校正云)** states:
　　**Thought (思) is a variant of anxiety (忧); this is incorrect (非也).**

　　**Cold harms the blood (寒伤血)**—
　　the kidneys **overcome the heart (肾胜心)**.
　　**Extreme cold causes blood to congeal (寒甚血凝)**, thus harming the blood.
　　**Dryness overcomes cold (燥胜寒)**—
　　**cold transformation leads to water accumulation (寒化则水积)**, while **dryness application makes things firm (燥用则物坚)**;
　　when **dryness and cold combine (燥与寒兼)**, they **mutually overcome (故相胜也)**.
　　**The transformations of Heaven and Earth (天地之化)** and **the principles of things (物理之常)** are thus established.

　　**Salty harms the blood (咸伤血)**—
　　when **the flavor exceeds saltiness (味过於咸)**, the throat becomes dry, prompting thirsty drinking, and the harm to blood is clear.
　　**Sweetness overcomes saltiness (甘胜咸)**.
　　○**Newly corrected annotation (新校正云)** states:
　　**Detailed above, from the previous passage of Gui Bo to here, it aligns with the *Great Treatise on Yin-Yang Correspondences (阴阳应象大论)***, though minor additions or subtractions exist and the annotations differ.

　　The **Five Qi (五气)** alternate in dominance;
　　each has its **preceding season (所先)**.
　　When **aligned with its season (岁时)**, the **Qi is dominant (气乃先)**.
　　**Misplaced, it is perverse (非其位则邪)**; **in place, it is orthodox (当其位则正)**.
　　First establish the **cyclical movements (运)**, then one may discern **misplacement and proper placement (非位与当位者)**.

　　The Emperor said: **How do diseases arise and vary (病之生变何如)?**
　　Gui Bo replied:
　　**When the Qi harmonize (气相得)**, the disease is **mild (则微)**;
　　**when they do not harmonize (不相得)**, the disease is **severe (则甚)**.
　　**Wood in Fire’s season (木居火位)**, **Fire in Earth’s season (火居土位)**,
　　**Earth in Metal’s season (土居金位)**, **Metal in Water’s season (金居水位)**,
　　**Water in Wood’s season (水居木位)**, **Wood in the Sovereign’s season (木居君位)**—
　　**such cases are harmonious (如是者为相得)**.

　　Again, **Wood in Water’s season (木居水位)**, **Water in Metal’s season (水居金位)**,
　　**Metal in Earth’s season (金居土位)**, **Earth in Fire’s season (土居火位)**,
　　**Fire in Wood’s season (火居木位)**—
　　though **such cases seem harmonious (如是者虽为相得)**,
　　they ultimately **violate the child’s subservience to the parent’s position (终以子僭居父母之位)**,
　　**as the lower overcomes the higher (下陵上)**, still **counted as slight perversion (犹为小逆也)**.

　　**Wood in Metal or Earth’s season (木居金土位)**, **Fire in Metal or Water’s season (火居金水位)**,
　　**Earth in Water or Wood’s season (土居水木位)**, **Metal in Fire or Wood’s season (金居火木位)**,
　　**Water in Fire or Earth’s season (水居火土位)**—
　　**such cases are disharmonious (如是者为不相得)**, thus the disease is **severe (故病甚也)**.
　　**First establish the cyclical movements and the Heavenly Dominating Qi (运气及司天之气)**,
　　then **the Qi’s harmonious or disharmonious placement can be discerned (则气之所在相得与不相得可知矣)**.

　　The Emperor said: **How does one govern the seasons (主岁何如)?**
　　Gui Bo replied:
　　**When the Qi are excessive (气有余)**, they **restrain their own season (制己所胜)** and **insult the season they do not overcome (侮所不胜)**;
　　**when they are insufficient (其不及)**, the **season that overcomes them insults and rides them (己所不胜侮而乘之)**,
　　while **their own season is light and insults them (己所胜轻而侮之)**.
　　**Excessive Wood (木余)** restrains Earth, **neglects Metal (轻忽於金)**,
　　**as Metal Qi does not contend (以金气不争)**, so **Wood relies on its excess to bully and insult (故木恃其余而欺侮也)**.
　　Again, **when Wood is deficient and Metal is excessive (木少金胜)**,
　　**Earth in turn insults Wood (土反侮木)**,
　　**as Wood does not reach its full measure (以木不及)**,
　　so **Earth presumptuously overpowers it (故土妄凌之也)**.
　　○**Newly corrected annotation (新校正云)** states:
　　**The Four Seasons converge (四气卒同).**
　　**Insult (侮)** means **to scorn and overlook (侮慢而凌忽之)**.
　　**Insult invites perversity (侮反受邪)**,
　　either **because of one’s own strength (己强盛)** or **encountering another’s decline (遇彼衰微)**,
　　**without measuring the weak (不度卑弱)**, arrogantly **riding and overpowering (妄行凌忽)**.
　　Though **one insults to seek victory (虽侮而求胜)**, the **result is ultimately perverse (故终叉受邪)**.
　　**Insult while receiving perversity (侮而受邪)** arises from **lack of reverence (寡於畏)**.
　　**Receiving perversity (受邪)** refers to **receiving the Qi that overcomes one’s own season (各谓受己不胜之邪)****.
　　However, **when one’s own season is strong externally but depleted internally (外强中乾)**,
　　**perverse Qi is strong, while the orthodox is weak (邪盛真弱)**,
　　**lacking reverence (寡於敬畏)**, thus **inviting perversity (由是纳邪)**,
　　hence it is said: **lack of reverence invites perversity (故日寡於畏也)**.

　　○**Newly corrected annotation (新校正云)** states:
　　According to the *Treatise on the Six Cycles and Hidden Symbols (六节藏象论)*:
　　**Arrival before its due time (未至而至)** is **excess (太过)**,
　　thus **it weakens the season it does not overcome (薄所不胜)** and **rides the season it should overcome (而乘所胜)**,
　　and this is called **profligate Qi (气淫)**.
　　**Failure to arrive on time (至而不至)** is **deficiency (不及)**,
　　thus **the season that overcomes it acts presumptuously (所胜妄行)**,
　　**while the season that generates it suffers disease (所生受病)** and **the season it does not overcome weakens it (所不胜而薄之)**,
　　and this is called **constricted Qi (气迫)**.
　　This is the **meaning of the above (即此之义也)**.

　　The Emperor said: **Good (善).**»

**Huangdi Neijing Suwen: Supplementary Commentary, Volume Forty**
*Annotated by Tang Taipu Ling Qixuanzi Wang Bing, with corrections by Song Guanglu Guyi Lin Yi et al., and revised by Song Shoushu Luntian Lang Sun Zhao.*

**Lun on the Profound Essence of the Six Subtle Qi**

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"Ah, how profound is the Dao of Heaven! Like welcoming floating clouds, or gazing into the abyss—gazing into the abyss, one may yet measure its depths, but welcoming the floating clouds, none can fathom their limits. The abyss lies still and stagnant yet clears with purity, so its depths may be measured; the floating clouds drift and scatter, merging and dispersing, so none can reach their bounds. The symbols of the Azure Sky, like scales in the depths, may be observed; yet the Dao of transformation and change is like the clouds—its departures and arrivals are unfathomable. The Six Qi are profound and subtle; their role in transformation should be likened to this metaphor."*

*The newly corrected text notes: This passage overlaps with the *Treatise on the Five Excesses*.*

The Master has repeatedly spoken of reverently following the Dao of Heaven. I have heard and stored these words, yet my heart doubts their meaning—I do not understand their intent. I wish the Master would fully express his meaning, so that his teachings may endure forever, never fading or ceasing. Might I then truly hear the Dao of Heaven? It is the Dao of transformation and generation.

Qibo knelt twice, bowing his head, and replied:
*"Ah, how clear is your inquiry into the Dao of Heaven! This follows the order of Heaven, the seasons of flourishing and decline."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"I wish to hear how the sixfold cycles of Heaven’s Dao bring about flourishing and decline."*

*The sixfold cycles were already mentioned in prior discourse; the Celestial Master had not yet fully expounded their meaning, hence the repeated question.*

Qibo said:
*"Above and below have their ranks; left and right have their order. Above and below refer to the two Qi governing Heaven and Earth. The remaining four Qi are positioned to the left and right of the year. Thus:
- To the right of Minor Yang, the Yang-Ming Qi governs;
- To the right of Yang-Ming, the Taiyang Qi governs;
- To the right of Taiyang, the Jueyin Qi governs;
- To the right of Jueyin, the Shaoyin Qi governs;
- To the right of Shaoyin, the Taiyin Qi governs;
- To the right of Taiyin, the Minor Yang Qi governs again.

This is what is called the *standard* of the Qi—like facing south in anticipation."* [*Standard* here means *terminal point*. The Sage faces south while standing, observing the arrival of the Qi.]

*"Thus it is said: ‘Following Heaven’s order, the seasons of flourishing and decline—shifting light to determine position, standing upright in anticipation.’ Shifting light refers to the sun’s movement. Determining position means facing south to observe the Qi, standing upright to observe the year, counting the arrival of the Qi so that they may be anticipated.

- Above Minor Yang, the Fire Qi governs; within it, Jueyin appears.
- Above Yang-Ming, the Dryness Qi governs; within it, Taiyin appears.
- Above Taiyang, the Cold Qi governs; within it, Shaoyin appears.
- Above Jueyin, the Wind Qi governs; within it, Minor Yang appears.
- Above Shaoyin, the Heat Qi governs; within it, Taiyang appears.
- Above Taiyin, the Dampness Qi governs; within it, Yang-Ming appears.

This is called the *root*. Below the root, within it appears; below what appears, the *standard* of the Qi lies. The root refers to the Original Qi. When the Qi diverges to become sovereign, the text’s meaning is clear."*

*The newly corrected text notes: The annotation ‘the text’s meaning is clear’ likely contains an error.*

*"Root and standard differ; the Qi’s responses manifest distinct phenomena. The root pertains to the elemental response; the standard marks the onset of disease. When disease arises, one seeks the standard to apply treatment; to seek the root, one examines the fundamental. Root and standard differ, yet within lies the comprehensive method."*

*The newly corrected text notes: The *Treatise on the Most Authentic Essentials* states: ‘The Six Qi’s roots and standards differ. Some Qi follow the root, some follow both root and standard, and some follow neither. Minor Yang and Taiyin follow the root; Shaoyin and Taiyang follow both root and standard; Yang-Ming and Jueyin follow neither, instead relying on the central Qi. Thus, those that follow the root generate transformation from the root; those that follow both root and standard exhibit transformations of root and standard; those that follow the central Qi transform through the central Qi.’*

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"Why do some Qi arrive when they should, some fail to arrive when they should, and some arrive in excess when they should?"*

*All refer to Heaven’s Six Qi. The first Qi arises fifteen days before the Vernal Equinox. The remaining five terminal Qi arrive sequentially, each governing sixty days plus eighty-seven and a half *ke* (a *ke* is 1/100 of a day).*

Qibo said:
*"When a Qi arrives as it should, it is harmonious; when it arrives but does not fully manifest, the incoming Qi is insufficient; when it arrives before its time, the incoming Qi is in excess. When the season arrives and the Qi arrives, this is the response of balance—such is the year of equilibrium.

For instance, in a *jiazi* year, if the Qi is in excess, it arrives before the *guihai* year’s designated time. In a *yichou* year, if the Qi is deficient, it arrives late during the *jiazi* year’s designated time. Thus it is said: ‘The incoming Qi is insufficient’ or ‘the incoming Qi is in excess.’"*

The initial arrival of the Six Qi follows its proper timing. If the annual Qi is in excess, all Six Qi arrive before their designated time; if the annual Qi is insufficient, all Six Qi arrive late. Arriving early or late, each deviation is thirteen days, and this is their response.

○The *Xin Jiao Zheng* states: According to *The Golden Chamber Essentials* (《金匮要略》), there are cases where a Qi arrives before its time, where it arrives but does not fully manifest, where it arrives but does not depart, and where it arrives with excessive force. After the Winter Solstice, in a *jiazi* year, the minor Yang Qi arises at midnight—when the minor Yin Qi’s time should have just begun, and the Yang Qi begins to generate. The heavens thus receive warmth and mildness, even though the *jiazi* year has not yet arrived; this is the case of "arriving before its time."

When the *jiazi* year arrives but the heavens are not yet warm and mild, this is "arriving but not fully manifesting." When the *jiazi* year arrives but the heavens remain intensely cold without abating, this is "arriving but not departing." When the *jiazi* year arrives but the heavens grow warm like mid-summer, this is "arriving with excessive force." These are also manifestations of the Qi’s response.

The Emperor said: *"What does 'arriving but not fully manifesting' or 'arriving before its time' mean?"*

It means the Qi is either in excess or insufficient for the year, responding with late or early arrival when it should come.

Qibo said: *"When the Qi responds as it should, it is harmonious; otherwise, it is contrary. Contrary responses give rise to change, and change leads to illness. Arriving at the proper time is harmonious, while failing to do so is contrary. The transforming Qi of Heaven and Earth is ceaseless, without obstruction. If a Qi arrives when it should not, or fails to arrive when it should, this disrupts the natural order of the transforming Qi. When the natural order is disrupted, the Qi becomes erratic, and this erratic Qi unsettles the blood, resulting in illness. When the Qi of Heaven and Earth varies and loses its regularity, all things fall ill."*

The Emperor said: *"Well said."* He then asked: *"Please explain how the Six Qi respond in terms of the Earth’s geography and their seasonal positions."*

Qibo said:
*"To the right of the *Xianming* (显明) is the position of the Sovereign Fire (君火); to the right of the Sovereign Fire, one step backward, is the position of the Ministerial Fire (相火). When the sun rises, this is called *Xianming*—the Earth Qi at the *mao* hour (卯) marks the onset of Spring. After sixty days and a fraction from the Spring Equinox, when the Dipper (斗) aligns with *mao* (卯) and reaches *si* (巳), this is the position of the Sovereign Fire. From when the Dipper aligns with *si* (巳) until the midpoint of *wei* (未), the threefold division of the Qi belongs to the Ministerial Fire, known as the minor Yang (少阳). The Sovereign Fire’s position is the minor Yin (少阴), the division of heat. When the celestial degree reaches this point, warmth and mildness prevail, and though it resides in the division of heat, it does not extend to scorching summer—this is the Sovereign Fire’s virtue.

If the minor Yang (少阳) occupies its position, it becomes usurping and rebellious, with excessive heat arriving early, causing epidemics (疠). If the minor Yang (少阳) is in its proper place, the heat is intense but arrives at its due time, while the dampness spreads late. If the *Yangming* (阳明) occupies its position, it results in untimely warmth and coolness. If the *Taiyang* (太阳) occupies its position, it brings alternating cold rain and heat. If the *Jueyin* (厥阴) occupies its position, it generates wind and dampness, and rain breeds winged insects (羽虫). If the minor Yin (少阴) occupies its position, it causes widespread pestilence (疫) in the world, for it has obtained its position and the Sovereign Fire’s command spreads unchecked. If the *Taiyin* (太阴) occupies its position, it brings seasonal rains (时雨).

Fire has two positions, so the Sovereign Fire is taken as the beginning of the Six Qi. The Ministerial Fire governs thirty days before and after the Summer Solstice, the division of the minor Yang (少阳), where Fire resides. When the celestial degree reaches this point, scorching heat prevails. If the minor Yang (少阳) occupies its position, it results in sudden heat, withering grass and drying rivers, extreme scorching, and dampness spreading late. If the *Yangming* (阳明) occupies its position, it brings frost-like Qi and premature outbreaks. If the *Taiyang* (太阳) occupies its position, it results in alternating cold and heat, with hot and cold Qi contending, producing hail and ice. If the *Jueyin* (厥阴) occupies its position, it generates intense wind and heat, and rain breeds winged insects (羽虫). If the minor Yin (少阴) occupies its position, it results in great heat and extreme scorching. If the *Taiyin* (太阴) occupies its position, it brings clouds, rain, thunder, and lightning.

*Retreat* (退) refers to facing south and viewing the position to the right of the current one. One step forward or backward is sixty days and a fraction of eighty-seven and a half *ke*. The remaining Qi follow the same principle.

One step further backward, the Earth Qi (土气) governs it—the division of rain (雨). This occurs sixty days and a fraction before the Autumn Equinox, when the Dipper aligns with *wei* (未) and reaches the midpoint of *you* (酉), the fourth division of the Qi. When the celestial degree reaches this point, clouds and rain prevail, and dampness ascends. If the minor Yang (少阳) occupies its position, it results in boiling heat, clouds, rain, thunder, and hail. If the *Yangming* (阳明) occupies its position, it brings clear rain, mist, and dew. If the *Taiyang* (太阳) occupies its position, it results in cold rain that harms things. If the *Jueyin* (厥阴) occupies its position, it generates violent wind and rain, destroying and pulling things apart, and rain breeds winged insects (保虫). If the minor Yin (少阴) occupies its position, it results in alternating cold and heat, with floating clouds over mountains and lakes, sudden rain and dampness ascending. If the *Taiyin* (太阴) occupies its position, it brings prolonged heavy rains (霪霪). (霪, pronounced *yin* as in 淫.)"

«Then another step forward, the *metal qi* (金气) takes charge;
　　This is the division of dryness (燥), occurring sixty days before the Autumnal Equinox (秋分), when the *Lüshou* (六元) reaches its fullest manifestation. From the moment the *Big Dipper* (斗建) aligns with *You* (酉) until *Hai* (亥), it is the fifth *qi* (气). When the celestial degree reaches this point, all things become parched (燥). If the minor Yang (少阳) occupies its position, it brings temperate and refreshing dryness (温清更正), and all things flourish (荣). If the *Yangming* (阳明) occupies its position, it results in severe frost and a sharp, piercing dryness (大冻燥疾). If the *Taiyang* (太阳) occupies its position, it brings early cold (早寒). If the *Jueyin* (厥阴) occupies its position, it unleashes great gusts of cold wind (冻风大行), and rain breeds *shell-scaled insects* (介虫). If the minor Yin (少阴) occupies its position, it results in autumn dampness (秋湿), with heat-related illnesses (热病) becoming prevalent. If the *Taiyin* (太阴) occupies its position, it brings timely rains (时雨) and lingering dampness (况阴).

Then another step forward, the *water qi* (水气) takes charge;
　　This is the division of cold (寒), occurring thirty days before and after the Winter Solstice (冬至). From the moment the *Big Dipper* (斗建) aligns with *Hai* (亥) until *Chou* (丑), it is the sixth *qi* (气). When the celestial degree reaches this point, cold *qi* (寒气) prevails greatly. If the minor Yang (少阳) occupies its position, it brings winter warmth (冬温), with *cold-dwelling insects* (垫虫) not hiding and flowing waters not freezing (流水不冰). If the *Yangming* (阳明) occupies its position, it results in a piercing dry cold (燥寒劲切). If the *Taiyang* (太阳) occupies its position, it brings intense cold (大寒凝冽). If the *Jueyin* (厥阴) occupies its position, it results in cold winds that sweep and scatter (寒风飘扬), and rain breeds *scaled insects* (鳞虫). If the minor Yin (少阴) occupies its position, it brings forth *cold-dwelling insects* (垫虫) and flowing waters that do not freeze (流水不冰). If the *Taiyin* (太阴) occupies its position, it results in lingering dampness and cold snow (凝阴寒雪), with the earth’s *qi* (地气) becoming moist.

Then another step forward, the *wood qi* (木气) takes charge;
　　This is the division of wind (风), occurring sixty days before the Vernal Equinox (春分). From the moment the *Big Dipper* (斗建) aligns with *Chou* (丑) until *Mao* (卯), it is the first *qi* (气). When the celestial degree reaches this point, wind *qi* (风气) begins to move, marking the start of the divine commands (神明号令) of Heaven and Earth and the deployment of Heaven’s agents (天之使). If the minor Yang (少阳) occupies its position, it brings the onset of warm epidemics (温疫至). If the *Yangming* (阳明) occupies its position, it results in clear winds (清风), mist and dew (雾露) in a hazy state (朦昧). If the *Taiyang* (太阳) occupies its position, it brings a fierce, biting cold wind (寒风切烈), with frost, snow, and water all frozen. If the *Jueyin* (厥阴) occupies its position, it unleashes great winds that flourish (大风发荣), and rain breeds *hairy insects* (毛虫). If the minor Yin (少阴) occupies its position, it results in scorching winds that harm people (热风伤人), with seasonal *qi* (时气) circulating freely. If the *Taiyin* (太阴) occupies its position, it brings wind and rain (风雨), with lingering dampness (凝阴) refusing to disperse.

Then another step forward, the *Jūn Huǒ* (君火) takes charge;
　　This is the division of heat (热), returning to the Vernal Equinox (春分) as its beginning. From the moment the *Big Dipper* (斗建) aligns with *Mao* (卯) until *Si* (巳), it is the second *qi* (气). These six positions collectively govern the entire year, comprising 360 days (六六三百六十日), 480 *kè* (刻, a unit of time) (六八四百八十刻), and 42 *kè* (六七四十二刻), with the remaining half-*kè* divided into three, approximating a total of 365 degrees (约终三百六十五度). The surplus can be further refined as needed.

Beneath the *Jūn Huǒ* (君火), the *water qi* (水气) receives it; when heat is excessive and water receives it, it manifests as flexible and tenuous growth (条蔓柔弱), and as the nurturing and overflowing of yin moisture (妻润衍溢), making the water symbol (水象) visible.

○*Newly corrected text* states: According to the *Six Elements and Their Proper Sequence* (六元正纪大论), when the minor Yang (少阳) arrives, it generates fire (火生), culminating in steamy surges (蒸涛). Thus, the meaning of *water qi* receiving it (水气承之) is evident. It further states: When the minor Yang (少阳) arrives, it brings *flagging winds* (标#7风) that overturn and scorch, with frost congealing. This too is the *water qi* receiving it (下承之水气).

Beneath the *water qi* (水气), the *earth qi* (土气) receives it; when cold is severe, things harden (物坚), water freezes and flows cease (流涸), and the earth symbol (土象) then appears, making its reception (承下) clear.

○*Newly corrected text* states: According to the commentary on the *Six Elements and Their Proper Sequence* (六元正纪大论), when the *Taiyang* (太阳) arrives, it brings cold snow, ice, hail, and white mist (寒雪冰雹白埃). This too is the *earth qi* receiving it (土气承之).

Beneath the *earth qi* (土气), the *wind qi* (风气) receives it; after fierce winds (疾风), timely rains (时雨) begin to fall. Thus, dampness is dispersed by wind (湿为风吹), transforming into rain (化而为雨).

○*Newly corrected text* states: According to the *Six Elements and Their Proper Sequence* (六元正纪大论), when the *Taiyin* (太阴) arrives, it generates dampness (湿生), culminating in pouring rain (注雨). Thus, beneath the *earth qi* (土位之下), the *wind qi* (风气) receives it and becomes rain (而为雨). It further states: When the *Taiyin* (太阴) arrives, it brings thunderous downpours (雷霆骤注) and violent gusts of wind (烈风). This too is the *wind qi* receiving it (风承之义).

Beneath the *wind qi* (风气), the *metal qi* (金气) receives it; when wind stirs and *qi* clears, all things become dry (万物皆燥), with *metal qi* receiving the *wood qi* (金承木下), its symbol (其象) manifesting plainly.

○*Newly corrected text* states: According to the *Six Elements and Their Proper Sequence* (六元正纪大论), when the *Jueyin* (厥阴) arrives, it generates wind (风生), culminating in austerity (肃). Thus, the meaning of *metal qi* receiving it (金承之义) is evident. It further states: When the *Jueyin* (厥阴) arrives, it brings *howling winds* (飘怒) and severe frost (大冻). This too is the *metal qi* receiving it (亦金承之义).

Beneath the *metal qi* (金气), the *fire qi* (火气) receives it; when metal is refined and heat is generated (锻金生热), fire flows from metal (火流金), ascending upon fire’s position (乘火之上), its course (理) being without deviation (无妄).

○*Newly corrected text* states: According to the *Six Elements and Their Proper Sequence* (六元正纪大论), when the *Yangming* (阳明) arrives, it brings *dispersing warmth* (散落温). This too is the fire ascending upon it (火乘之义).

Beneath the *Jūn Huǒ* (君火), *yin essence* (阴精) receives it. In the position of *Jūn Huǒ*, extreme heat does not prevail (大热不行), for *yin essence* restrains and receives it below (盖为阴精制承其下). All instances where the *qi* of the conquered element (所胜之气) receives beneath (乘於下者), temper their excessive manifestations (折其标盛). This is the grand framework of Heaven and Earth’s creation (天地造化之大体).

○*Newly corrected text* states: According to the *Six Elements and Their Proper Sequence* (六元正纪大论), when the minor Yin (少阴) arrives, it generates heat (热生), but in the middle, it turns cold (中为寒). Thus, the meaning of *yin essence* receiving it (阴承之义) is clear. It further states: When the minor Yin (少阴) arrives, it brings *great warmth and cold* (大暄寒). This too is its meaning (亦其义也).

Furthermore, according to the *Six Elements and Their Proper Sequence* (六元正纪), it states: When water rises, it brings hail and snow (水发而雹雪); when earth rises, it brings *scattering winds* (飘骤); when wood rises, it brings destruction and breaking (毁折); when metal rises, it brings clarity and brightness (清明); when fire rises, it brings *pervasive haze* (熏昧). What *qi* causes these phenomena?

It is said: *Qi* has varying degrees of intensity (多少), and its manifestations differ in subtlety (微甚). The subtle align with their own element (微者当其气), while the intense combine with the element beneath them (甚者兼其下), revealing what *qi* below is being influenced (征其下气而见可知).

The Emperor asked: What does this mean?
Qi Bo replied: When an element is in excess (亢), it brings harm (则害); when it receives (承), it restrains (乃制), and restraint leads to transformation and generation (制则生化). External manifestations reflect the degree of excess or deficiency (外列盛衰). Excess causes defeat and disorder (害则败乱), while transformation and generation lead to great illness (生化大病). Excess (亢) is the surpassing of limits (过极), and things abhor their extremes (物恶其极).

The Emperor asked: How does excess and deficiency manifest?
Qi Bo replied: If it is not in its proper position (非其位), it becomes perverse (则邪); if it is in its proper position (当其位), it becomes correct (则正). When perverse, its effects are extreme (邪则变甚); when correct, its effects are subtle (正则微).

The Emperor asked: What is meant by "in its proper position" (当位)?

Qi Bo replied:
When the **Wood phase** governs the **Mao** hour, the **Fire phase** governs the **Wu** hour, the **Earth phase** governs all four seasons, the **Metal phase** governs the **You** hour, and the **Water phase** governs the **Zi** hour—this is what is called the **"Sui Hui"** (yearly conjunction), where the **qi** is balanced. Neither excessive nor deficient, this is called **"Ping Yun"** (balanced phase) governing the year. In a balanced year, all things flourish in harmony with the pulses, all in perfect accord without deviation.

*(New annotation: Specifically, when the Wood phase governs Mao, it refers to the Ding-Mao year. When the Fire phase governs Wu, it refers to the Wu-Wu year. When the Earth phase governs all four seasons, it refers to the Jia-Chen, Jia-Xu, Ji-Chou, and Ji-Wei years. When the Metal phase governs You, it refers to the Yi-You year. When the Water phase governs Zi, it refers to the Bing-Zi year. Among these, Wu-Wu, Ji-Chou, Ji-Wei, and Yi-You are also part of the **Tai Tianfu** (Great Heavenly Correspondence).)*

The Emperor asked: What if it is not in its proper position?
Qi Bo replied: The year does not align with the **Hui** (conjunction). It does not meet with its native **ben chen** (root hour).

The Emperor asked: In the Earth phase year, the **Tai Yin** (Greater Yin) appears above; in the Fire phase year, both **Shao Yang** (Lesser Yang) and **Shao Yin** (Lesser Yin) appear above—both being Fire **qi**; in the Metal phase year, **Yang Ming** (Bright Yang) appears above; in the Wood phase year, **Jue Yin** (Dripping Yin) appears above; in the Water phase year, **Tai Yang** (Greater Yang) appears above—how so?

Qi Bo replied: The **Heavenly conjunction** is when the **Heavenly qi** meets with the **Yun qi** (phase **qi**). *(New annotation: Specifically, in the Earth phase year, Tai Yin appears above—Ji-Chou and Ji-Wei. In the Fire phase year, Shao Yang appears above—Wu-Yin and Wu-Shen; Shao Yin appears above—Wu-Zi and Wu-Wu. In the Metal phase year, Yang Ming appears above—Yi-Mao and Yi-You. In the Wood phase year, Jue Yin appears above—Ding-Si and Ding-Hai. In the Water phase year, Tai Yang appears above—Bing-Chen and Bing-Xu. Among these, Ji-You, Ji-Wei, Wu-Wu, and Yi-You are also part of the Tai Tianfu.)*

According to the *Liu Yuan Zheng Ji Da Lun* (Great Treatise on the Six Elements' True Sequence), there are three cases of **Tai Guo** (excess) aligning with Heavenly transformations and three cases of **Bu Ji** (deficiency) aligning with Heavenly transformations: Wu-Zi and Wu-Wu, where **Tai Zheng** (excessive征) ascends to Shao Yin; Wu-Yin and Wu-Shen, where **Tai Zheng** ascends to Shao Yang; Bing-Chen and Bing-Xu, where **Tai Yu** (excessive羽) ascends to Tai Yang—these are three cases. Ding-Si and Ding-Hai, where **Shao Jiao** (deficient角) ascends to Jue Yin; Yi-Mao and Yi-You, where **Shao Shang** (deficient商) ascends to Yang Ming; Ji-Chou and Ji-Wei, where **Shao Guan** (deficient官) ascends to Tai Yin—these are three cases. Those ascending are either **Tai Guo** or **Bu Ji**, all called **Tianfu** (Heavenly Correspondence). Hence, the *Tian Yuan Ce* (Heavenly Elemental Register) refers to them as **Tianfu**.

What is the **Sui Hui** of the **Tianfu** like?
Qi Bo replied: The **Tai Tianfu** conjunction is what is called **"San He"** (Three Harmonies)—the first being **Tian Hui** (Heavenly Conjunction), the second **Sui Hui** (Yearly Conjunction), and the third **Yun Hui** (Phase Conjunction). The *Tian Yuan Ji Da Lun* (Great Treatise on Heavenly Elemental Sequences) states: *"San He"* is the principle of governance. This is what is meant.

*(New annotation: The details of Tai Tianfu are fully elaborated in the annotations of the *Tian Yuan Ji Da Lun*.)*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How do their dignities and humilities differ?"*
Qi Bo replied: *"The **Tianfu** (Heavenly Correspondence) governs as the law; the **Suiwei** (Yearly Position) acts as the decree; and the **Tai Tianfu** (Great Heavenly Correspondence) signifies the noble person.
To govern as the law is like the **Xiangfu** (Minister of War); to act as the decree is like the **Fangbo** (Regional Commanders); and the noble person is like the sovereign ruler.

The Yellow Emperor said: *"What if one is struck by evil?"*
Qi Bo replied: *"If struck by the **Tianfu** (Heavenly Correspondence), the disease progresses swiftly and is perilous. The **Tianfu** and **Guanren** (Official Person) together form the standard of governance, yet when evil arises, it disrupts this alignment, causing swift and perilous illness.
If struck by the **Suiwei** (Yearly Position), the disease advances slowly but persists. The **Fangbo** (Regional Commander) lacks the authority to enforce swift punishment, so the harm is merely prolonged.
If struck by the **Gui Ren** (Noble Person), the disease erupts violently and leads to death. The noble person’s virtue cannot be violated, so the illness strikes violently and results in death.

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How do the shifts in their positions manifest?"*
Qi Bo replied: *"When a subject assumes the sovereign’s position, it is in harmony; when the sovereign assumes a subject’s position, it is contrary. Contrary brings illness near and harm swift; harmony brings illness distant and harm slight. This is what is called the **Two Fires** (of governance).
The **Xianghuo** (Ministerial Fire) resides within the **Junhuo** (Sovereign Fire), meaning the subject’s position is within the sovereign’s position—thus, it is contrary. The **Junhuo** (Sovereign Fire) residing within the **Xianghuo** (Ministerial Fire) means the sovereign’s position is within the subject’s position, with the sovereign overseeing the subject—thus, it is in harmony. 'Distant' refers to the inner chambers being far, 'near' refers to the inner chambers being close."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Good. I wish to hear about their progression—how does it proceed?"*
Qi Bo replied: *"The progression is measured in degrees: sixty degrees with a remainder, the remainder being eighty-seven and a half **ke** (刻) plus five-tenths of a **ke**. Thus, twenty-four such steps accumulate to a hundred **ke**, completing a day. This refers to the surplus of Heaven’s degrees.
When speaking of the degrees of the **Zhou Tian** (Complete Heavenly Cycle), it is three hundred sixty-five degrees plus one-fourth of a degree. Twenty-four steps equal four years, and one-fourth of a degree is twenty-five **ke**. When the accumulated **ke** of four years reaches a hundred, it forms one day. Here, 'degree' means one day.
The Yellow Emperor said: *"How do the Six Qi (氣) correspond to the changes of the Five Phases (行)?"*
Qi Bo replied: *"Positions have beginnings and endings; **qi** has phases of initial and mid. Their interactions differ above and below, and their inquiry varies accordingly. Positions refer to ranks; **qi** refers to Heaven’s **qi**. The **qi** and positions shift in relation to each other, so at the **qi**’s initial phase, Heaven’s influence prevails, and at its mid-phase, Earth’s influence dominates. When Earth dominates, the **qi** flows upon Earth; when Heaven prevails, the **qi** ascends to Heaven. Both the initial and mid-phases are divided by the Heavenly Steps, with each phase measuring thirty days plus forty-three and three-fourths **ke**."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How does one seek them?"*
Qi Bo replied: *"The **qi** of Heaven begins at **Jia** (甲), and the **qi** of Earth begins at **Zi** (子). When **Zi** and **Jia** align, it is called **Sui Li** (Yearly Establishment); if one carefully observes the time, the **qi** can be anticipated accordingly. When **Zi** and **Jia** align, it is the **Jia Zi** (甲子) Year. If one carefully observes the early and late moments of the **Shui Ke** (Water Mark), then all Six **Qi** can be anticipated.
The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish to hear about the year—how do the Six Qi begin and end, early and late?"*
Qi Bo replied: *"Your question is clear! In the **Jia Zi** (甲子) Year, the initial **qi**, Heaven’s degree begins at the **Shui Xia** (Water Mark) minus one **ke**, rising at **Ping Ming** (平明, dawn) during the first **ke** of **Yin Sheng** (寅初, the first hour of the Tiger), in the southern **Geng** (艮) direction. *(Annotation: In the years of **Wu Chen** (戊辰), **Ren Shen** (壬申), **Bing Zi** (丙子), **Geng Chen** (庚辰), **Jia Shen** (甲申), **Ji Zi** (己子), **Ren Chen** (壬辰), **Bing Shen** (丙申), **Geng Zi** (庚子), **Jia Chen** (甲辰), **Wu Shen** (戊申), **Kun Zi** (癸子), **Bing Chen** (丙辰), and **Geng Shen** (庚申), the **qi** of these years align similarly. This is the **Chen Shen Zi** (辰申子) Yearly Conjunction of **qi**, and the *Yin Yang Fa* (Doctrine of Yin and Yang) regards this as **San He** (Three Harmonies).)*
It ends at eighty-seven and a half **ke**; at the midpoint of **Zi Zheng** (子正, the hour of the Rat), which is the halfway point of the night. Twelve and a half **ke** beyond, it enters the initial phase of the second **qi**, and all remaining **ke** are similarly included.
The second **qi** begins at eighty-seven and six-tenths **ke**, in the southern **Geng** (艮) direction of **Zi Zheng** (子正). It ends at seventy-five **ke**, four **ke** after **Xu** (戌, the Dog). Twenty-five **ke** beyond, it enters the initial phase of the next three **qi** in sequence.
The third **qi** begins at seventy-six **ke**, at the first **ke** of **Hai Sheng** (亥初, the first hour of the Pig). It ends at sixty-two and a half **ke**, at the midpoint of **You Zheng** (酉正, the hour of the Rooster). Thirty-seven and a half **ke** beyond, it enters the following phase.
The fourth **qi** begins at sixty-two and six-tenths **ke**, in the northern **Geng** (艮) direction of **You Zheng** (酉正). It ends at fifty **ke**, four **ke** after **Wei** (未, the Sheep). Fifty **ke** beyond, it enters the following phase.
The fifth **qi** begins at fifty-one **ke**, at the first **ke** of **Shen Sheng** (申初, the first hour of the Monkey). It ends at thirty-seven and a half **ke**, at the midpoint of **Wu Zheng** (午正, the hour of the Horse), which is the halfway point of the day. Sixty-two and a half **ke** beyond, it enters the following phase.

The sixth **qi** begins at thirty-seven and six-tenths **ke**, in the southern **Geng** (艮) direction of **Wu Zheng** (午正). It ends at twenty-five **ke**, four **ke** after **Chen Zheng** (辰正, the hour of the Dragon). Seventy-five **ke** beyond, it enters the following phase. *(This is what is called **Chu Liu** (初六), Heaven’s degree.)* The degrees of Heaven and Earth converge in the twenty-four **qi**, forming a grand assembly and alignment; thus, this day is named the **Chu Liu Tian Shu** (初六天數, initial sixth Heavenly degree).

In the **Yi Chou** (乙丑) Year, the initial **qi**, Heaven’s degree begins at twenty-six **ke**, at the first **ke** of **Si Sheng** (巳初, the first hour of the Snake). *(Annotation: In the years of **Ji Si** (己巳), **Gui You** (癸酉), **Ding Chou** (丁丑), **Xin Si** (辛巳), **Yi You** (乙酉), **Ji Chou** (己丑), **Gui Si** (癸巳), **Ding You** (丁酉), **Xin Chou** (辛丑), **Yi Si** (乙巳), **Ji You** (己酉), **Kun Chou** (癸丑), **Ding Si** (丁巳), and **Xin You** (辛酉), the **qi** align similarly. This is the **Si You Chou** (巳酉丑) Yearly Conjunction of **qi**.)*
It ends at twelve and a half **ke**, at the midpoint of **Mao Zheng** (卯正, the hour of the Hare). The second **qi** begins at twelve and six-tenths **ke**, in the southern **Geng** (艮) direction of **Mao Zheng** (卯正). It ends at **Shui Xia** (水下, the Water Mark) plus one hundred **ke**, four **ke** after **Chou** (丑, the Ox).
The third **qi** begins at one **ke**, again at the first **ke** of **Yin Sheng** (寅初, the first hour of the Tiger). It ends at eighty-seven and a half **ke**, at the midpoint of **Zi Zheng** (子正, the hour of the Rat). The fourth **qi** begins at eighty-seven and six-tenths **ke**, in the eastern **Geng** (艮) direction of **Zi Zheng** (子正). It ends at seventy-five **ke**, four **ke** after **Xu** (戌, the Dog).
The fifth **qi** begins at seventy-six **ke**,

The sixth **qi** begins at one **ke**, at the first **ke** of **Hai Chu** (亥初, the first hour of the Pig).
It ends at sixty-two and a half **ke**, at the midpoint of **You Zheng** (酉正, the hour of the Rooster).

The sixth **qi** begins at sixty-two and six-tenths **ke**,
in the northern **You** (酉) direction of **You Zheng** (酉正).
It ends at fifty **ke**, four **ke** after **Wei** (未, the Sheep).

The so-called "six-two" (六二) is the **Heavenly Number** (天之数).
One-six (一六) is the initial six (初六),
and two-six (二六) is the second six (六二), which follows in order.

In the year **Bing Yin** (丙寅), the first **qi**,
the **Heavenly Number** begins at fifty-one **ke**,
at the first **ke** of **Shen Chu** (申初, the first hour of the Monkey).

*Newly corrected version states:

The so-called "six-four" (六四) is the **Heavenly Number** (天之数).
In the following year **Wu Chen** (戊辰), the first **qi**,
again begins at one **ke**, perpetually so, cycling endlessly.
It starts from the year **Jia Zi** (甲子) and ends at the year **Gui Hai** (癸亥),
constantly taking four years as one **small cycle** (小周),
and fifteen **small cycles** (小周) as one **great cycle** (大周).
When the year is designated by **Chen** (辰), then the **qi** can be aligned with the cycle.

The Emperor said: I wish to hear how the yearly cycles correspond.
**Gui Bo** (岐伯) replied: Your question is thorough indeed!
The **Heavenly Qi** (天气) begins at one **ke** when the sun completes one cycle;
this is the year **Jia Zi** (甲子).

The **Heavenly Qi** begins at twenty-six **ke** when the sun completes two cycles;
this is the year **Yi Chou** (乙丑).

The **Heavenly Qi** begins at fifty-one **ke** when the sun completes three cycles;
this is the year **Bing Yin** (丙寅).

The **Heavenly Qi** begins at seventy-six **ke** when the sun completes four cycles;
this is the year **Ding Mao** (丁卯).

The **Heavenly Qi** again begins at one **ke** when the sun completes five cycles;
this is the year **Wu Chen** (戊辰).
The remaining fifty-five years follow in this cycle, endlessly repeating.
This is called a **"ji" (纪) cycle**.

The rule is that four years constitute one **ji** cycle,
repeating endlessly.
There are three **qi** cycles every three years,
thus there are three **unified cycles** (三合).

Therefore, the **"Yin Wu Xu" (寅午戌) years** have unified **qi** cycles,
the **"Mao Wei Hai" (卯未亥) years** have unified **qi** cycles,
the **"Chen Shen Zi" (辰申子) years** have unified **qi** cycles,
and the **"Si You Chou" (巳酉丑) years** have unified **qi** cycles,
and so the cycle ends and begins anew.

The *Yin-Yang Laws* (《阴阳法》) consider this as the three **unified cycles** (三合),
for it is where the **qi** cycles converge.
Otherwise, each would remain in its own domain,
and there would be no basis for their unification.

The Emperor said: I wish to hear their applications.
**Gui Bo** replied: When speaking of **Heaven** (天), seek its **root** (本);
when speaking of **Earth** (地), seek its **position** (位);
when speaking of **human beings** (人), seek the **interchange of qi** (气交).

**Root** (本) refers to the **six Heavenly Qi** (天六气):
**Cold** (寒), **Heat** (暑), **Dryness** (燥), **Moisture** (湿), **Wind** (风), and **Fire** (火).
From these, the **three Yin and three Yang** (三阴三阳) generate and transform,
hence it is called **root**.

This is what is meant by the **Six Primordials** (六元).

**Position** (位) refers to the **Five Phases** (金木火土水) and their **corresponding ministers** (君火):
the **interchange of Heavenly and Earthly Qi** (天地之气), rising and falling,
where human beings dwell.

The Emperor said: What is meant by **interchange of qi** (气交)?
**Gui Bo** replied: The **positions of the upper and lower** (上下之位),
where the **interchange of qi** (气交) occurs,
is where humans reside.
From **Heaven’s lower boundary** (天之下) to **Earth’s upper boundary** (地之上),
this is the division where **Heavenly and Earthly Qi** (二气) intermingle.

Humans dwell on Earth’s surface,
so the **interchange of qi** (气交) is where humans reside.
Thus, all **transformations and changes** (化生变易) occur within this **interchange of qi** (气交).

Hence it is said:
Above the **Heavenly Pivot** (天枢), **Heavenly Qi** (天气) dominates;
Below the **Heavenly Pivot** (天枢), **Earthly Qi** (地气) dominates;
Within the **interchange of qi** (气交), **human qi** (人气) follows,
and all things are generated and transformed accordingly.
This is what is meant.

The **Heavenly Pivot** (天枢) is the region at the sides of the waist,
where, if one stretches out the arm and points to the sky,
the **Heavenly Pivot** aligns exactly with the midpoint of the body.
Dividing this into three parts:
the upper third corresponds to **Heaven** (天),
the lower third corresponds to **Earth** (地),
and the middle third corresponds to the **interchange of qi** (气交).

At the juncture where **Heavenly and Earthly Qi** (天地之气) intermingle,
the **victorious changes** (寒暑燥湿风火胜复之变之化) pass through,
thus **human qi** (人气) follows them,
and all things are generated and transformed,
all coalescing and dispersing accordingly.

The Emperor asked: "What is meant by *chū* and *zhōng*?"
Gebi replied: "*Chū* spans thirty degrees with an excess. *Zhōng* follows the same principle. The excess refers to thirty days plus forty-three *kè* and forty *fēn* of a *kè*—thirty in total. When *chū* and *zhōng* converge, it amounts to sixty days plus eighty-seven *kè* and a half. Since each has an excess of forty *fēn* of a *kè* thirty times, that is why *zhōng* follows the same law.

The Emperor asked: "What are *chū* and *zhōng* for?"
Gebi replied: "They serve to divide Heaven and Earth. Through this, one knows the high and low of *qi*, and how it governs the diseases of humankind."

The Emperor said: "I wish to hear it fully."
Gebi replied: "*Chū* is Earthly *qi*, and *zhōng* is Heavenly *qi*. At the beginning of *qi*, Heaven takes action—when Heaven acts, Earthly *qi* ascends within the boundless void. At the midpoint of *qi*, Earth governs—when Earth governs, Heavenly *qi* descends into the realm of substance.

The Emperor asked: "How does this ascending and descending proceed?"
Gebi replied: "The ascending and descending of *qi* is the alternating operation of Heaven and Earth. Ascending means rising upward; descending means falling downward. When ascending reaches its limit, it descends; when descending reaches its limit, it ascends. Since ascending and descending never cease, this displays the alternating operation of Heaven and Earth."

The Emperor asked: "I wish to hear how this operates."
Gebi replied: "When ascending ceases and descending begins, this descending is called Heaven; when descending ceases and ascending begins, this ascending is called Earth. At the beginning of *qi*, Earthly *qi* ascends; at the midpoint of *qi*, Heavenly *qi* descends. When ascending ceases and descending follows, it reveals the downward flow of Heavenly *qi*; when descending ceases and ascending follows, it manifests the upward response of Earthly *qi*. When Heavenly *qi* descends and Earthly *qi* ascends, their interchange marks the symbol of *Tài* (harmony). The *Yì* says: 'Heaven and Earth interchange in harmony.' Thus, the ascending and descending of Heavenly and Earthly *qi* always alternate every thirty days and a half, descending and ascending without pause, so that all things generate and transform, never resting, and each attains its place.

When Heavenly *qi* descends, *qi* flows toward Earth; when Earthly *qi* ascends, *qi* surges toward Heaven. Thus, high and low call to each other, ascending and descending follow in sequence, and transformation arises. Since *qi* has phases of dominance and reversal, change is generated.

---
*The newly corrected text states:* According to the *Lùyúan Zhèngjì Dàlùn*, how does the fullness and emptiness of Heavenly and Earthly *qi* operate? When Heavenly *qi* is insufficient, Earthly *qi* follows; when Earthly *qi* is insufficient, Heavenly *qi* follows. The revolving cycle governs this, always taking precedence. What is not overcome returns to harmony; following the revolving cycle, it generates disease accordingly. Thus, when the upper dominates, Heavenly *qi* descends and prevails below; when the lower dominates, Earthly *qi* shifts and ascends. The degree of excess or deficiency alters their proportions—minor differences result in small deviations, extreme differences lead to great deviations, and extreme deviations cause positional shifts in *qi* interchange, leading to major transformations and the onset of disease.

The Emperor said: "Excellent. When cold and dampness encounter each other, when dryness and heat confront each other, when wind and fire clash—what questions arise from this?"
Gebi replied: "*Qi* has phases of dominance and reversal. The emergence of dominance and reversal involves *virtue*, transformation, function, and change; change allows pathogenic *qi* to take root. Just as clapping hands produces sound and pouring water generates boiling, the interchange of things manifests their interactions. All classes of beings likewise arise from this. When Heavenly and Earthly *qi* intermingle, the eight winds surge and clash, and the six *qi* race through their midst. Thus, when *qi* cannot remain balanced, it becomes pathogenic *qi*.

The Emperor asked: "What is meant by *xié* (pathogenic)?"
Gebi replied: "*Xié* refers to what is not upright. When Heaven and Earth dominate and reverse, cold, heat, dryness, dampness, wind, and fire—the six *qi*—mutually become pathogenic.

Gebi continued: "The generation of things follows transformation; their extremes arise from change. When transformation and change press close, success and failure emerge. The *qi* of generation and transformation is unseen in form, its nature unknown, its origin unfathomable, its end unsearchable—yet all things spontaneously generate and transform, approaching completion without limit. This is called *Tiān Hé* (Heaven’s harmony). When its manifestations appear, its movements are evident: violent, fierce, and abrupt, drifting and sudden, pulling apart the firm and shattering the resilient, fracturing and trembling—this is called pathogenic *qi*. Thus, when things generate, they do so quietly and complete their transformation; when they perish, they do so violently and undergo change. Therefore, generation follows transformation, extremes arise from change, and since transformation and change never cease, success and failure are ever-present. Those who speak of bounded generation imply the existence of beginnings and ends.

---
*The newly corrected text states:* According to the *Tiānyuán Jì Dàlùn*, when things generate, it is called transformation; when things reach their limits, it is called change. Thus, *qi* has phases of dominance and reversal, and its functions vary in speed. These four aspects—dominance, reversal, delay, and haste—give rise to transformation and change. When wind arises, Heaven and Earth shift positions, cold and heat exchange directions, water and fire swap places. At the moment of movement, the speed and reversal of *qi* do not remain constant. Though its intentions cannot be fully discerned, the subtle and extreme effects manifest as transformation and change—the origin of wind. When human *qi* cannot overcome it, disease arises from this influence. Wind does not seek to dominate humanity.

The Emperor said: "Dominance and reversal, delay and haste—these are how wind arises, giving rise to transformation and change. Thus, it follows the variations of flourishing and decline. Success and failure, rise and fall, fluctuate within—why is this so?"

The interplay of rise and fall is the germination of calamity and fortune. Where there is calamity, fortune is latent; where there is fortune, calamity is concealed. Thus, calamity and fortune alternately conceal and reveal each other. When things flourish, they decline; when joy reaches its peak, sorrow follows. This is the extreme of fortune, hence it is concealed by calamity. When adversity reaches its limit, prosperity follows; when the unaccomplished is accomplished, this is the extreme of calamity, hence it is concealed by fortune. Yet success and failure, joy and misfortune, are evident in the *Dao*—they cannot be perpetual. This is the natural order, so there is no blame.

Gebi replied: "Success and failure, rise and fall, arise from movement. Movement without cessation gives rise to transformation."

The principle of movement and stillness follows the constant operation of *qi*. In its subtle form, it gives rise to the transformation of things; in its extreme form, it brings about their changes. When *qi* flows into things, they obtain it and thus come to life; when changes are exerted upon things, they obtain it and thus perish. Hence, success and failure, rise and fall, arise from the subtle and extreme, swift and slow movements of *qi*—how could it be that only *qi* possesses this nature?

Humans exist within the realm of *qi*. The *Dao* of nurturing life, the application of advancing or retreating, all follow this same principle.

○The newly corrected text states: According to the *Zhi Zhen Yao Da Lun* (至真要大论), the *qi* of yin and yang—when clear and still, generates life and harmonious transformation; when active, gives rise to harsh ailments. This is what is meant here.

The Emperor asked: "Is there a limit to this?"

Gebi replied: "Stillness without life or transformation is the limit of stillness. The limits of humans are visible in two ways: the first is the daily cycle of life’s completion, and the second is the cycle of change, aligning with the earth’s#13 form. Then, from these small transformations, life returns to the great transformation. Even after death, the process of transformation and change continues, hence the two visible limits of humans.

The ultimate limits of Heaven and Earth, however, are unseen. Human lifespan has its allotted measure, and its length cannot match theirs, so few can perceive these limits.

The Emperor asked: "Does life not transform?" Or are there things that do not generate or transform?

Gebi replied: "When the processes of inhalation and exhalation cease, the vital *shenji* (神机) and transformations perish. When the rise and fall of *huayi* (化气) are stilled, *qi* stands alone in peril. Inhalation and exhalation refer to breathing; rise and fall refer to the *qi* of transformation.

The scales and feathers of birds, the shells of fish, and even their flight and movement—all are born from *qi* rooted within the body, with the *shen* (神) as the sovereign of movement and stillness. Hence, it is called *shenji* (神机).

Yet metals, gems, earth, and stones, as well as melting and mineral deposits in plants—all these arise from *qi* rooted externally, borrowing *qi* to form and sustain their essence. Thus, it is called *qili* (气立).

The *Wu Chang Zheng Da Lun* (五常政大论) states: *Qi* rooted within is called *shenji* (神机); when the *shen* departs, the *ji* (机) ceases. *Qi* rooted externally is called *qili* (气立); when the *qi* stops, transformation is cut off. This is what is meant.

Thus, without these four processes—*shenji* and *qili*—life and death both cease.

○The newly corrected text states: According to the *Yijing* (易), what originates from Heaven is drawn upward, what originates from Earth is drawn downward. The *Zhouli* (周礼) mentions *tianchan* (天产) and *dichan* (地产) in the *Da Zong Bo* (大宗伯), and *dongwu* (动物) and *zhiwu* (植物) in the *Da Si Tu* (大司徒). This refers precisely to *shenji* and *qili*.

(For *jiāo* (蛟), pronounced *qí* (祁).)

The Way of life and death depends not on mere emergence and retreat—without them, there could be no growth, flourishing, aging, or decline. Without ascent and descent, there could be no generation, growth, transformation, or withdrawal into storage.

The self-winding and unwinding, the self-extending and contracting from east to west, from south to north, all rely on the breath of emergence and retreat as the master of transformation. Those who preserve their essence by following things depend on the ascending and descending *qi* of yin and yang to create the source of life. Without this Way, none could achieve such life. Thus, ascent, descent, emergence, and retreat are present in all forms.

All that contains vital *qi* is called an instrument of life and transformation. When touched by things, it responds. The horizontal orifices all possess the *qi* of emergence, retreat, arrival, and departure. The vertical orifices all possess the ascending and descending *qi* of yin and yang, circulating within.

How do we know this? Observe the walls, windows, doors, and openings on both sides—they all receive incoming *qi* striking against them, which is the *qi* of emergence and retreat. When yang ascends, the well becomes cold; when yin ascends, the water grows warm. When objects are cast into the well, or leaves fall into empty space, drifting slowly without haste, it is due to the obstruction of ascending *qi*. When a full vessel is inverted and suspended, the water does not spill out—this is because there is no ascending *qi* to allow descent. When a small-mouthed bottle is struck, water does not enter—this is because the *qi* does not emerge to allow entrance.

From this, we see that ascent is inseparable from descent, and descent is inseparable from ascent. Without emergence, there is no retreat; without retreat, there is no emergence. Within all categories of things, emergence, retreat, ascent, and descent never deviate from their constant principles, yet to say they are not transformation is impossible. There is no being—sentient or insentient—that lacks emergence and retreat, ascent and descent, yet claims to endure.

Thus, it is said: emergence, retreat, ascent, and descent are present in all forms. Therefore, forms are the dwelling places of life and transformation. When forms disperse, they return to their constituents, and life and transformation cease. Forms refer to Heaven, Earth, and all bodies. Dwelling places refer to houses and structures. With their bodily shapes containing the repositories of the spirit and receiving the divine and numinous, they align with Heaven and Earth, hence all are called forms. All bodies are small instruments of life and transformation, while the Great Void is the vast instrument of life and transformation. The instruments of life and transformation vary in size, yet none escape dispersion.

Small and great forms alike have defined limits to their life and dispersion, with varying distances. The near does not perceive the far, and the far is said to have no bounds. The far has no constancy, yet when seen near, one sighs at its limits. Since near and far differ in their times, and merging and dispersing vary in their seasons, the interplay of presence and absence, differing perceptions, and conflicting constants arises. Yet when the time of dispersion comes, near and far alike return to a single transformation.

Of these four—emergence, retreat, ascent, and descent—constancy is most honored. These four are emergence, retreat, ascent, and descent. To have emergence and retreat, ascent and descent, is to uphold constancy. To have emergence without retreat, retreat without emergence, ascent without descent, or descent without ascent is not the *qi* of life. If one does not cultivate the Way of prenatal breathing, dwelling in constancy to sustain life, then none can block emergence and retreat or extinguish ascending and descending *qi* while preserving life and transformation. Thus, constancy is most honored.

To defy constancy brings calamity. Emergence, retreat, ascent, and descent are the fundamental principles of life and transformation, hence they cannot be neglected. To defy constancy is to drive the spirit from its dwelling, causing life and transformation to dwindle—what calamity could be greater?

Thus it is said: *Wu xing wu huan* (无形无患)—this is the meaning.

To delight in success, take pleasure in beauty, fear difficulty, dread misfortune, to suffer externally from cold winds, heat, and dampness, and internally from hunger, satiety, love, and desire—all these stem from the body having no concealment, thus constantly burdening one with cares in leisure. If one indulges in vain desires, insatiable cravings, clings to powerful factions, and indulges in false emotions, then one is ensnared by bonds and doomed to disaster. To hope for release from these chains is impossible!

Thus, the body is but a stage for breath. *Laozi* says: *"The reason I sigh deeply is that I have a body. When I have no body, what sighing shall I have?"* This is the meaning.

When the body and form dissolve into the Great Void, how can one know whether the *qi* of life and transformation gathers as having or disperses as nonexistent? The Yellow Emperor said: Well spoken. Is there any that does not generate or transform? Does this mean some escape yin and yang, evading life and transformation, yet neither generating nor transforming, beginning and ending nowhere, aligning with the naturalness of the Great Void?

Gebi said: Your question is profound! Only the True Person aligns with the Dao. The True Person’s body is hidden yet visible, elusive yet measurable, moving within and beyond Heaven and Earth. Following the Dao to its utmost truth in life, in their smallness they enter the unquestioned, and in their vastness they transcend the boundaries of emptiness. None but the Dao can achieve this unity—who else could do so?

The Yellow Emperor said: Well spoken.

**Discourse on the Great Transformations of Qi**

**Newly Revised Text:** This discourse elaborates on the transformations of interacting *qi*, detailing the matters of the Five Phases’ excess, deficiency, virtue/power (*dé*), governance, calamities, and the reversals of victory in disease.

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"When the Five Movements govern in succession, aligning with the celestial cycle, as yin and yang alternate and cold and heat follow in turn—when true and false forces converge, and inner and outer divisions arise—when the Six Canals surge and the Five *qi* shift, resulting in excess or deficiency, singular dominance or combined suppression—may I hear their origins and their constant names?"*

*"Period"* refers to 365¼ days.
*"Singular dominance"* means the governing phase of the year is in excess.
*"Combined suppression"* means the governing phase is deficient.
*"Constant names"* refers to the dissemination of virtue/power through the boundless void, and the correspondence of diseases with the body’s diagnostic forms.

**Newly Revised Text:** As the *Great Canon of Heavenly Origins* states:
*"The Five Movements succeed one another in governance, completing their allotted days before returning in cycle."*
It further says:
*"The Five *qi* move in their appointed periods."*
And the *Celestial Primordium’s Imperial Edict* declares:
*"All things derive their origin; the Five Movements complete the celestial order."*
This is the meaning of the Five Movements governing in succession, aligning with the celestial period.

Qìbó knelt twice, bowing his head in reply:
*"Your question is enlightened! This is the Way made clear. It is what the Celestial Sovereign holds dear, transmitted by the venerable teachers. Though I am unworthy, I have heard its essence in the past."*

*"Speaking of what was not innate knowledge but the transmitted wisdom of ancient masters."*

The Emperor said:
*"I have heard that if one finds the right person but does not teach them, it is called losing the Way. If transmission is not given to the proper person, the celestial treasures are recklessly divulged. My virtue is indeed meager, unworthy of receiving the supreme Dao. Yet my subjects pity that it may not reach completion, and I wish you would preserve it endlessly, extending it infinitely. If I oversee its implementation, how should I follow it?"*

*"The supreme Dao is not difficult to transmit or to know—it is difficult to practice. The Sage, moved by pity for the common people, sought to dwell with them in eternal life. Thus, he humbled himself and lowered his will, requesting transmission from the Celestial Master."*

*"The Most High values virtue/power, so he prioritizes others over himself. If not given to the right person, the Way is not bestowed in vain."*

The Emperor, desiring benevolence and far-reaching kindness, universal love, and reverence for the Way while lowering himself to save the people, said:
*"Then how should I govern its affairs and follow it?"*

Qìbó replied:
*"Let me speak fully. The *Upper Canon* says:*
*'The Dao encompasses celestial phenomena above, terrestrial geography below, and human affairs within—thus one may endure eternally. This is what is meant.'"*

*"The Dao is vast without exclusion, minute without omission, so celestial phenomena, terrestrial geography, and human affairs all harmonize."*

**Newly Revised Text:** This passage on the Dao overlaps with the text in *The Discourse on Perfecting the Teachings*.

The Emperor asked:
*"What does this mean?"*

Qìbó replied:
*"It is rooted in the positioning of *qi*. What aligns with Heaven is celestial phenomena; what aligns with Earth is terrestrial geography; what harmonizes with human *qi*’s transformations is human affairs. Thus, excess precedes Heaven’s time, deficiency lags behind it—this is called governance and response in virtue/power."*

*"The three yin and three yang govern Heaven and Earth, marking the rhythms of yin-yang generation and transformation—this is aligning with Heaven and Earth. The Five Movements reside centrally, governing the transformations of human *qi*—thus it is said to harmonize with human *qi*."*

*"Preceding and lagging behind"* refers to the timing of the governing *qi*’s transformations.

The Emperor asked:
*"How does the virtue/power of the Five Movements manifest in excess?"*

*"Excess"* means the seasonal *qi* is in surplus.

**Newly Revised Text:** The five transformations of excess are fully detailed in *The Great Canon of the Five Constants’ Governance*.

Qìbó replied:
*"When the Wood Movement is in excess, the wind-*qi* flows rampantly, and the Spleen-Earth receives evil. Because Wood is in surplus, Earth-*qi* is subdued and weakened. The people suffer from dysentery and undigested food, heaviness in the body, vexation, and distended intestines with abdominal fullness. This corresponds above to the Taixing Star [Jupiter]."*

*"Dysentery"* refers to food not digesting and exiting downward. *"Spleen deficiency"* causes food stagnation, heaviness, vexation, and abdominal distension with intestinal rumbling.

*"When the Wood seasonal *qi* is excessively strong, the Taixing Star’s light shines abnormally and lingers, and all its divisions bring calamity."*

**Newly Revised Text:** As the *Canon of Storing Qi According to Seasons* states:
*"When the Spleen is deficient, the abdomen is distended and the intestines rumble; dysentery occurs with undigested food. In severe cases, there is sudden anger, dizziness, and vertigo with head disorders."*

*"If the offense is extreme, it encounters Metal, causing self-harm."*

**Newly Revised Text:** As the *True Essence of the Jade Machine* states:
*"When the Liver pulse is in excess, it makes one prone to sudden anger, dizziness, and vertigo with head disorders. This is due to Liver excess, so this disease is not solely from Wood excess encountering Metal—Liver excess alone can also cause it."*

*"When the transforming *qi* does not govern and the generating *qi* acts alone, objects fly in the void, and grasses and trees are restless. In severe cases, they wither and fall, leading to flank pain and excessive vomiting. If the Surging Yang [Stomach pulse] is severed, death is untreatable. This corresponds above to the Taibai Star [Mercury]."*

*"In the years of the Yang phases, Wood surplus suppresses Earth, so it cannot govern all things. The generating *qi*—Wood *qi*—being in excess, acts alone in generation and transformation. Wind, not practicing virtue/power, moves without measure, causing objects in the void to fly and grasses and trees to be restless. If unrestrained, Metal overcomes it, leading to withering. Flank pain arises as Wood overcomes Earth. Surging Yang is the Stomach pulse. When Wood *qi* dominates and Earth *qi* is exhausted, death ensues. When Metal reverses and Taibai lingers abnormally, the corresponding stars are endangered."*

*"The calamity’s outbreak harms the eastern region. Internally in the body, the Spleen is first harmed—this is called ‘injuring the deceitful.’ As the *Book of Documents* says:*
*'Fullness invites loss.'"*

This is its kind.

○The newly corrected text states: Examine the three excess transformations here, saying that the celestial patterns have three examples: for Wood and Earth in motion, first mention the Yearly Viceroy, then the stars that overcome it; for Fire and Metal in motion, first mention the Wandering Star and White Star, then the stars that overcome it, and finally mention the Wandering Star again; for Water in motion, first mention the Star of the Hour, then the Viceroy Star, and finally mention the Star of the Hour again, also showing the stars it overcomes.

When the Yearly Fire is excessive, scorching heat spreads, and the Metal of the Lung receives evil *qi*. Fire, not acting with virtue/power, then harms Metal, but if it acts with virtue/power, governance becomes harmonious. The people suffer from malaria, shortness of breath, coughing and wheezing, blood overflowing, blood discharge, and dysentery. Their throats become dry, their ears deaf, and they feel heat in their chests and backs.

This corresponds to the Wandering Star. Shortness of breath means insufficient *qi* to sustain breathing. Blood discharge means frequent bloody stools. Blood overflowing means blood issuing from the orifices. Dysentery means watery diarrhea. Chest heat refers to the thoracic region. The back, being the chamber of the chest, and the shoulders being adjacent, thus both chest and shoulders feel heat.

When Fire *qi* is excessively strong, the Wandering Star’s radiance reverses and invades, bringing calamity to all its host constellations.

○The newly corrected text states: Examine how excessive Fire overcomes Metal, causing cold and heat to contend, thus producing malaria. According to *The Treatise on the Hidden *Qi* and Its Laws*, lung diseases manifest as coughing and wheezing. When the Lung is deficient, there is shortness of breath, severe inability to speak, deafness, and dryness. There is pain in the chest, fullness and pain in the ribs, heat in the chest, back, and shoulders, and pain in the inner arms.

○The newly corrected text states: According to *The Treatise on the Hidden *Qi* and Its Laws*, heart diseases manifest as chest pain, rib fullness, lower rib pain, pain in the chest, back, shoulders, and scapulae, and pain in the inner arms. The body feels hot, bones ache, and dampness spreads.

Fire, lacking virtue/power, unleashes heat to harm Metal, while Water rises in rebellion, causing Fire to self-destruct.

○The newly corrected text states: According to *The True Essence of the Jade Axle*, when the Heart pulse is excessive, it causes the body to feel hot and the skin to ache, resulting in dampness spreading. Here, "bone pain" is erroneous.

When the *qi* of gathering is blocked and the *qi* of lengthening prevails alone, rain, water, frost, and cold arise. Now, "water" should be corrected to "ice." This corresponds to the Star of the Hour. When Metal *qi* retreats and Fire *qi* moves unchecked, Water *qi* restrains it, causing rain, hail, and widespread frost and cold that kill living things. Water rebelling against Fire, the celestial omen responds, the Star of the Hour reverses and ascends, and cold calamity strikes living things.

The Star of the Hour, when afflicted, will reach the southern region. Within the body, the Lung is first harmed, then the Heart is struck in return.

○The newly corrected text states: According to *The Grand Treatise on the Five Constants*, rain, water, frost, and hail manifest as rain, ice, frost, and hail. It ascends to Minor Yin and Minor Yang, where Fire and Water conjoin, and Water and Spring interact, causing things to wither and dry up.

○The newly corrected text states: According to *The Grand Treatise on the Five Constants*, the *Record of the Six Celestial Stems* states: In years of *wuzi* to *wuyu*, the Minor Yin is ascended; in years of *wuyin* and *wushen*, the Minor Yang is ascended. When ascended, both excess and deficiency are called celestial omens. The disease manifests as delirium, madness, and wild behavior, coughing, wheezing, and groaning, with severe blood overflow, discharge, and unceasing bleeding. If the Great Abyss pulse is severed, death is untreatable. This corresponds to the Wandering Star. These are the years of *wu*.

In *wuyu* and *wuzhi* years, Minor Yin ascends; in *wuyin* and *wushen* years, Minor Yang ascends—these are called the years of celestial omens. The Great Abyss is the Lung pulse. Fire overcomes Metal, hence death.

Fire, already excessive, is further inflamed by the ascending heat, with two Fires merging, thus the body withers. The Wandering Star invades in reverse, endangering all its host constellations.

○The newly corrected text states: Examine *wu* years of *wuchen* and *wuxu*, where the Greater Yang is seen—this is called the celestial punishment cycle. Thus, though it should flourish, it does not, causing the Fire transformation to falter, neither excessive nor deficient.

When the Yearly Earth is excessive, dampness spreads with the rain, and the Kidney Water receives evil *qi*. Earth, lacking virtue/power, thus behaves. The people suffer from abdominal pain, cold limbs, and a gloomy, discontented spirit. Their bodies feel heavy and they are troubled.

This corresponds to the Viceroy Star. Abdominal pain means pain in both the upper and lower abdomen. Cold limbs mean coldness in the feet. A discontented spirit is as if burdened by hidden sorrow. Earth assaults Water, the celestial omen responds, the Viceroy Star reverses and invades, and its host constellations suffer calamity.

○The newly corrected text states: According to *The Treatise on the Hidden *Qi* and Its Laws*, kidney diseases manifest as heaviness in the body. When the Kidney is deficient, there is pain in the upper and lower abdomen, cold limbs, and a discontented spirit. Severe cases lead to withered flesh, withered feet that cannot be lifted, difficulty walking, pain beneath the feet, fullness in the middle from drinking, reduced appetite, and inability to raise the limbs. The Spleen governs flesh and externally corresponds to the limbs, and its pulse arises from the tip of the big toe, following the inner side of the shinbone, then obliquely emerging to network the groin. Thus, the disease manifests as such.

○The newly corrected text states: According to *The Treatise on the Hidden *Qi* and Its Laws*, spleen diseases manifest as heaviness in the body and excessive hunger; withered flesh, withered feet that cannot be lifted, difficulty walking, and pain beneath the feet. Again, according to *The True Essence of the Jade Axle*, when the Spleen is excessive, it causes the limbs to be unable to rise.

When the hidden *qi* is suppressed and the transforming *qi* governs alone, springs surge and rivers overflow, dried marshes teem with fish, torrential winds and rains arrive, earthen banks collapse, and fish scales appear on land. The disease manifests as abdominal fullness, diarrhea, and intestinal groaning, with severe downward discharge. If the Great Ravine pulse is severed, death is untreatable.

○The newly corrected text states: According to *The Treatise on the Hidden *Qi* and Its Laws*, when the Spleen is deficient, the abdomen becomes full, the intestines groan, and there is diarrhea without proper digestion of food.

The excessive *Metal* of the Year of the *Stem* (甲) [i.e., the Year of the *Stem*-*Metal* cycle], when its *qi* flows rampantly, harms the *Liver*-*Wood*. Such is the violence of *Metal* in excess. The people suffer pain in the flanks beneath the breasts, in the lower abdomen near the navel, and within the pelvic bones. Their eyes turn red in the whites, their pain extends to the inner corners of the eyelids, and their ears lose their hearing.

The flanks refer to the region beneath the breasts on both sides. The lower abdomen refers to the area below the navel on both sides, within the pelvic bones. When the whites of the eyes turn red, it is called *赤目* (chì mù). Pain here refers to the inner corners of the eyelids. The inner corners of the eyelids are the roots of the four eyelid margins.

The *Metal* of the Year of the *Stem* [甲] corresponds to the *Year Star* (歲星). When *Metal* is excessive, it suppresses the *Water* hidden *qi*, and the *Wood* *qi* alone governs. Thus, the *Wood* overcomes the *Earth* and *Metal* is restored, leading to violent winds and rains, surging springs, and overflowing rivers. The withered marshes teem with fish, and when dampness is extreme, the winds further agitate it, causing earthen banks to collapse and fall. The collapse of earthen banks refers to walls crumbling, embankments toppling, and mountains crumbling into the earth. Overflowing rivers and surging springs, along with the flourishing of fish and aquatic creatures, result in their abundance appearing on land. The *Great Ravine* pulse [太溪] is the *Kidney* pulse. When *Earth* overpowers and the *Water* is severed, death ensues. If *Wood* comes to weaken *Earth*, the celestial omens are inauspicious, and when this aligns with its inherent seasonal affinity, it is indeed a cause for concern.

When the *Metal* season is excessively severe, the body feels heavy and oppressed, the chest aches and the pain draws the back, and the sides are distended and painful, extending to the lower abdomen. This corresponds to the celestial omen of the **Great White Star** [太白星].

If the *Metal* season has passed but its severity lingers, *Wood* is internally subdued and succumbs to pathogenic influence, giving rise to disease. When *Metal* dominates the heavens, the **Great White Star** [太白星] shines brightly, and if it aligns with the **Host Constellation** [宿属], the heart suffers calamity. The newly revised annotation states: According to the *Theory of Stored Qi Following the Seasons* [藏气法时论], those with *Liver* disease experience pain beneath both sides, extending to the lower abdomen. If the *Liver* is depleted, the eyes become dull and indistinct, and the ears hear nothing. Additionally, the *True Essence of Jade Machinery* [玉机真藏论] states: If the *Liver* pulse is weak, it causes chest pain that draws the back, and the sides become taut and distended. When severe, it leads to wheezing, coughing, and reverse *Qi* flow [逆气], shoulder and back pain, and ailments of the **Scrotum** [尸阴], thighs, knees, **Spleen** [脾], **End Organs** [腑], and feet. This corresponds to the celestial omen of the **Blazing Intruder Star** [荧惑星]. The *Fire* season restores equilibrium, and disease naturally arises. The heavens manifest these signs through the **Blazing Intruder Star** [荧惑星]. If it aligns with the **Host Constellation** [宿属] in reverse, this is indeed a cause for concern.

The newly revised annotation states: According to the *Theory of Stored Qi Following the Seasons* [藏气法时论], those with *Lung* disease experience wheezing, coughing, and reverse *Qi* flow [逆气], shoulder and back pain, spontaneous sweating, and pain in the **Scrotum** [尸阴], thighs, knees, **Spleen** [脾] extremities, **End Organs** [腑], and feet. When the season’s *Metal* *Qi* is harsh and its *Fire* *Qi* is weak, the *Wood* season’s *Qi* is suppressed, and the *Fire* season’s *Qi* alone thrives; or when the *Fire* season’s *Qi* fails to restrain the *Metal* *Qi*, and the *Metal* season’s *Qi* alone dominates, the *Earth* season’s *Qi* is stifled, and the *Earth* season’s *Qi* alone governs.

When the *Metal* season’s *Qi* is excessively severe, the **Scrotum** [尸阴] and **Kidney** [肾] are affected. The newly revised annotation states: According to the *Theory of Stored Qi Following the Seasons* [藏气法时论], those with *Kidney* disease experience abdominal distension and **channel** swelling [经肿], wheezing, coughing, and body heaviness, nighttime sweating, and aversion to wind. When the *Metal* season’s *Qi* is excessively severe and undergoes five transformations, the *Wood* season’s *Qi* fails to govern its own season, and the *Fire* season’s *Qi* alone thrives; or when the *Fire* season’s *Qi* cannot restrain the *Metal* season’s *Qi*, and the *Metal* season’s *Qi* alone shines brightly; or when the *Earth* season’s *Qi* is stifled, and the *Earth* season’s *Qi* alone governs...

When the *Metal* season’s *Qi* is excessively severe, the **Scrotum** [尸阴] and **Kidney** [肾] are affected. The newly revised annotation states: According to the *Theory of Stored Qi Following the Seasons* [藏气法时论], those with *Kidney* disease experience abdominal distension and **channel** swelling [经肿], wheezing, coughing, nighttime sweating, and aversion to wind.

In severe cases, the *Metal* season’s *Qi* is so sharp that the **Kidney** *Qi* descends, while the *Water* season’s *Qi* alone thrives, and the **Earth** season’s *Qi* loses governance. The line “今独亡者” is missing text—likely an error.

When great rains arrive, dust and mist grow thick and hazy. This corresponds above to the **Zhen** star [辰星]. If the *Water* season’s *Qi* remains excessive, the **Earth** season’s *Qi* will overpower it, so this sign appears: dust and mist thicken, revealing the **Earth** season’s *Qi*.

The **Kidney**’s **channel** [脉] ascends from the sole, passes through the abdomen, and from the kidneys, pierces the liver and diaphragm, entering the lungs, then follows the throat. Thus, this disease arises.

The **Kidney** is *yin*, so nighttime sweating and aversion to wind occur. Sweating while sleeping is the disease itself.

When the **Earth** season’s *Qi* prevails, it weakens the *Water* season’s excess, so the **Zhen** star [辰星] shines brightly, manifesting its correspondence. If the **Earth** season’s *Qi* dominates in the **Taiyang** [太阳] region, ice, snow, and frost descend untimely, and dampness alters substances.

The newly revised annotation states: According to the *Great Treatise on the Five Constants’ Governance* [五常政大论], in the **Taiyang** region, the *Water* season’s *Qi* spreads upward, and the **Earth** season’s *Qi* fails to transform.

Again, the *Great Treatise on the Six Elements’ True Sequence* [六元正纪大论] states: In the years of **Jingchen** [丙辰] and **Jingxu** [丙戌], the *Water* season’s *Qi* ascends into the **Taiyang** region. When the *Water* season’s *Qi* is either excessive or deficient, it is called a **Heavenly Omen** [天符].

The disease reverses to abdominal fullness and intestinal rumbling, **undigested food** [飧泄] and failure to assimilate food. The newly revised annotation states: According to the *Theory of Stored Qi Following the Seasons* [藏气法时论], if the **Spleen** [脾] is depleted, abdominal fullness and intestinal rumbling occur, **undigested food** [飧泄] appears, and food fails to assimilate.

With thirst and **false perception** [妄冒], when the **Spirit Gate** [神门] is cut off, death is inevitable—no cure. This corresponds above to **Yinghuo** [荧惑] and the **Zhen** star [辰星]. All these signs appear in the **Jing** years [丙岁].

The **Jing** years [丙辰、丙戌]—when **Taiyang** [太阳] *Qi* ascends above—are called the **Heavenly Omen** [天符] years.

When the **Cold** *Qi* [寒气] is excessive, rain transforms into ice and snow, and when ice forms, it becomes **hail** [雹]. If frost descends untimely, it reveals the **Cold**’s severity.

When **Earth** [土] restores its **Water** [水], there is prolonged heavy rain—**congealed rain** [霖霪]. With deep internal **Humidity** *Qi* [湿气], all things become damp and altered.

The **Spirit Gate** [神门]—the **Heart**’s pulse [心脉]—when **Water** *Qi* is excessive and **Fire** *Qi* is depleted, death ensues. When **Water** *Qi* is excessive and **Fire** *Qi* is strong, **Yinghuo** [荧惑] blazes fiercely, and the **Zhen** star [辰星] shines brightly. If this is compounded by **inverse control of the lodging** [逆守宿], the outcome is perilous—**danger of extinction** [危亡].

○ The newly revised annotation states: Examining the **Five Phases** [五化] in terms of excess, it is recorded that **Fire** and **Water** *Qi* ascending above are the **Heavenly Omens** [天符]. **Fire** ascending upon **Fire** and **Water** ascending upon **Water** are both **Heavenly Omens** [天符].

**Fire** ascending upon **Water** is **inverse** [逆], **Water** ascending upon **Wood** is **harmonious** [顺], **Fire** ascending upon **Earth** is **harmonious** [顺], **Water** ascending upon **Earth** is **Earth overcoming Heaven** [运胜天], **Fire** ascending upon **Metal** is **Heavenly Punishment overcoming the cycle** [天刑运], and **Water** ascending upon **Metal** is **inverse** [逆]. The remaining cases are not detailed here. Again, this text only mentions the **Yinghuo** and **Zhen** stars as examples, but the rest can be inferred accordingly.

The Emperor said: *"Well said."* [善]

When the **Five Phases** are deficient, what then?

It is said: *"The governance and transformations are insufficient."* [政化少]

○ *Newly Corrected Version* notes: The deficiencies of the **Five Phases** are fully detailed in *"The Great Treatise on the Five Constant Governances"* [《五常政大论》].

**Ghibol** [岐伯] replied: *"Your inquiry is thorough indeed!* When the **Year Phase of Wood** is deficient, the **Dryness** [燥] phase prevails greatly. The **Clear and Resonant** [清玲] winds arrive on time, accompanied by a slight chill—this is called **Dryness Qi** [燥气]. **Dryness** is the essence of **Metal Qi** [金气].

When the **Generative Qi** [生气] fails to respond, grasses and trees flourish late, which is called *"losing their appointed time"* [后时之谓失应]. When **Austerity and Killing** [肃杀] are extreme, the **rigid Wood** [刚木] splits and cracks, the **soft Wood** [柔] withers, turning **ashen-green** [苍] and dry—this corresponds above to the **Tai Bai Star** [太白星].

The **Heaven and Earth** grow mournful, the sun appears dimmed, with rain that is not rain and clear skies that are not clear. The people’s spirits grow despondent, the atmosphere thickens and contracts—this is when **Austerity and Killing** are extreme.

**Rigid** [刚] means **unyielding and hard** [劲硬].
**Splitting and cracking** [辟着] refers to the branches and stems splitting and drying without falling.
**Soft** [柔] means **pliant**.
**Ashen-green** [苍] means **green**—the leaves of the soft Wood turn a fixed green while drying and curling.

When the **Wood Qi** is deficient, **Metal Qi** overpowers it, and the brilliance of **Tai Bai** shines with radiant light across the void.

The people suffer from **central coldness** [中清], **flank and rib pain** [肪胁痛], **lower abdominal pain** [少腹痛], **intestinal rumbling and diarrhea** [肠呜塘泄], and **freezing rain** arrives on time—this corresponds above to the **Tai Bai Star**.

○ *Newly Corrected Version* notes: Regarding the deficiencies of the **Five Phases**, the people’s ailments and their corresponding stars are all described as *"the Running Stars losing their luster"* [运星失色], *"the Fear Stars pressing upon them"* [畏星加临], and *"the Hosts bringing calamity"* [宿属为灾]. Here, only the **Fear Star** is mentioned, without the **Running Star**, due to an omission in the original text. It should read: *"corresponding above to the **Tai Bai Star** and the **Sui Star**"* [上应太白星、岁星].

The grains turn **ashen-green** [苍].

The **Metal qi** overacting upon **Wood**—this is the disease of the **Liver**.
Those who are overborne by this **qi** will have **rumbling in the intestines** and **diarrhea**, yet will lack **flank and rib pain** or **lower abdominal pain**.
In mild cases, it will abate; in severe cases, it will cease. When **Summer’s qi** arrives, it will also cease, but when **Autumn’s qi** comes, it will recur.
The **cool rain** arrives on time—meaning it comes when it should, for **Metal and Earth** harmonize in their transformations, so **freezing rain** follows together.
When **Fire qi** returns, **Summer rain** diminishes.

When **Metal** overcomes **Wood**, the **Tai Bai Star** descends upon it, and all its **host constellations** bring calamity.
If **Metal** dominates the entire year, **Fire qi** does not return, and thus the **ashen-green grains** will not bear fruit.

○ *Newly Corrected Version* notes: Examining **central coldness**, **flank and rib pain**, and **lower abdominal pain** as the signs of **Metal overacting upon Wood**—the **Liver’s** disease.
**Intestinal rumbling and diarrhea** are the symptoms of **Spleen** disease.
For when **Wood is deficient**, the **Spleen-Earth** lacks restraint, and in arrogance, it receives **Pathogenic Evil** instead.
When **Yangming** ascends above, **Generative qi** loses its governance, and **grass and trees** bloom again.
The **transformative qi** grows urgent, corresponding above to the **Tai Bai** and **Zhen Stars**, which govern the **early ashen-green**.
These are the **Ding years**—**Dingmao** and **Dingyou**—when **Yangming** ascends above, known as the **"Heavenly Punishment"** years.
**Metal qi**, obeying **Heaven**, dominates below and overcomes **Wood**, so **Generative qi** loses its governance, and **grass and trees** bloom again.
When **Generative qi** loses its governance, **Wood’s** blossoms open late.
**Metal** suppresses **Wood**, so **Autumn and Summer** begin to flourish, and fruits mature early due to the urgency of the **transformative qi**, thus completing their growth late.
When **Metal** overcomes **Wood**, **Heaven** responds in kind, so the **Tai Bai Star** appears with radiant brilliance.
Since **Wood qi** is scarce and **Earth qi** lacks restraint, the **transformative qi** grows and matures rapidly.
When **Wood is deficient** and **Metal prevails**, **Heaven’s qi** aligns, so the **Zhen Star**, along with **Tai Bai**, becomes both **moist and luminous**.
Ashen-green things wither and fall early, for **Wood is deficient** and **Metal** overacts.

○ *Newly Corrected Version* notes: Regarding the deficiencies of the **Five Phases**, only **Wood ascending upon Yangming**, **Earth ascending upon Jueyin**, and **Water ascending upon Taiyin** are recorded, omitting **Wood ascending upon Jueyin**, **Earth ascending upon Taiyin**, and **Metal ascending upon Yangming**, for the text records only the most extreme cases.
Thus, in **excess cycles**, only **"Fire upon Fire"** and **"Water upon Water"** are mentioned.
Here, in **deficient cycles**, only **"Wood upon Metal"**, **"Earth upon Wood"**, and **"Water upon Earth"** are recorded.
Hence, it does not mention **"Jueyin upon Wood"**, **"Taiyin upon Earth"**, or **"Yangming upon Metal"**.

When **Fire** returns to **Metal**, scorching heat flows, and the **damp nature** turns dry, causing tender and fragile plants to wither and die.
The lower growths regenerate, and **blossoms and fruits** transform together.
Diseases of **chill, fever, sores, ulcers, numbness, miscarriage, and paralysis** arise, corresponding above to **Hengxing** and **Tai Bai Stars**, and the grains become **white and hard**.

When **Fire** returns to **Metal**, **Summer’s great heat** emerges, so all things’ **damp nature** shifts to dryness.
The **scorching Fire** consumes them, so tender plants, creeping vines, and sprawling growths all **wither and die above**, while their lower parts regenerate.
If they are **hot and pungent grasses**, they will not regenerate.
With **mild heat**, few die; with **great heat**, many perish.
When the **Fire’s return** has passed, **Earth qi** arrives, and **freezing rain** descends.
The **sour, bitter, sweet, and salty**—those of **cold nature**—then regenerate anew, and the **newly opened** and the **previously formed** mature together under the **transformative qi**.
When **Fire** returns to **Metal**, the **Tai Bai Star** blazes, and **Hengxing** ascends above, its light overflowing and its **host constellations** bringing calamity.

Because **Fire** reverses its course, the **white and hard grains** sprout but do not bear fruit.
**White Dew** descends early, and the **Killing qi** spreads, as **cold rain** harms the plants.
**Insects** consume the **sweet and yellow** crops, and the **Spleen-Earth** receives **Pathogenic Evil**.
The **red qi** transforms late, the **Heart qi** governs tardily, and **Metal’s white qi** is subdued, so the grains do not mature.
There is **coughing and sighing**, corresponding above to **Hengxing** and **Tai Bai Stars**.

When **Yangming** ascends above, **Metal** takes its course, so **White Dew** descends early.
When **cold and chill** arrive greatly, the **Killing qi** spreads.
Since **Taiyang** resides in the **Earth-damp** position, **cold and damp** combine, so **cold rain** harms the plants, reducing their yield.
**Metal** moves to subdue **Wood**, borrowing the path through **Earth**, for **Child** is within **Mother**—the **insect symbol**.
Thus, **sweet and yellow** things are eaten by **insects and grubs**.
**Cool qi** prevails first, then **heat qi** returns, and when it returns, it prevails again, so the **red Fire qi** transforms late.
**"Red transforms late"** means that **red blossoms** and **red fruits** bloom and mature again at a later time.
As for the **Five Zang**, the **Heart qi** reigns late, overcoming the **Lungs**, so when the **Heart** overcomes the **Lungs**, **Metal’s white qi** is subdued and retreats.
**Metal grains**—**rice**—are affected.
**Cruel**—nasal discharge—occurs.
When **Fire** overcomes **Metal**, **Heaven’s symbols** respond in kind, so the **Tai Bai Star’s** rays dim, while **Hengxing** grows brighter.

When **Fire is deficient** and **Water prevails**, **cold** spreads greatly, and the **Long Official** does not govern.
Things grow **low and stunted**, their **vitality suppressed and severe**, so **Yang qi** fails to transform, and their **blossoms wither**.
This corresponds above to the **Chen Star**.

The people suffer from **chest pain**, **flank distension**, **bilateral rib pain**, **pain in the chest, back, shoulders, scapulae, and inner arms**.
○ *Newly Corrected Version* notes: These symptoms align with the signs of **Fire excess**, even to the point of **reverse disease**, as seen in the *Zangqi Fashishu Lun*.

They experience **obscured confusion**, **sudden heart pain**, **violent sores**, **distended chest and abdomen**, and **pain in the flanks and lower back radiating to each other**.
○ *Newly Corrected Version* notes: According to the *Zangqi Fashishu Lun*, when the **Heart is empty**, the **chest and abdomen distend**, and **pain in the flanks and lower back radiates to each other**.
In severe cases, they cannot straighten, and their **hips** feel as if **separated**.
This corresponds above to **Hengxing** and **Chen Stars**, and the grains become **crimson**.
These are the **Gui years**.

The breath stirs, for its pulse moves thus. When **Fire-qi** does not circulate, **Cold-qi** restrains and solidifies, the hips feel as if separated, and bending is impossible.

When **Water** overpowers **Fire**, **Hengxing** dims its brilliance, the **crimson grains** fail to ripen, and **Chen Star** invades its host’s division—then all bring calamity.

When **Eclipse** looms, dust clouds gather, and great rain is near, **Black-qi** brings humiliation. The sick suffer **startled fright**, **diarrhea**, **abdominal distension**, and **inability to eat or drink**. **Cold invades the intestines**, causing **rumbling**, **diarrhea**, and **abdominal pain**. Sudden **spasms**, **atrophy**, and **paralysis** strike, leaving the feet unable to bear the body—corresponding above to **Zhen Star** and **Chen Star**, and the **playthorn grains** failing to form.

**Eclipse** and clouded rain are the **Earth’s** work. **Cold-qi**, further split by **Dampness**, seeps inward, giving rise to **abdominal ailments** and **heaviness of the body**—thus the symptoms.

**Black-qi** is **Water-qi**. **Humiliation** means **subjugation**. **Capon** (音木) refers to the **duck**.

When **Earth** eclipses **Water**, **Zhen Star** shines moist and luminous, invading its host’s division—then the people suffer sickness and disaster.

The year’s Earth-qi is insufficient, so the Wind grows rampant.
The transforming *qi* does not act in order, and grasses and trees flourish luxuriantly,
yet they sway wildly without bearing fruit—corresponding above to the **Jupiter Star**.
Wood lacks *virtue*.
When Wood-*qi* acts alone, the transforming *qi* does not proceed in order.
When the vital *qi* monopolizes, grasses and trees flourish luxuriantly.
Their wild swaying is Wood’s lack of *virtue*.
Earth-*qi* is thin and scarce, so things fail to mature.
"Unfruitful" refers to *píwù* (枇恶).

When Earth is insufficient, Wood overpowers it,
so Jupiter’s appearance is moist and luminous, invading its host’s division.
The people suffer **diarrhea, dysentery, and cholera**,
with **body heaviness, abdominal pain, trembling tendons and bones, aching muscles, irritability**,
and **latent *qi* acting violently**, **parasites attaching early**—all falling ill with **cold invasion**.
Above, it corresponds to **Jupiter and Zhen Star**, and the grains **fail to form**.
These are the **years of *ji* (己)**.
When Wind invades the **crown**, the illnesses are as described.
Earth-*qi* being insufficient, Water aligns with its transformation,
so latent *qi* acts violently, and parasites attach early to where **Yang-*qi* resides**,
and all fall ill with **cold invasion diseases**.

*Yáo* (繇) means **to tremble**.
When tendons and bones tremble, it is called *xìngfú* (县复), then *sūnfú* (孙复).
Earth, suppressed and unable to stretch,
if Jupiter invades its host’s division, all suffer disaster.

---
**Newly corrected text states:**
Examining this passage, *jīnggǔ sīfú* (筋骨丝复) is mentioned.
Though Wang [Zhizhi] annotated it, the meaning remains unclear.
Referring to *The Essentials of the Most Authentic Great Treatise* (*Zhìzhēn Yàodà Lùn*), it states: *jīnggǔ yáo bìng* (筋骨繇并).
It is likely that *fú* (复) is a mistake for *bìng* (并).
When *fú* (复) governs, policies grow strict and severe,
trees wither and turn black, the chest and ribs ache violently,
pain radiating downward to the lower abdomen, with frequent sighing.
Worms consume sweet and bitter foods, *qi* invades the Spleen,
grain production decreases, the people eat little and lose taste,
and *cānggǔ* (苍谷) is diminished.
Metal restrains Wood, so trees wither and turn black.
Metal enters Earth—**mother containing child**—
so sweet and bitter foods are consumed by worms.
Metal entering Earth causes *qi* to invade the Spleen.
When Metal-*qi* arrives in force, it clashes with Earth,
so grain production diminishes, and grains fail to form.
Above, it corresponds to **Venus and Jupiter**.
Venus’s rays flourish, and Jupiter’s light diminishes.
*(Six missing characters in the text.)*
When it governs **Jueyin**, flowing water does not freeze,
parasites appear early, latent *qi* does not act,
and White (Venus) does not return—corresponding above to Jupiter,
and the people recover.
In **ji-sì (己巳) and ji-hài (己亥) years**, Jueyin governs above,
and *shàoyáng* (少阳) is at the spring,
Fire presiding over Earth, so parasites appear early,
and flowing water does not freeze.
Metal cannot return, so Jupiter’s appearance is normal,
and the people are healthy and free of illness.

---
**Newly corrected text states:**
Examining Wood’s insufficiency when governing **Yangming**,
and Water’s insufficiency when governing **Taiyin**,
both are mentioned later under *fú* (复).
Here, it first speaks of *fú* (复) before citing the governing divisions,
as White (Venus) does not return—
this year having *fú* (复) would be inappropriate.

When the year’s Metal is insufficient, **flaming Fire** acts,
the vital *qi* is employed, the **long-term *qi*** prevails,
and all things flourish.
Dryness and scorching spread—corresponding above to **Mars**.
Fire does not practice *virtue* but seizes Metal’s peril,
and as flaming Fire flows, great summer heat arises.
When vital *qi* is employed, all things multiply and flourish.
When scorching dryness arrives, things cannot endure it—
scorching prevails, melting stone and gold,
drying up springs and scorching grass,
mountains and marshes ablaze, and rain does not fall.
When flaming Fire is extreme, celestial omens respond,
and Mars appears great and bright.
The people suffer **shoulder and back stiffness, snoring, and epistaxis**,
with **constipation**—corresponding above to **Venus**,
and the grains are **hard and sharp**.
These are the **years of *yǐ* (乙)**.
*Xiāng* (香) means **to ask**—
illness arising from receiving heat evil.
*Shōu* (收) is Metal-*qi*.
Fire first prevails, so constipation occurs later.
When Fire overpowers Metal, Metal cannot flourish,
and if Mars retrogrades and guards,
the host’s division all suffer illness.

---
**Newly corrected text states:**
Examining *jīngu* (坚芒) being white and visible,
it does not say *jīngu bái* (其谷白).
The text states "corresponding above to Venus,"
following the pattern of before and after,
and the text omits *Xīnghuò* (荧惑).
Further examining Wang’s annotation on Mars retrograding,
it confirms the text’s omission.

---
When *fú* (复) occurs, **cold rain falls violently**,
then **hail and sleet descend**, frost and snow kill growth,
**Yin-jue** strikes, and **Yang reverses upward**,
causing **head and brain-door pain**, extending to the crown,
with **fever**—corresponding above to **Chen Star**.
**Newly corrected text states:**
When the *bùjí* (不及) cycle governs,
the conquering *qi* prevails, and the **child-*qi* returns**—
after the return, the conquering star shines brightly,
and the *fú* (复) star is clear and great.
Here, it only states "corresponding above to Chen Star,"
but does not mention Mars—
the text is incomplete.
It should read: *corresponding above to Chen Star and Mars*.
*Dāngǔ* (丹谷) fails to form, and the people suffer **mouth ulcers**,
and in severe cases, **heart pain**.
When cold-*qi* restrains Fire, hail and frost appear,
with hail first injuring and frost later damaging—
both are the norm of cold-*qi*.
The disasters harm **red transformation**.
All cases where insufficiency is overpowered by conquest,
and child-*qi* returns, belong to their respective directions.
**Yin-jue** means **cold inversion**.
*Gé* (格) means **arrival** or **repulse**.
Water acts to restrain Fire, aiding constrained Metal,
and celestial omens respond—Chen Star shines clear.
Red grains are damaged by frost and hail.
When the year’s Water is insufficient, **Dampness** grows rampant,
the **long-term *qi*** acts in reverse, and its transformation accelerates,
with **summer rains frequent**—corresponding above to **Zhen Star**.
**Dampness** rampant means **frequent rains**.
**Transformation accelerating** means **early maturation**.
Fire and Dampness align in transformation,
so summer rains are frequent, overpowering insufficient Water
while Earth prevails—Zhen Star’s symbol grows brighter,
inversely lingering and invading, even more so.
The people suffer **abdominal fullness, body heaviness, watery diarrhea, cold sores draining fluid,**
**lumbar and hip pain, stiff hamstrings and knees,**
**restlessness, leg weakness, and cold inversion,**
with **foot pain**, and in severe cases, **edema**.
Latent *qi* does not govern, and **Kidney-*qi* is unbalanced**—
corresponding above to **Chen Star**, and the grains are *jù* (秬).

The latent *qi* fails to enforce its governance,
so **Kidney-*qi* cannot internally harmonize and balance**.
*Corresponding* (to this imbalance), **Chen Star’s** brilliance should be diminished—
yet if **Zhen Star** dominates the *shù* (宿) of its domain, then disaster ensues.

**Newly corrected text states**: The *Classic* records "corresponding above to **Chen Star**," but the annotation mistakenly reads **Zhen Star**; comparing earlier and later passages reveals the omission of these two characters here.

When **Taiyin** (太阴) is ascendant above,
frequent severe colds arise, *dìchóng* (垫虫) retreat early,
the earth accumulates solid ice, and **Yang light** fails to prevail.
The people suffer **lower-body cold ailments**, and in severe cases,
**abdominal distension and floating edema**—corresponding above to **Zhen Star**.

**Newly corrected text states**: The *Classic* notes "Wood insufficient" and "ascendant above **Yangming**," corresponding to **Tai Bai** (太白) and **Zhen Star**; here, only **Zhen Star** is mentioned, omitting **Xinghuo** (荧惑), indicating a textual lacuna.

Since **Water is insufficient** and **Taiyin** ascends above,
**Zhen Star’s** brilliance surges, aligning with **Earth-*qi*’s** dominance.
As **Water weakens further**, **Xinghuo** grows bold and radiant.
This governs the grains—**specifically in *xīn* (辛) years**.

In **Xīn-Chǒu** (辛丑) and **Xīn-Wèi** (辛未) years,
when **Taiyin** ascends above and **Taiyang** (太阳) resides in **Quán** (泉),
frequent severe colds arise.
**Earth-*qi*’s** dominance makes **Zhen Star** brighter still,
and the **wonder grains** flourish in accordance with Heaven’s cycle.

When **Wood** violently revives,
sudden fierce winds erupt, grasses wither, and trees fall.
Life does not thrive, complexions shift, tendons and bones fracture,
flesh atrophies, eyes bulge with a *hēng-hēng* (吭吭) sound,
creatures scatter and perish, skin and muscle wither,
*qi* stagnates in the **Lì** (鬲),
pain grips the heart and abdomen, **Yellow-*qi*** diminishes,
and the grains fail to mature—corresponding above to **Suìxīng** (岁星).

**Wood** overpowers **Earth**, so **Yellow-*qi*** declines,
and the **sacrificial grains** do not ripen—meaning the harvest is insufficient for offerings.
When **Wood-*qi*** violently revives and **Suìxīng** descends over the *shù* (宿) of its domain,
disaster ensues.

**Newly corrected text states**: This should read "corresponding above to **Suìxīng** and **Zhen Star**." *(Note: 茔 [yìn] sounds like "question")*

The Emperor said: "Excellent. I wish to hear of their timing as well."
Gebi said: "Your inquiry is thorough indeed. When **Wood** does not reach its full measure,
spring manifests the **vernal breath** (呜条) and **unobstructed harmony** (律畅) of its transformation,
then autumn brings the **mist, dew, and clear frost** (雾露清冻) of its governance.
When spring exhibits the **harsh and cruel** (惨凄) **depredations** (残贼) of **Metal-*qi*** (金气) in victory,
summer yields to the **scorching heat** (炎暑) and **consuming brilliance** (墦烁) of **Fire-*qi*** in response.
Its **virtue** (德) is the **Eastern Green** (青东), the **harmonizing breath** (和气).
Its **victory** (胜) is **Metal-*qi***, its **response** (复) is **Fire-*qi***.
When **Fire-*qi*** overpowers **Metal-*qi***, it is all due to **Wood**.
Thus, when disasters of the **Eastern Green** arise, they all manifest in the east.
The remaining **Greens** are the same.

*(Newly corrected text states:)* The **Wood** and **Fire** not reaching their full measure,
first describes the **transformations and governance** of spring and summer,
then the **victory and response** of autumn and winter.
Its **abode** (藏) is the liver, its **illness** (病) lodges internally in the **flanks and abdomen** (肚胁),
externally in the **joints** (关节).
The east is the **domain** (主) of the liver.
When **Fire-*qi*** does not reach its full measure,
summer displays the **radiant and luminous** (炳明光显) **transformation**,
then winter enforces the **stern and austere** (严肃) **frost and cold** (霜寒) of its governance.
When summer exhibits the **harsh and cruel** (惨赓) **freezing severity** (凝冽) of **Water-*qi*** in victory,
then **Earth-*qi*** responds with **obscuring dust and sudden downpours** (埃昏大雨) at an untimely hour.
Its **virtue** (德) is the **Southern Red** (告南), the **virtue of Fire** (火德).
Its **victory** (胜) is **Water’s tyranny** (水虐), its **response** (复) is **Earth’s alteration** (土变).
The south is the **domain** (主) of Fire.
Its **abode** (藏) is the heart, its **illness** (病) lodges internally in the **chest and flanks** (膺胁),
externally in the **meridians and networks** (经络).
The **four cardinal directions** (四维) are the **domain** (主) of the central **spleen** (脾).
When **Metal-*qi*** does not reach its full measure,
summer issues the **luminous and oppressive** (光显郁蒸) **decree** (令),
then winter answers with the **stern, cold, and orderly** (严凝整肃) **resonance** (应).
When summer unleashes the **scorching and consuming** (炎烁墦燎) **alterations** (变),
then autumn responds with the **rigorous and killing** (肃杀) **prolonged rains** (霖霪) in disaster.
Its **virtue** (德) is the **four cardinal directions** (四维), the **four corners** (东南、东北、西南、西北).
**维** (维) means **corner** (隅), referring to the sun in the four corners of the heavens, the **moon** (月).
*(Newly corrected text states:)* When **Earth-*qi*** does not reach its full measure,
it first describes the **governance and transformation**, then the **victory and response**.
Its **abode** (藏) is the spleen, its **illness** (病) lodges internally in the **chest and abdomen** (心腹),
externally in the **muscles and four limbs** (肌肉四支).
The **four cardinal directions** (四维) are the **domain** (主) of the central spleen.
When **Water-*qi*** does not reach its full measure,
summer issues the **luminous and oppressive** (光显郁蒸) **decree** (令),
then autumn responds with the **rigorous and killing** (肃杀) **prolonged rains** (霖霪) in disaster.
Its **abode** (藏) is the lung, its **illness** (病) lodges internally in the **chest, flanks, shoulders, and back** (膺胁肩背),
externally in the **skin and fur** (皮毛).
The west is the **domain** (主) of the lung.
When **Water-*qi*** does not reach its full measure,
the **four cardinal directions** (四维) display the **turbulent and moist** (湍润) **dust and clouds** (埃云) of its transformation,
then **Fire-*qi*** answers with **harmonious winds** (和风) at an untimely hour.
When the **four cardinal directions** (四维) unleash the **obscuring dust and sudden downpours** (埃昏骤注) of its **alteration** (变),
then **Fire-*qi*** responds with **floating and whirling** (飘荡振拉) at an untimely hour.
Its **virtue** (德) is the **Northern Black** (青北), the **floating and whirling** (飘荡振拉),
the **disasters wrought by great winds** (大风所作).

*(Newly corrected text states:)* When **Metal-*qi*** and **Water-*qi*** do not reach their full measure,
it first describes the **transformations and decrees** of **Fire-*qi*** and **Earth-*qi***,
then the **victory and response** of their alterations.
This differs from the **Wood-*qi***, **Fire-*qi***, and **Earth-*qi*** precedents in its **interwoven phrasing** (互文).
Its **abode** (藏) is the kidney, its **illness** (病) lodges internally in the **loins, spine, bone marrow** (腰脊骨髓),
externally in the **valleys and ravines** (溪谷) and **knees and ankles** (踹膝).
The **great assembly** (大会) of flesh is the **valley** (谷),
the **small assembly** (小会) of flesh is the **ravine** (溪).
Between the **divisions of flesh** (肉分), the **ravines and valleys** (溪谷) gather,
to conduct the **nutritive and defensive** (荣卫) **breaths** (气),
and to **converge with the great *qi*** (会大气).

The **governance** (政) of the Five Movements (五运)
is akin to **weights and measures** (权衡).
The **high** (高) are **restrained** (抑), the **low** (下) are **elevated** (举),
the **transformations** (化) are **answered** (应),
the **alterations** (变) are **responded to** (复).
This is the **principle of growth, transformation, maturation, contraction, and storage** (生长化成收藏),
the **constant of *qi*** (气之常).
When **constant** (常) is **lost** (失),
then the **heavens and earth become sealed** (四塞).
When **constant** (常) is **lost** (失), the **principle** (理) is:
the **four seasonal breaths** (四时之气) of the heavens and earth are **closed and sealed** (闭塞),
and **unable to circulate** (无所运行).
Thus, **movement** (动) has **stillness** (静),
**victory** (胜) has **response** (铃),*—*this is the **Dao/Way** (道) of the heavens and earth’s **yin and yang** (阴阳).
Hence it is said:
"The **movement and stillness** (动静) of the heavens and earth,
the **Divine Manifestations** (神明) govern their **cycles** (纪).
The **advance and retreat** (往复) of **yin and yang**,
**cold and heat** (寒暑) reveal their **portents** (兆)."
This is what is meant.

*(Newly corrected text states:)* The following lines are the same as in *The Grand Treatise on the Five Movements* (《五运行大论》).
The two preceding sentences also overlap with *The Grand Treatise on the Correspondences of Yin and Yang* (《阴阳应象大论》),
where it reads: "The **ascendance and descent** (升降) of **yin and yang**,
**cold and heat** (寒暑) reveal their **portents** (兆)."

The Emperor said: "Master’s words on the **variations of the Five *qi*** (五气) and the **responses of the Four Seasons** (四时),
can be said to be exhaustive.
The **turbulent movements** (动乱) of *qi*,
when **encountered** (触遇), **arise** (作) and **converge without due measure** (发无常会),
suddenly **disastrously coincide** (卒然灾合)—
how then can one **anticipate** (期) them?

Gebi said: "The **movements and variations** (动变) of *qi*
are indeed not **constantly present** (常在),
yet their **virtues, transformations, governance, decrees, alterations, and disasters** (德化政令灾变)
differ in their **occasions** (候).

The Emperor said: "What do you mean?"

Gebi said: "In the east, **wind** (风) is **born** (生),
wind **engenders** (生) **Wood** (木).
Its **virtue** (德) is **spread harmoniously** (敷和),
its **transformation** (化) is **to nourish** (生荣),
its **governance** (政) is **to unfurl and initiate** (舒启),
its **decree** (令) is **wind** (风),
its **alteration** (变) is **to shake and unleash** (振发),
its **disaster** (灾) is **scattering and falling** (散落)."
**敷** (敷) means **to spread** (布),
**和** (和) is the **harmonizing breath** (和气),
**荣** (荣) is **to nourish and flourish** (滋荣),
**舒** (舒) is **to extend** (展),
**启** (启) is **to open** (开),
**振** (振) is **to rage** (怒),
**发** (发) is **to emerge** (出),
**散** (散) is **to scatter and fall** (物飘零而散落).

*(Newly corrected text states:)* In *The Grand Treatise on the Five Movements* (《五运行大论》),
it reads: "Its **virtue** (德) is **harmony** (和),
its **transformation** (化) is **flourishing** (荣),
its **governance** (政) is **scattering** (散),
its **decree** (令) is **propagation and emergence** (宣发),
its **alteration** (变) is **to uproot and drag** (摧拉),
its **disaster** (灾) is **falling** (陨).
The meaning is consistent here.

In the south, **heat** (热) is **born** (生),
heat **engenders** (生) **Fire** (火).
Its **virtue** (德) is **radiance and display** (彰显),
its **transformation** (化) is **luxuriant and flourishing** (蕃茂),
its **governance** (政) is **bright and illuminating** (明曜),
its **decree** (令) is **heat** (热),
its **alteration** (变) is **to consume and scorch** (销烁),
its **disaster** (灾) is **conflagration and scorching** (燔).

*(Newly corrected text states:)* In *The Grand Treatise on the Five Movements* (《五运行大论》),
it reads: "Its **virtue** (德) is **display** (显),
its **transformation** (化) is **flourishing** (茂),
its **governance** (政) is **brightness** (明),
its **decree** (令) is **oppressive and steaming** (郁蒸),
its **alteration** (变) is **scorching heat** (炎烁),
its **disaster** (灾) is **conflagration and scorching** (燔)."

In the center, **moisture** (湿) is **born** (生),
moisture **engenders** (生) **Earth** (土).
Its **virtue** (德) is **damp and steaming** (溽蒸),
its **transformation** (化) is **abundant and complete** (丰备),
its **governance** (政) is **tranquil and still** (安静),
its **decree** (令) is **moisture** (湿),
its **alteration** (变) is **sudden downpour** (骤注),
its **disaster** (灾) is **prolonged rain and overflow** (霖溃).
**溽** (溽) means **moisture** (湿),
**蒸** (蒸) means **heat** (热),
**骤注** (骤注) is **sudden rain** (急雨),
**霖** (霖) is **prolonged rain** (久雨),
**溃** (溃) is **overflowing** (斓泥).

*(Newly corrected text states:)* In *The Grand Treatise on the Five Movements* (《五运行大论》),
it reads: "Its **virtue** (德) is **gentle and moist** (濡),
its **transformation** (化) is **fullness** (盈),
its **governance** (政) is **serene** (谧),
its **decree** (令) is **cloud and rain** (云雨),
its **alteration** (变) is **turbulent and sudden rain** (动注),
its **disaster** (灾) is **excessive and overflowing** (淫溃)."

The **West** (西方) generates **dryness** (燥), dryness generates **Metal** (金).
Its **virtue** (德) is **clear and pure** (清洁),
its **transformation** (化) is **tight and constricted** (紧敛),
its **governance** (政) is **sharp and urgent** (劲切),
its **decree** (令) is **dryness** (燥),
its **alteration** (变) is **austerity and withering** (肃杀),
its **disaster** (灾) is **blight and falling** (苍陨).

*"Tight"* (紧) means *constricted* (缩),
*"constricted"* (敛) means *collected* (收),
*"sharp"* (劲) means *acute* (锐),
*"urgent"* (切) means *hasty* (急),
*"dryness"* (燥) means *dry* (乾).
*"Austerity and withering"* (肃杀) refers to the wind stirring grasses and trees, making a sound like dryness.
When the **killing qi** (杀气) is excessive, trees turn blue and dry, then fall.

*(Newly corrected text states:)*
In *The Grand Treatise on the Five Movements* (《五运行大论》),
it reads: "Its **virtue** (德) is **clear** (清),

The **North** (北方) generates **cold** (寒), cold generates **Water** (水).
Its **virtue** (德) is **chilling and bleak** (凄沧),
its **transformation** (化) is **clear and serene** (清谧),
its **governance** (政) is **rigid and austere** (凝肃),
its **decree** (令) is **cold** (寒),
its **alteration** (变) is **freezing and piercing** (冻冽),
its **disaster** (灾) is **ice, snow, frost, and hail** (冰雪霜雹).

*"Chilling and bleak"* (凄沧) means *slight cold* (薄寒),
*"serene"* (谧) means *still* (静),
*"austere"* (肃) means *rigid order within and without* (中外严整).
*"Freezing and piercing"* (冻冽) means *extreme cold* (甚寒).
Ice, snow, frost, and hail are formed by the **congealing of cold qi** (寒气凝结), and when **water meets fire**, they appear out of season.

*(Newly corrected text states:)*
In *The Grand Treatise on the Five Movements* (《五运行大论》),
it reads: "Its **virtue** (德) is **cold** (寒),
its **transformation** (化) is **austerity** (肃),
its **governance** (政) is **still** (静),
its **alteration** (变) is **congealing and piercing** (凝冽),
its **disaster** (灾) is **ice and hail** (冰雹)."

Thus, observing its movements (动),
there is **virtue** (德) and **transformation** (化),
**governance** (政) and **decree** (令),
**alteration** (变) and **disaster** (灾),
and all things follow them,
while humans respond accordingly.

**Virtue, transformation, governance, and decree** (德化政令) are the **harmonious qi** (和气).
Their **dynamic and static dominance** (动静胜复) is applied to all things,
giving rise to all life and growth.
**Alteration and disaster** (变与灾) are the **killing qi** (杀气).
Their effects are **sudden and swift** (暴速),
their movements **abrupt and urgent** (骤急),
their course **harmful and injurious** (损伤).
Though they are the natural **dynamic and static operations of Heaven and Earth** (天地自为动静之用),
some things cannot withstand their movements,
and thus suffer damage, sickness, and death.

The Emperor said:
"Your words on the **yearly cycles** (岁候) do not exceed or fall short,
and they correspond above to the **Five Stars** (五星).
Now, **virtue, transformation, governance, and decree** (德化政令),
as well as **disasters, misfortunes, alterations, and changes** (灾眚变易),
are **unusual occurrences** (非常而有),
suddenly arising in motion—
do they also bring about alterations?"

Gebi (岐伯) replied:
"They follow Heaven’s course and act accordingly,
so there is no **unjust movement** (无妄动),
and nothing fails to respond.
When they move suddenly, it is the **interaction of the qi** (气之交变),
and they do not respond accordingly.
Thus it is said: *'Respond to the constant, not the sudden.'*
This is what is meant.

**Virtue, transformation, governance, and decree** (德化政令) are the **constant qi** (气之常).
**Disasters, misfortunes, alterations, and changes** (灾眚变易) arise when the **qi interact suddenly and overcome one another** (气卒交会而有胜负者).
The **constant** (常) refers to the **four seasons of the year**, whose qi do not deviate by even a moment.
The **unconstant** (不常) is **brief**.

The Emperor said:
"How should one respond to them?"

Gebi replied:
"Follow their **qi transformations** (气化).
The **Year Star’s** (岁星) transformation responds with **wind** (风).
The **Mars’** (荧惑) transformation responds with **heat** (热).
The **Jupiter’s** (镇星) transformation responds with **moisture** (湿).
The **Venus’** (太白) transformation responds with **dryness** (燥).
The **Saturn’s** (辰星) transformation responds with **cold** (寒).
When the **qi alter**, they respond accordingly—
thus, each follows its **qi transformation** (气化).

The earlier text spoke of **dominance and counteraction**, all corresponding above.
Now the *Classic* states: *'Respond to the constant, not the sudden.'*
This means there is **no major alteration without response**.
However, their **dominance and counteraction** should be observed in terms of **color changes**—
whether **withered, dry, moist, or lush**—
but **not by their size** in response.

The Emperor said:
"How do their **movements proceed in speed, slowness, reversal, or顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺

Without domination or aggression,
they abide in constancy, each moving within the **Dao**.

Thus, when a **solar term** overruns, the **luminaries** lose their hue and merge with their **mother**—
when **Wood** loses color, it merges with **Darkness** (玄);
when **Fire** loses color, it merges with **Azure** (苍);
when **Earth** loses color, it merges with **Red** (赤);
when **Metal** loses color, it merges with **Yellow** (黄);
when **Water** loses color, it merges with **White** (白)—
this is called **merging with their mother**.

When deficient, their color merges with what they **do not conquer**—
**Wood** merges with **White**,
**Fire** merges with **Darkness** (玄),
**Earth** merges with **Azure** (苍),
**Metal** merges with **Red**,
**Water** merges with **Yellow**—
this is called **merging with the unconquered**.

The **resemblances** are subtle, their mysteries profound.
The **ominous** and the **auspicious**—
which is truly good?
*The newly corrected text states*: The **resemblances** are most excellent, aligning with *The Secret Canon of the Soul’s Orchard* (《灵兰秘典论》), which has its own commentary.

To act recklessly without verification
is to display fear before the **sovereign and king**.
Not understanding **Heaven’s intent**,
they measure with private judgment,
speaking of calamities and misfortunes
that never manifest—
only to reveal the **omen of fear** to the **sovereign and king**
and **bewilder the common folk**.

The Emperor asked:
*"How do these calamities manifest?"*

**Gēbó** replied:
*"They follow their **qi transformations**—
thus, at their appointed times, there is **flourishing and decline**,
**transgressions** have **order or disorder**,
**retention and stagnation** vary in duration,
their **manifest forms** are **good or evil**,
their **constellational affiliations** bring **victory or defeat**,
and their **verifications** bring **auspice or misfortune**.*

When the **Five Stars** arrive,
their **sovereign** reigns in **flourishing**,
their **captivity or death** marks **decline**.

**Eastward transgression** is **orderly**, with **light calamity**.
**Westward transgression** is **disorderly**, with **grave calamity**.

**Retention** lasting many days brings **deep calamity**,
few days bring **shallow calamity**.

When a star **delights in moisture**, it is **auspicious**;
when it **rages in dryness and sorrow**, it is **malevolent**.

**Constellational affiliation** refers to the **monthly host** of the **Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions**,
and the **Twelve Earthly Branches**, divided by their **assigned positions**.

If the **commanding star** is **conquered**, there is **no calamity or harm**.
If it is **not conquered**, the calamity is **light or grave**.
If the **commanding star** aligns with the **luminaries**, though calamity arises, there is **no harm**.

**Calamity** refers to **litigation, illness, and misfortune**.

Even when the **Five Stars transgress**,
if they coincide with the **captivity or death** of the **luminaries** in that **month**,
though calamity looms, it **does not manifest**.

Yet—
when **Fire** transgresses in **retention and disorderly arrival**,
there is **fear of false accusations and litigation**.
When **Metal** transgresses,
there is **fear of executions and stagnant **qi****.
When **Wood** transgresses,
there is **fear of tremors and gusting winds**.
When **Earth** transgresses,
there is **fear of internal blockage, diarrhea, and edema**.
When **Water** transgresses,
there is **fear of cold **qi** striking the body**.

Thus, it is said: *"Their verifications bring **auspice or misfortune**."*

The Emperor asked:
*"What constitutes their **good or evil**?"*

**Gēbó** replied:
*"There is **joy and anger**, **sorrow and mourning**,
**moisture and dryness**—
these are the **constant omens**.
They must be **scrutinized with care**.*

When the **Five Stars** appear,
they are seen **deep into the night**.
If people **rejoice** upon seeing them, the stars **rejoice**.
If people **fear** them, the stars **rage**.

When their **light is faint and flickering**—
now bright, now dim—
the stars **mourn**.

When their **light is distant and indistinct**,
neither clear nor luminous,
unlike the others—
the stars **are in mourning**.

When their **light is round and clear**,
neither full nor diminished,
serene and luminous—
the stars **rejoice**.

When their **light blazes fiercely upon people**,
with **radiant halos overflowing**,
their **omen is stern**—
the stars **rage**.

**Moisture** is **abundant dampness**.
**Dryness** is **parched withering**.

The Emperor asked:
*"Do these **six omens** differ by **elevation**?"*

**Gēbó** replied:
*"Though the **omens** appear high or low,
their **verifications** are the same.
Thus, people also respond accordingly.*

Observing **omens and colors**,
the **internal and external verifications** of **human and Heaven**
are in harmony."

The Emperor said:
*"Excellent."*

*"How do the **virtue, transformations, governance, and orders** move—
their **stability, motion, depletion, or augmentation**?"*

**Gēbó** replied:
*"**Virtue and transformation**, **governance and calamity**—
these cannot **compound upon one another**.
**Heaven and Earth** move and rest,
**yin and yang** ebb and flow,
**virtue** answers **virtue**,
**transformation** answers **transformation**,
**governance and calamity** likewise—
thus, it is said they **cannot compound**.

**Victory and decline** cannot **exceed their measure**.
When **victory is strong**, it **remains strong**;
when **victory is weak**, it **remains weak**—
**flourishing does not answer decline**,
**transformation does not answer change**—
thus, it is said they **cannot exceed**.

**Coming and going**, **great and small**—
they **cannot surpass**.
The **days of victory and response**,
whether **many or few**, are **equal**—
thus, it is said they **cannot surpass**.

Their **application in ascent and descent**—
they **cannot be absent**.
**Wood’s conquest** is answered by **Metal’s submission**,
**Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water** likewise—
there has never been **conquest without response**—
thus, **qi cannot make one another absent**.

Each follows its **movement and response**.
**Movement** has its **response**—
**response** is discerned through **movement**.
*The Classic of Changes* says:
*'Auspice, misfortune, regret, and caution arise from **movement**.'*
This is what is meant.

Though **Heaven is high** and **unfathomable**,
though **Earth is vast** and **unmeasurable**—
speaking of **qi’s movement and response**,
it is as **easily observed as the palm of one’s hand**."

The Emperor said:
*"How do these **diseases** arise?"*

**Gēbó** replied:
*"**Virtue and transformation** are the **auspicious signs of qi**,
**governance and orders** are the **manifestations of qi**,
**change and response** are the **frameworks of return**,
**calamity** is the **beginning of injury**.

When **qi** conquers in **harmony**, there is **health**;
when it **does not conquer**, there is **disease**;
when **evil influences** strike repeatedly, the **illness is severe**."

**Auspicious**—**favorable response**.
**Manifestation**—**measure, standard**.
**Framework of return**—the **principles of response**.
**Repeatedly struck**—when **annual qi** is already **deficient**,
and **Heaven’s qi** brings **conquering and killing**—
this is called **repeatedly struck**.
**Repeated**—**layered accumulation**.

The Emperor said:
*"Excellent."*

The discussion of **精光** (refined luminosity) is the work of the **Great Sage** (Great Sage’s endeavor),
to proclaim the **Great Dao/Way** (Great Dao),
to penetrate the **limitless** (without end),
and to fathom the **ultimate** (without extreme).

I have heard that:
those who speak well of **Heaven** (Heaven) must correspond with **humanity** (humanity),
those who speak well of **ancient times** (the ancient) must be verified in **the present** (today),
those who speak well of **qi** (qi) must be evident in **all things** (phenomena),
those who speak well of **response** (response) align with the **transformations of Heaven and Earth** (Heaven and Earth’s changes),
and those who speak well of **transformation and response** (change and response)
penetrate the **principles of the divine and luminous** (divine and luminous logic).

Who else could articulate the **Dao/Way of the utmost** (ultimate Dao) but the **Master** (Master)?

Excess or deficiency—
the **annual transformations** (yearly changes) are endless,
the **interactions of qi** (qi’s exchanges) shift and transform,
flowing into the **ultimate** (without extreme).

Yet **Heaven displays its signs** (Heaven’s symbols descend),
and the **Sage observes them** (Sages follow them)
to discern **auspicious and inauspicious** (fortune and calamity).

How so?
When the **annual qi** (yearly qi) is excessive,
the **stars** (celestial bodies) become **prominent or bright and clear** (greatly luminous or translucent),
and when the **annual qi** (yearly qi) is deficient,
the **stars** (celestial bodies) grow **dim or lose their color** (small or colorless).
Thus, **auspicious and inauspicious** (fortune and calamity) can be **indicated and seen** (pointed out and observed).

What does **auspicious and inauspicious** (fortune and calamity) refer to?
It is because **all things** (phenomena) receive the **five constant qi** (Five Constant Qi)
to grow and form,
and they all **respond above** (ascend to correspond),
either **favorable** (affirmative) or **unfavorable** (negative).
Hence, it is said: **auspicious and inauspicious are thus supremely evident** (fortune and calamity are truly profound).

Therefore, it is said:
those who speak well of **Heaven** (Heaven) must also correspond with **humanity** (humanity).
The **Dao/Way of antiquity** (ancient Dao) is spoken,
and **the present** (today) **verifies it** (responds to it).
Thus, it is said:
those who speak well of **ancient times** (the ancient) must also be verified in **the present** (today).

The **transformative qi** (transformative qi) generates and forms—
all **things** (phenomena) receive it.
Thus, when speaking of **qi’s response** (qi’s response),
the **Sage clarifies it through phenomena** (evidence from things).
Hence, it is said:
those who speak well of **response** (response) must also be evident in **all things** (phenomena).

**Evident**—**clear** (manifestation, clear).
The **response of transformative qi** (qi’s transformative response)
is like the **four seasons** (Four Seasons) in their regular course,
all **things** (phenomena) fully manifest.
Thus, those who speak well of **response** (response)
must also **align with Heaven and Earth’s creation and transformation** (conform to Heaven and Earth’s changes).

When **things** (phenomena) **emerge**, it is called **transformation** (change),
and when **things** (phenomena) **reach their limits**, it is called **response** (variation).
To speak of **all things’ transformations and responses** (change and response)
from beginning to end
is to **harmonize with the divine and luminous operations** (conform to the divine and luminous logic).
Thus, those who speak well of **transformation and response** (change and response)
penetrate the **principles of the divine and luminous** (divine and luminous logic).

The **Sage’s wisdom** (Sage’s knowledge) encompasses all **things** (phenomena),
omitting nothing.
Thus, when speaking of **auspicious signs** (auspicious signs),
even the slightest **movement** (stirring) **responds without fail** (does not go unanswered).

Then, the **Sage selects the finest auspices** (good omens)
and **stores them in the sacred chamber** (sacred chamber),
reading them each morning,
and names it **"Qi’s Transformations"** (Qi’s Exchanges and Changes).
He **does not dare reveal them** (open them) without **fasting and purification** (ritual abstinence),
and **transmits them with great care** (cautious transmission).

**Sacred chamber**—the **Hall of Auspicious Orchids** (Hall of Auspicious Orchids),
the **repository of Yellow Emperor’s writings** (Yellow Emperor’s library).

**Five Constant Principles on Grand Governance (Upper Section)**
*Newly Revised Annotation:* This chapter comprehensively discusses the Five Phases (Wǔ Rùn), distinguishing between balanced *qi*, deficiency, and excess. It then addresses geographical variations—four directions, elevation, and yin-yang contrasts. It further explains how some years may lack disease despite imbalanced organ-*qi*, attributing this to the Heavenly *qi*’s dominance and its directional influences. The text then elaborates on the Six *Qi* and Five Categories’ mutual regulation and victory, explaining why some years yield no conception despite favorable conditions. Finally, it clarifies the Six *Qi*’s seasonal transformations, the varying thickness of the Five Flavors, and concludes with therapeutic principles.

This chapter’s title, *Five Constant Principles on Grand Governance*, emphasizes its foundational themes.

**The Yellow Emperor asked:**
“The Great Void is vast and boundless. The Five Phases revolve and intermingle, waxing and waning in cycles, their excesses and deficiencies following one another. I wish to understand: What constitutes balanced *qi* in name and in its governing principle?”

**Qī Bó replied:**
“Your question is luminous! When the Wood Phase is *fūhé* (enveloping harmony), its *hé* (harmonious) *qi* spreads, and all things flourish in vitality. When the Fire Phase is *shēngmíng* (ascending luminosity), its radiant *qi* ascends, illuminating all. When the Earth Phase is *bèihuà* (comprehensive transformation), its pervasive transformative *qi* nourishes all, yet slightly diminishes their vitality. When the Metal Phase is *shěnpíng* (precise equilibrium), its crisp *qi* settles, bringing stability. When the Water Phase is *jìngshùn* (tranquil compliance), its clear essence flows in accordance with all things.”

**The Emperor asked:**
“What of deficiency?”

**Qī Bó replied:**
“When Wood is *wěihé* (submissive harmony), its yang-harmonious *qi* is constrained and underutilized. When Fire is *fúmíng* (concealed luminosity), its radiant *qi* is suppressed and does not manifest. When Earth is *bēijiān* (humble oversight), though meager, it still oversees all things’ transformations. When Metal is *cónggé* (compliant revolution), it follows and adapts, solidifying all things. When Water is *hèliú* (dry flow), its scarcity causes its currents to wither.”

**The Emperor asked:**
“What constitutes excess?”

**Qī Bó replied:**
“When Wood is *fāshēng* (proliferating vitality), its expansive *qi* causes all things to flourish. When Fire is *hèxī* (flaming radiance), its brilliance is extreme. When Earth is *dūnfù* (thick and elevated), *dūn* meaning ‘thick,’ *fù* meaning ‘high,’ its surplus *qi* makes it both lofty and dense. When Metal is *jiānchéng* (firm completion), its crisp *qi* and strong winds solidify all things. When Water is *liúyǎn* (overflowing), *yǎn* meaning ‘accompanying’ or ‘spilling,’ its excess floods.”

**The Emperor asked:**
“I wish to hear the governing principles of these three *qi* states.”

**Qī Bó replied:**
“Your inquiry is exhaustive! *Newly Revised Annotation:* This discussion aligns with *The Grand Theory of the Five Phases’ Movement*, *The Great Correspondence of Yin-Yang*, and *The Golden Chamber’s True Statements*.

When Wood is *fūhé* (enveloping harmony), its governance follows the Wood Phase’s complete cycle: yang expands, yin disperses, and the Five Transformations unfold evenly. Each *qi* governs its designated region without conflict, so the Five *qi*’s transformations issue their decrees across the four directions without intrusion.

*Newly Revised Annotation:* According to Wang Bing’s notes, excess and deficiency each correspond to specific years and branches. This section describes a balanced Wood Phase, omitting year/branch markers because balanced-*qi* years cannot be fixed by such cycles. Some might argue to add, e.g., *Ding-sì*, *Ding-hài*, *Rén-yín*, or *Rén-shēn* years, but this reflects misunderstanding.

Its essence is *duān* (straightforward, adorned), its nature *suí* (compliant), its application both *qū* (curved) and *zhí* (straight), accommodating all uses. Its transformation fosters *shēngróng* (vital flourishing), as Wood’s expansive *qi* makes all things lush and beautiful. Its category includes grasses and trees—Wood’s body is firm and towering, while grasses are lowly, yet each exhibits variations in rigidity, flexibility, and structure. Its governance is *fāsàn* (dispersive), as spring’s expansive *qi* nurtures all things into growth, embodying Wood’s transformation. Its season is *wēnhé* (temperate harmony), *hé* being spring’s *qi*. Its decree is *fēng* (wind), as Wood’s governance manifests in gentle breezes. Its organ is the liver, its *qi* aligning with hepatic energy. The liver fears *qīng* (clearing), for Wood’s nature is *xuān* (warm), and it thus dreads Metal’s crispness. As *The Grand Theory of the Five Phases’ Movement* states: ‘Wood’s nature is *xuān*.’ It further notes: ‘Dryness overcomes wind.’ Its sense is the eyes, as yang’s ascent and clarity align with vision. Its grain is *má* (hemp), its hue *cāng* (sage-green). *Newly Revised Annotation:* *The Golden Chamber’s True Statements* lists *mài* (wheat) instead.

Its fruit is the *lǐ* (plum), its flavor *suān* (sour), its seed containing a hard pit. Its correspondence is spring, as all four seasons share its transformative essence. Its creatures are *máo* (hairy insects), as Wood’s expansive *qi* nurtures their growth. Its livestock are *quǎn* (dogs), thriving without restraint like grasses and trees. *Newly Revised Annotation:* *The Golden Chamber’s True Statements* specifies *yào* (hawks) instead.

Its color is *cāng* (sage-green), as Wood’s transformation makes all things verdant. It nourishes *jīn* (tendons), for sour flavors enter the tendons. Its diseases manifest as *guǒjí zhī mǎn* (twisted, tense limbs and fullness), born of Wood’s *qi*. *Newly Revised Annotation:* *The Golden Chamber’s True Statements* clarifies: ‘Thus, one knows disease resides in the tendons.’

Its flavor is *suān* (sour), as Wood’s *fūhé* transformation thickens sourness in all things. Its tone is *jiǎo* (the 6th musical note), straight and resonant. Its forms are *zhōngjiān* (moderately firm), symbolizing Wood’s presence within Earth. Its numerical correspondence is *bā* (eight), the completed cycle.

The **Rise of Clarity’s** chronicle,
governs by the **True Sun** and **rules**,
with **virtue/power** bestowed universally—**equal** and **balanced**.
*Equal*: uniformity.
*Balanced*: equilibrium.

Its **qi** is **high**,
as **Fire** blazes upward.

Its **nature** is **rapid**,
for **Fire’s** disposition is **restless** and **swift**.
*Restless*: impulsive.
*Swift*: hasty.

Its **function** is **to scorch and burn**,
*Burn*: to sear.
*Scorch* and *burn* both belong to **Fire’s** function.

Its **transformation** is **luxuriant and flourishing**,
with **vitality** and **growth** abundant—
thus things become **great**.

Its **category** aligns with **Fire**,
for among the **Five Phases’ qi**,
it shares the same essence as **Fire**.

Its **administration** is **illuminating and radiant**,
as **virtue/power** harmonizes with **high clarity**—
the **rule** of **Fire**.

Its **seasonal sign** is **scorching heat**,
the **qi’s** arrival—
and thus it is discerned.

Its **command** is **heat**,
for when **heat** reaches its peak,
the **command** takes effect.

Its **residence** is the **Heart**,
as the **Heart’s qi** responds.
The **Heart** fears **cold**,
*Cold*: the **command** of **Water**.
The **Heart’s** disposition is **summer-heat** and **warmth**—
thus it fears **cold**.
*The Five Phases’ Grand Theory* states:
*The **Heart’s** disposition is **summer-heat***.
It further states:
*When **cold** overcomes **heat***.

Its **organ** is the **tongue**,
for **Fire** illuminates the **hidden**—
the **tongue** clarifies.

Its **grain** is **wheat**,
*Wheat*: its hue is **red**.
*Newly Revised Annotation*: *The Golden Chamber’s True Statements* specifies **millet** instead.
*Again, The Residence of Qi’s Seasonal Theory* states: **wheat**.

Its **fruit** is **black nightshade**,
*Black nightshade*: its flavor is **bitter**.

Its **seeds** are **networked**,
*Networked*: those with **vessel-like tendrils** within.

Its **season** is **Summer**,
for the **Four Seasons’ qi** aligns with **Summer’s qi**.

Its **insect** is **feathered**,
*Feathered*: the **symbol** of **Fire**.
As **Fire’s** transformation spreads,
**feathered insects** are born.

Its **beast** is the **horse**,
*Healthy, central, restless, and swift*—
its **category** aligns with **Fire**.
*Newly Revised Annotation*: *The Golden Chamber’s True Statements* specifies **sheep** instead.

Its **color** is **red**,
*Red*: hue matching and **bright**.

Its **nourishment** is **blood**,
its **ailment** is **nevus** or **moles**,
*Fire’s* nature is **dynamic**—hence the disease.
*Newly Revised Annotation*: *Thus one knows that the disease lies within the **pig**.*

Its **flavor** is **bitter**,
*As **Fire’s** ascending **qi** transforms and clarifies,*
then **things** bear **pure bitter tastes**.

Its **sound** is **sheng** (as in *yún* 允),
*resonant and harmonious—beautiful in accord.*

Its **form** is **veins**,
*within, many **vessel-like tendrils** abound—*
this is **Fire’s** transformation.

Its **number** is **seven**,
*the **perfected number**.*

In full measure of its transformations,
**qi** aligns with **Heaven’s** seasonal cycles,
**virtue/power** flows through the **Four Seasons’ governance**,
*the Five Transformations* are **fully realized**.
*Earth’s* **virtue/power** is **static**,
supporting the **Four Directions**,
*augmenting the governance of Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire*.
*Earth’s* **qi** is **thick**,
responding to **Heaven’s** harmonious seasonal cycles,
to **generate, flourish, harvest, and store**,
*completing the cycle and returning anew*—
thus the **Five Transformations** are **fully realized**.

Its **qi** is **balanced**,
*Earth’s* **nature** is **level and upright**.

Its **nature** is **yielding**,
*responding to all things in order,*
transforming them **fully and smoothly**.

Its **application** is **high and low**,
*the world’s **Earth**—both high and low—*
all **respond to its use**.

Its **transformation** is **abundant and full**,
*abundant and full for all things—*
none but **Earth’s** transformation can achieve this.

Its **category** is **Earth**,
*the Five Phases’ transformations—*
**Earth’s** category is the same.

Its **governance** is **tranquility and stability**,
*Earth’s substance is thick,*
**Earth’s virtue/power** is **static**—
thus its **governance** and **transformation** are likewise.

Its **seasonal sign** is **steamy heat**,
*Steamy*: **dampness**.
*Heat*: **warmth**.

Its **season** is **Dampness**,
*As **Dampness’** transformation never ceases,*
then **Earth’s** season is **prolonged**.
*Long Summer*: the **Summer of Nurturing**,
*the sixth month’s **qi** aligns with it*.
*Newly Revised Annotation*: *According to Wang’s annotation in The Residence of Qi’s Seasonal Theory, **Summer** is the **mother of Earth**; Earth flourishes in the **center**, and by its **growth** it governs, hence **Long Summer**. Again, in his annotation of The Six Divisions and Residence of Symbols, **Long Summer** refers to the sixth month. Earth is **born from Fire**, grows in **Summer**, and having grown, **reigns**—thus it is called **Long Summer**.*

Its **insect** is **□** (blank),
*without hair, feathers, scales, or carapace—*
**Earth’s** form is the same.

Its **beast** is the **cow**,
*completing the **cultivation of grains**—*
this is **Earth’s** use.
*The cow’s **application** is **slow and gentle**.*

Its **color** is **yellow**,
*matching **Earth**.*

Its **nourishment** is **flesh**,
*what it nourishes is **thick and static**.*

Its **disease** is **obstruction**,
*Earth’s nature is **retaining and blocking**.*

The newly corrected text states: According to *The Golden Cabinet True Speech Discourse*, when disease is at the root of the tongue, it is known that the disease lies in the **flesh**.

Its **flavor** is **sweet**,
*abundant in **transformative qi**, thus things are sweet and rich.*

Its **sound** is **gong**,
*great and heavy.*

Its **creature** is **skin**,
*things receiving abundant **transformative qi** then have much **flesh and muscle**.*

Its **number** is **five**—
*the **generative number**, for **Earth’s rectitude** does not add in vain.*

Examining the **leveling principle**,
*it **withdraws without contention**, **slays without transgression**—*
*Five transformations are clearly manifest.*
*Transgression refers to **punishment** against things.*

*Withdrawing without contention, slaying without transgression—*
*if not the **virtue of leveling**, how could this be achieved?*

Its **qi** is **pure**,
*For **Metal’s qi** is defined by its **clear, white, and luminous** nature.*

Its **nature** is **rigid**,
*Rigid in nature, thus it **shatters and breaks** things.*

Its **use** is **scattering and falling**,
*Metal’s function causes all things to **scatter and fall**.*

Its **transformation** is **firm and contracting**,
*Contracting and strengthening—this is Metal’s transformation.*

Its **kind** is **Metal**,
*The transformation of leveling aligns with Metal’s kind.*

Its **governance** is **stern and austere**,
*Swift and orderly transformations.*
*Stern refers to **sharpness**.*

Its **omen** is **clear and urgent**,
*Clear refers to **great cold**.*
*Urgent refers to **haste** and **wind sound**.*

Its **seasonal command** is **dryness**,
*Dryness refers to **dryness**.*

Its **storage** is the **lung**,
*The lung’s function aligns with Metal’s transformation.*
*The lung fears heat,*
*Heat is the **Fire** command.*
*The lung’s nature is cold, thus it fears **fire and heat**.*
*The Great Treatise on the Five Movements* states: *The lung’s nature is cold.*

Its **mastery** is the **nose**,
*The lung stores **qi**, the nose conducts **breath**.*

Its **grain** is **rice**,
*White in color.*
*The newly corrected text states: According to *The Golden Cabinet True Speech Discourse*, it is rice; according to *The Treatise on Storing Qi According to Season*, it is **yellow millet**.*

Its **fruit** is the **peach**,
*Its flavor is **pungent**.*

Its **seed** is **shelled**,
*Things with a **hard outer shell**.*

Its **season** is **Autumn**,
*The transformations of the four seasons align with **Autumn qi**.*

Its **insect** is the **shellfish**,
*Things with a **hard carapace**.*

Its **livestock** is the **chicken**,
*Its nature is to **fight and injure**, mirroring Metal’s use.*
*The newly corrected text states: According to *The Golden Cabinet True Speech Discourse*, its livestock is the **horse**.*

Its **color** is **white**,
*Color aligns.*

Its **nourishment** is **skin and fur**,
*Firmness aligns.*

Its **disease** is **coughing**,
*A **voiced disease**, Metal’s response.*
*The newly corrected text states: According to *The Golden Cabinet True Speech Discourse*, disease is in the **back**, thus it is known that the disease lies in **skin and fur**.*

Its **flavor** is **pungent**,
*When the **leveling transformation** is rectified, then **pungent flavors** are proper.*

Its **sound** is *Shang* (the fifth musical note),
*In harmony, it rises with benefit.*

Its **things** are externally firm,
*When **Metal’s transformation** spreads and circulates, then things take on external firmness.*
Its **number** is **nine**,
*The number of completion.*

Its **order** is one of stillness and submission,
*To conceal without harm, to govern with smooth descent—when the **Five Transformations** are all rectified,*
*Governance is the **transformation** itself.*
Water’s **nature** is to descend,
*Thus its **virtue/power** is complete.*
Rivers and seas, why they can reign as sovereigns of all streams,
*Is because they excel in descending.*

Its **qi** is **clarity**,
*Cold and pure, its radiance—Water’s **qi** in origin.*
Its **character** is to descend,
*Flowing back to the lower realms.*

Its **function** is to **moisten and overflow**,
*Its essence is not cold, so **dew** arises and spills forth.*
**Moisten** is **dew**;
**Overflow** is **spill**.

Its **transformation** is **congealing firmness**,
*When **qi** is concealed and **transformations** spread, then Water’s things congeal and harden.*
Its **kind** is Water,
*Cold and yielding **transformations** align with Water’s nature.*

Its **rule** is **fluid diffusion**,
*Wells and springs never exhaust, rivers never cease—thus the meaning of **fluid diffusion**.*

Its **seasonal sign** is **congealing austerity**,
*Congealing is **cold**; austerity is **stillness**.*
The **qi** of **cold’s arrival** marks the seasonal sign.

Its **command** is **cold**,
*When Water’s **transformation** spreads, then **cold** governs all things.*

Its **residence** is the **kidney**,
*The kidney’s function of storage aligns with Water’s **transformation**.*
The kidney **fears dampness**,
*Dampness is **Earth’s qi**.*
The kidney’s nature is **austere**,
*Thus it fears **Earth’s dampness**.*
*The **Grand Treatise on the Five Movements** states:*
The kidney, its nature is **austere**.

Its **domain** is the **two yin** (penis and vagina),
*Flow and distribution correspond accordingly.*
*The newly corrected text states:*
According to *The Golden Cabinet True Speech Discourse*, the **North**’s black **color** enters and communicates with the **kidney**, opening at the **two yin orifices**.

Its **grain** is **beans**,
*For their black **color**.*
*The newly corrected text states:*
According to *The Golden Cabinet True Speech Discourse* and *The Treatise on Residence Qi and Seasonal Laws*, it is the same.

Its **fruit** is **chestnut**,
*For its **salty flavor**.*
Its **kernel** is **juicy**,
*Within it lies **essence-fluid**.*

Its **season** is **Winter**,
*The **transformations** of the four seasons—Winter’s **qi** aligns.*

Its **insect** is **scaly**,
*Scaly, born from Water’s **transformation**.*

Its **livestock** is the **wild boar**,
*It excels in descending.*
*[Note: "竞" (竞) is a variant of "豕" (shǐ), meaning wild boar.]*

Its **nourishment** is **bone marrow**,
*For **qi** enters and sustains it.*

Its **disease** is **syncope**,
*Syncope, **qi** in reverse—ascending against its natural course, moving contrary and unordered.*
*For the newly corrected text states: According to *The Golden Cabinet True Speech Discourse*, the disease lies in the **crevice** (溪), hence knowing the disease resides in the **bone**.*

Its **flavor** is **salty**,
*For its flavor aligns.*

Its **sound** is **the fifth tone** (羽),
*Deep yet harmonious.*

Its **phenomenon** is **moisture**,
*Water’s **transformation** is abundant and widespread, nourishing all things.*

Its **number** is **six**,
*This is the **completion number**.*
*Thus, one should not kill when it thrives, nor punish when it grows,
nor suppress when it transforms, nor harm when it recedes,
nor restrain when it stores—this is called **balanced qi**.*

**Qi of growth** governs the year,
*Yet **qi of receding** cannot let **qi of killing** run wild.*
**Qi of lengthening** governs the year,
*Yet **qi of storing** cannot let **qi of punishment** run wild.*
**Qi of transformation** governs the year,
*Yet **qi of growth** cannot let **qi of suppression** run wild.*
**Qi of receding** governs the year,
*Yet **qi of lengthening** cannot let **qi of harm** run wild.*
**Qi of storing** governs the year,
*Yet **qi of transformation** cannot let **qi of restraint** run wild.*

*If such is the case,*
*All are **Heavenly qi** balanced and **Earthly qi** upright,*
*The **qi of the Five Transformations** does not employ **victory over defeat** as its principle,*
*Hence it is called **balanced and harmonious qi**.*

*According to the **Commissioned and Harmonious** records,*
*This is called **victory over growth**.*
*In the years of **Dingmao (丁卯)**, **Dingchou (丁丑)**, **Dinghai (丁亥)**, **Dingwei (丁未)**, **Dingyou (丁酉)**, and **Dingsi (丁巳)**,*
*When **qi of growth** does not govern,*
*Then **qi of transformation** ascends unchecked,*
*For **wood** is scarce,*
*Hence **qi of growth** does not govern.*
*When **earth** is broad,*
*Hence **qi of transformation** ascends unchecked.*

*Yet **qi of lengthening** remains balanced,*
*And **qi of receding** arrives early,*
*For **fire** faces no obstruction,*
*Hence **qi of lengthening** remains balanced.*
*When **wood qi** is diminished,*
*Hence **qi of receding** arrives early.*

*Cool rains descend in due time,*
*Winds and clouds appear together,*
*Cool, **metal’s transformation**.*
*Fish, **moisture’s transformation**.*
*Wind, **wood’s transformation**.*
*Clouds, **moisture’s transformation**.*

*Grasses and trees flourish late,*
*Yet wither and fall early,*
*For **metal qi** prevails,*
*And **wood** cannot ascend triumphantly.*
*The newly corrected text states: Examining the **Commissioned and Harmonious** records,*
*When **wood** does not reach its fullness,*
*And **metal qi** overpowers it,*
*Hence the withering and falling early.*
*It is not that **metal qi** has excess,*
*Nor that **wood** cannot prevail—*
*Rather, **wood** is insufficient,*
*And **metal** overpowers it.*

*Things bloom in splendor yet bear fruit,*
*Their bark and flesh grow full within,*
*Though the year of growth is late,*
*The harvest is full and ripe,*
*For **earth’s transformation qi** is swift,*
*Hence such is the case.*

Its **qi** is **converged**,
*Converged, as it also aligns with **metal qi**.*

Its **function** is **gathering**,
*Not dispersing.*

Its **movement** is **refined, abrupt, constrained, and sluggish**,
*Refined (练), shortened.*
*Abrupt (戾), fully concluded.*
*Constrained (拘), tense and urgent.*
*Sluggish (缓), not receding.*

Its **outbreak** is **startling and fearful**,
*For **wood** bends and suddenly stretches—*
*The **symbol** of startling and fearful.*

Its **storage** is in the **liver**,
*Internally corresponding with the **liver**.*

Its fruits are jujubes and plums—
*Jujubes, of earth.*
*Plums, fruits of wood.*

*[New annotation:] The text specifies: "Plums, fruits of wood."*
*By comparison, fruits not governed by fire, earth, metal, or water—plums should read "peaches." Wang’s annotation is also incorrect.*

Their kernels and shells—
*Kernels, of wood.*
*Shells, ruled by metal.*

Its grains are millet and rice—
*Grains of metal and earth.*

Its flavors are sour and spicy—
*Sour things, when ripe, also carry spiciness.*

Its colors are white and ashen—
*Ashen hues, when ripe, also turn white.*

Its livestock are dogs and chickens—
*Wood follows metal in domestication.*

Its insects are furred and shelled—
*Furred creatures follow the shelled.*

Its dominion is over mist, dew, chill, and bleakness—
*The transformations of metal.*

Its sounds are *jue* and *shang*—
*Jue follows shang.*

Its illnesses are trembling, agitation, dizziness, and terror—
*Wood harmed by malevolent qi.*
*Transformed by metal’s influence.*
*Wood cannot govern itself, so its transformation follows metal.*

*Minor jue* and *half-shang* are the same—
*Minor jue, where wood is insufficient, thus half aligns with shang’s metal transformation.*
*Half, meaning partial.*

*[New annotation:] The text should read: "By fire, earth, metal, and water’s accounts, *minor jue* and *minor shang* are the same." It does not say *minor shang* because the *minor jue* cycle spans six years, where:*
*In *ding-si* and *ding-hai* years, upper *jue* aligns with true *jue*—*
*Upper *jue* meets *jue-yin*, matching the *fu-he* year’s transformation.*
*That is, in *ding-hai* and *ding-si* years, what the upper governs is seen.*
*Upper *shang* aligns with true *shang*—*
*Upper meets *yang-ming*, matching the *ping-jin* year’s transformation.*
*In *ding-mao* and *ding-you* years, upper meets *yang-ming*.*

Its illnesses branch into convulsions, paralysis, swelling, and sores—
*Metal restrains wood.*

Its sweet pests—
*Offspring within the mother.*
*Malevolent harm to the liver.*

Though its transformations all align with metal,
*Yet what it harms returns to the liver’s wood.*

Upper *gong* aligns with true *gong*—
*Earth covers its wood, equal to what has not yet emerged.*
*Wood not yet emerged from earth is like having no wood.*
*Earth governs itself, so it matches the true earth-year’s transformation.*

Upper meets *Tai-yin*—
*Called upper *gong*.*
*In *ding-chou* and *ding-wei* years, upper meets *Tai-yin*, the celestial governor’s transformation.*

*Xiao-yang*, *su-kill*—
*Metal lacks virtue.*
*Flame, fervor, and boiling—*
*The fire’s resurgence.*

*[Note: *Yang* pronounced as *se*.]*

Green at three—
Fire returns as wood, so its warning lies in *shu* [束].
Three, the *shu* direction.
This speaks of metal’s victorious things.

*Newly corrected annotation reads:*
According to the *Six Elements’ True Chronology*, disasters strike the Three Officials—
This is called *fu* [復].
*Fu* means retaliation.
Its mastered pests: flying moths, grubs, and partridges—
Flying, feathered insects.
Grubs, born within, worms from flies—
These transform within things themselves.
Partridges, the crow’s prey.
They become thunderous strikes.
Thunder, great sound born in the void’s twilight.
Thunderclap, swift lightning—
Sudden as fire’s explosion, the very *pìlì* [霹靂].

The hidden *jì* [紀] is called *shèng-cháng* [勝長].
Hidden *qi* prevails—
The years *guǐ-yǒu* [癸酉], *guǐ-wèi* [癸未], *guǐ-sì* [癸巳], *guǐ-mǎo* [癸卯], *guǐ-chǒu* [癸丑], *guǐ-hài* [癸亥].
Long *qi* stagnates, hidden *qi* spreads—
Fire’s long *qi* cannot govern transformations,
So water’s hidden *qi* spreads in season.
Retreating *qi* takes charge, transformations balance—
Metal and earth’s principles
Unrelated to the year’s *qi*,
So metal governs itself, earth balances its *qi*.

Chill and clarity prevail,
Summer’s mandate thins—
Fire’s *qi* unused.
Things born of transformation grow,
Yet do not thrive—
Fire’s mandate does not rule,
So transformed things born
Fail to grow.
Fruits ripen while young,
Encountering *qi* already aged—
Things ripen and mature,
Yet shoots remain stunted;
When *qi* arrives, growth unfulfilled,
And *qi* is already old.

Yang *qi* bends low, *diàn-chóng* [垫虫] hide early—
Yang unused, yin prevails.
If above meets *guǐ-mǎo* [癸卯] or *guǐ-yǒu* [癸酉] years,
Then *diàn* does not hide.
*Newly corrected annotation reads:*
Examine *guǐ-sì* [癸巳] and *guǐ-hài* [癸亥] years—
*Diàn* also does not hide.
Its *qi* is stifled,
Stagnant and oppressive, unrelenting.

Its use is **violent**—**rapid** in nature.
Its movements are **manifest** and **concealed**, ever **transforming and shifting**.
*Manifest* means **clear**; *concealed* means **hidden**.
*Transforming and shifting* refers to its **unfixed appearances**.

When it **flares**, it causes **pain**—pain arising from the **heart**.
When it **retires**, the **year’s *qi*** flows into the heart.

Its **fruits** are **chestnuts and peaches**—
Chestnuts, a **water** fruit;
Peaches, a **metal** fruit.
Their **seeds** are **veined and juicy**—
*Veined* refers to **branching vessels**; *juicy* means **moist**.

Its **grains** are **beans and rice**—
Beans, a **water** grain;
Rice, a **metal** grain.
Its **flavor** is **bitter and salty**—
A **bitter-salty** combination.

Its **color** is **black and red**—
Reddish things, when ripe, are **both blackened and reddened**.

Its **livestock** are **horses and greedy beasts**—
Fire **follows water** in livestock.
Its **creatures** are **feathered and scaly**—
Feathers **follow scales**.

Its **rulers** are **ice, snow, frost, and cold**—
The *qi* of **water**.

Its **sounds** are **sharp and descending**—
Sharp **follows descending**.

Its **diseases** are **confusion, bewilderment, sorrow, and forgetfulness**—
Fire’s **restless agitation**, ungoverned by fixed laws,
Yin **overshadowing** yang-fire, hence **confusion and bewilderment** go untreated.
Heart *qi* is **deficient**, hence **prone to sorrow and forgetfulness**.
This follows **water’s transformation**.
Fire is weak, water strong—
Thus, the **half-rule of manifest clarity** follows water’s governance.

*[Note:]* **Minor Sharp** and **Minor Descending** are the same.
Fire is weak, so half follows **#8 water’s** transformation.
*Newly corrected annotation reads:*
Examine **Minor Sharp** over six years:
*Guǐ-yǒu* [癸酉], *guǐ-mǎo* [癸卯], aligned with **Major Sharp**,
*Guǐ-sì* [癸巳], *guǐ-hài* [癸亥], aligned with **extraordinary years**,
*Guǐ-wèi* [癸未], *guǐ-chǒu* [癸丑]—
For two years, **Minor Sharp** and **Minor Descending** coincide,
Hence it does not say *"judge Descending"* separately.
**Major Sharp** and **Regular Sharp** are the same.

When the year’s **upper stem** meets **Yang-Ming**,
Its transformation aligns with **level-metal years**.
*Guǐ-mǎo* [癸卯] and *guǐ-yǒu* [癸酉]—
The year’s **upper stem** meets **Yang-Ming**.
*Newly corrected annotation reads:*
This does not mention **upper Official** or **upper Horn**,
For **Official** and **Horn** do not **greatly harm or attack** Fire,
Hence the *Classic* omits them.

**Evil injures the heart.**
Those afflicted suffer **heart disease**.

When **qi** congeals in cold and chill,
Violent rain and lingering showers ensue—
This is **water’s** lack of **virtue**.
Violent rain and lingering showers—
The **return** of **earth**.

It is announced to the **Seven Officials**.
The **Seven Officials**—#9 the **South** also.

*Newly corrected annotation reads:*
According to the *Six Elements and Their True Records*:
Disaster strikes the **Seven Officials**.
Its effects are sudden downpours, thunderous claps, and tremors—
**Heavenly and Earthly qi** contend,
Giving rise to this transformation.
Within their mingling,
Harm befalls the **束盛** [shùshèng],
And **scaled creatures** are injured.
Deep and obscuring floods—
Deep and obscuring floods arise from **humidity’s** transformation.
(*Pinyin note: 黔, pronounced yīn or jīn.*)

The **lowly Monitor’s** cycle—
This is called **"Roaring Transformation"**—
Referring to years when **transformative qi** is scant:
*Jǐ-sì* [己巳], *jǐ-mǎo* [己卯], *jǐ-chǒu* [己丑], *jǐ-hài* [己亥], *jǐ-yǒu* [己酉], *jǐ-wèi* [己未].

When **transformative qi** is insufficient,
**Generative qi** dominates alone—
**Earth** is scarce, and **wood** monopolizes its function.

When **long qi** is orderly,
Rain follows its due time.
When **collecting qi** is balanced,
And there is no mutual aggression,
Then it remains orderly.
Since **transformative qi** is scant,
Rain deviates from its proper time.

Wind and cold arise together,
Grasses and trees flourish luxuriantly—
Wind is **wood**; cold is **water**.
Since **earth** is scarce, **cold qi** moves freely,
**Generative qi** dominates alone,
Thus grasses and trees spread and bloom beautifully.
They blossom but bear no fruit,
And what forms is hollow—
Though they flourish and appear beautiful,
**Generative qi** originates from **wood**,
But **transformative qi** is insufficient,
So their fruit is hollow within—
Thus they are flawed and evil.

Their **qi** disperses—
**Qi** is restless, and **wood** scatters it,
Following **wood’s** wind, hence its dispersal.
Their essence remains steadfast—
Though it cannot dominate the season’s affairs,
Yet when it acts, it ultimately returns to **earth’s virtue** and stability.

Its movements cause **sores, vomiting, fissures, rot, and abscesses**—
*Sores* are ulcers.
*Vomiting* is regurgitation.
*Fissures* are splits.
*Rot* is decay.
*Abscesses* are pus-filled sores.
Its onset is damp and sluggish—
**Earth’s** nature.
Dampness is moisture.
It lodges in the **spleen**—
Its stored disease.
Its fruits are **plums and chestnuts**—
Plums are **wood**; chestnuts are **water fruits**.
Their flesh is moist, their pits hard.
(*Newly corrected annotation reads:*
Examine the preceding and following—moist fruits belong to **water**; here, *moist* should be *fleshy*. The *Wang* annotation is also incorrect.)

Its grains are **beans and hemp**—
Beans are **water**; hemp is **wood grain**.
Their flavor is **sour and sweet**—
Sweet-flavored things, ripe with sourness.
Their color is **greenish-yellow**—
Yellow-hued things, externally tinged with green.
Its livestock are **oxen and dogs**—
**Earth** follows **wood** in livestock.
Its insects are **hairy**—
*Hairy* follows *hair*.
Its effects are **floating anger and wild outbursts**—
**Wood’s qi** in action.
Its sounds are **gong and angle**—
*Gong* follows *angle*.
Its diseases are **retention, fullness, obstruction, and blockage**—
**Earth’s qi** congests and obstructs.
Following **wood’s** transformation,
It does not conquer, hence it follows other transformations.
**Minor Gong** and **Minor Angle** are the same—
Since **earth** is scarce, half follows **wood’s** transformation.
(*Newly corrected annotation reads:*
Examine the **Minor Official’s** cycle:
Within six years, excluding *jǐ-chǒu* [己丑] and *jǐ-wèi* [己未], it aligns with **Regular Official**,
*Jǐ-sì* [己巳] and *jǐ-hài* [己亥] align with **Regular Angle**—
Yet there are *jǐ-mǎo* [己卯] and *jǐ-yǒu* [己酉], two years where **Minor Official** and **Minor Angle** coincide,
Thus it does not say *"judge Angle"* separately.)

**Upper Official** aligns with **Regular Gong**.
When it meets **Tai Yin**,
Its generation and transformation align with **level-earth years**.
*Jǐ-chǒu* [己丑] and *jǐ-wèi* [己未] are the years it appears.
**Upper Angle** aligns with **Regular Angle**.
When it meets **Jue Yin**,
It is entirely a cycle of **spreading harmony**.
*Jǐ-hài* [己亥] and *jǐ-sì* [己巳] are the years it appears.
Its diseases are **diarrhea and dysentery**—
**Wind’s** victory.
**Evil injures the spleen**.
Even if other **qi** harms **metal**, it injures the spleen itself.
(*Newly corrected annotation reads:*
Examine this—it does not mention **Upper Sharp**,
For **earth** and **metal** do not mutually harm or attack,
Thus the *Classic* does not record it.
Another note says:
Even if other **qi** harms **metal**, it injures the spleen itself.
The character *gold* [金] is likely erroneous.)

When **floating, anger, and wild outbursts** prevail,
**Green and dry** things scatter and fall—
Floating, anger, and wild outbursts—**wood’s** lack of **virtue**.
**Green and dry** things—**metal’s** return.

Its **four directions** turn **greenish**—
East-south, west-south, west-north, east-north—**earth’s** positions.
(*Newly corrected annotation reads:*
According to the *Six Elements and Their True Records*:
Disaster strikes the **Five Officials**.)
Its effects are **the defeat and breaking of tigers and wolves**—
Tigers, wolves, monkeys, hyenas, leopards, deer, horses, roe deer, and muntjacs—
All four-legged beasts harmed by **excessive joy** and **life-force**.
(*Muntjac*, pronounced *jī*.)

The **clear qi** is thus employed, yet the **generative principle** is humbled.
When **metal qi** moves, **wood qi** bends.
Following the **Revolution of Change**—this is called **folding and gathering**.
The **folding of fire** and the **gathering of metal qi**—
these are the years of **Yǐ-Chǒu, Yǐ-Hài, Yǐ-Yǒu, Yǐ-Wèi, Yǐ-Sì, and Yǐ-Mǎo**.

When **gathering qi** is delayed, the **generative qi** ascends.
*Delayed*—this means untimely.
If **gathering qi** cannot proceed in due time,
then the **generative qi** naturally responds by spreading and employing itself.

**Nurturing and harmonizing virtue**, the **fire principle** then flourishes,
and all creatures multiply.
**Fire and earth qi** share the same **generative transformation**.
*Flourish*—to move.
When its qi ascends,
it follows **fire’s** nature.
Its application is **hasty and urgent**—
though late in use, once applied, it is swift and pressing,
following **fire’s** restlessness.

Its movements are **coughing, suppression, questioning, and reversal**—
*Coughing*—the sound of **metal**.
*Suppression*—the **Two Yins** restraining.
*Questioning*—inquiry.
*Reversal*—when **qi** rises counterflow.
(*"Flickering"*—when standing, it is called **"veiling"**.*)

Its manifestation is **coughing and wheezing**—
*Coughing*—the voice of **metal**.
*Wheezing*—the **lung’s** stored **qi**.
Its **storage** is in the **lung**,
governing **stored diseases**.
Its fruits are **plums and apricots**—
*Plum*—**wood**.
*Apricot*—**fire’s** fruit.
Their kernels are **pitted and veined**—
outside, there is a shell;
inside, there are **branched kernels**.

Its **grain** is hemp and wheat—
*Hemp*—**wood**.
*Wheat*—**fire’s** grain.
Wheat’s color is **red**.

Its **flavor** is bitter and spicy—
*Bitter* flavor **overpowers** spicy,
spicy **accompanied by** bitter.
Its **color** is white and vermilion—
**red** added to white.

Its **livestock** are parakeets and sheep—
**metal** following **fire’s** and **earth’s** combined transformation.
○The newly revised edition states: According to the detailed text, **fire** breeds horses, **earth** breeds cattle; now it speaks of sheep, hence Wang’s annotation says that following **fire’s** and **earth’s** combined transformation yields sheep. Some might argue for omitting the **earth** character in the annotation, but that would be incorrect.

Its **insects** are shell-bodied and feathered—
shell-bodied **follows** feathered.

Its **master** is the **illustrious, radiant, and scorching**—
**fire’s** **predominance**.

Its **sound** is **shang** and **zheng**—
*Shang* **follows** *zheng*.

Its **diseases** are sneezing, coughing, *yī* and *niǔ*—
**metal’s** diseases.
Following **fire’s** transformation, when **fire’s** **qi** comes to **overpower**, it **bends** to comply.
*Shào shāng* and *shào zhēng* are the same.
**Metal** is **deficient**, hence **half** follows **fire’s** transformation.
○The newly revised edition states: According to the detailed text, *shào shāng* governs the sixth year internally; except for the years *yǐ mǎo* and *yǐ yǒu* (which align with *zhèng shāng*), and *yǐ yǐ* and *yǐ hài* (which align with *zhèng jiǎo*), the years *yǐ chǒu* and *yǐ wèi* are when *shào shāng* aligns with *shào zhēng*, hence it does not state *"judging zhēng"* instead.

*Shàng shāng* aligns with *zhèng shāng*.
When **exposed to** *yáng míng*, it aligns with the **level metal** cycle’s **transformation**—*yǐ mǎo* and *yǐ yǒu* are the years when this **exposure** occurs.
*Shàng jiǎo* aligns with *zhèng jiǎo*.
When **exposed to** *jué yīn*, it aligns with the **level wood** cycle’s **transformation**—*yǐ yǐ* and *yǐ hài* are the years when this **exposure** occurs.
○The newly revised edition states: According to the detailed text, **metal** and **earth** have no **mutual overpowering or conquest**, hence the classic does not mention *shàng guān* aligning with *zhèng guān*.

Evil **injures** the **lung**.
When evil **overpowers**, it **returns** to the **lung**.
**Scorching light** and **violent brilliance** yield **ice, snow, frost, and hail**—
*Scorching light, violent brilliance*—**fire** lacks **virtue**.
*Ice, snow, frost, and hail*—**water’s** **repetition**.
When **water’s** **repetition** occurs, hail forms like **half-pearls**.
○The newly revised edition states: According to the annotation, hail forms like **half-pearls**; the *half* character is likely erroneous.

It is **announced** to the **Nine**—
*Nine*—the **west**.
○The newly revised edition states: Referring to the *Six Elements and Proper Sequence Great Treatise*, it says: *"Disaster to the Nine Offices."*

Its **master** is **scaled, latent, and rodent-like** **qi**—
**sudden and hidden**, the **year’s** **master** unleashes it,
to **injure** **red fruits** and **feathered** types.

When **year’s** **qi** arrives **early**, it **generates** **great cold**—
**water’s** transformation.

The **drying and flowing** **sequence** is called **reverse yang**—
when **yin** **qi** is insufficient, **yang** **qi** **substitutes** instead,
referring to the years *xīn wèi*, *xīn yǐ*, *xīn mǎo*, *xīn yǒu*, *xīn hài*, and *xīn chǒu*.

When **storage** does not **lift**, **transformation** **qi** **flourishes**—
**water** is **deficient** while **earth** is **abundant**.

When **long** **qi** is **proclaimed**, **creeping insects** do not **store**—
*Tài yáng* **resides in the spring**,
the **classic’s** **text** is **contradictory**.
*Jué yīn* and *yáng míng* **govern the sky**,
thus as the **classic** states.

When **earth** is **moistened** and **water’s** **spring** **diminishes**,
grasses and trees **sprout and flourish**,
luxuriant and **abundant** in **growth**—
**long** **transformation** **qi**, **rich** and **thick**.

Its **qi** is **stagnant**—
following **earth**.

Its **application** is **seepage and discharge**—
it **cannot flow**.

Its **movements** are **firm and halted**—
meaning **constipation**.
When **water** is **deficient** and does not **moisten**,
it becomes **dry** and **firmly halted**.
When **year’s** **qi** **cannot solidify**,
it **descends** and **rushes** downward.

Its **manifestation** is **dryness and withering**—
**yin** is **deficient** while **yang** is **abundant**, hence so.

Its **storage** is in the **kidney**,
governing **stored diseases**.

Its **fruits** are dates and apricots—
*Date*—**earth**.
*Apricot*—**fire’s** fruit.
Its **flesh** is **moist**—
*Moist*—**water**.

The flesh—**earth’s transformation**.

Its grains are **millet and sorghum**—
*millet*, **fire**;
*sorghum*, **earth’s grain**.

Its flavor is **sweet and salty**—
sweet **entering** salty, a **sweet and beautiful** taste.

Its hue is **dark yellow**—
yellow **mixed with black**.

Its livestock are **cattle in disorder**—
**water** follows **earth’s** herding.

Its creatures are **scaled and preserved**—
**scales** follow **preservation**.

Its dominion is **dust, dimness, and obscurity**—
**earth’s** triumph.

Its sound is **羽 (羽) and 宫 (Gong)**—
**羽** follows **official** (note).

Its diseases are **withering, tetany, and firm downward collapse**—
**water and earth** in **equal measure**, hence so.

From **earth’s transformation**—
**not overcoming earth**, thus following **other transformations**.

**Minor 羽 (羽) and minor 宫 (Gong)** are the same—
**water and earth** in **half-transformations**.

Its diseases are **itching and constipation**—
*itching*, **urine obstruction**;
*constipation*, **dry and difficult defecation**.

**Evil injures the kidney**—
**evil prevails**, thus **returning to the kidney**.

**Dust-dimness and sudden rain**—
then **shaking, pulling, uprooting, and snapping**—
**dust-dimness and sudden rain**, **earth’s tyranny**.
**Shaking, pulling, uprooting, and snapping**, **wood’s retaliation**.

**Reported to the One**—
**One**, the **North**.

All **directions**—
the **boundaries of kingdoms, prefectures, counties, and districts**.

Its governance is **visible fur and beasts**—
**transformation without concealment**.
*Visible fur*, **beasts and hares**—
**injured by yellow fruits**, **harming preserved creatures** as well.
*Transformation*, **spirits and foxes** take form.
*Without concealment*, **harming bundles and abundance**—
**mice, rabbits, foxes, and badgers**—
thus **visible fur without concealment**.

**End** (he-tuan).

Thus, **riding danger and moving**,
**not swift yet arriving**,
**violent and cruel without virtue**—
**disaster returns to them**.
The **slight** becomes **more slight**, the **severe** becomes **more severe**—
**qi’s** constant way.

**Passing through official (官) with Five Phases’ qi scarce**,
yet **victory and retaliation** are general.

**Riding the lonely and perilous**,
relying on **strength and dominance**,
**not summoned yet arriving**,
**exercising tyrannical authority**,
**resentment and calamity self-invited**—
who else to blame?

If **wood is weak** and **metal’s qi rides upon it**,
**violent and sudden**—
this is **without virtue**.
**Wood harmed by metal**, **fire retaliates**,
**metal harmed by fire**, then **disaster strikes**.

Thus—
**punishment severe, retaliation severe**;
**punishment slight, retaliation slight**—
**qi’s** constant movement,
naturally so.
The **Five Phases’ principles**,
all **alternate thus**.

**The record of generation**—
this is called **awakening and instructing**—
**things ride wood’s qi to generate**,
**awakening and instructing their form and substance**.

This is the **six-year transformation of 壬申, 壬寅, 壬子, 壬午, 壬辰, 壬戌**.

**Instructing**—ancient **陈 (chen)**.

**Earth is loose and draining**,
**blue qi ascends**—
**generative qi rises upward**,
thus **earth’s body is loose and draining**.

**Wood’s sole dominion**,
**blue qi ascends**.
**Ascend**—**pass through**, **emerge**, **move**.

**Yang warmth spreads transformation**,
**yin qi follows**—
**minor yang first arises**,
**emerging at the surface of all things**.
**Minor yin follows next**,
**circulating within all phenomena**.

**Generative qi is pure and transforming**,
**all things flourish**.

**Wood’s year is excessive**,
**metal does not come to overcome**,
**generative order spreads transformation**,
thus **things unfold and flourish**.

Its **transformation generates**,
its **qi is beautiful**—
**wood’s transformation spreads freely**,
thus **things’ appearance is upright and beautiful**.

Its **governance is dispersed**—
**spreading and generating flourishing**,
**reaching everywhere**.

Its **order is straight and expansive**—
**straight**, **orderly**;
**expansive**, **opening**.
Upright, orderly, and expansive—
all things follow,
**generative transformation** without **contrariness**.

Its **movements are dizziness, vertigo, and head disorders**—
**dizziness**, **spinning**;
**vertigo**, **revolving**;
**head**, **uppermost**;
**disorder**, **pathogenic qi**.

Its **virtue is wailing, murmuring, opening, and splitting**—
**wind-generated**.

Its grains are **hemp and rice**—
**wood’s transformation harmonizes with metal**.

Its livestock are **chickens and dogs**—
**harmonizing with geese and pregnancy**.

Its fruits are **plums and peaches**.

Plums and peaches—**their fruits are ripe**.

**Shaoyang**, the **gallbladder channel**.

Their **zang organs** are **liver and spleen**—
**liver** overcomes **spleen**.

Their **creatures** are **hairy and shelled**—
**wood’s remnant**, thus **hair harmonizes with shell growth**.

Their **forms** are **internally hard and externally hard**—
**internally hard** (with **pits/nuclei**), **harmonizing with** **skin-shell types**.

Their **ailments** are **anger**—
**wood’s remnant**, thus.

**Tai Jiao** aligns with **Shang Shang**—
**excessive wood-qi harmonizes with metal transformations**.

---
When **ascending**, its **qi reverses**—
its **ailments** are **vomiting and diarrhea**.
When **ascending** to **Shaoyin and Shaoyang**—
its **qi flows counter**—
In **Renzi and Renwu years**, it ascends to **Shaoyin**.
In **Renyin and Renshen years**, it ascends to **Shaoyang**.
**Wood’s remnant** encounters **fire**, thus **qi flows unnaturally**.

---
If **not tempered by virtue**, it **retreats and reverses**—
**autumn’s vigor sharpens**, **excessive killing** arrives,
**clear qi dominates**, grasses and trees wither,
**pathogenic forces harm the liver**.

**Overbearing excess** invades **earth**—
**earth-qi stagnates**, **metal reverses and rises**.
**Metal’s killing order** prevails, thus **pathogenic forces harm wood**.

---
**Hereditary cycles**—**this is called "proliferation and flourishing"**—
When **exceeding Taiyang**, **proliferation thrives**—
Called the years **Wuchen, Wuyin, Wuzu, Wuxu, Wushen, Wuwu**.

---
**Yin-qi internalizes**, **yang-qi externalizes**—
**yin and yang** follow their **sequence**.

**Scorching heat** spreads transformations—
**things flourish** from **abundant qi**.

**Long transformations** prevail—
**high qi** ascends—
**long transformations** spread, **things grow vast**.
**High qi** reaches—**things brighten**.

Its **governance shifts**—
**revolutionary changes**, **symbols unstable**.

Its **order is wailing and manifest**—
**fire’s use** has **sound**, **fire’s turbulence** has **flame**,
**symbols reveal nothing hidden**—**truth is clear**.
**Manifest** means **exposed**.

Its **movements** are **flaming, scorching, chaotic, and disruptive**—
**Chaotic**, **erroneous**; **disruptive**, **obstructive**.

Its **virtue** is **warmth, heat, suppression, and steaming**—
**heat transformations** generated, **long-lasting in things**.

---
Its **grains** are **wheat and beans**—
**fire harmonizes with water transformations**.

Its **livestock** are **sheep and oxen**—
**Harmonizing**, **gestation and nurturing**.

---
Its **fruits** are **apricots and chestnuts**—
**equal in ripeness**.

Their **colors** are **red, white, and black**—
**red** predominates over **white and black**, **upright and proper**.

Their **flavors** are **bitter, pungent, and salty**—
**pungent** blends with **bitter and salty**, **transformations harmonized**.

Their **symbolism aligns with summer**—
like **summer’s heat**.

Their **channels** are **hand Shaoyin and Taiyang**—
**Shaoyin**, the **heart channel**;

**Shaoyang**, the **san jiao channel**.

Their **zang organs** are **heart and lungs**—
**heart** overcomes **lungs**.

Its **creatures** are **feathered and scaled**—
**fire’s remnant**, thus **scales and feathers** transform in harmony.

Its **nature** is **veined and moist**—
**veins**, the **fire-element’s essence**;
**moist**, the **water-element’s nature**.
**Water and fire** transform in unity.

○*New Annotation*: Examining **"veins"**—it refers to **collaterals**.
Though the text differs, the meaning aligns.

Its **ailments** are **laughter, ague, festering sores with bleeding, and manic raving with reddened eyes**—
**fire’s excess** is the cause.
**Upper feathers** align with the **primary signs**.

Its **harvest** is **uniform**—
its **diseases**, when **Taiyang** ascends,
then **Heaven’s qi** restrains,
so **excessive fire** reverses to **harmonize with balanced fire’s generation and transformation**.
**Years of *wu-chen* and *wu-xu*** witness this.

If **balanced fire’s cycle** aligns,
then the **Five Phases’ qi** do not **clash**,
so **Metal’s restraining qi** generates and transforms equally.
**Upper signs** appear **after the harvest’s qi**.

When **Shaoyin and Shaoyang** ascend,
their **generation and transformation** govern themselves—
**Metal’s qi** cannot harmonize.
**Years of *wu-zi* and *wu-wu*** witness **Shaoyin**,
**Years of *wu-yin* and *wu-shen*** witness **Shaoyang**.
**Fire’s excess** delays the **harvest’s transformation**.

○*New Annotation*: Referring to *The Great Treatise on Qi Interactions*:
*"When the Year-Fire is excessive, ascending to Shaoyin and Shaoyang,
fire’s embers smolder, water’s springs dry—
creatures wither and perish.
Its governance is violent,
so the **zang-organs’ qi** recovers,
yet **chilling dampness** lingers.
Extreme cases bring **rain, ice, frost, and hail**—
**evil injures the heart**.
It neglects **virtue**, scornfully defying **governance**."*

○*New Annotation*: Referring to *The Great Treatise on Qi Interactions*:
*"Rain, ice, frost, and cold"*—
this is **parallel phrasing** with the above.

**Dunfu’s cycle**—this is called **broad transformation**.
**Earth’s excess**, so its **transformative qi** spreads widely among things.
This refers to the **years of *jia-zi*, *jia-xu*, *jia-shen*, *jia-wu*, *jia-chen*, and *jia-yin***.

**Thick virtue, serene and still**,
**following growth to fulfillment**—
**Earth’s nature** is **yielding and adaptive**,
**not contending with things**, so its **virtue is profound yet unhurried**,
**complying with fire’s nurturing**,
**letting all things’ transformative qi reach fullness**.

**Deep yin within, substantial**—
**things’ transformations complete**—
**Deep yin**, the **Earth’s refined essence**.
All **things’ transformations** rely on
this **deep yin’s numinous qi** generating within.

**Smoke and haze** obscure,
appearing in **thick Earth**—
**Thick Earth**, the **mountains**.
**Smoke-haze**, the **Earth’s qi**.

**Heavy rains fall in season**,
**moist qi** takes effect,
**dry governance** withdraws—
**moist qi’s activation** naturally **repels dryness**.

Its **transformation** is **round**,
its **qi** is **abundant**—
**transformation’s qi** is **plump and full** because of its **serenity**.

Its **governance** is **still**—
**stillness endures**, so **governance persists**.

Its **mandate** is **complete and thorough**—
**qi’s gentleness** ensures this.

Its **movement** is **moist, accumulating, and storing**—
**Movement** refers to **change**.
Its **virtue** is **soft, moist, heavy, and sorrowful**—
**still yet soft and moist**, so **thick virtue** endures forever.

*"Its transformation is soft, moist, and bountiful."*

Its **changes** are **shocking, gusting, and collapsing**—
**Shocking**, the **thunder’s eruption**;

**Earth’s nature is still**, so the illness manifests thus.
○*New Annotation*: Detailed here—it does not mention **上羽 (upper feathers)** or **上征 (upper signs)**, for **feathers and signs** cannot **deplete or overfill Earth**, thus lacking other symptoms.

When **great winds arrive swiftly**,
**evil harms the spleen**.
**Wood’s wrathful excess** causes **spleen injury**.
The **firm and binding cycle**—
**收引 (collecting and drawing in)**, **drawing in** meaning **converging**.
**Yang-qi converges**, **yin-qi is expended**,
so all things **converge and bind**.
This refers to the years of **庚子 (Gengzi)**, **庚午 (Gengwu)**, **庚辰 (Gengchen)**, **庚寅 (Gengyin)**, **庚戌 (Gengxu)**, and **庚申 (Gengshen)**.

**Heaven’s qi is pure**, **Earth’s qi is clear**—
**autumn’s high and pure qi**, akin to **Metal’s transformation**.
**Yang-qi follows**, **yin-qi governs transformation**—
**Yang and yin** interact to **generate and transform**.
**Dryness conducts its governance**,
things **fulfill their maturation**—
**dryness transforms all things**, **specializing in maturation**, leaving **nothing neglected or unfinished**.

**Collecting qi spreads abundantly**,
**transformation is thorough yet incomplete**—
**collecting and killing qi comes early**, so **Earth’s transformation cannot complete its function**.

○*New Annotation*: The **繁 (abundant)** character may be erroneous.

When **its transformation is complete**,
**its qi is diminished**—
**削 (sharpening)**, meaning **diminishing**.

Its **governance is solemn**—
**solemn**, meaning **clear and still**.

Its **mandate is keen and decisive**—

○*New Annotation*: According to *The Great Treatise on the Six Cosmic Cycles*, **德 (virtue)** acts as **化 (transformation)**.

Its **changes** are **solemn, killing, and withering**—
**things fall and perish out of season**.

Its **grains** are **rice and millet**—
**Metal and Fire** harmonized, bearing grain.

○*New Annotation*: According to this treatise’s earlier text, **wheat is Fire’s grain**, so it should read: **its grains are rice and wheat**.

Its **livestock** are **geese and horses**—
**齐 (harmonized)**, meaning **conception and nurturing**.

Its **fruits** are **peaches and apricots**—
**Metal and Fire** harmonized, bearing fruit.

**阳明 (Large Intestine channel)**, the **large intestine’s pulse**.

Its **organs** are **lungs and liver**—
**the lung prevails over the liver**.
Its **creatures** are **shells and feathers**—
**Metal’s excess**, so **shells and feathers** are harmonized and nurtured.

Its **substances** are **shells and networks**—
**shells**, Metal.
**networks**, Fire’s transformation.

Its **diseases** are **wheezing, panting, chest oppression, leaning forward, and breathlessness**—
**Metal’s excess qi**.
**Upper signs** align with the **正 (regular) and 商 (commercial)** cycles.
When **its growth is harmonized**, its **disease is coughing**.
**Upper signs** appear in **少阴 (Lesser Yin)** and **少阳 (Lesser Yang)**,
so **heaven’s qi is suppressed**,
making its **generation and transformation** akin to the **平金 (balanced Metal)** years.
In **庚子 (Gengzi)** and **庚午 (Gengwu)** years, **Lesser Yin** appears above.
In **庚寅 (Gengyin)** and **庚申 (Gengshen)** years, **Lesser Yang** appears above.
**Earth and Fire restrain Metal**, so **generative qi harmonizes with it**.
**Fire invades Metal’s lungs**, causing **coughing**.

○*New Annotation*: Detailed here—it does not mention **upper feathers**,
for **Water and Metal** do not **overcome or restrain each other**.

When **governance is violent and extreme**,
**Wood does not flourish**—
**tender and brittle things wither and turn brown**.
**Prolonged governance rescues**,
**great fire surges and scorches**—
**flaming heat arrives swiftly**,
**tender vines and grasses wither and die**.
When **violent governance does not cease**,
**Fire’s wrathful excess** spreads—
**fire surges, scorching and flaming**, causing **tender vines and fragile grasses** to **wither and die**.
**Fire invades Metal’s qi**, harming the **lungs**.

The **flowing and spreading cycle**—
**封藏 (sealing and storing)**, meaning **converging and binding**.

so **heaven and earth’s sealing and storing transformation** occurs—
this refers to the years of **丙寅 (Bingyin)**, **丙子 (Bingzi)**, **丙戌 (Bingxu)**, **丙申 (Bingshen)**, **丙午 (Bingwu)**, and **丙辰 (Bingchen)**.

**Cold governs transformation**,
**heaven and earth are stern and congealed**—
**yin-qi’s essence**.

**太阳 (Bladder channel)**, the **bladder’s pulse**.

Its **organs** are **kidneys and heart**—
**the kidney prevails over the heart**.
Its **creatures** are **scales and fur**—
**Water’s excess**, so **scales and fur** are harmonized and nurtured.

Its **substances** are **moist and distended**—
**moist**, Water.
**distended**, Earth’s transformation.

○*New Annotation*: According to the text, **Earth does not manifest as flesh**, **excess Earth** forms **muscle**; here **distended** is a mutual **interaction**.

Its **disease** is **distension**—
**Water’s excess**.
**Upper feathers** appear, and **prolonged transformation does not occur**.
When **太阳 (Greater Yang)** appears above,
**heaven’s qi cannot spread and transform** to **nurture and prolong**.

In the years **Gengchen (丙辰)** and **Gengxu (丙戌)**, above appears the **Heavenly Symbol (天符)** and **Water’s course (水运)**.

○*New Annotation*: According to the *Grand Treatise on the Interaction of Qi (气交变大论)*, when **Greater Yang (太阳)** prevails above,
**rain, ice, snow, and frost descend untimely (不时降)**, and **moist qi (湿气)** alters **substances (物)**.
It does not say **"above invades (上征)"**, for **the course (运)** prevails over it.
When **Water’s course (水运)** overreaches (政过),
**the transforming qi (化气)** surges greatly (大举),
and **dusty and moist qi (埃昏气)** intermingles (气交),
**heavy rains descend in due season (大雨时降)**,
while **evil (邪)** harms the **kidneys (肾)**.
Frequent violent cold (暴寒数举) is called **overreaching (政过)**.
When **Fire (火)** is suppressed by **Water’s excess (水凌)**,
**Earth (土)** comes to **avenge and retaliate (仇复)**,
hence **Heaven and Earth grow dim (昏翳)**,
**Earth and Water’s qi (土水气)** intermingles (气交),
**heavy rains descend (斯降)**,
and **evil (邪)** harms the **kidneys (肾)**.

Thus it is said:
**"If it does not maintain its virtue (不恒其德)**, then its **prevailing force (所胜)** returns to **avenge (来复)**.
**If it governs its principle (政恒其理)**, then its **prevailing force (所胜)** harmonizes and transforms (同化)**—**
this is what is meant.

**"Not overreaching (不怛)"** means **relying on its own excess (恃已有余)**,
**invading and suppressing (凌犯)** what it cannot prevail over (不胜).
**"Overreaching (怛)"** means **restraining its natural transformation (守常之化)**,
so that its **威刑 (power and authority)** does not run rampant (不肆威刑).
Thus, the **qi of self-restraint (克己之气)**,
each year **harmonizes and governs (同治化)** the **course (运)**.

○*New Annotation*: Detailed discussion of **overreaching (太过)** is found in the *Grand Treatise on the Interaction of Qi (气交变大论)*.

**The Grand Treatise on the Five Constant Principles (五常政大论篇下)**

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"Why does the sky not suffice in the west and north? It brings cold on the left and frost on the right.
Why does the earth not satisfy in the east and south? It brings heat on the right and warmth on the left.
What is the reason for this?"*

The face turns **perverse (巽)**, and speech follows.

Qibo replied:
*"The differences in the **Dao/Way (理)** of **yin-yang qi (阴阳之气)** and the high-low nature of the earth are due to variations in scale.
High and low refer to the **terrain (地形)**.
Scale refers to the varying abundance of **yin-yang qi (阴阳之气)**.

Now, the central plains’ terrain is high in the west and north and low in the east and south.
The west is cool, the north is cold, the east is warm, and the south is hot—
the transformations of **qi (气)** follow this pattern.

The east and south are **yang (阳)**.
**Yang (阳)** **essence (精)** descends to the lower regions,
so the right side is hot and the left side is warm.
When **yang (阳)** **essence (精)** descends,
the **qi (气)** of the earth is tempered and harmonized below.

**Yang qi (阳气)** arises in the east and flourishes in the south,
so the east is warm and the south is hot—
the abundance or scarcity of **qi (气)** is now clear.

The west and north are **yin (阴)**.
**Yin (阴)** **essence (精)** ascends to the upper regions,
so the left side is cold and the right side is cool.
When **yin (阴)** **essence (精)** ascends,
the **qi (气)** of the earth is tempered and harmonized above.

**Yin qi (阴气)** arises in the west and flourishes in the north,
so the west is frostbitten and the north is cold.
When the **sovereign (君)** faces **perverse (巽)** and speaks,
the **minister (臣)** faces **dry (乾)** and responds."*

○*New Annotation*: The detailed explanation of the **insufficiency of the sky and earth (天地不足)** and **yin-yang (阴阳)** is also found within the *Grand Treatise on Yin-Yang Correspondence and Symbolism (阴阳应象大论)*.

Thus, the earth has high and low regions,
and the **qi (气)** has variations of warmth and cold—
high regions are cold, and low regions are hot.

○*New Annotation*: According to the *Grand Treatise on the Six Cosmic Elements (六元正纪大论)*:
*"In the highest lands, the **qi (气)** of winter remains constant,
and in the lowest lands, the **qi (气)** of spring remains constant."*

Therefore, those who dwell in extreme coldness develop **distension (胀)**,
and those who dwell in extreme warmth develop **ulcers (疮)**.
Descending (to lower regions) relieves **distension (胀)**,
and sweating (to cool) relieves **ulcers (疮)**—
this is the **principle of prevailing force (胜理)** in opening and closing.
It is merely a variation in scale.

The west and north, the east and south—
these are the larger divisions.

If we verify this through **climatic conditions (气候)**,
the central plains’ terrain shows that dwelling in high regions brings cold,
while dwelling in low regions brings heat.

Observe it empirically:
High mountains are rich in snow,
flat plains are abundant in rain,
high mountains are cold,
flat plains are hot—
then the distinction between high and low regions and their cold and hot **qi (气)** becomes evident.

Within the **central lands (中华之地)**,
the high and low regions are divided into three parts:
the first extends from **Han (汉)** and **Shu (蜀)**, **Jiangnan (江南)**, to the sea;
the second extends from **Han (汉)** north to **Pingyao County (平遥县)**;
the third extends from **Pingyao’s northern mountains (平遥北山)** north to the **northern frontier seas (蕃界北海)**.

Thus, the southern division is of great heat,
the middle division is of cold and heat in equal measure,
and the northern division is of great cold.
Outside these southern and northern divisions,
the extremes of cold and heat are even more pronounced.
In the division of great heat, the cold is slight,
and in the division of great cold, the heat is slight.

However, ascending to the very peaks of the highest mountains,
the southern and northern faces exhibit stark contrasts in cold and heat—
their **flourishing and withering (荣枯)** differ greatly.

Again, the east-west high-low distinctions are threefold:
the first extends from **Yiyuan County (沂源县)** west to **Shazhou (沙州)**;
the second extends from **Kaifeng County (开封县)** west to **Fenyuan County (汾源县)**;
the third extends from **Kaifeng County (开封县)** east to the **Canghai Sea (沧海)**.

Thus, the eastern division is of great warmth,
the middle division is of warmth and coolness in equal measure,
and the western division is of great coolness.
In the division of great warmth, the cold is two-fifths of its presence,
and in the division of great coolness, the heat is two-fifths of its presence.
Outside the divisions of warmth and coolness,
the extremes of warmth and frost are even more pronounced—
transforming into **great blazing heat (大暄)** and **great cold (大寒)**.

Approximately, the divisions are as such.

Yet, within the **nine divisions of land (九分之地)**,
the cold reaches its extreme in the **eastern north (束北)**,
and the heat reaches its extreme in the **western south (西南)**.

Within these nine divisions,
there are still high and low regions—
high regions are damp,
and low regions are dry—
these are minor variations within a single division.

If we speak broadly,
there are two major distinctions in high and low regions:
First, the central plains’ terrain is high in the west and north,
and low in the east and south.
Second, the **qi (气)** of **yin-yang (阴阳)** varies in abundance—
thus, the differences in **surface warmth and coolness (表温凉)** arise.

Now, if we verify this through **climatic conditions (气候)**,
we observe that **spring qi (春气)** travels westward,
**autumn qi (秋气)** travels eastward,
**winter qi (冬气)** travels southward,
and **summer qi (夏气)** travels northward.

If we measure against the middle division,
from **Kaifeng (开封)** to **Fenyuan (汾源)**,
the **climatic seasons (气侯)** align precisely with the **calendrical seasons (历侯)**.

If we measure against the eastward division,
from **Kaifeng (开封)** to the **Canghai Sea (沧海)**,
every hundred *li*,
**autumn qi (秋气)** arrives a day later,
and **spring qi (春气)** emerges a day earlier.

If we measure against the westward division,
from **Fenyuan County (汾源县)** west to the **frontier gravelly lands (蕃界碛石)**,
for those facing **southward (南向)** or **west-north to east-south (西北束南)**,
every forty *li*,
**spring qi (春气)** emerges a day later,
and **autumn qi (秋气)** arrives a day earlier;
for those facing **northward (北向)** or **east-north to west-south (束北西南)**,
every fifteen *li*,

「In general, this holds true. However, in elevated and steep regions, the **winter qi (冬气)** persists, while in lowlands and plains, the **summer qi (夏气)** lingers. By observing snow melting and grass flourishing, one may discern their nature.

Yet, the earth’s terrain inherently possesses rivers shaped like bows (**弓形川**), snakes (**蛇形川**), and moons (**月形川**). Since the land’s contours vary, the **vitality and decay (生杀荣枯)**—though the earth may be the same—are governed by differing **heavenly forces (天异)**.

Among these, there are regions facing **the *li* direction (离向)**, **the *bing* direction (丙向)**, **the *xun* direction (巽向)**, **the *yi* direction (乙向)**, or **the *shen* direction (震向)**, where **spring qi (春气)** arrives early and **autumn qi (秋气)** comes late, the difference being fifteen days. Conversely, in regions facing **the *ding* direction (丁向)**, **the *kun* direction (坤向)**, **the *geng* direction (庚向)**, **the *dui* direction (兑向)**, **the *xing* direction (辛向)**, **the *qian* direction (乾向)**, **the *kan* direction (坎向)**, or **the *gen* direction (艮向)**, **autumn qi (秋气)** arrives early and **spring qi (春气)** comes late, the difference being twenty days. These are the so-called **mountainous regions (带山之地)**; by carefully examining their orientation and aspect, one may understand their climate.

In **cool and cold regions (寒凉之地)**, the pores are mostly closed and rarely open. When closed, **yang qi (阳气)** does not disperse, making the region naturally cool, and thus the abdomen swells with distension (**腹铃胀**).

In **humid and hot regions (湿热之地)**, the pores are mostly open and rarely closed. When open, **yang qi (阳气)** disperses freely, making the region naturally warm, and thus the skin erupts with sores (**皮铃疮**).

If one **leaches (下之)**, the **central qi (中气)** is not left behind, and thus the distension ceases. If one **induces sweating (汗之)**, **yang qi (阳气)** leaks outward, and thus the sores abate.

The **Emperor (帝)** asked: *How does this relate to longevity and premature death?*
In discussing the **virtue/power (德)** of the land and its inhabitants’ longevity or early demise (**寿夭**), **Ghibber (岐伯)** replied:

*The longevity of those nourished by **yin essence (阴精)**, while those diminished by **yang essence (阳精)** die young. The **yin essence (阴精)**-nourished are found in highlands; the **yang essence (阳精)**-depleted dwell in lowlands. In **yin-dominant (阴方)** regions, **yang qi (阳)** does not wastefully leak out, and **cold qi (寒气)** holds firm externally. Thus, **evil influences (邪)** rarely penetrate, and the **true vital energy (正气)** remains steadfastly guarded, so longevity is prolonged.

In **yang-dominant (阳方)** regions, **yang qi (阳气)** is exhausted and disperses without restraint. **Wind and dampness (风湿)** frequently invade, and the **true vital energy (真气)** is depleted, so death comes early.

Examining this in practice, within the **Central Plains (中原)**, those in the **western-northern (西北)** regions tend toward longevity, while those in the **eastern-southern (东南)** regions die young. Even within these, there are slight variations—this is the great disparity in longevity and early death (**寿夭之大异**), which the **master of the four directions (方者)** must carefully assess.

The **Emperor (帝)** said: *Well spoken.*
Then he asked: *For those who fall ill, how should they be treated?*
**Ghibber (岐伯)** replied:

*In the **western-northern (西北)** regions, where **yang qi (阳气)** is dispersed and the climate is cool, one should treat with cooling and dispersing methods. In the **eastern-southern (东南)** regions, where **yang qi (阳气)** is constrained and the climate is warm, one should treat with warming and consolidating methods. This is what is called **“same disease, different treatment (同病异治)**.”

The people of the **western-northern (西方北方)** regions have dense, tightly closed pores (**皮肤闭胜理密**), and all consume **hot foods (食热)**, so treatments should prioritize **dispersion and cooling (宜散宜寒)**. The people of the **eastern-southern (东方南方)** regions have loose, open pores (**皮肤疏**), and all consume **cold foods (食冷)**, so treatments should prioritize **consolidation and warmth (宜收宜温)**.

**Dispersion (散)** refers to **warm bathing (温浴)**, ensuring the **internal and external channels (中外)** are unobstructed. **Consolidation (收)** refers to **warming the center (温中)** without inducing sweating (**不解表**)—this aligns with the natural **qi (气)** of the region.

Yet today’s common practices reverse this. Following them in treatment only worsens the condition.

The newly annotated text states: *The principles of treatment by direction are also detailed in the **“Discourse on Varying Laws and Regional Appropriateness (异法方宜论)”**. Thus it is said: In **cool and cold regions (气寒气凉)**, treat with **cooling and cold methods (寒凉)**, using **hot water immersion (行水渍之)**. In **warm and hot regions (气温气热)**, treat with **warming and hot methods (温热)**, strengthening the **internal defense (内守)**. One must harmonize with the region’s **qi (气)** to achieve balance (**平**), otherwise the effects are counterfeit.

**Leaching (下之)** with cold methods in **cold regions (寒方)** or inducing sweating with hot methods in **hot regions (热方)**, warming with **warm methods (温方)** in **warm regions (温方)**, and cooling with **cooling methods (凉方)** in **cooling regions (凉方)**—these are the **correct principles (正法)**, the **harmonization of qi (同气)**.

**Hot water immersion (行水渍之)** refers to **steeping in hot water (汤浸渍)**. **Balance (平)** means **adjusting to equilibrium (平调)**.

If in the **western-northern (西方北方)** regions there are **cold diseases (冷病)**, one must use **hot methods (热方)** or **warm methods (温方)** to eliminate them. If in the **eastern-southern (东方南方)** regions there are **heat ailments (热疾)**, one must use **cooling methods (凉方)** or **cold methods (寒方)** to treat them. Then one reverses the **correct principles (上正法)** to achieve the desired effect (**取之**).

The **Emperor (帝)** said: *Well spoken.*

*Why does a single region (州) have years where people do not fall ill, yet the **stored qi (藏气)** remains unused?*
**Ghibber (岐伯)** replied:

*The **heavenly qi (天气)** governs this, as the **qi (气)** has a source it follows. **Follow (从)**** means it adheres to external forces rather than being reserved for private, internal application.

The **Emperor (帝)** said: *I wish to hear the full explanation.*

**Ghibber (岐伯)** replied:

*In years when **Minor Yang (少阳)** presides over Heaven, **fire qi (火气)** descends upon the earth, while **lung qi (肺气)** ascends in response. **White Dew (白起)** signals the **metal qi (金)**’s usage, and vegetation turns green. When **fire (火)** manifests in **bright brilliance (墦炳)**, the **metal qi (革金)** is consumed, and the **Great Heat (大暑)** season progresses. Then **coughing (咳)**, **sneezing (嚏)**, **nasal congestion (欤趣)**, **stuffy nose (鼻窒)**, **daytime sores (日疡)**, and **cold-heat swelling (寒热驸肿)** occur—these are the seasonal patterns of the **years of the *yin* and *shen* stems (寅申之岁候)**.

**Presides (司)** means it **controls from above (御於下)**.
**Ascends (从)** means it **responds from below (从事於上)**.
**Manifests (起)** means its **value surpasses the market (价高於市)**.»

**Use** means the implementation of punishments and decrees—**presiding, ascending, emerging, and use** share the same principle.

**Revolution (革)** refers to hides and leather, also to transformation and renewal. **Metal (金)** pertains to vessels and tools. **Exhaustion (耗)** means expenditure and consumption. When **fire qi (火气)** blazes upward, **daily sores (日疮)** appear—**sores (疮)** being lesions on the body, **ulcers (疡)** those on the head. **Cold-heat (寒热)**—first cold, then hot—indicates **malaria (疟疾)**. The **lung (肺)**, harmed by heat, calls for **water (水)** to counter it; water pooling in the lungs causes **swelling (驸肿)**, a firm, unyielding distension—this arises from **Heaven’s qi (天气)**.

---
New annotation notes: *"Daily sores (日疮)"*—**sores (疮)** are body lesions; **ulcers (疡)** are head lesions. The text likely omits *"疮"* after *"日"* (or *"口"* in alternate versions replaces *"日"*).

When **wind (風)** rages on earth, dust and sand fly, causing **heart pain (心痛)**, **stomach cavity distress (胃院痛)**, **reverse peristalsis (厥逆)**, and **blocked diaphragm (鬲不通)**—these stem from **violent onset (暴速)**. The **two Yin channels (二厌阴)** lie in the **Spring (泉)**, so **wind (風)** rages on earth. **Excessive excess (幾淫所勝)** breeds these ailments. **Minor Yang (少陽)** and **Ulterior Yin (厥陰)**, swift in transformation, thus **disease qi (病氣)** erupts rapidly—hence, *"violent onset (暴速)"*—this stems from **disordered earth qi (地氣)**.

---
New annotation notes: *"Ulterior Yin (厥陰)"* and *"Minor Yang (少陽)"* in the **Spring (泉)** explain their **rapid onset (主暴速)** and **quick activation (發機速)**—no need to specify *"severe"* before each ailment.

**Major Yang (陽明)** presides over Heaven, **dry qi (燥氣)** descends, **liver qi (肝氣)** ascends in response, and **blue-green (苍起)** signals **wood’s (木)** emergence and **earth’s (土)** declaration. **Frequent severe cold (赓沧数至)** withers grass, causing **rib pain (胁痛)**, **red eyes (目赤)**, **shivering tremors (掉振鼓栗)**, and **withered tendons (筋痿)** unable to stand long. These are the seasonal patterns of the **years of the *mão* and *yǒu* stems (卯酉之歲候)**.

**Wood’s use (木用)** also means **wood’s function (木功)**. **Severe cold (赓沧)** is **great frost (大凍)**—these diseases arise from **Heaven’s qi (天氣)**.

When **sudden heat (暴热)** arrives, **earth (土)** grows **hot (暑)**, **yang qi (陽氣)** surges upward, **urine changes (小便變)**, **cold-heat (寒熱)** like **malaria (疟)**, worsening to **heart pain (心痛)**. **Fire (火)** scorches and dries **(干#8槁)**, **flowing water (流水)** fails to freeze, and **parasites (垫虫)** appear. **Minor Yin (少陰)** lies in the **Spring (泉)**, with **heat (熱)** flourishing on earth—thus these ailments arise from **earth qi (地氣)**.

---
**Major Yin (太陽)** presides over Heaven, **cold qi (寒氣)** descends, **heart qi (心氣)** ascends in response, and **fire (火)** grows **bright (明)**.
---
New annotation notes: *"Fire (火) grows bright (且明)"* should read *"fire’s use (火用)"*.

**Red (丹起)** emerges, **metal (金)** turns **blue-green (青)**. When **cold clears (寒清)** at its proper time, it **prevails (勝)**, and **water freezes (水冰)**. **Fire qi (火氣)** blazes upward, causing **heart heat (心熱)**, **dry throat (隘乾)**, **excessive thirst (善渴)**, **hunger with sneezing (饥嚏)**, **mood swings (喜悲)**, and **prolonged duration (数久)**. When **heat qi (熱氣)** acts erratically, **cold returns (寒乃復)**, **frost descends untimely (霜不时降)**, **forgetfulness (善忘)** worsens to **heart pain (心痛)**. These are the seasonal patterns of the **years of the *chén* and *xū* stems (辰戌之歲候)**.

**Cold clears at its proper time (寒清时举)** follows **Major Yang’s (太#9陽)** decree. **Fire qi blazing upward (火氣高明)** means it **scorches (翻灼)** all things. **Untimely (不时)** refers to **too early or one-sided harm (太早及偏害)**, failing to follow **seasonal order (時令)** or **affect all things (普及於物)**—these diseases arise from **Heaven’s qi (天氣)**.

**Earth (土)** grows **moist (润)**, **water (水)** overflows, **guest cold (寒客)** arrives, **deep yin transforms (沉阴化)**, **damp qi (湿氣)** alters substances, **internal water retention (水饮内蓄)** causes **midriff fullness (中满)**, **skin pain (皮痛)**, **fleshy irritation (肉苛)**, **stiff tendons (筋脉不利)**, worsening to **swelling (驸肿)** and **posterior paralysis (身后瘫)**.
---
New annotation notes: *"Posterior paralysis (身后瘫)"* should read *"posterior difficulty (身后难)"*.

**Major Yin (太陰)** lies in the **Spring (泉)**, with **dampness (湿)** flourishing on earth—thus these ailments arise from **earth qi (地氣)**.

---
**Ulterior Yin (厥陰)** presides over Heaven, **wind qi (風氣)** descends, **spleen qi (脾氣)** ascends in response, and **earth (土)** grows **prominent (隆)**. **Yellow (黄起)** emerges, **water (水)** turns **blue-green (青)**. **Earth’s revolution (土用革)**—**heavy body (体重)**, **withered muscles (肌肉萎)**, **poor appetite (食臧)**, **dry mouth (口爽)**—when **wind (風)** rages in **vast emptiness (大虚)**, **clouds and phenomena sway (云物摇动)**, **eyes spin (目转)**, **ears ring (耳呜)**. These are the seasonal patterns of the **years of the *wèi* and *hài* stems (巳亥之歲候)**.

**Earth’s prominence (土隆)**, **earth’s revolution (土用革)**—**earth qi (土氣)** shifts, transforming its form, also meaning **earth’s function (土功事)**. **Clouds and phenomena sway (云物摇动)** signals **high wind (風高)**—these diseases arise from **Heaven’s qi (天氣)**.

When **fire (火)** rages **violently (纵其暴)**, **earth (地)** grows **hot (暑)**, **intense heat (大热)** consumes and melts, **redness descends (赤沃下)**, **parasites (垫虫)** appear frequently, and **flowing water (流水)** fails to freeze. **Minor Yang (少陽)** lies in the **Spring (泉)**, with **fire (火)** forming on earth—thus these ailments arise from **earth qi (地氣)**, their **root signs (宗兆)**.

Their **activation is swift (發機速)**—**Minor Yang (少陽)** and **Ulterior Yin (厥陰)** qi transform **suddenly (卒急)**, so diseases erupt **rapidly (速若發機)**—hence, *"activation is swift (發機速)"*.

---
**Minor Yin (少陰)** presides over Heaven, **heat qi (熱氣)** descends, **lung qi (肺氣)** ascends in response, and **white (白起)** signals **metal’s (金)** use, with **vegetation turning green (草木青)**. **Wheezing (喘)**, **nausea (呕)**, **cold-heat (寒熱)**, **sneezing (嚏)**, **nasal congestion (凯钮鼻窒)**, and **great heat (大暑)** spread. These are the seasonal patterns of the **years of the *zǐ* and *wǔ* stems (子午之歲候)**.

**Heat (熱)** presides over **Heaven’s qi (天氣)**, so these diseases arise from **Heaven’s influence (天氣之作)**. Worsening leads to **ulcers (疮疡)** and **scorching (墦灼)**, with **metal melting (金烁)** and **stones flowing (石流)**—this marks **Heaven’s convergence (天之交)**.

**Earth (地)** grows **dry (燥)**. **Frequent severe cold (赓沧数至)** causes **rib pain (胁痛)** and **excessive sighing (善太息)**. **Austerity and killing (肃杀行)** alter **vegetation (草木变)**.
---
**Change (变)** means **altering guest substances (变易客质)**. **Rib pain and sighing (胁痛太息)** arise from **earth qi (地氣)**.

---
**Major Yin (太陰)** presides over Heaven, **damp qi (湿氣)** descends, **kidney qi (肾氣)** ascends in response, and **black (黑起)** signals **water’s (水)** transformation.
---
New annotation notes: *"Minor fire declares (少火乃告)"* should be inserted here based on preceding context.

**Mist and rain (埃冒云雨)** clog the **chest (胸中不利)**, **yin withering (阴痿)** weakens **qi (气)** so it **fails to rise (大衰而不起)**.
---
New annotation notes: *"Fails to rise (不起不用)"* should read *"water’s use (水用)"*.

When **at its proper time (当其时)**, **lumbar victory pain (反腰胜痛)** and **movement discomfort (动转不便)** occur. These are the seasonal patterns of the **years of the *chǒu* and *wèi* stems (丑未之歲候)**.

**Water’s transformation (水变)** means **sweet springs turn salty (甘泉变咸)**. **Mist (埃)** is **earthly fog (土雾)**. **Unbounded (冒)** means **no distant separation (不分远)**. **Clouds and rain (云雨)** are **earth’s transformation (土化)**. **Yak (雅)** refers to **buttock flesh (臀肉)**—these ailments arise from **Heaven’s qi (天氣)**.

**Reverse peristalsis (厥逆)**.

The **Yellow Emperor** asked: *"In years when pregnancy fails or gestation is incomplete, and treatment does not fully restore health, what forces of **Dao/Way** cause this?"*

**Gebi** replied: *"The six **qi** and five elemental phases interact through mutual conquest and regulation. When aligned, they flourish; when opposed, they decline—this is the eternal **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth, the constant principle of generation and transformation.

Thus, when **Juéyin** governs above, **hairy insects** are still, **feathered insects** thrive, and **armored insects** fail to develop*—these are the years of the *chǒu* and *wèi* stems: *yǐ-sì, dīng-sì, jǐ-sì, xīn-sì, guǐ-sì, yǐ-hài, dīng-hài, jǐ-hài, xīn-hài, guǐ-hài*. **Stillness** means **silence**. It also means **retreat**, not acting prematurely. **Feathered insects**, being **fire-insects**, share **Earth’s** nature. Since **fire subdues metal**, armored insects fail to develop*—referring to white-shelled insects bearing little fruit.

When **in the springs**, **hairy insects** thrive, **preserved insects** diminish, and **feathered insects** fail to develop. **Earth-qi** subdues **Earth**, depleting **yellow preserved insects**, and when the year aligns with **Wood**, this effect is even greater. **Feathered insects** fail to develop due to **Shao-yang’s** self-restraint—these are the years of the five *yín* and five *shēn* stems.

When **Shao-yin** governs above, **feathered insects** are still, **armored insects** thrive, and **hairy insects** fail to develop*—these are the years of the *zǐ* and *wǔ* stems: *jiǎ-zǐ, bǐng-zǐ, wǔ-zǐ, gēng-zǐ, rén-zǐ, jiǎ-wǔ, bǐng-wǔ, wǔ-wǔ, gēng-wǔ, rén-wǔ*. **Stillness** refers to **barbarian birds, swallows, and magpies**—in these years, black-haired insects bear little fruit.

When **in the springs**, **feathered insects** thrive, **armored insects** diminish and fail to develop. **Earth-qi** subdues **Metal**, so white-armored insects fail to develop, and when the year aligns with **Fire**, this effect is even more severe—these are the years of the five *mǎo* and five *yǒu* stems.

When **Tài-yin** governs above, **preserved insects** are still, **scaled insects** thrive, and **feathered insects** fail to develop*—these are the years of the *chǒu* and *wèi* stems: *yǐ-chǒu, dīng-chǒu, jǐ-chǒu, xīn-chǒu, guǐ-chǒu, yǐ-wèi, dīng-wèi, jǐ-wèi, xīn-wèi, guǐ-wèi*. **Preserved insects** include **humans and toads**. **Feathered insects** refer to **green-blue creatures**—parrots, mandarin ducks, and other green-blue feathered beings. When the year aligns with **Metal**, this effect is even more severe.

When **in the springs**, **preserved insects** thrive, **scaled insects** fail to develop*—**Earth-qi** subdues **Water**, so black-scaled insects fail to develop, and when the year aligns with **Earth**, this effect is even more severe—these are the years of the five *chén* and five *xū* stems.

When **Shao-yang** governs above, **feathered insects** are still, **hairy insects** thrive, and **preserved insects** fail to develop*—these are the years of the *yín* and *shēn* stems: *jiǎ-yín, bǐng-yín, wǔ-yín, gēng-yín, rén-yín, jiǎ-shēn, bǐng-shēn, wǔ-shēn, gēng-shēn, rén-shēn*. **Preserved insects** refer to **green-blue creatures**. **Feathered insects** refer to **black-feathered birds**—barbarian swallows and magpies. When **in the springs**, **feathered insects** thrive, **armored insects** diminish, and **hairy insects** fail to develop. **Earth-qi** subdues **Metal**, so white-armored insects diminish, and when the year aligns with **Fire**, this effect is even greater. **Hairy insects** fail to develop due to **Heaven’s** restraint—these are the years of the five *sì* and five *hài* stems.

When **Yángmíng** governs above, **armored insects** are still, **feathered insects** thrive, and **armored insects** fail to develop*—these are the years of the *mǎo* and *yǒu* stems: *yǐ-mǎo, dīng-mǎo, jǐ-mǎo, xīn-mǎo, guǐ-mǎo, yǐ-yǒu, dīng-yǒu, jǐ-yǒu, xīn-yǒu, guǐ-yǒu*. **Feathered insects**, being **fire-insects**, flourish. **Armored insects** refer to **red-shelled creatures**. Red-armored insects fail to develop due to **Heaven’s** restraint. When **in the springs**, **armored insects** thrive, **hairy insects** diminish, and **feathered insects** fail to develop. **Earth-qi** subdues **Wood**, so black-haired insects diminish, and when the year aligns with **Metal**, this effect is even more severe—these are the years of the five *zǐ* and five *wǔ* stems.

**Feathered insects** failing to develop aligns with **Shao-yin’s** earlier pattern.

When **Tàiyáng** governs above, **scaled insects** are still, and **preserved insects** thrive*—these are the years of the *chén* and *xū* stems: *jiǎ-chén, bǐng-chén, wǔ-chén, gēng-chén, rén-chén, bǐng-xū, jiǎ-xū, wǔ-xū, gēng-xū, rén-xū*. **Preserved insects** thrive due to **Earth-qi’s** influence. **Scaled insects** are still—referring to **yellow-scaled creatures** failing to act. In these years, thunder is rarely heard, as **Heaven’s qi** suppresses it.

When **in the springs**, **scaled insects** diminish, and **preserved insects** fail to develop. **Heaven’s qi** conquers, depleting **yellow and black-scaled insects**—these are the years of the five *chǒu* and five *wèi* stems.

In years where the **running cycle** fails to develop:
- Aligning with **Wood**, **preserved insects** fail to develop.
- Aligning with **Fire**, **armored insects** fail to develop.
- Aligning with **Earth**, **scaled insects** fail to develop.
- Aligning with **Metal**, **hairy insects** fail to develop.

In the **running cycle** of **Water**, **winged insects** fail to develop.
When this occurs, it is the same as the above years—all are diminished in their ability to nurture.

These are the cases where **the running cycle** aligns with **the Five Qi**—when it aligns with their victorious phase, and further encounters **Heaven’s resonance** and **yearly conjunctions**, then **ten out of every hundred** will fail to fully develop, and **one or two** will succeed.

Thus, **the Five Qi** have their own dominion, yet are subject to suppression; **the yearly stems** establish their own patterns, yet are also subject to suppression. **Earth-qi** suppresses its own victorious phase, while **Heaven’s qi** suppresses the victorious phase of others. **Heaven** suppresses **color**, **Earth** suppresses **form**. When **Heaven’s qi** follows its own phase without suppression, it is said to suppress **color**; when **Earth-qi** follows its own victorious phase, it is said to suppress **form**. Hence, it is also stated: **"Heaven suppresses color, Earth suppresses form."**

Therefore, between **Heaven** and **Earth**, the **Five Categories** of birth and transformation—each suppressing, each transforming, each generating, each being suppressed—vary in their flourishing and decline according to the **Five Qi’s** natural tendencies. When conditions are favorable, they thrive. Thus, there are cases of **conception and gestation failing to bear fruit**, and **governance not being complete**—these are the **norms of the Five Qi**.

Between **Heaven** and **Earth**, all things that are born are encompassed by these **Five Categories**. The Five are: **hairy, winged, preserved, scaled, and armored insects**. Hence it is said:

*"Hairy insects* number **three hundred and sixty**, with the **unicorn** as their sovereign.
*Winged insects* number **three hundred and sixty**, with the **phoenix** as their sovereign.
*Preserved insects* number **three hundred and sixty**, with **humans** as their sovereign.
*Scaled insects* number **three hundred and sixty**, with the **dragon** as their sovereign.
*Armored insects* number **three hundred and sixty**, with the **tortoise** as their sovereign.

All creatures, whether **near or distant, divergent or unified, crawling or flying, breathing or gestating**, great or small, high or low, **green, yellow, red, white, or black**—those whose bodies are clad in **hair, feathers, scales, or armor**—are collectively referred to as **insects**. Those lacking all four of these attributes are called **preserved insects**.

Near these **five creatures**, all exhibit **conception, gestation, damp generation, or transformation**. According to human governance, these are spoken of as the **central roots**. The **root of vital breath** lies within the **central core of their forms**. *Central* refers to **roots**.

Those not belonging to these **Five Categories** rely entirely on external conditions for their birth and transformation. Remove these conditions, and the **vital breath** will vanish. The **roots dependent on the external** are also five:
The **Five Flavors** and **Five Colors**.

However, the **Five Phases**—**Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water**—all derive their forms from external substances and **color-transformations**, thereby enabling birth and transformation. Once external conditions are removed, **vital breath** is severed and lost. Thus, all are **rooted externally**.

**Newly corrected annotation** states: In the detailed notes, the phrase *color-transformations* should be rendered as *already formed*.

Therefore, the distinctions in birth and transformation involve the **Five Qi, Five Flavors, Five Colors, Five Categories, and Five Appropriateness**. Yet among these **twenty-five** aspects, all are **central roots** or **external conditions**.

The **Five Qi** are: **stimulating, scorching, fragrant, putrid, and decaying**.
The **Five Flavors** are: **sour, bitter, sweet, pungent, and salty**.
The **Five Colors** are: **green, yellow, red, white, and black**.
The **Five Categories** are twofold: the first are **hairy, winged, preserved, scaled, and armored insects**; the second are **dry, damp, fluid, firm, and soft**.

All these, within the myriad things, have their own **natural correspondences**. The **Emperor** asked: *"What does this mean?"*

Qiébò said:

*"What takes root within is called **spiritual mechanism** (*shénjī*). When the spirit departs, the mechanism ceases. What takes root without is called **established qi** (*qìlì*). When the qi stops, transformation ends.

All things with form—those rooted within have their origin bound to Heaven, and their movements are subtle and ethereal. Their actions are governed by the interplay of spiritual qi and mechanism, so their operations remain imperceptible to the myriad things. Thus, when the spirit departs, the pathways of mechanism and action are extinguished. Those rooted without have their origin bound to Earth, so their growth, transformation, maturation, and storage all arise from the established qi of creation. Thus, their emergence is also imperceptible to the myriad things. Therefore, when the qi ceases, the pathways of generation and transformation are utterly extinguished.

As for wood, fire, earth, metal, and water—whether dry, damp, fluid, firm, or yielding—their inherent natures remain unchanging. Yet when external influences depart, when vital qi withdraws, and when the roots of transformation are severed, their constant forms, natures, and colors all undergo slight variations day by day."*

The *New Annotation* states: *"As the *Six Microcosmic Principles Great Treatise* says: When the processes of ingress and egress fail, spiritual mechanism and transformation perish. When ascent and descent falter, established qi becomes solitary and precarious. Without ingress and egress, there can be no growth, flourishing, aging, or decline. Without ascent and descent, there can be no generation, transformation, maturation, or storage. Thus, each has its governing principles, its victories, its origins, and its completion. Both internal and external roots follow this pattern. Hence it is said: Without knowing the years’ influence and the similarities and differences in qi, one cannot speak of generation and transformation."*

The *New Annotation* further states: *"As the *Six Nodal Cycles and Symbols Treatise* says: Without knowing the years’ influence, the ebb and flow of qi, and the rise of emptiness and fullness, one cannot be a skilled practitioner."*

The Emperor asked: *"Qi initiates generation and transformation, disperses to form shape, spreads to nurture, and concludes when form alters—its essence is singular. 'Initiate' refers to the first stirrings of motion. 'Disperse' means to flow through things. 'Spread' means to transform into structured form. 'Conclude' refers to the extreme of storage and maturation. Thus, motion initiates generation and transformation, dispersion forms shape, spreading achieves structure, and conclusion brings about all changes in phenomena. Observing this in practice: Between Heaven and Earth, among all formed things, life begins soft and weak, while death is firm and strong. Such transformations in life and death, in form and substance—this is what is meant by the conclusion of qi."*

The *New Annotation* states: *"As the *Grand Record of the Heavenly Stem* says: The emergence of things is called transformation; their culmination is called change. Again, the *Six Microcosmic Principles Great Treatise* says: Things generate through transformation; things reach their limit through change. Change and transformation intermingle, giving rise to success and failure. Yet the Five Flavors, though they sustain life, vary in their capacity for transformation—some generate more, some less; some mature swiftly, some slowly. Why is this so?"*

Qiébò replied: *"It is the influence of Earth’s qi. Heaven does not generate; Earth does not nourish. Though Heaven and Earth are indifferent to generation and transformation, the qi of generation and transformation inherently differs. Why? Because within Earth’s substance lie the Six Ingresses. Since qi varies, there is generation and transformation, non-generation and non-transformation, scant generation and transformation, and abundant generation and transformation. Thus, between Heaven and Earth, there are some things that generate and transform, some that do not, some that generate and transform sparingly, and some that do so extensively—each follows the divisions of its qi, its affinities and aversions, its similarities and differences."*

The Emperor said: *"I wish to hear this principle."*

Qiébò said: *"Cold, heat, dryness, and dampness each transform differently. If one understands how these four qi differ, the transformations of warmth and coolness become clear.

When *Shao-Yang* is in the *Quan*, cold poisons do not arise. Its flavor is pungent, its treatment involves bitter and sour, and its grains are *cāngdān* (barley and millet). This is the *Yǐ-Hài* year’s transformation. Poisons are all manifestations of the violent and excessive qi of the Five Phases. Now, fire is within Earth, its qi being pure heat. Cold poisons, whose qi differs from Earth’s, thus generate differently, resulting in scant life. Fire restrains metal qi, so pungent flavors do not transform. *Shao-Yang*’s qi ascends to nourish *Jué-Yin*, hence the year’s transformation involves bitter and sour flavors. *Shao-Yang* governs the year harmoniously, with wood and fire succeeding one another, so there is no conflicting qi. Bitter and *dān* (millet) arise from Earth’s qi, while sour and *cāng* (barley) arise from Heaven’s qi. All other transformations involve ascending and descending victories and restraints, hence they all have conflicting qi.

When *Yang-Ming* is in the *Quan*, damp poisons do not arise. Its flavor is sour, its qi damp. The *New Annotation* states: *In the six cases of 'in the Quan,' only the years of Yang-Ming and Tai-Yin specify 'its qi is damp' and 'its qi is hot,' as dampness and dryness do not yet reveal cold or warm qi, hence the repetition of 'its qi.'* Its treatment involves pungent, bitter, and sweet, and its grains are *dān* (millet) and *sù* (rice). This is the *Zǐ-Wǔ* year’s transformation. Dryness is within Earth, its qi cool and clear, so damp and warm poisons generate and transform sparingly. Metal and wood restrain each other, so sour flavors transform little. *Yang-Ming*’s qi ascends to nourish *Shào-Yin*, hence the year’s transformation involves pungent and bitter flavors. Pungent and *sù* (rice) arise from Earth’s qi. Bitter and *dān* (millet) arise from Heaven’s qi. Sweet is conflicting qi. Thus, to resolve the victories and restraints of metal and fire, it also treats with sweetness.

When *Tai-Yang* is in the *Quan*, heat poisons do not arise. Its flavor is bitter, its treatment involves bland and salty, and its grains are *gǔ* (millet) and *zū* (barley). This is the *Chǒu-Wèi* year’s transformation. Cold within Earth differs from heat in transformation, so the year’s things do not generate heat poisons. Wood overcomes fire, hence the flavor should be bitter. *Tai-Yang*’s qi ascends to nourish *Tài-Yin*, hence its transformation generates bland and salty flavors."*

「When *Tài-Yin* (Earth’s *Yin*) **qi** ascends to nourish Heaven, its **qi** is distant yet lofty, so the transformation of sweetness is subtle and becomes bland. Hence, bland is also a type of sweet, belonging to its category. Bland subtlety is Heaven’s transformation. Salty and millet are Earth’s transformation. Subtlety is yellow in hue. *○ Newly corrected:* The detailed annotation states: *"Its flavor should be bitter"* is an error; it should read *"bitter is not transformed,"* a scribal mistake in transmission.

When *Gù-Yīn* (Minor *Yin*) is in the *Quan* (Spring), cold poisons do not arise. Its flavor is sweet, its treatment involves sour and bitter, and its grains are *cāng* (sprouted barley) and *chì* (red millet). This is the *Chǒu-Wèi* (Year of the Pig) and *Shēn-Yǒu* (Year of the Rooster) transformation. Earth’s warmth differs in nature from cold, so its medicinal substances rarely generate cold poisons. Wood overcomes Earth, hence sweetness is minimally transformed. *Gù-Yīn*’s **qi** ascends to harmonize with *Shào-Yáng* (Minor *Yang*), and since the harmonized **qi** lacks conflicting elements, its transformation involves sour and bitter flavors. Sour and sprouted barley are Earth’s transformation. Bitter and red millet are Heaven’s transformation. As there is no conflicting **qi** of victory or restraint, sweetness is not used to resolve the transformations. Its **qi** is singular, its flavor is true. In the years when *Gù-Yīn* and *Shào-Yáng* are in the *Quan*, their **qi** transformations are singular and pure.

However, in other years, the **qi** of Heaven and Earth both have conflicting forces of victory and restraint, so they all involve sweetness and sweet flavors in their transformations to mitigate the excesses and suppressions. The remaining bitter, sour, and salty flavors differ in their transformations, hence the distinctions between Heaven and Earth. Medicinal substances with pungent and sweet flavors are more prevalent.

Thus it is said: To supplement Heaven and Earth, follow their **qi**; to treat them, counter their **qi**; adjust according to the predominance of cold and heat in their locations. Heaven refers to *Sī-Tiān* (the governing Heavenly phase), Earth refers to the *Quan* (Spring). When the **qi** of governing Heaven or Earth is excessive, counter its flavor to treat it. When the **qi** of governing Heaven or Earth is deficient, follow its flavor to harmonize it. *From* means *follow*.

Hence it is said: *Upper* and *lower* supplementation, *inner* and *outer* treatment, are all used to seek out excesses. Those who can withstand poisons should be treated with strong medicine; those who cannot should be treated with mild medicine. This is the principle.

*Upper* supplementation refers to using medicine to subdue excessive **qi** in Heaven, restraining it without following its nature, which may lead to vomiting. *Lower* supplementation refers to using rapid-acting medicine to expel lower ailments; if the attack does not remove the disease, then induce purgation. *Inner* supplementation refers to dietary and internal medicinal treatment, carefully adjusting for cold and heat. *Outer* supplementation refers to applying medicinal poultices to regulate the **qi** of the affected area.

If cold is present but heat should be treated, apply cooling medicine; if heat is present but cold should be treated, apply warming medicine. If upper **qi** is excessive, induce vomiting to relieve it; if lower **qi** is excessive, induce purgation to deplete it—this is the way to seek out the **qi**’s excess.

The strength of medicine refers to the thickness or thinness of its flavors. *○ Newly corrected:* According to the *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng* (Canon of A and B), those with thick stomachs, black complexion, large bones, and abundant flesh all withstand poisons. The thin and frail-stomached cannot withstand poisons. Additionally, the *Yì-Fǎ Fāng-Yí Lùn* (Treatise on Appropriate Prescriptions for Diverse Regions) states: The people of the Western regions live in elevated dwellings and are exposed to much wind. Their water and soil are harsh, they wear coarse, unrefined clothing, and consume rich, fatty foods. Thus, pathogenic influences cannot harm their physical forms, and their diseases arise internally, so their treatments should use strong, poisonous medicines.

For diseases with reversed **qi**:
- If the disease is in the upper body, treat with lower supplementation;
- If the disease is in the lower body, treat with upper supplementation;
- If the disease is in the middle, treat with adjacent supplementation.

*Lower* supplementation refers to cold being reversed in the lower body, while heat attacks from above. If warmth is not beneficial for the lower body and **qi** is excessive in the upper body, then warm the lower body to regulate it. *Upper* supplementation refers to cold accumulating in the lower body, and warming not removing it, with insufficient *Yang* hidden within. Then supplement its *Yang*. *Adjacent* supplementation refers to **qi** converging on the left side, so applying medicine to the right side to harmonize it; if **qi** converges on the right side, then apply medicine to the left. Adjust according to the cold or heat of the disease.

These seven methods ensure that the disease has no escape, and when applied correctly, they strike the mark—this is the art of perfect treatment.

To treat heat with cold, apply cooling medicine; to treat cold with heat, apply warming medicine; to treat warmth with clarity, apply cooling medicine; to treat clarity with warmth, apply heating medicine. **Qi** has rigid and yielding natures, symptoms have light and heavy manifestations, prescriptions have large and small applications, and adjustments involve cold and warm treatments.»

When the disease is **qi**-replete and robust, one follows its nature to treat it; when it is slight and yielding, one counteracts its nature to subdue it. If the **qi** is divergent, the governing *zang*-organ cannot contain it; if the strength is doubled, attack it decisively with #23. This is the method of decoctions and drinks in regulating **qi**.

○The newly corrected text states: According to *The Treatise on the Most True and Great Principles*, "Heat is treated with cold, cold with heat; the *zang*-organ’s pathology is suppressed while the root cause is addressed first. Though their beginnings may align, their ends diverge, yet they can break accumulations, dissolve hardness, harmonize **qi**, and resolve the disease. Thus, the methods of purging, emesis, supplementation, and drainage apply equally to both new and chronic ailments. Measure the **qi**’s excess or deficiency and act accordingly—duration of illness does not alter the principle.

The Emperor asked: *"If a disease lies within but is neither solid nor fixed, now gathering, now dispersing, how should it be treated?"*

Gebi replied: *"Your question is profound! For those without accumulation, seek the affected *zang*-organ. If it is deficient, supplement it. Follow the disease’s location and prescribe organ-specific supplementation. Use medicine to guide it, and food to reinforce it. Feed with non-toxic medicines, administer decoctions in sequence to drive it out completely. Harmonize internally and externally with water and decoctions, and the disease will fully resolve. When inner and outer harmony is achieved, **qi** flows unimpeded, and the condition naturally dissipates, with true **qi** restoring balance."*

The Emperor asked: *"Are there guidelines for toxic and non-toxic medicines?"*

Gebi replied: *"Illnesses vary in duration, prescriptions in scale, and medicines in toxicity—these must always be measured. Great-toxicity medicines treat disease, removing six-tenths of its strength; inferior-grade toxic medicines are the most poisonous. Moderate-toxicity medicines remove seven-tenths; middle-grade medicines rank below the inferior. Mild-toxicity medicines remove eight-tenths; superior-grade toxic medicines are the least poisonous. Non-toxic medicines remove nine-tenths. Superior, middle, and inferior non-toxic medicines are all called *hu*#25. Grains, meats, fruits, and vegetables—use them for nourishment without excess, lest they harm the true **qi**. Great-toxicity medicines are fierce in nature, causing much harm; mild-toxicity medicines are gentle, causing little. Moderate-toxicity medicines lie between great and mild in effect, and their harm is thus discernible. Therefore, adhere strictly to the prescribed limits and await further signs.

Yet even non-toxic medicines, though mild, if taken excessively or for too long, may cause **qi** to become imbalanced—either overabundant or depleted. Prolonged use weakens the *zang*-organs, leaving them exhausted and unable to endure further strain. Hence, the rule: remove nine-tenths and stop. Once the prescribed dose is complete, nourish with the five grains, five meats, five fruits, and five vegetables suited to the *zang*-organs. If residual disease remains, combine medicine and diet as needed.

○The newly corrected text states: According to *The Treatise on the Laws of Organ Qi*, ‘Toxic medicines attack pathogens; grains nourish, fruits assist, livestock benefit, and vegetables fill. If the disease persists, repeat the method. The method refers to the four prior prescriptions. If the disease remains, apply the treatment again, adjusting toxicity as needed without overuse. One must first consider seasonal **qi**, never countering the natural harmony. The six seasonal **qi** govern in turn, with their influence manifesting in the front (south) or back (north). Know where each of the six **qi** resides, and observe how they correspond to the pulse at the wrist, cubit, and inch positions. When *Taiyin* dominates, the pulse is deep; when *Shaoyin* dominates, it is hooked; when *Jueyin* dominates, it is taut. When *Taiyang* dominates, the pulse is large and long; when *Yangming* dominates, it is short and rough; when *Shaoyang* dominates, it is large and floating. These six pulses are the *tianhe* (heavenly harmony). If one fails to recognize them, one calls them merely ‘cold’ or ‘heat.’ Attacking cold to induce heat, or heat to induce cold, without pulse transformation, will generate disease—either heat or cold—while the original condition persists. To seek balance is impossible. Thus, premature death arises from such errors.

Do not over-replete the replete, nor over-deplete the deficient, lest you bring calamity upon others. Failing to discern deficiency and excess, attacking only, will worsen the replete and deplete the deficient. A myriad of diseases will thus intensify, true **qi** will dwindle, and the illness will advance, bringing suffering and untimely death—an inescapable tragedy! Avoid inviting pathogens and losing the true **qi**; this is the path to longevity. Attacking the deficient as if it were excess is to invite pathogens. Ignoring an organ’s deficiency is to lose the true **qi**. Once **qi** is extinguished#27, death follows inevitably."

The Emperor asked: *"For chronic illnesses where **qi** remains unstable, the disease departs but leaves the body emaciated—how should this be treated?"* (Here, *from* means ‘in accordance with’.)

Gebi replied: *"Your question is enlightened! A sage’s inquiry. Transformation cannot be forced, nor time defied. To usurp the Master Carpenter’s craft harms even his hands—how much more so to counter natural transformation with human force? Growth, decline, storage, and concealment each follow the seasons’ rhythms. Even the most skilled cannot alter their timing; this is beyond human power. Thus, the rise, fall, order, and chaos of all things depend on their season. If humans were to claim control over such forces, defying nature and the seasons, they would be deluded.

The meridians must flow freely, and **qi** must follow its course. Restore deficiencies to align with others, nourish and harmonize, and in stillness await the right time. Guard the **qi** carefully, preventing imbalance, and vitality will flourish. This is the way of the sage-king. Hence, *The Great Overview* states: ‘Do not counter transformation, do not defy the seasons. Nourish and harmonize, and await restoration.’"*

This is what is meant.

The Yellow Emperor said, *"Excellent. The *Great Overview* is the essential teaching of the Highest Antiquity. It draws upon the core principles of antiquity to illuminate that the Dao of seasons and transformation cannot be defied, nor can human force substitute for it."*

**Volume 44 of *Huangdi Neijing Suwen* (Supplementary Commentary)**
Annotated by Tang *Taipu Ling* Xī Xuānzǐ Wáng Bīng, revised by Song *Guànglùqīng* Zhí Mìguān Lín Yì et al., and corrected by Song *Shǒushùshàngshū* *Túntiánláng* Sūn Zhào. Errors have been rectified.

**Chapter 44: *Lùyuán Zhèngjì Dàlùn* (Upper Section)**

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"The Six Transformations and Six Changes—how their excesses and corrections alternate, and the sequential order of sweet, bitter, sour, salty, and bland—these I understand. Yet the transformations of the Five Movements sometimes align with the Five *Qi*, sometimes oppose the Heavenly *Qi*, sometimes align with Heavenly *Qi* while opposing Earthly *Qi*, sometimes align with Earthly *Qi* while opposing Heavenly *Qi*, sometimes harmonize, and sometimes do not. I do not yet grasp their principles. I wish to comprehend Heaven’s cycles, follow Earth’s patterns, regulate their movements, and harmonize their transformations—so that above and below unite in virtue, none overstep their order, and Heaven and Earth ascend and descend without failing their due. When the Five Movements circulate freely, let no policy contradict them. How should one adjust their proper flavors, whether in alignment or opposition?"*

*"When *qi* is alike, it is called alignment; when *qi* differs, it is called opposition. Victory and suppression constitute non-harmony, while generation constitutes harmony. The Heavenly and Earthly *qi* alternate in excess, victory, and correction—each has its governing principles and methods. To balance and regulate *qi*’s nature, one must not violate the inherent *qi* of Heaven and Earth, thus attaining purity, tranquility, and harmony."*

Qibo bowed twice, kneeling, and replied:
*"Illuminating indeed is your question! This is the fundamental order of Heaven and Earth, the source of all transformations. Who but a sage-emperor could exhaust its ultimate truths? Though I am unworthy, I shall expound its Dao, ensuring it endures without fading, enduring yet unchanging. *Qi* follows cycles, akin to Heaven and Earth—excess and deficiency are its constant sequence. If one does not speak of fixed, eternal laws, then over time, it will shift. As ages drift from the sage, how else shall it be clarified?"*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"I wish you would expound it systematically, following its categories, dividing its governing sectors, distinguishing its primary overseers, revealing its *qi* cycles, and clarifying its proper transformations. May I hear this?*

*"Governing sectors" refers to the division of the Six *Qi*’s dominions.
*"Primary overseers"* refers to the correspondence of the Five *Qi*’s movements in their appointed positions.
*"Qi cycles"* refers to the regular sequence of Heaven and Earth’s Five Movements in their cyclical operations.
*"Proper transformations"* refers to the seasonal *qi*’s appropriate flavors—sour, bitter, sweet, salty, bland—and their cold, cool, warm, and hot natures."

Qibo said:
*"First, establish the year’s configuration to clarify its *qi*. The sequential movements of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth, and the transformations of cold, heat, dryness, dampness, wind, and fire as they govern—then Heaven’s Dao becomes visible, and human *qi* can be regulated. The unfolding and contracting of yin and yang, when near, leave no confusion. Of the *qi* that can be counted, let me now exhaustively speak."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How does the governance of the Great Yang [Taiyang] proceed?"*

Qibo replied: *"It is the governance of the *chén-wèi* [辰戌] sequence. The Great Yang, Great Angle [太角], Great Yin [太阴], *Rén-chén* [壬辰], *Rén-wèi* [壬戌]—its *qi* governs wind, its transformations are clamor, tumult, and disruption. Its variations are trembling, collapse, and uprooting. Its diseases are dizziness, falling, and blindness of the eyes.

The Great Angle: *Initial Zheng* [初正], *Minor Zheng* [少征], *Great Official* [太官], *Minor Shang* [少商], *Great Feather* [太羽]—*terminal*.

The Great Yang, Great Zheng [太征], Great Yin [太阴], *Wù-chén* [戊辰], *Wù-wèi* [戊戌]—*Zheng* and *Initial Zheng* coincide. Its *qi* governs heat, its transformations are sultry warmth, oppressive heat, and steaming. Its variations are blazing, boiling, and seething. Its diseases are heat stagnation.

The Great Zheng: *Minor Official* [少宫], *Great Shang* [太商], *Minor Feather* [少羽]—*terminal*, *Minor Angle* [少角]—*initial*.

The Great Yang, Great Official [太宫], Great Yin [太阴], *Jiǎ-chén* [甲辰]—*Yearly Assembly* [岁会] aligning with *Heaven’s Sympathy* [天符]; *Jiǎ-wèi* [甲戌]—*Yearly Assembly* aligning with *Heaven’s Sympathy*. Its *qi* governs *yin* dust, its transformations are gentle, moist, and abundant. Its variations are trembling, startling, gusting, and sudden. Its diseases are dampness, with heaviness below.

The Great Official: *Minor Shang* [少商], *Great Feather* [太羽]—*terminal*, *Great Angle* [太角]—*initial*, *Minor Zheng* [少征].

The Great Yang, Great Shang [太商], Great Yin [太阴], *Gēng-chén* [庚辰], *Gēng-wèi* [庚戌]. Its *qi* governs coolness, its transformations are mist, dew, and briskness. Its variations are stern, withering, and decay. Its diseases are dryness, with back dimness and chest fullness.

The Great Shang: *Minor Feather* [少羽]—*terminal*, *Minor Angle* [少角]—*initial*, *Great Zheng* [太征], *Minor Official* [少宫].

The Great Yang, Great Feather [太羽]. Its *qi* governs cold, its transformations are congealing, bleak, and piercing. Its variations are ice, snow, frost, and hail. Its diseases are severe cold lingering in valleys.

The Great Feather—*terminal*, *Great Angle* [太角]—*initial*, *Minor Zheng* [少征], *Great Official* [太官], *Minor Shang* [少商].

All these are the governance of the Great Yang’s *Heavenly Stem* [司天], where the *qi* and transformations unfold in advance of the seasons. The six stages of *qi*—generation, growth, transformation, completion, withdrawal, and storage—all align with the *Heavenly Stem* in their due order. Other years follow this *Heavenly Stem* sequence as well.

When the *Heavenly Stem* is austere, the *Earthly Branch* is tranquil. Cold descends upon the void, and *yang qi* does not prevail. Water and Earth harmonize in virtue, corresponding above to the *Chen* and *Zhen* stars.

Its grains are black and yellow. Its governance is austere, its decrees measured. When cold governance is severe, without *yang* brilliance, fire awaits its time. If cold is extreme, fire stagnates, awaiting the four seasons before erupting in sudden heat.

When the *Minor Yang* [少阳] governs in moderation, timely rains cease, and excessive dampness disperses, returning to the Great Yin. Clouds gather toward the North Pole—the *Rain Palace*—and dampness spreads. Dew nourishes all things, cold descends from above, and thunder stirs below. Cold and damp *qi* persist at the *qi* exchange.

The year’s great changes are thus.

The people suffer from cold and dampness, with muscles atrophying, feet withering and failing to contract, and blood oozing and overflowing.

At the first *qi*, the *Earthly Branch* shifts, and warmth becomes great—*fearful of fire’s onset*. Grass blooms early, the people grow restless, and warm diseases arise: fever, headache, vomiting, and muscular sores. Red patches appear—this is *skin’s victory* over sores, occurring beneath the skin.

At the second *qi*, great cold returns, the people grow bleak, grass encounters cold, and fire *qi* is suppressed. The people suffer from *qi* stagnation and abdominal fullness, and cold begins.

The *qi* of cold and dampness, having descended, reverses to the *Earthly Branch* of the year, thus the *qi* of cold begins to approach the people.

The third *qi*: the *Heavenly Stem* is spread, the *qi* of cold moves, and rain descends. The people suffer from cold, yet their inner warmth surges, causing paralysis and carbuncles to flow downward. Their hearts grow hot and oppressed, and if left untreated, they die. When cold reverses to heat, this defies the natural order—heat arising from the heart endangers the spirit (*shen*). If not urgently aided, the spirit (*shen*) will wither and perish, hence those treated survive, while the untreated die.

The fourth *qi*: the *Way* of wind and dampness contend. Wind transforms into rain, and thus it grows, changes, and matures. The people suffer from great heat and weak *qi*, with atrophied muscles and withered feet, and their fluids flow downward in red and white.

The fifth *qi*: the *yang* energy revives and transforms, grass grows, and thus it changes and matures. The people find relief. The great fire presides, so all things flourish and expand.

The final *qi*: the *Earthly Branch* aligns, dampness is released, and *yin* congeals in the boundless void (*Tai Xu*). Dust obscures the fields, and the people grow bleak and weary. Cold winds arrive, and those who resist will perish in childbirth.

Thus, the year requires austerity to dryness, warmth, and moderation.

**Correction Note:** *"Thus, the year requires austerity to dryness, warmth, and moderation"* should be placed under *"Avoid the empty evils to stabilize its proper order"* (避虚邪以安其正), as the text here is misplaced. The *Way* must be bent to release its stagnation, and first, its transformative source must be nourished.

**Transformative Source** (*Hua Yuan*): This refers to the ninth month, when one draws upon its energy to supplement the heart’s fire.

**Correction Note:** *"When water’s energy is about to prevail, one must first, in the ninth month, draw upon its transformative source to replenish the kidney’s essence."* Water’s reign is in the tenth month, so its energy is drawn in the ninth to temper it and thus supplement fire.

To suppress its movement (*qi*), to aid what cannot prevail—
When the *Great Angle* (*Tai Jiao*) year, the *spleen* cannot prevail;
When the *Great Zheng* (*Tai Zheng*) year, the *lung* cannot prevail;
When the *Great Guan* (*Tai Guan*) year, the *kidney* cannot prevail;
When the *Great Shang* (*Tai Shang*) year, the *liver* cannot prevail;
When the *Great Yu* (*Tai Yu*) year, the *heart* cannot prevail.
Such is the year’s proper alignment.

Yet the *Great Yang* (*Tai Yang*) presides over the *Heavenly Stem* for five years, and its general alignment is to first assist the heart, then support the kidney’s *qi*. Do not let its excesses violently overwhelm and generate illness. Consume the year’s grains to preserve its vital essence, avoid the empty evils to stabilize its proper order.

When wood is excessive, the *spleen* falls ill;
When fire is excessive, the *lung* falls ill;
When earth is excessive, the *kidney* falls ill;
When metal is excessive, the *liver* falls ill;
When water is excessive, the *heart* falls ill.
The same holds true when the *Heavenly Stem* and *Earthly Branch* energies are excessive.

**Year’s Grains** (*Sui Gu*): These are yellow and black grains.
**Empty Evils** (*Xu Xie*): These are winds that surge from the *Chong* meridian.

In moderating *qi*—whether similar or different—adjust the proportions.
If aligned with cold and dampness, use drying and warming methods;
If opposed to cold and dampness, use drying and dampness methods.

For the *Great Guan*, *Great Shang*, and *Great Yu* years—aligned with cold and dampness—drying and warming methods are appropriate.
For the *Great Angle* and *Great Zheng* years—opposing cold and dampness—drying and dampness methods are appropriate.

Thus, when aligned, apply more; when opposed, apply less.
More refers to drying and warming;
Less refers to drying and dampness.
The use of cold, cool, warm, and heat must be adjusted according to the year’s *qi*.

If one uses cold in a cold year, cool in a cool year, warm in a warm year, or heat in a hot year, this aligns with the natural order. If one does the opposite, illness arises—this is called *timing* (*shi*).

**Timing** (*shi*) refers to the seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, as well as the *qi* of the intermediate periods. If aligned, one must avoid it, even if it is the season.

If the six *qi* preside and one uses warming, cooling, or dampness to treat illness, then do not avoid it. For example, in the *Great Yang* (*Tai Yang*) year, if cold is the illness, one may use heat to treat it—then the heat need not be avoided in summer. The same applies to the other *qi*.

Thus, it is said: *"There are instances where one must act contrary to the natural order."*

Food must follow the same principles as medicine.

**Correction Note:** *"The methods of using cold to avoid cold, and the instances where one must act contrary to the natural order, are fully detailed below."*

The Emperor said: *"Excellent."*

Now, what of the *Yangming* (*Bright Yang*) year’s alignment?

Guanzi replied: *"It follows the *Earthly Branch* of *Mao* (卯) and *You* (酉)."*

In the *Yangming* year,
**Minor Angle** (*Shao Jiao*) and **Minor Yin** (*Shao Yan*)—cooling and drying prevail, aligning with warmth and suppression.
**Minor Zheng** (*Shao Zheng*)—cooling and drying prevail, aligning with warmth and suppression.

**Correction Note:** *"The *Heavenly Stem* of *Yangming* aligns with the *Earthly Branch* of *Mao* and *You*, and its *qi* is wind, cooling, and drying. When the energy is insufficient, it is said to combine with the suppressed and drying *qi*. Wind is the *qi* of the year; cooling is the prevailing *qi*; and warmth is the suppressed *qi*. The rest of the minor *qi* are all the same.*

**Minor Angle** (*Shao Jiao*) begins—**Great Zheng** (*Tai Zheng*)—**Minor Guan** (*Shao Guan*)—**Great Shang** (*Tai Shang*)—**Minor Yu** (*Shao Yu*) ends.

In the *Yangming* year,
**Minor Zheng** (*Shao Zheng*) and **Minor Yin** (*Shao Yan*)—cold and rain prevail, aligning with warmth and suppression.
**Minor Guan** (*Shao Guan*)—**Great Shang** (*Tai Shang*)—**Minor Yu** (*Shao Yu*) ends—**Minor Angle** (*Shao Jiao*) begins—**Great Zheng** (*Tai Zheng*).

In the *Yangming* year,
**Minor Guan** (*Shao Guan*) and **Minor Yin** (*Shao Yan*)—wind and coolness prevail, aligning with warmth and suppression.
**Minor Guan** (*Shao Guan*)—**Great Shang** (*Tai Shang*)—**Minor Yu** (*Shao Yu*) ends—**Minor Angle** (*Shao Jiao*) begins—**Great Zheng** (*Tai Zheng*).

In the *Yangming* year,
**Minor Shang** (*Shao Shang*) and **Minor Yin** (*Shao Yan*)—cold and heat prevail, aligning with warmth and suppression.
**Minor Shang** (*Shao Shang*)—**Great Guan** (*Tai Guan*)—**Minor Yu** (*Shao Yu*) ends—**Minor Angle** (*Shao Jiao*) begins—**Great Zheng** (*Tai Zheng*).

**Correction Note:** *"According to the *Great Treatise on the Five Constant Regulations*, it states: 'The *Earthly Branch* of *Wei* (委) and *He* (和) aligns with the *Heavenly Stem* of *Shang* (商), and the *Earthly Branch* of *Shang* aligns with the *Heavenly Stem* of *Shang*.' In the *Earthly Branch* of *Ren* (丁) and *You* (酉), the year’s *qi* is wind, cooling, and drying. When the energy is insufficient, it is said to combine with the suppressed and drying *qi*."*

**Correction Note:** *"According to the *Great Treatise on the Heavenly Elements*, it states: 'Three alignments form the regulation.' Also, the *Great Treatise on the Six Minor Essences* states: 'Heavenly alignment and year’s *qi* are called *Great Heavenly Alignment* (*Tai Tian Fu*).'"**

**Wang Bing says:** This is called the *Three Harmonies*—first, *Heavenly Harmony*; second, *Yearly Harmony*; third, *Running Harmony*. Some say that in this year, the *Three Harmonies* are all *Great Heavenly Harmony* (*Tai Tian Fu*), and thus should not also be called *Yearly Harmony*—this is utterly incorrect. *Yearly Harmony* is indeed *Yearly Harmony*, and the name *Yearly Harmony* cannot be discarded.

Some say, *"Why do not the years of *Jǐ Chǒu* (己丑), *Jǐ Wèi* (己未), and *Wù Wǔ* (戊午) speak of *Yearly Harmony* but only mention *Great Heavenly Harmony*?"* This is like citing one corner without considering the other three—if one is known, the other three are implied. To omit it would mean *Great Heavenly Harmony* alone, not *Yearly Harmony*. Thus, it cannot be discarded.

Its *running qi* is freezing and hot, cold and warm.
**Minor Shang**, **Great Zhui** (羽终), **Great Jing** (角初), **Minor Zheng** (征), **Great Gong** (宫)
**Yangming**, **Minor Shang**, **Minor Yin**—rain and wind prevail, and the excess and return are the same, aligning with **Minor Gong**.

**Xīn Jiāozhèng says:** According to the *Great Treatise on the Five Constant Regulations*, when the *Five Movements* are insufficient, apart from the regular *Jing*, *Shang*, and *Gong*, in the years *Guǐ Chǒu* (癸丑) and *Guǐ Wèi* (癸未), it should say *"Minor Zheng and Minor Zhui are the same."* In *Jǐ Mǎo* (己卯) and *Jǐ Yǒu* (己酉), *"Minor Gong and Minor Jing are the same."* In *Yǐ Chǒu* (乙丑) and *Yǐ Wèi* (乙未), *"Minor Shang and Minor Zheng are the same."* In *Xīn Mǎo* (辛卯), *Xīn Yǒu* (辛酉), *Xīn Sì* (辛巳), and *Xīn Hài* (辛亥), *"Minor Zhui and Minor Gong are the same."* This makes ten years in total.

Now, this treatise alone speaks of *"Minor Gong being the same"* because *Guǐ Chǒu*, *Guǐ Wèi*, and *Chǒu Wèi* are Earth, so it does not additionally say *"Minor Zhui is the same."* *Jǐ Mǎo* and *Jǐ Yǒu* are Metal, so it does not additionally say *"Minor Jing is the same."* *Xīn Sì* and *Xīn Hài* are Wood, so it does not additionally say *"Minor Gong is the same."* *Yǐ Chǒu* and *Yǐ Wèi*—later, the *Great Yang* is Water—so it does not additionally say *"Minor Zheng is the same."* Apart from these eight years, only *Xīn Yǒu* (辛酉) and *Xīn Mǎo* (辛卯) are years where *"Minor Zhui and Minor Gong are the same."*

**Xīn Yǒu, Xīn Mǎo**—its *running qi* is cold and rainy, windy.
**Minor Zhui** (终), **Minor Jing** (角初), **Great Zheng**, **Minor Gong**, **Great Shang**

All this pertains to the governance of *Yangming* ruling Heaven, with *qi* transformations running in accordance with the *Post-Heaven*. The six stages of *qi*—generation, growth, transformation, and completion—all movements of affairs, both dynamic and static, respond to the *Post-Heaven* timing. The remaining years share the same *Minor* alignment.

Heavenly *qi* is urgent, Earthly *qi* is clear; *Yang* dominates its mandate, scorching heat prevails, things dry and harden, pure winds bring order, and wind-dryness spreads through *qi* exchanges. With excessive *Yang* and deficient *Yin*, clouds rush toward the *Rain Bureau*, and dampness spreads. The *Rain Bureau* is where *Tai Yin* resides.

When dryness reaches its extreme, it transforms into dew—this is the division of the *Three Qi*. Its grains are white *Dān* (丹), born from the true *qi* of Heaven and Earth.

As for *interval grains* (*jiàn gǔ*), those marked *"Great"*—such as the *Great Jing*, *Shang*, etc.—refer to the transformations of *qi* mentioned earlier. Since they arise from *qi* transformations, they are called *interval grains*.

○ **Xīn Jiāozhèng says:** According to the *Mysterious Pearl* (*Xuán Zhū*), what are *year grains* and *interval grains*? These are the grains found in the spring (*zài quán*), and those found beside the spring on either side are also called *year grains*. Those that govern Heaven and the *running qi* while transforming are named *interval grains*. There is another kind of *interval grain*—when Earthly transformations are insufficient, it counteracts its conquered element to produce them, hence the name *interval grain*. This is also the transformation of perverse *qi*, called *convergent transformation grains*, also named *interval grains*. This differs from Wang’s annotation.

Its disasters consume white *jiǎ* (甲) and feathered creatures (*pín yǔ*), white-colored insects, and feathered species multiply and decline in abundance, while armored creatures (*jiǎ bīng*) bring calamity, depleting all things. Metal and Fire combine in virtue, corresponding above to *Tai Bai* (Tai White) and *Xīnghuò* (Mars). When seen as large and bright, its governance is strict, its mandate sudden. Hibernating creatures appear, flowing water does not freeze.

The people suffer from coughing, throat blockage, alternating cold and heat, sudden shivering, *liàn* (癃, urinary retention) and *shì* (閟, urinary difficulty), with cold first and then heat, strong and violent. Feathered creatures die, armored creatures suffer. When the onset is sudden, the excess and return of *qi* clash violently, causing great disorder. Metal first prevails, Wood has already suffered harm, hence feathered creatures die. Fire prevails later, Metal cannot resist, hence armored creatures suffer again. When prevailing, it executes its killing—feathered creatures are already gone, the returning *qi* comes later, the strong then rebel—is this not the great disorder of *qi*?

The cold-heat *qi* lingers at the *qi* exchange. In the first stage, Earthly *qi* shifts, *Yin* begins to condense, *qi* becomes austere, water freezes, and cold rain transforms. Its diseases include internal heat and distension, facial and orbital swelling, excessive sleepiness, sighing and restlessness, sneezing and yawning, vomiting, and yellowish or bloody urine, severe enough to cause *lín* (淋, dysuria).

This is the transformation of *Tai Yin*.

○ **Xīn Jiāozhèng says:** Upon closer inspection, when *qi* becomes austere and water freezes, this is not the transformation of *Tai Yin*.

In the second stage, *Yang* spreads, the people relax, and things flourish. Sudden deaths occur—this is because the minister’s position is beneath the sovereign’s.

In the third stage, Heaven’s governance spreads, coolness prevails, dryness and heat combine, and at the extreme of dryness, dew forms. The people suffer from alternating cold and heat—this is *malaria*.

In the fourth stage, cold rain falls, causing sudden collapse, shivering, delirium, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and thirst. It may also cause heart pain, paralysis, swelling, sores, malaria-like cold, and *bone atrophy* (骨痿) with bloody stools.

In the fifth stage, the spring order reverses, grass flourishes, and the people’s *qi* harmonizes.

In the terminal stage, *Yang qi* spreads, the season reverses to warmth, hibernating creatures emerge, flowing water does not freeze, and the people find peace. Its diseases are fevers—this is the sovereign’s transformation.

Thus, one should eat *year grains* to stabilize one’s *qi*, eat *interval grains* to dispel perverse influences. The year’s suitability lies in *salty*, *bitter*, and *pungent* flavors—through sweating, clearing, and dispersing, one stabilizes the *running qi*, preventing it from receiving perverse influences, and relieves stagnant *qi*, nourishing the source of transformation.

The source of transformation—this refers to welcoming and taking it in the sixth month. ○The newly corrected text states: According to the *Jin* sovereign’s seventh month, thus welcoming the *Jin* qi in the sixth month. Adjusting by cold and heat, lightness and heaviness, scarcity and abundance in its governance:

When aligned with heat, it draws more from Heaven’s transformation;
When aligned with clarity, it draws more from Earth’s transformation.
In years of scarce *Jiao* and scarce *Zheng*, when aligned with heat, prescriptions should primarily use Heaven’s clear transformation.
In years of scarce *Guān*, scarce *Shang*, and scarce *Yǔ*, when aligned with clarity, prescriptions should primarily use Earth’s warm transformation.
Fire resides on Earth, hence alignment with clarity yields more Earth’s transformation.
Metal resides in Heaven, hence alignment with heat yields more Heaven’s transformation.

When using coolness, avoid excessive coolness;
When using warmth, avoid excessive warmth;
When using coldness, avoid excessive coldness;
When using mildness, avoid excessive mildness—
Diet should follow the same principle.

If there are anomalies, reverse the approach—
This is the Dao.
Reversing disrupts Heaven and Earth’s order,
Disturbs *Yin* and *Yang*’s rhythms.

The Emperor said: Excellent.
How does the governance of *Shǎo-Yáng* proceed?

Gǐ Bó replied:
It follows the *Yín-Shēn* cycle. *Shǎo-Yáng*’s *Tài-Jiǎo*:
○The newly corrected text states: According to *The Grand Treatise on the Five Constants’ Governance*, "When *Zheng* ascends, its qi reverses."
*Jué-Yīn* aligns with *Rén-Yín* and *Rén-Shēn*—both in Heavenly resonance—
its movement stirs the wind.
○The newly corrected text states: Detailed in the convergence of wind and fire, hence its movement stirs the wind.
*Shǎo-Yīn* governs Heaven, and *Tài-Jiǎo*’s movement aligns accordingly.
Its transformation: *wū-sù* opens and breaks.
○The newly corrected text states: According to *The Grand Treatise on the Five Constants’ Governance*, "Its virtue: *wū-mǐ* opens and breaks."
Its changes: *zhèn-lā* shatter and pluck.
Its diseases: vertigo, limb numbness, and terror.

*Tài-Jiǎo*’s initial phase—*Shǎo-Zheng*—*Tài-Guān*—*Shǎo-Shāng*—*Tài-Yǔ* concludes.

*Shǎo-Yáng*’s *Tài-Zheng*:
○The newly corrected text states: According to *The Grand Treatise on the Five Constants’ Governance*, "When *Zheng* ascends, it collects *Qi* and brings disaster."
*Jué-Yīn*—*Wù-Yín*—*Wù-Shēn*—both in Heavenly resonance—
its movement brings summer.
Its transformation: *xuān-ráo* oppressive and sultry.
○The newly corrected text states: According to *The Grand Treatise on the Five Constants’ Governance*, it reads: *xuān-shǔ* oppressive and sultry.
This change—summer turning to *ráo*—occurs because it governs *Shǎo-Yáng*.
Its changes: blazing heat, boiling turbulence.
Its diseases: upper heat oppression, blood overflow, blood discharge, and heart pain.

*Tài-Zheng*—*Shǎo-Guān*—*Tài-Shāng*—*Shǎo-Yǔ* concludes—*Shǎo-Jiǎo* begins.

*Shǎo-Yáng*’s *Tài-Guān*:
*Jué-Yīn*—*Jiǎ-Yín*—*Jiǎ-Shēn*—both in Heavenly resonance—
its movement brings *yīn* rain.
Its transformation: gentle, moist, and heavy dew.
Its changes: trembling, gusts, and sudden squalls.
Its diseases: body heaviness, *bì-zhòng* (abdominal distension), edema, and dyspepsia.

*Tài-Guān*—*Shǎo-Shāng*—*Tài-Yǔ* concludes—*Shǎo-Jiǎo* begins.

*Shǎo-Yáng*’s *Tài-Shāng*:
*Jué-Yīn*—*Gēng-Yín*—*Gēng-Shēn*—both in Heavenly resonance, aligned with *Zhèng-Shāng*.
○The newly corrected text states: According to *The Grand Treatise on the Five Constants’ Governance*, "In the *Firm and Complete* cycle, when *Zheng* ascends, it aligns with *Zhèng-Shāng*."
Its movement brings frost.
Its transformation: mist and dew, crisp and sharp.
○The newly corrected text states: According to *The Grand Treatise on the Five Constants’ Governance*, it reads: "Mist and dew, *xiāo-yáng* (scattered and uplifted)."
Again, in *Dà-Shāng*’s three movements, two mention *xiāo-yáng*, but here it states *qīng-qiè* (clear and incisive).
Detailed below, as in *Jué-Yīn*, it should correspond to *xiāo-yáng*.
Its changes: stern desolation, withering, and decay.
Its diseases: shoulder, back, and chest afflictions.

*Tài-Shāng*—*Shǎo-Yǔ* concludes—*Shǎo-Jiǎo* begins—*Tài-Yǔ*—*Shǎo-Zheng*.

*Shǎo-Yáng*’s *Tài-Yǔ*:
*Jué-Yīn*—*Bǐng-Yín*—*Bǐng-Shēn*—
its movement brings cold severity.
○The newly corrected text states: Detailed here, this movement should not be called "cold severity," as it aligns with *Tài-Yáng*’s *Tài-Yǔ* movement in the notes.
Its transformation: congealed, grim, cold, and piercing.
○The newly corrected text states: According to *The Grand Treatise on the Five Constants’ Governance*, it reads: "Congealed, grim, cold, and *hán-líng* (freezing desolation)."
Its changes: ice, snow, frost, and hail.
Its diseases: cold, with floating edema.

*Tài-Yǔ* concludes—*Tài-Jiǎo* begins—*Shǎo-Zheng*—*Tài-Guān*—*Shǎo-Shāng*.

In all, the governance of *Shǎo-Yáng*’s Heavenly phase:
Its *Qi* and transformations move in advance of Heaven.
Heaven’s *Qi* is upright.
○The newly corrected text states: Detailed in *Shǎo-Yáng* governing Heaven and *Tài-Yīn* governing Earth, both attaining their uprightness.
Again, *Jué-Yīn* and *Shǎo-Yáng* govern Earth, each stating they attain their uprightness—
speaking of Earth’s role in nurturing flourishing.
The original text may have read "Heaven’s *Qi* ceases," but *Shǎo-Yáng*’s fiery nature is restless and impulsive—
the meaning of "cease" does not fit.
Earth’s *Qi* is disturbed, and wind rises violently—
trees bend, sand flies, flames spread, and *Yin* follows *Yang*’s transformation.
Rain responds in due course.
Fire and wood share virtue, corresponding above to *Míng* (Mars) and *Suì* (Jupiter).
They appear bright and vast.
○The newly corrected text states: Detailed in the Six *Qi*, only *Shǎo-Yáng* and *Jué-Yīn* governing Heaven and Earth harmonize above and below, without mutual conquest.
Thus, fire and wood share virtue.
The other *Qi* all have mutual conquest, hence they are said to "merge virtues."

Its grains are red and blue-green.
Its governance is strict, its decrees disruptive.
Thus, oppressive wind-heat spreads,
clouds and phenomena boil,
*Tài-Yīn* floods horizontally,
cold arrives in due season,
and frost and rain arise together.
The people suffer from cold invasion,
externally manifesting sores and ulcers,
internally causing diarrhea and distension.
Thus, the Sage, encountering this, harmonizes without contention.
The alternating phases bring diseases of cold, heat, malaria, and diarrhea,
deafness, dim vision, vomiting, and spitting.
Upper oppression, skin eruptions, and color changes.

In the initial phase, Earth’s *Qi* shifts,
wind prevails and shakes,
cold departs,
and the season becomes greatly warm.
Grass and trees flourish early.
Cold does not kill, and warm diseases arise.
Its diseases: *Qi* oppression above, blood overflow, red eyes,
coughing, inverted breathing, headache, *xuè-gāng* (blood clots),
flank distension, and skin ulcers in the center—
*Shǎo-Yīn*’s transformation.

In the second phase, fire is oppressed again—
due to *Tài-Yīn*’s division.
White dust rises in all directions,
clouds gather toward the rain chamber,
wind cannot overcome moisture,
rain falls in droplets,
and the people find peace.
Its diseases: upper heat oppression,
coughing, inverted breathing, vomiting,
ulcers in the center,
chest constriction and discomfort,
headache, body heat,
dizziness, delirium, and purulent sores.

In the third phase, Heaven’s governance spreads,
scorching summer arrives,
*Shǎo-Yáng* ascends above,
and rain recedes.

「The people suffer from inner heat—
deafness and blindness, blood overflow,
purulent sores, coughing, and vomiting,
*wǒ-niǔ* (a type of thirst), sneezing and yawning,
sore throat and red eyes,
prone to sudden death.

In the fourth phase, frost arrives—
scorching summer undergoes transformation,
white dew descends,
and the people’s *qi* becomes harmonious and peaceful.
Its diseases: a sense of heaviness throughout the body.

In the fifth phase, the *Yang* recedes,
cold comes, and rain falls.
The *qi* gates close.
*New annotation*: According to Wang’s commentary in *The Doctrine of Vital Breath Communicating with Heaven* (*Shēng-Qì Tōng-Tiān Lùn*): *Qi* gates are the *Xuán-Fǔ* (Mysterious Storehouse).
They serve as the pathways for the release of *Jīng* (Channel), *Fèn* (Vessel), *Róng* (Nutritive), and *Wèi* (Defensive) *qi*.
Thus, they are called *qi* gates.
The rigid trees wither early,
the people avoid cold pathogens,
and the virtuous ones act prudently.

In the final phase, Earth’s *qi* is upright,
wind arrives, and all things revive.
Mists drift and move.
Its diseases: *guān-bì* (a condition of restricted flow), heart pain,
and *Yang* *qi* failing to be contained, resulting in coughing.

Regarding the *qi*’s movement and its unchecked excess,
one must first suppress the oppressed *qi* by taking the *huà-yuán* (Transformation Source).
The *huà-yuán* is the twelve months before the current year—
approach and take from them.
*New annotation*: Examining Wang’s commentary on "taking the *huà-yuán*" and the *Zū* (Assist) commentary on "take":
their meanings vary across four categories:
*Tài-Yáng* (Great Yang) governs Heaven and takes the ninth month,
*Yáng-Míng* (Yang Brightness) governs Heaven and takes the sixth month—
these two are cases of taking the *qi* from Heaven first.
*Shǎo-Yáng* (Lesser Yang) governs Heaven and takes the twelve months before the year,
*Tài-Yīn* (Great Yin) governs Heaven and takes the ninth month—
these two involve taking the *qi* from Earth before its time.
*Shǎo-Yīn* (Lesser Yin) governs Heaven and takes the twelve months before the year,
*Jué-Yīn* (Extreme Yin) governs Heaven and takes the fourth month—
the meaning here remains unclear.
According to the *Xuán-Zhū* (*Mysterious Pearl*) doctrine, it differs:
the months for *Tài-Yáng* and *Yáng-Míng* align with Wang’s commentary,
while *Shǎo-Yáng* and *Shǎo-Yīn* both take the third month,
*Tài-Yīn* takes the fifth month,
and *Jué-Yīn* takes the twelve months before the year.
The *Xuán-Zhū*’s meaning is clear.
Wang’s months may contain errors.

When excess is not restrained, no life flourishes;
when *qi* is not moderated, severe illnesses do not arise.
*Kē* (severe) means *chóng* (excessive).
*New annotation*: This does not mention "food of the year" or "grain of the year,"
as the year’s *qi* is now balanced between Heaven and Earth,
and the upper and lower realms are in harmony,
so no mention is needed.

Thus, the year suits *saltiness*, *pungency*, and *sourness*;
to permeate and release,
to moisten and disperse—
adjust according to the *qi*’s cold or warmth.
For *Tài-Jiǎo* (Great First) and *Tài-Zhēng* (Great Second) years, the *qi* aligns with wind-heat,
so cold therapy should be applied more.
For *Tài-Guān* (Great Second), *Tài-Shāng* (Great Third), and *Tài-Yǔ* (Great Fourth) years,
the *qi* diverges from wind-heat,
so cool therapy should be used to adjust its excess.

Use heat to distance heat,
use warmth to distance warmth,
use cold to distance cold,
use frost to distance frost—
food should follow the same principle;
this is the Dao’s way.
To act contrary is the path to illness.

*Huáng-Dì Nèi-Jīng Sū-Wèn* (Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon – Plain Questions) supplementary annotated text, Volume 44, concludes.

*New annotation*: Original text had "知" (*zhī*, "know"), but corrected according to Gu’s version to "之" (*zhī*, "its/their").」

The body’s constitution follows the Dao’s patterns—
when the skin’s *qi* is excessive, it must be dispersed.
If it is deficient, it must be nourished and released.

When the *qi* aligns with cold and heat,
those in harmony should be treated more,
while those divergent should be treated less.
For *Tài-Wù* (Great Forty-Eighth) and *Tài-Zǐ* (Great Forty-Ninth) years,
the *qi* aligns with fire—
thus, cooling is applied more.
For *Tài-Yīn* (Great Fiftieth) and *Tài-Yáng* (Great Fifty-First) years,
the *qi* diverges from fire—
thus, warmth therapy adjusts its excess.

When the *qi* aligns with cold and heat,
those in harmony should be treated more,
while those divergent should be treated less.
For *Tài-Xū* (Great Fifty-Second) and *Tài-Wáng* (Great Fifty-Third) years,
the *qi* aligns with dampness—
thus, warmth is applied more.
For *Tài-Jué* (Great Fifty-Fourth) and *Tài-Gēng* (Great Fifty-Fifth) years,
the *qi* diverges from dampness—
thus, drying therapy adjusts its excess.

When the *qi* aligns with cold and heat,
those in harmony should be treated more,
while those divergent should be treated less.
For *Tài-Shēn* (Great Fifty-Sixth) and *Tài-Yǎng* (Great Fifty-Seventh) years,
the *qi* aligns with metal—
thus, moistening is applied more.
For *Tài-Xī* (Great Fifty-Eighth) and *Tài-Wù* (Great Fifty-Ninth) years,
the *qi* diverges from metal—
thus, drying therapy adjusts its excess.

When the *qi* aligns with cold and heat,
those in harmony should be treated more,
while those divergent should be treated less.
For *Tài-Yīn* (Great Sixtieth) and *Tài-Yáng* (Great Sixty-First) years,
the *qi* aligns with water—
thus, warmth is applied more.
For *Tài-Jué* (Great Sixty-Second) and *Tài-Zǐ* (Great Sixty-Third) years,
the *qi* diverges from water—
thus, cooling therapy adjusts its excess.

*Huáng-Dì Nèi-Jīng Sū-Wèn* (Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon – Plain Questions) supplementary annotated text, Volume 45, concludes.
Annotated by Tang *Tàipú-Lìng* (Grand Master of the Bureau of Horses) *Qǐ-Xuān Zǐ* Wáng Bīng, revised by Song *Guāng-Lǜ-Qīng* (Honorable Minister of Personnel) and *Mì-Gé* (Secretariat) Lín Yì, and corrected by Song *Shǒu-Shū* (Chief Minister) *Tún-Tián-Láng* (Magistrate of Imperial Farms) Sūn Zhào. Errors have been rectified.

「In the *Tài-Yuán Zhèng-Jì Dà-Lùn* (Great Treatise on the Regular Cycles of the Six Elements) of the *Huáng-Dì Nèi-Jīng Sū-Wèn* (Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon – Plain Questions),

The Emperor said: **#1** How does the *Tài-Yīn* (Great Sixtieth) year function?
Gē-Bó replied: It is the cycle of *Chǒu-Wèi* (Earth-Horse and Earth-Sheep).
When *Tài-Yīn* (Great Sixtieth) aligns with *Shǎo-Jué* (Minor First), and *Tài-Yáng* (Great Sixty-First) adjusts cooling and excess heat—**both** harmonize with the *Zhèng-Guān* (Regular Minister).
**New Correction:** According to the *Wǔ-Cháng Zhèng-Dà-Lùn* (Great Treatise on the Five Constants), the *Wěi-Hé* (Subdued Harmony) cycle has the *Shàng-Guān* (Upper Minister) and *Zhèng-Guān* (Regular Minister) in accord.
In the *Dīng-Chǒu* (Earth-Hen) and *Dīng-Wèi* (Earth-Sheep) years, the *qi* aligns with **wind-cooling** and **heat**.
*Shǎo-Jué* (Minor First) begins, *Tài-Zhēng* (Great Second), *Shǎo-Guān* (Minor Minister), *Tài-Shāng* (Great Third), and *Shǎo-Yǔ* (Minor Fourth) conclude—**then** *Tài-Yīn* (Great Sixtieth), *Shǎo-Zhēng* (Minor Second), and *Tài-Yáng* (Great Sixty-First) adjust **cold** and **rain**, harmonizing with the *Zhèng-Guān* (Regular Minister).
**New Correction:** According to the *Wǔ-Cháng Zhèng-Dà-Lùn* (Great Treatise on the Five Constants), the *Bēi-Jiān* (Low Vigilance) cycle has the *Shàng-Guān* (Upper Minister) and *Zhèng-Guān* (Regular Minister) in accord.
In the *Jǐ-Chǒu* (Earth-Dog) and *Jǐ-Wèi* (Earth-Sheep) years, the *qi* aligns with **cold-rain-wind**, harmonizing with the *Zhèng-Guān* (Regular Minister).
*Shǎo-Guān* (Minor Minister), *Tài-Shāng* (Great Third), *Shǎo-Yǔ* (Minor Fourth), and *Shǎo-Jué* (Minor First) conclude—**then** *Tài-Jué* (Great Second) and *Tài-Yīn* (Great Sixtieth) begin.
When *Tài-Yīn* (Great Sixtieth) aligns with *Shǎo-Shāng* (Minor Third) and *Tài-Yáng* (Great Sixty-First), the **rain-wind** adjusts excess and harmonizes with the *Zhèng-Guān* (Regular Minister).
**New Correction:** According to the *Wǔ-Cháng Zhèng-Dà-Lùn* (Great Treatise on the Five Constants), the *Hé-Liú* (Drought Flow) cycle has the *Shàng-Guān* (Upper Minister) and *Zhèng-Guān* (Regular Minister) in accord.
Some mistakenly regard these two years as the *Tóng-Suì Huì* (Converging Years of the Same Cycle), equating them to the **level water** phase, and wish to omit the phrase *"harmonizing with the Zhèng-Guān"* (同正官). This is incorrect.
These years hold **two meanings**, and omitting one is highly improper.
In the *Xīn-Chǒu* (Earth-Rat) and *Xīn-Wèi* (Earth-Sheep) years, the *Tóng-Suì Huì* (Converging Years of the Same Cycle) aligns with **cold-rain-wind**.
*Shǎo-Yǔ* (Minor Fourth) concludes, *Shǎo-Jué* (Minor First) begins, *Tài-Zhēng* (Great Second), *Shǎo-Guān* (Minor Minister), and *Tài-Shāng* (Great Third) follow.

**In all**, the *Tài-Yīn* (Great Sixtieth) governs the **celestial** cycles, while the *qi* transforms and flows through the **post-heaven** (earthly) phases.
All things grow, develop, and mature—**each** is formed by the **post-heaven** *qi* in due season.
When *Tài-Yīn* (Great Sixtieth) holds sway, the **Yang** *qi* recedes**, while great winds arise.
**New Correction:** Examining the *Tài-Yīn* (Great Sixtieth) cycle, why mention the **great winds**? Because *Jī-Yīn* (Minor First) is the **initial** *qi*, residing in the **wood** position, where **spring** *qi* prevails—**thus** winds come, and it is said that **great winds** arise.
When **celestial** *qi* descends and **terrestrial** *qi* ascends, mist shrouds the plains, and **white dust** (fine particulate) fills the air.
Clouds race toward the **Southern Pole**, and **cold rain** descends repeatedly—**things** mature in the **post-summer** (late summer).
The **Southern Pole** is the **rain domain**; **post-summer** refers to the ten days after the **Establishment of Autumn** (立秋).
The people suffer from **cold-dampness**, with **abdominal distension**, **body heaviness**, **irritability**, **edema**, **epigastric oppression**, **cold spasms**, and **tightness**.
When **cold** and **dampness** combine, **yellow-black turbidity** (hazy *qi*) arises—**as** the *qi* mingles, it corresponds to the **constellations of Zhènxīng** (镇星) and **Chénxīng** (辰星).
They appear **large and distinct**.
Its governance is **stern**, its command **silent**, and its **grains** (nourishment) are **bitter and dark**.
**Regular** *qi* forms and matures all things.
Thus, **cold** condenses above, and **cold** accumulates below—**when cold water** overcomes **fire**, it becomes **hail**, and **Yang** light cannot rectify it, so **killing** *qi* spreads.
**Yellow-black turbidity** is the **killing** *qi*, flowing from the **north** to the **west**, then to the **east** and **south**.
Therefore, if there is **excess**, treatment should be **elevated**; if **deficient**, treatment should be **lowered**.
If excess occurs **later**, treatment should be **delayed**; if deficient **earlier**, treatment should be **prompt**.
If there is **excess earth**, it is the **transformation of the** *qi*—**the people’s** *qi* follows accordingly.
To inquire about **grains**, one must emphasize the **abundance** (of *qi*).
In the **initial** *qi*, the **terrestrial** *qi* shifts—**thus** cold departs, and **spring** *qi* arrives.
**Thus** winds come, **nourishing** and **spreading** all things—**the people’s** *qi* becomes **uninhibited**, while **wind-dampness** intermingle, and **rain** follows.
The people suffer from **blood overflow**, **tightened sinews**, **stiff joints**, and **body heaviness**.
In the **second** *qi*, **great fire** prevails—**things** receive its transformation, and the people **harmonize**.
Its **diseases** are **heat** and **dampness**, with **excessive** *qi* **spreading far and wide**.
When **dampness** and **heat** intermingle, **rain** descends at **proper** times.
This is called **seasonal rain**, aligning with **heavenly** cycles and not **erring** from the **proper** seasons.
**New Correction:** Examining this, since *Shǎo-Yīn* (Minor First) governs the **sovereign fire** position, it is said that **great fire** prevails.

In the **third** *qi*, **heavenly** governance spreads—**dampness** descends, **terrestrial** *qi* ascends, and **rain** falls at **proper** times, **cold** following in its wake.
When **affected** by **cold-dampness**, the people suffer from **body heaviness**, **edema**, and **abdominal distension**.

In the **fourth** *qi*, **fear of fire** approaches—**dampness** and **heat** transform, **terrestrial** *qi* ascends, while **celestial** *qi* **blocks** and **separates**.
**Cold winds** arise at **dawn** and **dusk**, **dampness** and **heat** intermingle, and **grass and trees** **congeal** their **essence** (凝姻).
When **dampness** transforms but does not **flow**, **white dew** spreads, completing the **autumn** season.
All things **receive** this and **mature**.
The people suffer from **excessive heat**, **violent blood overflow**, **malaria**, and **epigastric distension**.
If severe, they develop **edema**.

In the **fifth** *qi*, the **stern** command has already been **executed**—**cold dew** descends, **frost** arrives **early**, **grass and trees** **yellow** and **fall**, and **cold** *qi* **penetrates** the **body**.
The **noble** (君子) **fortify** themselves, while the people suffer from **skin** diseases.
In the **final** *qi*, **great cold** **prevails**, **dampness** **fully** transforms, **frost** **accumulates**, and **Yīn** *qi* **congeals**, **water** **hardens** into **ice**.
**Yang** light cannot **rectify** it—**when affected** by **cold**, people **suffer** from **locked joints**, **lumbar stiffness**, and **pain**.
**Cold-dampness** **persists** in the **exchange** of *qi*, **becoming** disease.
**One must** **dispel** their **stagnant** *qi* and **seek** the **source of transformation** (化源).
The **source of transformation** is in the **ninth month**; **one must** **approach** it **closely** to **supplement** and **benefit**.
**Supplement** the **yearly** *qi*, preventing **evil** from **prevailing**.
**Consume** the **grains of the year** to **preserve** their **true essence** (真), and **grains of inquiry** (问谷) to **guard** their **vitality** (精).
Therefore, the **year** should be **treated** with **bitter-dry** and **warm** therapies; if severe, **induce** a **sweat** or **purge** it.
If not **induced** nor **purged**, **dampness** will **overflow** externally, **flesh** will **decay**, **skin** will **split**, and **water** and **blood** will **mingle** and **flow**.
**One must** **assist** the **Yang fire**, commanding it to **ward off** **extreme cold**.
In the **winter** division, **five steps** are applied—**this** is the **measurement** of *qi* for treatment.

The *qi* diverges in similarity and difference—thus the **judgment** of its **excess or deficiency** is made.
**Discussing** the **uniformity or divergence** of the **yearly cycles** (岁运).

When **cold** is **uniform**, **treat** it with **warmth** to **transform** it;
When **dampness** is **uniform**, **treat** it with **dryness** to **transform** it.
The **year of Minor Official** (少官), **Minor Merchant** (少商), and **Minor Musician** (少羽) **aligns** with **cold**—
The **year of Minor Official** also **aligns** with **dampness**.
If **dampness** **exceeds**, **dryness** is **appropriate**;
If **cold** **exceeds**, **warmth** is **appropriate**.
The **year of Minor Palace** (少角) and **Minor Conqueror** (少征) **must** be **treated** with **moderate balance**.

When **divergent**, **reduce** it;
When **uniform**, **increase** it—
**Use coolness** when **coolness** is **excessive**,
**Use coldness** when **coldness** is **excessive**,
**Use warmth** when **warmth** is **excessive**,
**Use heat** when **heat** is **excessive**,
**Dietary** methods should **follow** the **same principle**.

**Contrary** treatments **invert** this—**this** is the **Dao/Way**;
**Inversion** leads to **illness**.

The **Emperor** said: **"Well said!"**

How does **Minor Yin** (少阴) **govern**?

**Giber** (岐伯) replied:

**"It follows the *zi-wu* (子午) cycle."**

**Minor Yin’s Extreme Palace** (太角)
*The newly corrected edition states*: According to *The Grand Treatise on the Five Constants* (《五常政大论》), **"If the *Tai Zheng* (太征) ascends, its *qi* will be inverted."**
**Yang Bright** (阳明) **cycles** of **Renzi** (壬子) and **Renwu** (壬午) **generate** **wind** that **stirs**,

**Extreme Conqueror** (太征), **Minor Official** (少官), **Minor Merchant** (少商), **Minor Musician** (少羽) **conclude** it.

**Minor Yin’s Extreme Conqueror** (太征)
*The newly corrected edition states*: According to *The Grand Treatise on the Five Constants*, **"If the *Tai Zheng* (太征) ascends, its *qi* will be **reversed** (逆) and **withdrawn** (收) afterward."**
**Yang Bright** (阳明) **cycles** of **Wuzzi** (戊子) and **Wuwu** (戊午) **generate** **scorching heat** (炎暑).
*The newly corrected edition states*: **"Detailed examination shows: **Extreme Bright** (太彻) **cycles** **Major Yang** (太阳) **governing** the **heaven** (司天) with **hot** days,
**Minor Yang** (少阳) **governing** the **heaven** with **humid** days,
**Minor Yin** (少阴) **governing** the **heaven** with **scorching heat** days—
**This** refers to the **heaven-governing** *qi* and **speaks** of the **cycles** (运)."**
Its **transformation** is **bright** (暄), **radiant** (曜), **suppressed** (郁), **stifling** (燠).
*The newly corrected edition states*: According to *The Grand Treatise on the Five Constants*, **"It is **bright** (暄), **summer heat** (暑), **suppressed** (郁), **stifling** (燠)—
**This** variation **substitutes** *shu* (暑) for *yao* (曜), **because** it **overlaps** **Minor Yin** (少阴) **above**."**
Its **variation** is **flaming** (炎), **fierce** (烈), **boiling** (沸), **seething** (腾),
Its **illness** is **upper heat** (上热) and **blood overflow** (血溢).

**Extreme Conqueror** (太征) **concludes** in **Minor Palace** (少宫),
**Minor Official** (少官), **Extreme Merchant** (太商), **Minor Musician** (少羽) **conclude** it,
**Minor Palace** (少角) **begins** in **Minor Yin** (少阴).

**Minor Yin’s Extreme Official** (太宫)
**Yang Bright** (阳明) **cycles** of **Jiazi** (甲子) and **Jiamu** (甲午)
Its **cycles** are **yin rain** (阴雨),
Its **transformation** is **gentle** (柔), **soft** (润), **timely rain** (时雨).
*The newly corrected edition states*: According to *The Grand Treatise on the Five Constants*, **"It is **gentle** (柔), **soft** (润), **heavy** (重), **pure** (淳)—
Again, the **three cycles** of **Extreme Official** (太官) have **two** marked as **gentle** (柔), **soft** (润), **heavy** (重), **dew** (泽)—
**These** *yin rain* (雨) characters **may** be **incorrect**."**
Its **variation** is **shocking** (震), **startling** (惊), **whirling** (飘), **sudden** (骤),
Its **illness** is **mid-abdominal distension** (中满) and **body heaviness** (身重).

**Extreme Official** (太宫) **concludes** in **Minor Merchant** (少商),
**Extreme Musician** (太羽) **concludes** it,
**Extreme Palace** (太角) **begins** in **Minor Conqueror** (少征).

**Minor Yin (少阴) – Extreme Merchant (太商) – Yang Brightness (阳明)**

When **Regal Stem** (庚) **Tianfu** (子) and **Regal Stem** (庚) **Wuyu** (午) align with **Heaven’s Correspondence** (天符), they harmonize with **True Merchant** (正商).
*The newly corrected edition states*: According to *The Grand Treatise on the Five Constants* (《五常政大论》), **"The firm and established order of *Extreme Conqueror* (太征) aligns with True Merchant (正商)."**

Its **variation** is **cool and vigorous** (凉劲).
*The newly corrected edition states*: **"This is detailed as the *qi* converges at the spring, hence ‘cool and vigorous.’"**

Its **transformation** is **mist, dew, and the rustling of autumn** (雾露萧扬),
Its **change** is **austerity, killing frost, and withering decay** (肃杀凋零),
Its **illness** is **lower body coldness** (下清).

**Extreme Merchant (太商)** concludes in **Minor Musician (少羽)**#7, **Minor Conqueror (少角)** begins,
**Extreme Conqueror (太征)** concludes, **Minor Palace (少宫)**.

**Minor Yin (少阴)**, **Extreme Musician (太羽)**, **Yang Brightness (阳明)**—
When **Regal Stem** (丙) **Tianfu** (子) **Yearly Assembly** (岁会) and **Regal Stem** (丙) **Wuyu** (午) align,
Its **variation** is **cold** (寒),
Its **transformation** is **congealed, bleak, and piercingly cold** (凝惨凉冽).
*The newly corrected edition states*: According to *The Grand Treatise on the Five Constants*, it should read **"congealed, bleak, cold, and desolate" (凝惨寒零).**

Its **change** is **ice, snow, frost, and hail** (冰雪霜雹),
Its **illness** is **cold in the lower body** (寒下).

**Extreme Musician (太羽)** concludes, **Extreme Palace (太角)** begins, **Minor Conqueror (少征)**, **Extreme Official (太宫)**, **Minor Merchant (少商)**.

**All this pertains to Minor Yin’s governance of Heaven’s order (司天之政):**
The **Dao/Way’s** *qi* and transformations move in accordance with **Prenatal Order** (先天).
Earth-*qi* is austere, Heaven-*qi* is clear.
**Cold** meets **summer heat**, **heat** intensifies **dryness**.
*The newly corrected edition states*: **"‘Cold meets summer heat’ refers to the *qi* of Minor Yang (少阳) at the end of the previous year and Major Yang (太阳) at the beginning of this year—Major Yang’s cold confronting the previous year’s Minor Yang heat. ‘Heat intensifies dryness’ is because Minor Yin is above while Yang Brightness is below."**

Clouds race through the **Rain Bureau** (雨府), and **moist transformation** begins to unfold.
Timely rain descends, **Metal and Fire harmonize in virtue/power** (金火合德),
Manifesting above as **Mars and Venus** (荧惑太白).
When seen, **great clarity** arises.

Its governance is **clear**, its decrees are **sharp**,
Its grain is **red and white** (丹白).
Water and fire—**cold and heat**—contend at the *qi* exchange, marking the onset of disease:
**Heat-disease** arises above, **cold-disease** below,
**Cold and heat** clash violently in the middle.

The people suffer from:
**Coughing, wheezing, blood overflow, bloody discharge, sneezing, red eyes, and skin ulcers** (毗疡),
**Cold convulsions entering the stomach, heart pain, waist pain,**
**Abdominal distension, hoarseness, dryness, and upper-body swelling** (肿上).

**At the initial *qi*,** Earth-*qi* shifts, **dryness departs**.
*The newly corrected edition states*: **"According to *The Grand Treatise on the Five Constants*, before Yang Brightness ascends to the spring, the previous year was Minor Yang (少阳)—the *qi* of summer. As summer fades, Yang Brightness takes root in the earth. The initial *qi* of Major Yang (太阳) is why the earlier text states ‘cold meets summer heat’—summer departs, and cold begins. The ‘dryness’ here is a miswriting for ‘summer heat.’"**

**Cold** now begins, **frost conceals itself**, **water turns to ice**, **frost descends anew**, **wind arrives**.
*The newly corrected edition states*: **"According to Wang’s annotation of *The Grand Essence of Six Microcosmic Orbits* (《六微旨大论》), when Major Yang (太阳) occupies the Wood position, it brings **piercing, cutting cold winds**. ‘Wind arrives’ should read ‘wind becomes piercing.’"**

**Yang-*qi* is suppressed.**
The people suffer **restricted movement, stiff joints, and waist pain** (腰雅痛),
**Early heat rises**, and **ulcers erupt internally and externally**.

**At the second *qi*,** Yang-*qi* spreads, **wind moves freely**,
**Spring’s true *qi* arrives**, and **all things flourish**.
When **cold-*qi* arrives seasonably**, the people find **harmony**.

Their illnesses are:
**Strangury, blurred or reddened vision, and *qi* suppression above generating heat**.

**At the third *qi*,** Heaven’s governance spreads,
**Great Fire (大火) moves**, and **all creatures renew**.
When **cold-*qi* arrives seasonably**, the people suffer:
**Convulsive *qi*, heart pain, alternating cold and heat, coughing, and red eyes**.

**At the fourth *qi**,** **Lying Summer Heat** arrives, **great rains descend seasonably**,
**Cold and heat alternate**.
The people suffer:
**Cold and heat, constriction, dryness, jaundice, and malaria** (隘乾黄瘴),
**Sighing, button-like masses, and fluid disorders** (饮发).

**At the fifth *qi**,** **Fear of Fire** descends, **summer heat returns**,
**Yang transforms**, and **all things grow and flourish**,
The people find **well-being**, their illness is **warmth**.

**At the terminal *qi**,** **Dryness’ decree spreads**,
**Residual fire is suppressed within**, causing **upper-body swelling, coughing, and severe blood overflow**.
When **cold-*qi* rises repeatedly**, **mist obscures the sky**,
Disease manifests in the **skin**, lodging in the **sides**,
Descending to the **lower abdomen**, causing **internal cold**.
Earth is about to shift.

**When *qi* terminates, it must depart—it cannot endure.**
One must **restrain its movement**, **supplement its seasonal victory**,
**Release its suppression**, and **first draw from the source of transformation**.
Do this **a year in advance, in the twelfth month**, to welcome and extract it.
**Do not allow violent excess to generate disease.**

**Nourish the True-*qi* of the year with true grain**,
**Use medicinal grains to avoid vacuous evils**.
The year favors **salt** to **soften** and **harmonize the upper body**,
Or, if severe, **use bitter to disperse it**.
**Use sour to contract and stabilize the lower body**,
Or, if severe, **use bitter to drain it**.
Adjust **food and medicine** according to *qi* similarities and differences—
When aligning with **Heaven-*qi**, use **cold and clear** methods,
When aligning with **Earth-*qi**, use **warm and hot** methods.
**Extreme Palace (太角) and Extreme Conqueror (太征)** years align with Heaven-*qi*—treat with **cold and clear** methods.
**Extreme Official (太官), Extreme Merchant (太商), and Extreme Musician (太羽)** years align with Earth-*qi*—treat with **warm and hot** methods.
**Transformation** is **treatment**.
Use **heat to counter heat**, **cool to counter cool**, **warm to counter warm**, **cold to counter cold**—
**Dietary principles follow the same law**.
**Contradiction invites reversal—this is the Dao.**
**To act contrary is to invite disease.**

The Emperor said, *"Well said.* How does the governance of **Jué-Yīn** proceed?"

Qī Bó replied, *"It follows the cycles of **wèi-hài**.* **Jué-Yīn**—

**rain-wind and clearing** prevail.

In all cases, **Jué-Yīn** governs **Heavenly Sympathies (司天之政)**,
while **movements of *qi* and transformation proceed in **Post-Heaven (后天)***.

In **years aligning with the correct cycle (诸同正岁)**,
the **movements of *qi* and transformation align with Heaven’s twenty-four *qi***—
whether **excessive** or **deficient**, the **yearly *qi* transformation** either **advances in Pre-Heaven (先天)** time
or **lags in Post-Heaven (后天)** time,
yet it aligns with the **correct yearly transformation** and the **twenty-four *qi* of Heaven**, varying only in speed—
no deviation in sequence.

*The New Revision* states: *"Examining this note, it seems to claim alignment with the twenty-four *qi*, which is doubtful.
Perhaps it refers to **conjunction with the Great Cold (大寒) day**, overseeing **climatic governance (司气候)**.
When **Heavenly *qi* is turbulent** and **Earthly *qi* is correct**,
**wind arises from high altitudes** and **scorching-heat follows**,
**clouds gather toward the Rain Bureau (雨府)** and **moist transformation ensues**.

**Wind and Fire share the same virtue**,
manifesting above as **Sai-Xīng (岁星)** and **Yíng-Huò (荧惑)**.
Their governance is **flexible**,
their decrees **swift**,
their **proper grains** are **sour and dark**—
when inquiring about **grains**, the **excessive** are **Extreme Conqueror (太征)** and **Extreme Musician (太羽)**.
**Wind-dryness and Fire-heat** alternate in prevalence—
**creeping insects** appear,
**flowing waters do not freeze**,
**heat-diseases** descend below,
**wind-diseases** ascend above,
**wind-dryness** prevails in the **middle**.

The **initial *qi***—
**cold begins to prevail**, **killing-*qi* arrives**,
and the people fall ill with **cold in the lower right (右之下)**.

The **second *qi***—
**cold does not retreat**, **blossoming snow and icy waters** persist,
**killing-*qi* disperses**, **frost descends**,
and the **upper grass** is scorched—
**cold-rain strikes repeatedly**, **yang-*qi* retransforms**,
and the people fall ill with **heat in the middle**.

The **third *qi***—
**Heaven’s governance is established**, **wind rises intermittently**,
and the people suffer **tears and ringing in the ears**, **vertigo and dizziness**.

The **fourth *qi***—
**bedridden summer-heat and damp-heat** clash in the **upper left (左之上)**,
and the people fall ill with **yellowing of the skin** and **edema**.

The **fifth *qi***—
**dryness and dampness alternate in prevalence**,
**deep yīn spreads**, **cold-*qi* reaches the body**,
and **wind-rain ensues**.

The **concluding *qi***—
**reverence for Fire governs**, **yang-*qi* fully transforms**,
**creeping insects emerge**,
**flowing waters do not freeze**,
**Earthly *qi* surges**,
**grass sprouts**, **people relax**,
and their illnesses are **warm and severe**.

**One must disperse their stagnant *qi***
and **supplement their sources of transformation**—
**sources of transformation** are **the fourth month (四月)**;
**welcome and draw upon them**.

**Praise their *qi* movements**,
lest **evil *qi* prevail**.

In **Jué-Yīn years**, **adjust with *xīn* (辛) above**,
and **adjust with *xián* (咸) below**—
**reverence for Fire’s *qi***, do not rashly provoke it."

*The New Revision* states: *"Examining this movement, why does it not mention the **adjustment of *qi* similarities and differences—more or less**?
Because **Jué-Yīn governance aligns with Minor Yang (少阳) governance**,
and in the **six *qi* governance**, only **Jué-Yīn and Minor Yang** lack **contradictions of excess or deficiency above and below**—
their **treatment and transformation** are singular.
Thus, it does not reiterate that **more wind-heat aligns with more cold-transformation**,
or **less wind-heat aligns with less cold-transformation**."*

**Use warmth to counter warmth**,
**use heat to counter heat**,
**use cool to counter cool**,
**use cold to counter cold**—
**dietary principles follow the same law**.

**Contradiction invites reversal—this is the Dao**,
**to act contrary is to invite disease**.

The Emperor said, *"Well said.* Your teachings are indeed exhaustive.
Yet how may one clarify their manifestations?"*

Qī Bó replied, *"Your question is clear indeed!
The **six *qi*** proceed in **sequence** and rest in **position**,
so one must observe them at **the start of the first month**, **at dawn**,
and **perceive their position** to know their whereabouts.

Where **yīn** resides, **Heaven** responds with **clouds**,
where **yáng** resides, **Heaven** responds with **cooling-clearness**—
**natural distribution** follows without error.

If the **movement is excessive**, it arrives **early**,
if the **movement is deficient**, it arrives **late**—
**early or late** refers to the **advance or delay of the *qi* within the *yín* hour (寅时)**.
**Early** means **before the *chǒu* hour (丑时)**,
**late** means **after the *mǎo* hour (卯时)**.
This is the **Dao of Heaven**, the **constant of *qi***—
**Heaven’s Dao is evident**; one must **await its resonance**,
and **observe without error**, for this is the **constant of *qi***.

If the **movement is neither excessive nor deficient**,
this is called a **correct year (正岁)**—
its arrival **matches its proper time**.

**Proper time** means **at the very moment of the *yín* hour (寅之正)**.

The Emperor said, *"The *qi* of **prevailing alternation (胜复)** is constant—
when **disasters of green-blue** arrive, how should one **scrutinize**?"*

Qī Bó replied, *"This is not the **transformation of *qi***—
it is called a **disaster**.
The **twelve transformations** are complete."*

The Emperor said, *"What are the **numbers of Heaven and Earth**—
how do they **begin and conclude**?"*

Qī Bó replied, *"Your question is indeed exhaustive!
This is to **illuminate the Dao**.
The **beginning of numbers** arises **from above** and concludes **from below**—
before the **half-year**, **Heavenly *qi* governs**,
after the **half-year**, **Earthly *qi* governs**.
The **half-year** refers to **the day of the *Lì-Qiū* (立秋)**."

The newly revised text states:
*"The exchange of *qi* and its governance is detailed in the year prior to the **Great Cold (Dà Hàn)**. The **half-year** should be **fifteen days before the *Lì-Qiū* (立秋)**, not on the day of *Lì-Qiū* itself.
The **interchange of Heaven and Earth** is governed by **mutual exchange**—when the **yearly cycle** is complete.
**Mutual exchange** refers to **reciprocal correspondence**.

Within the **upper and lower bodies**, there are **two reciprocal correspondences**.
Thus it is said: *‘When the positions are clear, the *qi* and months can be known.’*
This is what is meant by **the *qi***.
Generally, **one *qi*** governs **sixty days with remainder**, and its position is established by numbering.
If the positions are the same as the *qi*, then the **solar terms and midpoints of months** can be determined.

Thus, when speaking of **Heavenly and Earthly *qi***, it is through the **upper and lower bodies**; when speaking of **prevailing alternation (勝復)**, it is through **exchange of *qi***; when speaking of **horizontal circulation (橫運)**, it is through **upper and lower reciprocity**—all are measured by the **solar terms**. By observing **disasters of green-blue**, the **transformations and alternations** can be anticipated.

The Emperor said: *"I govern its affairs and follow its principles, yet if they do not align with the numbers, why is that?"*

Qī Bó replied: *"The application of *qi* has excess or deficiency, and its transformations and governance have flourishing or decline. The decline and flourishing, excess and deficiency—these all follow the same transformations."*

The Emperor said: *"I wish to hear how these transformations are the same."*

Qī Bó replied: *"**Wind and warmth** are the transformations of **Spring**; **heat and dizziness from scorching fire** are the transformations of **Summer**; **prevailing and alternation** are the same; **dryness, clarity, and dew** are the transformations of **Autumn**; **clouds, rain, dimness, and long summer** are the transformations of **Late Summer**; **cold *qi*, frost, snow, and ice** are the transformations of **Winter**. These are the transformations of **Heaven and Earth’s Five Movements and Six *Qi***, alternating in their usual flourishing and decline."*

The Emperor said: *"The Five Movements proceeding in accordance with Heaven’s transformations are called **Heaven’s Correspondence (天符)**—I understand this. I wish to hear what is meant by **Earth’s Correspondence**."*

Qī Bó replied: *"There are three instances of **excess aligning with Heaven’s Correspondence**, and three instances of **deficiency aligning with Heaven’s Correspondence**; there are also three instances of **excess aligning with Earth’s Correspondence**, and three instances of **deficiency aligning with Earth’s Correspondence**—this encompasses **twenty-four years** in total.
Within sixty years, **twenty-four years align with Heaven and Earth’s transformations**, and the rest follow their respective excesses and deficiencies."*

The Emperor said: *"I wish to hear their specifics."*

Qī Bó replied:
*"In **Jia-Chen (甲辰)** and **Jia-Xū (甲戌)**, **Great Palace (太宮)** below **adds to Great Yin (太陰)**;
In **Rén-Yín (壬寅)** and **Rén-Shēn (壬申)**, **Great Horn (太角)** below **adds to Jue Yin (厥陰)**;
In **Gēng-Zǐ (庚子)** and **Gēng-Wǔ (庚午)**, **Great Commerce (太商)** below **adds to Yang Ming (陽明)**—this occurs three times.

In **Guǐ-Sì (癸巳)** and **Guǐ-Hài (癸亥)**, **Lesser Commerce (少征)** below **adds to Shao Yang (少陽)**;
In **Xīn-Chǒu (辛丑)** and **Xīn-Wèi (辛未)**, **Lesser Feather (少羽)** below **adds to Tai Yang (太陽)**;
In **Guǐ-Mǎo (癸卯)** and **Guǐ-Yǒu (癸酉)**, **Lesser Commerce (少征)** below **adds to Shao Yin (少陰)**—this occurs three times.

In **Wù-Zǐ (戊子)** and **Wù-Wǔ (戊午)**, **Great Commerce (太征)** above **temporarily governs Shao Yin (少陰)**;
In **Wù-Yín (戊寅)** and **Wù-Shēn (戊申)**, **Great Commerce (太征)** above **temporarily governs Shao Yang (少陽)**;
In **Bǐng-Chén (丙辰)** and **Bǐng-Xū (丙戌)**, **Great Feather (太羽)** above **temporarily governs Tai Yang (太陽)**—this occurs three times.

In **Dīng-Sì (丁巳)** and **Dīng-Hài (丁亥)**, **Lesser Horn (少角)** above **temporarily governs Jue Yin (厥陰)**;
In **Yǐ-Mǎo (乙卯)** and **Yǐ-Yǒu (乙酉)**, **Lesser Commerce (少商)** above **temporarily governs Yang Ming (陽明)**;
In **Jǐ-Chǒu (己丑)** and **Jǐ-Wèi (己未)**, **Lesser Palace (少宮)** above **temporarily governs Tai Yin (太陰)**—this occurs three times.
**Excluding these twenty-four years**, there is neither addition nor temporary governance."*

The Emperor said: *"What does ‘addition’ mean?"*

Qī Bó replied: *"When **excess aligns with addition**, it corresponds to **Heaven’s Correspondence**; when **deficiency aligns with addition**, it corresponds to **Yearly Assembly (歲會)**."*

The Emperor said: *"What does ‘temporary governance’ mean?"*

Qī Bó replied: *"Whether **excess or deficiency**, they are all called **Heaven’s Correspondence**, but their manifestations vary in degree—**disease forms** range from mild to severe, and **life and death** occur at different times."*

The Emperor said: *"Master, you speak of **using cold to counter excess cold** and **using heat to counter excess heat**—I do not yet understand this. I wish to hear what is meant by **‘countering at a distance’**."*

Qī Bó replied: *"**Heat should not clash with heat**, and **cold should not clash with cold**—conformity brings harmony, while opposition brings illness. One must **revere and avoid** these, as they align with **the seasons and the Six Positions**.
In the **months when the Four Seasons rule**, if **medicines, food, clothing, or thermal properties** align in **heat or cold**, they should all be avoided.
If one **contradicts the Four Seasons** in such alignment, it is like **adding water to water or fire to fire**—**cold diseases** will arise."*

The Emperor said: *"How about **warmth and coolness**? Since they are between **heat and cold**, can they be lightly contravened?"*

Qī Bó replied: *"If the **ruling *qi* is hot**, do not use **hot**—do not contravene;
If the **ruling *qi* is cold**, do not use **cold**—do not contravene;
If the **ruling *qi* is cool**, do not use **cool**—do not contravene;
If the **ruling *qi* is warm**, do not use **warm**—do not contravene;
If the **ruling *qi* aligns with its master**, do not contravene;
If the **ruling *qi* differs from its master**, then **lightly contravene**—this is called **the Four Reverences**, and the people must **heed them carefully**."*

The Emperor said: *"Good. What of those who contravene?"*

Qī Bó replied: *"When the **Heavenly *qi* reverses its season**, one may follow the season’s due course—
if the reversal is extreme, one may still follow the season’s due course.
If the **ruling *qi* overpowers its master**, then contravention is permissible.
When summer’s heat is extreme, one may use **hot to treat hot**,
but if cold *qi* is not extreme, one must not contravene it.
**Balance** should be the standard—
yet one must not overdo it.
When *qi* is balanced, the excess ceases;
when excess occurs, disease arises.
Excess leading to disease is akin to contravention—
this is called **the reversal of perverse *qi**.*

When *qi* moves and overpowers, this is called **perverse *qi**;
when guest *qi* overpowers the host, it must be resisted.
Within the **Six Steps**, when *qi* should be cold but is hot,
should be hot but is cold,
should be warm but is cool,
should be cool but is warm—
this is called **the perverse victory of the Six Steps**.

When winter reverses to warmth,
summer reverses to chill,
autumn reverses to heat,
spring reverses to cool—
this is called **the perverse victory of the Four Seasons**.

When victory occurs, one must reverse its *qi* to restore balance.
Thus it is said:
**Do not betray Heaven’s truth**,
**do not defy the *qi*’s nature**,
**do not aid its excess**,
**do not assist its return**—
this is called **the supreme governance**.

**Heaven’s truth** refers to the fixed due times.
**Aid and assist** both mean to reinforce.
To diligently uphold Heaven’s truth
is the **supreme, wondrous principle**."*

**Chapter on the Great Framework of the Five Phases and Their Regular Cycles (Lower)**

The Emperor said: *"Well spoken."* The Five Phases’ *qi* governs the annual cycles—does it have fixed regularities?

Gebi replied: *"Let me enumerate them."*

**For the years of Jiazi and Jiamao:**
- **Jiazi Year:** Upper Phase—*Shaoyin* Fire, Middle Phase—*Taigong* Earth, Running Phase—*Yangming* Metal.
  - *Qi* transformations: Heat (2).
  - *New Annotation:* Detailed clarification: *"Standard transformations follow the excess count; correct transformations follow the generated count."*
  - In the Jiazi Year: Heat (7), Dryness (9).
  - In the Jiamao Year: Heat (2), Dryness (4).
  - Rain (5).
  - *New Annotation:* *"According to the original text: ‘Excess or deficiency—where does it begin? Excess follows the excess count; deficiency follows the generated count. Earth always generates.’ The Jia Year’s *Taigong* Earth runs in excess, hence Rain (5)—5 is the Earth’s number. Dryness (4) is the ‘correct transformation day.’ This is the ‘standard *qi* transformation.’*
  - Its transformations: Upper—*xian* (salty) cold, Middle—*ku* (bitter) heat, Lower—*suan* (sour) heat—*this is the appropriate prescription for medicines and foods.*
  - *New Annotation:* *"According to *Xuanzhu*: ‘Lower—*ku* (bitter) heat.’ Also, in *Zhizhen Yaodao Lun*: ‘Excess heat is countered by *xian* (salty) cold. Dryness within is treated with *ku* (bitter) warmth.’ Here, ‘lower *suan* (sour) heat’ seems erroneous."*

**For the years of Yichou and Yiwu:**
- **Yichou and Yiwu Years:** Upper Phase—*Taiyin* Earth, Middle Phase—*Shaoshang* Metal, Running Phase—*Taiyang* Water.

  - *New Annotation:* *"Detailed: The seven palaces correspond to *Xisi* (West Chamber), the *Dui* position, governed by *Tianren* (Heaven’s Task). The calamity’s direction follows the running phase’s cardinal position."*
  - Dampness (5).
  - *New Annotation:* *"Detailed: *Taiyin* governs *Wei* (5) in *Wei*, opposes *Chou* (2), both transformations are (5)—by generated count. Not using the excess count, as Earth rules all four seasons, cannot occupy the central position, and Heaven has nine palaces, not ten."*
  - Clear (4).
  - *New Annotation:* *"According to the later text: ‘Deficiency follows the generated count.’ The Yi Year’s *Shaoshang* Metal runs deficient, hence Clear (4)—4 is the Metal’s generated number."*
  - Cold (6).
  - *New Annotation:* *"Detailed: Yichou—Cold (6); Yiwu—Cold (1). This is the ‘correct transformation day.’*
  - Its transformations: Upper—*ku* (bitter) heat, Middle—*suan* (sour) harmony, Lower—*gan* (sweet) heat—*this is the appropriate prescription for medicines and foods.*
  - *New Annotation:* *"According to *Xuanzhu*: ‘Upper—*suan* (sour) balance, Lower—*gan* (sweet) warmth.’ Also in *Zhizhen Yaodao Lun*: ‘Excess dampness is countered by *ku* (bitter) heat. Cold within is treated with *gan* (sweet) heat.’ Here, ‘lower *gan* (sweet) heat’ seems inconsistent."*

**For the years of Bingyin and Bingshen:**
- *New Annotation:* *"Detailed: In the Bingshen Year, *Shen* Metal generates Water; Water’s transformative order flourishes, and *Xianghuo* (Relative Fire) in the Heavenly Stem suffers half its strength."*
- Upper Phase—*Shaoyang* Relative Fire, Middle Phase—*Taizheng* Fire, Running Phase—*Jueyin* Wood.
  - Fire (2).
  - *New Annotation:* *"Detailed: Bingyin—Fire (2); Bingshen—Fire (7)."*
  - Cold (6), Wind (3).
  - *New Annotation:* *"Detailed: Bingyin—Wind (8); Bingshen—Wind (3). This is the ‘correct transformation day.’*
  - Its transformations: Upper—*xian* (salty) cold, Middle—*xian* (salty) warmth, Lower—*xin* (pungent) warmth—*this is the appropriate prescription for medicines and foods.*
  - *New Annotation:* *"According to *Xuanzhu*: ‘Lower—*xin* (pungent) cool.’ Also in *Zhizhen Yaodao Lun*: ‘Excess fire is countered by *xian* (salty) clarity. Wind within is treated with *xin* (pungent) cool.’ Here, ‘lower *xin* (pungent) warmth’ seems inconsistent."*

**For the years of Dingmao and Dingyou (converging):**
- *New Annotation:* *"Detailed: In the Ding Year, the first month’s *Renyin* (Ren) aligns with *Gande* (Dry Virtue), establishing *pingqi* (balanced *qi*), with no victory or reversal. The running phase aligns with the correct *jiao* (angle), Metal does not conquer Wood, and Wood does not calamity Earth. Also, in the Dingmao Year, *mao* Wood assists, so the Upper *Yangming* cannot calamity it."*
- Upper Phase—*Yangming* Metal, Middle Phase—*Shaojiao* Wood, Running Phase—*Shaoyin* Fire.
  - Clear and Heat transformations alternate in victory—*this is the ‘evil *qi* transformation day,’* bringing calamity to the three palaces.

  - Wind (3), Heat (7).
  - *New Annotation:* *"Detailed: Dingmao—Heat (2); Dingyou—Heat (7). This is the ‘correct transformation day.’*
  - Its transformations: Upper—*ku* (bitter) slight warmth, Middle—*xin* (pungent) harmony, Lower—*xian* (salty) cold—*this is the appropriate prescription for medicines and foods.*
  - *New Annotation:* *"According to *Zhizhen Yaodao Lun*: ‘Excess dryness is countered by *ku* (bitter) heat. Excess heat within is treated with *xian* (salty) cold.’ Also in *Xuanzhu*: ‘Upper—*ku* (bitter) heat.’"*

**For the years of Wencheng and Wuxu:**
- Upper Phase—*Taiyang* Water, Middle Phase—*Taizheng* Fire, Running Phase—*Taiyin* Earth.

  - *New Annotation:* *"According to *Zhizhen Yaodao Lun*: ‘Excess cold is countered by *xin* (pungent) heat. Excess dampness within is treated with *ku* (bitter) heat.’ Also in *Xuanzhu*: ‘Upper—*gan* (sweet) warmth, Lower—*suan* (sour) balance.’"*

**For the years of Jisi and Jihai:**
- Upper Phase—*Jueyin* Wood, Middle Phase—*Shaogong* Earth, Running Phase—*Shaoyang* Relative Fire.
  - Wind and Clear transformations alternate in victory—*this is the ‘evil *qi* transformation day,’* bringing calamity to the five palaces.
  - *New Annotation:* *"According to *Wuchang Zhengda Lun*: ‘Its green four limbs.’ Also in *Tianyuan Yuce*: ‘The central chamber is *Tianqin* (Heaven’s Bird), not a limb palace; it shares the correct palace’s position in the two *yuan* (offices) of *Kun* (Earth).’"*

For the years of **Jisi** and **Jihai**:
- Wind transformations: three.
  - *New Annotation:* *"According to *New Correction*: ‘In Jisi, wind transformations are eight; in Jihai, three.’"*
- Damp transformations: five. Fire transformations: eight.
  - *New Annotation:* *"According to *New Correction*: ‘In Jisi, heat transformations are seven; in Jihai, three.’"*
  - This is the **"orthodox transformation day."**
  - Its transformations: Upper—*xīn* (pungent) and cool, Middle—*gān* (sweet) and harmonious, Lower—*xián* (salty) and cold—**"the appropriate medicinal and dietary prescriptions."**
  - *New Annotation:* *"According to *Zhizhen Yaodao Lun*: ‘When wind prevails, balance with *xīn* (pungent) and cool. Fire rages within, treat with *xián* (salty) and clear.’"*

For the years of **Gengwu** and **Gengzi** (both in harmony with Heaven’s Sympathy):
- Upper Phase—*Shaoyin* Fire, Middle Phase—*Taishang* Metal (Gold).
  - *New Annotation:* *"According to *New Correction*: ‘In Gengwu, Metal’s command is half; above, *Shaoyin* (Minister Fire) appears, and the year stem is also Fire.’ In Gengzi, *zi* (Water) prevails, and Metal *qi* harmonizes—differing from Gengwu."*

For the years of **Xinwei** and **Xinchou** (both in harmony with the Yearly Assembly):
- Upper Phase—*Taiyin* Earth, Middle Phase—*Shaoyu* Water.
  - *New Annotation:* *"According to *New Correction*: ‘Until the seventh month, *bingshen* (Ap申), Water returns to the orthodox *yu* (羽).’"*
- Lower Phase—*Taiyang* Water, rain transformations: five, cold transformations: one.
  - *New Annotation:* *"According to *New Correction*: ‘Here, the year and *zàiquán* (residual *qi*) are both Water, hence only cold transformations are one. Cold transformations of one—*Shaoyu*’s transformation *qi*. If *Taiyang*’s residual *qi* transforms, then in Xinwei, cold transformations are one; in Xinchou, six.’"*
  - This is the **"orthodox transformation day."**
  - Its transformations: Upper—*kǔ* (bitter) and hot, Middle—*kǔ* (bitter) and harmonious, Lower—*kǔ* (bitter) and hot—**"the appropriate medicinal and dietary prescriptions."**

- Lower Phase—*Jueyin* Wood, fire transformations: two.
  - *New Annotation:* *"According to *New Correction*: ‘In Renshen, heat transformations are seven; in Renyin, two.’ Wind transformations: eight.
  - *New Annotation:* *"According to *New Correction*: ‘Here, the year and *zàiquán* (residual *qi*) are both Wood, hence only wind transformations are eight. Wind transformations of eight—*Taijiao*’s year transformation. If *Jueyin*’s residual *qi* transforms, then in Renshen, wind transformations are three; in Renyin, eight.’"*
  - This is the **"orthodox transformation day."**
  - Its transformations: Upper—*xián* (salty) and cold, Middle—*suān* (sour) and harmonious, Lower—*xīn* (pungent) and cool—**"the appropriate medicinal and dietary prescriptions."**

For the years of **Guixu** and **Guimao** (both in harmony with the Yearly Assembly):
- Upper Phase—*Yangming* Metal, Middle Phase—*Shaozheng* Fire.
  - *New Annotation:* *"According to *New Correction*: ‘In the fifth month, encountering *wuyu* (戊午), Fire returns to the orthodox *zheng* (征).’"*
- Lower Phase—*Shaoyin* Fire, cold transformations, rain transformations alternating in victory—**"the evil *qi* transformation day,"** calamity to the nine palaces.
  - *New Annotation:* *"According to *New Correction*: ‘Nine palaces—*Lí* position, Southern Chamber, Heaven’s *Yīng* (英).’"*
  - Dryness transformations: nine.
  - *New Annotation:* *"According to *New Correction*: ‘In Guixu, dryness transformations are four; in Guimao, nine.’ Heat transformations: two.
  - *New Annotation:* *"According to *New Correction*: ‘Here, the year and *zàiquán* (residual *qi*) are both Fire, hence only heat transformations are two. Heat transformations of two—*Shaozheng*’s year transformation. If *Shaoyin*’s residual *qi* transforms, then in Guixu, heat transformations are seven; in Guimao, two.’"*
  - This is the **"orthodox transformation day."**
  - Its transformations: Upper—*kǔ* (bitter) and slightly warm, Middle—*xián* (salty) and warm, Lower—*xián* (salty) and cold—**"the appropriate medicinal and dietary prescriptions."**
  - *New Annotation:* *"According to *Xuanzhu*: ‘Upper—*kǔ* (bitter) and hot.’"*

For the years of **Jiaxu** and **Jachen** (Yearly Assembly and Heaven’s Sympathy):
- Upper Phase—*Taiyang* Water, Middle Phase—*Taigong* Earth.
- Lower Phase—*Taiyin* Earth, cold transformations: six.
  - *New Annotation:* *"According to *New Correction*: ‘In Jiaxu, cold transformations are one; in Jachen, six.’ Damp transformations: five.
  - *New Annotation:* *"According to *New Correction*: ‘Here, the year and *zàiquán* (residual *qi*) are both Earth, hence only damp transformations are five.’"*
  - This is the **"orthodox transformation day."**
  - Its transformations: Upper—*kǔ* (bitter) and hot, Middle—*kǔ* (bitter) and warm, Lower—*kǔ* (bitter) and warm—**"the appropriate medicinal and dietary prescriptions."**
  - *New Annotation:* *"According to *Xuanzhu*: ‘Upper—*gān* (sweet) and warm, Lower—*suān* (sour) and balanced.’ Also in *Zhizhen Yaodao Lun*: ‘When cold prevails, balance with *xīn* (pungent) and hot. Dampness rages within, treat with *kǔ* (bitter) and hot.’"*

For the years of **Yihai** and **Yisi**:
- Upper Phase—*Jueyin* Wood, Middle Phase—*Shaoshang* Metal (Gold).

The *New Correction* states: Examining the year **Yihai**, in the third month encountering the **Gengchen** month, the **#4 Stem Virtue** is seen—thus the *qi* returns to the orthodox *Shang* (Metal). Fire, though not yet reigning, first achieves balance, and since fire does not prevail, water does not recover. Moreover, **Yihai** is a year when Water gains strength, hence fire does not prevail.

In the year **Yisi**, fire arrives and achieves slight victory—**Si** (Peri) assists in its victory. In the second month, during the *qi* of the Heavenly Stem Fire, the transformation day arrives, and fire acts in victory, failing to suppress **#5 Water**. The **#6** third month, **Gengchen**, is left behind, and **Yi** encounters **Geng**, preserving the *qi* intact, while Metal returns to orthodox *Shang*.

Below, the **#7** lesser Yang relative fire’s heat—
the transformation of cold and victory is the same, known as the **"Day of Pathogenic *Qi*"**, bringing calamity to the seven palaces.

Wind transformations: eight.
The *New Correction* states: Examining **Yihai**, wind transformations are three; **Yisi**, wind transformations are eight.

Clear transformations: four; fire transformations: two.
The *New Correction* states: Examining **Yihai**, heat transformations are two; **Yisi**, heat transformations are seven.

This is the **"Orthodox Transformation Degree"**—degree refers to the day.
Its transformations: Upper—*xīn* (pungent) and cool, Middle—sour and harmonious, Lower—salty and cold—**"the appropriate medicinal and dietary prescriptions."**

For the years of **Bingzi** and **Bingwu**:
- Upper—*Shaoyin* Fire, Middle—*Taiyu* Water,
  Running below—*Yangming* Metal.
Heat transformations: two.
The *New Correction* states: Examining **Bingzi**, heat transformations are seven; Metal’s calamity is half-realized, as the running *qi* of Water is excessive, prevailing over the Heavenly Mandate, which is thus halved.

*The New Correction states:* In detail, in the **Guǐyǐ** (癸巳) year, **Zhèngzhēng** (正征) Fire **qì** (气) is balanced. The term *suìhuì* (岁会) refers to two aspects: first, **Yǐ** (巳) is Fire; second, Water has not yet undergone transformation. Third, in the fifth month on **Wùwǔ** (戊午), **Guǐ** (癸) harmonizes with **Wù** (戊), thus attaining balanced **qì** (气).
In the **Guǐhài** (癸亥) year, **Hài** (亥) is Water, and Water, having gathered its annual strength, now exerts its dominance. Until the fifth month on **Wùwǔ** (戊午), Fire returns to **Zhèngzhēng** (正征), and its **qì** (气) then becomes balanced.

In general, these fixed cycles of **jì** (纪), where **shèngfù** (胜复) and **zhènghuà** (正化) occur, all have constant numbers that must be observed. Thus, those who grasp their essence can summarize them in a single phrase, while those who do not may wander endlessly without conclusion. This is what is meant.

The Emperor said: Good. Does the **qì** (气) of the Five **Yùn** (运) also follow the yearly cycle?
**Fù** (复) means **bào** (报) retaliation. When one **yùn** (运) prevails excessively over another, the latter retaliates in turn.
**Qí** (岐伯) said: When **qì** (气) is suppressed to its extreme, it erupts. It waits for its appointed time to act.
**Dài** (待), referring to the **wǔ** (五) and **chā** (差) divisions of position, means that the excesses arise in the **Chén-Yǐ** (辰巳) phase for great warmth, in the **Shēn-Wèi** (申未) phase for great heat, in the **Xū-Hài** (戌亥) phase for great coolness, and in the **Chǒu-Yín** (丑寅) phase for great coldness. The upper phases trigger the **shèngfù** (胜复) dominance, also awaiting the **qì** (气) to manifest, hence the saying "waits for its appointed time."
*The New Correction states:* The character **qì** (气) after *dài* (待) may be a misprint for *shèng* (胜).

The Emperor said: I beg to ask further about this.
**Qí** (岐伯) said: The **qì** (气) of the Five **Phases** (**wǔcháng** 五常), when too excessive or insufficient, manifests differently. When a year is too excessive, its manifestation is early; when insufficient, its manifestation is late.

The Emperor said: I wish to hear this fully.
**Qí** (岐伯) said: Excessive manifestations are sudden, while insufficient ones are gradual. Sudden excesses lead to severe diseases, while gradual ones result in milder afflictions. This refers to the **qì** (气) of the **Phases** clashing and restraining one another.

The Emperor said: How do these excessive or insufficient manifestations quantify?
**Qí** (岐伯) said: When excessive, the numbers are complete; when insufficient, the numbers are incomplete. Earth is always incomplete.
**Shù** (数), referring to the transformations and movements of the Five **Phases**, are as follows: Water has one, Fire has two, Wood has three, Metal has four, and Earth has five.
**Chéngshù** (成数), meaning complete numbers, are Water six, Fire seven, Wood eight, Metal nine, and Earth five. Hence, Earth is always incomplete.
**Shùshēng** (数生), meaning incomplete numbers, are determined by the relative abundance or scarcity of each **Phase**’s transformations. Thus, the auspicious or inauspicious days of governance, virtue, and **shèngfù** (胜复) are all calculated based on these numbers, including the finest measurements of inches, centimeters, and millimeters. This is the overarching principle for all **Phases**.

The Emperor said: How do these manifestations occur?
**Qí** (岐伯) said: When Earth **qì** (气) is suppressed, it erupts with **Yángǔ** (严谷) thunderous tremors and **Jīnyīng** (震惊) startling disturbances. The **Léiyīn** (雷殷) thunder and **qì** (气) clash, while the sky darkens with **āihūn huánghēi** (埃昏黄黑) dust and murkiness, transforming into **báiqì** (白气) white vapors that rise swiftly and deeply.
**Yù** (郁), meaning suppressed, refers to the extreme intensity of Earth **qì** (气). Hence, even the **tiānqì** (天气) has limits. Though its suppression may rage, it eventually subsides, so even when suppressed, it erupts in fury. Earth’s transformations are blocked, leading to scorching heat without rain, and Wood’s excess surpasses its limits, causing the suppressed Earth to erupt violently.
Earth’s nature is tranquil and static, yet when it moves, thunderous rains descend, and the clashing **qì** (气) of Wood and Earth then **xiūjiě** (休解) subsides and resolves.
The *Yì* (易) says: *"Thunder and rain act, and resolution follows."* This is what is meant.
Though Earth may erupt alone, Wood still restrains it, so only **jīnyīng** (震惊) tremors occur within the **qì** (气) clash, and its voice cannot yet rise far.
Hence the saying: *"Thunder and **yīn** (殷) clash in the **qì** (气)."* **Qì** (气) clash refers to Earth’s **qì** (气) reaching the peaks of the mountains.
The *Shī* (诗) says: *"The thunder is resounding."* This is the thunder and rain generated within the mountains. Earth’s **qì** (气) is suppressed and intense, while the Heavenly Wood restrains it. The plains, where Earth is thin, are perpetually dry and arid, unable to erupt first. The mountains, where Earth is thick, have abundant dampness and deep transformations, so their Earth **qì** (气) erupts first in fury.
Striking rocks sends sparks flying, and torrential waters surge forth. Rivers overflow and spread widely, while fields and pastures are submerged by **tǔjù** (土驹) Earth currents. Swift winds and sudden rains cause the banks to collapse and mountains to transform, with great floods surging horizontally and jagged rocks erupting violently. High peaks and hollow valleys—when rocks are struck, sparks fly first, followed by the rush of torrential waters.

The **Hong**—greatness—when mighty rivers overflow, their currents spreading across the plains, drowning and drifting all within their vast embrace. When the great waters recede, the stones and earth stand precariously, as though herds of **tǔjù** (Earth currents) scatter across the fields.

Speaking of **tǔ** (Earth), it is akin to sand and stone. When its transformative **qì** (化气) spreads, it brings timely rains—beginning to generate, to grow, to transform, and to complete. This is **tǔhuà** (土化), Earth’s transformation. When Earth’s **qì** is restrained, its transformative power fails to spread. At the extreme of decline, there comes renewal; at the extreme of bending, there comes extension. In times of discord, its transformative **qì** arises and spreads across all things, raining in season, nourishing grasses and trees to completion. *Shàn* (善) here means "timely."

When transformative **qì** is scarce and growth **qì** has passed, then all things begin to generate, to grow, to transform, and to complete. These four beginnings reveal that the formation of all things is delayed. Thus, the people suffer from abdominal distension, intestinal rumbling, and frequent bowel movements; in severe cases, they experience heart pain, flank spasms, vomiting, and cholera-like disorders, with drinking leading to diarrhea and edema, heaviness in the body—all signs of **pí rè** (spleen heat).

Then come the **yúnbēn yǔfǔ** (云奔雨府), with clouds surging and mists enveloping the morning sun, while mountains and marshes grow hazy—this is its eruption, governed by the four **qì** (四气). The **yǔfǔ** (雨府) is the domain of **Tài Yīn** (太阴). **Āi** (埃) is a thin, cloud-like vapor—sometimes faint as silk threads rising, sometimes dense as a thin mist. When dense, it appears near; when faint, it appears far. The four **qì** refer to the thirty-one days after the summer solstice until the autumn equinox.

Clouds stretch across the heavens like a crown, drifting and forming, vanishing and reappearing—this is the precursor to **fú** (怫). When clouds stretch across the sky like a mountain’s crown, with rocks and valleys shrouded in thin layers, appearing and disappearing, revealing Earth’s presence, the signs of **fú** are already clear—all observed at dawn. *Fúyóu* (浮游) is observed by gazing before noon.

When **jīn** (Metal) erupts, the sky clears and the earth brightens, the wind sharpens, and great cold descends. Grasses and trees wither in dryness, and the **shāoshāo** (雾雾) mists rise repeatedly as **shāqì** (杀气) arrives, turning plants pale and dry. Metal thus makes its sound. *Dà liáng* (大凉) is the onset of cold. *Jǔ* (举) means "to take effect." *Fúyīn* (浮姻) is dry **qì**. *Shāqì* (杀气) is frost. The true arrival of **shāqì** occurs between the hours of **chǒu** (丑) and **chén** (辰), or at **mǎo** (卯) and **shēn** (申) for prolonged durations. Its arrival is marked by yellow, red, and black hues mingling. Unable to endure the killing **qì**, grasses and trees turn pale and dry. *Cāng* (苍) is a thin greenish hue. Thus, the people suffer from coughing, heart and flank distension drawing toward the lower abdomen, sudden violent pain preventing turning, dry throat, and a sickly, ashen complexion—Metal overcoming Wood.

When mountains and marshes wither and Earth hardens with frost and salt, **fó** (佛) erupts, its **qì** being the fifth. When summer’s **huǒ** (fire) rages excessively and timely rains fail, mountains and marshes dry up, and the Earth’s surface congeals into white, salty frost. The five **qì** span from the autumn equinox to fifty-four days after the winter solstice. Nighttime frost and morning dew bring a mournful sound from the forests—this is **fó**’s omen. When nighttime dew soaks the ground and morning winds howl, this is the sign of Metal’s eruption.

When **shuǐ** (Water) erupts, **yángqì** (阳气) opens, and **yīnqì** (阴气) surges violently, bringing great cold. Rivers and marshes freeze solid, cold clouds congeal into frost and snow. *Hánlíng* (寒零) is white **qì**. Its form resembles mist but does not disperse, falling to the ground like frost and snow, melting in sunlight. In severe cases, yellow and black vapors obscure the sky, mingling with **qì** until frost kills all—Water then reveals its **xiáng** (祥). Yellow and black are also turbid, malevolent **qì**. *Shuǐ* here refers to **qì**. *Xiáng* is great **xiáng**, also meaning springs emerging from flat ground. Thus, the people suffer from cold-induced heart pain, lumbar stiffness, stiff large joints, difficulty bending or stretching, frequent cold limbs, and abdominal fullness from stagnation—Yin overcoming Yang.

The **yang** light fails to govern, and stagnant **yīn** accumulates in emptiness, as white dust dims the sky—then it erupts. Its **qi** precedes and follows the two fires [of the heart and ministerial fire].

The **yīn** essence and water both ascend to receive the fire, so its eruption occurs before and after the sovereign and ministerial fires, just as the morning star follows the sun.

The **Tàixū** (太虚) probes the profound depths—its **qi** resembles scattered hemp fibers, faintly visible yet concealed, black with a faint yellow hue, a precursor to its outburst.

*Shēn xuán* (深玄) refers to its lofty, dark vastness. The **qi** is like dispersed hemp fibers, thin and barely perceptible.

After the *yín* hour and during the *mǎo* hour, or in summer months before the *chén* hour, it may also be observed.

When wood stagnates and erupts, the **Tàixū** fills with dusty haze, disturbing all things, and great winds arrive—roofs lift, beams snap, and wood transforms.

*Hùfā* (屋发) means the upturned *hóngwěn* (鸿吻) tiles rise. *Zhé mù* (折木) refers to great trees being uprooted and snapped, or suspended poles snapping mid-span. *Biàn* (变) means strange, anomalous wood forms arise from the earth.

Thus, the people suffer from stomach and *yuàn* (院) region pain radiating to the heart, upper support of the two flanks, *géyàn* (鬲咽) obstruction, inability to swallow food or drink. In severe cases, they experience ringing in the ears, dizziness, vertigo, and inability to recognize people, often collapsing suddenly in rigidity.

The sinews and bones stiffen and fail to function, and they fall unconscious without awareness.

The **Tàixū** darkens with pallid dust, blending into a single hue with the heavens and mountains.

「Sometimes it appears as a murky hue, with yellow and black *qi* gathering in chaotic layers, when no clouds rise to bring rain—yet the *hùfā* (屋发) disturbance erupts. Its *qi* (气) is erratic and without fixed pattern.

Its *qi* resembles dust or clouds, sometimes yellow and black in oppressive layers, still lingering within the **Tàixū** (太虚) yet distinctly anomalous from the usual. This is its portent.

Endless rivers stagnate, soft leaves turn shadowed, pines groan on high peaks, tigers roar amid mountain crags—these are the omens of its onset.
*Grǎo yǎn* (草偃) means the grass bows without wind. *Róu yè* (柔叶) refers to the white willow leaves. When leaves all reverse their sides without wind, this is called *chéng yīn* (呈阴).
All such signs indicate a mild or severe onset; severe cases erupt swiftly, mild ones slowly.

For mountain *hùfā* (候), one observes the pines and tigers; for cool *hùfā* (候), one watches the ephedra. In autumn and winter, one looks to the osmanthus and cicada leaves for its signs.

When *huǒ yù* (火郁) erupts, the **Tàixū** (太虚) swells with crimson *qi* (气), obscuring the **Dàmíng** (大明).
*Zhǒng yì* (肿翳) means the red *qi* (气). **Dàmíng** (大明) refers to the sun.

The **Tàixū** (太虚) text clarifies: The *zhǒng* (肿) character in the *jīngzhù* (经注) is likely erroneous.

During the *yánhuǒ* (炎火) season, when the **Dàshǔ** (大暑) arrives, the mountains and marshes blaze with flames, timber exudes sap, vast halls emit smoke, the earth rises with frost and salt, still waters grow murky, creeping plants turn withered yellow. The wind stirs confusion in speech, and dampness transforms afterward. The **Tàiyīn** (太阴) and **Tàiyáng** (太阳) dominate above, while cold dampness permeates the **Tàixū** (太虚). The heart’s *huǒ* (火) aligns with the heavens, yet it is suppressed and cannot manifest. When cold dampness prevails, the *huǒ* (火) rises with the seasons, and the yang *qi* (气) and fire’s radiance surge—thus, the mountains and marshes erupt in flames, well water diminishes, false and erroneous speech spreads, and rain arrives past its due time.
*Shīhuà* (湿化) comes afterward, meaning when the yang *qi* (气) is excessive and dominates its season, the *qi* (气) does not contend for primacy, so drought precedes rain.

Thus, the people suffer from *shǎo qì* (少气), sores and ulcers with flaccid swelling, pain in the flanks, abdomen, chest, and back, as well as the face and four limbs. Their anger is stifled, their chest distended, with ulcerated rashes, itching, vomiting, and retching. Paralysis, phlegm, and bone pain arise, and the joints may twitch. Feverish *zhùliè* (注下) malaria and *wēn shì* (温疟) cold malaria occur, with sudden abdominal agony, blood overflowing and pooling, semen becoming scanty. Their eyes turn red, their hearts burn hot—severe cases lead to suffocating haze, oppression, and torment, often resulting in sudden death.

When *huǒ yù* (火郁) rages, the earth and water *qi* (气) resist it, whether as host or guest, and none penetrate deeply—then there is no harm. But if heat overcomes cold, it becomes a force that crushes adversity, and since the heat originates from the heart, the spirit *qi* (神气) is isolated and endangered. If not swiftly treated, the vital essence will be exhausted, and death follows. The fire’s swift action is why sudden death occurs.»

When the day-night water cycle reaches its end, sweat moistens the *Xuànfǔ* [玄府], and then the outbreak occurs—its *qi* [气] manifests in four forms.
*The day-night water cycle* refers to the moment when the twenty-four *shí* [时] divisions of day and night are complete. *Dàwēn* [大温] is the next stage after heat. *Xuànfǔ* [玄府] refers to the void of sweat—when sweat permeates this void, it means the body steams with early heat. At the moment the cycle ends, *yin* [阴] is most potent here, yet there is no cool *qi*—this shows *yin* cannot overcome *yang*, and since heat has already sprouted, it must erupt in fury.

*—New Annotation:* How does the soil and fire together unleash these four *qi*? Fire has two positions: one where water triggers its eruption, and another where great heat emerges in the *shēn-wèi* [申未] hours. Thus, the outbreak of suppressed fire occurs across the four seasons.

When movement reaches its peak, stillness follows; when *yang* reaches its extreme, *yin* returns. The *shī* [湿] order transforms and solidifies. Fire’s fury dries the metal—when *yang* exceeds its limit, it fears fire and seeks refuge in the earth. Earth saves the scorched metal, unleashing gusty winds followed by timely rains, restoring balance to the *qi*. Thus, all things grow, transform, and mature.

Peak strength inevitably reverses; even flourishing cannot endure forever. When flowers bloom and water congeals, when mountains and rivers freeze, when the sun blazes at noon—these are the omens of *fú* [怫] before its arrival. When the sovereign fire reigns, cold descends—thus, when the fire season erupts, it too awaits its time. Only after the signs of *fú* appear does it respond, for all things are observed at their extremes before eruption. Wood’s outbreak has no set time; water follows fire’s lead.

The signs appear first, the eruption follows—thus, the response precedes the outbreak. Things cannot remain perpetually strong; when strength peaks, the *fú-qi* [怫气] arises. Suppression leads to eruption—this is the nature of *qi*. If one carefully observes the timing, illness can be predicted. Missing the season reverses the year, and the Five *qi* [五气] stagnate, halting generation, transformation, and storage. Governance then falters.

If humans lose their proper timing, then prognostications lack precision.

The Emperor asked: *"When water erupts, it brings hail and snow; when earth erupts, it brings gusty winds; when wood erupts, it brings destruction and breaking; when metal erupts, it brings clarity; when fire erupts, it brings smoky darkness. What *qi* causes these phenomena?"*

Gēbó replied: *"The *qi* varies in intensity—mild eruptions align with their own *qi*, while severe ones encompass the *qi* below. By examining the *qi* beneath, the signs become apparent. Each of the Six *qi* has a supporting *qi* beneath it: beneath fire’s position lies water’s *qi*; beneath water’s position lies earth’s *qi*; beneath earth’s position lies wood’s *qi*; beneath wood’s position lies metal’s *qi*; beneath metal’s position lies fire’s *qi*; beneath the sovereign’s position lies *yin* essence. By observing the *qi* below, the patterns emerge.*

*Thus, when an eruption encompasses the *qi* beneath, it differs from its original form."*

The Emperor said: *"Excellent. When the Five *qi* erupt out of their proper season, what does this mean?"* —*"Out of their correct month."*

Gēbó replied: *"This is called *chā* [差]."* —*"It refers to the deviation from the proper seasonal month."*

*—New Annotation:* According to the *Zhìzhēn Yàodà Lùn* [至真要大论], *"When counteracting *qi* arise, their movements are out of season—sometimes arriving late, sometimes early. What is the reason?"*

Gēbó replied: *"The generation and transformation of *qi*, along with their waxing and waning, differ. The applications of cold, heat, warmth, and coolness vary in intensity, governed by the four cardinal directions. Thus, *yang*’s movement begins with warmth and peaks in summer, while *yin*’s movement begins with coolness and peaks in winter. Spring, summer, autumn, and winter each have their own divisions. Hence, the *Dàyào* [大要] states: 'The spring’s warmth becomes summer’s heat; autumn’s fury becomes winter’s rage. Scarcity follows the four directions, and omens converge—its end is visible, its beginning known.'*

*That text discusses the irregularity of counteracting *qi*; this one addresses the Five *qi* erupting out of season. Though their subjects differ—counteracting *qi* and Five eruptions—the meaning of *chā* [差] remains the same."*

The Emperor asked: *"Does this deviation have a fixed measure?"* —*"In days."*

Gēbó replied: *"After the seasons pass, it is thirty days with an excess of eighty-seven *kè* [刻] and a half."* —*"After" refers to the four seasons. The deviation is thirty days plus eighty-seven *kè* and a half, for the *qi* remains intense even after its expected departure.* —*"Degree" refers to days. Now, the seasons have passed.*

*—New Annotation:* The detailed note states that *"eighty-seven kè and a half"* should read *"forty-three kè and forty minutes."*

The Emperor asked: *"When the *qi* arrives early or late, what does this mean?"* —*"When it arrives before its expected time or after."*

Gēbó replied: *"Excessive *qi* arrives early; deficient *qi* arrives late—this is the norm in prognostication."*

The Emperor asked: *"What does it mean when the *qi* arrives precisely on time?"*

Gēbó replied: *"If it is neither excessive nor deficient, it arrives at the proper time. Otherwise, it is an omen of disaster."* —*"On time" refers to the exact day and *kè* [刻] of its expected arrival. Any arrival that deviates from this—whether early or late—is a sign of calamity.*

The Emperor said: *"Excellent. What does it mean when the *qi* transforms out of season?"*

Gēbó replied: *"Excessive *qi* transforms in advance of its time; deficient *qi* transforms after its time. Winter rains, spring coolness, autumn heat, and winter coldness—these are all cases of *qi* reverting to their own dominant phase."*

The Emperor asked: *"The Four Seasons’ *qi*, when they arrive, may be early or late, high or low, left or right. How should one interpret these variations?"*

Gēbó replied: *"Their movement may be contrary or顺顺, their arrival delayed or swift. Thus, excessive *qi* transforms in advance of the natural order, while deficient *qi* transforms after it. When *qi* is in excess, it transforms early; when *qi* is deficient, it transforms late."*

The Emperor asked: *"I wish to understand what is meant by 'its movement.'"*

Gēbó replied: *"Spring *qi* moves westward, summer *qi* moves northward, autumn *qi* moves eastward, and winter *qi* moves southward. Observe how all things grow, flourish, wither, and store themselves accordingly. Thus, spring *qi* begins from below, autumn *qi* begins from above, summer *qi* begins from the center, and winter *qi* begins from the periphery."*

The Emperor asked: *"How does the Dao/Way of the four seasons manifest in the highest or lowest places, and in the left or right? What are the signs of their arrival?"*

Gēbó replied: *"Spring *qi* begins from the left, autumn *qi* begins from the right, winter *qi* begins from behind, and summer *qi* begins from the front. This is the constant Dao/Way of the four seasons’ transformations. By observing things, one may discern this truth clearly.

Thus, in the highest lands, winter *qi* abides, while in the lowest lands, spring *qi* abides. On the peaks of lofty mountains, ice and snow linger even in high summer, and in the murky depths of valleys, grass sprouts in severe winter—these examples suffice to illustrate the principle of their constant presence."*

The Emperor said: *"Well spoken. The *yin* and *yang* of Heaven and Earth are visible to the eye—why then must one ponder the obscure and delve into laws, straining one’s intellect and wearying the heart without gain?"*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How do the five phases and six *qi* manifest in their transformations? What is the regular sequence of the six phases’ transformations and six variations’ cycles?"*

Gēbó replied: *"The six *qi* follow their regular cycles: each has its transformation, its variation, its dominance, its retreat, its efficacy, and its disorder. Their signs differ according to their season. What does Your Majesty wish to know?"*

The Emperor said: *"I wish to hear it all."*

Gēbó said: *"Let me expound fully. *Exhaustive* means *complete*."*

When the six *qi* arrive, the following transformations occur:

- Where *gùyīn* (厥阴) arrives, it brings *peaceful equilibrium* (和平), marking the *first* *qi* of the year, the transformation of *wood*.
- Where *shàoyīn* (少阴) arrives, it brings *radiant warmth* (暄), marking the *second* *qi*, the *master fire*.
- Where *tàiyīn* (太阴) arrives, it brings *dusty and damp* (埃褥), marking the *fourth* *qi*, the transformation of *earth*.
- Where *shàoyáng* (少阳) arrives, it brings *scorching heat* (炎暑), marking the *third* *qi*, the *minister fire*.
- Where *yángmíng* (阳明) arrives, it brings *clear and vigorous* (清劲), marking the *fifth* *qi*, the transformation of *metal*.
- Where *tàiyáng* (太阳) arrives, it brings *cold dew* (寒露), marking the *final* *qi* of the year, the transformation of *water*.

This is the constant Dao/Way of seasonal transformations.

The regular signs of the four seasons’ *qi* are as follows:

- When *gùyīn* arrives, it manifests as the *wind palace* (风府), and as *gentle cracks* (莹启)—*gentle* refers to *subtle fissures*, while *cracks* refers to *opening and scattering*.
- When *shàoyīn* arrives, it manifests as the *great fire palace* (大火府), and as *spreading and flourishing*.
- When *tàiyīn* arrives, it manifests as the *rain palace* (雨府), and as *fullness and abundance*—all things receiving *earth*’s transformation become plump and replete. Moreover, the *rain*’s boundary is a verdant green, and its pattern resembles concentric rings, making clear the transformation of *abundance*.
- When *shàoyáng* arrives, it manifests as the *heat palace* (热府), and as *emergence and movement*—those storing heat emerge in motion.
- When *yángmíng* arrives, it manifests as the *office of execution* (司杀府), and as *replenishing and withering*—*replenishing* refers to *replacement* or *change*, while *withering* refers to *substitution* or *succession*.
- When *tàiyáng* arrives, it manifests as the *cold palace* (寒府), and as *return and storage*—all things retreat to storage when cold.

This is the constant Dao/Way of *qi*’s governance.

The transformations of the six *qi* are as follows:

- Where *gùyīn* arrives, it generates *wind* and ends in *stillness*—wind arises from its transformation, hence *wind generated*; *stillness* means *tranquility*.
- Where *shàoyīn* arrives, it generates *heat* and then *cold*—heat arises from its transformation, hence *heat generated*; *yin* essence ascends from above, so the middle phase becomes cold.
- Where *tàiyīn* arrives, it generates *moisture* and ends in *pouring rain*—moisture arises from its transformation, hence *moisture generated*; *tàiyīn* being above, it culminates in *pouring rain*.
- Where *shàoyáng* arrives, it generates *fire* and ends in *steaming and dampness*—fire arises from its transformation, hence *fire generated*; *yang* being above, it culminates in *steaming moisture*.
- Where *yángmíng* arrives, it generates *dryness* and ends in *freezing*—dryness arises from its transformation, hence *dryness generated*; *yin* being above, it culminates in *freezing*.
- Where *tàiyáng* arrives, it generates *cold* and then *warmth*—cold arises from its transformation, hence *cold generated*; *yang* being within, the middle phase becomes warm.

This is the constant Dao/Way of *virtue/power*’s transformations.

The six transformations each govern their respective forms:

- *Wind* generates *hair-like* forms,
- *Heat* generates *feathery* forms,
- *Moisture* generates *protective* forms,
- *Fire* generates *winged* forms,
- *Dryness* generates *shell-like* forms,
- *Cold* generates *scaly* forms.

Each of these six transformations is the *master* seasonal *qi* and the *questionable* *qi* of its year, and their transformations generate their respective forms without fail.

「If not for *virtue/power*’s transformations, there would be no ability to generate changes. (翮, *xié*, pronounced *Hú-gé* cut)

When *guìyīn* (厥阴) arrives, it brings *hair-like* transformations (毛化), affecting beings with hair.
When *shàoyīn* (少阴) arrives, it brings *winged* transformations (羽化), affecting creatures with wings or feathery flight.
When *tàiyīn* (太阴) arrives, it brings *protective* transformations (保化), affecting beings without hair, wings, scales, or shells.
When *shàoyáng* (少阳) arrives, it brings *winged* transformations (羽化), such as thin, luminous wings or insect-like appendages—these are not the *feathers* (翎羽) of birds.
When *yángmíng* (阳明) arrives, it brings *shell-like* transformations (介化), affecting creatures with armored shells.
When *tàiyáng* (太阳) arrives, it brings *scaly* transformations (鳞化), affecting beings with scales.

This is the constant Dao/Way of *virtue/power*’s transformations.

When *guìyīn* arrives, it brings *generative* transformations (生化), *warm* transformations (温化).
When *shàoyīn* arrives, it brings *flourishing* transformations (荣化), *radiant* transformations (暄化).
When *tàiyīn* arrives, it brings *soaking* transformations (濡化), *moist* transformations (湿化).
When *shàoyáng* arrives, it brings *lush* transformations (茂化), *heat* transformations (热化).
When *yángmíng* arrives, it brings *solid* transformations (坚化), *freezing* transformations (冻化).
When *tàiyáng* arrives, it brings *concealing* transformations (藏化), *cold* transformations (寒化).

This is the constant Dao/Way of *virtue/power*’s governance.

When *guìyīn* arrives, it manifests as *whirling fury* (飘怒), great freezing; *whirling fury* (飘怒) is of *Wood* (木). Great freezing is the *Metal qi* (金气) that follows beneath.
When *shàoyīn* arrives, it manifests as *great radiance* (大暄), cold; *great radiance* (大暄) is the *Lord of Fire* (君火). Cold is the *yin essence* (阴精) that follows beneath.
When *tàiyīn* arrives, it manifests as *thunderous downpour* (雷霆骤注), violent winds; *thunderous downpour* (雷霆骤注) is of *Earth* (土). Violent winds are the *Wood qi* (木气) that follows beneath.
When *shàoyáng* arrives, it manifests as *whirling winds and scorching flames* (飘风墦燎), frost congealing; *whirling winds* (飘风) are winds that spin and turn. Frost congealing is the *Water qi* (水气) that follows beneath.
When *yángmíng* arrives, it manifests as *scattering and falling* (散落), warmth; *scattering and falling* (散落) is of *Metal* (金). Warmth is the *Fire qi* (火气) that follows beneath.
When *tàiyáng* arrives, it manifests as *cold snow and hail* (寒雪冰雹), white dust (白埃). Cold snow and hail are of *Water* (水). White dust is the *Earth qi* (土气) that follows beneath.

This is the constant Dao/Way of *qi*’s variations.
Variation refers to the *qi* deviating from its usual state to become extreme.
If extreme variations persist, then the *qi* beneath will also act in conjunction, hence none of these are the original *qi*.

When *guìyīn* arrives, it manifests as *twisting and agitation* (挠动), *welcoming and following* (迎随); these are the nature of *Wind* (風).
When *shàoyīn* arrives, it manifests as *high and bright flames* (高明焰), *perfuming* (熏); flames are *yang* flames. *Perfuming* (熏) is of reddish-yellow hue.
When *tàiyīn* arrives, it manifests as *deep and hidden* (沉阴), white dust (白埃), and *obscured and gloomy* (晦暝); this is darkness and dimness.
When *shàoyáng* arrives, it manifests as *radiance and visibility* (光显), *scarlet clouds* (彤云), and *dullness* (曛); *radiance* (光显) is lightning, flowing light, brightness. *Scarlet* (彤) is red. (The *yin* essence of *shàoyīn* aligns with this.)
When *yángmíng* arrives, it manifests as *smoky dust* (烟埃), frost (霜), *sharp and piercing* (劲切), and *chilling sounds* (凄鸣); this is *killing qi* (杀气).
When *tàiyáng* arrives, it manifests as *rigid and unyielding* (刚固), *sharp and piercing* (坚芒), and *erection* (立); this is *cold* transformations (寒化).

This is the constant Dao/Way of *virtue/power*’s decrees.
When *virtue/power*’s decrees are carried out, all things obey without resistance.

When *guìyīn* arrives, it manifests as *urgent bowel movements* (里急); this is due to *tendons and sinews contracting and shrinking* (筋练缩).
When *shàoyīn* arrives, it manifests as *ulcers and carbuncles* (疡胗), body heat; this is due to *Fire qi* (火气).
When *tàiyīn* arrives, it manifests as *accumulated fluids and blocked respiration* (积饮否隔); this is of *Earth qi* (土气).
When *shàoyáng* arrives, it manifests as *sneezing and vomiting* (嚏呕), *sores and ulcers* (疮疡); this is due to *Fire qi* (火气).
When *yángmíng* arrives, it manifests as *floating and empty* (浮虚); this is a thin swelling that collapses when pressed.
When *tàiyáng* arrives, it manifests as *difficulty in bending and stretching* (屈伸不利).

This is the constant Dao/Way of disease.

When *yin* arrives, it manifests as *branch-like pain* (支痛); *branch* (支) refers to *obstructed pillars* (柱妨).
When *shàoyīn* arrives, it manifests as *startle and confusion* (惊惑), *aversion to cold* (恶寒), *shivering and trembling* (战栗), *delirium* (谵妄); *delirium* (谵) refers to *speaking incoherently* (乱言), and the *shivering* (栗) should be corrected to *fierce* (慓).
When *tàiyīn* arrives, it manifests as *congestion and fullness* (蓄满).
When *shàoyáng* arrives, it manifests as *restlessness and agitation* (惊躁), *blindness and sudden illness* (瞀昧暴病).
When *yángmíng* arrives, it manifests as *□* (missing character), *damp and cold in the inguinal region* (炕阴股膝), *□□* (missing characters), *afflictions of the lower orifices* (腑足病).
When *tàiyáng* arrives, it manifests as *lumbar pain* (腰痛).

This is the constant Dao/Way of disease.

When *guìyīn* arrives, it manifests as *irritability and harshness* (緛戾).
When *shàoyīn* arrives, it manifests as *melancholy and hallucinations* (悲妄), *bleeding from the nose* (衄), *stained blood* (蔑); *stained* (蔑) also refers to *grease* (脂).
When *shàoyīn* arrives, it also manifests as *strong movement* (行劲).
When *tàiyīn* arrives, it manifests as *mid-abdominal fullness* (中满), *intermittent diarrhea and vomiting* (霍乱吐下).
When *shàoyáng* arrives, it manifests as *throat obstruction* (喉痹), *ear ringing and vomiting* (耳呜呕涌); *涌* (涌) refers to *regurgitation of food* (溢食不下).
When *yángmíng* arrives, it manifests as *rib pain and flaking skin* (胁痛皴揭), *body skin □* (missing character); *皴揭* (皴揭) refers to *flaking and peeling*.
When *tàiyáng* arrives, it manifests as *sleeping perspiration* (寝汗), *spasm* (痉); *sleeping perspiration* (寝汗) refers to *perspiration occurring between the chest and throat* (胸嗌), *neck and armpit* (颈掖) during sleep. Commonly mistakenly called *stealing perspiration* (盗汗). (痉, pronounced *Jù-yǐng* cut.)」

The common manifestations of disease are as follows:

When *juéyīn* arrives, it causes **rib pain and vomiting with diarrhea** (胁痛呕泄); *泄* (泄) refers to **diarrhea** (利).
When *shàoyīn* arrives, it causes **uncontrollable laughter and speech** (语笑).
When *tàiyīn* arrives, it causes **heavy, bloated swelling** (重驸肿); *驸肿* (驸肿) refers to **floating, soft edema that does not recede upon pressure** (肉泛#40, 按之不起).
When *shàoyáng* arrives, it causes **sudden gushing** (暴注), **□ spasm, □ violent death** (□瘛痣暴死).
When *yángmíng* arrives, it causes **□ sneezing** (□嚏).
When *tàiyáng* arrives, it causes **proliferating discharge and restricted movement** (流泄禁止).

These are the common manifestations of disease.

In all twelve such variations, **virtue is repaid with virtue, transformation with transformation, governance with governance, and command with command** (报德以德，报化以化，报政以政，报令以令). The **Dao/Way** ascends when high, descends when low, lags when delayed, precedes when early, centralizes when in the middle, and externalizes when outward—this is the **constant principle of position** (位之常). When the **Dao/Way** responds to virtue and transformation, it refers to the **heavenly-earthly qi** (天地气). When high, low, early, delayed, central, or outward, it refers to the **origins of disease** (生病所). The **yin and yang of the hands** (手之阴阳) are of **high qi** (其气高), while the **yin and yang of the feet** (足之阴阳) are of **low qi** (其气下). The **foot *tàiyáng*** (足太阳) **qi** is located **behind the body** (气在身后), the **foot *yángmíng*** (足阳明) **qi** is located **in front of the body** (气在身前), the **foot *shàoyīn*, *tàiyīn*, and *juéyīn*** (足少阴、太阴#41、厥阴) **qi** are located **within the body** (气在身中), and the **foot *shàoyáng*** (足少阳) **qi** is located **at the body’s sides** (气在身侧). Each follows its own position in speech, and **changes in qi generate disease symptoms** (气变生病象).

Thus, when **wind prevails, it causes movement, unrest** (风胜则动，不宁也).

The newly corrected text states: *"Examine the passage from 'Wind prevails, it causes movement' to 'Humidity prevails, it causes dampness and diarrhea'—it overlaps with the text of *The Grand Treatise on the Correspondence of Yin and Yang* (*阴阳应象大论*), yet the annotations differ.*

When **heat prevails**, it causes **swelling**. Heat prevailing over **qi** manifests as **erythema and purplish discoloration** (丹缥), over **blood** as **abscesses and pus**, and over **flesh and bone** as **hard, fixed swellings** (驸肿), which do not recede upon pressure.

When **dryness prevails**, it causes **dryness**. Dryness on the **exterior** causes **wrinkled, roughened skin**, while dryness on the **interior** causes **exhaustion of essence and blood**. When dryness affects **qi and body fluids**, the flesh becomes dry and the skin adheres to the bones.

When **cold prevails**, it causes **floating**—meaning the affected area rises upon palpation and subsides when released.

When **humidity prevails**, it causes **dampness and diarrhea**; in severe cases, it leads to **water retention and fixed swellings** (驸肿). *Dampness and diarrhea* refers to **fluid regulation**; *fixed swellings* mean the flesh is **distended**, and upon pressure, it sinks and does not rebound. *Water retention* causes **fluid to escape into the skin**.

These changes follow the **location of the qi** in their manifestations.

The Emperor said: *"I wish to hear their applications."*

Gebi replied: *"The functions of the six qi each return to what they do not overcome and transform. 'Functions' refers to their **application of transformative qi**.*

Thus, **Tàiyīn’s damp transformation** applies to **Tàiyáng**; **Tàiyáng’s cold transformation** applies to **Shàoyīn**; **Shàoyīn’s heat transformation** applies to **Yángmíng**; **Yángmíng’s dry transformation** applies to **Juéyīn**; **Juéyīn’s wind transformation** applies to **Tàiyīn**. Each governs its position to **diagnose accordingly**."

The Emperor said: *"What if they remain in their proper positions?"*

Gebi replied: *"When they remain in their proper positions, they undergo **constant transformation**."*

The Emperor said: *"I wish to know their locations."*

Gebi replied: *"By determining their positions, the corresponding month can be known. Following the qi’s location to establish direction, the six divisions of time and space will show no discrepancy."*

The Emperor said: *"How do the six positions of qi manifest in terms of excess and deficiency?"*

Gebi replied: *"They differ in excess and deficiency. **Excessive qi** arrives **gradually and steadily**, while **deficient qi** is **sudden and fleeting**. Though strong in onset, it cannot endure, hence its **violence and absence**."* (*Absence* means **non-existence**.)

The Emperor said: *"How do the qi of Heaven and Earth manifest in excess and deficiency?"*

Gebi replied: *"When Heaven’s qi is insufficient, Earth’s qi follows; when Earth’s qi is insufficient, Heaven’s qi follows. The **cyclical sequence** (*运*) operates within this, always preceding.*

*Sequence* refers to **Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water**, each governing the year. When Earth’s qi prevails, the **yearly sequence ascends**; when Heaven’s qi prevails, the **yearly sequence descends**. Ascension and descent of the sequence always precede **transformation and decline**.

What is not overcome **returns to harmony**; following the sequence, it generates disease. If it strays from its position, **variation arises**, and variation leads to **disease**.

Thus, when the **upper prevails**, Heaven’s qi descends below; when the **lower prevails**, Earth’s qi ascends above. *Prevails* means **excess**. When the upper is excessive, it **descends of its own accord**; when the lower is excessive, it **ascends of its own accord**. Excess and deficiency shift reciprocally—this is the **constant of qi**."

The newly corrected text states: *"According to *The Grand Treatise on the Six Microcosmic Principles* (*六微旨大论*), it says: 'Ascend until descending, descending until ascending. The descending refers to Heaven; the ascending refers to Earth.' When Heaven’s qi descends, it flows into Earth; when Earth’s qi ascends, it surges into Heaven. Thus, **high and low attract each other**, and **ascension and descent follow**, giving rise to **variation and change**—this is also the principle of ascension and descent.

Excess or deficiency **diverges from its proper measure**. When excessive, the **transformation and decline are pronounced**; when deficient, they are **subdued**. The responses of excess and deficiency vary—**subtle or severe**.

The subtle show **minor discrepancies**; the severe show **major discrepancies**. Severe cases may **displace the position** and **exchange the qi**, leading to **great variation and disease onset**.

*The Essential Treatise* (*大要*) states: *'Severe cases measure five parts; subtle cases measure seven parts—discrepancies are thus visible.'* This is what is meant.

The Emperor said: *"Excellent."* The text states: *'Do not apply heat to heat, nor cold to cold.'* I wish to avoid both **excessive cold and excessive heat**—how should I proceed?"

Gebi replied: *"Your question is thorough! **Inducing sweating** does not apply excessive heat; **purging or wrapping** does not apply excessive cold. Sweating **depletes heat**, so using heat does not **prolong heat**; diarrhea **depletes cold**, so using cold does not **prolong cold**. Both methods ensure the pathogen does not **linger internally**.

Thus, in summer, heat may be applied; in winter, cold may be applied. **Without sweating or purging**, there is no need to fear contraindications—this is **reckless treatment**, forbidden by principle. All such applications are **used only when unavoidable**."*

The newly corrected text states: *"According to *The Grand Treatise on Supreme Truth* (*至真要大论*), it says: 'Inducing sweating does not apply excessive heat; avoid violating **warmth and coolness**.'*

The Emperor said: *"If there is no sweating or purging, yet one violates cold or heat, what happens?"*

Gebi replied: *"Internal **cold and heat pathogens** worsen the disease. **Adding water to water**, **adding fire to fire**—this is sufficient to **generate new illness**, let alone exacerbating the original disease!"*

The Emperor said: *"How does this apply to those without disease?"*

Gebi replied: *"For the **disease-free**, violating prohibitions **can still induce illness**; how much more so for the **already ill**, who seek **light treatment**—is this not difficult?"*

The Emperor said: *"What of those who are **vulnerable to disease**?"*

Gebi replied: *"Avoiding excessive heat leads to **heat onset**; avoiding excessive cold leads to **cold onset**. When cold arrives, it causes **abdominal hardness, distension, urgent pain, and diarrhea**; **loss of appetite after eating**, foul vomiting and diarrhea—these are **cold-induced illnesses**.

When heat arrives, it causes **fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and cholera**; **abscesses, boils, and ulcers**; **lower abdominal distension and urinary difficulties**; **persistent edema**; **nausea, headache, joint pain, and muscle aches**; **bleeding and hematuria**; **dysuria and urinary retention**—these are **heat-induced illnesses**. **Sudden emaciation, aversion to food, disorientation, agitation, madness, and hallucinations**; **seizures, tetany, and convulsions**—these too are **heat-induced illnesses**."

The Emperor said: *"How should they be treated?"*

Qi Bo said: *"The seasons must be followed, and when they are violated, treatment is with their opposites. In spring, cooling is appropriate; in summer, coldness is appropriate; in autumn, warmth is appropriate; in winter, heat is appropriate—these are the suitable treatments for each season, and they must not be disregarded.

Yet when heat is violated, treat with cold; when cold is violated, treat with heat; when spring is violated, use cooling; when autumn is violated, use warmth—this is the principle of overcoming.

When heat is violated, treat with bitter-cold; when cold is violated, treat with sweet-warm; when freezing is violated, treat with pungent-warm; when warmth is violated, treat with acrid-cooling—these too are methods of overcoming.

The Yellow Emperor asked: 'How should pregnant women be treated with poisons?'*

Qi Bo replied: *'If there is a cause, they shall suffer no harm, nor shall the fetus be lost. By 'cause,' I mean cases of severe **abdominal hardness** (大坚症 *dàjiān zhèng*) with lingering symptoms, where the pain is extreme and unbearable—then treat with **accumulation-breaking** and **pain-relieving** medicines. This is called 'not treating' (不救 *bù jiù*), where the **fetal movement ceases** (爻死 *yáo sǐ*) and death is complete. But if one preserves the greater whole—the mother—even if she takes poison, she will not die. If the mother is unharmed, it means the child will not perish either. If the mother is harmed, it means the child will also not survive."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"I wish to hear the reasoning behind this. What is meant by 'cause'?"*

Qi Bo replied: *"Great accumulations and great masses—these may be treated, but only by reducing them by more than half; if one exceeds this, death will follow. Reducing them by more than half is insufficient to harm life, so even if the accumulation is vast, the medicine must be stopped at this point. If one oversteps the limit and waits until exhaustion, residual poisonous qi will remain inside, with no disease left to attack. When the poisonous medicine is exhausted, the poison will continue to assault, disrupting the central harmony—thus, exceeding the limit leads to death."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Excellent."*

*"When stagnation is severe, how should it be treated?"*

*"The movements of Heaven and Earth, the Five Phases, and their correspondence to the Dao—there are cases of extreme stagnation and suppression where things do not unfold naturally."*

Qi Bo replied: *"When wood is stagnant, release it; when fire is stagnant, vent it; when earth is stagnant, drain it; when metal is stagnant, disperse it; when water is stagnant, suppress it. Thus, one harmonizes the qi. Release means to induce vomiting, making it flow freely. Vent means to induce sweating, making it disperse. Drain means to purge, preventing obstruction. Disperse means to promote diuresis and relieve the surface, utilizing the small便. Suppress means to restrain and regulate its surging excess. These five methods—when applied, the qi may be balanced and adjusted. If there is excess, suppress it, for it is what is feared—this is called 'writing' (writing off). Excess means extreme excess. In cases of extreme excess, one counteracts with flavors: use salt to counteract the kidneys, sour to counteract the liver, pungent to counteract the lungs, sweet to counteract the spleen, and bitter to counteract the heart. Excess is what is feared, hence 'writing' is called 'fearing.'"*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What about false conditions?"*

Qi Bo replied: *"If one borrows qi, there are no prohibitions. When the true qi is insufficient, the pathogenic qi sinks and overwhelms it. One may borrow cold, heat, warmth, or freezing to supplement the four true qi—thus, one may treat heat with heat, cold with cold, warmth with warmth, and freezing with coolness. This is called 'the true qi being insufficient while the pathogenic qi prevails.' Pathogenic qi refers to the six external influences that temporarily dominate. True qi refers to the five viscera corresponding to the four seasons, ruling over spring, summer, autumn, and winter."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Profound indeed is the Dao of the sage! The great transformations of Heaven and Earth, the rhythms of their movements, the governance of their seasons, the policies of yin and yang, the commands of cold and heat—who but you could comprehend them? I request that this be stored in the sacred *Linglan Chamber*, to be titled *The Six Elemental Regulations*. It shall not be revealed without ritual purification, and its transmission must be cautious."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"The five *qi* converge and diverge in cycles of abundance and deficiency—I understand this. The six *qi* govern in division, overseeing Heaven and Earth. When they arrive, how do they manifest? The five *phases* dominate each year, with some years having more or less, hence the cycles of abundance and deficiency. As the *Great Record of Heaven’s Elements* states: ‘At first, excess proceeds, while deficiency follows; when deficient, excess follows.’ Thus, its meaning is:

Heaven distributes the six *qi*—the first three govern the boundless void, the three *qi* rule Heaven, and the terminal *qi* oversee Earth. Heaven and Earth generate and transform—this is the great order. Hence, it speaks of those governing Heaven and Earth; the remaining four are self-evident.

Qibo bowed twice in response: *"Your question is profound! The great order of Heaven and Earth is the correspondence between human and divine. The transformations of Heaven and Earth move the human and divine in harmony; though inner and outer differ, their correspondence is unified."*

The Emperor said: *"I wish to hear how the luminous above aligns with the obscure below—how does this work?"*

Qibo replied: *"This is the domain of the Dao and the doubt of the skilled practitioner. Without knowing its essence, its dispersion is boundless."*

The Emperor said: *"I wish to hear its Dao."*

Qibo said: *"When *Jueyin* governs Heaven, its transformation is by wind. It stirs and disperses, harmonizing *qi* to give rise to life. All things flourish and wither, transforming and decaying accordingly.

When *Shaoyin* governs Heaven, its transformation is by heat. The scorching steam nurtures growth, so all creatures thrive and flourish.

When *Taiyin* governs Heaven, its transformation is by dampness. Clouds and rain moisten and nourish, generating fluids and essences.

When *Shaoyang* governs Heaven, its transformation is by fire. Blazing and fierce, it melts away cold disasters.

When *Yangming* governs Heaven, its transformation is by dryness. The dryness proceeds, and nothing decays from dampness.

When *Taiyang* governs Heaven, its transformation is by cold—opposing the yang transformations."* [*New Annotation*: The note on "opposing the yang transformations" likely contains an error in the character *yang*. It refers to the diseases arising from the organ governed by the season.]

The liver-wood governs the east, the heart-fire the south, the spleen-earth the center, the lung-metal the west, and the kidney-water the north—these are the fixed positions of the five *zang*. Yet when the six *qi* dominate and the five *phases* arrive, if the *qi* do not harmonize, disease arises; if they harmonize, balance is achieved. Thus, it first speaks of the six *qi*’s dominion, then of the five *zang*’s ailments.

The Emperor asked: *"How does Earth transform?"*

Qibo replied: *"The same principles apply as when governing Heaven—all inquiries into *qi* follow this pattern. The six *qi* have inherent natures, so though their positions shift, their transformations and governance remain consistent."*

The Emperor asked: *"What is meant by ‘questioning the *qi*’?"*

Qibo replied: *"Those governing left and right are called ‘questioning the *qi*.’ The six *qi*’s transformations typically involve two *qi* governing Heaven and Earth, establishing the principles of auspiciousness, misfortune, victory, reversal, guest, and host within the year. The remaining four *qi* reside on the left and right. Thus, the *Great Treatise on Yin-Yang Correspondences* states: ‘Heaven and Earth are the upper and lower of all things; left and right are the pathways of yin and yang.’ This is what is meant.

The *qi* governing is called *substance transformation*—the *jin* cycle’s *qi*, occurring in *Yi-Geng* years. The *jian qi* is called *pure transformation*—when wind arises, strong and lofty, and grasses and trees are clear and resonant; this is the transformation of purity."* [*New Annotation*: The *Yangming* years of *Yi-Hai* are the first *qi*, the *Chen-Xu* years the second *qi*, the *Yin-Shen* years the fourth *qi*, and the *Chou-Wei* years the fifth *qi*.]

When *Taiyang* governs Heaven, it is a *cold transformation*—in *Chen-Xu* years, the atmosphere is stern and rigid, grim and unyielding, embodying the cold transformation. When governing the spring, it is a *salty transformation*—in *Chou-Wei* years, water governs the Earth *qi*, so the transformation follows saltiness.

The governing *qi* is called *dark transformation*—the *water phase*’s *qi*, occurring in *Bing-Xin* years. The *jian qi* is called *concealed transformation*—when yin congeals and things become clear and reserved, embodying the year’s transformation."* [*New Annotation*: In *Zi-Wu* years, *Taiyang* is the first *qi*; in *Yi-Hai* years, the second *qi*; in *Mao-You* years, the fourth *qi*; and in *Yin-Shen* years, the fifth *qi*.]

Thus, those who treat disease must clarify the six transformations’ governance, the five flavors and five colors’ origins, and what each *zang* requires. Only then can one speak of the sequences of abundance, deficiency, and disease.

The Emperor said: *"I know that when *Jueyin* governs the spring, the sour transformation precedes it. How does the wind transformation proceed?"*

Qibo replied: *"Wind moves upon Earth—this is its root. The remaining *qi* follow the same principle."*

「When *Jueyin* is in *Quan* [the source], wind moves upon Earth.
When *Shaoyin* is in *Quan*, heat moves upon Earth.
When *Taiyin* is in *Quan*, dampness moves upon Earth.
When *Shaoyang* is in *Quan*, fire moves upon Earth.
When *Yangming* is in *Quan*, dryness moves upon Earth.
When *Taiyang* is in *Quan*, cold moves upon Earth.
Thus, it is said that the remaining *qi* follow the same principle.

The **root** refers to the original *qi* of the six *qi* [cosmic energies].
That which originates from Heaven is Heaven’s *qi*, that which originates from Earth is Earth’s *qi*.
That which transforms in Heaven becomes Heaven’s *qi*, that which transforms on Earth becomes Earth’s *qi*.
[*New Annotation*: As the *Yijing* [Classic of Changes] states: "That which originates from Heaven is close to the upper [Heaven], that which originates from Earth is close to the lower [Earth]." This is what is meant.]

When Heaven and Earth combine their *qi*, the six *nodes* [phases] divide to give rise to all things.
All things dwell between Heaven and Earth, all being generated and transformed by the six *qi*.
The functions of yin and yang never escape generation and transformation, nor can they avoid being yin or yang.
Thus, it is said: *"Carefully observe the suitable *qi*, and do not miss the mechanisms of disease."* This is what is meant.
[The mechanisms of disease will be fully explained in the following passages.]

The Emperor said: *"What governs the diseases?"* [Referring to the years in which one harvests medicine.]

Qibo replied: *"If one attends to the seasons and gathers all things, there will be no oversight in their governance.
Carefully observe what Heaven and Earth generate and transform, and the flavors of the medicines will align with their respective seasons.
Thus, if a medicine is specialized for a particular seasonal *qi*, the herbs gathered in that year or the next will serve their intended purpose without fail.
[*New Annotation*: Here, *zé* [则] should be read as *yòng* [用].]

The Emperor said: *"What of the things from the previous year?"*

Qibo replied: *"They are the concentrated essence of Heaven and Earth.
The *qi* of concentrated essence, when used, makes medicines rich and potent, aligning with their proper seasonal flavors."*

[*New Annotation*: Here, *xiān suì* [先岁] is likely a misreading and should be *sī suì* [司岁].]

The Emperor said: *"What of those who govern the *qi*?"* [Referring to those who oversee the seasonal *qi* cycles.]

Qibo replied: *"Those who govern the *qi* [seasonal cycles] align with the seasons’ governance, yet there are years of excess or deficiency.
The five *Yùn* [transitions] govern the seasons, with excess or deficiency—compared to the seasonal things, there may be years of scarcity.
In years of excess, medicines are concentrated and potent."*

The Emperor said: *"If not aligned with the seasonal governance, what then?"*

Qibo replied: *"They are dispersed.
If not concentrated, then the *qi* is dispersed, and the things are not pure.
Thus, even if their forms and substances are the same, their efficacy and application differ, so they are not valued equally.

The *qi* and flavors have degrees of strength or weakness, their nature has qualities of agitation or calmness,
their treatment has varying degrees of intensity, and their transformative power has limits of depth and reach.
This is what is meant.

When things do not align with the seasons, what then?"

The Emperor said: *"What does it mean when the seasons govern the *zàng* [organs] and cause harm?"*

Qibo replied: *"When the *qi* that should not dominate prevails, this is the key principle.
For example, wood does not dominate metal, metal does not dominate fire—this is the pattern.
The Emperor said: *"How should one treat this?"*

Qibo replied: *"When the upper [Heavenly] *qi* dominates the lower [Earthly],
the *qi* that should dominate is used to balance it.
When the external [Earthly] *qi* dominates the internal [Heavenly],
the *qi* that should dominate is used to treat it.
[*New Annotation*: When Heaven’s *qi* governs the season, even if there is excess or dominance,
one must balance and regulate it, hence it is called *píng* [平] rather than *zhì* [治].]

The Emperor said: *"Good."* How does one balance the *qi*?"

Qibo replied: *"Balance refers to diagnosing the harmonious *qi* of yin and yang.
Carefully observe where yin and yang reside and regulate accordingly, aiming for balance.
If the disease is straightforward, treat it directly; if it is contrary, treat it oppositely.
Knowing where yin and yang reside allows one to discern whether the pulse at the *cùnkǒu* [wrist] aligns or does not align with the *shíchù* [radial positions].
Not knowing where yin and yang reside means taking alignment for misalignment and opposing for compliance.
Thus, one must examine carefully.

When yin is diseased and yang is not, or when yang is diseased and yin is not,
this is called **straightforward disease**, and one treats it directly—
meaning to treat heat with cold and cold with heat—
when the *yin position* [pulse] already shows signs of *yang caò* [yang excess],
and the *yang position* [pulse] again shows signs of *yin caò* [yin excess],
this is called **contrary disease**, and one treats it oppositely—
meaning to treat cold with cold and heat with heat.
All prescriptions follow this principle, hence it is said: *"If contrary, treat it oppositely."*

The Emperor said: *"Master Qibo spoke of observing where yin and yang reside and regulating accordingly.
The theory states that the pulse at *rényíng* [carotid] aligns with the *cùnkǒu* [wrist],
and if the pulse is measured equal in size, it is called *píng* [balanced].
[*New Annotation*: Here, the theory states that on the day of balance, the pulse is measured at the *cùnkǒu* [wrist],
originating from the *Língshū* [Miraculous Pivot], now taken from the *Jiāyǐ Jīng* [Canon of the A-B Branches], which reads *cùn* [寸].]

The *cùnkǒu* [wrist] governs the center, while *rényíng* [carotid] governs the exterior.
When both align—rising and falling together—
and if measured equal in size, like a taut string,
then in spring and summer, *rényíng* is slightly larger,
and in autumn and winter, *cùnkǒu* is slightly larger.
The pulse that is slightly larger is called *píng* [balanced].

When yin resides, how does the *cùnkǒu* [wrist pulse] appear?
When yin resides, the pulse is deep and does not respond [to pressure],
and if measured equal in size, the symptoms are greatly misaligned—
thus the question is asked to clarify this.»

Qibo replied: *"Observe whether the season faces south or north, and it can be known.

In the **Northern-facing seasons** [winter and autumn], when *Shaoyin* is in *Quan* [the source],
the *cùnkǒu* [wrist pulse] does not respond.
In the years of the *Yùn* [transitions] of wood, fire, metal, and water,
facing north to receive the *qi*, all *qi* in *Quan* [the source] are imperceptible in the pulse,
only the *qi* of its adjacent seasons are visible.
If the *qi* in *Quan* is benign, the pulse will not show it;
if it is harmful, the pulse will reveal it.
Diseases are named according to the *qi* and the guest-host [interactions] of excess or dominance.
The same applies to the *qi* of Heaven.

When *Jueyin* is in *Quan*, the right [pulse] does not respond to the second [season].
This is because *Shaoyin* resides on the right.

When *Taiyin* is in *Quan*, the left [pulse] does not respond.
This is because *Shaoyin* resides on the left.

In the **Southern-facing seasons** [spring and summer], when *Shaoyin* governs Heaven,
the *cùnkǒu* [wrist pulse] does not respond.
In the years of the *Yùn* [transition] of earth,
facing south to issue commands, *Shaoyin* governs Heaven,
and thus the *cùnkǒu* [wrist pulse] of both hands does not respond.»

When **Jueyin** governs Heaven, the right [pulse] does not respond;
when **Taiyin** governs Heaven, the left [pulse] does not respond.
This is also the principle of left and right [correspondence].

All cases where the pulse does not respond,
when reversed in diagnosis, will reveal themselves.
Non-responsive pulses are all [manifestations of] *depressed* pulses;
when the depressed pulse is found below [the wrist],
lift the hand to observe it—
when the hand is inverted, the depressed pulse becomes *floating*,
and the fine pulse becomes *large*.

The Emperor said: How about the *chi* [cubit] pulse?
Giber [Qibo] replied:
In the **Northern-facing seasons** [autumn and winter],
when the *three Yin* [pulses] are below [the wrist],
the *cùnkǒu* [wrist pulse] does not respond;
when the *three Yin* [pulses] are above [the wrist],
the *chi* [cubit] pulse does not respond.
When governing Heaven, [the pulse] is above;
when in *Quan* [the deep layer], [the pulse] is below.
In the **Southern-facing seasons** [spring and summer],
when the *three Yin* [pulses] are in Heaven,
the *cùnkǒu* [wrist pulse] does not respond;
when the *three Yin* [pulses] are in *Quan* [the deep layer],
the *chi* [cubit] pulse does not respond.
The left and right [principles] are the same.

When the *chi* [cubit] pulse does not respond to the *cùnkǒu* [wrist pulse],
the left and right [pulses] all follow the same principle as the *cùnkǒu* [wrist pulse] not responding.
Thus it is said:
*"He who knows the essentials can conclude in a single word;
he who does not know the essentials will ramble endlessly without reaching the point."*
This is what is meant.

The essentials refer to knowing the location of *Yin* and *Yang*.
To know [them] is to apply [diagnosis] without confusion;
to not know [them] is to lose the *chi* [cubit] and *cùnkǒu* [wrist pulse],
and the distinctions of *depressed* and *floating*, *fine* and *large*,
which always shift every three years.
If one seeks to grasp its meaning,
it is like circling a tree to ask about its branches—
even if one grows old with endless questioning,
one will still not know where to go,
let alone comprehend it in months or years!

The Emperor said: Excellent.
When the *qi* of Heaven and Earth is internally **excessive** [淫], how do diseases manifest?

Qibo replied:
In the years when **Jueyin** is in *Quan* [the deep layer],
where the **Wood** element is dominant and **overpowers** [克] the **Spleen** and **Stomach**,
the *qi* of Earth becomes obscured,
and the plains appear dim.
Grasses sprout early.
The people suffer from **shaking chills** [洒洒振寒],
frequent stretching and yawning,
**heart pain** and **flank distension** [支满],
**rib-side constriction** [两胁裹急],
**inability to swallow food** [饮食不下],
**obstruction of the throat** [鬲咽不通],
**nausea upon eating** [食则呕],
**abdominal distension** with **frequent belching** [腹胀善噫],
and when they encounter the **posterior** *qi* [of the season],
they feel **immediate relief**, as if **withered** [衰],
but their bodies are **heavy** [皆重].

These are the years of **Jia-Yin, Bing-Yin, Wu-Yin, Geng-Yin, Ren-Yin, Jia-Shen, Bing-Shen, Wu-Shen, Geng-Shen, and Ren-Shen**.

When the *qi* of Earth is obscured,
it means that at the **boundary of Heaven and Earth** [天围之际],
the *qi* appears **dim** [气色昏暗],
and the **Wood** *qi* [风] spreads across the Earth,
so the plains all exhibit this dimness.
*Dim* refers to **darkness** [暗].
*Rib-side* [胁] refers to the **area beneath the breasts** and **flanks** [两乳之下及腋外].
*Stretching* [伸] refers to the **action of straining muscles and bones** [以欲伸努筋骨].

In the years when **Jueyin** is in *Quan* [the deep layer],
where the **Fire** element is dominant and **overpowers** [克] the **Metal** element,
**flames rise over rivers and lakes** [焰浮川泽],
and **Yin** regions appear **unexpectedly bright** [阴处反明].
The people suffer from **constant rumbling in the abdomen** [腹中常呜],
**rising *qi* that assaults the chest** [气上冲胸],
**shortness of breath** that prevents them from standing for long,
**skin pain** with **alternating cold and heat** [寒热皮肤痛],
**eye pain** and **toothache** [目瞑齿痛],
**neck swelling** [项肿],
**chills and fever resembling malaria** [恶寒发热如疟],
**lower abdominal pain** [少腹中痛],
**abdominal distension** [腹大],
**rectal prolapse** [垫虫不藏].

These are the years of **Yi-Mao, Ding-Mao, Ji-Mao, Xin-Mao, Gui-Mao, Yi-You, Ding-You, Ji-You, Xin-You, and Gui-You**.

*Yin* regions refer to the **North** [北方].
*Cannot stand for long* means **weakness in the legs** [足无力].
*Abdominal distension* refers to **insufficient *heart qi*** [心气不足].
This is due to the **interaction between Water and Fire** [金火相薄].

---
In the years when **Taiyin** is in *Quan* [the deep layer],
where the **Earth** element is dominant and **overpowers** [克] the **Taiyang** [Foot Greater Yang],
**grasses flourish early** [草乃早荣],
and the *qi* of **dampness** [湿] is excessive,
**mist veils cliffs and valleys** [埃昏岩谷],
**yellow turns black** [黄反见黑],
reaching the **peak of Yin** [至阴之交].
The people suffer from **fluid accumulation** [饮积],
**heart pain** and **deafness** [心痛耳聋],
**dull and heavy sensations** [浑浑惇惇],
**throat and neck obstruction** [嗑肿喉痹],
**Yin-related blood disorders** [阴病血见],
**lower abdominal pain and swelling** [少腹痛肿],
**inability to urinate** [不得小便],
**diseases that surge upward causing headache** [病冲头痛],
**eyes appearing to fall out** [目似脱],
**neck appearing to be pulled taut** [项似拔],
**waist appearing to be broken** [腰似折],
**organs unable to return to normal** [脏不可以回],
**knees feeling knotted** [胭如结],
**rectum feeling separated** [端如别].

These are the years of **Jia-Chen, Bing-Chen, Wu-Chen, Geng-Chen, Ren-Chen, Jia-Xu, Bing-Xu, Wu-Xu, Geng-Xu, and Ren-Xu**.

Taiyin corresponds to **Earth** [土],
and when its **color** [黄] appears in the **Heavenly center** [天中],
it instead appears in the **northern black regions** [北方黑处].
When **Water** and **Earth** *qi* [colors] merge,
the **season reaches the peak of Yin** [日至阴之交],
and their *qi* and color combine.

*Diseases that surge upward causing headache* refers to **pain behind the brain and between the eyebrows** [脑后眉问痛].
*Bing* [胭] refers to the **back of the knees** [膝后曲脚之中].
*End* [端] refers to the **soft flesh behind the anus** [腑后软肉处].

When the **Shao-Yang** [少阳] is in the **Spring** [泉],
and **Fire** [火] is in excess,
then **flames blaze across the countryside** [焰明郊野],
and **chills and fevers alternate** [寒热更至].

The people suffer from **diarrhea with blood and mucus** [注泄赤白],
**lower abdominal pain** [少腹痛],
**bloody urine** [溺赤],
and in severe cases, **hemorrhoidal bleeding** [血便].
The symptoms align with **Shao-Yin** [少阴].

These are the years of **Yi-Si, Ding-Si, Ji-Si, Xin-Si, Gui-Si, Yi-Hai, Ding-Hai, Ji-Hai, Xin-Hai, and Gui-Hai**.

During the **cold season** [处寒之时],
**heat intensifies the *qi*** [热更其气],
and when the **heat dissipates** [热气既往],
**cold *qi* follows** [寒气后来],
hence the alternation [故云更至也].
The remaining symptoms match those of **Shao-Yin in the Spring**.

When **Yang-Ming** [阳明] is in the **Spring** [泉],
and **Dryness** [燥] is in excess,
then **mist obscures the sky** [雾雾清暝].

The people suffer from **nausea with a bitter taste** [喜呕，呕有苦],
**frequent sighing** [善太息],
**pain in the heart and ribs** [心胁痛] that prevents turning,
and in severe cases, **dry, dusty skin** [嗑乾面尘],
**lack of luster** [身无膏泽],
and **outer edges of the feet feeling hot** [足外反热].

These are the years of **Jia-Zi, Bing-Zi, Wu-Zi, Geng-Zi, Ren-Zi, Jia-Wu, Bing-Wu, Wu-Wu, Geng-Wu, and Ren-Wu**.

**Mist and dew** [露雾] refers to **a hazy, indistinct atmosphere** [露暗不分，似雾也].
**Thin cold** [清] denotes **a light chill** [薄寒也].
It describes **mist rising, obscuring forms, and a faint cold** [言雾起露暗，不辨物形而薄寒也].
**Pain in the heart and ribs** [心胁痛] refers to **pain beside the heart, in the ribcage** [心之傍，胁中痛也].
**Dusty face** [面尘] means **a face appearing as if dusted with dirt** [面上如有触冒尘土之色也].

When **Tai-Yang** [太阳] is in the **Spring** [泉],
and **Cold** [寒] is in excess,
then **the air grows dense and still, with a chilling dread** [凝肃惨栗].

The people suffer from **lower abdominal pain radiating to the testicles** [少腹控睪],
**pulling at the waist and spine** [引腰脊],
**pain shooting upward to the heart** [上冲心痛],
**visible blood** [血见],
and **severe pain with swollen jaw** [隘痛颔肿].

These are the years of **Yi-Chou, Ding-Chou, Ji-Chou, Xin-Chou, Gui-Chou, Yi-Wei, Ding-Wei, Ji-Wei, Xin-Wei, and Gui-Wei**.

**Dense and still** [凝肃] refers to **cold *qi* lingering in the air, motionless** [寒气霭空，凝而不动],
while **chilling dread** [惨栗] signifies **extreme cold** [寒甚也].
**Pulling** [控] means **drawing or dragging** [引也].

The **testicles** [睪] are the **ninth of the Yang organs** [阴九也].
The **jaw** [颌] refers to **the teeth beneath the cheek and upper lip** [颊车前牙之下也].

○The newly corrected version states: According to the *Jia-Yi Jing* [《甲乙经》], **deafness with pain and swollen jaw** [哑痛颌肿] is a **disease of the Small Intestine** [小肠病].
Again, **lower abdominal pain drawing upward** [少腹控举], **pulling at the waist and spine** [引腰脊], **and shooting upward to the heart and lungs** [上冲心肺]—when the **pathogenic factor resides in the Small Intestine** [邪在小肠也]—are all symptoms of the same.
Indeed, in years when **Tai-Yang** [太阳] is in the **Spring** [泉], **Water overcomes Fire** [水克火], and thus the diseases manifest as such.

The **Emperor** [帝] said: **"Well spoken"** [善].
How should they be treated?

**Qi-Bo** [岐伯] replied:
When **all *qi* is in the Spring** [诸气在泉], and **Wind excesses internally** [风淫於内],
treat with **pungent-cold** [辛冻], **assist with bitter** [佐以苦],
**use sweet to moderate it** [以甘缓之], **and use pungent to disperse it** [以辛散之];
Wind **naturally favors warmth and abhors cold** [风性喜温而恶清],
so treatment with **cooling** [凉] is to **subdue the pathogenic factor** [是以胜气治之也].
Assist with **bitter**, following **its therapeutic advantage** [随其所利也].
When **bitterness is too harsh** [木苦急], then **use sweet to moderate it** [则以甘缓之].
When **bitterness suppresses excessively** [苦抑], then **use pungent to disperse it** [则以辛散之].

The *Cang-Qi Fa-Shi Lun* [《藏气法时论》] states:
**The Liver suffers from bitter harshness** [肝苦急], so **urgently consume sweet to moderate it** [急食甘以缓之].
**The Liver desires dispersion** [肝欲散], so **urgently consume pungent to disperse it** [急食辛以散之].
This is the principle.

**Consume** [食] is also pronounced **as *si*** [饲], meaning **to eat on the *ji* day** [己日食], **or to feed on other days** [他日饲也].
The **primary method aligns with these flavors** [大法正味如此],
but **all prescriptions** [诸为方者] do not **exhaustively use them** [不铃尽用之],
merely **applying one or two secondary flavors** [但#8一佐二佐],
then **ceasing when the disease is resolved** [病已则止].
The same applies to **all pathogenic factors** [余气皆然].

When **Heat excesses internally** [热淫於内],
treat with **salty-cold** [咸寒], **assist with sweet-bitter** [佐以甘苦],
**use sour to astringe it** [以酸收之], **and use bitter to induce it** [以苦发之];
Heat **naturally abhors cold** [热性恶寒], so **treatment with coldness subdues it** [故治以寒也].
When **Heat is excessively severe** [热之大盛],
and **overwhelms the exterior** [甚於表者],
**use bitter to induce it** [以苦发之];
If the **Heat is not fully resolved** [不尽],
then **apply cold again to suppress it** [复寒制之];
If the **cold suppression is not complete** [寒制不尽],
then **use bitter again to induce it** [复苦发之];
**Finally, use sour to astringe it** [以酸收之].
For **severe cases**, use **two prescriptions** [甚者再方],
for **mild cases**, use **one prescription** [微者一方],
so as to **fully resolve the pathogenic factor** [可使铃已].
When **Heat flares intermittently** [时发时止],
also **use sour to astringe it** [亦以酸收之].

When **Dampness excesses internally** [湿淫於内],
treat with **bitter-warm** [苦热], **assist with sour-mild** [佐以酸淡],
**use bitter to dry it** [以苦燥之], **and use mild to drain it** [以淡泄之];
Dampness **contrasts with dryness** [湿与燥反],
so **treatment with bitter-warm is assisted by sour-mild** [故治以苦热，佐以酸淡也].
Bitter **removes Dampness** [燥除湿], so **use bitter to dry its Dampness** [故以苦燥其湿也].
Mild **facilitates orifices** [淡利窍], so **use mild to permeate and drain** [故以淡渗泄也].

The *Cang-Qi Fa-Shi Lun* [《藏气法时论》] states:
**The Spleen suffers from Dampness** [脾苦湿], so **urgently consume bitter to dry it** [急食苦以燥之].
The *Ling-Shu Jing* [《灵枢经》] states:
**Mildness facilitates orifices** [淡利窍也].
The *Sheng-Qi Tong-Tian Lun* [《生气通天论》] states:
**When flavor is excessively bitter** [味过於苦],
**the Spleen’s *qi* is not nourished** [脾气不濡],
**and the Stomach’s *qi* becomes dense** [胃气乃厚].
This **clarifies bitterness’s drying effect** [明苦燥也].

○The newly corrected version states: According to the *Liu-Yuan Zheng-Ji Da-Lun* [《六元正纪大论》]:
**When subduing the Lower Tai-Yin** [下太阴],
**its transformation is with mild-warm** [其化下甘温].

When **Fire excesses internally** [火淫於内],
treat with **salty-clear** [咸玲], **assist with bitter-pungent** [佐以苦辛],
**use sour to astringe it** [以酸收之], **and use bitter to induce it** [以苦发之];
Fire **greatly agitates the heart and abdomen** [火气大行心腹],
**a product of the Heart’s anger** [心怒之所生也],
**salty flavor is soft and yielding** [咸性柔软],
so **use it to treat the Heart** [故以治之], **and use sour to astringe it** [以酸收之].
The **primary method** [大法] **supports those needing sweating** [侯其须汗者],
**using pungent to assist it** [以辛佐之],
**without relying on bitter flavor to induce sweating** [不叉要资苦味令其汗也].
For **those desiring softness and yielding** [欲柔软者],
**use salty to treat them** [以咸治之].
The *Cang-Qi Fa-Shi Lun* [《藏气法时论》] states:
**The Heart desires softness** [心欲软], so **urgently consume salty to soften it** [急食咸以软之].
**The Heart suffers from sluggishness** [心苦缓], so **urgently consume sour to astringe it** [急食酸以收之].
This is the principle.

When **Dryness excesses internally** [燥淫於内],
treat with **bitter-warm** [苦温], **assist with sour-pungent** [佐以甘辛],
**use bitter to subdue it** [以苦下之];
Warmth **facilitates the cold nature** [温利冻性],
so **use bitter to treat it** [故以苦治之].
**Subdue** [下] means **to guide its therapeutic advantage** [谓利之使不得也].

○The newly corrected version states: According to the *Cang-Qi Fa-Shi Lun* [《藏气法时论》]:
**The Lung suffers from rebellious *qi* rising** [肺苦气上逆], so **urgently consume bitter to drain it** [急食苦以泄之].
**Use pungent to disperse it** [以辛写之], **and use sour to supplement it** [以酸补之].
Again, according to the **following text** [下文], when **Dryness overcomes the Lung in the *Si-Tian* phase** [司天燥淫所胜],
**it is assisted with sour-pungent** [佐以酸辛],
but here it states **sweet-pungent** [此云甘辛者], where **sweet** [甘] may be a **misprint for sour** [字疑当作酸].
The *Tian-Yuan Zheng-Ji Da-Lun* [《天元正纪大论》] states:
**Subdue with sour-heat** [下酸热].
This **differs from the bitter-warm treatment** [与苦温之治又异].
It also states:
**Use sour to astringe it and stabilize the lower** [以酸收之而安其下],
**for severe cases, use bitter to drain it** [甚则以苦泄之].

When **Cold excesses internally** [寒淫於内],
treat with **sweet-warm** [甘热], **assist with bitter-pungent** [佐以苦辛],
**use salty to disperse it** [以咸写之], **use pungent to moisten it** [以辛润之], **and use bitter to solidify it** [以苦坚之].
**Use warmth to treat Cold** [以热治寒] is to **crush and subdue its *qi*** [摧胜],
**to prevent its proliferation** [折其气用],
**and to ensure it does not flourish further** [令不滋繁也].
The **assistance of bitter and pungent** [苦辛之佐] **facilitates their therapeutic function** [通事行之].

○The newly corrected version states: According to the *Cang-Qi Fa-Shi Lun* [《藏气法时论》]:
**The Kidney suffers from Dryness** [肾苦燥], so **urgently consume pungent to moisten it** [急食辛以润之].
**The Kidney desires solidity** [肾欲坚], so **urgently consume bitter to solidify it** [急食苦以坚之].
**Use bitter to supplement it** [用苦补之], **and use salty to disperse it** [咸写之].
The **old annotation** [旧注] **incorrectly cited this under Dampness excessing internally** [引此在湿淫於内之下],
**lacking logical coherence** [无义],
so it is **now moved here** [今移於此].

The **Emperor** [帝] said: **"Well spoken"** [善].
How does **the variation of Heaven’s *qi*** [天气之变] manifest?

Qi Bó said: When the **Jué-Yīn** [厥阴] **controls Heaven** [司天], **excessive Wind** [风淫] **prevails** [所胜], then **the Supreme Void** [太虚] **is obscured by dust and murkiness** [埃昏], and **clouds and phenomena are in turmoil** [云物以扰].
**Cold arises in Spring *qi*** [寒生春气], **flowing waters do not freeze** [流水不冰].
The people suffer from **pain in the stomach cavity** [胃院] **at the center of the chest** [当心而痛], **radiating upward to the two flanks** [上支两胁], **blockage in the throat and epiglottis** [鬲咽不通], **inability to swallow food** [食不下], **stiffness of the tongue’s root** [舌本强], **nausea upon eating** [食则呕], **prolapse of the rectum** [玲泄] **with abdominal distension** [腹胀], **diarrhea alternating with constipation** [泄痕水闭], **intestinal worms failing to emerge** [垫虫不出].
The root of the illness lies in the **Spleen** [脾].
This refers to the years **Yǐ-Sì** [乙巳], **Dīng-Sì** [丁巳], **Jǐ-Sì** [己巳], **Xīn-Sì** [辛巳], **Guǐ-Sì** [癸巳], **Yǐ-Hài** [乙亥], **Dīng-Hài** [丁亥], **Jǐ-Hài** [己亥], **Xīn-Hài** [辛亥], and **Guǐ-Hài** [癸亥].
In these years, **illnesses converge in the center** [民病集於中].
Wind descends from Heaven, so **the Supreme Void is stirred by dust** [故太虚埃起].
Wind moves and scatters, thus **clouds and phenomena are in turmoil** [故云物扰].
**Dust** [埃] refers to **greenish haze** [青尘].
When distant objects cannot be distinguished, it is called **dusty murkiness** [埃昏].
When **Earth** [土] **manifests as illness**, its tendency is **prolapse and diarrhea** [其善泄利].
If **water-related symptoms** [病水] occur, then **urine retention** [小便闭] **prevents its passage** [而不下].
If there is **severe prolapse and diarrhea** [大泄利], then **menstrual flow may also be obstructed or absent** [经水亦多闭绝].
○The newly corrected version states: According to the *Jia-Yi Jing* [《甲乙经》]:
**Stiffness of the tongue’s root** [舌本强], **nausea upon eating** [食则呕], **abdominal distension with chronic diarrhea** [腹胀沧泄], **urine retention** [痕水闭]—these are **Spleen diseases** [为脾病].
Furthermore, **stomach diseases** [胃病者] manifest as **abdominal distension with Spleen involvement** [腹脾胀], **pain in the stomach cavity at the center of the chest** [胃院当心而痛], **radiating upward to the two flanks** [上支两胁], **blockage in the throat and epiglottis** [两咽不通], **inability to swallow food or drink** [食饮不下].
Indeed, in the years when **Jué-Yīn controls Heaven** [厥阴司天], **Wood overcomes Earth** [木胜土], so the diseases are as described.
If the **Chōng-Yáng pulse** [冲阳] **fails**, **death is inevitable** [死不治].
The **Chōng-Yáng pulse** [冲阳] is located on the **upper side of the foot** [足附上], where the artery responds to pressure by hand—this is the **stomach’s *qi*** [胃之气].
When the **Chōng-Yáng pulse is faint** [冲阳脉微], **food and drink intake diminishes** [食饮喊少].
If it **fails completely** [绝], **medicines and food cannot enter** [药食不入], and there is **severe diarrhea** [亦下叉]—**a critical condition** [还出].
If **attacked but unable to absorb nourishment** [攻之不入], **if nourished but unable to grow** [养之不生], **pathogenic *qi* strengthens daily** [邪气日强], **while true *qi* is internally exhausted** [真气内绝], then **death is certain** [故其必死], **with no hope of recovery** [不可复].

When the **Shào-Yīn** [少阴] **controls Heaven** [司天], **excessive Heat** [热淫] **prevails** [所胜], then **irritating heat spreads** [怫热至], **Fire executes its function** [火行其], and the people suffer from **chest discomfort and heat** [胸中烦热], **dry throat** [嗑乾], **right flank fullness** [右肚满], **skin lesions** [皮肤], **alternating chills and fever with coughing and wheezing** [寒热咳喘], **imminent heavy rainfall** [大雨且至].
They experience **sputum with blood** [唾血], **bloody diarrhea** [血泄], **frequent sneezing and vomiting** [凯趣嚏呕], **urine color changes** [溺色变].
In severe cases, **ulcers and abscesses** [疮疡] **with localized swelling** [驸肿], **pain in the shoulders, back, arms, and supraclavicular region** [及缺盆中痛], **heartache and lung tension** [心痛肺缜], **abdominal distension and bloating** [腹大满膨], **wheezing and coughing upon distension** [膨而喘咳]—the root of the illness lies in the **Lungs** [肺].
This refers to the years **Jiā-Zǐ** [甲子], **Bǐng-Zǐ** [丙子], **Wù-Zǐ** [戊子], **Gēng-Zǐ** [庚子], **Rén-Zǐ** [壬子], **Jiā-Wǔ** [甲午], **Bǐng-Wǔ** [丙午], **Wù-Wǔ** [戊午], **Gēng-Wǔ** [庚午], and **Rén-Wǔ** [壬午].
**Irritating heat spreads** [怫热至], **for Fire governs its affairs thus** [是火行其政乃尔].
In these years, **illnesses converge on the right side** [民病集於右], **as the Small Intestine communicates with the Heart** [盖以小肠通心故].
The illness originates in the **Lungs** [肺], hence it is said **the root of the illness lies in the Lungs** [病本於肺].
○The newly corrected version states: According to the *Jia-Yi Jing* [《甲乙经》]:
**Urine color changes** [溺色变], **pain in the shoulders, back, arms, and supraclavicular region** [肩背臂燸及缺盆中痛], **abdominal distension and bloating with wheezing and coughing** [腹胀满膨膨而喘咳]—these are **Lung diseases** [为肺病].
**Coughing with blood and fever** [轨钮]—these are **Large Intestine diseases** [为大肠病].
Indeed, in the years when **Shào-Yīn controls Heaven** [少阴司天], **Fire overcomes Metal** [火克金], so the diseases are as described.
Furthermore, **Wang’s annotation** [王注] states that **illnesses converge on the right side** [民病集於右], **as the Small Intestine communicates with the Heart** [以小肠通心故].
According to the *Jia-Yi Jing* [《甲乙经》], the **Large Intestine wraps around the spine** [大肠附脊左环], **and the ileum encircles the spine on the right** [回肠附脊右环].
This contradicts the previous statement, so **perhaps it is due to Fire overwhelming Metal, causing Large Intestine disease** [得非火盛克金，而大肠病欤].
If the **Chǐ-Zé pulse** [尺泽] **fails**, **death is inevitable** [死不治].
The **Chǐ-Zé pulse** [尺泽] is located on the **inner side of the elbow** [肘内康大文中], where the artery responds to pressure by hand—this is the **Lung’s *qi*** [肺之气].
When **Fire consumes Metal** [火烁於金], **it receives Heaven’s mandate** [承天之命], **and Metal’s *qi* is internally exhausted** [金气内绝], so **the hexagram is perilous and lost** [故爻危亡].
If the **Chǐ-Zé pulse does not reach** [尺泽不至], **the Lung’s *qi* has already failed** [肺气已绝].
The **Nourishing and Defensive *qi*** [荣卫之气] **lacks a guiding principle** [宣行无主], **and true *qi* is internally depleted** [真气内竭].
Thus, **how can life be sustained?** [生之何有哉].

When the **Tài-Yīn** [太阴] **controls Heaven** [司天], **excessive Dampness** [湿淫] **prevails** [所胜], then **prolonged darkness spreads** [沉阴且布], **rainfall disrupts growth** [雨变], **and there are withered crops** [枯槁] **along with abscesses and localized swelling** [驸肿], **bone pain and *Yīn* paralysis** [骨痛阴痹].
**Yīn paralysis** [阴痹] refers to **areas that cannot be pressed** [按之不得].
The people suffer from **pain in the waist, back, head, and neck** [腰脊头项痛], **occasional dizziness** [时眩], **difficult defecation** [大便难], **unable to disperse *Yīn* *qi*** [阴气不甩], **anorexia despite hunger** [饥不欲食], **coughing up blood** [咳唾则有血], **and a heart that feels suspended** [心如悬].
The root of the illness lies in the **Kidneys** [肾].
This refers to the years **Yǐ-Chǒu** [乙丑], **Dīng-Chǒu** [丁丑], **Jǐ-Chǒu** [己丑], **Xīn-Chǒu** [辛丑], **Guǐ-Chǒu** [癸丑], **Yǐ-Wèi** [乙未], **Dīng-Wèi** [丁未], **Jǐ-Wèi** [己未], **Xīn-Wèi** [辛未], and **Guǐ-Wèi** [癸未].
**Prolonged** [沉] refers to **long-standing** [久].
When **Kidney *qi* is afflicted by pathogens** [肾气受邪], **water lacks the ability to moisten** [水无能润], **and the lower burner becomes parched** [下焦桔涸], hence **difficult defecation** [故大便难].
○The newly corrected version states: According to the *Jia-Yi Jing* [《甲乙经》]:
**Anorexia despite hunger** [饥不用食], **coughing up blood** [咳唾则有血], **and a heart that feels suspended, resembling hunger** [心悬如饥状]—these are **Kidney diseases** [为肾病].
Furthermore, **when pathogens are in the Kidneys** [邪在肾], **there is bone pain and *Yīn* paralysis** [则骨痛阴痹], **where *Yīn* paralysis refers to areas that cannot be pressed** [阴痹者，按之而不得], **abdominal distension and waist pain** [腹胀腰痛], **difficult defecation** [大便难], **stiffness and pain in the shoulders, back, neck, and supraclavicular region** [肩背颈项强痛], **and occasional dizziness** [时眩].
Indeed, in the years when **Tài-Yīn controls Heaven** [太阴司天], **Earth overcomes Water** [土克水], so the diseases are as described.
If the **Tài-Xī pulse** [太溪] **fails**, **death is inevitable** [死不治].
The **Tài-Xī pulse** [太溪] is located on the **inner ankle, behind the heel bone** [足内踝后跟骨上], where the artery responds to pressure by hand—this is the **Kidney’s *qi*** [肾之气].
When **Earth pathogens overcome Water** [土邪胜水], **Kidney *qi* is internally exhausted** [而肾气内绝], **pathogens are severe while righteousness is faint** [邪甚正微], so **no remedy can be applied** [故方无所用矣].

When the **Shào-Yáng** [少阳] **controls Heaven** [司天], **excessive Fire** [火淫] **prevails** [所胜], then **warm *qi* flows freely** [温气流行], **and Metal’s governance is disrupted** [金政不平].
The people suffer from **headaches** [头痛], **fever with chills and malaria** [一发热恶寒而疟], **heat rising to the skin** [热上皮肤哺], **color changes to yellow or red** [色变黄赤], **progression to water-related symptoms** [传而为水], **fullness in the body, face, elbows, and abdomen with upward pressure on breath** [身面肘鸟腹满仰息], **diarrhea with bloody and white mucus** [泄往赤白], **ulcers and abscesses** [疮疡], **coughing up blood** [咳唾血], **and heart distress** [烦心].
In severe cases, **chest heat** [胸中热] **and vomiting** [甚则欤趣]—the root of the illness lies in the **Lungs** [肺].
This refers to the years **Jiā-Yín** [甲寅], **Bǐng-Yín** [丙寅], **Wù-Yín** [戊寅], **Jué-Yín** [决寅], **Rén-Yín** [壬寅], **Jiā-Shēn** [甲申], **Bǐng-Shēn** [丙申], **Wù-Shēn** [戊申], **Gēng-Shēn** [庚申], and **Rén-Shēn** [壬申].

When **Fire** [火] comes to dominate, the **Lung-qi** [金气] is afflicted by **evil** [邪], hence it is said that the **Lung’s regulatory power is disrupted** [金政不平].

Fire blazes above, and the **Lungs** [金肺] suffer from **evil**, causing **internal heat** [客热内翻] to arise, while **Water** [水] cannot provide relief, thus giving rise to all manner of **illnesses** [诸病]. To subdue this **Fire** [制火之客] is the only remedy.

○Newly corrected text states: According to *The Jia-Yi Classic* [按《甲乙经》], when **evil** [邪] is in the **Lungs** [肺], then **skin pain** [皮肤痛] and **alternating chills and fever** [发寒热] occur. Indeed, in the **Lesser Yang** [少阳] years when **Fire** [火] overcomes **Metal** [金], the illness manifests thus.

When the **Celestial Reservoir** [天府] is severed, the **patient dies without remedy** [死不治]. The **Celestial Reservoir** [天府] is located on the **inner side of the upper elbow** [肘复内侧上], three *cun* below the armpit, where the pulse responds to pressure—this is the **Lung’s qi** [肺之气]. When **Fire** [火] is excessive and the **Metal pulse** [金脉] is severed, death ensues.

In **Greater Yang** [阳明] years when **Dryness** [燥] is excessive, **Wood** [木] flourishes late, and **grasses grow late** [草乃晚生], while **tendons and bones internally transform** [筋骨内变]. The people suffer from **left flank pain** [左肚胁痛], **internal cold** [寒清於中], **malaria** [感而疟], **severe shivering** [大冻革候], **coughing** [咳], **abdominal rumbling** [腹中呜], **urinary urgency or incontinence** [注泄], **fright-induced tremors** [惊搪], a condition called **"Wood’s Retarded Growth"** [名木敛生], where **roots wither below** [莞於下] and **leaves scorch above** [草焦上首].

There is **sudden heart-flank pain** [心胁暴痛], making it impossible to turn or lie on one’s side; the **face becomes parched and dusty** [隘乾面尘], the **waist aches** [腰痛], men develop **epilepsy or hernia** [癫疝], women experience **lower abdominal pain** [少腹痛], the **eyes become dim** [目昧], **ulcers form on the temples** [毗疡], **prolonged sores cause paralysis** [疮座瘫], and **parasitic worms appear** [垫虫来见]—the root of the illness lies in the **Liver** [肝].

This refers to the years **Yǐ-Mǎo** [乙卯], **Dīng-Mǎo** [丁卯], **Jǐ-Mǎo** [己卯], **Xīn-Mǎo** [辛卯], **Guǐ-Mǎo** [癸卯], **Yǐ-Yǒu** [乙酉], **Dīng-Yǒu** [丁酉], **Jǐ-Yǒu** [己酉], **Xīn-Yǒu** [辛酉], and **Guǐ-Yǒu** [癸酉].
**Metal** [金] prevails, hence **grasses and trees grow late** [草木晚生荣]. In the human body, this causes **internal tendons and bones to stiffen and fail to function** [筋骨内应而不用].

The **qi of Great Cold** [大冻之气], shifting and altering in its season [变易时侯], then **causes chill and clearness in the human body** [人寒清发於中]. When **internalized**, the **Liver** [肝] is affected by this **cold qi** [寒气], resulting in **intermittent fevers** [疢疟].

The **Large Intestine** [大肠] resides on the right, and **Lung qi** [肺气] communicates with it. Now, when **Lung qi** [肺气] **overacts internally** [内淫], the **Liver**, being on the left, thus **manifests as piercing pain in the left hypochondrium** [左朕胁痛如刺割].

In such years, the people **suffer from spontaneous urination or diarrhea** [自注泄], yet they **do not experience overactive or defeated disorders** [无淫胜之疾].

**Great Cold** [大冻] is the **second stage of Cold** [次寒]. When **Great Cold** [大冻] is **extreme**, **Yang qi** [阳气] does not flow, hence **trees and plants wither and grow late** [木容收敛，草荣悉晚]. As **vital energy** [生气] has already ascended, **Yang** [阳] fails to spread and command, thus **congested vital energy accumulates below** [闭积生气而蓄於下]. In its **human correspondence**, this **settles as painful qi in the lower abdomen** [少腹之内，痛气居之].

Diseases erupt in **mid-summer** [仲夏], while **ulcerative and carbuncle disorders** [疮疡之疾] persist until **autumn** [秋中]. **Convulsive breath** [疮痉之息] arises from the **upper body** [生於上], while **paralytic and swollen breath** [瘫肿之息] originates from the **lower body** [生於下]. Though **ulcers appear red** [疮色虽赤], their **core remains white** [中心正白], a **natural trait of vital energies** [物气之常].

○ **Newly corrected and verified** [新校正云] states:
According to the *Jiǎ-Yǐ Jīng* [《甲乙经》], **waist pain prevents bending or bowing** [腰痛不可以俯仰], **men develop epilepsy or hernia** [丈夫症疝], and **women suffer lower abdominal swelling** [妇人少腹肿]. In severe cases, **the face becomes parched and dusty** [甚则隘乾面尘], marking **Liver illness** [为肝病].
Again, **chest fullness and spontaneous diarrhea** [胸满洞泄] are **Liver illness** [为肝病].
Again, **piercing chest pain** [心胁#10痛] **prevents turning or lying on one’s side** [不能反侧], **eye detachment and temple ulcers** [目脱毗疡#11], **swelling in the supraclavicular fossa** [缺盆中肿痛], **axillary swelling** [掖下肿], **sweating with cold shivers** [马刀挟撄#12汗出振寒], and **intermittent fevers** [疟] are **Gallbladder illness** [为胆病].

This is because **Yangming governs the sky** [阳明司天], and **Metal conquers Wood** [金克木], hence the diseases manifest thus. Again, according to the *Mài Jiě* [《脉解》], the **epilepsy and hernia** [所谓癫疝] and **lower abdominal swelling in women** [妇人少腹肿] attributed to **Juéyīn** [厥阴] are due to **Chén** [辰] (the year). In the **third month** (of the year), **Yin within Yang** [阳中之阴] prevails, and **evil resides in the center** [邪在中], hence **epilepsy, hernia, and lower abdominal swelling** [故日癫疝少腹肿]. (The character **座** [座] is pronounced *zuò*, as in "sister" and "harvest.")

The **Great Surge** [太冲] ceases, and death ensues without remedy.

The **Great Surge** is located two inches posterior to the joint of the big toe on the foot [太冲在足大指本节后二寸], where its pulse beats in response to touch—this is the **Liver’s *qi*** [肝之气也]. When **Metal invades to subdue Wood** [金来伐木], the Liver’s *qi* is internally exhausted, and **True *qi* cannot overcome evil** [真不胜邪], hence death is inevitable.

When **Tàiyáng governs the sky** [太阳司天], **excessive cold** [寒淫] prevails, and **cold *qi* reverses its course** [财寒气反至], causing **water to congeal like ice** [水且冰], and **blood to alter within the body** [血变於中]. This manifests as **paralytic ulcers** [发为瘫疡], with the people suffering from **sudden heart pain** [厥心痛], **hemoptysis and blood in stool** [呕血血泄], **sighing and weeping** [欤钮], **a tendency toward melancholy** [善悲], and **occasional dizziness or collapse** [时眩仆]. The **year’s *yún* of Fire** [运火] blazes fiercely, and **heavy rains bring hail** [雨暴乃雹].

**Chest and abdominal distension** [胸腹满], **palm heat and elbow stiffness** [手热肘孪], **axillary swelling** [掖肿], **a restless, surging heart** [心澹澹大动], **discomfort in the chest, flanks, stomach, and lower abdomen** [胸胁胃院不安], **flushed face and yellow eyes** [面赤目黄], **frequent sighing** [善噫], **dry throat** [啦乾], and in severe cases, **thirst with a desire to drink** [甚则色□#13渴而欲饮], all originate from **disease in the Heart** [病本於心].

This refers to the years **Jiāchén** [甲辰], **Bǐngchén** [丙辰], **Wùchén** [戊辰], **Gēngchén** [庚辰], **Rénchén** [壬辰], **Jiāxū** [甲戌], **Bǐngxū** [丙戌], **Wùxū** [戊戌], **Gēngxū** [庚戌], and **Rénxū** [壬戌].

When **Tàiyáng governs the sky** [太阳司天], **cold *qi* pervades and transforms** [寒气布化], thus **water congeals like ice** [故水且冰], and **blood clots between the skin and flesh** [而血凝皮肤之问], with **Defensive *qi* stagnating and gathering** [卫气结聚], hence the **paralysis** [故为瘫也]. If the **year’s *yún* of Fire** [乘火运] is intense and **fire’s heat blazes fiercely** [而火热#14炎烈], clashing with water, it results in **sudden downpour and hail shaped like half-pearls** [故暴雨半珠形雹也].

The **Heart’s *qi* causes sighing** [心气为噫], hence the frequent sighing [故善噫]. In these years, **diseases converge in the Heart and flanks** [病集於心胁之中], where **Yang *qi* is internally suppressed** [阳气内郁], and **Damp *qi* steams downward** [湿气下蒸]. Thus, **sudden heart pain and hemoptysis** [心厥痛而呕血], **blood in stool and sighing** [血泄轨钮], **flushed face and yellow eyes** [面赤目黄], **frequent sighing** [善噫], **palm heat and elbow stiffness** [手热肘挛], **axillary swelling** [掖肿], and **dry throat** [哑乾] occur. In severe cases, **cold *qi* overpowers Yang** [寒气胜阳], **water’s flow invades Fire** [水行凌火], and **fire’s *qi* is internally suppressed** [火气内郁], hence the **thirst with a desire to drink** [故渴而欲饮].

The disease **first arises in the Heart** [病始心生], due to **Yin’s invasion and aggression** [为阴凌犯], hence it is said that the disease originates from the Heart [故云病本於心].

**Newly corrected version** [○新校正云]:
According to the *Jiā-Yǐ Jīng* [《甲乙经》], **palm heat, elbow stiffness, and axillary swelling** [手热肘挛掖肿], and in severe cases, **chest and flank distension** [甚则胸胁支满], **a restless, surging heart** [心澹澹大动], and **flushed face and yellow eyes** [面赤目黄], are symptoms of **Heart Center illness** [为手心主病].

Again, when **evil resides in the Heart** [邪在心], the people suffer from **heart pain and melancholy** [病心痛善悲], as well as **occasional dizziness or collapse** [时眩仆].

This is because, in the **Tàiyáng governs-the-sky years** [太阳司天之岁], **Water subdues Fire** [水克火], hence the diseases manifest thus.

When the **Spirit Gate** [神门] is severed, death is incurable. The **Spirit Gate** lies at the back of the palm, at the tip of the sharp bone, where the pulse responds to touch—this is the true **Heart qi** [真心气]. When **Water overpowers Fire** [水行胜火], the **Heart qi** is internally severed [心气内绝], and the **Spirit-qi** [神气] has already perished—what need is there to await death? Those skilled in diagnosis thus deem it incurable.

What is meant by **"moving qi"** [动气]? It refers to knowing the **viscera** [藏]. How does one diagnose death through examination? Because all these are the **pulses and moving qi** of the **visceral channels**—thus one discerns the **survival or extinction of the Spirit-organs** [神藏之存亡].

The Emperor said: *"Excellent."*

How then should one treat it? [i.e., *What remedies may be applied?*]

**Gǐ Bó** replied: When the **celestial governing qi** [司天之气] is **overborne by Wind** [风淫所胜], one **balances it with pungent and cold** [平以辛冻], **assists with bitter and sweet** [佐以苦甘], **moderates with sweetness** [以甘缓之], and **relaxes with sourness** [以酸写之].

When the **Juéyīn qi** [厥阴之气] has not yet reached extreme heat, one **calms it with cool medicines** [故以凉药平之].

Now, the **application of qi** [气之用也]—when **cold accumulates, it becomes chill**; when **warmth accumulates, it becomes heat**. To **reduce heat**, one employs **warmth**; to **reduce chill**, one employs **cold**. To **increase warmth**, one employs **heat**; to **increase cold**, one employs **chill**. If each follows its proper measure, then **chill is chill**, **warmth is warmth**, **heat is heat**, and **coolness is coolness**. The principles of **formularies** [方书] must not be neglected!

Thus, **cold, heat, warmth, and chill**—their **transformation, decline, and dosage**—must be mastered by those skilled in prescriptions. The **residual qi** [余气] follows these same principles.

---
**Newly corrected version** [○新校正云]:
As the text above states: *"When excess is directed downward, balance it with its conqueror. When excess is directed inward, treat it with its conqueror."* Thus, on **Spring-and-Autumn days** [在泉日], one **treats**; on **Celestial Governing days** [司天日], one **balances**.

When **heat overpowers** [热淫所胜], one **balances with salty and cold** [平以咸寒], **assists with bitter and sweet** [佐以苦甘], and **contracts with sourness** [以酸收之]. When **heat has retreated but intermittently flares**, this is **Heart vacuity** [心虚], with **scattered qi failing to consolidate**—thus one **contracts with sourness**. Though one contracts with sourness, it must also be **augmented with cold** to **root out its source**.

When **heat is excessively severe**, one **disperses it with bitter**. If **shivering follows sweating**, the **evil qi has exhausted**—do not **chill with ice**. If **heat persists after sweating**, the **evil qi remains**—thus one **contracts with sourness**. If **heat recurs**, one **sweats again**. If **heat returns after sweating**, this is **visceral vacuity**—then one may **tonify the Heart**.

The method is thus unified: **All treatments for heat** must not **repeatedly disperse and repeatedly treat**—how much less should one **cycle through four transformations** and reverse them?

When **dampness overpowers** [湿淫所胜], one **balances with bitter and hot** [平以苦热], **assists with sour and pungent** [佐以酸辛], **dries with bitter** [以苦燥之], and **drains with bland** [以淡泄之]. Wherever **dampness lingers**, it manifests as **swelling and fullness**—but if one **eliminates dampness**, the **swelling and fullness will naturally subside**.

For diseases arising from dampness that **do not present swelling or fullness**, the same treatment applies. When **dampness is above**, one **vomits it with bitter**; when **dampness is below**, one **drains it with bitter** and **leaches it with bland**—thus it is **dried**. *"Draining"* refers to **promoting urination** to **facilitate small voiding** as the method.

Though **sourness is hot**, it is used to **promote urination** and **remove latent water**. In treating **dampness diseases**, failure to **induce urination** is **not the correct approach**.

---
**Newly corrected version** [○新校正云]:
As the text states: *"When dampness invades internally, assist with sour and bland."* Here, **"sour and pungent"** [酸辛]—**"pungent"** likely should be **"bland"** [淡]. When **dampness above is severe and hot**, one treats with **bitter and warm**, assists with **sweet and pungent**, and **stops with sweating** as the principle. If **warmth remains above the waist**, while **fire-qi is suppressed below**, with **dampness and suppression intermingling**, one uses **bitter, warm, sweet, and pungent medicines** to **release the exterior and induce sweating**, thus **relaxing** it. Hence it is said: *"Sweating is the method to eliminate the disease."*

When **fire overpowers** [火淫所胜], one **balances with salty and clear** [平以咸玲], **assists with sweet and bitter** [佐以甘苦], **contracts with sourness** [以酸收之], **disperses with bitter** [以苦发之], and **restores with sourness** [以酸复之]. The same applies to **heat excess** [热淫同]; **heat excess** follows this same principle, **restoring the original qi with sourness**. If one does not **restore the qi**, the **excess qi will leave a void**, **inviting the original disease** [招其本].

When **dryness overpowers** [燥淫所胜], one **balances with bitter and moist** [平以苦湿], **assists with sour and pungent** [佐以酸辛], and **drains with bitter** [以苦下之]. To **subdue dryness’ excess**, one again uses **bitter and moist**—this is the **flavor-nature of Fire**. What requires **draining** should be treated with **bitter**; what requires **tonification** should be treated with **sour**; what requires **relaxation** should be treated with **pungent**. When **clearing is excessive and produces cold**, which **lingers and does not disperse**, one **drains with bitter and moist**. If **qi is in excess**, one **relaxes it with pungent**. All **qi** follows this principle.

---
**Newly corrected version** [○新校正云]:
As the text above states: *"When dryness invades internally, treat with bitter and warm."* Here, **"bitter and moist"** [苦湿]—**"moist"** should be **"warm"** [温]. The **three instances of "moist"** in the text and annotations should all be **"warm."** Moreover, as the *Lùyùan Zhèngjì Dàlùn* [《六元正纪大论》] states: *"The governance of Tàiyáng, the year requires bitter to dry it."*

When **cold overpowers** [寒淫所胜], one **balances with pungent and hot** [平以辛热], **assists with bitter and sweet** [佐以苦甘], and **relaxes with salty** [以咸写之]. **Dispersing excess** must be **moderate**—do not overdo it.

---
**Newly corrected version** [○新校正云]:
As the text above states: *"When cold invades internally, treat with sweet and hot, assist with bitter and pungent."* Here, **"balance with pungent and hot, assist with sweet and bitter"**—this text is erroneous. Moreover, as the *Lùyùan Zhèngjì Dàlùn* states: *"The governance of Tàiyáng, the year requires bitter to dry it."*

The Emperor said: *"Excellent."*

If **evil qi reverses and overpowers**, how should one treat it? [*i.e.,* When **a non-conquering qi reverses to become the conquering evil**]

**Gǐ Bó** replied: When **Wind governs the earth** [风司於地], and **clearness reverses to overpower it**, one treats with **sour and warm** [治以酸温], **assists with bitter and sweet** [佐以苦甘], and **balances with pungent** [以辛平之]. When **Juéyīn is at the Spring-and-Autumn position** [厥阴在泉], then **Wind governs the earth**—referring to **Five Tiger years** [五寅岁] and **Five Monkey years** [五申岁].

When **evil qi is excessively strong**, one **first relaxes with sourness** and **assists with bitter and sweet**. When **evil qi retreats**, the **rightful qi is vacuous**, so one **tonifies and balances with pungent**.

When **heat governs the earth** [热司於地], and **cold reverses to overpower it**, one treats with **sweet and hot** [治以甘热], **assists with bitter and pungent** [佐以苦辛], and **balances with salty** [以咸平之]. When **Shàoyīn is at the Spring-and-Autumn position** [少阴在泉], then **heat governs the earth**—referring to **Five Rabbit years** [五卯] and **Five Rooster years** [五酉].

「One first **relaxes the evil qi**, and then **balances the rightful qi**.

When **Dampness governs the earth** [湿司於地], **Heat counteracts and overpowers it**, one treats with **bitter and cool** [治以苦玲], **assists with salty and sweet** [佐以咸甘], and **balances with bitter** [以苦平之]. When **Tàiyīn is at the Spring-and-Autumn position** [太阴在泉], then **Dampness governs the earth**—referring to **Five Snake years** [五辰岁] and **Five Dog years** [五戌岁] also.

The principle of **tonifying and relaxing** applies similarly to all remaining cases.

When **Fire governs the earth** [火司於地], **Cold counteracts and overpowers it**, one treats with **sweet and hot** [治以甘热], **assists with bitter and pungent** [佐以苦辛], and **balances with salty** [以咸平之]. When **Shàoyáng is at the Spring-and-Autumn position** [少阳在泉], then **Fire governs the earth**—referring to **Five Horse years** [五巳岁] and **Five Pig years** [五亥岁] also.

When **Dryness governs the earth** [燥司於地], **Heat counteracts and overpowers it**, one treats with **mild cold** [治以平寒], **assists with bitter and sweet** [佐以苦甘], and **balances with sour** [以酸平之], **harmonizing being most beneficial**. When **Yángmíng is at the Spring-and-Autumn position** [阳明在泉], then **Dryness governs the earth**—referring to **Five Rat years** [五子岁] and **Five Horse years** [五午岁] also. The nature of **Dryness**, while it **abhors Heat**, also **fears Cold**; thus, **cooling and warming in balance** is the most advantageous approach. #19

When **Cold governs the earth** [寒司於地], **Heat counteracts and overpowers it**, one treats with **salty and cool** [治以咸玲], **assists with sweet and pungent** [佐以甘辛], and **balances with bitter** [以苦平之]. When **Tàiyáng is at the Spring-and-Autumn position** [太阳在泉], then **Cold governs the earth**—referring to **Five Ox years** [五丑岁] and **Five Sheep years** [五未岁] also.

These six methods of **Daoist/Wayist qi** treatment differ from the previous **excessive counteracting** principles. #20
The term **"treat"** [治] refers to **relaxing the counteracting evil qi**.
The term **"assist"** [佐] refers to **what is beneficial and suitable**.
The term **"balance"** [平] refers to **tonifying the already weakened rightful qi**.

The Emperor asked: **"How does one treat when the evil qi governs the Heaven?"**
Qībó replied:
When **Wind transforms in Heaven** [风化於天], **Cold counteracts and overpowers it**, one treats with **sour and warm** [治以酸温], **assists with sweet and bitter** [佐以甘苦].
This occurs in **Five Horse years** [巳亥岁] and **Five Pig years** [亥].

When **Heat transforms in Heaven** [热化於天], **Cold counteracts and overpowers it**, one treats with **sweet and warm** [治以甘温], **assists with bitter, sour, and pungent** [佐以苦酸辛].
This occurs in **Five Rat years** [子午岁] and **Five Horse years** [午].

When **Dampness transforms in Heaven** [湿化於天], **Heat counteracts and overpowers it**, one treats with **bitter and cold** [治以苦寒], **assists with bitter and sour** [佐以苦酸].
This occurs in **Five Ox years** [丑未岁] and **Five Sheep years** [未].

When **Fire transforms in Heaven** [火化於天], **Cold counteracts and overpowers it**, one treats with **sweet and hot** [治以甘热], **assists with bitter and pungent** [佐以苦辛].
This occurs in **Five Tiger years** [寅申岁] and **Five Monkey years** [申].

When **Dryness transforms in Heaven** [燥化於天], **Heat counteracts and overpowers it**, one treats with **pungent and cold** [治以辛寒], **assists with sweet and bitter** [佐以甘苦].
This occurs in **Five Rabbit years** [卯酉岁] and **Five Rooster years** [酉].

When **Cold transforms in Heaven** [寒化於天], **Heat counteracts and overpowers it**, one treats with **salty and cool** [治以咸玲], **assists with bitter and pungent** [佐以苦辛].
This occurs in **Five Dragon years** [辰戌岁] and **Five Dog years** [戌].

The Emperor asked: **"How does the counteracting of the Six Qi manifest?"**
Qībó replied: **"First, I shall describe their effects when they are counteracting."**

When **Juéyīn’s counteracting** is excessive,
there is **tinnitus and dizziness** [耳呜头眩], **a desire to vomit with sourness and resentment** [债愤欲吐], **stomach discomfort as if cold** [胃隔如寒], **frequent gusts of wind** [大风数举], **insects fail to thrive** [保虫不滋], **abdominal and flank distension** [肚胁气并], **transformation into Heat** [化而为热], **yellowish-red urine** [小便黄赤], **pain in the stomach region near the heart** [胃院当心而痛], **upper flank discomfort** [上支两胁], **intestinal rumbling and diarrhea** [肠呜飧泄], **lower abdominal pain** [少腹痛], **discharge of red and white** [注下赤白], and in severe cases, **vomiting** [呕吐] and **obstruction of the gullet and throat** [鬲咽不通].
This occurs in **Five Horse years** [五巳岁] and **Five Pig years** [五亥岁].
The area below the heart and above the navel is the **stomach’s domain**.
The **"stomach gullet"** [胃鬲] refers to the upper portion of the stomach region and the lower part of the great gullet, where **Wind-Cold qi** manifests.
**"Qi distension"** [气并] means **one-sided accumulation**.
**"Gullet and throat obstruction"** [鬲咽] means **food and drink enter but are immediately expelled**.
○Newly corrected text states: According to the *Jiāyǐ Jīng* [《甲乙经》], when the **stomach is diseased**, there is **pain in the stomach region near the heart**, **upper flank discomfort**, and **obstruction of the gullet and throat**.

When **Shàoyīn’s counteracting** is excessive,
there is **heat below the heart** [心下热], **bitter hunger** [苦饥], **pain below the navel** [脐下反痛], **qi wandering through the Three Burners** [气游三焦], **scorching heat reaching the woods, causing them to wither** [炎暑至，木乃津]， **and grasses to wilt** [草乃萎], **vomiting and irritability** [呕逆躁烦], **abdominal fullness and diarrhea** [腹满痛搪泄], and **transmission as red dysentery** [传为赤沃].
This occurs in **Five Rat years** [五子岁] and **Five Horse years** [五午岁].
**"Wò"** [沃] is **"mò"** [沐], meaning **soaked or drenched**.

When **Tàiyīn’s counteracting** is excessive,
**Fire-qi stagnates internally**, causing **ulcers and sores within** [疮疡於中], **spreading outward** [流散於外], and **diseases in the arms and flanks** [病在肱胁]. In severe cases, there is **heart pain with heat suppression** [心痛热格], **headache** [头痛], **throat obstruction** [喉痹], and **stiff neck** [项强].
If **Dampness counteracts alone**, it **stagnates internally**, **Cold presses the lower Burner** [寒迫下焦], causing **pain lingering at the crown** [痛留顶], **drawing the eyebrows inward** [互引眉问], and **stomach fullness** [胃满].
When **frequent rains arrive** [雨数至], **Dryness transformation appears**, leading to **lower abdominal fullness** [少腹满], **heaviness and stiffness in the waist** [腰雅重强], **internal discomfort** [内不便], **prone to diarrhea** [善注泄], **warmth in the feet** [足下温], **head heaviness** [头重], **swelling from the feet to the elbows** [足经肘肿], and **fluid retention in the chest, manifesting as facial swelling** [饮发於中驸肿於上].
This occurs in **Five Ox years** [五丑岁] and **Five Sheep years** [五未岁].
When **Dampness counteracts above**, **Fire-qi stagnates internally**.
When **Dampness counteracts in the middle**, **Cold presses the lower Burner**.
**"Water overflowing the rivers and canals"** [水溢河渠] means **scaled insects leave the water**.
**"Yá"** [雅] refers to **the buttocks**.
**"Internal discomfort"** [内不便] means **waist heaviness, internal rigidity, and difficulty in bending and stretching**.
**"Counteracting alone"** [独胜] means **without concurrent Fire stagnation**.
**"Facial swelling"** [驸肿於上] refers to **swelling in the head and face**.
**"Swelling from the feet to the elbows"** [足经肿] is caused by **Fire stagnation**.
○Newly corrected text states: The detailed annotation notes: **"Water overflowing the rivers and canals"** [水溢河渠] means **scaled insects leave the water**. King’s annotation here lacks textual basis. Again, according to the *Tàiyīn’s reversal* [太阴之复], it states: **"Heavy rains fall in due course, and scaled creatures appear on land"** [大雨时行，鳞见於陆]. Thus, the text here omits **"scaled creatures appear on land"** [少鳞见於陆] after **"frequent rains arrive"** [雨数至]. Otherwise, King’s annotation would have no grounding in the text.

When **Shàoyáng’s counteracting** is excessive,
**Heat invades the stomach**, causing **irritability and heart pain** [烦心心痛], **red eyes** [目赤], **desire to vomit** [欲呕], **vomiting sour and bitter with hunger** [呕酸苦饥], **earache** [耳痛], **red urine** [溺赤], **proneness to sudden fright and delirium** [善惊谵妄], **violent heat consuming and drying** [暴热消烁], **grasses withering and waters vanishing** [草萎水涸], **shellfish bending inward** [介虫乃屈], **lower abdominal pain** [少腹痛], and **discharge of red and white** [下沃赤白].
This occurs in **Five Tiger years** [五寅岁] and **Five Monkey years** [五申岁].
The **violent Heat** causes **grasses to wither and waters to dry**; **Yin-qi is consumed and withered**.
**"Shellfish"** [介虫] refers to **metallic transformation**.
When **Fire-qi is overwhelmingly excessive**, **shellfish bend and submit**.
**"Sour"** [酸] means **vinegar-like fluid**.

When **Yángmíng’s counteracting** is excessive,
**Cold arises within**, causing **left flank pain** [左肚胁痛], **diarrhea** [搪泄], **internal hoarseness and obstruction** [内为哑塞], **external manifestation of epilepsy and hernia** [外发癫疝], **severe cold and killing frost** [大冻肃杀], **floral changes in plants** [华英改容], **hairy insects perish** [毛虫乃殃], **chest discomfort** [胸中不便], **constriction and coughing** [隘塞而咳].
This occurs in **Five Rabbit years** [五卯岁] and **Five Rooster years** [五酉岁].
**"Severe cold and killing frost"** [大冻肃杀] means **Metal-qi overpowers Wood-qi**, causing **plants to lose their flowers and vitality**, **their forms altered and their tops scorched**.

**Hairy insects** [毛虫] **transform into Wood-qi**, for their essence is unsuited to Metal-qi’s governance—thus, **Metal’s strict dominion prevails**, and **hairy insects perish and waste away**.

**Liver-Wood’s qi** descends to govern the **Yin regions**, so when **severe cold descends**, **epilepsy and hernia** [癫疝] erupt.

**"Chest discomfort"** [胸#27中不便] refers to **breathing’s reversal**, where **pain or tension**—**urgent or relaxed**—**obstructs ease**.

When **qi is overwhelmingly strong**, **hoarseness and obstruction** [哑塞] arise, and **coughing ensues**.
**"Hoarseness"** [哑] denotes the **throat’s lower passage**, where it **connects to the chest**, between the **two lobes of the lungs**.

When **Taiyang’s dominance** prevails, **congealing frost descends**—**untimely waters freeze**, and **feathers melt only later**.

**Hemorrhoids and malaria** [痔疟] flare; **cold seizes the stomach**, generating **internal heart pain**, while **the Yin regions fester**, **hidden curves obstruct**, and **pain radiates to the groin and thighs**.
**Tendons and muscles contract**, **blood vessels congeal and weep**, **veins distend and alter hue**—sometimes **blood leaks**, **skin darkens and swells**, **the abdomen distends with undigested food**.
**Heat reverses upward**, causing **pain from the crown to the nape**, **eyes to feel as if they will detach**.
When **cold invades the lower burner**, it **transmutes into dampness and stagnation**.

This occurs in **Five Tiger years** [五辰] and **Five Dog years** [五戌].
**"Chilling qi presses violently**—**Yáng cannot withstand it**—thus **waters freeze prematurely**, beyond the usual cold season.

When the **water-qi** [水气] prevails overwhelmingly, **Yáng-fire** [阳火] cannot circulate, so all **feathered insects** [羽虫] generate and transform sluggishly.

**Scholarly annotations:**
- *拘* (jū) – **constrain/bind**
- *急* (jí) – **urgent/violent**
- *苛* (kē) – **harsh/oppressive**
- *络* (luò) – **network vessels** [脉络]

In the case of **Tàiyáng** [太阳] **prevailing**, its **qi** is rooted at the crown [巅], so **heat reverses upward** [热反上行], manifesting as **pain from the crown to the nape** [头项自顶脑户中痛], and the **eyes feel as if they will detach** [目如欲脱].
**Network vessels** [络] of the brain [脑] originate from the inner canthi [目内毗], ascend to the forehead [上额], converge at the crown [交巅上], then descend through the nape [别下项], hence the **pain from the crown to the nape** [自顶及脑户中痛] and the **eyes feeling as if they will detach** [目如欲脱].

**Scholarly annotations:**
- *濡* (rú) – **dampness/fluidity** [水利]

**Newly annotated text states:** According to the *Jiāyǐ Jīng* [《甲乙经》], **痔疟** [flare; cold seizes the stomach]—**pain from the crown to the nape** [头项自顶脑户中痛], **eyes feeling as if they will detach** [目如脱]—is a **Tàiyáng** [太阳] **channel** [经] **disease** [病].

**The Sovereign** [帝] asked: *"How should it be treated?"*

**Gēibó** [岐伯] replied:
When **Guìyīn** [厥阴] prevails, treat with **sweet and pure** [甘清], assist with **bitter and pungent** [苦辛], and **drain with sour** [以酸写之].
When **Shàoyīn** [少阴] prevails, treat with **pungent and cold** [辛寒], assist with **bitter and salty** [苦咸], and **drain with sweet** [以甘写之].
When **Tàiyīn** [太阴] prevails, treat with **salty and warm** [咸热], assist with **pungent and sweet** [辛甘], and **drain with bitter** [以苦泄之].
When **Shàoyáng** [少阳] prevails, treat with **pungent and cold** [辛寒], assist with **sweet and salty** [甘咸], and **drain with sweet** [以甘写之].
When **Yángmíng** [阳明] prevails, treat with **sour and warm** [酸温], assist with **pungent and sweet** [辛甘], and **drain with bitter** [以苦泄之].
When **Tàiyáng** [太阳] prevails, treat with **sweet and warm** [甘热], assist with **pungent and sour** [辛酸], and **drain with salty** [以咸写之].

When the **Six Prevailings** [六胜] manifest, they all **first return to the channel that cannot withstand them** [先归其不胜己者之故]. The **unable-to-withstand** [不胜] channel must be **drained first** [先写之], to **unblock its Dao/Way** [通其道], then **drain the prevailing qi** [次写所胜之气] to **make it retreat and disperse** [令其退释].
If one treats the **Six Prevailings** [胜] without **draining and dispersing** [写遣], then the **prevailing qi will seep inward**, generating **various diseases** [内生诸病].

**Newly annotated text states:** Examining this treatment method, it **first drains the unable-to-withstand** [先写其不胜], then **drains the prevailing qi** [后写其来胜]. Only the **Tàiyáng** [太阳] **prevailing** [胜] is treated with **sweet and warm** [甘热], differing from the rest. Perhaps **sweet** [甘] is a misprint for **bitter** [苦], making it **bitter and warm** [苦热]. Then the treatment for the **Six Prevailings** [六胜] would be consistent.

**The Sovereign** [帝] asked: *"How does the **reversal of the Six Qi** [六气之复] occur?"*
**Reversal** [复] refers to **retaliation/repayment** [报复], repaying the **prevailing** [胜].

**First**, there is the **prevailing** [胜]—
**Newly annotated text states:** According to the *Xuánzhū* [《玄珠》], the **Six Qi** [六气] are divided into **primary transformations** [正化] and **secondary transformations** [对化]:
**Guìyīn** [厥阴] **primarily governs** [正司] **at 亥** [hài], its **secondary transformation** [对化] **at 巳** [sì].
**Shàoyīn** [少阴] **primarily governs** [正司] **at 午** [wǔ], its **secondary transformation** [对化] **at 子** [zǐ].
**Tàiyīn** [太阴] **primarily governs** [正司] **at 未** [wèi], its **secondary transformation** [对化] **at 丑** [chǒu].
**Shàoyáng** [少阳] **primarily governs** [正司] **at 寅** [yín], its **secondary transformation** [对化] **at 申** [shēn].
**Yángmíng** [阳明] **primarily governs** [正司] **at 酉** [yǒu], its **secondary transformation** [对化] **at 卯** [mǎo].
**Tàiyáng** [太阳] **primarily governs** [正司] **at 戌** [xū], its **secondary transformation** [对化] **at 辰** [chén].

The **primary governing and transformation** [正司化令] is **real** [实], while the **secondary governing and transformation** [对司化令] is **void** [虚].
When the **secondary transformation** [对化] prevails and **reversal** [复] occurs, the **primary transformation** [正化] does not retaliate. This note suggests that **reversal** [复] occurs **after** the **prevailing** [胜], but it seems unclear.

**Gēibó** [岐伯] replied: *"Your question is thorough indeed!*

When **Guìyīn** [厥阴] **reverses** [复], the **lower abdomen becomes rigid and distended** [少腹坚满], **wrapped in violent pain** [裹急暴痛], with **upright trees and flying sands** [偃木飞沙]—**wind prevails** [风为木胜], so **earthly nourishment fails** [土不荣]. **Heart pain** [厥心痛] arises, with **sweating, vomiting, and inability to ingest** [汗发呕吐，饮食不入]. If food enters but is **regurgitated** [复出], the **tendons and bones feel light and dizzy** [筋骨掉眩], and **cold seizes** [清厥] occurs. In severe cases, it **invades the spleen** [入脾], causing **food stagnation and vomiting** [食痹而吐].
**Scholarly annotations:**
- *裹* (guǒ) – **encase/wrap** [腹胁之中]
- *偃木飞沙* (yǎn mù fēi shā) – **a violent wind** [风之大]
- *掉* (diào) – **feel light/float** [肉中动]
- *清厥* (qīng jué) – **cold extremities** [手足玲]
- *食痹* (shí bì) – **unbearable food stagnation** [食已心下痛，阴阴然不可名]

If **the Dao/Way of the stomach’s descending flow is obstructed** [胃气逆而不下流], food and drink **cannot enter** [食饮不入], or if they enter but **are expelled again** [入而复出], it is because **the liver overpowers the spleen and stomach** [肝乘脾胃]. If **the Suīng-Dao/Way of the stomach is severed** [冲阳绝], death is **untreatable** [死不治].
**Suīng-Dao/Way** [冲阳] refers to **the stomach’s channel and qi** [胃脉气].

When **Shàoyīn** [少阴] **reverses** [复], **internal heat and suffocation arise** [燠热内作], causing **restlessness, irritability, and sneezing** [烦躁欺嚏], with **lower abdominal twisting pain** [少腹绞痛].
**Fire** [火] **manifests as radiant brilliance** [墦炳], **constricting and drying** [隘燥], **distributing downward** [分注] at times. **Qi moves on the left** [气动於左], **ascends on the right** [上行於右], causing **coughing** [咳], **skin pain** [皮肤痛], **sudden sores and heart pain** [暴疮心痛], **obstructed consciousness** [郁冒不知人], and **sudden chills** [乃洒淅恶寒]. There is **shivering and delirium** [振栗谵妄], **chills followed by heat** [寒已而热], **thirst with desire to drink** [渴而欲饮], **shortness of breath and weakened bones** [少气骨萎], **obstructed intestines** [隔肠不便], **external floating edema** [外为浮肿], and **groaning** [喊噫].
**Dampness** [水] **transforms late** [后化], **flowing water does not freeze** [流水不冰], **heat-qi prevails** [热气大行], and **feathered insects perish** [介虫不福]. **Diseases manifest as food stagnation, sores, and festering** [病痹胎疮疡], **paralysis, gangrene, and hemorrhoids** [瘫疽座痔], and in severe cases, it **invades the lungs** [入肺], causing **coughing and nasal discharge** [咳而鼻渊].

The **fire-heat qi** [火热之气], entering from the **small intestine** [小肠] **at the left of the navel** [从脐下之左], **ascends to the left flank** [上行至左胁], and in severe cases, **ascends to the right** [甚则上行於右] and **invades the lungs** [入肺], hence **qi moves on the left while ascending on the right** [动於左，上行於右], causing **skin pain** [皮肤痛].
**分注** (fēn zhù) – **distributing downward** [大小俱下].
**骨萎** (gǔ wěi) – **weakened bones** [言骨弱无力].
**隔肠** (gé cháng) – **obstructed intestines** [肠如隔绝而不便写], especially when **chills and heat are severe** [寒热甚则然].

Since **Yángmíng** [阳明] **prevails first** [先胜], **dampness transforms late** [赤气后化], and **flowing water does not freeze** [流水不冰]. **Shàoyīn** [少阴] **primarily governs the earth** [本司於地], so in humans, **winter pulses do not congeal** [冬脉不凝].
If **high mountains and deep valleys** [高山穷谷] are **already at their peak** [至高之处], water **should freeze** [亦当冰], but if it **flows freely in the plains** [平下川流], it follows the **classical Dao/Way** [经].

**Fire-qi** [火气] **steams internally** [内蒸], while **metal-qi** [金气] **resists externally** [外拒]. **Internal Yáng-heat** [阳热内郁] **stagnates**, so **prickly heat and sores develop** [故为痱胜疮疡]. If the **prevailing** [胜] is severe, **sores** [疮] also appear.
When **heat is mild** [热少], **prickly heat and sores manifest externally** [外生痱胜]; when **heat is excessive** [热多], **internal paralysis and hemorrhoids form** [内结瘫座]. If **the small intestine has heat** [小肠有热], then **the anus** [户] **externally develops hemorrhoids** [外为痔]. These **reversals of heat** [热之变], all manifest as **diseases on the body’s posterior and lateral sides** [病於身后及外侧].

**Sores, festering, and prickly heat** [疮疡痱胜] **generate in the upper** [上], while **paralysis, gangrene, and hemorrhoids** [瘫疽痉痔] **generate in the lower** [下]. If they **manifest in reverse** [反其处], it is **inverted** [逆].
If **the Dao/Way of the lungs’ descending flow is severed** [天府绝], death is **untreatable** [死不治].
**天府** [Tiānfǔ] refers to **the lung’s channel and qi** [肺脉气].

**Newly annotated text states:** According to the **upper text** [上文], **Shàoyīn** [少阴] **governs the heavens** [司天], and if **heat rampantly prevails** [热淫所胜], **the Chi-Zé** [尺泽] ** Dao/Way is severed** [绝], death is **untreatable** [死不洽].

Shào-yáng [少阳] governs the heavens [司天], and when **fire rampantly prevails** [火淫所胜], **the Chi-Zé [尺泽] Dao/Way is severed** [绝], death is **untreatable** [死不治].

This passage describes **the Shàoyīn [少阴] reversal** [复], where **the lung’s channel and qi [天府, 肺脉气]** is severed [绝], rendering death **untreatable** [死不治]. The **lower text [下文]** speaks of **the Shào-yáng [少阳] reversal** [复], where **the Chi-Zé [尺泽, 肺脉气]** is severed [绝], death is **untreatable** [死不治]. When the text **contradicts in this manner** [相反], it is because **both Chi-Zé [尺泽] and Tiānfǔ [天府]** are **Dao/Way-points** [脉] of the **hand Tài-yīn [太阴]** channel, hence the **reciprocal phrasing** [互文].

In **the Tài-yīn [太阴] reversal** [复], **dampness** [湿] **manifesting as disease** [变] **prevails** [举], causing **the body to feel heavy and distended** [体重中满], **indigestion** [食饮不化], **rising of yīn-qi [阴气]** to the chest, **discomfort in the chest** [胸中不便], **water-related symptoms** [饮] **emerging in the midsection** [发於中], and **coughing with wheezing** [咳喘有声]. **Heavy rainfall occurs in due season** [大雨时行], and **scaly lesions appear on dry land** [鳞见於陆]. **The crown of the head aches severely** [头顶痛重], with **skin flaking and moles** [掉痣] **particularly pronounced** [尤甚], **nausea accompanied by silent retching** [呕而密默], **spitting clear fluids** [唾吐清液], and in severe cases, **penetrating the kidneys** [入肾], leading to **uncontrolled orifices** [窍写无度]. **Dampness reverses internally** [湿气内逆], while **cold qi fails to circulate** [寒气不行], and **Tài-yáng [太阳] qi ascends** [上流], thus generating these **symptoms** [病]. When **the crown of the head aches severely** [头顶痛重], it indicates **excessive flaking and moles on the brain** [脑中掉痣尤甚]. **Cold dampness in the intestines and stomach** [肠胃寒湿] **blocks heat circulation** [热无所行], requiring **scorching of the chest cavity** [灼胸府], hence **chest discomfort** [胸中不便] and **indigestion** [食饮不化]. **Silent retching** [呕而密默] signifies **a desire for stillness** [静定]. **A harsh sensation in the throat** [喉中恶玲] causes **spitting of clear fluids** [唾吐玲水]. If **cold qi shifts its position** [寒气易位], ascending into the **lungs and throat** [肺喉], it obstructs **the breath’s Dao/Way** [息道], resulting in **coughing and wheezing with throat sounds** [咳喘而喉中有声]. **Water stagnates in flat terrain** [水居平泽], so **fish swim in the marketplace** [鱼游於市]. **Head crown and chest pain** [头顶胸痛] may also affect women, causing **additional pain in the brow region** [兼痛於眉问].

○**Newly annotated text states:** According to the **upper text** [上文], **Tài-yīn [太阴] is at the spring** [在泉], and **head and neck pain resemble techniques** [头痛项似技]. It is also stated that **Tài-yīn governs the heavens** [司天], causing **head and neck pain** [头项痛], but here it reads **head crown pain** [头顶痛], where **crown** [顶] likely should be **neck** [项]. If **the Tài-xī [太溪] Dao/Way is severed** [绝], death is **untreatable** [死不治]. **Tài-xī [太溪]** refers to **the kidney’s channel and qi** [肾脉气].

In **the Shào-yáng [少阳] reversal** [复], **great heat is imminent** [大热将至], causing **dryness and scorching heat** [枯燥墦热], which **depletes insects** [介虫乃耗]. **Sudden coughing and throat spasms** [惊愈咳钮] occur alongside **heart heat and restlessness** [心热烦躁], **frequent bowel movements and aversion to wind** [便数憎风], **rising of jué-qi [厥气]** to the face, resembling **floating dust** [面如浮埃], and **eyes becoming dry and irritated** [目乃娴愈]. **Fire erupts internally** [火气内发], **ascending to cause oral ulcers** [上为口糜], **nausea and vomiting** [呕逆], **blood overflow and hemorrhage** [血溢血泄], **malaria-like fevers** [发而为疟], **aversion to cold with shivering** [恶寒鼓栗], **extreme cold followed by heat** [寒极反热], **throat dryness and cracking** [哑络焦槁], **thirst for watery fluids** [渴饮水浆], **yellowish or ruddy complexion** [色变黄赤], **weakened qi and withered pulse** [少气脉萎], **heat transforming into water** [化而为水], **leading to elbow swelling** [传为驸肿], and in severe cases, **penetrating the lungs** [入肺], causing **coughing with blood overflow** [咳而血泄]. **Fire’s rampant violence** [火气专暴] **dries grasses and plants** [桔燥草木], **spontaneously generating flames** [翻焰自生], hence the **reversed heat** [翻热]. **Internal fire blazes** [火内炽], causing **sudden coughing and throat spasms** [惊疼咳钮], **heart heat and restlessness** [心热烦躁], and **frequent bowel movements with aversion to wind** [便数憎风]. **Fire flares upward** [火炎於上], **affecting all things**, hence the **dust-like appearance on the face** [浮埃] and **irritated eyes** [娴动]. **Fire scorches internally** [火烁於内], leading to **oral and lingual ulcers with vomiting** [口舌糜斓呕逆], as well as **blood overflow and hemorrhage** [血溢血泄]. **Wind and fire interacting** [风火相薄] **produces warm malaria** [为温疟]. **Qi steams and heat transforms** [气蒸热化], resulting in **water-related diseases** [水病], which **progress to elbow swelling** [传为肘肿]. **Drastic swelling** [驸], where **both skin and flesh swell** [皮肉俱肿], **indents upon pressure and does not rebound** [按之陷下，泥而不起], are all **symptoms generated by fire** [火气所生]. If **the Chi-Zé [尺泽, 肺脉气]** is severed [绝], death is **untreatable** [死不治].

In **the Yángmíng [阳明] reversal** [复], **cool qi prevails** [清气大举], causing **forest plants to wither prematurely** [森木苍乾], and **hairy insects to perish** [毛虫乃厉]. **Disease originates in the flank** [病生胱胁], **with qi returning to the left** [气归於左], **frequent sighing** [善太息], and in severe cases, **heart pain and distension** [心痛否满], **abdominal bloating with diarrhea** [腹胀而泄], **bitter vomiting** [呕苦], **coughing foul fluids** [咳秽], **mental agitation** [烦心], **disease centered in the stomach** [病在鬲中], and **headache** [头痛], which in extreme cases **penetrates the liver** [入肝], causing **startle-induced muscle spasms** [惊骇筋挛]. **Killing qi prevails** [杀气大举], and **wood cannot resist it**, hence **plants turn blue-green and wither before turning yellow** [苍青之叶，不及黄而乾燥]. **Ulceration and pestilence** [厉] refers to **lesions and fatal epidemics** [疵疠，疾疫死]. When **coolness prevails internally** [清甚於内] and **heat is suppressed externally** [热郁於外], it follows this pattern. If **the Tài-chōng [太冲] Dao/Way is severed** [绝], death is **untreatable** [死不治]. **Tài-chōng [太冲]** refers to **the liver’s channel and qi** [肝脉气].

In **the Tài-yáng [太阳] reversal** [复], **jué-qi [厥气] ascends** [上行], **water condenses into rain and freezes into ice** [水凝雨冰], and **winged insects die** [羽虫乃死]. **Cold arises in the heart and stomach** [心胃生寒], causing **chest discomfort** [胸中不利], **heart pain and distension** [心痛否满], **headache with melancholy** [头痛善悲], **occasional dizziness and collapse** [时眩仆], **indigestion** [食臧], **waist stiffness turning into pain** [腰雅反痛], **difficulty in bending and stretching** [屈伸不便], **earth cracking and ice solidifying** [地裂冰坚], **and the sun’s Dao/Way failing to treat cold** [阳光不治]. In severe cases, **the lower abdomen contracts the testicles** [少腹控睪], **pulling the waist and spine** [引腰脊], **and ascending to assault the heart** [上冲心], causing **spitting clear water** [唾出清水], **and hiccups** [及为喊噫], which may **penetrate the heart** [入心], leading to **amnesia and melancholy** [善忘善悲]. **Rain-ice** [雨冰] refers to **hail** [雹]. **Cold encountering hail** [寒而遇雹] **is particularly fatal** [死亦其宜]. **Cold transforms into earth** [寒化於地], and its **upper layer is soil**, hence **the earth’s structure cracks** [地体分裂] and **water accumulates into solid ice** [水积冰坚]. If **this condition persists without resolution** [久而不释], it indicates **the sun’s Dao/Way failing to treat cold** [阳光不治] **and the congealing of water** [寒凝之物]. The **Tài-yáng [太阳] reversal** [复] **does not align with its usual pattern** [与不相持], resulting in **upper dampness and lower cold** [上湿下寒], **fire having no place to go** [火无所往], **heart qi suppressed internally** [心气内郁], and **heat arising from this** [热由是生]. **Fire and heat internally congeal** [火热内墦], thus generating these **symptoms** [病].
○**Newly annotated text states:** The detailed annotation reads **does not align with its usual pattern** [与不相持], where the **character "不"** [not] **likely should be "土"** [earth].

If **the Shénmén [神门] Dao/Way is severed** [绝], death is **untreatable** [死不治]. **Shénmén [神门]** refers to **the true heart’s channel and qi** [真心脉气].

The **Emperor** [帝] said: **Well done** [善]. How should these **reversed conditions** [复气] be treated? **The Yellow Emperor** [岐伯] replied: In **the Juéyīn [厥阴] reversal** [复], **treat with sour and cold** [治以酸寒], **assist with sweet and pungent** [佐以甘辛], **to drain with sour** [以酸写之], **and moderate with sweet** [以甘缓之]. If **not moderated sufficiently** [不大缓之], **symptoms persist even in summer** [夏犹不已], and **the reversal intensifies** [复重於胜], hence **treat with pungent and cold** [故治以辛寒].
○**Newly annotated text states:** According to another version, **treat with pungent and cold** [治以辛寒] **instead of sour and cold** [酸寒].

In **the Shàoyīn [少阴] reversal** [复], **treat with salty and cold** [治以咸寒], **assist with bitter and pungent** [佐以苦辛], **to drain with sweet** [以甘写之], **and constrict with sour** [以酸收之], **to stimulate with bitter** [以苦发之], and **to consolidate with salty** [以咸奥之]. If **not induced to sweat profusely** [不大发汗], **treat with cold to attack internally** [以寒攻之], **and persist until mid-autumn** [持至仲秋], **internal heat will congeal and form heart heat** [热内伏结而为心热], resulting in **weakened qi and diminished strength** [少气少力], **and inability to rise** [而不能起].
○**Newly annotated text states:** **Internal heat, if suppressed, returns to the bones** [热伏不散，归於骨].

In **the Tài-yīn [太阴] reversal** [复], **treat with bitter and hot** [治以苦热], **assist with sour and pungent** [佐以酸辛], **to drain with bitter** [以苦写之], **to dry with bitter** [燥之], and **to purge with bitter** [泄之].

「If **dryness and purgation** [燥泄] are not applied, **prolonged illness will lead to body swelling and abdominal distension** [身肿腹满], **stiff joints** [关节不利], **and when it reaches the stage of *Fù-tu* [伏兔] and *Fèi-mǎn* [怫满], internal turmoil ensues** [内作], **manifesting as *Shǔ* [膝] and *Yāo* [腰]—**the inner lateral sides of the knees and waist—**becoming **congested and swollen** [驸肿], **a condition known as *bone-heat disease* [骨热病].**

In **the Shǎo-yáng [少阳] reversal** [复], **treat with salty and resonant** [咸玲] **therapies** [治], **assist with bitter and pungent** [佐以苦辛], **to consolidate with salty** [以咸奥之], **to constrict with sour** [以酸收之], **and to stimulate with pungent and bitter** [辛苦发之].
**Sweating should not stray far from the heat** [发不远热], **nor should one violate the principle of avoiding excessive warmth or cold** [无犯温凉].**

**The Shǎo-yín [少阴] reversal follows the same method** [同法].

If **sweating is not induced to deplete excessive Yang** [不发汗以夺盛阳], **internal heat will pervade the four limbs** [热内淫於四支], **resulting in *Jiě-rán* [解然]—**a fever of indeterminate nature** [不可名也].**
**When heat is not extreme, when cold is not extreme, when strength is not extreme, or when weakness is not extreme**, **it cannot be named or described** [不可以名言], **thus it is called *Jiě-rán* [解然].** **Rudimentary physicians label this as *Guǐ-qì è bìng* [鬼气恶病]—**the malevolent *ghost-qi* disease.**

If **this condition persists unabated** [久久不已], **then bone heat, marrow depletion, and dry teeth ensue** [骨热髓涸齿乾], **thus manifesting as *bone-heat disease* [骨热病].**
**Since sweating depletes Yang**, **there should be no lingering heat** [故无留热]. **Therefore, even if heat-induced illness arises in summer**, **once recovery begins, hot therapies are still used to stimulate sweating** [及差亦用热药以发之].

However, **during spring and autumn**, **even if fire-heat prevails** [纵火热胜], **one must not use hot therapies to induce sweating** [亦不得以热药发汗], **for if sweating does not occur while heat remains intense internally** [汗不发而药热内甚], **it will exacerbate the illness, leading to intermittent fever** [助病为疟], **and offend the *Shén* [神]—**the vital spirits.** **Hence, the admonition: *do not violate warmth and cold* [无犯温凉].**

**In the Shǎo-yín [少阴] reversal**, **the method for heat is the same** [气热，为疗则同], **thus it is stated: *follows the same method as Shǎo-yín* [故云与少阴同法也].**

If **sweating is repeatedly suppressed** [数夺其汗], **then the body fluids will be exhausted and dried up** [津液竭涸], **hence the use of sour to constrict** [以酸收] **and salty to moisten** [以咸润].

○**Newly annotated text states:** According to *The Great Treatise on the Six Elements* [《六元正纪大论》], **it is said: *sweating should not stray far from the heat* [发表不远热].**

In **the Yáng-míng [阳明] reversal** [复], **treat with pungent and warm** [治以辛温], **assist with bitter and sweet** [佐以苦甘], **to purge with bitter** [以苦泄之], **to descend with bitter** [以苦下之], **and to supplement with sour** [以酸补之].
**Purgation refers to permeation and drainage** [泄谓渗泄], **including sweating, urination, and baths** [汗及小便、汤浴皆是也].

**Around the Autumnal Equinox** [秋分前后], **sweating may also be induced** [则亦发之], **and in cases of excess during spring**, **follow the method of the excess** [春有胜则依胜法]. **If the condition does not cease**, **also use decoctions or immersions to harmonize internally and externally** [或不已，亦汤渍和其中外也].

**After an outbreak of anger** [怒复之后], **the *qi* is all depleted** [其气皆虚], **hence supplementing to secure the *qi*** [故补之以安全其气].

**The remaining reversals follow the same treatment principles** [余复治同].

In **the Tài-yáng [太阳] reversal** [复], **treat with salty and hot** [治以咸热], **assist with sweet and pungent** [佐以甘辛], **and to solidify with bitter** [以苦坚之].
**If not solidified**, **internal cold *qi* will transform and fluctuate** [寒气内变], **stopping and restarting, restarting and stopping** [止而复发，发而复止], **dragging on for years** [绵历年岁], **and giving rise to a great cold ailment** [生大寒疾].

**In treating all excess reversals** [治诸胜复], **apply heat to cold conditions** [寒者热之], **cold to heat conditions** [热者寒之], **cooling to excessive warmth** [温者清之], **warming to excessive cooling** [清者温之], **constriction to dispersion** [散者收之], **dispersion to suppression** [抑者散之], **moistening to dryness** [燥者润之], **gentleness to urgency** [急者缓之], **consolidation to fragility** [脆者坚之], **supplementation to depletion** [一哀者补之], **and purgation to excess** [强者写之]. **Each therapy should stabilize the *qi*** [各安其气], **and must be both clear and tranquil** [必清必静], **then the pathogenic *qi* will weaken and depart** [则病气衰去], **returning to its original source** [归其所宗]. **This is the fundamental principle of treatment** [此治之大体也].

**The Tài-yáng [太阳] *qi* is cold**, **the Shǎo-yín [少阴] and Shǎo-yáng [少阳] *qi* are hot**, **the Jué-yín [厥阴] *qi* is warm**, **the Yáng-míng [阳明] *qi* is cooling**, **and the Tài-yīn [太阴] *qi* is damp** [太阴气湿]. **In cases of excess reversal**, **each should be doubled in its respective *qi* to regulate it** [有胜复则各倍其气以调之], **thus restoring balance** [故可使平也].
**宗 [Zōng] means *affiliation* [属].**

If **regulation does not deviate from principle** [调不失理], **then the remaining *qi* will return to its proper domain** [则余之气自归其所属], **and the deficient *qi* will settle in its proper abode** [少之气自安其所居]. **Once the excess reversal has subsided** [胜复衰已], **each should be supplemented and nourished to achieve stability** [则各补养而平定之]. **If the *qi* is clear and the spirit tranquil** [爻清铃静], **and there is no reckless disturbance** [无妄挠之], **then the Six *Qi* will cycle harmoniously** [则六气循环], **and the Five *Shén* [神]—**the vital spirits—**will remain secure** [五神安泰].

If **the seasonal *Qi*’s cold or heat** [运气之寒热] **is treated and balanced** [治之平之], **it will also return to govern the *Tīan* [天] and *Dì* [地] *Qi*** [亦各归司天地气也].

**至真要大论篇下** [至真要大论篇下]:

The **Emperor** [帝] asked: **How does the *Qi* move above and below** [气之上下，何谓也]?

**Qibo** [岐伯] replied: **Above the midpoint of the body, there are three *Qi*** [身半以上，其气三矣], **divided by Heaven** [天之分也], **ruled by the *Tīan* [天] *Qi*** [天气主之]; **below the midpoint of the body, there are three *Qi*** [身半以下，其气三矣], **divided by Earth** [地之分也], **ruled by the *Dì* [地] *Qi*** [地气主之].

**The *Qi* are named according to their domain** [以名命气], **and their domain is determined by the *Qi*** [以气命处], **to speak of their diseases** [而言其病]. **The midpoint is called the *Tīanshū* [天枢]**. **The midpoint of the body is precisely the navel** [身之半，正谓脐中也]. **Some take the waist as the midpoint of the body** [或以腰为身半], **but this is because they consider the center as the essence** [是以居中为义], **exceeding the Heavenly midpoint** [过天中也]. **All people of the Central Plains follow this** [中原之人悉如此矣].

**When extending the arm to point to Heaven and stretching the foot to point to Earth, measuring with a cord** [当伸臂指天，舒足指地，以绳量之], **the midpoint aligns with the navel** [中正当脐也], **hence it is also called *Tīanshū* [天枢]**. **The *Tīanshū* [天枢] is precisely the region two *cùn* [寸] above the navel, corresponding to the two *cùn* [寸] of the body’s measurement** [天枢，正当脐两傍，同身寸之二寸也].

**The three *Qi* above the midpoint** [其气三者]: **for instance, if *Shǎoyīn* [少阴] *Qi* governs Heaven** [假如少阴司天], **then there is *Rè* [热] *Qi* above and the *Tàiyáng* [太阳] *Qi* in the center, making three** [则上有热中有太阳兼之三也]. **This applies to all Six *Qi*** [六气皆然].

**The *Qi* governing Heaven have three domains** [司天者其气三], **and the *Qi* governing Earth have three domains** [司地者其气三], **hence there are three *Qi* above the midpoint of the body and three below** [故身半以上三气，身半以下三气也]. **The *Qi* are named according to their domains** [以名言其气], **their domains are determined by the *Qi*** [以气言其处], **and the diseases caused by the *Qi*’s imbalance of cold and heat are described by their symptoms** [以气处寒热，而言其病之形证也].

**For example, the *Qi* of the Foot *Juéyīn* [厥阴] channel** [则如足厥阴气] **resides within the inner aspect of the foot and thigh, ascending through the lower abdomen and following the ribs** [居足及股经之内侧，上行於少腹循胁]. **The Foot *Yángmíng* [阳明] *Qi*** [足阳明气] **is located above the foot, outside the *Fǔ* [腑], and in front of the thigh, ascending beside the abdomen and navel, following the chest and breasts to the surface** [在足之上，腑之外，股之前，上行腹脐之傍，循胸乳上面]. **The Foot *Tàiyáng* [太阳] *Qi*** [足太阳气] **originates at the eyes, ascends to the forehead and connects with the head, descends to the back of the neck and spine, passes across the waist, and horizontally traverses the *Páishū* [牌枢] and posterior thigh before descending into the *Shǐ* [驸], passing through the *Duǎn* [端], and emerging behind the lateral malleolus of the foot, at the outer side of the little toe** [下项背过腰，横过牌枢股后，下行入驸贯端，出外踝之后，足小指外侧]. **The Foot *Tàiyīn* [太阴] *Qi*** [足太阴气] **follows the inner aspect of the foot and thigh, ascending to the front of the abdomen and ribs** [循足及股经之内侧，上行腹胁之前]. **The Foot *Shǎoyīn* [少阴] *Qi* follows the same path** [足少阴同之]. **The Foot *Shǎoyáng* [少阳] *Qi*** [足少阳气] **follows the outer aspect of the channel, ascending beside the abdomen and ribs, and extending to the cheek, ear, and *Ruìbì* [锐毗], located at the side of the head** [循经外侧，上行腹胁之侧，循颊耳至目锐毗，在首之侧].

**These are the primary domains of the Six *Qi* of the Foot** [此足六气之部主也]. **The Hand *Juéyīn* [厥阴], *Shǎoyīn* [少阴], and *Tàiyīn* [太阴] *Qi*** [手厥阴少阴太阴气] **emanate horizontally from the chest and heart, following the inner aspect of the arm to the tips of the middle, ring, and index fingers** [从心胸横出，循臂内侧，至中指小指大指之端]. **The Hand *Yángmíng* [阳明], *Shǎoyáng* [少阳], and *Tàiyáng* [太阳] *Qi*** [手阳明少阳太阳气] **all originate at the Hand *Biǎo* [表], ascending along the outer aspect of the arm to the shoulder, upper arm, and head** [并起手表，循臂外侧，上肩及甲上头].

**These are the primary domains of the Six *Qi* of the Hand** [此手六气之部主也].

**To diagnose diseases, one must follow the *Qi*’s location and speak accordingly** [欲知病诊，当随气所在以言之]. **For the *Yīn* [阴] aspect, diseases are attributed to cold** [当阴之分，玲病归之], **and for the *Yáng* [阳] aspect, diseases are attributed to heat** [当阳之分，热病归之]. **Hence, when discussing the excess reversal of *Qi*** [故胜复之作], **it first mentions diseases caused by cold and heat** [先言病生寒热者], **which must rely on this principle of *Qi*** [必依此物理也].

**Newly corrected text states** [○新校正云]: **According to the *Lù Wēi Zhì Dà Lùn* [六微旨大论], it is said: **Above the *Tīanshū* [天枢], the *Yáng* [阳] *Qi* governs** [天枢之上，夭气主之], **below the *Tīanshū* [天枢], the *Yīn* [阴] *Qi* governs** [天枢之下，地气主之], **and the realm where the *Qi* intersect is where human *Qi* originates** [气交之分，人气从之]. **Thus, when the upper *Qi* prevails and the lower *Qi* is also diseased, it is named according to Earth** [故上胜而下俱病者，以地名之]; **when the lower *Qi* prevails and the upper *Qi* is also diseased, it is named according to Heaven** [下#1胜而上俱病者，以天名之].

**If one *Qi* prevails while the other cannot yet reverse** [彼气既胜，此未能复], **it is suppressed and cannot flow freely** [抑#2郁不畅], **and has nowhere to go** [而无所行]. **Advancing further, it is hindered by great obstacles** [进则困於伟嫌], **and retreating, it is confined by resentment and blockage** [退则穷於怫塞]. **Hence, when the upper *Qi* prevails to its extreme, the lower *Qi* is also diseased** [故上胜至则下与俱病], **and when the lower *Qi* prevails to its extreme, the upper *Qi* is also diseased** [下胜至则上与俱病].

「When the upper *Qi* prevails and the lower *Qi* is diseased, it is the Earth *Qi* that is congested [上胜下病，地气郁也], hence it is named *Earth Disease* [故从地郁以名地病]. When the lower *Qi* prevails and the upper *Qi* is diseased, it is the Heaven *Qi* that is blocked [下胜上病，天气塞也], hence it is named *Heaven Disease* [故从天塞以名天病].

The principle of naming according to Heaven [夫以天名者] means that one aligns with the Heaven *Qi* as the standard and counters the Earth *Qi* with attack. The principle of naming according to Earth [以地名者], if the Heaven *Qi* is the standard, is acceptable; for instance, when *Yangming* [陽明] governs Heaven and *Shaoyin* [少陰] is in the *Spring* [泉], if the upper *Qi* prevails and the lower *Qi* is also diseased, it arises from resentment in the lower [是怫於下而生也]. When the Heaven *Qi* is truly prevailing, Heaven can be countered [天气正胜，天可逆之], hence aligning with the Heaven *Qi* is akin to purity [故顺天之气，方同清也]. If *Shaoyin* [少陰] or *Shaoyang* [少陽] govern Heaven, the law of upper and lower prevailing follows the same principle [少阴少阳在泉，为火居水位。 阳明司天，为金居火位。 金复其胜，则火主胜之。 火复其胜，则水主胜之].

The *New Corrected Edition* states: According to the *Six Elements Standard Cycle Theory* [《六元正纪大论》], when the upper *Qi* prevails, the Heaven *Qi* descends and the lower is affected; when the lower *Qi* prevails, the Earth *Qi* ascends and the upper is affected [上胜则天气降而下，下胜则地气逆而上，此之谓也]. The so-called "prevailing to its extreme" [胜至] refers to the *reaction Qi* [报气] being subdued but not yet manifesting [报气屈伏而未发也], whereas when the *reaction Qi* manifests [复至], it does not follow the Heaven-Earth divergent naming [不以天地异名], but rather adheres to the principle of the *reaction Qi* [皆如复气为法也]. When the prevailing *Qi* has not yet reacted and disease arises [胜至未复而病生], the Heaven-Earth divergent naming is applied [以天地异名为式]. Once the *reaction Qi* manifests [复气已发], the resulting disease, whether from upper or lower prevailing, all depends on the *reaction Qi* [悉皆依复气为病], and the *Qi* of cold and heat governs it [寒热之主也].

The Emperor said: Are there fixed times for the dynamics of prevailing and reaction [胜复之动]? Is there a necessity in the *Qi* [气有必乎]? Qibo replied: There are fixed positions for time [时有常位], but the *Qi* has no necessity [而气无必也]. Though time has fixed positions, the manifestation and movement of the *Qi* may vary [虽位有常，而发动有无], and it cannot be rigidly determined [不铃定之也].

The Emperor said: I wish to hear its principle [愿闻其道也]. Qibo replied: From the beginning of the *prevailing Qi* [初气] to the end of the third *prevailing Qi* [终三气], the Heaven *Qi* governs [天气主之], and this is the fixed principle of prevailing [胜之常也]. From the fourth *prevailing Qi* [四气] to the end of the sixth *prevailing Qi* [尽终气], the Earth *Qi* governs [地气主之], and this is the fixed principle of reaction [复之常也]. When there is prevailing, there is reaction; when there is no prevailing, there is no reaction [有胜则复，无胜则否].

The Emperor said: Good [善]. What happens when reaction occurs and then prevailing resumes [复已而胜何如]? Qibo replied: When prevailing reaches its extreme [胜至], reaction follows [则复], but there is no fixed number [无常数]. If prevailing is slight [胜微], reaction is also slight [则复微], hence reaction may occur and prevailing resume again [故复已而又胜]. If prevailing is extreme [胜甚], reaction is also extreme [则复甚], hence reaction occurring means there is little chance of prevailing again [故复已则少有再胜者也]. Even if there is prevailing, it follows the principle of slight or extreme reaction [亦随微甚而复之尔]. However, the principle of prevailing and reaction, though without fixed numbers [虽无常数], when they decline [至其衰谢], both prevailing and reaction naturally cease [则胜复皆自止也].

When reaction occurs and then prevailing resumes [复已而胜], if there is no reaction, it becomes harmful [不复则害], and this is the injury of life [此伤生也]. If there is prevailing but no reaction [有胜无复], it means the *reaction Qi* has already declined [复气已衰], and the decline cannot react [衰不能复], indicating that the true Heaven *Qi* has been severely injured [天真之气已伤败甚], and the vital intention is exhausted [而生意尽].

The Emperor said: Why does reaction lead to the recurrence of disease [复而反病何也]? Qibo replied: It is because the *Qi* resides in a position that is not its own [居非其位], and thus they cannot harmonize [不相得也]. When the reaction is excessive against the prevailing [大复其胜], the prevailing *Qi* dominates [则主胜之], hence the recurrence of disease [故反病也]. If the governing *Qi* of a phase [己官观] is exhausted and borrowed from another phase [适於他邦], the governing *Qi*’s strength has declined [己力已衰], and the governing *Qi* cannot dominate [主不相得], resentment follows [怨随其后]. Only when the borrowed *Qi* is convenient [唯便是求] does the prevailing *Qi* reach its extreme and then the governing *Qi* retaliates [故力极而复，主反袭之], leading to the disease recurring from itself [反自病者也]. This is what is called *fire-drying-heat* [所谓火燥热也].

*Shaoyang* [少陽] is *fire* [火], *Yangming* [陽明] is *drying* [燥], and *Shaoyin* [少陰] is *heat* [热]. When *Shaoyin* [少陰] and *Shaoyang* [少陽] are in the *Spring* [泉], it is *fire* residing in the *water* position [为火居水位]. When *Yangming* [陽明] governs Heaven, it is *metal* residing in the *fire* position [为金居火位]. When *metal* reacts against its prevailing [金复其胜], *fire* governs the prevailing [则火主胜之]. When *fire* reacts against its prevailing [火复其胜], *water* governs the prevailing [则水主胜之]. If the remaining *Qi* prevails and reacts, there is no governing *Qi* of prevailing that causes disease [余气胜复，则无主胜之病气也]. Hence, it is said again: this is what is called *fire-drying-heat* [故又日所谓火燥热也].

The Emperor said: How should it be treated [治之奈何]? Qibo replied: When the *Qi* prevails, if it is slight [微者], follow its principle [随之]; if it is extreme [甚者], restrain it [制之]. When the *Qi* reacts, if it is harmonious [和者], balance it [平之]; if it is violent [暴者], subdue it [夺之]. All treatments follow the prevailing *Qi*, ensuring its subjugation [安其屈伏], without regard to its quantity [无问其数], aiming for balance [以平为期], and this is the principle [此其道也].

*Follow* [随] means to follow its principle. *Ensure its subjugation* [安] means to align with the prevailing *Qi* to harmonize it [顺胜气以和之也]. *Restraint* [制] means to suppress. *Balance* [平] means to regulate. *Subdue* [夺] means to suppress the prevailing *Qi* [夺其胜气也]. Treating this follows no fixed number [治此者，不以数之多少], but rather takes the balanced and harmonious *Qi* as the standard [但以气平和为准度尔].

The Emperor said: Good [善]. How does the prevailing and reaction of *guest* and *host Qi* [客主之胜复] proceed? *Guest* refers to the six *Qi* of Heaven [客，谓天之六气]. *Host* refers to the five phases’ positions [主，谓五行之位也]. Since the *Qi* has suitable and unsuitable conditions [气有宜否], each has its own prevailing and reaction [故各有胜复之者].

Qibo replied: The prevailing and reaction of *guest* and *host Qi* [客主之气] may occur without reaction [胜而无复也]. The *guest* and *host Qi* inherently have varying degrees [客主自有多少], and this differs from the fixed principle of prevailing [以其为胜与常胜殊].

The Emperor said: How do they conform or deviate [其逆从何如]? Qibo replied: When the *host Qi* prevails, it deviates [主胜逆]; when the *guest Qi* prevails, it conforms [客胜从], as per the Heavenly principle [天之道也]. The *guest Qi* follows the Heavenly mandate [客承天命], governing its region [部统其方], and the *host Qi* is subordinate [主为之下], naturally it should reverently follow the Heavenly mandate [固宜祗奉天命]. If it does not conform and yet prevails, the Heavenly mandate cannot proceed [不顺而胜，则天命不行], hence it deviates [故为逆也]. When the *guest Qi* prevails over the *host Qi* [客胜於主], it follows the Heavenly mandate and proceeds according to principle [承天而行], hence it conforms [理之道，故为顺也].

The Emperor said: How do they generate disease [其生病何如]? Qibo replied: When *Jueyin* [厥阴] governs Heaven, if the *guest Qi* prevails, there is ringing in the ears and dizziness [耳呜掉眩], severe cases involve coughing [甚则咳]; if the *host Qi* prevails, there is chest and flank pain, and difficulty in speaking [主胜则胸胁痛，舌难以言]. This occurs in the *Five Yi* [五巳] and *Five Hai* [五亥] years [岁也].

When *Shaoyin* [少陰] governs Heaven, if the *guest Qi* prevails, there is sneezing and stiffness in the neck and shoulders [欤嚏颈项强], shoulder and back heat [肩背瞥热], headache, shortness of breath [头痛少气], fever, deafness, and blurred vision [发热，耳聋，目瞑], severe cases involve scrotal swelling and blood overflow [甚则驸肿血溢], as well as sores, coughing, and wheezing [疮疡咳喘]; if the *host Qi* prevails, there is heart heat and restlessness [心热烦躁], severe cases involve flank pain and fullness in the hypochondrium [甚则胁痛支满]. This occurs in the *Five Zi* [五子] and *Five Wu* [五午] years [岁也].

When *Taiyin* [太阴] governs Heaven, if the *guest Qi* prevails, there is scrotal and facial swelling [首面驸肿], and difficulty in breathing [呼吸气喘]; if the *host Qi* prevails, there is fullness in the chest and abdomen [胸腹满], and belching after eating [食已而瞥]. This occurs in the *Five Chou* [五丑] and *Five Wei* [五未] years [岁也].

When *Shaoyang* [少陽] governs Heaven, if the *guest Qi* prevails, it manifests as external *measles* [丹脍外发], or as *measles*-like sores [及为丹嫖疮疡], vomiting, throat obstruction [呕逆喉痹], headache, and constricted swelling [头痛隘肿], deafness, and blood strangulation [耳聋血缢], internally causing *moles* and *herpes* [内为痣症]; if the *host Qi* prevails, there is chest fullness [胸满], coughing with upward gaze and labored breathing [咳仰息], severe cases may involve blood, and the hands are hot [甚而有血，手热]. This occurs in the *Five Yin* [五寅] and *Five Shen* [五申] years [岁也].

When *Yangming* [陽明] governs Heaven, if the *guest Qi* of *clear* [清] reacts internally and the *guest Qi* remains, it causes coughing with a sensation of obstruction [咳钮嗑塞], heat in the *epigastrium* [心鬲中热], incessant coughing, and the emission of white blood [咳不止，而白血出者死], leading to death [死].」

The return [復] refers to returning to one’s original abode [居].
White blood [白血] refers to coughing up pale red blood, resembling flesh or lung tissue.

In the *Five Mao* [五卯] and *Five You* [五酉] years [歲也].

Qì Bó said: *"The excessive must be suppressed, the deficient must be elevated, the overabundant must be reduced, the insufficient must be replenished. Assist with what is beneficial, harmonize with what is suitable. Ensure the balance between guest and host, adjust cold and warmth as needed. When the *Qi* are compatible, treat them oppositely; when incompatible, treat them according to their nature.*

*To suppress the excessive is to control its dominance. To elevate the deficient is to reinforce its weakness. To reduce the overabundant is to temper its sharpness. To replenish the insufficient is to preserve its *Qi*. Though one may control dominance and support weakness, guest and host must still be balanced. If the *Qi* lose their proper place, then contradictions arise, thorns and brambles flourish, each seizing its opportunity, failing to align—thus internal excess and external depletion occur, and the path to danger and failure begins.*

*Compatibility refers to cold, heat, warmth, and coolness, where the *Qi* harmonize among themselves. Incompatibility refers to Water, Fire, Metal, Wood, and Earth, which do not harmonize. When the *Qi* align, one treats them by countering the dominant *Qi*. When they do not align, one treats them by following the non-dominant *Qi*.*

*In treating Fire, whether in excess or deficiency, if one wishes to increase it, use its flavor; if one wishes to reduce it, also use its flavor—whether dominant or not, its *Qi* must be tempered. Why? Because its nature is impulsive and restless. The same applies in treating Heat."*

The Emperor said: *"I understand: treating cold with warmth, treating heat with cold, countering when the *Qi* align, and following when they do not. But I wish to hear about the three categories of Yin and Yang—what are they called?"*

Qì Bó replied: *"The host of the **Wood** position, for reduction use **sour**, for replenishment use **pungent**; the **Wood** position is the sixty-one days before the Spring Equinox, the first of the *Qi*.

The host of the **Fire** position, for reduction use **sweet**, for replenishment use **salty**; the **Jūn Fire** position is the sixty-one days after the Spring Equinox, the second of the *Qi*. The **Xiāng Fire** position is the thirty days before and after the Summer Solstice, the third of the *Qi*. Though the two Fire *Qi* differ in nature, their treatment principles remain unified.

The host of the **Earth** position, for reduction use **bitter**, for replenishment use **sweet**; the **Earth** position is the sixty-one days before the Autumn Equinox, the fourth of the *Qi*.

The host of the **Metal** position, for reduction use **pungent**, for replenishment use **sour**; the **Metal** position is the sixty-one days after the Autumn Equinox, the fifth of the *Qi*.

The host of the **Water** position, for reduction use **salty**, for replenishment use **bitter**; the **Water** position is the thirty days before and after the Winter Solstice, the final of the *Qi*.

For **Yùnyīn** as a guest, replenish with **pungent**, reduce with **sour**, and moderate with **sweet**; for **Shàoyīn** as a guest, replenish with **salty**, reduce with **sweet**, and consolidate with **salty**. *(The newly corrected annotation states: According to the *Zàng Qì Fǎ Shí Lùn* [藏气法时论], for the Heart, use **bitter** to moderate, and if it desires excess, quickly use **sour** to consolidate it. If it desires further change, quickly use **salty** to alter it. The previous statement that "consolidate with **salty**" is incorrect.)*

For **Tàiyīn** as a guest, replenish with **sweet**, reduce with **bitter**, and moderate with **sweet**; for **Shàoyáng** as a guest, replenish with **salty**, reduce with **sweet**, and invigorate with **salty**; for **Yángmíng** as a guest, replenish with **sour**, reduce with **pungent**, and drain with **bitter**; for **Tàiyáng** as a guest, replenish with **bitter**, reduce with **salty**, solidify with **bitter**, and moisten with **pungent**. This opens the pathways of dominance, directs the **Jīn Yè** [津液], and harmonizes the *Qi*.

The guest *Qi* reside in each position for sixty-one days, without fixed abode, following the seasonal shifts. When guest *Qi* dominate, reduce the guest and replenish the host; when host *Qi* dominate, reduce the host and replenish the guest. Treat according to whether the situation calls for moderation or urgency."*

Qi varies in abundance, differing in its applications. **Tàiyīn** is the true yin, **Tàiyáng** is the true yang; the next lesser ones are **Shàoyīn** and **Shàoyáng**, then **Yángmíng**, and finally **Juéyīn**, which is the culmination of yin. This meaning is fully elucidated in the *Língshū Jìrìyuè Lùn* [灵枢系日月论].

The newly revised text states: According to the *Liùyuán Zhèngjì Dàlùn* [六元正纪大论], what is meant by "Qi varies in abundance"? Guǐtū Qū [鬼突区] said: The *Qi* of yin and yang each have varying degrees of abundance, hence the saying "three yin and three yang."

The Emperor asked: What is meant by **Yángmíng**?
Qíbó replied: It is the confluence of the two yangs.
The *Língshū Jìrìyuè Lùn* [灵枢系日月论] states: The month of Chén [辰] is the third month, governing the **Yángmíng** of the left foot; the month of Wèi [巳] is the fourth month, governing the **Yángmíng** of the right foot. The two yangs converge in advance, hence it is called **Yángmíng**.

The Emperor asked: What is meant by **Juéyīn**?
Qíbó replied: It is the complete intersection of the two yins.
The *Língshū Fánrìyuè Lùn* [灵枢繁日月论] states: The month of Xū [戌] is the ninth month, governing the **Yuèyīn** [厌阴] of the right foot; the month of Hài [亥] is the tenth month, governing the **Yuèyīn** of the left foot. The two yins fully intersect, hence it is called **Juéyīn**.

The Emperor said: Qi varies in abundance, diseases fluctuate in severity; the newly revised text states: According to the *Liùyuán Zhèngjì Dàlùn* [六元正纪大论], the body varies in strength. Treatment has its urgency or moderation, prescriptions have their size—great or small. I wish to hear the principles governing these distinctions.

Qíbó replied: Qi has high and low positions, diseases have distant and near origins, symptoms manifest internally or externally, and treatments have varying degrees of weight. One must align the treatment to its intended target—this is the principle. The **Zàng** [藏] and **Fǔ** [府] have high and low positions, diseases and symptoms have superficial or deep layers, and medicinal applications have their own degrees of potency. Adjust the dosage to match the abundance, balance the tension and slackness, and ensure the medicinal *Qi* reaches the site of the disease—this is the way. Do not overdo or underdo it.

The *Dàyào* [大要] states:
- *"Jūn* one, *Chén* two—this is the principle of odd prescriptions;
- *Jūn* two, *Chén* four—this is the principle of even prescriptions;
- *Jūn* two, *Chén* three—this is the principle of odd prescriptions;
- *Jūn* three, *Chén* six—this is the principle of even prescriptions."

Odd refers to ancient single-herb prescriptions; even refers to ancient compound prescriptions. Both single and compound prescriptions vary in size, hence the odd prescriptions state: *Jūn* one, *Chén* two; *Jūn* two, *Chén* three; while the even prescriptions state: *Jūn* two, *Chén* four; *Jūn* three, *Chén* six. Diseases vary in size, *Qi* in distance, and treatments in weight—this is what is meant by "principle."

Thus it is said: For nearby diseases, use odd or even prescriptions; for distant ones, adjust the dosage accordingly. Small dosages are given more frequently; large ones less often. When frequent, administer in sets of nine; when sparse, in sets of two. The volume of decoctions and pills follows this principle as well.

Near and far refer to the positions of the **Zàng** [藏] and **Fǔ** [府]. The heart and lungs are considered near, the liver and kidneys far, while the spleen and stomach reside in between. The three yangs—governing the bladder, gallbladder, and bile—also have near and far distinctions: the upper third of the body is near, the lower third is far.

Some practitioners may perceive distant or subtle patterns, thus combining odd and even principles in their dosages—odd prescriptions with even parts, even prescriptions with odd parts. In such cases, if a disease is near and treated with even principles, administer more frequently; if far and treated with odd principles, administer less frequently. Thus, the lungs receive nine doses, the heart seven, the spleen five, the liver three, and the kidneys one—this is the principle of odd prescriptions.

Hence it is said: Small dosages require more frequent administration; large ones require fewer.

The newly revised text states: Detailed annotations clarify that the "three yangs" and "three intestines" in the original text were likely misrecorded. The yangs have no meaning here, and "three intestines" is also unsatisfactory. The intestines have large and small distinctions, and the term *sāng* [胪] refers to the small intestine. Since the large and small intestines have already been mentioned, it is incorrect to refer to "three intestines." The "three" should be "two."

When odd prescriptions fail, resort to even ones—this is called a "double prescription." When even prescriptions fail, use opposite properties to treat them, as in the principle of "leaping contrary" with cold and hot, warm and cool, to address the disease's *Qi*.

Prescriptions should prefer lightness over excess, gentleness over toxicity, and smallness over largeness. Therefore, if an odd prescription fails, an even one is used; if an even prescription is ineffective, revert to one opposing property to observe the disease's *Qi* and treat accordingly.

Now, heat and cold oppose each other, cold and heat contradict one another. A slight heat may be subdued by cold, and a slight cold may be dissipated by heat. Extreme cold or heat can either clash with a patient's inherent constitution or conflict with opposing *Qi*, causing discord. When their natures are incompatible, they do not harmonize—thus, one hesitates to attack them. If attacked, the disease's *Qi* and the medicinal *Qi* will resist each other, leading to self-generated heat and cold, which will further entrench the disease's fixed and stubborn defenses.

Thus, the Sage reverses the opposing *Qi* to observe its nature, ensuring the body’s *Qi* harmonizes in resonance. Then, he aligns their heat and cold, making what was once divergent now unified—dryness and moisture are subdued, rigidity and strength are weakened, and softness and frailty dissolve of their own accord.

The Yellow Emperor said: "Good. I know that diseases arise from the root. But if a disease originates from the *standard* (manifestation), how should one treat it?"

Qi Bo replied: "A disease that reverses its root will reveal the *standard*; a treatment that reverses the root will uncover the *standard*’s prescription. The *Qi* of Minor Yin and Major Yang are the same in root and *standard*—the remaining four *Qi* follow this principle."

The Yellow Emperor said: "Good. How does one discern the excess of the Six *Qi*?"

Qi Bo replied: "By riding their arrival. When the clear *Qi* comes in abundance, it is the triumph of dryness—the liver, associated with wood, contracts disease from it, which flows into the gallbladder.

When the hot *Qi* comes in abundance, it is the triumph of fire—the lungs, associated with metal and dryness, contract disease from it, which flows into the ileum and large intestine.
*[New annotation: The ileum (回肠) is the large intestine (大肠) in the *Jia Yi Jing* (《甲乙经》).]*

When the cold *Qi* comes in abundance, it is the triumph of water—the heart, associated with fire and heat, contracts disease from it, which flows into the Triple Burner and small intestine.

When the damp *Qi* comes in abundance, it is the triumph of earth—the kidneys, associated with water and cold, contract disease from it, which flows into the bladder.

When the wind *Qi* comes in abundance, it is the triumph of wood—the spleen, associated with earth and dampness, contracts disease from it, which flows into the stomach.

This is what is meant by contracting pathogenic *Qi* and generating disease. When the external *Qi* is rejected and the internal *Qi* is harmed, the inner and outer are displeased, and this leads to the progression of disease—this is called *sensing* (感).

If one rides the year’s deficiency, the pathogenic *Qi* will be severe. When wood is deficient in the year, the external clear *Qi* will prevail. When fire is deficient in the year, the external cold *Qi* will prevail. When earth is deficient in the year, the external wind *Qi* will prevail. When metal is deficient in the year, the external hot *Qi* will prevail. When water is deficient in the year, the external damp *Qi* will prevail. This is the year’s deficiency.

If the seasonal *Qi* is deficient, the external pathogenic *Qi* will prevail and be severe. If one loses the balance of the times, the pathogenic *Qi* will also be severe. When the Six *Qi* govern the body and clash with their assigned positions, they will generate disease, and the internal organs will respond according to what they cannot overcome, making the pathogenic *Qi* even more severe.

If one encounters the moon’s void, the pathogenic *Qi* will also be severe. This refers to the period before the upper crescent and after the lower crescent, when the moon’s orb is empty. If one is repeatedly exposed to pathogenic *Qi*, the disease becomes perilous. When the year’s *Qi* is already deficient and the pathogenic *Qi* arrives in abundance, this is repeated exposure. When the year’s *Qi* is deficient and Heaven’s *Qi* overcomes it, and at this time one is exposed to pathogenic *Qi*, this is also repeated exposure. If the internal *Qi* invites the pathogen and Heaven’s *Qi* does not assist, can the disease not become perilous? If there is an excess of *Qi*, it must return and reverse itself. Heaven and Earth’s *Qi* cannot be without interaction, so there is an excess of *Qi*, which will then return and reverse itself.

The Yellow Emperor said: "How does its pulse manifest upon arrival?"

Qi Bo replied: "When Minor Yin arrives, its pulse is taut—soft and hollow yet slippery, straight and long, this is called taut.
If it is strong and forceful, there is disease. If it is not strong yet faint, there is also disease. If it is not straight and long, there is disease. If it does not correspond to its position, there is disease. If its position cannot manifest tautness, there is also disease.

When Minor Yang arrives, its pulse is hook-shaped—arriving strong and departing weak, like a suspended belt with a hook, this is called hook-shaped.
If it arrives not strong but departs forceful, there is disease. If it arrives strong and departs strong, there is also disease. If it arrives not strong and departs not strong, there is disease. If it is not hook-shaped, there is disease. If it does not correspond to its position, there is disease. If its position cannot manifest hook-shaped, there is also disease.

When Major Yin arrives, its pulse is deep—deep, meaning downward. When pressed, it is obtained; this is the pulse of all downward positions.
If it is excessively deep, there is disease. If it is not deep, there is also disease. If it does not correspond to its position, there is disease. If its position cannot manifest depth, there is also disease.

When Minor Yang arrives, its pulse is large and floating—floating, meaning high. Large, meaning slightly larger than the pulses of other positions.
If it is excessively large and floating, there is disease. If it is floating yet not large, there is also disease. If it is large yet not floating, there is disease. If it is neither large nor floating, there is disease. If it does not correspond to its position, there is disease. If its position cannot manifest large and floating, there is also disease.

When Major Yang arrives, its pulse is short and rough—rough, meaning it does not flow smoothly. Short, meaning it does not travel far.
If it is excessively short, there is disease. If it is excessively rough, there is disease. If it is neither short nor rough, there is disease. If it does not correspond to its position, there is disease. If its position cannot manifest short and rough, there is also disease.

When Major Yang arrives, its pulse is large and long—long, meaning it travels far.
If it is excessively large, there is disease. If it is excessively long, there is disease. If it is long yet not large, there is disease. If it is large yet not long, there is disease. If it does not correspond to its position, there is disease. If its position cannot manifest large and long, there is also disease.

If it arrives and is harmonious, it is balanced. If it is not excessively large, it is a balanced pulse. If it is neither weak nor strong, this is called harmonious.

If it arrives and is excessive, there is disease. A taut pulse resembles a drawn bowstring, a slippery pulse resembles rolling pearls, a deep pulse clings to the bones, a floating pulse rises above the skin, a rough pulse halts and lingers, a short pulse is like millet, a large pulse is like a hatpin, and a long pulse is like a drawn thread—all these are signs of arrival and excessive severity.

If it arrives yet reverses, there is disease. When a taut pulse reverses to rough, when a large pulse reverses to fine, when a deep pulse reverses to floating, when a floating pulse reverses to deep, when a short and rough pulse reverses to long and slippery, when a soft and hollow pulse reverses to strong and solid, when a fine pulse reverses to large, these are all signs where the *Qi* deviates from its natural balance, and disease manifests accordingly.

If it arrives yet does not arrive, there is disease. If the position of the *Qi* has already arrived but the pulse does not respond, this is a sign of disease.

If it arrives before it should, there is disease. By observing the calendar and noting the seasons, one should anticipate the arrival of the Six *Qi*’s positions, as if marking the passage of years like north and south. If the pulse changes and responds prematurely, and the *Qi* sequence has not yet shifted while the pulse already alters, this is an arrival before its time, and thus there is disease.

If the yin and yang are exchanged, it is perilous. If the pulse does not correspond to Heaven’s natural order, and the *Qi* shows signs of crossing and disorder, losing its usual position, and the positions are exchanged—when a yin position shows a yang pulse, or a yang position shows a yin pulse—this is a sign of exchanged positions, and the *Qi* is in peril due to the confusion of the two."

The newly corrected text states:

According to the *Six Microcosmic Principles Great Treatise*, the Emperor asked: *"How can there be cases where the *Qi* arrives when it should, where it arrives when it should not, and where it arrives in excess?*" Ghī Bó replied: *"When it arrives as it should, it is harmonious. When it arrives but does not come fully, the incoming *Qi* is insufficient. When it arrives before its time, the incoming *Qi* is excessive."*

The Emperor asked: *"What of the cases where it arrives but does not come fully, or arrives before its time?"* Ghī Bó replied: *"If it corresponds, it is in accordance; if not, it is contrary. Contrariness gives rise to change, and change gives rise to disease."*

The Emperor asked: *"Please explain its correspondence."* Ghī Bó replied: *"Things manifest their correspondence, and *Qi* and pulse manifest their correspondence. What is meant by ‘pulse correspondence’ is this very pulse correspondence."*

The Emperor asked: *"The Six *Qi*’s roots and branches differ in origin—how so?"* Ghī Bó replied: *"Some *Qi* follow their roots, some follow both roots and branches, and some do not follow roots or branches at all."*

The Emperor said: *"I wish to hear this fully."* Ghī Bó replied: *"Minor Yang and Major Yin follow their roots; Minor Yin and Major Yang follow both roots and branches; Yang Ming and Jue Yin do not follow roots or branches but follow the center. Minor Yang’s root is Fire, and Major Yin’s root is Dampness—their beginning and end are the same, hence they follow their roots. Minor Yin’s root is Heat, its branch is Yin; Major Yang’s root is Cold, its branch is Yang—their beginning and end differ, hence they follow both roots and branches. Yang Ming’s center is Major Yin, and Jue Yin’s center is Minor Yang—their beginning, end, and center differ, hence they do not follow roots or branches but follow the center. Following roots, branches, or the center—all are for the purpose of transformation and generation. Thus, those that follow roots transform and generate from the roots; those that follow roots and branches have transformations from both; those that follow the center transform through the central *Qi*. Transformation refers to the elemental sovereign of *Qi*’s transformation. There are diseases treated by regulating the elemental sovereign’s *Qi* with cold or heat."*

The newly corrected text states:

According to the *Six Microcosmic Principles Great Treatise*, it says:
*"For Minor Yang above, treat with Fire *Qi*; its center reveals Jue Yin. For Yang Ming above, treat with Dryness *Qi*; its center reveals Major Yin. For Major Yang above, treat with Cold *Qi*; its center reveals Minor Yin. For Jue Yin above, treat with Wind *Qi*; its center reveals Minor Yang. For Minor Yin above, treat with Heat *Qi*; its center reveals Major Yang. For Major Yin above, treat with Dampness *Qi*; its center reveals Yang Ming. This is the root. Beneath the root is the center’s manifestation; beneath the manifestation is the *Qi*’s branch. Roots and branches differ, and the *Qi*’s correspondence manifests varied appearances. This is what is meant."*

The Emperor asked: *"If the pulse follows yet the disease is contrary, how should it be diagnosed?"* Ghī Bó replied: *"When the pulse arrives and follows, pressing it yields no resonance—this applies to all Yang pulses. For instance, if the disease is Heat yet the pulse is rapid and pressing it yields no movement, this is due to extreme Cold forcing Yang upward, not Heat."*

The Emperor asked: *"How about the contrary cases of the Yin pulses?"* Ghī Bó replied: *"When the pulse arrives and follows, pressing it yields a strong, resonant beat. If the symptoms indicate Cold yet pressing reveals a pulse that thunders violently beneath the hand, this is due to extreme Heat repelling Yin and generating disease—not Cold."*

Thus, the origins of a hundred diseases may arise from the root, from the branch, from the central *Qi*, or be obtained by taking the root, the branch, the central *Qi*, or both root and branch. There are cases obtained by contrary methods and cases obtained by following methods. Contrary methods are called *Fan Zuò* (反佐). Odd-even methods are called *Cóng Zuò* (从取). Treating Cold diseases with Cold and Heat diseases with Heat is contrary. Following means accordance; contrary means what appears contrary is actually correct. If, for example, extreme Cold forces Yang upward and one treats Heat with Heat, or extreme Heat repels Yin and one treats Cold with Cold—these are called contrary, yet externally they seem contrary while internally they are correct. This is contrary yet truly correct. If, however, extreme Cold forces Yang and one treats with Cold, or extreme Heat repels Yin and one treats with Heat—externally they seem correct, yet internally the *Qi* is contrary. Thus, though the method appears correct, it is contrary.

Hence it is said: *"Knowing roots and branches, applying them without hesitation; understanding contrary and following, acting correctly without question—this is what is meant."* Those who do not understand this are unworthy of speaking of diagnosis and will only confuse the Classics.

Thus, the *Great Overview* states: *"Rough practitioners, pleased with superficial knowledge, assume they understand: ‘Heat has not yet ceased, yet Cold disease begins anew.’ They confuse same-*Qi* with different forms, leading to misdiagnosis and disorder of the Classics."* *Xīxī* (嘻嘻) means delight.

The mind and intention at ease assume they have fully grasped the Dao. The application of the Six *Qi* by the crude and the skilled alike only achieves half the understanding.

The transformations of *Juéyīn* are deemed Cold by the crude, yet they are truly Warm. The transformations of *Tàiyáng* are deemed Hot by the crude, yet they are truly Cold. Here, the errors and reversals cause their learning, knowledge, and application to falter, leaving the skilled only half-versed.

Now, *Tàiyáng* and *Shàoyīn* each possess Cold transformations, yet when measuring their roots and branches in application, they invert. How so? *Tàiyáng*’s root is Cold, its manifestation is Heat; *Shàoyīn*’s root is Heat, its manifestation is Cold—thus their treatments follow likewise. *Juéyīn* and *Yángmíng* also invert in their central *Qi*: *Juéyīn*’s central *Qi* is Heat, *Yángmíng*’s is Dampness—these two *Qi* likewise invert, akin to *Tàiyáng* and *Shàoyīn*. Yet *Tàiyáng* and *Shàoyīn* have roots and branches, differing in application from the other *Qi*, hence it is said: *"Same *Qi*, different forms."*

For a single channel’s roots and branches, since Heat and Cold differ, one must first examine the manifestation, then seek the root. If one discusses *Qi* without exhausting its roots and branches, or diagnoses illness without distinguishing Yin and Yang, though the two *Qi* may share a name, their governance obstructs the proper timing of Cold and Warm, thus the mind confuses true principles, and treatment disrupts the Classics—hence the term *"crude practitioner"* is rightly applied.

The principles of roots and branches are essential yet vast, small yet grand, allowing one to speak of one to know the harm of a hundred diseases. To speak of roots and branches is easy yet must not be neglected; to observe roots and branches allows *Qi* to be harmonized. To clearly know victory and reversal is to set the standard for all people—thus the Dao of Heaven is complete.

Though Heaven and Earth’s transformations may be fully known, how much more so for diagnosing a single person? Yet some remain in darkness, grasping only the essentials of the Classics and holding fast to their foundational laws, yet still they degrade their path, failing to set the standard for all people—how could this be called great?

**Newly corrected text states:**
According to *"Discourse on Roots and Branches in Disease Transmission,"* there are cases where the disease lies in the manifestation and is sought there, where it lies in the root and is sought there, where it lies in the root yet is sought in the manifestation, and where it lies in the manifestation yet is sought in the root. Thus, treatment may succeed by taking the manifestation, by taking the root, by taking the inverse, or by taking the direct.

Hence, knowing inverse and direct, acting correctly without question—those who know roots and branches will succeed in every case; those who do not are reckless in their actions.

The principles of Yin and Yang, inverse and direct, roots and branches—small yet grand, speaking of one to know a hundred diseases; few yet many, shallow yet profound, allowing one to speak of one to know a hundred. To know the shallow and discern the deep, to observe the near and know the far—this is speaking of roots and branches, easy yet not to be neglected.

Treatment contrary to the principle is inverse; treatment in accordance is direct.

If disease arises first, then inversion follows, treat the root;
If inversion arises first, then disease follows, treat the root;
If Cold arises first, then illness develops, treat the root;
If Heat arises first, then illness develops, treat the root;
If Heat arises first, then abdominal fullness develops, treat the manifestation;
If illness arises first, then diarrhea follows, treat the root;
If diarrhea arises first, then another illness develops, treat the root.
Then adjust the *Qi* and treat the other diseases.

If illness arises first, then abdominal fullness develops, treat the manifestation;
If abdominal fullness arises first, then mental agitation follows, treat the root.

Humans have guest-*Qi* and native-*Qi*.
For minor or major dysfunction, treat the manifestation;
For major dysfunction, treat the root.

When illness erupts with excess, root-to-manifestation: first treat the root, then the manifestation;
When illness erupts with deficiency, manifestation-to-root: first treat the manifestation, then the root.

Examine and inquire thoroughly, then adjust with intention. When symptoms are mild, both examination and inquiry proceed together; when severe, inquiry proceeds alone.

If minor or major dysfunction arises first, then illness follows, treat the root.
This Classic’s discussion of roots and branches is particularly detailed.

The Emperor asked: *"How do the changes of victory and reversal manifest in terms of timing?"*
Gēbó replied: *"The victorious *Qi*, when it arrives, the illness is already present, and the patient is uneasy—then the reversing *Qi* begins to sprout. The unease of the reversing *Qi* appears soon after. The reversing *Qi*, when it arises, exhausts the victorious *Qi* and takes its place, becoming intense. The victorious *Qi* may be slight or severe. The reversing *Qi* may be little or much—victory and reversal in harmony yield harmony; victory and reversal in emptiness yield emptiness—this is Heaven’s constant law."*

The Emperor asked: *"Why do the actions of victory and reversal sometimes move contrary to their proper positions, or arrive late in the season? What is their cause?"*
Gēbó replied: *"The generation and transformation of *Qi* vary in decline and flourishing. The applications of Cold, Heat, Warm, and Freezing differ in their盛衰. These changes occur in the four cardinal directions. Thus, the movement of Yang begins with Warmth and peaks in Heat; the movement of Yin begins with Coolness and peaks in Cold. Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter each differ in their divisions. It is said that the proper *Qi* of Spring’s Warmth lies in the months of *Chén* and *Sì*; Summer’s Heat in *Wèi* and *Shēn*; Autumn’s Cold in *Xū* and *Hài*; Winter’s Cold in *Chǒu* and *Yín*.

Spring begins in mid-Spring, Summer in mid-Summer, Autumn in mid-Autumn, Winter in mid-Winter. Thus, in the month of *Chǒu*, Yin congeals into thick ice beneath the earth; in the month of *Wèi*, Yang blazes with lightning across the sky; in the month of *Xū*, frost clears and kills, hardening all things; in the month of *Chén*, wind stirs gently, and withered trees flourish anew."*

This then is the divergence of *Qi* from its proper divisions, manifest and unobstructed. Yet the *Qi* of Yin and Yang, in its generation, flourishing, contraction, and storage, aligns with the usual laws when examining its transformations and their manifestations in humanity. The four seasons each vary in their daily count, diverging from the norm. Following these variations, one arrives at the true standard.

Thus, the *Da Yao* says:
*"That which is the Warmth of Spring becomes the Heat of Summer;
that which is the Rage of Autumn becomes the Fury of Winter."*

Carefully observing the four cardinal divisions, all omens converge—its end is visible, its beginning known. This is what is meant.

Speaking of the *Qi* in its youth and vigor:
Yang’s youth is Warmth, its vigor is Heat;
Yin’s youth is Rage, its vigor is Fury.
All this refers to the differing *Qi* of youth and vigor, verifying the waxing and waning of their applications. But if one establishes waxing and waning within the four cardinal divisions, then the terminal and initial applications of Yin and Yang become entirely knowable.

The Emperor asked: *"Does this divergence have a fixed number?"*
Gebi replied: *"It varies by thirty degrees—*
*degree meaning day."*

*(New annotation: According to the *Liu Yuan Zheng Ji Da Lun*, it says: "Does this divergence have a fixed number?"—*
*each day thereafter varies by thirty degrees with remainder. This text’s mention of "thirty degrees" is an abbreviation.)*

The Emperor asked: *"How do the pulses correspond?"*
Gebi replied: *"When divergence aligns with the proper law, it departs with the times. The pulse also diverges, following the *Qi*’s response. When the days of divergence are complete, the response to the sovereign *Qi* arrives and then departs."*

The *Mai Yao* states:
*"Spring without depth, Summer without tension,
Winter without roughness, Autumn without frequency—
this is called the Four Obstructions.
The *Qi* of Heaven and Earth is closed, with nowhere to circulate."*

Excessive depth is called disease,
Excessive tension is called disease,
Excessive roughness is called disease,
Excessive frequency is called disease.
But if it corresponds to the harmonious *Qi* of Heaven,
then this is called balanced.

When the form appears excessively so,
it is called *forceful attainment*—
how could such force endure long?
Thus, all excess is disease.

If it appears again on the same day, it is disease;
If it departs before its time, it is disease;
If it lingers after it should have departed, it is disease.
*Param* refers to the convergence of harmonizing *Qi*;
*Fu xian* refers to the reappearance of already decayed or dead *Qi*.
*Qu* refers to the sovereign *Qi* having departed.
If the daily degree has not yet exceeded the divergence,
this is called the Heavenly *Qi* not yet having emerged.
If the daily degree surpasses the divergence,
this is called the Heavenly *Qi* already having departed,
yet the pulse remains—
since it is not in proper response, it is called disease.
This is called *fan*—rebellion.
Summer shows slackness, Autumn shows frequency,
Winter shows slackness, Spring shows roughness—
this is called *fan*, violating Heaven’s command.
How could life endure?

*(New annotation: Referring to the earlier text, "Autumn without frequency is called the Four Obstructions," yet this note says "Autumn shows frequency is called *fan*," meaning the pulse’s divergence occurs only in the central month, and though the degree of divergence is complete, the frequency does not depart—thus, in the late month of Autumn, if the pulse remains frequent, it is called *fan*.)*

Thus, it is said:
*"The *Qi*’s mutual governance is like the scales of a balance,
which must not be unequal.*
Scales refer to a steelyard.
The *Qi* of Heaven and Earth—cold and heat opposing,
warmth and coolness alternating—
is like holding a balance.
If one side is heavy or the other is light,
when the two are equal and unopposed,
then clarity and tranquility generate transformations,
each attaining its proper measure."*

When the *Qi* of Yin and Yang is clear and tranquil,
generation and transformation are orderly;
when it moves, harsh diseases arise—
this is what is meant.
*Dòng* refers to deviations from the usual balanced state,
giving rise to calamities.
*Pó* means excessive.

*(New annotation: According to the *Liu Wei Zhi Da Lun*:
*"Success and failure, rise and fall, arise from movement.
Movement that does not cease becomes transformation."*

The Emperor asked: *"How do the obscure and the luminous manifest?"*
Gebi replied:
*"When the two Yins converge fully, it is called obscure;
when the two Yangs unite in brightness, it is called luminous.
The pairing of obscure and luminous corresponds to the differences in cold and heat.
The two Yins converge fully in *Xū* and *Hài*,
the two Yangs unite in brightness in *Chén* and *Sì*.
The *Ling Shu Xi Ri Yue Lun* states:
*Hài* is the tenth month, the left foot’s *Jué Yin*;
*Xū* is the ninth month, the right foot’s *Jué Yin*.
This is where the two Yins converge fully, hence called *Jué Yin*.
*Chén* is the third month, the left foot’s *Yáng Míng*;
*Sì* is the fourth month, the right foot’s *Yáng Míng*.
This is where the two Yangs unite in front, hence called *Yáng Míng*.
Yet when Yin converges, it is obscure;
when Yang unites, it is luminous—
the symbols of obscure and luminous must follow this.
Cold and heat occupy the southwest and northeast,
obscure and luminous occupy the northwest and southeast.
The pairing of obscure and luminous,
the positions of cold and heat—
truly, these are distinct."*

*(New annotation: According to the *Tai Shi Tian Yuan Ce Wen*:
*"Obscure and luminous having positioned,
cold and heat relax and expand."*

The Emperor asked: *"How do the solstices and equinoxes manifest?"*
Gebi replied:
*"When *Qi* arrives, it is called *zhi*;
when *Qi* divides, it is called *fen*.
At *zhi*, the *Qi* aligns;
at *fen*, the *Qi* diverges—
this is called the proper sequence of Heaven and Earth.
Following the inquiry into obscure and luminous,
this meaning takes form.
Speaking of the winter and summer solstices,
these are the Heavenly and Earthly *Qi* dominating the year at their positions.
The spring and autumn equinoxes
are the initial *Qi* of the four seasons,
each dividing its governance to the left and right of the dominant year.
Thus, at the solstices, the *Qi* aligns;
at the equinoxes, the *Qi* diverges.
What is spoken of as the correspondence of the two solstices and two equinoxes—
this is called the proper sequence of Heaven and Earth’s *Qi*."*

The Emperor said:
*"Master, you have spoken of Spring and Autumn *Qi* beginning in advance,
and Winter and Summer *Qi* beginning later—I understand this.
Yet the Six *Qi* circulate, and their dominance over the year is not constant.
How should their supplementary records be written?
By clarifying the divisions of solstices and equinoxes,
the initial *Qi* of the four seasons begins fifteen days before the *Lì Chūn* and *Lì Qiú*,
and the three *Qi* and six *Qi* begin fifteen days after the *Lì Xià* and *Lì Dōng*,
as the established method."*

The four seasons’ forward and backward sequence thus reveals that within the three *Qi* and six *Qi*, the proper alignment occurs at the solstices. Hence it is said that Spring and Autumn *Qi* begin in advance, while Winter and Summer *Qi* begin later. Yet since the year contains 365 days, each *Qi* shifts anew annually. When new *Qi* arrives, the old departs, and the appropriate times for action differ greatly above and below. Thus, the method of supplementary records must account for their sequence, which is why the question was raised again.

Gebi said:
*"The governing principles above and below follow what is advantageous, and aligning their flavors is the key. The same method applies to both sides."*

*The Great Overview* states:
*"The lesser yang’s governance: first sweet, then salty;
The yangming’s governance: first pungent, then sour;
The greater yang’s governance: first salty, then bitter;
The jueyin’s governance: first sour, then pungent;
The shaoyin’s governance: first sweet, then salty;
The taiyin’s governance: first bitter, then sweet.
Assist with what is beneficial, and supplement with what is generated—this is called attaining the *Qi*.
*Governance* refers to the dominant year.
*Attaining* means realizing its nature and function.
When one attains its nature and function, expansion and contraction follow human intent; failing to do so, movements generate discord, and how can one then hope to drive away evil? It is merely sufficient to exhaust the subtle *Qi* of Heavenly Truth.
Thus, the sequence of flavors—first writing off what is diseased, then supplementing—is as described."*

The Emperor said:
*"Excellent. The hundred diseases arise from wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and fire, transforming and varying through them. Wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and fire are the six *Qi* of Heaven. When still and harmonious, they are called transformations; when agitated and varying, they are called variations. Hence it is said that they transform and vary.
The classics state: ‘Excess is written off; deficiency is supplemented.’ I have entrusted this to physicians, yet even they cannot achieve full success. I wish to ensure that essential methods are practiced correctly, with techniques and prescriptions in perfect accord—like removing thorns and cleansing snow—so that skill, artistry, and sanctity may be attained. Needlework is skillful; medicine is sanctified."*

*The New Annotation* states:
*"According to the *Difficult Classic*: ‘To know by observation is called divine; to know by inquiry is called sage; to know by questioning is called skillful; to know by pulse-taking is called artful. To know externally is called sage; to know internally is called divine.’"*

Gebi said:
*"Carefully examine the mechanisms of disease, never missing the appropriate *Qi*—this is what is meant.
Mastering the essential principles means that small actions yield great results, and shallow methods achieve deep effects."*

The Emperor said:
*"I wish to hear how disease mechanisms operate."*

Gebi said:
*"All dizziness and vertigo from wind belong to the liver; wind’s nature is movement, aligning with wood *Qi*.
All contractions and spasms from cold belong to the kidneys; *shōu* means constriction, *yǐn* means urgency. Cold substances contract, aligning with water *Qi*.
All stagnant *Qi* and oppression belong to the lungs; in late autumn, frost descends, and damp *Qi* gathers. When frost arrives, *Qi* grows hot, and excessive heat transforms into *chán*—examining these phenomena reveals their correspondence.
*Jì* means facial distension; *yù* means pressing urgency. *Qi*’s function aligns with metal *Qi*.
All dampness, swelling, and fullness belong to the spleen; thin soil yields shallow water, thick soil yields deep water, level soil is dry, and high soil is damp. Where dampness exists, earth *Qi* aligns.
All heat and *dé* belong to fire; fire’s symbol is evident.
All pain, itching, and sores belong to the heart; when the heart is tranquil, pain is slight; when agitated, pain is severe. A hundred disturbances arise from the heart, and pain, itching, and sores originate there.
All *jué* (inversions), constipation, and diarrhea belong to the lower [orifices]; *lower* refers to the lower burner’s liver and kidney *Qi*.
The kidneys govern the lower burner; the liver governs the gateways and passages. Thus, all *jué*, constipation, and diarrhea belong to the lower burner.
*Jué* means inverted *Qi*; *gù* means inhibited. When *Qi* surges upward or inhibition fails, with unrestrained inflow and outflow, and dryness and dampness fluctuating—all stem from the lower burner’s governance.
All weakness, dyspnea, and vomiting belong to the upper [orifices]; *upper* refers to the upper burner’s heart and lung *Qi*.
Scorching heat is the heart’s *Qi*; receiving heat and transforming it is the lung’s *Qi*. When heat stagnates and ascends, disease belongs to the upper burner."*

*The New Annotation* states:
*"Examining *wěi* (weakness) as a disease, it seems not an upper disorder. Wang’s commentary fails to explain why it belongs to the upper burner, causing later doubt. Now, according to the *Treatise on Weakness*, the five *zàng* cause weakness when lung heat scorches the leaves, manifesting as *wěi-bì*. Hence, it is said to belong to the upper burner. *Wěi* also refers to lung weakness."*

*"All trembling and terror, as if losing one’s spirit, belong to fire; internal heat’s manifestation.
All stiffness and neck rigidity belong to dampness; excessive dampness in the greater yang.
All upward surging inversions belong to fire; fire’s ascending nature.
All abdominal distension and enlargement belong to heat; internal heat stagnation generates lung distension.
All agitation, madness, and recklessness belong to fire; excessive heat in the stomach and the four limbs.
All sudden stiffness belong to wind; internal yang stagnation while external yin circulates.
All diseases with sound—when struck like a drum—belong to heat; meaning they produce sound.
All diseases with *bì* (hardness) and swelling, along with pain, sourness, and fright, belong to fire; excessive heat *Qi*.
All twisting and inversion, with turbid fluids, belong to heat; *fan-lì* means tendon contraction. *Fluids* refers to urine.
All diseases with clear, cold fluids belong to cold; whether excreted above, below, or vomited and urinated out.
All sour vomiting and sudden downward pressure belong to heat. *Sour* refers to sour fluids and *mèi* (phlegm)."

Thus the *Great Overview* states:

*"Diligently guard the disease mechanisms—each belongs to its own category. If present, seek it; if absent, seek it. If excessive, reduce it; if deficient, supplement it. One must first apply the Five Conquests, harmonizing the blood and qi, ensuring their smooth circulation, and attaining equilibrium—this is the principle.*

The wisdom of the Sage is profound, and this reasoning is correct. To seek what is present or absent, to reduce excess or supplement deficiency—this is to exhaust all possibilities.

When extreme cold prevails yet heat does not respond, this indicates *no fire*. When heat arises and then retreats, appearing by day and hiding by night, or emerging at night and ceasing by day, moving with the seasons—this too indicates *no fire*. In such cases, one must *assist the heart*.

When fire-heat is extreme yet cold does not take effect, this indicates *no water*. When heat surges and then subsides, appearing and vanishing abruptly, moving and stopping at irregular times—this too indicates *no water*, and one must *assist the kidney*.

When internal obstruction causes retching and vomiting, preventing food from entering, this indicates *fire*. When illness causes vomiting and food is expelled upon ingestion, this indicates *no fire*. When sudden, rapid diarrhea occurs before food can be digested, this indicates *no water*. When prolonged diarrhea persists without urgency, this indicates *no water*.

Thus, when the heart is excessive, heat is generated; when the kidney is excessive, cold is generated. When the kidney is deficient, cold stirs within; when the heart is deficient, heat is drawn inward. If heat cannot be countered by cold, this indicates *no fire*. If cold cannot be countered by heat, this indicates *no water*.

When cold does not take effect, it is because *water is absent*. When heat does not take effect, it is because *fire is absent*. When heat does not persist, it is because the heart is deficient. When cold does not persist, it is because the kidney is insufficient.

If present, drain it; if absent, supplement it. If deficient, supplement it; if excessive, drain it. Balance the extremes—unblock stagnation, ensure unimpeded circulation above and below, and harmonize the qi and blood. Then cold and heat will naturally balance, and yin and yang will be in harmony.

Thus, some prescriptions treat heat with cold, yet cold causes food refusal; others attack cold with heat, yet heat induces delirium. This arises when qi is not freely circulating—when stagnation prevails.

By observing water and fire, the remaining qi may be understood. Therefore, the saying: *"If present, seek it; if absent, seek it. If excessive, reduce it; if deficient, supplement it."* This is the subtle method to harmonize the qi.

The Five Conquests refer to the cyclical dominance of the Five Phases, applying cold, heat, warmth, chill, and dampness, as well as sour, salty, sweet, bitter, and pungent to overcome them according to their laws.

The Emperor asked: *"How do the five flavors function in terms of yin and yang?"*

Gebi replied: *"Pungent and sweet disperse and ascend as yang; sour and bitter descend and drain as yin; salty also descends and drains as yin; bland permeates and drains as yang. These six—whether contracting, dispersing, moderating, hastening, drying, or moistening, softening, or firming—should be applied according to their benefits to regulate the qi and achieve balance."*

*"Descend" refers to vomiting; "drain" refers to diarrhea. "Permeate and drain" refers to urination—meaning water and fluids descend from the small intestine, separate as essence, seep into the bladder, and are transformed by the bladder’s qi before being excreted as urine.*

*(New annotation: According to the *Theory of Stored Qi and Seasonal Laws*, it states: "Pungent disperses, sour contracts, sweet moderates, bitter firms, and salty transforms." It further states: "Pungent, sour, sweet, bitter, and salty each have their uses—some disperse, some contract, some moderate, some hasten, some firm, some soften. The four seasons and five viscera require treatment according to the appropriate flavor."*

The Emperor asked: *"If the disease does not arise from disharmonized qi, how should it be treated? How do we determine whether to use toxic or non-toxic remedies, and in what order?"*

Gebi replied: *"The nature of diseases has four categories:
1. Those arising from internal formation due to disturbed qi—such as accumulations, masses, nodules, itching, contractions, and chronic pain.
2. Those arising from external formation due to disturbed qi—such as flaccid swelling, sores, scabs, scabies, boils, hemorrhoids, dropsy, floating edema, red eyes, blurred vision, hardness, swelling, and pain.
3. Those arising internally without disturbed qi—such as retained fluids, phlegm, improper diet, hunger, overwork, indigestion, cholera, grief, fear, joy, anger, brooding, and melancholy.
4. Those arising externally without disturbed qi—such as miasmic vapors, malevolent spirits, insects, snakes, witchcraft, ghosts striking, collisions, falls, wind, cold, heat, dampness, cuts, stabs, slashes, beatings, or blows."*

*"Among these four categories, some are cured by treating only the internal, some by treating both internal and external, some by treating only the external, some by treating both. Some require treating the internal first, then the external; others require treating the external first, then the internal. Some demand aggressive toxic methods, while others require gentle, non-toxic adjustment. The methods vary—sometimes heavy, sometimes light; sometimes gradual, sometimes urgent; sometimes contracting, sometimes dispersing; sometimes moistening, sometimes drying; sometimes softening, sometimes firming. Practitioners’ interpretations differ, each favoring their own methods and often misusing remedies without foundation. Hence, I am asked again."*

Gebi replied: *"Whether a remedy is toxic or non-toxic depends on the treatment’s necessity, adjusted by the severity and scale of the disease. A good prescription is one that swiftly resolves stagnation, urgently rescues critical illness, and prevents death. It is not about prioritizing toxicity—whether toxic or non-toxic, the choice depends on the disease’s urgency and scale."*

The Emperor asked: *"Please specify the criteria."*

Gebi replied: *"A small prescription uses one sovereign and two ministers; a medium prescription uses one sovereign, three ministers, and five assistants; a large prescription uses one sovereign, three ministers, and nine assistants."*

The cold is treated with warmth, the hot with cold;
The mild is countered, the severe is followed.
Even the smallest disease, like a great fire,
Encounters grass and is extinguished,
Meets wood and is overturned—
It can be suppressed by dampness,
Or quenched by water.
Thus, its nature and *qi* are countered to subdue and attack it.

The most severe disease, like a dragon’s fire,
Encounters dampness and flames rise,
Meets water and is overturned—
If one does not recognize its nature and attempts to suppress it with water or dampness,
It will only grow brighter, reaching the heavens before exhaustion halts it.
But if one knows its nature,
And acts contrary to its usual course,
Using fire to drive it out,
Then it will self-destruct, its flames extinguished.

Yet "countering" means attacking heat with cold and cold with heat.
"Following" means attacking with cold or heat,
Though following its nature, the methods are not all the same.

Thus, it is said:
*Countering* is *zhèng* treatment,
*Following* is *fǎn* treatment—
Following in small or great measure,
Observing the circumstances.

This is what is meant.

---
The *Shénnóng* says:
Medicines have sovereigns, ministers, assistants, and guides,
To mutually promote and regulate.
When combined, one sovereign, two ministers, three assistants, and five guides are used;
Or one sovereign, two ministers, and nine assistants and guides.

The firm is regulated,
The exogenous is removed,
The exhausted is warmed,
The stagnant is dispersed,
The lingering is attacked,
The dry is moistened,
The urgent is calmed,
The scattered is consolidated,
The deficient is supplemented,
The idle is invigorated,
The startled is pacified,
The upper and lower are harmonized,
Rubbed and bathed,
Thinned and purged,
Opened and released—
All adapted to the circumstances.
Measure the disease and its signs,
And apply accordingly.

The Emperor asked: *"What is meant by countering and following?"*

Gebi replied: *"Countering is zhèng treatment,
Following is fǎn treatment—
Following in small or great measure,
Observing the circumstances."*

He said:
*Countering* is *zhèng* treatment—
Attacking cold with heat and heat with cold.
Though following the disease’s *qi*,
It is still *fǎn* treatment.

*Following in small measure* means one similarity and two differences;
*Following in great measure* means two similarities and three differences.
What is not the same is called *zhì* (regulation).

The Emperor asked: *"What is fǎn treatment?"*

Gebi replied:
*"Heat arises from cold suppression—treat with cold;
Cold arises from heat suppression—treat with heat;
Stagnation arises from stagnation—treat with stagnation;
Obstruction arises from obstruction—treat with obstruction.
Necessarily suppress its root,
And first address its cause—
Though the beginning may be the same,
The end will differ.
It can break accumulations,
Dissolve hardness,
Harmonize the *qi*,
And ensure recovery.

When great cold congeals internally,
Forming scrotal masses and hernias,
Attacking with heat removes cold obstruction and heat stagnation,
But excessive heat causes severe pain.
Using honey-cooked *Aconitum* with warm honey,
Increasing the dose,
After ingestion, it dissipates naturally.
This is Zhang Gong’s method of treating cold with heat.

When fire *qi* surges,
And *Lingzhi* mushrooms are overused,
Heat is suppressed by cold,
Causing vomiting, retching, hoarseness, dry mouth, bitterness,
Aversion to heat and preference for cold—
All agree it is heat,
But treating it as such worsens the condition.
If one opposes their preference, resistance arises;
If one complies with their desire, the disease worsens.
Adjusting cold and heat inversely,
Heat dissipates as cold spreads,
Then hot substances are taken—
After vomiting and hoarseness subside,
The body’s heat emerges,
The disease *qi* gradually recedes,
And retching ceases.
This brings no harm,
And great benefit follows—
Pure wine is consumed,
And the pattern is clear.
This is treating heat with cold.

Those who dislike heat—
All residual *qi* from food that causes life—
Seeing it induces vomiting.
Again, in heat diseases,
Cold attacks fail to penetrate,
For they fear cold’s dominance,
And heat dissipates.
Following its *qi* increases heat,
But cold attacks prevent penetration.
Using fermented soybeans or other cold medicines in warm wine,
Warm wine and cold medicine share no conflict—
Once the wine’s heat is exhausted,
The cold medicine takes effect,
Following ingestion, heat disperses—
This is treating cold with heat.

Or using cold substances,
Harmonized with heat,
Taken as food or medicine,
Heat dissolves and disperses—
This too is treating cold with heat.
Again, consuming hot meats and *mallow* milk,
With pepper, ginger, and tangerine harmonized in heat,
Follows the same principle.

When heat is in the lower burner,
Treatment follows similarly.
For instance, if lower *qi* is deficient,
And the middle burner is congested,
With severe flank distension,
Worsening after meals—
Unskilled practitioners cannot decide:
Dispersing the fullness risks depleting the lower burner,
Supplementing the lower burner worsens middle congestion,
Dispersing *qi* further weakens the lower burner,
Supplementing deficiency exacerbates middle fullness.
Consulting physicians agree:
Without addressing the deficiency,
They attack the fullness—
Medicine enters, causing retching,
But after passing, the condition remains unchanged.
Thus, middle fullness and lower deficiency persist.

Only by gently opening the middle,
And forcefully supplementing the lower,
With small doses aiding congestion,
And large doses promoting flow,
Can the disease be cured—
Middle fullness is removed,
Lower deficiency is resolved.
This is treating stagnation with stagnation.

Again, when great internal heat congeals,
Causing unremitting diarrhea,
Heat should be treated with cold,
But once the stagnation is resolved,
Cold is used to purge—
Stagnation disperses, and diarrhea stops.
This is treating obstruction with obstruction.

Or when great internal heat congeals,
Causing prolonged diarrhea,
Healing only to recur,
Dragging on for years—
Treating with heat stops the cold and halts diarrhea.
This is of the same kind.

Using cold to treat heat,
Cooling as it acts,
Using heat to treat cold,
Warming as it acts—
Though the beginning is the same,
The end differs.
This is what is meant."

「All such cases—
Their disciples merely outline the general signs,
Yet still adhere to the principle of *counter-treatment* [反治].
This is of the same kind.

*The newly corrected text* states:
According to the *Five Constants Governing the Great* [五常政大论]:
To treat heat with cold, let it act with warmth [温而行之],
To treat cold with heat, let it act with coolness [凉而行之].
This is the meaning of treating heat with coldness and cold with heat [热因寒用，寒因热用].

The Emperor said: *Well done.*

For cases where *qi* is regulated and attained—
How should they be treated?

Gui Bo [岐伯] replied:
*Counter* [逆] and *assist* [从],
*Counter* while *assisting*, *assist* while *countering*—
To disperse the *qi* and restore harmony,
This is the Dao [道].

*Counter* means to oppose the disease-*qi* with proper treatment [逆病气以正治].
*Assist* means to follow the disease-*qi* with counter-treatment [从病气而反疗].
Opposing the *qi* to properly treat,
Letting it follow its natural course,
Following the disease to counter its nature,
Letting it attain balance—
Thus, it is called *counter* and *assist* [逆从].

If the *qi* is not dispersed to open its pathways,
It will be affected by cold and heat, leading to manifold changes—
At first, transformations arise in abundance [始生化多端].

The Emperor said: *Well done.*
For diseases affecting the *inner* and *outer* [中外]—
How should they be treated?»

**Qibo replied:**

When disease spreads *from the inner to the outer*,
adjust the inner;
When disease spreads *from the outer to the inner*,
treat the outer;
Each must sever its source.
If disease spreads *from the inner to the outer* and flourishes externally,
first adjust the inner, then treat the outer;
If disease spreads *from the outer to the inner* and flourishes internally,
first treat the outer, then adjust the inner.
All this means: first remove its root cause,
then trim its branches.

When inner and outer diseases do not interact,
treat the primary ailment.
When inner and outer diseases do not interact,
they are separate afflictions.

**The Emperor said:** *Well done.*

*Fire-heat* recurs, aversion to cold with fever,
resembling malaria—
sometimes erupting daily, sometimes every few days—
what is its cause?

**Qibo replied:**
The *victorious countering-qi* [胜复之气] meets at varying intervals,
depending on its abundance or scarcity.
When *yin-qi* predominates and *yang-qi* is weak,
the onset is spaced farther apart;
When *yang-qi* predominates and *yin-qi* is weak,
the onset is closer together.
This is the interplay of *victorious countering-qi*,
the rhythm of waxing and waning—
malaria follows the same principle.

When *yin* and *yang* are balanced,
chills and fevers alternate within a single day.
When *yang* is excessive and *yin* deficient,
fever appears daily without chill.
When *yang* is deficient and *yin* excessive,
fever erupts every other day—
first chill, then heat.

Even with *victorious countering-qi*,
if the *qi* is weak, a single attack may recur after six or seven days—
folks mistakenly call this recovery, only for it to flare again.
Or it may recur every third day, then cease for six or seven,
or erupt every tenth day, then stop after four or five—
all due to the *qi*'s varying strength,
whether it converges or does not converge.

Common folk, seeing no immediate change,
blame malevolent spirits or sudden afflictions,
and for long they pray, flee, or hide—
yet by the time the disease has run its course,
death follows swiftly.
The deceased, wronged in life, now haunt broad roads,
while untimely deaths fill the wilderness.
How tragic—
how could this not bring sorrow?
Customs, once entrenched, resist sudden reform.
No longer can they be altered—
what else can be done?
Alas, alas!

**The Emperor said:**
The theory states: *"Treat cold with heat, treat heat with cold,"*
yet practitioners abandon these principles
and deviate from the Dao.

There are patients with heat—
cool them, and heat persists;
Patients with cold—
warm them, and cold remains.
Both conditions coexist,
new diseases arise—
how should they be treated?
For the treatment fails to subdue the disease,
and instead, the medicine’s cold or heat
gives rise to fresh cold or heat afflictions.

Some cases remit only to relapse,
others worsen while the medicine lingers,
some never abate at all.
If practitioners abandon these principles,
there is no method to renew their approach.
If they follow superficial patterns,
the disease remains unchecked.
If they grasp at symptoms,
they obstruct the true nature of the ailment;
if they treat superficially,
the medicine proves ineffective.
Confused in mind, bewildered in intent,
they find no path to enlightenment.
Unknowing of the Dao,
what reliance can they have?
Diseases arise from the medicine itself—
old and new ailments clash.
How can one hope for recovery?

**Qibo replied:**
For those who grow hot when treated with cold,
draw from *yin*;
For those who grow cold when treated with heat,
draw from *yang*—
this is called *"seeking their affinity."*

It means:
Nurturing *fire*'s source to disperse *yin* obstructions;
Strengthening *water*'s master to restrain *yang* excess—
hence, *"seeking their affinity."*

Crude practitioners, shallow in learning,
attack cold with heat, cold with cold;
Before heat is fully treated, new diseases emerge;
Before cold is fully attacked, heat resurges.
Heat arises while internal cold remains,
cold generates while external heat persists.
To attack cold, they fear heat will not yield;
to treat heat, they dread cold will return.
Advance and retreat clash in battle—
danger is imminent.
How could they know the *zang-fu* sources
hold the keys to cold, heat, warmth, and freezing?

To treat the *heart*, one does not simply apply heat;
to treat the *kidney*, one does not simply apply cold.
But by reinforcing the *heart*'s *yang*,
even cold will disperse;
by fortifying the *kidney*'s *yin*,
heat may yet be contained.
Observe this truth:
Sometimes heat is treated with heat,
cold with cold—
a thousand applications, a thousand cures.
Who understands their intent?
Though their prescriptions are profound,
their reasoning is exhausted.
Alas!
Is death by fate,
or by the practitioner’s ignorance and folly?

**The Emperor said:** *Well done.*

When cold remedies cause heat to return,
or heat remedies cause cold to return—
what is the cause?

**Qibo replied:**
It is due to treating the *sovereign-qi* [王气] excessively,
thus provoking the reaction.

All things have cold or heat,
*qi* has *yin* or *yang*.
When it clashes with the *sovereign-qi*,
it intensifies its nature.

The *liver-qi* is temperate,
the *heart-qi* is scorching,
the *lung-qi* is cool,
the *kidney-qi* is piercing cold,
the *spleen-qi* encompasses all four.
Thus, in spring, treating the *liver* with cold
yet causing warmth to return;
in summer, treating the *heart* with cold
yet causing heat to return;
in autumn, treating the *lung* with warmth
yet causing coolness to return;
in winter, treating the *kidney* with heat
yet causing cold to return—
this is because the *sovereign-qi* was over-supplemented.
When the *sovereign-qi* is over-supplemented,
the *zang*'s inherent cold or heat will naturally intensify.

**The Emperor said:**
What if this occurs without treating the *sovereign-qi*?

**Qibo replied:**
Your question is thorough.
It is due to neglecting the *five flavors*' affinities.

The *five flavors* enter the stomach,
each attacking what it favors:
Sour first enters the *liver*,
bitter first enters the *heart*,
sweet first enters the *spleen*,
pungent first enters the *lung*,
salty first enters the *kidney*.
*(Note: The *Zangfu* affinities are:
Sour enters the *liver*,
pungent enters the *lung*,
bitter enters the *heart*,
salty enters the *kidney*,
sweet enters the *spleen*.)*
This is called *"the five entries."*

With time, they augment the *qi*—
a natural transformation of things.
When *qi* is prolonged, it leads to untimely death.
For what enters the *liver* becomes warmth,
what enters the *heart* becomes heat,
what enters the *lung* becomes cool,
what enters the *kidney* becomes cold,
what enters the *spleen* becomes *ultimate yin*,
encompassing all four *qi*—
each enhances its flavor and strengthens its *qi*,
thus following the inherent nature of its respective *zang*.

Thus, prolonged consumption of *Huánglián* (Coptis) and *Kǔcān* (Sophora) leads to heat—
this is their inherent nature.
All flavors behave likewise.
Yet, human perception is often lax and careless,
unable to discern their subtle transformations with precision.
Hence it is said:
*"With time, they augment the qi—
a natural transformation of things.*
When *qi* grows ever stronger without restraint,
it prolongs life but also leads to the imbalance of the *zang*’s inherent *qi*.
If *qi* becomes imbalanced, it may then be cut off in excess,
and if the *zang* is thus overstrained, sudden death may follow.
Therefore it is said:
*'When qi is prolonged, it leads to untimely death.'*

Hence, the *Zhènglǐ Guānhuà Yàojí* (Collection of Proper Principles for Aligning and Transforming Medicines) states:
*"If medicines lack all five flavors and do not encompass the four qi,
yet are taken for prolonged use,
though they may initially yield benefits,
over time, they will cause sudden death.*
This is what is meant.

If one abstains from grains and only takes medicines,
sudden demise will not occur—
why is this so?
Because there is no flavor of the five grains to aid in their augmentation.
Yet if grains are reintroduced,
death will still come.
The Emperor said: *Good.*

Now, regarding the categorization of sovereign and ministerial herbs—
what does this mean?
Gūibó (Master Gui) replied:
*"The sovereign is the herb that treats the primary disease,
the minister aids the sovereign,
and the assistant harmonizes the ministerial action.
This does not refer to the upper, middle, and lower three grades.
The upper herbs are sovereigns,
the middle herbs are ministers,
the lower herbs are assistants—
this distinction clarifies their varying efficacy and nature.
The method of taking medicines should follow this principle,
and the same applies universally in treating diseases.
The sovereign herb is chosen to address the primary disease,
the ministerial herbs assist the sovereign,
and the assistant herbs fulfill the ministerial function—
all are employed to enhance the therapeutic effect."*

The Emperor asked:
*"What are the three grades?"*
Gūibó replied:
*"They serve to differentiate the medicinal virtues of good and evil.
The three grades—upper, middle, and lower—
are thus named to reflect the distinct Daoist natures and functions of medicines.
*(Note: According to Shénnóng [Divine Farmer], upper herbs are sovereigns, nourishing life to align with Heaven;
middle herbs are ministers, nourishing vitality to align with humanity;
lower herbs are assistants, treating diseases to align with Earth.)*
The Emperor said: *Good.*

Now, regarding diseases of the inner and outer—
how should they be addressed?
*(This question revisits the inner and outer distinctions,
further elaborating on the method of regulating qi,
as the previous inquiry was incomplete.)
The following response should follow the earlier discussion on discerning their attributes.
This is likely an ancient instance of displaced text.*

Gūibó replied:
*"In regulating qi,
one must distinguish yin and yang,
determine whether the disease is of the inner or outer,
and each treatment must adhere to its proper realm.
Diseases of the inner are treated internally,
diseases of the outer are treated externally.
If the imbalance is slight, regulate it;
if it persists, balance it;
if it is severe, suppress it;
if it is extreme, induce sweating to resolve it.
For excesses of cold and heat, temper and chill,
weakening them according to their affinities.
Follow what is advantageous—
diseases have inner and outer distinctions,
treatments have external and internal applications.
Inner diseases are harmonized with internal treatment;
outer diseases are harmonized with external treatment.
If the qi is weak and unbalanced,
use methods to regulate it#67;
if the imbalance is moderate,
use methods to balance it;
if the imbalance is severe and unyielding,
suppress its excess to let it decline.
For instance, if there is a slight excess of cold *qi*,
use warmth to harmonize it;
if there is a great excess of cold *qi*,
use heat to resolve it;
if there is extreme cold *qi*,
then induce downward elimination to suppress it—
if suppression does not suffice,
reverse and bend it;
if bending does not exhaust it,
then seek its affinity to weaken it.

If there is a slight excess of heat *qi*,
use coolness to harmonize it;
if there is a great excess of heat *qi*,
use cold to resolve it;
if there is extreme heat *qi*,
then induce sweating to disperse it—
if dispersion does not suffice,
reverse and restrain it;
if restraint does not suffice,
then seek its affinity to weaken it.

Hence it is said:
*'Induce sweating to resolve it,
use cold and heat, temper and chill—
weakening them according to their affinities,
following what is advantageous.'*
*Sho*, meaning *that which belongs to*.
Adhering meticulously to these principles,
all actions will be successful.
When *qi* and blood are balanced,
longevity is in accordance with Heaven’s decree.

By observing the Dao and acting accordingly,
all endeavors will be precise—
thus one can command herbs and minerals,
summon spirits and deities,
regulate yin and yang,
ward off all ailments,
and preserve *qi* and blood in harmony,
ensuring vitality without depletion or exhaustion.
For when one can freely extend or withdraw,
leave or retain as one wills,
the spirit is inwardly protected,
and life is prolonged with divine vigor.

The Emperor said: *Good.*

**Newly Translated Text:**

The *Zhuò Zhì Jiào Lùn* (至教论, "Treatise on Supreme Teaching")—newly collated—states: *"According to the Gùběn of Quán Yuánqǐ, this appears in the beginning and end of the Sìshí Bìnglèi Lùn (四时病类论, 'Classification of Seasonal Diseases')."*

The Yellow Emperor sat in the **Míngtáng** (明堂, "Hall of Enlightenment"), summoning Léi Gōng and asking him: *"Do you understand the Dao of medicine?"*
The **Míngtáng**, an office of governance, has eight windows and four gates, its form round above and square below, located in the southern part of the state—thus it is called the **Míngtáng**.
To seek out the people’s afflictions and relieve their hidden suffering was the great sage’s concern, hence the summoning of Léi Gōng to inquire about the means of saving lives.

Léi Gōng replied: *"I can recite, yet barely comprehend; comprehend, yet cannot distinguish; distinguish, yet cannot illuminate; illuminate, yet cannot make manifest.*
This speaks to what I know and understand—only grasping the laws and numbers of the method, yet still unable to penetrate the profound and subtle mysteries of its application."*

**New collation notes:** *"According to Yáng Shàngshàn, practicing the Dao has five stages: recitation, comprehension, distinction, illumination, and manifestation. This suffices to govern officials, yet is insufficient to reach the level of a feudal lord."*

Léi Gōng did not dare exalt his own teachings, yet the difference between a commoner and a noble in healing is vast. He wished to receive the **shù tiān zhī dù** (树天之度, "measuring the celestial order"), harmonizing the four seasons’ yin and yang, distinguishing the stars, constellations, and the luminaries of sun and moon, to manifest the **jīngwèi** (经卫, "Channels and Defensive Qi"), making it ever clearer for future generations.
*"Measuring the celestial order"* refers to its lofty and boundless nature. *"Harmonizing the four seasons’ yin and yang"* means following the sequence of qi. *"Distinguishing the stars, constellations, and the luminaries"* refers to scholars’ differentiation of great and minor illuminations.

**New collation notes:** *"According to the Tàisù (太素), '列' (liè, 'array') is used instead of '别' (bié)."*
He sought to transmit the teachings to Shénnóng, doubting whether they originated with the **Èrhuáng** (二皇, "Two Sovereigns").

The Emperor said: *"Excellent! Do not lose this. All these are the outer and inner correspondences of yin and yang, male and female, above and below, mutually responding. The Daoist who knows the celestial patterns above, the earthly geography below, and human affairs within can endure long and teach the masses without doubt. This medical discourse can be passed down to posterity as a treasure—because it is made manifest."*

Léi Gōng said: *"May I receive this Dao? I will recite, comprehend, and apply it."*

The recitation is also a discourse. The recitation and elucidation are what bring understanding through close comparison.

The Emperor said: *"Have you not heard of the* **Yīnyáng Chuán** *(《阴阳传》)?*
Léi Gōng replied: *"I have not."*

The Emperor said: *"The Three Yangs belong to Heaven’s domain—meaning the Three Yang *qi* in the human body, which move and reside above. The* **Yīnyáng Chuán** *is an ancient text on transformation. Above and below are without constancy; when they converge, disease arises, and the imbalance harms yin and yang. Above and below are without constancy—meaning the *qi* flows irregularly, neither fixed above nor below. When they converge, disease arises—referring to the Three Yangs of the hands and feet merging to cause illness. When the Yangs converge excessively, the vital essence weakens, thus impairing yin and yang’s functions."*

Léi Gōng said: *"The Three Yangs are overwhelming—I beg to hear their resolution."*

The Emperor said: *"When the Three Yangs converge alone, it means all six Yangs have converged—like wind and rain, causing *diān* sickness above and *lòu* disease below. Converged, it refers to the Three Yangs of the hands and the Three Yangs of the feet merging. The Foot *Tàiyáng* vessel arises from the inner canthus, ascending to the forehead and meeting at the crown; its branching path goes from the crown to the upper ear angle, while its direct course enters to network the brain, descends to branch below the nape, follows the shoulder’s inner side along the spine to the waist, then enters to circulate through the loins, connecting to the kidneys and linking with the bladder. The Hand *Tàiyáng* vessel arises from the hand, ascending the arm to meet above the shoulder, entering the supraclavicular fossa to network the heart, descending the throat to the epigastrium, reaching the stomach, and linking with the small intestine. Thus, above it causes *diān* sickness, and below it causes *lòu* disease. *Lòu* refers to blood and pus discharge—what is meant by ‘converged like wind and rain’ is that there is no fixed measure. Hence, the following text states: There is no external standard, no internal regularity; it does not conform to the meridian pathways. Diagnosis finds neither above nor below—it must be recorded and distinguished. When the Three Yangs converge, above and below are without constancy, with no visible signs or *qi* to rely upon, nor a fixed meridian course. The timing of their arrival and the resulting symptoms are irregular, requiring textual records for differentiation."*

Léi Gōng said: *"My treatments are sparse in cure—I only speak of intent."* *(Léi Gōng meant: My treatments rarely achieve full recovery; I only explain the deeper meaning to dispel doubt.)*

The Emperor said: *"The Three Yangs are the utmost Yang. When the Six Yangs converge, they become the most extreme Yang. Accumulating and converging causes terror, with disease arising as violent wind—like a collision of minerals, sealing all nine orifices. The Yang *qi* overflows, causing dryness, hoarseness, and throat obstruction. Accumulating refers to their excessive convergence—when the Six Yangs merge overwhelmingly, the Yang’s frustration becomes unchecked, overflowing endlessly, thus sealing the nine orifices. When they converge with yin, above and below are without constancy, leading to intestinal obstruction. Yin refers to the viscera. Yet when Yang presses upon the viscera, the disease is also irregular in diagnosis. If the disease is below, it causes frequent discharge of red and white. This is when the Three Yangs directly affect the heart—sitting becomes impossible, while lying down relieves the body entirely. The Foot *Tàiyáng* vessel follows the shoulder down to the waist, hence sitting is impossible, but lying outward eases the body. The reason is: rising causes the Yang to surge, so one constantly seeks outward relief. Outward movement balances the meridian *qi*, thus the body feels secure."*

*(The text continues:)* *"How then does one know the world? How does one distinguish yin and yang, respond to the Four Seasons, and harmonize with the Five Phases?"* *(meaning: The knowledge is incomplete.)*

Léi Gōng said: *"..."*

The newly corrected text states: From this point to the end of the chapter, the original text by Quán Yuánqǐ was separately compiled as another chapter, titled *"On the Flourishing and Decline of Methods."*

When the Yang is not distinguished, and the Yin is not regulated, I beg to be instructed and enlightened, so as to grasp the ultimate Dao.

The Emperor did not immediately grant this as profound knowledge, hence the repeated request.

When the disease injures the Five Viscera, the sinews and bones wither away. Your words are unclear and indistinct—this means the world’s rulers have exhausted their learning.

This speaks of how even severe illness remains undifferentiated, yet how can trivial ailments be treated to achieve universal understanding?

Still, even this is unknown. Thus, the Dao of governing the world’s rulers and teaching them is exhausted.

The kidneys are nearly failing, and the days grow dim—composed yet unable to act, human affairs grow slack. This is an example of the viscera that are easily understood.

Yet when the kidney pulse is nearly failing, the heart-spirit flickers within, and the sinews, bones, vessels, and flesh grow hollow with late-day aches.

*"Mù"* means *"late."*

If such is the case with the other viscera, their *qi* is merely diminished.

*"Bù chū"* (not acting) means human affairs wither and weaken, no longer flourishing.

The reason is this: it is not that the kidneys are injured, but that they are insufficient.

---
The newly corrected text states: According to the *Tàisū*, it reads: *"the kidneys are nearly failing, and death approaches at dusk."*

*"Wǎn"* is pronounced *"wū guàn"* (as in *"wū"* rhyming with *"guàn"*).

**Demonstrating the distinction between composed and agitated states**
The newly corrected text states: The original text by Quán Yuánqǐ was titled *"Distinguishing White and Black in Composure."*

The Yellow Emperor sat in leisure and summoned Léi Gōng, asking:

*"You who have received the arts and recited the classics—if you can survey diverse studies, compare analogies, and harmonize principles, then speak to me of your expertise. The Five Viscera, Six Palaces—the gallbladder, stomach, large and small intestines, spleen sac, and bladder—brain marrow, tears, saliva, weeping, lamentation, and sorrow; the pathways of water—these are all that give rise to life. Yet in treating them, errors persist."*

From the *"Differentiation of the Five Viscera"*:
The Yellow Emperor asked: *"I have heard that some alchemists consider the brain and marrow as viscera, others the intestines and stomach as viscera, and still others as palaces. They contradict one another, each claiming to be correct, yet none know the true principle. I wish to hear their explanation."*

Qíbā said:

*"The brain, marrow, bones, vessels, gallbladder, and female reproductive organ—these six are born of Earth-*qi*. They are stored in the Yin and resemble the Earth, hence they are called ‘strange and hidden palaces,’ for they are stored but not emptied."*

*"The stomach, large intestine, small intestine, Triple Burner, and bladder—these five are born of Heaven-*qi*. Their *qi* resembles Heaven; they are emptied but not stored. They receive the turbid *qi* of the Five Viscera, hence they are called ‘transformation and transmission palaces.’"*

Thus, the ancients who treated diseases considered these distinctions as errors.

You must clarify them—then you may achieve perfect mastery. If you cannot, you will be reviled by the world.

*"If one cannot discern them, even slight actions may harm the living—thus, when people hear such discussions, many harbor resentment and blame. Lěigōng said:

*'Your servant has recited the *Pulse Classic* (《脉经》), both its upper and lower chapters, in great abundance. Though I distinguish its anomalies and compare its categories, I still cannot grasp its full meaning—how much less could I ever truly comprehend it!*

*'The recitation of the *Pulse Classic*’s two chapters is extensive, yet even in distinguishing its anomalies and comparing its categories, I cannot yet harmonize their principles to achieve full mastery—how could I ever hope to clarify them in my mind?*

*'安 (ān), meaning ‘how could’ or ‘how much less.’*

*The Yellow Emperor said:

*'Let me test your ability to discern the faults of the Five Viscera, the disharmonies of the Six Palaces, the failures of acupuncture and lithotomy, the appropriate use of toxic medicines, and the flavors of decoctions—describe their conditions in full and respond completely. I will then ask what you do not know.*

*'过 (guò) refers to faults, meaning diseases arising from deviations beyond the usual pulse patterns. Toxic medicines attack evil *qi*, while flavors nourish and replenish—your test now reveals whether you know or do not know.*

*○The newly corrected edition reads: ‘按《太素》别试作诚别’ (According to the *Great Essentials*, ‘别试’ should be ‘诚别’).*

*Lěigōng said:

*'When the liver is deficient, when the kidneys are deficient, or when the spleen is deficient, all cause heaviness in the body, fatigue, and suppressed resentment. One should administer toxic medicines, acupuncture and moxibustion, lithotomy, or decoctions—yet some patients improve while others do not. I wish to hear your resolution to this dilemma?*

*'Your servant, following the Emperor’s inquiry, speaks of the faults of the Five Viscera and the toxic medicines and decoctions—thus, the question pertains to this very disease.*

*The Emperor said:

*'You are so long in years yet speak so little—it seems I truly question you only to invite my own errors. My inquiry does not align with your response, so I say this to admit my own mistake.*

*'I asked you of the subtle and unseen—why do you reply with the upper and lower chapters?*

*'窈冥 (yǎomíng) refers to what is not outwardly visible, meaning the pulse’s manifestation of form, *qi*, and the circulation of *Nourishing* and *Defensive* *qi*.*

*In the *Eight Correct Principles of Divine Brilliance* (《八正神明论》), Qíbā replied to the Yellow Emperor:

*'To observe the murky and unseen—it means that the pulse’s form, *qi*, and the circulation of *Nourishing* and *Defensive* *qi* do not outwardly manifest, yet the skilled physician alone knows them. By aligning the daily warmth and cold, the lunar waxing and waning, and the seasonal *qi*’s fluctuations, one can harmonize and regulate them. The physician often perceives these changes before they surface externally—thus, it is said: “To observe the murky and unseen.”*

*Hence, the Emperor said: *“I asked you of the subtle and unseen.”*

*Yet, when the liver, kidneys, or spleen are deficient, the intent of the *Pulse Classic*’s upper and lower chapters must be clarified—thus, the Emperor said: *“Why do you reply with the upper and lower chapters?”*

*When the spleen is deficient, its pulse floats like that of the lungs; when the kidneys are deficient, their pulse is slightly floating like that of the spleen; when the liver is deficient, its pulse is hurried and scattered like that of the kidneys. These are all cases where physicians often become confused, but they can be discerned with careful consideration.*

*Why does the spleen’s deficient pulse float like that of the lungs, the kidneys’ deficient pulse slightly float like that of the spleen, and the liver’s deficient pulse hurry and scatter like that of the kidneys?*

*It is because the Three Viscera (liver, kidneys, spleen) are closely related, so their pulse patterns overlap and resemble one another. Thus, physicians become perplexed and make errors in treatment.*

*Even so, one should still proceed with calm and measured deliberation, carefully comparing and categorizing them, and await the Three Viscera’s distinct pulse manifestations.*

*How should one approach this?*

*The spleen’s deficient pulse is floating yet relaxed; the lungs’ deficient pulse is floating yet short; the heart’s deficient pulse is slightly floating yet slippery; the liver’s deficient pulse is hurried and tight yet scattered; the kidneys’ deficient pulse is bounding yet slippery. If one cannot compare and categorize them, confusion and doubt will only deepen.*

*Now, the Three Viscera—spleen (earth), liver (wood), and kidneys (water)—reside in the lower abdomen (鬲下), close to one another. Why question this?*

*Lěigōng said:

*'There is a person now: suffering headache, stiff sinews, heavy bones, faintness, shortness of breath, belching, abdominal fullness, and frequent startling. They do not enjoy lying down—what viscus is this manifestation from?*

*Their pulse is floating yet taut, firm like stone upon pressing. I do not know its resolution—thus, I ask again of the Three Viscera, to discern their comparative patterns.*

*The pulse may be floating, taut, firm like stone—hence, the inquiry is about the Three Viscera’s comparative patterns.*

*The Emperor said:

*'It is a matter of careful consideration and alignment.*

*'He means comparative categorization.*

*'Those of advanced years seek answers in the Six Palaces; the young seek them in the channels; those in their prime seek them in the Five Viscera. Those of advanced years are overburdened by flavors; the young are exhausted by their laborious tasks; those in their prime overindulge internally.*

*'Overindulgence internally consumes and injures *Essential Qi* and *Vital Substance*; exhaustion from labor invites wind pathogens into the channels; overburdening by flavors harms the Six Palaces—thus, their focus differs.*

*'Your words now are all in error.*

*The Eight Winds (八风) agitate and ripen, the Five Viscera decay and erode, and evil *qi* is transmitted and received among them.*

*The pulse that is floating yet taut—this is the kidney’s deficiency. The floating pulse signifies deficiency, while tautness reflects the liver’s *qi*. Because the kidney’s *qi* is insufficient, the pulse manifests as floating and taut.’*

*(苑, read as *hú* *ruǎn* *yuàn* [胡阮切])*

A pulse that is **deep and stony**—this is the kidney’s *qi* settling inward.
*"Stony"* means firm. *"Settling"* refers to the kidney’s *qi* congealing inwardly, adhering and failing to flow.

When one is **timorous and breathless**, this is the Waterway blocked, with *form* and *qi* dwindling and exhausted.
The kidney’s *qi* being insufficient, the Waterway does not flow. The lung’s storage is disrupted, so *form* and *qi* scatter and dissipate.
*"Exhausted"* means depleted.

Coughing and **restless distress**—this is the kidney’s *qi* in reverse.
The kidney’s *qi* settling inward ascends to the mother [organ, i.e., the liver].
One person’s *qi* resides in one organ alone.
If one claims three organs are simultaneously affected, this is not in accordance with the principles.
The Classics do not say this.

**Leigong said:** There was a man whose limbs were **loose and sagging**, with **shortness of breath, coughing, and blood discharge**. A foolish physician diagnosed him as having injured the lung, felt a **floating, large, and taut pulse**, and dared not treat him. A crude practitioner applied **bloodletting with a lancet**, and the illness improved—yet excessive blood was lost. When the bleeding stopped, the body felt light. What was this condition?

**The Emperor replied:** Your abilities are many, yet you failed here! To diagnose lung injury and refuse treatment is **reckless perception**, contrary to the principles. *(Lancet, read as *biǎn* [方念切].)*

By way of analogy, the flight of a wild goose soars to the heavens.
The wild goose’s ascent to the skies comes by chance—
how could it be the work of its fluttering wings alone?
The crude practitioner’s use of the lancet was much the same.

The Sage’s method of treating illness follows principles and measures.
Drawing upon analogies and comparing cases, transforming mysteries unseen,
extending from above to below—why cling to the *jing* alone?
By *jing*, I mean the *jingmai* (vessels), not the *jingfa* (principles).

Now, when the pulse is floating, large, and empty,
this is when the *pì* qi has severed externally,
detaching from the stomach to return to *Yángmíng*.
The *Zú Tàiyīn* collateral branches diverging into the intestines and stomach—
thus, the *pì* qi severs externally, failing to return to the stomach and join *Yángmíng*.

When the two *fires* cannot overcome the three *waters*,
the pulse becomes disordered and irregular.
By *two fires*, I mean the two *yáng* organs—the heart and lungs, which lie above the *ge* (stomach).
By *three waters*, I mean the three *yīn* organs—the liver, spleen, and kidneys, which lie below the *ge*.

Yet when the three *yīn* forces prevail over the two *yáng*,
the *yáng* cannot overcome the *yīn*, so the pulse becomes disordered and irregular.

When the limbs are loose and sagging,
this is when the *pì* essence fails to circulate.
Earth governs the limbs, so their collapse is due to the *pì* essence’s stagnation.

When breathlessness and coughing occur,
this is when *shuǐ* qi converges with *Yángmíng*—
the *shèn* qi reverses into the stomach, causing *shuǐ* qi to merge with *Yángmíng*.

When blood is discharged,
this is when the pulse’s urgency restricts blood’s flow.
By *discharge*, I mean blood spilling out.
Yet when the pulse’s force is rapid and urgent,
blood overflows internally, failing to enter the vessels,
so blood discharge occurs.
Because the pulse races and blood overflows,
it is said that blood has no path to follow.

As for diagnosing this as lung injury—
this is sheer error and delusion.
Without drawing analogies, one’s understanding is dim.
To claim ignorance and yet diagnose lung injury
is but reckless, deluded speech.

For lung injury, the *pì* qi fails to contain itself,
the stomach’s *qi* is unclean,
the vessel *qi* cannot govern,
the true organ is damaged and decaying,
the vessels are severed at their sides,
and the five organs leak and discharge—
if blood is not restrained, vomiting ensues.
These two conditions are not alike.

When lung *qi* is injured, the *pì* externally aids it,
hence the saying, *“pì qi fails to contain itself.”*
When the lung organ is damaged, *qi* does not flow,
and stagnation causes stomach fullness,
hence *“stomach qi is unclean.”*
The lung governs the circulation of *róng* and *wèi*, *yīn* and *yáng*,
so lung injury means the vessels cannot fulfill their function.
By *true organ*, I mean the lung organ itself.
If the lung organ is damaged, the skin and membranes rupture,
the vessels are severed and fail to circulate,
and the five organs’ *qi* overflows and leaks—
if blood is not restrained, blood vomiting occurs.
Why?
The lung governs the nose, corresponding to the stomach.
The mouth and nose are the *qi*’s gateways.
Now, if the lung organ is damaged and stomach *qi* is unclean,
if blood is not restrained, it flows downward into the stomach,
so if not expelled through the nose, it is vomited out.

Yet lung injury and spleen injury—
their outward signs differ, and their roots diverge,
so these two conditions are not alike.
It is like the formlessness of Heaven and the lawlessness of Earth—
black and white are vastly distant.

This was my failing.
Since you knew this, I did not instruct you.
This is the same.

By drawing upon analogies and comparing cases,
the *Cóngróng* method ensures even minor cases are not missed.
The newly corrected text reads: *“According to the *Tàisù*, ‘light’ should be *jing*.”*
This is called the Ultimate Way.

By clearly drawing upon symptoms and measuring analogies,
following the *Cóngróng* principle,
even the most subtle cases will not be overlooked.
Why is this so?
Because the Dao’s utmost subtlety enables it.

*Cóngróng* was an ancient text.
How do we know this?
In the *Yīnyáng Lèilùn*, *Leigong* says:
*“I have exhausted my understanding,
received the transmission of the vessels,
and must obtain the *Cóngróng* method
to align with the *Cóngróng* text.”*
This confirms the existence of the ancient *Cóngróng*.

**Excerpt from the *Wǔguò Lùn* (Newly corrected as *Lùn Guōshī*)**
The Yellow Emperor sighed:
*“Ah, how distant it is!*
Like gazing into a deep abyss,
like meeting floating clouds—
one can measure the depths of the abyss,
but the clouds’ edge is beyond knowing.”

Ah, how distant it is!
This laments the Dao’s unfathomable extent.
*Mǐnmǐn*—its wondrous applications are endless.
The depths are clear and still,
so their measure is certain.
Floating clouds drift without fixed form,
so their edge cannot be grasped.

The Sage’s art serves as a model for all people.
In governing intentions and actions,
there must be principles and measures.
Following the vessels and observing numbers,
adhering to medical practice,
this serves as a guide for all people.
Thus, there are five transgressions and four virtues—
do you know them?

If one is cautious of the five transgressions,
one will respectfully follow the four seasonal virtues.
For *dé* is the Dao’s manifestation,
the essence of life—
thus, it must be revered and followed.

The *Shànggǔ Tiānzhēnlùn* says:
*“Thus, they all lived to a hundred years without decline,
for their virtue was complete and undamaged.”*

The *Língshū* says:
*“The Heaven within us is virtue.”*

From this, Heaven bestows virtue-qi,
and humans rely on it to live.
Life-qi embraces the spirit,
ascending to unite with Heaven.

The *Shēngqì Tōngtiānlùn* says:
*“Those who have long communicated with Heaven
have grasped the root of life.”*
This is what is meant.

**Newly corrected note:**
*“For all people’s guide,” Yang Shàngshàn says:*
*“Guide” means “assist.”*

The **Thunder Lord** rose from his seat and bowed twice, saying:
*"Your servant is young and foolish, misled by ignorance. I have not heard of the Five Transgressions and the Four Virtues. I merely compare superficial forms and names, cite the texts in vain, and my heart has no true understanding. The classics were not taught by my master, nor did I gain knowledge naturally—my abilities are shallow, hence my humble words."*

The **Emperor** replied:
*"For all who have not yet diagnosed illness, they must first inquire whether the patient was once honored and later humbled. Even if no external pathogen has struck, disease may arise from within—this is called **Detachment of the Vital Substance** (脱营); it occurs because the spirit is subdued.

When one is in a state of high honor, they are exalted and respected; when humbled, they endure disgrace. The heart yearns for the past, and the resolve is bound by anxious dread, so even without external pathogens, disease arises within. The blood and vessels grow weak and restless—hence the term **Detachment of the Vital Substance**.

If one was once wealthy but later impoverished, this is called **Loss of Essence** (失精); the Five *Qi* linger and diseases converge.

Wealth brings indulgence in desires; poverty depletes one’s abundant resources. Internally, there is pent-up sorrow and agitation; externally, there is excessive grief beyond measure.

Thus, the heart follows longing and attachment, while the spirit obeys such calculations. The **Nourishing and Defensive** pathways are obstructed, causing stagnation and accumulation, which then become disease.

When the medical practitioner examines it, the disease does not reside in the **Zang-Fu organs** (藏府), nor does it alter the body’s form. Upon diagnosis, they may be uncertain, unable to name the illness—this is the **initial stage** of the disease.

The disease arises from attachment and longing, hence it does not settle in the **Zang-Fu organs**. It stems from emotional fixation, so it does not visibly change the body’s form. The physician does not fully grasp it, hence their uncertainty upon diagnosis.

As the body weakens daily, the *Qi* grows empty and lifeless—this is the **middle stage** of the disease. The *Qi* and blood press against each other, consuming the flesh and bones, so the body grows weak and emaciated.

The *Grand Treatise on the Correspondence Between Heaven and Earth* (《阴阳应象大论》) states:
*"Qi returns to nourish the Essence; the Essence feeds on Qi. When the original Qi is weak and fails to transform, the Essence lacks nourishment—this is why."*

For the **advanced stage** of the disease, there is no *Qi* to explore—one shivers and trembles, startled by cold. This is because the disease is deep: the **Defensive Qi** is exhausted externally, while the **Nourishing Qi** is depleted internally. Blood is consumed by sorrow and agitation, and *Qi* is drained by excessive grief—hence the external exhaustion of the Defensive and the internal depletion of the Nourishing.

Why is the disease deep? It is because of this very depletion and exhaustion.

**Newly corrected note:**
*"The **Thunder Lord**’s words: For the **advanced stage** of the disease, it is because the illness has grown severe and extreme. Thus, even the skilled practitioner fails to understand its progression—this is also one of the **mistakes in treatment**. The term *失* (lost) means failing to inquire into its origins.

For all who wish to diagnose illness, they must first ask about their **diet and dwelling**. Since the **Five Regions** (五方) differ in their customs and environments, such inquiry is essential.

The *Treatise on Varying Laws and Regional Adaptations* (《异法方宜论》) says:
*'The **Eastern Region** is where fish and salt thrive, beside the seas. Its people eat fish and favor saltiness, finding comfort in their dwellings and delight in their food.

The **Western Region** is where gold and jade are mined, a land of sand and stone where Heaven and Earth gather and draw inward. Its people dwell in high, windy places, with water and soil that are hard and strong. They wear coarse hemp wraps, eat refined foods, and grow fat with grease.

The **Northern Region** is where Heaven and Earth conceal and store things. Its land is high and elevated, with bitter winds and frigid cold. Its people prefer wild dwelling and consume milk-based foods.

The **Southern Region** is where Heaven and Earth nurture growth, and where Yang *Qi* flourishes. Its land is low, with weak water and soil, where mist and dew gather. Its people favor sourness and eat roasted meats.

The **Central Region** is flat and moist, where Heaven and Earth produce the most abundant life. Its people eat varied foods and do not labor excessively.*

From this, the method of diagnosing disease must first inquire into these matters. Therefore, the **Sage** harmonizes them with appropriate laws, so each finds what suits them best. This is what is meant."*

「Excessive indulgence and excessive hardship, beginning with pleasure and ending in suffering—*new corrected edition*: according to *Tai Su*, it should be "beginning with suffering."*—both deplete the **vital *Qi*** and **Essence**. When the vital *Qi* and Essence are exhausted, the form and body are ruined and decayed.

Excessive joy slackens the *Qi*, while excessive sorrow consumes it. Yet when sorrow and grief agitate the inner self, the vital *Qi* and Essence are exhausted and life is lost. Thus, when the vital *Qi* and Essence are exhausted, the form and body are damaged, and the mind and spirit are in despair.

Excessive rage harms **Yin**, while excessive joy harms **Yang**. Rage causes the *Qi* to rebel, thus harming **Yin**. Joy slackens the *Qi*, thus harming **Yang**. When the rebellious *Qi* ascends, the pulse overflows and the spirit departs from the body. *Ulceration* (厥) is the rebellion of *Qi*. When rebellious *Qi* ascends and overflows the **meridians**, the spirit *Qi* scatters and departs from the physical frame.

Foolish physicians treat this without knowing how to **tonify and drain** (补写), nor understanding the patient’s condition. As the **Essence and Vitality** daily diminish, **pathogenic *Qi*** converges, leading to these two errors in treatment.

Ignoring the distinct nature of **joy, anger, sorrow, and grief**, physicians indiscriminately apply tonification and drainage, treating all cases alike. Thus, the **Essence and Vitality** of the **Five Zang Organs** daily diminish, and pathogenic *Qi* encroaches and converges with the **true *Qi*** of the **Five Zang Organs**, eroding their integrity.

Skilled physicians must discern **unusual and constant pulse patterns**, carefully analyzing them. Those who practice without understanding **Dao/Way**—this is the fourth error in treatment, rendering their skill unworthy of esteem.

*Unusual and constant* (奇怛) refers to pulse conditions that differ from the norm. *Carefully analyzing* (从容) means distinguishing the **Zang Organs’ *Qi*** as either **deficient or excessive**, observing whether the pulse is **high or low**, and noting subtle similarities.

*The Treatise on Discerning Pulse Patterns* (《示从容论》) states: *"When the spleen is deficient and its pulse floats resembling the lung’s, when the kidney’s pulse is small and floats resembling the spleen’s, when the liver’s pulse is rapid and scatters like the kidney’s, these are all instances where even skilled physicians may falter. Yet careful analysis reveals their true nature."*

Diagnosis has three constants: one must first inquire into **social rank**, whether the patient is a **noble or a commoner**, has suffered **demotion or injury**, or aspires to be a **lord or king**. Nobles enjoy physical and spiritual ease, while commoners endure physical and spiritual hardship. Since suffering and ease differ, inquiry must precede diagnosis.

*Demotion or injury* (封君败伤) refers to nobles who have lost their status or titles. *Aspires to be a lord or king* (及欲侯王)—*new corrected edition*: according to *Tai Su*, "desire" (欲) should be "public" (公).—means those who crave nobility but act recklessly.

Thus, even if nobles are not afflicted by pathogenic *Qi*, their **Essence and Vitality** are internally damaged, and their bodies will inevitably decline. **Anxiety and distress** lead to **stagnation and fixation**, while *beginning with wealth and ending in poverty*—though not directly injuring pathogenic *Qi*—cause **withered skin and contracted sinews**, resulting in **muscular atrophy and stiffness**.

When the **Five Zang Organs’ *Qi*** lingers and stagnates, diseases converge and manifest thus. Physicians who cannot **restrict** (严) or **stimulate** (动) the spirit, who outwardly appear **weak and yielding**, and whose treatments fail to restore balance—when disease refuses to shift, their medical practice proves futile. This is the fourth error in treatment.

*Restrict* (严) means **admonition**, the means to **prohibit wrongdoing** and **ensure compliance**. *Outwardly appear weak and yielding* (外为柔弱) means **submissiveness and compliance**. Yet if admonition fails to prohibit wrongdoing, and stimulation fails to ensure compliance, physicians who merely yield to circumstances and lose **Heaven’s natural order**—how can they claim to be physicians when disease does not move?

All who diagnose must know **beginning and end**, must grasp **residual traces**, and when **pulsing and inquiring**, must consider the patient’s **gender**. *Beginning and end* (终始) refers to **vital *Qi* and complexion**. *The Treatise on Pulse Essentials* (《脉要精微论》) says: *"Knowing the exterior, one must diagnose the beginning and end."* Understanding the **Five Colors and *Qi* symbols**, one must diagnose the end and then return to the beginning.

*Residual traces* (余绪) refers to the **remaining signs of disease** after its onset. *Pulsing* (切) means **palpating with fingers**. *Inquiring* (问名) means **asking the name of the patient’s symptoms**.

In males, **excessive Yang *Qi*** makes the **left pulse** strong as normal. In females, **excessive Yin *Qi*** makes the **right pulse** strong as normal. Thus, one must first **compare and harmonize** these pulse conditions by gender.

**Detachment from loved ones**, **abandoning cherished thoughts**, **excessive brooding over worries**, and **fixating on grudges**—when the **Five Zang Organs** are **empty**, and **blood and *Qi*** abandon their **proper dwellings**, even skilled physicians cannot discern them. What then is the value of their **guardianship**?

*Detachment from loved ones* (离问亲爱) means **wandering of the soul**. *Abandoning cherished thoughts* (绝念所怀) means **loss of purpose**. *Excessive brooding over worries* (搜积思虑) means **spiritual exhaustion**. *Fixating on grudges* (结固余怨) means **suffering of the will**.

Those who **neglect loved ones** have their **souls stray**, those who **abandon cherished thoughts** lose their **intentions**, those who **brood over worries** exhaust their **spirit**, and those who **fixate on grudges** suffer in their **will**. **Anxiety and sorrow** cause **blockage and stagnation**, **fear and dread** lead to **scattered *Qi* and loss of proper dwelling**, **excessive rage** brings **confusion and disorder**, and **excessive joy** causes **dispersal and lack of storage**.

Thus, these eight conditions—**detachment, abandonment, brooding, fixation, anxiety, sorrow, fear, and rage**—deplete the **Five Zang Organs**, scatter **blood and *Qi***, and leave even skilled physicians **unaware**. What then can they say?

*New corrected edition*: According to *Jia Yi Jing* (《甲乙经》), *"scattered *Qi* and loss of proper dwelling"* (荡惮而失守) should be *"unable to contain"* (不收). (Note: *惮* is pronounced *dàn* as in "but.")

Having suffered great injury, one severs sinews and cuts veins, yet restores the body’s movement—**allowing the flow of moisture to persist unceasingly**.

Severing sinews and cutting veins refers to **exceeding the body’s natural limits** in overindulgence. Though the body may appear to have returned to its original state, **the vital fluids still fail to replenish**.

Why? Because **the essence and *Qi*** are **exhausted and depleted**.

Moisture (泽) is **vital fluid** (液). Thus, **injuries and stagnations** (敗結) **accumulate**, **thin *Qi* returns to the Yang**, and **pus gathers in the cold regions**.

Yang refers to **all Yang meridians and the Six Fu Organs**. #21 **Heat** (昊) is **fever**. When **non-natural injuries deplete the sinews and veins’ *Qi***, **blood and *Qi* stagnate internally**, lingering without dissipation. If they **thinly adhere to the Yang meridians**, they **transform into pus**, which **long accumulates in the abdomen**, causing **external manifestations of cold and heat**.

Rough practitioners treat this by **frequently needling Yin and Yang meridians**, leading to **body dissolution and limb contraction**. Their death is **inevitable**, yet they **fail to recognize that cold and heat stem from pus accumulation**, mistaking it for **ordinary fever**. They **blindly apply their methods**, repeatedly needling **Yin and Yang meridians and channels**, **depleting *Qi* and worsening the illness**. Thus, the body **dissolves and ceases to function**, the limbs **fail in movement and spasm**, and **death becomes certain**. Is this not because **their lives are predetermined by fate**, rather than by the physician’s skill?

If a physician **cannot discern** the **source of the illness**, merely **declaring the day of death** also makes them a **rough practitioner**—this is the **fifth error in treatment**.

Rough practitioners are **not merely those who lack skill**. Even if one **mastered all Three World teachings**, yet **failed to fully diagnose the two constants** (二常), **did not comply with the Five Errors**, **ignored residual conditions**, and **neglected the patient’s constitution**, they would still be considered a **crude physician**.

These five errors all stem from **incomplete mastery of techniques** and **confusion in human affairs**.

These five are **the so-called "unrefined disciples"**—those who **cannot fathom profound principles** and **remain bewildered even in routine inquiries**.

Therefore, it is said:
**"The Sage’s method of treating illness** must **comprehend Heaven and Earth’s Yin and Yang**, the **four seasons’ cycles**, the **Five Zang and Six Fu Organs**, the **principles of Yin and Yang** (雌雄) **manifestations**, the **indications for acupuncture, moxibustion, and cupping**, the **functions of toxic medicines**, the **patient’s constitution and daily habits**, to **illuminate the Dao/Way and its principles**, and **adjust for nobility, commonality, wealth, or poverty**—each **varies in treatment**. One must **inquire about age, youth, vigor, or timidity**, and **carefully examine the disease’s origin**, the **Eight Principles and Nine Manifestations** (八正九候), so that **diagnosis aligns with truth**.

The Sage’s **comprehensive knowledge** is thus. Physicians should **strive to emulate it**.

The **Dao of treating illness** holds **internal *Qi* as its treasure**. If one **pursues its principles** but **cannot find them**, the error lies in **superficial manifestations**.

If physicians **seek within the body’s form and *Qi*** yet **still err**, this is the **Sage’s treasure**—the **true essence of healing**.

If one **cannot find the principles**, they must **observe the Zang-Fu Organs’ *Qi* and superficial manifestations**.

○ *New corrected edition* states: According to **Quán Yuánqǐ’s text** and *Tài Sū* (《太素》), **"internal *Qi* as its treasure"** (气内为宝) should be **"internal *Qi* as substance"** (气内为实). **Yáng Shàngshàn** notes: Heaven and Earth’s **idle *Qi*** (闲气) is **external *Qi*** (外气), and **human body’s central *Qi*** (中气) is **internal *Qi*** (内气). **External *Qi*** **transforms into the myriad things**, thus called **external substance** (外实). **Internal *Qi*** **nourishes the Defensive and Nutritive systems**, hence **internal substance** (内实). If one **can seek the principles of internal *Qi***, this is **the key to treating illness**.

**Adhere to numerical treatments**, **never losing the essence of the points**—one who **practices this well** will **never face peril in their lifetime**.

Numerical treatments (守数) refer to **the quantity of blood and *Qi*** and **the depth and shallowness of needling**. **According to treatment** (据治) means **to apply the principles of acupuncture points** as prescribed.

If one **merely adheres to numerical treatments** and **applies them strictly**, they **will not lose the essence of the points**.

Peril (殆) means **danger**. If one **does not understand the points’ principles**, **the Five Zang Organs accumulate heat**, and **the Six Fu Organs receive it**. When **Yang heat thinsly adheres**, the **pathways where heat passes** become **pus-ridden**.

If **diagnosis is not precise**, this is called **losing the norm**.

It means **losing the conventional Dao/Way of diagnosis and treatment**.

**Strictly adhere to this method**, and it **will align with the classics**.

It refers to **the earlier principle of seeking internal *Qi***’s essence.

The **Upper Classic** (《上经》) and **Lower Classic** (《下经》) **measure Yin and Yang**, **assess odd and constant diseases**, **examine the Five Zang’s *Qi* colors**, **and discern the Bright Hall** (明堂). **Precisely observe the beginning and end**, and one **can traverse the world**.

The **Upper Classic** refers to **the *Qi*’s connection with Heaven**. The **Lower Classic** refers to **disease’s transformations**.

These two classics **measure Yin and Yang *Qi***, and **odd and constant diseases**—all **subordinate to the Bright Hall’s examination**. **Measurement** refers to **gauging the depth of illness**. **Odd and constant diseases** refer to **unusual and regular illnesses**. **The Five Zang’s *Qi* colors** refer to **the hues of the Five Zang Organs’ *Qi***.

The **Bright Hall** is **where one observes all things**, distinguishing **white from black**, **long from short**. Hence, it is said **"to follow the Bright Hall’s examination"**.

**Precisely observe the beginning and end** means **to examine the Five Colors’ imprisonment of the Sovereign** (囚王), **from end to beginning**.

The **Dao/Way proceeds thus**, its **applications endless**. **Even a blind man’s eye cannot miss**—**every action meets its mark**. Through this, one **ascends to great heights**, thus **able to traverse the world’s inquiries**.

「On the *Obtaining and Losing of Four [Doctrines]* Chapter: Newly Revised Annotation states: According to Quán Yuánqǐ’s (全元起) original title, *Discourse on the Gains and Losses of Rectification* (方论得失明着).

The Yellow Emperor was in the Bright Hall (明堂), with Lèigōng (雷公) attending at his side. The Yellow Emperor said: *"Master, the teachings you have transmitted and the matters you have received are numerous indeed. Please speak of the principles of obtaining and losing, the reasons for obtaining and the reasons for losing."*

Lèigōng replied: *"Following the classics and receiving the traditions, all say that tenfold perfection (十全) is achieved. Yet, in practice, there are instances of gain and loss. I wish to hear the resolution of these matters."*

He meant: *"Though one follows the teachings of the classics and masters the transmitted arts, all claim that they bring tenfold perfection to the people. But when applying them to rectify the body’s defenses (正卫), to propagate the Dao/Way (至道), sometimes one obtains or loses in the world, so I seek to understand their explanations."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Are you still young, your wisdom not yet fully developed (智未及邪)? Or do you speak of combining disparate methods (以杂合邪)?"* That is, *"Does this mean that because you are young and your wisdom has not yet fully matured, you cannot achieve tenfold perfection? Or do you intend to speak of blending various methods with those of the common people?"*

The Yellow Emperor questioned him, though he himself knew the answer. The twelve primary channels (经脉) and the 365 collateral pathways (路脉) are all things that people clearly know, and that skilled practitioners (工) follow in their practice. That is, *"Following the teachings and applying them in practice."* The reason they are not tenfold perfect is that the practitioner’s *spirit* (精神) is not focused, their *will* (志意) does not align with principles, and the external and internal aspects are mismatched, leading to uncertainty in timing (时疑殆).

*External* refers to the patient’s complexion (色). *Internal* refers to the channels (脉). If the practitioner’s *spirit* (精神) is not focused in their practice, their *will* (志意) does not conform to the logical sequence, this is called *roughness and superficiality* (粗略). If they fail to measure the patient’s condition accurately, the complexion and channels will not match, and they will doubt themselves, leaving errors uncorrected.

If one does not diagnose according to the principles of *yin* and *yang* (阴阳) in their proper sequence (逆从之理), this is the first loss in treatment (治之一失).

The *Essentials of Pulse Theory* (脉要精微论) states: *"Forty-five days after the Winter Solstice (冬至), the yang qi rises slightly, and the yin qi descends slightly. Forty-five days after the Summer Solstice (夏至), the yin qi rises slightly, and the yang qi descends slightly. Yin and yang have their seasons, and these determine the timing of the channels."* It further states: *"The subtleties lie in the channels; one must not fail to observe them. To observe them, one must begin with the principles of yin and yang."* Hence, failing to diagnose according to the principles of yin and yang in their proper sequence is the first loss in treatment.

If one does not complete their studies under a teacher (受师不卒), and presumptuously deviates from the [orthodox] *Way* (离#1卫), falsely claiming their methods are the Dao/Way (妄言为道), and arrogantly renaming their techniques based on personal merit (更名自功),*—Newly Revised Annotation states: According to the *Great Essentials* (太素), this should read *"skill"* (巧).*—then recklessly uses *bian* needles (妄用砭石), leaving lasting harm to the body (后遗身咎), this is the second loss in treatment (治之二失).

If one does not fully complete their teacher’s teachings but instead follows their own whims (惟妄是为), abandoning ancient methods for novelty (易古变常), and claims their techniques as their own merit (自功循己), then the harm they leave upon the body (遗身之咎) is indeed fitting. Hence, this is the second loss in treatment.

The *Laozi* (老子) says: *"To leave no harm upon oneself is called following the constant."* This seems to criticize their presumption.

If one does not adapt to the living conditions of the poor and the rich, the noble and the lowly (贫富贵贱之居), nor to the thinness or thickness of their seating (坐之薄厚), nor to the coldness or warmth of their body (形之寒温), if one does not adjust to their dietary needs (饮食之宜), nor distinguish between the courageous and the timid (人之勇怯), and if one does not understand how to compare and categorize (比类), this will lead to self-disorder but not to self-clarification (足以自乱，不足以自明), and this is the third loss in treatment (治之三失).

The poor and lowly are laboring (贫贱者劳), while the rich and noble are at ease (富贵者佚). Ease means that *evil* (邪) cannot easily harm them, while labor means they are easily harmed by *evil* (邪). In terms of labor, the rich are closer to the noble than the poor. In terms of susceptibility to *evil* (邪), the poor are more vulnerable than the lowly. This is the general rule.

However, in some cases of hereditary privilege (世禄之家), these distinctions may vary.»

The bold and courageous are hard to move#2, while the timid are easily harmed. These two differ, for their **Dao/Way** and **qi** vary in strength and weakness.

Observing the principles of poverty, lowliness, wealth, and nobility, one can discern the thinness or thickness of their sitting posture, the chill or warmth of their body, and the suitability of their diet—all by comparing and categorizing.

If one does not know how to compare and categorize, and instead applies **divination**#2 arbitrarily to the heart, this leads to failure—sufficient to muddle#3 one’s thoughts and emotions, but how can one hope for true understanding?

Thus, this is the fourth loss in treatment.

*"Mourning"* refers to grief and fear. *"Breathing"* refers to difficulty in breathing. *"Dietary loss"* means overeating. *"Excess in daily life"* means exhaustion from overwork. *"Injured by poison"* means illness cannot be confined to the standard patterns of organ interactions#7 for treatment.

To grasp the pulse at the *cun-kuo*#4 point without first assessing whether its rhythm is harmonious or discordant—how can one diagnose the true nature of the disease? To recklessly name a condition without proper examination is to be trapped by crude theories, which is the fourth loss in treatment.

Yet even skilled practitioners, though well-versed, may still falter in their fourfold diagnostic#5 methods. Thus, diagnosis fails to grasp the true form and name of the disease—it does not align with the **dharma/classical principles**, but instead invents falsehoods. Crude physicians may still detect blatant contradictions, but how much more so those who deeply understand the **Dao/Way** and recognize its truth?

Therefore, this is the fourth loss.

Hence, when common people speak, they may range far beyond a thousand miles, yet they fail to grasp even the most basic principles of diagnosis. How can one discern the true state of a person through such superficial talk?

The **Dao/Way** of treatment lies in the measured balance of **qi**#7.

*"Treatment"* means to reign as sovereign. *"Balance"* means harmony. The **Dao/Way** of treatment is to first cultivate one’s own virtue/power#6, which harmonizes the **yin-yang qi**#7. When the **yin-yang qi**#7 is harmonized, the eight seasonal winds#10 align; when the eight seasonal winds align, the eight harmful winds#10 cease. Thus, no deformities or spasms arise, and all auspicious signs gather—this too is the **Dao/Way** of effortless understanding.

Therefore, the Yellow Emperor inquired about the noble and ignoble aspects of the body’s **meridians**#11, relying on them to regulate and cultivate virtue/power#6 within the self, so as to rectify the **yin-yang qi**#7 of the eight winds.

The Master of Thunder replied:

"In the beginning of spring, the *jia-yi*#12 direction is green, corresponding to the liver. The liver’s meridian rules for seventy-two days, which is the time of its dominance. Thus, I consider this organ the most noble."

The *jia-yi*#12 direction in spring is naturally green, permeating the liver internally. The *Golden Chamber True Speech* states: "The *jia-yi*#12 direction’s green **qi**#7 enters and connects with the liver." Hence, it is said that green corresponds to the liver.

The five phases’ **qi**#7 each reigns#9 for seventy-two days (5 × 72 = 360), accumulating to govern a full year’s cycle of three hundred sixty days. Therefore, it is said that the liver’s meridian rules for seventy-two days.

The **qi**#7 of the four seasons begins with spring, and the liver’s response aligns with it. Thus, the Master of Thunder deemed this organ the most noble.

*"Organ"* is not the same as *"Dao/Way"*—this is incorrect.

The Yellow Emperor said: "Reconsider your teachings on the upper and lower **meridians**#11 and the **yin-yang**#7 balance. The most noble aspect you speak of is, in fact, the least."

「From **contained** (*róng*), it means ease and moderation in comparison and analogy. The Yellow Emperor reflected upon the *Pulse Canon*’s upper and lower sections, examining the **yin-yang**#7 harmonies and the analogies of their forms and **qi**#2. Since the **qi**#2 of the **five phases**#7 does not center on the liver, he thus declared that what Master Gong considered most noble was in fact the least of its kind.

Master Gong observed the **seven-day fast**#9 of the Yellow Emperor, and each day, he returned to serve in attendance. The Yellow Emperor, however, was not pleased, so he ordered a ritual purification to cleanse the heart. Master Gong, desiring further understanding, thus sat and requested clarification again.

The Yellow Emperor replied: **"Three yang"**#7 are the **meridians**#11, **"two yang"**#7 are the **main tendons**#11, and **"one yang"**#7 is the **wandering section**#11. **Meridians**#11 refer to the **weaving and refining**#11 of the **five phases**#7, which fulfill their duties. **Main tendons**#11 refer to the **sustaining**#11 of the **true essence of Heaven**#11, which anchor the **innate vitality**#11. **Wandering**#11 refers to **circulation**#11. **Section**#11 refers to the **parts of the body**#11. Thus, the **meridians**#11 fulfill their duties, the **main tendons**#11 anchor the **innate vitality**#11, the **vital substances**#11 spread and distribute the **essence and vitality**#11, and the **circulation**#11#7 moves through all the **sections**#11 of the body.

*Newly revised edition says*: According to Master Yang Shangshan’s commentary: **"Three yang"**#7 refers to the **foot Taiyang meridian**#11, which begins from the **inner canthus**#11#12 of the eye, ascends to the head, and branches into four pathways. It descends to the neck and further divides into six **auxiliary and collateral meridians**#11, running along the back, thus forming the **meridians**#11 that correspond to the body. **"Two yang"**#7 refers to the **foot Yangming meridian**#11, which originates at the nose, descends to the throat, and branches into four pathways. It further divides into six **auxiliary and collateral meridians**#11, running up and down the abdomen, serving as the **main tendons**#11 of the body. **"One yang"**#7 refers to the **foot Shaoyang meridian**#11, which rises from the **outer canthus**#11#12 of the eye, encircles the head, and branches into four pathways. It descends to the **supraclavicular fossa**#11, along with six **auxiliary and collateral meridians**#11, governing the **circulation**#11#7 of **meridians**#11 and **vital substances**#11 throughout the hundred joints and flowing **qi**#2 through the three **sections**#11, hence the term **"wandering section"**#11. This understanding reveals the **beginning and end**#11 of the **five zang organs**#11.

Observing the meanings of **meridians**#11, **main tendons**#11, **wandering**#11, and **sections**#11, one can truly grasp the **beginning and end**#11 of the **five zang organs**#11. **"Three yang"**#7 are the **outer layers**#11, and **"two yin"**#7 are the **inner layers**#11. **"Three yang"**#7 refers to **Taiyang**#7. **"Two yin"**#7 refers to **Shaoyin**#7. **Shaoyin**#7 and **Taiyang**#7 form the **outer and inner layers**#11, hence the saying **"three yang"**#7 are the **outer layers**#11, and **"two yin"**#7 are the **inner layers**#11. When **yin**#7 reaches its peak and becomes exhausted, it marks the **new moon**#11 and **full moon’s wane**#11, and yet it must still align with the **five phases**#7 to restore their order. **"One yin"**#7 refers to **Jueyin**#7. **Jue** means "to exhaust." The *Spiritual Pivot Canon*#11 states: **"Hai"**#11#12 is the **left foot Jueyin**#7, and **"Xu"**#11#12 is the **right foot Jueyin**#7. When both **yin**#7 are exhausted, it is called **Jueyin**#7. When **yin**#7 is exhausted, it is the **full moon’s wane**#11 (**"hui"**#11), and when **yin**#7 arises, it is the **new moon**#11 (**"shuo"**#11). **Jueyin**#7 signifies the exhaustion of **yin**#7. When its **qi**#2 reigns#9, it is the **new moon**#11; when its **qi**#2 is exhausted, it is the **full moon’s wane**#11 (**"hui"**#11). Since both its **new moon**#11 and **full moon’s wane**#11 are observed, it is said, **"one yin"**#7 reaches exhaustion and marks both **new moon**#11 and **full moon’s wane**#11. However, when the **yin**#7 is fully exhausted and aligns with the **wood phase**#7’s emergence, it corrects the **five phases**#7’s natural order without deviation or disruption, hence the saying, **"yet it must still align with"**#11 the **newly arising wood**#7 to restore their order.

*Newly revised edition says*: According to the annotation, **"yin"**#7 exhaustion is the **full moon’s wane**#11, and **"yin"**#7 arising is the **new moon**#11, but this seems to be a reversal—it should be **"yang"**#7 arising as the **new moon**#11. Master Gong said: *"I have not yet fully comprehended my studies."* He meant he had not yet clarified the **yin-yang**#7 responses to seasonal changes.

The Yellow Emperor replied: The **"three yang"**#7 I spoke of are **Taiyang**#7, the **meridians**#11. The **yang**#7 **qi**#2 is robust and expansive, hence it is called **Taiyang**#7. When the **Taiyang meridian**#11 reaches the **hand Taiyin (cubital pulse)**#11, its pulse is **tight and floating**#11 but not **deep**#11. One should measure it with the **four seasonal degrees**#11 and examine it with the **heart**#11, combining it with the **yin-yang**#7 theories. The **hand Taiyin (cubital pulse)**#11 refers to the **cubital pulse**#11, where the **meridian qi**#11 manifests. Thus, all pulses converge at the **cubital pulse**#11. The **Taiyang meridian**#11’s pulse is **strong and long**#11, but now it is **tight and floating**#11 without sinking, indicating that the **four seasonal degrees**#11 should be applied to determine its **proper sequence**#11, and its **differences among the five zang organs**#11 should be examined to **verify and harmonize**#11 it, in accordance with **yin-yang**#7 theories, to discern the condition of its **zang organ**#11.

The **"two yang"**#7 refer to **Yangming**#7. The *Spiritual Pivot Canon*#11 states: **"Chen"**#11#12 is the **left foot Yangming**#7, and **"Si"**#11#12 is the **right foot Yangming**#7. When both **yang**#7 merge in brightness, it is called **"two yang"**#7 as **Yangming**#7. When it reaches the **hand Taiyin (cubital pulse)**#11, the pulse is **tight and deep**#11, **urgent and not resonant**#11, and if **restrained (gen)**#11#12, the **disease**#11 will lead to **death**#11. **"Resonant"**#11 means **vibrant and full**#11. **"Be"**#11 means **heat**#11. The **Yangming meridian**#11’s pulse is **floating, broad, and short**#11, but now it is **tight, urgent, and deep**#11 without resonance, signifying that **yin**#7 **qi**#2 overpowers **yang**#7 **qi**#2—**wood**#7 **qi**#2 invades **earth**#7. Yet when **yin**#7 **qi**#2 overpowers **yang**#7 **qi**#2 and **wood**#7 **qi**#2 invades **earth**#7, causing **heat**#11 **diseases**#11 leading to **death**#11, it is because the **yang**#7 **qi**#2 has **declined and failed**#11—like a lamp’s flame flickering brightly as it nears extinction, hence all such cases result in **death**#11.

**"One yang"**#7 refers to **Shaoyang**#7. The **yang**#7 **qi**#2 has not yet reached its peak, hence it is called **Shaoyang**#7. When it reaches the **hand Taiyin (cubital pulse)**#11, it connects above with the **Renying pulse**#11, and the pulse is **tight, urgent, and suspended**#11 without interruption. This is the **disease**#11 of **Shaoyang**#7. The **Renying pulse**#11 refers to the pulse located on both sides of the **larynx**#11, at the same level as the **first cun (inch)**#11 of the **body’s wrist**#11, where the pulse manifests upon contact. **"Tight"**#11 is characteristic of the **Shaoyang meridian**#11, but now it is **urgent and suspended**#11 without interruption, indicating that the **meridian qi**#11 is insufficient, hence it is called the **Shaoyang disease**#11. **"Suspended"**#11 means it moves like a **hanging object swaying**#11. If **yin**#7 **qi**#2 dominates exclusively, it leads to **death**#11. **"Exclusively"**#11 means **"solely"**#11. It signifies that when there is only **yin**#7 **qi**#2 and no **yang**#7 **qi**#2, it results in **death**#11.

**"Three yin"**#7 are the **meridians**#11 governed by the **six channels**#11. **"Three yin"**#7 refers to **Taiyin**#7. Why do all pulses converge at the **hand Taiyin (cubital pulse)**#11? Because it is the **master of the six channels**#11. The **"six channels"**#11 refer to the **meridians**#11 of the **three yin and three yang**#7. Why do they all reach the **hand Taiyin (cubital pulse)**#11? Because the **lung**#11 governs the **convergence of all meridian qi**#11, which gather and meet at the **cubital pulse**#11. Hence, the following passage states:」

「The **qi**#2 converges at **Taiyin**#11—this is the very elucidation of the **lung**#11 governing the **hundred meridians**#11. The *Discourse on Separate Meridians* states: **"The lung governs the hundred meridians."**#11

**"Hidden drum, not floating"**#13, **"upper convergence at the heart"**#11—when the pulse is **hidden**#13 and **drum-like**#13 (i.e., deep and bound), yet does not float upward, this indicates the **heart**#11 **qi**#2 is insufficient, hence it is said to be a **disease of the lesser yang**#11. **"Convergence at the heart"**#11 refers to the **minor heart**#11. The *Treatise on Prohibited Punctures* says: **"Within the seven joints'#13 sides, there exists a minor heart."** This is what is meant.

**Newly Revised and Corrected**#13 states: According to Yang Shangshan#13, **"If the lung pulse is floating and rough, this is considered normal."**#11 Now, when observing a **hidden drum**#13 pulse, this is actually the **kidney**#11 pulse. The **foot lesser yin (kidney meridian)**#11 runs through the spine and is associated with the **kidney**#11, ascending into the **lung**#11 and branching from the **lung**#11 to network the **heart**#11. The **lung**#11 **qi**#2 descends into the **kidney**#11’s **will**#11 (志) and ascends into the **heart**#11’s **spirit**#11 (神). Wang#13 says that **"convergence at the heart"**#11 refers to the **minor heart**#11, but this reasoning is unclear. The **two yin**#7 (i.e., the **foot lesser yin (kidney meridian)**#11) reach the **lung**#11, and their **qi**#2 returns to the **bladder**#11, externally connecting with the **spleen**#11 and **stomach**#11.

The **two yin**#7 (i.e., the **foot lesser yin (kidney meridian)**#11) have two pathways: one that **diverges**, entering the heel and ascending to the **posterior inner thigh**#11, passing through the spine to associate with the **kidney**#11 and network the **bladder**#11; and one that **proceeds straight**, ascending from the **kidney**#11 through the **liver**#11 and **diaphragmatic region**#11 (鬲), entering the **lung**#11. Thus, when ascending to the **lung**#11, its **qi**#2 returns to the **bladder**#11 and externally connects with the **spleen**#11 and **stomach**#11.

If **one yin**#7 reaches the **lung**#11 alone, the **meridian qi**#11 is internally **severed**#11, causing the pulse to float but not **drum**#13. If the **meridian qi**#11 is not internally **severed**#11, the pulse will **hook**#11 and **slip**#11.

**Newly Revised and Corrected**#13 states: According to Yang Shangshan#13, **"one yin"**#7 refers to **Jueyin**#7. These **six pulses**#11 alternate between **yin**#7 and **yang**#7, mutually associated and interlacing, **interconnecting with the five viscera**#11 and uniting **yin**#7 and **yang**#7. Sometimes **yin**#7 manifests as **yang**#7 pulse, or **yang**#7 manifests as **yin**#7 pulse, hence the alternation between **yin**#7 and **yang**#7. This is because the **qi**#2 interchanges and converges. One must carefully **compare and classify**#11 (比类) to discern the **yin**#7 and **yang**#7.

The **first pulse to arrive**#11 is the **host**, the **second pulse to arrive**#11 is the **guest**. How does one distinguish between **yin**#7 **qi**#2 appearing as **yang**#7 pulse and **yang**#7 **qi**#2 appearing as **yin**#7 pulse? By identifying the **first pulse to arrive**#11 as the **host** and the **second pulse to arrive**#11 as the **guest**. **"Arrive"**#11 refers to **arriving at the wrist’s *cun* position**#11.

**Leigong**#11 said: "I have fully comprehended Your meaning, received the **transmission of meridians**#11, and recited the **profound and harmonious methods**#11 to align with the *From Container to Contained*#11. However, I still do not know the distinctions between **yin**#7 and **yang**#7, nor do I know the **principles of male and female**#11. **"Recited"**#11 refers to **reciting**#11 today. **Leigong**#11 spoke of the **profound and harmonious methods**#11 he had received and recited, wishing to **harmonize**#11 with the ancient *From Container to Contained*#11 text. Yet, even when **comparing and classifying**#11 (比类) and **naming and shaping**#11 (形名), he still did not grasp the **order of yin and yang’s precedence**#11 (尊卑之次) nor the **distinctions between male and female**#11 (殊目之义). I pray to **explain**#11 Your intent, to clarify the **teachings of convergence**#11 (着至教), and to reveal how **yin**#7 and **yang**#7, male and female, **respond and correspond**#11 (相输应).

The **Emperor**#11 said: **"The three yang are the father"**#11—**"father"**#11 refers to what **supervises and aids**#11 the multitude of lesser meridians, signifying **exalted status**#11.

「The two yangs are the **Guardian**#11—
**Guardian**, that which **repels and wards off**#11 all malevolent forces, signifying **nurturing life**#11.

The one yang is the **Pivot**#11—
**Pivot**, that which **binds and regulates**#11 form and *qi*, signifying its **equilibrium**#11.

The three yins are the **Mother**#11—
**Mother**, that which **nourishes and sustains**#11 all offspring, signifying **proliferation**#11.

The two yins are the **Female**#11—
**Female**, the **manifestation**#11 of yin.

The one yin is the **Sole Messenger**#11.
The one yin’s **viscera**#17, externally **corresponding**#11 to the **Triple Burner**#11, the Triple Burner **directing**#11 all *qi*, named the **Messenger**#11, hence **Sole Messenger**#11.

Two yangs and one yin: the **Yang Brightness**#11 **dominates disease**#11, unable to **overcome**#11 the one yin, the pulse **fluctuates and moves**#11, and the **nine orifices**#11 all **sink**#11.
The one yin: the **Jueyin Liver**#11, the **wood**#11 *qi*.
The two yangs: the **Yang Brightness Stomach**#11, the **earth**#11 *qi*.
Wood **clashing**#11 with earth, hence **Yang Brightness dominates disease**#11.
Wood **assaults**#11 earth, earth cannot **overcome**#11 wood, hence **unable to overcome the one yin**.
The pulse **alternates and moves**#11—**forked**#11 as **Stomach**#11 *qi*, **movement**#11 meaning **wood’s tyranny**#11—earth and wood **contending**, then **Stomach**#11 *qi* **stagnates**, hence the **nine orifices**#11 **depress and fail to function**#11.

Three yangs and one yin: the **Taiyang pulse**#11 **prevails**#11, the one yin unable to **restrain**#11, **internally disturbing**#11 the five **viscera**#17, **externally manifesting**#11 as **fright and terror**#11.
The three yangs: the **Taiyang**#11 *qi*, hence **Taiyang prevails**#11.
Wood **generates fire**#11; now **excessive yang**#11 **reverses**#11 to wood, wood **receives it again**, the yang *qi* **abundant and rampant**, **internally disturbing**#11 the five **viscera**#17.
The **Liver**#11 **governs fright and terror**#11, hence the **external form**#16 **manifests fright and terror**#11.

Two yins and two yangs: disease **resides in the Lung**#11, the **Shaoyin pulse**#11 **sinks**#11, **overcoming the Lung and injuring the Spleen**#11, **externally injuring the four limbs**#11.
The two yins: the **Shaoyin Heart**#11 pulse.
The two yangs: also the **Stomach**#11 pulse.
Heart and Stomach **converging in disease**#11, **evil ascending and descending together**, hence **internally injuring the Spleen**, **externally overcoming the Lung**#11.
Why so? The **Stomach**#11 is the **Spleen’s granary**#11, **Heart fire overcoming Metal**#11, hence this.
The **Spleen governs the four limbs**#11, hence when the Spleen is injured, **external injury manifests in the four limbs**#11.
The **Shaoyin pulse**: the pulse at the **hand’s posterior wrist**, five *cun* from the body, at the **God’s Gate**#11 of the little finger.
○**Newly corrected text**#16 states: Examining these two yangs, they are the **hand Yang Brightness Large Intestine**, the **Lung’s granary**#11. The **Shaoyin Heart fire overcomes the Metal granary**, hence **disease resides in the Lung**#11. Wang’s interpretation of the two yangs as the Stomach is not entirely coherent. Moreover, his claim that Stomach disease affects the Kidneys is incorrect—this is **Heart disease affecting the Lung**#11. Furthermore, the **Complete Elements Classic**#16 and *Jia-Yi Canon*, *Tai Su*, etc., all state **two yins and one yang**. When the two yins and two yangs **converge**, disease **resides in the Kidney**#11, **cursing and raving**, **vertigo and madness**#11.
The two yins: the **Kidney**#11, the **water**#11 **viscera**#17.
The two yangs: the **Stomach**#11, the **earth**#11 **granary**#11.
Earth *qi* **tyrannizes**#11 water, hence when they **converge**, disease **resides in the Kidney**#11.
Since **Kidney water cannot overcome**#11, the **Stomach flourishes and vertigo ensues**, resulting in **madness**#11.

Two yins and one yang: disease **emanates from the Kidney**#11, yin *qi* **wanders as a guest in the Heart**#11, **filling the lower void**#11, **blocking and sealing**#11, **uncommunicative**#11.
The one yang: the **hand Shaoyang Triple Burner**#11.
The **Heart**#11, the **fire**#11 **granary**#11.
Water **ascends to assail fire**#11, hence **fire disease emanates from the Kidney**#11, yin *qi* **wanders as a guest in the Heart**#11.
Why? The **Kidney pulse**#11 ascends from the Kidney, **piercing the Liver’s crux**, entering the **Lung**, its **branches diverging**#11 from the Lung, **networking the Heart**, and **pouring into the chest**#11, hence such is the case.
Yet the **lower void**#11, yin **guest ascending**, the **Stomach unable to restrain**#11—**Stomach unable to restrain**#11 meaning **earth *qi* is weak**#11—hence the **lower void**#11 **all uncommunicative**#11.
**Sealing**#11 refers to **dams and dikes unable to contain leakage**#11.
The **Stomach pulse**#11 follows the **foot**, the **Heart pulse**#11 networks the **hand**, hence the **four limbs**#11 **seem severed and nonfunctional**#11.
○**Newly corrected text**#16 states: According to Wang’s claim that the **Stomach pulse follows the foot**, in this case of **two yins and one yang**, disease **emanates from the Kidney**#11—**Stomach**#11 should be **Kidney**#11.

One yin and one yang **alternate and cease**#11: this yin *qi* **reaches the Heart**#11, **ascending and descending without constancy**#11, **entering and exiting unknown**#11, the **throat and pharynx dry**#11, disease **resides in the Spleen-earth**#11.
The one yin: the **Jueyin pulse**#11.
The one yang: the **Shaoyang pulse**#11.
Both are **wood**#11 *qi*.
**Alternate and cease**#11: **movement halting mid-process**#11.
Because of this **alternation and cessation**#11, disease **arises**#11.
Wood *qi* **generates fire**#11, hence disease **arises while yin *qi* reaches the Heart**#11.
The **Liver and Gallbladder**#11 *qi*, **ascending to the head**, **descending to the waist and feet**, **central to the abdomen and ribs**#11, hence disease **manifests in unpredictable upper and lower locations**#11.
If **receiving and digesting**#11 **discerns not flavors**, **orifices**#11 **write not their measure**#11, and the **throat and pharynx dry**#11—**the throat’s posterior and pharynx**#11, **belonging to the Gallbladder’s Messenger**#11—hence disease **dries the throat and pharynx**#11.
Though disease **resides in the Spleen-earth**, it **originates from the Liver and Gallbladder’s actions**#11.

Two yangs and three yins: when **ultimate yin**#11 **converges**, yin **cannot surpass yang**#11, yang *qi* **cannot restrain yin**#11, yin and yang **both cease**#11, **floating as blood clots**#11, **sinking as pus**#11.
The two yangs: **Yang Brightness**#11.
The three yins: **hand Taiyin**#11.
**Ultimate yin**#11: the **Spleen**#11.
Hence when **ultimate yin converges**#11.
Yet yin *qi* **cannot transcend yang**#11, yang *qi* **cannot govern the Heart**#11—now yin and yang **clash**#11, hence the **pulse ceases and severs**#11, **unconnected**#11.
The pulse **floating**#11: yang *qi* **clashing with yin**, hence **blood clots**#11.
The pulse **sinking**#11: yin *qi* **clashing with yang**, hence **pus accumulates and discolors**#11.

When yin and yang **both flourish**, descending to **ultimate yin and yang**#11.
If yin and yang **both flourish**#11 and **clash unceasingly**#11, **gradually descending into ultimate yin and yang**#11, it becomes a **grave illness**#11.
**Ultimate yin and yang**#11: in males, the **yang pathway**#11; in females, the **yin vessel**#11, for it **receptively abundant**#11.
**Above aligning with luminous clarity**#11—**luminous clarity**, the **Yang Brightness’s ascent**#11.
**Below aligning with profound darkness**#11—**profound darkness**, the **ultimate yin’s interior**, the **domain of obscurity**#11.»

The art of diagnosing life and death, thus aligning with the solar year’s beginning.
This is the meaning of the **short-term prognosis**.

Lord Lei asked: *"May I inquire about the short-term prognosis?"*
The Yellow Emperor did not respond.
He wished Lei to ask again, compelling a fuller explanation.

Lord Lei asked again.
The Yellow Emperor replied: *"It is found in the Classic Scriptures—*
the teachings of the Highest Ancients."

**Newly corrected annotation:** According to Quan Yuanqi’s edition, from Lord Lei onward, this forms a separate treatise titled *Four Seasons’ Disease Categories.*

Lord Lei asked: *"May I inquire about the short-term prognosis?"*
The Yellow Emperor said: *"For diseases contracted in the three winter months,*
if they align with **yang**,
by the first month of spring, if the pulse shows signs of death,
they will all resolve by the end of spring.
**‘Align with yang’** refers to diseases arising from the union of the anterior yin with yang.
Though the first month’s pulse may show signs of death,
yang has already begun to flourish,
and by the third month of spring—when the King of Life is invincible—
the illness will pass by early summer.

For winter diseases,
their natural course has already run its full term;
when grass and willow leaves wither and die,
**‘killed’**—this refers to the two yin pathways,
the domain of the kidneys’ *qi*.
Yet if kidney disease manifests with signs of death in the first month’s pulse,
it is because the withered grass turns green again,
and though pine#18 leaves sprout, all life perishes.
**‘Natural course’**—this is **‘killed’**.
**‘Term’**—this is **‘with’**."*

「Ancient usage aligns with this. In spring, both yin and yang are utterly severed, with the critical period in the first month of spring. After the onset of spring, if the pulse shows both yin and yang utterly suspended and severed, death is expected before the first month concludes.

○The newly corrected text states: *The *Tàisù* text lacks the character "spring."*
Spring’s three months of illness are termed **‘yang-killed’**—not referring to diseases of cold damage or warm-heat, but to **‘non-seasonal heat’**, where the pulse is surging, abundant, and rapid. Yet within these three months of spring, yang *qi* is still scant, not yet at its full vigor, and if instead there is disease-heat with a pulse matching summer’s *qi*—the classics state that such pulses do not reappear, summer pulses should be surging and rapid, lacking any external yang response—then death occurs at the summer solstice. Since death occurs at the summer solstice when yang *qi* kills all things, it is called **‘yang-killed’**. Both yin and yang utterly severed, death is expected at the time when grass withers. If not yang-killed, but only the yin and yang pulses are suspended and severed, death occurs at the time of frost descent when the grass withers.

Summer’s three months of illness, when yin is exceeded, lasts no more than ten days—referring to heat diseases. If the spleen is afflicted by heat disease, all five viscera are in peril. Earth’s nature is prone to such excesses, hence no more than ten days. When yin and yang intermingle, the critical period is at **‘conceding water’**.* The *Píng Rèbìng Lùn* states: *"In warm diseases, if sweating occurs, the heat returns, and the pulse becomes agitated and rapid, not abating with sweating, with delirious speech and inability to eat, the disease is named **‘yin-yang intermingling’**.* Illness from the sixth month’s heat and dampness, where yin and yang intermingle again, with the two *qi* forces clashing, thus death occurs at the time of the onset of autumn’s candidate already#20. ○The newly corrected text states: *"According to Quán Yuánqǐ’s original text, **‘conceding water’** refers to the seventh month. Jiànshēn, water emerging at shēn, is an inversion of yin and yang. Yáng Shàngshàn states: **‘Conceding’** (yàng) is a variant of *liánjiàn* (lián,廉; jiàn,检), meaning ‘water’s stillness.’ It is the time when water emerges in the seventh month. Autumn’s three months of illness, where the three yang pathways all ascend, will resolve on its own. When autumn’s yang *qi* wanes and yin *qi* gradually emerges, yang cannot overcome yin, hence it resolves on its own. For **‘yin-yang intermingling’**, the patient cannot stand when seated nor sit when standing, for the *qi* does not follow its natural course. When the three yang pathways alone arrive, the critical period is at **‘stone water’**.* The *Zhuózhì Jiàolùn* states: *"**‘Three yang pathways alone arriving’** refers to the three yang pathways ascending together, thus resulting in only yang presence without yin."* **‘Stone water’** refers to the time in winter when water freezes like stone, hence the term **‘stone water’**. Fire is buried in the hour of *xū*, and winter’s yang *qi* is faint, so death occurs at **‘stone water’**.

○The newly corrected text states: *"Upon closer examination of **‘stone water’**, the original explanation by Quán Yuánqǐ is adopted by Wáng’s text."* When the two yin pathways alone arrive, death is expected at **‘abundant water’**—also termed **‘ascending together without yang’**. **‘Abundant water’** refers to the time when both rain and snow have melted into water, which aligns with the middle of the first month’s *qi*.

○The newly corrected text states: *"According to Quán Yuánqǐ’s original text, **‘two yin pathways’** is written as **‘three yin pathways’**."*

**Chapter on the Theory of *Qi*’s Flourishing and Waning**
○The newly corrected text states: *"According to Quán Yuánqǐ’s original text, this chapter is located in the eighth volume."*

**Léigōng inquires:** How much does *qi* vary? What constitutes **‘inversion’**? What constitutes **‘conformity’**?

The Yellow Emperor replied: *"The yang follows from the left, the yin from the right. The abundance or scarcity of yang-qi is determined from the left, and the abundance or scarcity of yin-qi from the right. That which follows is conformity; that which opposes is inversion."*

The *Great Treatise on Corresponding Symbols of Yin and Yang* states: *"Left and right are the pathways of yin and yang."*

The elderly follow from above, the young from below. The elderly are in decline, so following from above is conformity. The young are in their prime, so following from below is conformity. Thus, spring and summer align with yang for life, while autumn and winter align with yin for death. Aligning with autumn and winter means returning to yin, which conforms to the *killing and punishing qi*. Conversely, if one returns to autumn and winter for life, it means aligning with yin for vitality in autumn and winter.

Thus, when *qi* is excessive or deficient in inversion, it results in **ulceration** (*jué*). If yang-qi is excessive or deficient while opposing the right, or yin-qi is excessive or deficient while opposing the left, this is non-conformity, hence the saying: *"Excess or deficiency in inversion."*

If one follows from the left or right in non-conformity, it all results in **ulceration** (*jué*). **Ulceration** refers to inverted *qi*. Hence, it is said to all be **ulceration**.

The questioner asked: *"Does excess also lead to ulceration?"* That is, when deficiency is non-conformist, does it become the disease of inverted excess?

The answer: *"If yang-qi ascends alone without descending, cold ulceration reaches the knees. The young die in autumn and winter, while the elderly thrive in autumn and winter."*

When the *qi* of a single meridian ulcerates upward and yang-qi does not descend, how does one distinguish it? Cold ulceration reaching the knees is the sign. The four limbs are the roots of all yang; when they should be warm but instead are cold above, it is called cold ulceration. Autumn and winter refer to returning to yin, and returning to yin means the disease arises from the right. The young, with yang-qi dominant, thus die in autumn and winter. The elderly, with yin-qi dominant, thus thrive in autumn and winter.

○The newly corrected text states: *"According to Yáng Shàngshàn: The empty state is ulceration. When yang-qi ascends to the head and does not descend to the feet, the foot meridians become empty, hence cold ulceration reaches the knees."*

When *qi* ascends but does not descend, there is headache and **vertex disorder** (*diān*). **Vertex** refers to the upper body. **Vertex disorder** means illness of the head. Seeking yang but not finding it, seeking yin but not discerning it, the five visceral regions are distant without signs. It is as if one were in an open wilderness, or as if confined in an empty chamber. The pain persists faintly, yet does not fully subside through the day.

This means that when the pulse seems like yin is excessive, yet when examined, it seems like yang is excessive—hence, *"seeking yang but not finding it, seeking yin but not discerning it."* The five visceral regions are distant without signs, meaning there is no reliable verification. Yet, if one seeks yang but does not find its warmth, and seeks yin but only finds coldness, and the visceral regions are distant without signs, it is said: *"Seeking yang but not finding it, seeking yin but not discerning it, the five visceral regions distant without signs."*

Such a state arises from prolonged inversion of *qi*, not from the inherent yin-yang cold-heat *qi*. If one is as if in an open wilderness, it means the mind is scattered and restless. If one is as if confined in an empty chamber, it means the will is submerged and withdrawn. Scattered and restless leads to severe pain that does not cease, while submerged and withdrawn leads to pain subsiding but fearing it will return. **Faintly persistent** means the pain is subtle yet unrelenting. Though the body may endure faintly, the mind’s longing is such that it cannot fully complete the day. Hence, it is said: *"Faintly persistent, yet not fulfilling the day."*

○The newly corrected text states: *"According to *The Great Essentials* (*Tàisù*), ‘If one is as if confined in an empty chamber, it is yin-yang’s unity.’ These five characters are likely omitted here."*

Thus, **ulceration of the Minor Yin** causes one to have false dreams, and in its extreme, to be utterly confused. When *qi* is deficient and inverted, it causes false dreaming. When ulceration is extreme, it causes dreams to become utterly confused.

When the three yang meridians are severed and the three yin meridians are faint, this is **deficient *qi***. The three yang meridians are suspended and severed, and the three yin meridians are faint in diagnosis—this is the sign of deficient *qi*.

○The newly corrected text states: *"According to *The Great Essentials*, ‘When the three yang meridians are severed in *qi*, this is deficient *qi*.’"*

Thus, when lung-qi is deficient, it causes one to dream of white objects, or to see people cutting bloodied documents. White objects symbolize the color of metal. Cutting refers to the use of metal. **Bloodied documents** (*jíjí*) is the appearance of death in dreams. If it occurs in its proper season, one dreams of warfare. **Proper season** refers to the three months of autumn. Metal corresponds to arms and warfare, hence one dreams of warfare.

When kidney-qi is deficient, it causes one to dream of boats and drowning people. Boats and drowning people are all uses of water; the kidney corresponds to water, hence the dreams take this form. If it occurs in its proper season, one dreams of being submerged in water, as if in fear. This refers to the three months of winter.

When liver-qi is deficient, one dreams of mushrooms and fragrant grasses. Mushrooms and fragrant grasses are of the plant kind. The liver is associated with plants and wood, hence one dreams of them.

○The newly corrected text states: *"According to Quán Yuánqǐ’s original text: ‘Mushrooms’ is *guì* (cinnamon)."* (Mushroom, pronounced *jūn*, as in *fú-lún* cutting.)

When the season is right, one dreams of lying beneath trees and not daring to rise—this refers to the three months of spring.

When heart-qi is deficient, one dreams of rescuing flames and flammable objects. The heart corresponds to fire, hence one dreams of such things. Flammable objects are also of the fire kind. When the season is right, one dreams of scorched walls. This refers to the three months of summer.

When spleen-qi is deficient, one dreams of insufficient food and drink. The spleen governs#26 water and grains, hence one dreams of insufficient food and drink. When the season is right, one dreams of building walls and covering houses. When the season is right, this refers to the months of *Chén* (辰) and *Xuǎn* (戌), *Chǒu* (丑), and *Wèi* (未), which align with#27 the 18th day. Building walls and covering houses are all uses of earth.

These are all cases where the five *zàng* (藏) organs have deficient *qi*, with excess *yáng* (阳) and insufficient *yīn* (阴). The *fǔ* (腑) organs are where *yáng* resides, and the *zàng* organs are where *yīn* resides. Together, they form the five diagnostic methods, balancing *yīn* and *yáng*, as described in *The Jingmai* (经脉). The *Línggū Jīng* (灵枢经) states: "All diagnostic methods are complete in balancing *yīn* and *yáng* and aligning with the five *zàng* (藏) organs, hence the reference to *The Jingmai* (经脉)." *The Jingmai* (经脉) is a chapter title from the *Línggū Jīng* (灵枢经). There are ten diagnostic degrees: the pulse degree, the *zàng* (藏) organ degree, the flesh degree, the sinew degree, and the *shù* (俞) degree. Each degree has two aspects, hence two times five make ten for measurement.

When *yīn* and *yáng* *qi* are exhausted, the diseases manifest themselves. If the diagnostic methods encompass all the principles of *yīn* and *yáng* deficiency and excess, then the diseases will manifest themselves clearly.

When the pulse moves irregularly without constancy, it means *yīn* is scattered and *yáng* is somewhat deficient. If the pulse is incomplete or omitted, the diagnostic method cannot be consistently applied, and one must then measure the common people, the aristocrats, and the officials, adjusting care accordingly. Why? Because their worries, joys, and sufferings differ in rank.

If one does not fully study under a teacher, the techniques remain unclear, and one fails to discern *nì* (逆) from *cóng* (从). This is called reckless practice—holding onto *yīn* while losing *yáng*, abandoning *yīn* and clinging to *yáng*, failing to understand their convergence, and thus making the diagnosis unclear. All these stem from incomplete learning.

Passed down through generations, they invert the ancient teachings, naturally revealing#33 their errors. When *yīn* is most deficient, the *tiān qì* (天气) is cut off and does not descend; when *yáng* is most excessive, the *dì qì* (地气) is faint and does not rise. This is what is called "not communicating."

"至" (*zhì*) means "most excessive." When *yīn* and *yáng* both communicate, this is the practice of the "至人" (*zhìrén*, perfected individual). "交" (*jiāo*) means "communicating." Only the sage can balance and make them communicate. When *yīn* and *yáng* *qi* both communicate, the *yáng* *qi* arrives first, followed by the *yīn-yáng* *qi*. When the *yīn* and *yáng* *qi* converge and communicate at one point, the *yáng* *qi* arrives first, followed by the *yīn* *qi*. Why? Because *yáng* is swift and *yīn* is slow.

The *Línggū Jīng* (灵枢经) states: "What is called communicating is when both *qi* converge at one point." From this, it is clear that the two *qi* also meet at one point. Thus, the sage holds the diagnostic method, first discerning *yīn* and *yáng* and then applying it. The *Qídié Shì* (奇怛之势) consists of sixty chapters, detailing the alignment of subtle diagnostic matters, tracking the variations of *yīn* and *yáng*, and examining the five central#34 aspects. Within its discussions, it takes#35 the essentials of deficiency and excess, establishes the five degrees of diagnosis, and knows that this is sufficient for diagnosis. The *Qíhéng Shì* (奇恒势) also consists of sixty chapters, but it is not transmitted today. Thus, if one examines *yīn* without obtaining *yáng*, the diagnosis will perish. If one obtains *yáng* without examining *yīn*, their adherence to learning will not be thorough. If one knows the left but not the right, knows the right but not the left, knows the upper but not the lower, knows the beginning but not the end, then treatment will not last long.

If one knows what is *chǒu* (丑, evil) and what is *shàn* (善, good), knows what is disease and what is not, knows what is high and what is low, knows when to sit and when to rise, knows when to move and when to stop, and applies these principles with discipline#31, then the diagnostic method is complete#32, and its efficacy will endure for ten thousand generations. This is the sage's clear and solemn instruction on diagnosis.

*Qi* (气) that remains excessive can reveal what is deficient. The *Bǎomìng Quánxíng Lùn* (宝命全形论) states: "The inner and outer harmonize; nothing precedes the form." It means that once one's own body has excess *qi*, one can then perceive the patient's deficiencies.

Measure the appropriate timing for sitting and rising, and the pulse will reach its subtle state accordingly. "格" (*gé*) means "to reach." Thus, when the form is weak and the *qi* is deficient, death ensues—this is when both the inner and outer are insufficient. When the form and *qi* are excessive but the pulse is deficient, death ensues—this is when the *zàng* (藏) organs are decayed, hence the pulse is deficient. When the pulse *qi* is excessive but the form *qi* is deficient, life ensues—this is when the *zàng* (藏) organs are strong, hence the pulse *qi* is excessive.

Thus, diagnosis has a great method, and sitting and rising have their constancies. When sitting and rising are constant, one's breathing and strength are balanced, hence the diagnostic methods are applied accordingly. When entering and exiting are done in accordance with their proper timing, one's spirit and clarity are transformed. Why is it important to value constant sitting and rising? Because entering and exiting in proper sequence all follow the transformations of spirit and clarity.

One must be clear and tranquil, observing both the upper and lower, governing the eight regular#35 and irregular conditions, distinguishing the five central#34 aspects, and pressing the pulse to discern its movement and stillness. "上观" (*shàng guān*) refers to the observation of *qi* and color. "下观" (*xià guān*) refers to the observation of form and *qi*. The "八正" (*bā zhèng*) refers to the eight seasonal regular conditions. The "五中" (*wǔ zhōng*) refers to the five *zàng* (藏) organs' divisions.

Then, by pressing at the *cùn* (寸, inch) and *chǐ* (尺, cubit) positions to discern the pulse's movement and stillness, one can determine life and death. Following the *chǐ* (尺) position to observe smoothness or roughness reveals the intention of cold or heat. Observing the pulse's size and comparing it to the disease's condition, one can discern whether it aligns with *nì* (逆, contrary) or *cóng* (从, accords). Then, one can also know the name of the disease. If the diagnosis is thorough, it can be tenfold complete, not failing in human conditions. Thus, the diagnostic method sometimes observes the breath and sometimes observes the intention, hence it does not lose its logical order.

Counting the breath's length and shortness and observing the pulse's proper degree, hence the diagnostic method sometimes views the patient's panting. Knowing the breath aligns with the pulse, the location of the disease is also known. The sage observes the conditions and principles, and all these are in harmony.

The Dao is supremely clear and penetrating, hence one can endure and persist through it.
Not knowing this Dao means losing the classics and severing reason—speaking without foundation and setting vain expectations—this is called losing the Dao.
It refers to losing the subtle and most wondrous Dao.

The *Xīngjīngmìlùn* (解精微论篇) is newly corrected, as annotated: According to the original text by Quán Yuánqǐ, it was formerly titled *Fānglùn Jiě* (《方论解》).

The Yellow Emperor, in the Hall of Brightness, was petitioned by Léigōng, who said:
*"Your servant has received and transmitted Your teachings, propagating them through scriptures and discourses. I have demonstrated methods in form, applying yin-yang acupuncture and moxibustion, as well as decoctions and medicines. Though practitioners may vary in virtue or mediocrity, they cannot all achieve perfect mastery. Though Your original instruction could render tenfold completeness, those who follow and practice it may not yet attain such mastery."*

*"Rén"* (仁) refers to clarity of mind and distant vision.
*"Bùxiào"* (不肖) refers to those who cling to false constructions without law.

If one first speaks of sorrow, joy, anger, dryness, dampness, cold, heat, yin-yang, and the female body—asking the reasons behind these—whether of lowly or noble birth, the forms of humanity from which they arise, or how the masses are governed—how to adapt Daoist techniques in urgent matters—I humbly await Your command.

Though all have heard Your sacred edicts, they have yet to fathom their deepest meaning.
I now ask: Are there questions from the ignorant, the cunning, the foolish, or those who seek clarification beyond the classics? I wish to hear their nature.

*"Yú"* (毚) means to scrutinize.
*"Yú"* (愚) means lack of wisdom.
*"Pú"* (仆) means abrupt inquiry, without gradual progression.
*"Lòu"* (漏) means omission—what the classics have yet to elucidate.

The newly corrected text notes: In Quán Yuánqǐ’s original, *"pú"* (仆) was written as *"pǔ"* (朴).

The Yellow Emperor replied:
*"Great indeed! This is the essence of what humanity most requires."*

The Duke inquired: *"Why does weeping sometimes fail to produce tears, yet when tears do flow, they are scant? What is the reason for this? How does the body conceal this process?"*

The Yellow Emperor replied: *"This is addressed in the classics. The *Língshū Jīng* [Spiritual Pivot Classic] discusses the meaning of sorrow and weeping."*

The Duke further asked: *"I do not understand where water originates or from whence tears emerge."*

The Emperor said: *"To inquire thus is of no benefit to governance. This is the domain of the artisan’s knowledge, born of the Dao. Tears and water are both generated by the Dao’s qi. Why ask of it?"*

*"The heart is the sovereign of the five viscera’s essence, its charge to govern. The eyes are its orifices—inner guardian of spirit, outer mirror of clarity. Complexion and hue are its adornment, the outward manifestation of its luminous virtue. Thus, when a person possesses virtue, their qi harmonizes in the eyes; when virtue wanes, sorrow is revealed in their countenance. Virtue is the Dao’s manifestation, the principle of human life. As the *Lǎozǐ* says: ‘The Dao gives birth to it; virtue nourishes it.’ Qi is the master of life, the convergence of spirit. Heaven dispenses virtue; Earth transforms qi, so humanity thrives through this interplay. When qi harmonizes, spirit is at ease; when spirit is at ease, outer perception is clear. When qi is discordant, spirit wanders; when spirit wanders, outward adornment fades. Hence it is said: ‘When virtue is present, qi harmonizes in the eyes; when virtue is lost, sorrow is known in the complexion.’"*

*"Therefore, sorrow and grief produce tears—this is how water originates. The ‘water宗’ [root-water] is accumulated water. Accumulated water is the essence of extreme yin; extreme yin is the kidney’s essence. The reason this essence does not flow is that it is held, supported, and enclosed—thus water does not circulate. The essence of water is *zhì* [resolution], the essence of fire is spirit. When water and fire interact, spirit and *zhì* both grieve, and thus tears arise. The eyes are the pathway of upper fluids, so when water and fire interact, spirit and *zhì* both grieve, and the watery fluid ascends to the eyes. Hence the saying: ‘When the heart grieves, it is called *zhì*-grief.’ *Zhì* and the heart’s essence together surge toward the eyes. Because water and fire interact, it is said: ‘Heart-grief is called *zhì*-grief.’ When spirit and *zhì* ascend together, *zhì* and the heart’s spirit both surge toward the eyes. Tears and weeping are the brain’s essence; the brain is yin. The *Wǔ Zàng Biélùn* [Differentiation of the Five Visceral Organs] states that the brain is born of Earth’s qi, all stored in yin and patterned after Earth. Thus, the brain is yin; the sun’s rays melt it—melting is to consume. The marrow fills the bones. The brain’s seepage becomes tears, flowing through the nasal passages. *Zhì* governs the bones; thus, when water flows, tears follow its kind. Tears and weeping are like brothers—when one perishes, the other does too; when one lives, the other lives. Since *zhì* grieves early, tears and weeping flow together, spreading outward. This is because they share the same origin—the brain. As the saying goes: ‘When tears and weeping flow together, they follow their kind.’"*

*"Why do tears and weeping sometimes diverge in their flow, though they share the same source?"*

The Yellow Emperor replied: *"When weeping fails to produce tears, it is because the grief is not genuine. When tears do not flow, it is because the spirit lacks compassion. If the spirit lacks compassion, *zhì* does not grieve; when yin and yang resist each other, how can tears come alone? When *zhì* grieves, it is consumed inwardly; consumption of yin sends *zhì* away from the eyes. When *zhì* departs, spirit does not guard the essence, and the essence’s spirit leaves the eyes—thus tears flow. Consumption is inward erosion; ‘consumption’ means the ascent of yang against yin. The brain is yin; ‘departing the eyes’ means yin no longer guards them. When *zhì* leaves the eyes, spirit drifts. When *zhì* departs the eyes, their luster loses its inner illumination; when spirit loses its guard, the essence loses its outer clarity—hence it is said: ‘When *zhì* departs the eyes, tears flow.’"*

*"Have you not recited the classics’ words: ‘When *jue* [fainting] occurs, the eyes see nothing?’ When *jue* strikes, yang qi ascends in unison, yin qi descends in unison. Ascending yang means fire burns alone; descending yin means the feet grow cold, and cold feet cause distension. One water cannot overcome five fires, so the eyes grow dim."*

「The five fires refer to the *jue* (sudden reversal) of yang within the five *zàng* (viscera).

○The newly corrected version states: According to the *Jiā Yǐ Jīng* (Canon of A and B), there is no *pí* (blind) character.

Thus, when the *qi* surges against the wind, tears flow endlessly. For when the wind invades the eyes, the yang *qi* internally clings to the *jīng* (essence), and this clinging fire *qi* obstructs the eyes, causing tears to flow upon seeing wind.

When the wind presses and the fire is suppressed and does not erupt, the eyes internally invert. Some liken it thus: when the fire is fierce and the wind arises, only then does rain occur—this is of the same kind.

Hence, when yang is in *jue*, the fire’s blazing light flourishes above but does not illuminate below. Therefore, the eyes, where yang is generated, are linked to the viscera, and it is said: *“When yin and yang are harmonized, the essence is clear and bright.”*

When yang is in *jue*, the light does not ascend; when yin is in *jue*, the feet grow *líng* (numb) and distended.

In saying *“One water cannot overcome five fires”*, it means the hand and foot yang are the five fires, and the descending yin is the *qi* of the liver. When the *qi* surges against the wind and tears flow endlessly, it is because the wind invades the eyes, and the yang *qi* internally clings to the essence, causing the fire *qi* to obstruct the eyes. The wind and heat interact, hence the tears flow.

Thus, when the fire is fierce and the wind arises, only then does rain occur—using the fire’s heat and the wind’s generation of tears as an analogy of the same kind.

○The newly corrected version states: According to the *Jiā Yǐ Jīng*, there is no *huǒ* (fire) character.

The *Tài Sù* (Great Essentials) states: *“When the heavens’ fierce winds arise, only then does rain occur.”*
There is no *shēng* (generate) character.
