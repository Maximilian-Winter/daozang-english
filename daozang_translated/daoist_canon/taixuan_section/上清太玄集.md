### *The Supreme Clarity Great Mystery Collection, Fascicle One*
**By Hou Shanyuan of Gushe**

#### **Chapter One: On the Primordial Transformation of Supreme Clarity**
The Primordial Transformation of Supreme Clarity unfolds in harmonious splendor, revealing the celestial chart.
That which precedes all things is the Dao.
That which ends only to begin anew is nature.
When loyalty does not adhere to sectarianism, the countenance of one who embodies virtue becomes serene and profound—his temples and beard like jade set amidst luminous clarity, radiant with subtle grace.
Delighting in the melody of harmonious winds, he intones the dawn of primordial essence. Unfettered in flight, he roams the paths of the Dao.
The Primordial Ancestor is vast yet without exterior, minute yet without interior; above, round like heaven; below, square like earth. In form and name, it inwardly unfolds the intermingling qi.
Bound by the east’s emergence and the west’s descent, the sun and moon rise and set.
The radiance of great transformation illumines all—mind and matter congeal in brilliance, none fail to respond to its command.

#### **Chapter Two: The Path of Flourishing Virtue**
The path of flourishing virtue lies in its constant application.
Behold the great image: the great image is formless. To give it form is to dazzle the eye, yet naturally its light overflows without limit.
Thus, even one as keen-sighted as Li Lou cannot attest to true wisdom.
Listen to the great sound: the great sound is soundless. To give it sound is to confuse the ear, yet naturally it harmonizes without direction.
Thus, even one as keen-eared as Shi Kuang cannot attest to true hearing.
Utmost hearing, utmost wisdom, utmost adaptability, utmost penetration—all are bestowed within the Dao of the primordial and the level.

#### **Chapter Three: Manifesting Things and Exhausting Principles**
To manifest things and exhaust principles is to embody stillness and receptivity.
Chew and shift the mysterious vision; let jade-like radiance and crimson essence flow forth.
In clarity, it conceals itself in the intervals; in life, it subdues decline.
The mechanism of fortune releases sorrow, attaining constancy; the pattern of pure extension severs the gate of calamity.

#### **Chapter Four: Harmonizing with the Dao and Ascending to Perfection**
To harmonize with the Dao and ascend to perfection is to achieve meritorious virtue.
Movement within the Three Realms is unobstructed only when no barriers exist.
First: things follow transformation—this is the essence of the Dao. Responding and manifesting form is the function of spirit. To employ the useless is the ultimate use.
Second: the mechanism confronts the myriad forms, lifting the veils of ignorance. Shining yet not dazzling—this is the colorless. The color of the colorless is the ultimate color.
Third: the tally of emptiness is not possession; clinging to possession is not emptiness. The emptiness of non-emptiness is called true emptiness.
Comprehending these in unity transcends all bounds.

#### **Chapter Five: Fortifying Nature and Non-Birth**
To fortify nature and embrace non-birth is to delight in transformation. Responding with virtue ensures a life without obstruction.
External meditation is expansive and relaxed; in vast emptiness and stillness, the human Dao merges with the celestial Dao.
Breath harmonizes and fuses; the intermingling qi responds to signs. In luminous purity, the primordial qi and the vital qi connect.
Gaze fixed in auspicious concentration, the numinous bird descends as an omen; the two luminaries exchange radiance—pupil and sun-moon unite their brightness.
Thus, the Six Caverns of Flying Mystery and the wondrous transformations of the Three Palaces divide into the nine qi, converging into the One True.
The transformations of the One True lie in the action of non-action.

#### **Chapter Six: On Gain and Loss**
Gain and loss differ in their application.
To gain is to treasure essence, cherish qi, preserve life, and nurture spirit—embracing the Dao and holding fast to virtue.
To lose is to indulge in greed and desire, mind in chaos and heart in desolation—forgetting one’s root and concealing one’s truth.
To penetrate the mystery and dispel falsehood, to invigorate numinous power and awaken wisdom, is to achieve the merit of resolute advancement.

#### **Chapter Seven: Gathering Intent and Refining Thought**
To gather intent and refine thought is to attain joyful tranquility.
Within, the jade casket appears, resembling the visage of an infant.
The constancy of governing principle and the harmony of natural ease ensure no transgressions; the upright nature keenly senses the mechanism.
To silence it is not to shatter the eye but to heighten desire.
To model it is not to grind the inkstone but to strengthen vigilance.
The transformations of the inner pattern—unbounded and without fixed direction—lie in the action of non-transforming transformation.

#### **Chapter Eight: The Dao’s Vast Embrace**
The Dao’s vast embrace extends without limit.
Above, it covers without bound, upholding the celestial net. Heaven’s roundness establishes its image; sun, moon, and stars descend. Their light hangs day and night, numinous and penetrating—none fail to align with its brightness.
Below, it governs without bound, grasping earth’s yielding nature. Earth’s squareness establishes its image; mountains and valleys fill and empty. Following the seasons, they release transformation—all things arise and are completed within it.
Utmost vastness, utmost greatness—greatness encompasses all. Utmost subtlety, utmost minuteness—minuteness enters all. To extend it is to blend principles; to unify mechanisms is to harmonize all without exception.

#### **Chapter Nine: The Dao Beyond Dao**
The Dao beyond Dao exists yet is forgotten. Following principle’s constancy, forgetting things yet preserving truth—this is how one attains its measure.
Responding to things while forgetting the mind, abandoning principle’s constancy, preserving desire yet losing one’s root—this is how one invites inquiry.
The wise discern this distinction. Such is the seeing beyond sight—this is true seeing. The response beyond response—this is true response.
To respond without imposing transformation is to pervade the boundless Dao.

#### **Chapter Ten: The Path of Inner Stillness**
The path of inner stillness knows the way to keen responsiveness.
Stillness governs movement; uprightness governs deviation.
The law of compliance and change fortifies the substance, unifying the casket. The movement of preserving the level initiates the constancy of abundance.

#### **Chapter Eleven: The All-Transforming**
To be all-transforming is to attain great penetration.
Receiving streams without overflowing—this is the Dao’s abyss.
Congealing emptiness without filling—this is the Dao’s profundity.
Blending qi without excess—this is the Dao’s vastness.
Present in court yet unseen—this is the Dao’s constancy.
Lingering in obscurity yet undimmed—this is the Dao’s principle.

#### **Chapter Eleven (continued)**
Responding to things without cessation—this is the Dao’s transformation.
Communing with spirits without loss—this is the Dao’s fidelity.
Bestowing life without discrimination—this is the Dao’s virtue.
Those who turn their backs on it possess it in full; who can attest to its truth?
Thus do they cast themselves into ruin.

#### **Chapter Twelve: Abandoning the False and Preserving the True**
Abandoning the false and preserving the true, forgetting schemes and severing cares,
all secrecy and pretense dissolve—sincerity of heart and steadfast resolve.
Abiding in stillness, the clamor of disturbance brings no vexation;
serene and holding to simplicity, the spirit’s breath rests in unbroken ease—
this is how clarity is distilled.
Abiding in loyalty, the gourd of prohibitions knows no selfishness;
joyful and nurturing vastness, pure and flourishing—
this is how fidelity is established.
Abiding in virtue, humility veils its light, essence and refinement embrace all;
the unadulterated wind conceals its resonance—
this is how the Dao is joined.
The true Dao walks alone; the defiled Dao is wholly consumed.
To know this as an obstacle is to miss the mark.

#### **Chapter Thirteen: Utmost Sincerity, Utmost Rectitude**
Utmost sincerity, utmost rectitude—delusion and awakening are two mechanisms.
The deluded cling to illusion;
the awakened refine their truth.
Truth is not seen by the eye—gazing upon it dazzles the senses.
Illusion is not grasped by the mind—discerning it verifies wisdom.
The spirit fills the empty valley; abundance must roam freely.
Severing yet penetrating it—this is the repose of sitting in the flowering garden.

#### **Chapter Fourteen: Turning from Awakening to Merge with Dust**
Turning from awakening to merge with dust is to revert to the supreme Dao.
The possession of possessions is foreseen by the possession of no-possession—
gaining it, one loses it, thus becoming a peril to the body.
The use of uses is foreseen by the use of no-use—
preserving it, one forgets it, thus becoming a fetter to the heart.
The color of colors is foreseen by the color of no-color—
illuminating it, one obscures it, thus becoming a dazzlement to the eyes.
The sound of sounds is foreseen by the sound of no-sound—
speaking of it, one silences it, thus becoming a strain to the ears.
The transformation of transformations is foreseen by the transformation of no-transformation—
rescuing it, one betrays it, thus becoming a confusion to the spirit.
Upholding correctness and returning to purity, refining thought and sharpening responsiveness—
this is how one skillfully severs all faults.

#### **Chapter Fifteen: Refining the Subtle and Radiant**
Refining the subtle and radiant—why chase after mere adornments?
Clamor and splendor each cling to their vessels;
secrecy and favor each invite their transgressions.
Yet in the midst of resplendent ornamentation, one suddenly awakens—
the spirit’s eyes open wide, the celestial breath rests in tranquil repose,
sitting in the attainment of spontaneity.
Spontaneity as such is not spontaneity;
not-spontaneity as spontaneity—this is the perfection of spontaneity.

#### **Eulogy**
Seeking the true and revering the teachings, aspirations and vows remain earnest.

**Purification of Heart and Spirit**

Purifying the heart and washing away filth, sweeping defilement and banishing impurity.
The two majestic spirits in serene meditation, severing sharpness and shattering miasmic vapors.
Forgetting form yet retaining essence, shedding falsity to preserve the true.
The body like scattered fragments, its function akin to linked jade.
The Jade Void brims with fullness, the Numinous Treasure overflows with purity.
Supporting the dawn and aiding the subtle, one contracts with the Dao and ascends at daybreak.
The Primordial Unity congeals its origin, the Great One remains undivided.
Preceding heaven through its transformations—this is called "generating the spirit."

---

### **The Dao of Supreme Purity: First Chapter**
The Dao of Supreme Purity, wondrously transforming without bound.
A single qi divides, and heaven and earth are sundered; the Two Modes unite, and sun and moon shine.
The Three Powers respond to their images, the myriad things flourish and grow.
Nurturing the spirit and circulating qi, preserving and refining the primordial essence.
Congealing and transforming it, suddenly an image appears.
Respond to it, and the thousand perfected all govern; penetrate it, and the ten thousand sages all attain.
The thousand perfected and ten thousand sages—none are not within it.
This awakening and illumination—this is called the essential subtlety of the Primordial Subtle.

### **The Radiant Mysterious Yang: Second Chapter**
The Radiant Mysterious Yang, blazing bright across the ten directions.
Scattering the splendor of jade and crystal, releasing the auspicious signs of jade瑞.
Above, it pervades the celestial net; below, it covers the earth’s softness.
Expanding the pivot of the myriad transformations, wielding the handle of the thousand mechanisms.
Things do not receive it and do not live; spirits do not commune with it and do not become numinous.
The numinous nourishes the host of wonders, shining resplendent across the five directions in their time.

### **The Resplendent Void and Brightness: Third Chapter**
The Resplendent Void and Brightness, roaring and blazing with intermingled light.
Its flames kindle the brilliance of sun and moon, its beacons blaze through the bodies of heaven and earth.
Dazzling and radiant, it revolves through the myriad cycles of the numinous.
Freely penetrating and all-pervading, it encompasses the thousand isles in their entirety.
Within, the coalesced pearl is transmitted through the lineage of numinous sages.
Ascending to the Crimson Empyrean’s palace, seated in repose at the Nine Yang’s gate.
The Emperor commands the immortals and perfected to extend their years, their distant lifespans bound to the One without decay.

### **The Body of the Primordial Beginning: Fourth Chapter**
The body of the Primordial Beginning, immaculate and empty, full of purity.
Unadorned and without thing, tranquil and without form.
The formless form that nurtures all forms,
the colorless color that unfurls all colors.
Neither non-being nor being, yet being and non-being respond of themselves.
Neither movement nor stillness, yet movement and stillness follow of themselves.
Heaven does not receive it and does not become clear; earth does not sense it and does not become tranquil.
Things do not commune with it and do not transform; spirits do not receive it and do not become numinous.
The constancy of the Perfect Dao—humans dwell within it yet use it daily without knowing.
As fish in water do not recognize their water, humans in the Dao do not recognize the Dao.
When fish recognize water, they avoid the depths, refuse fragrant bait, and in time grow vast—
leaping beyond Lü Liang, transforming into dragons, thus attaining the water’s mystery.
When humans recognize the Dao, they dwell in seclusion, abandoning ornament and thinning desires,
inwardly preserving primordial qi, outwardly embracing the spirit’s wind.
In time, when their merit is complete, they transcend the Mysterious Pass,
transform into feathered transcendents, and true persons confer their ordination—
thus attaining the Dao’s essentials.

### **Refining Thought Within and Without: Fifth Chapter**
Refining thought within and without, inwardly containing numinous wisdom.
Tempering the true form like jade, transforming the flesh until it is bloodless.
A body like frost and ice—this is the principle of preserving essence to safeguard life.
Outwardly embracing the spirit’s wind, the spirit soars on spread wings,
lightly ascending the mysterious, beyond life and death, unpredictable—
passing through metal and stone, roaming beyond the four quarters—
this is the mechanism of refining the spirit to unite with the Dao.

### **The Mechanism of Movement and Stillness: Sixth Chapter**
The mechanism of movement and stillness, skillfully applied without force.
Illuminating the chaotic image before the Lord of Heaven, comprehending the great cavern beyond the empty valley.
In stillness, vast and boundless, without mind, standing alone and transcendent—the great body severs its obstructions.
In movement, inwardly deploying primordial qi, outwardly blazing the spirit’s light,
merging into the Great Void, pervading and filling the true within.
Returning to the origin, pure and without admixture; realizing the ancestor, offering without measure.
Thus, the wind of plucking the zither—mind without views of severance or constancy.

### **The Divisions of the Great Simplicity: Seventh Chapter**
The divisions of the Great Simplicity, circling thrice complete.
First, the realm of the eternal and peerless, vast and without corner,
covering and bearing all things without fail—this is called the domain of the Imperial Palace.
Second, supporting the pupil and flowing with radiance, dazzling all directions,
nurturing all things without fail—this is called the land of Flourishing Yang.
Third, releasing transformation and ascending to jade-like purity, congealing auspicious splendor,
enveloping the womb within—this is called the homeland of nurturing the self.

### **The Form Born of Turbid Substance: Eighth Chapter**
The form born of turbid substance, a heart washed clean as snow.
A heart pure and desireless, its majesty upright and awe-inspiring.
In movement, it responds to the void; in emptiness, it overflows with qi.
Qi robust, it preserves essence; essence robust, it preserves the spirit.
The spirit not numinous, the Dao not clear; qi not settled, the nature not illuminated.
Illuminating the obscure without fixation—this is communion with the true.
The wings of communion with the true emerge beyond the prior heaven.

### **The Dao Revered Without Rank: Ninth Chapter**
The Dao revered without rank, its counterpart without peer.
Expanding the myriad transformations, grandly grasping the thousand mechanisms—
yet the Great Dao is not sufficient to be its thing, though it is the image of no-image.
Mountains and peaks collapse, winds and thunder rage violently—
yet the Great Dao is not sufficient to be its sound, though it is the tone of no-tone.
Boring through the nine earths, descending to the Yellow Springs—
yet the Great Dao is not sufficient to be its depth, though it is the abyss without bottom.
Gazing to the three heavens, ascending to the vast celestial realm—
yet the Great Dao is not sufficient to be its height, though it is the apex without summit.
Sun, moon, and stars radiate, their intermingled light dazzling, illuminating the ten directions—
yet facing our Great Dao, they are not sufficient to be its brightness.
The Great Void empty of things, penetrating and without mind, desolate and without trace—
yet facing our Great Dao, it is not sufficient to be its emptiness.
Utterly mysterious, utterly wondrous—this is the origin of the ten thousand dharmas.
Utterly obscure, utterly subtle—this is the ancestor of the three vehicles.
Wise yet inexhaustible, spirit-like yet unfathomable—what sage could this be?
It is the principle of the Supreme Mysterious Origin.

### **Utmost Sincerity Without Deceit: Tenth Chapter**

**Utmost Sincerity Without Deceit: Tenth Chapter**

Utmost sincerity is free from deceit, naturally devoid of thought.
The nature traverses open paths—like the dragon’s scales, the radiance of sun and moon.
The spirit soars to the Mysterious Capital—like the phoenix’s plumes, the form of Heaven and Earth.
Its course leaves no trace, its adversaries leave no mark, as transformations unfold within the revolving cosmos.
It ever dwells in the realm of Mount Tai and Hua.

**Transformations of the Spirit-Machine: Eleventh Chapter**

Transformations of the spirit-machine—six perfections share the same principle.
First: nourishing the body without obstruction, the five viscera all unblocked, the seven orifices responding without discord.
Second: knocking at the Dao’s profound depths, plumbing its vast expanse, great elucidation embraces all images without exception.
Third: primordial qi flows and circulates, pervading the empty and boundless, spreading transformation to harmonize all things.
Fourth: the thoroughfare qi preserves fullness, inner bestowal unceasing, merging and blending the primordial of harmonious principle.
Fifth: the fetal radiance is subtle and recondite, its glances swift as shooting stars, its interweaving dense as clouds—none fails to preserve its brilliance.
Sixth: the spirit-lord emerges in transformation, blazing like the sun in lofty flight, pearls, jade, gold, and stone—none fails to emit its light.
Above, it aligns with the Three Palaces—this is called qi within qi, spirit within spirit, Dao within Dao, the three vehicles merged as one, like the Great Void’s image of no-thing.

**Pervasive Illumination of Knowing Clarity: Twelfth Chapter**

Pervasive illumination of knowing clarity—who can attest to its wisdom?

In application yet not attuned to its constancy, in substance yet not exhausting its quiescence.
The deeper the flaw, the more profound the emotion—following the current and losing the source, forsaking the root to chase the branches, those who stray far from the Dao’s standard perish.
The time for nurturing goodness, the resolve of utmost sincerity, released and enlightened, the essence pervades the Great Void—none differ therein.

**Unwavering Integrity and Purity: Thirteenth Chapter**

Unwavering integrity and purity, vigilant and sincere in earnest.
Gentle and pure, reverent and yielding, harmonious and unobstructed.
Integrity means guarding the true with no desire, embracing the Dao without selfishness.
Purity means dwelling in the dust yet unstained, holding jade without flaw.
Vigilance means acting only by principle, following only the Dao.
Sincerity means upright loyalty without crookedness, correct faith without deviation.
Gentleness means yang arising in accord with destiny, qi transforming to return to spirit.
Purity means radiant and unstained, luminous and without intent.
Reverence means ceaseless operation, following transformation without fixed form.
Unobstructed means merging with the Dao as one, pure and without admixture.
Advancing goodness without restraint—this is the essence of attaining the Dao.

**Nurturing Essence and Cultivating Qi: Fourteenth Chapter**

Nurture essence and cultivate qi, preserve and refine spirit and truth.
The body light and graceful, supple and drifting with the wind, riding the swiftness of the Six Voids, roaming beyond the great expanse—transforming without blemish, following opportunity and destiny, responding to change without losing constancy.
Descending, it aligns with earth’s tranquility, giving life to the myriad things, uncrafted yet naturally fulfilling its work.
Ascending, it aligns with heaven’s clarity, weaving the myriad images in silence, unlit yet naturally displaying its brilliance.
Abiding in the center without loss, it merges with the Void’s transformation, governing the myriad spirits, untransmitted yet naturally attaining its measure.
Thus, the vast and sagely embrace all directions, and even those who reach the mysterious yang are but a fraction of this all-embracing vastness.

**The Dao Is Eternally Without Thing: Fifteenth Chapter**

The Dao is eternally without thing, primordial qi interpenetrating the origin, modeling heaven and earth, nurturing and maturing all—all lies within it.
Whether born from womb, egg, moisture, or transformation, all creatures with spirit rely on its virtue.
Waters, valleys, mountains, plains, metals, stones, grasses, and trees—none fail to borrow its truth.
If one awakens to this, preserves essence without loss, nurtures vastness without depletion, refines form and spirit, and merges into oneness, this is called the principle of the mysterious within the mysterious.

**Eulogy**

In the dawn of the great antiquity, the mysterious yang unfolded in transformation.
The primordial spirit-lord opened, the fetal radiance flashed in an instant.
The Yellow Thearch’s luminous thoroughfare, the azure vastness brightly illumined.
Below, it connects to the source-sea; above, it penetrates the cosmic net.
The golden hall gathers splendor, the precious cavern congeals auspiciousness.
Light like jade fragments, lustrous as frost and ice.
Melting and nourishing the cinnabar body, alchemizing the spirit’s realm.
Boundless wondrous principle, unfathomable true constancy.
Embracing the origin and knowing contentment, one dies yet does not perish.

**Treatise on Perfect Illumination**

**First Chapter: Before Chaos Opened**

Before chaos opened, it dwelled in the indistinct, dim and obscure, no form discernible, dark and misty—how could clarity arise?
When the primal chaos was kneaded and split, the initial division appeared: the manifestation of primordial qi was the operation of utmost essence; the movement of ascent and descent was determined by floating and sinking.
Heaven and earth expanded in their covering and bearing, the sun and moon took form in their illumination, the myriad things received life and completion.
Through communication and transformation, it becomes supremely spiritual—nothing it cannot do, nowhere it does not reach.
Called to respond to its substance, employ its truth, establish its image, attain its spirit, and ride its governance and trust—this is how one may perfect sagely achievement.

**Second Chapter: The Dao’s Utmost Nonbeing**

The Dao’s utmost nonbeing becomes its utmost being.
Being is the transformation of spirit; nonbeing is the extremity of stillness.
The path of movement and stillness is the image of celestial patterns and the form of earthly principles.
The changes of the central breath: if preserved, its numen endures to the point of destiny; if violated, its essence scatters to the point of nature.
Called resplendent yet without trace, released yet responsive—this is the full embodiment of yang.
Embodying it fully is merging with its truth; possessing all things is burdening the self.
When the self is not imperiled, it emerges beyond heaven and earth—peerless indeed!

**Third Chapter: The Eon of Constant Principles**

In the eon of constant principles, one relies on feathers to know direction.
Those who labor in transformation externally seal it, internally unfold it.
Governance through stubbornness descends; descent through opposition sinks.
Called round and molded: internally enclosed, externally opened, governance through harmony ascends, ascent through regulation floats.
The communication of ascent, the preservation of descent, the breath of the center—without loftiness and clarity, who could attain this?

**Fourth Chapter: The Governance of Primordial Qi**

The governance of primordial qi divides and transforms to generate form.
Establishing its substance, returning to truth, governing through the Dao—this is the utmost of the image-lord.
Called the origin of communication, the precursor of merging, illuminated in all directions, manifesting the principle of singular truth.
What does this mean?
Governing through nature, reaching destiny, released and transformed, the primordial precedes heaven.
The system of the primordial, the ease of position—this is how one may return to the image.

**Fifth Chapter: The Transformation of Primordial Unity**

The transformation of primordial unity is the division of qi and image.
Governing movement and stillness is the operation of floating and sinking.
Called: heaven and earth establish their positions, mountains and marshes connect their qi, rivers and valleys fill their voids, and the void’s attainment of its spirit.
Is it the essence of the Dao’s transformation, or the blood vessels of virtue’s transformation?
Observing above and below, it resembles the body of a plant, the breath of the central current, the function of a maple.
Called near yet unapproachable—those who approach it grow distant.
Distant yet unneglectable—those who neglect it draw near.
Those who attain transformation grasp the realm of near and far.
Without delving into traces, who can comprehend this?

**Sixth Chapter: Governing the Myriad Images**

Governing the myriad images, merging into the attainment of emptiness.

**Seventh Chapter: The Heavenly Body of Qian’s Origin**

Vast in nature, abundant in preservation—what lies to left and right is discerned through the essence of meaning.
Following principle is the gradual advance of refinement.
Illuminating the Dao is the steadfast sincerity of control.
Called: the hard is the body, the soft is its function.
The purity of hardness and softness is the ultimate of the *Yi*’s images.
Called: the Dao’s transformation, virtue’s generation.
Heaven and earth divide into clarity and turbidity; sun and moon move within their measured paths.
The myriad things submit to creation’s work—when transformation stirs desire, it is ever restrained.
To restrain it is to return to the center of the perfect Dao.

**Eighth Chapter: The Sincere and Solemn Will**

The sincere and solemn will is the heart’s estimation.
Yi Yin in nature—nature’s serenity.
If not so, then refine and polish it, lamenting governance that remains unenlightened.
Called: rigid in form, indolent in nature—this is deep delusion, grave confusion.
Called: silently yet keenly acting, clearly yet penetratingly understanding—what does this mean?
It is that the sage illuminates emptiness and non-being as essence, and manifests spirit and transformation as function.
Soaring and wheeling, dazzling as scattered gems—delivered to perfect principle, radiant at the center of heaven and earth.

**Ninth Chapter: Embracing the One and Returning to Simplicity**

Embracing the One and returning to simplicity, centered in seeing the plain.
Desire before it sprouts is directed toward the primordial image.
Returning to the perfect Dao is reverting to the divine lord.
Called: forgetting its unity, pursuing secret forms and names—when resentment and carelessness arise, it becomes a lifelong affliction.
Exhausting principle is the ease of the constant Dao.
The spirit of the perfect Dao is the utmost penetration of spirit, illuminating the myriad wonders and entering the gate of mystery.

**Tenth Chapter: The Reality of Flourishing Virtue**

The reality of flourishing virtue does not mix with things.
Clear, empty, vast, and boundless, it responds to transformation without end.
Its ceaseless movement is one with heaven and earth.
When emotions and nature are not focused, diverging from the Dao, regret and sorrow arise, leading to calamity.
Polishing and refining them leads to nature.
Called: embracing reality releases falsehood.
Supporting the upright removes the perverse.
Called: like the awe of a formidable foe, emerging transformed with sudden clarity—this is the demeanor of one who watches and waits with reverence.
Illuminating the ultimate unity, preserving profit and purity, relying on Qian’s function—this is riding the achievement of change.

**Eleventh Chapter: The Vastness of Qian’s Origin**

The vastness of Qian’s origin is boundless and without direction.
Its Dao grows ever greater—how can one fathom it?
The signs of contraction and expansion, the swift glance of divine insight.
Moving through perfect spirit is gathering in constant use.
Called: gathering in profound contemplation, governing through the One’s convergence.
Attaining principle—who cannot become self-enlightened?
Called: departing from delusion, entering awakening, embracing virtue, guarding against peril, illuminating the resource of the perfect Dao, shining upon the world—all things follow its transformation.
Called: none fail to rest in their allotted place, none fail to fulfill their destiny.
Following this to practice the Dao brings benefit and enrichment to all directions—is this not the beginning of the profound mystery?

**Twelfth Chapter: The Dao’s Law Relies on Purity**

The Dao’s law relies on purity, profoundly still and unmoving.
Deep as an abyss, empty as a void—dim and boundless.
The cycle of ascent and descent is the operation of floating and sinking.
Called: the virtue of compliance and gentleness, the achievement of excellence and beauty, adapting to time and changing with circumstances.
Transformation’s image returns to reality, revealing the end of its linked brilliance—this is the culmination of the storehouse’s inception.
Called: at the boundary of the Great Mystery, perfect virtue harmonizes all.
Diligent and earnest—this is the tranquil garden of the Upper Clarity’s palace.

**Thirteenth Chapter: The Myriad Transformations Open the Origin**

The myriad transformations open the origin, attaining the One’s reality.
The One reality’s change—nothing vast is not penetrated, nothing minute is not reached.
Gathering in the myriad wonders is illuminating the primordial image.
Called: ascending jade-like radiance, entering profound depths, congealing flame and breath, compassing without corners—this is the rule of the companion’s model.
Companions changing and aligning, black above Qian’s origin, overlooking the myriad images—this is the storehouse’s transformation before the Great Beginning.

**Fourteenth Chapter: The Way of the Storehouse’s Nourishment**

The way of the storehouse’s nourishment is mighty and all-pervading.
Vast and boundless—soaring traces appear and flourish.
Called: exhausting principle—why regret sorrow?
Before it manifests, one cannot preserve harmony, and flaws obstruct clarity.
Thus the sage’s keenness is silent yet settled, open yet ascending—this is supporting insight and unfolding wisdom.
Called: shifting the gaze and entwining the spirit, its virtue is keen.
Vast in teaching’s achievement—this is the assembly that covers and sustains all.

**Fifteenth Chapter: Culmination in the Perfect Dao**

Culmination in the perfect Dao does not cling to deliberate action.
Not relying on nature—how could it be so?

**Min said:** To verify transformation in pure *gui*—the essence’s true perfection—brilliant and congealed in radiance: ah! This is the origin of the ten thousand forms.

**Yi-zi said:** The master’s existence is thus.
**He asked:** Is it so?
**He answered:** What could it be?
**He said:** Before Heaven’s before, the perfect Dao’s beginning—beginning and end unchanging.
The perfect Dao’s origin, the origin’s transformation—this may be taken as my master.
**He said:** Great indeed is the numinous luminosity! Pervading the Brahmā-realm, profound and boundless without limit, it gives birth to Heaven and Earth, wherein the ten thousand transformations abide.
Adapting to every direction, its transformations are inexhaustible; responding to the level, its responses are unbounded.
One who illuminates the multitude of forms—this is the spirit of my attainment of the Dao.

**The Reading states:**
The Supreme Clarity’s true teaching—*Yuanshi* unfolds its expanse.
The Great Mystery pervades all, its wondrous transformations without bound.
The luminous precious mirror penetrates the ten directions.
The Dao-eye is fully equipped, sun and moon exchanging radiance.
The myriad heavens blaze resplendent, the earth entire shines brilliantly.
Majestic and divine, effulgent—refined essence, pure yang.
Preserving harmony, great benefit—all things at peace and well.
The numinous source, the origin’s resource—wisdom severs and unites, resonating through all.
Encompassing Heaven and Earth, merging as one with Qian’s firmness.

*Here ends the first scroll of the* Supreme Clarity’s Great Mystery Collection.
*Here begins the second scroll of the* Supreme Clarity’s Great Mystery Collection.

**Lord Guanshe Shanyuan’s** *Treatise on the Talismans of Yang* **—**
**Chapter One: The Jade Clarity’s Sacred Realm**
The Jade Clarity’s sacred realm—*Yuanshi* unfolds its radiance.
No darkness remains unillumined: it precedes Heaven’s precelestial state.
No transformation fails to arise: it governs the Great Simplicity of the *Yi*.
Pursue it without end, fathom it without measure.
Nameless, formless—
Yet because it is without name or form, nothing exists beyond its naming and shaping.
The sun’s gourd glows with ordered brilliance, circling in stillness alone.
The Dao of Heaven flows ceaselessly, encompassing all;
The mind’s pattern flows ceaselessly, resonating with all.
Coming and going, they meet—substance and essence without fixed form.
Without fixed form: this is called "without form that is not form."

**Chapter Two: Subtlety Manifests Without Extremity**
Sighs at dawn, why mimic the measures of the ancient worthies?
Later schools, straying into side doors, cling to resentment and error.
Greedy for advancement, recklessly hasty—who can remain serene in sorrow for the Great Dao?
Thus, the Dao does not wither or obstruct.
Master Rixuan observes inwardly and attains sudden awakening.
Images without fragrance or luster—first sketching their sorrow—
The Perfect Dao moves from dawn to dusk without cease.
The key lies in curbing desires, stilling the net of cares to nurture one’s destiny.

**Chapter Three: Convulsions Between Life and Death**
Convulsions in life and death—how unlike the hidden repose of the profound!
From life to death, from death to life—
Within the cycle of life and death, who can align with the true principle?
Ni said: The maidservant in the nether bureau, seized by Master Xuan, sought to reclaim her life.
Master Xuan, hearing this, laughed: "Sever your head—how can you argue?
Wound your nature—who will perceive or hear?"
The maidservant, enlightened after long reflection, suddenly rejoiced:
"Now I have awakened to the Dao of governing life and nurturing destiny!"

**Chapter Four: The Marsh Encompasses All Directions**
The marsh encompasses all directions—who grasps its governance?
Gaze into its unfathomable depths, its barriers without end.
Vague and indistinct, yet its essence remains unlost;
Inheriting without attainment, its truth remains unrealized.
Master Rizi, in solemn stillness, unites the primordial and the luminous.
Contemplating the chamber’s essence, awakening to clarity—
This is the Dao of the Three Clarities, self-attuned.

**Chapter Five: The Unfolding of the Divine**
The bronze cauldron unfolds the divine—its questions cannot be exhausted.
Those who grasp abundance and attain prosperity first bestow virtue;
Those who suffer poverty and resent their fate only receive blessings belatedly.
Yet in matters of life and death, gain and loss—
This is one, that is another.
Master Xuan’s words, when applied, are never untrue.

**Chapter Six: Grasping Without Perception**
Eyes that do not perceive, ears that do not comprehend—
Clarity and wisdom have their appointed time, hindered by external things.
Master Yixu sighs: "Voices harmonize with sounds, things connect—
Yet in the emptiness of coming and going, how can dawn be reached?"
Master Taoyi said: "Emptiness that is not empty, things that are not things—
All things arise naturally, and the natural is eternally so.
Nothing fails to attain its proper state."

**Chapter Seven: Observing the Profound and Vigorous**
Profound and vigorous, like water shaping the abyss;
Refined and majestic, governing with orchid-like grace.
Follow the Dao, and the image abides in tranquil clarity;
Abide in it, and the heart finds boundless ease.
Master Yushi, bright as the eye, stirs water with an icy heart—
Not by controlling the abyss.
Profound and unmoving, clear and penetrating—
Exchanging for emptiness and purity, who can fathom its hidden depths?

**Chapter Eight: The Crown of Governance Opens the Constant**
The crown of governance opens the constant, attuned to transformation.
Grasping the profound is like a fleeting glimpse of Yan Hui’s thought—
Awakening and weariness merge with the mysterious, all relying on its truth.
Master Yuanguan: "Perfect clarity attains brightness—brightness in great simplicity.
Vast and luminous in supreme eloquence—eloquence without extremity."
Master Xuanyang said: "Merging and flowing with light, dazzling as one—
Nothing fails to reach its principle."

**Chapter Nine: Responding to Wisdom Without End**
Responding to wisdom without end, cultivation beyond measure—
To measure the boundless, who can extend it?
Your essence and mechanism, eyes that see and ears that hear—
Master Meng said: "Not so.
Your heart’s vexation arises from the eyes’ lack of precision."
Master Shun, in harmony, blooms into perfect perception;
Master Er, in harmony, awakens into perfect clarity.
Master Xuan, hearing this, laughed: "To observe with the mind and exhaust the body is to lose the Dao.
My heart is not for seeing or hearing, nor for clarity or enlightenment.
Not one form, yet not many bodies.
Unfathomable yet inexhaustible, unmade yet accomplished,
Unmoving yet arrived, uncrafted yet refined.
No can, no cannot;
No ability, no inability.
Brilliant and dazzling, yet inexhaustible.
Utterly so, yet not so—
And thus, without being so, it is so."

**Chapter Ten: Probing the Divine Workings**
Probing the traces of divine workings, the image mirrors the true.
Splitting creation, grasping the primordial chaos—
Seizing the summit to control the spirit, thoughts flying like souls.
The cauldron refines essence, keenly pursuing the fleeing hun.
The numinous sleeps in the ancient Dao, traversing the celestial order.
Crystal congeals in cloudy auspices, treasures gleam in misty radiance.
The Solar Palace’s Water Minister, the Lunar Palace’s Flame Lord—
Supreme yang in profound seclusion, embracing simplicity to return to purity.
Radiance seals the earth’s gates, brilliance illumines Heaven’s doors.
The Kunlun Mountains pour forth their essence, rivers and seas flow with their essence.
Climbing the numinous to restore life, the myriad transformations return to the root.
The use of no-use, divine without divinity—
Floating and sinking define their forms, clear and turbid distinguish themselves.
The stubborn vessel converges as one, wisdom and judgment attain harmony.
Waning and waxing complete each other, sending off the old and welcoming the new.
Principles like jade wheels, eyes like ice orbs—
Exchanging emptiness for images, governing with brilliance untouched by dust.
Embracing the vast and divine, enduring through kalpas.
---

**Treatise on Penetrating the Real**
**Chapter One: The Beginning of the Great Commencement**
At the beginning of the Great Commencement, it arose before Heaven and Earth.
Generative transformations without end, governing the essence of nature.
Mysterious and unfathomable, the root and origin of the myriad transformations.
Luminous and boundless—this is the essence of the Perfect Dao.
Master Zi said: "In solemn stillness, wandering between water and moon—
Not controlling form, yet transforming like the destiny of a kingdom.
Serene and flowing, the clear abyss attains its Dao."

**Chapter Two: Governance Transforms and the Primordial Flows Through**
Governance transforms and the primordial flows through—exchanging to attain the purest essence of Liu Chun.
Its spirit cannot be swayed by the most intimate of companions;
its ghosts cannot deceive it.
Clumsy or skillful, all who awaken to its numinous leech
and embrace its harmonious ease
are employed by the Dao without exception.

One says:
"Zhongzi does not wander—
gazing from the hall, he shifts his chamber,
abandoning the chamber to refine his true seeing.
Is this not the uprightness of the inner chamber’s song?"

**Chapter Three: The Radiant Response of Yang**
The radiant response of Yang—
the heart’s glance cannot grasp its essence.
Thus, the worst of delusions and illusions
gradually attain their penetration.
Who can obscure it?
Know that Master Guo and Zhan the Duke
discussed this with the lofty scholar.
Even at the foundation of the Great Mystery,
though a thousand *li* distant,
they grasped the luminous truth and beheld the divine flight of cinnabar’s crucible.
Feathers and tablets reached the source’s end in the great square—
how could they be bound by the emotions of planted trees?

**Chapter Four: The Soaring and the Joining of Companions**
The soaring and the joining of companions—
its Dao does not act for trust alone.
Leisurely, it flows through;
effortlessly, it enters.
Great indeed!
Its body is vast and without limit.

It is said:
"Zijiao is keen—
his ears can turn, his eyes can perceive.
Is this not the ultimate of the pupil’s glance?
Only the sage,
transcending brightness and darkness to reach divine transformation,
is neither used nor unused."

**Chapter Five: The Treasury of Primordial Unity**
The Treasury of Primordial Unity—
the darksome thread at the center.

**The Divine Transformation and the Square of Feathered Blood**

The divine transformation links with change—
feathers and blood meet at the square.
The sun’s gaze is the emptiness of non-emptiness;
the enchantress is the existence of non-existence.
Here, the numinous dawns,
here, the Dao is born.
Stirred by the interplay of void and solid,
one chews the principle of being and non-being.

It is said:
"The cuttlefish governs the abyss,
yet feeds not on the highest good.
The swan commands its qi,
yet does not order the true origin."
Alas! How radiant are the heart and eyes of the enlightened—
who could obstruct the flourishing of their Dao?

**Chapter Six: The Dao Harmonizes with Pristine Essence**

The Dao transcends pristine essence,
steeping in celestial auspices.
Fumes of jade and blossoms,
orchids flourishing in the wild,
green peaches and golden millet,
joyous herbs and numinous plants—
all partake of its blessings.

It is said:
"Muzi is stern in countenance,
solemn in demeanor—
not the heart of drifting smoke or fleeting shadows.
Forever free from deluded cravings,
restoring the luminous clarity of the earth’s essence—
such is the Dao that may be called sagely."

**Chapter Seven: The Subtle and Pristine**

Subtle and pristine,
startling as a burst of radiance,
the form of the bound and the mutilated—
how could it attain brightness?
The appearance of the listless and the scattered—
how could it govern the real?

It is said:
"Xiazi, alert and soaring above the harmony of all images,
chews it whole and leads the ten thousand spirits to follow of themselves.
From above and below, the scrutiny of floating and sinking—
all converges at the true center."

**Chapter Eight: The Numinous Without Limit**

The numinous without limit—
stillness unmoving.
The Dao unfolds without form,
yet luminously pervades all.

It is said:
"Jingzi dams it—
how could he wield its bait?
Nie’s acuity—
is it not the essence of wakefulness?
Yet these two stand tall without plumbing its depths."

It is said:
"Observe the near, yet do not grow intimate—
intimacy distances.
Gaze afar, yet do not estrange—
estrangement draws close.
Though the dull and the wise may differ,
none escape this truth."

**Chapter Nine: Guiding the Myriad to Seek the Dao**

Guiding the myriad to seek the Dao—
pushing to the utmost of awe and reverence.
The two numinous essences,
like the array of jade tablets in ceremony.
The great scrutiny of the ancient Dao—
feathers ascend the vermilion towers of heaven.

Huazi, resplendent,
shines at the center of heaven and earth.
The auspicious omen of empty whiteness—
not the brightest of daily use,
nor the blindness of the sightless and the dull.

It is said:
"The use of the useless—
its use is formless.
The transformation of the untransformed—
its transformation is imageless.
As for the primordial image—
it has ever been revered."

**Chapter Ten: The Near and the Generation of All Things**

Approaching the generation of all things—
this is the ultimate principle, vast and without intent.

It is said:
"The Dao is pure and unadulterated."
"The essence is pristine, secluded, and refined."
"The qi responds and pervades."
"The numinous floats and sinks, settling the body."
"Man masters ascent and descent."
"The guest harmonizes qi and flows with yang."
"Transformation aligns with the numinous and images the emperor."
"Life guides and unites the true origin."
"Pervasive essence refines the cinnabar body."
"Through the nine yangs, the image congeals."
"Mysterious, ever more mysterious—
mystery upon mystery, from the prepared to the inconceivable."

**Profound and Subtle Discourse**

**Chapter One: The Vast Goodness of Obscured Vision**

Vast goodness, obscured vision—
rescued by plain stillness.
Darkness is that which thins its sound;
brightness is that which dissolves its form.
At the juncture of the constant,
benevolence and righteousness are established.
Who, in calming the heart,
lacks true faith?

Ni said to Yu Yuanzi Jing:
"The luster of Kun’s peak, polished into jade,
merges into the radiance of a precious orb.
Empty whiteness fills the numinous—
the essence of the supreme Dao.
Unmixed with things—
the origin of the supreme Dao."

**Chapter Two: The Constant of Suspended Judgment**

The constant of suspended judgment—
its mechanism distant, its demeanor serene.
Thus it is said:
"That which is neither permissible nor impermissible—
this is the Dao that can be spoken.
That which is neither constant nor inconstant—
this is the constant Dao."
Confounding life and death, mingling things—
the ultimate principle is beyond shame and regret.

Ni said:
"Yu Muzi Zhou, with luminous abundance and refined purity,
embodies the purest virtue—
what display could there be?"

**Chapter Three: The Phoenix’s Harmony and Fullness**

The cauldron’s fullness and harmony—
glorious and vast indeed!
It traverses the boundaries of heaven and earth,
transforms the joy of the ten thousand things.
Things and self are not constant;
self and things are not the other.

Ni said:
"Yu Liuzi, penetrating the cavern of Wei’s integrity—
the crane’s cap, laboring yet awakening to radiant enlightenment—
is the morning proof of the island’s numinous dawn."

**Chapter Four: The Chessboard and the Cliff’s Edge**

Offering only the maid’s toil,
feeding desires in distant enclosures—
heart and things in restless tug—
how could one not be stripped bare,
becoming false?

Like drifting mist,
it can never condense into rain or dew,
only to scatter and disperse—
is this not governance by the already exhausted?

Ni said:
"Yu Li

**The Perfection of the Great Mystery, Volume Two Concludes**
**The Perfection of the Great Mystery, Volume Three**
*Composed by Gu Shehou Shanyuan*
*Inscription on the Illumination of the Great Mystery’s Void*

Vast indeed is the teaching of the Mysterious Origin!
It transforms and guides the lost,
unfolds and exalts the ancestral lineage.
Broad and profound, its eloquence—
no eminent scholar can fathom its intent.
Subtle and wondrous, its discourse—
how could the dull and common plumb its source?
Its principles delve into hidden depths,
the True Void beyond measure.
It embraces the ten thousand images,
governing the thousand truths.
Towering, rarely glimpsed;
dim and distant, nameless.

The supreme principle arises from the Primordial Heaven,
its wondrous signs born of the Great Simplicity.
It unites all forms and kinds into one body,
grasps the palm’s center and gathers all to the same mechanism.
The Way of utmost constancy—
who in daily use could know it?

Moreover, heaven’s moisture nourishes blossoms,
yet sweet and bitter each perceive their own taste.
Mysterious words reach the multitude of scholars,
yet the deluded and enlightened reap differing fruits.
Flourishing yet barren—
things thus lose their essence.
Wise yet impure—
virtue thus declines.
Lose rectitude, and it reverts to cunning;
pursue goodness, and it turns to malevolence.

Inwardly, one attains communion with the Mystery,
heart clear, intent unblemished.
Outwardly, one responds to luminous signs,
the Dao complete, spirit whole.
Radiant—advancing toward the primal image;
silent—ascending to the midst of heaven.
The sky, free of drifting haze,
shines with the brilliance of the four qi’s clarity.
Earth joins Hua and Yi,
transforming into a single hue of pure simplicity.

Yet the Dao’s emptiness,
virtue’s brightness,
qi’s clarity,
wisdom’s numinosity—
forgetting form to ascend to image,
one may wander in the Supreme Jade Capital.

**Eulogy:**
Spirit and qi interact,
their use bending and extending.
Forgetting form to preserve essence,
blunting sharpness to resolve entanglements.
The dragon glides in auspicious splendor,
the tiger roars amid propitious clouds.
Heaven opens in fiery brilliance,
earth splits with dark radiance.
The Dao flourishes, luminous and grand;
virtue stands upright, pure and limpid.
Within, it harbors all wonders;
without, it manifests all benevolence.
The image beyond image,
divine without divinity.
Mysterious and numinous, resplendent—
starlike countenance, serene and bright.

**Inscription on the Illumination of the Primordial Spirit’s Perfection**

Before the Great Simplicity,
the Two Modes had not yet taken shape.
Vast and empty, dim and obscure,
primordial essence stirred,
true qi flowed and circulated.
Heaven and earth took form,
sun and moon shone forth.
The Three Powers aligned,
the myriad beings came to life.

Yet within the embrace of heaven and earth,
humans alone are most numinous—
how regrettable that worthiness and foolishness differ!
The foolish are blinded by partiality,
obscured and lost, beyond salvation their whole lives.
The worthy perceive the great unity,
governing and ordering it, leaving nothing of the Dao unmastered.

Orchids and mushrooms share their fragrance,
yet those who cannot distinguish them are at fault.
Phoenix chicks and unicorn calves share their kind,
yet those who cannot discern them bear regret.

The great person
draws forth the rectitude of heaven and earth,
guides the essence of emptiness and nothingness,
embracing the divine light’s vastness,
virtue transforming without limit.

Yet most beings,
knowing only change and decay,
fail to recognize its root.
Aware of its comings and goings,
they do not perceive its gate.

When spirit descends and responds to the profound,
it guards the earth’s patterns,
transforming with things—
manifesting the earth’s boundless, nurturing thickness.

When spirit ascends and responds to the floating,
it guards heaven’s expanse,
dwelling with the stars and celestial cycles—
illuminating the heaven’s limitless, all-encompassing cover.

Serene and luminous,
its radiance penetrates and discerns, perfect and complete.
Empty and unobstructed, without peer,
it merges with the Great Vacuity, vast and boundless.

Thus, forgetting form to enter essence,
embracing the primordial to return to the unbegun—
one knows the *how* and *why* of its being.

**Eulogy:**
The Dao’s light vast and universal,
virtue’s breadth deep and boundless.
Spirit ascends, qi descends—
heaven floats, earth sinks.
Calming the hun, settling the po,
embracing yang, carrying yin.
The crow flies, the hare runs,
the tiger roars, the dragon chants.
The seal hangs from the moon’s horn,
the sword falls into the wave’s heart.
Planting jade in fire,
dredging gold from water’s depths.
Azure clouds and precious cassia,
white feathers and jade-like gems.
Mysterious light pierces the body,
the round image fills the hairpin.

**Inscription on the Supreme Truth’s Essential Gleanings**

The scripture says:
The five colors blind the eyes,
the five tones deafen the ears.
To know by sight is called divine;
to know by hearing is called sagely.

Li Lou could see,
yet his ears lost their acuity.
Shi Kuang could hear,
yet his eyes lost their clarity.

It is said of profound subtlety:
To rescue from excess, delight in simplicity.
The obscure—
one who rarely hears sound.
Yet the sound of a thousand *li* resounds.
The luminous—
one who dissolves form.
Yet the form of a thousand *li* appears.

The Master of Form said:
Not so! My affair is this:
eyes can see clearly, ears can hear keenly.
Encounter the great image—
behold the colorless color, and nothing is unseen.
Expand the great sound—
listen to the soundless sound, and nothing is unheard.

Master Meng said:
Otherwise! Your heart’s vexation
stems from the eyes’ lack of precision.
When the gaze is steady, it attains utmost acuity.
When the glance is tranquil, it attains utmost clarity.

Deng Xi said:
Extreme deafness and blindness—
if the world’s eyes see, nothing is unseen;
if the world’s ears hear, nothing is unheard;
if the world’s minds contemplate, nothing is unknown.
These three lie in non-action.

Master Xuan heard this and laughed:
Because they rely on something,
observing their efforts to strain mind and body,
they all lose the Dao.

My heart—
not one of seeing and hearing,
yet attaining utmost acuity and clarity;
not one of a single form,
yet attaining myriad bodies.

Thus, without exhaustion, it reaches the limit;
without action, it achieves;
without movement, it arrives;
without craft, it perfects.
No can, no cannot;
no ability, no inability.
Vast and unconfined,
it cannot be fully grasped.
Utterly so, yet not so—
yet so, yet not so.

**Eulogy:**
Wondrous indeed, the Mysterious Dao!
Supreme virtue, utmost benevolence.
The sagely who know by hearing,
the divine who awaken by sight.
Congealing the hun, dissolving falsity,
obscuring the po to retain truth.
Ascending and floating, sinking and descending,
advancing and bending, returning and extending.
Yang’s brightness unfolds,
spiritual radiance embraces purity.
Five talismans converge in the pupils,
three hues gather in the clouds.
Tranquil and expansive, pure and harmonious—
pristine simplicity, limpid clarity.

Within transmits the golden qi,
the Mysterious shines upon the jade dawn.

**Inscription of the Supreme Unity’s Primordial Void and Original Form**

The Supreme Unity of Jade Void,
the Mysterious True governs all.
It engenders earth, it engenders heaven,
bestows primordial qi to craft all forms.
Without beginning, without end,
it extends supreme virtue to universally succor the common folk.
All that live depend on its qi,
all that receive transformation rely on its essence.
Silently it abides,
never for a moment straying.
When it establishes, it settles in stillness,
serene and without intent.
When it opens and responds,
brilliant forms appear.
As true primordial descends,
wondrous transformation knows no bounds.
Embracing vastness and breadth,
gold and jade radiate their luster.
Spiritual mushrooms flourish in the wild,
preserving life and prolonging prosperity—
this is the sinking of earth’s response.

As primordial qi ascends,
soaring through the empyrean’s lofty heights,
boundless and distant, it pervades the celestial metropolis.
Forms embody heaven’s substance,
resting in chambers of jade and gem,
wondrous years evoke distant resonance—
this is the floating of heaven’s union.

The Three Terraces converge as one,
the Five Fortunes arrive together.
Merging into the Middle Primordial,
pure and steadfast in heart,
wisdom congeals beyond form,
easily encountering the pivot of the essential Dao.

Yet Ge Hong’s ten thousand scrolls
fail to fathom its essence.
Hui Shi’s five carts of texts
cannot penetrate its mechanism.
Golden script and jade inscriptions
must rely on master and craftsman to be understood.
Precious jade within jeweled caskets
depends entirely on oral transmission to be grasped.

To lightly disclose it invites calamity upon nine generations,
to carefully transmit it brings blessings to the ten directions.
This Dao is the sacred realm of Jade Purity,
the primordial elder of the Void Sovereign,
the supreme and utmost true,
the mechanism of shedding form and transforming image,
entering the sagely and profound mystery.

You must conceal it, guard it well,
never reveal it to the unworthy,
never reveal it to the unworthy.

**Eulogy:**

The Supreme Clarity’s radiant methods,
linked below to the Central Axis.
Its light nourishes celestial omens,
its brilliance ignites cinnabar auspices.
Essence coils through the chamber,
qi swirls to fill the storehouse.
Golden branches dot the snow,
jade osmanthus congeals the frost.
It embraces the divine splendor of the horizontal;
wondrously transforms the numinous yang.
Jade Empyrean’s net of terraces,
its halos harmonize with starlight.
Ascending to the sacred realm,
facing the Primordial Sovereign.
Blessings extend through vast destinies,
eternal longevity and timely well-being.

**Inscription of the Great Peace’s Void and Brahmanic Perfection**

Within the chaos of primordial chaos,
what stillness or presence could there be?
The primal qi flows and circulates,
pure essence stirs and excites—
then the True One arises.
The True One responds to signs,
spirit and illumination emerge from transformation,
the having within the non-having,
the non-having within the having.
Vast, it encompasses all without boundary,
its expanse cannot be exhausted.
Minute, it conceals its spark without interior,
its subtlety cannot be fathomed.
As misty vapors gradually manifest,
heaven and earth merge in obscurity.
Through clarity and penetration, radiance scatters,
embracing the light of the ten thousand images.
Through turbidity and stagnation, obscurity veils,
the vast dispersal of the One True.
The four births and six destinies,
some depart, some arrive—
when will their cycle cease?
The five aggregates and nine perversions,
following sound, following form—
when will their beginning end?
Yet if one turns back with resolve,
with will steadfast and pure,
a single stroke of the wisdom blade
cleaves the mountain of attachment to seize the jade;
the twin swings of the spirit sword
cut through the bitter sea to seek the pearl.
Mysterious light pervades the formless,
the round enclosure forgets its mechanism.
Preserve essence, secure qi,
unlock the heavens of the Great Beginning.
Embrace the Dao, guard the One,
merge into the land of numinous yang.
Roaming through ten thousand realms,
suddenly perfecting the unity of the single body.
Nourishing the hundred rivers,
encompassing the dual forces’ transformative embrace.
The utmost Dao, empty of heart,
internally harbors all functions.
Spirit and illumination, full of belly,
externally display all benevolence.
The three hearts’ vast wisdom,
the five eyes’ perfect clarity.
Responding without abiding in form,
like the moon and sun’s limpid radiance.
Embodying form within emptiness,
like a blind man entering the world.
Knowing the unknowable as knowledge,
seeing the unseen as sight—
if the Dao can be thus,
cultivation follows the threshold of the mysterious gate,
accomplishing the world’s transformations.

**Eulogy:**
The Great Dao is without direction,
those who resonate with it flourish.
Void and numinous wind,
mysterious darkness and cinnabar center.
Primal simplicity’s essence shines,
treasured radiance of spirit and light.
The five directions, pure and harmonious,
the eight poles, clear and cold.
Azure clouds weave the heavens,
the Purple Empyrean’s Central Sovereign.
Primal qi’s auspicious clouds,
the Void and Brahman’s auspicious omens.
Golden tablets and jade scriptures,
phoenix seal and dragon chapters.
Names inscribed in the immortal register—
their principle is beyond the ordinary.

**Inscription of the Great Vessel’s Embrace of Pure Essence**

The Dao has no direction,
virtue knows fulfillment and decline.
Those who accord with principle
have no virtue that can be named.
Those who distinguish through affairs
have names that can be discerned.
Self and other share the same origin,
right and wrong are of one qi.
Adapting to the "is" within the "is-not,"
discerning the "is-not" within the "is."
What are illusions and dreams?
Like the clashing of blades and objects.
Viewed thus,
who can know its truth?
Those enlightened to principle
dissolve the limbs, dismiss brilliance,
detach from form, abandon wisdom,
wielding the numinous mechanism with wonder.
Riding the primal qi’s prior state,
veiling the Three Luminaries beyond the Emperor of Images.
Roaming the vast and boundless,
entering the inquiry of non-having,
communing with the Great Unity—
water, fire, and sharpened blades,
how could they harm?
Yet if the Three Corpses remain unvanquished,
the six desires do not arise.
Aligning with yang essence then treasures the talisman of the nine qi,
dissolving yin substance then accords with the One True.
The golden furnace’s fire blazes,
phoenix contains the sea moon soaring in the sky;
the jade crucible’s broth boils,
dragon swallows the pearl playing in the waters.
Lead congeals, mercury binds,
cinnabar osmanthus streams with rosy clouds.
Dotting the stars, jade ascends to the Purple Palace,
transforming into jade’s brilliance,
its resonance piercing the Clear Capital.
Jade palaces accumulate emerald,
treasured radiance holds clarity,
resplendent purity—
unlocking the midst of the utmost Dao.

**Eulogy:**
The Dao and virtue are the source,
yin and yang precede all things.
Vague and dim, primordial chaos,
the myriad things blend in harmony.
The Four Ones’ mystery and simplicity,
the Two and Three’s azure and cinnabar.
Yellow radiance scours filth,
purple qi congeals lead.
Qi illumines the three realms,
essence shines through the nine heavens.
The Highest Void Sovereign,
the Central Heaven’s numinous immortals.
Pure and subtle treasured transformations,
Yu’s Remnant’s ascension.
Lush and rosy empyrean terraces,
through endless kalpas, unbroken.

**Inscription of the Primal Chaos’s Blending of the Mysterious and True**

Before the primal emerged,
it concealed the essence of chaos and obscurity;
when the one qi first divided,
it revealed the images of heaven, earth, sun, and moon.
The Three Powers thus manifested,
the Four Directions then became clear.
When dryness prevails, spring generates and summer grows;
when purity reaches its extreme, autumn harvests and winter stores.
The myriad beings containing spirit
all turn their hearts toward the sun;
the thousand perfected, easily guided,
all embrace yin while holding yang.
Illuminate and awaken it,
gaze upon the True Origin’s encounter with the body;
communicate and transform it,
hope for the mysterious image’s shedding of form.
The two spirits radiate simplicity,
the one qi surges with clarity.
Profoundly profound,
emerging from the Qian heavens.
Darkly dark,
revering the Kun’s origin.
Deep contemplation—form forgotten, soul scattered;
immediate concern—Dao complete, spirit whole.
Clear as jade fragments,
luminous as autumn frost.
Still and empty, unadorned,
ancient and solid, pure and tranquil.
The sounds of Zheng and Wei gallop,
yet hearing is not confused by the ears.
The colors of splendor flash,
yet sight is not disturbed in the heart.
Swimming in water, treading fire,
returning unharmed.
Bearing emptiness, touching reality,
exchanging without peril.
A thousand changes, ten thousand transformations,
without end—
what is this?
It is the guarding of pure qi and essence yang.
Before this, the will is clear and resolute,
abiding in non-action,
cutting off sorrow,
eliminating thoughts,
forgetting attachments,
removing self and other.
Embrace spirit, guard the One,
pure and unadulterated,
silently facing the Emperor of Images—
this is the natural Dao of long life.

**Eulogy:**
The Dao’s age flourishes with virtue,
heaven is mysterious, earth is yellow.
Sun and moon surge with clarity,
stars and constellations radiate light.
Misty vapors fly in seal script,
primal essence inclines toward yang.
The myriad beings commune with the mysterious,
the thousand spirits resonate with auspices.
Spirit transforms mercury to white,
essence transmutes lead to frost.
Jade springs tinkle,
golden waters chime.
The three qi stream with rosy clouds,
the five clouds bear cinnabar blossoms.
Emerald subtlety’s immortal perfected,
azure void’s stellar sovereign.

**Inscription on the Primordial Dark-Yang Cavern Spirit**

Before the Dragon Han and Crimson Clarity epochs, in the vast expanse of the Dark Ford’s Great Brahmā, all was boundless and lightless—profoundly obscure, utterly silent, its nature unknown. Then, true essence stirred and aroused, primordial qi flowed and circulated, heaven and earth took form, and the myriad beings came into existence.

Yet among the myriad beings, only humans are noble: cultivate the Way, and they ascend; lose it, and they fall. If one can turn the gaze inward to return to the origin, embody the One to enter wondrous perfection, abide in softness and dwell in emptiness, conceal traces and hide radiance—then their Dao is called victorious, their virtue flourishing.

To discriminate is to invite manifold disgrace; to illuminate is to invite manifold obstruction. To grasp is to invite manifold loss; to preserve is to invite manifold dissolution. Only one who knows advance and retreat, waxing and waning, and never strays from the true center of heaven and earth—how could fortune or misfortune, benefit or harm, ever bring them to ruin?

Such virtue cannot be clarified by settling, nor muddied by stirring—it is wondrous and non-doing. It cannot be adorned to gain glory, nor defiled to suffer shame—it is mysterious and spontaneous.

Vast and obscure! Within it lies essence.
Flickering and indistinct! Within it lies truth.
Formless form,
objectless image.
It encompasses the Great Ultimate,
embraces the six directions.
Dwelling at the edge yet abiding in wonder,
detached from things yet preserving the real.

Its principle is constant, yet seen differently by the vulgar.
Its Dao is universal, yet embodied, it transforms customs.
To be deluded by it is to lose the real and encounter illusion—illusion like waves in a coffer, sinking and floating, drowning and drifting, swept away by the great river’s current. To awaken to it is to shed the husk and nurture essence, spirit-light shining within, emptiness pure and flawless—clouds recede, the sky gleams; mist disperses, the sun shines. The radiance of the Great Clarity is revealed, the supreme real unveiled in leisure.

Primal virtue governs all; the Dao obstructs nothing.
Communing with spirits, the images shift;
the constellations align with their signs.
In serene and wondrous transformation,
one ascends the ladder of mystery to the Jade Dawn Palace.

**Eulogy:**
The wondrous Dao knows no bounds,
merged with the primordial ridge.

Waters surge into the cinnabar pool, billowing through the cloud chambers.
Divine tones ring clear, celestial melodies resonant and bright.
Flowing essence gleams like gold, soaring spirit radiates jade light.
Mystic yellow and auspicious mist, empty white and felicitous signs.
Substance bears yin, majestic gaze embraces yang.
Nine-hued radiance shimmers in the rosy clouds, the One Real blazes in splendor.
A single star knots the dense canopy, the Jade Empyrean soars aloft.

**Inscription on the Subtle Principles of the Supreme Clarity’s Mysterious Transformation**
The Great Dao emerges before the Supreme Ultimate,
the supreme virtue transforms at heaven and earth’s inception.
Vast and formless, sunk in silence without light.
Dim and indistinct, yet suddenly there is being.
This being is no ordinary being—it is called the utmost essence.
The utmost essence has no image; images arise from mysterious clarity.
Forget its form, enter its body—emptiness contains emptiness.
Forget its vastness, augment the primal—qi contains qi.
Forget its mind, shine forth in clarity—spirit contains spirit.
This spirit resembles a suspended pearl.
The pearl has no form or substance, yet responds without fail to all.
In water, it mirrors water;
in fire, it mirrors fire;
in metal and stone, it mirrors metal and stone;
in emptiness and nothingness, it mirrors emptiness and nothingness.
Above, it peers into the azure sky—gazing upward, it grows ever higher.
Below, it plunges into the yellow springs—delving deeper, it grows ever more firm.
It courses through the eight directions, vast and boundless without corners.
In heaven it forms images, on earth it forms shapes.
The Great Void is vast and desolate, yet within it dwells spirit.
The spirit’s mechanism operates transformations, responding without fail to all.
Accord with its form, form transforms into qi;
accord with its qi, qi transforms into spirit;
accord with its spirit, spirit transforms into emptiness;
accord with its emptiness, emptiness transforms into the Dao.
The Dao accords with the round image, the image like a stellar pattern.
The stellar pattern follows accord, accord with the primal origin of the Great Beginning.
Predating heaven’s transformations, this is called the carefree adept,
the achievement of one whose name endures.

**Eulogy:**
The Supreme Clarity’s mysterious realm,
principles still and depths profound.
Primal spirit ascends and descends,
images of the Lord float and sink.
Inaugurating heaven and earth,
its movement shifts through ancient and modern.
The fiery mound’s phoenix calls,
the water valley’s dragon intones.
The Maitreya’s celestial chant,
piercing through the divine tones.
Sunlight gilds the cinnabar cassia,
moonlight illumines the jade grove.
Wondrous omens flourish,
mysterious auspices fill the peaks.
Emerging from the mixed and myriad,
pure and steadfast in heart.
Transcending beyond images,
cutting off wisdom to draw reverence.

**Inscription on the Light of the Myriad Brahmā Heavens of the Great Emptiness**
The Dao that may seem absent,
when invoked, is not absent.
The virtue that may seem present,
when perceived, is not present.
Silent and empty, pure and ever clear.
The valley spirit emerges transformed,
once gone, once come—pushing the sun and moon’s ascent and descent.
The primal qi flows and circulates,
once up, once down—following heaven and earth’s floating and sinking.
Alternating yin and yang,
and beings are born.
Shifting cold and heat,
and the years are completed.
Fourfold openness, fivefold harmony,
ninefold harmony, tenfold unity.
Expounded and clarified,
the real does not depart from the illusory.
Obscured and dimmed,
the illusory does not depart from the real.
Delusion and awakening share the same path,
all return to the essential.
Immortals and mortals tread different roads,
each attains its mystery.
Turning from enlightenment to join the dust,
the wandering soul encounters illusion.
Aiding the upright and dispelling evil,
the chambered soul returns to ascend the stars.
Sound that is no sound,
the great tone does not disturb the true person’s ear.
Color that is color,
brilliance does not stir the ignorant heart.
Losing the constant principle,
seeing yet not seeing—one first falls into stubborn emptiness.
Grasping the Dao’s mechanism,
knowing yet not knowing—one ultimately returns to true form.
Great perfection seems flawed,
its abundant wisdom’s source does not display.
Great whiteness seems tarnished,
it conceals its light and does not shine.
Embrace its origin, conceal its emptiness,
oversee its essence, unfold its thusness.
Order and govern it, surely and aptly,
forgetting the Three-in-One, merging within without division.
Images emerge from pre-heaven,
the Dao is thus illuminated.

**Eulogy:**
The Great Void vast and distant,
all that is moved returns to it.
Heaven’s truth has its time,
impartial and without favor.
Clear and round like the jade balance,
resonant and roaming like the turning pearl.
Modeled on forms and appearances,
its images suit their objects.
Empty yet not full,
restrained yet not diminished.
Serene and cool,
mysterious and wondrous.
Supreme Clarity’s radiant splendor,
the Central Heaven’s Purple Tenuity.
Spirit enfolds utmost essence,
stellar visage gleams resplendent.

*End of the Third Scroll of the Supreme Clarity’s Great Mystery Collection*
*Beginning of the Fourth Scroll of the Supreme Clarity’s Great Mystery Collection*

**Lord Guanshe Shanyuan’s Inscription on the Golden Radiance and Jade Countenance of the Grand Beginning**

The noble person establishes conduct and practices the Dao, revering state laws and devoutly upholding the Mysterious Truth. They eradicate cravings and desires, casting aside the clamor of worldly dust. Through accumulated merit, they succor orphans and care for widows; through layered deeds, they cherish the aged and pity the poor. They look up to the virtuous without slackening, and lift the stubborn and indolent without arrogance. Harmony above and concord below—establishing virtue with compassion as its root. Inner rectitude and outward integrity—the Supreme Dao takes purity and stillness as its gate. When affairs are many, the heart finds no inner ease; when thoughts are severed, the mind does not wander outward. To halt excess and guard against loss, one must discern the moment for advance and retreat. Dwelling in peace, one contemplates peril, thereby distinguishing the principles of survival and ruin. Being and non-being mutually aid each other; movement and stillness share a single source. Stillness is called the Dao; movement is called the spirit. Silent yet responsive, moved yet without intent. Penetrating the primordial to replenish qi, fathoming the profound and luminous. Gathering the radiant yang soul in pure brilliance, transforming the yin po to reveal celestial truth. Stars congeal in mysterious illumination, the Dao releases its blossoming fragrance. Delving into the ultimate principle, one may die at dusk after hearing it at dawn. Thus, there is death yet no perishing—why envy Qi’s three sublime attainments? Not that there is no long life and enduring vision, but one does not scheme for Lin Lei’s century of years. Why not reflect: having form entails suffering, and one ultimately falls into the abyss of emptiness; only without appearance and form does one transcend beyond images. Diligently guard and cultivate merit—once merit is achieved and fame attained, shedding the mortal frame to ascend as an immortal is scarcely difficult.

**Eulogy:**
The Supreme Ultimate soars vast and distant,
its abyssal depths profoundly mysterious.
One qi waxes and wanes,
and the myriad things are born.
A numinous breeze, elegant and fair,
a luminous moon, resplendent and bright.
Mountains conceal jade treasures,
grasses split to reveal golden ornaments.
Nourishing an entire realm,
moistening and fostering a hundred streams.
Without intent, all is wondrous;
with desire, one approaches the brink.
Deluded, one becomes a ghost;
awakened, one ascends as an immortal.
Emerging from the boundless,
its image precedes heaven.

**Inscription on the Pure Heart of the Grand Abyss’ Celestial Boundary**

The Dao is silent yet unceasing,
responding and transforming without fixed form.
Virtue is manifest yet not forceful,
adapting to change with proper place.
Establishing images reveals the principles of sun, moon, heaven, and earth;
stabilizing hexagrams embodies the mechanisms of yin-yang, closure, and openness.
The fullness within *Kan*:
in heaven, it is the moon;
in humans, it is the ear.
The ear can perceive the sounds of thunder, wind, and rain—
this is called hearing and knowing, the mark of sageliness.
The emptiness within *Li*:
in heaven, it is the sun;
in humans, it is the eye.
The eye can discern the beauty of mountains, marshes, and waters—
this is called seeing and knowing, the mark of spirit.
Looking up, one models oneself on heaven;
looking down, one models oneself on earth.
In profound stillness, one observes images in transformation;
through transformation, one fathoms the causes of darkness and light.
Tracing beginnings and returning to endings,
one thus understands the discourse on life and death.
The *Book of Changes* says: "Probe the obscure and seek the hidden,
hook forth the deep and reach the distant."
The distant cannot be exhausted,
the near cannot be measured.
Vast and dim, none can know
why it is so, yet so it is.
To diminish or expend it
does not lose its essence.
To trust and uphold it
does not reveal its form.
Heaven endures, earth persists—
who can claim merit for high ascent?
Those who uphold the Dao
yet lack steadfast resolve,
turning back midway—
this is what it means.

**Eulogy:**
Embracing the divine splendor of the horizontal,
emerald shadows on jade peaks.

The toad’s radiance emerges in restraint, the sun’s glow sinks in the west.
The Dao illumines the mysterious realm, virtue aligns with the celestial pivot.
Clouds bathe in snowy purity, primordial qi purifies the heart.
Drought-spirits descend, all sages arrive in unison.
Girded with gold, adorned with jade, treasured auspices fill their hairpins.
Light trails like white feathers, tones arise from cold jasper.
Gently striking the jade chime, the clear sound is raised again.

**Inscription of the Jade Dawn of Supreme Clarity:**
The Terrace of Supreme Clarity—nothing is born without transformation.
The Illuminated Sovereign of Images—no darkness remains unlit.
The Two Spirits enfold purity, resplendent before sun and moon.
The One Qi waxes and wanes, blending beyond heaven and earth.
Mystery upon mystery—tracing its traces is endless.
Wonder within wonder—profound thought cannot fathom it.
Hui Shi could debate, yet his words failed to capture its form.
Duanmu could speak, yet his speech could not open its gate.
Li Lou excelled in sight; though he widened his eyes in daylight,
blinking to gaze, he could not perceive its shape.
Shi Kuang excelled in hearing; though he turned his head at night,
listening intently, he could not catch its sound.
To surpass the elite, rise above the crowd,
is to be first among things—yet never fully grasp its principle.
To forget one’s qi, to refine the spirit,
is to perfect the discipline of the Dao, merging with the Great Beginning—
yet never exhaust its mechanism.
Thus, jade-refined and gold-visaged, pure truth flourishes.
Precious patterns in jade caskets dissolve impure substance.
Sea spirits congeal in splendor, images emerge in cinnabar radiance.
The Three-in-One blends seamlessly, essence flows through celestial secrets.
Within, it harmonizes with star-hung jeweled banquets—
the realm before the unbegun.

**Eulogy:**
The Dao of Supreme Clarity—pure, true, and steadfast.
Heaven’s winds are lofty and unsullied, the sea’s moon is clear and solitary.
Ascending the empyrean, traces vanish; bending near, all plans are forgotten.
Jade ridges rise steep, pools gleam with lustrous virtue.
Mysterious essence shines like jade, wondrous substance is numinous and boundless.
Luminous splendor roams freely, auspicious qi forms propitious signs.
The Primal blends in splendor, cinnabar images stream like pearls.
Within, starry hues are contained, roaming the divine capital.

**Inscription on the Celestial Round Image Uniting with the Spirit:**
The Dao—silent, without sound; vast, without color.
From ancient times it spans to the present, standing alone and unchanging.
Formless form—approaching, one does not see its front.
Imageless image—following, one does not see its rear.
Spoken of as vast, it encompasses heaven and earth, yet this is not its greatness.
Called subtle, it pierces grains of sand, yet this is not its smallness.
Tracing its traces knows no method; pursuing it, it grows ever more distant.
Profound thought stirs a response; measuring it, it grows ever nearer.
Obscure as twilight, listening within, one’s hearing sharpens.
Dim and distant, it conceals the utmost essence.
Brilliant and solitary, one sees clearly without—
elusive and indistinct, it moves through the utmost spirit.
The spiritual source is one, guiding transformation in three accomplishments:
First, it seizes the qi of yin and yang;
second, it illumines the essence of sun and moon;
third, it draws forth the splendor of heaven and earth.
Those who cultivate it through refinement reach fruition in a thousand days.
Blending with it, one becomes enlightened through the Image-Web.
The Image-Web penetrates the mysterious, piercing metal and stone.
Swimming through water, treading fire, walking blades, crossing peril—
myriad transformations, endless in number.
Encountering things without fear—what is this called?
It is the steadfast guarding of pure qi.
Those who achieve this are called cultivators of true virtue,
adepts of divine and sagely attainment.

**Eulogy:**
Within, it harmonizes with the distant and obscure;
without, it connects with celestial radiance.
The Dao is this One and None—
virtue, these Three Reflections.
Mysterious images manifest brightness, the subtle mind shines at the solstice.
The Four Qi gleam in clarity, the Five Spirits rest in emptiness.
Crowned with flowered canopies, their forms ride cloud-borne chariots.
Beyond heaven, winds are pure; in the heart of the pool, the moon is cool.
Vast as twilight, silent as a flame—
hidden and manifest, distinct and clear.
Wondrous! Auspicious and blessed.

**Inscription on the Precious Flourishing Star of the Great Mystery:**
The Primal One imparts teachings—no response is unanswered.
The Dao and virtue open the origin—nothing is left unborn.
The Great Void stretches boundless and without limit;
heaven and earth loom vast and with form.
Qian and Kun embrace transformation, the ten thousand things flow into shape.
Yin and yang receive qi, alternating in mutual dependence.
Those who receive transformation are not limited to one life;
those who contain embryos are not confined to one form.
In heaven, images descend—auspicious and ominous omens appear.
On earth, forms take shape—the principles of being and nonbeing are discerned.
In humans, changes occur—the mechanisms of movement and stillness are revealed.
Buddhist disciples call it the Buddha;
Confucian scholars, the Sage;
Daoist adepts, the Immortal.
Different paths, one source—the Dao is singular.
Thus, celestial spirits and earthly deities,
divine luminaries and sovereign lords,
sun, moon, and stars,
immortals, perfected beings, and supreme sages,
jade maidens and golden youths,
officials, generals, and marshals,
ancient buddhas and arhats,
the Eight Divisions of Heavenly Dragons,
the Four Kindnesses and Three Realms,
mountains, rivers, and great marshes,
the Yangtze, Huai, and Ji rivers,
pearls, jade, gold, and stone,
mystery and yellow, sweet and bitter—
even those born from wombs, eggs, moisture, or transformation,
those with form or without,
with appearance or without,
with transformation or without,
neither transforming nor not transforming—
all who revere the One are revering the supreme Dao.
Those who transform and unite with it are the spirit of the Infinite.
This spirit—below, it becomes ghosts;
in the middle, humans;
above, stars.
Stars dissolve without form, returning to the era before the Great Simplicity.
Before heaven, without ancestry—
yet uniting with it is called the origin of the supreme Dao.

**Eulogy:**
Profound and pure, the celestial truth is subtle and hidden.
Confucian, Buddhist, and Daoist winds—heaven, earth, and humans all embrace them.
Divided into three, they wondrously return to the essence of the One.
Grasping being, rooted in nonbeing—embodying emptiness as if substantial.
Forms dissolve, clarity and hearing unite;
wisdom connects with the numinous substance.
The spirit roams the corners of the sea, the soul soars through celestial realms.
Embracing jade-like radiance in intoxication, sleeping on clouds beneath the sun.
Nine-colored stellar vapors—all dharmas are complete.

**Inscription on the Vast Obscurity and Luminous Tranquility of the Primal Spirit:**
The Dao is the substance of emptiness and nonbeing.
Virtue is the function of spirit and transformation.
Substance and function require each other—
this is called the Great Communication.
The Great Communication lies in the principles of true qi and spirit.
This qi is light, clear, simple, and wondrous.

Its essence is unbounded and soaring.
Its spirit is vast and profoundly deep.
In silence, it dims into obscurity yet intent remains;
in illumination, it blazes radiantly yet the heart is forgotten.
In subtle completion, it unfolds the dark and yellow hues of heaven and earth;
in upright transformation, it reveals the mechanisms of yin-yang’s block and flow.
Elusively it follows the rise and fall of wind and clouds,
mightily it traverses the waves of rivers and seas.
Congealed, it veils the beauty of mountains and rivers;
lushly it embraces the flourishing of grasses and trees.
Resplendent, it emits the brilliance of gold and jade;
abundant, it stirs the transformations of fish and dragons.
Thus, it colors without dye,
shapes without carving,
speeds without haste,
achieves without acting.
No can and no cannot,
no ability and no inability.
Mysterious beyond mystery,
wondrous in its very wonder.
The spirit roams the islet’s essence,
penetrating the boundless expanse.

**Inscription:**
The supreme vehicle of the Dao, transmitted by ancestral sages—
without clinging to forms, what need for names and words?
The use of the useless,
the spontaneous arising.
The two spirits initiate the wondrous,
the one qi communicates the profound.
Dragons soar the azure heavens,
phoenixes wing the cinnabar skies.
Luminous radiance illumines the jeweled realm,
light shines upon the field of sacred mushrooms.
Upright and firm, pure and unalloyed—
prior to the beginning, before the Emperor of Images.

**Inscription on Ascending the Celestial Constellation in the Jade Clarity of the Mysterious Above:**
The Dao illumines the mysterious vision, beginning before the primordial.
The Emperor of Images emerges from myriad Brahmās,
initiating qi to govern the Three Origins.
Heaven and earth become limpid,
sun and moon grow bright.
Its essence shines boundlessly,
subtly wondrous and profoundly connected.
It cherishes beings and benefits life,
harmonious yet not excessive.
In sudden enlightenment, it becomes effortlessly divine;
in intuitive insight, it attains the formless form.
Aspiration congeals in the cosmos,
merging into the Central Origin.
The empty chamber generates whiteness—
this is the omen of auspiciousness.
Its Dao, still, generates spirit;
its spirit, moved, communicates with the Dao.
Neither seen nor heard,
it manifests in celestial portents,
enriching the divine and sagely without limit.
Neither moving nor still,
in the clarity of emptiness,
it bestows the responsive grace of the Numinous Treasure.
Silent and desolate, it conceals within all functions.
Vague and indistinct, it reveals to all benevolence.
Wondrous indeed is the mysterious Dao,
supreme virtue and divine power—
vastly unfolding, it follows the origin of stellar brilliance.

**Inscription:**
In the Jade Clarity of the Mysterious Above,
the Primal Unity ascends the celestial constellation.
Chaos darkens the ford,
the Primordial Crimson Script.
The Cinnabar Sovereign rides in splendor,
the Numinous Treasure flourishes in purity.
Spirit congeals in the cosmos,
the mysterious shines upon the celestial winds.
Yellow blossoms flow in purity,
essence gleams in the jade register.
Forgetting form to accord with images,
harmonizing with the Dao to generate spirit.
Intermingled light blazes resplendently,
luminous and pure as jade’s brilliance.
The Central Origin’s wondrous image—
this is called the Mysterious Real.

**Eulogy:**
In former years, my heart-source was dimmed and closed;
today, my Dao-eye opens clearly.
Joyfully I see the azure sky like a jade table—
the twin wheels have ground apart the white clouds’ heap.

**Inscription on the Roaming of the Primal Spirit in the Supreme Mystery:**
To enter the Dao and cultivate the real,
revere the Three Treasures,
honor the two parents,
abandon jealousy and arrogance,
dissolve greed and timidity.
Encounter the Three Teachings without fostering division,
meet the Four Assemblies to forge good affinity.
All sentient beings receiving transformation
are like parents—reverence and sincerity.
In communal dwelling, be humble and cautious in speech;
in solitude, advance wisdom and guard the heart.
Walk with measured steps,
speak in a low voice.
See as if not seeing,
gazing upon the great image’s formlessness—
formlessness is called the Dao flourishing in utmost clarity,
this is the wondrous principle of communicating with spirit.
Hear as if not hearing,
listening to the great sound’s rare tone—
the rare tone is called virtue.
In clarity, utmost acuity—
this is the mysterious mechanism of entering sageliness.
Internally, all is harmonious and fused,
flesh and bone as one,
pure essence without image,
lustrous as pristine frost.
Externally, forget form and flow in purity,
merge qi and incline toward yang,
vastly empty and still,
pure as celestial light.
Thus, internal and external unite,
circulating through the six directions,
easily encountering the profound mystery,
achieving the beauty of beauty.
Li Shifang, forgetting water and moon, ascends the real.
Lie Yukou, mastering the numinous wind, enters sageliness.
The Dao is not far from humanity—
humanity distances itself from the Dao.
Alas! The scions of noble houses,
many are deluded by wine and sensuality,
wholly infatuated with fame and fortune—
losing the root-source of the wondrous Dao,
they fall into the evil destinies of suffering.
If they would turn their heads to reflect,
purify their hearts like cold ashes,
receive the supreme Dao,
trace their steps back to the origin,
they would ascend the celestial constellation and shed their forms,
rising into the wondrous realm.

**Inscription:**
Embracing the Dao and cherishing virtue,
excellence and beauty beyond compare.
The precious mirror within the mysterious,
the luminous pearl within the eyelash.
Expel poisonous miasmas,
eradicate sharp arrogance and boasting.
Preserve the real and release the false,
uphold the upright and dispel the perverse.
The furnace glows with phoenix radiance,
the cauldron smelts dragon sands.
The Southern Aster shines resplendently,
the Northern Emperor flows with rosy clouds.
The spirit roams the celestial weave,
the stars traverse the Central Flower.
The Jade Capital and Golden Gates—
the abode of the Primordial Beginning.

**Inscription on the Supreme Simplicity Generating Spirit and Transforming Images:**
The Dao is mysterious, virtue is wondrous—
the whole spirit meets the numinous.
Floating and sinking through heaven and earth,
ascending and descending through yin and yang.
Governing the creation of the Three Powers,
uniting the production of the Four Seasons.
Communicating with the origin to benefit qi,
merging beings to flow essence.
Applied, mountains and rivers grow resplendent;
moved, sun and moon grow bright.
Shining yet not dazzling,
silently accordant with the true source.
Acting yet not relying,
carving and shaping all forms.
Form and spirit both wondrous,
each attains its real.
Nurturing spirit with the five qi—
these qi are azure, cinnabar, green, white, and black.
Nurturing form with the five flavors—
these flavors are sour, bitter, sweet, pungent, and salty.
Flavor without flavor—
this is called true flavor.
Color without color—
this is called true color.
Sound without sound—
this is called true sound.
Great without incompleteness,
subtle without failure to respond.
Responding to heaven is called clarity,
responding to earth is called tranquility.
Responding to mountains is called elegance,
responding to water is called coolness.
Responding to emptiness and whiteness is transformation,
responding to beings is called life.
Responding to form is called substance,
responding to images is called stars.
Stars hang high and pure,
positioned in the resplendent clarity.
The mysterious and green endure in vision,
treasured blessings extend life.

The host of perfected beings enjoy their blessings,
all owing to the wind of the Most High.

In praise:
Following the movement of heaven’s Dao,
it transforms and harmonizes human relations.
Majestic and manifesting virtue,
radiant and embracing truth.
In serene subtlety, wondrous principle converges,
gathering essence and unifying spirit.
Clear and congealed, the treasured talismans,
wisdom connects with the misty vapors.
The primal numinous treasure shines,
its refined substance resplendent.
The hundred clans in daily use,
the myriad things transform in purity.
The sun’s countenance shines bright,
the spirit’s visage is serene and spacious.
The cloud-cloaked feathered scholar,
the Perfected One of the Dark Valley.

*Inscription on the Precious Mirror of the Great Void’s Containing Spirit*

Now, to establish virtue and cultivate benevolence,
to illuminate the practice of the Dao and its teachings,
to accumulate spiritual merit in quiet intervals,
to settle the mind and halt thoughts,
to still concerns and forget schemes—
conceal brilliance as jade hidden within stone,
obscure traces like clams parted from their pearls.
With eyes like mugwort and a heart like tumbleweed,
many are deluded by semblances of dharma.
Yet with the eye of wisdom and the wellspring of spirit,
one broadly attains the unborn.
Embodying heaven, one practices the Dao,
following the sun and moon in their lofty course.
Emulating earth’s patterns,
one employs the turning pivot of the celestial sphere.
The three palaces wondrously open,
the six caves mysteriously illumine.
Discerning the principles of floating and sinking in being and non-being,
examining the mechanisms of ascent and descent in movement and stillness.
The golden crucible’s fire blazes, advancing the yang radiance,
pervading the body of the Dao.
The jade cauldron’s broth boils, frothing like snowflakes,
nourishing and benefiting the spirit’s flesh.
Vacuous and white, resplendent and fair,
soft and weak, floating and light—
entering water, one does not drown;
treading fire, one does not scorch.
Roaming the great expanse,
passing through mountains and marshes without stumbling.
Embodying perfect clarity,
crossing clouds and mist without hindering one’s gaze.
Beyond the five phases,
before the ten thousand dharmas.
Near and far, intimate and distant,
left and right, one encounters the primal.
The primal division has no beginning,
gazing, one does not see its form.
The Dao attains mysterious essence,
listening, one does not hear its sound.
Neither non-being nor being,
in a single day or ten thousand ages, it does not decay.
Unmoving and unshaken,
it abides in quiescent unity, enduring forever.
Opening and entering it,
no thing remains unordered.
Extending and practicing it,
the Dao is nowhere obstructed.
Communicating with the primal and augmenting qi,
qi augments essence,
essence augments images,
images augment stars.
The stars’ splendor shines brilliantly,
roaming and soaring in the Great Clarity.
Subtle and without superior,
this is called perfect completion.

In praise:
The Great Dao is formless,
ever dwelling in profound obscurity.
At first, the one qi divides,
its pattern received in threefold completion.
Heaven and earth luxuriantly flourish,
the sun and moon brilliantly refine essence.
Spirits intermingle in magnificent radiance,
things shine in perfect clarity.
Yang radiance gathers in the crucible,
yin substance departs from form.
Serene and subtly wondrous,
moved, it communicates with the numinous.
Pure and immaculate,
primal, prosperous, advantageous, and steadfast.
Firm and strong, centered and upright,
soft and yielding, light and clear.
Ascending the mysterious to enter sageliness,
the jade heavens’ luminous stars.

*Inscription on the Gathering Treasure of the Great Mystery of the Upper Clarity*

The *Yin Convergence Scripture* states: "The mechanism lies in the eye."
The Yellow Emperor said: "I do not know that the mechanism lies in the eye."
What does this mean?

The Heavenly Perfected One of the Celestial Truth said: "The Dao that is distant lies beyond the eight wilds, yet the Dao that is near lies between the brows and lashes. Vast, it encompasses heaven and earth; minute, it penetrates the finest hair. Guangchengzi said: 'The spirit’s mechanism moves within, the eyelashes fly like lead.' Thus, the spirit’s mechanism lies in the eye. When the eye’s spirit-light stirs, it resides in the eye. The secret mechanism of the nine heavens emerges from the mechanism before one’s eyes—this mechanism is the transformation of stirring movement. Summoning yang and calling forth yin, grasping the origin’s authority, emerging from clarity and entering the mysterious—thus, the two great corners of the eyes are called the brows. The green cavity ascends, connecting to the mud pill, descending to the two kidneys, which are the gates of mao and you. Kangcangzi said: 'My body harmonizes with the heart, the heart harmonizes with qi, qi harmonizes with spirit, spirit harmonizes with non-being.' There is the sound of *jieran*, the tone of *weiran*. Though distant beyond the eight wilds or near between the brows and lashes, whatever comes to me, I must know it. Yet this is not the awareness of my seven apertures and four limbs, nor the knowledge of my heart, abdomen, and six viscera—it is self-knowing alone."

Liezi said: "Spirit pertains to heaven’s portion, bones and frame to earth’s portion. What belongs to heaven is clear and disperses; what belongs to earth is turbid and gathers. When spirit departs from form, each returns to its truth—this is called *gui*. *Gui* means 'return,' returning to its true dwelling. The true dwelling is the realm of the Great Void."

The Yellow Emperor said: "When spirit enters its gate and bones return to their root, what remains of me?"
The Most High said: "The Dao is empty yet employed, never filling. Profound, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things. Blunting its sharpness, unraveling its tangles, harmonizing its light, merging with its dust. Vast and deep, it seems to abide—yet I know not whose child it is, as it appears before the Lord of Heaven."

Master Lü said: "Gently warming the lead crucible, light penetrates the curtain."
Xu Shenweng’s commentary: "The gentle warmth is the human body. At the initial union of the lead crucible, the spirit-light overflows—closing the eyes, one sees the curtain."
The eye is the eye itself.
Thus, the Master of Pointing to the Mysterious said: "Concentrating spirit in the grotto palace, closing the eyes and lowering the curtain."
The workings of creation contend in haste—this speaks of humans employing spiritual merit to vie with creation, which is the spirit’s use by humans.

Master Haichan’s ode says:
Gently warming the lead crucible into the middle origin,
releasing the three lights to nurture auspicious lotuses.
When the lotus naturally attains the method of sagehood,
step by step, the spirit-light is before the eyes.

Song Qiqiu said: "What the eye does not see, set up a bright mirror to reflect it; what the ear does not hear, set up empty qi to perceive it. Spirit is within me, seeing and hearing are yonder."
He also said: "The bell in the ear, I myself hear it; the flower in the eye, I myself see it. My day and night are its day and night. Thus, day cannot be called bright, nor night called dark. Only the great person can equalize darkness and light."
He also said: "Water, when utterly clear, congeals into ice that is not clear; spirit, when utterly bright, forms a body that is not bright. When ice melts, it returns to clarity; when form disperses, it returns to brightness. One who knows this death can roam the capital of the Most High."

**Seven-Character Quatrains**

At Kunlun’s peak, the fire-dragon soars asunder,
The jeweled banquet’s celestial radiance illumines the Purple Tenuity.
A single grain of numinous cinnabar fuses in splendor—
Only then does one know the Dao’s power wields divine might.

The Jasper Pool’s feast stirs strife, the sun yields its solitude,
Its light shatters the dusty world—nothing remains.
In the vastness of silent emptiness, who is my companion?
The crystal curtain reflects the night-shining pearl.

Golden brilliance, resplendent, auspicious clouds drift,
Luminous and immaculate, flawless as jade.
The two spirits of purity and simplicity merge as one image—
Such is the wondrous skill of the Azure Micro immortal.

A drop of crimson dew bathes the hibiscus,
Nourishing the numinous sprout to emerge anew.
The tender bud unfolds, smiling in the sun’s glow,
Presenting you with a branch of spring in return.

The marvelous and the putrid are but empty names,
In this troubled world, floating and drifting, honor and disgrace startle.
How much better to shed the mortal coil and return to the unbegun,
Than to be bound by the vulgar gaze that scorns the transcendent.

The three-foot dragon-spring sword rings in the night,
Severing evil, slaying demons, it commands numinous efficacy.
Its radiance untainted by the black serpent’s blood,
It soars to the Jasper Heavens, transformed into jade essence.

The two qi converge in the palace, guarding the true yang,
Yang’s light, jewel-bright, advances the mysterious frost.
Giving birth to heaven, giving birth to earth, returning to the primal ancestor,
Alone in the vastness, it mirrors the realm of the Celestial Emperor.

In the silent, empty hall, the door stands half-ajar,
The spirit-light meanders within, distinctly clear.
Though the moon sinks into the Pool of Sun’s Mouth,
A few stars still gleam in the wintry grove.

A blazing sun rises through the sparse woods,
Its luminous qi fills the eyes, joyfully explored.
Awakening to the great completeness, the Dao is lucidly known,
The image of mystery takes flight to the azure heart of heaven.

Without, the armored dragon embraces the Water Palace,
Within, the metal tiger is driven into the Palace of Flame.
Refined into a single substance, purely essence,
It follows the primordial wind of the Celestial Origin.

Sitting beyond the loom of fate, ten thousand cares forgotten,
Within, the heart settles, instantly cooled and clarified.
Yang congeals, substance solidifies, yin vanishes—
Unawares, the spirit roams the Northern Emperor’s realm.

The resolute man’s will is firm and unyielding,
Ready to ascend as an immortal, he answers the celestial examination.
He grasps Mount Zou, shatters Kunlun’s peak,
Scattering the radiant mystery-pearl to merge with the Jade Yang.

With an empty heart, the mind at ease, he awakens to the subtle and serene,
There is yet a higher mechanism of the Mysterious Origin.
Raindrops of the Valley Spirit fly to the Moon Palace,
A sky of starry splendor moistens the lingzhi brows.

Lead and mercury in the golden crucible, auspicious clouds drift,
Refined to perfection, it shines like a luminous sea-pearl.
A single gleaming grain penetrates the dharma-realm,
The nine heavens’ light scatters into the pure void.

The blue dragon and white tiger mate in the crimson furnace,
The Mysterious Female and cinnabar phoenix freely inhale and exhale.
Flaming brilliance of the samadhi fire,
Lucidly illuminating the old paths of darkness.

The two spirits merge in radiance at the center,
Each drop, cool and clear, blends into the Jade Yang.
The mysterious image, resplendent, veils the Jasper Gate,
The Jade Tower’s deep chambers are locked within azure cloud-chambers.

Leisurely riding a white deer to the Jasper Pool,
Awaiting entry to the Moon Palace to pluck the cassia branch.

The Great Brahma, towering, is but an image,
Yet it shifts the stars’ radiance to moisten the lingzhi brows.
The Treasure-Essence Youth plucks the moonflower,
Flames advance, the flying soul releases purple auroras.

Reversing the current beyond the Milky Way,
No need for misty waves to cradle the numinous elixir.
The virtuous elder’s demeanor is foolish,
Within, bloodless, his flesh becomes ice.
Serenely awakened, he returns to the primal image,
Ascending to the Central Heaven to pay homage at the Purple Tenuity.

Brahma-qi lightly drifts, merging with the Emperor’s origin,
The cinnabar’s light, resplendent, shines through the mystery.
The Jade Dawn requires no thatched-hut effort,
Instantly, the empty hurricane grasps the plain sky.

Vast and boundless, the ten thousand images arise anew,
The Celestial Origin’s single qi blends with the pure void.
The Mysterious Yang’s universal sovereign contains the numinous essence,
All transforms without remainder into five-colored pearls.

Black mercury and red lead transmute into jade essence,
Moistening the brows with golden splendor, illuminating the mysterious essence.
In the wintry grove, the sacred cassia and numinous cinnabar congeal,
Rough jade scatters, scattering auspicious stars.

Grasping firmly, preserving the spirit, entering the wondrous mechanism,
A man’s single-minded resolve never wavers.
Refining the Celestial Crucible, the heart-pearl bursts forth,
The snow-capped youth treads the Jade Stream.

Black waters and crimson auroras illuminate the azure sky,
The blue dragon and white tiger enter the abyss of perception.
They swallow the sea-bottom’s numinous turtle marrow,
Advancing the armor-clad black pearl, round and gleaming.

The arrayed tripods’ souls wander, merging with the Great Azure,
The azure vault crackles, flames soaring.
The Three Origins are securely sealed, returning to the Qian image,
The vast secret, boundless, enters the great square.

Auspicious qi and propitious clouds fill the eyes,
A sky of true refinement transforms the cinnabar infant.
The numinous wind does not follow the willow floss away,
It flies into the Palace of Flame to accompany the morning star.

Emerging from the Yang Pass, he travels the old road,
Listening freely, gazing in all directions.
The essence-jewel is not made to occupy mud and dust,
It pierces the long sky, a single point of clarity.

The primordial current of chaos, Brahma-qi ascends,
The sun of celestial wisdom shines most distinctly.
In stillness, a single mirror—by whose power?
The mysterious pearl descends, dazzling the Great Clarity.

Heavenly wind and sea-sun radiate in splendor,
Above and below, molten gold scatters jewel-crystals.
Knocking on the Dao, vast and luminous,
Shifting the spirit’s radiance, the eyes awaken.

Brahma-qi circulates, blending the hundred rivers,
A single glance from the majestic eyes ripples the numinous mist.
Pillowing on cloudy mountains, dreaming the Huaxu dream,
Not desiring to slumber in the Chang’an marketplace.

The red sun half-embraces the emerald mountains,
A wisp of azure mist lightly veils the water’s gleam.
The brocade-scaled fish are not hooked, returning empty-handed—
What use is a thousand-foot silk line?

Breaking through the sea-gate to seek the formless,
Piercing the empty valley to retrieve the mysterious pearl.
The celestial court’s supreme treasure—who is worthy to receive it?
I tell it to the great men of the world.

A drunken man asks, “Forty springs have passed,”
Suddenly awakened, he finds himself in a dream.
Forgetting form, there is naturally a path through the heavens,
Ascending to the Southern Palace, ranked among the jade stars.

In the silent, empty hall, the door stands half-closed,
Green peaches and red apricots emerge from the sparse fence.
Beyond the southern window, a pillow in the spring breeze—
Not like Zhuang Zhou’s butterfly dream.

The mist at the granary’s corner disperses, the red sun gleams,
The mist at the river’s edge clears, the azure sky shines.
The carefree scholar, his heart unburdened,
The snow-capped transcendent, his eyes bright.

Last night, sitting alone as the night deepened,
Guarding the inner elixir furnace, the four limbs at ease.
No wonder the sparse shadows beyond the curtain are white—
The moonflower visits, illuminating the jade.

The Qian Origin and Great Simplicity wondrously embrace the vast,
Refining the substance, flowing gold, purple qi arises.
At home, the auspicious youth smiles in the sun’s glow,
For whom does the sky’s scenery shine?

The vermilion gate opens to wondrous revelation, the azure grotto unfolds—
Five numinous immortals roam at will.
Dragon smoke coils into a thousand poems,
Amber cups brim with a hundred draughts.

In fleeting trance, the soul wanders the Great One’s abode,
Clouds and mist swirl like flying dragons and serpents.
Since the descent of celestial omens, who in the world has known?
Ten thousand drops of flowing essence merge with the splendor of things.

Far reaching to the Jasper Heavens, yet near as one’s brows,
The image bears celestial substance, wondrously pure and subtle.
Once I traced the traces back to the Primordial Ancestor,
The vast Brahman void transformed into jade and rainbow.

Though the body withers and the heart turns to ash, the will remains steadfast,
Embracing the spirit, guarding the One, one attains distant years.
Longevity need not mean lingering in the world—
Beyond lies a realm of gourd-bound sun and moon.

How can an earthen cauldron boil the golden elixir to froth?
The bottomless stone pool blends the ceaseless flow.
Heaven-shaking waves surge past Ox and Dipper,
Alone I steer a single-leaf skiff through the void.

The deluded, benighted child curls inward,
Yet the sea’s eye gazes outward, bright and clear.
Wandering the cinnabar heavens, the essence glistens,
Azure pupils faintly perceive the pale light’s chill.

Sleeping at night and stirring at dawn, both states forgotten,
Gradually the harmonious qi rises above and below.
The horn of dawn half-contains the gleaming red sun,
A range of brow-like mountains clears the azure sky.

Last night at the third watch, the moonlight was fresh,
The old path to the Jade Empyrean remained unchanged.
Opening wide my gaze across a thousand miles,
All phenomena arise from the single round mirror.

Auspicious cinnabar light scatters, illuminating the azure void,
Lead’s radiance, speck by speck, moistens the lingzhi brows.
The numinous youth, inclined toward the Yang abode,
Yet follows the phoenix carriage to the phoenix tower in flight.

Binding mercury, congealing lead, refining jade and rainbow,
The flesh transforms, bloodless, the countenance star-like.
With a single transcendent leap, ascending to heaven,
The imperial throne relies on the true wind and the Dao’s mighty power.

All gloom before the eyes transforms into Yang,
Within the cinnabar tripod, lead frost emerges.
The black serpent inverts to drink the blue dragon’s blood,
The image, formless, spits forth light in the night.

From time immemorial, all has been guest dust—
What thing constitutes the celestial truth?
Disciples toil in vain with their visits,
Seeking to see the present, yet failing to see the man.

Waves rise on Kun Mountain, stirring the Jasper Pool,
Blowing open jade flowers that scatter everywhere.
The vast void shimmers with auspicious hues,
Essence flows forth, dispersing through the Nine Purities.

Earthly po, heavenly po, sun and moon essence,
True Yang blazes resplendently bright.
Within the swirling divine wind, the Three Qi return,
Thrice reborn, a single star revives.

To refine and preserve, first master the six emotions,
With a start, guard simplicity—thus the Dao is born.
Who knows the flavor of Feather Mountain’s wind?
Clouds depart, heartless, yet the moon shines clear.

The Three Origins’ divine radiance, qi unbroken,
Five-colored jasper blossoms illuminate the Nine Heavens.
Heavenly omens merge into the True One’s image,
The mysterious image soars into the Great Clarity’s abyss.

The fiery furnace blazes, flames soaring,
The seething tripod surges with jade nectar.
The elixir’s fortune fills the eyes with splendor,
Myriad spirits harmonize, naturally pure and cool.

North’s darkness and South’s cinnabar each have their time,
The two spirits swiftly grasp heaven’s mechanism.
Together they devise to repay the chaos of death,
Sevenfold return, perfect communion, transcending old hearsay.

Thick mists and demonic vapors pierce the gall with chill,
In the dark, the black egg emerges from the mud pill.
A divine wind sweeps through the celestial strife,
The shadow-bearing light leaves no bloodstains.

The grotto’s true radiance merges with the pure void,
The resplendent golden elixir shines through the nine thoroughfares.
Having united the fetal spirit into one body,
Within it contains the numinous essence, birthing the mysterious pearl.

Layer upon layer of thin mist clears the cinnabar empyrean,
The cinnabar empyrean’s path is not distant.
Where earth meets heaven amid fragrant grasses,
A divine wind returns, transforming jade and lingzhi sprouts.

The stainless pure void, daily renewed,
Illuminates the heavenly summit, startling the soul.
Suddenly, unawares, form is forgotten,
Far off, striking the numinous Yang, passing the sea gate.

The Dao’s mystery is mystery upon mystery,
Mysteriously pervading, touching the realm before birth.
The cinnabar phoenix blows through the shooting-star eyes,
Flying into the Flourishing Yang and Great Unity’s heaven.

A wisp of rosy mist pierces the purple haze,
Yu’s remnant wind stills, grasses lush.
The sun’s soul foresees the numinous splendor,
Breaking through the cinnabar mound to reveal the sky.

Leaning on a pine, I ascend to gaze at Jade Flower Peak,
Towering, tier upon tier, hundreds of folds.
Moon’s po and sun’s hun inquire of each other,
Between them, above and below, the youthful countenance.

The toad’s radiance, bright and clear, pours into the Silver River,
Illuminating the cosmos with its vast, luminous qi.
Refining the po, enhancing the po, clarifying the Great Simplicity,
Transforming into immortals who ascend heaven’s net.

Northward, the misty waters dark and deep,
Pouring into the fiery palace of the Red Emperor’s realm.
Thus the waves calm, the dragon sleeps soundly,
Black lead wholly transforms into purple gold frost.

The dragon’s abyss in the watery realm reflects the sea pearl,
In the night’s darkness, the world’s mirror gleams like jade lard.
The carefree immortal’s twin pupils shine,
Just as the moon goddess ascends the Azure Capital.

Phoenix marrow and dragon fat perfume the land,
Brilliantly congealing, illuminating the encircling eyes.
Beyond the clear pupils, the spirit’s hues divide,
A single golden elixir shines in the Great Clarity.

Within the profound, deeper mysteries lie,
Beyond the heavens, more heavens arise.
Gazing upward, ever more distant, boundless,
Unawares, the soul flies beyond the Image Lord.

Silent and dim, the Dao incomplete,
Splitting open the chaos to reveal the double mystery.
Naturally mastering the Nine and Five, concealing all functions,
The soul soars, distant, through the eighteen heavens.

The Dao of nature is originally formless,
Clinging to this formlessness is but a borrowed name.
Recognize the single wheel of crystal sun,
Through the mysterious, one begins to perceive the Great Void’s clarity.

The Great Mystery’s vast grotto conceals the numinous treasure,
The Supreme’s emptiness hides the inner truth.
To know what the original truth is—
Not spirit, yet spirit, therefore spirit.

I originally idly chant poems of heaven,
Do not confuse them with inferior methods in wild guesses.
To you, I point directly to the path of cultivating truth—
The Dao connects to the numinous pupils, near as your brows.

Parting the cold mist to reveal the azure vault,
The sea’s moon clears the sky, all phenomena interpenetrate.
Standing alone in the vast, who is my match?
The cinnabar infant wanders, borne by the heavenly wind.

The divine wind, ceaseless, breaks through the cloud blossoms,
Washing the frosty heavens, the atmosphere pure.
Only then does the jade peak’s solitary moon gleam,
Piercing the mysterious tripod, suddenly awakening.

In former years, benighted, the heart’s source was closed,
Today, the Dao’s eye opens, clear and bright.
Delighted to see the azure sky like a jade table,
The twin millstones grind through the white cloud banks.

Turning the mysterious pass, the qi’s aspect returns,
The numinous crow flies past, the azure heavens open.

A single truth suddenly illumines both eyes bright,
Recognize the morning sun’s precious mirror-platform.
One millstone refines the sun’s light through the cosmos,
Two points of primordial essence radiate the valley spirit.

The precious mirror enhances the numinous, Heavenly Water flourishes,
Jade blossoms bloom across the Jade Capital’s spring.
The Jade Clarity, Primordial Beginning, Great Lofty Heaven—
Its majestic qi emerges before the Emperor’s advent.

Within the Purple Tenuity’s golden gates it unfolds,
The cinnabar infant wanders, countenance resplendent.
The sun-essence youth appears luminous,
Feathered canopy and jade blossoms veil the purple mist.

Thereby attaining the mysterious yang to open the precious mirror,
The jade star flies into the Grand Clarity’s abyss.
Twin blades of frost-edged swords gleam on Mount Taihua,
Cleaving the heavens’ crown to admit dragon-sand.

Ten thousand points of cinnabar yang, pure and refined,
All belong to the Primordial Lord’s Purple Mansion.
Vast qi and harmonizing wind penetrate the azure window,
Suddenly worldly traces merge with true yang.

In profound unity, all scheming ceases,
Responsibility and mutual radiance dispel ghosts of themselves.
Golden splendor clear, jade blossoms fly,
Cinnabar flowers flourish, purple clouds return.

Twin lads gather herbs beyond the cold stream,
Whether attained or not—who can know?
Divine work has its method to refine the elixir knife,
The lead crucible gently warmed by subtle fire.

No need for breath or forceful effort,
The flame furnace naturally bears snowflake blossoms.
Washing away worldly dust, ten thousand cares settle,
Shifting spirit into the sea to transform the cinnabar infant.

The Hua-Yuan immortal calls out in greeting,
Laughing, pointing toward the jade capital deep in clouds.
Twin phoenixes welcome the immortal into emerald haze,
Purple mist softly rises, illuminating crimson robes.

Where jade towers stir fragrant winds,
Golden flowers are blown aloft in flight.
Shifting spirit, stepping alone into the pure void,
Luminous purity of the void leaves no speck of dust.

Exchanging the drill for the agate casket, essence refines day by day,
Piercing the heart’s crucible to illumine the ice-pot.
Within, the true nature is clear; without, the mysterious is communicated,
Only when the mysterious illuminates the yang pass does the Dao begin.

Inner and outer awaken, jade-like clarity resplendent,
Intertwined radiance flies upward to Jade Capital Mountain.
Penetrating insight reveals the numinous jade, phenomena dissolve,
The primordial chaos directly flourishes, seizing the heavenly wind.

A single stream from Kunlun’s western waters
Pours into the icy abyss ten thousand fathoms deep.
Releasing a single point of primordial chaos’ essence,
It aids the dark yin and yang, illuminating the unseen.

Were it not the jade infant wandering the Purple Mansion,
How could the numinous palace encounter the Three Stars?
Cleaving open chaos to reveal dragon-light,
Entering and exiting vermilion gates to receive cassia frost.

Thereby attaining the five spirits to clarify the Grand Simplicity,
A single grain of golden elixir seizes heaven’s constancy.
The cinnabar phoenix toils, descending cassia branches,
The Jade Pool’s waters are sipped all day.

Released from the dual gates’ intent,
A single transformation of the mysterious pearl ascends the Great Lofty.
Numinous sound emerges from the distant and obscure,
A waft of fragrant wind enters the dream, clear.

Expounding the twin gates to connect the ancient Dao,
In the Jade Empyrean, one meets the Lesser Micro Star.
Screening away worldly dust, ten thousand affairs vanish,
Only in nothingness is the primordial chaos pearl seen.

Where does the vanished form, altered image return?
Softly, following the wind, it ascends the Jade Capital.
Gazing upward, the mysterious is revealed in the azure realm,
Flowing bells cast fire into the center.

A single point of cavernous origin, the heavenly wind flourishes,
Benefiting my three yin to transform into nine yang.
Cultivation requires exerting deadly effort,
Exchanging substance to retain the true, embodying the Great Nothingness.

The waning soul benefits the spirit in the golden banquet hall,
The cavernous mysterious returns to illumine the Jade Clarity Capital.
Jasper plum blossoms first unfurl with the east wind,
Drifting ethereally, connecting every place in the human realm.

Like the moon goddess departing her precious palace,
Just as the immortal enters the dragon palace.
Who has seen the Jade Pool’s jade-spring rinse,
Where ringing chimes startle the soul, first shocking heaven?

The yang soul pursues the flowing bell-fire to its end,
At night, the Lesser Micro Star awakens the plain mysterious.
Not desiring to scheme in the world of dust,
The carefree crane-nature recalls its eastern journey.

At the Dao’s gate, one realizes few know the tune,
Only the numinous Kunlun remains as before.
Strolling by chance to the Southern Palace to visit the Emperor’s return,
Sword-light flies past, shattering the precious mountain.

Alas for the countless eyes of mortals,
Who do not recognize Penglai’s board or Yuan’s go-between.
Heaven’s concealment, the true wind’s brilliance,
Within, it enfolds dragon-light, flying over the sea.

The golden cavern’s beauty, triple-layered mist,
The jade spirit’s grace, the twofold patterns’ harmony.
A single wheel of bright moon illumines the pure subtle,
The water realm’s divine forest reflects the jade stream.

Bracing air pierces the bones with crystalline clarity,
The Milky Way still bathes its icy flesh.
In the zhi-hall, feathered guests discuss the true mechanism,
Directly pointing to the jade heavens, the path unobscured.

Clear eyes unclouded by veiling mists,
In the Jade Empyrean’s banquet, one’s countenance shines like a star.
Sun and moon revolve, heaven and earth gleam,
Divine light intertwines, the Great Void brightens.

Those who attain this observe its wonders,
Easily meeting the heavenly wind to fill the realm with purity.
Transforming customs, shifting winds to emerge from worldly passions,
A single point of cool constancy, profoundly clear.

Containing light, silently merging with heaven’s substance,
Only then does one trust the divine work, the Dao’s awakening.
Cleaving open chaos to reveal the golden crow’s nest,
Striking through Kunlun’s ridge to the jade hare’s gate.

No need for twin pupils to illumine the dharma-realm,
Thus a single eye suffices to illumine heaven and earth.
The Grand Mystery pure, moon blossoms fly,
The Limitless radiant, moon essence returns.

Orchids and zhi flourish by the jade stream,
Who knows the divine work’s gathering?
Divine skill is reaped—who can know?

Precious blessings, the cinnabar phoenix’s path smooth,
Within the Jade Constellation Palace, immortals take flight.

Azure screens, the sun’s soul illumines the Mysterious,
Between brows, wisdom’s mirror penetrates essence.
The Three Origins’ Yellow Assistants soar in tandem,
The Pristine Heaven’s singular hue, pure wind.

Sunlight illumines the dark and bright, aiding the cavernous,
Wind blows, splitting the crown, opening heaven.
The entire land, dragon-light advances in splendor,
Divine power, two wings hover and circle.

Last night, clouds gathered, rain ceased,
Revealing jade peaks and the precious moon.
Numinous flight blends into the Middle Origin,
Myriad streams of yang-light shine through.

Kunlun’s mountain, a spring of golden water,
Circulating, rippling forth jade waves.
The original nature fills where emptiness dwells,
The profound Mystery reverses course, ascending the Star River.

Wondrous! The Jade Cavern’s eternal spring,
Within it, immortals roam and soar.
Transforming nature, golden halls’ feathered guests,
Forgetting form, sending off the old, welcoming the new.

The Supreme Dao gives birth to heaven and earth,
Midstream, the sun and moon pass through fullness.
Evolving transformations, the four seasons form images,
Blending into one nature, lofty and bright.

The Dao, vast without boundary or limit,
Spirit roams the expansive desert’s realm.
Gazing afar, celestial light blazes,
Great indeed, the Perfect Power’s true auspice.

**Seven-Character Full Poem**
Returning the two things, washing away deep confusion,
At *mao* and *you*, knocking open the *wu* and *ji* gates.
Beneath the turtle’s base, cold ashes rekindle flame,
Before Kunlun’s ridge, withered trees gradually grow roots.

Within the womb-born crucible, auspicious smoke shrouds,
In the infant’s furnace, auspicious qi surges.
Having attained the myriad spirits’ return to mother and child,
Then offer the one thing to the Primordial Honored One.

With you, I directly reveal the root’s source,
Wondrous transformations, the numinous mechanism lies before your eyes.
Pouring forth pristine waves, piercing the universe’s corners,
Unleashing red flames, filling the entire cosmos.

Pure essence, a singular hue, rivers and mountains flourish,
Vast qi, united with the origin, scenery grows fresh.
The Dao’s power relies on wisdom’s illumination,
Understanding this single method seizes immortals’ authority.

Silent, the yielding feminine guards the Great Male,
The Great Male, bursting forth, emerges from the vaulted sky.
Circulating, sun and moon conceal heaven and earth,
Flowing, essence and flower fill the Great Void.

Laozi awakened to this, becoming the Jade Image,
The Tathāgata attained this, verifying the Golden Countenance.

Since I encountered the Mysterious Origin,
Its transmission has spread everywhere among people.
In tranquil, true joy, far from recklessness,
A single cloud-heart refines the Nine Suns.

From heaven descends the Fire Dragon, roaming the sea’s depths,
From earth rises the black mist, entering the vaulted sky.
Golden Elixir flies forth from the Primordial Ancestor,
The Jade Image returns to the homeland of Dao and virtue.

Should you wish to know the true marvels of the Mysterious Origin,
Within the Five Thousand Words, ponder them in detail.
Rolling forth from Fusang, the sun’s single wheel,
Its radiant, blazing flames illuminate the Void.

Within the Qian-Yuan cauldron, the Fire of Li is added,
In the Taiyi furnace, the Wind of Xun arises.
The refined Golden Elixir soars through the cosmos,
The forged Great Joy emerges from the vaulted sky.

Divine transformations transcend a thousand kalpas,
Ascending Kunlun’s first peak.
Silent and desolate, the myriad forms dissolve into emptiness,
Within the void, dimly discerned, divine powers appear.

The moon in the endless sky is neither round nor incomplete,
The primordial wind neither moves nor sways.
Moonlight shines, yet Li Lou’s eyes lose their sight,
The wind blows, and Shi Kuang’s ears forget their keen hearing.

Through refined thought, the divine and sagely work grows refined,
Greatly revealing the Mysterious Origin’s supreme achievement.
Once parted from homeland and kin, forsaking the six relations,
Heart like cold ashes, form withered, escaping the clamor of dust.

The Azure Youth daily presents treasures within the text,
The Red Child constantly replenishes the cauldron’s precious contents.
Clouds and waters, Mount Jing’s empty appearances,
Post roads and merchant travels weary the spirit in vain.

Spirit roams the eight directions, riding the empty chariot,
In another realm, the Purple Palace blooms with spring.
Beyond the misty forest, the ancient pavilion of echoes,
Gibbons cry in the haze, awakening from drunkenness.

At midnight, through parted curtains, the sparse moon gleams white,
At dawn, beyond the window, the drifting wind is clear.
Pure as the jade zither’s chill beyond the world,
Resonant as the jade pendants’ sound amid the clouds.

Not a speck of dust remains, the starry eyes gleam bright,
The Flying Youth pierces the great Orchid City.
The Immortal of the Northern Darkness pays homage to Fuxi,
The path smooth, the Cinnabar Phoenix enters the Emperor’s realm.

Scattering auspicious jade blossoms, they reach the Sun Palace,
Gathering rosy clouds, the golden mirror shines in the Hall of Light.
Form shifts, shadow turns, transcending the Three Realms,
Things change, stars flow, emerging from the four directions.

Penetrating earth and heaven, yet nothing remains,
Solitary, a single point illuminates the center.
Without fasting rituals or scripture study,
Refining true essence enters the Great Vehicle.

In heaven’s furnace, the Red Phoenix’s marrow,
Between the brows, two cauldrons of Black Tortoise essence.
Yang’s light illuminates, piercing dark valleys,
Vast qi surges into the profound, entering the distant void.

Self and other both forgotten, the whole body manifests,
The work complete, one is ranked among the Nine Celestial Stars.
The solitary peak of Mount Mei, locked in cloudy blossoms,
A single path of mindfulness dissolves the form.

Two streams of pure light pierce the azure vault,
A single wisp of blue mist pours into the cold courtyard.
Osmanthus blossoms push forth, the spirit refreshed,
Luminous qi clears the forms, making them bright.

The twin luminaries’ intersecting light dazzles the heavens,
The Five Spirits’ immortals may ascend.
Worldly affairs and dusty passions, swept away with a single sword,
The divine wind’s mighty power matches the Mysterious Mechanism.

The sun’s essence and moon’s spirit penetrate the hexagrams,
Wood’s fluid and metal’s essence transform Kan and Li.
Riding phoenix wings through the Nine Bends of the river,
Embracing the dragon, soaring above the Three Mountains’ peaks.

Silently paying homage to the Lord of Images, returning to the transformations of Chen,
Swiftly driving the jade heavens, the path never lost.
The Mysterious Pass moves in and out, operating the pivot,
Dividing yin and yang, establishing the Two Modes.

Before the Taiyi Kun, the Jade Hare dashes,
Atop Kunlun’s summit, the Golden Rooster takes wing.
Within the Western River’s waves, red brocade unfurls,
From the Eastern Sea’s billows, the White Tortoise emerges.

Spitting forth auspicious light, the heart-cauldron shines,
The divine elixir advances in splendor, piercing the heavens in flight.
The celestial essence melts, nourishing the Seven Treasures’ body,
At ease, one never loses their true nature.

Two wisps of blue mist return to the Source Sea,
A single streak of light illuminates the Valley Spirit.
Often taking this mechanism to guide the superior person,
Always using the Supreme Dao to refine the stubborn vessel.

Fellow disciples, grasping the poem’s essence,
May also become carefree, idle individuals.

**Inscription of the Three Sages (Two Chapters)**

The Three Sages’ rule begins with the Dao as foremost.
Beyond affairs, how can it be natural?
Opening the *Book of Zhou*, "silent and unmoving,"
Illuminating the hexagrams and images, "stirred, they penetrate the Mysterious."

Delving into Buddhist scriptures, forgetting the finger pointing at the moon,
Awakening to perfect clarity, this may be called Chan.
Perusing the *Dao and Virtue*, "the Valley Spirit does not die,"
The profound Feminine, "entering and exiting, ceaselessly."

Wandering beyond the dust and grime,
Unfettered, before the Great Ultimate.
All streams, when gathered, return to the sea,
The myriad forms, when arrayed, all belong to heaven.

**Another Chapter**

Of old, the two masters opened my sacred text,
Uttering a single truth, unlocking the primordial chaos,
Expounding the Two Modes, splitting open Qian and Kun.

The great sound, why should it be confined to notes?
The great image, not bound by blue and black.
Pursuing Zhuangzi, attaining the formless net,
Measuring Guanzi, approximating the forgotten fish-trap.

Embodying the Tathāgata, awakening to the wondrous essence,
Exalting Laozi, exploring the profound mystery.
Profound! Profound!
Without beginning, without end,
Neither self nor other.
Beyond the images of the Five Phases,
Emerging before the myriad transformations of the primordial heaven.

Is this empty talk? It rests upon true vision.
Returning to the never-beginning,
Eternally enduring.

**Another Ode**

Heaven hangs its round image like an ice wheel,
Luminous and pure, without a speck of dust.
Twelve Jade Lads support the purple decree,
The August Emperor commands me to drink the Elixir of Eternal Spring.

**A Seven-Character Poem with Hidden Meaning**

Unadorned, the yellow-crowned visage, simple and profound,
Pearls strung with branches of red agate’s breath.
By what means is the transformation discerned? A snowflake’s hidden core,
Beneath the clam, beyond the flesh, twin pearls gleam.

A single gourd requires the dragon’s red path,
Upon the ice, mercury congeals, lead refines the golden crucible.
Great Zhang’s immortal queries, twelve odes in four-character verses.

**Supreme Clarity**

Within Supreme Clarity, undivided and whole,
The Primordial Ancestor, revered by all sages.
The Great Mystery, the Way of Great Mystery,
Ascends to the Primordial Palace.
Pure yang and true wisdom,
Wondrous transformations without end.

A single celestial path,
Two routes diverge as one.
The Jade Infant’s divine metamorphosis,
Reveals the visage of the lofty perfected.

The true realm of Penglai,
Where earth flourishes in eternal spring.
Roaming the azure screen in spirit,
One awakens to the celestial truth.

Within purity,
Nurturing the primordial spirit.
The numinous light illumines all,
The truth of the Great Ultimate.

Earthly po and celestial hun,
Above and below merge as one.
Formed into the supreme treasure,
Eternally enduring through kalpas.

The Dao is formless and vast,
Firmly nurturing the divine spirit.
A thousand truths converge,
Ten thousand sages find peace.

Yin po and yang hun,
Sun and moon in pursuit.
Piercing through the earthly gate,
Breaking open the celestial portal.

Sun and moon radiant,
Heaven and earth in harmonious fullness.
Unfurling the Dao-eye,
The whole is perfectly rounded.

Two infants,
Embrace the pure wind.
From the wellspring of awakened sea,
They leap into the Dragon Palace.

A spring of golden water,
Two rivers of silver.
The abyssal flow runs clear,
Rippling with numinous waves.

The crescent moon furnace opens,
Stirring forth jadelike plum blossoms.
Transformed into divine beings,
The immortal embryo takes form.

Merging and coalescing golden light,
Intertwined as one.

Straddling the heavens atop a fiery ox.
The sword’s light bears no bloodstain,
Severing the red dragon’s head.

The crucible’s cauldron boils and seethes.
The elixir complete, its radiance outshines the sun,
Crimson flames fill the cosmos.

The numinous brightness reveals the Great Truth.
The light of the Primordial Cavern enters the crucible,
Subtly reflecting the four seasons’ spring.

Returning to truth is not difficult.
I fear you lack steadfast resolve,
And thus remain distant by a thousand mountains.

Bright as the sun in the heavens,
Radiant as the moon’s blossoming light.

**Delighting in Forests and Springs**

In poverty’s dwelling, nurturing vastness.
Nurturing the spirit, preserving unified qi,

The heart of right and wrong already stilled,
Long have I gazed for the crane soaring to heaven.

Receiving the mandate of celestial immortals,
My spirit roams into the great expanse.

**Han the Second’s Inquiry on Awakening to Return to Truth**
Startled awake from southern branches,
Returning to truth, leaving the river of love.

Wielding her sword, ascending misty gauze.

Above, it reaches the realm of no-birth,
Joyfully attaining wondrous mystery.

**For Master Xin of Jigu Valley on Sitting in Meditation**
In a blink, the toad’s eye sits,
Raising brows, the Dao’s eye opens.
Knowing the heart, free from filth,
Recognizing nature, beyond dust.
Moonlight samadhi shines alone,
Lofty, illuminating the eight bounds.
Vast and still, without movement,
Suddenly beholding the Buddha Tathagata.

**Elder Yuan Asks on Sudden Awakening**
Sitting upright, sensing dimness,
Limpid, the Buddha’s eye opens.
Twin forests pierced by the bright moon,
Deer wilds suffused with pure wind.

The sick return to unity,
Countless spirits and gods are startled.

Gathering together for the purification fast,
Joy fills every heart.

The Chan gate reveals dharmata.
Blending all, the bright sun soars,
Its light shining upon the jade terrace.

Supreme goodness knows no resentment,

**Li the Immortal Asks of the Water Crystal Hall in Jing Mountain**
Resplendent, the water crystal hall,
Jade orchids fill the earthen pillars.
White clouds pierce the azure eaves,
Purple mist illumines golden light.
Brilliant, the chamber of congealed spirit,
Radiant, emerging from the grotto.
Had I not traveled to this place,
I would not have awakened to the immortal realm.

**Ten Admonitions for Disciples**
True words are the ultimate secret,
Why fear the judgments of others?
Pointing the way through frozen paths,
Lifting from the pit of karmic fire.
Not seeking the esteem of gentlemen,
Who fears the scorn of petty men?
Silent speech follows heaven’s principle,
Loyal heart transforms all to peace.

To learn the Dao yet cling to home,
Years pass, affairs grow awry.
Mouths boast of purity,
Hearts churn like tangled hemp.
Wine and lust ever increase,
Qi and wealth daily accumulate.
I urge you to awaken early,
Follow me to rest in clouds and mist.

Self and others, too much pride,
In truth, turning to perversity.
Cunning hearts like rhinos and tigers,
Fierce natures like vipers and snakes.
Lust is no path to cultivation,
Greed cannot nurture a family.
These two, how can they be right?
Each step is misaligned.

For years, leaving the sea of desire,
Today, still clinging to splendor.
Inevitably, solitary struggle brings suffering,
Again, entangled in dual bonds.
Unclear about the strange fruit,
Secretly eating winter melon.
Abandoning desire, yet desiring more,
Leaving home, yet entering home.

Lush and enchanting scenery,
Bewitching, the fragrance of jade wrists.
Willow brows, starry eyes like swords,
Tender cheeks, crimson lips like spears.
Brocade curtains become a prison,
Bed curtains erect a execution ground.
Though the head remains unsevered,
Qi is harmed, the hall of essence ruined.

Jealousy breeds resentment,
Lustful lechery lacks benevolence.
All day, lost in wine and lust,
Each day, attached to the red dust.
Guessing dogs ever companions,
Foxes and demons nightly kin.
The heart of lust not yet severed,
How dare one speak of heaven’s truth?

Speaking of soaring dragons,
Walking like limping turtles.
Cultivating mountains, the fruit unripe,
Yet worldly works already accomplished.
Lustful as wild birds,
Lascivious beyond mountain beasts.
Constantly harboring the mind of beasts,
Do not expect heaven and earth’s protection.

Learning the Dao without resolve,
Merely wielding a clever tongue.
Constantly storing the mad mind-horse,
Ever letting the heart-ape falter.
Secretly, the demon of lust,
Publicly, boasting of purity.
Deficient heart, deep karmic retribution,
One day, heaven’s judgment will fall.

Eloquent in expounding wondrous merit,
Yet dwelling amid wine and lust.
Unable to penetrate the sacred teaching,
Establishing one’s own household creed.
Nature stained within the red dust,
Body residing in the fire’s courtyard.
At the brink of danger, a single misstep,
Eternally sinking into the abyss.

Truth, when has it ever been?
Vainly wrestling with vines and creepers.
Knowing oneself a sparrow in the nest,
How can one see the whale or roc?
Short in conduct, boasting of skill,
Failing in merit, parading one’s ability.
Not for excessive flattery and deceit,
Evil karma multiplies ten thousandfold.

All resides in the Primordial Ancestor,
All returns to the Supreme Lord’s school.
Every head receives its mandate,
Every thing connects in mutual resonance.
Encompassing the Qian-Yuan image,
Containing the Great Beginning’s midst.
To exhaustively know the ancient stem,
Inquire at the Palace of Five Clarities.

**Zhang the Sixth of Hezhong Prefecture Asks of Spirit, Qi, and Essence**
Spirit’s light dazzles things to clarity,
Following transformation, revealing true form.
Profound, the azure sky’s moon,
Limpid, the azure vault’s stars.
Fathomless, returning to the Purple Palace,
Vague, entering the Yellow Court.
The utmost sage is unfathomable,
The Dao’s mystery, myriad transformations’ spirit.

At first, the single qi divides,
Following the mechanism, the four seasons flow.

Obscure, heaven and earth enfold,
Silent, the Great Void extends.
Rising and descending divide the pure and turbid,
Floating and sinking determine the ancestral lineage.
All beings endowed with spirit receive their mandate,
No thing is not encompassed.
Chaotic and profound, the essence of darkness,
Intermingling radiance gleams like the sun’s brightness.
The Qian-Yuan knows there is form,
The empty valley reveals the formless.
Pure and concentrated, it congeals in the heart’s crucible,
Yang’s light merges in the precious vase.
Embracing the splendor of heaven and earth,
Resplendent, it illumines Huaqing.

**Presented to Niu, Palace Examination Daoist Name Tonghengzi, Courtesy Name Guoxiang**
Guoxiang presents auspicious splendor,
Virtue and benefit treasure unimpeded passage.

Moving spirit into the imperial capital.

Who would carefully examine its details?

**Sunrise at Fusang Contemplation**
At sunrise, observing Fusang,
Only then does the Dao’s eye become clear.
Observing heaven, heaven is fundamentally still,
Examining earth, earth is at peace.
Amidst things, there is no lack of form,
Concentrating on emptiness, how could there be shape?
Responding to the moment with correspondence,
The integral whole reveals completion.

**Heart and Eyes Communing with the True Contemplation**
Heart and eyes commune with the true vision,
The true is before one’s eyes.
Two beams of light penetrate the earth,
One thread of purity soars to heaven.
The moon’s illumination, limpid and bright,
The stars’ presence, serene and luminous.
Should one encounter this method,
Instantly they transform into flying immortals.

Spiritual awareness penetrates pure light.

Utterly true, clearly penetrating to the depths,
Returning to nature, ascending to the Jade Heaven.

**Correct Unity, Void-Soaring Contemplation**
Correct Unity’s void-soaring vision,
Unfurling light, a myriad miles bright.
Throughout heaven, pure auspiciousness descends,
The entire land, purple mist arises.
The mysterious female facilitates coming and going,
Between the brows, taking the path of self-cultivation.
The true person encounters no obstruction,
The Four Seas, freely roaming at will.

**Luminous Fusion, Breath-Uniting Contemplation**
Luminous fusion, breath-uniting vision,
Utmost vision is the celestial truth.
The jeweled palace’s fragrant winds are extraordinary,
The jasper terrace’s emerald hues are fresh.
The flower pool irrigates the valley of wisdom,
Divine beings water the spirit’s root.
Every tree’s blossoms vie to bloom,
Radiance utterly free of dust’s speck.

**Detaching from Desire, Facing the True Contemplation**
Detaching from desire, facing the true vision,
Eternal spring exists in another realm.
Winding, crimson mist glows brilliantly,
Gently, purple light shines freshly.
The red child beyond the clouds,
The blue lad embraces the moon in sleep.
The jade dawn’s cold dew presses close,
Faintly sensing the crystal’s chill.

**Ten Poems on the Superior Practitioner**

The superior practitioner commands ghosts and spirits’ reverence,
Disasters vanish, calamities do not invade.

All sages’ blessings simultaneously arrive.
Suddenly awakening to the nature yet to come,
Able to know the past mind.
Present before one, constantly undimmed,
In daily use, guarding pure resonance.

The superior practitioner refines the returning elixir,
The returning elixir penetrates the two barriers.
Pure light departs the nine earths,
Crimson flames emerge from the three mountains.

All are ranks of immortals.

Serene, within and without the same.

Beyond the body, beholding the clear wind.

Void and nothingness penetrate the world’s emptiness.
Completely merging into one body,
The utmost Dao forever without end.

Within it, simmering the small fresh.

Just knowing the great medicine is whole.
Ingested, ascending to the upper realms,
Eternally dwelling in the Great Luo Heaven.

Spiritual light fills the chamber with radiance.
Distinctly revealing the Dao’s essentials,
Unfettered, exposing the heart’s mechanism.
This method is known by few,
The numinous text’s awakening is rare.
Should one grasp this meaning,
Wondrous transformation enters non-action.

The superior practitioner abides in non-contention,
Non-contention surpasses reciting scriptures.
Unfolding, clearly manifesting form,
Withdrawing, silently without shape.
Guarding the One, the five spirits stabilize,
Preserving the Three, the seven po settle.
Refining into the immortal child’s countenance,
Leaping into the Jade Void City.

Constantly perusing the *Daode* chapter.
Awakening to this true and wondrous principle,
What worry of not attaining immortality?

**Presented to Enlightened One Yang Qing**
The superior practitioner abandons glory and splendor,
Carefree, entering the grotto’s mist.

Primary and secondary divide into five hues,
The utmost principle, wondrous and without flaw.

Carefree, entering the grotto’s chamber.
Heaven’s emptiness suspends the wondrous body,
The heart’s ground merges with true yang.
The old woman sleeps in the toad’s shadow,
The infant embraces the sun’s light.
The original spirit knows there is a master,
Through myriad ages, attaining pure clarity.

**Seven-Character Quatrains by Marquis Gu She Shanyuan, Sixty Poems**

How wondrous—this heart at ease in the great school,
Not drifting midstream but reaching distant shores.
Drunk, I fell from the cart for white wine’s sake;
Sober, I grasp my sandals for pure tea’s grace.

Primal essence surges forth, piercing heaven’s flight,
Wandering winds yield to the Two Modes’ might.
Thus I shed my form to return to the unbegun,
Where the Azure Lad invites me to the Elixir Pool.

Why in youth did I leave my home?
Pondering deeply, I sigh with woe.
Had not the Image-Mystery flowed into the crucible,
I’d still be driving the salt cart to this day.

Dragon’s drool and phoenix candles trace fragrant smoke,
Eyes illumine sparse woods, vast qi serene.
A gust of cold wind startles the crane’s dream—
On the star altar, the *Step-of-Void* chant rings.

The secluded pass’s fading light dissolves form,
Dual luminaries merge their glow in one bright realm.
Self and things both forgotten, the whole body appears,
Fused into a single point of Great Void’s essence.

Brows unfurled like wings, the sky’s vastness gleams,
The radiant sun and numinous wind illumine the Grand Clarity.
Transforming the body leaves no room for wind-fire’s nature—
I know my true self belongs to the Lesser Weave Star.

A furnace of gold and fire emits lead’s splendor,
Dazzling heaven and earth with emerald haze.
Guarding within, no thieving yin-ghosts intrude—
Naturally, the sacred crucible congeals numinous sand.

Nurturing one furnace of red phoenix marrow,
Refining two crucibles of crimson dragon essence,
I open the cosmos-wide Heavenly Eye—
At chaos’ first division, my vision grows clear.

Late at night, sitting alone as autumn’s moon hangs,
Auspicious qi lightly floats through twelve cycles.
Longing to return to Divine Empyrean’s old path,
The ancient fork gleams where azure haze gathers.

The soaring kite outshines cloud-ladders,
Carved wood’s craft plays with cunning mechanisms.
To be useful or not—one must suit oneself;
In the forest, I cast aside the sling and wander home.

Shaking off the dust’s bonds, I part ways,
My brother’s resolve stands firm, unchanging.
Though water and clouds veil us three thousand leagues apart,
I vow not to return unless I become an immortal.

Gazing up and down through a hundred thousand fathoms,
My drunken soul flies into the azure sky’s heart.
A youth guides me to Jade Pool’s mouth—
The toad’s radiance is refined into pure gold.

This illusory body long concealed in deep illness,
Exchanging form and light to illumine the jeweled peak.
Layers of jade-green shadows float on rushing mist,
A fire-dragon emerges from the azure pool’s depths.

In a blink, brows raised, the sun of wisdom dawns,
A river of landscapes unfolds before my eyes.
Jingshan’s peaks split open to reveal the spirit-treasure—
A flawless heap of jade gleams forth.

My heart dwells beyond things, serene and free,
A single lotus leaf floats on the azure sea.
The lotus blooms, its flower born of the sun’s smile,
Drifting with the wind to Jade Capital’s sky.

Standing tall in the empyrean, I survey the world’s splendor,
On Jade Pool’s twin shores, golden flowers bloom.
My drunken soul roams beyond the mundane,
Awakening into the Mysterious Metropolis, the Lord of Images’ abode.

The Mysterious Origin and Great One embrace vast mystery,
Within the misty haze, all sights arise.
Only when the two spirits merge with the twin luminaries
Does yin’s numen transform into a single celestial star.

Gazing into the grotto’s waves of deep green,
A sea-dragon plays with the night’s radiance.
Light blazes from the Great Nonbeing’s vast solar horn—
Myriad spirits converge to bear witness to the True Yang.

Auspicious clouds densely blanket river and sky,
Phoenix plumes and rainbows pierce the sun’s corner.
No wonder fragrant winds fill the hall—
In the jade palace, the jasper trees’ flowers vie in bloom.

The pearl-playing dragon emerges as the sea-gate opens,
Purple mist soars through the ninefold heavens.
Breaching the Bitter Pool to swallow sun and moon,
The immortals of the ten directions all turn in awe.

Rolling up the pearl curtain to gaze outward,
Pine winds and radiant sun penetrate the jade grove.
Seven treasures gather in the tortoiseshell abode—
A dazzling cluster of silver haze and jade.

Roaming and soaring through golden clarity, merged with the Great Void,
Brow Mountain’s moon-valley floats with auspicious clouds.
Without mastering this art, what can one achieve?
In vain does one stand tall in the empyrean as a man.

Before the jade mountain, myriad trees bloom,
Naturally claiming a fine livelihood.
The immortal lad smiles at the western guest—
Recently, the High Yang wine-tasting household.

Returning again to Divine Empyrean’s old path,
I wander at ease within the Jade Clarity Palace.
The starry river gleams, unknown to all—
Two blossoms of jasper bloom in one place.

Clearing the wild to plant jade *zhi* sprouts,
I break open Jade Pool to irrigate them anew.
Dao-qi circulates, surging through the azure sea,
Numinous winds pervade the clear empyrean.

Sun’s essence and moon’s marrow are refined without loss,
Earth’s po and heaven’s hun are tempered without flaw.
Exchanging substance while retaining truth, I endure in the world,
Amid ninefold radiance, I roam at will.

Misty Jiang’s haze scatters, the vast sky clears—
Alone, I face the Crimson Yang’s flying snowflakes.
Golden and jade light streams, illumining the Grand Clarity,
In the cold forest, jasper flowers naturally form.

The world’s net and dust’s passions—already left behind,
The Mysterious Gate’s true secret—what doubt remains?
If a man harbors the will to soar to heaven,
Why wait to become an immortal?

Clinging to illusion, why question the illusory mechanism?
Awakening to the mechanism still leads one astray.
I sigh for the cloud-water wanderer of the east—
In vain he journeyed to Jing Mountain, returning empty-handed.

The hundred-legged *kui* and serpent pass pity in turn,
Wandering winds and spirit transformations—all in vain.
One must first seek the precelestial ancestor—
Only then can one enter my school’s foremost mystery.

Last night at the third watch, the moon shone bright,
Gentle winds and dew dripped in clear spheres.
Who sang that resonant melody?
I suspect it was a jade-inebriated immortal from the jasper palace.

Alone I come and go on Zhongnan’s slopes by the Wei,
Seeking the worthies, I pass through Tong Pass.
Market scholars and rustic elders pay no heed—
Through rain and clouds, I return to my old mountain.

Briefly leaving the immortal isle for the human realm,
The bitter sea’s waves make salvation arduous.
Braving snow and wind, I return to my old retreat—
In the night’s chill, I cross Tong Pass with sword in hand.

Nine years’ work accomplished, the effect is subtle,
Returning home, I contain the jade mechanism’s secret.
Long have I sighed for the empyrean—
Yet in the forest, I am again bound like a tree stump.

Clinging to illusion, Master Wen questions the illusory mechanism,
Further inquiring of Master Yang—only to deepen the maze.
How many gains and losses does the deer discern?
Drunk, I ride the cart, my limbs undone.

Words and wit contend with Hui Ang,
Yet I regret having no master to meet Liang Yang.
Abandoning home and neglecting work to indulge desires—
Thorns await the moment to test Ji Chang.

The wise of this world mock those who leave home,
Knowing their spirit’s vastness has no bounds.
Seeking the fire-mirror, three cups of wine—
Their savor surpasses Lu Tong’s seven bowls of tea.

The rut-bound fish long trapped, awaiting the western river,
For my esteemed guest, I speak of Master Yang.

All say, "Having gained the pearl, why need the Dao?"
Fortunate to meet Master Dongguo, I pour out my heart.

Ten thousand layered emerald peaks lean against the azure haze,
A river of jade-green waters joins the river’s edge.
Where now the sword bestowed in years past?
To whom today is the hidden light entrusted?

Auspicious radiance stirs the celestial glow, illuminating the Great Clarity,
The vermilion court bears the fiery essence of tiger and dragon.
Refined into a treasure-mirror, luminous as the heavens,
Two divine beams converge in one bright place.

Facing the wind, we chant and harmonize a thousand poems,
Beneath the moon, cups brim with a hundred measures of wine.
At ease upon ancient Kunlun, self and other forgotten,
The drunken soul soars into the Palace of Broad Cold.

The ancient Dao was originally divided from the Primordial Beginning,
Vast and boundless, the Three Realms merge as one.
The whale and roc emerge from the sea, their traces stretching far,
Flying to the Jasper Pool in the sixth summer month.

I regret having pursued rare skills and vain pursuits,
For rank and wealth, glory and gate—how hard to attain!
Just now I saw the lord boast of his strength,
Fashioning a single leaf for you to see.

The shallow filth of the salamander and loach becomes their foundation,
Yet to restrain the weak and bind the sturgeon is not fitting.
If only the heavenly wind would lift my wings,
I would ride the whirlwind to the Jasper Pool.

The fiery wheel grinds through the azure beryl,
Two golden beams advance in radiant flight.
Thus the image of the Mysterious flows into the crucible,
Naturally roaming and soaring through the Ninefold Clarity.

Who pities the rut-bound fish, trapped on the road?
Those who flow with the current mock the sickly flesh.
The misty waves of the Northern Sea must part in the end—
Unfurl your wings, chart the southern course, cross the Five Lakes.

Who has seen the divine being, so ethereal in form,
Drinking wind, sipping dew, her skin like snow?
For a moment she leaves the misty caves of Guye,
Steadily riding the flying dragon to the Jade Capital.

What matter of the Primordial Origin is most profound?
The towering treasure-dharma crowns all past and present.
Having gained the jade grove’s soaring white feathers,
A single crimson sun illumines the heart of heaven.

At ease with Mei and Zhang, I chant extemporaneously,
The two masters’ wisdom deepens our bond.
Like wind and moon, clear through all ages,
They illuminate the heart of heaven, ten thousand fathoms deep.

Striking the void, striking things—ghosts and spirits startle,
Leaning into each step, borrowing lightness with ease.
When I ascend the Jade Empyrean to the realm of Jia,
I shall transform you then, carrying you to take dragon form.

A crucible of golden fire blazes in the celestial thoroughfare,
Revealing the flawless pearl that illumines the sea.
Enveloped and suddenly clarified, congealing into jade,
Refined into an immortal—wondrous skill!

Jade springs well forth, flowing into golden wells,
In an instant, the southern cinnabar and northern sea achieve merit.
Splitting the Mysterious Pearl to release radiant clouds,
The Mysterious Pearl soars to Kunlun’s summit.

Perfect clarity—ten thousand dharmas exist within the void,
A single stream of cinnabar surges through the gate of wisdom.
Gazing upon the jade grove’s clustered blossoms,
Two geese tilt the celestial flask, pouring wine from the Gourd Heaven.

The Primordial Great Man’s wind tears asunder,
His brows like the jade toad swallowing the moon over the sea.
The treasure-feast’s celestial light illumines the Five Tombs,
Cinnabar essence scatters, yellow blossoms form.

Staff in hand, I wander to visit the misty vines,
Yet how many desolate paths and wayward inns lie in wait!
No need for the two concubines to know beauty or ugliness—
Alas, I lack the grace to emulate Han E.

Three-colored mists swirl, striking the Crimson Palace,
Vermilion gates half-conceal the true countenance.
The ice-grinding wheel shatters the path of the Mysterious Ridge,
Transforming all under heaven with the wind of primordial antiquity.

To move things, to pluck flowers—all is emptiness,
Where in human relations does one apply effort?
The Tathāgata once spoke of awe-inspiring spiritual power—
I ask the Chan stream: have you grasped it?

Ascending the upper story, the eye’s realm brightens,
I seem to doubt my body has reached Huaqing.
No need for cloud-borne chariots in the central heavens—
I fly into the fiery palace to accompany the morning star.

Gazing all day at the golden crow in the empyrean,
The Vermilion Mound’s fiery domain refines the jade crucible.
The treasure-dharma dissolves form, transcending the material,
The Nine Spirits’ immortals ascend to the Upper Clarity.

The numinous gaze, tempered, enters the vermilion court,
Yellow qi surges, sweeping away impure forms.
Looking up and down, the cavernous void is fully responsive,
The lush radiance of the Empyrean illumines Huaqing.

**Seven-character full verse**
In the Hall of Fungi, verdant hues speak of the Mysterious Subtle,
Directly pointing to the alchemical canon, revealing the jade mechanism.
The ocean’s depths churn with red agate,
The mountain’s heights shatter azure beryl.

The jade hare of the Moon Palace roams the mossy path,
The golden crow of the Sun Palace rests on the cassia branch.
Two segments of light return to one place—
The Peerless Noble ascends to the Jasper Pool.

In years past, I wandered and lost my way, not returning home,
Today, turning my gaze, I return to the emerald clouds.
Golden fire overflows the crucible in five hues,
Cinnabar fills the tripod, emitting triple radiance.

By the river, I seize and break the Black Dragon’s tail,
On the ridge, I strike open the White Tiger’s teeth.
The cave-mirror of Fivefold Clarity penetrates the Great Existence—
Then I ride the crane-chariot, driving the cloud-carriage.

In the cavern-chamber, the night is desolate,
The ape and horse are captured to accompany solitude.
The jade hare pursues the toad at the corner of the heavens,
The golden crow embraces the sun, circling the sky’s waist.

The dragon coils around the medicine tripod, the Three Flowers gather,
The tiger retreats from the elixir furnace, the Five Qi pay homage.
Refining the numinous cinnabar to dwell beyond form,
The Jade Capital’s immortal precincts are not far.

By chance I traverse the long abyss, dwelling temporarily,
Like one waiting for a hare by an empty stump.
Unmet by Bo Le, I ride a salt-laden horse,
Like encountering Zhuangzi’s rut-bound fish.

How could I heed the vain search of years past?
Only now do I know the attainment of the Mysterious Pearl.
In Longxi, we meet again by chance—
I write these heartfelt words to send to you.

Why does Zhan He reel in his fishing line?
The □ carp leaps the waves, snapping the hook.
Delighted to escape the shallow stream, leaving the sea of suffering,
Fortunate to meet the long waters and find ease.

Content to dwell in a thatched hut, welcoming the mountain elder,
Forgetting to visit the vermilion gates of noble lords.
Who will see me home, drunk from the village feast?
A shepherd boy supports me, riding backward on an ox.

Alas, I wander within and without, knowing no path,
Mistakenly entering the cloudy mountains to strike and stay.
The lost Mysterious Pearl must be sought in concealment,
The moon of the mind, once stilled, requires no search.

A single strand of blue mist descends from the heavens,
Two trails of red rainbow roll across the earth.
Having reached the Fiery Palace, mother and child part,
Sideways, the Seven Luminaries circulate through the great expanse.

I send word to the pine-shaped, crane-haired elder:
Search well for the Mysterious Subtle, leap from the mortal cage.
The Three Passes’ qi surges, white as the heavens,
A single golden elixir shoots red into the crucible.

Mercury congeals in the Jade Yang, leaving the Water Palace,
Lead solidifies into golden qi, entering the Fiery Palace.
The flowing pearl ascends Kunlun’s summit—
I behold the vast winds of the Jasper Pool.

To imitate others is not merely to betray kindness,
Concealing evil, obscuring the upright, dimming heaven’s truth.
Relying on spirits, clinging to the Dao for livelihood,
Clasping a child, nestling with a wife, expounding the teachings—

Such is not the way.

The discerning masses despise the lofty adept,
The ignorant demons slander the enlightened one.
Say not that heaven and earth lack judgment—
Far in descendants, near in one’s own person.

**Five-character full poem**

Joy and sorrow stem from a lost horse,
A blemished eye from birthing an ox.
The deer was shared by Duke Xun’s minister,
The butterfly dream awakened Zhuang Zhou.
Gu Ye returned through spiritual transformation,
Hu Qiu resumed his outer wanderings.
Dongmen became my companion,
Nanguo too my fellow.
In youth, my nature inclined toward the sacred,
In middle age, my appearance grew dull as folly.
The gull startled, forgetting its true form,
The dog barked at the exchange of black robes.
Why question the two concubines?
The Three Spirits have their own appointed time.
Ji Jian failed in physiognomy,
Wen Zhi excelled in healing arts.
Who wields the illusions of the owl and rooster?
The ring dance charts its own discord.
Sharp as a mountain-consuming fire,
Proud as a cup set upon the elbow.
A gentleman’s vessel bears no burden,
Yet displays the talent of a petty man.
Recent conduct differs not from wisdom,
Vainly laboring on a thousand-foot terrace.
Why should such as these cross the threshold?
A master craftsman measures before cutting.
Easy to maintain a pure and disciplined mind,
Hard to sustain a daily fast.
The crucible boils root-bound greens,
The furnace burns leaf-laden firewood.
I marvel at the fish trapped in the wheel rut—
A ladle of water brings no disaster.
Disciples’ affections run shallow,
The Daoist abbey grows desolate.
Wild herbs remain year-round,
Household grain nears exhaustion.
My heart has already consented—
What say you, sir?
Liezi journeyed through Wei,
Yet where to find one’s true abode?
In facing affairs, one knows the value of leisure,
In stilling the mind, one perceives the Dao’s majesty.
Ancient masters personally demonstrated ruin,
Temporarily borrowing aid from the Mysterious Gate.
Why boast of flint’s sharpness?
Shang Qiu remains in dullness.
Three years to form a single leaf,
All by grace of heaven’s favor.
The secret of ascending immortality is broken—
Kunlun’s peaks array the Two Modes.
The elixir furnace gathers divine fire,
The precious tripod glows with nocturnal radiance.
Refining the body into golden liquid,
Nourishing the countenance into jade mist.
Mighty spirit shines in great abundance,
The roc’s wings reach the celestial pool.
Having encountered the true immortal’s secret,
I dwell in seclusion to refine the valley spirit.
Through penetrating the mysterious, self and other are forgotten,
Attaining the wondrous, kinship and estrangement dissolve.
Yin Shi transformed into a servant,
The laborer presumptuously played the guest—
No need to distinguish waking from dreaming,
Beyond appearances lies eternal spring.
A long whistle laughs at the unworthy,
Fishing for fools, not for fish.
A needle’s tip dispenses grains of rice,
A standing tree praises the long road.
When singing in harmony, gratitude must be distant,
Those who know the tune keep the Dao close.
Looking down upon my disciples,
Not one shares the same aspiration.
Striking tiles, the child is careless,
Mocking poetry, the vase is but a model.
Inquiring of the dawn, one knows distance,
Pitying creatures, one discerns their arising.
Dispelling illusions, the ring dance ceases,
Welcoming the lord, facing the circular screen.
Refining cinnabar to temper azure jade,
Exchanging bones to ascend Qingcheng.
On the road, startled by the three cloths,
Midway, wary of the five brews.
The inept servant cannot judge a horse,
The neighbor’s son has already lost his sheep.
Why plot to wear Zhang’s seal?
Why imitate Ji Chang?
Not boasting of autumn waters’ arrival,
The heart finds boundless ease.
The Great Dao manifests the Three Bodies,
The Three Bodies all converge in one truth.
The black dragon hides in the depths,
The cinnabar phoenix rises in auspicious clouds.
The two apertures pour forth golden liquid,
The twin passes refine the jade spirit.
Wisdom’s light soars to the purple towers,
Resplendent, it illumines the celestial wheel.
Splitting open the seamless pagoda,
Releasing the primordial essence.
Qi spreads, calming the three rivers,
Clouds withdraw, clarifying the four seas.
The golden serpent roams the water palace,
The jade hare hastens to the fiery city.
Refining the firm and pure nature,
Returning to rest in the Great Clarity.
Ten thousand *yi* given are still too few,
A single hair’s aid is more than enough.
At ease with the three excellences,
Dwelling in leisure for a hundred years.
The Yan capital holds no intent to depart,
The Hua Xu realm beckons with purpose.
Life and death are but momentary realizations,
Forgotten again in an instant.
Hidden illumination pierces the jade grove,
Jasper blossoms scatter from the jeweled peak.
The vermilion court hears the golden phoenix cry,
The lunar palace echoes the jade dragon’s chant.
Refining the body to condense the Three Qi,
Nourishing the spirit to disperse the Nine Yin.
The mysterious image is like a precious mirror,
Ever present in the azure sky’s heart.

**Two five-character quatrains**

Azure pupils cast light to earth,
The red sun’s flames reach heaven.
Within the five-colored clouds,
A single lotus leaf in the Jasper Pool.
Outer and inner are all illusion,
The center is wholly void.
Pointing to the unenlightened—
Where to apply effort?

**Seven-character quatrains**

The true message is clearly revealed,
The celestial eye pierces emptiness through wisdom’s power.
Above and below, perfectly fused—nothing remains,
Majestically revealing the vast and luminous.
Who can recognize the Primordial Dao of Mystery?
Silent and desolate, it enters without seam.
Striking with unyielding might, it shatters the sky,
Congealing emptiness, ten thousand points of streaming stars emerge.
The Primordial Void Sovereign gave birth to the Great Antiquity,
Fitting to be the eternal lord of the mysterious.
Among the four great domains, it alone stands first,
Enduring through kalpas as heaven and earth’s ancestor.
Nourishing the spirit, I knock upon the Dao to clarify mysterious virtue,
Vastly distant from misty vines, still and silent.
Leaping forth as a flying immortal into Great Hua,
Dwelling forever in the serene and sunlit realm.
The heart connects to wondrous subtleties, illuminating true patterns,
Attaining that pure emptiness, delving into profundities.
The supreme Dao is level and easy, taken in due course,
Ascending the mysterious to become a guest of the Great Canopy.
At heaven and earth’s center, like a bellows,
Skillfully harmonizing sound and form through mutual accord.
Within the mysterious, not striking the fine notes,
A single strain of reed pipes pierces the phoenix pavilion.
The Jade Clarity Sage Ancestor left the Three Armors,
Responding to the supremely profound and wondrous Dharma.
Sending forth jasper blossoms to descend from the azure sky,
Red frost flake by flake, pressed by fragrant winds.
Sincerity subdues the corporeal soul, uplifting the ethereal,
Luminous qi, pure and clear, envelops the jeweled jade.
Intent follows the sun’s splendor into emerald peaks,
Jade cliffs stretch into the gaze of empty mountains.
Shaking off the dusty world, not long submerged,
Merging with the Great Beginning, knowing the true origin.
Divine might and qi’s image encompass heaven’s heart,
The Dao spreads the sun’s essence, bright and glistening.
The Dao slays the Three Corpses through the power of attraction,
The numinous yang elixir conceals pure yin.
Suddenly, unaware, the inner form is forgotten,
Seated, one attains the cloudy heavens, the spirit feasts in repose.
Within, the essence is cleansed, the void gleams with jade fragments,
Clear as ice, lustrous as the autumn river’s moon.
The Crimson Palace faintly senses the crystal’s chill,
Jeweled splendor, starlight’s radiance, flying flakes of snow.
A single point of heaven’s light in the Great Void,
Clapping, sealing, surging harmony enters without seam.
Treading upon the ten thousand fathoms’ peak of heaven and earth,
Congealing emptiness, flying stars rush forth.
The jade well’s flowing spring does not burst forth,
The resonant chime echoes against the green mountains.

The jade waves surge through the peaks’ clouds,
Waves batter Kunlun’s stones to powder.
The golden well glows with the sun’s radiance,
Cloud-jades fly forth from the Jasper Pool Isle.

The crystal curtain winds roll, wafting pure fragrance,
Heaven’s lustrous void, dustless, transmits the Six Treasures.
The Dharma-eye unfolds at the brows’ lashes,
Eyes gleam, pupils dazzle, weaving celestial brilliance.

Awe-inspiring wind encircles the earth from the four directions,
Ten thousand streams of numinous light greet the heavens.
The Primordial Beginning dwelt before the vast kalpas,
Opening the Three Realms, establishing the Double Mystery.

Heaven and earth are born from Its transformation,
Through kalpas’ ruin, It endures, ever majestic.
The Dao transforms the Three Palaces in wondrous mystery,
The Primordial Spirit Emperor secretly transmits It.

Fetal radiance flows into the numinous yang body,
Six Caverns’ flying essence descends from the Nine Heavens.
The pilgrim’s staff stirs the sea of Perfect Awakening,
The precept-knife cleaves the Jade Capital Mountain.

The Dragon Palace proffers the resplendent Mystic Pearl,
Subtle flowing light fills heaven and earth.
Jade-like forms ascend the peaks in reverse,
The numinous crow alights by the sea turtle’s edge.

Forms shift, shadows turn, following the wind’s departure,
Things change, stars drift, waves meet the sky.
The divine sword, whetted, startles the mad steed,
The wisdom-blade, brandished, shocks the playful ape.

Heaven and earth stand apart, all demons’ heads severed,
A single surge of awe-inspiring light topples the world.
At night, the sonorous stone is cast into the sea’s depths,
The Water Palace is split open, revealing the Dragon Palace.

All proffer the luminous pearl in offering,
Flames blaze in the cloudy skies, the azure firmament.
The Precept Altar’s sacred beasts exhale fragrant spirals,
Jade pendants chime, harmonizing with the tinkling girdle-ornaments.

True sages descend, returning to their original stations,
Once more wielding the divine sword, ascending the stellar pivot.
I urge you to keep your heart in the realm of Dao and virtue,
I hear the immortal courts have established the examination grounds.

The Divine Empyrean bears wings to transmit the golden register,
The Purple Palace knows no one to present the jade missive.
The dragon soars, roaming the Crimson Emperor’s realm,
The Luo Yuan immortal maiden sits in Flowery Yang.

Two streams of earthly qi traverse the Ox and Dipper,
A single ray of heavenly light anchors the azure vault.
The Crimson Palace just perceives the talismanic smoke’s fragrance,
The wind gently carries the sound of jade pendants.

In the clear night, who presents the memorial?
The perfected one paces the stellar pivot upon the altar.
Cultivation must attain the Valley Spirit’s numinosity,
A single point of perfect clarity illumines the Supreme Clarity.

The frosty sky, profound, hosts the ancient moon,
The limpid sea of awakening bathes the streaming stars.
A single grain of numinous cinnabar glows in the Great Clarity,
Merged with the empty valley, the formless appears.

The Dharma-realm’s boundless truth gleams in a thousandfold purity,
Misty radiance illumines the ten thousand images of heaven and earth.
The ancient Dao, level and smooth, allows progress,
Two branching paths connect to the celestial court.

Riding the dragon, the maiden of alchemy roams the Golden Gates,
Mounting the tiger, the infant traverses the Jade Capital.
Treading Kunlun, piercing the heavens,
Returning to the supreme Dao, restoring the primordial origin.

Tigers leap, mountain peaks turn,
Dragons soar from the abyss, sea waves churn.
Opening the wisdom-eye, beholding the divine light,
A single surge of pure yin wholly transforms into yang.

Vast as the sun rising to illuminate the world,
Bright as the moon casting its glow upon all directions.
Brushing aside the mist, the spirit roams the azure realm,
Two wheels converge, grinding the stellar pivot.

Dragons fly in the sun’s palace, brewing golden liquid,
Phoenixes blaze in the moon’s palace, drinking jade nectar.
Shunning worldly ties, seeking beyond the material,
Head held high, laughing freely, delighting in the joy of song.

Shifting the spirit, step by step, following the wind’s path,
Escorting my light form to ascend the precious peak.
The Dao descends in misty splendor, the scene is sublime,
The wondrous birth of heaven and earth knows no bounds.

Flying essence, refined, pierces the heavens’ summit,
Embracing the sun, approaching the void, transforming Mount Taihua.
Avoiding wind, nestling by the sun, eyes languidly open,
Within, yin and yang unite to nurture the sacred embryo.

Only then does one believe a man’s body can conceive,
Naturally, beyond the material, the immortal fetus dances.
Pairing heaven and earth to serve as the elixir furnace,
The sun and moon, round, encircle the face’s dwelling.

At the sea’s bottom, the true supreme treasure is refined,
The gray-haired one cooks the Primordial Pearl to perfection.
Slaying the ape, taming the horse, transforming the dragon colt,
It bears me, following the wind, into the Great Void.

A single streaming star flies to the moon’s palace,
Two crimson flames ascend to the celestial Wu.
Clad in simplicity, awakened, drinking the true wind,
Emerging from the human realm, affairs are not the same.

Should you ask where the master abides,
Steadily riding the crane’s back, wings upon the turtle palace.
Amidst the seated clouds and mist, the cold stream is locked,
Thunder’s peaks rumble, disturbing the Supreme Subtlety.

Ten thousand silver waves pour into the azure ravine,
A single surge of jade waves cascades into the Jasper Pool.
The sun’s soul and moon’s spirit cast their cold radiance,
The two are captured, held between Kan and Li.

Suddenly, from the sea’s depths, the dragon and tiger roar,
Atop the mountain, the phoenix and luan bird take startled flight.
The layered peaks of Guye cast floating emerald shadows,
Within the grotto, the divine transformation reveals snow-white skin.

By what power does one roam the four seas?
The crane’s chariot, riding the whirlwind, departs the Jade Capital.
Releasing the jade hare to chase the numinous crow,
Catching up to the Gate of Simplicity, entering the Great Beginning.

Ten thousand golden rays illuminate the cosmos,
A thousand silver mists shine upon the void.
To refine the One True, the Three Wonders must be cultivated,
Then employ the Three Wonders to unite the Two Modes.

If the Two Modes are made one body,
The golden elixir will naturally pierce the heavens and fly.
Eyes pure, beholding the celestial signs,
Ears keen, listening to the steps of emptiness.

Great is the Dao that follows all directions,
The most wondrous true constancy merges with the sun’s congealment.
The fiery furnace pours into the tripod, refining red cinnabar,
Three-colored mists swirl, releasing rainbow hues.

Resplendent treasures, intricate, fly through the cosmos,
The Primordial Elixir descends into the Central Land.
The body like withered wood, the nature like ashes,
Silently, in clarity, nurturing the sacred embryo.

Seated in the jade palace, coming to inquire of the Dao,
Head held high, laughing freely, the osmanthus blooms.
Brows arched, eyes bright, the heart’s pearl leaps,
Descending upon the golden plate, five colors unfurl.

Within, dispatching the jade lad to gather the sun’s sea,
To accompany me in returning to the grotto-heaven’s abode.
When lead and mercury are paired, rely on the sun and moon,
When the tripod and furnace are placed, employ heaven and earth.

The Three Yangs’ true fire burns the numinous substance,
A single grain of golden elixir ascends in reverse.
A foot’s distance, yet the sea of suffering is deep,
The mind follows the currents, drifting into the waves’ heart.

Losing the celestial truth, one wanders through a thousand kalpas,
From ancient times until now, endlessly cycling.
Ascending the Mystery, awakening to the Dao’s profundity,
Expanding the numinous source, concealing the illusory heart.

In an instant, traversing all directions,
Only by treading the ancient path can one know the present.
Startled awake, one awakens to the immortal realm,
Only then does one trust the spirit’s congealment in the sun’s beneficent light.

In the child’s furnace, the jade liquid pours,
Within the fetal immortal’s tripod, the jasper nectar blends.

The Dao’s utmost profundity, wondrous and mysterious,
The Supreme Clarity’s true teaching—how could it be vain words?
If you still possess a man’s resolve,
I shall impart the celestial mechanism to your ear alone.

All speak of refining the elixir, yet none speak of the elixir’s duality—
The two golden elixirs lie but a foot’s span from the Great Void.
A single pill, resplendent, illuminates the cosmos,
Yet in daily use, it seems as distant as ten thousand mountains.

Gazing down, one sees Earth’s tranquility in Kun’s softness;
Looking up, one beholds Heaven’s clarity in Qian’s Dao.
Floating and sinking, their positions manifest in the center,
Merging with the Void, sun and moon shine brightly.

Within, purify the mind-ape to nurture the pearl of nature;
Without, subdue the intent-horse to refine the path of darkness.
The numinous light pierces the Golden Crow’s cavern,
Merging into perfect clarity, the body unites with the Great Void.

Gently strike the jade lock, the grotto gate opens,
A pair of divine winds rush through the doorway.
With intent, embrace the simurgh and soar to the Moon Palace,
Beneath the Yinless Tree, wander at leisure.

The four leaky vessels ultimately return to illusion,
Only the perfectly luminous nature is not yet true.
Wait until your name is inscribed in the Jade Empyrean,
Only then shall you truly embody the one who has left the household.

Cloudy mists scatter as dawn’s frost glistens,
In the clear night, dustless, the moon is full.
Seated, one draws near the jasper palace,
Within ninefold radiance, the Golden Immortal is borne aloft.

Kan and Li unite, breaking free from the dusty world’s confines,
Sun and moon exchange their light, illuminating the body.
Water and fire refine the Leakless Child,
The precious vase cradles the Jade Flower Infant.

Golden crystals rain through the jade window,
The Hua Yang Immortal enters the Central August.
The Lesser Weaving Star falls to the clear river’s depths,
The crane presses the treetops, snow dusts the frost.

The waters are pure, fishless, waves touch the sky,
The numinous spirit flies away, entering the Essence Abyss.
Hua Yang does not follow the red dust’s path,
For the divine wind naturally merges with the Great Mystery.

*Supreme Clarity and Great Mystery Collection, Scroll Six Concludes*
*Supreme Clarity and Great Mystery Collection, Scroll Seven*

**Seven-Character Verses by Gu Shehou Shanyuan**

Kan and Li intertwine, merging the sacred mechanism,
Two paths sever the way, linking to Heaven’s frontier.
The celestial cycle ten thousand times returns, the dragon assumes its stance,
The earth a thousand fathoms deep, the tiger displays its might.

Driving back external demons, eradicating the six harms,
Seizing the retreating yin ghosts and the Three Worms.
From between the brows, the toad sword is drawn,
With a single slash, floating clouds mend the leaky pond.

Carefree and untroubled, delighting in pure leisure,
Leading cranes, bearing staffs, wandering water and mountain.
Wind rolls emerald mist across verdant peaks,
Moonlight and gentle haze reach the blue ridges.

Before the grotto, water bursts forth like a thousand pearls,
Beneath the ravine, clouds congeal into a ball of snow.
Luminous and crystalline, the Dao-eye shines,
Divinely clear and refreshing, chilling all who approach.

In the primal chaos, the Two Modes first parted,
The Three Powers transformed, root of creation.
Ascending and descending, sun and moon soar,
Floating and sinking, Qian and Kun stand firm.

Jade fragments drift down from the void,
Golden elixir grains surge upward in reverse.
Two azure lads roam the green peaks,
Embracing the simurgh, they fly into the Gate of the Great Mystery.

Suddenly, the nature awakens to the true source,
Instantly, the heart-pearl connects everywhere.
Unfettered and pure, returning to refined delight,
Mighty and spiritually refined, washing away dust and delusion.

Clouds withdraw, revealing the moon in the deep pool,
Mists disperse, and the primordial wind arises.
Supremely all-knowing, pervading the ten directions,
Perfectly luminous, the solitary body illumines the void.

Splitting open chaos to reveal Heaven’s heart,
The essence of sun and moon fills the Great Yin.
The Dipper’s handle turns, heaven and earth rain,
The Dharma wheel revolves, the Great Void deepens.

Intermingling light emits a thousand pearls,
Chaotic things welcome ten thousand specks of gold.
The supreme treasure needs no search beyond,
Nurturing spirit and awareness, the Dao takes its course.

Embracing constancy, knowing contentment, the primordial spirit is restored,
Delighting in ease and tranquility, the utmost truth is cultivated.
Eradicating sharpness, eliminating greed, the Dao is fully realized,
Dispelling the blade, gazing into the mystery, the eternal body is renewed.

Externally seeking jade and pearls brings no true worth,
Internally cleansing the sacred casket is never impoverished.
Where does the crane’s chariot, borne on the whirlwind, alight?
Within the grotto, only the four seasons renew.

Ever preserve the will, severing false splendor,
Returning to reflect on the Dragon Realm, the Purple Mansion.
In the indistinct, the primordial spirit surges through vast qi,
In the profound darkness, true breath radiates crimson mist.

The Jade Pool’s waves are pure, golden pistils float,
The Azure Sea’s ripples are clear, jade blossoms drift.
Fragrance unfurls, heaven and earth gleam,
From the congealed void, night-bright sand flies.

Divine fire blazes fiercely on Mount Gen,
With a single thrust from the tail gate, the Three Passes open.
The colossal image of heaven circles the void,
The sea-blending flood dragons coil beyond all things.

Congealing in one crucible, the marrow of heaven and earth,
Fusing in two cauldrons, the liver of the Great Yang.
Those who awaken to this ascend as immortals,
Riding the Yi, mounting the true, straddling the colored simurgh.

Turning the Dipper’s handle, moving the numinous pivot,
The Great Being’s gate opens—nothing remains.
Externally embracing the primordial Dao of Heaven,
Internally concealing two scrolls of life-giving scripture.

From nothingness, a thousand layers of jade are built,
In emptiness, ten thousand pearls are adorned.
With merit and practice both complete, transcending the world,
Riding the whale, stepping steadily toward Yingdu.

Vastly opening the wisdom eye, revealing the clear gaze,
The two wings of divine wind chase the sun’s head.
In the Ren-Wu clouds, riding the jade elephant,
In the Ding-Gong sea, straddling the golden ox.

Crimson mist curls around the Dragon Pavilion,
Purple haze swirls thickly around the Phoenix Tower.
Should one ask what blessed land this is,
The azure lad respectfully reports: it is Yingzhou.

Curbing desire, removing passion, the will stands firm,
The barren wilderness of the quail transforms into fields of lingzhi.
The heart like the azure Han, probing the moon in the deep pool,
The nature like the red furnace, a lotus within the flame.

Roaming and feasting beyond the true realms of Supreme Clarity,
Lingering in the primordial Great Luo Heaven of Yuanshi.
The Central August names me the Double Mystery Child,
The Gu She immortal dwells as the Primordial Transcendent.

Reversing yin and yang is true cultivation,
A single torrent of the Yellow River flows backward.
Ten thousand strands of white light pierce the corners of the universe,
A thousand threads of crimson flame emerge from mountain peaks.

The sun’s soul gleams brightly, manifesting everywhere,
The moon’s spirit radiates brilliantly, circling all directions.
Greatly unfolding the majestic wind, opening the ancient Dao,
Riding the simurgh, wielding the sword, roaming the nine heavens.

**Ode to Nurturing Spirit**
In true emptiness, the child-mother mechanism is complete,
Ghosts and spirits intermingle, penetrating the mud pill.
The Two Modes and the Great Beginning must return to one—
The Dao of the Three Essentials.

The six directions share a single path—
The mechanism of the six harmonies.
The nine qi, profoundly mysterious, are the body beyond—
The Dao of the nine yang.

The celestial flow and heavenly water are the central symbol—
The mechanism of the upper pivot.
One must rely on the essentials, the master’s clear teaching,
The most profound explanation of the Double Mystery.

**Ode to the Mysterious Image**
Vaguely, the divine transforms, the Jade Pass opens,
A single point of fetal light descends upon the wisdom terrace.
Naturally, the brilliance of Li and Yang shines,
Returning the light to the origin, the flame glows white.

The Double Mystery’s wondrous pointer is hard to fathom,
The gate of all wonders—fools cannot guess.
Serene, it may exist, approaching the morning audience with the Emperor,
Embracing the heart-moon, hastening to Penglai.

**Ode to Cultivating Nature**
In the indistinct, departing for the Toad Palace to nurture the nature-embryo,
The hidden dragon bathes the cinnabar embryo beneath the waters.
One must know that guarding the dark is the root,
Naturally, the numinous radiance illuminates the nature-terrace.

Within chaos, the Great One is revealed,
In the profound darkness, the heart’s brilliance is unfathomable.
One should follow where the wisdom-soul and yang arise,
The resplendent mystery-pearl moves of itself.

**Ode to Heavenly Auspices**
The Heavenly Treasure is naturally so, without contrivance,
Abandoning wisdom, leaving form, preceding the ten thousand transformations.
Leaving nature to accompany emptiness, light pervades all,
Moving spirit, gazing into the mystery, the Jade Heaven gleams.

Allowing things and self to become illusory,
Naturally, starry radiance shines before the eyes.
The sea-moon contains brilliance, light in ten thousand strands,
Transforming into the Heavenly Auspicious Jade Pot Immortal.

Qian’s origin, benefit, and harmony reveal my spirit,
The five qi ascend to the origin, employing the utmost truth.
The *Zhouyi*’s opening and closing clarify movement and change,
The ten thousand mechanisms converge, emerging from the dust.

Following the mechanism, responding to all, observing the mysterious image,
All day, diligently, drawing near to the Dao.
Internally and externally crystalline, penetrating inside and out,
The numinous radiance adorns me, hastening to Pengying.

**Hidden-Head Poems**
Qi intermingles, the ten thousand things flourish—know this,
The eye’s qi refines the true, the yin soul scatters—awareness.
The Yellow Palace’s chambers, the Dao is complete within the Great—
The four enter the numinous emperor, images gather in the void.

Opening, returning to the hour, awakening the drunken soul—treasure bright,
The grotto’s gate gleams, the three mountains gather mist—clear.

**Again**
Dwelling in solitude near the forest springs, the jade stream,
A thousand years of bitter practice rely on the heart’s deep rectitude.

The Three Perfections’ wondrous form—vainly slight in record’s light,
In primordial chaos, immortals soar, transformations fill the vast expanse.
Things refine within, naturally merging with Heaven’s diligence—
Luminous brilliance shines on both, yet formless is the Way.

**Lyrics to "Fragrant Incense"**
Heaven and earth, dark and yellow, follow transformations, unforced.
The Great Void’s heights—sun and moon take flight.
Dragon musk and starry Dipper, phoenix ignites the Mysterious Net.
Behold the sea’s divine tides, the river’s spirit convenes, the valley’s power unfurls.

Resplendent, radiant, illuminating the ten directions.
Merging the Three Palaces, with one shake, yang currents flow.
Not apart from daily use, here and now, receive and uphold.
Gradually return to true emptiness, revert to true correctness, attain true constancy.

**To the Tune of "Lesser Layered Mountains"**
Yin and yang inverted—a single thunderclap.
Suddenly startled from sleep, awakened within the dream.
Deluded clouds brushed away, wisdom’s light unfolds.
Following the wind, embracing the sun’s orb, I come.

Tempering nurtures the immortal embryo.
In emptiness, clearly manifest, surpassing the numinous terrace.
Gazing all around—above and below—at Penglai.
Worthy to return to the jade grotto as immortal talent.

**To the Tune of "Intertwined Branches"**
Blunting sharpness, no shame; encountering favor, no joy.

Amidst gentle softness and ordinary ease, flow with conditions and pass by—unfettered and at peace.
Strolling through forests and springs, deep into emerald clouds,
I delight in a lifetime of pure leisure.
Should one wish to transcend birth and death,
to grasp that truth of eternal constancy:
Refine qi into spirit, spirit soars beyond the azure vault,
one with the Great Void.
Roam boundless heaven and earth, forever free from care—
attain longevity and enduring vision.

**Two Poems to the Tune of "A Sprig of Plum Blossoms"**
One in worldly toil, one in ceaseless haste.
Since parting, one attains true constancy.
One day of radiant essence, one day of cool clarity—
a single gleam of pure light,
a single band of congealed yang.
One qi intermingles, one qi expands.
One binds the elixir of spirit, one extends life’s span.
One numinous spark enters one cloud-chamber—
a pair of golden youths,
one guides to the immortal realm.

Again:
Lightly breaking from the world, tender green branches grow.
Unlike the pine and bamboo, they alone endure frost and wind.
A heart steadfast through winter’s cold—auspicious sign.
Tiny buds first bloom,
outshining all other fragrances.
Let not the graceful one overstep the powdered wall.
Let Huan Yi play his flute—
what harm in his artful strains?
Nature’s beauty unfolds in golden splendor.
Peerless charm, pure and rare—
the fragrance of a single sprig of plum.

**Two Poems to the Tune of "Voicing Hidden Feelings"**
Yin and yang cycle—let no deviation arise.
Hold to correctness, let not the heart stray.

Perpetual tending of the alchemical furnace and crucible,
Dragon and Tiger stir the Three Carts.
Gather the divine water, refine the essence’s splendor,
congeal the numinous cinnabar.
Within the crystal palace,
jade hare and golden rooster
spit forth blossoms of jade radiance.

Again:
One day’s autumn hues, emerald as if painted.
The wild goose trills its high song.
Mountains resplendent, waters bright—mirroring each other,
mist-laden trees reflecting on the brook’s bridge.
White waves surge,
cloud-waves billow,
brushing the light robe.
Returning, deep in intoxication,
until dusk descends,
moonlight cresting the pine boughs.

**To the Tune of "Tang Duoling"**
Cease this bitter striving for silks,
how long does a human life endure?
Alas—these hundred years,
but a dream of Nanke.
Wealth and honor, fame and achievement—all as one desires,
yet none escape the grindstone of death and life.
*Ye luo.*

Follow your portion, nurture harmony with heaven,
yang flourishes, the crucible brims full.
Within, simmer and seethe,
congealing the numinous waves.
Refine the golden elixir until its light suffuses the body,
merge into one qi,
pervading the sahā world.
*Ye luo.*

**Four Returning Songs**
The Way of long life,
in daily practice abides in emptiness.
One qi first divides, clearly moving and still,
the Three Powers transform, revealing sinking and floating.
The jade hare pursues the spirit crow.

Rumbling through the cosmos,
a single strike shatters the dark thoroughfare.
Light pierces the White Tiger’s brow on Three Mountains,
flames fly from the twin strands of the Red Dragon’s whiskers,
illuminating the night-shining pearl.

Again:
The work of cultivation—
sever love, cut off entanglements.
Body purified, heart cleansed, the Dao-eye bright,
within, uphold the untainted, qi and spirit whole.
True mercury refines true lead.

Set the furnace and crucible,
proceed with fire, let it simmer and boil.
Gently ladled, hammered into flakes,
round and round, congealed into a precious pearl.
Beyond the body, transform into a flying immortal.

The True Constant Dao,
in daily practice pervades the three thousand worlds.
Vast, it encompasses beyond heaven and earth;
small, it circles even a grain of sand or mustard seed.
In every thing, the Mystery is fully known.

Mighty spiritual power,
within the undifferentiated, moves in ceaseless return.
Shattering empty space into seven or eight fragments,
a luminous pearl rolls forth from the sea turtle’s edge.
Its light joins the flaming demon-heaven.

Again:
Forsake worldly thoughts,
all the ten thousand kinds are utterly empty.
Singing by the pillow, sleeping at night, dreams of wandering cease;
half a window’s bright moon, a curtain’s breeze.
Gently, one awakens in a hazy drowse.

Donning robes, sitting,
at once beholding the original countenance.
In the quiet chamber, radiance arises, vast qi surging;
in the empty hall, auspicious signs reveal divine work.
Light shines within the jade flask.

*Jiangshenzi*
The cinnabar flower vainly clings to a false frame,
long buried, inviting misfortune and calamity.
Tiny mayflies, all are pressed by death and life.
Suddenly awakening, knowing self and other perish,
letting form and emptiness come before the eyes.

The golden crow beneath the sea first appears,
the azure sky opens, free of the slightest dust.
Light densely spreads across the heavens,
brilliant light returns before the face.
Intertwined splendor—jade-like youths outshine jade,
like snow reflecting a single plum branch.

*Shengshengman (Seven Poems)*
The human heart is hard and stubborn,
unwilling to turn back.
Deeply submerged in the bitter sea, lingering.
Wine, sex, wealth, and qi—never forsaken,
when will it ever end?
Hearing early, seek the path of return,
joyfully drifting like clouds and water.
No entanglements, no vexations, no sorrows,
no joys, no cares.

Gradually entering the cool, living practice,
embracing heaven’s true purity, a single qi harmonious and gentle.
Matching frost-like lead, repeatedly gathering transformations within the crucible.
Gently, the golden elixir gradually congeals;
later, the work complete, seizing immortality’s companions.
Worthy of returning,
riding the phoenix and crane, ascending to
the Purple Court and Penglai Isles.

Again:
The heart floats, easily moved,
familiar scenes hard to forget.
Hurried all day long, restless.
Already past middle age,
like the fading light of dusk.
Just as a dying lamp fears dawn,
like wind-blown withered leaves turning yellow.
Most bitter is the sigh—
as stars shift and things change,
one is seized by impermanence.

Seeing through, seek the path of return,
knocking earnestly at the Mystery Gate,
discussing the immortal’s recipe.
Entrusted with intimate transmission,
calm the heart, in the quiet chamber ponder deeply.
Polish the ice-like platform until it gleams,
revealing divine light, merging into the numinous yang.
Perfectly bright and manifest,
attaining long life and enduring vision,
eternal peace and well-being.

Again:
Time swiftly passes,
like ants in an endless cycle.
Back and forth, unbroken in succession.
A year gone by,
unaware, another year has already come.
Suddenly, the limit of impermanence arrives—
what can one delay in the journey ahead?
The work of cultivation:
others may have a share,
but oneself has no fate for it.

If one turns back in awakening,
forsaking fame, wealth, and honor,
detached beyond the world.
Preserve the original essence,
in the jade furnace, simmer flakes of snow.
Vaguely, heaven and earth become radiant and clear,
brilliant and translucent, the sun’s light dazzling.
The Three Lights shine,
blending the one numinous true nature,
escorting it to the Jade Heaven.

Again:
The busy fool, burdened and dull,
unaware of others’ praise.
Wildly chasing absurdities, acting recklessly.
Stubborn and witless,
vainly seeking, wildly guessing.
Hasty words, empty quarrels,
battling ignorance, galloping in strange perversities.
Forcing ruin,
blocking others, burying oneself.

If one awakens to the celestial mechanism’s secret,
knocking once at the Mystery Pass,
the jeweled cavern’s gate opens.
The jade maiden and golden youth,
entering and exiting, nestling side by side.
Naturally, yin and yang unite,
in the void, giving birth to an immortal embryo.
The True Person appears,
leaping over the turtle palace and sun hall,
roaming freely at will.

Again:
Hard and soft, strong and weak,
good and evil clearly distinguished.

The responses of Heaven and Earth differ:
Those who muddy the Way to flaunt prosperity,
while the steadfast and virtuous languish in poverty.
The wondrous Dao of purity and non-action
is slandered by fools as a heretical gate.
How can they understand?
To those true cultivators who refine themselves,
they appear as enemies.
The lofty Dao is suspected as theft and banditry,
while the vicious and stubborn are deemed worthy.
Adorned in fine robes and sashes,
versed in etiquette, yet blind to rank.
The masses learn only to brawl,
heedlessly debating human ethics.
All is swept aside—
cloud-patterned robes and hairpins exchanged
for a simple headscarf.

Again:
Wisdom and folly intermingle,
right and wrong entangled in the thicket,
clear and turbid matters urgently confused.
How many, in ignorance,
speak recklessly, indulging in absurdities?
The phoenix chick is called a sparrow,
the sacred *chun* tree mistaken for a morning mushroom.
Even if one were as eloquent as Sui He or Lu Jia,
there would be no door for reasoned debate.
Niu Que feigns benevolence and righteousness,
while Xiang Wu, eyes locked, obscures his celestial truth.
Blind men groping an elephant,
day and night, unaware of light or dark.
The jade chime is used as cooking fuel,
the sacred *hulian* vessel treated as a mere mortar.
Most grievous of all—
jade zithers burned, phoenix plumes boiled,
the qilin and unicorn slain in error.

Again:
Time flies swiftly,
summer departs, winter arrives,
suddenly announcing another new year.
Forms shift, appearances change,
all silently worn away in obscurity.
Who realizes that each person grows older,
youthful verdancy replaced by silver hair and aged countenance?
Wasted away,
like fallen blossoms and drifting catkins,
gone with the flowing water, never to return.
Yet if one turns the light inward,
stirring the spiritual pivot with a single strike,
shattering the twin barriers,
the luminous pearl of the sea shines,
its radiant flame connecting with Kunlun’s peak.
The jewel of inherent nature illuminates the body,
transforming the mortal frame,
nurturing the immortal elixir.
The Jade Dawn appears,
soaring through the central heavens,
transcendent and free beyond the worldly.

**Nan Ke Zi**
A thousand things exist before awakening,
the heart opens to nothingness.
In the struggle between being and non-being,
awareness suddenly clarifies the void.
Within the chaos, yang pours forth,
a single point piercing the celestial crow.
Auspicious vapors coil in the golden crucible,
auspicious smoke plays in the jade vessel.
In the jade vessel and golden crucible,
the spirit pearl is refined.
Its light, resplendent as flowing clouds,
slowly ascends to the celestial Wu.

**Tian Zi Cai Sang Zi**
Withdraw early from the thicket of fame and profit,
I urge you to turn your heart,
cutting off all dissipation.
When stirred, the demon hordes are instantly subdued—
do not let them encroach.
The nine worms slain, the three corpses destroyed,
entrusting yourself to the Dao,
who then is your confidant?
On a clear night, dustless, the moon climbs the peak,
gazing toward the grove of *qian* trees.

**Jian Zi Cai Sang Zi**
Alas, this bodily form—
a hundred deceptions,
twisted into wild perversities.
Now awakened, I seek the path of return,
pure as ice, flawless as jade,
soaring to towering heights,
why cling to the vulgar cliff?
The heart, still as an ice terrace,
its spiritual light lustrous,
untouched by the slightest dust.
Suddenly, another wondrous truth emerges—
□ and *sheng* unite as one,
ascending through the mysterious, feather-transformed,
shedding the mortal husk.

**Ta Suo Xing (Two Poems)**
Within primordial chaos,
traces vanish into the boundless.
From the vast expanse of *hongmeng* and *mingxing*,
the universe first unfolds.
In the hollow void, a single sun-star,
its divine wind and qi expanding in majesty.
Graceful as ice-formed flesh,
jade cliffs stretch across the azure.

A crane startles heaven and earth—
a single bird soaring.
Not merely traversing the Great Void,
it shatters a thousand walls of Mount Jing.
Moreover, nurturing *qi* and preserving spirit,
its essence grows firm and unyielding.
How could the muddled vessel of mortal form comprehend?
The pearl of the heart leaps into the Great Void,
the Jade Infant’s divine transformations unlocking the gates of mystery.
Chasing away the Golden Crow,
pursuing the Jade Hare’s return,
congealed yang refines and ascends in immortal flight.
Pure tones and fragrant breezes escort its farewell from the Jasper Terrace,
as the Perfected One, drunk, reclines in Penglai’s affairs.

**The Oxherd**
Essence depleted, soul scattered, spirit adrift.
Heavenly truth warped into delusion.
Chasing appearances, the nature dims,
adrift in the bitter sea, rushing and wandering.
The path ahead—how treacherous to navigate.
I urge you all: cultivate the Supreme Dao early.
The Supreme Dao pervades all knowledge, luminous,
its radiance outshining Li Lou and Huan the Master.

**Yu Meiren**
Within the Cavern Origin, a single point of celestial light,
luminous and pure as a thousand suns.
Silver rosy clouds shimmer, threading through the earthly realm.
Myriad spirits gather in awe,
suddenly, boundlessly bright.
From the void emerges an embryonic immortal,
graceful as the wind’s drift.
It strikes open the heavens’ vault, ascending through clouded jade,
where jeweled towers and jasper pavilions
inscribe its name upon the Jade Register.

**Dao Lian Zi (Two Poems)**
Speak of the Golden Elder,
discourse on the Yellow Matriarch—
naturally paired, they refine harmony.
Molten cinnabar fills the crucible,
abundant and overflowing.
Divine light manifests,
illuminating the Celestial River.
A single point of fetal radiance emerges from the vast waves,
revealing the Three Clarities,
ascending to the Great Luo.

**True Lead and Mercury,**
Kan and Li in harmony.
Two reversed, yet naturally fitting.
Refining the golden elixir,
radiant as the sun’s brilliance.
Penetrating the profound mystery,
attaining the subtle and hidden.
The Crimson Maiden and Infant ever ride dragon and tiger.
Ascending to the Immortal Capital,
uniting with the sacred mechanism.

**Four Jade Tablets (Two Poems)**
A single point, luminous and pure,
like ice and jade, unsullied.
Through kalpas unborn, undying,
transcending ancient and present without pause.
Gazing boundlessly,
true emptiness gathers all.
Only then is the wondrous key understood—
the profound principle few discern.
Two paths diverge at Caoxi’s node,
mirrored in water, the moon in empty sky.

Again,
Within the false, the true is sought—yet the true essence differs.
Wisdom’s illumination pierces the vast heavens.
The sun gleams, the void crystalline,
spirit-light enfolding all.
Sealed in azure vastness,
congealed in emerald hue.
Attaining this, the heart opens to the wondrous key,
self and other both dissolve.
Beyond birth and death, in endless clarity,
there is yet another—
the eternal moon in boundless sky.

**Willow Branches (Seven Poems)**
Reclining, coiled in stillness, gazing into the precious mirror,
eyes without flaw.
Purified vision, like an infant’s,
upright in bearing.
Ask where this night leads—
to the immortal’s tryst.
A boat laden with emptiness returns by moonlight,
ascending to the Jasper Pool.

Again,
Within, the compass and square reveal the root of the lineage,
the Dao flows through.
In solitude, abiding in the Primordial Palace,
awakening to true emptiness.
Gazing above and below—nothing remains,
with whom to share?
Roaming freely, seated alone in moonlight,
accompanied by the pure wind.

Again,
Suddenly perceiving the round and bright, the image of ease,
mystery without end.
Auspicious mist drifts into the Jade Clarity Palace,
the moon hangs in the void.
Nature’s essence, naturally pure, the ancient Dao—
with whom to share?
Willow branches set in a precious vase,
a fine family tradition.

Again,
Precious nature perfected, rising and descending in harmony,
inwardly probed to its depths.
Threefold misty radiance illumines the Jade Palace,
flames soaring into the void.
The Jade Yang’s clarity refines the precious sign,
naturally harmonized.
The Valley Spirit soars within the Primordial,
playing in the immortal’s wind.

Again,
Who has seen the western dawn’s brocade adornments,
a scene beyond compare?
Mist-wreathed willow banks reflect the slanting sun,
a realm of water and clouds.
The home mountain lies near, yet none approach—
what wondrous scenery!
Stepping into emptiness, ascending to the azure chamber,
the grotto-heaven endures.

Again,
The crane’s nature, lofty and far-reaching, climbs beyond,
passing Tong Pass.
Deep autumn, rain cleared, robes suddenly thin,
water and clouds chill.
How could one bear the taint of fame and profit in years past?
Better to return early.
In the twilight, villages fade into the mist,
gazing toward home.

Again,
In the year of Mao, a tumbleweed drifting to distant mountains,
water and clouds at leisure.
Know that a thousand ages weary of the human realm—
longing to return.
Exchanging bones, shedding the fetal husk, retracing the old path,
restoring youthful countenance.
Stepping into emptiness, ascending to the ancient Star Altar,
riding the cloud-phoenix.

**Farewell to a Hundred Masters (Willow Branches)**
Wild cranes and solitary clouds depart and return,
hard to detain.
Heart-rending, the bond of love’s two passions,
tears like scattered beads.
After autumn, the homeward path is desolate and distant—
hasten the climb.
By Luoyang’s misty shores, willow-fringed banks,
gazing toward home.

**Crossing the Mountain Stream**
A man’s single resolve—
never let the initial aspiration wane.
In decisive rectitude, hold fast to integrity,
casting aside all reckless impulses.
Following conditions, letting fate take its course,
clouds and water as livelihood.
Beneath green pines, amid emerald bamboo,
lies a true and savory taste.

Serene and empty, tranquil and still—
this is the plan for the remainder of life.
Qi settled, spirit naturally harmonized,
advancing the mysterious pearl, emerging from Kan’s position.
Glowing crimson, faintly entering Li’s palace,
connecting above and below,
illuminating the ten directions,
gathering all realms into the heart’s ground.

**Nocturne (Four Poems)**
Earth, water, fire, wind—the four great elements,
for you, a hundred harms arise.
Let each depart in its own way,
and my Dharma-body becomes light and free.
At ease, at ease—
transcending the three realms in wondrous transformation.

Again,

Old friends—no word from any,
alone I sit by ancient cliffs, who shares my silence?
Turning my head toward the river homeland,
scattered auspices drift like duckweed, nearly touching.

Grief and resentment,
grief and resentment—
a single leaf of wind-sail carries me lightly away.

Again,

Facing the southern bank of the green stream,
endless flowing water and falling blossoms.
Turning my head through the mist of fine weather,
my Dao-companions fade from sight.

A long sigh,
a long sigh—
a single leaf of wind-boat gently drifts.

Again,

A man of integrity, resolute and pure,
beyond this, no distinction remains.
The solitary moon stands ever-round,
merging into the jade-green pool, limpid and clear.

Congealing, congealing—
purer than ice and snow in a jade vessel.

**Night Travel Boat (Two Poems)**

Tiger far, Heavenly Stem swallows Phoenix Tail.
The fire-wheel turns, Mount Gen begins to rise.
Pouring into the cauldron, flames blaze,
boiling the divine water—
the union of earth’s essence and heaven’s marrow.

Refining the pure yang elixir to suffuse the body,
exchanging the mortal frame to depart the dusty world.
Hastening the crane-chariot,
following immortal companions,
we ascend at dawn to Jade Purity’s Primordial Beginning.

Again,

Vows declared, heartfelt words spoken,
all things and sentiments cast aside in haste.
Heart and mouth at odds,
unable to discern truth from falsehood—
undoing the return to the mysterious gate’s achievement.

Indulging the will in wrongdoing, hard to admonish,
karma deep and transgressions boundless.
In the cold night’s wind-knives,
ghosts and spirits tug and provoke—
how can you not tremble with fear?

**Welcoming Immortals**

The Dao is not distant,
though Kunlun stands between.

**In Meditative Repose**

In silent sitting, the spirit probes the profound.
Within this cultivation—no schemes, no strategies.
A single gleaming speck of gold,
its jewel-bright radiance blazing in the furnace.
Plucked, the sacred lingzhi;
harvested, the coiled peach.
Auspicious qi flows, filling the purple paths.
Jade lads chant,
golden youths clap.
White cranes and azure simurghs,
clustered in welcome for the immortal guest.

**Two Poems of Grotto-Heaven Spring**

The Dao’s essential immortal mechanism—
sudden awakening alone reveals it,
all things cast aside without remainder.
Behold the original, single nature,
piercing the vastness of heaven’s expanse,
lucid as autumn’s moon,
pure as a cold spring.
Deep and limpid, utterly still,
not a mote of dust clings—
entering and exiting the Dragon Realm,
the Purple Palace of Heaven.
At the return to the origin,
it answers to the Boundless, the Great Beginning,
before the vast kalpas of time.

The Primordial One’s qi stretches unbroken,
heedless of summer’s heat or winter’s cold,
unchanging through all shifts.
Like the great void—
subtle, dense, flawless—
though the three disasters and kalpas crumble,
it remains serene as ever.
Thus in emptiness there is no birth or death,
from the most ancient past,
eternally enduring, ageless.
The true and constant Dao—
this is the Mysterious Origin’s Sage Ancestor,
transmitted through ten thousand generations.

**Again**

At the first division of creation,
a single transformation: the hidden dragon,
the undifferentiated splits into the Two Modes.
Behold the sun’s essence, the moon’s marrow,
congealing lead, binding mercury,
yin and yang in reversal,
tiger leaping, dragon soaring.
The hexagrams of Pi and Tai alternate,
Zhun and Meng return—
the *Yi*’s images emerge from Kan and Li.
Pure and refined,
it illumines the ignorant and the fledgling,
transmuting them into radiant clarity.

How vast and wondrous, the supreme Dao!
Yet who would turn their heart back to the old gate?
The earth’s great turtle bears aloft the vault of heaven,
where towering peaks stand proud,
a solitary moon casts its limpid glow.
Seas stilled, skies empty,
no flying dust intrudes—
the crisp qi, the spirit’s clarity, the marvelous mechanism.
The path to the true opens,
the mortal frame exchanged for one resplendent,
riding the wind to return.

**Three Poems to "Court of Blossoms"**

Among the ten thousand things,
humankind is most noble,
holding within a single spark of the subtle and refined.
Most numinous, most sagely—
who in daily use perceives it?
Hidden or manifest, born or extinguished, flowing with change,
square or round, bending or straight—all meet the moment.
From its transformations,
whether walking, dwelling, sitting, or lying,
movement and stillness ever attend.

Suddenly,
light suffuses the body—
the True Person appears,
clad in a different majesty.
Jade hairpins and vermilion slippers,
sashes of jade pendants and brocade tassels.
A jeweled canopy, a phoenix chariot,
clouds of jade trailing,
the graceful True Consort.
Immortal music plays,
golden lads bear the goblets—
drunk as mud, they revel.

**Again**

Shedding the gross for the splendid,
returning to simplicity, restoring antiquity,
the root-source, once turbid, slowly clears.

Humble and modest, dwelling in depth,
what is worn need not be new to endure.
Contentment knows neither glory nor shame,
serene in mastery—neither hasty nor light.
Do you yet understand?
Existence and extinction, gain and loss,
advance and retreat—all like waxing and waning.
Thus,
wholly may the Dao be preserved:
from the heart, dross is cast out;
from the eyes, nails are drawn.
Dim pupils brighten like feathers in flight,
the empty valley shines in vast clarity.
Three qi intermingle in dense harmony—
pure yang descends,
illuminating form, liberating mind.
Condensing, returning to the source,
wind stills, waves settle,
bright moon gilds the earth and seas.

**Again**

Jade dust and numinous frost,
cloud essence in secluded purity—
the Three Treasures of primal chaos hold fullness.
Fullness, then return—
sun and moon pierce Kunming’s depths.
□ grasps the realm of round penetration,
qi descends in misty profusion,
heavenly treasures bloom as sacred infants.
Within this mystery,
five peaks send flying snow,
one dwells in the crystal city.
Divine jade opens the ancient path,
spirit winds shift with ease—
who guards the distant years?
I ponder my long flow, enduring vision,
the profound verses ever sincere.
Secretly transmitted elixir must transform the body;
from this, ascend to wander Huaqing’s halls.
Golden lads summon—
in the Jade Dawn Palace,
the self belongs to the Lesser Weaving Star.

---

**Four Western River Moons**

Still and solitary, the thatched hut stands free,
steep peaks seal mist and rosy clouds.
Beyond the sunlit pavilion, a single branch slants—
awaiting guests with clear tea and quiet words.
Silent sitting, effortless in purity,
not a speck of dust or sand clings.
The heart’s terrace, white as the lotus,
ever abides beneath the Western River Moon.

**Again**

To pore over a thousand scriptures is still too little;
to awaken to a single word is yet too much.

Within the cauldron of Great Void, refine the harmonious and tranquil.
Nurtured thus, a myriad of dark pearls coalesce.
Following principle, roam directly through the jeweled realm;
on the path of profound emptiness, traverse the starry river.
Ten thousand spirits gather, piercing the misty veil—
in oneness, no division of self and other.

---

**Again**
The Lesser Reclusion admits not a speck of dust;
the Great Permeation fills all directions.
Merged with the numinous expanse, boundless and vast—
one nature grasps the great image.
Within fire, white snow is forged;
in water, the crimson sun is nurtured.
The jade infant, wondrously transformed, rides phoenix and simurgh,
soaring into the moon above the Western River.

---

**Again**
Unwilling to seek within the self,
stubbornly grasping outward in ceaseless pursuit.
Clinging to lesser arts of side doors, long mired in delusion—
such folk are hard to save.
Like one who guards a tree awaiting a hare,
how much better to brave the snow astride an ox.
In the land of Hua Xu, roam at will—
at midnight, turn night back to day.

---

**Three Long Thoughts on Immortality**

Subtle within the profound—
mercury and lead.
Advance the fire, laboring as the cauldron seethes and boils.
Spirit-sand, round in every grain.
Inner work complete,
outer ascent to immortality.
Divine water flows deep, reversing course to ascend the heavens—
lightly borne on a single lotus leaf.

---

**Again**
The Dao is level and smooth.

**Nature’s Subtle Dependence**

Nature leans on the elusive—
water and fire conjoin, the low and the high.
Yin and yang meet in their own time.
Use the Flowery Pond,
bathe the jade-like flesh.
A radiant child soars beyond the heavens—
divine light illumines the Purple Tenuity.

**Again**

Moonlight Pool,
bathe the sacred tortoise.
From its mouth, auspicious clouds transform to jade rainbows—
spiritual radiance gleams in the Purple Tenuity.

Crimson robes gleam,
veiling skin like ice.
Graceful, it drifts on the wind beyond the heavens—
the Jasper Palace awaits its destined hour.

**Two Boating Songs**

Sharp as refined essence at night’s end,
yang’s flame and luminous splendor dispel evil.
The jeweled *Brahmā* crystal pierces the void with its gaze.
The cinnabar phoenix flourishes—
ten thousand spirits bow in submission.
The wondrous work of non-action unfolds naturally.
Weave the horned net without error.
Where are my companions?
None remain.
I speak to the clear wind and bright moon—
they are mine.

**Again**

From the primal depths, the mind refines to its end.
The boundless *wangxiang* governs good and evil.
Its dark scrutiny is impartial, never missing or erring.
Truth and falsehood—
all

**Ten Odes on the Skull by Gu Shehou Shanyuan**

**The Skull Is Not**
The skull is not, the skull is not—
a heap of white bones lies on the sandbank.
Where now are glory, wealth, and honor?
Only the white poplar and the ancient stele remain.

**The Skull’s Greed**
The skull was greedy, the skull was greedy,
well-versed in fame, profit, wealth, and desire.
Shattering worldly toil beyond the dust,
a single spirit’s true nature emerges from the clouded hermitage.

**The Skull’s Wrath**
The skull was wrathful, the skull was wrathful,
quelling the fire, stilling the heart, severing self and others.
Nurturing divine radiance to pierce the azure vault,
a day of emptiness cleanses the red dust.

**The Skull’s Delusion**
The skull was deluded, the skull was deluded,
seeing through all yet knowing nothing.
Embracing the one true awakened nature,
auspicious light softly rises in crimson robes.

**The Skull’s Sorrow**
The skull was sorrowful, the skull was sorrowful,
leaping free from fleeting splendor—all things cease.
Gazing upon the primordial Dao of heaven,
the moon of the empty heart illumines clear autumn.

**The Skull Knows**
The skull knows, the skull knows,
turning light inward in ineffable reflection.
Recognizing the original true face,
a single flash of spirit reaches the heavens.

**The Skull Laughs**
The skull laughs, the skull laughs,
shattering the mountain of attachment to seek the wondrous.
Surveying all beneath heaven, embracing the void,
round clarity endures through kalpas without depletion.

**The Skull Speaks**
The skull speaks, the skull speaks,
comprehending the subtle and formless with ease.
Nurturing the nameless in emptiness,
dim and distant, it merges with the cold radiance.

**The Skull Declares**
The skull declares, the skull declares,
a jade pillar pierces the heavens.
Ten thousand rays of rosy dawn lean on the firmament—
only then does the true heart awaken to its natural distinction.

**The Skull Rests**
The skull rests, the skull rests,
carefree and at ease, joy without sorrow.
Shedding its shell, it roams the celestial river,
riding the phoenix and crane to the Isles of Yingzhou.

---

**Following the Ancient Rhyme**

Earth’s *qi* billows and gradually congeals,
chaos spreads across the Milky Way, the heavens unlit.
Swept away by me, I raise my hairpin to gaze—
alone, the high void reveals the radiant sun’s clarity.

A sweep clears the azure sky, the universe stills,
brilliant, the Three Realms emerge from evening clouds.
From my embrace, I bring forth the full moon,
ten thousand forms arrayed without a single blemish.

Deluded clouds brushed away, the Three Mountains gleam,
worldly mists dispersed, the four horizons clear.
Beneath, the restless borders settle at last—
raising my head, the vast void shines in its entirety.

The sea of awakening, limpid as autumn waters,
the boundless void, serene as undisturbed waves.
The spirit youth presents flawless jade—
its radiance shines boundlessly, illuminating all.

Long concealed in gloom, heaven and earth darkened,
clouds gathered, mists amassed—suddenly, clarity.
Following the wind, I bring down the moon from the sky’s edge,
amidst the throng of ten thousand forms, it shines alone.

Extending my hand, I part the summit of the Milky Way,
the distant void expands, the great emptiness brightens.
The Primordial Qian grants me vast spiritual power—
flashing yang’s light, a thousand miles gleam.

---

**Following the Ancient Rhyme Again**

Suddenly, a single point grasps the true mechanism,
seizing the mysterious pearl, rare in the world.
Luminous and pure, unstained by dust,
incense burns in the golden tripod as coiled smoke ascends.

In the zither hall, silently pondering the mystery,
outside the gate, moss grows thick where few tread.
The Daoist abode is desolate, free of worldly things—
pine winds scatter fallen petals in disarray.

Comprehending the true essence, the highest mechanism,
in emptiness, faintly discerned, beyond the dust’s reach.
A single point of yang light pierces the void—
steadily riding the fragrant wind, cranes take flight in chaos.

I preserve one method to seize heaven’s mechanism,
mastering divine skill, unmatched in the world.
Spirit youths attend at the Jade Palace,
riding dragons over the Miluo River in flight.

Attaining the wondrous mystery beyond mysteries,
my family’s supreme Dao is exceedingly rare.
From emptiness, the nameless simplicity stirs—
a single spirit’s light soars beyond the heavens.

The golden gate turns the pivot of mechanism,
a few streaking stars emerge, rare in the world.
Divine power forces open the Qian and Kan positions,
shaking the vast sea, soaring to the heavens.

---

**Pervading All**
Pervading the ten directions, filling all with misty *qi*,
drifting down to the human realm, connecting everywhere.
Spirit harmonizes with the Dao’s depth, the blazing sun gleams,
nature aligns with the round sea, moon’s radiance like wind.

**Primordial Beginning**
The Heavenly Worthy establishes teachings throughout *Saha*,
universally saving sentient beings with the Dao’s harmonious *qi*.
Reflecting back to the origin, casting off the snowy waves,
returning light, jade dew scatters upon the starry river.

**Communing with the True**
Seeing through the illusory body of the skin-sack,
searching deeply for the mystery, leaping beyond the mortal cage.
Kan and Li ascend and descend, divine light flashes—
sun and moon conjoin, piercing the cauldron’s red.

**Substance and Function**
The Dao’s power and spiritual might pervade the great thousand,
formless and traceless, penetrating mountains and rivers.
At Caoxi’s waves, clear fish play—
the celestial shore’s waves pure, the sea of awakening profound.

**Turning from Awareness**
Sentient beings, unaware, waste their youth,
obscuring the luminous clarity of kalpas’ truth.
Restless, fierce, and stubborn, clinging fast,
the fire of ignorance ignites, indulging greed and wrath.

**Deluded from the True**
Before the eyes, sun and moon lie beyond the heavens,
the clear void obscured by veiling membranes.
Washing away the clamor of dust, returning to clarity,
the jade infant’s divine transformation pierces clouds and mist.

**Transformation**
A single *qi* in the primal void of the Great Beginning,
the high emptiness ablaze with dawn’s rosy glow.
Encompassing the cosmos without the slightest obstruction,
illuminating heaven and earth, wisdom’s power flows.

**Harmonious Fusion**
Auspicious smoke fills the gate, nurturing the golden pass,
the bellows and key of emptiness allow free passage.
Flowing mercury fills the cauldron to its brim—
cloudy waves surge high upon Jade Capital Mountain.

**Opening the Origin**
First issuing the primordial Dao’s *qi*,
within the pot, a single flavor simmers like snowflakes.
Flowing through, it irrigates the cauldron, the Jade Pool pure—
swallowing it whole, the body becomes utterly clear.

**Union**
Lead and mercury devour each other in the cauldron,
refining sun and moon, forging the void.
Kunlun’s fire blazes without smoke or flame—
nurturing the divine elixir, it shoots into the jade pot.

**Spiritual Abyss**
Vast and distant, the immortal source, deep as the sea’s eye,
twin springs gently ripple with water’s gold.
Dragons hidden in the pool’s depths, wind and waves stilled,
tigers crouch by the stream, ancient tones resonate.

**Gathering Transformation**
All become the great Dao’s transforming spiritual work,
gathering the mystery into the cauldron.
Refining the golden elixir to radiant purity,
a single pill seals the Five Luminous Palaces.

**Seizing the Mystery**
By the river, seizing the Black Dragon’s tail,
on the summit, overturning the White Tiger’s head.
Snatching a single night-shining pearl,
a thousand beams of light stream to the heavens.

**Dual Passes**
Spirit and demon commune, each with their own intent,
naturally, the heart settles, revealing true spirit.
Enabling the Crimson Maiden to play at Fusang,
allowing the Infant to frolic in the moon’s radiance.

**Ascent and Descent**
The Three Palaces ascend and descend, sprouting the spirit-sprout,
the crucible and tripod fly with frost, spitting emerald sand.
Radiance scatters, filling the heavens with blooming red pistils,
heaven and earth are sown with the fair golden flower.

**Illumination**
The Dao-eye gazes upon the sky—all is clarity,
the precious tripod levels the mercury within.
Red frost flakes drift past the golden gate,
white snow clusters descend upon the Jade Capital.

**Generation and Completion**
Yin and yang exchange by nature’s decree,
the myriad transformations arise from a single principle.
Attaining the One, unbound and truly free,
carefree and joyous in the mystery’s core.

**Perfected One**
The Perfected One of the Numinous Treasure holds a revered rank,
often ascending the lunar palace, leaping through the divine grove.
In the Three Clarities’ realm, roaming the vast expanse,
the jade pendants’ chime resounds across the four seas.

**Divine Transformation**
The Perfected One sits alone, hidden in the cloudy void,
condensing emerald mists to greet the distant court.
In stillness, the eyes gather moonlight’s glow,
jade lotuses array in two or three shoots.

**Fetal Radiance**
A single point of the celestial sphere—a shooting star falls,
illuminating the flask’s interior with flickering light.
Having refined the fetal immortal to return home,
eternally dwelling in the Three Clarities’ pavilion.

**Luminous Perception**
The fire-screen is parted, opening the Dharma-eye,
ignorance swept away, revealing the starry net.
The high heavens push forth a thousand heaps of jade,
the level earth surges with ten-thousand-zhang waves.

**Vast Embodiment**
Nameless, selfless, and formless,
as one body, gazing upon the ancient imperial capital.
Shallow wisdom and dull roots breed clinging views—
how could they know the light arrayed in the eye’s abyss?

**True Essentials**
The great mystery’s true awakening transcends worldly toil,
suddenly enlightened, the empty heart raises the Dao-eye high.
Naturally, jade lads attend the Purple Court,
in the lush heavens, riding a golden-furred steed.

**Mighty Spirit**
I embrace the celestial wind’s true primordial bones,
transformed by my master’s touch into immortal talent.
In the world, none match the copper-headed man,
dancing with the sword, its light cleaving the jeweled terrace.

**Immortal Cassia**
In the lunar palace, the cassia remains unpicked,
in the Purple Court, the peach blooms toward the sun.
These two treasures gathered and placed in the tripod,
their fragrance alike, perfuming the immortal steps.

**Blending of Things**
Congealed perfection densely reaches the azure heavens,
vast and lush, it hangs in the void, locking the emerald mist.
High above, the azure clouds roll back, opening the lunar palace—
the two barbarian gates’ feathered transformations array as golden immortals.

**Divine Sword**
Honed to three feet, sharp as frost and snow,
its sunlight rivals brilliance, flashing like lightning.
Last night at the third watch, it repaid vengeance,
the blue blade stained with the blood of apes.

**Seeing Through**
Wealth, fame, riches, and desire—do not rigidly seek,
when will the fiery household ever reach its end?
How much better to be a carefree cloud-and-water wanderer,
in the boundless void beyond, attaining true cultivation.

**Exiting the Pass**
A staff slung across the shoulder, bearing a giant alchemical gourd,
a cloud robe borne by the wind, crossing the floating bridge.
A sleeve conceals a three-foot blue-bladed sword,
severing hundreds of black dragons.

**Subtlety and Refinement**
Essence gathers in the subtle mystery, the Dao supremely bright,
shifting spirit through the mortal realm, delighting in purity.
A single yang enters the Three Flowers’ tripod,
two qi are gathered into the Seven Treasures’ vase.

**Water and Fire**
From the eastern sea, rolling flames scorch the sky,
from the western sea, settling waves congeal to crimson.
These two things blend to form heaven and earth’s splendor,
their essence shining throughout, harmoniously fused.

**Vast Wisdom**
The sword hews the golden mountain—spark and fire flow,
the Three Corpses perish together, the ten thousand ties dissolve.
I cast the boundless net into the sky,
scooping up the void, vast as the sun.

**Being and Nonbeing**
Within emptiness, seeking emptiness, recognizing emptiness,
suddenly, within emptiness, the divine power is seen.
From now on, red dust affairs are no longer questioned—
naturally, jade flowers fill the grotto.

**Autumn Night**
A single qi coils, floating beyond the Milky Way’s clarity,
the rustling night rain scatters autumn’s sound.
Ordinary people do not see the Moon Goddess’ cassia,
only I wander alone in the lunar palace.

**Mighty Radiance**
The ten thousand ties severed, all karma dissolved,
suddenly perceiving the wondrous mystery of the formless.
Several patches of dark clouds banished beyond the isles,
a heart-moon fills the empty sky.

**Primordial Harmony**
A single qi first divided, heaven and earth parted,
the Three Powers established forms, transforming the numinous mechanism.
Shifting the heart back into the golden chamber,
it produces a luminous pearl to illuminate the curtains.

**Correct Formula**
The *Dao and Virtue*, the *Yin Talisman*, the *Great Beginning*’s chapters—
students who do not comprehend vainly seek immortality.
Golden script and jade tablets are lightly cast aside—
how can they discern my master’s profound mystery?

**Tranquil Application**
Who in the mystery establishes the still mechanism?
Serene and constant, guarding the Great Abyss’ pool.
The sun’s wheel turns, opening the heart’s path,
heaven and earth are ever observed in minute detail.

**Extinguishing Thought**
Body still, heart clear, intent also clear,
within, constantly guarding the qi and spirit’s tranquility.
Dredging open the treasure trove, the mysterious pearl gleams,
its light illuminating Penglai’s myriad forms.

**Subduing the Dragon**
Rending open the heaven’s crown, roaming at will,
just then seeing the flood dragons frolic in the vast boat.
A great shout shatters mountains and seas—
the sword’s tip pursues the red dragon’s head.

**Divine Elixir**
A single flying elixir guards the upper realm,
the primordial spirit’s essence rivals the sun’s brilliance.
Fiery congealing flames burn the empty expanse,
frightening away the host of yin, all transformed to yang.

**Divine Power**
Pressing the sword, divine might surpasses Huayin,
gnashing teeth in fury, galloping with chest bared.
Piercing the brows, the myriad demons’ courage is shattered,
opening the eyes, the hundred monsters’ hearts are terrified.

**Penetrating the Mystery**
Detached from desire, the empty heart opens the wisdom-eye,
congealing the void, leaning on flawless jade.
The delicate emerald hue releases its splendor,
illuminating the ten directions—who knows contentment?

**Blending and Union**
Descending, the celestial soul; ascending, the earthly soul,
in harmony above and below, without flaw or blame.
The great square encompasses all, without corners,
jade walks and gold flies, interspersed and distinct.

**Lofty Merit**
The Dao and virtue’s pure name spreads to the sea’s edge,
the celestial kitchen bestows blessings, adding to good merit.
One day, soaring and ascending through the Milky Way,
rising into the cloud-deep, playing amidst the emerald mists.

**Divine Might**
By chance, bearing the sword to ascend the celestial net,
slaying a million hosts of yin spirits.
The jade hare startled, retreats to seek its burrow,
the golden crow flies up to the cassia branch.

**Numinous Power**
Seated, the flying sword gallops with divine might,
toppling the celestial net, leveling Mount Taihua.
Pulling down the lunar palace to seize the jade hare,
overturning the solar palace to capture the golden rooster.

**Departing and Descending the Sacred View**
Having become one with the enlightened, discerning truth from falsehood,
not aligning with the deluded, debating right and wrong.
One day, the elixir complete, flying through the cosmos,
the vast void’s boundless body is my return.

**Chen the Immortal Asks: Is the Empty Not Empty?**
The supreme Dao is formless, like the great void,
shifting spirit to blend with things, all bodies become one.
Though rivers and mountains reach their utmost number, they endure here,
heaven and earth’s boundlessness resides within.

**Jia the Immortal Asks: Is It Neither Empty Nor Existing?**

**Jia the Immortal Asks: Is It Neither Empty Nor Existing?**
Neither empty nor existing is perfect completion,
yet clinging to this perfection is but a provisional name.
Having realized the Supreme Mystery, true reality arises—
within appearances, no thing abides, serene and clear.

**Guo the Immortal Asks: The Mystery Within Mystery**
Inquiring the mystery within the mystery,
a mechanism stands beyond heaven, another heaven beyond.
From primordial chaos to the utmost bounds, no trace of obstruction,
the wondrous transformation pervades, the Great Awakened Immortal.

**Jue the Immortal Asks: The Profound and Obscure**
Profound, obscure, the essence in subtle vagueness,
spiritual might shatters heaven’s sinews and bones.
Congealing emptiness, vast and luminous,
standing alone between heaven and earth, not a single thing remains.

**Elder Liu Asks of Body and Function: Unaware of the Immortal Path**
The immortal’s function wields the celestial mechanism, its body vast and square,
congealed yang unfolds, radiating auspicious light.
The elder has already found the path of returning to truth,
unaware, he follows the wind into the imperial realm.

**Jiao the Young Immortal Asks of Renouncing the World**
Shaking off worldly passions, the karmic fire’s pull,
fame and fortune, wealth and honor—all swept away.
A man’s resolve stands firm, soaring to the heavens,
seizing the name to hang among the ranks of immortals.

**Elder Liu Asks of the Wondrous Function of True Emptiness**
True emptiness, the supreme Dao, leaves no trace,
its wondrous function nurtures the spirit, all phenomena as one.
Within the Great One’s flask, the bright moon is gathered,
in the Palace of Broad Cold, the pure wind plays.

**Dong the Immortal Asks of Unyielding Until Death**
Maintaining the original resolve to the very end,
until death, no path leads into the forest of transgression.
Ever guarding the elixir furnace, the three tripods of jade,
ever preserving the cinnabar crucible, the single flask of gold.

**Li the Immortal Asks of Neither Within Nor Without**
Externally, no form; internally, no cultivation,
the middle path departs from subtlety, abandoning all seeking.
All dharmas are swept away as one,
no idle matters strike the heart’s core.

Suddenly awakened, the mind’s pearl shines,
illuminating the dusty world—nothing remains.
The Daoist attains the essence as the true teaching,
the Chan monk calls this thusness.

eternally stabilizing heaven and earth, unshaken.

From youth, pure and steadfast as ice,

Awakened from sleep, the Dao’s eye opens,
startled in dreams, sudden perfect completion.

**[Answers to Questions]**
**Great Zhang the Immortal Asks: Not Dwelling in Mountains, Not Abiding in Hermitages—How to Suddenly Release?**
Thus I compose two verses in response.

Unbound to green mountains, not dwelling in hermitages,
the spirit soars beyond the heavens, emerging from mist and haze.
The crane follows the Purple Palace to pay homage to the Immortal Lord,
the phoenix leads the way to the distant sun to visit the Old Master.

Leaping beyond the thatched hut, not hiding in mountains,
carefree, trusting in the joy of tranquility.
Forever dwelling within heaven and earth,
embracing the moon, ever abiding between sky and land.

**Zhang the Immortal Asks of Not Observing False Appearances to Recognize the True Form**
A heap of foul decay is ultimately false,
the two points of light in the eyes are not worth pride.
To recognize the original source, the true Dharma-body,
observe beyond appearances as if a shooting star.

**[Answers to Questions]**
**Elder Qi Asks: The Goose in the Jar—Growing Large and Flying Out, Neither Harmed**
Born in seclusion, entering the jar,
undaunted, soaring like a phoenix with bold intent.
To ask how both are preserved, both attain sagehood—
the goose flies beyond the heavens, the precious jar remains full.

**Guo the Immortal Asks of Coolness Within Fire**
Flaming fire, blazing like sunlight,
form and spirit both wondrous, attaining coolness.
Eternally one with the Great Beginning, without increase or decrease,
having attained the Mystery’s origin, standing enduringly.

**Li the Immortal Asks of Realizing the Dao**
Meeting with a glance, the Dao is known and understood,
seeing through the emptiness of a thousand sutras and myriad dharmas.
Not dwelling in famous mountains, repeatedly bowing in inquiry,

strolling where fate leads.
If asked where I return,
I point afar to the winding riverbank.
Willow-lined shore,
half-shrouded in mist.
A sky newly clear.
The night hushed and pure,
no one about,
moonlight filling the empty boat.

**VI**
A sky of pure beauty, a stream of clouds,
wind and moon as near neighbors.
Qin, sword, wine, chess, calligraphy, painting—
as they come, delight in nature’s truth.
Bamboo fence gleams,
the thatched hall renewed.
Still, without dust.
Morning mushrooms unseen,
all around jade blossoms,
separated by the divine *chun* tree.

**VII**
How many through the ages have chased fame and gain,
discarding life to vie for merit?
Where have all the heroes gone?
All have sunk into emptiness.
Better than they—
I, in Dongting’s midst,
send my servant forth.
Lightly skimming the golden goblet,
drunk beneath the eaves,
one pillow of pure wind.

**VIII**
Beings of meager fortune delight in the *shravaka*,
diligently upholding merit.
Fasting, seated meditation, rites, and chanting—
all end in stubborn emptiness.
The true mark,
within being and nonbeing.
A fine family tradition.
Ancestor of the Mystery’s origin,
the gate of the Great Beginning opens,
embodying perfect clarity.

**IX**
Lord Ying, pure and aloof from worldly ties,
unshaken by fame and profit’s pull.
Carefree, dwelling wherever clouds and water lead,
knowing fate, delighting in nature.
Mastering the profound,
awakening to the subtle.
Diligently cultivating immortality.
When merit is complete, return,
leading you to audience at the Origin,
steadily treading the golden lotus.

**X**
The divine immortals’ wondrous art has been passed down,
but who grasps this subtle mystery?
Tortoise and snake breathe naturally,
the Mysterious Female’s qi flows endlessly.
Lead within mercury,
mercury within lead—
both complete.
Withdrawing and adding, increasing and decreasing,
advancing the fire’s work,
refining the immortal embryo.

**Ten Poems: "Magnolia Flower"**

**I**
The heartless sea of suffering,
where dust-choked beings drown in craving.
How unlike my home—
the silent grove and spring, apart from worldly splendor.

**II**
Nurturing truth, fostering vastness,
flesh and bone as ice-clear as jade.
Entering and exiting without gap,
graceful, drifting with the wind to ascend the heavens.

**III**
Deep roots, firm stem,
heavenly treasure, flowing rosy clouds—light fills the ford.
Reflected radiance stretches to the sky,
gently, step by step—profound, ever profound.
No birth, no death,
serene, solitary, bright and pure.
Dawn scatters the sparse clouds,
piercing the clear void to reach the ninth heaven.

**IV**
Autumn wind vast,
gazing afar—rosy clouds gleam, auspicious and bright.
Across the shore, reed blossoms,
veiled in mist, two or three homes.

**V**
Heavenly truth, lush and flourishing,
exiled to the world—light fills the chamber.
Preserving and protecting a thousand springs,
crimson-crested, green pine—longevity shared.

**VI**
At first devotion to the Dao,
strictly guarding essence, light returns in reflection.
The Primordial aids truth,
true things arise in the midst of vagueness.
Congealing in the empty vast,
bright moon and clear wind lean upon each other.
Attaining that carefree state,
turning back to wander beyond the mist and clouds.

**VII**
Five phases, four images,
*wu* and *ji* amassed—what form do they take?
Black water, red clouds,
white horse, green ox—divided in two.
Golden chariot, jeweled carriage,
the great Dao level, refining the jade thread.
The path like silver,
bearing the infant beyond the world’s dust.

**VIII**
Fame and wealth,
leading to sinking and drowning—empty-handed departure.
Turn your face, return—
one loss of human form, eternal kalpas of ruin.
Return to purity, revert to simplicity,
turning from the world, cleansing dust—true awakening.
One orb of radiant light,
shining brilliantly into the great square.

**IX**
If not awakened in this life,
where to turn in the next?
The six paths intersect,
one misstep—eternal peril.
If you see through it,
cast aside all in this dusty world.
Clouds and water, carefree,
steadily drifting the empty boat beyond things.

**X**
Floating life’s sorrows,
the dusty world’s busyness—when will it end?
One day, impermanence comes,
fortune passes to others, karma is your own.
If you awaken,
abandon foes and kin to seek the way out.
All things cease—
search carefully within life and destiny.
Staying home to study the Dao,
two matters unachieved—delayed and hindered.
If you wish to cultivate truth,
do not cling to the slightest speck of worldly dust.
Empty the heart, fill the belly—
this alone is the true path to ascending immortality.
When merit is complete, audience at the Origin,
the golden palace’s dawn transforms you into a feathered immortal.

**Ten Poems: "Longing for Immortality"**

**I**
Those who leave home
seek truth.
Through all calculations, the vast sky is without a speck of dust.
Knowing the empty valley’s spirit.

**II**
The sun as neighbor,
the moon as kin.
Within heaven and earth, the Dharma-body turns.
Only then do you know the person beyond things.

**III**
Silent and still,
serene and clear.
Day and night, the three lights—nature fills itself.
In every thing, clarity.

**IV**
The Dao has no form,
nurturing the numinous spirit.
Piercing the sea, penetrating mountains—merged in the profound.
The true person’s path of emergence.

**V**
Roaming freely,
delighting in the clear autumn.
Veiled, Cao Creek’s gentle waters flow.
Jade blossoms on both banks.

**VI**
Floating bubbles,
drinking, forgetting sorrow.

**X. "South Branch Melody" (Ten Poems)**

**I**
Sun sets, stars sparse, moon ascends the tower.
Deep in drunken jade isles.
Behold the pure sound, witness rise and fall.
Dharma-eye and star-gaze span ancient and modern.
Crimson wheels encroach between the two.

**II**
Forests of fire-pearls, water’s true gold.
No need to seek afar in other realms.
Inherit and recognize the original heart.
Tiger and dragon harmonize, Kan and Li unite.
Divine water trickles into the jade ladle.
Cloud-waves and snow-surges drift.

**III**
Treasure-pool’s irrigation,
nurturing the numinous sprout.
First blooms the jade plum, tender jade sways.
Fragrance beyond things wafts.

**IV**
The Dao is boundless,
nature’s light is perfect.
Recognize the tortoise and serpent entwined below.
Yin and yang unite heaven and earth.
Mercury and lead, qi and spirit complete.
Radiance streams forth, rosy clouds dazzling bright.
Only then do you know the profound within the profound.

**V**
Do not exert effort,
lest the spirit weary.
In clarity and stillness, recognize the original truth.
Harmonizing light, unstained by dust.
Cast the self aside,
become the natural person.
Leisurely roam heaven’s edge, play with the solar wheel.
Cloud-wander through jade grottoes in spring.

**VI**
Gather frost of the profound,
steep jade nectar.
Two substances blend, swallowed in fire.
After refining, the tripod brims with fragrance.
Flavor extraordinary,
hue clear and luminous.
After swallowing, pure coolness permeates the body.
Intoxicated, the Jade Emperor appears.

**VII**
As a human being,
do not follow blindly.
How many decades of light remain?
In vain, you tarnish yourself with worldly dust.
Diligently cultivate the true,
nurture the original spirit.
The two luminaries’ light grinds the jade wheel.
A single drop of yin essence, pure.

**VIII**
Guard essence closely,
brimming full.
Silently seal the golden pass, ascend in reverse.
Pearls of the profound pour forth.
Within, numinous;
without, bright.
Inner and outer merge—one point of light.
Soaring upward to the jade radiance.

**IX**
Refine the body, the monkey-mind retreats,
burn the true, the horse of intent grows sparse.
One numinous, perfect awakening—suddenly true thusness.
Penetrating profound mystery,
light mirrors the primordial beginning.
Kan’s tiger, jade-like in form;
Li’s dragon, pearl-like in hue.
Clouds surge, lightning flashes—piercing the void.
Thunderous and towering,
playfully brandishing the profound pearl.

**X**
The great Dao, though near, feels distant;
profound mechanism, though receding, not yet sparse.
The vast emptiness congeals in elegance, naturally thus.
One stream of numinous source,
lustrous from the very beginning.
Northern sea’s simurgh bathed in black,
Southern mountain’s phoenix dyed in crimson.
Soaring beyond clouds, emerging from the void.
Sun and moon exchange light,
seizing the night-shining pearl.

**XI**
Matching the principle of yin and yang,
the infant lord accompanies the slender waist.
Harmonizing lead and mercury, requiring the whole day.
Gold essence from the water’s depths,
transferred into fire to burn.
Refine into a sword that communicates with spirits,
forge into a blade of wisdom.
Subduing dragons and tigers, slaying demons and fiends.
At night, it emits radiance—
who dares raise their voice?

**XII**
Phoenix flies far, yet returns;
crane follows wings to the marsh.
Within stone, jade is concealed; clams hold pearls.
Wood grows sunken *ding*,
grasses flourish with purple lingzhi sprouts.
Beasts transform into lions and scaled elephants,
serpents bathe and become sea-dragons.
Fish divide in water-valleys, changing into whales and giant turtles.
The human Dao connects—
cloud-steps ascend the cinnabar heavens.

Rain passes, spring nears its end;
wind arrives, autumn comes too soon.
A hundred years of light and shadow—gone in a turn of the head.
Wealth and honor, glory and splendor,
all like bubbles on water.

I urge you to cultivate yourself early,
search the depths of the Mystery Gate’s intent.
Let not worldly affairs strike your heart.
Guard the secret breath of the Three Fields,
lest thieves steal it away.

**XIII**
The Supreme Mysterious Origin Ancestor,
born before the vast kalpas began.
First transmitted the Five Thousand Words of the Dao,
expounding the orthodox without doubt—
who comprehends this profound mystery?
All consume the drug of delusion,
but who feasts on the elixir of life extension?
Crooked teachings of heterodox paths entangle the self.
Death casts one into the prison of darkness,
eternally bound in the Yellow Springs.

**XIV**
Trample the net of worldly toil,
resolute and steadfast in soaring ambition.
Sword in hand, eyes whirling like rings.
Sunlight vies in brilliance,
flashing and dazzling, illuminating the heavens.
The depths of the sea of awakening,
spirit-waves surging for ten thousand miles.
Demons disperse in terror, gods tremble.
Transforming into pure yang,
forever dwelling in Penglai and Yingzhou.

**XV**
If you ask of the principles of cultivating truth,
do you yet comprehend?
The whale and roc emerge from the sea, piercing the starry canopy.
At night, they lodge in the Moon Palace,
soaring to the branches of the osmanthus tree.
Auspicious and virtuous spirit-birds are few,
ominous and perverse monstrous birds abound.
In flocks and herds, they idly wander.
Thorns become their nests—
where is the phoenix’s abode to be seen?

**XVI**
Sitting, I behold the scenes of Huaxu,
my spirit roams, playing in the treasure realm.
A pair of youths cradle dragon-light,
radiant and resplendent,
gathering it into the center.
A spirit-immortal child is born,
and upon achieving merit, enters the imperial realm.
On the Jade Empyrean’s register, one’s name appears for the celestial examination.
Seizing the immortal’s banner,
holding the jade tablet, one enters the treasure cave.

**XVII**
Unknowing of the treasure within the body,
how can one understand the chapters beyond the material world?
Without the true teaching, one raves in madness.
Gazing toward Penglai,
lying supine, groping for the blue heavens.
To recognize mercury within lead,
one must know lead within mercury.
These two, inverted, become naturally harmonious.
Releasing the spirit in flight,
the embryonic immortal dances beyond the void.

**Three *Xianxiangzi***

Hark! This ugly frame,
reeking, filled with maggots.
Earth, water, fire, wind—hollowly amassed,
buried deep.
Like me, they invite calamity all my life.
To escape the催 of life and death,
cling not to the mortal body as the sacred embryo.
Preserve and refine the numinous ointment until it congeals,
forming the embryo.
Bathe the infant, seated on the treasure dais.

In the ancient courtyard of carefree melody,
alone I sit, composed, contemplating the Daoist scriptures.
The mysterious mirror washes away the clutter of worldly affairs,
bringing peace.
With one cleansing, the machinations of the heart awaken—ears and eyes grow clear.

Serene and tranquil, cool and pure,
a stick of incense fills the courtyard with fragrance.
Beyond the gate, I know not who has arrived—
the jingle of jade pendants,
a gentle breeze carries the faint sound of jade ornaments.

Alone I sit, contemplating the *Huangting*,
beginning to perceive the brightness within and without.
Luminous and still, untroubled by worldly vexations,
the heart grows clear.
Nurturing the spirit-source to its deepest purity.

Lightly steeping snowflake tea,
the universe floats in auspicious qi.
Clouds part, the frosty sky reveals the bright moon—
welcoming me.
A grain of spirit-cinnabar ascends in reverse.

**Ten *Yiye Zhou***

Shaking off worldly passions and karmic debts,
here lies the end of profit and fame.
In purity and solemn dignity,
feast in the Jade Pool.
Waters still and limpid as ice,
revealing the autumn moon in the emerald pond.
Within the moon, awakening to the cinnabar branch—
the radiance of innate nature shines.

Unaware the body ages and withers,
enduring countless entanglements.
Who would cease before death,
mired in bitter craving?
Seeing through early, cultivate diligently,
recognize your own treasure.
A treasure beyond price,
eternally preserved.

The Dao harmonizes with the subtle and indistinct,
discerning that within lies something.
Each thing naturally flows,
all is encompassed.
Moonlit and wind-clear, filling the eyes,
precious talismans exquisitely fragrant.
Vast and empty, pervading the realm of essence—
within the realm of being and non-being.

Donning a bamboo hat, clad in straw,
gradually entering the depths of reed flowers.
By the green shore, mooring the fishing boat,
reeling in the line.
Lightly brewing the single flavor within the gourd,
wild cranes and solitary clouds in harmony.
The horizontal flute’s melody, pure and secluded,
joy without sorrow.

The Great Dao is originally without a single thing,
yet embraces the ten directions, empty and full.
No beyond, nor heart—
not even a needle’s space.
To see clearly, open the eyes of purity,
recognize the original void of the valley.
Neither shallow nor deep,
the golden elixir fills the crucible.

The Great Dao stands alone and independent,
skillfully employing the original traces.
Roaming the vast seas,
delighting in the clear autumn.
Moonlight supports the empty sky, auspicious and clear,
faintly revealing the red osmanthus and light verdure.
A splendid scene most wondrous and secluded,
rivaling Penglai Isle.

Moving the first yang as it emerges,
illuminating the subtle mysteries of the great void.
All phenomena vanish in concealment,
brilliantly radiant.
Congealing the numinous essence within the crucible,
the elixir is perfected in an instant.
The immortal ascends on cloudy blossoms,
playing in Penglai’s paradise.

Pearls congeal at the ocean’s depths, fresh and pure,
in the heavens, flawlessly clear.
At the center, the Great Void is vast—
the divine elixir rolls forth.
Outshining the autumn moon’s full wheel,
illuminating the original absence of wax and wane.
Cool and refreshing, chilling to the touch,
piercing the luminous jade.

The sea’s light congeals into a gleaming pearl,
noble or base—no distinction, like slingshots at sparrows.
What a pity, the original treasure,
soiled in the mire of the ford.
Recognize it, lest error arise,
polishing the bright and pure, free from entanglements.
Emerging from the clamor of dust,
delighting in eternal spring.

The first yang arises in inversion,
myriad transformations merge as one with the primordial.
Light dazzles, shooting toward the Jade Palace—
the hall is filled with crimson.
Clarity and roundness open in awakening,
above and below, penetrating without end.
Heaven and earth are utterly empty—
within the Great Mystery.

**Ten *Leijiang Yue***

Chasing wealth and lust, entangled in profit and fame,
when will the ceaseless strife end?
Day after day, frantically lost in dreams,
the heart’s monkey and horse run wild.
Deceiving earth and heaven, boasting many skills,
turning cleverness into folly.
All is vanity,
accumulating lifetimes of karmic debt.

I urge you to awaken and turn back,
abandon attachments, become a carefree wanderer.
Seek the Dao, pursue truth, find the wondrous finger—
early vow to transcend birth and death.
Failing to grasp the mystery,
clearing the ear’s obstructions,
receive the direct transmission.
The scene of the gourd-heaven appears—
the bright autumn moon before you.

Subtle and refined, the essence of the primordial,
a single point of deep red, flawlessly pure.
Above and below harmonize, opening the eye of wisdom—
leaping forth, the heart-pearl congeals.
Manifesting numinous clarity,
the spirit’s light shines,
inner and outer fully connected.
Floating clouds disperse,
revealing the moon of the heart beyond the heavens.

Empty and formless, turning in solitude,
round and bright, silently illuminating—
through the ages, without the slightest flaw.
With the Dao, originally one, embracing all phenomena,
each thing, each head, all is gathered.
Pervading all directions,
boundless and primal,
merged as one, without distinction.
Sages and worthies of ancient and present,
all find rest here.

The primordial Dao-body,
vast and boundless,
without corners, form, or thing.
Moist transformations and womb births all receive qi,
resonating through the mysterious and hidden.
Encompassing heaven and earth,
containing the cosmos,
sun and moon all embraced.
Returning the light, reflecting inward,
vastly capturing the transformations before the eyes.

Clearly perceiving the heart-pearl,
empty and luminous,
brilliantly opening the valley of spirit.
Nurturing the fetal immortal, skin like snow,
entering and exiting with the wind’s fragrance.
At dusk, inhaling the magic mushroom,
at dawn, feasting on the osmanthus,
at night, lodging in the Moon Palace.
Joyful and content,
seeking the true blessings of the ancient sages.

The Yangtze flows, serene and still,
night whispers, the sky like a jade table, ice-pure.
Lush colors, misty and vast,
the gaze encompasses the radiant jade’s glow.
Sitting alone, nurturing the spirit,
the curtain’s light shines through,
revealing exquisite snow.
Still and limpid,
a single point connects the Great Void.

The spirit soars on two wings,
resting in the Moon Palace’s halls,
lodging for the night on jade branches.
Encountering the true sign, without gain or loss,
forever guided by the perfected.
Achieving both merit and practice,
golden lads and jade decrees,
receiving the mandate at the Liao Yang Gate.
Within the Jade Dawn Palace,
eternally arrayed in immortal ranks.

A thatched hut, carefree and secluded,
still and dustless,
sitting alone behind lowered curtains.
Day after day, leisurely and tranquil,
possessing a serene livelihood.
Grasping firmly to preserve the true,
the heart free from杂念,
forgetting self and world.
The jade infant transforms,
naturally harmonizing with the Dao.

Light illuminates the ten directions,
congealing in the void, resplendent—
greatly manifesting, not a trifling matter.
Embracing the boundless, connecting with creation,
each thing, each head, all is aided.
Holding heaven and earth,
perfecting the Dharma-body,
jade countenance, truly pure and beautiful.
Transcending the mundane, leaving the world,
ascending to pay homage to the Three Clarities’ divine emperors.

Floating life like a dream,
alas, a hundred years of time—
how much can one truly grasp?
Wealth and honor, glory and splendor, fleeting,
why cling so tightly?
All for children and grandchildren,
a beloved wife and son-in-law—
who can replace you in life and death?
Turning back to reflect,
in an instant, free from the dust’s shadow.

Carefree beyond the world, unrestrained,
wind as neighbor, moon as companion—
this is the plan for the remainder of life.
By the rock, by the stream, monkeys offer fruit,
wine fills the ten directions, verses composed.
Drunk amidst mist and rosy clouds,
awakening this night—
where shall the heart return?
Within the Jade Dawn Palace,
plucking the osmanthus in the moon.

Once more—
the sky emerald-clear,
primordial yang harmonious and subtly dense,
emptiness vast, nothing abiding.
Attaining stillness, the heart’s aperture opens upward,
communing with the numinous radiance of the hollow valley.
Nurturing the original spirit,
the Perfected One appears,
unfettered and unbounded.
The Heavenly Dao-Father
bestows upon me boundless pure blessing.

The celestial mind’s orthodox Dharma,
the Alliance of Might,
the Purple Void’s virtue,
the supreme register of the Three Vehicles.
The golden tally, the mysterious canon,
the sealing of the wisdom-sword—
the heart-seal’s luminous clarity, desireless.
First, one’s own ailments vanish;
the heart’s perversities are subdued,
all specters lie concealed.
No need for elaborate faith—
naturally, one dons coarse cloth while holding jade within.

Again—
the formless Dao-body,
circulating yang’s light, densely woven,
pervading the subtle and vast.
Through the dim crossroads of the nebulous,
the vast qi is refined,
brimming with effulgent splendor.
A thousand fathoms of sunlit brilliance,
ten thousand miles of pure wind—
the divine radiance blazes forth.
At the Gate of Yi, feather-transformation,
the Great Mystery’s lineage, spiritually expansive.

Solitary, untrammeled, peerless,
within, immaculate purity—
not a speck of dust allowed to cling.
The embryo-immortal’s snowy visage is nurtured,
entering and exiting without hindrance or constraint.
Roaming the Purple Palace,
feasting in the Jasper Court,
the gift of carefree joy is mine.
Golden lads bear the goblet,
exquisite melodies guide me to the Dragon Tower.

Once more—
in the beginning, vowing to serve the Dao,
hoping for merit lofty enough to ascend as an immortal,
soaring beyond the azure vault.
Years pass, time deepens,
the heart wavers, unnoticed—
emotions entangle, bonds ensnare.
The copper rope tames the tiger,
the iron chain subdues the dragon,
shackling the cloud-treading feet.
No path of escape—
forever sunk in the thousand-fathom abyss.

Facing peril, suffering—who to blame?
No resolve, no decision,
regret for past mistakes.
Intent on cultivating the real,
yet vexed by fame and profit,
ensnared by wine, lust, wealth, and qi.
Household affairs unravel,
practice falters and regresses—
even at death, nothing to grasp.
I urge you to awaken,
spare yourself the burden of delay on both sides.

The Orthodox Teaching of the Great Mystery,
shuns the flourishing, refines the true—pure and still.
Within purity and stillness, the Dao-eye opens,
silver clouds unfurl, streaming from the well.
Essence overflows into emptiness,
qi surges through the Dharma-realm,
brimming to fill the golden crucible.
Sun and moon simmer and blend,
merging with heaven and earth in eternal harmony.

Alone in solitude, peerless,
unchanging in solitude,
the mind comprehends the myriad dharmas.
Transforming and ascending to pay homage to the Supreme Emperor,
returning to the true realm of pure yang.
No night, eternal spring,
immortals gather in assembly,
the divine youth is summoned to receive the mandate.
The Jade Infant chants in farewell,
a cup of everlasting intoxication.

*Ten Melodies of the Courtyard Full of Fragrance*

In the quiet chamber, nourish the spirit,
calm the heart, silently circulate—
inwardly observe the single point of true yang.
The cavernous void becomes luminous,
radiantly illuminating the Hall of Light.
It illumines the emptiness of the Dharma-realm,
primordial, standing alone before heaven and earth.
The three luminaries shine,
perfect clarity reveals true form,
enduring through kalpas, everlasting.

Turn back—who questions the self?
Before your eyes, suddenly awakened,
no need for deliberation.
Naturally in accord with the Dao,
both self and things forgotten.
Only the clear wind and bright moon,
communing with the divine, the light of the boundless.
Ascend the path of the Mysterious,
the primordial qi of Hunyuan,
pervading all directions.

---

The ancestral Dao requires no cultivation,
eternally wondrous in function—
awakened, inner and outer become one.
Where the numinous light appears,
it illumines the profound and obscure.
Resplendent, vast, and boundless,
unobstructed, pervading and harmonizing.
The subtle and formless,
the original face from the beginning,
returns to the root, reverts to emptiness.

True emptiness, bright and pure,
solemn, vast,
unfathomable, inexhaustible.
The Dao of heaven,
serene and profound, transcends the mundane cage.
Wondrous transformation arises from the true ancestor,
communing with the origin, returning to the source.
Beyond the three realms,
the spirit shifts, the shell is shed,
beyond the world, the yang-trace appears.

---

The subtlety of the Great Ultimate,
the celestial true in lush abundance,
primordial qi overflows the eyes without bound.
The mysterious pearl ascends and descends,
radiance scattering like sparks.
Gathered into the alchemical crucible,
returning to true essence,
unstained by the clamor of the world.
Turning inward, reflect—
the wondrous body of pure emptiness,
reflects the luminous sprout of the spirit.

Mercury and lead,
gradually congealing, coalescing,
the pure yang elixir is perfected,
eternal, without flaw.
A gourd of spring wine,
a three-foot blade to slay demons.
With confident steps, freely roaming,
tortoise and crane guide,
deep into mist and rosy clouds.
In the realm of carefree wandering,
within the Grotto of Eternal Spring,
time and again, the immortal blossoms are admired.

---

To the ends of the sea and sky,
seeking friends, visiting companions,
yet not a single kindred soul.
Strife over self and others,
wealth, lust, fame, and profit encroach.
Hearing of depravity, lewdness, and false speech,
they exhaust body and life,
unceasingly pursuing.
The true and constant teaching—
my words are direct admonition,
yet in return, resentment runs deep.

Enough, enough—
how can this be endured?
In clarity and silence, circulate,
nurture the true heart.
The primordial qi of Hunyuan,
ascends and descends, settles and floats.
Gradually gathered into the precious crucible,
pure yang is perfected,
touching iron to turn it to gold.
The wondrous mystery revealed,
all demons disperse,
only then do ghosts and spirits revere.

---

Fleeting, the radiant light,
suddenly passed—
reckoning the toil, what has truly been gained?
Youthful complexion withers,
raven locks thin and brittle.
All for the sake of contending for fame and profit,
heedless that life and death cannot be escaped.
At the point of defeat,
like ants on a wheel,
coming and going, thousands of times.

You—awaken the heart,
illuminate the symbols of Zhou,
discern the broken and unbroken lines.
Heaven and earth commune in harmony,
Kan and Li naturally unite.
Yin returns, yang arises in transformation,
pure essence refined,
clear qi soars to the heavens.
The fetal light appears,
the divine wind graceful,
stepping lightly to play amidst jade and jasper.

---

When winter’s breath meets the first month,
jade plum blossoms first unfurl,
waters cold, ice pure in severe chill.
Sparrows alight on lofty trees,
fish dive into the azure depths.
Sea cleansed, sky vast and boundless,
the mysterious pearl descends,
glittering with auspicious radiance.
The fetal star appears,
a pure name spreads through the world,
virtue naturally shines forth.

Immortals gather in joy,
before the altar, reverent,
offering birthday wishes to the Mysterious Yang.
Golden dragons refine the elixir,
jade beasts swirl, spraying fragrance.
Only wishing for distant years, a life fulfilled,
with heaven and earth,
eternally enduring.
At the ascent to immortality,
phoenixes lead, simurghs welcome,
cloud-steps reveal the August Emperor of the Void.

---

Standing alone at the star altar,
gazing up at the lofty vault,
sincerely cultivating solemn rites.
Incense frequently kindled,
reverently presenting the blue-green memorial.
Only wishing that all beings aspire to the Dao,
hearts opened, understanding—
without attachment, without delusion.
Returning to true essence,
the mysterious gate concealed,
a single resolve, forever unshaken.

All because the heart wavers,
wild schemes, strange fabrications,
what is the purpose of such entanglements?
Lust and passion grow,
virtue gradually wanes.
Like this, dragging through mud and water,
heedless of the ancestral roots of the sages.
As the scriptures say—
if one can be pure and still,
heaven and earth all return.

---

Night departs, dawn arrives,
time swift and urgent,
the four luminaries hasten, urging haste.
This floating life is brief—
who will carefully examine and ponder?
Ceaselessly, deluded heart and vain thoughts,
pursuing karmic debts,
unaware of impermanence.
The form returns to earth,
the three hun and seven po,
chasing scenes, freely wandering.

Who is without
birth and death?
Each person, each one,
difficult to evade, difficult to conceal.
Suddenly awakened,
thus becoming like the wind, wild.
What care for front streets or back alleys?
Singing and dancing,
unfettered, with a broad heart.
In the realm of carefree wandering,
la-li-lo, la-li—
what harm in falling into disrepute?

---

Born with joy, dying with sorrow,
vainly toiling in the dusty world—
how many years of peril?
Success and failure, right and wrong,
honor and disgrace, both wane.
Wealth and nobility—great calamities to the body,
poverty and hardship—
leaving me cold and hungry.
How much better—
neither coming nor going,
the time before father and mother were born.

In emptiness, a symbol appears,
divine wind resplendent,
things dazzle like stars in radiance.
In harmony with heaven’s clarity,
in accord with earth’s subtlety.
The supreme Dao encompasses the Dharma-realm,
returning to the origin,
eternally unchanging.
Beyond birth, beyond increase,
neither growing nor diminishing,
ever equal to the Great Void.

---

The true wind of the primordial era,
the Mysterious Origin, ancestral founder,
propagating the numinous treasure talismans.

Golden chapters and jade scriptures,
words concise yet meaning radiant and new.
Expounding the Dao’s essence, vast and boundless,
pervading heaven and earth, subtle as motes of dust.
To cultivate family and state—
ministers loyal, children filial,
the people’s livelihood naturally pure and tranquil.

Disciples,
do you yet understand?
The wondrous pointer of fortune and adversity,
turning things back to the real.
Washing away the mirror of mystery,
illuminating what lies beyond the body.
In the azure realm, cloud-jewels for companions,
soaring through the void, the sun and moon as neighbors.
With wings upholding heaven,
through the golden gate one ascends in transcendence,
the radiant spirit manifesting in the imperial precincts.

*Ten "Spring in the Garden of Bliss"*

Within primordial chaos,
vague and indistinct, remembering and forgetting—
what agency is there to act?
Since the first division of heaven and earth,
the Three Powers respond in transformation,
mountains and rivers resplendent,
wilds lush with orchids and irises.
Sun and moon shining bright,
the spirit shifts and gleams,
penetrating the mysteries of yin and yang to grasp the sage’s mechanism.
Through the hexagrams’ images,
the lofty dragon and the tiger of Kan appear,
the two beasts locked in contest.

At the mountain’s peak, mist veils the cold stream.
Thunder crashes, jagged and clamorous in the Great Tenuity.
A torrent of the Silver River pours forth,
thousands of pearls,
rippling in cool waves, shimmering,
their light illuminating the Flowery Pond.
Gathering and returning to the source,
drawn back into the crucible,
the fire-tending refined through the hours of Zi and Wu.
When the cinnabar is complete,
it transmutes form and spirit to eternal solidity,
preserving life without decay.

Again,
nurturing the vast and sustaining the spirit,
detaching from desire to clarify emptiness,
observing serenely beyond the world of things.
Behold the Jade Pass crumbling,
a thousand frost-flakes gathering,
the azure cliffs drifting in vastness,
snow descending in clusters.
Within the chaos, suddenly lucid,
in emptiness, a symbol appears,
heaven and earth intermingling as the Four Beasts converge.
Before, the Crimson leads,
behind, the Mysterious follows left and right,
the tiger encircling, the dragon coiling.

From the Yellow Palace, the divine elixir is borne forth.
Encountering this,
the blind and ailing body is healed.
Let the snake swallow one pellet—
it transforms into a dragon with wings;
let the owl or quail grasp it—
instantly they become auspicious simurghs.
Turning iron to gold,
reviving the dead from their bones,
the monstrous *Taowu* upon meeting it reverts to sandalwood.
Do you know?
Ascending as an immortal, entering sagehood—
nothing is too difficult.

Again,
how lamentable this floating life,
so driven by scenes and emotions,
bound by every thing.
To cast aside body and life,
pursuing wealth and honor,
granaries and storehouses filled—
yet in the end, what does it amount to?
Fame like a snail’s horn,
profit like a fly’s head,
stirring mad cravings that ever delude.
Pitiable indeed—
like dust in the eye or a sparrow coveting jewels.
The true is buried in wasteland,
desire’s tassels blind and obscure the Dao.

Turning from truth to delusion,
living in inversion,
the path ahead treacherous,
each step awry.
I urge you to turn back,
cutting resolutely like iron,
to become a steadfast and unyielding man of courage.
Wield the spirit-sword,
shattering the mountain of attachment to dust,
and recognize the words of Kun.

Again,
the *Dao and Its Virtue*, the *Yin Convergence*,
the treasure-store of numinous scriptures—
sages and worthies all revere them.
Discoursing on the dim and indistinct,
the subtle and profound Dao,
the ascent and descent of being and non-being,
the movement and stillness of floating and sinking.
The Six Caverns’ soaring mystery,
the Three Palaces’ wondrous transformations,
the twin gates of meditation and dual cultivation encroaching upon both realms.
The luminous valley of emptiness,
vast, boundless, unfathomable,
neither shallow nor deep.

The numinous light illumines the pure tone,
uniting the qi to comprehend the union of past and present.
Alas, the deluded do not understand—
how many can truly grasp it?
Pursuing peripheral, lesser methods,
they seek blindly and erratically.
Turning from awakening to dust,
changing morning’s resolve by evening,
like a stubborn horse or a frantic ape—hard to seize.
Cease your anger,
lest your efforts show no sign,
corrupting your original resolve.

Again,
the Great One of Prior Heaven,
the Azure Sovereign of the Void,
the Supreme and Unsurpassed.

Within the Jade Firmament’s palaces and halls,
the host of immortals gathers in assembly,
fragrant clouds arrayed in ranks,
their radiance casting crimson hues.
Jade beasts and golden unicorns,
white cranes leading the chariot,
jeweled canopies and jasper blossoms scattering through the void.
The immortal maidens play their instruments,
releasing the True Consort’s graceful form—
her song and dance, her bearing refined.

The immortal melodies resound in endless wonder,
all manifesting before the Three Clarities’ thrones.
Hearken to the Cavern of Primordial Numinosity,
the ascendant mystery of the Supreme Dao,
the revelation of the Three Essentials,
the manifestation of numinous penetration.
Weary of stillness, they unfurl their scriptures,
turning the phoenix-drawn chariot,
the Five Elders escorting the Perfected into the Crimson Palace.
The host of immortals withdraws,
toward Penglai and the Jasper Gardens,
embracing the pure wind.

---

Again,
the Great Dao’s subtle mystery,
abiding since time immemorial,
ever steadfast and unchanged.
Yet the deluded heart, lost in ignorance,
sinks into the cycle of birth and death,
turning back to transform its countenance—
piling bones like mountains.
Only now do they realize
their original form,
casting off the false to return to the true,
gazing beyond the realm of things.
Departing from birth and extinction,
instantly, the true nature without residue
moves in and out of the muddy pellet.
Between the brows, the golden cicada dances,
freely flying forth and returning,
piercing the jade ring.
Gathering the sun’s essence and moon’s marrow,
drawing them into the crucible’s work,
the celestial cycle of fire and timing,
forging the elixir.
Transmuting form and spirit, free from decay,
gradually restoring vigor,
regaining youth to preserve the countenance forever.
When the work is complete,
amidst the depths of rosy clouds,
they ride the auspicious simurgh in stability.

---

Again,
worldly burdens and dusty passions,
daylong stupor—
when will it ever end?
Ensnared by profit, fame, wealth, and desire,
they obscure their celestial truth,
persisting in folly.
Fair maidens and darling sons,
golden fetters and jade shackles,
binding them in unyielding entanglement.
O foolish ones,
accumulating boundless evil karma—
when the reckoning comes, who will bear it?
Summoned to Fengdu, questioned without recourse,
alas, the transgressions of former days
bring retribution in their wake.
Enduring the knife mountains and sword trees,
the biting cold of icy winds,
the boiling cauldrons and pounding pestles,
the torment of ghostly tortures upon the corpse.
A thousand deaths, ten thousand rebirths,
yet no path of escape—
eternally cast into the dark abyss.
In the realm of rebirth,
they take on human form,
wearing horns, tails, fur, and hide.

---

Again,
the Primordial Beginning’s ancestral way,
permeating things before Heaven,
its essence harmonizing with the Great Subtlety.
Within the ninefold yang crucible,
the dragon chants and tiger roars,
thunder rumbles and lightning flashes,
purple mists soar and swirl.
Playfully toying with the black pearl,
boundless and ethereal,
its light bursts forth in streaming radiance,
illuminating Kan and Li.
Penetrating the wondrous mystery,
behold the mastery of this lineage—
a power divine and apart.
Naturally grasping the celestial mechanism,
moving and turning,
following the handle of the Dipper’s array.
With a shout, the Dragon Spring’s sacred sword
sends its light piercing the azure vault,
terrifying the host of demons,
toppling the hundred specters.
Enriching the nation, pacifying the people,
bringing purity, peace, and joy—
the advent of the Formless Perfected.
By the cinnabar script’s decree,
they ascend to Penglai and the Jasper Gardens,
the immortal return beyond the realm of things.

---

Again,
within the golden towers and jasper pavilions,
the fragrant clouds of the jeweled halls
manifest at dawn in the Jade Void.
The phoenix-drawn chariot arrives,
rainbow pendants chiming,
the Heavenly Perfected descending in exile,
long concealed in mortal form.
Suddenly, stillness is realized,
the numinous light penetrating the body,
merging with the Primordial Mystery to emerge from being and nonbeing.
The flying spirit-sword
plunges into the Dragon Palace’s sea-vault,
seizing the luminous pearl.
Streaming radiance blazes from the beginning,
myriad golden rays
enveloping the crucible and furnace.
Refining the pure yang elixir to completion,
piercing Heaven and Earth,
the cosmos in flux—
rising, descending, sinking, floating.
When the work is fulfilled and the origin is returned to,
golden lads and jade maidens,
crane-drawn chariots and fragrant winds
emerge from the cavern lake.
Contending for primacy,
they receive the mantle of the immortals’ leader,
eternally presiding over the sacred isles.

---

Again,
kindness, humility, and gentleness,
relieving suffering and pitying the poor,
adapting to circumstances with flexibility.
Skillfully governing the household and enriching the nation,
cultivating the body and nurturing life,
profoundly plumbing the workings of creation,
shouldering the legacy of Zhuang and Lie.
Embracing and guarding the mysterious yang,
the numinous source firmly secured,
within, the twin gates nurture the vast and unconstrained.
The path of the mysterious penetrates,
releasing the wondrous hue between the brows,
its light connecting with the clouds and mist.
Vast and boundless, obscure and distant,
revolving the sun and moon,
their essence blending with things, ever fresh.
Illuminating the Cavern of Primordial Vacuity,
congealing the void in radiant splendor,
the fetal star’s single point
emerges to transform the prior Heaven.
Responding universally to all directions,
pervading the Dharma-realm,
filling all gaps with flawless virtue and power.
The might of their spiritual force
displays their lifelong mastery,
seizing the immortal’s domain.

---

*Golden Flower of Longevity, Twenty-Nine Stanzas*

The cinnabar field’s root is firm,
the numinous spring drawn in ceaseless irrigation.
Gradually, the yellow sprout grows,
the wind sways the solitary root along its narrow path.
The golden flower blooms in beauty,
its fragrant petals unfurling, breaking through the husk.
Cut and arranged in a silver vase,
paired with dragon’s incense, offered to the Supreme Clarity.

Nurturing life from death,
escaping death to return to life, ever cycling.
Abandoning the false to seek the true,
the true nature clearly knows the body beyond the body.
From nonbeing, being arises,
within being, nonbeing returns—hard to express.
Silently guarding the divine work,
when the work is fulfilled, ascending to the azure sky.
Truly pure, truly still,
in stillness, purity perfects nature and life.
The life-root holds the spirit,
the spirit flourishes in the Yellow Court and Purple Palace’s spring.
The spring’s light gleams bright,
its vast brilliance filling the ancient Dao.
The Dao ascends to the mysterious,
the mysterious, boundless, beyond the heavens.
The numinous origin expands,
the eye’s vista of wind and light, empty and reliant.
Vast and unbounded,
drifting into the Jade Palace, scattering treasures.

The mouth of wondrous penetration,
facing the southern window, gazing at the Northern Dipper.
The jewel, immaculate and serene—
a single luminous pearl rolls into the heavens.
Nonaction, purity, and stillness,
unmoving, unshaken, nurturing nature and life.
A stream of cold light
pervades Penglai, entering the great square.
Boundless and without limit,
coming and going like a passing traveler.
The Dao naturally penetrates the numinous,
the eyes send the returning soul into the distant obscurity.
The wondrous principle of pure vacuity,
profound and perfectly luminous, merging to the depths.
The sea clears, the sky empties—
within emptiness, the knowledge of sacred work.
The heart-pearl surges and leaps,
flames bursting in streaming radiance, flashing and sparkling.
The phoenix ignites the golden crow,
flying past Sinra to the Jade Capital.
The Primordial Mystery’s subtle secret,
silent and desolate, seamlessly entering.
Probing the marvelous work,
the *Yijing*’s images align with the sacred mechanism.
Merged in a single qi,
filling and surging through the void, nothing left unfulfilled.
Gazing to the horizon’s clear light,
suddenly, the harmonizing wind cools Heaven and Earth.

Amid the fiery household, sons and daughters, wives and servants—all bound by craving.
Awakened, delusion dispelled, the belly full, songs rise in joy unspent.
Where lies true freedom? Turning back, the homeland beckons for return.
The vast and open celestial realm—
the moon bathes the limpid river, the sacred cassia blooms full.
Within, the Northern Dipper turns,
revolving the Heavenly Gate to open the Gate of Wisdom.
Within yin, yang arises,
smelting the three *hun* and seven *po* into oblivion.
The jade crucible’s work complete,
the golden elixir in the precious tripod gleams bright.
The radiant cinnabar shimmers,
the sun blazes in the clear sky, emerald clouds descend.

Life is but an illusion, a fleeting transformation—
even at arm’s length, impermanence holds no fear.
Do not long for the next life,
for who can say where the next life will lead?
The road ahead is treacherous,
bristling with swords and spears, the path too perilous to tread.
I urge you to turn back,
and wander with me beyond the world’s confines.
Gazing inward at the Three Luminaries,
the numinous cinnabar fills the tripod to overflowing.
The radiance illumines the sacred infant,
transmuting the cosmos into crystalline purity.
The river and sky at night—moonlit tablets,
the precious cassia, exquisitely clear, gleams pristine.
Only I have nurtured it,
like a jade flower blooming amidst flames.
Floating without blemish,
grasping firmly, preserving spirit, cheeks filled with primordial *qi*.
The mysterious frost of the valley nourishes,
the divine cinnabar ripens, the tripod fragrant.
Pure as the blazing sun,
auspicious *qi* congeals in the void, filling the chamber.
Merged in the primordial unity,
the *Yijing*’s celestial patterns guide to wondrous mystery.
Turning inward to question the self,
recognize the true marvel of the Unborn.
Within, the numinous light unfolds,
ascending to the Moon Palace to anoint the cassia frost.
Heavenly Water harmonized,
ethereal clouds of radiance merge to the depths.
Balancing yin and yang,
the immortal’s work shines in the Northern Emperor’s realm.
The primordial *qi* unites,
earth and heaven born from emptiness, all fulfilled.
The precious and pure, exquisitely formed—
the cassia falls, the golden crow sinks into the azure sea.
Nurturing essence, securing the root,
the dazzling divine pearl follows the wind away.
The moon mirrors the heart of the waves,
the Heavenly Eye crystal-clear, water yields gold.
The hidden dragon at the first nine,
the soaring dragon at nine-five—none lead the flock.
Great indeed is the Creative,
all things flourish in purity, naturally attained.
Nature and appearance draw near,
the Dao manifests in kindness, concealed in function.
Essence and luminosity intermingle,
spirit’s transformations—no fixed path.
The mysterious jade, refined and pure,
the precious and pure, numinous splendor, wind-borne auspice.
Within, all merges and congeals,
stars cluster, auspicious light fills the chamber.
The Pure Yang immortal’s form,
countenance resplendent, riding the phoenix’s wings.
Light as frosted clouds,
ascending into the depths of the heavens to roam the Jade Capital.
From the jeweled palace, exiled and descended—
a single point of fetal light, jade-like in hue.
Virtue’s transformative wind and rule,
spirit’s brilliance, essence’s radiance—countenance ever refined.
Like the wind’s own kin,
naturally attuned to emptiness, worthy of trust.
The immortals’ banners gather,
through the night, pure songs call out in jade tones.
Silent and vast, profoundly still—
the Dao, great and perfectly luminous, like a precious mirror.
The frosty night sky,
things pure, stars sparse, the sea’s cassia full.
Secluded and serene,
alone by the mountain stream, the wind vast and boundless.
Waters emerald, mist clear,
the heart at ease, wisdom pure—beyond the world’s immortal.
The numinous source, empty and still,
things shift, yang flows—like a precious mirror.
The eyes filled with pure light,
solitude and non-action—function lies in constancy.
Rooted in the one nature,
returning to reflect true emptiness, endlessly cycling.
Nature and life both complete,
the Yang Spirit refined, naturally attained.
Congealed in empty stillness,
the dazzling divine wind shines, self-illuminating.
Penetrating the distant heavens,
the one nature, vast and solitary, anoints the cassia’s fullness.
No one, pure and quiet,
profoundly still—cool waves, the wind vast and boundless.
The precious incense’s wisp of smoke,
piercing the cinnabar clouds, descending auspicious immortals.
Grasping the wondrous principle,
in the quiet chamber, deep contemplation—clarity to the depths.
Form released, heart congealed,
light mirrors the vast void, the *qi*-image pure.
The Dharma-body, light and resplendent,
luminous Yang Spirit follows the wind away.
Following the Middle Prime,
essence dense, filling the void, merging with the Emperor’s origin.
No glory, no disgrace,
within, guarding the true origin, ever self-sufficient.
Externally, no fixed abode,
above and below, circulating through the Six Voids.
The Kunlun’s mysterious jade,
borrowing the sun’s light, filling the land.
Merged into a single pearl,
the precious and pure, numinous splendor—five hues unfurl.
The secret transmitted,
the Dharma-eye clear, the divine gaze transcending eons.
Like the moon over the stream,
jade flowers drift, filling the Great Void.
Cool and crystalline,
auspicious light, radiant splendor—ice and jade pure.
Resplendent as the stars,
another true visage emerges from the embroidered curtain.
Suddenly awakened,
sons and daughters, wives and servants—all forgotten.
All affairs cast aside,
the one nature serene, the Dao naturally constant.
The celestial rainbow’s pure blessing,
harmonizing with the Dao, ascending to truth, illuminating supreme virtue.
Virtue’s banquet, the heart’s light,
cinnabar and azure jade—longevity ever increasing.
Breaking open the demon’s den,
vast and obscure, essence flickering in uncertainty.
The eyes filled with splendor,
Yang’s radiance, the luminous pearl gleaming like sunlight.
Utterly true, without thing,
the precious and dazzling, essence’s brilliance—returning and repeating.
Even unto death, unchanging,
surrounded by stars in the cinnabar clouds—enduring and long.
The ignorant rustic,
blindly trusting, madly wandering without aim.
The Great Dao, level and smooth,
yet the heart strays, chasing illusions down forked paths.
Observing the Gate of Wisdom,
the distant and subtle Yang Spirit—existing within the nonexistent.
Daydreaming in the land of Hua Xu,
the luminous soul of the youthful immortal soars in celestial play.
Abandoning greed, severing attachment,
nature still, heart clear—illuminating the precious realm.
The precious realm of Yang’s splendor,
transmuting the body, crystalline as snow, hidden frost.
Empty whiteness shimmering,
beyond the pavilion, the spirit still—relying on self-reflection.
Breaking through the murky crossroads,
revealing the perfect and all-penetrating five-hued pearl.
The Three Passes sealed,
bathed in jade nectar—countenance can be fulfilled.
The divine cinnabar nurtured,
eyes gleaming, exquisitely formed—enhancing the precious radiance.
The mysterious essence, profound and secluded,
the golden palace, the solitary Yang—clear and auspicious.
Two azure lads,
bearing the mysterious pearl into the Crimson Palace.
The spirit still, seated alone,
advancing sharply amidst the tumult—often self-humbled.
The outer gate forever barred,
the inner treasury sealed—guarding the precious vessel.
The mysterious light soars past,
piercing the void, the heart’s crucible shattered.
Golden and azure, cinnabar and jade,
the eyes filled with numinous mushrooms, the *qi*-image pure.
No words, no speech,
trusting in conditions, dissolving past karma.
Self and things both forgotten,
concealing traces, veiling light—virtue naturally grows.
The root of illusion extinguished,
awareness and illumination perfectly merged—forgetting the moon’s reflection.
Directly following the light,
a single heart-pearl merges with the sun’s radiance.

The esoteric formulas of true immortals
demand unwavering faith and loyalty to transmit.
When facing righteousness, be vigilant—
never trust the deceptive words that weigh short and long.

The jade mechanism leaks its secret,
the Dharma-eye’s numinous light pure and bright.
Penetrating the subtle and profound,
the sacred cassia blooms in the wintry forest as white feathers take flight.

Turn the head to reflect and awaken,
seeing through floating life as but a dream.
Abandon things to seek the real,
forgetting thoughts and form to exit the six dusts.

Heaven clear, earth still,
above and below, the void shines with the sun’s brilliance.
The radiant original spirit
roams the Yellow Capital and Purple Court in spring’s embrace.

Forgetting form, relinquishing illumination,
spotless and empty—truly the ultimate subtlety.
Beyond things, rosy clouds glow,
the celestial shore’s waves settle, merging with the Great Subtlety.

The cinnabar apertures unfold,
awakening to the profound mystery’s essential truth.
Emerging as stellar transformations,
the wind rides the numinous gale, the Changes’ images at play.

Silently guard within,
the inner yang pours forth from the midst of nothingness.
What is within this nothingness?
The solitary body, perfectly merged, illumines the sea-pearl.

Spirit clear, *qi* refined,
roaming the cinnabar heavens, bright as day.
Unrestrained above and below,
numinous blossoms densely fill the Great Void.

The scene-wind first appears,
auspicious clouds ride the nine transformations.
Only then is clarity trusted,
roaming the Southern Mound, pouring forth the white orb.

The numinous spirit barely glimpsed,
and already the new spring threads through a single line.
Wandering immortals beyond images
behold the Jade Pool’s five-colored lotuses.

The blind excel in hearing—
a single *qi* of clarity awakens wisdom’s nature.
The deaf can awaken—
two points of spirit enter the precious vessel.

Return from deception to truth,
like a jade mirror hung high in empty space.
Only when reflection is distinct
does one trust the golden elixir forms in a day.

Turn the head to question oneself,
returning the light to Penglai, utterly transparent.
A single mysterious pearl
circulates above and below, emerging from the six voids.

Perfectly merged with Heaven’s essence,
the image adapts, round and penetrating, essence flowing ceaselessly.
Unrestrained within and without,
roaming the midst of heaven without contraction or expansion.

The feathered one’s clarity and refinement
can turn midnight into spring’s daylight.
Roaming and guiding the central heavens,
exquisitely pure and wondrous—profound, yet again profound.

Subtle and dense, the essence-jewel,
scattered scenes of jade flowers stretch across the azure sky.
Sunlight on langgan jade,
the wind stilled, yet the chill of jade pendants lingers.

Meeting thus,
you say my soul flies and my heart trembles.
Seek not, search not—
when we meet, no good intention remains.

Tell them not to bow,
lest the poor remember old debts.
Each turn your head—
even slight deviation makes one a beast of burden.

**Seven Poems on Longing for Immortals**

Mountains link to waters, waters to mountains.
Waters graceful, mountains bright amid the scenery.
Clouds and rosy clouds—one taste of leisure.

Dawn wind wanes,
night deepens.
Moon ascends the plum’s tip, its shadow covering the altar.
The immortal’s sound, the chill of jade pendants.

The plain sky clears,
petals scatter like jade.
Faint numinous mist spreads across the earth.
Cold light, crisp *qi*, pure.

Precious essence congeals,
jade dawn stills.
The two luminaries’ radiance dazzles the sun’s brightness.
Langgan dots the Star of Longevity.

The Dao-heart tranquil,
the wisdom-lamp bright.
The jade-playing lad opens the Dao-scriptures.
Clear as the sound of jade pendants.

Serene and still,
radiant and congealed.
The swallow rests by the flowery pool, swallowing jade essence.
Returning to purity, the body naturally chaste.

Within, peace;
without, uprightness.
Within and without, no dwelling—all surveyed in clarity.
Every thing, every head, awakened.

*Qi* pure,
wisdom numinous.
Cold light reflects into the precious vessel.
Effortlessly transforming into jade essence.

Extinguish worldly passions,
awaken true sincerity.
Retreat to forests and springs, wandering clouds and waters.
Mist-light fills the eyes.

Radiant and still,
penetratingly clear.
Form released, heart congealed—the Dao naturally manifests.
Ascend the mysterious, illuminating the Jade Capital.

Diligently cultivate,
awaken to non-action.
Only wish the heart wise, the world unconfused.
Know clearly the mechanism of heaven and earth.

Precious rosy clouds glow,
brilliant and subtle.
The Purple Court and Green Capital await their time.
The Jade Palace reveals its sacred form.

The wisdom-blade appears,
slaying the Three Corpses.
Abide in integrity, purity, and detachment from love.
Serenely guard the plain essence.

Eyes bright,
the Dao full.
The azure sea’s cinnabar blossoms reveal the Jade Clarity.
Still, a single star.

**Six *Daolianzi* Poems**

Illumine the ancestral origin,
awaken to the true Chan.
A single point of numinous light emerges from before heaven.

The Changes’ green, cinnabar red,
yellow and plain mystery.
Still and auspicious, filling the mountains and rivers.

Frosty sky, wind stilled—naturally congealed.
Scattered jade flowers,
precious cassia round.

Speak not of the Dao,
seek not Chan.
Non-action and purity—excellent causes and conditions.

Awaken to the mysterious—
mysterious, yet again mysterious.
Cultivate true awakening,
seize the immortals’ authority.

Piercing gaze, radiant play in the cinnabar heavens.
The Five Numinous Ones take flight,
the Changes’ feathered immortals.

The practice of cultivation—
diligently inquire.
The unborn, undying Dao bears its task.

The Changes’ clear sky—
know the original heart.
Illumine movement and stillness,
stabilize the floating and sinking.

The jade infant ever guards the golden vessel.
Rosy clouds glow,
scattering precious peaks.

Truth conceals falsehood,
falsehood conceals truth.
Released, the solitary body severs distant and near.

Within the primordial chaos,
no self, no others.
Spirit communicates with the Dao,
the Dao with spirit.

Still as empty jade, like the ice-wheel.
Rolling the celestial river,
emerging from the six dusts.

From this head it arises,
to that head it proceeds.
Through the face’s gate, it enters and exits freely.

Heaven’s light appears—
a single star.

The true aspect,
the originally formless body—naturally bright.
Appearing in the vast yang,
entering great accomplishment.

Beneath the brows, the eyes—
the eyes’ essence.
The essence-light shines, brilliantly awakened.

Appearing in perfect merging,
illuminating beyond things.

Ascend to the Supreme Emperor,
circling the celestial court.
By the Moonflower Peak, play with cloudy blossoms.

Meeting the golden lad,
the Jade Clarity appears.

**Eleven *Xijiangyue* Poems**

Between the brows, intertwined amber,
the eyes’ pupils refined like dragon’s saliva.
Within the tripod, smoke curls to the Chan heavens.
A single point of numinous light emerges.

The Supreme Clarity illuminates this jade image,
the Tathāgata verifies this golden immortal.
The clear stream’s divergent branches share a single source.
Only by awakening to the principle does one know the highest good.

Vast *qi* congeals into a precious seal,
the clear wind scatters the clouded obscurity.
A wheel of bright moon illuminates the void.
Best to dance the spirit’s play.

Piercing through the Jade Capital above,
breaking open the Golden Gate within.
The original spirit sits alone in the Palace of Broad Cold.
Leading the host of immortals in ancestral veneration.

Regarding this body of mine, fraught with afflictions,
gazing upon the real—non-action, non-doing.

The Dipper’s handle turns the jade pivot of nature,
sun and moon cycle through heaven and earth in fullness.
Marking the ice-ash and snow-char,
firing them into flame-jujubes and intertwined pears.
All at once bestowed upon the lofty and graceful,
enhancing my wisdom and intelligence.
Yet all is blocked by household affairs and eaves,
obstructed by karmic hindrances.
Who can distinguish *li* from *wei*, right from wrong?
Turning away from the sacred offerings and Daoist discourse.
Clouds part, and every household sees the moon;
timely rains bring blossoms everywhere.
The pupil-child deeply enters emerald mist and rosy clouds,
guided to the everlasting spring of unending night.
No attachment to wind, flowers, snow, or moon,
casting aside wealth, honor, and fame.
Hollowing the heart, abandoning ambition, dismissing cleverness,
washing clean the illness of ignorance.
Shattering all illusions of the human realm,
only then does one penetrate the perfect completion beyond things.
Forgetting form, forsaking reflection, *qi* and spirit congeal.
Devoted to the root, delighting in heaven, knowing fate.
A staff bears a gourd of spring’s brew,
a case holds three feet of lustrous jade-sword.
The precious mirror between the brows subdues demons and evil,
sitting guard through the deep of midnight.
The golden tripod burns white snow,
the jade furnace refines the yellow sprout.
Elixir-light shimmers, rippling with jade brilliance,
heaven and earth intermingle in misty radiance.

Delusion sinks the body in seas of suffering,
awakening brings the moon forth on the western river.
A gentle breeze stirs the fragrance of osmanthus,
startling awake from a dream of roaming immortals.

Where do crane and phoenix lead?
A servant boy laughs, pointing toward the boundless dawn.
A jade tablet with golden characters bears the name "Southern Flourish"—
another realm between heaven and earth.

No need to gaze at stars or worship the moon,
why chant precepts or pore over scriptures?
Today I entrust you with this earnest charge:
life and death must rely on nature and destiny.

The Dao reveals all-knowing, supreme,
spiritual powers and the dharma-realm made perfectly clear.
No labor is needed—merit completes itself.
The will rests in non-action and purity.

Do not cling to gold, silver, or treasures,
nor covet jade-like beauty or flower-like faces.
A hundred years end in empty nothingness—
turning away from the Dharma of the Unborn.

To grasp the profound truth of the Mysterious,
one must understand the ancestral ways of the Most High.
The utterly divine, utterly sagely—awakening knows no bounds.
This freedom and ease arise of themselves.

Sever the copper ropes and iron nets,
strike open the jade locks and golden shackles.
Upon the stormy seas of suffering, board the spirit raft—
roam and play beneath the shade of the Tree of No Shadow.

No need to forget the signpost pointing at the moon,
why pluck osmanthus or pluck flowers?
Within the cauldron of the Great Void, refine cinnabar,
condensing the priceless Mystic Pearl.

Hold fast to the fundamental principle of nurturing life,
delusion leads to the mechanism of death.
Abandon the perverse, uphold the upright—what doubt remains?

There exists a wondrous and mysterious delight—
the infant frolics in the Jasper Park,
the azure youth laughs and points toward the Jade Pool.
Within the Moon of the Western River, cinnabar branches are plucked,
preserving and enhancing the spirit for enduring vision.

*Fisherman’s Pride, Five Poems*

Sunlight refines the yang soul in empty space,
the turning jade pivot revolves the celestial net.
Though near at hand, none perceive the man before their eyes.
A single thread connects—
the furnace opens, the cauldron splits, and celestial light appears.

Auspicious jade blossoms scatter in flakes,
fragrant winds softly brush the divine countenance.
In cold purity and serene emptiness, the feast is refined.
Truly enviable—
the Jade Emperor ascends the Liao Yang Palace.

Earthly po and heavenly hun diligently refined,
the essence of sun and marrow of moon yearn for each other.
The two luminaries exchange radiance like flashing lightning.
Clearly seen—
within the jade furnace, ten thousand golden flowers bloom.

Gently gathered and hammered into flakes,
round and round, shaped into a luminous form.
Dazzling the Great Void, jade hail is refined.
The divine light dazzles—
flying cinnabar pierces into the Hall of Pervading Clarity.

A century’s span races like a galloping steed,
floating splendor dazzles the eye through fleeting dust.
Mysterious vision cleansed, the spirit’s power set in motion.
The message is clear—
on the path of the Unborn, the truth is known.

Mists disperse, jade pupils ascend in celestial play,
yang light gradually reveals as pure yin withdraws.
Ten thousand specks of numinous cinnabar gleam on the void’s wall.
Bright and resplendent—
the elixir’s luster matches gold and jade in hue.

Chaos and obscurity traverse the cosmos,
colored clouds disperse, revealing the luminous jade hare.
The sun sets in the Salty Pool, then turns back to gaze.
The heart awakens—
congealing the hun and obscuring the po, the Golden Crow delights.

Fair and graceful, bearing the cold radiance of the ritual vase,
the triple-hued mist swirls in pure simplicity.
Directly encountering the Jasper Heaven, she carries the Woman Comet.
Unstained—
the cinnabar script forever binds her to the Jade Palace.

The Great Dao, most true, requires no words,
its radiance concealed, hidden in profound secrecy.
Preserve and refine the original essence without loss.
Dissolve the yin substance—
auspicious clouds bear forth the numinous yang sun.

Illuminating and shattering the gloom, it commands Heaven’s awe,
in utter vagueness and indistinctness, emptiness holds reality.
Luminous and immaculate, pure and white, they assist each other.
Attaining true unity—
the cinnabar script on jade tablets completes the immortal’s work.

*Immortal Homeland, Four Poems*

Easily attaining the pavilion of spontaneity,
beyond its eaves, pure splendor blends with freshness.
Cloud-linked peaks soar at the corners of the eaves,
numinous springs—
willow banks and misty waves connect to distant rivers.

Virtuous scholars conceal themselves in mystery,
mysterious vision cleansed, things naturally relinquished.
Within the empty altar, true delight is found,
dragon’s saliva—
sacred talismans lightly float, plucking the plain strings.

The Great Dao is fundamentally non-action,
within and without, serene in the wondrous mechanism.
In stillness and emptiness, true flavor is savored,
eyebrows raised—
the cold and pure divine light shines everywhere.

Graceful and elegant in bearing,
whether sitting, lying, walking, or dwelling, she follows at hand.
Winged, she ascends the central heavens, becoming a jade figure,
without doubt—
her place is in the Southern Palace, manifesting the Purple Tenuity.

The ancestral Dao is secretly transmitted,
having caught the rabbit, discard the snare and abide in spontaneity.
The eye’s horizon expands, revealing the Great Simplicity,
pure yang—
the sun’s radiant essence makes all things fresh.

Vague and indistinct, pervading the three thousand worlds,
foreknowing the shifting tides of hills and streams.
At the ocean’s depths, waves surge as the dragon emerges,
thrusting through the mysterious—
divine light bursts forth into the nine heavens.

The ancestral Dao is intermittently transmitted,
only then is the lineage’s wind confirmed to harmonize with nature.

The movement and stillness, being and non-being—guest and host in harmony,
the earth and heaven.
Above and below, the circling sun and moon shine fresh.
Radiance fills the three thousand worlds,
piercing valleys with numinous splendor, ever unchanging.
Within the void, a true jade figure takes form, ascending to heaven.
The Treasure Ease Child holds the elder’s white mystery.
The jade cage gleams,
guarding purity—
with steadfast resolve, utterly sever all dissipation.

Hold the inner realm,
moonlight piercing twin forests.
The jade child plays,
pointing afar to the heart of the azure pool—
scoop up the gold from the water.
The numinous treasure glows,
the lamp of wisdom shines,
divine light bears its task.
Face-to-face, yet none seek to grasp it.
If you awaken,
seeing clearly,
disaster and misfortune will not approach.
Dragons and tigers submit, ghosts and spirits revere.

**Two Poems to "The Courtyard Fragrance"**

The Dipper’s handle turns,
the Purple Tenuity first appears,
distant plains merge in pure clarity.
Cloud jade is ground away,
heaven’s treasure gleams with infant radiance.
Jade osmanthus and jasper forests, pristine feathers,
ascending the mysterious, they ride the dazzling flow of essence.
Cold and wondrous,
cinnabar and gold,
the mighty beacon transforms into a faint star.

Star emblems,
elegant and serene feasts—
pure wind conceals its rhythm,
forgetting form, forgetting appearance.
May our lineage awaken to understanding,
the heart released from floating glory.
Do not dwell on the distance of clouded mountains,
lift your gaze—
let not the numinous brightness dim.
In such truth,
the Azure Child flies away,
piercing the great Orchid City.

Again—
washing the belly, fasting the heart,
through frost and snow,
seeking the divine treasure’s essence-jewel.
Rely on your single act,
the pupil beholds the azure void.
The four bright heavens, free of floating veils,
ice cracks open—
all suspended images grow clear.
In the Starry Dawn Lodge,
jade tablets and golden characters—
who shall bind their fragrant name?

On the path,
people remain deluded,
their hearts straying onto crooked trails,
erring their way forward.
Returning to listen, long lost to the past,
movement and stillness arise anew.
The road to the divine Brahma palace is steady,
feasting in jasper forests,
light scatters like misty clouds.
The divine work is wondrous,
pure yang refined—
at dawn, the Purple Tenuity star appears.

**Three Poems to "Slow Voices"**

Beside misty waters, I dwell,
my humble abode on Song Peak,
the ends of heaven distant, communication cut off.
Yet enlightenment is not far—
before my eyes, the undivided pure wind.
The solitary precious moon, lofty and penetrating,
imprints a thousand pools,
illuminating the mysterious cavern.
No self, no other—
the primordial immortal scene of blended splendor,
one true emptiness.

With such understanding, heart-bound friends,
why offer tribute horses
or tread the dust of post roads?
I, weary in form,
need not travel far to meet you.
Bowing deeply,
flowing together—do not blame,
extend boundless compassion,
let not the heart be troubled.
Open the azure eye,
cast the divine light into the body,
entering the unmoving ancestral Dao.

Again—
the original unity of nature—
where was it arranged?
It came from the vague and indistinct void.
Receiving qi, forming shape,
father’s essence and mother’s blood congeal into an embryo.
Gradually, the fetus completes and descends,
before it can grow,
emotions turn wayward.
Self-inflicted ruin—
on the road, toiling endlessly,
slowly entangled in dust.

Vainly, a lifetime spent in inversion,
obscuring heaven’s natural treasure,
buried for ten thousand ages.
If you awaken to life’s prior truth,
the mysterious crucible splits the heart open.
Merging with the sun, congealing pure yang’s elegance,
gathering the five directions,
rosy clouds swirl back.
The jade morning manifests—
then forget form, abandon reflection,
ride straight to the Jasper Terrace.

Again—
hewing open chaos,
striking through Kunlun,
the Dipper’s handle turns the wheel of heaven.
On the winding shore, the crow and toad,
exchanging soaring, fleeing souls.
The mercury tripod and lead furnace blaze,
refining golden essence,
wood’s liquid and cinnabar’s dawn.
Starlight manifests,
dispersing the primordial one qi,
ten thousand lands veiled in rosy mist.

Luminous, still, without obstruction,
clashing mountains, rivers, forests, and gardens—
ten thousand gleams shimmer.
High and low, no difference—
distant plains merge in pure essence.
Face-to-face, who awakens to this?
In vain, laboring,
turning from enlightenment to chase illusions.
Cease anger—
like a blind man groping an elephant,
erring, losing heaven’s truth.

**Two Poems to "The River All Red"**

Spring flowers, autumn moon,
from ancient times to now, but a fleeting moment.
Wealth and nobility, wisdom and folly—
how many times have they turned?
Life and death, like ants, follow their cycles.
The immortal realm, though near,
its path beyond the dust—
as if separated by ten thousand mountains.
Awakening, return—
truly nurture simplicity in tranquility,
rejoice in pure leisure.

Worldly affairs, all unstained—
a body of purity,
a heart of non-action, observing with stillness.
Jade’s brilliance, gold’s radiance—look outward.
Bursting forth, ten thousand measures of bright pearls,
pushed through the two gates.
Within the Supreme Ultimate’s palace,
the inner elixir congeals.
Pure wind, fragrant and resplendent, pierces jade branches.
Ten thousand qi circulate, returning to one body—
a thousand true wondrous uses,
emotions without duality.
Merging into the Middle Primordial realm,
flutes and cranes drift ethereally,
auspicious qi coils and lingers.
The jade decree fills the empty azure,
names inscribed for immortal ascent—
riding chariots, driving phoenixes and simurghs.

Again—
raising the hairpin, staff in hand,
enjoying the moon, the wind’s message along the path.
Embracing the one, harmonious and balanced,
nurturing the knife-point’s mercury and lead.
Golden essence, wood’s liquid, moisten the radiant field.
Securely guarding the three spirits, returning to the fire palace,
five-colored clouds cover the earth,
light piercing the Brahma heavens.
Tiger and dragon intertwine—
the cosmos’s bright pearl is seized,
qi’s image trickles like a stream.
Treasure clouds glow with the sun,
brilliant yang’s radiance blazes,
reflecting back into the mysterious cavern.
Within the merged, dawn and dusk blend.
The dharma of ten thousand images, clear and round,
competing in freshness with all things.
Profound stillness, cold source—
ever before the eyes.
Within the void, rippling waves surge in the essence’s abyss.
Nine-hued yellow clouds shroud the night’s mist,
three peaks’ blue haze
reach far to ten thousand rivers.
The Dao complete, pure and refined—
yin’s mists scatter,
all things come to life.
The treasure’s image holds the spirit’s essence—
amid the six dusts’ heap,
lifting forth a blessed immortal.

**A Leaf Boat**

Ten thousand images surge open, vast and boundless,
the primordial qi blends in empty support.
The sea’s moon, tranquil and golden,
illuminates the heart of heaven.
Beyond the eyelashes, majestic spirit’s radiance unfolds,
an ice body, snow skin, graceful and delicate.
Steadily crossing jasper forests,
ascending the jade peak.

**Two Returning Songs**

The principle of cultivating truth—
where lies the mechanism of the Dipper’s meditation?
Vast thoughts of tangled vines, empty strife—
many efforts, all vain labor,
how could they compare to awakening to non-action?

Open the Dao’s eye,
the single nature emerges from confusion.
Dense bamboo does not hinder flowing water,
lofty mountains cannot block white clouds in flight.

Ascending the subtle purples of the Empyrean,
the Void-and-None Dao,
where primordial qi harmonizes of itself.

The dark mirror’s cleansing—few worthy scholars remain,
while those who cling to dust and turn from awakening are many,
frittering days in vain.

Open the Dharma-eye,
a single nature pierces through Saṃsāra.
Luminous, clear as autumn’s cold moon,
crystalline, like rippling waves of jade.
Pouring forth to moisten the numinous bough.

**Waves and Sands**

Seeking the Dao, consulting masters,
pledging vows, submitting petitions.
Be vigilant from beginning to end, diligent in cultivation.
Yield to others, advance the self, ever patient in humility,
all affairs governed by boundless compassion.

The mechanism of ascending immortals lies broken—
hold fast to rectitude, unwavering.
Uphold the practice of the Primordial Jade Purity.
When the sun of wisdom shines in the void, who shall illuminate it?
Stellar eyes, lingzhi brows.

**Two Songs of Picking Mulberries**

Strength and fate deride each other—
rely on truth to see who is right, who is wrong.
Once I sought the Western Gate at the Northern Palace;
know then the Eastern Wall’s words,
sincere and fair—why doubt the nurturing of simplicity?

The vulgar cannot comprehend.
Awaken the worthy and wise,
to walk my path in shared principle.
Rejoice in heaven’s decree, pass through life by following conditions.
When merit is complete in years to come,
the old path to the Divine Empyrean
holds our immortal tryst.

Our kind may well lament—
discarding the dark pearl,
adrift at the edge of heaven.
Floating clouds, flying catkins, rootless and anchorless,
the heart strays down divergent paths,
each rising thought leading steps astray.

Hear early the call of mist and rosy clouds—
within the immortal realm,
how fine to press onward!
The Three Mountains lie close, not far,
where the Jade Hall of Ever-Spring,
the twin shores of Lingxi,
brim with jasper blossoms.

**Two Songs of Wandering Hua-Xu**

On ancient banks, peach buds unfurl,
the new moon’s pure light intertwines in splendor.
How many in the dusty world glimpse this?
Only I fix my gaze with lofty intent.

A sigh—
a sigh—
turning back, the distant journey to immortal realms.

Roaring through the ancient wind, beneath the moonlit stream,
radiance gleams through the vast, limpid void.
Lovely eyes glance, clear and round,
vanishing, then waxing full again.

Light connects—
light connects—
jade osmanthus in frosty groves, crystalline and pure.

**Two Songs of Voicing Grievances**

Forest springs, a reclusive livelihood,
forsaking the clamor of prosperity.
The immortal of verdant Zhongshan peaks,
eyes brimming with numinous cinnabar.

Congealing the white elixir,
blending with cinnabar clouds,
bursting forth jasper blossoms.
Cloud waves, misty billows—
beyond the isles, Fanghu’s abode,
where dwell the people of that realm.

The Great Void, boundless and fathomless,
where no-qi blends at the center.
Glancing back, the revolving tripods,
jade liquid overflowing with golden sand.

Radiant spirit’s glow,
flashing beams of light,
shimmering jasper blossoms.
Clouds recede, waves subside,
the sea stills, the sky clears—
the vast expanse’s home.

**Night Travel by Boat**

Within the snow-washed pouch, no worldly things.
Carefree and indolent—who would constrain me?
No fear of hollow fame,
no glory, no disgrace.
How few follow in such lightness!

Alone I sit, plucking strings, the goblet brimming with fine wine.
With hairpin raised, I watch the drifting clouds unbroken.
Turtles glide on the pond,
cranes stride before the grotto,
wind and moon, water and mountain, pine and bamboo.

Alas for the splendid years spent plumbing profound truths—
midway stalled,
the teachings left masterless.

**The Daoist Abbey**

The abbey stands desolate,
old friends grown distant and faint—
how much worse the gloom of dusk’s sorrowful rain.

Alone I sit, a guest in silent emptiness,
my crimson heart laid bare—
who would fathom its depths?
Sweeping my sleeves, I return to the mountains,
to the depths of emerald streams,
to whisper to falling blossoms and flowing waters.

**Two Libations to the River Moon**

I. The wondrous Dao of serene emptiness,
merged with the dim and boundless,
pervades the subtle, the pure, the absolute.
Emerging before heaven, it illumines the Lord of Images,
filling the eye with streaming fragments of radiant mist.
The impure form dissolves,
jade scrolls flourish,
the sacred tripod’s elixir congeals.
The cinnabar bloom gathers its splendor,
pristine and profound, a single hue of clarity.

Essence □□□ fills the void,
clear as an autumn night,
the sea’s osmanthus untouched by wax or wane.
Shining through ancient and present, it pierces the luminous qi,
brimming like a jade flask of spring snow.
Resplendent as the sun’s pure essence,
the steadfast heart’s hidden purity,
it nourishes the true immortals’ delight.
The cinnabar script summons the decree—
ascending to the Three Luminaries in array.

II. The primordial Dao of the Mysterious Origin,
boundless, formless,
stands solitary in stillness and silence.
Pervading all directions, it links above and below,
its gaze stretching to the faintest glimmer of celestial light.
Concealing and revealing, vanishing and enduring,
piercing non-being to thread being,
its benevolent work leaves no trace.
Resonant and unconstrained, it releases transformation—
a single numinous essence in the vast expanse.

Ascending the forest, it penetrates true yang,
its perfect brightness illuminating all,
allowing not a speck of dust to hide.
The principle must inevitably unfold—yet still ungrasped,
I explain it plainly to my disciples.
The sun’s hall gleams with auspicious light,
the moon’s palace shimmers with propitious hues,
a thousand streams enriched by jade waves.
Spirit congeals, form dissolves—
the jasper cliffs stand as before, verdant and sheer.

**Three Southern Branch Songs**

I.
A blink—lost through kalpas,
a glance—separated by ten thousand peaks.
A single truth divides its auspice through twin gates,
merged with primordial chaos—
what difficulty remains?

The body crumbles, golden wings take flight,
yang’s doubt pierces the jade ring.
Suddenly awakened, I wash the dream-soul’s realm.
The lotus petals drift away, heartless,
beyond the world, alone in purity.

II.
The heart’s resolve is pure and steadfast,
the will’s truth unyielding and true.
Transcending the pitfalls of cessation and permanence,
the eye’s horizon widens,
radiant, illuminating the luminous clarity.

The brocade of heaven and earth gleams,
the intricate world shines.
The limpid void, like a flawless jade disc, instantly rounds into perfection.
Shedding the husk, the essence (目十爫十缶)—
a single star in the azure sky.

III.
Weary of stillness, I once dwelled in the marketplace;
disdaining clamor, I then lived in the mountains.

Where in the communion with the True is there no purity and leisure?
Within and without, I roam carefree,
unfettered by the climb for profit or renown.
The husk shed, I manifest in emptiness,
the form forgotten, I gaze beyond the world.

The two spirits congeal in pristine clarity, emerging through the Gate of Yang.
The crane’s nature, light and fleet,
departs for ancient Chang’an.

**Two Red-Window Poems**

Seek the Mystery Gate—cease your vain quests.
I point to you the true aim of cultivation:
ever pure and still, the mind unadrift,
preserve the primordial essence without loss.

Refine the yang soul, dissolve the yin substance.
Between the brows, the divine radiance takes flight.
Through the Dipper’s handle, turn the Celestial Pivot,
embrace the single wheel of the red sun.

Again—

Cast off worldly passions, return to true principle.
Strike the double gates, the Mystery Gate swings wide.
Spit forth the divine light, piercing the curtains and veils,
revealing the wondrous yang body.

The Golden Crow’s essence, the Jade Hare’s marrow—
illuminating heaven and earth, the pupils gleam with luminous clarity.
The distant red window blazes with radiant perfection,
shining through Penglai’s depths to the very end.

**Two "Pointing Crimson Lips" Poems**

Sword at back, staff in hand,
I tread the path, piercing the clouds.
The green moss parts—
beyond the misty pine screen,
I brush the stone and sit by the stream.

Wine drunk from a single cup,
a clear tune played in harmony.
Nothing is amiss—
who could compare as companion?
The bright moon, the pure wind, and I.

Lush hues swirl in mist,
thick and curling through the vast expanse.
Light flashes and flickers—
in dreamlike ease, a pearl is swallowed,
a single fetal star descends.

Exiled to the mortal realm,
I regret the errors of old.
Passions fade and wither—
I summon my disciples,
together we keep our pact with the Azure Capital.

**The Moon Shines on Layered Mountains**

The Dipper’s handle turns, uniting the single nature;
the jade pivot revolves, unlocking the double gates.
Towering waves churn, snow-like blossoms whirl—
mid-autumn night,
the moon shines on layered mountains.

Alone I pace the starry altar.
Sword-light slashes the corners of the heavens, chilling all who near.
Five Immortal Spirits cradle green simurghs,
soaring into the Hua-Xu paradise of dreams.

**The Peaceful Command**

In the Hall of Fungi, at ease, I open the cinnabar scriptures.
Incense smoke curls, the wisdom lamp burns bright.
Voices harmonize with flowing waters, the jade tones pure.
Clouds disperse, mists withdraw—
in a single glance, the Jade Pool’s purity spreads.
The Grotto-Heaven’s mystery shines, auspicious light congeals.
Clearly seen, suddenly awakened—
turning back, I re-enter the perfected Dao.
The form forgotten, I ascend in feathered transformation,
the Void Sovereign entrusts me with the celestial talisman.

**Two "Wu Ling Spring" Poems**

The Supreme’s Primal Unity qi,
luminous and pure as finest jade.
Clearer than drifting white clouds, unrolling or furling,
in clarity, the presence of non-being within being.

The cool, serene divine light sways in emptiness,
transforming without constraint.
Flowing above and below through the six voids—
a single night-shining pearl.

A single parasol leaf falls beyond the window,
golden chrysanthemums rise from the sparse fence.
Staff in hand, cap askew, I wander at ease,
bewildered by the winding Pool of Qujiang.
The crane’s chariot hurries back along the old path—
turning my head, I hasten toward the immortal’s tryst.
Clouds reflect the laughing Blue Lad’s query:
“Where is your home? By the Wu Ling Stream.”

**The Oriole’s Song**

Foolish old man, foolish old man,
deluded by illusions, lost in dreams,
a lifetime of confusion.
Why each day knit your brows,
vexing body and heart?
I urge you: turn back, return to the Great Dao,
plumb the profound mysteries of the arcane.
Refine the elixir’s light, merge with the Middle Origin—
reveal the jade countenance of the celestial hour.

**Cherishing the Tender Babe**

Suddenly awakened, I turn my head,
casting aside worldly affairs.
Swiftly gather the heart, hasten back to the Great Dao.
In emptiness seek the true,
transmit the luminous teaching from the formless.
Best of all—
the cinnabar blossom appears, the light returns in reflection.
Probe the subtle and profound, manifest the heaven’s abstruse depths.
Illumine within and without, the floating and sinking, the inversion.
One qi through the double gates,
blending the hundred spirits, dividing the three essentials.
Mysterious and wondrous—
auspicious clouds bear aloft
the jade countenance of the celestial hour.

**Variation on "Plucking the Cassia Branch"**

Clearly, beyond appearances, return to the ancestral origin—
the Dao-eye complete.
Coming and going, continuous and unbroken,
rising and falling, floating and sinking, free to wander.
Most profound and abstruse—
the sun’s essence, the moon’s marrow, placed within the furnace,
one qi refined and simmered.
The elixir congeals, firm and bright,
its radiance ascending to the heavens in dazzling purity.
Transformed, I fly as an immortal.

**Gazing Afar**

The Supreme Mystery’s wondrous secret—
once awakened, no need for words.
The mind-ground suddenly opens in enlightenment,
pure coolness pervades within.
Piercing the five aggregates’ mountain peak,
the mountain’s frosty sky reveals the bright moon,
illuminating all through the ages,
without wax or wane.

The Jade Child rests in the numinous palace—
nimbly pluck the cinnabar branch.
Delight in the realm of eternal spring,
penetratingly discerning the separation from birth and death.
Beneath the tree of no-shadow,
alone I sit in perfect stillness and freedom,
listening to the tuneless melody—
within it, a world apart.

**Ascending the Western Heights**

Awaken the mysterious essence, clarify the true qi,
penetrate the primordial within.
By day, the yang soul; by night, the yin spirit—they merge.
Internally divided into three hues,
yet blended into one like the lotus.
The jade hour’s round mirror,
auspicious clouds floating, their light striking the Jade Palace.
Dispersing the yin vapors, congealing the pure and refined,
returning the spirit to transformation, moving through the numinous void.
The bright image hangs suspended,
brilliant and resplendent.
Roaming the central heavens,
the lush rosy clouds’ jade tones pure.
Rainbow banners and feathered standards,
bearing the jade chariot, the treasure-scented immortal winds.

**Two "Spring in Qin Garden" Poems**

In this world, as a person,
none surpasses parents in profound virtue and deep grace.
From the ten months in the womb, three years of nursing,
turning dry for wet, how much toil endured?
Grown to adulthood, the five eyes of the heart arise—
outsiders sow discord, each leading their own gate.
Who awakens?
Like the owl facing its nest,
the karmic retribution circles back.

Cease this vain toil of the spirit.
Never forget the grace of the womb and nursing.
Recall the crow’s filial return, the gibbon’s evasion of arrows—
with sincere filial reverence, what curse could befall one?
In all matters, do not defy,
follow their countenance, harmonize their needs.
In food and drink, cold and warmth, use them in due measure.
Preserve this from beginning to end—
the Dao’s light shines across the four seas,
virtue spreads in pure sincerity.

Again—

In youth’s bloom, I suddenly awakened and turned back,
indulging my nature, following my truth.
Abandoning father, mother, brothers, and sisters-in-law,
wife, sons, nephews, and daughters—
a solitary cloud, a wild crane, for over twenty springs.
Like a drifting duckweed, I followed the winds,
settling wherever fate allowed,
letting others laugh at my indolence.
Do not blame me—
weary of life’s falsity and pretense,
I awakened to my former existence.

Clearly knowing the primordial spirit beyond appearances.

Radiant treasures, immaculate without blemish, unstained by dust.
Mastering the four seasons’ chariot,
pointing to heaven as canopy,
earth’s authority as carriage,
sun and moon as discourse.
Rolling through the starry river,
breaking through the Ox and Dipper,
gathering and dispersing the five-colored clouds afloat in the void.
Traversing the Three Realms,
manifesting the August Sage Ancestor of the Void,
the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning.

*To the tune of* "Court Full of Fragrance"

With grain sacks and bamboo hats,
through cloud-capped mountains and waterways,
enduring distant roads, undaunted by wind and frost.
To seek the celestial treasures,
I lay bare my heart to you.
First, the supreme principle reveals the One Nature;
then the Two Modes appear,
and the Three Palaces shine resplendent.
Beyond the Mystic Pass,
hovering in the void, luminous—
the rising sun spreads its crimson light.

All spirits,
each receiving their mandate—
who can preserve
the primal yang within the Jade Treasury?
Myriad gods intermingle in splendor,
the ninefold qi blends at the center.
A single Mystic Pearl is formed,
its divine radiance
illuminating the Southern Prosperity.
In the Liao-Yang Lodge,
entering and exiting the Flowering Chamber,
all join in singing *Court Full of Fragrance*.

*Upper Clarity’s Grand Mystery Collection*, Scroll Nine, concludes.

**Quatrain: Nurturing Vitality in Forest and Spring**

In quiet solitude, mountain dwelling excels—
a lone household ‘midst verdant peaks.
When asked, “What is the Dao?”
with a smile, I point to the cave’s rosy clouds.

In quiet solitude, mountain dwelling excels—
deep streams mirror the heavens.
When asked, “What is the Dao?”
with a smile, I point to the jade-green river.

In quiet solitude, mountain dwelling excels—
facing the wind beneath the moon’s glow.
When asked, “What is the Dao?”
with a smile, I point to the emerald mist.

In quiet solitude, mountain dwelling excels—
clouds stretch o’er the azure gorge.
When asked, “What is the Dao?”
with a smile, I point to frost in snow.

In quiet solitude, mountain dwelling excels—
haze lingers ‘twixt verdant ridges.
When asked, “What is the Dao?”
with a smile, I ask the white clouds.

In quiet solitude, mountain dwelling excels—
forest and spring span a jade flask.
When asked, “What is the Dao?”
with a smile, I point to a lone crane.

In quiet solitude, mountain dwelling excels—
yellow plum blossoms scent the garden.
When asked, “What is the Dao?”
with a smile, I point to light filling the sky.

In quiet solitude, mountain dwelling excels—
a solitary cloud seals the jade peak.
When asked, “What is the Dao?”
with a smile, I point to the crane soaring heavenward.

Unseal the nature’s awareness, realize the heart’s wisdom.
Wash away all contrivance,
no thought of Chan’s mechanism.
Strike through each and every one,
every thing withdraws its radiance.
The body merges with heaven’s emptiness, the sea’s stillness;
awakening reveals the ten thousand dharmas as nonexistent.
Within the Mystery, a fragrant breeze stirs,
the spirit transforms—moonlight spills full in the west.

**Eternal**
**Eternal, eternal.**

Still the sitting, dissolve the details.
Suddenly the still realm—awareness turns cool and clear.
The Radiant Youth opens the way,
guides into the immortal land.
Seal-script smoke veils earth’s beauty,
bright candles illuminate heaven’s light.
Bestowed with peach of immortality and cassia wine,
drunk and drowsing in lofty halls.
Suddenly a pure melody arises,
jade maidens vie to support me into the grotto chamber.

**Yang**
**Yang, yang.**
Pervading, filling all directions.
Virtue manifests transformation, the Dao expands.
Golden essence flows and scatters,
treasured seals emit radiance.
Light soars through the Milky Way’s bones,
crimson dyes the vast azure.
Reflecting back, not beyond daily use,
returning to the origin, first awakening to true constancy.
Stripping away pure yin, the ancient Dao is revealed,
the spirit elixir unimpeded—heaven’s eternity attained.

**Leisure**
**Leisure, leisure.**
Utmost sageliness, beyond the ordinary.
Morning in the still realm, departing the dusty world.
Truth intermingles with truth, each thing without attachment.
Water and clouds ever companions,
wind and moon the homeland.
Thirst quenched with cassia wine from the gourd,
drunk, alone reclining on Kun Mountain.
A single dream of roaming immortals—
freely, carefree between heaven and earth.

**Vermilion**
**Vermilion, vermilion.**

**Youthful Spring**
**Youthful spring, youthful spring—**
at sixteen, naturally paired,
breath shared in perfect accord.
Jade countenance, fair flesh,
elegant and refined.
Matched beneath embroidered curtains,
dreaming as one, startling awake.
Suddenly leaping from the silken chamber,
golden blossoms scattered in disarray.
Eyes fixed, never to part,
hearts in bright union circling the Morning Palace.

**Breath**
**Breath, breath—**
breath. Solitary, self-standing.
No outward invasion,
no inward intrusion.
Born of the true heart,
formless in essence.
Silent, the hall of utmost emptiness;
desolate, the chamber of stillness.
Two painted candles illumine the void,
their light mirroring a blazing sun.
What doubt remains in this truth?
In pure quiescence, all affairs are complete.

**Mystery**
**Mystery, mystery—**
mystery. Radiant, yet not dazzling.
Gazing at heaven,
soaring through the boundless sky.
The Supreme Polarity’s subtle profundity,
vast, without limit.
Moon on water mirrors the azure void,
reflecting back in luminous return.
Myriad methods awaken to the One Method,
the One Method held in three essentials.
Preserving the Three, guarding the One—qi and spirit clarified,
transmuting yang essence to descend through the nine apertures.

**Law**
**Law, law.**

No question,
no answer.
Penetrating the mysterious vision,
dwelling in absolute learning.
Beyond names and words,
knowing emptiness in sudden awakening.
Sudden awakening—Dao is without mind,
through mind, the same as the chick’s first peck.
Fused, sun and moon shine as one,
pervading mountains, rivers, seas, and peaks.
Heaven’s nature in humanity,
humanity’s nature in heaven—
naturally, a single nameless simplicity.

**Dao**
**Dao, Dao—**
Dao. Subtle,
profound.
True reality,
without form or appearance.
Mystery within mystery,
wonder within wonder.
Myriad things flourish of themselves,
their arising not by contrivance.
Revolving, sun and moon soar through the void;
scattered, they illumine the ten directions.
Awakened, there is no earth, no heaven—
the sage merely posits an empty name.

**Virtue**
**Virtue, virtue—**
Virtue. Nourishing,
all things.
Pervading east and west,
penetrating south and north.
Resplendent yet formless,
the great void silent.
Splitting open the marrow of dragon and phoenix,
shattering the sinews and bones of heaven.
Golden essence scatters in streaming radiance,
piercing through the cosmos in vagueness.
Spirit-light, dazzling, coalesces into a crimson mass—
gathered, it enters the cavern of the golden crow.

**Water**
**Water, water.**

**Trickling, trickling,**
unceasing.
Above, no waves;
below, no bottom.
Welling and surging in the void,
dragon’s fat and phoenix’s marrow.
A single taste irrigates the heart-field,
moistening and nurturing the body of cultivated truth.
Skin pure as frost and snow,
pure yang naturally void of yin ghosts.
Bright eyes lift the brows beyond the great void—
without moving a step, one rises in empty space.

**Pool**
**Pool, pool, pool.**
Willow banks,
dikes that droop.
Dividing water-valleys,
illumining cold streams.
Golden waves lightly ripple,
jade liquid pours in abundance.
The silver toad casts snowy billows,
dazzling the eye with boundless depths.
A single moistening sets valley streams flowing in relief;
harmony surges, myriad transformations rest in ease.
The flowery pool’s divine water exists in every household—
the adept acts without acting, without striving.

**Fluid**
**Fluid, fluid.**
Spontaneous,
ebbing and flowing.
Nurturing clear flesh,
cultivating numinous substance.
Externally aligning with the celestial circuit,
internally merging with the chamber of spirit.
The Palace of Fire brims and overflows,
the eye beholds pristine light dripping.
Mysterious frost congeals into a rich balm,
essence blazes red as the scorching sun.
A single speck of the fetal star transcends the immortal palace—
the face reveals the Three Clarities’ work complete.

**Elixir**
**Elixir, elixir.**

**Heaven and Earth,**
**between them.**
Soaring phoenixes distant, fire dragons wheeling.
Pivotal mechanisms gather the essential,
revolving the Golden Gate.
Gathering the essence of the Three Luminaries,
reversing the cycle through the Seven Apertures.
A single pellet enfolds the cosmos,
transforming to inhale plum blossoms and swallow mountains.
Feeding on enlightenment, ascending to court the Purple Palace—
inscribed in the Jade Register, ranked among the immortals’ host.

**Nature**
**Nature, nature.**
Numinous source,
communing with the sage.
No awareness, no seeing or hearing.
Clear as a cold spring,
luminous as a precious mirror.
Reflecting yet formless,
things arrive and respond in kind.
Knowing the heart departs from desire to contemplate emptiness,
facing circumstances, right and wrong distinguish themselves.
Lodging at night in the Toad Palace to pluck osmanthus,
at dawn leaping into the Golden Crow’s path.

**Life**
**Life, life.**
Let it not
contend or compete.
Move with the seasons, respond to their flow.
Pure, still, and serene,
perfect in bearing, qi abundant.
Essence securely preserved, spirit whole—
only then does the true heart settle.
Blood within the body transmutes to balm,
flesh and bone equally fuse, lustrous and clear.
The elixir perfected, pure yang emerges from the Five Phases—
a decree descends from the Jade Void, proclaiming the mandate.

**Lead**
**Lead, lead.**

Boundless, without edge.
Essence dense and lush, qi unbroken and flowing.
Movement gives birth to the ten thousand things,
stillness of the sea, profound and dark.
The profound and dark—marrow of heaven and earth,
movement and stillness—root and origin of the Dao.
Seen, yet neither nonexistent nor existent,
heard, yet silent and hushed.

A jade flask, ice-pure, cleanses heart and bone,
deep and vast as clouds, the sky of snow and moon.

**Mercury**
**Mercury, mercury.**
Still,
unmoving.
The Dao’s passage,
the spirit’s function.
Piercing gold, penetrating stone,
a sword cleaving the seamless.
The jade infant cradles the precious moon,
playfully toying with crystal.

A day of silver mist, interwoven with light,
glittering neither far nor near.
Wielded as the sacred ancestor’s Daoist wind,
ancient tones pierce the pure, pure resonance.

**Principle**
**Principle, principle.**
Sun’s essence,
moon’s marrow.
Above, it connects to heaven,
below, it penetrates earth.
Within and without, they merge—
its spirit not spectral.
Radiant, blazing the celestial thoroughfare,
brilliant, its light enters the body.
Square or round, curved or straight, following form,
supreme goodness—heart deep as water.
Congealing in emptiness, crystalline and clear,
profound and luminous, fused to the very depths.

**One**
**One, one.**

**Difficult to embody, difficult to practice.**
Crooked yet aligned with the upright,
bent yet attuned to the straight.
The great square has no corners,
solitary in vast stillness.
Clear as day before one’s eyes,
yet the man facing it does not recognize.
Grasping or relinquishing—neither adds nor subtracts,
seeking yields no end, no limit.

From ancient times, the one luminous true nature manifests,
turning light back to fill the true void of the Great Emptiness.

**Profound**
**Profound, profound.**
Vast as the boundless paths,
minute as the distant byways.
Beyond all seeking,
without flaw or blame.
Neither being nor non-being,
neither void nor form.
Vastness so immense it has no breadth,
subtlety so fine it has no narrowness.
Ponder it—spirit scatters in silent vastness,
contemplate it—soul dissolves like drifting clouds.
Endless, infinite, unknowable,
now departing, now arriving, like a passing traveler.

**Vague**
**Vague, vague.**
Heaven and earth,
sealed and brimming.
Within the primordial chaos,
congealed in the valley of emptiness.
Empty yet not empty,
things yet no things.
Something exists, merged with the mysterious origin,
the mysterious origin surging with supreme virtue.
Divine radiance—dim and obscure,
Dao’s transformation—hushed and silent.
Suddenly, one truth seizes heaven’s mechanism,
the true rule of the Great One within the alchemical crucible.

**Mysterious**
**Mysterious, mysterious.**
The Supreme Ultimate,
boundless.
Below, it shifts earth,
above, it connects to heaven.
Essence of the Three Luminaries refined,
one qi luminously transmitted.
The furnace gate opens two paths,
dragon and tiger contend in the vanguard.
Playfully coaxing the bright pearl from the sea,
casting it skyward, rolling earthward with thunderous clamor.
Once the elixir is formed, shedding the husk to wander the Three Isles,
carefree in the Penglai gardens, years uncounted.

**Numinous**
**Numinous, numinous.**

Qi flourishes, spirit clarifies.
Congealing to chase the moon, dazzling to outrace the stars.
In high emptiness, gracious illumination;
across the great earth, purity and brightness.
Luminous as ice and snow,
translucent as crystal.
Vast and shimmering, heaven and earth gleam immaculate;
radiant and resplendent, the realm knows perfect peace.
The five directions’ rosy hues gather into the crucible,
the twin luminaries’ intersecting light enters the precious vase.

**Heaven**
**Heaven, heaven.**
Profound, profound.
Master of a thousand mechanisms,
wielder of ten thousand transformations.
Gazing upward—ever more lofty;
delving deeper—ever more steadfast.
Above, it invades the realm of Primordial Beginning;
below, it blankets the boundless vast.
Limpid beyond the Five Phases,
obscure before the Eight Trigrams.
At first division, one qi at the head of the Three Powers;
alone and solitary, it precedes the Emperor of Images.

**Mechanism**
**Mechanism, mechanism.**
Embodying the Dao, the heart knows.
Opening the eye of wisdom,
awakening to the subtle and silent.
Shifting spirit through ten thousand changes,
wondrous transformation through non-action.
Non-action generates one qi,
one qi moves the Three Marvels.
Blending the refined and the anciently pure,
passing through movement, stillness, and abiding without doubt.
Perceiving things, the heart illumines—yet the heart departs from things;
in profound obscurity, bearing and demeanor transcend convention.

**Stream**
**Stream, stream.**

Ancient banks, golden dikes.
Filling the Dao-eye, wisdom’s radiance shines.
Trickling without cease,
flowing into the celestial pool.
Azure waters open the pure valley,
profound depths stir the boundless vast.
Along the banks, fish sport in play;
from the wave’s heart, a sacred tortoise leaps forth.
Its mouth sprays crimson mist where golden sands congeal,
nurturing the divine elixir to match the sacred mechanism.

**Pill**
**Pill, pill, pill.**
Gathered in a pinch, brows knit in concentration.
Piercing the Dao-eye, embodying the profound mystery.
Responding to things, the mechanism appears;
adapting to all shapes, assuming every form.
Illumining the numinous yang’s awakening,
the mind’s clarity expands the dharma-realm.
Heaven and earth cycle with sun and moon;
in the void, tigers coil and dragons entwine.
The elixir terrace cradles the Three Luminaries’ blaze,
a flawless, gleaming orb of jade.

**Sprout**
**Sprout, sprout, sprout.**
Merit deepens, wonders multiply.
Rooted firmly, let nothing stray.
Constantly replenish mercury’s waters,
daily advance lead’s sands.
The numinous shoot first emerges from soil,
unfolding into golden blossoms of beauty.
Tender beyond Chang’e’s cinnamon,
verdant as the Queen Mother’s immortal blooms.
Gathered, it may attend the Ever-Spring Assembly;
boldly, it may boast in Jasper Pool or Penglai’s gardens.

**Snow**
**Snow, snow.**

No cold, no chill.
Within existence it arises, in emptiness it is arrayed.
Ethereal without gap, crystalline and translucent.
Shimmering, the Great Void brightens;
resplendent, its light gleams pure.
The boundless sky, silken as a silver river;
the vast earth, cleansed like jade dust.
The scorching red sun cannot melt it—
through all seasons it keeps company with the high moon.

**Thus**
**Thus, thus.**
Most wondrous, profoundly mysterious.
Illumining true nature, nurturing the numinous source.
Transmitted yet not conferred,
its meaning grasped beyond words.
The Three Fields brim with lush essence;
with every breath, qi flows unbroken.
Inhaling and exhaling, never leaving the Mysterious Female—
do not take mouth or nose as the cause.
Within the wuwei crucible, the Three Flowers bloom;
from the red furnace, the seven-petaled lotus emerges.

**Secrecy**
**Secrecy, secrecy.**
No form, no trace.
Drawing in the pure wind, summoning the gracious sun.
Serene and solitary,
vast and independent.
A thousand points of pristine light,
ten thousand streams of numinous essence.
Within it, a luminous pearl is born—
once refined, the Embryonic Immortal is complete.
Leisurely, it emerges from the Three Realms’ surging waves,
knowing the destination on Penglai’s path.
