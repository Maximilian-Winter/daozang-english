**The Yuanqingzi’s Attainment of Destiny**

**Title:** *The Yuanqingzi’s Attainment of Destiny*. Two fascicles. Composed by Wang Qingsheng of the Southern Song. Based on the text from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Great Mystery Section.

**Preface to *The Yuanqingzi’s Attainment of Destiny***

The human heart and the heart of the Dao—these speak of the fulfillment of one’s nature. If nature is truly fulfilled, then destiny may be attained. The Dao that can be spoken of and the eternal Dao—these speak of the attainment of destiny. If one’s nature remains unfulfilled, how can destiny be reached? Those who abandon nature and destiny in pursuit of the Dao have never found it.

Nature and destiny are one. Some exist and perish; some attain longevity and never perish. Some live and die; some attain longevity and never die. To exist and perish, to live and die—such is the way of all under heaven. Yet people see only the commonality and not the difference, and so there are those who dare not speak of immortals!

Since the opening of the cosmos, immortals have existed in the vastness of space, though their names were not yet known. Only with the emergence of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi did their names and persons gradually become manifest. From the Qin and Han onward, their names grew ever more illustrious, yet their persons became ever harder to encounter.

For some time, I have devoted myself to the study of nature and destiny. Fortunately, Heaven did not withhold the Dao, and I received oral instructions from a perfected one. His words were simple, his methods easy—truly, one could achieve this in an instant. Yet without great virtue and power, without great capacity, one cannot swiftly practice them.

I lament that the span of life is fleeting as lightning, elusive as a spark struck from stone, its course uncertain, its end unknowable. I sigh for those in the world who are so earnest in their pursuits, yet so readily deceived by fraud and delusion—mistaking swallows for phoenixes, foxes for steeds, slandering the sages of old, leading later generations astray. Boldly defying the teachings of the Most High, they endure the truths of the Buddha. Lost in confusion, they draw one another deeper into error, and such cases are everywhere.

If no clear signs or teachings are left behind, I fear the subtle workings of the Dao may vanish entirely. Thus, though I am unworthy, I dare not remain silent. Following the golden elixir methods transmitted by my teacher, I have composed this *Attainment of Destiny*, recording it on humble paper to edify those of like mind.

Herein are described the establishment of the furnace and cauldron, the regulations of fire times, the methods of wild battle and guarding the city, the bathings and spiritual rebirth—all are set forth with clarity, yet embody the true Dao. The reader should attend to them with utmost care.

Should one, by fortunate encounter, attain the joy of enlightenment at dawn, and test these words against experience, all doubts will melt away like ice, and the principles will align with perfect ease—like reclaiming a long-lost treasure with the left tally. Would this not be a great blessing?

Written by Yuanqingzi of Guozhai, Wang Qingsheng, in the autumn of the third day of the seventh month of the *jiyou* year of the Chunyou era (1249).

**Furnace and Cauldron Establishment Diagram**

The Perfected One of Purple Yang said:
First take Qian and Kun as the furnace and cauldron,
Then gather the Crow and Hare to refine the medicine.
Once the two are driven into the Yellow Way,
How could the numinous elixir fail to take form?

He also said:
The method of establishing furnace and cauldron follows Qian and Kun,
Tempering essence and refining spirit to master hun and po.
Gathering and dispersing, the misty vapors transform—
Who dares treat such profound mysteries as idle discourse?

He further stated:
The sun dwells in Li yet reverses to become the female,
Kan pairs with the Toad Palace to become the male.
If one fails to grasp this inversion within,
Do not vainly discuss such matters with shallow insight.

Again he said:
Every person possesses the medicine of long life,
Yet fools cast it aside in delusion.
When sweet dew descends, Heaven and Earth unite;
Where the Yellow Sprout arises, Kan and Li converge.
The well-frog may claim no dragon’s cavern exists,
The hedge-gull may dispute the phoenix’s nest—
Yet when the elixir ripens, gold naturally fills the chamber.
Why seek herbs to burn as straw?

Diagrams are images, and images embody things;
Poems are words, and words convey principles.
To know the image, seek it in the words;
To know the words, seek them in the image.
When words and images are manifest, things become evident.
If one clings to the image while grasping the words,
One has not truly attained the image;
If one clings to the words while grasping the image,
One has not truly attained the words.
Those who rigidly adhere to words and images
Cannot discuss the Dao.
Only when words and images fuse as one
Does one speak of the Dao.

**Advancing the Talismans and Progressing the Fire Diagram**

The Perfected One of Purple Yang said:
The eldest son first drinks the wine of the western quarter—
Zhen transforms into Dui, and divine water is born.
The youngest daughter first opens the flower of the northern land—
Dui transforms into Qian, and the golden flower congeals:
This is the method of wild battle.
If the Azure Maiden and her consort meet thereafter—
Qian transforms into Xun, and the first yin arises.
Then the gates of the Yellow House must be sealed.
When yang reaches its peak, yin is born;
Fire cannot be ceaselessly advanced—
It must be concealed with earth:
This is the method of guarding the city.

He also said:
Between the waxing and waning crescents,
After Zhen transforms into Dui, it is the time after the first crescent;
Before Xun transforms into Gen, it is the time before the last crescent.
The medicine’s flavor is balanced, its qi complete—
The medicine is the primordial single breath.
At the time between crescents, its qi and essence are pure,
Neither excessive nor deficient.
When gathered and returned to the furnace for refinement,
"Gathering" means obtaining the primordial single qi,
Whose resonance arises naturally,
Like a lodestone attracting iron—
Not the "gathering" of plucking and harvesting.
"Returned" means that the primordial single qi
Is originally no other thing,
But one’s own property from before the Great Ultimate divided.
Lost in the mire of passions and desires,
One forgets to return.
Now, having regained this single qi,
One causes it to return to its root—
Hence, "returned."
This is the meaning of "recognizing what the wind blows back to nurture at home."
"Refined in the furnace" means pouring it into the Eastern Yang crucible of creation.
"Tempered into gentle nurturing, like simmering fresh fish"—
"Tempered" means completing one cycle of the fire times.
"Gentle nurturing" means warm and harmonious preservation—
After wild battle ceases, one must guard the city.
"Like simmering fresh fish" follows the principle Laozi spoke of:
Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish.

He further said:
The sun and moon meet once every thirty days—
As the sun and moon cycle within a month,
They unite at the new moon, forming a single disk.
By exchanging days for hours, the work becomes divine—
The great yang completes a celestial circuit in 360 days in a year,
The great yin completes a celestial circuit in 360 hours in a month.
I condense the qi-markers of a year into a single day,
And the qi-markers of a day into a single hour—
Is this not divine work?
Some, using the hexagrams *Zhun* at dawn and *Meng* at dusk,
Model the twelve lines of the two hexagrams on the twelve hours,
Calling it "hexagram refinement"—
Is this not lamentable?

Guarding the city and wild battle determine fortune and misfortune—
Guarding the city is gentle nurturing;
Wild battle is advancing the fire.
Knowing fortune and misfortune means:
After Zhen transforms into Dui, it is "the dragon seen in the field";
After Dui transforms into Qian, it is "the flying dragon in the heavens"—
Both are "timely for meeting the great person," hence auspicious.
Yet before Zhen transforms, it is "the hidden dragon, do not act";
After Qian transforms, it is "the dragon soaring too high, with regret"—
"Act not" and "regret" are inauspicious.
Knowing this, one guards the city or wages wild battle appropriately.
When the elixir ripens, the crucible overflows with red—
Knowing inauspicious times, one guards the city;
Knowing auspicious times, one wages wild battle.
Neither battle nor guard misses its proper moment.
Each day brings its own attainment,
And the numinous cinnabar fills the divine chamber with radiance.

**Nine Cycles of Success Diagram**

The Perfected One of Purple Yang said:
On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, admire the toad’s radiance—
The toad’s radiance is the moon, the essence of metal.
The eighth month is *you*, the season when metal is born in *si* and flourishes in *you*.
Thus, when the moon reaches the fifteenth of the eighth month,
Its brilliance is purer than in other months—
It has attained its proper time.
This is precisely when the metal’s essence is robust—
"Precisely" means before this, it is tender; after this, it is aged.
"Robust" means neither tender nor old.
When the first yang arises in *fu*—
The fifteenth of the eighth month is not the time to advance the fire;
One must await the proper moment—
The time of the Yellow Bell, when the first yang is born.
Though it is the time of the Yellow Bell,
It is specifically the seventh day of *fu*.
Then one must advance the fire without delay—
Having obtained the medicine and encountered the proper time,
One must advance the fire.
Any hesitation would lead to endless errors.

He also said:
In the months of the Hare and Rooster, when the time arrives—
The Hare and Rooster are the months of *mao* and *you*.
"When the time arrives" means reaching this moment.
The axes of punishment and virtue stand at the gate of the medicine’s image—
Punishment is execution; virtue is generation.
Metal governs righteousness and administers execution—hence, punishment.

Wood governs benevolence and administers generation—hence, virtue. In the month of *mao*, when wood flourishes, metal is conceived; this is a month where virtue contains punishment. In the month of *you*, when metal flourishes, wood is conceived; this is a month where punishment contains virtue. "Standing at the gate" means that when the sun emerges at *mao*, the moon wanes, and when the moon waxes at *you*, the sun wanes—*mao* and *you* are the gates of the sun and moon, where punishment and virtue stand. "The image of the medicine" refers to the alchemical method of metal, wood, sun, and moon.

Upon reaching this point, the golden cinnabar must be bathed. "Upon reaching this point" means from the return of the first yang to this stage. Golden cinnabar is the essence of metal; the Yellow Sprout is the metal within water. Its names are many, and one need not be fixated. "Must be bathed" means to cleanse and purify the mysterious mirror—the heart. As the *Zhouyi Shuogua* states: "The meaning of the six lines is easy to offer; the sage uses this to wash the heart and retreat into secrecy." The act of bathing is the meaning of washing. If fire is added at this stage, peril will surely follow. In the months of *mao* and *you*, one must only withdraw the fire and guard the city, washing the heart and retreating into secrecy. If fire is added, peril is certain.

He also said:
The Mysterious Pearl takes form as yang is born.
The Mysterious Pearl is true mercury, the Enlightened Maiden. As the *Cantong Qi* states: "By the river, the Enlightened Maiden, most numinous and divine, takes flight when fire is applied, vanishing without a trace of dust. Ghosts hide and dragons conceal, their whereabouts unknown; to restrain her, the Yellow Sprout is the root." "Takes form" means that once true mercury obtains the Yellow Sprout, it cannot flee but congeals into a pearl. The *Longhu Jing* states: "Regulate the fire for sixty days, and transformations will naturally manifest. Within the divine chamber, an image appears, shaped like an egg." "As yang is born" means following the return of the first yang, obtaining the Yellow Sprout and forming it.

When yang reaches its peak, yin dissipates and gradually sheds its form.
"Yang reaches its peak" refers to the time of the *Guai* hexagram, when yang, born at *Fu*, flourishes at *Guai* and culminates at *Qian*. "Yin dissipates" means that at *Guai*, yin diminishes to one remaining line. "Gradually sheds its form" does not refer to the *Bo* hexagram’s stripping away but to the near exhaustion of six yin lines, which are shed to transform into the pure yang vigor of *Qian*. In the tenth month, when frost flies, the elixir begins to ripen. The tenth month is when the Dipper points to *hai*; though yin must be stripped away, the elixir is not yet ripe. One must wait until the tenth month for the embryo to be released. At this time, even gods and ghosts must be startled—this is the meaning of the four images converging, the mysterious body complete, the five phases united in purple radiance, the embryo released and ingested to attain numinous sageliness, causing endless dragons and spirits to lose their composure in awe.

He also said:
Within the hexagrams, images are established as models.
"Images established within the hexagrams" refers to the progression from *Zhen* to *Kun*, the cycles of *Gou* and *Fu*, the twelve hexagrams, the pre- and post-heaven eight trigrams, the sixty-four hexagrams from *Zhun* at dawn to *Meng* at dusk, and the four hexagrams of *Qian*, *Kun*, *Li*, and *Kan*—all are established as images for verification. Thus, they are called fundamental models.

When the image is grasped, words may be forgotten, and meaning becomes clear.
As the *Zhouyi Lüeli* states: "The image conveys meaning; words clarify the image. To fully express meaning, nothing surpasses the image; to fully express the image, nothing surpasses words. Words arise from the image, so one may follow words to observe the image; the image arises from meaning, so one may follow the image to observe meaning. Meaning is exhausted by the image, and the image is made manifest by words. Thus, words clarify the image, and when the image is grasped, words may be forgotten; the image preserves meaning, and when meaning is grasped, the image may be forgotten. It is like the snare that captures the rabbit—once the rabbit is caught, the snare is forgotten; the fish trap that catches the fish—once the fish is caught, the trap is forgotten. Therefore, words are the snare of the image, and the image is the fish trap of meaning. Thus, those who cling to words do not grasp the image, and those who cling to the image do not grasp the meaning."

Later generations of deluded followers fixate only on images, practicing hexagram qi in hopes of ascending to immortality.
Master Yunfang said: "How can the great Dao be conveyed through words? Boyang borrowed the *Yi* to compose the *Cantong Qi*. Later people, failing to recognize the immortals’ metaphors, cling to the fish traps and snares and proceed with their work."

Here ends the first scroll of *Yuan Qingzi’s Treatise on Attaining Destiny*.

Composed by Wang Qingsheng of Guozhou, Fruit Studio
*Entering the Dao Poems*

The fleeting fame and merit of this floating world are but a bubble on water—
Who among the living endures a hundred years?
Even if one could long occupy the thrones of Ji and Jiang,
To leave no grace upon the people would be shameful indeed.

Bone-deep poverty must be endured with equanimity;
Though Yan and Fan were poor, their names renewed.
No matter how vast the wealth to rival a state,
Who knows to whom the body belongs when death arrives?

The debts of fly-like profit and snail-like fame are written in green—
Best to repay them all and leave the rest to Heaven.
Whether great or small, cease craving debt,
For waiting until abundance comes may never be.

If one schemes for wealth and honor to glorify kin,
How many truly nurture the will and serve their parents’ faces?
Acting within one’s station without defiance
Surpasses feasting on tripods and arrays of delicacies.

People hope for grand tombs and burning yellow papers,
Yearning for titles and ranks to shine like thick night-jade.
Nine generations ascend to Heaven by the Emperor’s grace,
Yet only one child enters the immortal realm.

Fu Xi and Wen, Confucius—all preceded Heaven,
Each setting forth subtleties in the *Yi*’s chapters.
Without the true principle of yin and yang,
Side paths and crooked trails are but vain effort.

The great image of Heaven and Earth is but yin and yang,
The essence of Qian and Kan is the light of sun and moon.
Failing to grasp the waxing and waning of their cycles,
One must be deaf and blind—or else mad.

Seeking the Dao, one fears only not meeting the true;
Having met the true, one is perplexed—who is this person?
Let virtue and conduct be your ladder and steps—
Why cling to vines and torment yourself?

Timing and opportunity do not arise by chance;
Though human effort plays its part, Heaven too is involved.
When merit is deep and virtue thick, Heaven grants its favor,
And one’s name is inscribed in the Jade Register—bones become immortal of themselves.

On warfare: do not wait for the first yang to stir.
Train in assault chariots until fear is gone.
Leaping in the abyss, test yourself—
No need for campaigns to subdue enemy forces.

When the time is right to begin work, begin;
A hundred years pass like a tumbleweed in flight.
What the young do not value, the old will—
The great elixir cannot heal hollow marrow.

Leap years bring calamity—calculate them in advance.
Do not act recklessly with yang’s might or yin’s deviation.
Wait for the return of the first yang,
When the Dipper points northeast and the moon sinks west.

Night after night, the work remains the same:
Kan’s boy and Li’s girl rejoice together.
Focus the mind until yin and yang are full—
Then rein in the horse, cease the war, and the kingdom will be at peace.

Nine cycles of the golden elixir, nine months to completion,
The wood-metal embryo thrives—best to settle in meditation.
When pure Kun is within the moon and pure Qian is full,
Take the immortal ladle and pour wine for the drunken immortals.

The noble scholar values clarity and emptiness,
Chasing shadows, pursuing wind, angling for fire-fish.
Grand theories and lofty discourse startle the world,
Yet even Lord Lao ultimately dreaded turning back his carriage.

The petty youths of the marketplace do not understand the heart,
Clinging to side doors to study yin-cultivation.
Sitting atop the Three Peaks, they end as ghosts—
Who knows the Dao of immortals has its rises and falls?

The wondrous substance of pre-Heaven is rarely understood;
All call their own names in the void.
When the Great Ultimate returns to the Ultimateless,
It is called the Imperial Ultimate—only then does long life begin.

Ten thousand volumes of alchemical texts share one name,
Yet distinguishing gold-sand from jade-stone is difficult.
Unless one is born with the bones of an immortal,
It is not easy to teach you to wash your eyes and see.

The golden elixir’s supreme medicine is no common thing;
Fortunately, the Western Flower revealed this method.
Though it exists in Heaven, there is no way to obtain it—
Accumulate merit until you reach Xu Jingyang.

*To the tune "Spring in Qin Garden"*
The seven-return elixir of restoration...

*The Kinship of the Three* states:
Nine returns, seven reversions,
Eight settles, six abides—
Male white, female red,
Metal and fire constrain each other,
Then water stabilizes fire,
The inception of the Five Phases.

Supreme goodness is like water,
Clear yet without flaw—
The Dao’s form and image,
Truly difficult to depict.
Transformed and dispersed,
Each dwells in solitude.

The Perfected of Purple Yang said:
Seven reversions—cinnabar returns to its root;
Nine returns—golden liquor restores the true.
Do not reckon by *yin* and *zi*, *kun* and *shen*;
Only observe the Five Phases as your standard.
It is but a single taste of mercury,
Circulating through all the celestial stems.
When yin and yang’s qi is full, it becomes numinous of itself—
Entering and exiting, how could it depart from the Mysterious Female?

Water is born from one and completed in six;
Fire is born from two and completed in seven;
Wood is born from three and completed in eight;
Metal is born from four and completed in nine.
Six and eight are yin, thus they settle and abide, unused;
Seven and nine are yang, thus seven reversions and nine returns.
The meaning of the seven-reversion elixir lies herein.

For the practitioner, one must first refine the self and await the moment.
Entering the gate of elixir refinement—
Three thousand six hundred methods
All serve to refine the self and await the moment,
Yet this is merely called solitary yin, not pure yang.

Master Yunfang said:
Three thousand six hundred gates of Daoist arts—
Each disciple clings to one as their root.
How could they know this trifling immortal’s technique
Lies beyond those three thousand six hundred gates?

Moreover, the transmission of the Master’s Dao—how could it be many gates?
Your foundation will surely be set forth in order.
First teach the peaceful methods of side gates,
Then gradually instruct in the principles of nurturing lead.

To refine the self and await the moment,
One must first practice the method of peace and ease.

When the first yang stirs anew,
The Perfected of Purple Yang said:
On the fifteenth of the eighth month, admire the toad’s radiance—
Precisely when metal’s essence is robust and flourishing.
When the first yang arises in revival,
Swiftly advance the fire—do not delay.

The first stirring of the true yang is the month of *jianzi*,
Its day marked by the Dipper.
*The Scripture of Numinous Treasure* says:
"Revolve the Dipper, traverse the Winnowing Basket"—
Thus it is.

When the midnight water-clock stretches long,
*The Scripture of Dragon and Tiger* states:
"Take the ninth day as the appointed time,
Yang’s harmony aligns with dawn and dusk.
Circling in accord with Heaven’s heart,
The yang line completes at *si*.
The peak of yin arises at high noon,
From *ding* to *hai* it ends.
Water and fire array in one direction—
Guarding their bounds, they form cold and heat."

Since yang is born at *zi*,
It is called "the midnight water-clock stretches long."

The lead crucible warms gently—
Lead is true lead:
In *kan*, it is black lead;
In *li*, it is red lead.
Red lead is mercury within cinnabar,
And mercury also has two names:
In *li*, it is vermilion mercury;
In *kan*, it is black mercury.
Black mercury is silver within lead.

The crucible is the cauldron—
The furnace and cauldron prize warmth and abhor cold.
If the crucible is cold, black mercury is scant—
One may gather red lead to augment it,
And with lead obtained, mercury arises of itself.
If the furnace is cold, red lead is scant—
Mercury cannot generate lead,
And one should swiftly remedy this,
For not only is it unprofitable,
But it may even harm oneself.

Light pierces the curtain and screen—
Light is moonlight:
On the fifteenth of the eighth month, gaze upon the toad’s radiance—
This is the light to behold.
When the moon’s orb is perfectly round and lustrous,
Its light pierces the curtain and veil—
Only then may one advance in practice.

Master Yunfang said:
"Seal the mouth, lower the curtain, silently observe—
A sky full of white snow scatters in disarray.
When the thighs stir, gather it swiftly—do not let it slip,
Await the moment when the full moon rises."
This is what it means.

Creation’s forces contend in haste—

The workings of creation are the divine and true—this is what the *Lingbao Scripture* calls the "numerical descent of the divine and true." With each ascent and descent, their wondrous function knows no end; whether coming or going, the interplay of yin and yang remains unfathomable—hence the term "contending in haste."

**Dragon and tiger unite in mating.**
The tiger is lead: in *dui*, it is the White Tiger; in *kan*, the Black Tiger—this is true mercury, the mercury of the dragon. The dragon is mercury: in *zhen*, it is the Azure Dragon; in *li*, the Vermilion Dragon—this is true lead. Though their names differ, in essence they are one and the same. From Non-Ultimate to Supreme Ultimate, dragon and tiger stand apart; when the Supreme Ultimate returns to the Imperial Ultimate, tiger and dragon unite in mating.

**Advancing the fire in the region of Ox and Dipper is perilous.**
Laozi said: "No misfortune is greater than underestimating the enemy; underestimating the enemy nearly cost me my treasure." He also said: "He who dares with reckless courage courts death; he who dares not with restraint preserves life." These two paths may bring either benefit or harm—the peril of advancing the fire lies herein.

**Above the Winding River,**
The Winding River is the Primordial Sea, what the *Lingbao Scripture* calls the "Gate of Life" and the *Cantong Qi* terms the "Pivot of the Dao." **Gaze upon the moon’s radiant purity:**
The moon is the Great Yin, within it lies the hare—yin within yang. The sun is the Great Yang, within it lies the crow—yang within yin. Yin is rooted in yang, yang in yin—this is the natural Dao. This moon’s radiance is not the moon of external phenomena but the moon of inner vision—is it not the moon within *li*? The Perfected One has a verse:
*"Before heaven and earth split, how could things be distinguished?
Only by cleaving the vast chaos apart.
Words fail to speak it, knowing fails to utter—
The wondrous secret is hard to fathom,
For those who grasp it are rare in this world.
To know yin and yang inverted:
The sun within the moon, the moon within the sun."*
This is what is meant by the moon’s radiance—it is the supreme treasure of the *White Tiger’s Head Scripture*. The Perfected One of Purple Yang said: "The treasure of the *White Tiger’s Head Scripture* is the divine water of the Flowery Pond, true gold." Thus we know the source of the highest good runs deep, unlike ordinary medicinal substances. If one seeks to refine the Nine Cycles, one must first cultivate the self and stabilize the mind, gather in due season to assess the floating and sinking, and advance the fire while guarding against peril.

**To gaze earnestly** is to embrace at dawn; **to be pure and unsullied** is to be clear and unclouded. **A crow takes flight—**
This is the crow within the sun, yin within yang. "Flight" signifies ascent and soaring.

**Then drink the knife and jade measure of your own accord.**
The knife and jade measure are the dual functions of metal and earth: the knife is metal, sharp-edged and keen as a blade. Used with the Dao, it can swiftly lead to immortality; misused in defiance of the Dao, it may bring about one’s ruin—hence the name "knife." The jade measure refers to the two earths of *li* and *kan*—it is a metaphor, not a literal jade object. "To drink" is to follow the *Yinfu Jing*’s principle of "consuming in due season."

**How could one trust that a child could be nurtured from nothing?**
The *Dragon-Tiger Scripture* states: "All phenomena arise from emptiness." It also says: "Refining silver from lead, the divine substance generates itself." That primordial essence, formless, responds to the diffusion of spirit and qi, subtly penetrating and congealing within the secret chamber. When the numbers of yin and yang are complete, a fetus forms naturally. Even the lofty and enlightened Perfected Ones initially found this hard to believe; only upon witnessing the embryo’s entry into the mouth and the dragon spirit’s startled awe did they recognize its marvel. As the scripture says:
*"A tree of a hundred spans begins as a tender shoot;
A nine-tiered terrace rises from heaped earth;
A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step."*
This is what it means.

**Distinguish the clarity and turbidity of the water’s source—**
"Distinguish" means to differentiate; the water’s source is the riverbed where the medicine is produced. Clarity is purity and unsulliedness; turbidity is the lack thereof. This matter has been a closely guarded secret from ancient times to the present—it is difficult to speak of with lesser minds.

Between wood and metal lies a barrier—wood is mercury, the dragon, dwelling in the east; metal is lead, stationed in the west. Each occupies its own domain, with no means to meet. The method of returning the elixir, the Way of *Tai*, lies in the descent of celestial *qi* and the ascent of earthly *qi*, thus dissolving all separation and bringing the joy of reunion. Without a master’s guidance, this truth remains elusive. As the Perfected One of Purple Yang said: *"Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min, without a teacher’s transmission, do not presume to guess."* This is what it means.

Yet at the outset of transmission, unless one observes carefully and tests discreetly, it should not be lightly bestowed. To recklessly impart it to lesser minds would invite ridicule and disgrace—hence its guarded secrecy. The essentials of the Dao are profound and subtle; the celestial mechanism is deep and boundless. The Dao’s essence is exquisitely refined and mysterious; the workings of heaven are abstruse and vast—beyond the reach of lesser minds.

**To begin practice swiftly is still too slow.**
Swift yet still too slow—this is because of the nine difficulties:
1. A master finding a worthy disciple is difficult;
2. A disciple encountering a true master is difficult;
3. The celestial mechanism revealing itself is difficult;
4. Accumulating merit and cultivating conduct is difficult;
5. Securing ample provisions is difficult;
6. Selecting and preparing the medicine is difficult;
7. Obtaining a suitable chamber for the elixir is difficult;
8. Navigating adverse years and months is difficult;
9. Practicing without demonic obstructions is difficult.
Because of these nine difficulties, it is said: *To begin practice swiftly is still too slow.*

**The path to Penglai relies on fulfilling three thousand deeds.**
"Deeds" refers to meritorious conduct, the ten virtuous practices:
1. Filial piety;
2. Fraternal duty;
3. Forbearance;
4. Loyalty;
5. Reverence for the sacred—these five are called the *Great Five*, also known as the *Dao*, the Great Way.
6. Wisdom;
7. Propriety;
8. Benevolence;
9. Righteousness;
10. Trustworthiness—these five are called the *Five Constants*, also known as *virtue*, the enduring Way.
The above ten practices, when cultivated within oneself, are called *deeds*; when they nourish the body, they are called *virtue*; when applied to affairs, they are called *conduct*; when their effects endure, they are called *merit*. Though their uses differ, their essence is one. Their manifestation is called *deeds*—hence the term *three thousand deeds*, emphasizing the importance of accumulation.

**Alone, one ascends to the clouds and returns.**
Accumulating merit and cultivating conduct are the natural duties of the Dao-seeker. Only when merit is complete and conduct fulfilled does one’s name enter the immortal register, and Penglai becomes attainable. Without accumulating merit and cultivating conduct, to hope for refining the returning elixir, ascending lightly, journeying afar, and soaring beyond the eight limits—such has never been.

**Recite the True Form Incantation of the Northern Dipper.**
"North" is the direction opposite the south, the position of *Tianyi*, governed by the cold water phase, paired with steadfast wisdom. The Dipper measures and harmonizes primordial *qi*, its truth capable of transformation and embodying all virtues. "Form" is appearance; "true form" is the heart-mind spirit. All appearances are ultimately unreal—only this heart-mind spirit, the master of the hundred bones, pervades heaven as heaven, pervades earth as earth, moving in and out without fixed time, its abode unknown. Grasp it, and it exists; release it, and it vanishes. In stillness, it is nature; in movement, it is emotion. Following nature, one becomes a noble person, a sage; indulging emotion, one becomes a petty person, a stranger to one’s kind.

To be a noble person, a sage—this appearance does not grow brighter; to be a petty person, a stranger to one’s kind—this appearance does not wholly vanish. Neither bright nor extinguished, thus it is true.

The incantation’s words, when held in secret, can guard the spirit. *"Heavenly Numinous Joint and Glory"*—the spirit of the Heavenly Valley, the primordial spirit itself. United, they are one, the Heavenly Numinous; arrayed, they become nine, the Nine Palace Perfected. Dispersed, they are the ten thousand things, the myriad forms of existence. *"Joint and Glory"* is the *qi* of the Crimson Palace, the primordial radiance, residing behind the heart’s storehouse, between the seventh vertebrae, circulating glory-blood throughout the body—this is the Joint and Glory.

May long life be preserved. The adept who guards the spirit draws pure wind through the nose, entering by the Heavenly Gate. The Heavenly Gate is the two nostrils, ascending to the Heavenly Valley. The Heavenly Valley is the Muddy Pellet within the Gate, penetrating the Crimson Palace. The Crimson Palace is the mansion of the heart-spirit’s ingress and egress, descending to the Secret Chamber. The Secret Chamber is the space between the two kidneys, the chamber of the Primal Spirit.

Wind descends from the Heavenly Numinous Valley; spirit descends from the Joint and Glory Palace, meeting in the Secret Chamber. Wind-wood engenders heart-fire; kidney-water engenders wind-wood—thus long life may be preserved.

The One of the Great Mystery guards its true form. The spirit of the left kidney is called *Taiyi*; the spirit of the right kidney, *Xuanyi*—for they partake of the celestial One’s number. The true form is the heart-spirit, which emerges from the Crimson Palace, reins the mind-steed, and descends into the Secret Chamber. Reciting the *True Form Incantation of the Northern Dipper* is the supreme method of the mysterious and numinous, the highest practice of the *Xuanji*. With time, the spirits *Taiyi* and *Xuanyi* flank and assist, achieving the union of essence and spirit, directly attaining the untainted. Nature is perfected, and life may be realized—this is the essence of *guarding the One*.

This space between the two kidneys is the *limit*. Thus, Wang Sifu called it the *center*; Yao and Shun held fast to this center; King Wen *halted at his back*; the Duke of Zhou *halted at his limit*; Confucius *withdrew and concealed himself in secrecy*—all followed this Way.

The spirit-lords of the five viscera each preserve peace. If one can guard the spirit, the five viscera will be at peace!

*Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances.*

Here ends the *Attaining Life* chapter, final scroll of *Yuan Qingzi*.
