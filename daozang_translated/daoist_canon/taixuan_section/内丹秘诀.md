### **Rhapsody on Internal Alchemy**
*(Rhymed to "Refining the Dragon and Tiger, Accordant with the Heavenly Dao")*

Vast as the clouded sea, its paths lead to the Broad Cold Palace;
The giant clam nurtures its treasure, the sacred crow smelts the elixir.
Lead enfolds living gold—if one fully grasps the root and source,
Mercury gestates within cinnabar—truly, their union is no difficult task.
Thus can the dust be transformed, the common man ascend lightly,
Rescuing those withered by moxa’s decay.

Now, the medicine must be sought within, the furnace refined in person.
The flying spirit-water drips its essence, pouring into the Flowery Pond in splashing torrents.
Water and fire are drawn and added, yin and yang wielded like fans,
Circling within three hundred and sixty days, traversing Kan and Li;
Amid seventy-two seasonal nodes, driving thunder and racing lightning.
Deep within the Nine Palaces, the tiger coils and the dragon crouches,
Unlocking the gates of the Three Powers, forging the portals of the Eight Trigrams.
Advancing fire to activate the lines, beginning in winter and surging through summer;
Following heaven to perfect things, from summer’s start to winter’s end.
Silently moving the divine mechanism, subtly aligning with the sagely measure,
Conveying the twelvefold cycle, revolving the Three and Five,
Mastering yin and yang, subduing dragon and tiger.
Probing the marvel of seven returns and nine reversions, refining fine gold below;
Gathering the essence of one water and two fires, returning above to the true earth.
Is it not so? Having completed the cycle, it begins anew—from being to non-being,
Transmuting the hard and soft medicines, filling the cauldron of heaven and earth.
Nourished by golden blossoms and jade fragments, cultivated by the Great Yang and Yin Talismans,
It governs creation within the bodily form, twinning the sagely image in dual transmission;
Concentrating radiance within the grotto-realm, a single luminous pearl.
Its wondrous workings operate in concealment, its true source secretly aligned.
Gradually, the red wine suffuses branches and leaves, the yellow vitality revives root and stem.
The dog feeds on dragon’s marrow, the man consumes cicada’s molt—
Transmuting the mortal into the sagely.
Not through some divergent worldly merit, but by halting the visage and preserving the countenance,
Undiminished by the years of later heaven.
Thus the marrow congeals like frost-white snow, the bones transform into unyielding gold.
This floats beyond the net of vanity, pointing the way home through the boundless sky,
Unbound by the hundred-and-six cycles of calamity, untroubled by the fleeting hours;
Escaping beyond yin and yang, letting the passing years change as they will.

**Take heed!**
The enlightened should draw near, the true essence may be preserved.
Ponder how swiftly fleeting life darkens—how can one not seize the moment early?
Behold the rise and fall, honor and disgrace, along the long road to Chang’an’s northern hills.

### **Poem on the Yin Elixir**
Worldly arts are called "famed techniques,"
Daoist teachings are known as "hidden scriptures."
The Three Peaks bequeath secret instructions,
The Five Characters reveal the true pivot.
Guest and host must guard against premature movement,
Yin and yang prize harmonious accord.
With each regulation, let the *chong qi* flow smoothly,
Never indulging the passions’ release.
Beware that kindness may breed harm,
Preserve the end as carefully as the beginning.
When the Three Fields brim with golden liquid,
The mortal frame is exchanged for skin like ice.

### **Rhapsody on the Toad’s Returning Elixir**
*(By Hai Chan Zi)*

Now, the Returning Elixir is most revered, arising from Qian and Kun.
It employs the One Qi to array the Three Powers, commands the Five Phases to divide the Nine Luminaries.
Black and white intermingle, spraying the rain and dew of yin and yang;
Blue and yellow unite, scattering the sun and moon to form the primordial chaos.
When the crimson furnace is established and the true crucible set in place,
Lead borrows the womb of water, mercury rests in the intestines, free of dross.
Above, it does not seek the mountain’s depths; below, it does not seek the mortal dust.
Gathering *mao* and *you* at the Three Peaks, meeting Kan and Li on the two shores.
Once the wondrous existence is understood, the tortoise and snake naturally submit;
Having attained the realm of emptiness, the crow and hare spontaneously keep company.

Moreover, the elixir that reverses aging—let not its opportunity slip away.
Endlessly, it refines the golden visage; clearly, it transforms into jade-like substance.
Moving, living—suddenly it hastens as *geng* and *xin*;
Active, still—swiftly it divides as *jia* and *yi*.
The yellow sprouts flourish, the River Chariot endures.
The River Chariot is lent to the yellow sprouts, nurturing them;
The yellow sprouts’ roots connect to the River Chariot, bearing the person—
Ah! Life’s turning is distant.
The three *hun* wander—whose grotto do they return to?
The seven *po* linger—do they depart from my home?
Through repeated cycles of fortune and misfortune, the Three Ones—mother and child—cannot escape.
Encountering heat and cold, the Two Eights—husband and wife—do not part.

Marvelous indeed!
The distant path can be traversed at dawn—
source of the myriad vibrations,
manifest and hidden pivot of the mechanism.
It unravels and returns to the ancestor of the hundred streams,
while within the sea of glory and splendor,
all things in haste turn to ash.
In the silent vastness of the world,
only it alone does not become dust.

I urge the wise to awaken to the Great Dao—
has Heaven ever been untrue?
See the *yin* and *yang* and conceal them in secrecy;
hear of water and fire and guard them steadfastly.
Do not procrastinate—how lamentable!
Once fallen into ruins,
how can one ever behold them again?

The Azure Dragon descends and coils round the White Tiger;
the Vermilion Bird soars and plunges into the Dark Warrior.
After a thousand mornings, the fire-tending evokes divine merit—
in broad daylight, one ascends to the Purple Court.

*The Song of Utmost Truth*
I tell you gentlemen the truth:
the stem of life has always lain in the true breath.
Illuminating the body, it abides in emptiness yet is not empty;
the numinous realm, like Heaven, embraces the ten thousand things.

The Great One spreads its wonders—let man attain the One.
Having attained the One, guard it well and never lose it.
In an empty and tranquil chamber, the spirit dwells of itself;
in the numinous palace, scorching and smelting dry the blood and fluids.

One sorrow, one joy, one thought, one care—
one indulgence, one toil, and the body gradually decays.
Harming at dawn, damaging at dusk, deluded and unaware,
qi scatters, the spirit has no place to rest.
Slowly, slowly it wears away, gradually declining—
when the primordial harmony is exhausted, the spirit departs.

All speak of walking meditation and sitting meditation as the same,
but while the sage may be thus, the common man is not.
Wasting time without cutting away the thorns,
who has ever heard of fine crops growing in a barren field?

After nine years of gentle nurturing, the fire-tending is complete—
the mysterious response is effortless, and the spirit hastens.
The effortless mind is the true mind;
in motion and stillness both forgotten, one departs from desire.

Spirit is nature, qi is life.
When the spirit does not stray outward, qi gradually settles.
Originally two things—yet which is closer?
If lost, what remains to grasp as the root?

With what does one first establish the foundation?
Abide in non-action where non-action is—
scenes in the mind must be swept away,
spirit in dreams must be firmly held.
Neither drifting nor congealing is the great essential;
neither square nor round is the supreme subtlety.
When the numinous source operates within, it becomes real;
when breath scatters outward, it remains unfinished.

Piercing metal and penetrating stone are not difficult—
sitting in oblivion, standing in forgetfulness, swift as a flash.
This Dao is easy to know but hard to practice;
when practice forgets itself, the Dao is complete.

If one takes breath-holding as the true matter,
counting breaths or following diagrams—both are mistaken.
Lately, one lays aside worldly toil,
yet inwardly, the heart remains entangled—how is this different?

Just observe an infant in the womb—
does it secretly scheme and calculate?
It savors only the sweet dew,
hunger and thirst dissolve, revealing true simplicity.

In later years, when merit is complete, one roams freely—
but at first, refining and washing require diligence and toil.
Yet within diligence and toil, there is no diligence—
idly, idly, one need only nurture the primordial spirit.

Alas! The heart will not allow idleness—
in the end, whether one wanders or abides depends on the person.
I now practice the bitterest of bitter austerities—
clothed in grass, eating bark, solitary and still.

If one applies effort in idleness,
how can it compare to the vast cultivation of great samādhi?
If form and spirit cannot both be preserved,
one may complete life but cannot first complete nature.

Concentrate qi to attain softness, and the spirit lingers long;
the true breath comes and goes, naturally at rest.
Continuous and unbroken, it returns to the primordial root—
without drawing from the numinous spring, it flows forever.

Thirty-six thousand days make the great work;
within them lie the rhythms of yin and yang.
Steaming and fusing the meridians, transforming sinew and bone,
everywhere radiant and unobstructed.

The Three Corpses flee the yin abode of the corpse;
the myriad lands come to pay homage at the palace of the Red Emperor.
I ask: whence comes the true person?
From the beginning, he has dwelt only in the cinnabar terrace.

In former years, clouds and mist deeply obscured him;
today, we meet, and the eye of Dao opens.
This is not a matter of a morning or an evening—
it is my original truth, not a mere defense.

Firm as metal and stone in the cold of winter,
repelling yin demons through the power of wisdom—
all arises from tranquility and single-minded devotion,
which is the Pure Land of Huaxu in this very age.

Do not chase fame or pursue profit;
cut off human attachments and be free of affairs.
What use is a sky-reaching reputation?
What value is there in riding horses or composing essays?
Skill in zither, poetry, or lyrics—
mastery of many arts only obstructs the path of cultivation.

Like thin mist or light smoke,
idly accompanying fallen blossoms and willow fluff,
floating and secluded between Heaven and Earth—
when the time comes, they cannot become rain or dew.

If primordial qi does not abide, the spirit is not at peace;
a worm-eaten tree with no roots withers its branches and leaves.
No need to speak of tears, saliva, or essence-blood—
grasping the root and exhausting the source, all are the same.

This thing has never had a fixed position—
its transformations at the moment depend on the heart’s intent.
In the body, when heat is felt, it becomes sweat;
in the nose, when wind is felt, it becomes mucus;
in the kidneys, when union is felt, it becomes essence;
in the eyes, when sorrow is felt, it becomes tears.
Flowing and circulating, it moistens the entire body—
in the end, it does not depart from the spirit-water.

Its wonder is hard to describe—few recognize it.
It nourishes all things with the green essence-qi.
Half a lifetime spent in procrastination—
only now does cultivation rely on spirit and qi.

Which is closer—name or self?
When spirit and qi are not at peace, one labors in vain.
Pity the fine foundation—
a golden hall and jade chamber without a master.

I urge you, master, to abide long—
in utmost stillness and tranquility, there is no use.
The wondrous existence within emptiness is hard to grasp—
nurturing the infant requires the mother.

Enveloping keen discernment, yet remaining silent;
gathering in the spirit, learning to be dull.
With a steadfast heart and single purpose, press forward—
whether achieved or not, strive to attain it.

*Song of Ox-Cheek Master to Horse Recluse*
Horse Recluse, Horse Recluse,
years ago, by the Basin’s shore,
we met in the season of late spring.
Hand in hand, we walked the red dust,
searching every grotto of Mount Lu.

A hundred flowers vied in splendor amid fragrant groves and springs;
ten thousand peaks, like ink-splashed brows.
Only the twittering of birds was heard—
no clamor of markets or towns.

Two gourds of wine beneath the eaves,
resting by a stream.
Carved gold cups of tender essence,
purple jade plates of fresh fern.
Striking flint to boil,
plucking pine blossoms to garnish.

Drinking seven or eight cups in a row,
unaware of flushed ears.
Suddenly, wisdom-nature pierced the mystery—
on the rocks, we sang wildly, shouting with joy.

Ten paces, five paces—strike a fit of madness,
stumble and fall asleep at once.
Awake, how long has passed?
The woodcutter says, "Months already."

Crouching again on the patterned stone,
lungs and bowels drenched, spirit refreshed and joyful.
The jade dawn and cinnabar Han await their time—
what need to speak of worldly profit or fame?

Having said this, I take leave of you.
After parting, I enter the dark forest,
seek the Pure Void,
ascend the Purple Terrace,
wander the lush groves—
within the gourd’s true realm, I roam free.

The world’s fleeting light presses on,
others laugh at my carefree ways.
I conceal my brilliance and delight in obscurity,
clad in green straw cloak and bamboo hat,
holding a great iron ladle in hand,
begging for coins to buy wine and muddle through the Five Turbidities.

Suddenly, I arrive beneath Mahu Mountain,
within Jianchang Prefecture.
Atop a wineshop, I see four men—
each in tattered robes,
each with the extraordinary bones of immortals.
They chant and sing loudly,
seeming drunk yet not drunk.

I ask a young attendant holding a sword,
who tells me: "Master Zhongli, Master Lü, Liu Haichan, and Chen Qizi."
The four call to me: "Come closer!
Your celestial bones are rare and truly divine.
For decades, we’ve searched for worthy ones in vain—
now we shall transmit to you the secret of the Golden Elixir."

They say to me:
"In the dim and distant, there is essence;
in the vague and indistinct, there is substance.
This substance is no ordinary substance,
this essence no ordinary essence.
Heaven gains clarity from it,
Earth gains tranquility,
humans gain spirit,
all things gain life.

Simply embrace the Origin and guard the One,
temper sharpness and resolve strife.
Hold the Seven-Star Sword,
turn the Heavenly Gate and shift the Earth’s axis,
harmonize yin and yang, unite Qian and Kun,
open the gates of Kan and Li,
release the Dragon and Tiger to devour each other,
await the transformations of Wu and Ji—
then the work is complete, and the Elixir is formed.

This is the divine treasure of Heaven,
the rarest jewel among men,
the subtlest of subtleties,
the most revered of the revered.
Guard it in secret,
practice it with diligence."

Horse Recluse, Horse Recluse,
this art is within reach of all,
yet most are blinded by ignorance, their spirits dull,
ensnared by worldly desires,
valuing hearsay over sight.
How many truly understand?

Some vainly preserve spirit in delusion,
or swish saliva and swallow it.
Some exhaust their bodies with daoyin,
or sit in rigid stillness, holding their breath.
Some inhale external winds,
or endure hunger by fasting.
Some externally refine lead and mercury,
or sink into debauchery with yin elixirs.
Some, having eaten their fill, prattle of emptiness—
yet they are the true sinners,
yet they speak of karma,
spouting foreign gibberish.

They claim to divine fortunes,
or expound on Chan’s mysteries,
or transmit the teachings of Patriarch Bodhidharma.
But without refining the body, the spirit cannot abide—
fleeting as dreams, illusory as flowers,
they vanish in an instant.
All claim to have gone to the Western Paradise,
yet in the end, they turn to a pile of ashes.

Horse Recluse, Horse Recluse,
seek substance in the vague and indistinct,
seek essence in the dim and distant.
When form and spirit penetrate the Dao,
only you and I achieve true union.

*Song of the Spirit Spring Well by Valley-Dwelling Master of the Rock*
The Valley Master has a Spirit Spring Well,
connecting to the peaks of Kunlun’s summit.
Its waters, called "fermented brew,"
sustain the lives of grasses and beings.

The well’s flow never ceases through the four seasons,
those who drink it find true delight.
Within, the twin wheels of sun and moon appear,
the Crow and Hare endlessly chase each other.

This well is seen by all,
yet thousands upon thousands fail to draw from it.
Those who draw too near fall in,
drowning without knowing death—
the well’s depths are unfathomable, its waters perilous.

The Valley Master has a wondrous bamboo pole,
found when bones were eternal.
Its nodes are all unobstructed,
drawing water with effortless strength.

No bucket, no jar—
only the pole’s tip dares to dip.
It comes and goes without damage,
drawing water all day without fail.

This bamboo pole is precious,
its water sweet as honey.
Those who drink it when ill are healed,
relieving hunger and thirst with ease.

A thousand scriptures and ten thousand discourses reveal the true secret—
if one grasps the pole and the water, one must guard it closely.
Without a master’s guidance, it is hard to find.
Yet if one holds this bamboo pole and this spring’s water,
it sustains those who cultivate and study.

At times, it reveals itself to people,
yet not one turns their heart toward it.

Speaking of this well is no easy task—
those who draw too near are swallowed whole.
Only the Valley Master grasps its subtle meaning,
skillfully drawing water and knowing its depths.

No haste, no force—
only a subtle art.
When the water is full, withdraw it at once,
pouring it into a golden vase to steep pearls.

No danger, no loss—
just the ordinary passing of days.
Over years and months, it becomes spiritually attuned,
transforming old age into youth.

The Valley Master’s bamboo pole seems common,
yet if others grasp it, it is truly rare.
At the well’s edge, they lose it—
among ten thousand, scarcely one succeeds.

One bamboo pole, one spring well—
worldly wealth is fleeting and hard to grasp,
yet riches destroy men, and none know it.
The well’s water gives life, yet none seek it.

When immortals reveal subtle truths,
all speak of this,
yet if one refines and consumes it day and night,
eating it preserves the form and averts death.

*Poems of the Golden Tiger and White Dragon*
By Zhang Guo

Lead and mercury have been passed down for a hundred thousand autumns,
how many recognize them? How many cultivate?
If the world knew the divine medicine,
immortals would flow like water in Heaven.

The Great Dao is clearly before us,
yet people fail to seek the true Lead.
The Yellow Sprout is the qi of Qian and Kun,
the root of divine water connects to mercury.

The Maiden, newly born, is drunk as mud,
a thousand mornings in the dark chamber, not bound by west or east.
Sincerely tend the fire day and night,
lest the divine elixir’s qi be uneven.

When Heaven and Earth first gave birth, the sun and moon were high,
shaped like an egg, shaped like a peach.
The qi of yin and yang knows the seasons—
only after three years does it shed its womb.

Where does the world seek the Yellow Sprout?
This thing dwells within lead—it is my home.
Lead and mercury together form the true qi of Earth,
only after shedding the womb does one see the divine cinnabar.

The world abounds with Yellow Sprouts, yet none recognize them;
those who know the Yellow Sprout never suffer poverty.
How could the Yellow Sprout be known to the world?
Even if known, none find the gate.

The cinnabar of the two qi lacks spirit,
only when true qi is refined with Yellow Light does it become real.
Within lead lies the mercury of the elixir—
people wander lost, straying from the path.

Harmonized with Heaven and Earth, aligned with the Mysterious,
mother and child unite, yet dare not speak.
First mercury, then lead—this is the true Great Dao,
lest the companionless crane ascends to Heaven.

This thing is passed down through the division of two and eight,
in an auspicious year and month, placed steady in the furnace.
A thousand mornings of fire-tending, knowing the seasons,
lest the sprout forms while mercury remains un-dried.

Mercury resides in the Central Palace, the sprout in the South—
first weigh carefully, lest they clash.
The Yellow Sprout is no hard-to-find medicine,
people’s ignorance alone keeps their lips unsealed.

The market teems with Yellow Sprouts, yet none return,
while the world lightly feasts, chasing fleeting dust.
Nobles and ministers all know the true divine medicine,
yet till death they covet, vying for dawn’s glow.

Sun and moon extend life, yet people rush in vain,
the true Dao is clear, not an endless yang.
Every household holds lead and mercury,
yet deluded, they wander into vast emptiness.

The Five Movements are plain—simply inquire,
mercury within lead holds the deepest principle.
Once you know lead and mercury exist in the world,
firmly pursue the Dao, hesitate no more.

The Great Dao leaves behind a scroll of scripture,
naturally matching to form its proper shape.
Heaven-born lead and mercury—why seek elsewhere?
Why ask distant lands for the name of the medicine?

To use lead, one must blend it with mercury,
two families wed, the maiden sings.
When refined to half the Purple River Chariot,
white clouds accompany the returning crane.

The Jia-Yi divine chart drives the workings of creation,
the hidden dragon knows this as fine lead-essence.
Clearly wrought—what difficulty lies in understanding?
Yet they dismiss it as immortals’ riddling words.

Green Dragon and White Tiger unite as an embryo,
after ten months, the furnace opens in full.
This is the Yellow Sprout’s oral transmission—
where in the world can one find the Three Powers?

Lead and mercury dwell in Qian, not in mountains,
the Three Passes, day and night, are worth climbing.
Though youth may indulge in careless abandon,
gradually one sees the face of a ghost in the mirror.

The Dao must be pursued northward with the heart,
the Yellow Sprout grows within lead.
Cinnabar, the Maiden, is the true divine medicine—
gaining a companion, they journey to the Great Peng.

The Great Dao never fails those who seek it,
lead and mercury are clearly before us, yet cast aside like dust.
Do not say the world lacks divine medicine—
the cinnabar of the two qi is true water and fire.

This thing is Heaven-born, yet people do not know,
the true qi of yin and yang exchanges Kan for Li.
Within the Kan Palace, five generations seek names and forms—
recognize the Yellow Sprout, and it becomes the foundation of sages.

The secret formula of the Inner Elixir—consummate.
