**The Song of the Golden Elixir by Perfected One Gao Xiangxian**

*Scripture Title:* *The Song of the Golden Elixir by Perfected One Gao Xiangxian*
One chapter, composed by Gao Xiangxian, originating from the Northern Song period.
Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Tai Xuan* Section.

Gao Xian, styled Xiangxian, was a native of Quyang. I had never met him before, but in the sixth year of Xiangfu, through the divine monk Yu Chang of Siming, I first encountered him in the capital. I admired his talent and learning, yet he scorned fame and glory in his prime, delighting in wine with carefree abandon. Observing the radiance in his eyes, I sighed, "Truly, he is an enlightened man!" Thus, we formed a bond, though I could not fathom his deeper mysteries.

By the autumn of the seventh year, I read his *Song in Drunken Response to the Lofty and Proud Beyond the Palaces*, nearly two thousand words in length. Though it spoke of ascending to the Celestial Court and inquiring of the Western Flower, it was all veiled in allegory. Its rejection of the false and correction toward the true—this was the Dao of the One Reality.

I, unworthy as I am, have reached sixty-four years of age and pursued the Dao for forty, learning from a hundred masters and a thousand friends, through ten thousand words and myriad techniques. Yet all was taught in obscurity, guided by confusion. Never before had I encountered such clarity and lucidity as in Xiangxian’s song. Fearing that readers might dismiss it as mad or strange, failing to grasp the supreme truth of the Dao, I have provided annotations to enlighten future generations.

**The Song:**

From the Eastern Sea, Gao Xian stirs wonders,
A single mind, vast beyond compare.
Shattering the crucible of Heaven and Earth,
Leaping beyond the sea of yin and yang, life and death.

Mighty! He grasps the mechanism of Heaven and Earth,
Yet the Azure Above forbids his own marvel.
Idle talk of kings and hegemons—how trifling!
His edge concealed, who could know his might?

I recall my youth at fourteen or fifteen,
Eager to serve a wise lord through classical learning.
My bold heart refused mediocrity,
So I wielded my brush in the art of poetry.

Yet my verses, though polished, I came to despise,
Carving seals and crafting trivialities—what worth?
Soon I took up the grand brush of imperial decrees,
Drafting edicts for the Son of Heaven’s reign.

The year before last, I rolled up my sleeves and came to the capital,
Like Manqian, I sent forth my writings to recommend myself.
Drunk, I gazed into the mirror at my traveler’s face,
Startled to see my temples streaked with Pan An’s frost.

I cast aside the mirror, struck my chest, and sighed,
How fleeting is glory—why yearn for it?
I abandoned the imperial examinations,
And sought instead the divine summons of the Jade Capital.

What is the path of divine transcendence?
Ten thousand scrolls, yet no master to reveal the profound.
No different from sailing a ship in the Tailao Sea,
East and west, north and south—boundless and indistinct.

On the fifteenth of the eighth month, the sky clear and bright,
I shut my door to contemplate the Dao, my heart in profound stillness.
Suddenly, the four great elements dissolved into emptiness,
And unawares, my spirit ascended to the Great Clarity.

Gazing around the Great Clarity—how vast and boundless!
Palaces of crystal, carved from ice,
Towering twin gates piercing the clouds,
Jade tablets and golden inscriptions marking the Broad Cold.

Within the Broad Cold Palace lies the Level Way,
Where the inverted landscape has not yet risen, and dawn has not broken.
Crimson phoenixes and purple simurghs perch in emerald groves,
White deer and yellow apes slumber on jade-like grass.

I knocked upon the gate, and before the sound faded,
An attendant opened it to inquire of my purpose.
I announced, "Gao Xian, styled Xiangxian,
Seeking truth, my soul has flown here unawares."

The immortal official received the decree and bade me enter.
After a moment, two youths emerged to greet me.
The Jade Emperor had summoned me,
And clad in rosy clouds, I hastened on my jade-like path.

The two youths led me along golden steps,
Banners of rainbow hues and feathered guards arrayed in splendor.
Twin fans parted to reveal a visage of purity,
As I bowed and awaited the celestial will.

The Jade Emperor spoke to me, a mortal:
"Alas! You have pursued the true with such devotion.
I shall consult the immortal register for your name."
The immortal official replied, "He is already recorded."

"Who in the world knows of the River Chariot?
You must journey west to seek the Western Flower.
The Lady of the Western Flower holds the pivot,
She will point you to the true cinnabar."

He then commanded the two youths to guide me,
As we soared through misty clouds and flying rosy hues.
A million miles—yet how near!
In an instant, I reached the golden edge of Heaven.

The vermilion sun half-risen in the east of Fusang,
Light clouds veiling its radiant banner.
A hundred flowers stretched like a rainbow,
Pillars and railings—all were dragons of rainbow hue.

Jewelled trees, how lush and verdant!
The celestial wind brushed them, their chimes ringing clear.
Amidst the forest of pearls and jade stood a palace,
The two youths pointed: "The Palace of the Western Flower."

Within the palace, the procession shone with brilliance.
A maiden of seventeen or eighteen,
Her tresses like twilight clouds cascading,
Her fair countenance as delicate as spring snow.

The two youths announced the Jade Emperor’s decree,
Delivering Xiangxian, the recluse Gao.
"His name is already inscribed in the immortal register,
The Lady shall instruct him in the principles of longevity."

The Lady received the decree, and the youths departed.
She bowed and seated me, speaking leisurely of immortality:
"Ten thousand scrolls of immortal scriptures circulate in the world,
Yet without encountering a true person, how can one awaken?"

The Lady prepared a feast for me,
Coral and tortoiseshell gleaming in the cold.
Feathered carriages soared through the clouds,
As she summoned the two youths and invited the colored simurghs.

The immortals gathered, auspicious clouds converging,
Heavenly music resounded in all directions.
Golden nectar dripped like dew,
As phoenixes danced in the clouds with graceful steps.

Her fair countenance flushed with rosy hue,
Toasts exchanged in joy unbounded.

The Lady turned to me and sang a short song:
"None among sages and worthies surpass Qiu and Ke.
Yet where are Qiu and Ke now?
Only their tombs remain, towering and desolate.

Heroes of past and present follow the same rut,
Drowning in the waves of fame and profit.
Content to vanish like a spark or a lamp’s flicker,
None grasp the heart to pursue the Great Veil.

In this red dust, how rare are those like you,
Who cast off fleeting glory like discarded sandals.
Having reverently heeded the Jade Emperor’s words,
I shall explain to you the principles of longevity.

Have you not seen the ancient sovereigns seeking the Dao in Kongtong’s chambers?
Though they grasped the grand outlines, they did not fully comprehend.
Turning back, they sought in Shu’s Emei,
The Heavenly Perfected and the True One.

What is the Dao of the True One?
First, you must knock upon the gate of Wu and Ji.
Within the gate of Wu and Ji lies the Golden Child,
And the Golden Child is the root of the Yellow Sprout."

The Yellow Sprout is the mother of all things,
When mother attains the child, it becomes the crucible and cauldron.
When the sun’s essence and moon’s radiance intertwine in resonance,
One floats, one sinks—pearls take flight of their own accord.
The luminous pearl soars to Kunlun’s summit,
If you seek it, rely on the formless image.
Once attained, return to the Crimson Palace,
Where the Crimson Palace steams, suffusing the skin with crimson.
Skin crimson, temples black,
The Northern Dipper henceforth strikes your name from death’s ledger.
Great indeed! Ninety days to achieve success,
On Qiao Mountain’s peaks, traces remain.
Have you not heard?
Shu Tong served under Wei Boyang,
Together they laughed and entered the Realm of Nothingness.
Following Mount Kun’s model, they composed the *Cantong Qi*,
Leaving it as the eternal sovereign of all elixirs.

Its opening declares: Qian and Kun are the gates of the *Yi*,
Qian’s way is male, Kun’s way is female.
Yet the world knows not true yin and yang,
Vainly scouring the earth for dragon and tiger.
The sun is Li, the moon is Kan,
Sun and moon as the *Yi* devour one another.
The golden crow dies, the jade hare is born,
All things arise from heaven and earth’s resonance.
Heaven and earth in misty union conceive,
The four images and five phases rely on their convergence.
Day and night’s cyclical movement follows nature’s law—
Why toil over fire-tending with such diligence?

There is a time for gathering, a day for harvesting,
Gather and harvest—yet be ever cautious, ever discreet.
Lest you rouse the black dragon from slumber,
Losing the Heavenly Perfected and forfeiting the luminous pearl.
Should you fix your heart upon the *Shangqing* scriptures,
Without the Dao, how could you ascend the *Shangqing*?
A path lies before your eyes, yet you know not where—
Striving in vain, you perish in darkness.

Return essence, gaze inward to form a sphere of emptiness,
Below the navel, they forcibly name it the Palace of the Great One.
First envision the divine furnace standing within,
Then store true fire to blaze at its core.
Always rise at midnight’s hour of Zi,
Gather the sun and moon’s essence to cast into the crucible.
Falsely calling saliva "golden essence,"
Swallowing it into the cinnabar field to make "spirit water."
Claiming it aligns with the wondrous tally of the recondite,
After ten months of gestation, a spiritual infant is born.
How lamentable—exhausting spirit and wearying thought,
Often leaving one’s complexion prematurely aged.

Some boil minerals for the ninefold return,
Extracting mercury from cinnabar, lead from elixirs,
Kneading them into a catty to place in an earthen crucible,
Fiercely firing them with common flame.
Though their hues may briefly unify,
And something resembling the Yellow Sprout appears,
It is but a semblance—bewildering and deadly,
Often driving those who consume it to madness.

Now abstaining from salt, now from grain,
Some yang, solitary and unbalanced; some yin, bereft and forsaken.
Some sit in corners, forgetting all but their inner light,
Some flee to explore the depths of mountains and valleys.
Some refine urine for the ninefold return,
Some calcine mulberry ash for the great elixir.
Some yin gathers to restore yang,
Drawing essence and qi to surge through the mud-pill palace.
Why so many paths, a thousand branches and ten thousand roads,
Burying the true teaching where none may find it?

The herb-gathering immortal claps hands and laughs as he departs,
The four great elements of the human realm suddenly understood.
Awakened, silently one knows in the heart,
Vast and untrammeled, devoid of all contrivance.
Truly! Seated upon the coiled stone,
One first marvels, then wonders.
I have heard the ancients’ words:
"Exploring mountains is not the place to cultivate truth."

Xu Cuo spent years seeking the crescent moon furnace,
Traversing grand capitals and bustling prefectures.
For two years, he moved between the capital and the provinces,
Seeking a kindred spirit—yet found none.
He met the talented and the brilliant,
Never once lapsing in discourse on true quiescence.

A traveler on the thoroughfare, his mood suddenly stirred,
Eyes flashing like startled magpies.
Amid the bustling crowd, he asked a humble question,
From the flock, a lone crane stood tall.
Stealthily following, stealthily observing,
Though his spirit and bones were extraordinary, his countenance was wan.
This must be a man of great talent in a lowly position.
I bowed, invited him to sit, and courteously inquired his name and lineage.
He replied: "I am a descendant of the Wangs of Jiangling,
My ancestors were lords of Jingnan.
Then the true sovereign of Jianlong arose,
And we quietly surrendered our seal, becoming vassals.

In my youth, my heart and gall were bold,
In the literary arena, I once triumphed over the imperial examiners.
Who could have foreseen a single misstep would dash my hopes?
I was recommended to the Alarming Palace of Wuling.
My path henceforth sank into the ranks of petty officials,
A ninth-rank robe in the desolate hinterlands.
Bending at the waist, I hastened to pay homage to the governor,
A single bow at the steps—better death than this humiliation.
Early on, I knew my drifting was in vain,
Yet how could I bear the false accusations that followed?
Thanks to Han Shao’s intercession, like Huo Guang of old,
I preserved my head and returned to Nanyang.

Soon after, the Celestial King bestowed his grace,
Summoning me to serve as a minor magistrate in Luoyang.
I sighed at my ill fate, no nobleman’s destiny,
And retired to the southern seas to nurture my Heavenly Perfected nature.
I possess several hundred *qing* of fertile fields near the city walls,
Rippling millet and sorghum bowing like clouds.
Beyond the royal taxes, there is surplus,
Enough to indulge my indolent, Ji Kang-like nature.

Last year, I was shocked to hear of Imperial Censor Wang,
Who presented his writings to the Son of Heaven.
I had long since abandoned the heart of a deer in the reeds,
Unconcerned with the imperial silk once more reaching me.
The external dragon and Zhuge Liang—talent in vain,
What use have they in this age of peace?
I brushed my sleeves, wishing to meet an immortal,
To ascend the nine heavens, using clouds as a ladder.

Pacing alone on the long steps, just then at ease,
I was honored by your inquiry into my dusty traces.
We clasped hands and ascended the wine tower,
Where, drunk, we sang loudly to bare our hearts.
A hundred rows of vast goblets from Wuyang,
We drank in rapid succession, never pausing,
Enough to pour upon the Scorched Mountain,
Drying the great rivers and emptying the seas.

Amidst the revelry, you wrote a thousand words for me,
Like the surging Longmen, pouring forth a torrent of eloquence.
Its force could dam Kunlun and block the Bohai,
Its sound shook the heavenly gates and rattled the earth.
Several hundred words—how bold and untrammeled!
Like a dragon breaking its golden chains.
A single thunderclap by the Jing River’s banks,
Hailstones the size of horse heads hurled from the clouds.

Several hundred words—how lofty and wondrous!
A frigid zither’s notes born from jade tree branches.
Who wields Song Yu’s sword that leans against the sky,
Severing twin rainbows in the autumn void?

Several hundred words—how bleak and bitter!
Like gibbons howling at the moon at high noon.
The withered willows of Baling, shrinking from autumn’s wind,
The fading blossoms of Golden Vale, grieving in the evening rain.

Several hundred words—how all-embracing!
The myriad phenomena, named but once, fall silent.
Great is true awakening! The awakened heart,
All sages and worthies—brushed aside like lightning.

Mighty the unhewn brush in your song!
I treasure it, yet dare not present it to our circle."

Just as scholars clamor for the block and mallet,
Fearing the price of paper will soar by morning’s light—

Marvel at the banished immortal’s brush in your hand,
Marvel at the banished immortal’s bones within your frame.
How could our sovereign’s lavish titles ever touch you?
Dragons are not creatures meant for mere ponds.

I hold the celestial formula of the Crimson Dragon,
Yet when asked, I have never spoken a word.
Marvel at your divine talent, borne of heaven’s own,
Unstinting in revealing heaven’s secrets for your sake.

Let no mediocre soul mock your wild abandon—
For you, a single leap into the moon of Great Purity.
The Perfected One’s lofty image concludes *The Song of Primordial Golden Elixir*.
