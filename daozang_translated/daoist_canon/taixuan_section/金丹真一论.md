**Treatise on the True Unity of Golden Elixir**

The origin of the soul-nurturing elixir lies in the essence of the True Unity *qi*.
The Treatise says:
The True Unity is the primordial water of the Great Dao.
Water is *qi*; *qi* is the Dao.
The Dao originally has no name; through *qi*, it manifests as substance.
Substance is the form of all things.
The Dao initially is formless; through the Unity *qi*, it undergoes transformation.
When transformation reaches the stage of form, form is what is named.
Thus it is said: The Dao originally has no name, yet it is forcibly named "Dao."
The Dao is fundamentally One; One is the Mother.
One spreads transformation, giving birth to all things and benefiting the world.
The *Taishang* says: "Spread the name of One throughout the world."
Those who seek the Great Elixir all trace from root to branch.
The root is the source of True Unity, the Mother.
The child is the elixir.
All who cultivate the elixir seek the source of True Unity to transform *qi* into the child.
The marvel of the divine elixir lies here.

Once form and substance are distinguished, the pure and impure sources differ.
The pure is the yellow sprout.
This sprout is light and can float.
The impure is lead.
This lead is heavy and can settle.
The Great Mao Jun said to Qingxia Zi:
"Lead sinks, silver floats—this is called the yellow sprout.
It is also called refining autumn stone, also called yellow sprout."
After refining through nine transformations of the divine elixir, the crucible must separate the pure and impure *qi* before one comprehends the authority of transformation.
The two *qi* are:
One *qi* is fully Yang, abiding in the correct position of the six *gua*.
One *qi* is fully Yin, also abiding in the correct position of the six *gua*,
establishing the principle of Yin-Yang completeness.
*The Ode of the Yin Lord’s Return Elixir* says:
"The supreme Dao returns the elixir; Yin and Yang are complete.
It transmutes base matter into gold, elevating mortals to immortality."
When this sprout is refined through nine crucibles, it becomes the aged sprout,
only then fit for use.
The elixir scripture says:
"The yellow sprout is the completion of transformation.
How much more so the aged Yang sprout, whose divine *qi* is now sufficient,
fit for elixir use."
The number of days for the Northern River Vehicle is set.
The Vehicle refers to the daily count for elixir refining.
It means that when refining fire, one must complete thirty days,
adhering to monthly cycles, never stopping the fire’s operation,
with Yin and Yang each occupying half, mutually nourishing.
When *qi* circulates one full cycle, the elixir transforms once,
and the Northern River Hexagram arises, drawing *qi* from the Yang line,
until ten months pass, when Yin and Yang numbers are complete.
The divine water’s reception is thus determined.
When refining the Great Elixir, first establish the divine water’s Hua Pool
as its receptacle, so that the water aligns with true lead.
The elixir scripture says:
"When *qi* of the same kind converges, they assist each other like gods.
If the lead is not true, the divine water cannot receive it—
a taboo among immortals.
The taboo lies in differing kinds; hence, first establish the divine water,
then consider true lead."
*The Parametric Accord* says:
"If the lead is not true, mercury cannot be contained."
When referring to mercury, it is the divine water’s Hua Pool.
This *qi*, if not paired with true lead, cannot govern mercury.
If mercury is subdued, it has many names, not merely 'mercury.'
It is also called flowing pearl, golden liquid, golden paste, jade nectar,
or purple wandering salve—all are the true lead within the divine water’s Hua Pool.
True lead and true mercury—these two refined *qi*—congeal to form the elixir.
Elixir cultivators first establish the divine water’s Hua Pool as its receptacle.
If those who refine the elixir understand the divine water’s Hua Pool,
they will know the path to immortality is near.
The Great Elixir without divine water cannot achieve its spiritual efficacy.
Divine water without true lead cannot emit and condense vital *qi*.
When the two unite, they form the Return Elixir.
The Treatise says:
Water’s count belongs to One; it contains mixed true *qi*,
aligning with position to become black, merging with true lead.
True lead receives its nature, nurtured by the black *qi* of the North.
This black *qi* is the divine water itself.
This lead contains hidden light, naturally transforming.
True lead embodies the five colors’ symbols.
Daoists, every three hundred sixty moments, open the crucible once,
adding increments to observe its marvels—
sometimes black, sometimes white, or yellow, purple, red, or green,
corresponding to the true positions of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth.
*The Mirror of the Yin Lord’s Flowing Pearl* says:
"A single substance with five colors, eternally the immortals’ fortune."
It also says:
"Lead contains five colors; mercury emits three flowers."
When the two substances merge, they are called the River Vehicle.
The River Vehicle is another name for the elixir.
Sometimes it sinks, sometimes floats—
capable or incapable, dispersed as the hidden dragon,
congealed as autumn stone.
*The Precept of the Golden Tiger Marshal* says:
"Floating and sinking, vague as clouds,
yet within lies essence, worthy of refinement—
seemingly present, seemingly absent,
difficult to distinguish from the unadulterated."
This is the Marshal’s revelation of true lead,
possessing the marvel of floating and sinking transformations.
The Treatise says:
Floating and sinking are the crucible’s condensation of essence.
The condensed essence’s flower rises above,
called the light-floating essence, also named divine talisman white snow,
or stalactite, or horse-tooth railing—
all are manifestations of the yellow sprout’s singular transformation within the crucible.
Noble cultivators of the elixir, if they attain this stage of refined function,
will know that the nine-transformations divine elixir’s complete method lies in their hands,
enabling them to approach the Celestial Capital and be inscribed in the Jade Register.
All above pertains to the transformation of the yellow sprout—
the sacred deeds of the Dao, treasured by immortals.

**The Great Elixir Song by Xiao Ziyun, Minister of the Yellow Gate:**
*"A thousand words conceal only the secret of the yellow sprout;
ten thousand volumes of scripture expound on idle stone."*

The Treatise states:

Before the yellow sprout enters the crucible, one must first determine the auspicious time and day;
refine black lead to purify, then ascend and descend the essence of the *light-floating qi*.
Again, the *light-floating* essence is paired with the Azure Dragon,
both entering the golden cauldron.
Though within the golden cauldron,
it remains yet undivided in purity and turbidity.
Why so?
Because it has not yet received the *zào huà*[造化] vital *qi* of the cosmos—
how could it, relying on mere seasonal ordinances, partition purity and turbidity?
This requires the elixir artisan to master the five phases,
drive the *zào huà*[造化], and carefully observe the water clock,
advancing and retreating with the celestial talismans,
before the yellow sprout can be fully transformed.
If the water and fire ratios are miscalculated,
the water clock is unregulated,
*yīn* and *yáng* are out of measure,
and the *qi* climate fails to align,
then the yellow sprout may not even arise—
this is the fault of the careless elixir artisan,
who neglects the proper timing.

Master Mao Zhenren said to Qingxiyun:
*"If *yīn* and *yáng* cannot harmonize,*
*the sprout will never emerge at all."*
This is the shared prohibition of Daoists,
fearing the leakage of celestial secrets.

Moreover, observe how mortals today refine medicines,
pretending to emulate longevity,
yet ignorant of the true source of the *lingdān*[灵丹],
mistakenly identifying cinnabar as mercury.
The world is filled with those who mistake red cinnabar for mercury,
using lead flowers to forge it,
burning silk as the elixir—
their harm to lives is profound indeed.

Even among ancient noble immortals,
there are no shortage of elixir scriptures,
Daoist classics, hidden texts,
and secret precepts of the sages,
all meticulously revealed to answer human queries,
unveil profound meanings,
and guide future generations.
Before undertaking the Great Elixir,
one must first prepare the *qīngfù*[清釜] tortoise of the cauldron,
the elixir well and the *lìquán*[醴泉]—
these are the essential prerequisites for elixir cultivation.
Now, I must inquire—
what do mortals today use as true lead?
How do they discern the *shénshuǐ huáxī*[神水华池] of the well-tortoise?
And when the elixir is formed,
each well-tortoise has its own purpose.
If, on that day, they prove useless,
how could it be that the sages’ true *zào huà*[造化] lacks foundation,
confusing future generations?

Furthermore, as the secret precepts state:
Once the elixir well is formed,
do not allow impurities to contaminate it.
After the water channels are stabilized,
one must replace them,
purifying stagnant currents,
then permitting celestial *qi* to flow freely,
and letting stars and moon illuminate them.

In general, well water—
if it contains sand-worms invisible to the eye—
but stored in gold or silver vessels,
after a decade the worms dissolve into lead.
**Annotation:** If Daoists cannot prepare [proper vessels],
use only new, sealed oil bottles,
covering the mouth with waxed paper,
preventing dust from entering.
Once the water’s nature is settled
and the *tǔqì*[土气] is contained,
then take it to combine with the elixir.

For constructing the elixir well,
if one finds a spring of greenish-white lead,
it is the water of *yáng* channels—
when refined, the elixir becomes even more potent.
If the soil is greenish mud,
or the spring is yellow with red channels,
or the water has an iron-like stench,
these are signs of mixed water currents,
stagnant *yīn* earth,
and muddled *tǔqì*[土气]—
such water cannot be used for elixir refinement;
another well must be constructed.

But if the spring is clear,
sweet, and *lì*[醴]-like,
treasure it most carefully.
As the secret precepts further explain in the twelfth chapter on elixir wells:

Water is the source of all life,
the first of the five phases,
the singular *yīn* essence of the northern realm.
Hence it is said:
*"Water one, fire two, wood three, metal four, earth five—*
*the five phases’ order,*
*unified in the One,*
*originating from the void,*
*entering existence from non-being."*

The *lǜshuǐ*[绿水] is the body of the void,
hence *"entering non-being."*
When it enters existence,
it is born from this void *qi* through the five phases’ *zào huà*[造化],
suddenly generating the *huándān*[还丹]—
hence *"entering existence."*

From existence, it returns to the void.
Though the elixir exists,
when the cauldron is replaced each month,
it is continuously merged with the Azure Dragon,
nurturing the White Tiger,
and thus returns to non-being—
hence *"returning to the void."*
After many cycles of return and rebirth,
the divine elixir appears.

Within the cauldron, the sacred medicine
undergoes countless transformations—
when complete, the cauldron is filled with a deep crimson glow,
like blood droplets,
with white *sū*[酥] rising within—
only sages and worthies
can fathom its mysterious shifts.

It follows the ebb and flow of the sun and moon,
conforming to the five phases’ inclinations.
For instance, on the fifteenth and sixteenth days,
when the moon is full and round,
the refined elixir’s *qi* is also at its peak—
radiant and luminous.
As the moon wanes,
the elixir also retreats, concealing and condensing itself.
Thus, the cycles of return and rebirth—
all nine transformations follow this pattern.

When elixir texts speak of *"nine returns, seven rebirths,"*
this is what they mean.
Nine marks the beginning of *yáng* essence,
seven the origin of *tài yīn*[太阴].
In refining the Great Elixir,
one must always pair *yīn* and *yáng*,
ascending and descending in rotation,
the nine-six *yáo*[爻] shifting.

The *Yì*[易] says:
*"The primal *yáng* employs the Nine—*
*order is established beneath heaven."*
Again it says:
*"Employing the Nine reveals Heaven’s virtue."*
Thus, the elixir’s transformations
must all conform to celestial timing—
when the phases align, act;
when the method aligns, proceed.
The *Yì*[易] says:
*"Heaven and Earth regulate their phases,*
*and the four seasons are complete.*
*Yīn and yáng regulate their courses,*
*and all things flourish."*
This is why elixir artisans emulate it—
just as the cosmos generates all things,
transforming into countless wonders,
the red and yellow medicines bloom,
and the branches and stems extend within the cauldron—
all are the sages’ imitations of celestial change.

The *Yì*[易] says:
*"Heaven and Earth undergo transformation,*
*sages emulate their patterns.*
*Heaven displays its symbols,*
*sages follow them."*
When refining the elixir,
the *"mastering talismans and phases"* is what is meant.
Thus, the elixir may not fail to form.

The above clarifies the grand principle of *"nine returns, seven rebirths,"*
all being the secrets of the elixir’s maturation.
If the elixir is not refined with proper timing,
it cannot be contained or halted—
none will achieve its treasure.

Moreover, elixir texts categorize the sages’ methods
according to the nature of all things beneath heaven,
exhausting the principles of *yīn-yáng* pairing,
refining talismans and *zào huà*[造化],
and mastering the five phases’ subtleties—
when spring *qi* arises, flowers and plants flourish;
when autumn *qi* gathers, all things bear fruit.
The *Tài Yì Dānshū*[太易丹书] says:
*"Returned and reborn, it reaches full maturity,*
*the essence condenses and no longer disperses."*

If one extracts mercury from cinnabar,
takes the sprout from lead flowers,
or mixes the eight minerals with three yellows,
or combines the five metals arbitrarily,
these are all not of the Great Elixir’s origin.

「Yet it can be used to subdue and transform—
to transmute yellow and white,
to augment worldly treasures,
to aid the poor and assist the Dao,
to rescue and shelter the lonely and the endangered.

If one were to forge this stubborn and sluggish substance into an elixir,
how could it compare to the scriptures of the immortals, which say:
*"Morning, dressed in a single tablet of elixir,*
*by evening, one may grow wings and fly."*

This crude material could never match such lofty attainment.
Moreover, cinnabar and liquid mercury possess tangible natures,
and after undergoing fire refining,
they harbor *yáng* toxicity within their *yīn*—
ingesting them causes thirst, intestinal decay,
and a throat constriction like fire;
not even ten thousand gold pieces could cure it—
when the five *zàng*[藏] are already destroyed,
what is the use of harming one’s precious body?

Master Ma Ming[马明] said:
*"The Great Elixir returns to its original form—*
*when water is encountered, it takes on water’s essence,*
*when fire is entered, it reverts to golden liquid.*
*Ingestion is like wind and rain,*
*dissolving and permeating into the hundred vessels."*

The Great Elixir transforms from its primordial fluid,
hence the term *golden liquid*[金液].
It can dissolve into the hundred vessels—
when taken, it irrigates and nourishes them,
dispersing ailments like wind and rain,
and expelling malevolent *qi*[氣].

The *Yīn Jūn*[阴君] states:
*"The Great Elixir is born from formlessness—*
*common mercury and cinnabar need no manipulation."*

The commentary explains:
*"Formlessness refers to the *qi* of emptiness and non-being.*
*This *qi* moves with breath, rises and falls in stillness and activity,*
*and is not separate from its source.*
*The source is water—*
*water unites with true lead,*
*forming the *Huá Chí*[华池] (Refined Pool),
*which is the elixir field (*Dān Tiān*[丹田]).*
*The elixir texts say:*
*'Use lead, not lead—*
*lead is the old elixir field.'*
*Once the elixir is produced,*
*it is called 'born essence' (生质),*
*hence 'formlessness gives rise to essence is the Great Elixir.'*

*The commentary further states:*
*'Though water has form,*
*it ultimately lacks essence (质).*
*The divine and immortal use methods to govern it,*
*and thus it can give rise to essence.*
*The origin of born essence*
*lies in the ascent and descent of green—*
*ascent is when *yáng* *qi* surges upward in the crucible,*
*descent is when *yīn* *qi* condenses downward in the retort.'*

*The commentary continues:*
*'The elixir dwells in formlessness—*
*this is like the *Dùo yuè*[蠹钥] (borer-key) hidden within the refined *qi*[华气].*
*River Master[河上公] said:*
*'Seek the borer-key in the void,*
*for only then can one have vital breath and *qi*.'*
*A purely *qiān*[乾] *qi* follows the complete *Way of Yang*[阳道].*
*A purely *kūn*[坤] *qi* follows the complete *Way of Yin*[阴道].*
*Both are the union of *yīn-yáng*[阴阳],*
*where the two *qi* form the true—*
*the true is the elixir.*
*The elixir is the condensed form,*
*manifesting as red fluid.*
*When the elixir is complete,*
*it is no longer the shape of powdered sandalwood—*
*all are symbols of red fluid.*

*The secret instructions say:*
*'First, rely on the clepsydra[刻漏] for precise timing,*
*neither day nor night should differ.*
*During the phase of retreating water and advancing fire,*
*all occurs before noon.*
*Burn incense without interruption,*
*face upward and sincerely invoke the Highest Truth,*
*ensuring the *qiān* fire is at its peak—*
*lest the crucible falter.*
*When the dragon is at its zenith,*
*retreat is inevitable—*
*this is the critical moment.*
*To govern the harshness of excessive *yang*[刚],*
*the virtue of the Nine Heavens is unrivaled,*
*thus it is called 'the *qiān* fire at its peak.'*
*Do not hastily abandon the alchemical chamber.*
*Listen solely to the resounding voice of the dragon at its height,*
*carefully observing the *yīn-yáng*[阴阳] harmony’s signs.*
*If you hear a fierce, masculine tone,*
*that is the *yang* of the overbearing dragon,*
*a purely *yáng* force.*
*As the green *yang*[绿阳] wanes,*
*do not fail to advance the fire,*
*responding to its proper measure.*
*When the fire is fully obtained,*
*there is no fear of sudden loss or excess,*
*yet one must still guard against the crucible’s fragility.*
*At such a masculine sound,*
*be ever vigilant,*
*adjusting fire and water in due time.*

*Temporarily open the midday gate.*
*The midday gate is the portal for the next phase of advancing fire,*
*the beginning of receiving *yin*[阴].*
*Open it briefly,*
*allowing the fire *qi* to stretch and relax,*
*waiting for the sound to become gentle and harmonious—*
*like the faint, distant strains of strings or bamboo pipes.*
*Then close it again—*
*this is the moment of *qi* harmony.*
*Gradually introduce fire *qi*,*
*its voice clear and refined,*
*slowly close once more—*
*lest the *qi* stagnate,*
*and the prolonged delay*
*alter the elixir’s transformation.*
*From this point onward,*
*all is the *Way of Qiān*[乾道]’s transformation.*
*Alchemists who skillfully guard and nurture*
*will alone preserve their true and auspicious nature.*

*The secret instructions continue:*
*'Next, encounter the phase of advancing water and retreating fire.*
*This occurs in the *Lǚ*[履] hexagram,*
*governing one *yin* while restraining five *yang*[阳].*
*When *Qiān*[乾] is harmonized,*
*all things flourish,*
*following the natural order,*
*and thus attain completion with blessings.*
*Stepping on frost yields solid ice—*
*the beginning of *yin* condensation.*
*In intense summer, thunder shakes the heavens,*
*yet it subsides with the power of *lúo*[萝] (a medicinal herb).*
*The sprout’s form gradually takes shape,*
*proceeding without error.*
*The clepsydra marks the second watch,*
*when stability returns and auspiciousness is restored.*

*The *Tài Yì*[太易] says:*
*'In the *Lǚ* hexagram, the elixir condenses its auspicious signs,*
*snow and frost are its essence.*
*The embryo is sluggish, yet rich with potential—*
*when *yin* submits to *yang*’s dominion,*
*this is the pivotal mechanism of the *Way*.*
*The borer-key hides like a tiger,*
*stepping on frost radiates brilliance,*
*solid ice grows cold and severe.*
*At this moment, the elixir gradually condenses,*
*the spirit water has transformed,*
*and the Great *Way*’s alchemical work is complete.*
*Once the yellow sprout is formed,*
*refined through nine cycles,*
*its luminous essence is evident,*
*and it is called the *old sprout*[老芽],*
*now fully mature.*

*The yellow sprout must be clarified and perfected before it can be used,*
*then refined into the elixir.*
*The True Person of *Tài Yī*[太一]’s *Yù Hú Sòng*[玉壶颂] states:*
*'In the tenth month, frost flies and snow thickens,*
*the yellow sprout ripens within, its color vivid and bright.*
*If one cultivates the elixir and sees the yellow sprout mature,*
*how could one not ponder the golden tiger and celestial dragon?'*

*Thus it is known:*
*The yellow sprout reaches perfection only after nine cycles,*
*sometimes resembling stalactites or coral,*
*layered stones in towering grandeur,*
*or myriad threads like horsehair and deer sinew,*
*or jade pillars exquisitely formed.*
*All these wondrous signs*
*await the completion of the nine cycles,*
*then gather this luminous sprout,*
*ascend to the altar,*
*and present it to Heaven,*
*sincerely invoking with profound aspiration.*
*Refine the luminous sprout once more,*
*praying for the Great Medicine’s completion,*
*offering morning and evening reverence,*
*opening and closing the furnace altar,*
*and from this point onward,*
*dedicate oneself to cultivating the Great Elixir.*

*The *Cān Tóng Qì*[参同契] states:*
*'The yellow sprout is*
*the root of the Great Medicine,*
*the supreme treasure of longevity.’*
*Yet the lone *yang* sprout*
*cannot stand alone.*
*Water unites *yin* and *yang*[阴阳],*
*only then does it become the Great Medicine.*

*The commentary explains:*
*'Thus it is known that water*
*is the origin of the Great Medicine,*
*internalizing to solidify the elixir,*
*externalizing to transform all things,*
*uniting *yin* and *yang*—*
*the mother of divine and immortal cultivation.’*

*The *Tài Shàng*[太上] says:*
*'Heaven obtains One to achieve clarity,*
*Earth obtains One to achieve tranquility,*
*and all things obtain One to generate the yellow sprout.*
*Obtaining water alters its nature and form,*
*transforming it into the Great Elixir,*
*properly named the Great Medicine."*」

「Thus, *The Paramitas of the Mysterious Concord*[《参同契》] states:
*The lone *yang* sprout*
*cannot stand alone.*
*Water unites *yin* and *yang*—*
*only then does it become the Great Medicine.*

*This reveals the hidden workings of Heaven,*
*which cannot be heard through ordinary means,*
*a profound admonition.*

*The commentary explains:*
*Water itself is not divine,*
*but when it aligns with the cosmic cycles,*
*it becomes true.*
*Hence, it is called *Divine Water*[神水].
*This water is none other than*
*the five phases[五行] harmonizing,*
*the four seasons[四象] cycling,*
*the eternal return of the Daoist furnace[陶家之输返],*
*revolving through countless extremes,*
*when its transformations are complete,*
*all things have their appointed form.*

*Moreover, the True Person[真人]*
*creates and refines at the outset with purpose,*
*and at the end with resolution.*
*Before signs manifest,*
*all things reveal themselves—*
*what difficulty could there be?*

*Like the sun and moon returning in their cycles,*
*day and night perpetually alternating.*
*Thus the world is formed,*
*and its transformations extend infinitely to all beings.*
*This is the beginning of understanding*
*the measures of *yin* and *yang*,*
*their revolving cycles,*
*endless yet unexhausted.*

*If one speaks of refining the Great Elixir[大丹],*
*it must be done in resonance with the seasons,*
*for its methods differ from worldly practices,*
*and no two ages share the same laws.*
*Divine Water is not inherently divine,*
*but its marvels arise from the cosmic numbers.*

*Furthermore, *The Book of Yin Symbols*[《阴符》] states:*
*The arts of the Great Elixir number a hundred,*
*but their essence lies in*
*Divine Water and the Azure Pool[华池].*
*Thus it is known that*
*the Great Elixir, once obtained,*
*transforms endlessly,*
*constantly ascending,*
*eternally harmonizing with Heaven and Earth.*

*The commentary explains:*
*Water’s nature is*
*fully *yang* in form,*
*yet capable of *yin*.*
*Place a hundred *hu*[斛] in a cauldron,*
*boil and dry it,*
*and its formlessness is revealed.*
*Yet it nourishes the vast Earth,*
*and all things grow from it.*
*Why then does it have form?*

*This form*
*steals the vital *qi* of Heaven and Earth,*
*and arises from it.*
*The classic states:*
*"All things in Heaven and Earth*
*that steal the One*
*are born by embracing *yin* and bearing *yang*."*
*Thus, both Heaven’s transformations and all things’ appointed forms*
*are fully explained,*
*and the Great Elixir is perfected.*

*The commentary explains:*
*When the Great Elixir’s transformations are complete,*
*where does the Divine Water return?*
*The commentary explains:*
*Divine Water is the Mother,*
*True Lead[真铅] unites with it to form the embryo.*
*Within the Golden Furnace[金鼎],*
*it steals the numbers of the five phases,*
*aligning with the daily celestial rotations,*
*the stars and constellations in their proper order,*
*the talismans and seals urging its progress,*
*its water becomes divine,*
*its *qi* descends as true,*
*Black Lead emits its essence,*
*Golden Flowers surge forth—*
*yet none of it leaks,*
*all coalescing into the Elixir.*
*This is the perfected work of the Sage,*
*the Great Elixir taking form as substance.*

*This substance is not the same as Earth’s soil,*
*yet shares its *qi*—*
*the Sage still relies on the *Yijing*[易]*
*to clarify the symbols.*

*Wang Bi’s commentary states:*
*"Abiding in the center to attain correctness,*
*reaching the limit of Earth’s soil,*
*letting nature take its course,*
*and things spontaneously arise,*
*without artificial cultivation,*
*yet the work is accomplished—*
*thus, one does not practice it,*
*and yet nothing is left unfulfilled."*

*The commentary explains:*
*Why does it not require practice yet bring benefit?*
*Is this not a paradox?*
*But by reversing the *yang* cycles*
*and restoring the *yin* position,*
*it requires no practice.*
*Revolving through the paths,*
*returning to its origin,*
*it first reveals itself in its essence—*
*what need is there to worry about its end?*
*Thus, it requires no practice.*

*This teaching further explains*
*Heaven’s eternal principles,*
*the sun and moon’s revolving cycles,*
*and the interplay of *yang* and *yin*—*
*their waxing and waning according to time,*
*the origins of symbols and numbers,*
*stolen and applied,*
*transmitted among the worthy,*
*rarely encountered by the world.*

*Hence the classic states:*
*"The myriad forms cannot evade their numbers,*
*how much less so humans,*
*how much less so ghosts and spirits?"*
*Those who cannot align with*
*these cosmic laws and cycles*
*are merely the vulgar tastes of mortals.*
*The Dao of the Sage and the Wise is not so.*

*《The Book of Yin Symbols》 states:*
*"Heaven’s nature is human,*
*humanity’s essence is the hidden mechanism."*
*Establishing Heaven’s Dao*
*to settle humanity’s mind.*
*Thus, one alters Heaven’s heart,*
*locks the transformations of the cosmos,*
*reverses the five phases,*
*cycles the eight trigrams,*
*fixes the celestial nodes,*
*and divides day and night.*
*This is Heaven’s hidden mechanism,*
*humanity’s theft of it.*
*Obtaining it, the universe is within one’s grasp,*
*and all things are within one’s body,*
*for the mechanism of Heaven is now manifest in humanity.*

*Once the profound symbols are clear,*
*the Great Elixir is complete.*

*The commentary explains:*
*The Primordial *Yang* Child[元阳子] states,*
*"*Yang* Heaven is the Father,*
*Earth *yin* is the Mother,*
*The Vermilion Bird[朱雀] of the South,*
*The Dark Warrior[玄武] of the North.*
*At the year’s end and the season’s close,*
*both become soil.*
*Where does the common man seek*
*Dragon and Tiger?"*

*Soil is the symbol of form,*
*its virtue residing in the Yellow Position[黄位].*
*The Yellow Position signifies*
*the completion of the ninety-nine cycles,*
*transformations fully realized,*
*earning the name of soil,*
*the initial stage of the Elixir.*

*It is said that soil can overcome water,*
*a great principle for*
*consuming and refining the cauldron’s water,*
*the Sage’s intent made clear—*
*water returns to soil.*
*Thus, it is not the soil of Earth,*
*but the initial form of the Elixir,*
*earning the name of the White Tiger,*
*capable of swallowing the Green Dragon.*

*The Elixir scriptures state:*
*"Dragon and Tiger*
*alternately swallow and are swallowed,*
*establishing the fixed position within.*
*Through the eight celestial nodes,*
*the cold and warm shift,*
*gradually transforming into the root of the yellow sprout."*

*Thus it is known that*
*the yellow sprout belongs to soil,*
*which can consume water.*

*The commentary explains:*
*Water has no stagnant form,*
*it contains *qi* and blends with the true.*
*Once the essence is refined,*
*the Golden Elixir congeals.*

*The Elixir scriptures state:*
*"The Golden Elixir is the Great Elixir—*
*this is it.*
*The world’s people fail to comprehend,*
*losing their homes and livelihoods,*
*unable to measure its depths."*

*The commentary explains:*
*The so-called Great Elixir*
*is not a mineral of gold or stone,*
*but borrows its name from the Western direction,*
*its origin being the pure white.*
*《The Paramitas of the Mysterious Concord》 states:*
*"Cinnabar[丹砂] is originally pure,*
*not inherently red,*
*yet its seasons sort it in the Southern Dwelling."*

*The Southern Dwelling is the Green,*
*the pulse that receives *yin* and the female,*
*the descent of the *yin* principle.*
*When the pulses gather,*
*it turns red,*
*the *yin* *qi* glowing crimson,*
*its blood flowing with certainty.*

*Xu Jun states:*
*"Male *qi* is white and emits essence,*
*female *qi* is red and emits blood."*
*The *yang* Dao is male,*
*the *yin* Dao is female.*
*Gathering *qi* forms the embryo,*
*receiving *yin* establishes the master.*
*Only when the Elixir receives *yin*
*does its color change—*
*it was never red from the start.*
*Hence the classic states:*
*"Cinnabar is originally pure,*
*not inherently red."*

*The Autumn Stone[秋石]*
*is also the White Stone mentioned earlier.*
*Its symbol is in the West,*
*thus it is called Autumn Stone.*

*The commentary explains:*
*In opening the Great Elixir,*
*one takes the symbol of Metal’s vigor,*
*White Dew being the first,*
*its strength peaking at the *You* Earth[酉地].*
*This is when*
*Metal and Water’s *qi* are clear and settled,*
*the Metal Autumn month is full and flourishing,*
*the Golden Flowers abundant and overflowing—*
*the proper time for refining the Elixir.*」

Wei Zhenren said:
*"The timing of gathering is fixed,
the season of taking is precise—
yet the world uses it without knowing.*

*How much more so the ancient immortals refining elixirs,
who merely await the Metal *qi*’s round brilliance,
the toad’s light at its fullest—
all true persons share this,
and even a tenth of it is unmatched.*

*Again it is said:*
*The Elixir obtains Water’s mutual nourishment,
rising from emptiness to fullness,
from non-being to being.*

*In refining the Elixir,
one must grasp the True Unity.*
*The True Unity is Water.*
*Water nurtures the Elixir as a mother;
True refers to *qi*—
*qi* is the transformation of the Dao.*
*Transformation means the movement of *qi*;
only when *qi* is sufficient does it become the Dao.*
*The movement of *qi* is the interplay of the two *qi*’s.*
*How much closer it is—
visible before one’s eyes.*

*Bao Zhenren said:*
*The True Unity method is ever-present,
the sun before one’s gaze.*

*The Most High said:*
*The Great Dao is vast—
how could it be confined to left or right?*
*All things rely on it to live,
living without complaint—
how could it be distant?*

*The classic further states:*
*The mother contains the child’s womb,
the child hides within the mother’s body.
Knowing White while guarding Black,
divine clarity comes naturally.*
*White is the West’s Metal—
Metal is the mother.*
*Black is the North’s Water—
Water is the child.*
*Knowing the West’s Metal,*
*the Elixir first arises from the North’s *Ren* and *Gui* (Water’s stems),*
*for *Ren* and *Gui* are Water.*
*The classic says:*
*‘Metal depends on Water—
only by settling Water
does one preserve the Elixir.’*
*Thus the dual meaning of Black and White is clear.*

*Hence the Elixir scripture states:*
*‘Know White, guard Black—
seek death and you shall not find it.’*

*Qingxia Jun said:*
*Water condenses to receive Fire,
Metal disperses and enters Water.
When Water and Fire *qi* intermingle,
Metal’s form transforms—
unsettled, without fixed direction,
neither high nor low remains constant.*
*Water obtains Fire and ascends,
Metal obtains Water and descends;
mutually dependent in transformation,
congealing within *qi*—
how could it be like cinnabar hiding Fire,
mercury forming frost?*

*The Elixir scripture says:*
*‘Mirror-drawing to catch the gall,
mountain-climbing to net fish—
when shall this be achieved?’*

*Refining the Elixir and the Spirit Water,
only with Water does the tooth form;
the Fire cauldron sears the Golden Medicine—
the Golden Medicine is the Three Flowers.*

*Jin Hu Yuanjun said:*
*Refining the Three Flowers merely removes their primordial hue,
restoring them to the West’s true color—pure white.*
*The classic says:*
*‘When pure white appears, the Golden Flower may be forged.’*
*This Flower, once placed in the crucible,
must rely on the water clock’s division
before purity and turbidity are separated.*
*Without the water clock,
no divine sprout will grow;
the Three Flowers enter the crucible.*
*The verse says:*
*‘Entry depends on the clock’s measure—
without it, the Elixir fails.’*
*Like the blind rushing without a staff,
the deaf strumming a zither—
the Great Elixir without the clock
is like the blind stumbling without guidance,
unable to proceed.*
*Though one shouts for Water and Fire,
the moment is ill-timed—
silent and unseparated,
how could the *qi*’s ascent and descent be fixed?
Like the deaf playing the zither,
they cannot distinguish at all.*

*The commentary says:*
*The clock is the day’s direct talisman;
when the messenger’s talisman arrives,
calculate the true numbers of yin and yang,
Water and Fire’s advance and retreat,
determine their weight,
align with the hour and stem-branch,
respond to the crucible’s *qi*—
first fix the timing of Heaven and Earth,
then act in accordance.*

*The *Yinfu Classic* says:*
*‘Yin and yang push each other,
and transformation proceeds in harmony.’*

*The commentary says:*
*If the solar hour is near and the clock reports it,
declare ‘The Great Sun’s number is fulfilled,
accumulating merit to complete *Qian*.’*
*If the lunar hour is near and the clock reports it,
declare ‘The Great Yin’s number is fulfilled,
accumulating merit to complete *Kun*.’*
*Thus when *Qian* and *Kun* are both complete,
yin and yang fully harmonized,
you seize Heaven and Earth’s creative power,
plunder the four seasons’ generative duties—
the crucible’s divine medicine,
once perfected, yields crimson nectar,
loved by both Heaven and humanity.*

*The commentary says:*
*Before the clock’s division,
if the time is for refining the tooth,
the tooth will surely form.*
*If the time is for refining the Elixir,
the Elixir will surely form.*
*All follow this method to manifest the Heavenly symbol.*

*The *Ziyang Jinbi Classic* says:*
*The Dao of Returning the Elixir
is the same as the Nine Crucible method;
Spirit Water’s function
is further refined through mutual circulation.*
*First, the Nine Crucibles refine the tooth,
then the Nine Crucibles refine the Elixir—
hence it is said the Dao of Returning the Elixir
is the same as the Nine Crucible method.*

*The *Zhouyi Parameters* say:*
*Before the water clock’s half-mark passes,
scaly fish dart and scatter.*
*Thus, when the clock’s division is clear,
its markings align with the Five Phases.*
*Day and night’s mysterious operations
respond to the talisman’s nodes.*
*The classic says:*
*The nodes are the divisions of the twelve daily hours.*
*Day and night proceed without pause,
the supreme Dao’s divine function
adjusts to the clock’s ebb and flow.*
*Yin and yang transform—
fleeting yet shifting.*
*Water pressed by Fire
cannot endure the moment’s constraint.*

*Hence Yuanjun says:*
*‘Fleeting transformation
lies in that very instant.’*

*The *Parameters* say:*
*‘In deep winter’s scorching heat,
summer’s frost and snow,
the solstices’ horizontal sweep
defies the clock’s measure.’*
*This is the *Parameters*’ sacred intent,
its profound and subtle meaning.*

*The secret says:*
*When refining the Elixir’s ascent and descent,
never abandon the furnace for an instant.
Listen for the *qi*’s murmurs,
adjust the Fire’s temper—
gradually increase the heat;
otherwise, prior efforts may be lost.*
*Loss comes when Fire’s measure fails to align with the time.*
*Spring Wood not yet full,
Summer Fire already active—
Summer’s blazing heat
yet enforcing Winter’s order—
this is the fault of the furnace-tender’s negligence.*
*Why then does the ash darken over years,
Fire nurtured for seasons,
while cinnabar’s grains
still claim not to be subdued?*

*The commentary says:*
*As for the Golden Liquid Elixir,
it is the condensed *qi* of the Golden Flower’s essence.
When a person ingests it,
it flows through the hundred channels,
preserving youth and reversing aging,
moving swiftly as wind,
immune to all calamities—
dragons and spirits revere it,
Earth and spirits protect it.
Those who take it for years
experience extraordinary events.*
*After three years of ingestion,
truly divine and miraculous events occur.*
*Further relying on yin’s concealment,
awaiting its supreme ascent."*

This is the Ninefold Transformation of Golden Liquid,
condensed and refined into Returning Elixir.
How could it be mere cinnabar turned to powder,
mercury as frost?
This regret is profound indeed.

This is called studying without examining antiquity,
obscurely expounding scriptures and commentaries,
cutting according to one’s own whims,
abandoning the Dao and inverting virtue.
Families squander their wealth,
yet achieve nothing—
truly the fools of the world,
who can awaken them?

Yet the sages of old and the saints of later times,
their profound elixir principles flow from a single source,
so there is no second or third.
They fully illuminate the True Unity,
master the marvelous calculations of the Five Phases,
delve into the interplay of yin and yang,
govern the circulation of cold and heat,
passing down knowledge from benevolent and virtuous ones.
They broaden their practices and refine their wisdom,
knowing the roots of lead and mercury,
fixing the great numbers of water and fire—
so clear and evident,
only then can one undertake their work.

The secret formula says:
*Just as the pulse is one within the body,
yet the hundred pores leak in a thousand moments,
time follows the pores’ flow,
and the moments measure time.
If the pores cannot be controlled,
the elixir changes with each moment.*

This is a universal formula forbidden by all immortals,
a profound meaning of the *Qiánshān* [1] tradition.
To forget the scriptures and commentaries,
to stray far from the subtle and extreme principles—
this is the essence of the elixir’s divine truth,
none surpass this formula.

*The Great Ease* [2] says:
*A day has twelve times—
six of yang, six of yin—
this is the reckoning of time.*

The revolving cycles return,
concealment and manifestation occur within time.
How could a dull heart measure days,
or a flawed intention span years,
ever lingering in darkness,
wasting time in vain?
This is truly lamentable—
a pity to squander light and time.
Aspiring immortals,
please examine this carefully.

Just as the *qi* is divided by nodes,
the general rule is five days for one phase,
counting sixty times [3].
Birds and beasts, their eggs and births,
change according to the nodes.
The text says:
*After five days, a sparrow entering water becomes a clam.*
*After five days, a wild parrot entering water becomes a jellyfish.*
*After five days, an eagle transforms into a dove.*
*After five days, a field mouse becomes a tortoise.*
Transformation is not free to command—
when the time arrives, change occurs.
The principles of elixir and profound symbols
are the same in their transformations.
*After five days, the Divine Water’s form alters like ice and elixir—*
this is the heavens’ shared work,
the laws of time and transformation aligning with divine change.

The profound intentions of the saints,
the elixir schools’ many debates—
this is one such principle.

Another principle of the saints:
*As today’s direct correspondence,
unlocking the elixir’s transformation,
the Hexagram of Reunion is paramount,
igniting the Fire Branch,
awakening the trigrams to divine resonance,
yet ending at the Geng [4] stem—
pure yang.*

*Nǐ* [5] is the first of the received sounds,
gathering and containing the primordial *qi*,
yet ending at the Hài [6] stem—
pure yin.

Today’s Fire Branch governs the numbers,
harmonizing the Hexagrams of Heaven and Earth,
shifting twelve lines [7],
counting twelve times.
Within these times,
there is yin and yang,
light and dark,
movement and stillness,
advance and retreat—
ascend and descend with each moment,
cycling in full return.
The alchemical cauldron’s sacred medicine
adapts to the hexagram’s changes,
five colors radiant in flowing light—
heaven and humans rejoice together.

This formula is engraved on golden tablets externally,
yet treasured within the heart internally.
When passed to others,
saints and virtuous ones transmit it solemnly,
with fasting, purification, and solemn oaths,
never to be casually revealed.

It is the Primordial Beginning’s mysterious speech,
the ultimate golden principle—
do not betray the teacher’s sincerity.

The Lord of the Tea [8] earnestly wrote:
*The Celestial Gate opens,
the Earthly Portal closes—
the saint’s secrets must not be divulged.*
*To recklessly reveal the true formula,*
*disaster will follow, leading to extinction.*
*Is this not easy to understand?*

It is also said:
*Those who receive it do not disclose it,
those who disclose it lose their virtue.*
*Pass it on with words,*
*yet warn to guard the profound silence.*

The commentary says:
*If one obtains the medicine’s source,*
*success is certain.*
*It must benefit all beings,*
*not just one.*

When this medicine is perfected,
it grants the power to elevate an entire household,
not just one person.
Yet see today’s practitioners refining elixirs—
though they speak of it,
they lack the true substance.
Daily they speak of the Dao,
daily they discuss the elixir,
yet when examining the genuine meaning,
they know not the saints’ intentions.
So obscured, they cannot even achieve their own goals—
who then can benefit all and elevate a household?

The scripture says:
*If one remains ignorant of the medicine’s source,*
*even one’s own life cannot be preserved.*
*If one understands the Divine Water,*
*the whole family returns to the True.*

The Divine Water and sacred stone—
one dragon, one tiger,
two substances knowing their essence—
the foundation of immortality,
this is what is meant.

The commentary says:
*Those who receive it grow wiser each day,
yet only upon obtaining the medicine’s source
can cultivation be truly inspired.
Once a month, the elixir coalesces,
the cauldron is opened for bathing,
observing its hues,
gradually perceiving the depths.
Each cauldron’s transformation confirms its truth,
becoming profound function—
its Dao renews daily,
its importance is evident.*

*Those who are lost grow more confused each day.*
*Lost ones mistake cinnabar and mercury*
*for the great medicine,*
*boiling and refining them endlessly,*
*turning them to dust or ash,*
*never aligning with the principles,*
*with no way to confirm its truth.*
*Having strayed from the profound intent,*
*their confusion only deepens,*
*their heads white as thread—*
*how can they awaken?*
*Their Dao grows ever more distorted,*
*their confusion ever more profound.*

*Follow the Dao and uphold the One,*
*Follow the Dao and remember lead,*
*The marvel lies in upholding the One.*

The skin is pierced for calculation,
spring commands its flourishing.

The scriptures say:
The Dao of *three-five* is ever-present in heaven and earth,
used to measure time and regulate the flow of *qi* through the land,
returning to the *Zhongguan* [central official],
its numbers manifest in five.
*Three-five* and *One* are the utmost essence of heaven and earth,
which may be entrusted to oral precepts,
yet is difficult to record in writing.

The essence of the Great Elixir lies beyond mere numbers,
without which its spirit cannot be known.
Divine *qi* and the Alchemical Pool cannot be united
without the true lead.

If one understands and upholds the *One*,
already knowing the fundamental principles of the Great Dao,
nothing remains unfulfilled.

The Celestial Sovereign has no favorites.
The Highest Heaven nurtures all things universally,
its love for humanity most profound,
its mysterious symbols and heavenly mechanisms
in harmony with humanity—
when the Dao is realized, virtue attained,
the Jade Emperor becomes manifest,
yet only the Dao can be truly cherished,
as revealed to the Supreme Deity.

My life is in my own hands,
not decreed by Heaven to live or die.
It does not grant my birth nor decree my death.
The Three Realms endure eternally,
each preserving its original essence,
yet only humanity often fails to cultivate itself,
unaware of refining the Great Elixir.
The Highest Heaven’s clear discernment,
the radiant patterns of the law,
the Great Dao’s precepts and sacred writings
are everywhere—
yet those without aspiration to learn
betray themselves,
forfeit their lives like mud,
and become mere specters.

Moreover, what is difficult to accumulate through cultivation
is no greater than my own body.
What is easily lost through negligence
is not heard of in the Dao of Immortals.
Yet true lead is not distant—
common folk use it daily without knowing.
The Great Elixir is not far—
yellow sprouts fill the markets yet none perceive it.
Even the *jifu* [lowly scholar] struggle to learn,
while the *shangshi* [exalted sage] cannot easily transmit.
How much more so for ordinary people who say,
"Great fate lies with Heaven!"

If one does not awaken to this,
how can they ever hear the truth?
If one claims fate is by Heaven’s decree,
then why does a child’s ingestion of poison
not inevitably lead to death?
Examining past and present who attained the Dao—
thousands, even millions—
they began as common folk in study,
how could the Jade Emperor descend with edicts,
or the sun ascend to the heavens in broad daylight?
Thus, those who seek life
find their life fulfilled,
those who remain ignorant of death
suffer it as their due.
Ascension and decline, gain and loss,
cannot be spoken of as Heaven’s doing—
for my life is in my own hands.

Without the Elixir, life cannot persist.
The *chénbìng* [dust-illness] afflicts the lowly,
who indulge in meat and alcohol,
greasy and blood-rich, clogging the five *zàng* [viscera] and six *fǔ* [bowels].
Filth and *qi* seethe,
weighting the body like a hundred pounds—
how could it rise lightly?
If not for the Golden Elixir’s marvelous medicine,
there is no way to purify and transform.
With one dose of divine medicine,
aging reverses to youth,
ranking among the True Persons,
name inscribed in the Jade Register,
sharing eternal life with Heaven and Earth—
without the Golden Elixir,
life cannot be preserved.

Cultivation requires enduring time,
refining the Elixir in the sacred chamber of *qi*.
It is not the work of a single morning or evening.
Nine transformations yield *yá* [alchemical tooth],
nine more yield the Elixir,
unlocking the principles of creation,
requiring secluded peaks,
a few like-minded companions,
morning and evening devotion,
the Alchemical Hall and furnace,
well-laid bricks and tiles,
twice-daily reverence,
fasting gruel for sustenance,
focused intent to return to the True,
unified spirit and clarity—
truly not easy,
years of effort alone suffice,
hence it is said,
"Cultivation requires enduring time."

Nourishment grants eternal renewal,
after taking the medicine,
the *Three Corpses* [三尸虫] gradually depart,
refined essence returns to the marrow,
complete restoration—
darkness becomes light,
youthful visage flourishes,
spirit sharpens and transcends,
Dao-*qi* brings auspiciousness,
the Five Sacred Peaks’ numinous truths
gather naturally,
soul and spirit pierce all,
the entire body like jade,
joining the playful ranks of the Immortals—
hence it is said,
"Nourishment grants eternal renewal."

Numbers in harmony bring transformation,
the Sage refines the spirit-medicine,
adjusting the numbers to govern the four seasons:
spring unfolds and all things grow,
summer thrives with blazing fire,
autumn gathers and gold ripens,
winter rests with water congealing.
Alchemists’ craft lies in attuning to these seasonal *qi* flows—
if one masters the four seasons’ breath,
the Golden Elixir naturally evolves,
hence it is said,
"Numbers in harmony bring transformation."

Numbers at their utmost become spirit,
speaking of the numbers’ completion.
Only when *yin-yang* numbers are fulfilled
does the elixir’s formula become divine.
*Yin* at its extreme yields hidden *yang*,
*Yang* at its extreme yields suppressed *yin*,
the two *qi* mutually interact,
the natural way of the Dao.
Again, the "extreme" refers to
the exhaustion of all possible transformations,
thus attaining the Dao of *yin-yang*—
the ultimate in numbers.
This is the subtlety of Immortals,
the law of transformation,
hence it is said,
"Numbers at their utmost become spirit."

Grasping this celestial mechanism,
the world’s accomplished deeds
are nothing more than attaining the Dao.
The Dao’s attainment is simple—
none surpasses the Elixir.
The Elixir’s refinement lies in controlling *qi*,
transforming *qi* into form,
none beyond the mastery of numbers.
Numbers forge the Golden Elixir,
*three-five* and *One* united—
grasping this celestial mechanism,
the affairs of Immortals are complete.
Eternally ranked among the True Persons.

The *jindan zhenyi lun* [True One Golden Elixir Scripture] is now concluded.
