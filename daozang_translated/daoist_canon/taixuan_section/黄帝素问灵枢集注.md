**Preface to the *Huangdi Neijing* *Lingshu* *Collected Commentaries***

In ancient times, the **Yellow Emperor** composed the *Inner Canon* (Neijing) in **eighteen volumes**, the *Lingshu* in **nine volumes**, and the *Suwen* in **nine volumes**—such was its original extent. The world has only revered and practiced the *Suwen*.

The **Yue people** obtained fragments of its teachings and expounded the *Difficult Classic* (Nan Jing), while **Emperor Huang of the Jin Dynasty** (Huangfu Mi) later annotated it as the *Jia-Yi* (甲乙). All subsequent schools of thought trace their origins to these works.

However, some of its questions contain errors or omissions, and thus cannot be regarded as definitive for future generations. For instance, as the **Nanyang Living Man’s Book** (Huó Rén Shū) states: *"Coughing and inversion are called 'hán' (喊)."* Upon careful examination of the *Lingshu Classic*, it says: *"The qi of new grains enters the stomach and contends with the lingering cold qi, hence it is called 'hán' (喊)."* When these are combined, the principle becomes clear.

Again, in the **sixty-fifth chapter of the *Difficult Classic*** (Nan Jing), the **Yue people** merely outlined the *Lingshu*’s original teachings on **acupuncture points**, yet some mistakenly regard them as **meridians and collaterals** (liúzhù). Upon careful examination of the *Lingshu Classic*, it says: *"The term 'nodes' (jié) refers to where the **spirit-qi** (shénqì) circulates and enters and exits—it does not pertain to skin, flesh, sinews, or bones."* It further states: *"Spirit-qi is the **true-qi** (zhēnqì). The circulation of spirit-qi is the **meridian** (shū), while the convergence of **wells, streams, and tributaries** (jǐngróngshū), along with **meridians and collaterals** (jīngluò), are the **original nodes** (běnjié)."* When combined, it is evident that the two interpretations differ as much as **heaven and earth**.

Alas, the *Lingshu* has long been lost, and no one could fully comprehend it. To be a **physician**, one must read medical texts. There have been those who read but cannot practice medicine, yet never has there been one who does not read and can practice medicine. Not reading medical texts, and not inheriting the family profession, is even more lethal than wielding **blades and weapons** (tǐngrèn). Hence, the ancients said: *"For a son not to study medical texts is tantamount to disobedience."*

I, the humble servant, from youth to maturity, devoted myself to this **Dao** (dàode), delving into its principles. Though unworthy, I dared not hesitate to cross-reference various texts and reexamine my family’s old annotated edition of the *Lingshu*—nine volumes, totaling **eighty-one chapters** (pìan). I added **phonetic annotations** (xīngshēng) and appended them to the end, compiling it into **twenty-four volumes**.

May this enable those who love life to grasp its meaning effortlessly upon opening the text, with no confusion or distinction.

Apart from what has already been clarified in the original **Canon** (Jīng), I request the **Prefectural authorities** (fǔzhǐ) to instruct the **Transportation Bureau** (yùnshì) to select officials and carefully determine the contents, then submit the final draft to the **Secretariat Bureau** (Mìshūshèng) and **Imperial Academy** (Guózǐjiàn).

Now, **Sung Zhao** (嵩) of **Jing County** (锦官) has specially sought out eminent physicians, and I humbly request their further scrutiny, lest future generations err in its application.

The benefits are boundless, and the merit is self-evident.

This was written in the **second year of the Shaoxing era** (宋绍兴乙玄), on the **mid-summer solstice** (zhòngxià wàngrì). The **Jing County Scholar** (锦官史) **Sung Zhao** inscribed.

**Collected Commentaries on the *Huangdi Neijing* *Lingshu* — Volume One**

The **Nine Needles and Twelve Origins**—First Chapter of *Lingshū* of the *Huangdi Neijing*

The **Yellow Emperor** asked **Qībó** (岐伯):

"I am the sovereign of the ten thousand people, nurturing the common folk and collecting their taxes. I pity those who cannot provide for themselves and who suffer from illness. I wish to spare them from toxic medicines and the harshness of **biànshí** (砭石, *scraping stone*), and instead use fine needles to regulate their **jingmài** (经脉, *meridian channels*), harmonizing their **xuèqì** (血气, *blood and qi*). I would have them gather at the **yùnhuì** (营会, *convergence of nourishing vessels*)—where the **yíng** (营, *nourishing*) and **lù** (络, *collateral*) vessels meet in reverse or forward flow—so that the method may be passed down to future generations, with clear and precise principles established. I desire that the technique be enduring yet never lost, long-lasting yet never forgotten, and that its **jīngjì** (经纪, *fundamental framework*) be well-defined.

Distinguish its **zhāng** (章, *layers/phases*) and separate its **bié** (表里, *exterior and interior*), marking its beginning and end. Let each needle have its distinct form, and first establish the **Zhēn Jīng** (针经, *Needle Classic*). I wish to understand its full essence.

**Qībó** replied:

"Your servant requests permission to expound its principles in order, establishing its **gāngjì** (纲纪, *overarching framework*). It begins with one and concludes with nine. Let me speak of its **Dao** (道, *Way*).

The **essence of the small needle** (小针之要) is easy to explain but difficult to master. The coarse practitioner adheres only to outward form, while the refined guards the **shén** (神, *spirit/essence*). When the spirit is truly grasped, the **shénkè** (神客, *spiritual guest*) lingers at the gate—before the illness is even seen, how can one know its origin?

The **subtlety of needling** (刺之微) lies in the timing of **sùchí** (速迟, *rapid or slow*). The coarse practitioner clings to the **guān** (关, *gate/barrier*), while the refined guards the **jī** (机, *mechanism). When the mechanism moves, it never strays from its **kōng** (空, *void/emptiness). The void within the mechanism is serene, subtle, and fleeting—its arrival cannot be anticipated, its departure cannot be traced. Those who understand the **Dao** of the mechanism cannot be swayed by mere words; those who do not, may strike it yet fail to elicit response. Knowing its ebb and flow, one must seize the moment—this is the **mìao** (妙, *refined art) possessed only by the skilled.

When the **qì** moves **against the natural flow** (逆), it is called **reverse**; when it moves **with the natural flow** (顺), it is called **forward**. To clearly grasp reverse and forward, one must act without hesitation. To **counter its arrival** (迎而夺之) is to prevent its excess; to **aid its departure** (追而济之) is to ensure its sufficiency. To both welcome and follow it, harmonizing with intent, completes the **Dao** of the needle.

In general, when using needles:
- If there is **emptiness** (虚), fill it;
- If there is **fullness** (满), drain it;
- If the **qì** is **stagnant** (宛陈), remove it;
- If **evil** (邪) **qi** prevails, weaken it.
As the *Great Overview* (《大要》) states:
- **Slow insertion followed by rapid needling** (徐而疾) fills;
- **Rapid insertion followed by slow needling** (疾而徐) weakens.

In terms of **emptiness and fullness** (虚实), the needle’s effect is **as if present or absent** (若有若无); in terms of **later and earlier** (后与先), it is **as if preserved or lost** (若存若亡); in terms of **emptiness and fullness** (虚实), it is **as if gained or lost** (若得若失).

The **refinement of the Nine Needles** is most profound. During **bǔ** (补, *tonification*), the needle must be held **internally** (内) before being released **externally** (外). To **sort and expel evil** (排阳), the needle must be inserted; to **drain evil** (邪气得泄), it must be withdrawn. Pressing while drawing the needle is called **internal warming** (内温)—the blood cannot scatter, nor the **qì** escape.

During **bǔ** (补, *tonification*), follow the **qì** with intent. If it wanders, guide it; if it lingers, press it as if it were a **midge or gnat** (蚊虻) resting, or as if it were about to return. When it departs, let it go as if severed. Ensure that **left** (阴) **qì** flows to the **right** (阳), that the **qì** ceases naturally, and that the **external gate** (外门) is closed—then the **qì** will be **filled** (实). There must be no lingering blood; if there is, remove it swiftly.

The **Dao** of holding the needle: the firmest grasp is the most precious. Needle straight and true, without deviation left or right—**spirit** (神) lies in the **qiūmáo** (秋毫, *finest hair*). Attending to the patient’s illness and carefully observing the blood and **meridians** (脉), one must strike without error.

At the moment of needling, one must be in **suspension** (悬阳), aligning with the **two wèi** (卫, *defensive*) points. The **spirit** (神) must not stray; know whether the illness will **survive or perish** (存亡).

The **blood and meridians** (脉) reside **horizontally across the face** (脸横居). When observed, they appear **clear and solitary** (独澄); when palpated, they feel **firm and distinct** (独坚).

The **Nine Needles** have distinct names and forms:
1. **Cái** (才) **Needle** (针), length **one cun and six fēn** (一寸六分);
2. **Yuán** (圆) **Needle** (针), length **one cun and six fēn** (一寸六分);
3. **Tí** (缇) **Needle** (针), length **three cun and five fēn** (三寸半);
4. **Fēng** (锋) **Needle** (针), length **one cun and six fēn** (一寸六分);
5. **Biàn** (铍) **Needle** (针), length **four cun** (四寸), width **two fēn and five lǐ** (二分半);
6. **Yuán Lì** (圆利) **Needle** (针), length **one cun and six fēn** (一寸六分);
7. **Háo** (毫) **Needle** (针), length **three cun and six fēn** (三寸六分);
8. **Cháng** (长) **Needle** (针), length **seven cun** (七寸);
9. **Dà** (大) **Needle** (针), length **four cun** (四寸).

The **Cái Needle** (才针) has a large head and sharp tip, used to **drain evil** (写) and **sort yang** (阳气);
The **Yuán Needle** (圆针) is shaped like an egg, for **rubbing and separating** (揩摩分问), without harming the flesh—used to **drain evil** (写) and **separate** (分) **qì**;
The **Tí Needle** (缇针) has a tip as sharp as **shǔsù** (黍粟, *millet grains*), for pressing the **meridians** (脉) without **shēnqìn** (陷, *penetrating too deeply)—to **convey its qì** (致其气);
The **Fēng Needle** (锋针) has a blade with three sharp edges, used to **release acute illnesses** (发症疾);
The **Biàn Needle** (铍针) has a tip like a **sword’s edge** (剑锋), used to **draw large pus** (取大脓);
The **Yuán Lì Needle** (圆利针) is large like a **hare’s foot** (骛), both round and sharp, with a slightly thicker middle—used to **extract violent qì** (取暴气);
The **Háo Needle** (毫针) has a tip like the **proboscis of a midge or gnat** (蚊虻喙). When needling **slowly** (徐) at the **middle of the string** (弦) or **tip** (尖), the **qì** moves **forward** (往); when lingering **slightly** (微) and **remaining** (久留), it **nourishes** (养)—used to **extract pain and numbness** (取痛痹);
The **Cháng Needle** (长针) is sharp and thin, used to **extract distant numbness** (取远痹);
The **Dà Needle** (大针) resembles a **club** (梃), with a slightly rounded tip—used to **drain the water of the mechanisms** (写机关之水).

Thus, the **Nine Needles** are complete.

Now, the **qì** within the **meridians** (脉) has three layers:
- **Evil qì** (邪气) resides **above** (上);
- **Turbid qì** (浊气) resides **in the middle** (中);
- **Pure qì** (清气) resides **below** (下).

Therefore:
- If the needle **pierces deeply** (陷) into the **meridian** (脉), **evil qì** (邪气) will be expelled;
- If the needle strikes **midway** (中) in the **meridian** (脉), **turbid qì** (浊气) will be expelled;
- If the needle is inserted **too deeply** (太深), **evil qì** (邪气) will **sink back** (反沉), and the illness will worsen.

Thus it is said:
- The **skin, flesh, sinews, and meridians** (皮肉筋脉) each have their proper **depths** (所处);
- Illnesses each have their **appropriate responses** (所宜);
- Each needle has its **distinct form** (不同形);
- Each must be applied according to its **suitability** (所宜), neither **overtonifying** (无实) nor **overdraining** (无虚);
- To **deplete what is insufficient** (损不足) and **tonify what is excessive** (益有余) is called **exacting treatment** (甚病)—and the illness grows more severe.

To **extract from five meridians** (五脉) is death; to **extract from three meridians** (三脉) is **mù** (框, *fainting*).
To **deplete yin** (阴) is death; to **deplete yang** (阳) is **madness** (狂).
Thus, the **harms of needling** (针害) are complete.

When needling and **qì** does not arrive, **do not repeat** (无问其数);
When needling and **qì** arrives, withdraw the needle and **do not reinsert** (乃去之, 勿复针).

Each needle has its **proper application** (所宜), its **distinct form** (不同形), and its **specific function** (所为).

The **key to needling** (刺之要) is that **qì** arrives and there is **effect** (效). The **truth of effect** (效之信) is like **wind dispersing clouds** (若风之吹云), clear as **seeing the azure sky** (明乎若见苍天).
Thus, the **Dao** of needling is complete.

The **Yellow Emperor** said:
"I wish to hear of the **origins** (所出) of the **Five Zàng** (藏) and **Six Fǔ** (府)."

**Qībó** replied:
"The **Five Zàng** (五藏) each have **five jīng** (经) points, totaling **twenty-five** (五五二十五);
The **Six Fǔ** (六府) each have **six jīng** (经) points, totaling **thirty-six** (六六三十六).
The **meridian channels** (经脉) number **twelve** (十二), the **collateral vessels** (络脉) number **fifteen** (十五), making a total of **twenty-seven** (凡二十七) **qì** points, ascending and descending. Their **origins** (所出) are called **jǐng** (井, *well*), their **overflows** (所溜) are called **róng** (荣, *spring*), their **convergences** (所注) are called **jīng** (经, *stream*), their **paths** (所行) are called **jīng** (经, *channel*), and their **entrances** (所入) are called **hé** (合, *union*). The **twenty-seven qì points** (二十七气) all move within the **five jīng** (五经)."

The **junctions** of the **nodes** (節之交) number **three hundred sixty-five** (三百六十五), and those who grasp their essence can conclude with a single word, while those who do not know it will wander endlessly. What is meant by **nodes** (節) is the **spirit-qi** (神氣) as it courses, enters, and exits—not the skin, flesh, sinews, or bones. By observing its **color** (色) and examining its **eyes** (目), one knows its **dispersion and return** (散復). By uniting its **form** (形) and listening to its **movement and stillness** (動靜), one knows its **pathological and orthodox** (邪正) nature. Push with the **right hand** (右主推之), grasp and guide with the **left** (左持而御之), and withdraw when the **qi arrives** (氣至而去之).

Before using the needle, one must first **diagnose the pulse** (必先診脈), observe the **severity or ease of the qi** (視氣之劇易), and only then may treatment proceed.

When the **qi of the Five Zàng** (五藏) has already **failed internally** (已絕於內), yet the practitioner **fills its exterior** (而用針者反實其外), this is called **double exhaustion** (重竭), and **double exhaustion inevitably leads to death** (重竭必死)—its death is **tranquil** (其死也靜). The treatment reverses its **qi**, taking points from the **axilla** (腋) and **chest** (膺).

When the **qi of the Five Zàng** has already **failed externally** (已絕於外), yet the practitioner **fills its interior** (而用針者反實其內), this is called **counter-reversal** (逆厥), and **counter-reversal inevitably leads to death** (逆厥則必死)—its death is **agitated** (其死也躁). The treatment reverses the **four extremities** (四末).

If the needle **pierces deeply but is not withdrawn**, the **essence** (精) will **leak** (泄); if it **pierces deeply and is withdrawn**, it will **induce pathogenic qi** (致氣). **Leakage of essence** (精泄) worsens the illness further (病益甚而惬). **Inducing pathogenic qi** (致氣) will result in **ulceration and abscess** (生為瘍瘍).

The **Five Zàng** have **Six Fǔ** (六府), and the **Six Fǔ** have **twelve origins** (十二原). These **twelve origins** emerge from the **four gates** (四關), which govern the treatment of the **Five Zàng**. When the **Five Zàng** are diseased, one must take the **twelve origins** (當取之十二原). These **twelve origins** are the means by which the **Five Zàng** receive the **three hundred sixty-five nodal qi and flavors** (三百六十五節氣味).

When the **Five Zàng** are diseased, they manifest through the **twelve origins** (應出十二原). Each **origin** has its **specific emergence** (二原各有所出), and by knowing their **origins** and observing their **manifestations**, one can discern the **harm to the Five Zàng**.

Within the **yang**, the **Lesser Yin** (少陰) is the **lung** (肺), its **origin** emerging from **Tàiyuān** (太渊), which has **two** (二). Within the **yang**, the **Greater Yang** (太陽) is the **heart** (心), its **origin** emerging from **Dàlíng** (大陵), which has **two** (二). Within the **yin**, the **Lesser Yang** (少陽) is the **liver** (肝), its **origin** emerging from **Tàichōng** (太沖), which has **two** (二). Within the **yin**, the **Extreme Yin** (至陰) is the **spleen** (脾), its **origin** emerging from **Tàibái** (太白), which has **two** (二). Within the **yin**, the **Greater Yin** (太陰) is the **kidney** (腎), its **origin** emerging from **Tàixī** (太溪), which has **two** (二). The **origin of marrow** (膏之原) emerges from **Jiūwěi** (鴟尾), which has **one** (一). The **origin of nourishment** (育之原) emerges from **Bóyú** (脖胦), which has **one** (一).

These **twelve origins** govern the treatment of diseases in the **Five Zàng and Six Fǔ**. For **distension**, take the **Three Yang** (三陽); for **diarrhea** (飧泄), take the **Three Yin** (三陰).

Now, when the **Five Zàng** are diseased, it is like **a thorn** (刺), like **filth** (污), like **a knot** (結), like **a blockage** (閉). Though the **thorn** may remain long, it can still be **pulled out** (拔); though **filth** may linger, it can still be **cleansed** (雪); though **knots** endure, they can still be **untied** (解); though **blockages** persist, they can still be **broken** (決). Some say that **long-standing illnesses cannot be treated**, but this is incorrect. The skilled needle practitioner treats illness as one **removes a thorn**, **cleanses filth**, **unties knots**, or **breaks blockages**—even if the illness is long-standing, it can still be **resolved** (疾雖久，猶可畢也). Those who say it **cannot be treated** have not mastered the **method** (術).

Needling **heat disorders** is like **handling scalding water**; needling **cold-clear disorders** is like **one who does not wish to walk**. For **yang disorders with yin pathology** (陽中之陰疾), take **Xiàlíng Sān Lǐ** (下陵三里). Proceed **directly** (正往無殆)—when the **qi descends**, it will cease; if it does not descend, begin again (氣下乃止，不下復始).

For **high and internal disorders**, take **Língquán** (陵泉) of the **yin**; for **high and external disorders**, take **Língquán** (陵泉) of the **yang**.

The Yellow Emperor asked Qìbó, saying:

*"The Way of needling must necessarily traverse the terminal and origin points of the twelve primary channels, the branching collaterals, the five transport points where qi lingers, the six fu organs where they converge, the seasonal openings and closings, the five zàng organs where fluids drain, the breadth and count of the vessels, their shallow and deep states, and their high and low reaches. I wish to hear their explanation."*

Qìbó replied:

*"Let me speak of their sequence.

The Lung channel emerges at **Shǎoshāng** (少商), which is the inner side of the tip of the thumb—this is the **Jing (井) point of Wood**. It drains at **Yújì** (鱼际), the **Fū (荣) point**, which is the palm’s hollow beneath the thumb. It flows into **Tàiyuān** (太渊), the **Xing (经) point**, one *cùn* behind the fish-shaped depression in the palm. It courses along **Jīnggū** (经渠), the **Jing (经) point**, within the wrist’s pulse—moving yet never fixed. It enters **Chǐzé** (尺泽), the **Hé (合) point**, the pulsating artery at the elbow’s bend.

This is the **Hand Taiyin (太阴) channel**.

The Heart channel emerges at **Zhōngchōng** (中冲), the tip of the middle finger—this is the **Jing (井) point of Wood**. It drains at **Láoguān** (劳宫), the **Fū (荣) point**, the inner hollow at the base of the middle finger’s joint. It flows into **Dàlíng** (大陵), the **Xing (经) point**, between the two wrist bones. It courses along **Wènshǐ** (问使), the **Jing (经) point**, between the two tendons, three *cùn* up—if overstepped, it reaches its mark; if not, it halts.

This is the **Foot Taiyin (太阴) channel**.

The Kidney channel emerges at **Yǒngquán** (涌泉), the sole of the foot—this is the **Jing (井) point of Wood**. It drains at **Rán Gǔ** (然谷), the **Fū (荣) point**, below the **Rán (然) bone**. It flows into **Tàixī** (太溪), the **Xing (经) point**, behind the inner ankle, above the heel bone, in the depression. It courses along **Fùliú** (复溜), the **Jing (经) point**, two *cùn* above the inner ankle, pulsating without ceasing.

This is the **Foot Shaoyin (少阴) channel**.

The Bladder channel emerges at **Zhìyīn** (至阴), the tip of the little toe—this is the **Jing (井) point of Metal**. It drains at **Tōnggǔ** (通谷), the **Fū (荣) point**, the outer side of the joint’s base. It flows into **Shùgǔ** (束骨), the **Xing (经) point**, the depression behind the joint. It passes **Jīnggǔ** (京骨), the **Yuán (原) point**, below the outer ankle’s great bone. It courses along **Kūnlún** (昆仑), the **Jing (经) point**, behind the lateral malleolus, above the heel bone. It enters **Wěizhōng** (委中), the **Hé (合) point**, the center of the popliteal fossa, accessed by flexing the knee.

This is the **Foot Taiyang (太阳) channel**.

The Gallbladder channel emerges at **Qiàoyīn** (窍阴), the tip of the fourth toe—this is the **Jing (井) point of Metal**. It drains at **Xiáxī** (侠溪), the **Fū (荣) point**, the space between the fourth and fifth toes. It flows into **Línqì** (临泣), the **Xing (经) point**, one and a half *cùn* upward in the depression. It passes **Qiūxū** (丘墟), the **Yuán (原) point**, below the lateral ankle’s hollow. It courses along **Yángfǔ** (阳辅), the **Jing (经) point**, above the lateral malleolus, before the **Chuī (辅) bone** and the end of the **Jué (绝) bone**. It enters **Yáng Língquán** (阳陵泉), the **Hé (合) point**, the depression outside the knee, accessed while extending the leg.

This is the **Foot Shaoyang (少阳) channel**.

The Stomach channel emerges at **Lìduì** (厉兑), the inner side of the second toe’s tip—this is the **Jing (井) point of Metal**. It drains at **Nèitíng** (内庭), the **Fū (荣) point**, the space between the second and third toes. It flows into **Xiàngǔ** (陷谷), the **Xing (经) point**, two *cùn* above the inner side of the second toe’s joint. It passes **Chōngyáng** (冲阳), the **Yuán (原) point**, five *cùn* above the medial malleolus, accessed by shaking the foot.

It enters **Xiàlíng** (下陵), the **Hé (合) point**, three *cùn* below the knee, three *lǐ* from the outer shin bone. Below this, three *cùn* further is **Jùxū Shànglián** (巨虚上廉), and three *cùn* below that is **Jùxū Xiàlián** (巨虚下廉). The Large Intestine belongs to the upper, the Small Intestine to the lower—both are attributed to the Stomach, thus this is the **Foot Yangming (阳明) channel**.

The Triple Burner, which unites with the **Hand Shaoyang**, emerges at **Guānchōng** (关冲), the tip of the ring finger—this is the **Jing (井) point of Metal*.*"

The Triple Burner channel flows through **Yèmén (液门)**, the space between the little finger and the ring finger—this is the **Róng (荣) point**. It descends to **Zhōngzhǔ (中渚)**, the depression behind the joint—this is the **Liǎn (脸) point**. It passes through **Yángchí (阳池)**, the depression above the wrist—this is the **Yuán (原) point**. It courses along **Zhīgōu (支沟)**, three *cùn* above the wrist, between the two bones—this is the **Jīng (经) point**. It enters **Tiānjǐng (天井)**, the depression above the outer bone of the elbow—this is the **Hé (合) point**, accessible only when the elbow is bent. The lower **Liǎn (脸)** of the Triple Burner lies before the big toe, behind the **Shàoyáng (少阳)**, emerging from the outer side of the popliteal fossa, named **Wěiyáng (委阳)**—this is the **Tàiyáng (太阳) Luo (络)** vessel. This is the **Hand Shàoyáng (少阳) channel**.

The Triple Burner, the **Shāng (上)** of **Shǔ (足) Shàoyáng (少阳)** and **Tàiyīn (太阴)**—alternatively **Tàiyáng (太阳)**—branches at five *cùn* above the ankle, penetrating and passing through the **Duōdàncháng (端肠)**, emerging at **Wěiyáng (委阳)**, joining the **Tàiyáng (太阳)** channel proper, entering the network of the **Pángguāng (膀胱)**, encircling the lower **Jiāo (焦)**. When full, it causes urinary retention; when empty, it causes incontinence. For incontinence, supplement; for retention, drain.

The **Hand Tàiyáng (太阳) Small Intestine** channel unites with the **Tàiyáng (太阳)**, emerging at **Shǎozé (少泽)**, the tip of the little finger—this is the **Jīng (井) point of Metal**. It flows through **Qiángǔ (前谷)**, the depression before the joint on the outer side of the hand—this is the **Róng (荣) point**. It descends to **Hòuxī (后溪)**, the depression behind the joint on the outer side of the hand—this is the **Liǎn (脸) point**. It passes **Wàngǔ (腕骨)**, the depression before the wrist bone on the outer side of the hand—this is the **Yuán (原) point**. It courses along **Yánggǔ (阳谷)**, the depression below the sharp bone—this is the **Jīng (经) point**. It enters **Xiǎohǎi (小海)**, the depression half a *cùn* from the inner side of the large bone of the elbow, accessible when the arm is extended—this is the **Hé (合) point**. This is the **Hand Tàiyáng (太阳) channel**.

The **Hand Yángmíng (阳明) Large Intestine** channel unites with the **Hand Yángmíng (阳明)**, emerging at **Shāngyáng (商阳)**, the tip of the second finger—this is the **Jīng (井) point of Metal**. It flows through the two depressions before the joint—this is the **Róng (荣) point**. It descends to the three depressions behind the joint—this is the **Liǎn (脸) point**. It passes **Hégǔ (合谷)**, between the bones of the thumb—this is the **Yuán (原) point**. It courses along **Yángxī (阳溪)**, the depression between the two tendons—this is the **Jīng (经) point**. It enters **Qūchí (曲池)**, the depression outside the elbow bone, accessible when the arm is bent—this is the **Hé (合) point**. This is the **Hand Yángmíng (阳明) channel**.

These are called the **Liǎn (脸) points** of the Five **Zàng (藏)** and Six **Fǔ (府)**—five times five, twenty-five **Liǎn (脸)**; six times six, thirty-six **Liǎn (脸)**. The Six **Fǔ (府)** all emerge from the three **Yáng (阳)** channels of the foot, uniting above with the hands.

At the center of the **Quēpén (缺盆)**, the **Rènmài (任脉)** is named **Tiāntū (天突)**. The first pulse beside the **Rènmài (任脉)** is the **Foot Yángmíng (阳明)**, named **Rényíng (人迎)**. The second pulse is the **Hand Yángmíng (阳明)**, named **Fútū (扶突)**. The third pulse is the **Hand Tàiyáng (太阳)**, named **Tiānchuāng (天窗)**. The fourth pulse is the **Foot Shàoyáng (少阳)**, named **Tiānróng (天容)**. The fifth pulse is the **Hand Shàoyáng (少阳)**, named **Tiānyòu (天牖)**. The sixth pulse is the **Foot Tàiyáng (太阳)**, named **Tiānzhù (天柱)**. The seventh pulse at the center of the neck is the **Dūmài (督脉)**, named **Fēngfǔ (风府)**. The moving pulse in the armpit is the **Hand Tàiyīn (太阴)**, named **Tiānfǔ (天府)**. Three *cùn* below the armpit is the **Hand Xīnzhǔ (心主)**, named **Tiānchí (天池)**.

To puncture **Shàngguān (上关)**, one cannot yawn; to puncture **Xiàguān (下关)**, one cannot yawn. To puncture **Duíní (犊鼻)**, one cannot extend; to puncture both **Guān (关)**, one cannot flex. The **Foot Yángmíng (阳明)** pulse moves beside the throat, its **Liǎn (脸)** point located in the chest. The **Hand Yángmíng (阳明)** pulse lies just outside its **Liǎn (脸)**, not reaching the curve of the cheek by one *cùn*. The **Hand Tàiyáng (太阳)** aligns with the curve of the cheek. The **Foot Shàoyáng (少阳)** lies behind the curve of the cheek beneath the ear. The **Hand Shàoyáng (少阳)** emerges behind the ear, ascending above the **Wán gǔ (完骨)**. The **Foot Tàiyáng (太阳)** runs along the hairline within the great tendon of the neck. The **Yīnchǐ (阴尺)** pulse lies at five *lǐ*, forbidden for twenty-five **Liǎn (脸)** points.

The **Lung** unites with the **Large Intestine**, which is the **Transmission of the Dao (道)府**. The **Heart** unites with the **Small Intestine**, which is the **Receiving and Filling府**. The **Liver** unites with the **Gallbladder**, which is the **Centralizing of Essence府**. The **Spleen** unites with the **Stomach**, which is the **Five Grains府**. The **Kidney** unites with the **Bladder**, which is the **Body Fluids府**. The **Shàoyīn (少阴)** belongs to the **Kidney**, and the **Kidney** connects above to the **Lung**, thus governing the two **Zàng (藏)**. The **Triple Burner** is the **Central Passage府**, from which waterways flow, belonging to the **Bladder**, making it the **Orphan府**. These are the **Fǔ (府)** that unite with the **Zàng (藏)**.

In **Spring**, take the **Luo (络)** and **Róng (荣)** vessels, the major channels, and the spaces between muscles—deeply for severe cases, shallowly for mild ones. In **Summer**, take the **Liǎn (脸)**, **Sūn (孙)**, and **Luo (络)** vessels on the skin and muscles. In **Autumn**, take the **Hé (合)** points, as in **Spring**. In **Winter**, take the **Jīng (井)** and **Liǎn (脸)** points, desiring depth and retention. This is the sequence of the Four Seasons, where **qi** resides and diseases lodge, and where the **Zàng (藏)** are treated. For **spasms**, puncture while standing to resolve them immediately. For **wasting and paralysis**, puncture while lying down to restore function at once.

**[Phonetic Release]** *Kuò shù xià sè jiǎo qiè.*

The foot’s instep sounds like *fū* [□*kuò shù xià sè jiǎo qiè*]. [□*shí yǎn qiè*].

**The Third Method of Small Needling**

What is called *easy* (*yì*) is easy to speak of.
What is called *difficult* (*nán*) is difficult to apply to others.
What is called *crude adherence to form* (*cū shǒu xíng*) is adherence to the method of puncture.
What is called *superior adherence to spirit* (*shàng shǒu shén*) is adherence to the excess or deficiency of a person’s blood and *qi*, knowing whether to supplement or drain.

The *spirit-guest* (*shénkè*) is the convergence of right and wrong *qi*.
The *spirit* (*shén*) is the right *qi*.
The *guest* (*kè*) is the wrong *qi*.
The *one at the gate* (*zài mén*) is when wrong *qi* follows the path of the right *qi*’s entry and exit.
The *one who has not yet seen the disease* (*wèi dǔ qí jí*) is to know beforehand which channel’s disease is right or wrong.
The *one who does not know its origin* (*è zhī qí yuán*) is to know beforehand which channel’s disease it is and where to take it.

When the puncture is *subtle in number and slow* (*sǐ zhī wéi shù chí*), it refers to the meaning of slow and fast.
The *crude adherence to the pass* (*cū shǒu guān*) is adherence to the four limbs without knowing the ebb and flow of right and wrong blood and *qi*.
The *superior adherence to the mechanism* (*shàng shǒu jī*) is knowing how to guard the *qi*.
When the mechanism moves without leaving its emptiness, it means knowing the *qi*’s emptiness and fullness, and using the needle’s slow and fast accordingly.
When the mechanism in emptiness is clear and gently rubbed, it means the needle has obtained the *qi*—closely guarding the *qi* without losing it.

If its coming cannot be met, the *qi* is too strong and cannot be supplemented.
If its going cannot be pursued, the *qi* is too weak and cannot be drained.
If it cannot be hooked to release, it means the *qi* is easily lost.
If it is tapped but does not release, it means not knowing the intention of supplementation or drainage—the blood and *qi* are already exhausted, and the *qi* does not descend.

To know its ebb and flow is to know the *qi*’s reversal,顺, fullness, and emptiness.
To meet it at the appointed time is to know when the *qi* can be taken.
The *crude interval* (*cū jiān*) is dimly unaware of the *qi*’s subtlety and density.
Ah, the *superior* alone possesses this—fully knowing the needle’s intent.

What comes is *reversed*—speaking of the *qi*’s emptiness and smallness; smallness is reversal.
What arrives is *顺*—speaking of the balance of form and *qi*; balance is *顺*.
To clearly know reversal and *顺*, and act correctly without hesitation, means knowing where to take it.
To meet and seize it is to drain.
To pursue and assist it is to supplement.

What is called *“empty, then fill”* (*xū zé shí*) means the *qi* at the mouth is empty and should be supplemented.
What is called *“full, then drain”* (*mǎn zé xiè*) means the *qi* at the mouth is full and should be drained.
What is called *“twisted and spread, then remove”* (*wǎn chén zé chú*) is to remove blood from the vessels.
What is called *“wrong *qi* dominates, then empty”* (*xié shèng zé xū*) means that if any channel is excessive, its wrong *qi* should be drained.

Slow then fast is to fill—meaning slow entry and fast exit.
Fast then slow is to empty—meaning fast entry and slow exit.

Speaking of full and empty, as if present or absent—meaning fullness has *qi*, emptiness lacks *qi*.
Examining what comes after and before, as if lost or stored—meaning observing the *qi*’s emptiness and fullness, the order of supplementation and drainage, and whether the *qi* has descended or remains constant.

To act as if full or empty, as if obtained or lost—meaning supplementation is secretly as if obtained, drainage is joyfully as if lost.

As for the *qi* in the vessels:
When wrong *qi* is above, it means the wrong *qi* enters high, hence wrong *qi* is above.
When turbid *qi* is in the middle, it means water and grain all enter the stomach, their refined *qi* ascending to the lungs, their turbidity lingering in the intestines and stomach—speaking of improper cold and heat, unregulated eating and drinking, and disease arising in the intestines and stomach, hence it is called turbid *qi* in the middle.
When clear *qi* is below, it means the clear, damp earth *qi* enters, necessarily beginning at the feet, hence it is called clear *qi* below.

When the needle pierces the vessel and wrong *qi* emerges, take it from above.
When the needle is in the vessel and wrong *qi* emerges, take it from the *Yangming* convergence.
When the needle is too deep and wrong *qi* sinks back, it means shallow, superficial diseases should not be deeply punctured—deep puncture causes wrong *qi* to follow and enter, hence it is called sinking back.

Skin, flesh, sinews, and vessels each have their own place—meaning each channel and network has its own domain.

To take the five vessels is death—meaning the disease is internal, the *qi* is insufficient, and only using the needle to fully drain all the yin vessels.
To take the three yang vessels is unique—meaning fully draining the three yang *qi* so the patient feels satisfied and the disease ceases.

To seize yin is death—meaning taking the five *cùn* (inches) at the *chǐ* (foot), the five *wǎng* (directions).
To seize yang is madness—correct speech.

To observe its color, examine its eyes, know its dispersion or recovery, unify its form, and listen to its movement and stillness—meaning the superior practitioner knows the five colors in the eyes, understands the regulation of *cùn*, *fēn*, size, speed, and smoothness or roughness, to speak of the disease.

To know its right and wrong is to know the discussion of wrong *qi* and right *qi*’s wind.

The right hand pushes, the left holds and guides—meaning holding the needle as it enters and exits.
When the *qi* arrives, withdraw it—meaning adjusting the supplementing or draining *qi* and then withdrawing.
Adjusting the *qi* lies in the beginning and end—meaning maintaining focus.
The nodes intersecting at three hundred sixty-five convergences are the networks permeating the joints.

What is called *“the five *zàng*’s *qi* already severed internally”* is when the pulse and *qi* are internally severed and do not arrive, instead taking the external disease site and the yang channel’s convergence, leaving the needle to induce yang *qi*—when yang *qi* arrives, the internal exhaustion is severe, exhaustion is severe, and death follows. Its death is without *qi* to move, hence stillness.

What is called *“the five *zàng*’s *qi* already severed externally”* is when the pulse and *qi* are externally severed and do not arrive, instead taking the four extremities’ outputs, leaving the needle to induce yin *qi*—when yin *qi* arrives, yang *qi* reverses inward, inward means reversal, reversal means death. Its death is yin *qi* in excess, hence agitation.

Thus, examining the eyes: the five *zàng* manifest the five colors in brightness, brightness then sounds clearly, and clear sounds differ from one’s usual voice.

「【Phonetic Glossary】 *Wěirán* (佖然), pronounced as *wěi* with the *rán* (然) rhyme—*rán* is the sound of "must" (必), resembling a full appearance. *Yuèrán* (悦然), pronounced as *yuè* with the *rán* (然) rhyme—*rán* is the sound of "madness" (狂貌). *Shēn* (深) with *nà* (内) rhyme.

In the fourth method of *zàng-fǔ* (藏府) diseases caused by *xiéqi* (邪气), the Yellow Emperor asked Qìbó (岐伯): *"How does the *xiéqi* (邪气) invade a person?"* Qìbó replied: *"The *xiéqi* (邪气) invades a person by way of the **yang**."* The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Does the invasion of **yang** have a fixed degree?"* Qìbó answered: *"If the invasion occurs above the midpoint of the body, it is through **yang**; if below the midpoint, it is through dampness (**shī**—湿)."* Therefore it is said: *"The *xiéqi* (邪气) that invades a person has no fixed rule—when it strikes **yin**, it flows into the **fǔ** (府); when it strikes **yang**, it flows into the channels (**jīng**—经)."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"The **yin** and **yang** are different names but of the same kind, meeting above and below, and the channels and collaterals (**jīng-luò**—经络) interconnect like a ring without beginning or end. When *xiéqi* (邪气) invades a person, it may strike **yin** or **yang**, and its movement above, below, left, or right is without constancy—why is this?"* Qìbó replied: *"All the convergences of **yang** are found on the face. When a person is invaded by *xiéqi* (邪气), it is during moments of vulnerability—such as after exertion, or when excessive drinking, eating, sweating, or rational opening (**shǐnglǐ**—胜理) expose them. If the invasion strikes the face, it descends into the **Stomach** (胃) channel; if the neck, it descends into the **Large Intestine** (太阳) channel; if the cheek, it descends into the **Gallbladder** (少阳) channel. When it strikes the chest, back, or lateral sides, it also invades the channels."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How does the invasion of **yin** occur?"* Qìbó replied: *"When **yin** is invaded, it commonly begins with the **arms** and **fǔ** (府). The **yin** skin of the arms and **fǔ** is thin, while their flesh is rich and moist—thus, they both receive **wind** (*fēng*—风), but the **yin** is uniquely injured."* The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Does this mean the **zàng** (藏) is harmed?"* Qìbó replied: *"When **wind** invades the body, it does not necessarily agitate the **zàng**. Therefore, if *xiéqi* (邪气) enters the **yin** channels, the **zàng**’s *qi* becomes replete, and the *xiéqi* cannot lodge there—it returns to the **fǔ** (府). Hence, invasion of **yang** flows into the channels, while invasion of **yin** flows into the **fǔ**."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How does **wind** invade the five **zàng**?"* Qìbó replied: *"Grief and worry injure the **Heart** (心), cold exposure and cold drinks injure the **Lungs** (肺)—since both internal and external colds affect it, the *qi* reverses and ascends. A fall or traumatic injury causes stagnant **evil blood** (*èxiě*—恶血) to pool within, or great anger causes *qi* to rise but not descend, accumulating beneath the ribs—thus, the **Liver** (肝) is injured. A blow or stumble, drunkenness followed by sexual excess, or sweating while exposed to **wind**, injures the **Spleen** (脾). Excessive exertion or lifting heavy objects, or sexual excess followed by bathing and sweating, injures the **Kidneys** (肾)."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How does **wind** invade the five **zàng**?"* Qìbó replied: *"When both **yin** and **yang** are affected, the *xiéqi* (邪) can then proceed."* The Yellow Emperor said: *"Excellent."*

The Yellow Emperor asked Qìbó: *"I have heard that the head and face are linked to the bones and tendons, sharing blood and *qi* with the body. When the cold is extreme, the earth cracks and ice shatters—yet, in cases of severe cold, the hands and feet may become slack and listless, while the face remains unaffected. Why is this?"* Qìbó replied: *"The twelve primary channels (**jīngmài**—经脉) and their 365 collaterals (**luò**—络), all send their blood and *qi* upward to the face, circulating through the hollow cavities (**kòngqiào**—空窍). The refined **yang** *qi* ascends to the eyes, forming the **pupil** (*jīng*—睛). The divergent *qi* ascends to the ears, forming the sense of **hearing** (*tīng*—听). The **congregated *qi*** (*zōngqi*—宗气) ascends through the nose, forming **smell** (*chòu*—臭). The turbid *qi* (*zhuóqi*—浊气) from the **Stomach** (胃) ascends to the **tongue** (*shé*—舌), forming **taste** (*wèi*—味). The *qi*’s **moisture** (*jīn*—津液) all ascends to the face, and though the skin is thick and the flesh firm, extreme heat or cold cannot overcome it."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"When *xiéqi* (邪气) invades a person, how does the disease manifest?"* Qìbó replied: *"When **void pathogens** (*xūxié*—虚邪) invade the body, they scatter and move, visibly altering form. When **orthodox pathogens** (*zhèngxié*—正邪) invade, the changes are subtle—first appearing in the **complexion** (*sè*—色), imperceptible to the body. The disease may seem present or absent, tangible or intangible, with no clear discernible pattern."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Excellent."* The Yellow Emperor asked Qìbó: *"I have heard that observing the **complexion** (*sè*—色) reveals the disease—this is called **Clarity** (*míng*—明). Examining the **pulse** (*mài*—脉) reveals the disease—this is called **Divinity** (*shén*—神). Questioning the patient reveals the disease’s location—this is called **Skill** (*gōng*—工). I wish to understand how one sees and knows the disease, examines and confirms it, and questions to fully grasp it. How does this work?"*

Qìbó replied: *"The **complexion** (*sè*—色), **pulse** (*mài*—脉), and the **radial position** (*chǐ*—尺) correspond like the resonance of a bell and its echo—one cannot fail to match the other. This is also the principle of **root-and-branch** (*běnmògēnxiè*—本末根叶) diagnosis: if the root dies, the leaves wither. Thus, the **complexion**, **pulse**, **form**, and **flesh** cannot fail to correspond—knowing one reveals **Skill**; knowing two reveals **Divinity**; knowing all three reveals both **Divinity** and **Clarity**."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish to hear this fully."* Qìbó replied: *"A **greenish** (*qīng*—青) complexion corresponds to **Liver** disease, and its **pulse** is **taut** (*huán*—弦); a **red** (*chì*—赤) complexion corresponds to **Heart** disease, and its **pulse** is **crooked** (*gōu*—钩); a **yellow** (*huáng*—黄) complexion corresponds to **Spleen** disease, and its **pulse** is **intermittent** (*dài*—代); a **white** (*bái*—白) complexion corresponds to **Lungs** disease, and its **pulse** is **soft and sparse** (*máo*—毛); a **black** (*hēi*—黑) complexion corresponds to **Kidneys** disease, and its **pulse** is **hard and sharp** (*shí*—石). If one sees the **complexion** but cannot find its corresponding **pulse**, and instead finds the **pulse** that **overcomes** (*xiāngshèng*—相胜) it, then death follows. If one finds the **pulse** that **generates** (*xiāngshēng*—相生) it, then the disease has already passed."*

The Yellow Emperor asked Qìbó: *"How do the five **zàng** manifest in varying disease forms and transformations?"* Qìbó replied: *"First, determine the correspondence of the five **complexions** and five **pulses**—then the disease can be distinguished."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Having determined the **complexion** and **pulse**, how does one further distinguish the disease?"* Qìbó replied: *"By observing the **pulse**’s **tension** (*jí*—急), **relaxation** (*huǎn*—缓), **minuteness** (*xiǎo*—小), **magnitude** (*dà*—大), **smoothness** (*huá*—滑), and **roughness** (*sè*—涩), the disease’s transformations become clear."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How does one adjust these **pulse** qualities?"* Qìbó replied: *"When the **pulse** is **tensed**, the skin at the **radial position** is also tight; when the **pulse** is **relaxed**, the skin at the **radial position**’s **stone convergence** (*shíhuì*—石会) is also slack; when the **pulse** is **minute**, the skin at the **radial position** is also **thin and stretched**, causing **depression** (*zāng*—臧) and **opening** (*kāidòu*—开斗), with **weak *qi*** (*shǎoqì*—少气); when the **pulse** is **magnified**, the skin at the **radial position** is also **distended and raised** (*bīn*—贲); when the **pulse** is **slippery** (*piàn*—骗), the skin at the **radial position** is also **smooth** (*huá*—滑);"

「When the **pulse** is **tense** (*sè*—涩), the skin at the **radial position** is also tense. In all these variations, some are slight, others severe.

Thus, those skilled in adjusting the **radial position** do not need to rely on the **cubital position** (*cùn*—寸), and those skilled in adjusting the **pulse** do not need to rely on the **color** (*sè*—色). Those who can integrate and apply these principles may be called **Master Physicians** (*shànggōng*—上工), and **Master Physicians** succeed in nine out of ten cases. Those who practice two of these methods are **Intermediate Physicians** (*zhōnggōng*—中工), and **Intermediate Physicians** succeed in seven out of ten cases. Those who practice only one are **Junior Physicians** (*xiàgōng*—下工), and **Junior Physicians** succeed in six out of ten cases.

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How do the **pulse** variations of **tense** (*sè*—涩), **tense** (*jí*—急), **relaxed** (*huǎn*—缓), **minute** (*xiǎo*—小), **magnified** (*dà*—大), **slippery** (*piàn*—骗), and **tense** (*sè*—涩) manifest in disease?"* Qìbó replied: *"Let me speak of the **diseased transformations** (*bìngbiàn*—病变) of the **Five Zàng Organs** (*wǔzàng*—五藏).

For the **Heart** (*xīn*—心):
- When the **pulse** is **tense** (*jí*—急) and severe, it is **epilepsy** (*zhìzhèng*—痣症);
- When the **pulse** is slightly **tense**, it is **heart pain radiating to the back**, with difficulty swallowing.

For the **Lung** (*fèi*—肺):
- When the **pulse** is **tense** (*jí*—急) and severe, it is **mania** (*diānjí*—癫疾);
- When the **pulse** is slightly **tense**, it is **lung cold-heat** (*fèihánrè*—肺寒热), with **sluggish respiration** (*xīduò*—息惰), **coughing up blood**, radiating to the **loins, back, and chest**, or **nasal polyps** (*ruò bíxìròu bùtōng*—若鼻息肉不通).

For the **Liver** (*gān*—肝):
- When the **pulse** is **tense** (*jí*—急) and severe, it is **abusive speech** (*èyán*—恶言);
- When the **pulse** is slightly **tense**, it is **flank *qi*** (*féiqì*—肥气), located beneath the ribs as if covered by a cup.

For the **Spleen** (*pí*—脾):
- When the **pulse** is **tense** (*jí*—急) and severe, it is **virtue-phlegm** (*déshuì*—德痰);
- When the **pulse** is slightly **tense**, it is **diaphragmatic obstruction** (*gèzhōng*—膈中), where food and drink enter but are immediately regurgitated, and the **stomach** (*wèi*—胃) is **washed** (*hòuwòmò*—后沃沬).

For the **Kidney** (*shèn*—肾):
- When the **pulse** is **tense** (*jí*—急) and severe, it is **bone epilepsy** (*gǔdiānjí*—骨癫疾);
- When the **pulse** is slightly **tense**, it is **deep syncope** (*chénjué bēnzhì*—沉厥奔痹), with **unable to draw the feet** (*zúbùshōu*—足不收), and **inability to move forward or backward**.

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"When the **pulse** exhibits these six variations, how should one apply acupuncture?"* Qìbó replied: *"In cases where the **pulse** is **tense** (*jí*—急), there is **excessive cold** (*duōhán*—多寒); when it is **relaxed** (*huǎn*—缓), there is **excessive heat** (*duōrè*—多热); when it is **magnified** (*dà*—大), there is **excessive *qi* and deficient blood** (*duōqì shǎoxuè*—多气少血); when it is **minute** (*xiǎo*—小), both **blood and *qi*** (*xuèqì*—血气) are deficient; when it is **slippery** (*piàn*—骗), **yang *qi*** (*yángqì*—阳气) is **vigorous** (*shèng*—盛), with slight **heat** (*wéiyǒuhàn*—微有寒); when it is **tense** (*sè*—涩), there is **excessive blood and deficient *qi*** (*duōxuè shǎoqì*—多血少气), with slight **cold** (*wéiyǒuhàn*—微有寒).

Thus, when needling a **tense** (*jí*—急) **pulse**, one should **insert deeply** (*shēnrù*—深内) and **retain the needle for a long time** (*liúliúzhī*—久留之).
When needling a **relaxed** (*huǎn*—缓) **pulse**, one should **insert shallowly** (*qiǎnrù*—浅内) and **rapidly withdraw the needle** (*cìfāzhēn*—疾发针), to **dispel its heat** (*qùqíhàn*—去其热).
When needling a **magnified** (*dà*—大) **pulse**, one should **slightly reduce its *qi*** (*wēixiěqí*—微写其气), without **letting its blood escape** (*wúchūqíxuè*—无出其血).
When needling a **slippery** (*piàn*—骗) **pulse**, one should **rapidly withdraw the needle** (*cìfāzhēn*—疾发针) and **insert shallowly** (*qiǎnrù*—浅内), to **reduce its vigorous yang *qi*** (*xiěqíyángqì*—写其阳气) and **dispel its heat** (*qùqíhàn*—去其热).
When needling a **tense** (*sè*—涩) **pulse**, one must **pierce its vessel** (*bìzhōngqípài*—必中其脉), and **retain the needle for a long time** (*liúliúzhī*—久留之), following its **direction** (*nìxùn*—逆顺). One must **first press and follow** (*bìxiān'àn ér xúnzhī*—必先按而循之), then **insert the needle**, and **rapidly press its atrophy** (*cì'ànqíjié*—疾按其瘠), ensuring **no blood escapes** (*wúlìngqíxuèchū*—无令其血出), to **harmonize its pulse** (*héqípài*—和其脉).
For cases where the **pulse** is **minute** (*xiǎo*—小), both **yin and yang *qi*, form, and pulse** (*yīnyángxíngqì*—阴阳形气) are **deficient** (*bùzú*—不足). One should **not needle** (*wùqǔyǐzhēn*—勿取以针) but **adjust with sweet medicinals** (*tiáoyǐgānyào*—调以甘药).

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"I have heard that the **vital *qi*** (*qì*—气) of the **Five Zàng Organs** and **Six Fǔ Organs** (*liùfǔ*—六府) converge at the **honoring vessels** (*róngshū*—荣输) and **meeting points** (*hé*—合). I wish to know **by which pathways** (*dào*—道) this **vital *qi*** enters, and **how it connects and passes through** (*rù'āngliánguò*—入安连过), I would like to hear the reason for this."* Qìbó replied: *"These are the **separate pathways** (*bié rù*—别入) of the **yang vessels** (*yángmài*—阳脉), which **belong to the *Fǔ* Organs** (*shǔyúfǔ*—属於府)."

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Do the **honoring vessels** (*róngshū*—荣输), **meeting points** (*hé*—合), and **convergence** (*hé*—合) each have distinct names?"* Qìbó replied: *"The **honoring vessels** (*róngshū*—荣输) govern the **external pathways** (*wàijīng*—外经), while the **meeting points** (*hé*—合) govern the **internal *Fǔ* Organs** (*nèifǔ*—内府)." The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How does one govern the **internal *Fǔ* Organs**?"* Qìbó replied: *"By taking points at the **meeting points** (*hé*—合)."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Do the **meeting points** (*hé*—合) each have distinct names?"* Qìbó replied: *"The **meeting point** of the **Stomach** (*wèi*—胃) is **Three Miles** (*sānlǐ*—三里); the **meeting point** of the **Large Intestine** (*dàcháng*—大肠) is **Upper Jùxū** (*jùxūshànglián*—巨虚上廉); the **meeting point** of the **Small Intestine** (*xiǎocháng*—小肠) is **Lower Jùxū** (*jùxūxiàlián*—巨虚下廉); the **meeting point** of the **Triple Burner** (*sānjiāo*—三焦) is **Wěiyáng** (*wěiyáng*—委阳); the **meeting point** of the **Bladder** (*pángguāng*—膀胱) is **Central Wěi** (*wěizhōng*—委中央); the **meeting point** of the **Gallbladder** (*dǎn*—胆) is **Yánglíngquán** (*yánglíngquán*—阳陵泉)."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How does one take these points?"* Qìbó replied: *"To take **Three Miles**, one should **lower the knee** (*dīpì*—低驸); to take **Jùxū**, one should **lift the foot** (*jǔzú*—举足); to take **Wěiyáng**, one should **flex and extend** (*qūshēn ér suǒzhī*—屈伸而索之); to take **Central Wěi**, one should **flex** (*qū*—屈) and take the point; to take **Yánglíngquán**, one should **straighten the knee** (*zhèngjiān xīyǔzhīqí*—正坚膝予之齐), and **withdraw downward to Wěiyáng’s yang** (*xiàzhìwěiyángzhīyángqǔzhī*—下至委阳之阳取之); to take points on the **external pathways** (*wàijīng*—外经), one should **apply pressure and follow** (*yúshēn ér cóngzhī*—榆申而从之)."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"I wish to hear of the **diseases** (*bìng*—病) of the **Six Fǔ Organs** (*liùfǔ*—六府)."*

Qìbó replied: *"If the face is hot, it is a disease of the **Fǔ of the Foot-Sun** (*Fǔ*—府) **Brightness** (*Yángmíng*—阳明). If the **fish-net veins** (*Yúlù*—鱼络) bleed, it is a disease of the **Fǔ of the Hand-Sun** (*Shǒu Yángmíng*—手阳明). If the pulse above the **two knees** (*Liǎngpì*—两驸) rises and sinks like a vertical shaft, it is a disease of the **Fǔ of the Foot-Sun Brightness** (*Zhè shì wèi mài—此胃脉也*), which belongs to the **Fǔ of the Foot-Sun** (*Zú Yángmíng*—足阳明).

When the **Large Intestine** (*Dàcháng*—大肠) is diseased, there is cutting pain in the intestines, accompanied by a rumbling sound (*wūzhuózhuo*—呜濯濯). If the cold is severe in winter, it leads to diarrhea. Pain is felt at the navel, and one cannot stand for long. Its symptoms are shared with the stomach; one should take **Jùxū Upper Corner** (*Jùxū Shànglián*—巨虚上廉).

When the **stomach** (*Wèi*—胃) is diseased, the abdomen is taut and distended, with pain in the **stomach’s chamber** (*Wèi yuàn—胃院*) at the level of the heart. It radiates upward to the **two flanks** (*Shàngzhī—上支*), obstructs the **esophagus** (*Gègè—膈咽), and prevents food and drink from descending. One should take **Three Miles** (*Sānlǐ—三里).

When the **Small Intestine** (*Xiǎocháng*—小肠) is diseased, the lower abdomen aches, and the **lumbar spine** (*Yāobèi—腰脊*) feels constricted and painful near the **testicles** (*kònggōng—控睪). After urination, heat arises before the ear. If the cold is extreme, or if the **shoulder** (*Jǔ—肩*) above the **Hand-Tàiyáng** (*Shǒu Tàiyáng—手太阳*) pathway is excessively hot, or if the space between the **little finger** (*Xiǎozhǐ—小指*) and the **second finger** (*Cìzhǐ—次指*) is hot, or if the pulse sinks (*pìxiàn—脉陷*), these are its symptoms. One should take **Jùxū Lower Corner** (*Jùxū Xiàlián—巨虚下廉).

When the **Triple Burner** (*Sānjiāo—三焦*) is diseased, the abdomen feels full of **qi** (*Fùqì—腹气*), and the lower abdomen is particularly rigid. One cannot urinate, and there is urgency, with overflow leading to **watery discharge** (*shuǐ—水*), and retention causing **distension** (*Zhàng—胀). Its symptoms appear on the **external major collaterals** (*Wàijīng Dàluò—外经大络) of the **Foot-Tàiyáng** (*Zú Tàiyáng—足太阳*), located between the **Foot-Tàiyáng** (*Zú Tàiyáng—足太阳*) and **Foot-Shàoyáng** (*Zú Shàoyáng—足少阳*) pathways, also manifesting in the pulse. One should take **Wěiyáng** (*Wěiyáng—委阳).

When the **Bladder** (*Pángguāng—膀胱*) is diseased, the lower abdomen swells and aches on one side. Pressing it with the hand induces the urge to urinate but fails. Heat or a sinking pulse (*pìxiàn—脉陷*) appears above the shoulder, as well as on the **outer side of the little toe** (*Xiǎozhǐ Wàilián—小指外廉*) and behind the **lateral malleolus** (*Jīnghuái—经踝). One should take **Central Wěi** (*Wěizhōng—委中央).

When the **Gallbladder** (*Dǎn—胆*) is diseased, one often **sighs deeply** (*Shàn tàixī—善太息*), the mouth tastes bitter, one **regurgitates old bile** (*ǒuxì—呕宿汁), and the chest feels **dim and hollow** (*Xīnxià dàn dàn—心下澹澹). One fears being seized by others and feels **anxious** (*Kǒngzhōng—恐人将捕之). The throat is **constricted and uncomfortable** (*pǒnpǒn—嗑中盼盼然), and one frequently spits. Its symptoms appear at the **beginning and end** (*Běnmò—本末) of the **Foot-Shàoyáng** pathway. If the pulse sinks (*pìxiàn—脉陷*), one should **moxibust** (*Jiù—灸) it. If there are **alternating cold and heat** (*Zhènhuò—寒热) symptoms, one should take **Yánglíngquán** (*Yánglíngquán—阳陵泉).

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Is there a proper method for **acupuncture** (*Cì—刺*)?"*
Qìbó replied: *"When acupuncture is applied here, one must strike the **qi orifices** (*Qìxué—气穴), avoiding the **flesh nodes** (*Ròujiē—肉节). If the **qi orifices** are struck, the needle will **wander in the passageways** (*Yóu yú xiàng—游於巷); if the **flesh nodes** are struck, the skin will ache. **Reinforcing** (*Bǔ—补) or **reducing** (*Xiē—泻) incorrectly will worsen the disease.

If the **central tendons** (*Zhōngjīn—中筋) are struck, the tendons will relax, and **evil qi** (*Xiéqì—邪气) will not exit. It will **clash with the true essence** (*Zhēn—真) and become chaotic, neither dispersing nor returning inward to lodge again. If the needle is not used properly, what should be **harmonious** (*Shùn—顺) is treated as **contrary** (*Nì—逆).

**Huángdì Nèijīng Língshū Jízhù Juàn zhī sān Gēnjié Dìwǔ Fǎ yīn**

**Qībó** said:
The **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth—how they resonate in harmony, their **qi** of cold and warmth flowing in exchange—who prevails, the Yin or the Yang? The Yin **Dao/Way** manifests in pairs, the Yang in singularity. When **diseased-qi** arises in spring and summer, Yin **qi** is scant while Yang **qi** dominates; if Yin and Yang are unbalanced, what **supplementation** or **drainage** can be applied?

When **diseased-qi** arises in autumn and winter, Yang **qi** is scant while Yin **qi** prevails, its vigor overwhelming as Yang **qi** wanes. Thus, the **stem and leaves** wither and decay, and the **moist rains descend**, returning to their source. As Yin and Yang shift in exchange, what **drainage** or **supplementation** can be applied?

The **strange pathogens** that stray from the **main channels** are countless; if one does not grasp their **roots and nodes**, the **Five Zàng** (organs) and **Six Fǔ** (entrails) will falter, their **joints and pivots** (关枢) defeated. The **portals** open and the **pathogens flee**, causing a great imbalance of Yin and Yang—irreparable once lost.

The **mysteries of the Nine Needles** lie in their **commencement and conclusion**; thus, one who knows these can **diagnose and treat in a single utterance**. If one does not grasp their **commencement and conclusion**, the **Dao/Way of acupuncture** will utterly perish.

The **Taiyang** **main channel** roots in **Zhìyīn** (至阴), its **node** at the **Mìngmén** (命门). The **Mìngmén** is the **eye**. The **Yángmíng** **main channel** roots at **Lìduì** (厉兑), its **node** at **Kēdà** (颗大). The **Kēdà** is the **ear-pincher** (钳耳). The **Shàoyáng** **main channel** roots at **Qiàoyīn** (窍阴), its **node** at **Chuānglóng** (窗笼). The **Chuānglóng** is the **ear canal**.

The **Taiyang** governs **opening** (开), the **Yángmíng** governs **closing** (阖), and the **Shàoyáng** governs the **pivot** (枢). Thus, if **opening** is impaired, the **flesh-joints** (肉节) are drenched and **sudden diseases** arise. Therefore, those with **sudden diseases** are treated at the **Taiyang**; one examines whether the **qi** is in **excess** or **deficiency**, for those with **drenching** (渎) will see their **skin and flesh** soften, forming pus and weakness.

If **closing** is impaired, the **qi** has nowhere to rest, and **flaccid ailments** (痿疾) arise. Therefore, those with **flaccid ailments** are treated at the **Yángmíng**; one examines whether the **qi** is in **excess** or **deficiency**, for those with **nowhere to rest** will have their **true qi** stagnate while **pathogenic qi** occupies its place.

If the **pivot** is impaired, the **bones** will **shake and tremble** (县), unable to settle upon the earth. Therefore, those with **shaking bones** are treated at the **Shàoyáng**; one examines whether the **qi** is in **excess** or **deficiency**, for those with **shaking bones** will have **loose joints** (节缓) that fail to contract. This **shaking** is what is meant by **shaking bones**; one must **exhaustively probe its source**.

The **Tàiyīn** **main channel** roots at **Yǐnbái** (隐白), its **node** at **Tàicāng** (太仓). The **Shàoyīn** **main channel** roots at **Yǒngquán** (涌泉), its **node** at **Liánquán** (廉泉). The **Juéyīn** **main channel** roots at **Dàdūn** (大敦), its **node** at **Yùyīng** (玉英), its **collateral** at **Shànzhōng** (擅中). The **Tàiyīn** governs **opening**, the **Juéyīn** governs **closing**, and the **Shàoyīn** governs the **pivot**. Thus, if **opening** is impaired, the **granary** (仓) will **lack output**, causing **diaphragmatic rupture** (膈洞). Those with **diaphragmatic rupture** are treated at the **Tàiyīn**; one examines whether the **qi** is in **excess** or **deficiency**, for those with **opening** impaired will suffer from **insufficient qi** and disease.

If **closing** is impaired, the **qi** will **sever**, causing **joy and sorrow** (喜悲) to alternate. Those with **sorrow** are treated at the **Juéyīn**; one examines whether the **qi** is in **excess** or **deficiency**.

If the **pivot** is impaired, the **pulse** will have **blockages** (结) and fail to flow. Those with **blocked pulses** are treated at the **Shàoyīn**; one examines whether the **qi** is in **excess** or **deficiency**, for all cases of **blockage** stem from **deficiency**.

The **foot Taiyang** **main channel** roots at **Zhìyīn**, **trickles** (溜) at **Jīnggǔ** (京骨), **flows into** (注) **Kūnlún** (昆仑), and **enters** (入) **Tiānjì** (天柱) and **Fēiyáng** (飞扬).
The **foot Shàoyáng** **main channel** roots at **Qiàoyīn**, **trickles** at **Qiūxū** (丘墟), **flows into** **Yángfǔ** (阳辅), and **enters** **Tiānróng** (天容) and **Guāngmíng** (光明).
The **foot Yángmíng** **main channel** roots at **Lìduì**, **trickles** at **Chōngyáng** (冲阳), **flows into** **Xiàlíng** (下陵), and **enters** **Rényíng** (人迎) and **Fēnglóng** (丰隆).
The **hand Taiyang** **main channel** roots at **Shàozé** (少泽), **trickles** at **Yánggǔ** (阳谷), **flows into** **Shàohǎi** (少海), and **enters** **Tiānchuāng** (天窗) and **Zhīzhèng** (支正).
The **hand Shàoyáng** **main channel** roots at **Guānchōng** (关冲), **trickles** at **Yángchí** (阳池), **flows into** **Zhīgōu** (支沟), and **enters** **Tiānyòu** (天牖) and **Wàiguān** (外关).
The **hand Yángmíng** **main channel** roots at **Shāngyáng** (商阳), **trickles** at **Hégǔ** (合谷), **flows into** **Yángxī** (阳溪), and **enters** **Fútū** (扶突) and **Piānlì** (偏历).

These are the **Twelve Main Channels** (十二经); their **collaterals** and **networks** (络) must all be treated accordingly.

The **body’s fifty circuits** (营) complete one cycle in a day and five in a night, **distributing** the **essence** of the **Five Zàng** (organs). If the pulse does not conform to this count, it is called **maddened pulse** (狂生). The **fifty circuits** refer to the **Five Zàng** all receiving **qi**; one holds their **pulse gates** (脉口) and counts its arrivals. If **fifty beats** occur without a single pause, all **Five Zàng** receive **qi**; if **forty beats** occur with one pause, one **Zàng** lacks **qi**; if **thirty beats** occur with one pause, two **Zàng** lack **qi**; if **twenty beats** occur with one pause, three **Zàng** lack **qi**; if **ten beats** occur with one pause, four **Zàng** lack **qi**; if fewer than **ten beats** occur with one pause, all five **Zàng** lack **qi**. This is what is called **shortened pulse**; its key lies in **commencement and conclusion**.

By **fifty beats without pause**, one establishes the norm. To **know the fate** of the **Five Zàng** and **shorten the pulse**, one must **count swiftly, then pause**. The **Yellow Emperor** said:
*"To invert or conform to the five corporeal forms*—that is, the **size of one’s bones and joints**, the **firmness or fragility of one’s flesh**, the **thickness or thinness of one’s skin**, the **clarity or turbidity of one’s blood**, the **smoothness or roughness of one’s qi**, the **length or brevity of one’s pulse**, the **abundance or scarcity of one’s blood**, and the **number of one’s channels and collaterals**—these I already know. Such knowledge belongs even to the **common folk** (布衣匹夫之士).

But what of **noble lords and great officials** (王公大人), those who **consume grain and blood** (血食之君)? Their **bodies are soft and fragile**, their **flesh and muscles weak**, their **blood and qi** **turbulent and swift** (栗悍滑利). Can their **needling**—whether **slow or fast**, **shallow or deep**—be the same as that of the common folk?"

**Qībó** replied:
*"The **flavor of rich foods** (膏粱菽蕾) renders such equality impossible! If the **qi** is **smooth**, the pulse will **emerge swiftly**; if the **qi** is **rough**, the pulse will **emerge late**. If the **qi** is **turbulent**, one must use a **small needle** and **insert shallowly**; if the **qi** is **rough**, one must use a **large needle** and **insert deeply**. Deep insertion requires **dwelling**, shallow insertion requires **speed**. Thus, when treating the **common folk**, one **inserts deeply** and **dwells**; when treating the **noble**, one **needles lightly** and **proceeds slowly**—all this is due to their **turbulent, swift qi**."

The **Yellow Emperor** asked:
*"How does one address the **inversion or conformity** of **form and qi**?"*

**Qībó** replied:
*"If **form and qi** are **deficient** while **disease-qi** is in **excess**, the **pathogen prevails**; one must **urgently drain** it. If **form and qi** are in **excess** while **disease-qi** is **deficient**, one must **urgently supplement** it. If **form and qi** are both **deficient** and **disease-qi** is also **deficient**, this is a case where **Yin and Yang qi are both deficient**; one must **not needle** it, for needling will **aggravate the deficiency**. If needling aggravates the deficiency, **Yin and Yang will both be exhausted**, the **blood and qi depleted**, the **Five Zàng** **hollow and void**, the **sinews, bones, and marrow** **withered and dry**. The **aged** will **perish**, the **strong** will **never recover**.

If **form and qi** are both in **excess** and **disease-qi** is also in **excess**, this is a case where **Yin and Yang are both in excess**; one must **urgently drain the pathogen** and **balance the excess and deficiency**."*

Thus it is said: **"Excess must be drained; deficiency must be supplemented.** This is the principle.

Therefore, it is said: **Needling without discerning excess and deficiency causes true and pathogenic *qi* to clash.** If one supplements when the body is already **replete**, then **Yin and Yang will overflow**, the **intestines and stomach will distend**, the **lungs and liver will rupture internally**, and **Yin and Yang will be disordered**. If one drains when the body is **hollow and void**, then the **meridians and vessels will be emptied**, the **blood and *qi* will be exhausted and dried**, the **intestines and stomach will be struck in terror**, the **skin will become thin and clinging**, the **hair will wither and fall prematurely**, and **life’s end will be hastened**.

Therefore, it is said: **The essential skill in needling lies in knowing how to balance Yin and Yang**; when **Yin and Yang are harmonized**, the **vital *qi* will shine forth**, and when **form and *qi* are united**, the **spirit will be securely housed**.

Therefore, it is said: **The superior practitioner harmonizes the *qi*, the mediocre practitioner disrupts the pulse, and the inferior practitioner exhausts the *qi*, endangering life.** Therefore, it is said: **The inferior practitioner must not be taken lightly.**

One must **thoroughly examine the diseases of the Five Zàng**, their **manifestations in the Five Mai**, the **fullness and hollowness of the meridians and collaterals**, and the **softness or coarseness of the skin** before proceeding to treatment.

**Longevity and Premature Death: The Sixth Law of Strength and Weakness**

The Yellow Emperor asked Master Shào: *"I have heard that among humans, there are those with strength and those with weakness, those who are frail and those who are strong, those with short lives and those with long, those with excess yin and those with excess yang. I wish to hear the principles behind these."* Master Shào replied: *"Within yin lies yin, and within yang lies yang. If one understands yin and yang thoroughly, then acupuncture has a method. When the disease’s origin is known, acupuncture has its logic. Carefully measure the disease’s onset and align with the season—internally harmonizing with the Five Zàng and Six Fǔ, externally harmonizing with sinews, bones, skin, and flesh. Thus, within the body, the Five Zàng are yin, and the Six Fǔ are yang; externally, sinews and bones are yin, and skin and flesh are yang.

Therefore, when a disease occurs in the yin of yin, one must puncture the *honor* and *shu* pulses of yin;
When a disease occurs in the yang of yang, one must puncture the *he* pulses of yang;
When a disease occurs in the yin of yang, one must puncture the *jing* channels of yin;
When a disease occurs in the yang of yin, one must puncture the *luò* vessels.

Hence, when a disease is in yang, it is called *fēng* (wind);
When a disease is in yin, it is called *bì* (obstruction);
When both yin and yang are diseased, it is called *fēng-bì* (wind-obstruction).

A disease with form but no pain belongs to the yang category;
A disease without form but with pain belongs to the yin category.

When there is no form but pain exists, it is because yang is intact while yin is injured—urgently treat the yin, do not attack the yang;
When there is form but no pain, it is because yin is intact while yang is injured—urgently treat the yang, do not attack the yin.

When both yin and yang are active, the disease alternately has form and lacks form, and is accompanied by agitation—this is called *yin overcoming yang*, meaning it is neither superficial nor deep; its form will not persist long.*

The Yellow Emperor asked Master Bó Gāo: *"I have heard of the sequence of disease in form and qi, and their external and internal responses. How does this work?"* Master Bó Gāo replied: *"Wind and cold injure the form; grief, fear, anger, and resentment injure the qi. When qi is injured, the Zàng are diseased; when the form is injured by cold, the form itself responds. When sinews and vessels are injured by wind, the sinews and vessels respond. This is how the form and qi correspond externally and internally."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How does one apply acupuncture in such cases?"* Master Bó Gāo replied: *"For a disease lasting nine days, three punctures suffice; for a disease lasting one month, ten punctures suffice. Adjust the number based on the severity and proximity of the disease. For lingering obstruction that does not leave the body, examine the blood vessels and exhaust their blood."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How does one determine the difficulty of treating external and internal diseases?"* Master Bó Gāo replied: *"If the form is first diseased but has not yet entered the Zàng, halve the number of days; if the Zàng are first diseased and the form responds afterward, double the number of days. This is the principle of external and internal difficulty."*

The Yellow Emperor asked Master Bó Gāo: *"I have heard that form has degrees of slackness and tension, qi has fluctuations of abundance and decline, bones vary in size, flesh in firmness and fragility, and skin in thickness and thinness. How does one establish longevity or premature death based on these?"* Master Bó Gāo replied: *"When form and qi support each other, longevity follows; when they do not, death is premature. When skin and flesh mutually reinforce each other, longevity follows; when they do not, death is premature. When blood, qi, channels, and vessels surpass the form in strength, longevity follows; when they cannot, death is premature."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"What is meant by the form’s slackness and tension?"* Master Bó Gāo replied: *"When the form is full and the skin slack, longevity follows; when the form is full but the skin taut, death is premature. When the form is full and the pulse firm and large, it is harmonious; when the form is full but the pulse small and weak, the qi is declining—decline brings peril. If the form is full but suddenly fails to rise, the bones are small; small bones mean premature death. When the form is full and the flesh is large yet firm with clear definition, the flesh is firm—firm flesh brings longevity. When the form is full but the flesh is large without clear definition and lacks firmness, the flesh is fragile—fragile flesh brings premature death. This is the Heavenly law governing life and death, determining the form and observing qi to establish longevity or premature death. One must grasp this principle, establish the form and observe the qi, and then treat the patient accordingly, deciding life or death."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I have heard that longevity and premature death cannot be measured."* Master Bó Gāo replied: *"If a person’s foundation is low and their height does not reach their base, they will not live to thirty; if they have additional causes of illness, they may not even reach twenty."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How does the interplay of form and qi determine longevity or premature death?"* Master Bó Gāo replied: *"In a healthy person, if qi surpasses the form, longevity follows; in a diseased person, if flesh and form are depleted but qi surpasses the form, death follows; if the form overpowers the qi, danger ensues."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I have heard that acupuncture has three variations. What are these three variations?"* Master Bó Gāo replied: *"There is puncturing the *yíng* (nutritive), puncturing the *wèi* (defensive), and puncturing lingering cold-obstruction in the *jing* (channel) vessels."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How does one apply acupuncture to these three variations?"* Master Bó Gāo replied: *"Puncturing the *yíng* causes blood to flow; puncturing the *wèi* releases qi; puncturing cold-obstruction generates internal heat."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How do *yíng*, *wèi*, and cold-obstruction manifest as diseases?"* Master Bó Gāo replied: *"When *yíng* generates disease, it manifests as chills and fever, shortness of breath, and blood flowing erratically above and below. When *wèi* generates disease, it manifests as pain in the qi that comes and goes, agitation, and wind-cold lodged in the intestines and stomach. When cold-obstruction generates disease, it lingers without leaving, causing intermittent pain and numbness in the skin."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How does one puncture cold-obstruction to generate internal heat?"* Master Bó Gāo replied: *"For a commoner, use fire to cauterize; for a noble, apply moxibustion with medicine."* The Yellow Emperor said: *"How does one apply medicinal moxibustion?"* Master Bó Gāo replied: *"Take twenty *shēng* (升) of pure wine, one *shēng* of Sichuan pepper, one *jīn* (斤) of dried ginger, and one *jīn* of cassia bark—four ingredients total. All are to be ground into a powder, soaked in wine, and mixed with one *jīn* of cotton and four *zhǎng* (丈) of fine white cloth. Combine these with the wine, place in a horse-dung furnace, seal with mud, and prevent leaks. After five days and five nights, remove the cloth and cotton, dry them in the sun, then re-soak them in wine until all the liquid is exhausted."*

Each time the cloth is soaked, mark the day and then dry it. Once dry, combine the residue with the cotton and cloth, folding them into six or seven bandages, each six or seven *chǐ* (尺) in length. Use these to warm fresh mulberry charcoal, then apply the heated bandages to the cold-obstruction sites where acupuncture was performed, allowing the heat to penetrate to the afflicted area. When the cold returns, reheat the bandages and apply them again—thirty times in total. Once perspiration emerges, wipe the body with the bandages, also thirty times, before rising. Avoid exposure to wind afterward. Each acupuncture session must be followed by moxibustion; thus, the ailment shall be cured. This is what is meant by *internal heat*.

**The Seventh Method of Official Needles (官针第七法星):**
The essence of acupuncture lies in the mastery of official needles. Each of the nine needles has its proper use—long or short, large or small—each applied according to its purpose. If misapplied, the disease cannot be cured.

- If the ailment is shallow but the needle is deep, it will injure the good flesh, causing *flaccidity* (瘫) of the skin.
- If the ailment is deep but the needle is shallow, the pathogenic *qi* will not be expelled, leading to *large abscesses* (大脓).
- If the ailment is minor but the needle is large, the expulsion of *qi* will be excessive, harming the patient.
- If the ailment is severe but the needle is small, the pathogenic *qi* will not be fully released, resulting in failure.

When the needle’s use is lost, the greater harm is done. Now, let us discuss its proper applications:

- If the disease is in the skin at an irregular location, use a *cai* needle (才针) at the affected site, avoiding white-skinned areas.
- If the disease is in the *flesh* (分肉), use a *yuán* needle (圆针) at the affected site.
- If the disease is in the *meridians and collaterals* (经络疯痹), use a *fēng* needle (锋针).
- If the disease is in the *pulse* (脉) and *qi* is deficient, requiring supplementation, use a *tí* needle (缇针) at the *jing-well*, *ying-spring*, or *shu-stream* points.
- If the disease results in a *large abscess* (大脓), use a *bì* needle (铍针).
- If the disease is a *sudden outbreak of stagnant qi* (痹气暴发), use a sharp *yuán* needle (圆利针).
- If the disease is *stagnant qi causing persistent pain* (痹气痛而不去), use a *háo* needle (毫针).
- If the disease is *internal* (在中), use a *long needle* (长针).
- If the disease is *water retention causing inability to move joints* (水肿不能通关节), use a *large needle* (大针).
- If the disease is *fixed in the five viscera* (五藏固居), use a *fēng* needle (锋针) at the *jing-well*, *ying-spring*, or *shu-stream* points, applying the method of the four seasons.

There are nine methods of acupuncture, corresponding to nine variations:

1. **Shū Sà (输刺):** Acupuncture at the *confluences*, *collaterals*, *viscera*, and *facets* (输藏脸) of the meridians.
2. **Yuǎn Dào Sà (远道刺):** Distant-point acupuncture—if the disease is above, treat below, targeting the *facets* (府脸).
3. **Jīng Sà (经刺):** Acupuncture at the *major meridians*, their *networks*, and *branches* (结络经分).
4. **Luò Sà (络刺):** Acupuncture at the *minor collaterals* and *blood vessels* (小络之血脉).
5. **Fèn Sà (分刺):** Acupuncture between the *flesh layers* (分肉之间).
6. **Dà Xiě Sà (大写刺):** Acupuncture for *large abscesses* using a *bì* needle (铍针).
7. **Máo Sà (毛刺):** Acupuncture for *superficial stagnation* in the skin (浮痹皮肤).
8. **Jù Sà (巨刺):** Contralateral acupuncture—left side treated for right side ailments, and vice versa.
9. **Cuì Sà (悴刺):** Cauterization acupuncture—using a *burning needle* (燔针) to treat stagnation (痹).

There are twelve acupuncture techniques corresponding to the twelve meridians:

1. **Ǎi Sà (偶刺):** *Paired acupuncture*—with the hand aligned to the heart or back, one needle is inserted forward, another backward, treating *heart stagnation* (心痹). This is also called *傍针* (pang-zhen, oblique needling).
2. **Bào Sà (报刺):** *Responsive acupuncture*—needling where pain is irregular. If moving upward or downward, insert directly inward without withdrawing the needle; use the left hand to press the affected area before reinserting.
3. **Huī Sà (恢刺):** *Expansive acupuncture*—insert directly and obliquely, lifting forward and backward to relax *tight tendons*, treating *tendon stagnation* (筋痹).
4. **Qí Sà (齐刺):** *Uniform acupuncture*—insert one needle straight, two obliquely, treating *slightly deep cold* (寒气小深). Alternatively, *three-needle technique* (三刺) for *deeper stagnant qi* (痹气小深).
5. **Yáng Sà (扬刺):** *Elevated acupuncture*—insert one needle straight, four obliquely, then float it, treating *widespread cold* (寒气之博大).
6. **Zhí Zhēn Sà (直针刺):** *Direct-needle acupuncture*—pull the skin taut before inserting, treating *superficial cold* (寒气之浅).
7. **Shū Sà (输刺):** *Confluence acupuncture*—insert and withdraw directly, using sparse shallow insertions to reach depth, treating *excessive heat* (气盛而热).
8. **Duǎn Sà (短刺):** *Short acupuncture*—needle *bone stagnation* (骨痹), shaking slightly to reach depth, rubbing the needle against the bone.
9. **Fú Sà (浮刺):** *Floating acupuncture*—insert obliquely and float the needle, treating *muscle tension and cold* (肌急而寒).
10. **Yīn Sà (阴刺):** *Yin acupuncture*—needle left and right alternately, treating *cold contraction* (寒厥) and *midline cold contraction* (中寒厥), targeting the *minor yin* behind the ankle (足踝后少阴).
11. **Páng Zhēn Sà (傍针刺):** *Oblique-needle acupuncture*—insert one needle straight, one obliquely, treating *persistent stagnation* (留痹久居).
12. **Zàn Sà (赞刺):** *Assisting acupuncture*—insert and withdraw repeatedly with shallow needling to induce bleeding, treating *flaccidity and swelling* (瘫肿).

If the pulse resides deep and is unseen, needle it *slightly inward* and leave the needle for a long time to reach the *empty pulse qi* (空脉气). For shallow pulses, do not needle directly; press until the pulse is cut off before inserting, ensuring no *essence* (精) is lost—only the *pathogenic qi* (邪气) should be expelled.

The so-called *three-needle technique* (三刺) where *stomach qi* (谷气) emerges:
- First, needle shallowly to cut the skin, expelling *yang pathogenic factors* (阳邪).
- Second, needle slightly deeper to reach the muscles, cutting the skin but not entering the *flesh layers* (分肉问), expelling *yin pathogenic factors* (阴邪).
- Once the needle enters the *flesh layers*, *stomach qi* emerges.

Thus, the *Needling Method* (刺法) states:
*"Begin with shallow needling to drive out pathogenic qi and summon blood qi; later, needle deeply to reach yin pathogenic factors."*

In the final stage, needle to the utmost depth to expel *stomach qi* (谷气).
This is what is meant.

Thus, those who wield the needle, if they fail to account for the years that have passed upon a person, the waxing and waning of their *qi* (气), or the rise and fall of their *empty* and *full* states (虚实), cannot be considered skilled practitioners.

In general, there are five needling techniques, corresponding to the five *zàng* organs (五藏):
1. **Half-needling (半刺)**—Half-needling is shallow insertion with swift withdrawal, ensuring no injury to the flesh, resembling plucking a hair; it targets *skin qi* (皮气), which pertains to the *lung* (肺).
2. **Leopard-spot needling (豹文刺)**—Leopard-spot needling involves piercing left, right, front, and back around the central pulse, to draw *channel-network blood* (经络之血); this pertains to the *heart* (心).
3. **Barrier needling (关刺)**—Barrier needling is a straight insertion left and right, reaching the tendons' uppermost layer, to treat *tendon stagnation* (筋痹); care must be taken not to cause bleeding. This pertains to the *liver* (肝), or it is also called **Deep-needling (渊刺)** or **Gorge needling (岂刺)**.
4. **Converging-valley needling (合谷刺)**—Converging-valley needling involves piercing the *blended flesh layers* (鹦足) on either side, targeting *muscle stagnation* (肌痹); this pertains to the *spleen* (脾).
5. **Empty-needling (输刺)**—Empty-needling is a straight insertion and withdrawal, penetrating to the bone, to treat *bone stagnation* (骨痹); this pertains to the *kidney* (肾).

**Phonetic Notes (音释):**
- *燔* (fán) above "针" (zhēn) is pronounced as *fán* (or *fèn*).
- *恢* (huī) in "恢刺" (huī cì) is pronounced *kuí* (苦回切), meaning "great" (大). One variant reads *guài* (怪).

**Chapter 8: The Dao of Spirit (本神第八)**

The Yellow Emperor asked Qibo:
*"In the art of needling, one must first establish harmony with the spirit (神).
Blood, pulse, nourishment (营), qi, and spirit—these are what the five viscera store.
When these overflow and stray from their proper abode, the essence (精) is lost, the soul (魂) and vital breath (魄) scatter, and will, intent, and cognition wander from the body. What causes this? Is it the fault of Heaven, or human error?
What are *virtue (德)*, *qi*, *life (生)*, *essence (精)*, *spirit (神)*, *soul (魂)*, *vital breath (魄)*, *heart (心)*, *intent (意)*, *will (志)*, *thought (思)*, *wisdom (智)*, and *deliberation (虑)*?
I beg you to explain their nature."*

Qibo replied:
*"Heaven’s influence within us is *virtue (德)*, Earth’s influence is *qi (气)*.
When *virtue* flows and *qi* is nurtured, life emerges—this is called *essence (精)*.
When two essences converge, it is called *spirit (神)*.
That which follows the spirit in its movements is called *soul (魂)*.
That which enters and exits alongside the essence is called *vital breath (魄)*.
That which governs the body is called *heart (心)*.
When the heart recalls, it is called *intent (意)*.
Where intent lingers, it is called *will (志)*.
When will adapts to change, it is called *thought (思)*.
When thought reaches beyond, it is called *deliberation (虑)*.
When deliberation guides action, it is called *wisdom (智)*.
Thus, the wise in nurturing life must align with the four seasons, balance joy and anger, and dwell in harmony.
Regulate yin and yang, temper firmness and softness—then perverse influences will not take root, and longevity will follow.

Therefore:
- Excessive vigilance and anxious deliberation injure the *spirit (神)*; when the spirit is injured, fear and dread become uncontrollable.
- Grief and sorrow, when excessive, exhaust and sever life.
- Excessive joy scatters the spirit, preventing its return.
- Sorrow and worry obstruct *qi*, halting its flow.
- Rage confuses and disrupts.
- Fear disperses the spirit, leaving it ungathered.

When the heart is restless with anxious thought, the *spirit (神)* is injured; the spirit injured, fear and dread overwhelm, flesh wastes, hair withers, complexion darkens—death comes in winter.
When the *spleen (脾)* is burdened by unresolved sorrow, *intent (意)* is injured; intent injured, confusion reigns, limbs fail to move, hair withers, complexion darkens—death comes in spring.
When the *liver (肝)* is moved by excessive grief, the *soul (魂)* is injured; the soul injured, madness and forgetfulness ensue, limbs contract, sides stiffen—hair withers, complexion darkens—death comes in autumn.
When the *lung (肺)* indulges boundless joy, the *vital breath (魄)* is injured; the vital breath injured, madness follows—mind departs the body, skin dries, hair withers, complexion darkens—death comes in summer.
When the *kidney (肾)* is consumed by unchecked rage, *will (志)* is injured; will injured, one forgets past words, the waist and spine lose mobility—hair withers, complexion darkens—death comes in late summer.
When fear persists unresolved, *essence (精)* is injured; essence injured, bones ache, atrophy sets in, and essence drains downward.

Thus, the five viscera store *essence*—they must not be harmed.
If harmed, they lose their guard, yin becomes deficient, and without *qi*, death follows.
Therefore, the practitioner of needling must observe the patient’s demeanor to discern the fate of *spirit, soul, vital breath, intent, and will*.
If any of these five are injured, needling cannot restore them.

The *liver (肝)* stores blood; blood houses the *soul (魂)*.
When liver *qi* is deficient, fear arises; when excessive, anger follows.
The *spleen (脾)* stores *nourishment (营)*; *nourishment* houses *intent (意)*.
When spleen *qi* is deficient, the limbs grow weak, the viscera unsettled; when excessive, the abdomen distends, the bowels stagnate.
The *heart (心)* stores *pulse (脉)*; *pulse* houses *spirit (神)*.
When heart *qi* is deficient, sorrow takes hold; when excessive, laughter is unceasing.
The *lung (肺)* stores *qi*; *qi* houses *vital breath (魄)*.
When lung *qi* is deficient, the nose is congested, breath is shallow; when excessive, wheezing and chest fullness force upward breathing.
The *kidney (肾)* stores *essence*; *essence* houses *will (志)*.
When kidney *qi* is deficient, syncope occurs; when excessive, distension arises, and the viscera grow unsettled.

One must carefully examine the diseased forms of the five viscera to discern their *qi* as deficient or replete, then adjust accordingly.

---
**Chapter 9: The Dao of Terminus and Commencement (终始第九)**

*"The art of needling is complete in its terminus and commencement.
To master terminus and commencement, the five viscera are the key—then yin and yang are defined.
Yin governs storage, yang governs transport.
Yang receives *qi* from the extremities, yin receives *qi* from the viscera.

Thus, in *draining (泻)*, one follows the *qi*’s arrival; in *tonifying (补)*, one aligns with its flow.
To know arrival and flow is to harmonize *qi*.

The method of harmonizing *qi* must unite yin and yang—the five viscera as yin, the six bowels as yang.
This tradition is passed down through bloodlines, sworn as an oath:
Respect it, and prosperity follows; neglect it, and ruin comes.
Do not act without principle, for such will bring untimely doom.

Reverently uphold the Dao of Heaven—now speak of terminus and commencement.

*Terminus and commencement* are rooted in the channels and vessels.
Hold to the *pulse (脉口)* and *Renying (人迎)*, to know yin and yang’s excess or deficiency, their balance or imbalance—thus Heaven’s Dao is complete.

The *balanced person* is without disease.
The disease-free have *pulse (脉口)* and *Renying* in harmony with the four seasons, their rise and fall in unison, their six channels unobstructed, their extremities’ cold and warmth regulated, their form, flesh, blood, and *qi* in perfect accord—this is the *balanced person*.

The *qi*-deficient have *pulse (脉口)* and *Renying* diminished, failing to meet the standard of the *cùn* and *shǐ* measurements."*

Thus, when both yin and yang are deficient, supplementing the yang will exhaust the yin, and draining the yin will deplete the yang. In such cases, one may administer mild medicinals but must avoid excessive doses.

Do not apply moxibustion here—if the condition persists, draining will only ruin the *zàng* organs’ *qi*.

When *Renying* is excessively strong once, the disease lies in the *zu* (足) *shǎo yáng* (少陽). If it is both strong and restless, the disease lies in the *shǒu* (手) *shǎo yáng*.
When *Renying* is excessively strong twice, the disease lies in the *zu* *tài yáng* (太陽). If it is both strong and restless, the disease lies in the *shǒu* *tài yáng*.
When *Renying* is excessively strong thrice, the disease lies in the *zu* *yáng míng* (陽明). If it is both strong and restless, the disease lies in the *shǒu* *yáng míng*.
When *Renying* is excessively strong four times—great and rapid—it is called *overflowing yang* (*yì yáng*), and *overflowing yang* is an *external blockage* (*wài gé*).

When the *pulse (pulse mouth, 脉口)* is excessively strong once, the disease lies in the *zu* *jué yīn* (厥陰). If it is both strong and restless, it lies in the *shǒu* *xīn zhǔ* (心主).
When the *pulse* is excessively strong twice, the disease lies in the *zu* *shǎo yīn* (少陰). If it is both strong and restless, it lies in the *shǒu* *shǎo yīn*.
When the *pulse* is excessively strong thrice, if it is both strong and restless, it lies in the *shǒu* *tài yīn* (太陰). If the pulse is both great and rapid, it is called *overflowing yin* (*yì yīn*), and *overflowing yin* with *internal blockage* (*nèi guān*) is untreatable and fatal.

When *Renying* and the *tài yīn* pulse are both excessively strong—four times or more—it is called *blockage at the pass* (*guān gé*), and such cases are given a short prognosis.

When *Renying* is excessively strong once, drain the *zu* *shǎo yáng* and supplement the *zu* *jué yīn*—two drains for every one supplement—once daily, verifying by palpation. If the *qi* is harmonized before completion, cease.

When *Renying* is excessively strong twice, drain the *zu* *tài yáng* and supplement the *zu* *shǎo yīn*—two drains for every one supplement—every other day, verifying by palpation. If the *qi* is harmonized before completion, cease.

When *Renying* is excessively strong thrice, drain the *zu* *yáng míng* and supplement the *zu* *tài yīn*—two drains for every one supplement—twice daily, verifying by palpation. If the *qi* is harmonized before completion, cease.

When the *pulse* is excessively strong once, drain the *zu* *jué yīn* and supplement the *zu* *shǎo yáng*—two supplements for every one drain—once daily, verifying by palpation. If the *qi* is harmonized before completion, cease.

When the *pulse* is excessively strong twice, drain the *zu* *shǎo yīn* and supplement the *zu* *tài yáng*—two supplements for every one drain—every other day, verifying by palpation. If the *qi* is harmonized before completion, cease.

When the *pulse* is excessively strong thrice, drain the *zu* *tài yīn* and supplement the *zu* *yáng míng*—two supplements for every one drain—twice daily, verifying by palpation. If the *qi* is harmonized before completion, cease. This is why it is taken twice daily: the *tài yáng* governs the stomach, which is rich in *gǔ qì* (谷气), hence it may be taken twice daily.

When *Renying* and the *pulse* are both excessively strong—three times or more—it is called *both yin and yang overflowing*. In such cases, if not treated, the blood vessels will become obstructed, *qi* will have nowhere to flow, and it will stagnate internally, injuring the *zàng* organs.

If moxibustion is applied here, the condition will transform into another disease.

In acupuncture, when the *qi* is balanced, cease. Supplementing yin and draining yang clarifies the *qi*—hearing and vision sharpen. If this is reversed, blood and *qi* will not circulate.

What is meant by *qi* arriving and taking effect: draining will worsen deficiency. Deficiency is when the pulse is large as before but not firm—if it remains as before but lacks firmness, though it may seem unchanged, the disease persists.

Supplementing will strengthen solidity. Solidity is when the pulse is large as before but more firm—if it remains as before but is not firm, though it may seem resolved, the disease persists.

Thus, supplementing strengthens, draining weakens. Though pain may not follow the needle’s withdrawal, the disease will inevitably decline.

One must first master the diseases arising from the twelve channels before attaining proficiency in *terminus and commencement*.

Thus, yin and yang must not be displaced, and deficiency and excess must not be inverted—treat according to the channel.

In acupuncture, three insertions reach the *gǔ qì*. If the pathogenic *qi* is erratic and improperly combined, yin and yang will shift positions, and the sequence of treatment will be reversed. If the needle is applied too deeply or shallowly, or if the timing is incorrect, the *qi* will stagnate and overflow, requiring the needle to remove it. Hence, the first insertion expels yang pathogens, the second expels yin pathogens, and the third reaches the *gǔ qì*—when *gǔ qì* arrives, cease.

When *gǔ qì* arrives, it is known that supplementation has solidified and draining has induced deficiency. If only the pathogenic *qi* departs while yin and yang remain unbalanced, the disease may seem to have resolved.

Thus, supplementing strengthens, draining weakens. Though pain may not follow the needle’s withdrawal, the disease will inevitably decline.

When yin is excessive and yang is deficient, first supplement the yang, then drain the yin to harmonize them.
When yin is deficient and yang is excessive, first supplement the yin, then drain the yang to harmonize them.

If the three pulses move between the *zu* *dà zhǐ* (大指), examine their deficiency or excess. If deficient, drain them—this is called *compounding deficiency*, which will worsen the disease.

In treating these cases, press with the fingers: if the pulse is rapid and firm, drain it quickly. If it is slow and weak, supplement it. If this is reversed, the disease will worsen.

Their movement: *yáng míng* is above, *jué yīn* is in the middle, and *shǎo yīn* is below.
If the chest is hollow and the back is hollow, the shoulders are deficient—take from above.

For *double tongue* (重舌), pierce the *tongue pillar* (舌柱) with a *bì* needle (铍针).

If the hand cannot extend but only flexes, the disease lies in the *sinews*.
If the hand cannot flex but only extends, the disease lies in the *bones*.
For bone disorders, treat the bones; for sinew disorders, treat the sinews.

When supplementing, take from a solid region deeply, pressing the wound lightly to fully expel the pathogenic *qi*.
When treating a deficient region, insert shallowly to nourish the pulse, pressing firmly to prevent pathogenic *qi* from entering.

When pathogenic *qi* arrives, it is tense and rapid; when *gǔ qì* arrives, it is slow and harmonious.

For a solid pulse, insert deeply to release the *qi*.
For a deficient pulse, insert shallowly to prevent essence-*qi* from escaping, expelling only the pathogenic *qi*.

When needling any painful region, the pulse will always be solid.
Thus it is said: For ailments arising above the waist, both the **Hand Taiyin** and **Hand Yangming** channels govern them; for ailments below the waist, both the **Foot Taiyin** and **Foot Yangming** channels govern them.

When disease originates above, treat below; when disease originates below, treat above. For headaches, treat the feet; for waist pain, treat the buttocks.

Diseases arising in the head cause heaviness in the head; those arising in the hands cause heaviness in the arms; those arising in the feet cause heaviness in the feet.
In treating disease, first needle the region where the ailment first manifested.

Spring *qi* resides in the hair, summer *qi* in the skin, autumn *qi* in the muscles, and winter *qi* in the sinews and bones. When treating these diseases, adjust the needle depth according to the season.
Thus, for obese patients, use the depth of **autumn-winter**; for emaciated patients, use the depth of **spring-summer**.

Pain is *yin*; when pressing a painful area with the hand and it cannot be pressed, it is *yin*—needle deeply.
Diseases above are *yang*; diseases below are *yin*. Itching is *yang*—needle shallowly.

If disease first arises in *yin*, treat the *yin* first, then the *yang*; if it first arises in *yang*, treat the *yang* first, then the *yin*.

When needling **hot reversal** (*re* syndrome), retaining the needle will instead induce cold; when needling **cold reversal**, retaining the needle will instead induce heat.
For hot reversal, use **two *yin* and one *yang*** [needle]; for cold reversal, use **two *yang* and one *yin*** [needle].
By "two *yin*," it means two needles in *yin* points; by "one *yang*," it means one needle in a *yang* point.

For chronic illnesses, pathogenic *qi* penetrates deeply. When treating such diseases, insert deeply and retain the needle for a long time, repeating daily until the patient’s left and right sides are balanced, the blood vessels are cleared, and the needling is complete.

In all needling, one must first observe the patient’s **form and *qi***.
If the flesh is not yet wasted, the breath is weak, and the pulse is restless—this is **turbulent reversal**—needling must be precise: scattered *qi* can be gathered, and concentrated *qi* can be dispersed.

Reside in quiet seclusion, focus on the movement of the spirit, close doors and windows so the soul and spirit do not scatter, concentrate on a single thought, and let the **refined *qi*** circulate. Avoid human voices to preserve the essence; unify the spirit, directing the will toward the needle. Needle shallowly and retain, lightly and superficially, to shift the spirit. Only rest when *qi* arrives.

For males, needle inward; for females, needle outward. Firmly resist without withdrawing, carefully guard without inserting—this is called **obtaining the *qi***.

The prohibitions of needling are as follows:
Do not needle after recent intercourse, nor have intercourse after needling;
Do not needle when drunk, nor drink after needling;
Do not needle when angry, nor become angry after needling;
Do not needle after exertion, nor exert oneself after needling;
Do not needle after eating, nor eat after needling;
Do not needle when hungry, nor go hungry after needling;
Do not needle when thirsty, nor drink after needling;
After great shock or fear, first stabilize the *qi*, then needle.

For those arriving by carriage, let them rest outside before needling, as if after a meal.
For those arriving on foot, let them sit and rest, as if after walking ten *li*.

These twelve prohibitions: if violated, the pulse becomes disordered, *qi* scatters, the **camp and defense** are disrupted, and the **channel *qi*** flows irregularly. Needling under these conditions will cause *yang* diseases to enter *yin*, and *yin* diseases to manifest as *yang*, allowing pathogenic *qi* to re-emerge. A careless practitioner fails to observe these, thus **harming the body**, causing excessive dissipation of the **essence and fluids**, and failing to harmonize the **Five Flavors**—this is called **losing the *qi***.

The **Taiyang** channel’s terminal signs: the eyes are covered, the gaze reverses, moles or freckles appear, the skin turns white, sweating ceases, and when sweating ceases, death follows.

The **Shaoyang** channel’s terminal signs: deafness, all joints relax excessively, the **eye system** is severed. When the eye system is severed, death follows within one and a half days. At death, the complexion turns **green-white**.

The **Yangming** channel’s terminal signs: the mouth and eyes move uncontrollably, the patient is prone to startling, speaks incoherently, and turns yellow. When the **upper and lower channels** are blocked and *qi* cannot flow, death follows.

The **Shaoyin** channel’s terminal signs: the face darkens, teeth grow long and become filthy, the abdomen swells and becomes obstructed, and both upward and downward passage ceases before death.

The **Jueyin** channel’s terminal signs: internal heat, dry throat, frequent urination, restlessness, and in severe cases, the tongue curls upward like a coiled egg before death.

The **Taiyin** channel’s terminal signs: abdominal distension and obstruction, inability to breathe, frequent belching and vomiting. If vomiting occurs, the face turns red; if not, the upward and downward passage is blocked, the face turns black, the skin and hair wither, and death follows.

Leigong asked the Yellow Emperor, saying: *"The teachings on the **prohibited pulses**, the principles of acupuncture—beginning with the **channel pathways**, tracing their courses, measuring their extent—how they connect internally to the five **viscera** and externally to the six **bowels**, I wish to hear the full **Dao** of this.*

The Yellow Emperor replied: *When a person first takes form, **essence** is formed first. From **essence**, the brain and marrow arise; bones form the **framework**, **channels** circulate the **vital substances**, tendons provide **strength**, flesh forms the **barrier**, and skin and hair harden and lengthen. When grain enters the stomach, the **channel pathways** open, and **blood-qi** flows.*

Leigong said: *"I wish to hear fully of the **channels’** origins."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"The **channels** are what enable life and death, govern a hundred ailments, and balance excess and deficiency—they must not be obstructed.

**The Lung (Hand-Taiyin) Channel** arises from the **middle burner**, descends to network with the **large intestine**, ascends along the stomach’s orifice, passes the diaphragm to belong to the lungs, then from the lungs’ root emerges beneath the armpit, descends along the **inner arm**, traversing before the **Heart (Hand-Shaoyin) Channel’s** pathway, enters the **cubital fossa**, follows the **ulnar side of the forearm**, passes beneath the **radial bone**, enters the **wrist’s radial pulse position**, ascends to the **fish** (intersection), follows the **fish’s crease**, and exits at the **tip of the thumb**.

When this channel is disturbed, the **lung** becomes distended and full, with a **swollen, labored breathing and cough**, pain in the **suprasternal fossa**, and in severe cases, the hands clasp as if in **convulsion**—this is **arm tetany**. It governs diseases of the **lung**: **cough**, upward breathlessness, thirst, **chest fullness**, **pain along the inner arm**, **convulsive coldness in the hand**, and **palm heat**.

When **qi** is excessive, there is **shoulder and back pain**, **wind-cold**, **sweating**, **frequent urination**, and **yawns**. When **qi** is deficient, there is **shoulder and back coldness**, **shortness of breath**, and **urine color changes**. For these ailments: if excessive, **bleed it**; if deficient, **supplement it**; if hot, **rapidly**; if cold, **retain the needle**; if **sunken and weak**, **moxibustion**; if neither excessive nor deficient, **follow the channel’s pathway**.

When **qi** is excessive, the **front of the body is hot**; if excessive in the **stomach**, there is **rapid digestion and hunger**, and **yellow urine**. When **qi** is deficient, the **front of the body is cold**; if the **stomach is cold**, there is **distension and fullness**. For these ailments: if excessive, **bleed it**; if deficient, **supplement it**; if hot, **rapidly**; if cold, **retain the needle**; if **sunken and weak**, **moxibustion**; if neither excessive nor deficient, **follow the channel’s pathway**.

These are diseases arising from **qi imbalance**, including **profuse sweating, pain at the outer canthus, cheek pain, and pain along the posterior ear, shoulder, upper arm, elbow, and outer forearm**, rendering the **second and third fingers useless**.

For these ailments, if the channel is **excess**, **bleed it**; if **deficient**, **tonify it**; if **hot**, **move it rapidly**; if **cold**, **retain the needle**; if **sunken**, **moxibust**. When neither excess nor deficient, **select points along the channel**. Excess is indicated when **Rén Yíng** pulses **twice as large as Cùn Kǒu**; deficiency when **Rén Yíng is smaller than Cùn Kǒu**.

The **Foot Shàoyang (Gallbladder) channel** originates at the **outer canthus**, ascends to the **temporal angle**, descends behind the ear, follows the neck **anterior to the Hand Shàoyang channel**, reaches the shoulder, then **crosses posterior to the Hand Shàoyang**, entering the **suprasternal fossa**. Its branch enters the ear from behind, exits forward, and reaches the **outer canthus**. Another branch diverges from the canthus, descends to **Dà Yíng**, converges with the **Hand Shàoyang**, reaches **Shùn**, descends to **Jiè Chē**, then follows the neck to merge below the **suprasternal fossa** in the chest, piercing the **diaphragm**, connecting to the **liver**, and belonging to the **gallbladder**. It courses along the **ribcage**, exits at **Qì Jiē**, encircles the **pubic hairline**, and horizontally enters the **□ Yàn** (missing character). Its direct path descends from the **suprasternal fossa** through the armpit, follows the chest, passes the **lower ribs**, and descends to merge in the **□ Yàn**, then follows the **□ Yáng**, exiting the **outer knee**, descending anterior to the **fibular head**, reaching the **end of Jué Gǔ**, exiting anterior to the **external malleolus**, ascending the **dorsum of the foot**, and entering between the **fourth and fifth toes**.

If the **Hand Tàiyīn (Lung) channel’s qi is severed**, the **skin and hair wither**, for the **Tàiyīn** **warms the skin and hair with qi**. Thus, if qi fails to nourish, the **skin and hair wither**, and **fluids depart from the joints**, causing **brittle nails and hair breakage**. Hair breakage means **hair dies first**, and by **Ding (4th Heavenly Stem)**, death follows—**Fire overcomes Metal**.

If the **Hand Shàoyīn (Heart) channel’s qi is severed**, the **pulse does not flow**, and **blood does not circulate**, leading to **dull complexion**. Thus, if the face turns **black like lacquered wood**, **blood dies first**, and by **Gǔi (10th Heavenly Stem)**, death follows—**Water overcomes Fire**.

If the **Foot Tàiyīn (Spleen) channel’s qi is severed**, the **pulse fails to nourish the muscles**, for the **tongue is the root of the muscles**. If the pulse does not nourish, the **muscles soften**, causing **tongue atrophy and sublingual fullness**, leading to **inverted lips**. Inverted lips mean **muscle dies first**, and by **Yǐ (2nd Heavenly Stem)**, death follows—**Wood overcomes Earth**.

If the **Foot Shàoyīn (Kidney) channel’s qi is severed**, the **bones wither**, for the **Shàoyīn** is the **winter pulse**, **deep and moistening the marrow**. Thus, if the bones are not moistened, **flesh cannot adhere**, causing **soft, receding flesh**, **prolonged teeth with plaque**, and **dull hair**. Dull hair means **bone dies first**, and by **Jǐ (6th Heavenly Stem)**, death follows—**Earth overcomes Water**.

If the **Foot Jièyīn (Liver) channel’s qi is severed**, the **tendons are severed**, for the **Jièyīn** is the **liver pulse**, and the **liver governs the tendons**. Tendons gather at **Yīn qi**, and their vessels connect to the **root of the tongue**. Thus, if the pulse does not nourish, the **tendons contract**, drawing the **tongue and testicles upward**, causing **blue lips, curled tongue, and retracted testicles**. This means **tendons die first**, and by **Xīn (8th Heavenly Stem)**, death follows—**Metal overcomes Wood**.

If the **five Yin channels’ qi are all severed**, the **eye system rotates**, causing **eye movement**, and **mind (zhì) dies first**. If mind dies first, death follows **within half a day**.

If the **six Yang channels’ qi are severed**, the **Yin separates from the intestines**, causing **uncontrolled elimination and diarrhea**. When qi is severed, **profuse sweating occurs**, so if diagnosed in the **morning, death comes by evening**; if diagnosed in the **evening, death comes the next day**.

The **twelve regular channels** run **deep between the muscles**, unseen.

The **regular channels** that are commonly visible are those of the **Foot Taiyin** extending above the ankle, where they have no place to conceal themselves.

All **floating pulses** that are constantly visible belong to the **collateral vessels**. The **great collaterals** of the **Six Meridians**—**Hand Yangming** and **Hand Shaoyang**—arise between the fingers and ascend to join the elbow’s center.

Those who drink alcohol have their **defensive qi** first circulating through the skin, filling the **collaterals** first. When the **collaterals** are full, the **defensive qi** has already balanced, and the **nutritive qi** then fills the **regular channels**, making them greatly prominent.

When a **pulse suddenly moves**, it is due to **pathogenic qi** residing there, lingering at its origin or extremity. If it does not move, there is **heat**; if it is not firm, it will sink and become hollow, differing from the norm—thus one knows which **pulse is affected**.

**Leigong** asked: *"How do we distinguish between the **regular channels** and the **collaterals**?"*
The **Yellow Emperor** replied: *"The **regular channels** are normally unseen. Their fullness or emptiness is known through the **guqi** (wrist pulse). All visible pulses are **collaterals**."*

**Leigong** said: *"Your words are unclear. Explain further."*
The **Yellow Emperor** replied: *"All **collaterals** cannot traverse major joints. They must follow indirect paths to emerge, then re-enter and merge within the skin. Their junctions are visible externally. Thus, when puncturing **collaterals**, one must strike above their knots. If blood is profuse even without knots, quickly drain it to expel the pathogenic influence and release the blood—otherwise, it will linger and cause **bi syndrome** (obstruction).

When diagnosing **collaterals**, if the pulse is **green**, there is **cold and pain**; if **red**, there is **heat**. If the **stomach is cold**, the **collaterals of the Hand Yu** (Little Finger) will appear **green**; if the **stomach has heat**, the **collaterals of the Hand Yu** will be **red**. If they turn **violently black**, it indicates **prolonged obstruction**. If they show **red, black, and green**, it is **cold and heat qi**. If they are **short and green**, it signifies **weak qi**.

When treating **cold and heat**, the **collaterals** will be blood-rich. One must ask the patient to **inhale deeply** before puncturing, draining until the blood is exhausted, then adjusting the **fullness or emptiness**. If the **collateral is small and short**, the **qi is weak**; if drained excessively, the patient will feel **oppressed**. If asked to inhale deeply, they may faint and be unable to speak. If they feel **oppressed**, have them sit upright immediately.

The **branch of Hand Taiyin** is called **Lieque**, arising above the wrist between the tendons, running parallel to the **Taiyin channel** into the palm, then dispersing into the **Yuji** (Little Finger) region. If **full**, the hand is **sharp and hot**; if **empty**, there is **yawns and sighs**, frequent **urination**, and **enuresis**. Puncture it **half an inch from the wrist**, where it diverges toward **Yangming**.

The **branch of Hand Shaoyin** is called **Tongli**, located **one and a half inches from the wrist**, diverging upward along the channel into the **heart**, connecting to the **root of the tongue** and the **eye system**. If **full**, it causes **chest oppression**; if **empty**, speech is **impaired**. Puncture it **one inch behind the palm**, where it diverges toward **Taiyang**.

The **branch of Hand Jinxin** (Pericardium) is called **Neiguan**, located **two inches from the wrist**, emerging between the two tendons, ascending along the channel to strike the **heart wrapper**, connecting to the **heart system**. If **full**, there is **heart pain**; if **empty**, **stiff neck**. Puncture it between the two tendons.

The **branch of Hand Taiyang** is called **Zhizheng**, located **five inches above the wrist**, internally connecting to **Shaoyin**. Its divergence ascends to the **elbow**, collateraling the **shoulder joint**. If **full**, the **joints slacken and the elbow is impaired**; if **empty**, **warts** form—small ones like **finger scabs or scabies**. Puncture it at its divergence.

The **branch of Hand Yangming** is called **Pianli**, located **three inches from the wrist**, diverging into **Taiyin**. Its divergence ascends along the arm, passing the **shoulder joint**, curving to the **cheek and side teeth**; another divergence enters the **ear**, merging with the **master vessel**. If **full**, there is **tooth decay and deafness**; if **empty**, **tooth cold, obstruction, and numbness**. Puncture it at its divergence.

The **branch of Hand Shaoyang** is called **Waiguan**, located **two inches from the wrist**, wrapping externally around the arm, entering the **chest**, and merging with **Jinxin**. If **full**, the **elbow contracts**; if **empty**, it **does not flex**. Puncture it at its divergence.

The **branch of Foot Taiyang** is called **Feiyang**, located **seven inches from the ankle**, diverging toward **Shaoyin**. If **full**, there is **sighing, suffocation, and head/back pain**; if **empty**, **yawns and sighs**. Puncture it at its divergence.

The **branch of Foot Shaoyang** is called **Guangming**, located **five inches from the ankle**, diverging toward **Jueyin**, descending to collateral the **foot**. If **full**, there is **syncope**; if **empty**, **flaccidity and weakness**, making it difficult to rise while seated. Puncture it at its divergence.

The **branch of Foot Yangming** is called **Fenglong**, located **eight inches from the ankle**, diverging toward **Taiyin**. Its divergence follows the **outer edge of the shinbone**, ascending to collateral the **head and nape**, merging with the **qi of all channels**, descending to collateral the **throat**. If **qi reverses**, there is **throat obstruction and emaciation**; if **full**, **mania and epilepsy**; if **empty**, **foot paralysis and channel exhaustion**. Puncture it at its divergence.

The **branch of Foot Taiyin** is called **Gongsun**, located **one inch behind the base joint**, diverging toward **Yangming**. Its divergence enters to collateral the **intestines and stomach**. If **Jue qi reverses**, there is **acute diarrhea**; if **full**, **sharp intestinal pain**; if **empty**, **distension and bloating**. Puncture it at its divergence.

The **branch of Foot Shaoyin** is called **Dazhong**, located behind the **ankle**, wrapping around the **heel**, diverging toward **Taiyang**. Its divergence ascends along the channel to the **heart wrapper**, descending externally through the **lumbar and spine**. If **qi reverses**, there is **restlessness and oppression**; if **full**, **constipation**; if **empty**, **lumbar pain**. Puncture it at its divergence.

The **branch of Foot Jueyin** is called **Ligou**, located **five inches from the inner ankle**, diverging toward **Shaoyang**. Its divergence ascends directly along the channel to the **testicles**, knotting at the **penis**. If **qi reverses**, there is **sudden testicular swelling and hernia**; if **full**, **erection**; if **empty**, **sudden itching**. Puncture it at its divergence.

The **branch of the Conception Vessel** is called **Weiyi**, descending from the **coccyx**, dispersing into the **abdomen**. If **full**, there is **abdominal skin pain**; if **empty**, **itching and scratching**. Puncture it at its divergence.

The **branch of the Governing Vessel** is called **Changqiang**, flanking the **loins**, ascending the **nape**, dispersing over the **head**, descending to the **shoulder blades**, diverging toward **Taiyang**, and penetrating the **loins**. If **full**, the **back stiffens**; if **empty**, the **head feels heavy**. If the patient **shakes their head high**, or if there is **excessive pressure on the spine**, puncture it at its divergence.

The **Spleen’s great collateral**, named **Dàbāo**, emerges three *cùn* below the **Yuānyè armpit**, spreading across the **chest and ribs**. When **full**, the entire body aches; when **empty**, all joints relax excessively. These **collaterals**—like the **networking blood** of the Spleen—are all punctured at the **Spleen’s great collateral**.

In general, these **fifteen collaterals**: when **full**, their symptoms manifest visibly; when **empty**, they descend. If unseen, seek them **above and below**—for **primary channels** and **collateral divergences** differ in their paths.

The Yellow Emperor asked Qībó: "I have heard that when humans align with the Dao of Heaven, internally they have the five **Zàng** (internal organs), corresponding to the five tones, five colors, five seasons, five flavors, and five positions; externally they have the six **Fǔ** (external organs), corresponding to the six **Lǜ** (musical pitches). The six **Lǜ** establish the **primary channels** of **Yīn** and **Yáng**, harmonizing with the twelve months, twelve **shén** (earthly branches), twelve **jié** (solar terms), twelve **jīngshuǐ** (channel waters), and twelve times. The twelve **primary channels** are the source of life, the origin of illness, the means of healing, the cause of disease, the beginning of study, and the end of skill—easy for the coarse, difficult for the refined.

Please explain their **separation and convergence**, their **entering and exiting**?

Qībó bowed twice with his head to the ground and said: "How clear is your question! This is what the coarse overlook and the refined pause upon. Let me now complete my explanation.

The **primary channel** of the **Foot Tàiyáng** (Large Intestine) diverges and enters the **wèi** (popliteal region). One branch descends five *cùn* below the **shī** (perineum), diverges and enters the **gāng** (anus), connects with the **Pángguāng** (Bladder), and disperses through the **shèn** (kidneys). It follows the **chénchén** (lateral thoracic vessels) to the heart and disperses there. The direct path rises from the **chénchén**, exits at the **jǐng** (nape), and reconnects with the **Foot Tàiyáng**—this completes one **primary channel**.

The **primary channel** of the **Foot Shàoyīn** (Kidney) reaches the **wèi**, then diverges and converges with the **Foot Tàiyáng**. It ascends to the **shèn**, at the **shí-sì qīng** (14th vertebra), exits and connects with the **Dàimài** (Girdle Vessel). The direct path binds to the **shēnběn** (root of the tongue), then exits at the **jǐng**, converging with the **Foot Tàiyáng**—this completes one **convergence**.

All divergences of the **Yīn** channels are their **primary channels**.

The **primary channel** of the **Foot Shàoyáng** (Gallbladder) ascends to the **yán** (axillary hairline), enters between the **jìxià** (flanks), follows the chest, connects with the **dǎn** (Gallbladder), and disperses through the **shànggān** (upper liver) to the heart. It then ascends, clasping the **yàn** (pharynx), exits at the **yíèrìngzhōng** (mid-cheek), disperses across the face, and binds to the **mùjìng** (eyelid tendons), converging with the **Foot Shàoyáng** at the **wàipì** (external armpit).

The **primary channel** of the **Foot Juéyīn** (Liver) diverges at the **kē** (upper thigh), ascends to the **máojì** (hairline), and converges with the **Foot Shàoyáng**, traveling alongside its divergence—this completes the second **convergence**.

The **primary channel** of the **Foot Yángmíng** (Stomach) ascends to the **yán**, enters the **fùlǐ** (abdominal cavity), and connects with the **wèi** (Stomach). It disperses through the **pí** (Spleen), ascends to the heart, follows the **yàn** to the mouth, and then proceeds upward along the **shùn** (esophagus), returning to bind the **mùjìng**, converging with the **Foot Yángmíng**.

The **primary channel** of the **Foot Tàiyīn** (Spleen) ascends to the **yán**, converging with the **Foot Yángmíng**, and travels alongside its divergence, ascending to bind at the **yàn**, piercing through the **shějīngzhōng** (tongue)—this completes the third **convergence**.

The **primary channel** of the **Hand Tàiyáng** (Small Intestine) points downward to the earth, diverges at the **jiāngè** (shoulder joint), enters the **yè** (axilla), and follows the heart, striking the **xiǎochángjiǎng** (Small Intestine).

The **primary channel** of the **Hand Shàoyīn** (Heart) diverges and enters between the **yuān yè** (two axillary tendons), connecting with the heart, ascending to the **hóulǎng** (throat), and exiting at the face, converging with the **mùnèipì** (inner eyelid)—this completes the fourth **convergence**.

The **primary channel** of the **Hand Shàoyáng** (San Jiao/Triple Burner) points upward to the sky, diverges at the **diān** (vertex), enters the **quēpén** (suprasternal fossa), descends to follow the **Sānjiāo** (Triple Burner), and disperses through the chest.

The **primary channel** of the **Hand Xīnmài** (Pericardium) diverges and descends three *cùn* below the **yuān yè**, entering the chest, diverging to connect with the **Sānjiāo**, exiting along the **hóulǎng**, exiting behind the ear, and converging with the **Hand Shàoyáng** below the **wángǔ** (outer canthus)—this completes the fifth **convergence**.

The **primary channel** of the **Hand Yángmíng** (Large Intestine) follows the hand upward along the **yīngrǔ** (chest), diverges at the **jiānguā** (shoulder), enters below the **zhùgǔ** (vertebral column), follows the **dàcháng** (Large Intestine), and connects with the **fèi** (Lung). It ascends along the **hóulǎng**, exits at the **quēpén**, and converges with the **Hand Yángmíng**.

The **primary channel** of the **Hand Tàiyīn** (Lung) diverges and enters before the **yuān yè** of the **Hand Shàoyīn**, follows the **fèi** (Lung), and disperses through the **Hand Tàiyáng** above, exiting at the **quēpén**, ascending along the **hóulǎng**, and reconverging with the **Hand Yángmíng**—this completes the sixth **convergence**.

**Chapter Twelve: The Twelve Channels and Their Waters**

The Yellow Emperor asked Qìbó, saying:
*"The twelve channels, externally corresponding to the twelve channel-waters and internally connecting to the five viscera and six bowels—though their size, depth, breadth, and distance differ, and though the five viscera and six bowels vary in height, size, and capacity for receiving nourishment, how do they harmonize in correspondence?"*

Now, the channel-waters receive water and distribute it; the five viscera store the vital *qi*, spirit, soul, and will; the six bowels receive nourishment and transmit it, receiving *qi* to elevate it; and the channels receive blood to nourish it. How then should they be regulated in unison? What are the depths for acupuncture and the number of moxibustion applications?

Qìbó replied:
*"Excellent question! Heaven is supremely high, beyond measure; Earth is supremely vast, beyond reckoning. This is what is meant. Moreover, man is born between Heaven and Earth, within the six extremes—this is Heaven’s height and Earth’s breadth, beyond mortal capacity to fathom or attain.*

*Now, take a man of eight *chǐ* in stature: his flesh and skin are tangible, measurable by touch and sight. Upon death, his viscera can be dissected to observe their firmness or fragility, the size of his bowels, the quantity of nourishment received, the length of his channels, the clarity of his blood, the abundance of his *qi*—whether the twelve channels have more blood and less *qi*, or less blood and more *qi*, or whether they are uniformly abundant or uniformly deficient—all follow a fixed principle. When treating with needles and moxa, one must adjust the channel-*qi* accordingly. Is this not the constant harmony?"*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"I have heard this with delight, yet my understanding remains unclear. I wish to hear it fully."*

Qìbó answered:
*"This is how man aligns with Heaven and Earth, responding to yin and yang—it must be carefully examined.*

*The Foot Tàiyáng externally corresponds to **Qīngshuǐ** (Clear Water) and internally connects to the **pángguāng** (Bladder), through which the waterways flow. The Foot Shàoyáng corresponds to **Wèishuǐ** (Wei Water) and connects to the **dǎn** (Gallbladder). The Foot Yángmíng corresponds to **Hǎishuǐ** (Sea Water) and connects to the **wèi** (Stomach). The Foot Tàiyīn corresponds to **Húshuǐ** (Lake Water) and connects to the **pí** (Spleen). The Foot Shàoyīn corresponds to **Rǔshuǐ** (Ru Water) and connects to the **shèn** (Kidney). The Foot Juéyīn corresponds to **Miánshuǐ** (Mian Water) and connects to the **gān** (Liver).*

*The Hand Tàiyáng corresponds to **Huáishuǐ** (Huai Water) and connects to the **xiǎocháng** (Small Intestine), from which the waterways emerge. The Hand Shàoyáng corresponds to **Luòshuǐ** (Luo Water) and connects to the **sānjiāo** (Triple Burner). The Hand Yángmíng corresponds to **Jiāngshuǐ** (River Water) and connects to the **dàcháng** (Large Intestine). The Hand Tàiyīn corresponds to **Héshuǐ** (He Water) and connects to the **fèi** (Lung). The Hand Shàoyīn corresponds to **Jìshuǐ** (Ji Water) and connects to the **xīn** (Heart). The Hand Jīnmǎo corresponds to **Zhāngshuǐ** (Zhang Water) and connects to the **xīnbāo** (Pericardium).*

*Thus, these five viscera and six bowels, with their twelve channel-waters, have external sources and internal origins, all internally and externally interconnected like an unbroken ring. The same applies to the channels themselves.*

*Heaven is yang, Earth is yin; above the waist is Heaven, below the waist is Earth. Therefore, north of the Sea is yin; north of the Lake is yin within yin. South of the Zhang is yang; north of the He to the Zhang is yin within yang. South of the Luo to the River is the extreme yang. This is but one corner of yin and yang—how man aligns with Heaven and Earth."*

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"The channel-waters correspond to the channels in terms of distance, depth, and the abundance of water and blood—how should they be treated with acupuncture?"*

Qìbó replied:
*"The Foot Yángmíng is the sea of the five viscera and six bowels. Its channel is large, its blood abundant, its *qi* vigorous and hot. To treat it, the needle must penetrate deeply to disperse stagnation, yet must not linger to deplete it. The depth for Foot Yángmíng is six *fēn*, with retention for ten breaths. For Foot Tàiyáng, five *fēn*, seven breaths. For Foot Shàoyáng, four *fēn*, five breaths. For Foot Tàiyīn, three *fēn*, four breaths. For Foot Shàoyīn, two *fēn*, three breaths. For Foot Juéyīn, one *fēn*, two breaths.*

*For the Hand channels—both yin and yang—they receive *qi* swiftly and their *qi* arrives quickly. The needle depth must not exceed two *fēn*, and retention must not exceed one breath. Adjustments for variations in length, size, fatness, or thinness should follow the principle of *fǎ tiān zhī cháng* (conforming to Heaven’s constant). The same applies to moxibustion. Exceeding these measures invites the *èhuǒ* (malevolent fire), causing bones to wither and channels to stiffen; over-penetration with needles risks *tuōqì* (depleting *qi*)."*

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"Can the size of the channels, the abundance of blood, the thickness of the skin, the firmness of the flesh, and the size of the viscera be measured?"*

Qìbó replied:
*"What can be measured should be taken from the average. Do not excessively strip flesh while ensuring blood and *qi* remain unweakened. But for those who are emaciated, withering, and lacking flesh—how can one measure and puncture them? Instead, carefully palpate, press, and probe, observing their coldness, warmth, excess, or deficiency, and adjust accordingly. This is the true method of *yīnshì ér wéizhēn* (adapting to circumstances)."*

**Chapter 14: Bone Measurements (骨度第十四)**

The Yellow Emperor asked **Bó Gāo** (伯高):
*"When measuring the length of the meridians based on pulse locations, how is this determined?"*

**Bó Gāo** replied:
*"First, measure the size, breadth, length, and shortness of the bones and joints, and then the meridian measurements will be established."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"I wish to hear the standard measurements for an average person. For someone seven *chi* and five *cùn* tall, what are the dimensions of their bones and joints?"*

**Bó Gāo** replied:
*"The circumference of the head’s largest bone is two *chi* and six *cùn*.
The chest circumference is four *chi* and five *cùn*.
The waist circumference is four *chi* and two *cùn*.

From the hairline to the nape of the neck is one *chi* and two *cùn*.
From the hairline to the chin is one *chi*.
A noble man’s hairline reaches the crown.

From the larynx to the suprasternal notch is four *cùn*.
From the suprasternal notch to the [diaphragmatic] region is nine *cùn*—if this exceeds, the lungs are enlarged; if insufficient, the lungs are small.

From the [diaphragmatic] region to the navel is eight *cùn*—if this exceeds, the stomach is enlarged; if insufficient, the stomach is small.

From the navel to the pubic bone is six *cùn* and five *fēn*.
The pubic bone is six *cùn* and five *fēn* in length.
From the upper edge of the pubic bone to the upper edge of the inner ankle is one *chi* and eight *cùn*.
From the upper edge of the inner ankle to its lower edge is three *cùn* and five *fēn*.
From the lower edge of the inner ankle to the ground is three *cùn*.
From the back of the knee to the popliteal fossa is one *chi* and six *cùn*.
From the popliteal fossa to the ground is three *cùn*.
Thus, if the bone circumference is large, it is excessive; if small, it is insufficient.

From the occipital bone to the spine is one *chi*.
The length from the armpit to where the arm is hidden is four *cùn*.
From the armpit to the lower ribs is one *chi* and two *cùn*.
From the lower ribs to the [lumbar] region is six *cùn*.
From the [lumbar] region to the knee is one *chi* and nine *cùn*.
From the knee to the outer ankle is one *chi* and six *cùn*.
From the outer ankle to the *jīnggǔ* bone is three *cùn*.
From the *jīnggǔ* bone to the ground is one *cùn*.

Behind the ear, at the *wán* bone, the breadth is nine *cùn*.
In front of the ear, at the ear gate, the breadth is one *chi* and three *cùn*.
The distance between the two cheeks is seven *cùn*.
The breadth between the two nipples is nine *cùn* and five *fēn*.
The breadth between the two [armpits] is six *cùn* and five *fēn*.

The foot is one *chi* and two *cùn* long, four *cùn* and five *fēn* wide.
From the shoulder to the elbow is one *chi* and seven *cùn*.
From the elbow to the wrist is one *chi* and two *cùn* and five *fēn*.
From the wrist to the base of the middle finger is four *cùn*.
From the base of the finger to its tip is four *cùn* and five *fēn*.

From the hairline to the spine is two *cùn* and five *fēn*.
From the lumbar vertebrae to the coccyx, spanning twenty-one vertebrae, is three *chi*.
The uppermost vertebra is one *cùn* and four *fēn* and one *lì* in length, with the odd division below.
Thus, from the seventh vertebra to the lumbar region is nine *cùn* and seven *fēn* and seven *lì*.
These are the standard bone measurements of an average person, by which the lengths of the meridians are established.

Therefore, when observing the meridians on the body:
If they appear **floating and firm**, or **bright and large**, they indicate **abundant blood**.
If they are **fine and deep**, they indicate **abundant qi**.

**Chapter 15: The Fifty Circulations (五十营第十五)**

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"I wish to hear about the fifty circulations—how are they arranged?"*

Qi Bao replied:
*"The heavens encompass the Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions, each divided into thirty-six portions. Human qi completes one full circuit in eighteen hundredths of a portion. The sun traverses the Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions, while the human meridians—twenty-eight in number—ascend, descend, branch left and right, and extend front and back. They encircle the body over sixteen *zhàng* and two *chǐ*, corresponding to the Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions. The water clock measures a hundred *kè*, dividing day and night.

Thus, with each inhalation, the pulse moves twice, and qi travels three *cùn*. With each exhalation, the pulse moves twice again, and qi travels another three *cùn*. When breath settles, qi travels six *cùn*. In ten breaths, qi travels six *chǐ*; in a day, it travels two *fēn*. In two hundred seventy breaths, qi travels sixteen *zhàng* and two *chǐ*, completing one full circuit through the body. The water clock descends two *kè*, and the day progresses twenty-five *fēn*.

In five hundred forty breaths, qi completes two full circuits, the water clock descends four *kè*, and the day advances forty *fēn*. In two thousand seven hundred breaths, qi circulates ten times, the water clock descends twenty *kè*, and the day reaches five *xiū* and twenty *fēn*. In thirteen thousand five hundred breaths, qi completes fifty circulations, the water clock descends a hundred *kè*, and the day spans the Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions, exhausting the water clock’s flow. The pulse then terminates.

What is called *jiāotōng* is the simultaneous movement of all meridians in unison. Thus, the fifty circulations fulfill the lifespan granted by Heaven and Earth—a total of eight hundred ten *zhàng* traversed.

**Chapter 16: The Circulation of Vital Essence (营气第十六)**

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"The Dao of vital essence—how does it treasure the grains within?*
Grains enter the stomach, then pass to the lungs, overflowing internally and dispersing externally. When concentrated, they flow through the meridian channels, perpetually circulating without end, endlessly renewing—this is the rhythm of Heaven and Earth.

Thus, qi emanates from *Tài Yīn*, flows into *Shǒu Yáng Míng*, ascends upward, then enters *Zú Yáng Míng* and descends to the *fū* above the ankle, converging at the base of the great toe to reunite with *Tài Yīn*, ascending to the [missing character].

From the spleen, it enters the heart’s center, follows *Shǒu Shǎo Yīn* down the arm, exiting beneath the armpit, and converges at the little finger, merging with *Shǒu Tài Yáng*. It ascends, passing through the armpit and entering the inner elbow, reaching the inner canthus of the eye. Descending from the crown to the nape, it merges with *Zú Tài Yáng*, follows the spine down to the buttocks, and descends to the tip of the little toe. It then travels along the sole, entering *Zú Shǎo Yīn*, ascending to the kidneys.

From the kidneys, it enters the heart, dispersing externally through the chest, following the *heart’s governing vessel* down the arm, passing between the two tendons, entering the palm, and exiting at the middle finger’s tip. It returns to the second finger’s tip, merging with *Shǒu Shǎo Yáng*, ascending to *dànzhōng*, and dispersing through the *Sān Jiāo*. From *Sān Jiāo*, it flows into the gallbladder, exits the ribs, and enters *Zú Shǎo Yáng*, descending to the *fū* above the ankle. It then returns from the ankle to the base of the great toe, merging with *Zú Jué Yīn*, ascending to the liver. From the liver, it ascends to the lungs, follows the throat, enters the occipital aperture, and reaches the *chùmén*.

Its divergent branches ascend the forehead, follow the crown down the nape, and enter the [missing character]—this is the *Dū Mai*.

The *Lùo* vessel of the yin organs ascends past the pubic hair, enters the navel, follows the abdominal cavity upward, enters the *quēpén*, and descends into the lungs, then exits through *Tài Yīn*.

This is the path of the circulating vital essence, its constant ebb and flow.

**Chapter 17: The Pulse’s Measure (脉度第十七)**"

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish to hear of the Pulse’s Measure."*

Qì Bó replied: *"The six yang channels of the hand, from hand to head, measure five *zhàng*—five times six, three *zhàng*. The six yin channels of the hand, from hand to the chest, measure three *zhàng* five *cùn*—three times six, one *zhàng* eight *chǐ*; five times six, three *zhàng*—together, two *zhàng* one *chǐ*.

The six yang channels of the foot, from foot to head, measure eight *zhàng*—six times eight, four *zhàng* eight *chǐ*. The six yin channels of the foot, from foot to the chest, measure six *zhàng* five *cùn*—six times six, three *zhàng* six *chǐ*; five times six, three *zhàng*—together, three *zhàng* nine *chǐ*.

The *Lù Mai* vessel, from foot to eye, measures seven *zhàng* five *cùn*—one times seven, one *zhàng* four *chǐ*; two times five, one *chǐ*—together, one *zhàng* five *chǐ*. The *Dū Mai* and *Rèn Mai* each measure four *zhàng* five *cùn*—two times four, eight *chǐ*; two times five, one *chǐ*—together, nine *chǐ*.

In total, all measure sixteen *zhàng* two *chǐ*—this is the great conduit of the vital *qi*.

The *jīng* channels are the interior; their branches that spread horizontally are the *luò* vessels. The further branches of the *luò* are the *sūn* vessels. When the *luò* vessels are overfilled with blood, they must be swiftly drained; when they are full, they must be reduced; when they are empty, they must be supplemented with medicine.

The five *zàng* organs constantly circulate within the seven orifices above, thus:
- The *lung*’s *qi* communicates with the nose; when the *lung* is harmonious, the nose can discern fragrant and foul odors.
- The *heart*’s *qi* communicates with the tongue; when the *heart* is harmonious, the tongue can discern the five flavors.
- The *liver*’s *qi* communicates with the eyes; when the *liver* is harmonious, the eyes can distinguish the five colors.
- The *spleen*’s *qi* communicates with the mouth; when the *spleen* is harmonious, the mouth can discern the five grains.
- The *kidney*’s *qi* communicates with the ears; when the *kidney* is harmonious, the ears can hear the five tones.

When the five *zàng* are disharmonious, the seven orifices do not function. When the six *fǔ* are disharmonious, *zhì* (stagnation) ensues.

Thus, when *xie* (pathogenic *qi*) lodges in the *fǔ*, the yang channels become disharmonious. When the yang channels are disharmonious, *qi* stagnates, and when *qi* stagnates, the yang *qi* becomes excessive. When the yang *qi* is too excessive, the yin does not flow freely; when the yin channels are obstructed, blood stagnates, and when blood stagnates, the yin *qi* becomes excessive. When the yin *qi* is too excessive, the yang *qi* cannot nourish—this is called *guān* (closure). When the yang *qi* is too excessive, the yin *qi* cannot nourish—this is called *gé* (blockage). When both yin and yang are excessive and cannot nourish each other, this is called *guān gé* (closure-blockage). *Guān gé* means death before the allotted time.

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Where does the *Lù Mai* originate and terminate? What *qi* nourishes the eyes?"*

Qì Bó replied: *"The *Lù Mai* is a divergent branch of the *Shào Yīn* (Kidney). It arises behind the *rán gǔ* (medial malleolus), ascends above the inner ankle, and follows the inner thigh into the groin. It ascends along the chest’s interior, enters the *quēpén* (sternal notch), and emerges before the *rèn yíng* (laryngeal prominence). It then enters and belongs to the inner canthus of the eye, merging with the *Tài Yáng* (Small Intestine) and *Yáng Jì* (Bladder) channels as it ascends. When its *qi* flows harmoniously back and forth, the eyes are moist; when its *qi* does not nourish, the eyes do not close."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Why does the *qi* circulate only through the five *zàng* and not nourish the six *fǔ*?"*

Qì Bó replied: *"The *qi* cannot cease its movement—like water flowing, like the moon’s unending course. Thus, the yin channels nourish the *zàng*, and the yang channels nourish the *fǔ*, like an endless ring, with no discernible beginning or end, returning again and again. Its overflowing *qi* irrigates the *zàng* and *fǔ* internally and moistens the skin and pores externally."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"The *Lù Mai* has yin and yang—what channel corresponds to its count?"*

Qì Bó replied: *"For men, count the yang; for women, count the yin. The correct count is the *jīng* (channel); the incorrect count is the *luò* (vessel)."*

The Yellow Emperor asked Qì Bó: *"From where does a person receive qi? Where do yin and yang converge? Which qi is called *yíng*? Which is called *wèi*? From where does *yíng* originate? Where does *wèi* assemble? The old and the vigorous differ in qi, and yin and yang occupy different positions—may I hear where they converge?"*

Qì Bó replied: *"A person receives qi from food. Food enters the stomach, then passes to the lungs, and the five *zàng* and six *fǔ* all receive qi from it. The refined portion becomes *yíng*, and the turbid portion becomes *wèi*. *Yíng* circulates within the vessels, while *wèi* circulates outside them. *Yíng* flows ceaselessly, completing a full cycle every fifty degrees. Yin and yang interconnect like an endless ring. *Wèi* qi travels twenty-five degrees through yin and twenty-five degrees through yang, dividing into day and night. Thus, when qi reaches yang, one awakens, and when it reaches yin, one rests. Hence it is said: At noon, the *yáng lǒng* reaches its peak as *zhòng yáng* (heavy yang), and at midnight, the *yīn lǒng* reaches its peak as *zhòng yīn* (heavy yin). Therefore, *Tài Yīn* governs the interior, and *Tài Yáng* governs the exterior, each traveling twenty-five degrees, dividing into day and night. At midnight, it is the *yīn lǒng*; after midnight, yin begins to wane. At dawn, yin is exhausted, and yang receives qi. At noon, the *yáng lǒng* peaks; in the west, yang begins to wane. At sunset, yang is exhausted, and yin receives qi. At midnight, they converge, and all people sleep—this is called *hé yīn* (uniting yin). At dawn, when yin is exhausted, yang receives qi again, and so it continues without end, aligning with the cycles of Heaven and Earth."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Why do the elderly not sleep at night, and why do the young and vigorous not sleep during the day?"*

Qì Bó replied: *"In the vigorous, *qi* and blood are abundant, their flesh is supple, and their *qi* pathways are unobstructed. The circulation of *yíng* and *wèi* follows its regular course, so they are alert by day and sleep by night. In the elderly, *qi* and blood are diminished, their flesh is withered, and their *qi* pathways are sluggish. The *zàng* qi clashes, *yíng* qi weakens, and *wèi* qi turns inward aggressively. Thus, they are not alert by day nor do they sleep at night."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish to hear the pathways by which *yíng* and *wèi* circulate."*

Qì Bó replied: *"*Yíng* originates from the *zhōng jiāo* (middle burner), and *wèi* originates from the *xià jiāo* (lower burner)."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish to hear where the three burners originate."*

Qì Bó replied: *"The *shàng jiāo* (upper burner) originates from the upper orifice of the stomach, extending upward through the throat, passing through the diaphragm, and spreading across the chest. It travels to the armpits, following the *Tài Yīn* pathway, then returns to *Yáng Míng*, ascending to the tongue and descending to the *Yáng Míng* of the foot. It always travels with *yíng* through twenty-five degrees of yang and twenty-five degrees of yin in one cycle. Thus, it completes fifty degrees before reassembling at *Shǒu Tài Yīn*."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"When a person has heat, food and drink enter the stomach, but the qi is unsettled, and sweat emerges—sometimes on the face, sometimes on the back, or halfway down the body—why does it not follow the *wèi* qi’s usual path?"*

Qì Bó replied: *"This is due to external injury by wind, which opens the pores. The sweat evaporates through the pores, and *wèi* qi rushes outward, unable to follow its proper course. This qi is fierce, swift, and slippery; when it encounters an opening, it escapes. Thus, it is called *lòu xiè* (leakage)."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"I wish to hear where the *zhōng jiāo* originates."*

Qì Bó replied: *"The *zhōng jiāo* also lies alongside the stomach, emerging after the *shàng jiāo*. This is where qi is received, where it separates dregs from essence, steams the body fluids, and refines them into subtle substances. These ascend into the lung vessels, transforming into blood to nourish life. Nothing is more precious than this, so it alone circulates through the *jīng* pathways and is called *yíng* qi."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Blood and qi share the same essence but have different names—how so?"*

Qì Bó replied: *"*Yíng* and *wèi* are refined *qì*; blood is vital *qì*. Thus, blood and qi share the same essence but differ in name. Therefore, depleting blood results in no sweat, and depleting sweat results in no blood. Hence, a person has two deaths but no second life."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"I wish to hear where the *xià jiāo* originates."*

Qì Bó replied: *"The *xià jiāo* branches from the intestines and drains into the bladder, permeating it. Thus, water and grain always reside in the stomach, forming dregs that descend into the large intestine, becoming the *xià jiāo*. They permeate and descend together, separating and filtering fluids, flowing through the *xià jiāo* into the bladder."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"When a person drinks alcohol, it also enters the stomach, yet urine is excreted before the food is fully digested—why?"*

Qì Bó replied: *"Alcohol is the refined essence of cooked grains, its qi fierce and clear. Thus, it enters after food but its liquid is excreted first."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Excellent. I have heard that the *shàng jiāo* is like mist, the *zhōng jiāo* like vomiting, and the *xià jiāo* like filtration—this is what you mean."*

**Chapter Nineteen: The Qi of the Four Seasons**

The Yellow Emperor asked Qì Bó: *"The qi of the four seasons takes different forms, and the origins of a hundred diseases vary accordingly. What are the fixed principles for *jiǔ* (moxibustion) and *cí* (acupuncture)?"*

Qì Bó replied: *"The qi of the four seasons occupies distinct regions, and the principles of *jiǔ* and *cí* are determined by locating the correct *qì* points. In spring, target the *jīng* (channels), blood, pulses, and the spaces between muscles. For severe cases, use deep needling; for mild cases, use shallow needling. In summer, target the *shèng jīng* (flourishing channels), *sūn luò* (branch vessels), and the spaces between skin and muscle. For autumn, target the *jīng* and *liǎn* (collateral vessels). If the pathogen is in the *fǔ*, treat at the *hé* (convergence) points. In winter, target the *jǐng* (wells) and *róng* (springs), ensuring deep insertion and retention. For *wēn nüè* (intermittent fever with no sweat), it is the *wǔshíjiǔ qí* (59th disease). For *fēng chuáng* (wind-induced bedriddenness) and *pú zhàng* (skin distension), it is the *wǔshíqī qí* (57th disease). When treating by drawing blood from the skin, exhaust it completely. For *shí xiè* (chronic diarrhea), supplement the upper three *yīn* channels and *Yīn Líng Quán*, retaining the needle for a long time until heat subsides. For *zhuǎn jīn* (spasms), if it occurs in yang, treat the yang; if in yin, treat the yin—always using rapid needling. For *tú chuáng* (paralysis), first target a point three *cùn* below *Huán Gǔ*, using a *bì* needle. After needling, insert a tube, then withdraw the needle while pushing the tube inward. Repeat until the paralysis is exhausted. If the response is firm and slow, the patient will feel troubled; if rapid and urgent, the patient will feel at ease. Needle once, then stop when the paralysis is relieved."*

「When administering *yǐnbì* (drink-closing) medication, if the patient is unable to stand during needling, they should drink while seated. When drinking, they should not eat; when eating, they should not drink. They must not consume other foods. The treatment lasts for 135 days.

If *zhuó bì* (fixed numbness) persists and prolonged coldness does not abate, needle the *Sān Lǐ* (ST-36) forcefully. If the bones become dry and the intestines are obstructed, needle *Sān Lǐ* (ST-36) with vigorous *xiě* (draining) and *xū bǔ* (void-supplementing) techniques.

For *lì fēng* (malignant wind), needle the swollen area with a blunt needle first. After needling, use a sharp *ruì zhēn* (needle) to pierce the site, pressing out the noxious *qi*. When the swelling is exhausted, cease. The patient should eat only what is prescribed and avoid other foods.

If the abdomen constantly rumbles, *qi* surges upward to the chest, and the patient gasps unable to stand for long, the evil lies in the *Dà Cháng* (large intestine). Needle *Huáng Shuǎng* (UB-47) at its *yuán* (origin), *Jù Xū* (ST-39) above *Lián* (廉), and *Sān Lǐ* (ST-36).

If the lower abdomen draws the testicles upward, strains the lumbar spine, and surges into the heart, the evil is in the *Xiǎo Cháng* (small intestine). It connects to the testicles, ascends to the spine, pierces the liver and lungs, and networks with the heart’s *xì* (system). When *qi* is excessive, it causes *jué nì* (syncope), surging upward to disrupt the intestines and stomach, darkening the liver, dispersing into *Huáng Shuǎng* (UB-47), and congealing at the *qí* (navel). Thus, needle *Huáng Shuǎng Yuán* (UB-47’s origin) to disperse it, needle *Tài Yīn* (SP-2) to supply it, needle *Jué Yīn* (PC-7) to subdue it, and needle *Jù Xū Xià Lián* (ST-39 below廉) to remove it. Press along the affected channels to regulate them.

For persistent vomiting with bitter taste, prolonged sighing, a hollow *xiānxiān* (resonant) sensation in the heart, and fear of being seized—*yǐn* (evil) in the *Dǎn* (gallbladder), *nì* (rebellion) in the *Wèi* (stomach)—when *dǎn yè* (gallbladder fluid) leaks, the mouth becomes bitter; when *wèi qì* (stomach *qi*) rebels, the patient vomits bitterly. Hence, it is called *ǒu dǎn* (vomiting of the gallbladder). To reverse the *wèi qì nì* (stomach *qi* rebellion), needle the *Shào Yáng xuè luò* (GB-38’s blood network) to close the gallbladder’s rebellion, then adjust the *xū* (void) and *shí* (full) states to expel the evil.

If food and drink do not descend, and the *gè* (diaphragm) is obstructed, the evil is in the *Wèi Yuàn* (stomach’s courtyard). If it is in the upper courtyard, needle *Yì* (ST-45) to push it downward; if in the lower courtyard, disperse and remove it.

If the lower abdomen aches and swells, and the patient cannot urinate, the evil is in the *Sān Jiāo* (triple burner) constriction. Needle the *Tài Yáng dà luò* (GB-14’s major network), observing where the network channel intersects with the *Jué Yīn xiǎo luò* (PC-7’s minor network) and blood congeals—whether at the swollen area or in the stomach’s courtyard—and needle *Sān Lǐ* (ST-36).

To discern its dispersion or recurrence, examine the patient’s eye color. To determine the fate of the illness, observe their overall form and listen to their *dòngjìng* (movement and stillness). Hold the breath and check *Rén Yíng* (REN-22) at the *gǔkǒu* (mouth of the pulse), noting if the pulse is firm, excessive, and slippery—then the illness advances daily. If the pulse is soft, the illness will soon subside. When all channels are full, the illness will resolve in three days.

*Gǔkǒu* (mouth of the pulse) diagnoses *yīn* (cold), while *Rén Yíng* (REN-22) diagnoses *yáng* (heat).」

**Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon – *Lingshu* (Spiritual Pivot) – *Jizhu* (Collected Commentary) Volume Nine**
**Five Evils (Wǔ Xié) – Chapter Twenty**

When evil is in the **lung**, the patient suffers from **skin and flesh pain**, **chills and fever**, **shortness of breath**, **sweating**, **coughing**, and **shoulder and back spasms**. Needle the **external and lateral regions of the chest** (*yīng zhōng wài liǎn*), the **three joints of the back** (one variant reads *"five joints"* and another *"five joints beside the forehead"*), pressing firmly until a sharp, clear sensation is felt—then needle. Alternatively, needle the **suprasternal fossa** (*quē pén zhōng*) to **drain** it.

When evil is in the **liver**, the patient suffers from **pain in both flanks**, **internal cold**, **malignant blood stagnation**, **tendency to spasm**, **periodic leg swelling**. Needle the **channel’s junction** (*xíng wèn*) to **draw out the flanks**, **reinforce Sān Lǐ** (ST-36) to **warm the stomach**, **take blood from the vessels** to **dissipate the malignant blood**, and **needle the green pulse at the ear junction** (*ěr wèn*) to **remove the spasms**.

When evil is in the **spleen and stomach**, the patient suffers from **muscle pain**, **excessive yang qi** and **insufficient yin qi**, leading to **internal heat and excessive hunger**; or **insufficient yang qi** and **excessive yin qi**, leading to **internal cold, intestinal rumbling, and abdominal pain**. If both **yin and yang are excessive** or **both are insufficient**, the patient experiences **both cold and heat**, all of which are **regulated at Sān Lǐ** (ST-36).

When evil is in the **kidney**, the patient suffers from **bone pain, yin numbness**—where **pressing yields no sensation**—**abdominal distension, lower back pain, difficult defecation, shoulder, back, neck, and occipital pain**, and **occasional dizziness**. Needle **Yǒng Quán** (KID-1) and **Kūn Lún** (BL-60), draining all blood present.

When evil is in the **heart**, the patient suffers from **heart pain, melancholy, sadness, occasional dizziness, and fainting**. Observe whether there is **excess or deficiency** and **regulate its output** (*shū*).

**Phonetic Notes:**
*"Dùn"* sounds like *"quán"* (权). *"Tóng"* is homophonous with *"tǒng"* (筒). *"Zhuó"* in *"zhú bì"* (着痹) is pronounced *"zháo"* in the first tone, *"bì"* as *"bì"* (闭). *"Ruì zhēn"* (锐针) is pronounced *"rù huì"* (余惠), meaning *"sharp needle."* *"Máng"* (芒) is implied.

**Chapter 21: Diseases of Cold and Heat**

When **skin cold-heat** occurs, the patient may not tolerate lying down, with **parched hair and lips like dried wax**, unable to sweat. Treat by **draining the collateral vessels of the Three Yang** and **supplementing the Hand Taiyin**.

When **muscle cold-heat** occurs, there is **muscle pain**, **parched hair and lips like dried wax**, and inability to sweat. **Drain the Three Yang from below** to remove excess blood, then **supplement the Foot Taiyin** to induce sweating.

When **bone cold-heat** occurs, the patient finds no relief, with **persistent sweating**, teeth yet unparched—**needle the minor yin collaterals at the inner thigh**. If the teeth are already parched, **the case is untreatable and fatal**. The same applies to **bone tetany**.

For **tetanic numbness**, where **ulcerative qi rises to the abdomen**, treat by **draining the yin-yang collaterals**, adjusting based on the primary ailment—**draining excess yang, supplementing yin channels**.

If the body is injured with **profound blood loss**, or struck by **wind-cold**, or from **falls**, resulting in **limp, unresponsive extremities**, this is called **"body lassitude"**—**needle the three convergences below the navel**. The **three convergences** are:
- **Yangming** and **Taiyin** (the **lower abdomen**),
- **Guanyuan** (three *cun* below the navel).

For **ulcerative numbness**, where **ulcerative qi ascends to the abdomen**, **drain the yin-yang collaterals**, adjusting based on the primary ailment—**draining excess yang, supplementing yin channels**.

The **pulsating artery at the neck** is **Renying** (Foot Yangming), located **anterior to the hyoid tendon**. Posterior to the hyoid tendon lies **Futou** (Hand Yangming). The next artery is **Tianyou** (Foot Shaoyang), and the following is **Tianzhu** (Foot Taiyang). The **armpit artery** is **Tianfu** (Arm Taiyin).

For **headache with Renying distension and chest fullness**, unable to breathe—**needle Renying**.
For **sudden emaciation with whip-like pain**—**needle Futou and the base of the tongue to induce bleeding**.
For **sudden deafness with clouded senses, blurred vision**—**needle Tianyou**.
For **sudden tetany with itching and dizziness, unable to bear weight**—**needle Tianzhu**.
For **sudden pestilential reversal**, where **liver and lungs clash**, blood gushing from nose and mouth—**needle Tianfu**.

These are the **five Tianyou regions**.

The **Arm Yangming** has a branch encircling the teeth, called **Dawying**—**needle for lower tooth decay**, located below the jaw.
If **fear of cold**, **supplement it**; if **no fear of cold**, **drain it**.

The **Foot Taiyang** has a branch encircling the teeth, called **Jiaosun**—**needle for upper tooth decay**, located **anterior to the nose and jaw**.
When disease manifests, if the pulse is **full**, **drain it**; if **empty**, **supplement it**. **Bleed from the nose daily**.

The **Foot Yangming** has a branch **flanking the nose into the face**, called **Xuangu**—**opposing the eye’s root**, treating excess by **reducing** and deficiency by **augmenting**, reversing by **strengthening**.

The **Foot Taiyang** has a path **entering the nape into the brain**, called **Yanxi**—**for head and eye pain**, located **between the two neck tendons**, branching into **Yinjiao and Yangju**. Where **yin and yang intersect**, **yang enters yin, yin exits yang**, converging at the **eye’s sharp pupil**—**excess yang causes glare**, **excess yin causes dimness**.

For **heat tetany**, **needle Foot Taiyin and Shaoyang**, **retaining the needle**.
For **cold tetany**, **needle Foot Yangming and Shaoyin at the foot**, **retaining the needle**.

For **prolonged tongue with drooling, restlessness, and euphoria**—**needle Foot Shaoyin**.
For **shivering with alcohol exposure, chin quivering, inability to sweat, abdominal distension, and restlessness**—**needle Hand Taiyin**.

When **needling the empty**, **direct the needle outward**; when **needling the full**, **direct the needle inward**.
- **Spring**: treat **collateral vessels**,
- **Summer**: treat **muscle layers**,
- **Autumn**: treat **qi orifices**,
- **Winter**: treat **channel junctions**.
These four seasons align with their respective times:
- **Collateral vessels** govern **skin and hair**,
- **Muscle layers** govern **flesh and sinews**,
- **Qi orifices** govern **tendons and vessels**,
- **Channel junctions** govern **bones, marrow, and five viscera**.

The body has **five critical regions**:
1. **Futu** (groin),
2. **Fei** (calf, *fei* as "end"),
3. **Back**,
4. **Visceral faces** (anterior body),
5. **Neck**.
If **ulcerative carbuncles** appear in these five regions, **death is inevitable**.

If disease begins in the **arms**, first **needle Hand Yangming and Taiyin to induce sweating**.
If disease begins in the **head**, first **needle Neck Taiyang to induce sweating**.
If disease begins in the **foot channels**, first **needle Foot Yangming to induce sweating**.
**Arm Taiyin** can induce sweating, as can **Foot Yangming**.

Thus, if **needling yin channels induces excessive sweating**, **counter with yang**; if **needling yang channels induces excessive sweating**, **counter with yin**.

The harms of needling:
- If the needle **strikes but does not withdraw**, **essence is depleted**—**disease worsens and stagnates**.
- If the needle **fails to strike but withdraws**, **qi is disrupted**—**leading to ulceration and carbuncles**.

**Phonetic Notes:**
*"Gǎo là"* (槁腊) also pronounced *"sì xiǎo"* (思亦切).

**Epilepsy and Madness (癫狂)**

**Diseases of the Teeth and Face:**
*"Qǔ"* (齲丘禹切) – tooth decay (*齿蠹*).
*"Shùn duì"* (顺逵仇二音) – forehead and face (*面额*).
*"Yù"* (悦) – pronounced *"mèn"* (闷).
*"Fēi"* (腓) – pronounced *"féi"* (肥).

**Epilepsy (癫疾):**
When epilepsy first arises, the patient first feels displeasure, a heavy and painful head, and severe redness in the eyes upon movement. Later, they become restless at heart. If observed on the face, needle **Arm Taiyang, Yangming, and Taiyin**—when the blood shifts, the condition ceases.

When epilepsy begins with sudden weeping, gasping, and palpitations, observe **Hand Yangming and Taiyang**. If the left side is stronger, attack the right, and if the right is stronger, attack the left—when the blood shifts, the condition ceases.

When epilepsy begins with sudden stiffness, followed by back pain, observe **Foot Taiyang, Yangming, Taiyin, and Arm Taiyang**—when the blood shifts, the condition ceases.

To treat epilepsy, always reside with the patient and observe where needling is required. When the disease manifests, if the affected area shows excess, bleed it, and place the blood in a gourd vessel. At the onset of the seizure, the blood will move on its own. If it does not move, moxibustion is applied to the **Xionggu (穷骨)**—the skeletal bones—twenty times.

**Bone Epilepsy (骨癫疾):**
The face, teeth, and all facial muscles swell, while the bones remain exposed. Sweating and restlessness ensue. If there is excessive vomiting with frothy spittle and downward leakage of *qi*, treatment is futile.

**Tendon Epilepsy (筋癫疾):**
The body becomes exhausted and rigidly contracted. Needle the **Dazhu (大杼)** pulse on the nape. If there is excessive vomiting with frothy spittle and downward leakage of *qi*, treatment is futile.

**Vascular Epilepsy (脉癫疾):**
Sudden collapse occurs, with all four limbs’ pulses distended and relaxed. If the pulses are full, bleed them thoroughly. If not full, apply moxibustion to the **Taiyang** on the nape and the **Dai (带)** pulse three inches from the waist, targeting all branch and convergence points. If there is excessive vomiting with frothy spittle and downward leakage of *qi*, treatment is futile.

If epilepsy manifests violently like madness, death is inevitable.

**Madness (狂):**
When madness first arises, the patient initially feels sorrow, forgets joy, is prone to anger, and easily frightened—caused by grief and hunger. Treat by needling **Hand Taiyin and Yangming**; when the blood shifts, the condition ceases. Also needle **Foot Taiyin and Yangming**.

When madness erupts, with little sleep and no hunger, the patient boasts of wisdom, argues endlessly, and claims nobility, often insulting others day and night. Treat by needling **Hand Yangming, Taiyang, Taiyin, the tongue’s underside, and Shaoyin**. If the pulses are strong, bleed them; if not, release the tension.

If madness involves wild speech, startling, excessive laughter, love of music, and ceaseless erratic behavior—caused by extreme fear—treat by needling **Hand Yangming, Taiyang, and Taiyin**.

If madness includes hallucinations, phantom sounds, and excessive shouting—stemming from deficient *qi*—treat by needling **Hand Taiyang, Taiyin, Yangming, Foot Taiyin, the head, and both cheeks**.

If madness involves excessive eating, visions of ghosts and spirits, and laughter without external expression—caused by great joy—treat by first needling **Foot Taiyin, Taiyang, and Yangming**, then **Hand Taiyin, Taiyang, and Yangming**.

If madness is newly emergent and not yet severe, first needle the **Qūquán (曲泉)**’s lateral moving pulses. If bleeding does not cease after a time, apply the method and moxibustion to the skeletal bones twenty times.

**Wind Reversal (风逆):**
Sudden swelling of the four limbs, a trembling body, intermittent chills, restlessness when hungry, and dizziness when full. Observe **Hand Taiyin (both yin and yang aspects)**, **Foot Shaoyin and Yangming** channels. For muscular symptoms, target the **Rong (荣)** points; for skeletal symptoms, target the **Jing (井)** and **Jing (经)** points.

**Syncope (厥逆):**
Sudden stiffness of the feet, a chest as if about to burst, and intestines as if cut by a knife. Restlessness and inability to eat, with pulses—both large and small—rough. Apply warm needling to **Foot Shaoyin**; apply cleansing needling to **Foot Yangming**. If cold, supplement; if hot, bleed.

If syncope involves abdominal distension, intestinal rumbling, and chest fullness preventing breath, needle the lower chest.

If the sides ache with hand movements, press the back and face with the hands—immediate relief indicates success.

If internal obstruction prevents movement, needle **Foot Shaoyin, Taiyang, and the Xionggu (骸骨)** with long needles. If *qi* reverses, needle **Taiyin, Yangming, and Jueyin**; if severe, target the moving pulses of **Shaoyin and Yangming**.

**Deficient *Qi* (少气):**
The body trembles (*shīshī*), bones ache, and there is heaviness and lethargy. Supplement **Foot Shaoyin**.

**Shortness of Breath (短气):**
Breath is shallow and disconnected; movement exhausts *qi*. Supplement **Foot Shaoyin** and remove stagnant blood from the vessels.

**Fever Diseases (热病)**

**Hemiplegia (偏枯):**
One-sided paralysis with pain but no speech or mental disorder. The disease lies between the skin and muscles. Use a large needle to supplement deficiencies and reduce excesses—only then may recovery occur.

**Convulsions (痱):**
No pain, but limbs cannot contract. Mental confusion is mild, speech faintly coherent—treatable. If severe, with inability to speak, treatment is futile.

If disease first arises in the **yang** and later enters the **yin**, first needle the **yang**, then the **yin**, using superficial techniques.

If fever persists for three days and the **Cègu (气口)** pulse is calm while the **Rènyīng (人迎)** is agitated, needle all **yang** channels with fifty-nine punctures to reduce heat, induce sweating, and supplement the **yin** to address deficiencies.

If body heat is extreme and both **yin** and **yang** pulses are calm, **do not needle**. If needling is necessary, act swiftly—if no sweating follows, bleed.

*"Do not needle"* refers to cases with signs of impending death.

If fever lasts seven or eight days, with a **Cègu** pulse that is short (or taut), needle urgently—sweating will follow. Use shallow needling on the **Hand Daizhi (大指间)**.

「If fever persists for seven or eight days, with a pulse that is faint and small, the patient will convulse, and their mouth will become dry, dying within half a day; if the pulse is intermittent, they will die within one day.

If fever has already induced sweating but the pulse remains agitated and the patient is short of breath, yet heat recurs, **do not needle the skin**#5—if the shortness of breath is extreme, death follows.

If fever lasts seven or eight days, with a pulse that is neither agitated nor dispersed, and sweating appears only later within three days; if no sweating occurs after three days, death follows on the fourth day. **Do not needle those who have not yet sweated**#6.

If fever first manifests as **skin pain and nasal congestion, with a flushed face**, needle the **skin**, using the **first needle**#7, with fifty-nine punctures, **piercing the nasal cavity**#7 and **seeking the skin’s connection to the lungs**#7—if the **fire**#7 is not found, the **fire**#7 refers to the **heart**.

If fever first presents as **body stiffness**, with **heat upon pressure**#8, agitation, and delight, **dry lips and constricted throat**#8, needle the **skin**#9, using the **first needle**#7, with fifty-nine punctures—if the abdomen swells and the mouth becomes dry, with **cold sweat emerging**, **seek the pulse’s connection to the heart**#9, and if the **water**#9 is not found, the **water**#9 refers to the **kidneys**.

If fever causes **excessive thirst and frequent drinking**, with **easily startled reflexes**, and the patient cannot rise, needle the **skin and flesh**, using the **sixth needle**#7, with fifty-nine punctures—if the **eyes become greenish-blue**#7, **seek the flesh’s connection to the spleen**#7, and if the **wood**#7 is not found, the **wood**#7 refers to the **liver**.

If fever presents as **a greenish-blue face and brain pain**, with **agitated hands and feet**, needle the **tendons**#7, using the **fourth needle**#7, at the **Four Reversals**#7—if the **tendons are tense and the eyes sunken**#7, **seek the tendons’ connection to the liver**#7, and if the **metal**#7 is not found, the **metal**#7 refers to the **lungs**.

If fever causes **frequent convulsions**, with **spasms and madness**, needle the **pulse**, using the **fourth needle**#7—**bleed swiftly if excess remains**; if **epileptic seizures occur and hair falls out**, **seek the blood’s connection to the heart**#7, and if the **water**#7 is not found, the **water**#7 refers to the **kidneys**.

If fever causes **body heaviness and bone pain**, with **deafness and a preference for darkness**, needle the **bones**, using the **fourth needle**#7, with fifty-nine punctures—if the **bone disease prevents eating**, with **gnashing of teeth and blue ears**, **seek the bones’ connection to the kidneys**#7, and if the **earth**#7 is not found, the **earth**#7 refers to the **spleen**.

If fever is **painless**, with **deafness and inability to withdraw oneself**, and **dry mouth**, with **extreme yang heat** and **some yin cold**, the heat lies in the **marrow**—death is inevitable, and treatment is futile.

If fever causes **headache**, with **visible forehead veins**, **eye spasms and painful pulse**, and **tendency to bind tightly**#7, it is a case of **heatstroke with alternating cold and heat**#7—needle with the **third needle**#7, observing whether excess or deficiency remains, and treat accordingly for **cold and heat**#7.

If fever causes **body heaviness** and **intestinal heat**, needle with the **fourth needle**#7, at the **cheek and the lower spaces between the fingers**, **seeking the qi’s connection to the stomach**#10—if the **qi is obtained**#10.

If fever causes **sudden, severe pain around the navel**, with **chest and flank fullness**, needle **Yǒngquán (涌泉)** and **Yīnlíngquán (阴陵泉)**, using the **fourth needle**#7, and **needle the navel’s interior**.

If fever has already induced sweating and the pulse is **harmonious and sweating is possible**, needle **Yújì (鱼际)**, **Tàiyuān (太渊)**, **Dàdū (大都)**, and **Tàibái (太白)**—**bleeding will remove the heat**, and **supplementing will induce sweating**; if sweating is **excessively profuse**, needle the **horizontal pulse above the inner ankle** to stop it.

If fever has already induced sweating but the pulse remains **agitated and strong**, this is the **extreme of yin pulse**—death follows;
If fever has induced sweating and the pulse is **calm**, life follows.

If fever’s pulse remains **strong and agitated but sweating does not occur**, this is the **extreme of yang pulse**—death follows;
If fever’s pulse is **strong and agitated but sweating occurs and the pulse becomes calm**, life follows.

There are nine cases of fever where needling is **forbidden**:
1. If sweating does not emerge and the **face becomes deeply red**#7, with **convulsions**#7, death follows;
2. If there is **diarrhea with extreme abdominal fullness**, death follows;
3. If the **eyes are unclear** and the heat does not cease, death follows;
4. If **elderly or infants** have heat with **abdominal fullness**, death follows;
5. If sweating does not emerge and there is **vomiting with blood**, death follows;
6. If the **tongue’s root rots** and the heat does not cease, death follows;
7. If there is **persistent coughing**#7, with **sweating that does not reach the feet**, death follows;
8. If the **marrow is heated**, death follows;
9. If there is **heat with tetany**#7, with **waist collapse**, **severe spasm**#7, **gnashing of teeth**, and **inability to speak**#7, death follows.

In all these nine cases, needling is **forbidden**.

The **fifty-nine punctures** are as follows:
- On each **outer and inner side of both hands**, three punctures each, totaling twelve **acupuncture points**#7;
- On each **space between the fingers**#7, one puncture each, totaling eight **acupuncture points**#7—**the feet are treated similarly**;
- On the **head**, one inch into the hairline with a three-fen#7 offset, three punctures each, totaling six **wounds**#7;
- Further, **three inches into the hairline with a five-fen#7 offset**, totaling ten **acupuncture points**#7;
- On the **fore and aft of the ears**, and **below the mouth**, one puncture each, and one at the **nape**, totaling six **acupuncture points**#7;
- On the **vertex**#7, **crown**#7, **hairline**#7, **Lianquán (廉泉)**, **Fēngchí (风池)** (two), and **Tiānzhù (天柱)** (two).

If **qi accumulates in the chest**, causing **shortness of breath**, needle the **end of the big toe on the Foot Taiyin (太阴)** channel, **one build#11-leaf’s length from the nail**—if cold, **retain the needle**; if heat, **withdraw it swiftly**, and the shortness of breath will cease.

If **heart colic** causes **sudden, severe pain**, needle **Foot Taiyin (太阴)** and **Jueyin (厥阴)**, **exhaustively puncturing the blood vessels**.

If **throat obstruction** causes **tongue rolling**, with **dry mouth**, **agitation and heart pain**, and **pain in the inner arm’s Lian (廉)**, **avoid needling the head**, and instead needle the **base of the little and second fingers**, **one scallion-leaf’s length from the nail**.

If **eye pain is red**, beginning from the **inner canthus**, needle at **Yīnjiāo (阴娇)**.

If **wind tetany** causes **body inversion and folding**, first needle **Foot Taiyang (太阳)**, **the lateral side of the leg**, and **the blood vessels to induce bleeding**; if **cold remains internally**, needle **Sānlǐ (三里)**.

For **malaria**, needle **Yīnjiāo (阴娇)**, **above the three hairs**, and **the blood vessels to induce bleeding**.

If **men are afflicted like by a parasitic infection** and **women are afflicted like by a uterine disorder**, with **the body and waist resembling dissolution**, and **no desire for food or drink**, first needle **Yǒngquán (涌泉)** to induce bleeding; if the **pulse above the navel**#7 is **strong**, **exhaustively induce bleeding**.

**[Phonetic Notes]**#7 *Jìng* (痉) is pronounced *Jù píng jiǐng qiě*.
*Jìn* (噤) is pronounced *Jù jìn*.
*Lìng* (龄) is pronounced *jiè*.
**Heatstroke with alternating cold and heat**#7 is the **24th illness**.

**Headache (厥头痛):**
If the **head aches (厥)**, and the **face appears swollen and restless (烦心)**, needle **Zúyángmíng (足阳明)** and **Tàiyīn (太阴)**.

If the **headache (厥头痛)** is accompanied by **pain in the head’s pulse (头脉)**, **melancholy (心悲)**, **excessive weeping (善泣)**, and **the occipital artery (视头动脉)** is **distended (反盛)**, **exhaustively bleed it**; afterward, regulate **Zújuéyīn (足厥阴)**.

If the **headache (厥头痛)** is **persistent and heavy (贞贞)**, with **lines drawn on the head (写头上五行)**, **five lines in total (行五)**, first needle **Shǒushàoyīn (手少阴)**, then **Zúshàoyīn (足少阴)**.

If the **headache (厥头痛)** is **marked by forgetfulness (意善忘)**, and **pressure brings no relief (按之不得)**, needle **the head’s and face’s left and right arteries (头面左右动脉)**, then **Zútàiyīn (足太阴)**.

If the **headache (厥头痛)** first **afflicts the nape (项)**, and **the waist and spine respond (腰脊为应)**, first needle **Tiānzhù (天柱)**, then **Zútàiyáng (足太阳)**.

If the **headache (厥头痛)** is **severe**, with **pulsing heat in the ears’ anterior and posterior vessels (耳前后脉涌有热)**—one text says **Shíyǒu (石有)** has **dynamic arteries (动脉)**—bleed them; afterward, needle **Zúshàoyáng (足少阳)**.

**True Headache (真头痛):**
If **the entire head throbs in pain (脑尽痛)**, with **hands and feet cold up to the joints (手足寒至节)**, it is **incurable (死不治)**.

**Headache (头痛) not to be needled on the face (脸):**
If struck or fallen upon, **evil blood (恶血)** remains **internally (在於内)**; if **flesh is injured (肉伤)**, and **pain persists (痛未已)**, then **needling is permissible (可则刺)**, but **distal points are not to be used (不可远取)**.

**Headache (头痛) not to be needled:**
If **major *bì* (痹)** is **evil (为恶)**, and **the condition worsens daily (日作者)**, it may be **mitigated slightly (可令少愈)**, but **not cured (不可已)**.

**Chapter 27: *Zhōu Bì* (Circulating Paralysis)**
The Yellow Emperor asked Qī Bó:
*"When **circulating paralysis (周痹)** manifests in the body, it moves upward and downward, following the pulse in its ascent and descent, corresponding left and right, leaving no space unasked. I wish to hear—does this pain reside within the blood vessels, or between the muscles? How does it arise? Its shifting pain cannot be reached by a single needle, nor can its treatment be fixed while the pain persists—yet the pain ceases on its own. What principle governs this?"*

Qī Bó replied:
*"This is not **circulating paralysis (周痹)**—it is **generalized paralysis (众痹)**."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"I wish to hear of **generalized paralysis (众痹)**."*

Qī Bó answered:
*"This occurs in fixed locations, erupting and subsiding alternately, shifting and resurfacing, with the right corresponding to the left and the left to the right. It does not circulate—it merely erupts and rests in turn."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"Excellent. How should one puncture it?"*

Qī Bó replied:
*"When puncturing this, though the pain may cease, one must still treat its source to prevent recurrence."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"Excellent. Now, what of **circulating paralysis (周痹)**?"*

Qī Bó answered:
*"**Circulating paralysis (周痹)** resides within the blood vessels, ascending and descending along the pulse, unable to shift laterally—each remains in its proper place."*

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"How should one puncture it?"*

Qī Bó replied:
*"If the pain moves from above downward, first puncture the lower point to **check (过)** it, then align the lower with the upper and puncture the upper point to **release (脱)** it. If the pain moves from below upward, first puncture the upper point to **check (过)** it, then puncture the lower point to **release (脱)** it."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"Excellent. How does this pain arise? What causes it to be named thus?"*

Qī Bó replied:
*"When **wind, cold, and damp qi** lodge between the outer layers of flesh, pressing and congealing into **stagnation (沫)**, the stagnation, encountering cold, clumps together. As it clumps, it forces apart the flesh, causing **fissures (分裂)**—and where there are fissures, there is pain. When pain arises, the **spirit (神)** converges there, and where the spirit converges, **heat (热)** follows. Heat then leads to **ache and lassitude (痛懈)**, and when the ache subsides, **syncope (厥)** occurs. Syncope then gives rise to other **paralytic disorders (他痹)**, and this is how the cycle unfolds."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"Excellent. I have grasped its meaning. This disorder does not originate within the **zàng (藏)**, nor does it manifest outwardly upon the **skin (皮)**—it resides solely between the layers of flesh, where the **true qi (真气)** cannot circulate freely, hence its name, **circulating paralysis (周痹)**.*

Thus, when puncturing **paralytic disorders (痹)**, one must first **examine (切循)** the six **meridians (经)** below, assessing their **emptiness and fullness (虚实)**. Then, one must locate the **blood stagnation (血结)** within the major **collaterals (大络)** that fails to flow, as well as the **hollow points where the pulse sinks (虚而脉陷空者)** and **regulate (调)** them. Apply **moxibustion (熨)** to promote circulation, and if the **stagnation (痣)** is firm, **redirect (转引)** the needle to disperse it.*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"Excellent. I have grasped its meaning, and also its methods. This is the **ninth principle (九者)** for **mastering the meridians (经巽)** and **harmonizing the diseases of the twelve meridians (十二经脉阴阳之病)**."*

【Sound Annotation】 *Chéng xū liù qiè.*

**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Questions on the Mouth**

The Yellow Emperor, in leisurely repose, dismissed his attendants and questioned Qi Bo, saying: *"I have already heard the Nine-Needle Canon, discussing the inversions and regularities of yin and yang, and the six meridians have been explained. Now I wish to learn the oral teachings."*

Qi Bo rose from his seat and bowed twice, replying: *"Noble inquiry indeed! This is what the former masters transmitted orally."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish to hear the oral teachings."*

Qi Bo answered: *"All diseases begin with the influences of wind, rain, cold, and heat; the fluctuations of yin and yang from joy and anger; and the effects of diet, dwelling, sudden fright, and terror. When these occur, blood and qi separate, yin and yang disperse, the meridians and collaterals are obstructed, the pulse pathways are blocked, yin and yang counter each other, the defensive qi stagnates, the meridians and vessels become hollow and empty, and blood and qi flow irregularly. Thus, their natural order is lost.

Now, regarding disorders not found in the meridians, I shall explain their treatments.

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What qi causes the act of yawning?"*
Qi Bo replied: *"The defensive qi moves through the yang during the day and returns to the yin at night. The yin governs the night, and the night is external; the yang governs above, the yin governs below. Thus, yin-qi accumulates beneath, while yang-qi has not yet fully exhausted. The yang is drawn upward, and the yin is drawn downward; yin and yang pull against one another, causing repeated yawns. When yang-qi is spent and yin-qi prevails, the eyes close; when yin-qi is spent and yang-qi prevails, one awakens. Treat by supplementing the Foot Shaoyin and draining the Foot Taiyang."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What qi causes the act of belching?"*
Qi Bo replied: *"When food enters the stomach, the stomach’s qi ascends to the lungs. If lingering cold-qi and fresh food-qi both return to the stomach, the old and new clash, the true and the pathogenic attack each other, and the qi flows counter to its natural course, then it is expelled from the stomach—thus belching occurs. Treat by supplementing the Hand Taiyin and draining the Foot Shaoyin."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What qi causes the act of sighing (xī)?"*
Qi Bo replied: *"This is when yin-qi is excessive and yang-qi is deficient. The yin-qi moves swiftly while the yang-qi is sluggish; if yin-qi is excessive and yang-qi is utterly spent, then sighing (xī) occurs. Treat by supplementing the Foot Taiyang and draining the Foot Shaoyin."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What qi causes shivering and cold sensations?"*
Qi Bo replied: *"When cold-qi invades the skin, yin-qi is excessive and yang-qi is deficient—thus shivering and cold tremors arise. Treat by supplementing all the yang meridians."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What qi causes the act of groaning (yè)?"*
Qi Bo replied: *"When cold-qi invades the stomach, it flows upward in reverse, dispersing from below, and is expelled from the stomach—thus groaning (yè) occurs. Treat by supplementing the Foot Taiyin and Foot Yangming. This is also called the ‘eyebrow root’ treatment."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What qi causes sneezing?"*
Qi Bo replied: *"When yang-qi is harmonious and flows freely, it fills the heart and is expelled through the nose—thus sneezing occurs. Treat by supplementing the Foot Taiyang’s *Rong* and the eyebrow root. This is also called the ‘above-eyebrow’ treatment."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What qi causes the act of gasping (hán)?"*
Qi Bo replied: *"If the stomach is not full, all the vessels become empty. When the vessels are empty, tendons and sinews slacken. If tendons and sinews slacken, movement in yin regions requires effort, and the breath cannot return—thus gasping (hán) occurs. Treat by supplementing the *flesh-between* points where the disorder manifests."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What qi causes weeping and tears when one is sorrowful?"*
Qi Bo replied: *"The heart is sovereign over the five zàng and six fǔ. The eyes are where the宗脉 converge, the pathway of the上液. The mouth and nostrils are the gates of the breath. Thus, when sorrow, grief, or melancholy stir the heart, the heart moves, and all the five zàng and six fǔ tremble. The宗脉 are affected, and the液 pathway opens—thus tears flow. The液 nourishes the essence and moistens the hollow orifices; when the上液 pathway opens, weeping occurs. If weeping does not cease, the液 is exhausted, and the essence is not nourished. If the essence is not nourished, the eyes cannot see—thus it is called ‘essence depletion.’ Treat by supplementing the *Tianzhu* meridian (挟颈#6)."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What qi causes deep sighing (tàixī)?"*
Qi Bo replied: *"When worry and thought tighten the heart’s cords, the breath pathway constricts, and the breath does not flow freely—thus one sighs deeply to expel it. Treat by supplementing the Hand Shaoyin, *Heart Master* (心主), and retaining the Foot Shaoyin’s *Rong* and Foot Shaoyin’s *Ling*."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What qi causes drooling?"*
Qi Bo replied: *"All food and drink enter the stomach. If there is heat in the stomach, the虫 stir, and the stomach relaxes. When the stomach relaxes, the *Lianquan* (廉泉) well opens—thus drooling occurs. Treat by supplementing the Foot Shaoyin."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What qi causes a buzzing sound in the ears?"*
Qi Bo replied: *"The ears are where the宗脉 converge. If the stomach is empty, the宗脉 become hollow and sink downward, and the collaterals are depleted—thus the ears buzz. Treat by supplementing the *Guest Master* (客主人) and the points on the tip of the Hand Yangming’s *Daizhi* (大指) nail where it meets the flesh."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What qi causes one to bite one’s own tongue?"*
Qi Bo replied: *"This is when逆流 ascends, and the pulse’s qi reaches its peak. When Foot Shaoyin’s qi reaches its peak, one bites the tongue; when Foot Shaoyin’s *Rong* qi reaches its peak, one bites the cheek; when Foot Yangming’s qi reaches its peak, one bites the lips. Observe which meridian governs the disorder and treat accordingly.

In total, these twelve pathological signs are all instances of奇邪 invading the hollow orifices. Thus, where the邪 resides, the natural qi is always insufficient. If the上气 is insufficient, the brain feels unfulfilled, the ears suffer buzzing, the head feels heavy, and the eyes grow dizzy; if the中气 is insufficient, the intestines and bowels change, and the intestines suffer rumbling; if the下气 is insufficient, then痿厥 and心悦 arise. Treat by supplementing the points below the Foot Taiyang’s external malleolus (溜#7)."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How should these disorders be treated?"*
Qi Bo replied: *"For yawning, the kidney governs—supplement the Foot Shaoyin; for belching, the lung governs—supplement the Hand Taiyin and Foot Shaoyin; for sighing (xī), yin and yang are utterly severed—supplement the Foot Taiyang and drain the Foot Shaoyin."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I have heard#1 that my former teachers possessed certain principles stored in their hearts, which they did not commit to writing in any fixed form. I wish to hear and preserve them, then follow them in practice—applying them above to govern the people and below to cultivate my own body—so that the common folk may suffer no illness, and thus the ruler and people may live in harmony, with virtue and benevolence flowing downward, ensuring that descendants have no worries, and these teachings may be passed on to future generations without end. May I hear them?"*

Qì Bó replied: *"Your question reaches far indeed! Governing the people and governing oneself, treating others and treating oneself, addressing minor and major ailments, managing the state and the family—none can be treated successfully by opposing their nature. Only by following their nature can they be treated. Following their nature does not mean merely observing the proper sequence of yin and yang pulses and the flow of qi. Rather, it means aligning with the will of the people and common folk."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How does one follow their nature?"*

Qì Bó replied: *"When entering a country, inquire about its customs; when entering a home, ask about its taboos; when ascending the hall, question its rituals; and when attending to the sick, ask what would ease their condition."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How does one ease the sick?"*

Qì Bó replied: *"If there is internal heat and dampness is drained, the patient will prefer cold. For those suffering from cold, heat is preferred. Heat in the stomach consumes the grains, causing the patient to feel anxious and perpetually hungry, while the skin above the navel is hot. Heat in the intestines produces yellowish, gruel-like discharges, and the skin below the navel grows cold. Cold in the stomach causes abdominal distension; cold in the intestines causes intestinal rumbling, with frequent diarrhea. If the stomach is cold and the intestines are hot, there will be distension and diarrhea. If the stomach is hot and the intestines are cold, the patient will suffer from voracious hunger and pain in the lower abdomen."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"The stomach prefers cold and hunger#2, while the intestines prefer warmth and drink. When these two desires conflict, how should one proceed? Moreover, for the kings and great lords—those who feast on blood and grain—who indulge their desires, scorn others, and lack the ability to restrain themselves, if one restrains them, they will resist; if one follows their desires, their illnesses will worsen. How should one treat them, and what should take precedence?"*

Qì Bó replied: *"All people, without exception, dread death and seek life. If one informs them of their ruin, speaks of their blessings, guides them toward what would ease their condition, and opens their minds to their suffering, even those without virtue would find it difficult not to listen."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How should one treat them?"*

Qì Bó replied: *"In spring and summer, first address the superficial symptoms, then treat the root cause; in autumn and winter, first address the root cause, then treat the superficial symptoms."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How does one ease those whose conditions conflict?"*

Qì Bó replied: *"For those whose conditions conflict, their diet, clothing, and shelter should be adjusted to suit their need for cold or warmth, ensuring they are not exposed to lingering cold or excessive heat. In their food and drink, hot should not be overly scorching, and cold should not be overly piercing; if the balance of cold and warmth is appropriate, the vital qi will hold firm, and no harmful influences will take root."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"The fundamental teachings concern the body’s form, limbs, and flesh, as well as observing the relative sizes of the five viscera#3 and six palaces. Now, when addressing a ruler who ascends the throne and inquires of me, who can I press and trace to provide an answer?"*

Qì Bó replied: *"The body’s form and limbs are the coverings of the viscera and palaces, not the windows through which their conditions are observed."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I already know how the five viscera#3 manifest in the face. How can one observe their conditions through the limbs?"*

Qì Bó replied: *"The five viscera and six palaces, along with the four auxiliary organs, have the shoulders as their covering, and the hollow of the collarbone as their pathway, allowing one to observe their external manifestations."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"One more question."*

Qì Bó replied: *"The heart, which governs the five viscera and six palaces, has the sternal notch as its pathway. The [missing] bone#4, if it protrudes, indicates the condition of the diaphragm, and the [missing] bone#4, if it is excessive, reveals the state of the [missing] organ#5."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Good."*

Qì Bó replied: *"The liver, as the commander, has its condition observed externally. To determine its strength and stability, examine the size of the eyes. The [missing] organ#6, which governs the defense and calculation, has its condition observed externally. To determine its function in receiving nourishment, examine the lips and tongue for their quality and defects, and thus know the signs of fortune or misfortune."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Good."*

Qì Bó replied: *"The kidney, which governs the external aspects of the body, has its condition observed through the ability to distinguish distant sounds. To determine its nature, examine the ears for their preferences and aversions."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Good. I wish to hear how the six palaces are observed."*

Qì Bó replied: *"The stomach is like the sea, with broad shoulders, a large nape, and an expanded chest, allowing it to contain the five grains. The nostrils, if long, indicate the condition of the large intestine. Thick lips and a long philtrum indicate the condition of the small intestine. If the area below the eyes is full and rounded, the gallbladder is likely horizontal. If the nostrils are externally placed, the bladder may leak. If the nasal septum rises centrally, the sanjiao#7 is constricted. These are the ways to observe the six palaces. Above and below, in three categories, the viscera are stable and well."*

**Decision on Qi (Chapter 30)**
The Yellow Emperor said: *"I have heard that humans possess **jing** (精), **qi** (气), **jin** (津), **ye** (液), **xue** (血), and **mai** (脉). I thought these were all just one **qi**, but now they are distinguished as six. I do not understand why."*

Qìbó replied: *"The two **shen** (神) struggle and contend, then merge to form shape—this is **jing**. It is born before the body and is called **jing**."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What is **qi**?"*
Qìbó said: *"The upper **jiao** (焦) opens and spreads, disseminating the flavors of the five grains. It nourishes the skin, fills the body, and moistens the hair like mist and dew—this is **qi**."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What is **jin**?"*
Qìbó said: *"When the pores open and sweat pours out—this is **jin**."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What is **ye**?"*
Qìbó said: *"When grain enters and **qi** is full, it descends into the bones like a marsh, lubricating joints and supplementing the brain and marrow, making the skin supple—this is **ye**."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What is **xue**?"*
Qìbó said: *"The middle **jiao** receives **qi** and extracts its essence, transforming it into **xue**—this is **xue**."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What is **mai**?"*
Qìbó said: *"When **ying** (营) **qi** is obstructed and has nowhere to retreat—this is **mai**."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"If these six **qi** are in excess or deficiency, how can one know the abundance or scarcity of **qi**, the fullness or emptiness of the brain and marrow, and the clarity or turbidity of the blood and vessels?"*

Qìbó replied: *"If **jing** is depleted, hearing is impaired; if **qi** is depleted, vision is blurred; if **jin** is depleted, the pores open and sweat pours out; if **ye** is depleted, joints stiffen, the complexion dims, the brain wastes away, the spine aches, and ringing sounds are heard in the ears; if **xue** is depleted, the complexion pales and loses luster; if **mai** is depleted#3, the pulse becomes hollow and empty. These are their signs."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Among these six **qi**, which are most noble?"*
Qìbó replied: *"Each of the six **qi** has its own domain. Though their nobility and inferiority may vary, the five grains and the stomach are the greatest benefactors."*

**The Intestines and Stomach (Chapter 31)**
The Yellow Emperor asked Bó Gāo: *"I wish to hear of the intestines and stomach—how they transmit grain, their size, length, and capacity for receiving food."*

Bó Gāo replied: *"Let me explain fully. The measurements from where grain enters to where it exits are as follows: From the lips to the teeth, nine **fen**; the mouth is two **cun** wide; from the teeth to the epiglottis, three **cun** deep, with a capacity of five **ge**; the tongue weighs ten **liang**, is seven **cun** long, and two **cun** wide; the throat weighs ten **liang**, is two **cun**#4 wide, and extends sixteen **cun** to the stomach; the stomach, when stretched, is two **zhang** six **cun** long, one **zhang** five **cun** wide, and five **cun** in diameter, with a capacity of two **dou** five **sheng**; the small intestine clings to the spine, looping leftward in overlapping coils. Where it joins the **huí cháng** (回肠), it attaches above the navel, winding sixteen times in a circuit, two **cun**#5 wide, eight **fen** in diameter (minus half a **fen**), and three **zhang** three **cun**#6 long; the **huí cháng** circles the navel, looping leftward in sixteen reverse coils, four **cun** wide, one **cun** in diameter (minus half a **fen**), and two **zhang** one **cun** long; the large intestine clings to the spine, receiving the **huí cháng**, looping leftward above and below the spine, eight **cun** wide, two **cun** in diameter (plus half a **fen**), and two **zhang** eight **cun** long. From where grain enters to where it exits, the total length is six **zhang** four **cun** four **fen**, winding thirty-two times in reverse loops."*

---
**The Fasted Commoner (Chapter 32)**
The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish to know why a person dies after seven days without food."*

Bó Gāo replied: *"Let me explain. The stomach is one **zhang** five **cun** long, five **cun** in diameter, and two **zhang** six **cun** wide, capable of holding three **dou** five **sheng** of water and grain. Normally, two **dou** of grain and one **dou** five **sheng** of water remain within it. The upper **jiao** releases refined **qi**, swift and forceful, while the lower **jiao** irrigates the intestines below. The small intestine is two **cun**#5 wide, eight **fen** in diameter (minus half a **fen**), and three **zhang** two **cun** long, holding two **dou** four **sheng** of grain and six **sheng** three **ge** (plus half a **ge**) of water. The **huí cháng** is four **cun** wide, one **cun** in diameter (minus half a **fen**), and two **zhang** one **cun** long, holding one **dou** of grain and seven **sheng** half of water. The large intestine is eight **cun** wide, two **cun** in diameter (plus half a **fen**), and two **zhang** eight **cun** long, holding nine **sheng** three **ge** eight **fen** (plus one **fen**) of grain. The total length of the intestines and stomach is five **zhang** eight **cun** four **cun**, holding nine **dou** two **sheng** one **ge** (plus half a **ge**) of water and grain. In a healthy person, the stomach fills while the intestines empty, and vice versa, allowing **qi** to circulate freely. Thus, the five viscera remain stable, the blood and vessels harmonious, and the **shen** (神) resides. The **shen** is the refined **qi** of water and grain. Therefore, the intestines and stomach should retain two **dou** of grain and one **dou** five **sheng** of water. A healthy person defecates twice daily, expelling two **sheng** half each time—five **sheng** per day. Over seven days, this totals three **dou** five **sheng**, exhausting all retained water and grain. Thus, a healthy person dies after seven days without food because the refined **qi**, **jin**, and **ye** are all depleted."*

**The Sea of Discourse (Chapter 33)**
The Yellow Emperor asked Qìbó: *"I have heard of the **ci** (刺) method from Master [Zhong]. His teachings never stray from **ying** and **wei**, **xue**, and **qi**."*

The Yellow Emperor asked Qìbó: *"The twelve primary channels—do they not internally connect to the **fǔzàng** (府藏, *Storage Palaces*), and externally network with the limbs and joints? Yet you speak of harmonizing them with the four seas. How so?"*

Qìbó replied: *"Humans also possess four seas and twelve channel waters. The channel waters all converge into the seas. The seas gather the west, south, north, and east, and are thus called the four seas."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How do humans correspond to this?"*

Qìbó answered: *"Humans have the **suíhǎi** (髓海, *Bone Marrow Sea*), the **xuèhǎi** (血海, *Blood Sea*), the **qìhǎi** (气海, *Qi Sea*), and the **shuǐgǔzhīhǎi** (水谷之海, *Sea of Water and Grain*). These four correspond to the four seas."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Your teachings harmonize human and Heaven, Earth, and the four seas—how profound! I wish to hear how this correspondence is achieved."*

Qìbó replied: *"One must first clearly understand the locations of **yīn-yáng** (阴阳, *Yin-Yang*), **biǎolǐ** (表里, *Exterior-Interior*), **róng** (荣, *Nourishing*), and **shū** (输, *Converging*). Only then can the four seas be defined."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How are they defined?"*

Qìbó answered: *"The stomach is the **Sea of Water and Grain** (水谷之海), its converging point above at **qìjiē** (气街, *Qi Street*), below at **sānlǐ** (三里, *Three Li*).
The **chōngmài** (冲脉, *Penetrating Vessel*) is the **Sea of the Twelve Channels** (十二经之海), its converging point above at **dàzhù** (大杼, *Great Zhu*), below emerging at **jùxū** (巨虚, *Great Emptiness*) above and below at **lián** (廉, *Flanks).
**Tánzhōng** (膻中, *Mid-Chest*) is the **Sea of Qi** (气之海), its converging point above at the **zhùgǔ** (柱骨, *Pillar Bone*) above and below, and forward at **rényíng** (人迎, *Welcome of Man).
The brain is the **Sea of Bone Marrow** (髓之海), its converging point above at its **cover**, below at **fēngfǔ** (风府, *Wind Palace)."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What benefits or harms arise from these four seas? What causes life or decay?"*

Qìbó replied: *"When they are in harmony, life ensues; when they are contrary, decay follows. When one knows how to regulate them, benefit arises; when one does not, harm ensues."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How do the four seas become contrary or harmonious?"*

Qìbó replied: *"If the **Qi Sea** (气海) is in excess, the **qi** swells in the chest, causing **yùxī** (悦息, *Contented Breathing*) and flushed face.
If the **Qi Sea** is deficient, the **qi** is scarce, insufficient even for speech.
If the **Blood Sea** (血海) is in excess, one constantly feels their body is large, agitated yet unaware of their illness.
If the **Blood Sea** is deficient, one also constantly feels their body is small, constricted yet unaware of their illness.
If the **Sea of Water and Grain** (水谷之海) is in excess, the abdomen is full.
If the **Sea of Water and Grain** is deficient, hunger persists, yet one cannot accept nourishment.
If the **Bone Marrow Sea** (髓海) is in excess, one feels light and nimble, with abundant strength, surpassing their natural limits.
If the **Bone Marrow Sea** is deficient, the brain spins, ears ring, channels ache with vertigo and dizziness, vision fails, and one lies sluggishly, content in repose."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"I have already heard of contrary and harmonious states. How does one regulate them?"*

Qìbó replied: *"Carefully observe their converging points, and regulate their excesses and deficiencies. Avoid violating their principles—when in harmony, they restore balance; when contrary, they lead to decay."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Well spoken."*

**Chapter 34: The Five Disorders**
The Yellow Emperor asked: *"The twelve channels, categorized under the five elements and divided into the four seasons—what causes their disorder? What brings their healing?"*

Qìbó replied: *"The five elements have their sequence, the four seasons their divisions. When they align, harmony prevails; when they conflict, disorder arises."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What do you mean by alignment?"*

Qìbó replied: *"The twelve channels correspond to the twelve months. The twelve months are divided into the four seasons—spring, autumn, winter, and summer—each with its distinct **qi**. The **yíngwèi** (营卫, *Nourishing-Defensive*) follow their cycles, **yīn-yáng** (阴阳) are in balance, and the **qīngzhuó** (清浊, *Pure-Turbid*) do not interfere. Thus, alignment leads to harmony."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What do you mean by conflict and disorder?"*

Qìbó replied: *"When pure **qi** resides in **yīn** (阴) and turbid **qi** in **yáng** (阳), the **yíng** (营, *Nourishing Qi*) flows along the channels, while the **wèi** (卫, *Defensive Qi*) moves contrary. When pure and turbid **qi** interfere, disorder arises in the chest—this is called **dàyù** (大悦, *Great Delight*).
Thus, when **qi** is disordered in the heart, one suffers **fánxīn mìhē** (烦心密嘿, *Anxious Heart and Silent Speech*), bows their head, and lies still.
When **qi** is disordered in the lungs, one pants and gasps, raising their hands while inhaling.
When **qi** is disordered in the intestines and stomach, it causes **huòluàn** (霍乱, *Sudden Turmoil*).
When **qi** is disordered in the arm channels, it leads to **sìjué** (四厥, *Four Reversals*).
When **qi** is disordered in the head, it results in **jué nì** (厥逆, *Reversed Collapse*), heaviness of the head, vertigo, and falling."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Are there methods to treat the Five Disorders through **ci** (刺, *acupuncture)?"*

Qìbó replied: *"There are methods to approach and to withdraw—when one discerns their proper application, they hold the key to preserving life."*

When **qi** resides in the heart, treat it at the **Shǎo Yīn** (*Hand Lesser Yin*) channel’s **Shǔ** (*Output*) point of the **Heart Governor**.
When **qi** resides in the lungs, treat it at the **Tài Yīn** (*Hand Greater Yin*) channel’s **Róng** (*Nourishing*) point and the **Shǎo Yīn** (*Foot Lesser Yin*) channel’s **Shǔ** (*Output*) point.
When **qi** resides in the intestines and stomach, treat it at the **Tài Yīn** (*Foot Greater Yin*) and **Yáng Míng** (*Yang Brightness*) channels; if the disorder persists below, treat it at **Sān Lǐ** (*Three Miles*).
When **qi** resides in the head, treat it at **Tiān Zhù** (*Heavenly Pillar*) and **Dà Zhù** (*Great Pillar*); if the disorder persists, treat it at the **Tài Yáng** (*Foot Greater Yang*) channel’s **Róng** (*Nourishing*) and **Shǔ** (*Output*) points.
When **qi** resides in the arms and legs, first clear the blood vessels, then treat the **Yáng Míng** (*Yang Brightness*) and **Shǎo Yáng** (*Lesser Yang*) channels’ **Róng** (*Nourishing*) and **Shǔ** (*Output*) points.

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How does one apply reinforcement and reduction?"*

Qìbó replied: *"Slow insertion and slow withdrawal—this is called **dǎo qì** (导气, *Guiding Qi*). Reinforcement and reduction without form—this is called **tóng jīng** (同精, *Harmonizing Essence*). It is not about excess or deficiency, but about the disordered **qi** clashing in opposition."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"This is a profound Dao, a clear theory. May I record it on jade tablets and name it *Treatise on Regulating Disorders*?"

**Chapter Thirty-Five: Treatise on Distension**

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How does the pulse at the **cùnkǒu** (*wrist*) manifest in distension?"*

Qìbó replied: *"When the pulse is large, firm, and rough, this is distension."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How does one recognize distension in the **zàngfǔ** (*zang-fu organs*)?"*

Qìbó replied: *"The **yīn** (*yin*) pertains to the **zàng** (*zang*), the **yáng** (*yang*) to the **fǔ** (*fu*)."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Does the **qi** that causes distension reside within the blood vessels, or within the **zàngfǔ** (*zang-fu organs*)?"*

Qìbó replied: *"Both exist, yet neither is the dwelling place of distension."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Then where does distension dwell?"*

Qìbó replied: *"Distension resides outside the **zàngfǔ** (*zang-fu organs*), pressing against them like a wall around the chest and ribs, swelling the skin. Hence, it is called *distension*."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"..."*

*"The **zàngfǔ** (*zang-fu organs*) lie within the chest, ribs, and abdomen like treasures locked in a chest—each has its proper place, though their names differ while their locations coincide. Within a single domain, their **qi** varies. I wish to hear the reason."*

The Yellow Emperor asked again: *"Explain its meaning."*

Qìbó replied: *"The chest and abdomen are the outer enclosure of the **zàngfǔ** (*zang-fu organs*).
**Shàn Zhōng** (*Mid-Chest*) is the palace of the **Heart Governor**.
The **stomach** is the **Tài Cāng** (*Great Granary*).
The **throat and small intestine** serve as conduits for transmission.
The **five apertures of the stomach** are the inner gates and doors.
**Lián Quán** (*Adam’s Apple*) and **Yù Yīng** (*Jade Flower*) are the pathways of **jīn yè** (*body fluids*).
Thus, the **wǔ zàng liù fǔ** (*Five Zang and Six Fu*) each have their boundaries, and their diseases each have distinct forms.

When **yíng qì** (*Nourishing Qi*) flows through the vessels and **wèi qì** (*Defensive Qi*) moves counter to the pulse, it causes **pulse distension**. When **wèi qì** merges with the pulse and follows the **fēn** (*muscle layers*), it causes **skin distension**.
For reduction, three treatments suffice: near disorders require one treatment, distant disorders require three. Whether **xū** (*deficient*) or **shí** (*excess*), the skill lies in swift reduction."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"I wish to hear the forms of distension."*

Qìbó replied: *"When the **heart** is distended, one suffers **fánxīn** (*anxious heart*), shortness of breath, and restless sleep.
When the **lungs** are distended, there is a hollow fullness with wheezing and coughing.
When the **liver** is distended, the ribs ache with pain radiating to the lower abdomen.
When the **spleen** is distended, one yawns frequently, the limbs feel restless and weary, the body feels heavy and unable to wear clothing, and one cannot stand still.
When the **kidneys** are distended, the abdomen is full with pain radiating to the lower back, and the lumbar region aches.

Distension of the **six fu**:
When the **stomach** is distended, the abdomen is full, the **stomach’s courtyard** aches, the nose detects a burnt odor, eating is hindered, and defecation is difficult.
When the **large intestine** is distended, the intestines rumble with a painful, splashing sensation; in winter, excessive cold exposure leads to **fěn xiè** (*undigested food in stool*).
When the **small intestine** is distended, the lower abdomen is taut and swollen, with pain radiating to the waist.
When the **bladder** is distended, the lower abdomen is full with **qì yì** (*urinary urgency*).
When the **triple burner** is distended, **qi** fills the skin, causing a light, floating sensation without firmness.
When the **gallbladder** is distended, the ribs ache with bitterness in the mouth and a tendency to sigh deeply.

All these forms of distension share a single principle: clarity in discerning **nì shùn** (*reversed and顺 proper flow*), and precision in needle count.
Reduce the **xū** (*deficient*), reinforce the **shí** (*excess*), guide the **shén** (*spirit*) from its chamber—when **xié** (*evil*) displaces **zhèng** (*right*), the **zhēn** (*true*) cannot be fixed. Such recklessness shortens life.
Reinforce the **xū** (*deficient*), reduce the **shí** (*excess*), restore the **shén** (*spirit*) to its chamber, and seal the void for long endurance—this is the mark of a master physician."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Where does distension originate? What causes it?"*

Qìbó replied: *"The **wèi qì** (*Defensive Qi*) in the body normally flows alongside the pulse and through the muscle layers, moving with proper **shùn** (*sequence*) and **nì** (*reversal*), following **yīn-yáng** (*yin-yang*) harmony. Thus, the **wǔ zàng** (*Five Zang*) renew in cycles, the **sì jì** (*Four Seasons*) follow order, and the **wǔ gǔ** (*Five Grains*) transform. Only then does **jué qì** (*Reversed Qi*) settle below, **yíng-wèi** (*Nourishing-Defensive Qi*) stagnate, **hán qì** (*Cold Qi*) rise counterflow, and **zhēn-xié** (*True-Evil Qi*) clash. When the two **qi** (*qi forces*) contend, distension forms."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Excellent. How does one resolve confusion?"*

Qìbó replied: *"When aligned with the True, the three alignments are achieved."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Excellent."*

The Yellow Emperor asked Qìbó: *"The treatise on distension states: 'Regardless of excess or deficiency, the practitioner must swiftly drain. For nearby cases, one treatment suffices; for distant cases, three are needed. Yet if one applies three treatments and the distension does not subside, what is the error?'*

Qìbó responded: *"This refers to cases where the needle penetrates only the flesh and misses the central *qì* orifice. If the central *qì* orifice is not struck, the *qì* becomes internally obstructed. If the needle does not pierce the *huāng* (deep muscle layer), the *qì* cannot flow freely. If it passes only through the superficial flesh, the Defensive *qì* becomes disordered, and yin-yáng forces clash. In such cases, though drainage is required, it is not performed, so the *qì* does not descend. When three treatments fail to relieve the distension, one must alter the approach—only then will the *qì* descend. If it still does not descend, begin anew, and all will be secure. How could there be any danger?*

*In treating distension, one must carefully examine the pulse. If drainage is called for, drain; if supplementation is needed, supplement. Like the drum responding to the *gēng* (a percussion instrument), how could the distension fail to resolve?"*

**Chapter 36: *Wǔ Xiàn Lǜ Yè* – Distinguishing the Five Fluids**

The Yellow Emperor asked Qìbó:
*"When water and grain enter the mouth, they are transported to the intestines and stomach. Their fluids separate into five forms. In cold weather, with thin clothing, they become urine and gas; in hot weather, with thick clothing, they become sweat. When grief and sorrow converge, they become tears. When internal heat slackens the stomach, they become saliva. When perverse *qì* ascends in reverse, it obstructs the flow, and if the flow is blocked, it becomes water distension. I understand this, but I do not know how these conditions arise. I wish to hear the Way."*

Qìbó replied:
*"All water and grain enter the mouth, and their five flavors each flow to their respective reservoirs. Their fluids then follow their designated paths. Thus, the Three Burners exhale *qì* to warm the muscles and flesh, filling the skin—this is their *tīn* (moisture). What flows but does not circulate becomes *yè* (fluid).

When the weather is hot and clothing is thick, the pores open, and sweat emerges. If cold seeps between the muscles, phlegm accumulates and causes pain.

When the weather is cold, the pores close, and *qì* stagnates. Water descends into the bladder, becoming urine and gas.

The Five *Zàng* and Six *Fǔ* have the heart as their sovereign, the ears as their sentinels, the eyes as their marshals, the lungs as their ministers, the liver as their generals, the spleen as their guardians, and the kidneys as their external rulers.

Thus, the fluids of the Five *Zàng* and Six *Fǔ* all ascend to moisten the eyes. When the heart grieves and *qì* converges, the heart’s cords tighten. When the heart’s cords tighten, the lungs rise, and when the lungs rise, fluid overflows. The heart’s cords and lungs cannot constantly rise—sometimes ascending, sometimes descending—thus, coughing and weeping occur.

When internal heat consumes grain in the stomach, worms move erratically, filling the intestines and stomach, causing the stomach to slacken. When the stomach slackens, *qì* reverses, and saliva emerges.

The fluids of the Five Grains, harmonized and refined, seep into the bone cavities, nourishing the marrow and descending to the groin. If *yin* and *yáng* are disharmonious, fluid overflows and descends to the groin, draining the marrow. If this descends excessively, it causes emptiness, leading to lower back pain and cramping of the sinews.

When the *yin-yáng* pathways are blocked, the Four Seas are sealed, the Three Burners are not drained, and fluids are not metabolized, water and grain move together through the intestines and stomach. Separating at the *huí cháng* (ileum), they lodge in the lower burner, unable to seep into the bladder. Thus, the lower burner distends, and fluid overflow causes water distension. This is the order and disorder of the five separated fluids."*

**Chapter 37: *Wǔ Yuè Wǔ Shǐ* – The Five Orifices and Their Functions**

The Yellow Emperor asked Qìbó:
*"I have heard that acupuncture has five orifices and five gates to observe the five *qì*. These five *qì* are the functions of the Five *Zàng* and the counterparts of the five seasons. I wish to hear where their functions manifest."*

Qìbó replied:
*"The five orifices are the gates of the Five *Zàng*."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"I wish to hear where they emerge, so that their patterns may be established."*

Qìbó replied:
*"The pulse emerges at the *qì kǒu* (collarbone region), and color appears in the *míng táng* (forehead). The five colors alternate in appearance, corresponding to the five seasons, each according to its regularity. When the *jīng qì* enters the *Zàng*, it must be treated within the interior."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"Excellent. Are the five colors solely determined by the *míng táng*?"*

Qìbó replied:
*"When the five orifices are distinct, the *quē tíng* (nasal cavity) expands, and the *míng táng* is established. The *míng táng* is broad and vast, its shadows visible from afar. Its walls are high and its foundation deep, with drooping corners extending outward. When the five colors are properly aligned, the forehead is level, broad, and vast—such a person will live to a hundred. Those who see this should be treated with acupuncture, for such individuals have abundant *xuè-qì*, firm and dense flesh, and can endure strong needle techniques."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"I wish to hear of the five orifices."*

Qìbó replied:
*"The nose is the orifice of the lungs; the eyes, of the liver; the lips, of the spleen; the tongue, of the heart; and the ears, of the kidneys."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"How do we diagnose through these orifices?"*

Qìbó replied:
*"By observing the Five *Zàng*. Thus, when the lungs are diseased, breathing is labored and the nostrils flare; when the liver is diseased, the sclera turns yellowish-green; when the spleen is diseased, the lips turn yellow; when the heart is diseased, the tongue curls and shortens, its edges reddening; and when the kidneys are diseased, the face and cheeks darken."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"Where do the five pulses emerge, and where do the five colors appear? What are the constant and perilous signs?"*

Qìbó replied:
*"When the five orifices are indistinct, the *quē tíng* does not expand, the *míng táng* is small, its shadows are not visible, and its walls are low and unstable. The drooping corners retreat inward. Such a person, though appearing ordinary, is in grave danger—death will come swiftly."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"When the five colors appear in the *míng táng*, do they reveal the *qì* of the Five *Zàng* in terms of left-right and high-low positions, each with its own form?"*

Qìbó replied:
*"The *Zàng* and *Fǔ* within the body each occupy their proper stations, with left, right, high, and low all following their due measures."*

**Chapter 38: *Nì Shùn Féi Shòu* – Diagnosing Order, Disorder, Fatness, and Emaciation**

The Yellow Emperor asked Qìbó:
*"I have learned the Dao of acupuncture from you, and it is now fully mastered. Your teachings seem effortless yet are unshakably firm. Was your study thorough, or did you intuitively perceive patterns through observation?"*

Qìbó replied:
*"The Sage’s Way aligns above with Heaven, below with Earth, and in the middle with human affairs. It must have clear laws to establish measures and standards. Only then can it be verified and transmitted.

Thus, a carpenter cannot abandon the ruler and measure lengths arbitrarily, nor discard the plumb line and level water by eye. A craftsman cannot abandon the compass to draw circles or the square to make right angles.

Those who understand this use natural principles—easy teachings that govern the constants of order and disorder."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish to hear of the natural principles in practice."*

Qìbó replied: *"When probing the *Rú* water#2, one need not exert effort—yet the water can be exhausted. Following the *Décuì*#3 and *Cìchōng*#4 channels, the *jīng*#5 may be made to flow. This refers to the smoothness and roughness of *qi*, the clarity and turbidity of blood, and the ebb and flow of their movement."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish to hear of the variations in humans—white or black, fat or lean, small or tall—each having its own measure?"*

Qìbó replied: *"For those of robust constitution and strong vitality, whose flesh and skin are firm, if *xié*#6 has been added, one must needle deeply and dwell. These are the fat individuals. For those with broad shoulders and shallow armpits, thin necks, thick black skin, and full lips—whose blood is dark and turbid, whose *qi* is rough and sluggish, and who are greedy in giving and taking—one must needle deeply and dwell, increasing the number of points."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How does one needle the lean?"*

Qìbó replied: *"The lean have thin skin, little color, sparse flesh, and light speech. Their blood is clear and their *qi* smooth, easily detached from the *qi* and easily depleted in blood. One must needle shallowly and swiftly."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How does one needle the average?"*

Qìbó replied: *"Observe their white and black hues, and adjust accordingly. Those whose features are balanced and harmonious have *qi* and blood in accord. One must not deviate from the standard measures when needling these."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How does one needle a vigorous warrior with true bones?"*

Qìbó replied: *"When needling a vigorous warrior with true bones—whose flesh is firm and joints relaxed—if he is heavy, his *qi* is rough and his blood turbid. One must needle deeply and dwell, increasing the number of points. If he is agile, his *qi* is smooth and his blood clear. One must needle shallowly and swiftly."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How does one needle an infant?"*

Qìbó replied: *"Infants have tender flesh, little blood, and weak *qi*. One must use a fine needle, needle shallowly, and withdraw swiftly. Twice daily suffices."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"What of probing the *Rú* water?"*

Qìbó replied: *"If the blood is clear and the *qi* turbid, and one drains swiftly, the *qi* will be exhausted."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"What of following the *Décuì* and *Cìchōng* channels?"*

Qìbó replied: *"If the blood is turbid and the *qi* rough, and one drains swiftly, the *jīng*#5 may be made to flow."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"What of the pulse’s inverse or顺#7 movement?"*

Qìbó replied: *"The three *Yīn* pulses of the hand flow from the *zàng*#8 to the hand; the three *Yáng* pulses of the hand flow from the hand to the head; the three *Yáng* pulses of the foot flow from the head to the foot; the three *Yīn* pulses of the foot flow from the foot to the abdomen. The Yellow Emperor said: ‘Why does the *Shàoyīn* pulse alone descend?’ Qìbó replied: ‘Not so! The *Chōng* pulse is the sea of the five *zàng*#8 and six *fǔ*#9. All five *zàng* and six *fǔ* draw from it. Its upward flow emerges at the *tóu*#10, permeating all *Yáng* channels, nourishing all the *jīng*#11. Its downward flow enters the great network of the *Shàoyīn*, emerging at the *qìjiē*#12, descending along the inner *lián*#13 of the *yín*#14 stock, penetrating the *bīn*#15, and running concealed within the *jiàn*#16 bone, descending to the posterior of the inner *lì*#17, then diverging. Its downward flow also merges with the *Shàoyīn* channel, permeating the three *Yīn* pulses. Its anterior flow runs concealed, emerging at the *fǔ*#18 network, descending along the *fǔ*#18, and entering the space between the great toe. It permeates all networks and warms the flesh and muscles. Thus, if the divergent network is obstructed, the *fǔ*#18 network above does not move. If it does not move, there is *jué*#19, and if *jué*#19 occurs, there is cold."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How can this be verified?"*

Qìbó replied: *"By guiding the speech and testing the pulse. If the pulse does not move when pressed, then one can clarify the inverse flow of the *jīng*#11."*

The Yellow Emperor exclaimed: *"How profound! The Sage’s Way is clear as the sun and moon, subtle as the finest hairs. Were it not for Master, who else could teach it?"*

**Blood Network Treatise, Thirty-Ninth**

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish to hear of those strange *xié*#6 that do not lie along the channels."*

Qìbó replied: *"The blood networks are those."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"If one needles the blood networks and the patient collapses, why is that? If blood spurts out upon needling, why is that? If blood is scant, dark, and turbid, why is that? If blood emerges clear and half turns to fluid, why is that? If withdrawal of the needle causes swelling, why is that? If blood emerges in varying amounts while the face turns pale, why is that? If withdrawal of the needle leaves the face unchanged but the patient feels agitated and pleased, why is that? If much blood is drawn yet the pulse remains unmoved, why is that? I wish to hear the reasons."*

**Blood Network Treatise, Thirty-Ninth (continued)**

Qìbó replied:
*"When the pulse-qi is robust yet the blood is deficient, needling will cause the patient to lose their vital breath—losing breath causes collapse. When both blood and qi are abundant but yin-qi predominates, the blood becomes slippery, and needling causes it to spurt forth. When yang-qi stagnates and lingers without release, the blood grows dark and turbid, so it cannot spurt. When one has recently drunk, the liquid seeps into the networks before blending with the blood, so the blood emerges while the fluid separates. Those who have not recently drunk but harbor internal dampness will develop swelling over time. When yin-qi accumulates in the yang, its force courses through the networks, so needling causes the qi to move before the blood emerges, resulting in swelling. When yin and yang newly converge but have not yet harmonized, and one then drains them, both yin and yang are depleted, separating exterior and interior—thus the face pales and takes on a wan hue. When much blood is drawn, the complexion remains unchanged, yet the patient feels agitated and pleased—this is because needling the networks depletes the channels. The channels’ yin aspects, when depleted, cause agitation and vexation. When yin and yang converge to form stagnation, this is internal overflow into the channels and external pooling in the networks. In such cases, both yin and yang are in excess, so even if much blood is drawn, it cannot be fully depleted."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How does one diagnose this?"*

Qìbó replied:
*"The blood vessels are robust, firm and horizontal with a crimson hue, wandering without fixed location—small as a needle, large as a sinew. Needling them with precision ensures complete efficacy. Thus, one must never miscount. If miscounted and corrected, each must return to its proper measure."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"When the needle enters and adheres to the flesh, why is that?"*

Qìbó replied:
*"When heated qi adheres to the needle, the needle grows warm, and warmth causes the flesh to cling to it, making it firm."*

**Clear and Turbid Qi, Fortieth**

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I have heard that the twelve channels correspond to the twelve tributary waters, yet their five colors differ, and their clarity and turbidity vary. If a person’s blood and qi are uniform, how do they correspond?"*

Qìbó replied:
*"If a person’s blood and qi could truly be uniform, then all under heaven would be one—how could there be disorder?"*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I ask of one person, not of the multitude of the world."*

Qìbó replied:
*"Even one person may have disordered qi, just as the multitude may contain disordered individuals—they are but one in essence."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish to hear of human qi’s clarity and turbidity."*

Qìbó replied:
*"That which receives grain is turbid; that which receives breath is clear. The clear ascends to yin, the turbid descends to yang. When turbid yet clear, it rises to the throat; when clear yet turbid, it flows downward. When clarity and turbidity intermingle, it is called disordered qi."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"If yin is clear and yang is turbid, yet turbid contains clarity and clear contains turbidity, how does one distinguish them?"*

Qìbó replied:
*"The great distinction of qi is this: the clear ascends to the lungs, the turbid descends to the stomach. The stomach’s clear qi rises through the mouth; the lungs’ turbid qi descends into the channels, accumulating in the sea."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"All yang channels are turbid—why is the hand’s Greater Yang most turbid?"*

Qìbó replied:
*"The hand’s Greater Yang alone receives the turbidity of yang; the hand’s Lesser Yin alone receives the clarity of yin. Its clarity ascends to the hollow cavities, its turbidity descends through the channels. All yin channels are clear, yet the foot’s Lesser Yin and Second Lesser Yin uniquely receive their turbidity."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How does one treat this?"*

Qìbó replied:
*"The clear qi is slippery, the turbid qi is rough—this is the nature of qi. Thus, when needling yin, one must go deep and dwell; when needling yang, one must go shallow and swiftly. When clarity and turbidity intermingle alone, one regulates them with the proper count."*

**[Phonetic Note]** *"悦"* sounds like *"闷"* (agitation/vexation).

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I have heard that Heaven is yang, Earth is yin, the Sun is yang, and the Moon is yin. How do these correspond in the human body?"*

Qìbó replied: *"Above the waist is Heaven, below the waist is Earth. Thus, Heaven is yang, Earth is yin. The twelve meridians of the feet correspond to the twelve months—since the Moon is born from water, those below are yin. The ten fingers of the hands correspond to the ten days—since the Sun governs fire, those above are yang."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How do these correspond to the meridians?"*

Qìbó replied:
*"Yin (寅), the birth of yang in the first month, governs the left foot’s Lesser Yang.
*Wèi* (未), the sixth month, governs the right foot’s Lesser Yang.
*Mǎo* (卯), the second month, governs the left foot’s Greater Yang.
*Wǔ* (午), the fifth month, governs the right foot’s Greater Yang.
*Chén* (辰), the third month, governs the left foot’s Bright Yang.
*Sì* (巳), the fourth month, governs the right foot’s Bright Yang—these two yangs converge in the front, hence *Bright Yang*.
*Shēn* (申), the birth of yin in the seventh month, governs the right foot’s Lesser Yin.
*Chǒu* (丑), the twelfth month, governs the left foot’s Lesser Yin.
*Yǒu* (酉), the eighth month, governs the right foot’s Greater Yin.
*Zǐ* (子), the eleventh month, governs the left foot’s Greater Yin.
*Xū* (戌), the ninth month, governs the right foot’s Obstructed Yin.
*Hài* (亥), the tenth month, governs the left foot’s Obstructed Yin—these two yins exhaust each other, hence *Obstructed Yin*.

*Jiǎ* governs the left hand’s Lesser Yang, *jǐ* the right hand’s Lesser Yang.
*Yǐ* governs the left hand’s Greater Yang, *wù* the right hand’s Greater Yang.
*Bǐng* governs the left hand’s Bright Yang, *dīng* the right hand’s Bright Yang—these two fires unite, hence *Bright Yang*.
*Gēng* governs the right hand’s Lesser Yin, *guǐ* the left hand’s Lesser Yin.
*Xīn* governs the right hand’s Greater Yin, *rén* the left hand’s Greater Yin.

Thus, the foot’s yang is the Lesser Yang within yin;
the foot’s yin is the Greater Yin within yin.
The hand’s yang is the Greater Yang within yang;
the hand’s yin is the Lesser Yin within yang.

Above the waist is yang, below the waist is yin.
As for the five viscera:
The heart is the Greater Yang within yang,
the lung is the Lesser Yin within yang,
the liver is the Lesser Yang within yin,
the spleen is the Ultimate Yin within yin,
the kidney is the Greater Yin within yin.

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How does one treat this?"*

Qìbó replied:
*"In the first, second, and third months, vital qi resides on the left—do not needle the left foot’s yang meridians.
In the fourth, fifth, and sixth months, vital qi resides on the right—do not needle the right foot’s yang meridians.
In the seventh, eighth, and ninth months, vital qi resides on the right—do not needle the right foot’s yin meridians.
In the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth months, vital qi resides on the left—do not needle the left foot’s yin meridians."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"The Five Phases assign *jiǎ* and *yǐ* (wood) as rulers of spring, spring being the azure color, governing the liver—the foot’s Obstructed Yin. Yet you say *jiǎ* governs the left hand’s Lesser Yang—how does this accord with the sequence?"*

Qìbó replied: *"This is the yin-yang of Heaven and Earth, not the sequential progression of the Four Seasons and Five Phases. Moreover, yin and yang are nameless yet formless—count them as ten, divide them as a hundred, scatter them as a thousand, extend them as ten thousand. This is what is meant."*

**Chapter 42: Transmission of Disease**

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I have received the Nine Needles from my teacher and privately studied various methods—such as guiding and leading *qi*, massage, moxibustion, warming, needling, cauterization, and medicinal drinks. May one practice only one method, or must all be employed?"*

Qìbó replied: *"These are the methods of the common people, not the exclusive practice of one individual."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"This is what is meant by ‘holding fast to one without loss, all things accomplished.’ Now that I have heard the essentials of yin and yang, the principles of emptiness and fullness, the excesses of imbalance, and the categories of treatable diseases, I wish to hear of diseases that vary, spread excessively, or are severed and ruined beyond treatment. May I hear of these?"*

Qìbó replied: *"Your question is profound! The Dao shines like awakening at dawn, yet is constrained like night’s darkness. If one wears it and serves it, the spirit is complete; if one exhausts it, the spirit finds itself. The principles of life’s spirit can be inscribed on bamboo and silk, yet cannot be transmitted to descendants."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"What is meant by ‘awakening at dawn’?"*

Qìbó replied: *"Clarity in yin and yang, like the resolution of confusion, like sobering from drunkenness."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"What is meant by ‘night’s darkness’?"*

Qìbó replied: *"Silent as a wound without sound, formless as mist—disrupting hair and pores, vital *qi* tilting wildly, perverse pathogens floating and spreading, blood and vessels transmitting errantly, great *qi* entering the viscera, abdominal pain descending into excess—this can lead to death, not life."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How does great *qi* entering the viscera manifest?"*

Qìbó replied: *"If disease first arises in the heart, it spreads to the lung in one day, to the liver in three days, to the spleen in five days. If it persists beyond three days, death follows. At winter’s midnight, or summer’s noon.

If disease first arises in the lung, it spreads to the liver in three days, to the spleen in one day, to the stomach in five days. If it persists beyond ten days, death follows."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"At winter’s solstice, it enters; at summer’s noon, it exits."*

If disease first arises in the **liver** (*gān*), it spreads to the **spleen** (*pí*) in three days, to the **stomach** (*wèi*) in five days, to the **kidneys** (*shèn*) in three days. If it persists beyond three days, death follows.

At winter’s solstice, it enters; at summer’s dawn, one should eat lightly.

If disease first arises in the **spleen** (*pí*), it spreads to the **stomach** (*wèi*) in one day, to the **kidneys** (*shèn*) in two days, to the **bladder** (*pángguāng*) in three days. If it persists beyond ten days, death follows.

At winter’s night’s end, at summer’s late meal.

If disease first arises in the **stomach** (*wèi*), it spreads to the **kidneys** (*shèn*) in five days, to the **bladder** (*pángguāng*) in three days, then ascends to the **heart** (*xīn*) in five days. If it persists beyond two days, death follows.

At winter’s midnight, at summer’s noonday.

If disease first arises in the **kidneys** (*shèn*), it spreads to the **bladder** (*pángguāng*) in three days, then ascends to the **heart** (*xīn*) in three days, to the **small intestine** (*xiǎocháng*) in three days. If it persists beyond three days, death follows.

At winter’s great dawn, at summer’s early morning.

All diseases transmit in sequence to the **viscera** (*zàng*). Such cases all have a fixed death period and may not be pricked. If the disease affects one **viscus** (*zàng*), or two, three, four, then pricking may be applied.

**Chapter 43: Excessive Pathogenic Factors and Dreaming**

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish to hear how excessive pathogenic factors (*yínxié*) manifest as dreams."*

Qibo replied: *"When pathogenic factors invade from the outside and have not yet settled in a fixed location, they wander excessively among the **viscera** (*zàng*), unable to remain in one place. They move with the **honorific vessels** (*róng*) and **defensive vessels** (*wèi*), and with the **soul** (*hún*) and **spirit** (*pò*), causing the person to feel restless externally and experience vivid dreams.

When **qi** is excessive in the **bowels** (*fǔ*), there is surplus externally and deficiency internally. When **qi** is excessive in the **viscera** (*zàng*), there is surplus internally and deficiency externally."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How does this surplus and deficiency manifest?"*

Qibo replied:
*"When **yin qi** is excessive, one dreams of crossing vast waters in fear.
When **yang qi** is excessive, one dreams of great fires and blazing light.
When both **yin** and **yang** are excessive, one dreams of mutual destruction.

If the upper body is excessive, one dreams of flying.
If the lower body is excessive, one dreams of falling.
Extreme hunger causes dreams of taking.
Extreme satiety causes dreams of giving.
Excessive **liver qi** causes dreams of anger.
Excessive **lung qi** causes dreams of terror, weeping, or wild flight.
Excessive **heart qi** causes dreams of laughter, fear, and sudden fright.
Excessive **spleen qi** causes dreams of singing and dancing, with a heavy body that cannot be lifted.
Excessive **kidney qi** causes dreams of the lumbar and sacral regions dissolving and disconnecting.

For these twelve cases of excess, when they arise, they may be **drained** (*xiě*), and the condition will immediately resolve.

When **ulterior qi** (*juéqi*) lodges in the **heart** (*xīn*), one dreams of hills, mountains, and fire.
When it lodges in the **lungs** (*fèi*), one dreams of flight and sees strange metallic objects.
When it lodges in the **liver** (*gān*), one dreams of mountains, forests, and trees.
When it lodges in the **spleen** (*pí*), one dreams of hills, marshes, collapsing houses, and wind and rain.
When it lodges in the **kidneys** (*shèn*), one dreams of standing at the edge of a precipice or drowning in water.
When it lodges in the **bladder** (*pángguāng*), one dreams of wandering.
When it lodges in the **stomach** (*wèi*), one dreams of eating and drinking.
When it lodges in the **large intestine** (*dàcháng*), one dreams of fields and wildlands.
When it lodges in the **small intestine** (*xiǎocháng*), one dreams of crowded marketplaces and crossroads.
When it lodges in the **gallbladder** (*dǎn*), one dreams of lawsuits or self-mutilation.
When it lodges in the **external genitalia** (*yīnqì*), one dreams of sexual intercourse.
When it lodges in the **neck** (*jǐng*), one dreams of decapitation.
When it lodges in the **channels** (*jīng*), one dreams of walking but unable to proceed, or being trapped in deep valleys or graveyards.
When it lodges in the **thighs and arms** (*gǔgāng*), one dreams of rituals, bowing, and rising.
When it lodges in the **uterus** (*bāozhí*), the **vital essence** (*shēngqì*) is divided, and one dreams of drowning or incontinence.

For these cases of deficiency with fixed patterns (*shù*), when they arise, they may be **supplemented** (*bǔ*), and the condition will immediately resolve."*

---

**Chapter 44: The Four Seasons and Disease Progression**

The Yellow Emperor said: *"The origin of all diseases must arise from dryness, dampness, cold, heat, wind, and rain, as well as from the emotions of joy and anger, and from diet, residence, and the convergence of **qi** into form. When they settle in the **viscera**, they take on names. I understand this. But why do most diseases begin with morning clarity, daytime ease, evening worsening, and nighttime severity?"*

Qibo replied: *"This is due to the influence of the four seasonal **qi**."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish to hear how the four seasonal **qi** operate."*

Qibo replied: *"Spring generates, summer grows, autumn harvests, and winter stores—this is the constant pattern of **qi**. Humans follow it accordingly. Dividing a single day into the four seasons: morning corresponds to spring, noon to summer, evening to autumn, and midnight to winter.

In the morning, human **qi** begins to generate, while pathogenic **qi** weakens—hence morning clarity.
At noon, human **qi** flourishes and overcomes pathogenic factors—hence ease.
In the evening, human **qi** begins to decline, while pathogenic **qi** emerges—hence worsening.
At midnight, human **qi** retreats into the **viscera**, while pathogenic **qi** dominates the body—hence severity."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"But sometimes the pattern reverses—why is this?"*

Qibo replied: *"This occurs when the body does not conform to the seasonal **qi**, and a single **viscus** dominates the disease. Such cases worsen when the **viscus** is weak against the season and improve when it is strong."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How should one treat this?"*

Qibo replied: *"Align with the natural seasons, and the disease’s progression can be predicted. Those who follow this principle are skilled; those who oppose it are crude."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Excellent."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I have heard that acupuncture has five variations to govern the five *shu*-points. I wish to hear their principles."*

Qibo replied: *"Humans have five viscera, and the five viscera have five variations. These five variations govern five *shu*-points, thus making twenty-five *shu*-points to correspond with the five seasons."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish to hear of the five variations."*

Qibo replied: *"The liver is a *male* viscus, its color green, its season spring, its tone *jue*, its flavor sour, and its days *jia* and *yi*;
the heart is a *male* viscus, its color red, its season summer, its days *bing* and *ding*, its tone *zheng*, its flavor bitter;
the spleen is a *female* viscus, its color yellow, its season late summer, its days *wu* and *ji*, its tone *gong*, its flavor sweet;
the lung is a *female* viscus, its color white, its tone *shang*, its season autumn, its days *geng* and *xin*, its flavor pungent;
the kidney is a *female* viscus, its color black, its season winter, its days *ren* and *gui*, its tone *yu*, its flavor salty.
These are the five variations."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How do these govern the five *shu*-points?"*

Qibo replied: *"The viscera govern winter, and in winter, one needles the *jing*-point;
the colors govern spring, and in spring, one needles the *ying*-point;
the seasons govern summer, and in summer, one needles the *shu*-point;
the tones govern late summer, and in late summer, one needles the *jing*-point of the channel;
the flavors govern autumn, and in autumn, one needles the *he*-point.
This is how the five variations govern the five *shu*-points."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How do the *yuan*-points combine to result in six *shu*-points?"*

Qibo replied: *"The *yuan*-point alone does not correspond to the five seasons, so it is combined with the *jing*-point to fulfill their numbers, thus making thirty-six *shu*-points."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"What is meant by ‘the viscera govern winter,’ ‘the seasons govern summer,’ ‘the tones govern late summer,’ ‘the flavors govern autumn,’ and ‘the colors govern spring’? I wish to hear their reasoning."*

Qibo replied: *"When disease is in the viscera, one takes the *jing*-point;
when disease manifests in the colors, one takes the *ying*-point;
when disease aligns with the season and is severe, one takes the *shu*-point;
when disease manifests in the tones, one takes the *jing*-point of the channel;
when the channel is full and the blood is disturbed, or when disease arises from improper diet, one takes the *he*-point. Thus, it is called ‘the flavors govern the *he*-point.’
This is what is meant by the five variations."*

*"The external examination is the forty-fifth [section]."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I have heard of the Nine Needles in nine chapters, and I have personally received their principles, gaining some understanding of their intent. The Nine Needles, beginning at one and ending at nine, yet I have not yet grasped their essential Dao. The Nine Needles—when small, they reach no interior; when great, they extend to no exterior. They cannot be measured as deep or shallow, nor confined as high or low. They are boundless and elusive, overflowing without end. I know they harmonize with the Dao of Heaven, human affairs, and the transformations of the Four Seasons—but I wish to integrate them into a single, unified whole, like the finest hairs bound together. Is this possible?"*

Qibo replied: *"Your question is profound indeed! It is not merely about the Dao of the needles, for governing a state follows the same principle. The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish only to hear of the Dao of the needles, not matters of state."* Qibo said: *"To govern a state is to embody the Dao itself. Without the Dao, how could one unify the small and great, the shallow and deep, into a single whole?"*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish to hear it fully."*

Qibo replied: *"The sun and moon, water and mirror, drum and echo. The brilliance of the sun and moon never loses their shadows; the clarity of water and mirror never fails to reflect form. The drum’s response never lags behind its sound—when moved, it resonates in harmony, capturing all its essence."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How wondrous! Their radiance cannot be obscured. Their unobscured nature lies in their adherence to yin and yang. When combined and examined, when pressed and verified, when observed and understood, it is like clear water and a bright mirror never failing to reveal form. If the Five Tones are not resonant and the Five Colors are not distinct, if the Five Viscera are agitated, then the exterior and interior will follow in succession—like the drum’s response to its strike, the echo’s return to sound, the shadow’s likeness to form. Thus, the distant one examines the interior through the exterior, the near one examines the exterior through the interior. This is called the ultimate of yin and yang, the canopy of Heaven and Earth. Let this be preserved in the sacred halls of Linglan, lest it be revealed to the unworthy."*

*The Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon, Spiritual Pivot, Volume 14*
*Five Variations, Section 46*

The Yellow Emperor asked Shàoyú, saying: *"I have heard that the onset of a hundred ailments must arise from wind, rain, cold, and heat. They enter through the hair follicles and pores, sometimes returning, sometimes lingering, sometimes causing wind edema and sweating, sometimes leading to consumption and dampness, sometimes to cold and heat, sometimes to lingering numbness, sometimes to accumulations. These perverse pathogens overflow in myriad ways, beyond counting. I wish to know their cause. When people fall ill at the same time, some suffer here, others there—could it be that Heaven generates wind for humankind? Why do the afflictions differ so?"*

Shàoyú replied: *"Heaven’s generation of wind is not to single out the people; its movement is just and impartial. Those who transgress are struck, those who avoid it are spared. It does not seek out people—people themselves invite it by their actions."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"At the same time, people encounter wind and fall ill, yet their diseases differ. I wish to hear the reason."*

Shàoyú said: *"Excellent question! Let me compare it to a carpenter. When a carpenter sharpens his axes and chisels, hones his knives and planes, and hews wood, the wood’s yin and yang—its hardness and brittleness—vary. The hard resists the blade, the brittle splits at the skin. When it reaches the joints, the axe and chisel falter. Within a single piece of wood, hardness and brittleness differ: the hard is rigid, the brittle easily injured. Yet the wood’s thickness, the depth of its grain, the abundance of its sap—all vary. And so, when spring frost or violent winds strike, the early-blooming, late-leafed trees lose their flowers and wither. In prolonged drought, the brittle, thin-skinned trees with little sap wither and their branches dry. In lingering dampness and excessive rain, the thin-skinned, sap-rich trees rot and decay. In sudden gales, the rigid and brittle trees snap and crack. In autumn frost and fierce winds, their roots loosen and leaves fall. These five injuries—each has its target. Now apply this to humankind!"*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How does one compare humans to wood?"*

Shàoyú answered: *"The injuries to wood strike its branches—its rigidity and brittleness, its firmness—before harm occurs. In humans, chronic illnesses arise where bones, joints, skin, and pores are weak and unguarded, for there the pathogens lodge, making disease constant."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How does one foretell who will suffer wind, fainting, or sweating?"*

Shàoyú replied: *"If the flesh is not firm and the pores are lax, one will easily fall ill with wind."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How does one know if the flesh is not firm?"*

Shàoyú replied: *"If the flesh lacks firmness and lacks clear grain, and the skin is not taut—if the pores are lax—this is the mark of a diffuse, undifferentiated constitution."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How does one foretell who will suffer consumption and dampness?"*

Shàoyú replied: *"Those whose Five Viscera are all soft and weak will easily fall ill with consumption and dampness."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How does one know if the Five Viscera are soft and weak?"*

Shàoyú replied: *"The weak must contrast with the strong. The strong are prone to anger, and the weak are easily injured."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How does one discern the weak from the strong?"*

Shàoyú replied: *"Observe those with thin skin, deep-set and firm eyes, a long, straight, and upright stature—these are the rigid in heart. The rigid are prone to anger, and anger drives *qi* upward in rebellion. The chest accumulates stagnation, blood and *qi* reverse and linger, the diaphragm and skin swell, the blood vessels stagnate, and heat ensues. Heat consumes the flesh, leading to consumption. This describes those whose constitution is violently rigid yet whose muscles are weak."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How does one foretell who will suffer cold and heat?"*

Shàoyú replied: *"Those with small bones and weak flesh will easily suffer cold and heat."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How does one know the size of the bones, the firmness of the flesh, and the uniformity of their color?"*

Shàoyú replied: *"The facial bones are the root of all bones. If the face is large, the bones are large; if the face is small, the bones are small. If the skin is thin and the flesh lacks firmness, if the arms hang limp and the complexion is sallow—if their natural hue is obscured and they stand out uncleanly—this is the sign. Then, if the arms are thin, their marrow is insufficient, and they will easily suffer cold and heat."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How does one foretell who will suffer numbness?"*

Shàoyú replied: *"Those with coarse pores and unfirm flesh will easily suffer numbness."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Does numbness have a high or low predilection?"*

Shàoyú replied: *"To know its high or low placement, observe the affected region."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How does one foretell who will suffer intestinal accumulations?"*

Shàoyú replied: *"If the skin is thin and lacks luster, if the flesh is not firm yet appears moist—then the intestines and stomach are weak. Weakness allows pathogens to linger, leading to accumulations. Between the spleen and stomach, if cold and heat are disordered, even slight pathogenic intrusion will cause stagnation and accumulation, eventually forming masses."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I have now understood the forms of disease! I wish to hear of their timing."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How does one foretell the timing of disease?"*

Shàoyú replied: *"First establish the person’s age, then one may know the timing. If the season is high (spring/summer), disease will arise; if the season is low (autumn/winter), it will decline. Though it may not descend to the lower regions, if there is a year when the *sùn* (collateral channels) and *jīng* (main channels) are in flux, the disease will manifest. This is called ‘diseases arising from bodily constitution,’ a record of the five seasonal transformations."*

**Phonetic Gloss:**
- *sùn* (穑) pronounced *yuàn* (as in "wide")
- *jīng* (通) pronounced *táo* (as in "peach")
- *wù* (恶) pronounced *nuò* (as in "weak")
- *shèng* (胜) pronounced *sà* (as in "deer")

The Yellow Emperor questioned Qíbó, saying: *"The vital *blood*, *qi*, and *spirit* are what sustain life and circulate through the essence of existence. The *jīngmài* (meridian channels) are what convey *qi* and *blood*, nourishing the *yin* and *yang*, moistening the sinews and bones, and lubricating the joints. The *wèiqì* (defensive *qi*) is what warms the flesh, fills the skin, and renders the *pores* firm, governing the opening and closing of the body. The *zhìyì* (will and intent) are what command the *spirit*, gather the *húnpò* (ethereal soul and corporeal soul), moderate cold and heat, and harmonize joy and anger. Therefore, when *blood* is harmonized, the *jīngmài* flow freely, nourishing *yin* and *yang*, strengthening the sinews and bones, and making the joints supple. When the *wèiqì* is harmonized, the flesh is well-nourished and flexible, the skin smooth and tender, and the *pores* dense and sealed. When the *zhìyì* is harmonized, the *spirit* remains focused and upright, the *húnpò* do not scatter, regret and anger do not arise, and the five *zàng* (viscera) are impervious to pathogens. When cold and heat are moderated, the six *fǔ* (entrances) transform grains, and wind-*bì* (numbness) does not occur, the *jīngmài* flow freely, and the limbs find peace. This is the state of human equilibrium.*

*The five *zàng* are what store the *spirit*, *qi*, *blood*, and *húnpò*. The six *fǔ* are what transform water and grains, circulating the *jīnè* (body fluids). This is how humans fully receive the gifts of *Heaven*—without distinction of wisdom or folly, virtue or vice, they are all equally endowed. Yet some exhaust their natural lifespan without suffering from perverse or deviant diseases, remaining unweakened even at a hundred years. Though exposed to wind and rain, extreme cold or scorching heat, they are unharmed. Others never leave their chambers, fearing neither rest nor vigilance, yet still fall ill. Why is this? I wish to hear the reason."*

Qíbó replied: *"How profound your question is!"*

The five *zàng* are what harmonize with Heaven and Earth, correspond to yin and yang, and connect with the four seasons, transforming the five *jié* (phases). The five *zàng* inherently possess variations in size—great or small, elevation—high or low, texture—firm or brittle, shape—upright or tilted—and alignment—balanced or skewed. The six *fǔ* likewise vary in size—long or short, thickness—thick or thin, structure—compact or straight, and tension—relaxed or taut. These twenty-five distinctions, each differing in kind, may be either auspicious or inauspicious, fortunate or calamitous. Let me explain their effects.

When the **heart** is small, it remains tranquil, and perverse influences cannot harm it, but it is easily injured by worry.
When the **heart** is large, worry and anxiety cannot harm it, but it is easily injured by perverse influences.
When the **heart** is high, it presses upon the lungs, causing joy and forgetfulness, but it is difficult to open through speech.
When the **heart** is low, it is exposed externally, making it susceptible to cold and easily startled by speech.

When the **lungs** are small, they require little drink, and one does not suffer from wheezing or coughing.
When the **lungs** are large, they require much drink and are prone to chest constriction (*xiōngbì*), throat constriction (*hóubì*), and reversed *qi*.
When the **lungs** are high, they cause upward *qi*, shoulder breathing, and coughing.
When the **lungs** are low, they press upon the *zǎi* (diaphragm), causing pain beneath the ribs.

When the **lungs** are skewed, one suffers from lateral chest pain.

When the **liver** is small, its essence is securely stored, and there is no pain beneath the ribs.
When the **liver** is large, it presses upon the stomach and throat, constricting the throat and causing pain beneath the ribs.
When the **liver** is high, it presses upward upon the *zǎi*, causing rib pain and a sensation of fullness in the *sháo* (rib region).
When the **liver** is low, it presses upon the stomach, leaving the ribs hollow, making them susceptible to perverse influences.
When the **liver** is firm, its essence is securely stored and difficult to injure.
When the **liver** is brittle, one is prone to diseases of consumption, dampness, and internal heat, and is easily injured.
When the **liver** is upright, it harmonizes and is difficult to injure.
When the **liver** is skewed, one suffers from pain beneath the ribs.

When the **spleen** is small, its essence is securely stored and difficult to injure by perverse influences.
When the **spleen** is large, one suffers from *chénshā* (a chronic, dull pain) and cannot walk swiftly.
When the **spleen** is high, the pain draws toward the lateral ribs.
When the **spleen** is low, it descends upon the large intestine, making its essence susceptible to perverse influences.
When the **spleen** is firm, its essence is securely stored and difficult to injure.
When the **spleen** is brittle, one is prone to diseases of consumption, dampness, and internal heat, and is easily injured.
When the **spleen** is upright, it harmonizes and is difficult to injure.
When the **spleen** is skewed, one is prone to fullness and distension.

When the **kidneys** are small, their essence is securely stored and difficult to injure.
When the **kidneys** are large, one is prone to waist pain, unable to bend or bow, and easily injured by perverse influences.
When the **kidneys** are high, one suffers from pain in the back and loins, unable to bend or bow.
When the **kidneys** are low, one suffers from *yāoshī* (lumbar hernia) pain, unable to bend or bow, manifesting as *húshàn* (hernia).
When the **kidneys** are firm, one does not suffer from waist or back pain.
When the **kidneys** are brittle, one is prone to diseases of consumption, dampness, and internal heat, and is easily injured.
When the **kidneys** are upright, they harmonize and are difficult to injure.
When the **kidneys** are skewed, one suffers from *yāoshī* pain.

These twenty-five variations are the common afflictions of humanity.

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How do you know this to be so?"*

Qíbó replied:
*"When the complexion is red and finely textured, the **heart** is small.
When it is coarse, the **heart** is large.
When the *hóuqì* (supraorbital ridge) is absent, the **heart** is high.
When the *hóuqì* is small, short, and raised, the **heart** is low.
When the *hóuqì* is long, the **heart** is firm; when it is weak, small, and thin, the **heart** is brittle.
When the *hóuqì* descends straight and does not raise, the **heart** is upright.
When the *hóuqì* leans to one side, the **heart** is skewed.

When the complexion is white and finely textured, the **lungs** are small.
When it is coarse, the **lungs** are large.
When the shoulders are broad and the back is concave at the throat, the **lungs** are high.
When the armpits are wide and the ribs are spread, the **lungs** are low.
When the shoulders and back are thick, the **lungs** are firm.
When the shoulders and back are thin, the **lungs** are brittle.
When the back and chest are thick, the **lungs** are upright.
When the ribs are unevenly spaced, the **lungs** are skewed.

When the complexion is green and finely textured, the **liver** is small.
When it is coarse, the **liver** is large.
When the chest is broad and the spine is concave, the **liver** is high.
When the ribs are drawn inward and the spine is concave, the **liver** is low.
When the chest and ribs are robust, the **liver** is firm.
When the ribs are weak, the **liver** is brittle.

When the complexion is black and finely textured, the **kidneys** are small.
When it is coarse, the **kidneys** are large.
When the ears are high, the **kidneys** are high.
When the area behind the ears is concave, the **kidneys** are low.

When the ears are unevenly raised, the **kidneys** are skewed.

These variations, if maintained in balance, bring stability; if diminished, they bring disease."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Excellent."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"This is not what I asked. I wish to hear of those who are incapable of falling ill—who live out their full natural lifespan despite profound grief and fear, their vigilant resolve never faltering; who are unharmed by extreme cold or heat; and yet, even those who remain indoors, shielded from all dread, still fall ill. Why is this? I wish to know the reason."*

Qìbó replied: *"The five **viscera** and six **bowels** are the dwelling places of pathogenic influences. Let me explain their nature.

When the five **viscera** are all small, one suffers few illnesses but endures constant melancholy and great sorrow. When the five **viscera** are all large, one is sluggish in action and difficult to provoke with worry. When the five **viscera** are all high, one favors elevated actions. When the five **viscera** are all low, one tends to be inferior to others. When the five **viscera** are all firm, one is free of disease. When the five **viscera** are all brittle, one is never free of illness. When the five **viscera** are all upright, one harmonizes and gains the trust of others. When the five **viscera** are all skewed, one harbors deceitful intentions, is prone to theft, and cannot be trusted—speaking in contradictions.

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish to hear of the six **bowels**’ correspondences."*

Qìbó answered: *"The **lung** corresponds to the **large intestine**; the **large intestine** reflects in the **skin**. The **heart** corresponds to the **small intestine**; the **small intestine** reflects in the **pulse**. The **liver** corresponds to the **gallbladder**; the **gallbladder** reflects in the **sinews**. The **spleen** corresponds to the **stomach**; the **stomach** reflects in the **flesh**. The **kidneys** correspond to the **triple burner** and **bladder**; the **triple burner** and **bladder** reflect in the **fine pores** and **downy hair**."

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How do these correspondences manifest?"*

Qìbó replied: *"The **lung** reflects in the **skin**: thick skin indicates a thick **large intestine**; thin skin indicates a thin **large intestine**. Relaxed skin with a spacious abdomen indicates a large and long **large intestine**; taut skin indicates a short and constricted **large intestine**. Smooth skin indicates a straight **large intestine**; skin and flesh inseparable indicates a knotted **large intestine**.

The **heart** reflects in the **pulse**: thick skin indicates thick pulses, and thick pulses indicate a thick **small intestine**; thin skin indicates thin pulses, and thin pulses indicate a thin **small intestine**. Relaxed skin indicates relaxed pulses, and relaxed pulses indicate a large and long **small intestine**; thin skin with a faint pulse indicates a small and short **small intestine**. When all the **yang** meridians are excessively winding, the **small intestine** becomes knotted.

The **spleen** reflects in the **flesh**: firm, ample flesh indicates a thick **stomach**; sparse flesh indicates a thin **stomach**; small and sparse flesh indicates a weak **stomach**. Flesh unproportionate to the body indicates a descending **stomach**, which causes the lower passage to constrict and function poorly. Flaccid flesh indicates a relaxed **stomach**; flesh without fine creases indicates a constricted **stomach**; flesh with many creases indicates a knotted **stomach**, which causes the upper passage to constrict and function poorly.

The **liver** reflects in the **nails**: thick, yellow nails indicate a thick **gallbladder**; thin, red nails indicate a thin **gallbladder**; firm, green nails indicate a constricted **gallbladder**; soft, red nails indicate a relaxed **gallbladder**; straight, white nails without constriction indicate a straight **gallbladder**; malformed, black nails with many ridges indicate a knotted **gallbladder**.

The **kidneys** reflect in the **bones**: dense texture with thick skin indicates thick **triple burner** and **bladder**; coarse texture with thin skin indicates thin **triple burner** and **bladder**; sparse fine pores indicate a relaxed **triple burner** and **bladder**; taut skin without downy hair indicates a constricted **triple burner** and **bladder**; coarse, abundant downy hair indicates a straight **triple burner** and **bladder**; sparse downy hair indicates a knotted **triple burner** and **bladder**."

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Thickness, thinness, beauty, and deformity all have visible forms. I wish to know the diseases they portend."*

Qìbó answered: *"Observe their external correspondences to discern the internal **viscera**, and thus you will know the source of the illness."*

「**Phonetic Explanation:** *Embū* (high-cutting, *chì*), *qiāo* (knocking). □*jié* (to bind). □*yú* (at). *Huángdì Nèijīng Língshū Jízhù* Volume 14, *Jìng* #1: *"Heart"*—the original text had an extra *"below"* character, deleted according to *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* Volume 1, Chapter 5. #2: *"Li"*—as in *"li"* (inside). In *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* Volume 1, Chapter 5, it reads *"li"* (interior). #3: *"Dà"*—as *"li"* (interior). In *Jiǎyǐ Jīng* Volume 1, Chapter 5, it reads *"huǎn"* (relaxed). *Huángdì Nèijīng Língshū Jízhù*, Volume 15, *Jìn Fú* (Prohibitions and Services), Chapter 48.

**外揣** (*Wàichuǎi*)—speaking of the entire body as a unified whole, yet still unclear about its meaning.

The Yellow Emperor said: *"The Dao/Way of acupuncture begins with the **jingmai** (channels and vessels), tracing their pathways and knowing their **dùliàng** (extent and measure). Internally, it targets the **wùzàng** (five viscera), externally, the **liùfǔ** (six palaces). Adjusting the **wèiqì** (defensive *qi*) and **yíngqì** (nutritive *qi*)—this is the root of all hundred diseases. Regulating their **xūshí** (excesses and deficiencies), the excesses and deficiencies will cease. Pricking their **xuèluò** (blood networks), when the blood is exhausted, the illness will not linger.

Léigōng (Thunder Official) said: *"These are all the principles I have already mastered, but I still do not know their **jié** (binding/constraints)."* The Yellow Emperor replied: *"To constrain a method is like binding a bag—if the bag is full yet not bound, it will leak. If a method is perfected yet not constrained, its **shén** (spiritual essence) will not be retained. Léigōng said: *"I wish to learn how to constrain even before the bag is full, so that I may become a skilled practitioner, though not necessarily a teacher for all under heaven."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"To become a skilled practitioner, one must measure the **rènmài** (pulse of the **rèn** channel—**cúnkǒu** [inch-opening]) as the **zhōng** (central), and the **rènmài** (pulse of the **rèn** channel—**rènyíng** [human-welcoming]) as the **wài** (external). When both pulses correspond and move in tandem—like drawing a taut thread of equal size—if the **rènyíng** pulse is slightly larger in spring and summer, and the **cúnkǒu** pulse is slightly larger in autumn and winter, this is called a **píngrén** (balanced person).

If the **rènyíng** pulse is onefold larger than the **cúnkǒu**, the illness lies in the **foot Shàoyáng** (Lesser Yang) channel; if it is onefold larger and **zào** (turbulent), it lies in the **hand Shàoyáng** channel.
If the **rènyíng** pulse is twofold larger, the illness lies in the **foot Tàiyáng** (Greater Yang) channel; if it is twofold larger and **zào**, the illness lies in the **hand Tàiyáng** channel.
If the **rènyíng** pulse is threefold larger, the illness lies in the **foot Yángmíng** (Bright Yang) channel; if it is threefold larger and **zào**, the illness lies in the **hand Yángmíng** channel.
When **shèng** (excessive), it manifests as **heat**; when **xū** (deficient), it manifests as **cold**. If **jǐn** (tight), it causes **painful numbness**; if **dài** (alternating), it fluctuates between severe and mild.

When excessive, **prick** (*xiě*) it; when deficient, **reinforce** (*bǔ*) it. If tight and painful, take the **fēnròu** (dividing flesh) method. If alternating, take the **xuèluò** (blood networks) and administer **yào** (medicine) orally. If the pulse is **xiànxià** (sunken), use **jiǔ** (moxibustion). If neither excessive nor deficient, follow the **jingmai** (channels) and **prick** (*cì*) accordingly—this is called **jingcì** (channel pricking).

If the **rènyíng** pulse is fourfold larger, it is both **large** and **frequent**, called **yìyáng** (overflowing Yang). Overflowing Yang leads to **wàigé** (external blockage)—once this occurs, the illness is incurable and death is imminent.
One must carefully examine the pulse from **běn** (origin) to **mò** (end), observing its **cold** and **hot** qualities to verify the illnesses of the **zàngfǔ** (viscera and palaces).

If the **cúnkǒu** pulse is onefold larger than the **rènyíng**, the illness lies in the **foot Juéyīn** (Concealed Yin) channel; if it is onefold larger and **zào**, it lies in the **hand Xīnmài** (Heart Master) channel.
If the **cúnkǒu** pulse is twofold larger, the illness lies in the **foot Shàoyīn** (Lesser Yin) channel; if it is twofold larger and **zào**, it lies in the **hand Shàoyīn** channel.
If the **cúnkǒu** pulse is threefold larger, the illness lies in the **foot Tàiyīn** (Greater Yin) channel; if it is threefold larger and **zào**, it lies in the **hand Tàiyīn** channel.

When excessive, it causes **distension and fullness**; when deficient, it causes **internal heat**, **discharge of undigested food** (*chū méi*), **shortness of breath**, and **urine color changes**.
When tight, it causes **painful numbness**; when alternating, it fluctuates between **pain and remission**.」

When excessive, **drain it**; when deficient, **tonify it**. When tight, **first prick with needles and then moxibustion**; when alternating, **first take the blood vessels and then regulate it**. When sunken and weak, **apply moxibustion alone**.

The sunken and weak pulse is where **pulse and blood congeal within**, with **stagnant blood** inside. Since the blood is cold, **moxibustion is appropriate**.

If neither excessive nor deficient, **treat according to the channel**.

If the **cúnkǒu** pulse is fourfold larger, it is called **Inner Pass (Nèiguān)**. The **Inner Pass**—when both large and rapid—is **untreatable and fatal**.

One must carefully examine its **root and branch**, its **cold and warmth**, to verify the illness of the **zàng-fǔ**.

To **unblock the nourishing and transporting networks**, only then can it be transmitted to the **greater numbers**.

The **greater numbers** say:
When excessive, **drain it alone**; when deficient, **tonify it alone**. When tight, **moxibustion, needling, and medication**. When sunken and weak, **moxibustion alone**. If neither excessive nor deficient, **treat according to the channel**.

What is called **channel treatment**—medication, **moxibustion, and needling**—are all included.

If the pulse is **urgent**, it **draws taut**; if large yet weak, it **desires rest**, and **avoids exertion**.

**[Phonetic Annotation]** *Dìchǔxiá* (enemy-chu-xia) rhyme.

**The Five Colors (Chapter Forty-Nine)**

**Leigong asked the Yellow Emperor:**

*"The Five Colors—do they solely pertain to the Bright Hall? I do not yet understand their meaning."*

The Yellow Emperor replied:

*"The Bright Hall is the nose. The Obscure (阙) is the eyebrows, the Courtyard (庭) is the face, the Abundant (蕃) are the sides of the cheeks, and the Concealed (蔽) are the ear gates. Between them, the space should be square and broad—ten steps away, all visible from the outside. If such is the case, one’s lifespan shall surely reach a hundred years."*

Leigong asked: *"How does one distinguish the Five Officials?"*

The Yellow Emperor said:

*"The Bright Hall’s bones rise high and stand straight, its five zàng aligned at the center, the six fǔ flanking its sides. The head and face ascend to the Obscure and Courtyard, the Royal Palace lies at the lower extreme. The five zàng rest in the chest, their true colors manifesting while diseased hues vanish. When the Bright Hall is moist and clear, how could the Five Officials fail to be distinguished?"*

Leigong asked: *"What of those not distinguished? May I inquire?"*

The Yellow Emperor replied:

*"When the Five Colors appear, each emerges from its designated region. If the bone of that region is sunken, disease shall surely follow. If the color spreads beyond its region, though the illness be severe, death shall not come."*

Leigong asked: *"How do the Five Officials manifest in disease?"*

The Yellow Emperor said:

*"Green and black signify pain; yellow and red signify heat; white signifies cold. These are the Five Officials."*

Leigong asked: *"When illness worsens and its pattern declines, how does one discern it?"*

The Yellow Emperor replied:

*"Both internal and external signs are present. If the pulse at the *cù-kǒu* is slippery, small, tight, and deep, the illness worsens within. If the *rén-yíng* pulse is large, tight, and floating, the illness worsens without. When the *cù-kǒu* pulse is floating and slippery, the illness advances daily. When the *rén-yíng* pulse is deep yet slippery, the illness recedes daily. If the *cù-kǒu* pulse is slippery and deep, the illness advances within. If the *rén-yíng* pulse is slippery, strong, and floating, the illness advances without. When the *cù-kǒu* and *rén-yíng* pulses differ in floating/depth and size, the illness is hard to cure.

If the illness lies in the zàng, a deep and large pulse is easy to cure, while a small pulse is ominous. If the illness lies in the fǔ, a floating and large pulse is easy to cure.

When the *rén-yíng* pulse is strong and firm, it signifies injury by cold. When the *qì-kǒu* pulse is strong and firm, it signifies injury by food."*

Leigong asked: *"How does one judge the severity of illness by color?"*

The Yellow Emperor replied:

*"When the color is coarse and bright, and the complexion is sunken and wan, the illness is severe. If the color ascends, the illness worsens. If the color descends like dispersing clouds, the illness is abating. The Five Colors each have an internal region, an external region, and a central region. If color moves from the external to the internal region, the illness shifts from without to within. If color moves from the internal to the external, the illness shifts from within to without.

When illness originates within, first treat the yin, then the yang—reversing this order worsens the condition. When illness originates in the yang, first treat the exterior, then the interior—reversing this order worsens the condition.

If the pulse is slippery, large, and irregular with a long rhythm, the illness comes from without. The patient may see strange sights or harbor strange aversions—this is the convergence of yang qi, and it may yet be transformed."*

Leigong asked: *"I have heard that wind is the beginning of a hundred illnesses, and that reversal (*jué*) arises from cold and dampness. How does one distinguish them?"*

The Yellow Emperor replied:

*"Observe the Obscure (between the eyebrows) constantly: thin moisture signifies wind; turbid surging signifies *bì* (numbness/ataxy); when it settles to the earth, it is reversal (*jué*). This is their constant pattern—each color declares its illness."*

Leigong asked: *"How does one know when a person dies suddenly without prior illness?"*

The Yellow Emperor replied:

*"When great qi enters the zàng-fǔ without prior illness, sudden death shall follow."*

Leigong asked: *"How does one know when a person dies suddenly after a minor recovery?"*

The Yellow Emperor replied:

*"If red appears on both cheeks, as large as a mother’s thumb, though the illness seems to abate, sudden death shall follow. If black appears at the Courtyard (face), as large as a mother’s thumb, the person shall die without prior illness."*

Leigong bowed twice and said: *"Excellent! Does death have a fixed time?"*

The Yellow Emperor replied: *"Observe the colors to know the hour."*

Leigong said: *"Excellent! I wish to hear further."*

The Yellow Emperor replied:

*"The Courtyard is the head and face; above the Obscure is the throat; the center of the Obscure is the lung; the lower extreme is the heart; directly below is the liver; to the left of the liver is the gallbladder; below is the spleen; above the square is the stomach; the center is the large intestine; flanking the large intestine is the kidney; opposite the kidney is the navel; above the Royal Palace (*miàn-wáng*) is the small intestine; below the Royal Palace is the bladder. The *pō* (nape) is the shoulder; behind the *pō* is the arm; below the arm is the hand. Above the inner corner of the eye is the chest and breast; ascending from the *shéng* (a landmark below the collarbone) is the back. Following the *yá-chē* (a landmark near the hip) downward is the thigh; the center is the knee; below the knee is the *jīng* (lower leg); below the *jīng* is the foot. The *jù-fèn* (inner thigh) is the *gǔ-lǐ* (inner groin); the *jù-lǚ* (bent knee) is the *xī-bì* (knee joint).

These are the regions of the five zàng and six fǔ, their branches and joints—each with its designated area. Knowing these areas, one harmonizes yin and yang, or yang and yin. Mastering these regions ensures infallible diagnosis; distinguishing left and right is the Great Way. Since male and female occupy different positions, they are called yin and yang. Examining moisture and waness determines the skill of the practitioner.

When the complexion is sunken and turbid, the illness is internal. When it is floating and moist, the illness is external. Yellow and red signify wind; green and black signify pain; white signifies cold. Yellow with a greasy sheen signifies pus; excessive red signifies blood; severe pain signifies spasm; extreme cold signifies loss of sensation in the skin.

Observe where each color appears in its region, note its floating or sinking to judge depth, examine its moisture or waness to foresee success or failure, and observe its dispersion or concentration to know proximity or distance. Watch whether the color ascends or descends to locate the illness. Gather your spirit within and, with focused mind, know past and present."*

If the **diagnostic qi** is not subtle, one cannot distinguish truth from falsehood. Fix your intent and do not withdraw—only then will you know the new and the old.

If the color is clear yet not coarse, its sinking or waness is severe; if unclear and without luster, the illness is not grave.

When the color is dispersed, flickering like a colt’s movement without yet gathering, the illness is scattered and the **qi** is painful, for the gathering has not yet formed.

When the **kidney** dominates the **heart**, the **heart** is first afflicted, and the **kidney** responds. All colors manifest thus.

In men, if the color appears in the **face sovereign** (*miàn wáng*), it signifies lower abdominal pain, below it the **testicles**; if round and straight, it signifies **penile pain**; high indicates the **root**, low the **head**—belonging to the category of *hú liè* (hernia) and *yīn* (scrotal) ailments. In women, if the color appears in the **face sovereign**, it signifies **bladder** and **uterine** diseases. Dispersed, it signifies pain; gathered, it signifies concretion. Square, round, left, or right—each follows its color and form.

If it descends randomly to the **calloused areas** (*zhī*), with a moist sheen like grease, it signifies gluttony and uncleanliness.

Left indicates left, right indicates right. If the color is perverse, its gathering and dispersal are irregular—this is what the **face sovereign** points to.

Colors—**blue-black, red, white, and yellow**—are all distinct and full, each with its own region.

When **red** deviates from its region, its color spreads large as a **pouch or gourd**, appearing in the **face sovereign** as **nocturnal emissions**.

If the color is sharp above, with the head hollow and upward-facing, sharp below and downward-facing, it appears on the left and right as prescribed.

The **Five Colors** correspond to the **Five Viscera**: **blue** to the **liver**, **red** to the **heart**, **white** to the **lung**, **yellow** to the **spleen**, and **black** to the **kidney**.

The **liver** governs **sinews**, the **heart** governs **vessels**, the **lung** governs **skin**, the **spleen** governs **flesh**, and the **kidney** governs **bones**.

**Discussion on Courage (Section 50)**
The Yellow Emperor asked **Shaoyu**:
*"Here is a man—walking or standing side by side with another, equal in age, with clothing of equal thickness. Suddenly, they encounter a violent wind and rain. One falls ill, another does not; sometimes both fall ill, sometimes neither does. Why is this?"*

Shaoyu replied: *"Your question is urgent, Sire. What do you wish to know?"*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish to hear it all."*

Shaoyu said:
*"Spring’s **green wind**, summer’s **yang wind**, autumn’s **cool wind**, and winter’s **cold wind**—each of these seasonal winds manifests illness in different forms."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How do these seasonal winds affect the sick?"*

Shaoyu replied:
*"Those with **yellow** skin, thin **skin**, and weak **flesh** cannot endure spring’s **empty wind**; those with **white** skin, thin **skin**, and weak **flesh** cannot endure summer’s **empty wind**; those with **blue** skin, thin **skin**, and weak **flesh** cannot endure autumn’s **empty wind**; those with **red** skin, thin **skin**, and weak **flesh** cannot endure winter’s **empty wind**."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Do those with **black** skin not fall ill?"*

Shaoyu replied: *"If **black** in color, with thick **skin** and firm **flesh**, they are indeed unharmed by the four seasonal winds. But if their **skin** is thin and their **flesh** not firm, or if their color is uneven, and they encounter **empty wind** in **long summer**, they will fall ill. If their **skin** is thick and their **flesh** firm, even if they encounter **empty wind** in **long summer**, they will not fall ill. Only if their **skin** is thick and their **flesh** firm, yet they are **severely** exposed to cold—both externally and internally—will they fall ill."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Excellent."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"As for people who endure pain and those who do not, it is not a matter of courage or cowardice. The brave man who cannot endure pain will advance when facing danger but halt when facing pain; the coward who endures pain will fear danger upon hearing it and remain unmoved when encountering pain.

The brave man who endures pain will not fear danger and will remain unmoved when encountering pain. The coward who cannot endure pain, when facing danger and pain, will avert his gaze, his face turning pale, unable to speak, losing his breath in shock, his complexion shifting—now dead, now alive. I have observed this, but I do not know its cause. I wish to hear its explanation."*

Shaoyu replied: *"Enduring pain or not is determined by the thickness of the **skin**, the firmness or fragility of the **flesh**, and the tension or slackness of the **muscles**—not by courage or cowardice."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish to hear how courage and cowardice arise."*

Shaoyu replied: *"The brave man has deep-set, steady eyes, a long, straight brow, and **San Jiao** pathways aligned horizontally. His **heart** is upright, his **liver** large and firm, his **gallbladder** full and extended. When angry, his **qi** surges, his chest expands, his **liver** rises, and his **gallbladder** spreads horizontally. His pupils dilate, his gaze sharpens, his hair stands on end, and his face turns ashen—this is how the brave man manifests."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish to hear how cowardice arises."*

Shaoyu replied: *"The coward has large, unsteady eyes, with **yin** and **yang** misaligned. His **San Jiao** pathways are vertical, his **vertebrae** short and small, his **liver** suspension slack, his **gallbladder** neither full nor extended, his **intestines** and **stomach** protruding, and his flanks hollow. Though he rages fiercely, his **qi** cannot fill his chest. Though his **liver** and **lungs** rise, his **qi** weakens and sinks again, so he cannot sustain his anger—this is how cowardice manifests."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"When a coward drinks alcohol, his anger does not yield to that of the brave—what **viscus** causes this?"*

Shaoyu replied: *"Alcohol is the refined essence of **water** and **grains**, the fluid of ripened grains. Its **qi** is fierce and violent. When it enters the **stomach**, the **stomach** distends, and the **qi** reverses upward, filling the chest. The **liver** floats, and the **gallbladder** spreads horizontally. At this moment, he may rival the brave, but when his **qi** weakens, he regrets it. Though he behaves like the brave, he does not know to avoid it—this is called **alcohol’s perversity**."*

---
**Facial Expressions on the Back (Section 51)**
The Yellow Emperor asked **Qibo**:
*"I wish to hear of the **visceral expressions** that appear on the back."*

Qibo replied:
*"The **great facial expression** of the **chest** is at the end of the **zhù bone**; the **lung’s facial expression** is in the space of the **San Jiao**; the **heart’s facial expression** is in the space of the **Wu Jiao**; the **diaphragm’s facial expression** is in the space of the **Qi Jiao**; the **liver’s facial expression** is in the space of the **Jiu Jiao**; the **spleen’s facial expression** is in the space of the **Shi Yi Jiao**; the **kidney’s facial expression** is in the space of the **Shi Si Jiao**—all adjacent to the **spine**, three *cùn* apart. Press these points: if there is a response in the center and the pain subsides, then it is indeed the **facial expression**."*

The **Qibo** replied:
*"**Moxibustion** may be applied, but **acupuncture** must not. When the **qi** is abundant, **drain** it; when it is deficient, **tonify** it. For **tonification with fire**, do not fan the flame—it must extinguish itself. For **drainage with fire**, fan the flame swiftly, passing the **moxa** until the fire dies.*

**Qibo** said:
*"The **Five Visceral Organs** store the **spirit** (*shén*), **mind** (*jīng*), **soul** (*hún*), and **ethereal soul** (*pò*). The **Six Palaces** receive **water and grain** (*shuǐ gǔ*) and govern the **transformation of substances** (*huà wù*). Their **qi** internally nourishes the **Five Visceral Organs** and externally interconnects with the **limbs and joints** (*zhī jié*).

The **superficial defensive-qi** (*wèi qì*), which does not follow the **channels** (*jīng*), is called **defensive-qi**; the **essential-qi** (*jīng qì*), which courses through the **channels**, is called **nutritive-qi** (*yíng qì*). **Yin** and **yang** flow in tandem, their external and internal pathways interlinked like an endless ring. The **Five Visceral Organs** and **Six Palaces** harmonize in unceasing rhythm—who can fully comprehend this?

Yet, though their distinctions between **yin** and **yang** are profound, each has its **root** and **branch**, its **deficiency** and **excess**, and its **separation** from the **superficial** and **deep** layers. One who can discern the **yin-yang** of the **Twelve Channels** (*shí'èr jīng*) knows where diseases originate. One who can gauge the **deficiency** and **excess** of the **Six Palaces** (*liù fǔ*) knows the **height** and **depth** of illnesses. One who understands the **street-like pathways** (*jiē*) of the **Six Palaces’ qi** can discern the **unbinding** and **binding** of **disease at the gates** (*ménhù*).

One who knows the **firmness** and **softness** of **deficient-qi** (*xū qì*) and **stagnant-qi** (*shí qì*) can determine where **tonification** or **drainage** is needed. One who knows the **roots** and **branches** of the **Six Channels** (*liù jīng*) can be free from doubt in all things under heaven."

**Qibo** replied:
*"How profound are the **Sacred Emperor’s** words! Let me speak fully and exhaustively on this matter."*

The **roots** of the **Foot Taiyang Channel** lie five *cù* above the heel, with its **mark** at the two **network vessels** of the **Gate of Life**—the **Gate of Life** being the eyes.

The **roots** of the **Foot Shaoyang Channel** lie at the **Yin Orifice**, with its **mark** before the **Window Curtain**—the **Window Curtain** being the ears.

The **roots** of the **Foot Shaoyin Channel** lie three *cù* above the inner ankle, with its **mark** at the **back of the face** and the two pulses beneath the tongue.

The **roots** of the **Foot Jueyin Channel** lie five *cù* above the **Walking Orifice**, with its **mark** at the **back of the face**.

The **roots** of the **Foot Yangming Channel** lie at the **Lì Ditch**, with its **mark** at the **Human Welcome** pulse beside the cheek and jaw joint.

The **roots** of the **Foot Taiyin Channel** lie four *cù* above the **Middle Seal**, with its **mark** at the **back of the face** and the root of the tongue.

The **roots** of the **Hand Taiyang Channel** lie behind the outer ankle, with its **mark** one *cù* above the **Gate of Life**.

The **roots** of the **Hand Shaoyang Channel** lie two *cù* above the junction of the little and ring fingers, with its **mark** at the lower outer corner of the ear’s upper angle.

The **roots** of the **Hand Yangming Channel** lie at the elbow’s bone, extending upward to **Separate Yang**, with its **mark** at the **chin’s convergence** beneath the jaw.

The **roots** of the **Hand Taiyin Channel** lie at the **Cùn Mouth**, with its **mark** at the **armpit’s movement**.

The **roots** of the **Hand Shaoyin Channel** lie at the tip of the **Rùi Bone**, with its **mark** at the **back of the face**.

The **roots** of the **Hand Jīn Master Channel** lie two *cù* between the two tendons behind the palm, with its **mark** three *cù* below the armpit.

In examining these, if the **lower** is **deficient**, there is **sinking** (*jué*); if the **lower** is **excessive**, there is **heat**. If the **upper** is **deficient**, there is **dizziness**; if the **upper** is **excessive**, there is **heat and pain**.

Thus, when **stagnant-qi** is **blocked**, it must be **stopped**; when **deficient-qi** is **weak**, it must be **tonified**.

Now, let me speak of the **street-like pathways** of **qi**:
There are **street-like pathways** of **qi** in the **chest**, in the **abdomen**, in the **head**, and in the **Channels**.

Thus, when **qi** is in the **head**, it is **stopped** at the **brain**.
When **qi** is in the **chest**, it is **stopped** at the **chest** and the **back of the face**.
When **qi** is in the **abdomen**, it is **stopped** at the **back of the face** and the **Rushing Pulse** at the **navel’s** left and right **moving pulses**.
When **qi** is in the **Channels**, it is **stopped** at the **street-like pathways** and **Bearing Mountain**, below the **ankle**.

When taking these points, use a **hair-thin needle**, first pressing and holding for a long time until a response is felt in the hand, then inserting and withdrawing.

The conditions treated are:
**Headache**, **dizziness**, and **falling unconscious**;
**abdominal pain**, **midsection fullness**, and **sudden distension**;
as well as **new accumulations**.

If the **pain can be moved**, it is **easily cured**;
if the **accumulation does not pain**, it is **difficult to cure**.

**Phonetic Explanation:**
*"Pin"* sounds like *"qián"* [钤].

**Ling Shu (Spiritual Pivot) Volume 16, Section 53: Discussion of Pain**

**Ling Shu (Spiritual Pivot) Volume 16, Section 53: Discussion of Pain**

The Yellow Emperor asked Shào Yú: *"The strength and weakness of tendons and bones, the firmness and brittleness of muscles and flesh, the thickness and thinness of skin, and the density of the defensive* **Qi** *(*Virtue/Power*)—each varies. How do they differ in their tolerance to the pain of acupuncture, moxibustion, and cauterization? The thickness and thinness, firmness and brittleness of the intestines and stomach also differ. How do they vary in their tolerance to poisonous medicines? I wish to hear all about it."* Shào Yú replied: *"Those whose bones are strong, tendons weak, flesh slack, and skin thick endure pain well. Such persons tolerate the pain of acupuncture and cauterization, and also that of moxibustion."* The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How do you know who can endure the pain of moxibustion?"* Shào Yú answered: *"Those with black complexion and beautiful bones can endure the pain of moxibustion."* The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How do you know who cannot endure the pain of acupuncture and cauterization?"* Shào Yú replied: *"Those with firm flesh and thin skin cannot endure the pain of acupuncture and cauterization, nor that of moxibustion."* The Yellow Emperor asked: *"In cases of illness, some recover simultaneously while others do not, some find relief easily while others struggle. What is the reason for this?"* Shào Yú replied: *"When illness affects a person simultaneously, those with more* **Qi** *of heat recover easily, while those with more* **Qi** *of cold find it difficult."* The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How do you know who can overcome poison?"* Shào Yú replied: *"Those with thick stomachs, black complexions, large bones, and robust bodies can all overcome poison. Conversely, those who are lean with thin stomachs cannot overcome poison."*

**Section 54: On Life and Death**

The Yellow Emperor asked Qí Bó: *"I wish to hear about the origins of a person’s life. What* **Qi** *forms the foundation? What establishes the* **Dao** *(*Way*)? What causes death, and what brings life? How can I understand this?"* Qí Bó replied: *"The mother’s essence serves as the foundation, and the father’s essence as the framework. Those who lose their* **shén** *(*Spirit*) die, and those who retain it live."* The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What constitutes* **shén** *(*Spirit*)?"* Qí Bó replied: *"When the blood and* **Qi** *are harmonized, the* **Róng** *(*Nourishing*) and* **Wèi** *(*Defensive*) circulations are established, the five* **zàng** *(*Viscera*) are formed, and* **shén** **-Qi** *(*Spiritual* **Qi**) resides in the heart, while the* **hún** *(*Ethereal Soul*) and* **pò** *(*Corporeal Soul*) are fully possessed—then one becomes a person."* The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Why do people have varying lifespans? Some die young, some in old age, some suffer long illnesses. I wish to understand the* **Dao** *(*Way*) of this."* Qí Bó replied: *"When the five* **zàng** *(*Viscera*) are firm and unyielding, the blood and vessels are harmonized, the muscles and sinews are supple and agile, the skin is dense, the* **Yíng** *(*Nourishing*) and* **Wèi** *(*Defensive*) circulations proceed without deviation, breathing is gentle and measured, the* **Qi** *flows according to its proper limits, the six* **fǔ** *(*Organs*) transform grain into* **gu** *(*Essence*), and* **jīn-yè** *(*fluids*) are evenly distributed—each according to its proper function—then one can live long."* The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How does one reach a lifespan of a hundred years before dying?"* Qí Bó replied: *"By nurturing the* **Dao** *(*Way*) to make it long-lasting, by establishing a strong foundation, by harmonizing the* **Yíng** *(*Nourishing*) and* **Wèi** *(*Defensive*) circulations, by cultivating the three* **bù** *(*sections*) and three* **lǐ** *(*distances*) of the body, by attaining tall bones and full flesh, one may reach a hundred years."* The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Can you explain the waxing and waning of* **Qi** *until death occurs?"* Qí Bó replied: *"At ten years of age, the five* **zàng** *(*Viscera*) have just begun to stabilize, and the blood and* **Qi** *are now flowing. The* **Qi** *resides in the lower body, so the person enjoys running. At twenty years, the blood and* **Qi** *are at their peak, and the muscles and flesh are fully grown, so the person enjoys rushing forward. At thirty years, the five* **zàng** *(*Viscera*) are fully established, the muscles and flesh are firm, and the blood vessels are full and robust, so the person enjoys walking. At forty years, the five* **zàng** *(*Viscera*), six* **fǔ** *(*Organs*), and twelve* **jīng-mài** *(*Meridians*) are all at their fullest and balanced. The defensive* **Qi** *begins to thin, and the* **Róng** *(*Nourishing*) and* **Wèi** *(*Defensive*) circulations decline, with hair turning gray and white. The* **Qi** *remains balanced without disturbance, so the person enjoys sitting. At fifty years, the* **Qi** *of the liver begins to decline, the liver lobes grow thin, bile production diminishes, and vision becomes unclear. At sixty years, the* **Qi** *of the heart begins to decline, and the person is prone to sorrow, worry, and melancholy. The blood and* **Qi** *become sluggish, so the person prefers to stay outdoors. At seventy years, the* **Qi** *of the spleen weakens, and the skin dries out. At eighty years, the* **Qi** *of the lungs declines, and the* **pò** *(*Corporeal Soul*) departs, so speech often becomes confused. At ninety years, the* **Qi** *of the kidneys becomes exhausted, and the five* **zàng** *(*Viscera*) and meridians grow empty. At a hundred years, the five* **zàng** *(*Viscera*) are all depleted, the* **shén** **-Qi** *(*Spiritual* **Qi*) has departed, and only the physical form remains before death."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What about those who cannot reach old age and die prematurely? How does that come about?"* Qí Bó replied: *"Their five* **zàng** *(*Viscera*) are not firm. The* **Dao** *(*Way*) is not cultivated to its full length. The body is hollow and distended, with rapid breathing and sudden illnesses. Their foundation is low and weak, their vessels thin and blood scarce, their flesh not firm. They often suffer from exposure to wind and cold, leading to depletion of blood and* **Qi** *and blocked vessels. When true* **Qi** *and pathogenic* **Qi** *assail each other, they become disordered and mutually entangled, thus failing to reach old age and dying early."*

**Section 55: On Contrary and Concordant Qi**

The Yellow Emperor asked Bó Gāo: *"I have heard that* **Qi** *has contrary and concordant movements, and that the vessels have waxing and waning. There are general principles for acupuncture—can I hear about these?"* Bó Gāo replied: *"The contrary and concordant movements of* **Qi** *are in accordance with the* **Dao** *(*Way*) of Heaven and Earth, Yin and Yang, the four seasons, and the five phases. The waxing and waning of the vessels are used to gauge the depletion or excess of blood and* **Qi***. The general principles of acupuncture require one to clearly understand whether a disease is amenable to acupuncture, whether it is not yet amenable, or whether it is already beyond acupuncture’s reach."* The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How does one diagnose this?"* Bó Gāo replied: *"The* **Bīngfǎ** *(*Military Strategy*) states: ‘Do not confront the enemy’s advancing* **Qi***, nor attack their strong formations.’ The* **Cìfǎ** *(*Needle Method*) states: ‘Do not puncture when* **Qi** *is turbulent and the body is hot, do not puncture when sweat is profuse, do not puncture when the vessels are chaotic, nor when the disease and* **Qi** *of the vessels are contrary to each other.’"* The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How does one diagnose when acupuncture is appropriate?"* Bó Gāo replied: *"The highest skill is to puncture before the disease fully arises. The next level is to puncture before the* **Qi** *becomes excessive. The following level is to puncture when the* **Qi** *has already waned. The lowest skill is to puncture when the disease has already taken hold, or when the* **Qi** *of the body is at its peak, or when the disease and* **Qi** *of the vessels are contrary to each other. Thus it is said: ‘When the* **Qi** *is at its peak, do not dare to harm or injure. Puncture when the* **Qi** *has already waned, and success will be certain.’ It is also said: ‘The highest skill treats what has not yet become a disease; the lowest skill treats what is already a disease.’ This is what is meant."*

**Five Flavors (Chapter 56)**

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish to hear how the five flavors of grains enter the five viscera and how they are distributed. What is their distinction?"*

Bó Gāo replied: *"The stomach is the sea of the five viscera and six bowels. All water and grains enter the stomach, and the five viscera and six bowels all draw their qi from the stomach.

The five flavors each follow their preferred path: sour grains first enter the liver, bitter grains first enter the heart, sweet grains first enter the spleen, spicy grains first enter the lungs, and salty grains first enter the kidneys.

Once the grain’s essence and fluids have circulated, the *Yíng* and *Wèi* flow freely, and then the dregs are transformed and passed downward in sequence."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How do the *Yíng* and *Wèi* circulate?"*

Bó Gāo replied: *"When grains first enter the stomach, their refined essence emerges from the two *jiāo* (flanks) of the stomach to irrigate the five viscera. It then branches into two pathways—the *Yíng* and *Wèi* channels.

The coarse qi that does not circulate accumulates in the chest, called the *Qìhǎi* (Sea of Qi). It emerges from the lungs, travels along the throat and pharynx, so that exhalation expels it and inhalation draws it in.

The vital essence of Heaven and Earth, in its great measure, always emerges three times and enters once. Thus, if no grains are consumed, the qi weakens after half a day and diminishes after a full day."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"May I hear of the five flavors of grains?"*

Bó Gāo replied: *"Let me speak exhaustively.

The five grains: *Háng* rice is sweet, hemp is sour, large beans are salty, barley is bitter, and yellow millet is spicy.

The five fruits: dates are sweet, plums are sour, chestnuts are salty, *yǎo* (a fruit) is bitter, and peaches are spicy.

The five livestock: cattle are sweet, dogs are sour, pigs are salty, sheep are bitter, and geese are spicy.

The five vegetables: *kuí* (a gourd) is sweet, garlic chives are sour, *lěi* (a plant) is salty, lotus is bitter, and onions are spicy.

The five colors: yellow favors sweetness, green favors sourness, black favors saltiness, red favors bitterness, and white favors spiciness.

These five categories each have their own suitability.

The five *yí* (affinities) I speak of: for spleen ailments, one should eat *Háng* rice, cow meat, dates, and *kuí* (gourd). For heart ailments, one should eat barley, sheep meat, *yǎo* (fruit), and *yuè* (a plant). For kidney ailments, one should eat large beans, yellow rolls, pig meat, and chestnuts. For liver ailments, one should eat hemp, dog meat, plums, and garlic chives. For lung ailments, one should eat yellow millet, goose meat, peaches, and onions.

The five prohibitions: for liver ailments, spicy is forbidden; for heart ailments, salty is forbidden; for spleen ailments, sour is forbidden; for kidney ailments, sweet is forbidden; for lung ailments, bitter is forbidden.

The liver’s color is green, favoring sweetness—*Háng* rice, cow meat, dates, and *kuí* (gourd) are all sweet. The heart’s color is red, favoring sourness—dog meat, hemp, plums, and garlic chives are all sour. The spleen’s color is yellow, favoring saltiness—large beans, pig meat, chestnuts, and *lěi* (plant) are all salty. The lung’s color is white, favoring bitterness—barley, sheep meat, and *xìng* (a fruit) are all bitter. The kidney’s color is black, favoring spiciness—yellow millet, goose meat, peaches, and onions are all spicy."*

**Water Edema (Chapter 57)**

The Yellow Emperor asked Qī Bó: *"How do we distinguish water edema, skin edema, drum edema, intestinal *táng* (a mass), stone *hán* (a condition), and stone water?"*

Qī Bó replied: *"When water edema first arises, the eye sockets swell slightly, like a newly formed mound. The neck pulse throbs, there is occasional coughing, the groin feels cold, the legs swell, and the abdomen becomes distended—this is when the water has fully formed.

Pressing the abdomen, the swelling rises with the hand, like water inside—this is its sign."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How do we diagnose skin edema?"*

Qī Bó replied: *"Skin edema occurs when cold qi lodges between the skin and flesh. The abdomen is distended but not firm, the body swells entirely, the skin thickens, and pressing the abdomen leaves no impression. The abdominal color does not change—this is its sign."*

*"What of drum edema?"*

Qī Bó replied: *"The abdomen swells uniformly, making the body equally distended, like skin edema. The color turns grayish-yellow, and abdominal muscles protrude—this is its sign."*

*"What of intestinal *táng*?"*

Qī Bó replied: *"When cold qi lodges outside the intestines and clashes with the *Wèi* qi, the qi cannot nourish, and if it becomes entangled, it congeals inward, generating malignant qi and festering flesh.

At first, it forms like a goose egg, gradually growing larger, until it resembles a fetus in the womb. If it persists for years, pressing it feels firm, and pushing it moves it. Menstruation still occurs on time—this is its sign."*

*"What of stone *hán*?"*

Qī Bó replied: *"Stone *hán* forms in the uterus. When cold qi blocks the uterine passage, the qi cannot flow, and stagnant blood, which should be expelled, instead lingers and grows daily, forming a mass like a fetus. Menstruation does not occur on time. This condition arises only in women and can be guided downward."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Can skin edema and drum edema be treated with acupuncture?"*

Qī Bó replied: *"First, drain the blood vessels causing the edema, then regulate the channels, and finally remove the blood vessels."*

**Thieving Wind (Chapter 58)**

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Master, you speak of how thieving wind and evil qi harm people, causing illness. Yet there are cases where individuals remain indoors, never exposed to wind or evil qi, yet suddenly fall ill. Why is this?"*

Qī Bó replied: *"These are cases where the person was previously injured by dampness, which lingers in the blood vessels and between the muscles, remaining for a long time without leaving. Or, if they experienced a fall or trauma, stagnant blood remains inside without being expelled.

If emotions become unchecked—excessive joy or anger—or if diet and climate are mismanaged, the natural flow is obstructed. When this blockage opens and encounters wind or cold, the blood and qi congeal, combining with old stagnation to form cold *bì* (numbness). If heat arises, sweating occurs, and sweating invites wind. Even without encountering thieving wind or evil qi, illness will inevitably develop from these causes."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"The cases you describe are ones where the patient knows their own condition. But what of those who have not encountered evil qi, nor experienced fear or vigilance, yet suddenly fall ill? What is the cause of this?"*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Could it be due to matters involving ghosts and spirits?"*

Qì Bó replied: *"This too has its cause—where evil *qi* lingers and has yet to manifest, and thus the mind harbors aversion toward something or yearns for another, disrupting the blood and *qi* within. The two *qi* forces then clash. The origin of this disturbance is subtle, unseen in sight and unheard in listening, hence it appears as though it were caused by ghosts and spirits."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"What of those who merely recite incantations (*zhù*)—what is their cause?"*

Qì Bó replied: *"Before the shamans (*wū*) act, they discern the prevailing *qi* behind a hundred illnesses, and they know from where the illness arises. Thus, it can be addressed through incantations."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"When the defensive *qi* lingers in the abdomen, causing spasms#1 and stagnation, and the vital organs cannot maintain their proper functions, leading to distension of the flanks, stomach fullness, and labored breathing with inverted exhalation—how should this be treated?"*

Bó Gāo replied: *"If the *qi* accumulates in the chest, treat it from above; if it accumulates in the abdomen, treat it from below; if both above and below are full, treat it from the sides."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How should one treat it?"*

Bó Gāo replied: *"If it accumulates above, needle the *rèn yíng*, *tiān tú*, and throat center; if it accumulates below, needle the *sān lǐ* and *qì jiē*; if both above and below are full, treat both above and below, and also needle one *cùn* below the lower ribs#2. For severe cases, needle the *yīng zú*."*

*"If the pulse is large and taut, or if it is absent, or if the abdominal skin is extremely tense, needling is contraindicated."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Excellent."*

The Yellow Emperor asked Bó Gāo: *"How does one determine diseases of the skin, flesh, *qi*, blood, sinews, and bones?"*

Bó Gāo replied: *"If a sheen arises between the eyebrows, the disease is in the skin. If the lips are green, yellow, red, white, or black, the disease is in the muscles. If the complexion appears damp and wan, the disease is in the blood and *qi*. If the eyes are green, yellow, red, white, or black, the disease is in the sinews. If the ears become dry, withered, and accumulate dirt, the disease is in the bones."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"What are the clinical manifestations? How should they be treated?"*

Bó Gāo said: *"The myriad diseases and their transformations are countless. Yet the skin has its pathways, the flesh its supporting structures, the blood and *qi* their conduits, and the bones their dependencies."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish to hear the reasoning behind this."*

Bó Gāo replied: *"The pathways of the skin converge at the extremities. The supporting structures of the flesh lie within the arm’s *yang* channels between the muscles and the foot’s *Shaoyin* division. The conduits of blood and *qi* distribute to the collateral vessels, where stagnation gives rise to excess and manifestation. The sinews have no *yin* or *yang*, no left or right—one observes where the disease resides. The dependencies of the bones are the hollows that receive nourishment to benefit the brain and marrow."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How should they be treated?"*

Bó Gāo said: *"Diseases vary in their transformations—shallow or deep, nonexhaustive in their forms. Superficial cases are treated superficially; severe cases, deeply. Mild cases require few points; severe cases, many. One must adjust *qi* according to the variation—thus the master physician."*

The Yellow Emperor asked Bó Gāo: *"How does one distinguish between a person’s fatness, leanness, size, and temperature, as well as their age—old, strong, young, or small?"*

Bó Gāo replied: *"Those fifty years and above are old; those twenty years and above are strong; those eighteen years and above are young; those six years and above are small."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How does one measure their fatness or leanness?"*

Bó Gāo replied: *"There are those who are fat, those who are oily, and those who are merely fleshy."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How does one distinguish them?"*

Bó Gāo replied: *"If the subcutaneous fat is firm and abundant, and the skin is full, they are fat. If the subcutaneous fat is not firm and the skin is slack, they are oily. If the skin and flesh do not separate, they are merely fleshy."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How does one determine their bodily temperature?"*

Bó Gāo replied: *"The oily have soft flesh and coarse pores—they are cold-bodied. Those with fine pores are hot-bodied. The fleshy have firm flesh—those with fine pores are hot, those with coarse pores are cold."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How does one determine their fatness, leanness, and size?"*

Bó Gāo replied: *"The oily have abundant *qi* and slack skin, thus their bellies hang and their flanks droop. The fleshy have large, capacious bodies. The lean have small, contracted frames."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How do the *qi* and blood differ in these three types?"*

Bó Gāo replied: *"The oily have abundant *qi*; abundant *qi* brings heat, and heat endures cold. The fleshy have abundant blood, filling the form and balancing it. The lean have clear blood, smooth but scant *qi*, thus they cannot grow large. These are the distinctions among the many."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"And the common people?"*

Bó Gāo replied: *"The common people cannot combine the traits of fat, oily, or fleshy. Their blood and *qi* cannot be excessive, so their forms are neither small nor large—they simply conform to their own bodies, and are called the common people."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Excellent. How should they be treated?"*

Bó Gāo replied: *"One must first distinguish their three forms, the abundance of blood, and the clarity of *qi*, then adjust accordingly—never deviating from the standard channels. Thus, the oily have drooping bellies and sagging flanks; the fleshy have large, capacious bodies above and below; the lean, though fleshy, cannot grow large."*

From the *Jade Tablet*, the Sixty-First Section.

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I once considered the small needle a trivial thing, but you speak of aligning it with Heaven above, Earth below, and humanity within. I thought you exceeded the purpose of acupuncture. I wish to hear the reasoning."*

Qíbù replied: *"What is greater than Heaven? Only the Five Weapons are greater than the needle. The Five Weapons are instruments of death, not life. Moreover, humanity is the pivot of Heaven and Earth—how could it be neglected? Those who govern the people also rely on the needle. Compared to the Five Weapons, which is the lesser?"*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"When diseases arise, there are unpredictable emotions, irregular diet, deficient *yin* *qi*, excess *yang* *qi*, and stagnant *ying* *qi*—these manifest as paralysis and abscesses. When *yin* and *yang* fail to circulate and opposing heats clash, they transform into pus. Can the small needle treat this?"*

Qíbù replied: *"Even the sage cannot reverse transformations. Evil *qi* cannot be made to linger."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"When two armies face each other, their banners visible and blades drawn upon the battlefield, this is not a matter of a single day’s planning. To make the people obey with strict discipline and keep soldiers from harm’s way—this is not the work of a single day’s instruction, but the fruit of long practice. Yet even to suffer paralysis and abscesses, to accumulate pus and blood, is this not to stray far from the Dao/Way?

The formation of paralysis and abscesses, the congealing of pus and blood—these do not come from Heaven above nor from Earth below, but arise from the accumulation of subtle imbalances.

Thus, the sage intervenes before the disease takes form, while the fool encounters it only when it is already manifest."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"If the disease has already taken form, and you do not meet it there, if the pus has already formed, and you do not see it then—how shall you proceed?"*

Qíbù replied: *"When pus has formed, nine out of ten will die; hence, the sage does not allow it to reach that state. Instead, he clarifies the proper prescriptions, records them upon bamboo and silk, so that skilled practitioners may follow and transmit them to future generations without end—this is to prevent the disease from ever forming. Hence, the sage does not face it when it is already manifest."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"If the pus and blood have already gathered, and you then confront it—should you not guide it with the small needle to treat it?"*

Qíbù replied: *"To treat small ills with small means yields little effect; to treat great ills with great means brings many harms. Thus, when pus and blood have already formed, only the lancet and sharp-edged stone can remove them."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"If great harm is inevitable, then is it not impossible to ensure complete success?"*

Qíbù replied: *"It depends on whether one acts in accordance with or against the natural order."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish to hear of this order of accordance and opposition."*

Qíbù replied: *"When treating wounds, if the eyes turn white with dark rings and shrink—this is the first sign of opposition. If internal medicine is administered but the patient vomits—this is the second sign of opposition. If there is abdominal pain and extreme thirst—this is the third sign of opposition. If the shoulders and nape stiffen and refuse to move—this is the fourth sign of opposition. If the voice becomes hoarse and the body wastes away—this is the fifth sign of opposition. Apart from these five, all else is in accordance with the natural order.

As for diseases in general: if the abdomen swells, the body burns with heat, and the pulse is large—this is the first sign of opposition. If the abdomen rumbles and distends while the limbs grow cold, with diarrhea and a large pulse—this is the second sign of opposition. If maggots infest and do not cease, with a large pulse—this is the third sign of opposition. If coughing leads to blood loss and emaciation, with a small, taut pulse—this is the fourth sign of opposition. If coughing causes emaciation, the body burns with heat, and the pulse is small and rapid—this is called the fifth sign of opposition. Such cases will not survive beyond fifteen days.

If the abdomen is greatly distended, the limbs grow cold, the body wastes away, and diarrhea is severe—this is the first sign of opposition. If the abdomen swells with bloody bowel movements and the pulse is large but intermittent—this is the second sign of opposition. If coughing leads to blood loss, the flesh and form waste away, and the pulse is faint—this is the third sign of opposition. If blood is vomited, the chest feels full and tightens toward the back, with a small and rapid pulse—this is the fourth sign of opposition. If coughing, vomiting, and abdominal distension occur alongside severe diarrhea, and the pulse is intermittent—this is the fifth sign of opposition. Such cases will not last even to the next hour before death.

One who does not discern these signs and yet treats them is called ‘treating against the natural order.’"*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Your words on the needle are swift and profound, harmonizing with Heaven and Earth. You ascend to measure celestial omens and descend to gauge terrestrial rhythms. Internally, you distinguish the Five *Zàng* Organs; externally, you order the Six *Fǔ* Palaces. You trace the twenty-eight junctions of the channels, and exhaust all their cycles. You can kill or save a man, yet cannot restore the dead—can you reverse this?"*

Qíbù replied: *"One can kill or save a man, yet cannot restore the dead."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I have heard this and consider it unkind, yet I still wish to hear the reasoning behind it, so that I may not apply it to others."*

Qíbù replied: *"This is the clarity of the Dao/Way—it is inevitable. Just as blades and swords can kill, and wine can intoxicate, though no diagnosis is made, the outcome is still known."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish to hear this fully."*

Qíbù replied: *"The essence a man receives is from the grains. Where the grains settle is the stomach. The stomach is the sea of grains, *qi*, blood, and essence. Where the sea sends forth its mists and vapors is the body. Where the stomach emits *qi* and blood are the channels and collaterals. The channels and collaterals are the great networks of the Five *Zàng* Organs and Six *Fǔ* Palaces—one must only meet them head-on and take what is due. The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Are there prescribed limits above and below?"*

Qíbù replied: *"Meet them at five *lǐ* intervals, and halt at the midpoint—five arrivals suffice. Five departures exhaust the organ’s *qi*, hence twenty-five punctures deplete its outlet. This is called ‘taking their Heavenly *qi*—not severing their life nor draining their years.’"*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish to hear this fully."*

Qíbù replied: *"When treating at the doorstep, the patient dies within the home; when treating at the threshold, the patient dies in the hall. This is the art of the needle’s prohibitions."*

**Chapter Sixty-One: The Five Prohibitions**

The Yellow Emperor asked Qíbù: *"I have heard that there are Five Prohibitions in acupuncture—what are these Five Prohibitions?"*

Qíbù replied: *"These are the times when one must not puncture."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I have also heard that there are Five Seizures in acupuncture."*

Qíbù replied: *"Do not neglect what cannot be seized."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I have heard that there are Five Excesses in acupuncture."*

Qíbù replied: *"Supplement what is deficient without overstepping the measure."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I have heard that there are Five Oppositions in acupuncture."*

Qíbù replied: *"When the disease and pulse oppose one another, it is called the Five Oppositions."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I have heard that there are Nine Appropriatenesses in acupuncture."*

Qíbù replied: *"This refers to the mastery of the Nine Needles’ principles—this is the Nine Appropriatenesses."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What are the Five Prohibitions? I wish to hear the times when one must not puncture."*

Qíbù replied: *"On days *jiǎ* and *yǐ* (甲乙), when the same *tiān* *gān* (天干) repeats, do not puncture the head nor open the ear’s membrane. On days *bǐng* and *dīng* (丙丁), when the same *tiān* *gān* repeats, do not shake dust from the shoulders, throat, or *lián* *quán* (廉泉) point. On days *wù* and *jǐ* (戊己), when the same *tiān* *gān* repeats in all four seasons, do not puncture the abdomen nor the areas near the nails when water *qi* is present. On days *gēng* and *xīn* (庚辛), when the same *tiān* *gān* repeats, do not puncture the joints of the thigh or knee."*

「On days *rén* and *guǐ* (壬癸), when the same *tiān* *gān* repeats, do not puncture the soles of the feet nor the *fú* *qiāng* (足腔).

This is called the Five Prohibitions.

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What are the Five Depletions? I wish to hear the times when one must not puncture."*

Qíbù replied: *"When the flesh and form are already depleted, this is the first depletion; when blood is excessively depleted afterward, this is the second depletion; when great sweating occurs afterward, this is the third depletion; when great diarrhea follows, this is the fourth depletion; and after childbirth or excessive blood loss, this is the fifth depletion. These are all times when puncture is forbidden."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What are the Five Reversals?"*

Qíbù replied: *"When a feverish illness presents with a tranquil pulse, yet sweating has already occurred, and the pulse becomes strong and agitated—this is the first reversal; when illness causes diarrhea and the pulse is surging and large—this is the second reversal; when a fixed *zháo* (痹, stagnation) does not shift, the flesh is damaged, the body is hot, and the pulse is uneven or absent—this is the third reversal; when excessive indulgence depletes the flesh, the body is hot, the complexion is wan and white, and later heavy bleeding occurs, with the bleeding being severe and persistent—this is called the fourth reversal; when cold and heat deplete the flesh and the pulse is firm and tense—this is the fifth reversal.*

**Chapter 62: Movement and Rest**

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"The twelve channels are said to move without ceasing in the hands’ *Tài Yīn* (太阴), and the feet’s *Shǎo Yīn* (少阴) and *Yáng Míng* (阳明). Why is this?"*

Qíbù replied: *"This illustrates the *stomach channel* (胃脉). The stomach is the sea of the five *zàng* (藏, viscera) and six *fǔ* (府, bowels), its clear *qi* ascending to the lungs. The lung *qi* flows through the *Tài Yīn* channel, its movement corresponding to inhalation and exhalation. Thus, with one breath, the pulse moves twice, and with one inhalation, the pulse also moves twice. Since breathing never ceases, the pulse moves without stopping."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"When the *qi* passes the *cùn kǒu* (寸口, radial pulse point), does it rest after ten movements? Or does it lie dormant after eight movements?"*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"By what Dao does the qi return? I do not know its extremity."*

Qíbù replied: *"When the qi departs from the viscera, it suddenly surges forth like the release of a bow or crossbow, like water rushing down a steep bank. It ascends to the lungs, then returns in decline, while the remaining qi disperses upward in reverse, thus its movement becomes subtle."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"By what cause does the *Yáng Míng* channel of the feet move?"*

Qíbù replied: *"The stomach’s *qi* ascends to the lungs, and its fierce *qi* surges upward to the head, following the throat, ascending to the orbital cavity, tracing the eye’s tendons, entering the brain’s network, emerging at the forehead, descending to the *kè zhǔ rén* (客主人, host-guest points), tracing the *yá chē* (牙车, molar region), converging with the *Yáng Míng* channel, and descending to *rén yíng* (人迎). This is how the stomach’s *qi* diverges to the *Yáng Míng* channel. Thus, the interplay of yin and yang above and below moves as one. Hence, when a yang illness presents with a small yang pulse, it is perverse; when a yin illness presents with a large yin pulse, it is perverse. Therefore, when yin and yang are both still or both moving like a taut thread, imbalance brings disease."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"By what cause does the *Shǎo Yīn* channel of the feet move?"*

Qíbù replied: *"The *Chōng* channel is the sea of the twelve channels, and its great network, along with the *Shǎo Yīn*’s major collaterals, arises below the kidney, exits at the *qì jiē* (气街), traces the inner aspect of the thigh, enters the *bīn zhōng* (胭中), follows the inner aspect of the spine’s channel, and descends alongside the *Shǎo Yīn* channel to enter behind the inner ankle, then beneath the foot. Its divergent branch enters the ankle, ascends to the *fǔ shàng* (驸上), enters between the big toe’s bones, and registers in the collaterals to warm the sole—this is the pulse’s constant movement."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"The *yíng* and *wèi* circulate above and below, interpenetrating like an endless loop. Yet if one suddenly encounters perverse *qi* or encounters great cold, causing the hands and feet to slacken, how does the pulse’s yin-yang Dao, at their intersecting points, lose its course? By what means does the *qi* return?"*

Qíbù replied: *"The four extremities are where yin and yang converge—these are the great networks of *qi*. The four *jiē* (四街) are the *qi*’s thoroughfares. Thus, when a network is severed, the thoroughfare remains open; when the extremities relax, the *qi* follows its convergence, circulating like an endless loop."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Excellent. This is what is meant by ‘like an endless loop, its beginning unknown, ending only to begin anew.’"*

The Yellow Emperor asked Qíbù, saying: *"The five flavors enter the mouth, each having its own pathway and each causing its own ailment. Sour affects the sinews—excessive consumption leads to contraction; salty affects the blood—excessive consumption leads to thirst; pungent affects the *qi*—excessive consumption leads to a hollowed heart; bitter affects the bones—excessive consumption leads to alternating vomiting; sweet affects the flesh—excessive consumption leads to a contented heart. I know these effects, but I do not know their underlying mechanisms. I wish to hear their origins."*

Qíbù replied: *"When sour enters the stomach, its *qi* is astringent and contracts, failing to circulate freely between the two *jiāo* (焦). Unable to ascend or descend, it lingers in the stomach. When the stomach’s warmth harmonizes, the *qi* descends into the bladder, whose thin membrane is weak. Sour *qi* causes it to shrink and constrict, blocking its passage, so that the waterways cannot flow—hence the contraction. The sinews are where yin *qi* terminates, so when sour enters, it travels to the sinews."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Salty affects the blood, and excessive consumption leads to thirst—why is this?"*

Qíbù replied: *"When salty enters the stomach, its *qi* ascends to the middle *jiāo* and flows into the pulse vessels, carrying blood *qi* with it. Blood and salty *qi* combine, causing coagulation. The stomach’s juices then descend upon it, depleting the stomach’s moisture. When the stomach is exhausted, the throat passage becomes parched—hence the dry tongue and persistent thirst. The blood vessels are the pathway of the middle *jiāo*, so when salty enters, it travels to the blood."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Pungent affects the *qi*, and excessive consumption leads to a hollowed heart—why is this?"*

Qíbù replied: *"When pungent enters the stomach, its *qi* ascends to the upper *jiāo*, which receives *qi* to nourish all the yang pathways. The *qi* of ginger and scallions permeates it, so that the *yíngwèi* (营卫) *qi* is not received at its proper times. Prolonged stagnation in the heart’s region causes a hollowed sensation. Pungent *qi* travels alongside the *qi*, so when pungent enters, it also emerges with sweat."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Bitter affects the bones, and excessive consumption leads to alternating vomiting—why is this?"*

Qíbù replied: *"When bitter enters the stomach, the *qi* of the five grains cannot overcome it. Bitter *qi* descends to the lower *yùn* (院), where the pathways of the three *jiāo* are all obstructed and fail to circulate—hence the alternating vomiting. The teeth are where the stomach’s *qi* terminates, so when bitter enters, it travels to the bones. Its ascent and descent reveal its pathway to the bones."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Sweet affects the flesh, and excessive consumption leads to a contented heart—why is this?"*

Qíbù replied: *"When sweet enters the stomach, its *qi* is weak and subtle, unable to ascend to the upper *jiāo*. Instead, it lingers with the grains in the stomach, softening and moistening them. When the stomach is relaxed, worms stir, and their movement causes a contented sensation in the heart. Its *qi* externally connects with the flesh, so sweet travels to the flesh."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I have heard that the ‘twenty-five persons of yin-yang’ (阴阳二十五人) are as you describe—how are they?"*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Master Bǎogāo has spoken—within the space between Heaven and Earth and the four cardinal directions, the quintessence never departs from the Five [Elements]. Humans likewise respond to this. Why then do the ‘twenty-five persons of yin-yang’ not align with the Five [Elements]’s governance, and how do they differ from the common multitude?"*

Qíbù replied: *"The Five [Elements]—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—each manifest distinct forms and colors. When their five variations are fully distinguished, the twenty-five persons are complete. Their appearances diverge in five ways from the crowd, and I have already understood them. But I wish to hear of the twenty-five persons’ physical traits, how their blood and *qi* arise, and how they may be discerned externally to reveal their internal nature. How does one perceive them from without to know their within?"*

Qíbù said: *"Your inquiry is thorough! This is the secret of the ancient masters. Even I, though learned, cannot fully illuminate it."*

The Yellow Emperor rose from his seat, bowed in reverence, and stepped back, saying: *"I have heard that if one finds such a person but does not teach them, it is called a double loss. If one finds and then reveals this knowledge, Heaven will withhold it. I wish to learn it, to keep it hidden in a golden chest, and never to proclaim it."*

Qíbù said: *"Very well. Let me speak carefully.

The Wood-formed person resembles the upper *jiǎo* [corner], akin to the Cyan Sovereign [苍帝]. Such a person has a cyan hue, a small head, long face, broad shoulders and back, a straight body, small hands and feet, a talent for cleverness, a restless mind, weak strength, and often worries over affairs.

Their movements are unsteady, their body sways when walking, their lower limbs are long, their back appears stretched and *yǎn yǎn* [prolonged], and they lack reverence, often deceiving and exploiting others, and dying violently. They thrive in autumn and winter but falter in spring and summer; when affected by spring-summer influences, illness arises, and their feet exhibit *shǎoyīn* [Kidney] *qi* in a *hànhàn* [perspiring] manner.

The Great *Yǔ* person aligns with the right foot’s *tàiyáng* [Small Intestine], where *tàiyáng* *qi* ascends in a *jiájiá* [cheeky] manner. The Small *Yǔ* person aligns with the left foot’s *tàiyáng*, where *tàiyáng* *qi* descends in a *yūyū* [twisted] manner. The Common person aligns with the right foot’s *tàiyáng*, where *tàiyáng* *qi* descends in a *jiéjié* [clean] manner—this is also called the Added person. The Extreme person aligns with the left foot’s *tàiyáng*, where *tàiyáng* *qi* ascends in an *ānjiān* [gentle] manner.

Thus, the five forms of the twenty-five variations are the reasons why the common multitude deceives one another.

The Yellow Emperor said: *"If one discerns their form but not their color, how does it manifest?"*

Qíbù replied: *"Form overcomes color, and color overcomes form. When one’s nature prevails, their years increase; when affected by external influences, illness follows its course. When their nature is lost, sorrow ensues."*

「When form and color mutually reinforce one another, wealth, honor, and great joy ensue.

The Yellow Emperor said: *"When their form and color mutually overcome each other, can one know the increase in years?"*

Qíbù replied: *"Generally, those whose years are marked by the **yīxià** [upward/downward] imbalance are greatly afflicted. Their lifespan is commonly reduced by seven years at each of the following ages: sixteen, twenty-five, thirty-four, forty-three, fifty-two, and sixty-one—these are the great **niè** [taboos] of human life, and one must not fail to cultivate self-peace. If affected by external influences, illness follows its course; if their nature is lost, sorrow ensues. At these critical times, one should avoid engaging in deceitful or harmful acts—this is what is called **niè** [taboo years].

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Master, your words speak of the **pulse**’s ascent and descent, the **qi** and **blood**’s cycles—how does one discern the **Way** of **form** and **qi**?"*

Qíbù replied: *"Above the **足阳明** [Foot Yangming] meridian, if **blood** and **qi** are abundant, the **上颊** [upper lip] hair is luxuriant and long. If **blood** is scant and **qi** is excessive, the upper lip hair is short. Thus, if **qi** is scant and **blood** is abundant, the upper lip hair is sparse. If both **blood** and **qi** are scant, there is no upper lip hair, and the **两吻** [lips] appear thin and wrinkled.

Below the **足阳明** [Foot Yangming] meridian, if **blood** and **qi** are abundant, the **下毛** [lower body hair] is luxuriant and long, extending to the chest. If **blood** is abundant and **qi** is scant, the lower body hair is short, reaching only to the navel, and when walking, one tends to lift the feet high, with thin flesh on the toes and a propensity for coldness in the feet. If **blood** is scant and **qi** is abundant, the flesh becomes fleshy yet prone to flaccidity. If both **blood** and **qi** are scant, there is no hair, or if present, it is sparse, withered, and dull, leading to frequent **痿厥** [flaccid paralysis] and **足痹** [foot numbness].

Above the **足少阳** [Foot Shaoyang] meridian, if **qi** and **blood** are abundant, the **通髯** [sideburns] are luxuriant and long. If **blood** is abundant and **qi** is scant, the sideburns are short. If **blood** is scant and **qi** is abundant, the sideburns are few. If both **blood** and **qi** are scant, there is no **须** [beard], and exposure to cold and dampness causes frequent **痹** [numbness], **骨痛** [bone pain], and **爪枯** [withered nails].

Below the **足少阳** [Foot Shaoyang] meridian, if **qi** and **blood** are abundant, the **腔毛** [hair in the calf] is luxuriant and long, and the **外踝** [outer ankle] is fleshy. If **blood** is abundant and **qi** is scant, the **经毛** [hair along the meridian] is short, and the outer ankle skin is firm and thick. If **blood** is scant and **qi** is abundant, the **□毛** [hair] is sparse, and the outer ankle skin is thin and **歃** [dry]. If both **blood** and **qi** are scant, there is no hair, and the outer ankle is emaciated with no flesh.

Above the **足太阳** [Foot Taiyang] meridian, if **blood** and **qi** are abundant, the **眉** [eyebrows] are beautiful, with fine **毫毛** [downy hair]. If **blood** and **qi** are scant, the eyebrows are coarse, and the face has few **理** [pores]. If **blood** is scant and **qi** is abundant, the face becomes fleshy. If **blood** and **qi** are harmonious, the complexion is beautiful.

Below the **足太阴** [Foot Taiyin] meridian, if **blood** and **qi** are abundant, the **跟肉** [heel flesh] is full, and the **踵** [heel] is firm. If **qi** is scant and **blood** is abundant, the heel is thin, with empty flesh. If both **blood** and **qi** are scant, one is prone to **转筋** [muscle cramps], and **踵下痛** [heel pain] occurs.

Above the **手阳明** [Hand Yangming] meridian, if **blood** and **qi** are abundant, the **髭** [mustache] is beautiful. If **blood** is scant and **qi** is abundant, the mustache is coarse. If both **blood** and **qi** are scant, there is no mustache.

Below the **手阳明** [Hand Yangming] meridian, if **blood** and **qi** are abundant, the **腋下毛** [armpit hair] is beautiful, and the **手鱼肉** [palm flesh] is warm. If both **qi** and **blood** are scant, the hands are thin and cold.

Above the **手少阳** [Hand Shaoyang] meridian, if **blood** and **qi** are abundant, the **眉** [eyebrows] are beautiful and long, and the **耳色** [ear color] is fine. If both **blood** and **qi** are scant, the ears become **焦** [dry], and their color is poor.

Below the **手少阳** [Hand Shaoyang] meridian, if **blood** and **qi** are abundant, the **手卷** [hand’s lateral flesh] is fleshy and warm. If both **blood** and **qi** are scant, the hands are cold and emaciated. If **qi** is scant and **blood** is abundant, the hands are thin but with many **脉** [veins].

Above the **手太阳** [Hand Taiyang] meridian, if **blood** and **qi** are abundant, there is much **须** [beard], and the face is fleshy yet flat. If both **blood** and **qi** are scant, the face is emaciated and of poor color.

Below the **手太阳** [Hand Taiyang] meridian, if **blood** and **qi** are abundant, the **掌肉** [palm flesh] is full. If both **blood** and **qi** are scant, the palm is thin and cold.

The Yellow Emperor said: *"For the twenty-five types of people, are there specific guidelines for acupuncture?"*

Qíbù replied: *"Those with beautiful eyebrows have abundant **blood** and **qi** in the **Foot Taiyang** meridian. Those with coarse eyebrows have scant **blood** and **qi**. If the skin is fleshy and lustrous, **blood** and **qi** are in excess. If the skin is fleshy but not lustrous, **qi** is in excess but **blood** is insufficient. If the skin is thin and lacking luster, both **qi** and **blood** are insufficient. By carefully examining these signs of **form** and **qi**—whether in excess or deficiency—one can regulate them and thus discern the **inverse** and **顺** [proper] courses of illness.

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How should one apply acupuncture to these various **yin-yang** meridians?"*

Qíbù replied: *"One should press the **寸口** [radial pulse] and **人迎** [carotid pulse] to regulate **yin** and **yang**. When examining the **经络** [meridians and collaterals], if they are **凝涩** [congealed and stiff], with a **结络** [blocked network] that does not flow freely, this indicates **痛痹** [pain and numbness] throughout the body, and in severe cases, the inability to walk. Hence, one must address **凝涩** [congealed stiffness].

For **凝涩** [congealed stiffness], one should direct **qi** to warm it, and when **blood** harmonizes, the condition will cease. For **结络** [blocked networks], the **pulse** is knotted and **blood** is not harmonious; one must **庾** [unblock] it, and then it will flow. Therefore, it is said: If **qi** is in excess above, one should guide it downward; if **qi** is deficient above, one should push it upward and allow it to rest. If **qi** lingers and does not reach its destination, one should follow and welcome it, ensuring clarity of the **经隧** [meridian pathways] before proceeding. When cold and heat contend, one should guide it to resolve the conflict. If **qi** is **宛陈** [wandering] and **blood** does not clot, one should **则而予之** [restrain and then release it].

One must first clearly understand the twenty-five types of people, then the locations of **blood** and **qi**—whether above, below, left, or right—will be known, and the acupuncture guidelines will be complete.

The Yellow Emperor asked: If women have no beard, does that mean they lack **qi** and **blood**?

Qibo replied: The **chong** [40] and **ren** [41] **meridians** both originate from the **bai** [42] (uterus), ascending along the spine as the **sea of the meridians** [43]. Their pathways that float outward traverse the right side of the abdomen, converge at the throat, and branch to connect with the lips and mouth. When **qi** and **blood** are abundant, they nourish the skin and muscles, producing warmth. If **blood** alone is abundant, it **dànmián** [44] (permeates and moistens) the skin, generating fine hair. Now, in women, **qi** is in excess, while **blood** is deficient—due to their frequent menstrual blood loss—so the **chong** and **ren** **meridians** do not nourish the lips and mouth, and thus no beard grows.

The Yellow Emperor asked: If a scholar suffers injury to his **yin** [45], causing his **yin qi** [46] to be severed and unable to rise again, and his **yin** is not utilized, yet his beard does not fall out, what is the reason for this? Why does an **eunuch** [47] alone lose his beard? I wish to hear the explanation.

Qibo replied: An **eunuch** has his **zongjin** [48] (main tendons) removed, injuring the **chong meridian**. His **blood** then **xiè** [49] (disperses) and does not return, while the skin and flesh internally solidify. The lips and mouth are not nourished, so his beard does not grow.

The Yellow Emperor asked: And if there are those born as **eunuchs** (*tianyan* [50]), who have never been injured, do not suffer blood loss, yet still lack a beard—what is the reason for this?

Qibo replied: This is where Heaven is deficient. Their **ren** and **chong** **meridians** are not abundant, their **zongjin** tendons do not fully form, and though they possess **qi**, they lack **blood**—so the lips and mouth are not nourished, and thus no beard grows.

The Yellow Emperor said: Excellent! The **sage**’s understanding of all things is like the radiance of the sun and moon, their resonant tones echoing like the **sound of drums** [51]. Hearing their voice reveals their form. No one but you could clarify the essence of all things.

Thus, the **sage** observes their complexion: those with **yellow-red** tones have abundant **yang qi** [52], those with **green-white** tones have lesser **yang qi**, and those with **black** tones have abundant **blood** and lesser **qi**.

Those with **beautiful eyebrows** have the **yang** **meridian** of the **tai-yang** [53] hand abundant in **blood**, those with **beards extending to the chin** have the **shao-yang** hand abundant in **blood**, and those with **beautiful beards** have the **yangming** hand abundant in **blood**—this is their natural disposition.

In humans, the **constant numbers** of the **meridians** are:
The **tai-yang** [54] hand **meridian** is always abundant in **blood** and deficient in **qi**,
The **shao-yang** hand **meridian** is always abundant in **qi** and deficient in **blood**,
The **yangming** hand **meridian** is always abundant in both **qi** and **blood**,
The **jue-yin** [55] foot **meridian** is always abundant in **qi** and deficient in **blood**,
The **shao-yin** foot **meridian** is always abundant in **blood** and deficient in **qi**,
The **tai-yin** foot **meridian** is always abundant in **blood** and deficient in **qi**—
this is Heaven’s **constant numbers**.

**The Origin of All Diseases** (Chapter Sixty-Six)

The Yellow Emperor asked Qibo: The origin of all a hundred diseases, how do they arise? They all stem from **wind**, **rain**, **cold**, **heat**, **dampness**, **joy**, and **anger**.

Excessive **joy** and **anger** without moderation harm the **zang** [56] (solid organs),
**Wind** and **rain** harm the upper body,
**Dampness** harms the lower body.
The three divisions of **qi** [57] are affected differently. I wish to hear their convergence.

Qibo replied: The three divisions of **qi** each differ. Some originate from **yin**, some from **yang**. Let me explain their patterns.

**The Origin of All Diseases** (Chapter Sixty-Six)

**Excessive Joy and Anger** (Chapter Sixty-Seven)

When **joy** and **anger** are unmoderated, they harm the **zang** (solid organs),
and when the **zang** are injured, diseases arise from **yin**.

When **dampness** and **cold** invade the **void** [58], diseases arise in the lower body;
when **wind** and **rain** invade the **void**, diseases arise in the upper body.
This is called the **three divisions**.

As for their **profligate excess** [59], it is countless.

The Yellow Emperor said: I have long been unable to enumerate them,
so I question the **Master** [60] and wish to fully hear the **Dao**.

Qibo replied: **Wind**, **rain**, **cold**, and **heat**,
unless they meet the **void**, cannot harm alone.
If one suddenly encounters a violent **wind** and **rain** yet does not fall ill,
it is because there is no **void**—
thus, the **evil** cannot harm alone.

This must be due to the **void-evil wind** [61] meeting the body’s form,
where **two voids** converge and the **evil** lodges in the form;
or when **two reals** meet, ordinary people’s flesh is firm.
Within the body, when the **void-evil** meets the **void** of the form,
combined with the **real** and **void** of the **three divisions**,
great diseases form.

The **three divisions of qi** have fixed lodgings,
and diseases take their names according to where they settle—
upper, lower, internal, and external—
divided into **three categories**.

Thus, when **void-evil** invades a person,
it begins at the **skin**.
If the **skin** is relaxed, the **pores** open,
and when the **pores** open, **evil** enters through the **hair follicles**.
Once it enters, it probes deep—
if it reaches the **hair follicles**, they stand erect,
and when the **hair follicles** stand erect, there is a **shivering sensation** [62].
Hence, the **skin** aches.

If it lingers and does not leave,
it then lodges in the **network vessels** [63].
When it settles in the **network vessels**, the pain is in the **muscles**,
and when the pain is in the **muscles**, it subsides [64].
Then the **major meridians** take their turn.

If it lingers and does not leave,
it lodges in the **meridians**.
When it settles in the **meridians**, there is a **shivering sensation** [65] and **fear of wind** [66].

If it lingers and does not leave,
it lodges in the **junctions** [67].
When it settles in the **junctions**, the **six major meridians** are blocked,
and the **four limbs** and **joints** become **stiff and contracted** [68],
**back pain** and **muscle rigidity** ensue.

If it lingers and does not leave,
it lodges in the **hidden and rushing pulses** [69].
When it settles in the **hidden and rushing pulses**, the **body feels heavy** and **aches**.

If it lingers and does not leave,
it lodges in the **intestines and stomach**.
When it settles in the **intestines and stomach**, there is **abdominal distension** [70].
If there is excess **cold**, the **intestines rumble**, there is **diarrhea with undigested food** [71], and **food does not digest**.
If there is excess **heat**, **perspiration** and **pus-like discharge** [72] occur.

If it lingers and does not leave,
it lodges between the **intestines and stomach** and their **confluences and sources** [73],
settling in the **pulses**.
When it lingers and does not leave,
the pain subsides but **accumulations** [74] form.

Sometimes it settles in the **branch vessels** [75],
sometimes in the **network vessels**,
sometimes in the **meridians**,
sometimes in the **junctions**,
sometimes in the **hidden and rushing pulses**,
sometimes in the **muscles and tendons**,
or in the **confluences and sources** of the **intestines and stomach**.
It may also connect externally to the **relaxed sinews** [76].
The **evil qi** is **profligate and excessive** [77],
and its variations are endless.

The Yellow Emperor said: I wish to hear fully how this occurs.

Qibo replied: When **evil** settles in the **branch and network vessels** and forms **accumulations**,
the **accumulations** move **up and down**,
lodging in the **branch and network vessels** of the **arms and hands**.
They are **floating and relaxed**,
and since they cannot **fix the accumulation** and stop it,
they **wander and shift**.

Between the **intestines and stomach**, **watery fluids** [78] **seep and trickle**,
with a **splashing sound** [79].
If there is **cold**, the **abdominal region feels taut and full**, with **rumbling and distension** [80].
Hence, the pain is **intermittent**.

When it settles in the **yangming** **meridian**,
it lodges beside the **umbilicus**,
growing larger with **fullness** and smaller with **hunger**.

When it settles in the **relaxed sinews** [81],
it resembles the **accumulation** of the **yangming** **meridian**—
**fullness** brings pain, while **hunger** brings ease.

When it settles in the **confluences and sources** of the **intestines and stomach**,
the pain connects externally to the **relaxed sinews**,
and **fullness** brings ease, while **hunger** brings pain.

When it settles in the **hidden and rushing pulses**,
pressing it yields a **response in the hand** [82].
When it erupts, **heat qi** descends to the **two thighs**,
like the sensation of **boiling water being poured**.

When it settles in the **muscles and tendons** behind the **intestines**,
**accumulations** appear only when **hungry**,
and disappear when **full**—
pressing them yields no sensation.

When it settles in the **junction pulses**,
they are **blocked and uncommunicating**,
and **percussion does not descend** [83].
The **pores and orifices** become **dry and congested** [84].
This is when **evil qi** enters from the **exterior** and moves **internally**, **up and down**.

The Yellow Emperor said: How do **accumulations** begin,
and how do they develop into their full form?

Qibo replied: **Accumulations** begin when **cold** is encountered,
and **ulceration** [85] leads to their formation.

The Yellow Emperor said: How do they form **accumulations**?

Qibo replied: **Ulceration qi** arises in the **foot sole** [86],
and the **foot sole** gives rise to **meridian cold** [87].
When the **meridian cold** sets in, the **blood vessels congeal and stiffen** [88],
and when the **blood vessels congeal and stiffen**, **cold qi** ascends and enters the **intestines and stomach**.
Once it enters the **intestines and stomach**, **abdominal distension** occurs,
and when the **abdominal distension** persists, the **fluids outside the intestines** are **pressed together** and cannot disperse,
day by day forming **accumulations**.

If one suddenly overeats or overdrinks,
the **intestines become full**.
If one’s **daily routines** are unmoderated,
or if **exertion** is excessive—
as when one **engages in sexual activity**, **sweats profusely**, or **bathes**—
then the **network vessels** are injured.
If the **yang network vessels** are injured, **blood pools externally** [89],
and when **blood pools externally**, **fecal blood** [90] appears.
If the **yin network vessels** are injured, **blood overflows internally** [91],
and when **blood overflows internally**, **rectal bleeding** [92] occurs.
When the **network vessels** of the **intestines and stomach** are injured,
**blood pools externally in the intestines**.
If there is **cold** outside the intestines,
the **fluids** and **blood** clash,
and when they clash, they **congeal and gather**,
unable to disperse—
thus, **accumulations** form.

If one suddenly contracts **external cold**,
or if **internal injury** comes from **grief and anger**,
then **qi ascends in reverse** [93].
When **qi ascends in reverse**, the **six junctions** are blocked,
**warm qi** does not flow,
**congealed blood** [94] **lodges in the orifices** and does not disperse,
and the **body fluids** become **sticky and seep slowly** [95].
When they settle and do not leave,
**accumulations** form.

The Yellow Emperor said: How do diseases arise from **yin**?

Qibo replied: **Grief and worry** injure the **heart**;
**excessive cold** injures the **lungs**;
**rage and anger** injure the **liver**;
**drunken intercourse** [96], or **sweating in the wind**, injures the **spleen**;
**excessive exertion**—
as when one **engages in sexual activity**, **sweats profusely**, or **bathes**—
injures the **kidneys**.

These are the diseases generated by the **internal, external, and three divisions**.
The Yellow Emperor said: **Well taught.**

How should one treat it? Qibo replied: Observe where it hurts to discern its **resonance** [97]. If there is **excess or deficiency**, supplement when necessary, or **drain** when necessary, and do not act contrary to the **natural rhythms of yin-yang** [98]. This is called **optimal treatment**.

---

The Yellow Emperor asked Qibo: *"I have heard of the **Nine Needles** from Master [99], and I have applied them among the common people. Yet the **blood and qi** of the populace vary in constitution—some have their **spirit** move first and their **qi** follow the needle; some have their **qi** meet the needle; some have the needle release their **qi** alone; some require repeated pricks before they know; some have their **qi** reverse upon needle insertion; and some grow worse with repeated pricks. All these six cases differ in form. I wish to hear their methods."*

Qibo said: *"Those with **excessive yang** are easily **spirit-moved** [100], and their **qi** readily disperses."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What do you mean by **excessive yang**?"*

Qibo replied: *"Those with **excessive yang** are tall and slender, their speech quick, and they move their feet with ease. Their **heart and lung** stores have **surplus qi**, and their **yang qi** is **slippery and abundant**, rising upward. Thus, their **spirit moves first**, and their **qi follows**."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"If one with **excessive yang** does not have their **spirit move first**, what is the reason?"*

Qibo replied: *"This person has **some yin** within them."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How do you know they have **some yin**?"*

Qibo replied: *"Those with much **yang** tend to **excessive joy**; those with much **yin** tend to **excessive anger**. Those who often **anger** find it easier to disperse, so we say **some yin**. Their **yin-yang separation and union** [101] are difficult, hence their **spirit cannot move first**."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What about when the **qi meets the needle**?"*

Qibo replied: *"When **yin and yang are harmonized**, and the **blood and qi are pure, moist, slippery, and smooth**, the needle enters while the **qi exits**, swiftly meeting it."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"When the needle has already exited and the **qi moves alone**, what **qi** causes this?"*

Qibo replied: *"Their **yin qi is abundant** while their **yang qi is scant**; their **yin qi sinks** while their **yang qi floats**. The **sinking** [102] **qi** is **internally stored**, so when the needle has already exited, the **qi follows afterward**, hence it moves alone."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"When repeated pricks are needed before one knows, what **qi** causes this?"*

Qibo replied: *"This person has **much yin and little yang**; their **qi sinks** and disperses with difficulty, so repeated pricks are needed before they know."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"When the **qi reverses upon needle insertion** or when repeated pricks worsen the disease, what **qi** causes this?"*

Qibo replied: *"These cases are not due to **yin-yang qi** or the **nature of floating and sinking** [103]. They are all failures of **coarse technique** and **mistakes of the practitioner**. Their **constitution and qi** are beyond remedy."*

---

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What **qi** causes **upper diaphragm obstruction** [104]? I already know that **food and drink enter but return out**. As for **parasites causing lower diaphragm obstruction** [105], when they appear during eating, I have not yet grasped their meaning. I wish to hear it fully."*

Qibo replied: *"When **joy and anger are improper**, **diet is unregulated**, and **cold and warmth are untimed**, then **cold dampness** flows into the intestines. When cold dampness flows into the intestines, **parasites grow cold**; cold parasites **cluster and accumulate**, lodging in the **lower diaphragm**. Then the **intestines and stomach become distended**, the **defensive qi** [106] fails to circulate, and **pathogenic qi** takes residence. When one eats, the parasites rise to consume food, so the **lower diaphragm becomes empty**. An empty lower diaphragm allows **pathogenic qi** to prevail, causing the **accumulations to linger**. Lingering accumulations form **lower diaphragm obstruction**, which tightens the **lower diaphragm**. If the obstruction is **internal**, it **hurts immediately upon probing**; if it is **external**, then the obstruction is **outside** while the pain **floats**. The skin above the obstruction grows **hot**."*

---

**Yellow Emperor said:** *"How should one acupuncture this condition?"*
**Gebi replied:** *"Gently press upon the obstruction, observe where the qi flows. First, shallowly prick its sides, gradually penetrating deeper inward, then withdraw to prick again—do not exceed three pricks. Examine its sinking or floating to determine depth. After pricking, apply moxibustion, ensuring heat penetrates inward. Daily, let heat enter deeply, weakening pathogenic qi until the obstruction ruptures.

Use *wu* [107] and *shen* [108] to restrain, purging the interior. Calm and non-action will then allow qi to circulate. Later, apply bitter and salty flavors to transform and descend the grains."*

---

**Yellow Emperor asked the Minor Teacher:** *"When a person suddenly falls into grief and distress yet speaks without sound, what blocks the Way? What qi fails to flow [10], causing the voice to falter? I wish to hear the method."*

**Minor Teacher replied:** *"The throat is the passage for water and grains. The pharynx is where qi ascends and descends. The epiglottis is the door of sound. The lips are the bellows of sound. The tongue is the mechanism of sound. The uvula is the gate of sound. The soft palate is where divided qi disperses. The hyoid bone is where spirit-qi commands, governing tongue extension.

Thus, when a person’s nasal passages leak mucus uncontrollably, the soft palate fails to open, and divided qi is lost. If the epiglottis is small and thin, the released qi is swift, its opening and closing agile, and breath flows easily. But if the epiglottis is large and thick, opening and closing are difficult, breath flows slowly, and speech becomes labored.

When a person suddenly loses voice, cold qi invades the epiglottis, preventing its release. Though it attempts to descend, the opening and closing fail to align—thus, no sound."*

**Yellow Emperor said:** *"How should one acupuncture this?"*
**Gebi replied:** *"The Foot Minor Yin [109] channel ascends to the tongue, connects with the hyoid bone, and terminates at the epiglottis. Prick its collateral vessels bilaterally—this dispels turbid qi. The epiglottis’ channel ascends, connecting with the Conception Vessel; pricking at *Tiantu* [110] will make the epiglottis release."*

---
[107] *Wu* (伍): Likely refers to *wuwei* (non-action) or a specific medicinal herb/technique (context unclear).
[108] *Shen* (参): Possibly *shen* (ginseng) or a restraint method.
[109] Foot Minor Yin: *Kidney channel* (腎經).
[110] *Tiantu* (天突): "Celestial Protrusion," a key acupuncture point (CV22).

**Yellow Emperor asked Gebi:** *"When cold, heat, plague, and intermittent fevers lodge in the neck and armpits, what qi causes them?"*
**Gebi replied:** *"These are all the noxious qi of *shǔ* (鼠痪)—the cold and heat poisons that linger in the vessels and refuse to disperse."*

**Yellow Emperor said:** *"How may they be removed?"*
**Gebi replied:** *"The root of *shǔ* resides in the viscera, while its branches surface between the neck and armpits. If it floats within the vessels but has not yet penetrated deep into the muscles—only manifesting externally as pus and blood—it is easily expelled."*

**Yellow Emperor said:** *"How should it be expelled?"*
**Gebi replied:** *"Follow its root to draw out its branches; this will weaken and sever its cold and heat. Probe its path carefully and administer treatment gradually—advance and retreat slowly to remove it. If the lesion is as small as a grain of wheat, one prick suffices; three pricks will suffice."*

**Yellow Emperor said:** *"How does one determine life or death?"*
**Gebi replied:** *"Observe the eyes’ reflection: if red vessels run vertically through the pupil—
- one vessel means death in one year;
- one and a half vessels means death in a year and a half;
- two vessels means death in two years;
- two and a half vessels means death in two and a half years;
- three vessels means death in three years.
If the red vessels do not extend fully through the pupil, treatment is possible."*

**Yellow Emperor asked Bohao:** *"When pathogenic qi invades the body, sometimes causing the eyes to remain open without blinking or closing, what qi causes this?"*
**Bohao replied:** *"When the five grains enter the stomach, their dregs, fluids, and *zōngqì* (宗气) divide into three pathways. Thus, *zōngqì* accumulates in the chest, ascends through the throat, and courses through the heart’s vessels, governing respiration. The *yíng* (营) qi refines the fluids, infusing them into the vessels to transform into blood, which nourishes the extremities and irrigates the five viscera and six bowels, aligning with the body’s rhythmic cycles. The *wèi* (卫) qi, however, expels its fierce, brisk essence, first circulating through the extremities, between muscles and skin, without ceasing. By day, it travels through the yang; by night, through the yin, constantly passing through the Foot Minor Yin’s division, traversing the five viscera and six bowels. Now, if *jué* (厥) qi invades the five viscera and six bowels, the *wèi* qi alone defends the exterior, circulating through the yang without entering the yin. Its dominance in the yang intensifies yang’s vigor, causing yang’s *jiāo* (娇) to sink and fail to enter the yin, leaving voids. Thus, the eyes cannot close."*

**Yellow Emperor said:** *"Excellent. How should it be treated?"*

Bo Gao replied: *"Supplement what is deficient, drain what is excessive, harmonize the void and repletion, to unblock the Dao and expel the pathogenic forces. Administer a single dose of *Half-Summer Decoction* (半夏汤), and once yin and yang are restored, the symptoms will immediately abate."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Excellent. This is what is meant by resolving obstructions and stagnations, achieving great harmony in the channels and pathways, and balancing yin and yang. I wish to hear the prescription."*

Bo Gao said: *"For the decoction, take eight *sheng* of water drawn from a source beyond a thousand *li*, shake it ten thousand times, and take five *sheng* of its clear portion to boil. Use reed wood as fuel, and when the water boils, add one *sheng* of *lin* rice and five *ge* of prepared *half-summer* (半夏). Simmer slowly until it reduces to one and a half *sheng*, then strain out the dregs. Take one small cup of the liquid three times daily, gradually increasing until the condition improves. Thus, for newly arising cases, covering the cup will induce sweating from the exterior, and the illness will subside. For chronic cases, three doses will suffice."*

The Yellow Emperor asked Bo Gao: *"I wish to hear how the human limbs correspond to the heavens and earth."*

Bo Gao answered: *"The heavens are round, the earth is square, and thus the human head is round while the feet are square in correspondence. The heavens have the sun and moon, and the human has two eyes. The earth has nine regions, and the human has nine orifices. The heavens have wind and rain, and the human has joy and anger. The heavens have thunder and lightning, and the human has sound and voice. The heavens have four seasons, and the human has four limbs. The heavens have five tones, and the human has five viscera. The heavens have six pitches, and the human has six bowels. The heavens have winter and summer, and the human has cold and heat. The heavens have ten suns, and the human has ten fingers on each hand. The celestial stems are twelve, and the human has ten toes, a penis, and scrotum in correspondence—women lack these two nodes to embrace the human form. The heavens have yin and yang, and the human has husband and wife. A year has three hundred sixty-five days, and the human has three hundred sixty joints. The earth has high mountains, and the human has shoulders and knees. The earth has deep valleys, and the human has armpits and groin. The earth has twelve waterways, and the human has twelve primary channels. The earth has springs and veins, and the human has *wei* qi. The earth has grass and moss, and the human has fine hairs. The heavens have day and night, and the human has sleep and awakening. The heavens have constellations, and the human has teeth. The earth has small hills, and the human has small joints. The earth has mountains and rocks, and the human has high bones. The earth has forests and trees, and the human has sinews. The earth has clustered settlements, and the human has flesh. The year has twelve months, and the human has twelve major joints. The earth has four seasons where no grass grows, and the human has barrenness. This is how the human corresponds to the heavens and earth."*

The Yellow Emperor asked Qi Bo: *"I wish to hear the principles of needle insertion—how to grasp the needle, the logic of internal insertion, the intent behind extending or withdrawing, and the technique of pricking the skin to release stagnation. How does one determine where the pulse bends and folds, where it enters and exits, where it arrives and departs, where it moves slowly or swiftly, and where it penetrates? I also wish to fully understand the pathways by which the six bowels distribute themselves through the body—their sequential order, their points of separation, how they diverge to enter yin or yang. I wish to hear all of this in full."*

Qi Bo replied: *"Your Majesty’s questions encompass the entirety of the Dao of acupuncture."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish to hear this fully."* Qi Bo replied:

*"The pulse of the Hand Taiyin [Lung] Meridian emerges at the tip of the thumb, curves inward, follows the junction of the white flesh, reaching *Taiyuan* [Great Abyss] behind the first joint. It pauses and diffuses, then curves outward, ascending below the joint before curving inward again to converge with the collateral vessels of the Yin hand at *Yuji* [Fish Border]. Multiple pulses flow together, their qi smooth and fluid, running concealed beneath the bones. Curving outward, it emerges at *Cunkou* [Inch Opening] and travels upward to the inner side of the elbow, entering beneath the great tendon. It curves inward, ascending along *Xieyin* [Armpit Shadow], enters the armpit, then curves inward to course through the lung. This is the sequential order of its forward and reverse bends.*

*The pulse of the Heart Governor [Pericardium] Meridian emerges at the tip of the middle finger, curves inward, ascending along the inner side of the middle finger to pause in the palm. It runs concealed between the two bones, then curves outward, emerging between the two tendons at the junction of bone and flesh. Its qi is smooth and fluid, ascending two inches outward before curving to run between the two tendons, reaching the inner side of the elbow. It enters beneath the small tendon, pausing at the convergence of the two bones, then ascends into the chest, internally connecting with the Heart’s vessels."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"The Hand Shaoyin [Heart] Meridian alone lacks a pulse—why is this?"*

Qi Bo replied: *"Shaoyin is the Heart’s meridian. The Heart is the sovereign of the five zang and six fu, the dwelling of spirit and mind. Its vessel is firm and unyielding—evil cannot penetrate it. If it did, the Heart would be injured, the spirit would depart, and death would follow. Thus, all evils that afflict the Heart lodge in its *baoguo* [envelope]. The *baoguo* is the pulse of the Heart Governor, hence its absence of a superficial pulse."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"If the Shaoyin lacks a pulse, does it not fall ill?"*

Qi Bo replied: *"Its external pathways may fall ill while the zang remains unharmed. Thus, one treats only its meridian at the sharp bone’s tip on the posterior wrist. The remaining pulses—their entry, exit, bends, and varying speeds—all follow the pattern of the Hand Shaoyin [Heart] Meridian. Therefore, the original pulses are treated according to the ebb and flow of their qi—whether deficient or replete, swift or slow—this is called *following the surge to drain* and *following decline to supplement*. Thus, evil qi departs, and true qi is fortified. This is called *conforming to Heaven’s order*."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How does one grasp the needle and adjust its insertion?"*

Qi Bo replied: *"One must first clearly know the origins and terminations of the twelve meridians, the cold and heat of the skin, and the ebb and flow of the pulses. If the pulse is smooth and robust, the illness advances daily. If it is empty and fine, it may endure for some time. If it is large yet rough, it signifies pain and numbness. If yin and yang pulses are equal, the illness is hard to treat. If the origin and termination remain warm, the illness persists. If the warmth declines, the illness departs.*

*Measure the cubit, examining the flesh’s firmness or fragility, its size, smoothness or roughness, cold or warmth, dryness or moisture. Observe the five colors of the eyes to discern the five zang and determine life or death. Examine the blood vessels, noting their hue, to know of cold, heat, pain, or numbness."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I still do not grasp the method of needle insertion and withdrawal."*

Qi Bo replied: *"The Dao of holding the needle requires steadiness and uprightness, calmness and stillness. One must first discern deficiency and repletion, then adjust speed accordingly. The left hand grasps the bone, while the right follows the meridian, ensuring no contact with the fruit of the bone. When draining, maintain uprightness and precision; when supplementing, close the skin and guide the qi with the needle. Thus, evil qi is expelled, and true qi takes residence."*

The Yellow Emperor asked Qi Bo: *"How does one prick the skin to release stagnation?"*

Qi Bo replied: *"Follow the divisions of the flesh. Separate the skin to the left, gently insert the needle, and adjust it slowly. The spirit remains undisturbed, and evil qi departs."*

The Yellow Emperor asked Qi Bo: *"There are eight hollows in the body—how does one diagnose them?"*

Qi Bo answered: *"By observing the five zang."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"How does one diagnose them?"*

Qi Bo replied: *"If the Lung or Heart harbors evil, its qi lingers at both elbows. If the Liver is afflicted, its qi flows to both armpits. If the Spleen is afflicted, its qi lingers at both sides of the waist. If the Kidneys are afflicted, its qi lingers at both cheeks. These eight hollows are the chambers of the joints, through which true qi passes and blood vessels wander. Evil qi and corrupt blood cannot dwell there—if they do, they injure tendons, vessels, bones, and joints, preventing the joints from bending and extending. Hence, the illness becomes *luan* [contracted]."*

The Yellow Emperor asked the Master of Fewer:

*"I have heard that there are yin and yang in people—what is meant by a yin-person? What is meant by a yang-person?"*

The Master of Fewer replied:
*"Between Heaven and Earth, within the six directions, nothing departs from the Five Phases. Humans correspond to them, not merely as one yin and one yang alone, but broadly speaking—words cannot exhaust their full meaning. The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish to hear their essence briefly. Are there wise and virtuous people who can embody this fully?"*

The Master of Fewer answered:
*"There are those of Great Yin, Lesser Yin, Great Yang, Lesser Yang, and those of Harmonized Yin-Yang. These five types differ in demeanor, and their tendons, bones, qi, and blood are all unequal."*

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"How do they differ? May I hear?"*

The Master of Fewer replied:
*"The Great Yin-person is greedy yet unkind, his thoughts sink like murky water, he loves concealment but despises openness, his heart is harmonious yet unexpressed, he neglects the times, and acts only after others. This is the Great Yin-person.

The Lesser Yin-person is slightly greedy and deceitful, seeing others lose as if he gains, delighting in harm, and when others prosper, he grows resentful. His heart is cruel and without mercy—this is the Lesser Yin-person.

The Great Yang-person dwells in pomp, loves speaking grandly without substance, his ambitions spread far, his actions disregard right and wrong, and though his undertakings fail, he never regrets. This is the Great Yang-person.

The Lesser Yang-person holds himself in vain esteem, clings to petty rank, and though he seeks external favor, he lacks inner loyalty—this is the Lesser Yang-person.

The Harmonized Yin-Yang-person dwells quietly, without fear or excessive joy, yielding to circumstances, neither competing nor resisting, adapting with the times. Though honored, he remains modest, speaking without arrogance—this is the utmost balance.

Ancient masters of acupuncture and moxibustion observed these five dispositions before treating them: draining the excess, supplementing the deficient."*

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"How does one treat these five types?"*

The Master of Fewer replied:
*"The Great Yin-person has much yin and little yang; his yin-blood is turbid, his defensive qi sluggish, yin and yang unharmonized, his tendons slack and his skin thick. If not drained promptly, his condition cannot be shifted.

The Lesser Yin-person has much yin and little yang, a small stomach and large intestines, his six bowels unregulated. His Yangming pulse is small, while his Taoyang pulse is large—adjustment must be precise, for his blood is prone to collapse and his qi to decay.

The Great Yang-person has much yang and little yin—adjustment must be cautious, lest his yin be drained and his yang over-drained. If yang is excessively drained, he may fall into madness; if both yin and yang are drained, he dies suddenly without recognition.

The Lesser Yang-person has much yang and little yin, his channels small but his collaterals large, his blood concentrated internally while his qi disperses outward. Though his yin is solid, his yang is hollow—if only his collaterals are drained, he grows strong, but his qi collapses swiftly, his central qi insufficient, and the illness worsens.

The Harmonized Yin-Yang-person has balanced yin and yang, his blood and vessels regulated. Carefully diagnose his yin and yang, observe the presence or absence of evil, assess his demeanor and posture, determine excess or deficiency, drain the excess, supplement the deficient, and if neither is extreme, follow the channels. This is how one harmonizes yin and yang and distinguishes the five types."*

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"If these five types meet unexpectedly, how can one distinguish them?"*

The Master of Fewer answered:
*"Common people do not resemble these five types, so among twenty-five people, none may match them. The five types are especially distinct from the crowd."*

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"How does one distinguish the five types?"*

The Master of Fewer replied:
*"The Great Yin-person appears dark and murky, his thoughts sink heavily, his stature is tall and imposing, his cheeks sunken—this is the Great Yin-person.

The Lesser Yin-person appears sly and furtive, his yin-nature deceitful. He stands with agitation, walks hunched—this is the Lesser Yin-person.

The Great Yang-person appears haughty and arrogant, his body twisted, his cheeks sunken—this is the Great Yang-person.

The Lesser Yang-person stands with his head tilted back, walks swaying, his arms and elbows often jutting from his back—this is the Lesser Yang-person.

The Harmonized Yin-Yang-person appears composed and natural, clear and serene, cheerful and gentle, dignified and modest—common people call him a true gentleman. This is the Harmonized Yin-Yang-person."*

The pulse of the **Lesser Yin** is dark and straight—*ànzhí-rěn*[^1].
The **virtue/power** of the **Lesser Yin** is **sly and deceptive**—*sǒucí-lǜ*[^2].

Huangdi asked Qibó: *"I have heard of the Nine Needles from my teacher, and their applications are numerous beyond counting. I have reviewed them and condensed them into one system. I recite them, and you discern their principles. If I err, correct me. Please establish the Dao/Way so that it may endure in transmission, and future generations will face no difficulty. Only pass it to the worthy—if not, do not speak of it."*

Qibó bowed twice in respect: *"Please, I shall listen to the Sage-King’s Dao/Way."*

Huangdi said: *"The principles of acupuncture must know the location of form and **qi**—left and right, above and below, the exterior and interior of yin and yang, the abundance or scarcity of blood and **qi**, their direction of flow (whether inverse or顺, *shùn*), and the proper depth of insertion and withdrawal. One must measure the efficacy of treatment to avoid excess. Know how to resolve rigidity, how to supplement deficiency and drain excess, how to regulate the upper and lower **qi** gates, and how to make the channels clear and connect with the Four Seas. Carefully determine their locations: when **qi** struggles between cold and heat, or when exposed to wind and rain, adjust and harmonize accordingly. Understand how to regulate **qi**, grasp the pathways of the channels, know the connections of the left and right limbs#1, and fully comprehend their junctions.

When yin and yang are not in harmony, one knows the time of onset. By examining the beginning and end, discerning the cold and heat, and locating the pathogenic **qi**, even ten thousand needlings will not fail. Thus, one knows the nine functions of the needles, and the Dao/Way of needling is complete.

Understanding the Five Outputs#3, one knows where the **qi** flows swiftly or slowly, and the proper flexion, extension, insertion, and withdrawal all follow clear principles. When yin and yang#3 are combined with the Five Phases, the Five Zàng organs and Six Fǔ viscera also have their own hidden correspondences. The Four Seasons and Eight Winds all contain yin and yang, each occupying its proper place and aligning with the Bright Hall#2. Observing their respective color divisions, one examines where pain arises in the Five Zàng organs and Six Fǔ viscera—left, right, above, or below—and knows whether the **qi** is cold or warm, which channel is affected.

Carefully assessing the cold, warm, smooth, or rough nature of the skin, one knows where the patient suffers. The diaphragm has upper and lower aspects, and one must know where the **qi** resides. First, grasp the Dao/Way, then needle sparsely and loosely, gradually probing while leaving the needle in place, thus achieving a gradual insertion.

If great heat is above, push it downward; if **qi** rises from below, draw it away. For pain in front, always take the point first.

If great cold is outside, retain the needle to supplement; if it enters the interior, follow the method of draining excess.

Where acupuncture fails, moxibustion is appropriate. If the upper **qi** is insufficient, push and elevate it; if the lower **qi** is insufficient, accumulate and follow its flow. When both yin and yang are deficient, fire will naturally correct it.

In cases of severe cold with sudden onset, if the bone channels sink downward or cold descends past the knee to three *lǐ* below, where the yin vessels pass, retain the needle to stop it. If cold enters the interior, push and disperse it. Where channels sink downward, fire will correct them; where rigid vessels are tightly bound, fire will treat them.

If one does not know where the suffering lies, needling below the *liángjiāo*#2 points—whether male yin or female yang—is forbidden to skilled practitioners. Thus concludes the discourse on needling.*

*The proper use of needles must follow established principles: observe celestial light above, align with the Eight Correct#2 below, and thereby avoid strange pathogenic influences. Examine the people’s conditions, distinguishing deficiency from excess, and do not violate their pathogenic **qi**. This way, one attains the Heavenly Dew, meets the year’s emptiness, and rescues without overpowering—otherwise, one risks inviting retribution.

Hence it is said: ‘One must know the Heavenly Prohibitions before speaking of acupuncture intent.’*

*Modeling oneself on the past and verifying with the present, observing the hidden and understanding the boundless, the refined practitioner values what the coarse cannot see—like the hair’s tip exposed. The pathogenic **qi** entering the body, when stirred by alcohol, causes movement in the form. When the proper and pathogenic **qi** enter the body, subtle changes first appear in the complexion. One may not perceive them on the body itself—sometimes present, sometimes absent, sometimes lost, sometimes retained—with or without visible form, and no one knows their true nature.*

*Therefore, the superior practitioner takes **qi** before its sprouting; the inferior practitioner waits until it has fully manifested, then damages the form by treating it.*

Is thus the method of the practitioner’s use of acupuncture: knowing where the **qi** resides, and guarding its pathways, clear in regulating **qi**, filling and emptying as needed, adjusting the speed of insertion and withdrawal, and choosing the proper points for treatment.

Filling must employ a circular motion—cutting and turning, so that the **qi** may flow. Withdrawing swiftly yet exiting slowly, the pathogenic **qi** is expelled; extending to meet it, enlarging the orifice distantly, the **qi** exits swiftly.

Supplementing must employ a square motion—drawing outward the skin, aligning it with the pathway, pulling leftward at the pivot, pushing rightward at the flesh, rotating gently yet pushing steadily, ensuring precision, maintaining correctness, achieving tranquility, steadfastness of heart without wavering, intending subtlety to preserve, then driving the **qi** downward and withdrawing it swiftly. Covering the skin, sealing the outer pathway, the true **qi** is thus retained.

The essentials of acupuncture: never forget its spiritual principle.

Leigong asked the Yellow Emperor: *"The Needle Treatise* says: ‘Only teach those worthy of it; do not instruct those unworthy.’ How does one know if they can be taught?"

The Yellow Emperor replied: "Each finds their own worthy student, entrusting them according to their ability. Thus they can clarify the practice."

Leigong said: "I wish to hear how abilities are matched to roles."

The Yellow Emperor said: "Those with keen vision may be taught to observe complexion; those with acute hearing may be taught to listen for sounds; those with quick speech and agile words may be taught to expound theories; those whose speech is slow yet calm, whose hands are skillful yet whose minds are steady and discerning, may be taught to apply needles and moxa, to regulate blood and **qi**, and to harmonize all disorders—whether inverted or upright, and to discern yin and yang while mastering all directions.

Those with gentle movements, supple sinews, and harmonious minds may be taught to guide **qi** through exercises; those whose words are swift yet whose actions are light, who scorn others yet possess sharp wit, may be taught to cure disease through spittle and incantations; those with painful nails, poisonous hands, and a tendency to harm others through their work, may be taught to press accumulations and suppress stiffness.

Each finds their own match in ability, then the method may be practiced, and their name shall be renowned. If one does not find their worthy student, their skill shall not be perfected, and their teacher shall be without merit."

Thus it is said: *"Only when one finds the right person should the teaching be spoken; if not the right person, do not transmit it."* This is what is meant.

Those whose hands are poisonous may be taught to test by pressing the tortoise—placing the tortoise beneath a vessel and pressing upon it, and in fifty days it shall die. Those whose hands are gentle may restore it to life as before.

**Huangdi asked Qibo:**
*"I wish to diagnose without examining the complexion or taking the pulse, relying solely on the *cù* [尺] to speak of the disease, and from the exterior to know the interior. How should this be done?"*

**Qibo replied:**
*"Examine the *cù* for its slackness or tension, its smallness or largeness, its smoothness or roughness, the firmness or fragility of its flesh—thus the form of the disease is determined.*

*If one observes above the eye socket a slight ridge as if newly raised, and the neck pulse moves while the patient coughs, and when pressing the upper limbs and feet, the *guān* [官] pulse does not rise, this is *fēngshuǐ* [風水] with skin distension.*

*If the *cù* skin is smooth and its hollows glisten, this is wind.*
*If the *cù* flesh is weak, this is *jiěchuán* [解傳];*
*If one lies comfortably yet loses flesh, this is cold-heat, and it is untreatable.*

*If the *cù* skin is smooth and greasy with luster, this is wind.*
*If the *cù* skin is rough, this is wind *bì* [痹].*
*If the *cù* skin is coarse like the scales of a dried fish, this is *yānyǐn* [水泱飲] (water stagnation).*
*If the *cù* skin is intensely hot and the pulse is strong and restless, this is *wēn* disease [溫病];*
*If the pulse is strong and smooth, the disease is about to surface.*

*If the *cù* skin is cold and the pulse is small, this is diarrhea and *shǎo qì* [少氣] (weak breath).*
*If the *cù* skin is first hot then cold like a torch, this is cold-heat.*
*If the *cù* skin is first cold, then after prolonged pressure becomes hot, this too is cold-heat.*

*If only the elbow is hot, the heat is above the waist;*
*If only the hand is hot, the heat is below the waist.*
*If only the front of the elbow is hot, the chest is hot;*
*If only the back of the elbow is hot, the shoulders and back are hot.*
*If the middle of the arm is hot, the waist and abdomen are hot;*
*If the back of the elbow and the rough *cù* below it for three or four inches are hot, there are worms in the intestines.*

*If the palm is hot, the abdomen is hot;*
*If the palm is cold, the abdomen is cold.*
*If the white flesh above the fish-like mark has greenish veins, there is cold in the stomach.*

*If the *cù* is hot like a torch and the *rényíng* [人迎] pulse is large, bloodletting is required.*
*If the *cù* is firm and large while the pulse is very small, with *shǎo qì* and increasing joy, death will come swiftly.*

*The eyes turn red—disease is in the heart;*
*White—disease is in the lungs;*
*Blue—disease is in the liver;*
*Yellow—disease is in the spleen;*
*Black—disease is in the kidneys.*

*If the yellow color cannot be named, the disease is in the chest.*
*Diagnosing eye pain: if the red veins descend from above and below, this is *Tàiyáng* disease [太陽病];*
*If they ascend from below, this is *Yángmíng* disease [陽明病];*
*If they move from the exterior inward, this is *Shàoyáng* disease [少陽病].*

*Diagnosing cold-heat: if the red veins move up and down to the pupil, and one vein is seen, death will come in one year;*
*If one and a half veins are seen, death will come in a year and a half;*
*If two veins are seen, death will come in two years;*
*If two and a half veins are seen, death will come in two and a half years;*
*If three veins are seen, death will come in three years.*

*Diagnosing tooth decay and pain: if the *yáng* [陽] pulse arrives with excess, the corresponding side alone will be hot—left for left, right for right, upper for upper, lower for lower.*

*Diagnosing blood vessels: if they are mostly red, there is excess heat;*
*If mostly blue, there is pain;*
*If mostly black, this is chronic *bì* [痹];*
*If red, black, and blue are all present, this is cold-heat.*

*If the body aches and the complexion is faintly yellow, if the teeth are yellow with plaque and the nails have yellow at the base, this is *huángdǎn* [黃疸] (jaundice).*
*If one lies comfortably, the urine is yellow-red, and the pulse is small and rough, this indicates no appetite.*

*If a patient’s *cùnkǒu* [寸口] pulse and *rényíng* [人迎] pulse are equal in size and depth, the disease is difficult to cure.*

*In women, if the *shǎo yīn* [少陰] pulse in the hand is violently moving, this indicates pregnancy.*

*In infants, if the hair on the head all stands upright, death is certain.*

*If the ear’s green veins rise, this indicates *chè téng* [掣痛] (sharp, drawing pain).*

*If the stool is red and flaky (*bàn* [瓣]), with diarrhea, and the pulse is small, the hands and feet will be cold, making recovery difficult;*
*If there is diarrhea, the pulse is small, but the hands and feet are warm, the diarrhea will resolve easily.*

*The changes of the four seasons, the dominance of cold and heat—when yin is excessive, yang must follow; when yang is excessive, yin must follow. Thus, yin governs cold, and yang governs heat. Therefore, extreme cold generates heat, and extreme heat generates cold. Hence, it is said: cold begets heat, and heat begets cold—this is the transformation of yin and yang.*

*Thus it is said:*
*Winter injury from cold leads to springtime pestilential heat;*
*Spring injury from wind leads to summer diarrhea and intestinal disorders;*
*Summer injury from heat leads to autumn *jùe nǜè* [疚疟] (intermittent fever);*
*Autumn injury from dampness leads to winter coughing.*

*This is called the sequence of the four seasons.*

The pronunciation is *jùrán* (as in *jù* + *rán*) and *xǔrán* (also written). *Qǔqiū yǔ* (齲丘禹切) refers to tooth decay (*chǐdù* 齿蠹). *Chèchǐ* (掣尺列切).

*Jùe nǜè* (疚疟), pronounced with *jiù* (上音皆), is a form of intermittent fever marked by emaciation.

**Section 75: *Zhēn Jié* (Needling Techniques)**

The Yellow Emperor asked Qìbó:
*"I have heard that needling has five stages—how so?"*

Qìbó replied:
*"Indeed, there are five stages. The first is **vibrating dust** (*zhènāi*), the second is **lifting the veil** (*fāméng*), the third is **removing claws** (*qùzhuǎ*), the fourth is **piercing garments** (*chèyī*), and the fifth is **dispelling confusion** (*jiěhuò*)."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"Master, when you speak of these five stages, I do not yet grasp their meaning."*

Qìbó explained:
*"**Vibrating dust** refers to needling the **external channels** (#9), to dispel **yang disorders**; **lifting the veil** refers to needling the **convergence points** (*fǔshū*), to dispel **organ disorders**; **removing claws** refers to needling the **joints, limbs, and networks** (#10); **piercing garments** means exhaustively needling the **odd convergence points of all yang channels**; and **dispelling confusion** means fully understanding how to **harmonize yin and yang**, to **supplement what is deficient and drain what is excessive**, and to **adjust imbalances**."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"When you speak of the stage *vibrating dust*, you say it involves needling the external channels to dispel yang disorders—but I do not understand what you mean. I wish to hear it fully."*

Qìbó replied:
*"When **vibrating dust** occurs, **yang qi is severely disordered**, surging upward and filling the chest. The patient **clenches their shoulders**, **breathes with restraint**, and **struggles for breath**, gasping and wheezing as if **repulsed by dust and smoke**. Their **diaphragm is locked**, and they **cannot exhale**—this is what is meant by *vibrating dust*. Even speaking of it now is **more urgent than the condition itself**."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"Excellent. How should one treat it?"*

Qìbó replied:
*"Treat it by needling **Tiānróng** [Celestial Container]."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"If coughing, upward breath, and chest pain persist, how should one treat it?"*

Qìbó replied:
*"Needle **Liánquán** [Junction Spring]."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"Are there fixed limits for these treatments?"*

Qìbó replied:
*"When needling **Tiānróng**, do not exceed one *cù* [~1.3 cm]. When needling **Liánquán**, bleed until the blood changes color before stopping."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"Excellent."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"When you speak of *opening the veil*, I do not grasp its meaning. What is *opening the veil*? The patient hears nothing, sees nothing—yet you say to needle the **palaces and conduits** to dispel **palace disorders**. Why is this so? I wish to hear the reason."*

Qìbó replied:
*"A profound question indeed! This is the essence of acupuncture, the pinnacle of needle technique, the realm of divine insight—words and texts cannot fully convey it. Let me speak of *opening the veil*, for even this is urgent beyond description."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"Excellent. I wish to hear it fully."*

Qìbó replied:
*"To treat this, it must be done at **high noon**. Needle **Tīnggōng** [Palace of Hearing], striking the **pupil**. The sound will reach the ears—this is its conduit."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"Excellent. What do you mean by *the sound reaching the ears*?"*

Qìbó replied:
*"Needle the **pathogenic qi** while firmly pressing both nostrils with your hand, then swiftly lie down. The sound will surely respond to the needle."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"Excellent. This is what is meant by *acting unseen yet unseen, without sight yet taking action*—where divine insight aligns."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"When you speak of *removing claws*, you say to needle **joints and limb networks**—I wish to hear it fully."*

Qìbó replied:
*"The **lumbar and spine** are the body’s great joints; the **limb channels** are the pathways for movement. The **penis** is the body’s mechanism, the marker of **yin essence**, the conduit of **bodily fluids**. Thus, if diet is unregulated and emotions untimed, bodily fluids overflow inward, pooling in the **testicles**. When **blood pathways** are blocked, the **penis** remains erect without rest, bending and straightening becomes difficult, and movement is impaired. This condition resembles **water swelling**—neither ascending nor descending—visible like **metal and stone**, never concealed. Hence, it is called *removing claws*."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"Excellent."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"When you speak of *piercing garments*, you say to exhaustively needle all **yang’s extraordinary conduits**—yet there is no fixed location. I wish to hear it fully."*

Qìbó replied:
*"This is when **yang qi is excessive** while **yin qi is deficient**. If **yin is deficient**, internal heat arises; if **yang is excessive**, external heat follows. When internal heat converges, the chest burns like **embracing hot coals**. Externally, the patient fears **silk and cotton**, unable to bear nearness—neither to the body nor to bedding. When **pathways are obstructed**, sweat does not emerge. The tongue becomes **parched**, the lips **dry and cracked**, thirst unquenchable. They reject neither fine nor coarse foods."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"Excellent. How should one treat it?"*

Qìbó replied:
*"Needle **Tiānfǔ** [Celestial Warehouse], **Dàzhú** [Great Spine], and **Sānjié** [Three Deficiencies], and also needle **Zhōnglǒu** [Central Hollow] to dispel the heat. Supplement **Foot Hand Taiyin** [Spleen channel] to regulate sweat. When heat is gone and sweat is balanced, the condition resolves faster than *piercing garments*."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"Excellent."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"When you speak of *dispelling confusion*, you say to fully know how to **harmonize yin and yang**, to **supplement and drain excess and deficiency**, and to **shift imbalances**—how does this **dispel confusion**?"*

Qìbó replied:
*"When **great wind** afflicts the body, **blood and vessels** become uneven—**deficient** where lacking, **excessive** where full. Lightness and heaviness are unbalanced; the patient **lurches and tilts**, **stumbles without direction**, unaware of **west or east**, **north or south**, **ascending or descending**, **turning or overturning**—precisely **upside-down**, worse than mere confusion."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"Excellent. How should one treat it?"*

Qìbó replied:
*"Drain the excess, supplement the deficient, and restore **yin and yang** balance. Using the needle thus resolves confusion more swiftly."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"Excellent. I shall store this in the **Spiritual Orchid Chamber**, daring not to reveal it lightly."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"I have heard that acupuncture addresses **five perversions**—what are they?"*

Qìbó replied:
*"Diseases include those with **persistent rigidity**, **excessive swelling**, **constriction**, **heat**, and **cold**—these are the **five perversions**."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"How does one needle the **five perversions**?"*

Qìbó replied:
*"For all methods of needling the **five perversions**, there are no more than **five principles**:
- For **rigidity**, do not **meet the ridge** [of the spine]. Transform **common qi** to **adaptive nature**, avoid **pus formation**. If **fragile pathways** shift, remove the needle from its original site. If the patient is **unstable**, disperse the condition.
- For **excessive swelling**, gradually reduce size. Drain the excess, then supplement the deficient. **Sever the connection**, needle the **pathogenic qi**, and ensure **muscle adherence**. Observe for **no residue**, restore the **true qi**, and needle the **yang divisions of the flesh**.
- For **constriction**, gradually enlarge. Supplement the deficient to avoid harm. Observe its location and **meet the boundary**. If it cannot be **externally reached**, approach it **indirectly** until it **self-dissipates**, then needle the **flesh divisions**.
- For **heat**, **pierce and drain** until **blue-green** [indicating resolution], ensuring the **pathogenic qi escapes** without return. **Open pathways**, **unlock gates**, and allow the **evil to exit**—the disease will then cease.
- For **cold**, apply **warmth gradually**, moving **slowly** to **attune the spirit**. When **gates are closed**, **qi does not scatter**, and **deficiency and excess** are balanced, the **qi will stabilize**."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"How does one choose the needle?"*

Qìbó replied:
*"For **rigidity**, use a **metal needle**; for **excessive swelling**, a **sharp needle**; for **constriction**, a **round, sharp needle**; for **heat**, a **fine needle**; for **cold**, a **hair-thin needle**."*

*"Let me speak of **resolving theories**—harmonizing with **Heaven and Earth**, aligning with the **four seasons**, as humans **participate in Heaven and Earth**, thus able to resolve [disease]."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"When **gradual** (jiàn) **obstruction** (gā) occurs below and **reed-like** (wéi pú) **obstruction** arises above, this is how one discerns the **variation in form and *qi***."

*"**Yin and Yang** refer to **cold and heat**. When **heat** prevails, it engenders **rain** and manifests above, with **roots yellowing** and **juices diminishing**. Then, **human *qi* resides externally**, the **skin becomes slack**, the **defensive pathways** open, **blood and *qi* flow freely**, and **sweat pours out abundantly**, making the **skin moist and glistening**.

When **cold** prevails, the **earth congeals** and **water freezes**, while **human *qi* remains inward**, the **skin tightens**, the **defensive pathways close**, **sweat does not emerge**, **blood and *qi* grow strong**, and the **flesh becomes firm and dry**.

At such times, those skilled in **draining water** cannot proceed to **ice**; those adept at **piercing earth** cannot **break through frozen ground**. Even those proficient in **needling** cannot **extract the four *jùés*** (obstructions). If **blood vessels congeal** and **solidify**, preventing **free circulation**, they cannot yet be treated as **softened**.

Thus, **draining water** requires waiting until **Heaven’s warmth thaws the ice**, the **frost dissolves**, and **water can flow**; only then can **earth be pierced**. **Human vessels** are the same—when treating **obstruction**, one must first **warm and harmonize the channels**, adjusting **palms to armpits**, **elbows to knees**, and **neck to spine**. Once **fire *qi* circulates**, the **blood vessels flow**, and then one may **examine the disease**. If the **pulse is slack and glistening**, needle and **level it**; if **tight and firm**, **pierce and disperse it**. When the **obstructed *qi* descends**, the condition ceases—this is called **resolving congealed *qi***.

The **categories of needling** lie in **balancing *qi***—when *qi* **congests in the stomach**, it is **dispersed to harmonize the defensive and nutritive pathways**, each **following its proper course**. **Prenatal *qi*** (zōngqì) **lingers in the Sea of *Qi*** (Hǎi), its **lower aspect** **converges at the *Qi* Street** (Qìjiē), and its **upper aspect** **ascends through the Breathing Pathway** (Xìdào). Thus, if **obstruction occurs in the feet**, **prenatal *qi* does not descend**, and the **blood within the pulse congeals**, **stagnating**—unless **warmed with fire**, it cannot be **drawn out**. The **needler must first observe** the **fullness or emptiness** of the **channels and collaterals**, **probing and tracing them**, **pressing and percussing**, and **needling where the *qi* responds** before **extracting and descending it**.

When the **Six Channels** are **balanced**, it is called **no disease**; even if **diseased**, it is called **self-correction**. If **one channel** is **upperly full and lowerly empty**, **blocked**, it must have **crossing collaterals** **excessively pressing upon the main channel**, **obstructing its flow**. **Observe and disperse them**—this is called **resolving congealed *qi***.

For **upper cold and lower heat**, first needle the **Neck’s Greater Yang** (Tǎiyáng), **retaining the needle for a long time**. After needling, **warm the neck and shoulders**, allowing the **heat to descend** and **merge** until the condition ceases—this is called **pushing upward**.

For **upper heat and lower cold**, **observe the empty pulse** and **insert it into the channels and collaterals** to **extract the obstruction**; when the *qi* **descends**, the condition ceases—this is called **drawing downward**.

For **severe heat throughout the body**, where one **rages and sees, hears, and speaks delusions** (wànjiàn, wànwén, wàngyán), needle the **Foot’s Greater Yang Brightness** (Yángmíng) **channel and its major collaterals**. **Supplement the empty**, and **dispersion the full**—**blood**—and then, **with the patient reclining**, **stand at the head**, using **both hands’ four fingers** to **clasp and press the carotid pulse**, holding firmly. **Roll and push downward**, reaching the **mid-sternum** (Quēpén), then **return as before**. When the **heat departs**, the condition ceases—this is called **pushing and dispersing**.

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"There is a pulse that generates **dozens of diseases**—some **painful**, some **obstructed**, some **hot**, some **cold**, some **itchy**, some **numb**, some **unresponsive**—endless **transformations**. What is its cause?"*

Qìbó replied:
*"These all arise from **evil *qi***. The Yellow Emperor said: *"I have heard that *qi* has **True *Qi*** (Zhēnqì), **Proper *Qi*** (Zhèngqì), and **Evil *Qi*** (Xiéqì). What is **True *Qi***?"*

Qìbó replied:
*"**True *Qi*** is what one **receives from Heaven**, **conjoined with grain *qi*** (gǔqì) to **fill the body**. **Proper *Qi*** is **correcting wind** (Zhèngfēng), **coming from one direction**, neither **excessive wind** nor **deficient wind**. **Evil *Qi*** is the **harmful wind** (Xūfēng) that **assaults and injures** people. When it **penetrates deeply**, it **cannot depart on its own**. **Correcting wind**, however, **penetrates shallowly**, **merging and departing naturally**. Its **gentle and weak** nature **cannot overcome True *Qi***, so it **departs of its own accord**."*

*"When **deficient evil** penetrates the body, it **stirs the form** with **alcohol-like agitation** (jiǔzhì), **raises the body hair**, and **opens the defensive pathways**. If it **enters deeply**, it **internally assails the bones**, causing **bone numbness** (gǔbì). If it **assails the sinews**, it causes **sinew spasm** (jīnluán). If it **confronts the pulse**, it **blocks the blood**, **resulting in obstruction**. If it **assails the flesh**, it **clashes with defensive *qi***—when **Yang prevails**, it causes **heat**; when **Yin prevails**, it causes **cold**. **Cold** drives **True *Qi* away**; **True *Qi* departs**, leaving **emptiness**; **emptiness** **engenders cold**.*

If it **confronts between the skin and flesh**, its **evil *qi* manifests externally**, **opening the defensive pathways**, **spreading the body hair**, and **allowing *qi* to circulate freely**—this causes **itching** (yǎng). If it **lingers without departing**, it causes **numbness** (bì). When **defensive *qi* does not circulate**, it **shuts down** like **a shot horse**, causing **unresponsiveness** (bùrén).

When **deficient evil** **concentrates in the body’s half**, and **penetrates deeply**, it **resides internally in the nutritive and defensive pathways**. As the **nutritive and defensive pathways gradually decline**, **True *Qi* departs**, and **evil *qi* remains alone**, **manifesting as hemiplegia** (piāngǔ).

If the **evil *qi* is shallow**, it causes **pulse pain on one side** (piāntòng).

When **deficient evil** **deeply enters the body**, **cold and heat clash**, **lingering internally**—if **cold overcomes heat**, it causes **bone pain and flesh withering** (ròujī). If **heat overcomes cold**, it **rots the flesh**, **corrupts the muscles**, and **forms pus**; internally, it **injures the bones**, **leading to bone necrosis** (gǔshí).

If **a sinew suddenly contracts**, the **sinew bends and cannot extend**, and **evil *qi* lodges between them**, **unable to reverse**, it **manifests as sinew obstruction** (jīnliú).

If **a mass forms**, **with *qi* converging** and **defensive *qi* lingering**, it **cannot reverse**, and **fluids stagnate over time**, **merging to form intestinal masses** (chángliú)—if **lingering for years**, they **become firm** under hand pressure.

If **a mass forms** and **fluids stagnate**, **evil *qi* invades it**, **congealing and worsening daily**, **clustering together**, it **becomes a cancerous tumor** (yīnliú)—**firm under hand pressure**.

If **a mass forms** and **deeply invades the bone**, **with *qi* adhering to the bone**, the **bone and *qi* grow ever larger**, it **becomes bone cancer** (gǔjù).

If **a mass forms** and **invades the flesh**, **with prenatal *qi* converging**, and **evil *qi* lingering without departing**, it **forms pus if there is heat**, or **flesh cancer** (ròujù) **if there is none**.

「In general, these several *qi* movements have no fixed locations where they manifest, yet they bear constant names.

*(Huangdi Neijing Lingshu Jizhu, Volume 22, *Weìqì Xíng* [The Movement of Defensive *Qi*], Chapter 76.)」

The Yellow Emperor asked Qìbó#1, saying: *"I wish to hear of the movement of Defensive *Qi* and its ebb and flow in conjunction with the day and night—how does it proceed?"*

Qíbó Gāo replied: *"The year has twelve months, the day has twelve *chén* [time divisions], with *Zǐ* [Midnight] and *Wǔ* [Noon] as the *jīng* [vertical meridians], and *Mǎo* [5 AM] and *Yǒu* [5 PM] as the *wěi* [horizontal meridians]. The heavens encompass twenty-eight *xiù* [constellations], and each constellation has seven stars, making four times seven—twenty-eight stars in total—with *Fáng* [Room] and *Xiè* [Arrow] as the horizontal meridians, and *Xū* [Empty] and *Zhāng* [Full] as the vertical meridians.

Thus, from *Fáng* to *Bì* [Gradation] is *yáng* [Yang], and from *Áng* [Upright] to *Wěi* [Tail] is *yīn* [Yin]. *Yáng* governs the day, *yīn* governs the night. Therefore, the Defensive *Qi* circulates fifty times through the body in one day and night, twenty-five times in the *yáng* channels during the day, and twenty-five times in the *yīn* channels at night, completing a full cycle through the five *zàng* [viscera]#2.

Hence, on a balanced day, when *yīn* is fully exhausted, *yáng qi* emerges from the eyes. When the eyes open, the *qi* ascends to the head, then follows the *Tàiyáng* [Greater Yang] pathway down the nape to the tips of the toes. Its dispersed branches diverge from the eyes at the *Ruìbì* [Sharp Division], descend along the hand’s *Tàiyáng* channel, and reach the outer lateral side of the little finger’s joint. Its dispersed branches also diverge from the eyes at the *Ruìbì*, descend along the foot’s *Shàoyáng* [Lesser Yang] channel, and enter the joint between the little and second toes. Above, it follows the *Shàoyáng* [Lesser Yang] division of the hand, descending to the joint of the little finger#3. The diverging branches ascend to the ear’s front, converge with the *Kēmài* [Jaw Pulse], descend along the foot’s *Yángmíng* [Yang Brilliance], and proceed downward to the *Dù* [Knee] joint, entering the spaces between the five toes.

When dispersed, it descends from beneath the ear along the hand’s *Yángmíng* channel, entering the joint of the thumb, and reaching the center of the palm. When it reaches the foot, it enters the sole, emerges beneath the inner ankle, travels along the *yīn* divisions, and returns to converge with the eyes, thus completing one cycle.

Therefore, when the Defensive *Qi* travels one *shě* [segment], the human *qi* circulates one full cycle through the body plus eight-tenths of a segment#4; when it travels two *shě*, the human *qi* circulates three full cycles plus six-tenths of a segment#5; when it travels three *shě*, the human *qi* circulates five full cycles plus four-tenths of a segment; when it travels four *shě*, the human *qi* circulates seven full cycles plus two-tenths of a segment; when it travels five *shě*, the human *qi* circulates nine full cycles; when it travels six *shě*, the human *qi* circulates ten full cycles plus eight-tenths of a segment; when it travels seven *shě*, the human *qi* circulates twelve full cycles plus six-tenths of a segment; when it travels fourteen *shě*, the human *qi* completes twenty-five full cycles plus two-tenths of a segment, marking the exhaustion of *yáng* and the commencement of *yīn*, which then receives the *qi*.

When the Defensive *Qi* first enters the *yīn* divisions, it consistently ascends from the foot’s *Shàoyǐn* [Lesser Yin] channel to the kidney, then to the heart, the heart to the lungs, the lungs to the liver, the liver to the spleen, and finally the spleen returns to the kidney, completing one cycle.

Thus, when the Defensive *Qi* travels one *shě* at night, the human *qi* circulates once through the *yīn zàng* [viscera] plus eight-tenths of a segment, equivalent to twenty-five cycles of *yáng* circulation, and then converges again with the eyes. In one day and night, the combined circulation of *yáng* and *yīn* Defensive *Qi* is twenty-five full cycles plus two-tenths of a segment#6, and ten full cycles through the viscera#7. Hence, the reason why some people awaken earlier or later is due to the incomplete exhaustion of the *qi*’s odd fractions.

The Yellow Emperor said: *"The Defensive *Qi* within the body moves upward and downward without fixed intervals. How should one observe the *qi* and apply acupuncture accordingly?"*

Qíbó Gāo replied: *"The divisions vary in extent, and the days differ in length. Spring, autumn, winter, and summer each have their own proportions and principles. Therefore, one must always take *píngdàn* [Dawn] as the starting point and the end of night as the beginning.

Thus, one day and night comprises a hundred *kè* [moments], with twenty-five *kè* marking half a day’s measure. It is always thus without variation, ceasing when the sun sets and following the day’s length and shortness as reference points for observation and treatment.

If one carefully observes the timing, the disease can be accurately predicted; if one misses the timing and observes in reverse, no disease can be cured. Hence it is said: ‘To treat *shí* [repletion], one must puncture at its arrival; to treat *xū* [depletion], one must puncture at its departure.’ This refers to the moments of the *qi*’s presence or absence, observing depletion and repletion to determine the acupuncture treatment.

Therefore, one must carefully observe where the Defensive *Qi* resides and puncture accordingly—this is called *féngshí* [Meeting the Timing]. If a disease lies in the three *yáng* channels, one must observe when the Defensive *Qi* is in the *yáng* divisions before puncturing; if a disease lies in the three *yīn* channels, one must observe when the Defensive *Qi* is in the *yīn* divisions before puncturing.

When the Defensive *Qi* has descended one *kè*, the human *Qi* is in the *Tàiyáng* channel; when it has descended two *kè*, the human *Qi* is in the *Shàoyáng* channel; when it has descended three *kè*, the human *Qi* is in the *Yángmíng* channel; when it has descended four *kè*, the human *Qi* is in the *yīn* divisions. When it has descended five *kè*, the human *Qi* is in the *Tàiyáng* channel; when it has descended six *kè*, the human *Qi* is in the *Shàoyáng* channel; when it has descended seven *kè*, the human *Qi* is in the *Yángmíng* channel; when it has descended eight *kè*, the human *Qi* is in the *yīn* divisions. When it has descended nine *kè*, the human *Qi* is in the *Tàiyáng* channel; when it has descended ten *kè*, the human *Qi* is in the *Shàoyáng* channel; when it has descended eleven *kè*, the human *Qi* is in the *Yángmíng* channel; when it has descended twelve *kè*, the human *Qi* is in the *yīn* divisions. When it has descended thirteen *kè*, the human *Qi* is in the *Tàiyáng* channel; when it has descended fourteen *kè*, the human *Qi* is in the *Shàoyáng* channel; when it has descended fifteen *kè*, the human *Qi* is in the *Yángmíng* channel; when it has descended sixteen *kè*, the human *Qi* is in the *yīn* divisions. When it has descended seventeen *kè*, the human *Qi* is in the *Tàiyáng* channel; when it has descended eighteen *kè*, the human *Qi* is in the *Shàoyáng* channel; when it has descended nineteen *kè*, the human *Qi* is in the *Yángmíng* channel; when it has descended twenty *kè*, the human *Qi* is in the *yīn* divisions. When it has descended twenty-one *kè*, the human *Qi* is in the *Tàiyáng* channel; when it has descended twenty-two *kè*, the human *Qi* is in the *Shàoyáng* channel; when it has descended twenty-three *kè*, the human *Qi* is in the *Yángmíng* channel; when it has descended twenty-four *kè*, the human *Qi* is in the *yīn* divisions. When it has descended twenty-five *kè*, the human *Qi* is in the *Tàiyáng* channel—this marks half a day’s measure.

From *Fáng* to *Bì* is fourteen *shě*, descending fifty *kè* and completing half a day’s cycle; it then reverses its course, traveling one *shě*, descending three *kè* and four-sevenths of a *kè*."*

The essential principle states: When the sun’s *kè* accumulate upon the previous *xiù* (宿), the human *Qi* resides in the *Tàiyáng* channel. Therefore, as the sun travels one *shě* (舍), the human *Qi* flows through three *Yáng* channels and the *Yīn* divisions—ever thus without end. Heaven and Earth follow the same reckoning, their movements ceaseless and cyclical, completing a full day and night in a hundred *kè* before returning to their beginning.

**The Eight Winds of the Nine Palaces (Chapter Seventy-Seventh):**
The *Tàiyī* (太一) abides in the *Xūdiàn* (吁垫) Palace for forty-six days at the Winter Solstice; the next day, it resides in the *Tiānlíu* (天留) Palace for forty-six days; the following day, it resides in the *Cāngmén* (仓门) Palace for forty-six days; the next day, it resides in the *Yīnluò* (阴洛) Palace for forty-five days; the following day, it resides in the *Shàngtiān* (上天) Palace for forty-six days; the next day, it resides in the *Xuánwěi* (玄委) Palace for forty-six days; the following day, it resides in the *Cāngguǒ* (仓果) Palace for forty-six days; the next day, it resides in the *Xīnluò* (新洛) Palace for forty-five days; thereafter, it returns to the *Xūdiàn* Palace, marking the completion of the Winter Solstice cycle.

The *Tàiyī* traverses the Palaces daily: beginning at the Winter Solstice in the *Xūdiàn* Palace, it counts the days in sequence from one to nine, then reverses its course back to one, ever thus without end, completing its cycle.

When the *Tàiyī* shifts its abode, Heaven responds with wind and rain. If wind and rain occur on that day, it is auspicious, and the year will bring prosperity, contentment, and few illnesses. If the wind and rain precede its movement, there will be excessive rain; if they follow, there will be drought.

If the *Tàiyī* exhibits variation on the Winter Solstice, it portends changes in the ruler;
If it exhibits variation on the Spring Equinox, it portends changes in the minister;
If it exhibits variation on the Mid-Palace day, it portends changes in the officials;
If it exhibits variation on the Autumn Equinox, it portends changes in the generals;
If it exhibits variation on the Summer Solstice, it portends changes among the common people.

By "exhibits variation," it is meant that when the *Tàiyī* resides in the five Palaces, the winds cause disease: the *Dàruò* (大弱) Wind uproots trees, stirs sand and stones, each according to its governing influence, determining noble or ignoble outcomes based on the direction from which the wind arises.

If the wind comes from the Palace where the *Tàiyī* resides, it is called a *shí* (实) Wind, nurturing life and fostering all things;
If it comes from the Palace opposite its abode, it is called a *xū* (虚) Wind, harming people, bringing death and calamity.

Thus, the Sage avoids *xū* (虚) Winds, shunning the *xié* (邪) path daily like one evading arrows and stones. Evil winds cannot then harm, and this is the reason.

Therefore, when the *Tàiyī* enters and establishes itself in the central Palace, it surveys the eight winds to divine auspiciousness or inauspiciousness.

The wind from the south is called the *Dàruò* (大弱) Wind; its harm to humans lodges internally in the Heart, externally in the Pulse, and its *Qi* governs heat.
The wind from the southwest is called the *Móu* (谋) Wind; its harm lodges internally in the Spleen, externally in the muscles, and its *Qi* governs weakness.
The wind from the west is called the *Gāng* (刚) Wind; its harm lodges internally in the Lungs, externally in the skin, and its *Qi* governs dryness.
The wind from the northwest is called the *Zhé* (折) Wind; its harm lodges internally in the Small Intestine, externally in the *Tàiyáng* Pulse of the hand. If the pulse is severed, it overflows; if the pulse is closed, it stagnates and fails to flow, often resulting in sudden death.
The wind from the north is called the *Dàgāng* (大刚) Wind; its harm lodges internally in the Kidneys, externally in the bones and the sinews of the shoulders and back, and its *Qi* governs cold.
The wind from the northeast is called the *Xiōng* (凶) Wind; its harm lodges internally in the Large Intestine, externally in the ribs, armpits, clavicles, and limbs.
The wind from the east is called the *Yīngér* (婴儿) Wind; its harm lodges internally in the Liver, externally in the sinews and tendons, and its *Qi* governs dampness of the body.
The wind from the southeast is called the *Ruò* (弱) Wind; its harm lodges internally in the Stomach, externally in the muscles, and its *Qi* governs heaviness of the body.

These eight winds, when arising from their respective *xū* (虚) Palaces, can cause illness in humans. When three *xū* (虚) winds converge, they bring sudden violent illness and death.
When two *shí* (实) winds and one *xū* (虚) wind clash, illness manifests as *línlù* (淋露) with alternating cold and heat.
If one violates the wind’s damp and wet domains, it results in *wěi* (痿) paralysis.

Thus, the Sage avoids the winds as one avoids arrows and stones.

If one encounters three *xū* (虚) winds and is struck by an *xié* (邪) wind, it leads to sudden collapse and partial withering.

**The Nine Needles (Chapter Seventy-Eighth):**
The Yellow Emperor said: "I have heard of the Nine Needles from the Master, and they are vast and profound. Yet I still do not fully comprehend them. May I ask their origin and why they bear this name?"

Qībó (岐伯) replied: "The Nine Needles are the grand numbers of Heaven and Earth, beginning with one and ending with nine. Thus, it is said:
One follows the Dao of Heaven,
Two follows the Dao of Earth,
Three follows the Dao of humanity,
Four follows the Dao of the seasons,
Five follows the Dao of sound,
Six follows the Dao of law,
Seven follows the Dao of stars,
Eight follows the Dao of winds,
Nine follows the Dao of the wilds."

The Yellow Emperor said: "How does one apply the needles in response to these nine numbers?"

Qībó replied: "The Sage, in establishing the numbers of Heaven and Earth, took one and multiplied it by nine, thus creating the nine wilds. Nine times nine is eighty-one, which gave rise to the *Huángzhōng* (黄锺) reckoning. The needles are applied in accordance with these numbers.

One represents Heaven. Heaven is the *Yáng* (阳)."

The five *zàng* (内藏/viscera) that correspond to Heaven are the lungs. The lungs are the covering of the five *zàng* and six *fǔ* (外府/entrails), and the skin is their paired counterpart, the *yáng* (阳) of humanity. Therefore, when treating with needles, one must make its head large and its tip sharp, ensuring it does not penetrate deeply and allowing *yáng* qi to emerge.

Two represents Earth. The means by which humanity corresponds to soil is through the flesh. Therefore, when treating with needles, one must make its body hollow and its tip round, ensuring it does not harm the flesh. If it does, the qi will be exhausted.

Three represents humanity. The means by which humanity achieves life is through the blood and vessels. Therefore, when treating with needles, one must make its body broad and its tip round, allowing it to press upon the vessels without sinking in, so as to direct its qi and let the evil qi exit alone.

Four represents the seasons. The seasons and the eight winds are guests within the meridians and collaterals, causing painful *bìng* (病/illness). Therefore, when treating with needles, one must make its body hollow and its tip sharp, allowing it to disperse heat and draw out blood, thus exhausting the ailment.

Five represents sound. Sound divides winter and summer, distinguishing *yīn* (阴) and *yáng* (阳) at the *zǐ* (子) and *wǔ* (午) points. When cold and heat contend, the two qi clash, combining to form *tān* (痰/phlegm) and *nóng* (脓/pus). Therefore, when treating with needles, one must make its tip like a sword’s edge, allowing it to extract large pus.

Six represents law. Law harmonizes *yīn* and *yáng*, the four seasons, and the twelve primary meridians. When empty evils lodge in the meridians, they cause sudden *bì* (痹/numbness or stagnation). Therefore, when treating with needles, one must make its point like a *wù* (骛/falcon’s talon), both round and sharp, with a slightly enlarged middle, to extract sudden evil qi.

Seven represents stars. Stars correspond to the seven orifices of humanity. When evils lodge in the meridians and cause painful *bì* (痹), they reside in the collaterals. Therefore, when treating with needles, one must make its point like the proboscis of a mosquito or gnat, inserting gently and slowly, lingering briefly, allowing the correct qi to follow, so that both true and false evils depart, and the needle is withdrawn to nourish.

Eight represents wind. Wind corresponds to the eight major joints of the limbs—*gǔ* (股/thigh), *jīng* (肱/upper arm), and the eight nodes. The empty winds of the eight directions harm humanity, lodging internally between bones, joints, waist, spine, and the pathways of the sinews, causing deep *bì* (痹). Therefore, when treating with needles, one must make its body long and its tip sharp, allowing it to probe and extract distant and deep evils.

Nine represents the wilds. The wilds correspond to the joints, sinews, and skin of humanity. When licentious evils overflow the body, like the state of wind and water, they cannot pass beyond the major joints and nodes. Therefore, when treating with needles, one must make its point like a *tǐng* (挺/straight staff), with a slightly rounded edge, to extract the great qi that cannot pass the joints.

The Yellow Emperor said: "Are there fixed lengths for the needles?"

Qībó replied: "The first is the *jìng* needle (镜针), modeled after the *jīn* needle (巾针), with its tip shortened by half an inch, sharpened to a length of one inch and six *fēn* (分/0.1 inch), used for treating heat in the head and body. The second is the *yuán* needle (员针), modeled after the *xù* needle (絮针), with its body hollowed and its tip sharpened, one inch and six *fēn* long, used for treating qi lodged between layers. The third is the *tí* needle (缇针), modeled after the sharpness of millet and sorghum grains, three inches and five *fēn* long, used for pressing upon vessels and extracting qi, allowing evil to depart. The fourth is the *fēng* needle (锋针), modeled after the *xù* needle (絮针), with its body hollowed and its tip sharp, one inch and six *fēn* long, used for treating *tān* (痰/phlegm) and heat, drawing out blood. The fifth is the *bì* needle (铍针), modeled after a sword’s edge, two *fēn* and five *lì* (分/0.1 inch, 厘/0.01 inch) wide, four inches long, used for extracting large phlegm and pus, treating cases where cold and heat contend. The sixth is the *yuán lì* needle (圆利针), modeled after the *áo* needle (鳌针), with its tip slightly enlarged and its body narrowed, allowing it to probe internally, one inch and six *fēn* long, used for extracting *bì* (痹/numbness or stagnation). The seventh is the *háo* needle (毫针), modeled after fine hairs, one inch and six *fēn* long, used for treating cold, heat, pain, and *bì* (痹) in the collaterals. The eighth is the *cháng* needle (长针), modeled after the *cài* needle (蔡针), seven inches long, used for extracting deep and distant evils. The ninth is the *dà* needle (大针), modeled after the *fēng* needle (锋针), with its tip slightly rounded, four inches long, used for extracting great qi that cannot pass the joints. Thus, the nine needles’ shapes—large, small, long, and short—are complete.

The Yellow Emperor said: "I wish to hear how the body corresponds to the nine wilds."

Qībó replied: "Let me explain how the body corresponds to the nine wilds. The left foot corresponds to *Lìchūn* (立春/Spring Begins), on the days of *wùyín-jǐchǒu* (戊寅/戊子, 己丑/己亥); the left side (胁) corresponds to *Chūnfēn* (春分/Spring Equinox), on the days of *yǐmǎo* (乙卯); the left hand corresponds to *Lìxià* (立夏/Summer Begins), on the days of *wùchén-jǐsì* (戊辰/戊子, 己巳/己亥); the chest, throat, and head correspond to *Xiàzhì* (夏至/Summer Solstice), on the days of *bǐngwǔ* (丙午); the right hand corresponds to *Lìqiū* (立秋/Autumn Begins), on the days of *wùshēn-jǐwèi* (戊申/戊子, 己未/己亥); the right side (胁) corresponds to *Qiūfēn* (秋分/Autumn Equinox), on the days of *xīnyǒu* (辛酉); the right foot corresponds to *Lìdōng* (立冬/Winter Begins), on the days of *wùxū-jǐhài* (戊戌/戊子, 己亥/己亥); the waist, lower abdomen, and lower orifices correspond to *Dōngzhì* (冬至/Winter Solstice), on the days of *rénzǐ* (壬子). The six *fǔ* (外府/entrails) and the diaphragm below the three *zàng* (内藏/viscera) correspond to the central regions, with their great prohibitions. The great prohibitions are on the days when *Tàiyī* (太一/the Grand Unity) resides and on all *wù-jǐ* (戊己) days. These nine correspondences must be carefully observed to determine where the eight winds lodge. If there are *tān* (痰/phlegm) or *zhǒng* (肿/swelling) in the upper, lower, left, or right regions of the body, one must not treat directly on the day it manifests, for that is the *tiān jì rì* (天忌日/heavenly forbidden day).

When the form is joyful and the will is sorrowful, illness arises in the vessels, and it is treated with *jiǔ* (灸/moxibustion) and *cì* (刺/needling). When the form is sorrowful and the will is joyful, illness arises in the sinews, and it is treated with *wū* (熨/ironing) and *yǐn* (引/pulling). When the form is joyful and the will is joyful, illness arises in the flesh, and it is treated with needles and stones. When the form is sorrowful and the will is sorrowful, illness arises in the throat and voice, and it is treated with sweet medicines. When the form is frequently startled and terrified, the sinews and vessels are obstructed, illness arises in the lack of sensation, and it is treated with *ànmó* (按摩/massage) and *niàngyào* (酿药/fermented medicines). This is called the *xíng* (形/physical form).

The five *zàng* (内藏/viscera) qi: the heart governs *yì* (噫/sighing), the lungs govern *ké* (咳/coughing), the liver governs *yǔ* (语/speaking), the spleen governs *tūn* (吞/swallowing), and the kidneys govern *qiàn* (欠/yawning).
The six *fǔ* (外府/entrails) qi: the gallbladder governs *nù* (怒/anger), the stomach governs *qìniào* (气逆/reverse peristalsis) and *huì* (秽/foulness), the large and small intestines govern *xiè* (泄/diarrhea), the bladder’s failure to restrain governs *yíniào* (遗溺/incontinence), and the lower *jiāo* (焦/lower burner) overflow governs *shuǐ* (水/water-related disorders).

The Five Flavors:
Sour enters the liver, pungent enters the lungs, bitter enters the heart, sweet enters the spleen, salty enters the kidneys, bland enters the stomach. This is called the Five Flavors.

The Five Convergences:
When *jīng* (精/essence) qi converges upon the liver, there is melancholy;
when upon the heart, there is joy;
when upon the lungs, there is sorrow;
when upon the kidneys, there is fear;
when upon the spleen, there is apprehension.
This is called the convergence of the Five Essences upon the viscera.

The Five Detestations:
The liver detests wind,
the heart detests heat,
the lungs detest cold,
the kidneys detest dryness,
the spleen detests dampness.
These are the detestations of the Five Viscera.

The Five Fluids:
The heart governs sweat,
the liver governs tears,
the lungs govern nasal mucus,
the kidneys govern saliva,
the spleen governs saliva (oral fluid).
These are the origins of the Five Fluids.

The Five Exhaustions:
Prolonged vision injures blood,
prolonged exposure injures qi,
prolonged sitting injures flesh,
prolonged standing injures bones,
prolonged walking injures sinews.
These are the illnesses of the Five Prolonged Exertions.

The Five Movements:
Sour moves through the sinews,
pungent moves through the qi,
bitter moves through the blood,
salty moves through the bones,
sweet moves through the flesh.
This is called the Five Movements.

The Five Restraints:
If illness is in the sinews, avoid sour foods;
if in the qi, avoid pungent foods;
if in the bones, avoid salty foods;
if in the blood, avoid bitter foods;
if in the flesh, avoid sweet foods.
Though the mouth may crave them, do not consume them in excess—restrain yourself. This is called the Five Restraints.

The Five Manifestations:
Yin illnesses manifest in the bones,
yang illnesses manifest in the blood,
flavors manifest in the qi.
Yang illnesses manifest in winter,
yin illnesses manifest in summer.

The Five Pathologies:
When evil enters the yang, it becomes mania;
when evil enters the yin, it becomes blood stasis.
When evil enters the yang and turns, it becomes epilepsy;
when evil enters the yin and turns, it becomes sores.
When yin enters the yang, the illness is tranquil;
when yin exits to the yang, the illness is prone to anger.

The Five Viscera:
The heart houses *shén* (神/spirit),
the lungs house *pò* (魄/ethereal soul),
the liver houses *hún* (魂/ethereal soul),
the spleen houses *yì* (意/intent),
the kidneys house *jīngzhì* (精志/essence-will).

The Five Governances:
The heart governs the vessels,
the lungs govern the skin,
the liver governs the sinews,
the spleen governs the muscles,
the kidneys govern the bones.

The Six Yang-Yin:
*Yángmíng* (阳明) has abundant blood and abundant qi,
*Tàiyáng* (太阳) has abundant blood and scarce qi,
*Shàoyáng* (少阳) has abundant qi and scarce blood,
*Tàiyīn* (太阴) has abundant blood and scarce qi,
*Juéyīn* (厥阴) has abundant blood and scarce qi,
*Shàoyīn* (少阴) has abundant qi and scarce blood.
Thus it is said:
To puncture *Yángmíng* releases blood and qi,
to puncture *Tàiyáng* releases blood and evil qi,
to puncture *Shàoyáng* releases qi and evil blood,
to puncture *Tàiyīn* releases blood and evil qi,
to puncture *Juéyīn* releases blood and evil qi,
to puncture *Shàoyīn* releases qi and evil blood.

The Foot Yin-Yang Pairings:
*Yángmíng* and *Tàiyīn* are exterior-interior,
*Shàoyáng* and *Juéyīn* are exterior-interior,
*Tàiyáng* and *Shàoyīn* are exterior-interior.
This is called the yin-yang of the foot.

The Hand Yin-Yang Pairings:
*Yángmíng* and *Tàiyīn* are exterior-interior,
*Shàoyáng* and the *Xīnzhǔ* (心主/Heart Governor) are exterior-interior,
*Tàiyáng* and *Shàoyīn* are exterior-interior.
This is called the yin-yang of the hand.

**[Phonetic Note]**
*Tóng* (筒) is pronounced the same as *tóng* (同).

「Tí is pronounced *dī*.
*Jīnzhēn* (pericardium needle) is alternatively written as *Bùzhēn* (cloth needle).
*Wǔzǒu* is pronounced *gēng*.
*Wǔcái* is written as *Wǔjìn* in the *Su Wèn* (Plain Questions).

**Huangdi Neijing, Ling Shu (Spiritual Pivot) – Collected Commentaries, Volume 23**
**Discourse on Aging and Exposure (Sui Lu, 79th Treatise)**

The Yellow Emperor asked Qibo:
*"The classics say that in summer, one is injured by heat, and in autumn, one falls ill with malaria. Malaria flares at fixed times—why is this so?"*

Qibo replied:
*"When pathogenic factors lodge in the Fengfu (Wind Palace), the disease descends along the scapular region. The defensive *qi* gathers there once daily, night and day. The next day, it descends one segment, so the illness manifests later. This is because the pathogen first lodges in the back, so when the defensive *qi* reaches Fengfu, the pores open, allowing the pathogen to enter. Once the pathogen enters, the illness flares—this is why it manifests later in the day.

The defensive *qi* descends one segment daily at Fengfu. After twenty-one days, it reaches the coccyx. On the twenty-second day, it enters the spinal canal, flowing into the *Fuchong* (Hidden Surge) pulse. It takes nine days to emerge at the *Quepen* (Notched Basin). As its *qi* ascends, the illness worsens. Internally, it assails the five *zàng* (solid organs), connecting horizontally to the *mu* (front-mu) and *yuan* (back-shamen) points. Its path is long, its *qi* weak, and its movement slow—it cannot flare daily. Thus, the illness accumulates and erupts the following day."*

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"When the defensive *qi* reaches Fengfu, the pores open, allowing the pathogen to enter. But if the defensive *qi* descends one segment daily, it should no longer align with Fengfu—how does the illness persist?"*

Qibo replied:
*"Fengfu is not fixed; wherever the defensive *qi* lodges, the pores open there. The segment where the *qi* resides becomes its palace."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"Excellent."*

*"Wind and malaria share the same category, yet wind persists while malaria remits at set times—why?"*

Qibo replied:
*"Wind-*qi* lingers in its place, while malaria-*qi* follows the meridians, descending internally to assail the organs. Thus, the illness flares when the defensive *qi* arrives."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"Excellent."*

The Yellow Emperor asked Laoshi:
*"I have heard that the four seasons and eight winds affect the body, causing cold or heat. Cold tightens the skin and closes the pores, while heat relaxes the skin and opens the pores—thus, pathogenic winds and *xiéqi* (harmful *qi*) can enter. Or must the eight principal winds and vacuous pathogens alone harm the body?"*

Laoshi replied:
*"Not so. Pathogenic winds and *xiéqi* can enter without waiting for set times, but they must exploit when the pores are open. If they enter deeply, the illness is extreme and sudden. If they enter when the pores are closed, their penetration is shallow, lingering slowly, and the illness progresses gradually."*

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"Even when the body is balanced with neither cold nor heat, the pores neither open nor close—yet sudden illness can still occur. Why?"*

Laoshi replied:
*"Does Your Majesty not understand how pathogens enter? Even in repose, the pores open and close, relax and tighten, at varying times."*

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"May I hear more?"*

Laoshi said:
*"Humans align with Heaven and Earth, resonating with the sun and moon. When the moon is full, the Mei (Plum) waters in the west flourish, and human blood and *qi* accumulate. The flesh and muscles are plump, the skin firm, the hair strong, the pores closed, and filth adheres. At such times, even if pathogenic winds strike, they penetrate shallowly.

When the moon wanes, the eastern seas surge, and human *qi* and blood are depleted. The defensive *qi* recedes, leaving the form exposed. The flesh and muscles atrophy, the skin slackens, the pores open, the hair withers, the *lù* (interstitial spaces) thin, and filth falls away. At such times, if pathogenic winds strike, they penetrate deeply, and the illness erupts violently."*

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"Why do some suddenly die or fall violently ill?"*

Laoshi replied:
*"Those with three vacuities perish swiftly; those with three repletions are unharmed by pathogens."*

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"What are the three vacuities?"*

Laoshi said:
*"To ride the decline of one’s age, encounter the moon’s waning, and lose the harmony of the seasons—then be struck by pathogenic winds—this is called the three vacuities. Thus, those who fail to grasp the three vacuities are crude physicians."*

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"What are the three repletions?"*

Laoshi said:
*"To meet the peak of one’s age, encounter the moon’s fullness, and secure the harmony of the seasons—even if pathogenic winds and *xiéqi* strike, they cannot harm."*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"Your discourse is profound! Your understanding of the Way is clear!"*

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"Let this be stored in the Golden Case, naming it *The Three Repletions*.
Yet this is but the view of one man."*

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"I wish to hear why all years share common diseases—what causes this?"*

Laoshi replied:
*"This is the observation of the Eight Trigrams."*

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"How does one observe them?"*

Laoshi said:
*"Observe this: On the Winter Solstice, the Grand One (*Taiyi*) stands in the *Yūdǐ* mansion. When it arrives, the heavens must respond with wind and rain.
If the wind and rain come from the south, it is the *xū* wind—a pathogenic harm to people.
If it arrives at midnight, the common folk stay indoors and avoid it, so that year, the people suffer only minor illnesses.
If it arrives by day, the people grow slack and all are struck by the *xū* wind, so the people fall ill in great numbers.
When the *xū* evil enters and lodges in the bones without manifesting externally, by the time of *Lìchūn* (Establishing Spring), the yang *qi* surges forth, the pores open, and on that very day, if the wind comes from the west, the people are again struck by the *xū* wind. This is when the two evils clash, binding and obstructing the channel *qi*.
Thus, those who encounter both the wind and the rain are said to have met the *suìlù*—the seasonal exposure.
If the year’s harmony prevails and the pathogenic winds are few, the people suffer little illness and few deaths.
But if the year has many pathogenic winds and *xiéqi*, with cold and warmth unbalanced, then the people suffer greatly in illness and death."*

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"How does the *xū* evil wind affect nobles and commoners differently? How does one observe it?"*

Laoshi replied:
*"On the first day of the first month, if the Grand One resides in the *Tiānliú* mansion and the wind comes from the west-north, with no rain, many will die.
On the first day of the first month, if at dawn the wind comes from the north, in spring, many will die.
On the first day of the first month, if at dawn the wind blows from the north, many will fall ill—thirteen out of ten.
On the first day of the first month, if at noon the wind comes from the north, in summer, many will die.
On the first day of the first month, if at dusk the wind comes from the north, in autumn, many will die.
If the north wind blows all day, sixteen out of ten will fall gravely ill and die.
On the first day of the first month, if the wind comes from the south, it is called *zǎoxiàng*—an early omen; if from the west, it is called *báigǔ*—white bones, foretelling calamity for the state and many deaths.
On the first day of the first month, if the wind comes from the east, it lifts roofs and scatters sand and stones—great disaster for the state.
On the first day of the first month, if the wind comes from the southeast, there will be deaths in spring.
If, on the first day of the first month, the sky is warm without wind, the common folk are spared, and none fall ill; if cold with wind, the nobles suffer, and the people fall ill in great numbers.
This is called observing the year’s wind—how it harms people.

In the second month, if the *chǒu* day has no wind, many suffer heart and abdomen ailments;
In the third month, if the *xū* day is not warm, many suffer cold and fever;
In the fourth month, if the *sì* day is not hot, many suffer pestilential diseases;
In the tenth month, if the *shēn* day is not cold, many die suddenly.

All these winds—when they blow—lift roofs, snap trees, scatter sand and stones, raise hairs, and disrupt the skin’s pores."*

The Yellow Emperor asked Qībó: *"I once ascended the Qinglìng Terrace, stood on the middle step and looked back, then crawled forward and gazed ahead, and was bewildered. I privately found this strange, inwardly marveled at it, and in solitude, with my mind at ease and my qi settled, I still could not dispel it. I would then turn#3 and turn#3, my hair disheveled and my knees drawn long, bowing to gaze upon it—yet even after prolonged observation, it did not cease. Suddenly, it stopped on its own: what kind of qi caused this?*

Qībó replied: *"The vital qi of the five zàng and six fǔ all ascends to the eyes, becoming their essence. The essence of the zàng forms the eye, the essence of bone forms the pupil, the essence of sinew forms the black sclera, the essence of blood forms the conjunctival vessels, the essence of the zàng’s vital qi forms the white sclera, and the essence of muscle and tendon binds and restrains them. The inner layer, gathering the essence of sinew, bone, blood, and vital qi, connects with the vessels and ascends to the brain, emerging from the nape. Thus, when evil qi strikes the nape, it encounters the body’s void, and its penetration is deep, it follows the eye’s system into the brain. Once it enters the brain, the brain spins, and the brain’s spinning draws the eye’s system taut, causing the eyes to spin and turn.*

If the evil qi is refined, the essence it strikes does not harmonize, and the essence scatters. When the essence scatters, vision diverges, and one sees two objects. The eyes are the essence of the five zàng and six fǔ, the place where the yíng and wèi, as well as the soul and spirit, constantly circulate, and where the divine qi is generated. Thus, when the divine spirit is exhausted, the soul and spirit scatter, and the will and intent become disordered. Therefore, the pupil and black sclera follow the patterns of yin, while the white sclera and red vessels follow the patterns of yang. Hence, when yin and yang harmoniously transmit#5, clarity of vision arises.*

The eyes are governed by the heart; the heart is the dwelling of the spirit. Therefore, when the divine spirit is disordered and does not turn, one suddenly encounters an extraordinary sight, and the divine spirit, soul, and spirit scatter without finding harmony—this is called 'bewilderment' (惑). The Yellow Emperor said: *"I doubt this is the case. I have always been bewildered in the Shù Yuàn, yet it never fails to return. When I leave, it ceases again. Do I alone exhaust my spirit in the East Yuàn? Why is this so peculiar?"*

Qībó said: *"No, it is not so."*

The heart has its joys, the spirit its revulsions; when they suddenly clash#6, the vital *qi* becomes disordered, and vision falters—this is *bewilderment* (惑). Once the spirit shifts, clarity returns. Hence, mild cases are called "confusion" (迷), severe ones "bewilderment" (惑).

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Why do some people often forget things? What *qi* causes this?"*

Qībó replied: *"The upper *qi* is insufficient, while the lower *qi* is excessive. The intestines and stomach are filled, yet the heart and lungs are empty. When empty, the *campo* and *wèiyì*#7 stagnate below; if they linger too long without ascending in due time, forgetfulness follows."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Why do some people feel constant hunger yet not crave food? What *qi* causes this?"*

Qībó replied: *"The vital *qi* converges in the spleen, and the heat *qi* lingers in the stomach. When the stomach is hot, it consumes grain; thus, hunger persists. If the stomach *qi* rises counterflow, the stomach chamber grows cold, and so the appetite for food is lost."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Why do some patients lie awake when sick, unable to sleep? What *qi* causes this?"*

Qībó replied: *"The *wèiyì*#7 *qi* cannot enter yin, lingering perpetually in yang. When yang *qi* overflows, yang’s vitality flourishes; if it cannot descend into yin, yin’s vitality is depleted—thus, the eyes cannot close."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Why do some patients, when sick, lose their sight? What *qi* causes this?"*

Qībó replied: *"The *wèiyì*#7 *qi* stagnates in yin, unable to traverse yang. When yin *qi* overflows, yin’s vitality is excessive; if it cannot ascend into yang, yang’s vitality is depleted—thus, the eyes remain shut."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Why do some people sleep excessively? What *qi* causes this?"*

Qībó replied: *"In such individuals, the intestines and stomach are vast, yet the skin is tight and the flesh lacks elasticity. When the intestines and stomach are large, the *wèiyì*#7 *qi* lingers for long; when the skin is tight and the flesh unyielding, its movement is sluggish. If the *wèiyì*#7 *qi* lingers too long in yin, its vitality wanes, and drowsiness ensues—thus, they sleep much. Conversely, if the intestines and stomach are small, the skin smooth and relaxed, and the flesh elastic, the *wèiyì*#7 *qi* will linger long in yang—thus, they sleep little."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What if these conditions are not aligned with the regular channels? Why does one suddenly sleep excessively?"*

Qībó replied: *"When perverse *qi* lingers in the upper face, the pores of the upper facial region are obstructed, and they cannot pass. After eating, it is as if they had drunk hot soup—yet the *wèiyì*#7 *qi* lingers long in yin and does not move, and so they suddenly sleep excessively."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Good."* *"How should these various disorders be treated?"*

Qībó replied: *"First address their *zàngfǔ*#8, then punish minor deviations; finally, regulate their *qi*. For those with excess, reduce it; for those with deficiency, supplement it. One must first discern their suffering in form and will—whether from joy or sorrow—before acting accordingly."*

**Chapter 81: *Tān-Jū* (Paralytic Abscesses)**

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I have heard that the intestines and stomach receive grains, and the upper burner produces *qi*, warming the flesh and nourishing bones and joints, harmonizing the sinews and tendons. The middle burner produces *qi* like dew, ascending to the valleys of the body and permeating the minute vessels. The fluids and essences blend and transform, turning red to become blood. When the blood harmonizes, the minute vessels fill first, then overflow into the collateral vessels, and finally into the main channels. Once yin and yang are established, the *qi* moves with the breath, following its proper pathways, circling in accordance with the heavens and earth, never ceasing. If one cuts and adjusts it, from deficiency to excess—if one drains, it will be insufficient; if one hastens, the *qi* will be exhausted; if one lingers, it will cause sequential harm. If one drains from excess to deficiency—if one supplements, there will be surplus; when blood and *qi* are balanced, the form and *qi* will stabilize.*

*Though I know the balance and imbalance of blood and *qi*, I do not yet know the origin of *tān-jū*—how it arises as a single pulse, invading the liver and lungs, turning them black, and killing within ten days or so. The periods of life and death vary in distance—how can one measure them? May I hear your explanation?"*

Qībó replied: *"The channels’ *qi* flows without ceasing, in harmony with the heavens and aligned with the earth. When the celestial hosts lose their measure, eclipses occur in sun and moon; when the earth’s pathways falter, waters overflow, grasses wither, and the five grains fail to grow. Roads become impassable, people cannot travel, and villages scatter in isolation. Blood and *qi* function similarly. Let me explain their nature.*

*The blood and *wei* circulate endlessly, above corresponding to the stars and below to the channels. When cold perversity invades the channels and collaterals, the blood weeps—when the blood weeps, it does not flow; when it does not flow, the *wei* *qi* converges there and cannot return, causing paralysis and swelling. Cold *qi* transforms into heat; when heat prevails, it rots the flesh. When the flesh rots, it becomes pus; when pus is not drained, it damages the sinews; when the sinews are damaged, the bones are harmed; when the bones are harmed, the marrow decays. If the marrow decays and the bone cavity is not drained, the blood dries and empties, causing the sinews, bones, flesh, and muscles to fail to nourish one another. The channels collapse and leak, blackening the five *zàng*, and the *zàng* are injured—thus death occurs."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"I wish to hear fully the forms of *tān-jū* and the forbidden days for treatment."*

Qībó replied: *"When *tān-jū* arises in the throat, it is called *měng-jū*. If untreated, it turns to pus; if the pus is not drained, it blocks the throat, and death occurs within half a day. If it turns to pus and is drained, apply *zhūgāo* (pig fat) and *língshí* (a medicinal herb), and it will heal in three days.*

*When it arises in the neck, it is called *yāo-jū*. If the swelling is large and black-red, and not treated urgently, the heat *qi* descends into the armpit, injuring the *rèn* vessel and causing the *yáng* *qi* to erupt violently, consuming the brain and lingering in the nape—this is called *nǎo-shuò* (brain rot). If the color is dull, the neck aches as if pierced with a needle, and there is mental agitation, death is inevitable and cannot be treated.*

*When it arises in the shoulder or armpit, it is called *cī-tān*. Its appearance is black-red; if treated urgently, it causes sweating to the soles of the feet without harming the five *zàng*.*

*If *tān-jū* appears for four or five days, it should be treated with cupping.*

*When it arises beneath the armpit as a firm red swelling, it is called *mǐ-jū*. Treat it with a *biànshí* (a surgical tool), making the incision fine and long, then scrape it and apply *zhūgāo*. It will heal in six days; do not bandage it tightly. If it remains firm and does not rupture, use a *mǎdāo* (scalpel) to lance it urgently.*

*When it arises in the chest, it is called *jǐng-jū*, resembling a large soybean. If it is not treated early, it descends into the abdomen, and if untreated, death occurs in seven days.*

*When it arises in the breast, it is called *gān-jū*, with a greenish hue like *lígēng* (a type of reed). The patient constantly suffers from cold and heat; if treated urgently to remove the cold and heat, it can be cured. If not treated urgently, death occurs at ten years of age, and pus emerges posthumously.*

*When it arises in the ribs, it is called *bài-cī*. This is a disease of women. If cauterized, it becomes a large pus-filled abscess. When treated, living flesh the size of a small red bean may be found within. Take *dàsuōqiāocǎo* and *sāqiāocǎo* (two types of herbs), each one *shēng*, and boil in sixteen *shēng* of water, reducing it to three *shēng*. The patient should drink it warmly, wear thick clothing, and sit over the pot until sweating reaches the soles of the feet.*

*When it arises along the *jīng* channel of the thigh, it is called *gǔjīng-jū*. Though its appearance does not change drastically, the abscess presses against the bone. If not treated urgently, death occurs in thirty days.*

*When it arises in the buttocks, it is called *ruì-jū*, appearing as a large, firm red swelling. If treated urgently, it can be cured. If untreated, death occurs in thirty days.*

*When it arises in the inner thigh, it is called *chìshī*. If not treated urgently, death occurs in sixty days. If it appears between the thighs, death occurs in ten days if untreated.*

*When it arises at the knee, it is called *cī-tān*. The swelling is large, the color unchanged, and the patient suffers cold and heat like a hard stone. Do not apply *shí* (a surgical tool) to it—if you do, death will follow. Wait until it softens before applying *shí*; then the patient may survive.*

*If *tān-jū* arises at the joints and corresponds symmetrically, it cannot be treated.*

*If it arises in the *yáng* regions, death occurs in a hundred days; if in the *yīn* regions, in thirty days.*

*When it arises along the channels, it is called *tùpēn*, appearing red down to the bone. If treated urgently, it will not harm the patient.*

*When it arises at the inner ankle, it is called *zǒuhuǎn*, appearing as a swelling with unchanged color. If one repeatedly applies *shí* to its convergence points and stops the cold and heat, the patient will not die.*

*When it arises above or below the foot, it is called *sìyín*, appearing as a large swelling. If not treated urgently, death occurs in a hundred days.*

*When it arises beside the foot, it is called *lì-tān*, initially resembling a small finger swelling. If treated urgently and the blackened area is removed, it will not worsen. If untreated, death occurs in a hundred days.*

*When it arises on the toes, it is called *tuō-tān*. If it appears black-red, death is inevitable if untreated. If it does not appear black-red, the patient will not die."*

The *Huangdi* said, *"Master, how do you distinguish between *zhǒuhuǎn* and *jū*?"*

The *Qíbó* replied, *"When the circulating *qi* and defensive *qi* stagnate within the channels and vessels, the blood weeps and does not flow. If it does not flow, the defensive *qi* follows and becomes obstructed, unable to move, thus generating heat. When the great heat does not cease, the heat overcomes and the flesh rots. When the flesh rots, it becomes pus—but it does not sink inward, nor does the bone marrow become scorched and withered, nor are the five *zàng*-organs injured. Thus, it is called *zhǒuhuǎn*."*

The *Huangdi* asked, *"What is meant by *jū*?"*

The *Qíbó* replied, *"When the hot *qi* is excessive and sinks into the muscles and skin, the tendons and marrow wither, and it internally connects with the five *zàng*-organs, exhausting the blood and *qi*. At the site of the swelling, all tendons, bones, and flesh are consumed, leaving nothing behind. Thus, it is called *jū*. The *jū* has its skin above turned rigid and firm, like the hide of an ox’s neck. The *zhǒuhuǎn* has its skin above thin and glossy. These are their distinguishing signs."*

「The **Huángdì** asked in the *Língshū* (Spiritual Pivot), Volume 23, *"What is meant by **xuān** (瘫)?"*—originally written as *"日"* (day), corrected according to the **Zhào Fǔ Jūjìngtáng** edition.

The **Qíbó** replied: *"When **xuān** (萱) is urgent and hunger is severe, the blood is **qì** (泣) with a **shè** (涩) sound. **Yé** (爷) and **huái** (菰) were anciently pronounced as **kuà** (括), **lóu** (楼). **Jié** (燸) is pronounced **nuò** (奴到切), or also **rú** (濡). **Bùzhě** (不则) is pronounced **shàngfǔ** (上府九切). **Yāo** (夭) is pronounced **mó** (么), meaning the skin’s color is indistinct.

The *Huángdì* asked further: *"What is meant by **jū** (疽)?"*

The **Qíbó** replied: *"When the hot **qi** (气) is excessive, it sinks into the muscles and skin, causing the tendons and marrow to wither. It internally connects with the five **zàng**-organs, exhausting the blood and **qi**. At the site of the swelling, all tendons, bones, and flesh are consumed, leaving none—thus it is called **jū** (疽). The **jū** (疽) has its upper skin rigid and firm, resembling the hide of an ox’s neck. The **xuān** (瘫) has its upper skin thin and glossy. These are their distinguishing signs.
