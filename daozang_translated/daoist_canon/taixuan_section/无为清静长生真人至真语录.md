**Preface to *The Perfected Sayings of the Perfected One of Non-Action, Purity, and Longevity***

I have heard that the Dao abides within the world, and what is fitting may be gradually attained; the immortals dwell beyond form, and their realm cannot be sought carelessly. Thus, the poet Bai Letian wrote:
*"Were it not for the golden bones of destiny,
One’s name would not be inscribed on the cinnabar terrace."*
Without the roots of a hundred thousand kalpas of goodness, how could one obtain the primal qi of the Three, Five, and One, and reach such a state?

Now, Master Liu, the Longevity Master, possesses this destiny and bears this name. Formerly, he encountered the Perfected Wang Chongyang, who delivered and transformed him, guiding him from the secular to the Dao. His wisdom and nature became luminous, his understanding thorough and penetrating. Recently summoned by imperial decree, he composed a poem:
*"In years past, the former emperor’s decree came from Shaanxi;
Today, the sagely emperor’s summons arrives from Donglai."*
After two years, he requested to return home. The officials sought his verses, to which he replied:
*"Drifting like clouds and water, I turn back to Donglai,
A star-crowned immortal among companions in the Great Tenuity."*
This resembles Chen Tuan of old, who, favored by the Song court, retired to Mount Hua. The imperial response read:
*"The Jade Hall and Golden Gates rejoice briefly in your audience;
The cloud-draped cliffs and misty carriage hasten your return to reclusion."*
These two great adepts, unbound by convention, each brought glory to their dynasties—yet their pursuit of the Dao was the same, differing only in circumstance.

Since Master Liu returned to his homeland and dwelled in the Great Tenuity, he has annotated the scriptures, tracing the teachings of the Three Sages. With literary grace and calligraphic playfulness, he composed works to propagate the Dharma, heeding the Buddhist admonition against attachment to the trivial. He entered the Gate of Myriad Wonders of the Mysterious Sovereign, embodied the Five Constants of Confucius, cultivated fields and estates, and published his writings on pearwood and jujube. Ever composed, he ensured all his works were carved and disseminated, renewing the perceptions of the common folk, recited by all, and refining the customs of the people. Those with understanding turned to him in devotion; the stubborn and coarse were transformed into the refined.

One day, the Master’s disciples, Xu and Li, traveled from afar to visit. Crossing the creek lodge and entering the humble studio, they rested from their journey, partaking of vegetarian and aquatic delicacies. After some time, they presented a volume of the Master’s *Perfected Sayings*, earnestly requesting a preface. Unable to refuse in good conscience, I cleansed my mind and perused it thoroughly. The text awakens and warns, inspiring one to sever worldly ties and transcend karmic obstructions.

From beginning to end, it comprises eighty questions, answered in ten thousand words of jade-like discourse. It encompasses principles and narratives, citations and critiques, tracing the transformations of Heaven and Earth, the functions of yin and yang, elucidating the doctrines of life and death, clarifying the retributions of fortune and misfortune, expounding the forms of true emptiness, and restraining the desires of greed and anger. It addresses the origins of suffering and joy, the manifestations of sincerity and deceit, the sources of purity and turbidity, and the foundations of the exalted and the base—such topics are myriad, yet none are left unexplored. All are adjudicated by the profound principles of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, encompassing the affairs of the world.

It enables sentient beings to resolve doubts and return to correctness, melting away delusions like ice. It serves as a dike to dispel great ignorance, opening the door to spiritual illumination, and in one stroke, liberates all. Thus, one may transcend the sea of suffering, ascend the shore of awakening, cast off the filth of the Three Realms and Five Turbidities, realize the cause of samādhi and singular emptiness, shed the defilements of the twelve kinds of beings, and receive the joy of rebirth across the three thousand worlds. Truly, these are the words of the Perfected, guiding and transforming through the Dharma’s karmic connections—how magnificent!

On the Shangyuan Festival of the *renxu* year of the Taihe era, respectfully inscribed by Han Shiqian, the Empty Stream Daoist of Bianxi in Huoze, Duanzhou.

**The Perfected Sayings of the Perfected One of Non-Action, Purity, and Longevity**

**Scripture Title:** *The Perfected Sayings of the Perfected One of Non-Action, Purity, and Longevity*
Recorded by Liu Chuxuan of the Jin, compiled by his disciples. One scroll.

**The Perfected Sayings of the Perfected One of Non-Action, Purity, and Longevity**
Eighty Questions

**First Question: On the Dharma**

**First Question: On the Dharma**
One asked: "What is the Dharma?"
The Master of Longevity answered: "To penetrate the Dao and attain true emptiness—this is called the Dharma. To penetrate the teachings of Śākya and attain non-arising—this is called the precepts. Those who receive the Dharma cannot exhaust their myriad transgressions, nor can they penetrate the myriad principles. Those who receive the precepts cannot fulfill their myriad virtues, nor can they penetrate the myriad wisdoms. When the Dao and Dharma are penetrated, one attains the natural, pure, and unadulterated state of non-action. When the teachings of Śākya and precepts are penetrated, one encompasses the self, others, sentient beings, and the long-lived. As the scripture says: 'The Dharma of the Dao is natural.' The Dharma of the Dao is not empty, yet it is empty."

**Second Question: On Emptiness**
One asked again: "What is emptiness?"
The answer: "The Dao abides—not in emptiness. The foolish cling to rigid emptiness; the worthy cling to true emptiness. The worldly contemplate the emptiness of form; the Daoist forgets the emptiness of the world. People cherish the emptiness of all things, yet the transgressions they contemplate are not empty. The enlightened understand the emptiness of the Dao; the penetrating comprehend the emptiness of nature. The turbid, in death, sink into emptiness; the pure, in life, ascend into emptiness. As the scripture says: 'Emerging into life, entering into death—those who live are thirteen, those who die are thirteen.' To awaken to emptiness is to know."

**Third Question: On Knowledge**
One asked again: "What is knowledge?"
The answer: "Knowledge is this: to know human kindness and favor, expecting repayment in the heart; to know the Dao of Heaven, then to diminish excess and aid the destitute; to know the Dao of humanity, then to diminish insufficiency and serve the wealthy. To know the existence of the Dao is to follow Heaven; to know the absence of the Dao is to follow humanity. Following Heaven, one lives; following humanity, one dies. Following Heaven preserves one’s purity and goodness; following humanity indulges one’s turbidity and evil. As the scripture says: 'Observe the Dao of Heaven, grasp the conduct of Heaven—this is perfection.' To know the radiance of wisdom is to see beyond what ordinary people perceive."

**Fourth Question: On Perception**
One asked again: "What is perception?"
The answer: "Perception is not what the fleshly eye sees. Perception is this: to perceive the primordial void, to perceive the radiance of wisdom, to perceive the boundless countenance, to perceive the indistinct and subtle, to perceive the precious pearl, to perceive the rosy clouds, to perceive the profound and subtle, to perceive the serene and luminous, to perceive the purity of the hun-soul, to perceive the stillness of the po-soul. As the scripture says: 'The Dao as a thing is only indistinct and subtle.' To perceive the form of no-thing is to respond externally with constant goodness."

**Fifth Question: On Goodness**
One asked again: "What is goodness?"
The answer: "Goodness is to respond to things with square or round, crooked or straight, and comply with others. To not generate myriad evils—this is called true goodness. To not cling to the myriad things—this is called pure goodness. To penetrate principles without reciting the myriad scriptures—this is called penetrating goodness. To penetrate the wondrous without exhausting the myriad transformations—this is called luminous goodness. To not harm the myriad forms—this is called compassionate goodness. To not reject the myriad turbidities—this is called responsive goodness. To not oppose the myriad people—this is called virtuous goodness. To not seek the myriad existences—this is called Daoist goodness. To not arise in myriad selfishnesses—this is called impartial goodness. To not forget the myriad wisdoms—this is called constant goodness. As the scripture says: 'Good, I treat as good; not good, I also treat as good—this is virtuous goodness.' The highest goodness is not evil."

**Sixth Question: On Evil**
One asked again: "What is evil?"
The answer: "Evil is the unworthiness of humanity. If people do not follow Heaven, then Heaven does not follow them. If people squander and scatter, then Heaven sends famine and scarcity. If people do not cultivate good fortune, then Heaven does not grant abundance. If the human heart indulges in malice and poison, then Heaven’s will descends with wind and hail. If one does not cease evil killing until death, then in the next life, one is surely born among the asuras. If people create evil, then Heaven repays with evil. If people do not harm things with evil, then things do not injure people with evil. As the scripture says: 'Poisonous insects do not sting, fierce beasts do not seize, birds of prey do not strike.' To not reject evil is true penetration—this clarifies one’s worthiness."

**Seventh Question: On Worthiness**
One asked again: "What is worthiness?"
The answer: "The worthy are those of great penetration. The greatly wise seem as if they lack penetration; the greatly wise seem as if they lack knowledge; the greatly perceptive seem as if they lack clarity; the greatly eloquent seem as if they lack speech. Responding with wisdom, they truly possess the myriad penetrations; responding with wisdom, they truly possess the myriad understandings; responding with perception, they truly possess the myriad clarities; responding with eloquence, they truly possess the myriad discourses. Wisdom that penetrates is worldly penetration; wisdom that penetrates is Daoist penetration; perception that penetrates is the clarity of principles; eloquence that penetrates is the purity of speech. As the scripture says: 'Do not esteem the worthy, lest the people contend.' The worthy of the world conceal themselves like jade hidden in stone; the worthy of the Dao conceal themselves as the reality of no-thing. The worthy are not the foolish."

**Eighth Question: On Foolishness**
One asked again: "What is foolishness?"
The answer: "The foolish are the ancient ones of great penetration who distanced themselves from the world’s illusions, their outward appearance like that of fools. The Confucian Yan Hui lived in poverty with a single bamboo bowl and gourd ladle; the Śākya Śākyamuni begged for food, receiving a meal from seven households; the Daoist Pure Yang practiced non-action, dwelling in a humble abode and eating coarse fare. Returning to simplicity, the high descend to the low, the existent to the non-existent. The bright seem dim; the anciently silent seem inarticulate. As the scripture says: 'I alone seem forgotten—is this the heart of a foolish person?' Outwardly foolish, inwardly they embrace the Dao—this is true life."

**Ninth Question: On Life**
One asked again: "What is life?"

The answer: "Life is embracing the Dao to achieve true life, preserving destiny to attain blessed life, nurturing qi to attain spiritual life, penetrating the subtle to attain wondrous life, being without delusion to attain wise life, responding to things to attain virtuous life, constantly practicing goodness to attain salvific life. At the summer solstice, the yang energy ascends; at the winter solstice, the yang energy revives; through interaction, the myriad things come to life.

True life is at ease; blessed life is luminous; spiritual life is numinous; wondrous life is pure; wise life is penetrating; virtuous life is level; salvific life is compassionate. Yin life ascends; yang life descends; the life of things achieves completion. As the scripture says: 'The Dao gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two, the Two give birth to the Three, and the Three give birth to the myriad things.' Heaven and Earth give life to the myriad things through harmonious qi, thus they live; through metallic qi, they perish—thus they die.

**Tenth Question: On Death**
One asked again: "What is death?"
The answer: "Death is the form of things. When the myriad things reach deep autumn, their forms die, but their roots do not. When the myriad forms reach a hundred years, their bodies die, but their natures do not. For the insentient myriad things, one may deepen their roots. For the sentient myriad forms, one may nurture their natures. If the root lacks water, the sprout dies. If the nature lacks destiny, the body dies. The root is the nature; the nature is the root. The spirit is the nature; the nature is the spirit. When the numbers of the Five Phases are exhausted, the form declines and dies. Beyond yin and yang, the spirit does not perish. As the scripture says: 'Deep roots and a firm stem are the Way of long life and enduring vision.' Death without true death is the precious constancy.

**Eleventh Question: On Nobility**
One asked again: "What is nobility?"
The answer: "Nobility is the nobility of virtue. Heaven bestows grace without letting those below know—this is the nobility of virtue. Heaven bestows grace without choosing whom to love—this is the nobility of virtue. Heaven bestows grace in creation without being the master—this is the nobility of virtue. Heaven bestows grace to aid others without expecting repayment—this is the nobility of virtue. One must align with Heaven’s intent: bestowing relief, only the self knows. One must align with Heaven’s intent: bestowing kindness, whether public or private. One must align with Heaven’s intent: bestowing wealth as if discarding mud. One must align with Heaven’s intent: bestowing food without remembering who. As the scripture says: 'The myriad things all revere the Dao and prize virtue.' The virtue of the noble overflows in kindness to the lowly.

**Twelfth Question: On Lowliness**
One asked again: "What is lowliness?"
The answer: "Lowliness is the thinness of the external. Truly prizing virtue makes the body externally lowly. If virtue is like fine jade, the body seems like crude stone. If virtue ascends to communicate with Heaven, the body humbly descends to the sea. If one’s words are thus humble, one’s body dwells above. If one internally debases the true, one externally prizes the false. Prizing virtue makes one esteemed in the world; debasing the body ensures tranquil existence. Seeing treasure, one becomes a great vessel; when the uncarved block scatters, the true form appears. Communing with Heaven reveals profound subtlety; communing with the sea gathers all goodness. Humble words earn respect and praise; an elevated body increases self and others. Debasing the true scatters the hun and po; prizing the false obscures the true. As the scripture says: 'Thus nobility must take lowliness as its root, and height must take lowness as its foundation.' By abiding in lowliness, one attains loftiness.

**Thirteenth Question: On Height**
One asked again: "What is height?"
The answer: "The Way of Heaven represses height. The way of humans elevates height. The greatly enlightened conceal their height. The honored and glorious parade their height. The Way of Heaven represses height to bestow grace upon the needy. The way of humans elevates height to harm the needy. The greatly enlightened conceal their height to transform the worthy. The honored and glorious parade their height to delude the foolish. As the scripture says: 'The high are repressed; the low are elevated.' What Heaven deems high covers what is below.

**Fourteenth Question: On Lowness**
One asked again: "What is lowness?"
The answer: "Lowness is the sea’s descent, where clarity and compliance gather; the heart’s descent, where purity and goodness gather. Clarity and compliance make depth and breadth; goodness and compliance make virtue broad. It is like erecting a house: when the ridgepoles and beams descend, the rafters and purlins gather to them. It is like receiving guests: when the host descends, the visitors gather. When rafters and purlins gather, success is achieved. When visitors gather, virtue is accomplished. As the scripture says: 'The rivers and seas can be kings of all valleys because they excel in lowness.' Abiding in lowness with clarity and compliance brings ultimate joy.

**Fifteenth Question: On Joy**
One asked again: "What is joy?"
The answer: "Joy is finding joy in the Dao by dwelling in pure lowness, or delighting in customs by clinging to song and wine. Joy in pure lowness arises from having no happiness or sorrow. Joy in song and wine brings both mirth and melancholy. Joy in the Dao of non-action entails no cultivation or attainment. Joy in the appearances of action entails cultivation and downfall. Joy in the true nature has no form or end. Joy in the false body has birth and death. As the scripture says: 'Thus the world delights in pushing forward without tiring.' Joy in the Dao brings no contention. Losing the joy of the Dao brings sorrow born of suffering.

**Sixteenth Question: On Suffering**
One asked again: "What is suffering?"
The answer: "Suffering is the affliction of body and mind. The deluded of the world suffer in their greed for life, thus entering the path of death. Those who suffer in scheming with the mind sink their natures into the realm of sin. The awakened to the Dao suffer in refining their forms, like crushing stone to retrieve jade. Those who suffer in forgetting schemes elevate their natures to the nine heavens."

The virtuous find joy within suffering, while the foolish find suffering within joy. The virtuous endure suffering until sweetness arrives, whereas the foolish reach the extremity of joy only to meet sorrow. As the scripture says: "Favor arises from harm, and harm arises from favor." When one delights in the Dao and suffering is exhausted, one attains its purity.

**Seventeenth Question: On Purity**
One asked again: "What is purity?"
The answer: "Purity is when heaven is clear, revealing all phenomena; when the mind is clear, revealing its boundless spirit; when the abyss is clear, illuminating its dual essence. Penetrating celestial phenomena brings descending qi and harmonious balance. Penetrating boundless spirit unites one with the Dao in body. Penetrating the clarity of the abyss brings a spirit-spring without leakage. Attaining harmonious balance, qi and spirit intertwine. Attaining unity in body, the true form becomes imperishable. Attaining no leakage, the bright moon shines in fullness. As the scripture says: 'Profound, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things.' Exploring and penetrating purity leaves no room for turbidity."

**Eighteenth Question: On Turbidity**
One asked again: "What is turbidity?"
The answer: "Turbidity is when the deluded of the world indulge their intentions, becoming morally turbid; indulge their bodies, becoming licentiously turbid; indulge in evil, clouding their nature; indulge in licentiousness, forfeiting their lives. The awakened to the Dao remain celestial in clarity yet blend with earthly turbidity, bodily pure yet blend with worldly turbidity. Clarity blending with turbidity transforms yin into yang; clarity blending with the world appears outwardly foolish. As the scripture says: 'Who can make the turbid clear by settling it gently?' When turbidity is exhausted, radiance manifests."

**Nineteenth Question: On Manifestation**
One asked again: "What is manifestation?"
The answer: "Manifestation is when celestial phenomena do not display their brightness themselves—all eyes under heaven see their brightness. The principles of the Dao do not self-proclaim their clarity—all virtues under heaven recognize their attainment. When all eyes see its brightness, reverence arises. When all virtues recognize its attainment, trust is born. The world’s reverence for heaven and earth generates fortune. The Dao’s trust in non-action generates truth. As the scripture says: 'Not displaying oneself, thus one is bright; not asserting oneself, thus one is distinguished.' Inner radiance manifests while the outer self remains concealed."

**Twentieth Question: On Concealment**
One asked again: "What is concealment?"
The answer: "Concealment is inwardly practicing compassion to save lives while outwardly fearing others’ awareness; inwardly possessing true clarity yet outwardly appearing as a fool; inwardly free from entanglements yet outwardly seeming to blend with the dust; inwardly radiant in responding to things yet outwardly refraining from action; inwardly expanding virtue yet outwardly distant from others’ admiration; inwardly embracing the Dao yet outwardly free from delusion. Supreme clarity dissolves thoughts, and the body dwells in the mortal world. As the scripture says: 'The Dao is concealed and nameless—this is called its greatness.'"

**Twenty-First Question: On Greatness**
One asked again: "What is greatness?"
The answer: "Greatness is the Dao. It cannot be encompassed by yin and yang—this is called the greatness of the Dao. Greatness is nature. It embraces all deviations with correctness—this is called the greatness of nature. The greatness of the Dao is the mother of the myriad things. The greatness of nature is the teacher of all deviations. Penetrating its mother, the myriad things receive their creation. Penetrating its teacher, all deviations return to correctness. Through creation, each attains its form. Through correctness, each penetrates the Dao. As the scripture says: 'The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.' Greatness accommodates the small."

**Twenty-Second Question: On Smallness**
One asked again: "What is smallness?"
The answer: "Smallness is penetrating the subtle. When the Dao penetrates the small, it does not discriminate in its love or favor. When nature penetrates the small, it does not discriminate in its love or teaching. Without discriminating in love or favor, even the smallest beings receive the Dao’s qi. Without discriminating in love or teaching, even the smallest beings receive heaven’s light. Insentient small beings, receiving the Dao’s qi, gain form. Sentient small beings, receiving heaven’s light, gain nature. As the scripture says: 'Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish.' It does not favor the beloved nor abandon the weak. The subtlety of the small is not empty."

**Twenty-Third Question: On Emptiness**
One asked again: "What is emptiness?"
The answer: "Emptiness is the essence of the Dao. When yin and yang clarify its emptiness, the myriad things are born. When supreme nature clarifies its emptiness, the indistinct arises. The birth of the myriad things benefits the world. The arising of the indistinct transcends the world. Things benefiting people bring worldly joy. The Dao penetrating truth brings joy to nature. Worldly joy follows the numerology of yin and yang. Joy in nature reaches the extremity of emptiness without end. As the scripture says: 'Attain the extremity of emptiness, guard the sincerity of stillness—all things arise together.' Emptiness is the reality of the Dao."

**Twenty-Fourth Question: On Reality**
One asked again: "What is reality?"
The answer: "Reality is the Dao. The Dao’s birth precedes heaven and earth, enduring to this day without perishing—this is called reality. Reality is nature. Nature’s birth lies beyond the myriad things, enduring to this day without perishing—this is called reality. When the Dao clarifies its reality, it grasps yin and yang, giving birth to the myriad things. When nature clarifies its reality, it masterfully penetrates the pivot of transformation. The birth of the myriad things reveals the reality of the Dao. The transformation of the myriad things reveals the reality of nature. The Dao is empty yet its qi is real; nature is empty yet its life is real. As the scripture says: 'Empty the heart, fill the belly.' Clarifying its reality, the Dao and nature attain true tranquility."

**Twenty-Fifth Question: On Tranquility**
One asked again: "What is tranquility?"
The answer: "Tranquility is the Dao."

The Supreme Dao in tranquility tranquilly moves yin and yang, giving birth to the myriad things. The Supreme Nature in tranquility tranquilly refines lead and mercury, tempering its form. When yin and yang transform, they preserve the myriad things. When lead and mercury congeal, they preserve its nature. Preserving the myriad things is humanity’s abundance. Preserving its nature is the spirit’s numinosity. Human abundance desires its splendor; the spirit’s numinosity embraces the Dao. Desiring splendor brings flourishing and withering; embracing the Dao brings formlessness and endlessness. As the scripture says: *"Seen, it is not enough to be seen; heard, it is not enough to be heard."* When nature delights in true tranquility, it responds to busyness.

**Twenty-Sixth Question: On Busyness**
One asked again: "What is busyness?"
The answer: "Busyness is the Dao’s tranquility—its two qi are ever busy. Busyness is nature’s tranquility—its four illusions are ever busy. The two qi are busy, dividing the four seasons into above and below. The four illusions are busy, as day and night greedily contend in coming and going. The two qi are busy: spring transforms into warmth, summer into heat, autumn into coolness, winter into cold. The four illusions are busy: greed for wealth, attachment to beauty, infatuation with wine, competition in qi. The two qi are busy, creating and transforming the myriad things—this is yin and yang following heaven and earth’s virtue. The four illusions are busy, creating the myriad affairs—this is sentient beings violating heaven and earth’s virtue. As the scripture says: *'Sounds harmonize with one another; front and back follow in succession.'* Those who awaken amid busyness attain true non-departure."

**Twenty-Seventh Question: On Departure**
One asked again: "What is departure?"
The answer: "Departure is the Dao’s eternal abiding without end—the Dao’s image departs nowhere. Departure is the myriad things taking form and reaching their limit—qi departs somewhere. The Dao unites yin and yang. Qi unites the myriad things. When numbers are exhausted, yin and yang scatter and depart. When form ends, the myriad things decay and depart. Yin and yang scatter, yet the Dao remains. The myriad things decay, yet nature endures. As the scripture says: *'From ancient times to the present, its name does not depart.'* When things perish, qi departs; when yang harmonizes, qi comes."

**Twenty-Eighth Question: On Coming**
One asked again: "What is coming?"
The answer: "Coming is movement without form. Heaven and earth await their time to intermingle—then the two qi come. The myriad forms await their time to receive qi—then yin and yang come. The Dao is heaven and earth’s position; form is yin and yang’s position. Heaven and earth abide in the Dao—this is enduring position. Yin and yang abide in the myriad things—this is provisional position. Enduring position brings the four seasons’ transformation and communication. Provisional position brings the three powers’ gathering. Transformation and communication create and transform. Gathering creates true form. Withering is the death of things; softness is the birth of form. As the scripture says: *'In human life, one is supple and weak; in death, one is stiff and strong.'* Softness comes, uniting heaven’s clarity and peace."

**Twenty-Ninth Question: On Peace**
One asked again: "What is peace?"
The answer: "Peace is the Dao. The Dao nurtures the myriad things without choosing favorites or bestowing grace—it distributes qi in peace. Peace is reality. Reality unites the myriad transformations without choosing favorites or bestowing marvels—it distributes virtue in peace. When qi is peaceful, things grow in harmony. When virtue is peaceful, people attain goodness in harmony. Things growing in harmony all preserve their creation and transformation. People attaining goodness in harmony all preserve their Dao and virtue. As the scripture says: *'Heaven and earth unite, descending sweet dew—no one commands it, yet it naturally spreads in marvelous equality.'* This clarifies its constancy."

**Thirtieth Question: On Constancy**
One asked again: "What is constancy?"
The answer: "Constancy is the Dao. Constantly following the Dao saves human numinosity. Constantly following qi saves the forms of things. People constantly following the Dao are like fish in water. Things constantly following qi are like lamps receiving oil. Fish separated from water die. Lamps without oil go out. Constantly following the Dao brings human life. Constantly following qi brings the life of things. People are spirit; things are form. When form and spirit unite in marvel, they merge with the Dao’s reality. As the scripture says: *'Constantly excelling in saving people, thus there are no abandoned people.'* Delighting in the Dao’s constancy is true joy."

**Thirty-First Question: On Joy**
One asked again: "What is joy?"
The answer: "Joy is the Dao’s delight. Clarity without turbidity is the Dao’s delight. Joy without sorrow is the Dao’s delight. Joy is virtue’s delight. Encouraging evil to follow goodness is virtue’s delight. Seeing kindness and repaying its grace is virtue’s delight. Joy is lost delight. Turning from goodness to delight in evil is lost delight. Forgetting grace and repaying kindness is lost delight. Delighting in the Dao perfects its merit. Delighting in virtue perfects its conduct. Delighting in loss brings regression and decline. As the scripture says: *'Those of the Dao unite with the Dao; those of virtue unite with virtue; those of loss unite with loss.'* Joyful delight forgets sorrow."

**Thirty-Second Question: On Sorrow**
One asked again: "What is sorrow?"
The answer: "Those with sorrow do not comprehend the Dao’s true principle. Many affairs bring much sorrow. Those without sorrow truly unite with the Dao’s true wisdom. No affairs bring no sorrow. Many affairs with sorrow cloud the spirit and muddy qi. No affairs without sorrow clarify the spirit and refresh qi. Muddy qi brings thoughts of debauchery and evil, losing one’s hun and po. Clear qi brings no anxieties, only purity and goodness, gathering lead and mercury."

The hun and po scatter and one’s nature sinks downward. Lead and mercury congeal and one’s nature ascends upward. As the scripture says: *"Abandon learning and there is no sorrow."* Without sorrow, contemplating the Dao yields true and substantial attainment.

**Thirty-Third Question: On Attainment**
One asked again: "What is attainment?"
The answer: "True attainment gains the nameless purity of celestial favor; false attainment gains the named impurity of worldly disgrace. Those who attain celestial favor harbor no greed or contention. Those who attain worldly disgrace indulge in greed and contention. Without greed or contention, one truly penetrates the virtuous Dao. With greed and contention, one falsely strays into vulgar evil. Preserving the myriad practices in truth brings celestial favor. Fabricating the myriad affairs in falsity brings worldly disgrace. Awakening brings no birth; delusion brings downfall. As the scripture says: *'Favor and disgrace are like startling things.'* Clinging to false names and forms loses the true Dao."

**Thirty-Fourth Question: On Loss**
One asked again: "What is loss?"
The answer: "Loss is the loss of the non-action Dao. Loss is attachment to the action-bound Dao. Loss is the loss of the non-action virtue; loss is attachment to the action-bound virtue. Penetrating the non-action Dao brings true inexhaustibility. Clinging to the action-bound Dao brings false finitude. Penetrating the non-action virtue brings constant equilibrium of nature. Clinging to the action-bound virtue brings partiality and resentment in the heart. The non-action Dao is inexhaustible, truly indestructible. The action-bound Dao is finite, falsely subject to decay. The non-action virtue is truly equanimous, connecting to Heaven. The action-bound virtue is falsely partial, and thus one falls. As the scripture says: *'Thus, lose the Dao and then virtue; lose virtue and then benevolence.'* Penetrating non-action brings no loss, only the clarity of celestial blessing."

**Thirty-Fifth Question: On Blessing**
One asked again: "What is blessing?"
The answer: "Blessing—true blessing is the Dao, the mandate of humanity. Worldly blessing is dust, the treasure of things. The blessing of the non-action Dao is like the full moon, ever waxing. The worldly blessing of action is like the waning moon, gradually diminishing. The full moon waxes and is the mandate of humanity; the waning moon diminishes and is the treasure of the world. The mandate is the inexhaustible blessing of the Dao; the treasure is the finite emptiness of the world. Awakening to the Dao generates blessing. Delusion in the world sinks one into karmic bondage. As the scripture says: *'Blessing, oh!—wherein misfortune lies concealed. Who knows its limits?'* Penetrating the Dao’s blessing brings no misfortune."

**Thirty-Sixth Question: On Misfortune**
One asked again: "What is misfortune?"
The answer: "Misfortune is human desire, premeditated transgression. If one’s karma bears a single part, Heaven inflicts tenfold misfortune. If one’s goodness bears a single part, Heaven bestows tenfold blessing. As the scripture says: *'Cut off profit at its source, and tenfold strength is employed.'* If one does not generate myriad evils, one surpasses the cultivation of myriad virtues. If one does not cling to myriad things, one surpasses the bestowal of myriad kindnesses. As the scripture says: *'Three returns by day and night employ ten-thousandfold strength.'* Penetrating non-action brings the ten-thousandfold clarity of celestial blessing. Delusion in action conceals false blessing within misfortune. As the scripture says: *'Misfortune, oh!—wherein blessing leans.'* The true does not dwell externally."

**Thirty-Seventh Question: On Abandonment**
One asked again: "What is abandonment?"
The answer: "Abandonment—abandoning wealth in the world seeks blessing. Abandonment in the Dao does not abandon the existent to grasp the nonexistent. Abandoning wealth to seek blessing fails to penetrate true blessing. Abandoning the existent to cling to the nonexistent fails to penetrate true nothingness. True blessing is boundless compassion. True nothingness is boundless penetration. Compassion saves beings; penetration illuminates principle. Broad compassion gathers virtue; illuminating principle clarifies the Dao. As the scripture says: *'Now, abandon compassion and be brave; abandon frugality and be expansive.'* Advancing the Dao is not a matter of grasping."

**Thirty-Eighth Question: On Grasping**
One asked again: "What is grasping?"
The answer: "Grasping is delusion, not correctness. The utmost real is the Dao; penetrating clarity is virtue. Exhausting things to penetrate returns the Dao. Dwelling below in profundity returns virtue. The true does not cling to the existent, and things return to it. The sea does not reside above, and clarity returns to it. Things returning completes their transformation. Clarity returning completes their utmost virtue. If one awakens to worldly falsity, one penetrates emptiness and nothingness to achieve merit. If one awakens to exhausting the self, one penetrates humility to achieve conduct. As the scripture says: *'Dwell in its substance, not its flower—thus, abandon that and grasp this.'* True nothingness grasps nothing and illuminates its center."

**Thirty-Ninth Question: On the Center**
One asked again: "What is the center?"
The answer: "The center is Heaven’s equilibrium. Heaven bestows grace to generate the myriad things without discrimination—this is called illuminating its center. Human equilibrium truly spreads virtue to penetrate the myriad transformations without partiality or favor—this is called illuminating its center. Heaven’s equilibrium brings the generation and completion of the myriad things, and Heaven has its merit. Human equilibrium brings the true penetration of the myriad transformations, and humanity has its conduct. If Heaven favors with grace, it lacks great merit. If humanity favors with kindness, it lacks great conduct. As the scripture says: *'The level Dao is like a gully.'* Illuminating the level Dao brings boundless celestial blessing."

**Fortieth Question: On Extremes**
One asked again: "What are extremes?"
The answer: "Extremes fail to penetrate principle. Seeing the existent and failing to penetrate the nonexistent, or seeing the nonexistent and failing to penetrate the existent—this is called extreme views."

Without clinging to extreme views, one penetrates principle. Seeing the existent and penetrating the nonexistent, seeing the nonexistent and penetrating the existent—this is called comprehension. Penetrating the existent, one embraces the Dao and withdraws into the grotto-heavens. Reaching the nonexistent, one embraces the Dao and conceals oneself in the capital’s splendor. As the scripture says: *"Act without acting, engage in affairs without affairs."* Not standing on either extreme is true non-attachment.

**Forty-First Question: On Attachment**
One asked again: "What is attachment?"
The answer: "Non-attachment to attachment means blending with the dust and merging one’s body with the myriad things. Truly unattached to the mind of the myriad existents—this is called great comprehension. Attachment to non-attachment means transcending the dust and distancing one’s body from the myriad things. Truly attached to the thoughts of the myriad things—this is called incomprehension. Non-attachment to attachment makes the body like the lotus root. Attachment to non-attachment makes the body like the lotus flower. The body in the dust while the nature is free of dust—this is true awakening. The body distant from the dust while the mind clings to dust—this is unawakened. As the scripture says: *'The worn-out becomes new.'* True awakening means the body responds to things—neither attached nor detached.

**Forty-Second Question: On Detachment**
One asked again: "What is detachment?"
The answer: "Detachment means the body withdraws from desire, the mind forgets the dust, and one serenely guards their aspiration. Detachment means the body retreats into famous mountains, truly harmonizing with zither and books, serenely delighting in the communion of aspiration. Guarding one’s aspiration is simplicity. Delighting in the communion of aspiration is refinement. The body simple and the mind refined—this is called the false form and spirit both wondrous. The form simple and dispersed while the true nature refined—this alone is called the true form and spirit both wondrous. As the scripture says: *'Do not show what may be desired, and the heart will not be disturbed.'* Pure liberation from the shell of things is the communion of the adept.

**Forty-Third Question: On Humanity**
One asked again: "What is humanity?"
The answer: "Humanity means that if one indulges in evil during life, one sinks into evil destinies after death, endlessly transmigrating—this is called Heaven’s governance over humanity. If one does not cultivate blessings in life, one sinks into poverty and lowliness after death, endlessly transmigrating—this is called Heaven’s governance over humanity. If one possesses goodness, one is born in the Central Lands to cultivate the Dao. If one accumulates great felicity, one is born in the Middle Kingdom to amass virtue. If one has evil, Heaven metes out evil retribution. If one has goodness, Heaven metes out good retribution. As the scripture says: *'In governing people and serving Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality.'* Humanity’s failure to comprehend Heaven’s intent arises from clinging to the self.

**Forty-Fourth Question: On the Self**
One asked again: "What is the self?"
The answer: "The self—the true self—is humanity’s nature. The self’s Dao is the formless Dao; the self’s goodness is the effortless goodness, which all call unworthy. The false self is humanity’s evil. The false Dao is the Dao of nurturing the body; the false goodness is the goodness of effort—all call this worthy. The true self—the formless Dao is true; the effortless goodness is constant. The false self—the Dao of nurturing the body is false; the goodness of effort is detestable. As the scripture says: *'The world all says my Dao is great and seems unworthy; if it were worthy, it would have long since become small.'* Illuminating the true self requires no contention.

**Forty-Fifth Question: On Contention**
One asked again: "What is contention?"
The answer: "Contention means that worldly contention arises from myriad evils; Heaven’s silence arises from myriad virtues. Worldly contention involves right and wrong; the Dao’s contention involves pure goodness. The world’s mouth contends while the heart lacks comprehension; the Dao’s mouth is silent while the truth is truly communicated. Lacking comprehension leads to vast erudition without knowing its wonder. True communication means cutting off learning yet knowing its wonder. Both are called delusion and awakening. As the scripture says: *'The good do not contend; the contentious are not good.'* Comprehending Heaven’s intent, one appears outwardly inarticulate.

**Forty-Sixth Question: On Inarticulateness**
One asked again: "What is inarticulateness?"
The answer: "Inarticulateness seems like inability to speak. Comprehending the Dao and dispersing into simplicity, the inarticulate seem eloquent. Embracing the Dao and returning to simplicity, the eloquent seem inarticulate. Dispersing simplicity harms qi and constrains the body. Returning to simplicity preserves qi and frees the body. To the foolish, the eloquent seem inarticulate. To the wise, the inarticulate seem eloquent. As the scripture says: *'Great skill seems clumsy; great eloquence seems inarticulate.'* Benefiting the true requires outwardly diminishing.

**Forty-Seventh Question: On Diminishing**
One asked again: "What is diminishing?"
The answer: "Diminishing means that the person of the Dao, when taking action, diminishes the self and does not diminish others. Placing oneself after others is possessing virtue. The person without the Dao, when taking action, diminishes others and does not diminish the self. Placing others before oneself is lacking virtue. Possessing virtue is non-action. Lacking virtue is action. Non-action that diminishes things is having the Dao; action that exhausts things is lacking the Dao. As the scripture says: *'In pursuing the Dao, daily diminish.'* Outwardly diminishing to the utmost in things is where the Dao’s benefit lies.

**Forty-Eighth Question: On Benefit**
One asked again: "What is benefit?"
The answer: "Benefit means benefiting the true is the principle of the Dao. Awakening to the Dao, one studies the correct teaching—those who comprehend benefit the true. Deluded by the world, one studies heterodox methods—those who lack comprehension benefit the self. Benefiting the true clarifies the Dao; benefiting the self exhausts things. Clarifying the Dao is pure goodness; exhausting things is greed and strife."

Purity and goodness accumulate virtue; greed and strife accumulate karma. Cultivating the ten thousand practices elevates the true. Accumulating the ten thousand karmas causes the self to fall. As the scripture says: *'In learning, daily increase.'* What one learns that increases the true of the Dao endures long.

**Forty-Ninth Question: On Endurance**
One asked again: "What is endurance?"
The answer: "Endurance is the enduring of humanity—following the Dao, the true endures. Forgetting emotions, life endures. Illuminating the wondrous, heaven endures. Penetrating wisdom, principle endures.
The true enduring is attaining the formless body.
Life enduring is treasuring the radiant perfection.
Heaven enduring is the auspicious mist curling.
Principle enduring is the spontaneous penetration.
Illuminating the formless, the Dao is complete.
Illuminating radiant perfection, life is complete.
Illuminating auspicious mist, spirit is complete.
Illuminating the spontaneous, virtue is complete.
As the scripture says: *'Heaven is enduring, earth is lasting.'*
Following heaven’s endurance, there is no shortness."

**Fiftieth Question: On Shortness**
One asked again: "What is shortness?"
The answer: "Shortness is failing to uphold the Dao to the end—will is short. Seeing goodness without compassion, conduct is short. Disrespecting the two venerables, filial piety is short.
Short will yields no merit. Without compassion, there is no conduct. Without filial piety, gratitude is forgotten.
Having will completes the Dao. Having compassion completes virtue. Repaying gratitude completes filial piety.
Without Dao, without virtue, without filial piety, there is shortness. With Dao, with virtue, with filial piety, there is no shortness.
As the scripture says: *'This is not goodness.'*
Short wisdom arises from false craft."

**Fifty-First Question: On Craft**
One asked again: "What is craft?"
The answer: "Craft is exhausting the ten thousand cunning actions—clarifying the ten thousand gains, where gains are many, harms the self. Cutting off the ten thousand cunning non-actions—clarifying the ten thousand purities, where purity is abundant, preserves the self.
Worldly gains multiply, giving rise to misfortune. Daoist purity multiplies, giving rise to blessing.
False craft gives rise to misfortune; true purity gives rise to blessing.
Deluded by existence, it is false. Awakened to non-existence, it is true.
False existence is harmed by evil; true non-existence is pervaded by goodness.
As the scripture says: *'Abandon craft, discard gain—thieves and robbers will not exist.'*
The enlightened forget false craft and uphold true clumsiness."

**Fifty-Second Question: On Clumsiness**
One asked again: "What is clumsiness?"
The answer: "Clumsiness is innate nature penetrating worthiness—outwardly appearing foolish and clumsy, called returning to simplicity. True wisdom penetrating culture—false form appearing dull and clumsy, called hidden concealment.
Facing false delusion, clumsiness is clarity. Facing true awakening, clumsiness is attainment.
Penetrating the world, things are attained. Penetrating the Dao, the true is attained.
Encountering worldly scholars, one responds to the ten thousand existences, and the mechanism naturally penetrates existence. Encountering kindred spirits, one responds to the ten thousand non-existences, and the mechanism naturally penetrates non-existence.
Outward clumsiness is not true foolishness.
As the scripture says: *'Nature has craft and clumsiness—it can be hidden.'*
Utmost craft appearing clumsy is praised by the enlightened."

**Fifty-Third Question: On Praise**
One asked again: "What is praise?"
The answer: "Praise is the noble extolling others’ virtues and concealing their flaws. The petty conceal others’ virtues and extol their flaws.
Concealing others’ flaws and evil, extolling their virtues and goodness, is called virtue. Extolling others’ flaws and evil, concealing their virtues and goodness, is called transgression.
Having virtue, one is again honored by others. Having transgression, one is again despised by others.
Those esteemed in this life are esteemed by others in the next. Those belittled in this life are belittled by others in the next.
Virtue completing the Dao ascends. Transgression deluded by the world falls.
As the scripture says: *'The wise do not speak; those who speak are not wise.'*
Good praise has no slander."

**Fifty-Fourth Question: On Slander**
One asked again: "What is slander?"
The answer: "Slander is the foolish slandering, not knowing the worthy. The worthy do not slander, knowing the foolish.
The foolish promote evil and suppress goodness. The worthy encourage evil to return to goodness.
The foolish generate transgressions, manifesting their appearances to seek blessing. The worthy erase transgressions, forgetting their appearances to uphold the Dao.
The deluded have evil and goodness. The awakened have no evil and no goodness.
Having goodness is inconstant. Having no evil is constant.
Constancy is called the Dao.
As the scripture says: *'The foolish take heaven and earth’s patterns as sagely; I take the patterns of time and things as wise.'*
Without slander, impure thoughts are forgotten."

**Fifty-Fifth Question: On Forgetting**
One asked again: "What is forgetting?"
The answer: "Forgetting is contemplating the Dao and forgetting the world, contemplating the correct and forgetting the heterodox—called delusion and awakening.
Contemplating the Dao cultivates the true. Contemplating the world nurtures the self.
Contemplating the correct penetrates the ultimate principle. Contemplating the heterodox cultivates the physical form.
Contemplating the true yields merit without transgression. Nurturing the self yields no merit with transgression.
Contemplating the correct has conduct without attachment. Contemplating the heterodox has attachment without conduct.
As the scripture says: *'The mind arises from things and dies by things.'*
Penetrating principle and illuminating the pivot, true forgetting of thoughts—externally without greed."

**Fifty-Sixth Question: On Greed**
One asked again: "What is greed?"
The answer: "Greed is coveting desires and losing life, coveting wealth and losing the self. The deluded first taste sweetness, then bitterness.
Eradicating desires preserves life. Cutting off wealth preserves the self. The awakened first taste bitterness, then sweetness."

Losing life and losing the self is folly; preserving life and preserving the self is wisdom. The turbid covet the world and violate the Dao; the pure forget the world and attain the Dao. As the scripture says: *"No sin is greater than yielding to desire; no disaster is greater than discontent."* Not coveting worldly falsity is to truly embrace the Dao.

**Fifty-Seventh Question: On the Dao**
One asked again: "What is the Dao?"
The answer: "The Dao is that which penetrates things yet is no-thing—this is the Dao. Knowing emptiness yet not empty, this is constancy, called the constancy of the Dao. When the constancy of the Dao is attained, non-action flows freely. *Non-* reveals the subtlety of the indistinct; *action* reveals the principle of adaptability. *Non-* lies beyond yin and yang; *action* illumines the transformations of the myriad things. Penetrating *non-* and illuminating *being*, comprehending *action* and illuminating *non-*—this is not clinging to form or doing. As the scripture says: *'The Dao constantly takes no action, yet there is nothing it does not do.'* The Dao’s doing is not petty goodness that transforms the vulgar.

**Fifty-Eighth Question: On the Vulgar**
One asked again: "What is the vulgar?"
The answer: "The vulgar is the common body of man. The true is the utmost spirit. It is called *having-thing*. Beyond *having*, the Dao precedes heaven and earth. Beyond things, nature lies outside yin and yang. Illuminating *having* is like seeing jade within stone. Illuminating *thing* is like seeing a pearl within a clam. *Having* is man’s form; *thing* is the true nature. When form ends, nature remains constant. When things are exhausted, qi remains ever-present. Deluded by *having* and *thing*, the hun and po scatter. Awakened to the Dao-nature, creation is accomplished. As the scripture says: *'There was a thing, chaotic yet complete, born before heaven and earth.'* Externally responsive to the vulgar, yet without falsity.

**Fifty-Ninth Question: On Falsity**
One asked again: "What is falsity?"
The answer: "Falsity is this: the superior person subtly practices myriad purities and myriad virtues, achieving great penetration; the inferior person openly indulges in myriad impurities and myriad evils, inviting great ridicule. The pure follow the Dao and endure; the turbid oppose the Dao and perish. The wise appear unwise; the foolish appear not foolish. Purity and turbidity, wisdom and folly—over time, the world knows them. The brightness of the sun and moon does not see its own light; the eyes of the world see their brightness. As the scripture says: *'When the inferior person hears the Dao, they laugh greatly.'* This is not *is*.

**Sixtieth Question: On *Is***
One asked again: "What is *is*?"
The answer: "*Is* is following the Dao, thus it is true. *Not-is* is following things, thus it is false. Illuminating the true prevents attachment to the false; illuminating *is* prevents speech of *not-is*. Illuminating the true subtly penetrates the Dao; illuminating *is* subtly penetrates heaven. Illuminating the Dao yields merit; illuminating heaven yields conduct. Merit is the yang Dao; conduct is the yin virtue. Privately aiding the myriad forms is called yang merit. Stealthily rescuing the myriad sufferings is called yin virtue. As the scripture says: *'Those who see themselves are not bright; those who assert themselves are not illustrious.'* Asserting oneself, contemplating the Dao, and responding to things—this is having thought.

**Sixty-First Question: On Thought**
One asked again: "What is thought?"
The answer: "Awakened thought—knowing the myriad purities and acting—yields myriad virtues; knowing the myriad attachments and acting—yields myriad evils. Myriad purities and myriad virtues lead to true ascent; myriad attachments and myriad evils lead to false descent. Living without transgression, dying without suffering. Living with transgression, dying with suffering. As the scripture says: *'My words are very easy to know, very easy to practice, yet none in the world can know, none can practice.'* Thinking and knowing the subtlety of principle, forgetting the world.

**Sixty-Second Question: On the World**
One asked again: "What is the world?"
The answer: "The world is this: penetrating the world and knowing man, one forgets the world and turns toward the Dao; deluded by the world and ignorant of man, one clings to the world and turns from the Dao. Truly penetrating the myriad things, one emerges from the shell of the myriad things. Falsely deluded by the myriad things, one remains within the shell of the myriad things. Truly emerging from the shell of things is the Dao; falsely remaining within the shell of things is dust. Truly abiding in the Dao, there is no life and death; falsely abiding in dust, there is life and death. Awakened, wisdom penetrates; deluded, it does not. As the scripture says: *'Knowing others is wisdom.'* When things reach their limit and transcend the world, the profound mystery is illuminated.

**Sixty-Third Question: On the Subtle**
One asked again: "What is the subtle?"
The answer: "The subtle is this: true non-desire—nature is like the full moon, observing its subtlety; false desire—delusion is like firefly glow, seeing its traces. The full moon illumines the ten directions; firefly glow illumines a single point. Illuminating the ten directions penetrates the myriad transformations; illuminating a single point clings to one dharma. Penetrating transformations accommodates the heterodox; clinging to dharma slanders the correct. Without high or low, penetrating—this is correctness. With love and hate, clinging—this is heterodoxy. As the scripture says: *'Constantly without desire, observe its subtlety; constantly with desire, observe its manifestations.'* Penetrating the subtle illuminates the minute.

**Sixty-Fourth Question: On the Minute**
One asked again: "What is the minute?"
The answer: "The minute is this: seeing its profound subtlety illuminates the Dao; illuminating its profound consideration penetrates the world. Penetrating the Dao foresees penetrating the world; penetrating the world does not penetrate the Dao. Illuminating the Dao is elevation; penetrating the world—penetrating the world [forgetting the world]—is reverence. Penetrating the Dao, practicing the Dao, is attainment. Penetrating the world, forgetting the world, is wisdom."

The enlightened transform the world’s worthy. The worthy transform the world’s foolish. When the foolish attain clarity, they become worthy; when the worthy attain clarity, they become enlightened. As the scripture says: *"Subtle, wondrous, and profoundly interconnected—deep beyond comprehension."* Awakening to the hidden and minute illuminates boundless clarity.

**Sixty-Fifth Question: On the Square**
One asked again: "What is the square?"
The answer: "The square is this: heaven is square, earth is round—these arise within the myriad things. They do not bestow life through favor, nor do they bring destruction through hatred. The Supreme spreads virtue to save the ten thousand spirits, not clinging to the noble with attachment, nor cutting off the lowly. Heaven and earth give life to the myriad things, spreading *qi* with impartiality. The Supreme saves the ten thousand spirits, spreading virtue with impartiality. When the myriad things connect through *qi*, they partake in heaven and earth’s great benevolence. When the ten thousand spirits connect through virtue, they partake in the Supreme’s great meritorious conduct. This is called the sages of heaven and earth—yet if they act with partiality, even their greatest deeds and conduct become flawed. As the scripture says: *'Thus the sage is square but does not cut.'* Truly illuminating the square inch of the heart-mind radiates a perfect mandate."

**Sixty-Sixth Question: On the Round**
One asked again: "What is the round?"
The answer: "The round is this: heaven’s round light—when gazing at the sun, the moon is full; on the darkest night, its light is exhausted. A person’s mandate-light: at fifteen, it begins to receive the embryo; at sixteen, the mandate is complete. At sixty-four (eight times eight), the hexagrams are exhausted. When light is exhausted, heaven has no illumination; when hexagrams are exhausted, a person has no mandate. Few desires extend the mandate; many desires shorten the lifespan. This is called the waxing and waning of heaven and humanity. Without attachment, the mandate abides; without things, the nature flows. When the mandate flows through nature, it is like water encountering earth. When nature flows through the mandate, it is like earth encountering water. Constantly practicing the good and flowing through it, true fire descends; after nine transformations, the form becomes indestructible. As the scripture says: *'Seeing the small is called clarity.'* When the round light manifests, it responds."

**Sixty-Seventh Question: On Response**
One asked again: "What is response?"
The answer: "The formless Dao does not respond to the embodied form; the formless nature does not respond to the rituals of attachment. Those who value substance follow the immortal Dao, and the Dao responds to their nature. Those who value ornamentation follow the human Dao, and their form responds to ritual. Responding to nature is truth; responding to ritual is falsehood. Heaven’s Dao suppresses the high and uplifts the low; humanity’s Dao diminishes the poor and serves the rich. Following heaven’s Dao is contrary to humanity’s Dao; following humanity’s Dao is contrary to heaven’s Dao. As the scripture says: *'When highest ritual is enacted, none respond.'* When the Dao responds to non-action, true transformation flows."

**Sixty-Eighth Question: On Transformation**
One asked again: "What is transformation?"
The answer: "Transformation is this: true transformation through non-action is like seeing the moon reflected in water; false transformation through action is like seeing one’s form in a mirror. Knowing the transformation of non-action, true nature flows. Seeing the transformation of action, false form exerts force. Flowing is the truth of non-attachment, forgetting the falsehood of attachment. Force is the falsehood of attachment, obscuring the truth of non-attachment. True transformation flows through nature and Dao; false transformation clings to the body and profit. When the Dao flows, nature is preserved; when profit is grasped, the body is harmed. As the scripture says: *'Act through non-action, and nothing is left ungoverned.'* Responding to true transformation, the Dao is without attachment."

**Sixty-Ninth Question: On Attachment**
One asked again: "What is attachment?"
The answer: "Attachment is this: when bent, the Dao-nature is without attachment, yet the body seems to possess it; when rigid, the Dao-nature has attachment, yet the body appears without it. A bent nature without attachment is without leakage; a rigid nature with attachment is with leakage. Bent is worthy; rigid is foolish. Without leakage and with worthiness, there is Dao and virtue. With leakage and without worthiness, there is no Dao and no virtue. The truth of having Dao preserves the hun and po; the clarity of having virtue flows through the ten thousand transformations. As the scripture says: *'I have no desires, and the people become naturally simple; I have no attachments, and the people become naturally pure.'* The Dao without attachment is true, unentangled by worldly things."

**Seventieth Question: On Things**
One asked again: "What are things?"
The answer: "Things are this: a person within the shell of things is like a fish in a net; a person beyond the shell of things is like truth within the Dao. A fish in a net, separated from water, dies. Truth within the Dao, separated from things, lives. If a fish does not covet bait, it remains in water; if a person does not covet things, they remain in the Dao. A fish in water lives; a person in the Dao thrives. A fish obtaining the pearl’s light transforms; a person obtaining the surge of *qi* flows through. Both, when deluded, die; when awakened, live. As the scripture says: *'Heaven’s net is vast, loose yet never failing.'* Beyond things, one forgets the mechanism."

**Seventy-First Question: On Mechanism**
One asked again: "What is mechanism?"
The answer: "Mechanism is this: cunning. Those without Dao use cunning to harm others, securing themselves—this is called thievery. Those with Dao use cunning to diminish themselves, securing others—this is called blessing. Petty cunning is foolish and evil; great cunning is worthy and good. The foolish defy heaven; the worthy follow heaven. Defying heaven, the body falls; following heaven, truth ascends. The fallen follow the murky path of yin; the ascended follow the clear path of yang. As the scripture says: *'The people are difficult to govern because of their many schemes.'* The wisdom of spontaneity illuminates the Dao, leaving no concerns."

**Seventy-Second Question: On Thought**
One asked again: "What is thought?"
The answer: "In delusion, the world gives rise to the heart-mind; in awakening to the Dao, there is no thought. Those who covet and contend spin myriad thoughts; those who are pure and good sever myriad thoughts. Obscurity brings boundless transgression; clarity brings boundless blessing. Without goodness, one remains ever evil; without evil, one remains ever good. Ever evil accumulates faults; ever good accumulates virtue. Faults bring the suffering of yin; virtue brings the joy of yang. The world knows gain but not harm; the Dao knows blessing but not greed. As the scripture says: *'To know yet to seem not to know is best; not to know yet to claim to know is a flaw.'* Sever thought and exhaust all things, and the supreme Dao draws near."

**Seventy-Third Question: On Intimacy**
One asked again: "What is intimacy?"
The answer: "Intimacy is this: in the world, what people hold close are fame and profit, false treasures. Beyond things, what they hold close are the Dao and virtue, true treasures. False intimacy brings fame and profit, yet with them come favor and disgrace; false treasures invite harm from evil men. True intimacy brings the Dao and virtue, and with them clarity and peace; true treasures invite encroachment from good men. The false benefits the body but harms its truth; the true benefits the body but harms the false. As the scripture says: *'Which is closer, fame or the self? Which is greater, the self or wealth?'* When the Dao is intimate, things grow distant."

**Seventy-Fourth Question: On Distance**
One asked again: "What is distance?"
The answer: "Distance is this: to loathe the world is to find the Dao without distance; to loathe profit is to find the body without harm; to loathe nobility is to find the body without baseness. The Dao without distance connects to the world; the body without harm connects to profit; the body without baseness connects to nobility. Connection to the world brings the return of goodness; connection to profit brings the return of blessing; connection to nobility brings the return of virtue. Ever good, one connects to the numinous; truly blessed, one connects to destiny; supremely virtuous, one connects to heaven. As the scripture says: *'Thus it cannot be made intimate, nor can it be made distant.'* Not distancing oneself from the truth of the Dao, one illuminates its eternity."

**Seventy-Fifth Question: On Remoteness**
One asked again: "What is remoteness?"
The answer: "Remoteness is this: the Dao encompasses eternity; heaven’s height covers all; earth’s bearing sustains all things; the king’s greatness brings clarity to all. The Dao illumines the ages; heaven illumines the myriad forms; earth gives life to the myriad things; the king brings peace to the myriad people. The Dao embraces all; heaven covers all; earth bears all; the king contains all. The Dao’s embrace is vast; heaven’s covering is vast; earth’s bearing is vast; the king’s containment is vast. As the scripture says: *'Greatness means departure; departure means remoteness.'* The Dao is not remote in truth—harmonizing with the Dao brings nearness."

**Seventy-Sixth Question: On Nearness**
One asked again: "What is nearness?"
The answer: "Nearness is this: near the body of one with Dao, observe the body of one without Dao; near the household of one with Dao, observe the household of one without Dao; near the village of one with Dao, observe the village of one without Dao; near the state of one with Dao, observe the state of one without Dao; near the world of one with Dao, observe the world of one without Dao. A filial body repays the kindness of father and mother; a good household is like that of Xu Jun and Pang Shi; a virtuous village pities the poor and cherishes the aged; a clear state brings abundance to the myriad people; when the world possesses the Dao, the world ripens. As the scripture says: *'Thus observe the self through the self.'* Illuminating the Dao, one truly practices it."

**Seventy-Seventh Question: On Practice**
One asked again: "What is practice?"
The answer: "Practice is this: the highest practice is the Dao of heaven. Heaven and earth do not speak, yet silently bestow their grace, giving life to the myriad things. The highest does not speak, yet silently bestows its virtue, practicing the myriad goods. Heaven and earth do not speak, yet their grace and goodness respond. The highest does not speak, yet its teaching of goodness pervades. The myriad things fulfilled, the people prosper; the myriad transformations illuminated, truth pervades. The people prosper, and the state knows great peace; truth pervades, and joy abides in effortlessness. The people prosper, and each attends to scholar, farmer, artisan, merchant; truth pervades, and the highest’s non-action is revealed. As the scripture says: *'Practice the teaching without words.'* The Dao is not practiced anywhere; virtue does not abide anywhere."

**Seventy-Eighth Question: On Abiding**
One asked again: "What is abiding?"
The answer: "Abiding is dwelling. The true has no emotion, yet its form resides in the Dao; the false has emotion, yet its body lodges in the world. The true form interacts with the Dao; the false body interacts with things. Forgetting the true form is the Dao; the body responding to the world is virtue. The heart-mind with emotion is delusion; the body distant from the world is attachment. With the Dao and virtue, there is no delusion or attachment; without the Dao and virtue, there is delusion and attachment. Truly possessing the Dao and virtue, one is worthy and good; falsely lacking the Dao and virtue, one is foolish and evil. As the scripture says: *'At peace in one’s dwelling, content in one’s customs.'* Abiding forever in the great void, one is thus."

**Seventy-Ninth Question: On Thusness**
One asked again: "What is thusness?"
The answer: "Thusness is this: thus in the three realms, the Dao manifests without constraint; drifting through the four seas, the true conceals without companion. The Dao without constraint lies beyond yin and yang; the true without companion dwells in the azure heavens. The body of the Dao is neither empty nor form; the light of the true neither wanes nor waxes. Attaining non-being, one emerges from the shell of the myriad things; penetrating action, one reveals the brightness of the myriad wisdoms. Heaven’s great grace seems without grace; accumulating great virtue seems without virtue—this is called illuminating the Dao of heaven. As the scripture says: *'Only because it does not abide, it is not abandoned.'* Thus delighting in the Dao and responding to mechanism, one pities the multitude."

**Eightieth Question: On the Multitude**
One asked again: "What is the multitude?"

The Master replied: "The multitude is that which the multitude clarifies—cherishing fame, cherishing gain, cherishing right, cherishing wrong. What I obscure is the forgetting of fame, the forgetting of gain, the forgetting of right, the forgetting of wrong. The multitude cherishes fame and thus incurs disgrace; I forget fame and thus know no disgrace. The multitude cherishes gain and thus invites harm; I forget gain and thus suffer no harm. The multitude cherishes right and thus invites wrong; I forget right and thus know no wrong. The multitude cherishes wrong and thus incurs fault; I forget wrong and thus bear no fault. As the scripture says: *'The multitude is bright and clear; I alone seem obscured.'* The Record of the Perfected One of Non-Action, Purity, and Everlasting Life is here concluded."
