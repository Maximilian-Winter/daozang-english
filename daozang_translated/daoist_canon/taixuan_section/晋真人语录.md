The Master said:
Since the beginning of creation until this day, humanity has sunk into suffering without end. Now is the time when immortals descend and the Great Dao rises. Though all are children of heaven, the wise and the foolish differ. The wise turn toward the Dao, while the foolish turn away. Those who turn toward the Dao live; those who turn away die.

A pure heart and tranquil intent are the path to heaven. A scattered mind and chaotic thoughts are the gates of hell. I ask you all: is it better to ascend to heaven or descend to hell?

Though the Dao is revered and virtue is noble, how could they be expounded to the deluded and foolish? Were it not for the flourishing of the Dao in this age, how could the pure and wondrous celestial mechanism be revealed to the world, drawing forth the wise and enlightened?

The Master said:
In cultivating the Dao, one must first recognize the root of one’s nature and life. Only then can one refine the truth to preserve life. The beginning of cultivation lies in *storing the Three*, *embracing the Origin*, and *guarding the One*.

*Storing the Three* refers to essence, qi, and spirit—the Three Treasures.
*Embracing the Origin* means holding fast to the original yang true qi.
*Guarding the One* means preserving the singular numinous spirit.

The spirit resides originally in the heart, which belongs to the southern fire of bing and ding. Within the heart lies nature, which is yang. The kidneys generate the original yang true qi, which belongs to the northern water of ren and gui. Water is life, and life is yin. Thus, the above explains nature and life, clarifying their origins. From ancient times to now, most people have not understood nature and life, but today they are revealed to the world.

The Master said:
The study of the Dao originally has three stages.
First, focus the mind within the lower elixir field, the immortal’s grotto, and do not allow the heart and intent to scatter. Embrace the original yang true qi—this is the foundation of longevity and the true essence of the Dao. It is the path from death to life, the alchemical furnace of yin and yang. Within this elixir field, settle the heart and stabilize the intent, abiding in profound stillness, continuous and unbroken. After diligently guarding this for three to five years, naturally, within the cauldron, the two qi will merge, warming into a single darkness. Through transformation, it becomes emptiness, and the numinous embryo forms into an immortal vessel. The spirit within the heart becomes numinous, leaping with joy, singing and dancing of its own accord. Generally, when the spirit attains the numinosity of qi, and qi attains the clarity of the spirit—*The Scripture of Yin Convergence* says: "Sagely work arises therein, and numinous clarity emerges." Qi is the mother of the spirit, and the spirit is the child of qi. If mother and child constantly guard each other without separation, naturally, over time, the spirit stabilizes, and the immortal Dao is achieved.

Second, having attained *spirit stabilized and qi harmonized*, then release the four great elements—do not cling to them. Cultivate with ease, and the Dao’s qi will naturally arise in pure stillness. The spirit will ascend to the numinous palace, forever present before you, never turning back.

Third, having attained *spirit stabilized and black qi harmonized*, one surpasses the natural lifespan. Release the heart to be open and carefree, at ease and free, untroubled and serene—this is the achievement of the Limitless Great Dao. When purity is perfected, and one day merit is complete and conduct fulfilled, you will receive the Jade Emperor’s summons to the celestial assembly, becoming a person of unimpeded freedom, enjoying eternal joy and bliss.

The Master said:
In studying the Dao and cultivating practice, if the living spirit is unstable, it is only because the work is not yet complete. Do not count the years; simply hold fast. As Perfected Lü said: "Do not say the Great Dao is hard to attain—it is only that the work is not yet complete."

The Master said:
If one cultivates with carelessness, effort is not diligent, and the spirit is not clear. Persevere without betraying true practice; the heart is not wearied, the will is not reckless, essence is not depleted, and the spirit does not flee.

The Master said:
Alas! I see people in the world seeking masters and inquiring about the Dao, yet unwilling to be humble and obedient. They claim to surpass others in ability. When it comes to cultivation, they are neither diligent nor cautious, nor patient. They rely only on empty words, lacking true skill. They do not cultivate with urgency, and upon seeing the poor, they lack any heart to relieve them. Such failures in merit and conduct cause deficiencies in hidden virtue and transgressions against the Dao. For such people, the attainment of immortality and the verification of the Dao are far indeed.

Now, let me briefly speak of the causes of the Dao’s fruition. Heaven only aids those with true merit and true conduct. Those of great goodness and virtue naturally move heaven and earth. As the scripture says: "Heaven is impartial; it aids only those with virtue." If one seeks true merit, one must settle the heart and stabilize the intent, gather the spirit, remain unmoved and uncontrived, truly pure and truly still, embrace the Origin and guard the One, store the spirit and secure the qi—this is true merit. If one seeks true conduct, one must cultivate practice and accumulate virtue, relieve the poor and rescue the suffering. Upon seeing others in distress, one should always harbor a heart to save them. Or, one may guide and instruct good people to enter the Dao and cultivate practice. In all actions, put others before oneself, and be selfless toward all things—this is true conduct.

The Master said:
If one cultivates practice to nurture life, one must first accumulate merit and amass work. With merit but no conduct, the Dao’s fruition is difficult to achieve. Only with both merit and conduct complete is one called a Perfected Person.

The Master said:
We speak to those within the teaching: you must greatly awaken to the principles of nature and deeply explore the wondrous Dao, with your will set on cultivating practice and studying immortality. *The Scripture of Western Ascension* says: "Eliminate defilements, cease thoughts, purify the heart, and guard the One." When all defilements are removed, all affairs are complete—this is the essential teaching of my Dao, the peerless within the wondrous.

In all exchanges of Daoist discourse, attend to the treasure within the body, exhort others to turn toward heaven’s Dao, and follow heaven’s principles. Do not slander heaven or revile earth. As for Zhang Yuanzi, who spoke madly with his back turned, discoursing on matters of the spirit—he was indeed a person who had attained the Dao.

Here is the translation:

---

Yet one must be tolerant and not seek others’ faults.

The Master said: Those who study the Dao must keep their entire being pure and undefiled. They must not kill living things, consume alcohol, eat meat, break precepts, or violate the rules of sexual conduct. In all matters, they should be forbearing, endure hardship themselves, and yield to others. They must abandon anger, resentment, greed, and extravagance, and always practice patience, humility, and frugality. When they see others in distress, they should feel compassion and relieve their suffering; when they see others in poverty, they must aid them in their urgent needs. In doing good, they should put others before themselves. In their dealings with others, they should be humble toward superiors and harmonious with inferiors. They should repay enmity with kindness. They must not notice others’ faults or speak of others’ wrongs. They should silently accumulate hidden virtue, seeking no recognition from others, only hoping that Heaven will take notice—such a person is truly one who walks the Dao.

The Master said: The Great Dao has no fixed form; its subtlety is beyond measure. The sage embodies it in daily life, while the common people use it daily yet remain unaware. Turning away from the Dao, one loses one’s true nature and moves toward the realm of death, never realizing that a person exists within the Dao as a fish exists within water. A fish dies when it leaves the water; a person perishes when they lose the Dao.

The Master said: The meaning of the scriptures is often profound and obscure, difficult to comprehend at once. Now, I will use the language of the world to dispel delusion and point the way to awakening. If there is still anything unclear, seek further instruction from later generations. If one can grasp the meaning and cultivate practice, they may be permitted to transmit it as a disciple, preserving life and refining the true nature, accumulating blessings to the ends of the earth, and healing others’ illnesses as a great practice. Whoever receives this text will erase the sins of nine generations of ancestors and bring fortune to their parents. My heart’s wish is to universally relieve suffering, sickness, and the perils of life and death. If anyone deceives others with these words, they will be condemned to the Dark Mountains for ten thousand kalpas.

**Verse:**
To study the Dao, one must be as steadfast as iron,
Severing body and mind without hesitation.
Bite through ignorance in a single stroke,
Never wavering in thought before or after.

**The Secret of Cultivating Nature in the Perfected Immortal Tradition of Ancestor Chongyang**

The Complete Realization (Quanzhen) is the pure emptiness of the Great Dao, the gate of effortless and carefree spontaneity, the pure and upright family tradition, the living practice of Chongyang. Those who cultivate immortality and study the Dao must not recklessly wander in search of Chan or waste effort in questioning the Dao. In group settings, guard your speech to accumulate true merit; in solitude, guard your mind to amass genuine conduct. Do not overlook even minor transgressions, nor neglect the accumulation of small virtues. Tightly restrain the monkey-mind, firmly capture the horse-intent. Dispel the Three Rebels to calm the spirit; exterminate the Six Bandits to stabilize the mind. Gently regulate the fire and water, subtly adjust the breath to refine true merit. In purity and stillness, lower yourself; in humility and gentleness, temper the heart. Be reverent toward others, and it will benefit you.

Examine every aspect to break through this walking corpse; in every thing, cease the wandering of the bones. Yet how is it that people take clever speech as ability, each one clinging to strength as victory? The fire of ignorance burns fiercely, claiming supremacy; the mountain of self and others looms high, asserting sole correctness. In crowds, they do not humble themselves; in bustling places, they do not seek stillness. In desire, the spirit scatters; in motion, the mind scatters. There is another type who rely entirely on begging for sustenance, claiming it is true cultivation. Such are the lazy and indulgent ghosts, the dull and unenlightened. These foolish and aimless fools would do better to hear early and temper their stubborn minds, casting off falsity to cultivate the true and complete their nature.

If one clings to cleverness, the nature becomes obscured; if one fixates on the mind-lamp, it suddenly dims. Stinginess makes the Great Dao difficult to achieve; cruelty makes the mysterious truth hard to awaken to. Jealousy of the worthy and envy of the capable invite transgression; fear of death and clinging to life create sin. Selling talismans and peddling arts to deceive others, seeking pleasure and treating illness for profit—these are thieves within the Dao and harm to the multitude. Failing to awaken to the wondrous secret, they wander aimlessly, their minds and intentions lost in madness. Having received offerings from the faithful in all directions, they can hardly repay them. If one cultivates diligently and completes the true heart, even a moment of laziness will plunge them into hell. If one encounters a true teacher and earnestly seeks the wondrous secret, do not let the foolish know of it. There is no need for the laborious work of shaking sinews and marrow, nor the deceptive arts of dual cultivation. Simply master the initial stage of non-action, and naturally feel the harmony of spirit and qi, the joyful completion of the elixir furnace. The numinous cinnabar shines brightly, the radiance of the spirit-light gleams, revealing the ancestral origin of the Dao and virtue. Recognize this as the source of purity and tranquility, the wondrous gate of nature and life, the mold of liberated immortals. If everyone awakens to this mystery, they will attain longevity and eternal vision. This is not deceptive speech to mislead others, nor is it heretical arts to entice you.

I earnestly admonish the lofty scholars of the Complete Realization and exhort the deluded followers of the world. Let each awaken to these harmful winds and together ascend to the true teaching. Now, I have explained the essentials of cultivation, capable of dispelling the doubts of those lost in the desert of delusion. I hope that all will leave the mundane to ascend to the true, each severing the dust to attain the Dao. Thus, may all sentient beings ascend to the realm of immortals.

**Answers to Master Ma’s Fourteen Questions**

**First Question:** What is the unfathomable place where thought and spirit meet, where dragon and tiger converge in stillness?
**Answer:** That is the realm of utter emptiness and quiescence.

**Second Question:** What is the Gate of the Mysterious Female, said to be the root of heaven and earth?
**Answer:** The *xuan* is the father’s essence; the *pin* is the mother’s blood. Originally, each was eight ounces, combining to make one catty. A single point of primordial yang true qi is the original root.

**Third Question:** What is the day of returning to life and reverting to the root, called stillness?
**Answer:** Simply ensure the mind does not chase after things, remains unstained and unattached. When the mind is settled and the intent undispersed, the spirit unobscured—this is reverting to the root. Without this, one cannot return to the root.

**Fourth Question:** How does one see the nature?
**Answer:** Simply have no mind, no thoughts, and do not cling to anything. Be clear and serene, with nothing arising within or without—this is seeing the nature.

**Fifth Question:** What is responding to things without obscuration?
**Answer:** Though the ears hear, the eyes see, and the mouth speaks, simply ensure the mind does not cling. This is it.

**Sixth Question:** What are the Heavenly Gate and Earthly Pivot, and how does one keep them in mutual embrace?
**Answer:** The Heavenly Gate and Earthly Pivot are nothing other than the two words *spirit* and *qi*. Simply remain unattached and unstained, with the mind settled—this is the dark stabilization. If the mind stirs, the *qi* scatters. If the mind does not move, mother and child embrace one another.

**Seventh Question:** What is the three-foot sword of emerging from being and entering non-being, and the life-bestowing, death-defying elixir pellet?
**Answer:** Emerging from being and entering non-being is simply the one darkness. The three-foot sword is wisdom. The life-bestowing, death-defying is the single numinous true nature. The elixir pellet is destiny. Just employ clarity and purity, be without mind, and seek a quiet place to sit—there is nothing more to it.

**Eighth Question:** What is regulating the breath?
**Answer:** It is not something done. If the mind is free of affairs, the *qi*-breath naturally regulates itself. But to be aware of regulating the breath is already clinging. In regulating the breath, one must not perceive it, nor fixate upon the mouth and nose. Today I tell you, fellow practitioners, there is nothing else to it. Simply ensure the mind is free of affairs, and seek a quiet place to sit. It is only because my mind was free of affairs that I entered the Great Dao. Follow this path.

**Ninth Question:** What does the Great Master Bodhidharma mean by "lifting empty space and turning to observe one’s face"?
**Answer:** Empty space is the one nature. Turning the head to observe is to be without obscuration.

**Tenth Question:** How may a disciple who has left the household late in life, with sinews and blood in decline, be instructed?
**Answer:** Replenish them.

**Further Question:** What does "replenish" mean?
**Answer:** Simply ensure that in every situation the mind is free of affairs, all entanglements are released, and the six senses do not engage with the external. Use only the one master—speak little, do not cling to things, remain unwavering throughout the twelve hours, reduce sleep, and set everything aside at once. This is replenishment.

**Eleventh Question:** What are lead and mercury?
**Answer:** Lead is the father’s essence; mercury is the mother’s blood. They are also the two words *nature and life*, *dragon and tiger*.

**Twelfth Question:** When in stillness, all manner of thoughts arise, or one becomes excessively drowsy. How can thoughts be stilled and drowsiness reduced?
**Answer:** It is only because the inner core lacks substance. When the spirit is faint and subtle, if the inner core is truly substantial, thoughts will naturally cease, and drowsiness will not arise.

**Thirteenth Question:** What is meant by "the place beyond heaven and earth’s reckoning, where even ghosts and spirits do not know"?
**Answer:** What else could it be?

**Fourteenth Question:** What does it mean for the twelve hours to seem like one?
**Answer:** Not only should the twelve hours seem like one, but even if it were a thousand or ten thousand days, the slightest deviation from this unity would already be premature extinction.

*Eighteen Questions and Answers on Miscellaneous Treasures of the Daoist Gate*
*Quanzhen School*

To be a Perfect Realized One is to align with the Dao of Heaven’s heart. The spirit does not stray, qi does not scatter, essence does not leak—when these three are complete, the Five Phases gather in full, the Four Symbols rest in harmony, and this is called *Perfect Realization*.

**Verse:**
Ever follow the ancestral master’s teachings,
In daily practice, hold the heart of the Old Lord.
Refine the true nature of Suchness—
Is this not *Perfect Realization*?

**Reverent Salutation:**
Precious and weighty—
No outward form, no inner substance, true emptiness within and without.
From the Ultimateless to the Great Beginning,
Communing with the divine to receive blessings.
The tradition of the Most High—
Eternal life, undying.
No thought, no attachment,
Transforming the Dharma-realm.
Within the forest of the Seven Treasures,
Layer upon layer, light upon light,
Unshaken, unmoved—
This is the reverent salutation, precious and weighty.

**The Master:**
No dharma existed before the self,
Radiant yet formless.
Unchanged through ancient and modern—
Is this not *the Master*?

**The Daoist Novice:**
The novice was originally one with the Great Dao,
Only by thinking of the world did they enter the cage of the mundane.
Now their mind dwells beyond the azure heavens,
All dharmas unbound, in communion with the Dao.

**Unkempt Hair:**
This is the ancient tradition of the Most High—
Master one dharma, and all dharmas are mastered.
Lay down even the slightest defilement,
And the single nature naturally aligns with Heaven.

**Topknot:**
The topknot was left behind by Zhongli,
Atop Kunlun’s peak, the sun is placed.
No one disturbs it to wash at Changshan,
And on the earth, the white ox roams freely.

**Crown:**
A pair of starry eyes survey front and back,
All dharmas gathered and stored within.
Inside and out, exquisitely wrought, no trace revealed—
Radiant and solitary, the path is bright and clear.

**Robes:**
Once fallen and careless, reckoning not the seasons,
The robe is vast and wide, enveloping heaven and earth.
Cut off from the red dust, the body remains unstained,
Neither cold nor heat can intrude.

**Four Towers:**
Spring, summer, autumn, winter—arrayed in four robes,
Encompassing the ten thousand images, who knows this?
Wine, sex, wealth, and anger—mundane affairs,
All four cast aside, all strife extinguished.

**Bamboo Hat:**
Alone it hangs atop Kunlun’s peak,
A single round light illumines boundlessly.
Let wind, rain, frost, and snow come as they may—
This single pagoda serves as an unyielding sky.

**Sash:**
How many times does it circle in coming and going?
The wayward monkey and stubborn horse are tightly bound.
A thousand strands, ten thousand threads—all laid down,
And the wheel of birth and death loses its escape.

**Pouch:**
A cloth three feet square,
Who knows the work of creation?
Within it transcends the Dharma-realm,
Enveloping the Great Void.

**Staff:**
Upright, it stands between heaven and earth,
Horizontally, it bears the sun, moon, mountains, and rivers.
Turning the marrow of heaven and earth,
It moves the ten thousand images of the forest of phenomena.

**Bowl:**
One bowl holds the rice of a thousand homes,
A solitary body roams ten thousand miles.
To escape the path of birth and death,
Begging sustains the passing seasons.

**Shoes:**
Step by step, following me without counting the years,
Coming and going, treading the old mountains and rivers.
From now on, no more mud or water—
Let them fly in pairs across the azure sky.

**Coming and Going:**
Coming from the Great Dao,
Going by the original Dao.
Coming and going without clinging to dust,
Dwelling in purity and stillness.

**Leaving Home to Cultivate the Dao:**
Once parted from the dust, this is leaving home,
Non-action, non-creation—my livelihood.
If one asks for the secret of my cultivation,
Clouds scatter, the blue sky, the moon shines alone.

**Daily Practice:**
Nurturing nature, forgetting emotions—this is daily practice,
Begging door to door—this is my livelihood.
Coming and going freely, without hindrance,
The clear wind and bright moon are my neighbors.

**Verse:**
Immortals are what worldly people seek,
But who is willing to let all matters in the heart rest?
If you awaken to your own true nature and life,
You will roam with the clear wind and bright moon.

**Two *Shuilong Yin* Poems:**

**I**
Originally left the world to leave home,
No longer coveting worldly glory or profit.
Unkempt hair, a soiled face,
Sitting alone all day, cultivating inner livelihood.
In an ancient temple’s niche,
Let the red sun set in the west.
From nothingness recognize being,
Know the white, guard the black,
Ceaselessly and silently regulating the breath.

The mind holds no entanglements,
A pouch at the side, a staff in hand.
Straw sandals broken, hempen cords frayed,
Bare legs, a sheep’s hide covering the body.
After hunger, wandering door to door,
When full, returning—singing *li lan luo li*.
Let others laugh and call me
A dull, lazy fellow—
Who among them understands?

**II**
The heart of one who studies the Dao is hard as iron,
Entirely self-reliant, fiercely resolute.

**Breaking Free**

Shattering the shackles of profit, severing the bonds of fame,
All loves and passions wholly cast aside.
Nothing left to cling to—
No entanglements, no lingering ties—
Dwelling in a thatched hut of reeds.
Even amid the bustling marketplace,
Upright and steadfast in guarding the Dao,
Relying on this practice to pass the days and months.
As a poor Daoist mendicant,
Content with coarse fare, heedless of cold or heat.

Unkempt hair, a soiled face,
Sitting alone all day, cultivating inner work.
Having met a radiant teacher’s instructions,
The world calls him mad, a wind-driven fool.
Yet there are profound and subtle moments—
How to speak of the seven songs’ mysteries?

**Eulogy:**
Alone I ascend the high mountain, gazing toward the eight directions,
Black clouds disperse, leaving the moon solitary.
In this boundless cosmos, countless are the people—
Which man among them is a true husband?

Within the depths of the Crimson Cavern Grotto,
The Dao is not distant—yet people, though near, fail to awaken.
The floating and sinking of inner landscapes
Require the master’s craftsmanship.
Awaiting dawn’s arrival,
A single yang stirs, opening the path to the mysterious.
All is concealed within the azure waves,
In their profound depths, the master of affairs.
The earth’s thunder resounds,
Shaking the mountaintop with rain.
Gradually it nourishes the yellow sprout, newly risen from the soil.
The infant is gathered and carried away in a basket,
Toward the true radiance of the six yangs,
Simmered within the crucible.
Circulating and turning,
East and west, south and north.
Laying out the eight trigrams,
The nine palaces must know their ancestral source.
Within the reckoning of the ten celestial stems,
Divided left and right,
The dragon and tiger must be made manifest.
The Dark Warrior follows the Vermilion Bird,
Auspicious clouds spread forth in the vanguard.
At the Winding River’s edge,
All spirits gather to meet the master.
Returning to the mother of *gui*,
Riding the crimson dragon back to the grotto.
Seek out Master Ding to inquire of his abode,
Where yin and yang unite in three thousand measures.
Pointing to heaven and earth, seas and mountains,
All endure as one, firm and unyielding.

**Poem:**
The Yellow River’s waters turn at the Lü family’s home,
A single gourd holds heaven and earth, aged in mist and haze.
The heartless white deer tames the vermilion phoenix,
A black tortoise coils around the crimson serpent.
In the sixth month, white snow flies on the mountain’s peak,
In the third winter, the yellow sprout grows beneath the waters.
If one grasps these principles,
Immortals on earth swarm like hemp.

**Green-Headed Duck**
In speech, ever constant—
Awakening from the southern branch’s dream of yellow roots.
Shattering the splendor of the world,
In a cloud niche clad in plain cloth,
Recognizing one’s lineage,
Turning the light inward to reflect.
Wielding the sword of wisdom to sever the net of love,
Brandishing the staff of transcendence to shatter the dusty realm.
Wherever we meet,
At Mount Emei, at will,
Swiftly concealing our brilliance, we hasten to Mount Hua.
Hidden in forests and springs,
South Star and Northern Dipper,
Sun and moon concealed within the sleeve.
The crimson countenance endures,
Though heaven collapses and earth crumbles,
The true nature remains unchanged.
Dancing in the sleeves of the robe,
The cosmos seems too narrow—
Yet with a sweep of the hand,
Heaven and earth are measured as level ground.
Drunken and carefree,
A sack holds the four seas,
Laughing and joyful,
The belly drinks three cups.
Several times at the Jasper Pool,
At the Dragon Flower Assembly,
Among the immortals’ precious feast,
Inebriated by the rosy goblet.
At the Jade Emperor’s imperial banquet,
The gathering is incomplete without me.
At the Double Yang Festival,
Seven golden lotuses bloom,
Radiating divine light.

**Eulogy:**
Pure and luminous, the bright and solitary moon,
Clear and resplendent, polished like a water-ground mirror.
Deep and verdant, the jade-green pool reflects its image,
Melodious and serene, a celestial immortal beyond the world.
Dripping and round, plucked from nothingness,
Vivid and free, set down in perfection.
Spinning and sparkling in the crystal dish,
A crimson glow—
A single expanse of blue heaven.

**Eulogy:**
Atop the Jade Capital Mountain, a pool of water,
Its depths unreachable from any of the four sides or eight directions.
If one recognizes the boatman,
Naturally, one sails into the celestial palace.

*Record of the Perfected Master Jin* concludes.
