**Fascicle One of the Collected Works of Tao the Recluse of Huayang**
*Compiled by Fu Xiao, Disciple of the Luminous Terrace*
*Collated by Chen Nan, Disciple of the Great Cavern*
*Preface by Jiang Zong*

Of old, Liu Xiang mastered the learning of past and present; Ma Rong beheld the books of all under heaven. Jing Fang discerned the omens of wind and rain; Pei Kai understood the safeguards of yin and yang. Yet Zizheng (Liu Xiang) was undone by oversimplification, and Jichang (Ma Rong) was ruined by arrogance and extravagance. The enlightened lord perished in an instant; Gongju (Pei Kai) barely escaped the ultimate punishment. Few have attained perfection in all things, and rare is the praise for one who sees virtue through to the end.

As for those of vast virtue and keen intellect—like the four disciplines of Confucius’ school—or those who delved deeply into the classics—like the six arts of Zheng’s lineage—Tao the Master of Danyang embodied them all. He possessed profound knowledge of the purple terraces and green bamboo slips, the cinnabar texts of the emerald ravines, the jade tablets of secret scriptures, and the wondrous scrolls of the jasper altars. Nothing escaped his mastery of their subtleties, nor did he fail to grasp their essential purport. Truly, he was an extraordinary figure of unparalleled talent, a rare man of his generation.

Yet his literary works had been lost, and no compilation existed. His disciples gathered what remained, as if encountering a text from Liaodong. Devoted scholars searched diligently, reciting from baskets of texts from Hexi. They entrusted the task of collation to brush and ink, sealing the collection in vermilion silk. It was stored in the Hongdu archives, with a copy preserved in the Yan Pavilion.

**Seeking the Mountains: Written at Fifteen**

Weary of how easily worldly passions sway, I took up my staff to seek the mountains. Following hidden paths to reach the peaks, I endured hardships and overcame obstacles. My wandering heart was not yet sated when evening fell at the roots of the clouds. Joyful to find one who attains his will, I forgot my form; having forgotten my form, my spirit abided.

Thereupon, I loosened my hair and untied my sash, circling the heights. My mind was vast, my gaze unburdened; my qi flowed freely, my spirit at ease. Though the mysterious is distant, it surely exists. No burden is too great to forget. The harm of the "wounded horse" dispelled, the blade of the "butcher" reigned supreme. The feelings of things and self, though equal, depend on self-cultivation—this is what I esteem.

As for those who seek fame on Western Marchmount or chase profit in Shuling, who prize the purity of Chu and Xiang or the pride of Wu and Jiang—who scorn death and value qi, holding name above life—such men stray from truth and obscure the Dao. I cannot approve. Those who don robes and wide sleeves, don caps and formal attire, who linger in courts and halls, strut through palaces and chambers—who serve a hundred kings of the Fu clan, leaving fragrant legacies—though they bear virtue and receive honor, I dare not commend them.

Thus, I shut the gates of Jingmen by day and open the thatched door by night. My chamber is overgrown with summer grasses; my path obscured by spring moss. The courtyard is empty, bathed in moonlight; the zither’s notes mingle with the wind’s lament. Evening crows nest under the eaves; twilight beasts vie to approach. At times, I wander near graves or seek distant valleys. Sitting upon flat stones, I gaze over the plains. The sun bears the mantis in shared seclusion; the moon parts the clouds to emerge from the mountains. The wind descends through pines, carrying melodies; springs cascade over rocks, forming patterns. Grasses sway, brushing dew; deer gather in rustling herds. I grasp trailing vines to enter the valley, skirting vast marshes to compare purity. The stone cliffs reflect true hues; I climb osmanthus branches to match their steadfastness. I gather orchids and wear sweet basil, awaiting the spring warbler’s first song. I harbor my thoughts in darkness, waiting for the kind breeze to unfold my emotions.

Then, yielding to my mood, I set forth, following the rocky path to wander afar. My thoughts drift with the pillars of heaven; faint joy arises, yet I seek nothing. Gazing at the winding river’s expanse, I am dazzled by the overlapping peaks. The sun slants through clouds, darkening their hue; the wind passes over water, leaving it serene. It brushes jagged cliffs, stirring whirlpools; where it meets open space, islands form. A lone stone soars, peerless; the bank hangs suspended, as if floating in the sky. Halfway through the green path, my soul wanders, carefree. I grasp the principles of Bohun’s sheer cliffs, ascending a thousand fathoms to rest my spirit.

Thereupon, I reach the sheer cliffs and arrive at Pine Gate. Behind lies the open forest; before me, the long source. To the right, mountains stretch endlessly; to the left, the sea rises to meet the heavens. Bamboos drip dew in orderly rows; willows sway gently, welcoming cicadas. Gulls fly in pairs to the water; egrets soar gracefully to the fields. They glide upon the waves, they wheel above the fields—this freedom and joy! Yet I lament that life is not long. I mourn the fleeting span of mushrooms, envy the enduring pine. Though the roc and the quail are different species, they each find their place in carefree wandering. I wish to spread my mat and pour out my grievances, to compose verses at dawn beneath the pines. Arriving at Red City, I rest awhile, meeting the Prince of the Waters to lodge for the night. Gazing up at Peng Juan, I know he is not far—surely long life may yet be attained.

Before the elm’s light fades, I will seek the mountains to gather lingzhi. I depart to gather lingzhi, entering the deep ravine; I explore its depths, where the path is secluded and winding. The winding path never brightens; the deep ravine never dawns. High pines halt the drifting clouds; low vines repeatedly confuse the crows. The crows, lost in the vines, flutter in disarray; the clouds, stilled upon the pines, threaten to scatter. The drifting clouds wander—where will they settle? The parted crows seek their flock. Alas, where is their flock? Where can they rest? My thoughts drift, unheard; my gaze is exhausted, yet no barrier remains.

After the Master’s passing, no one compiled his works. In the second year of Zhenming under Emperor Wu of Chen, the imperial decree appointed Minister Jiang Zong to assemble the collection. The Master had departed in the second year of Datong under the Liang; by then, fifty-three years had passed. Many writings had been scattered and lost.

I asked a fisherman about the way ahead, and he pointed me toward Penglai, saying: "If you truly possess the resolve to seek the mountains, I will lodge you in the Terrace of Immortal Summoning. Approach the Ying waters to unburden your heart, for myriad feelings will surely converge. Though a thousand thoughts may align, none can know where they ascend. Returning to formlessness in stillness, forever transcending the dust of the world."

**Rhapsody on the Water Immortal**

Vast and boundless, the eight seas surge; drifting and still, the nine rivers flow. Waves rise at the center of heaven; waters pour, dividing the earth. They coil around the sun’s cavern at Chang Sang, and to the west, they turn the dragon’s spade at the moon’s curve.

Thus it was: Tong Pass stood unblocked, Stone Gate lay open. The Yangtze was guided forth from the Han, the Ji floated into the Huai. The Zhang Canal’s water palace embraced the terraces of mountains and isles—where the radiant sisters E and Ying once wandered, where Qin Gao came and went with his zither. Some soared to the ends of the earth as roving roc, bathing the sun in Xianchi’s pool; others followed clouds to rinse in the golden nectar of the Fen, or chased the rosy dawn to pluck the fruit of the Jianmu Tree. They played with pearls in the courtyard of the Deep-Dweller, or rolled up their mirrors in the chamber of the Silk-Twister. This was true splendor.

Yet more wondrous still: where jade cliffs stood free of mist and emerald waters stirred not a ripple, flying carriages bore winged serpents and soaring phoenixes, while wandering plowsmen rode swans. They ascended to court in the Purple Palace, then returned to pay homage in the Azure Mansion. They advanced to wave banners before the Eight Elders, or turned to brush the robes of the Four Lads. They struck the sounding stone in the Cavern of Shade, or unfurled their pride in the Dark Garden. They poured the intoxicating wine of the Cinnabar Cave, or offered delicacies from the Qilin Isle. Master Anqi presented jujubes, the Queen Mother of the West proffered peaches. Brocade banners blazed in the sunlight, feathered robes brushed the clouds.

And when autumn waters rose to their height, towering waves crested like mountains, each patrolling its own domain, heeding the royal decree. They chose marvels from the treasury of the River Lord, drew treasures from the Black Dragon’s river. Night-glowing pearls lit the moon, great cowries filled the chariot shafts. This was true magnificence.

Consider then the layered towers of Jasper Mansion and the cloud-woven pavilions of Jade Terrace—where the Yellow Emperor once feasted the hundred spirits. Or the stone canopy of Mount Tu and the emerald curtains of the Heavenly Empress—where Yu the Great gathered his ministers. The Min Mountains coiled in intricate embrace, threading upward through the Well and Net constellations, their peaks draped in celestial brocade, girdled by the Jade Cord. They steeped scalding springs in the Cassia Isle, or churned boiling torrents in the Golden Mound. Sands collapsed, stones tumbled, swift rapids raced in foam. Sheer cliffs sent cascades flying, ten thousand fathoms of suspended torrents. They surged through the gates of Dawn’s Radiance, galloped beyond the Gourd’s Mouth.

Yet when the turning of the cosmic net reached its limit, when the nine and six cycles reversed, the Western Han devised its strategies, the Dragon Gate received its mandate. The Zhou of old met the Xia in their final union, the first gathering before the altar of Ma. The vast plains of Pingyin and Julu transformed twice into abysses; the clear waters of the Qing River and Bohai thrice became mulberry fields. Grasping the two poles of heaven and earth, one could only sigh in sorrow—one morning, a myriad ages flowed past in tears.

I have found peace in the toad’s shadow, no longer envying the crane’s years. All are but creatures beneath the pines—how could they compare to the immortals? Alas! Among all living things shaped by creation, none are more numinous than humankind. Why not follow in the footsteps of the Divine Sovereign, enter the wondrous gate as a guest of the Dao? To sink one’s form into endless night, to become dust with ants and mole-crickets—this is folly. Yet there are those of keen insight, heroes who walk alone: they seek the scholar of Meng Valley in his hidden vale, or pursue the currents of Lü Liang in the Stone City. They follow Wu Guang to the Pillar of Grinding Stone, or search for Long Wei in Dongting. They welcome the Nine Transcendents at the Golden Portal, or pay homage to the Three Pure Ones in the Jade Clarity. They renew heaven and earth to make them everlasting, and in the end, wander carefree in eternal life.

*Hymn of Huayang: The Pivot of the Realm*

The *Yellow River Scroll* bears witness to past records, while the *Annals of Confucius* illuminate ancient names. The celestial order shines resplendent, and the twin golden standards mark the earth’s heroes.

In essence, form and image dwell in the boundless—life arises from being, yet in being, it returns to emptiness. No craftsman is needed, for the hollow form achieves perfection on its own.

The bodily stations gather the spirits within the Three Palaces, dividing and harmonizing the Five Conveniences. They greet the wise of night and gaze at the morning essence suspended in dawn’s glow.

A standard pierces the southern peak, where the Mystic Tripod stands tall; the northern ridge stretches like Qin’s unbroken wall. Within and without, the Jade Sand Ford encircles hidden wheel-tracks. Distinctions are drawn:

To the left, the waters of Willow’s Judgment flow; to the right, the Yang Valley’s streams run deep. The earth cradles the somber hues of the north, while the well’s pure waters gush from Phoenix Gate Spring.

At the borders, Guo Gan’s poems linger on the banks, and Jiang Ba’s distant traces span the land. At the Crane Temple, echoes may sometimes be heard; in the separate abode, reverence is ever maintained.

Categories align: the dwellings of the heavens are not known to mortals, and the Yue clans do not conceal their migrations. Tree canopies cast fleeting shade, while the stone turtle has never known smoke.

The fruit groves flourish with lingering crabapples, and the vegetable gardens trail with forgotten mustard greens. Glowing mushrooms may light the night, while field springs ever moisten the dust.

Visitors descend their reins at Tortoise Mountain, and the Azure Radiance Youths unhitch their chariots. They repose in the Lodge of the True, or gather in the Palace of Leisurely Ease.

The talented and wise take flight, their feathered companions alighting; long whistles summon returning clouds. The zither’s strings play untethered melodies, and empty discourse finds no one to engage.

Scholarship is endowed: dwellings stand beneath the level thunder, and stillness abides in the shade of stone. The Way is already embraced with serene intent, and soaring blossoms fill the heart’s flight.

The work of destiny: the spirit’s crossing is assured, and departure or stay follows what is fitting. What need is there for display? The hidden path knows its own.

Those who forge bonds roam the jeweled blade’s edge, or dwell in seclusion at Huayang. Should it chance to resemble the Seven Origins, they will be upheld.

The appointed time nears its fulfillment, and the cycle of *hai* has not yet reached its *ding*. Inheriting the Tang’s legacy, they shall attend the sacred court as guests.

The pledge is carved upon the dark window, and sincerity is revealed at the winding steps’ gate. One looks back with care, lest the grace of recommendation be betrayed.

*Ten Responsibilities of the Hidden Retreat*
The Master of the Hidden Retreat, entrusting the general affairs to his disciple Dai Tan, mounts his steed and takes up the tablet to confer upon his former disciple, Lu Jingyou of Wu Commandery, the governance of Lian Stone Village as a dwelling for the reclusive scholar.

The *Admonitory Text* states:
"Oh, you, Jingyou—once I loosed the imperial sash at the palace gates and attended the mat of the questioning hall..."

Though the world’s paths blur with dust, your heart marks a realm of transcendence. The vision of the Mushroom Fields lingers, unbroken through dawn and dusk. The aspiration of the Hao and Ying rivers deepens with the passing years. Supreme virtue draws neighbors near, as clouds and winds converge in meeting.

Since your arrival, two springs have turned. Then, you doffed your sash at the azure steps and hung your cap at the vermilion gate; hand in hand, we hastened to establish a dwelling upon this ridge. Channels were carved to guide the waters, and stones were shifted to lay the foundation. You scaled cliffs to fell timber, crossed ridges to gather herbs. Your sinews were spent in climbing and building, your dark blood exhausted in haste and labor. Your flesh withered, yet you did not deem exposure a hardship; your spirit stood hollow, yet you heeded not hunger or cold. When the thatched hut stood complete, you endured frost and heat alike. For seven years, the work began and now reaches its end. Today’s peace is your labor’s fruit.

The noble man does not dwell alone in glory; the humane must share prosperity with all things. Thus, I grant you this village—everlasting Albei Slope. Here, the land of Mount Jin and Lian Stone spans seventy paces, with the ravine’s waters adjoining. May your fine deeds flourish. Forever be a guest of honor in Huayang.

To this, govern well.
*(First of the Ten Responsibilities)*

You, whose nature is devoted and sincere, whose disposition is serene and indifferent. Uprightness is your foundation, steadfastness your resolve. You seek not worldly talent, nor do you lower yourself to common company. Cunning schemes and deceitful plots are not what you desire.

Thus, I now charge you to be a Recluse of Tranquil Abode. This may be called establishing a title by virtue, perfectly fulfilling this excellence.
*(Second of the Ten Responsibilities)*

You laid the foundations, framed the halls, and secured the boundaries. The main hall and altars are vast and open, the paths to the hermitage clear and solemn. For official and private travel alike, there are places to rest. In the labor of construction and repair, none was not your effort.

Thus, I now grant you Four Thunderbolt Flying Pavilions, with side galleries and flanking chambers. Here, you may dwell in peace and quietude, manifesting distant blessings.
*(Third of the Ten Responsibilities)*

You serve your superiors with diligence and treat your subordinates with kindness. You have experienced the hardships of farming and the toils of labor. The proper cultivation of crops and the weaving of cloth have ensured ample provisions. Your hands and feet are calloused, yet you have not sought rest. You endure wind and rain, ever pressing on.

Thus, I now grant you a servant, named Duo Yiyi? Here, you may pass down the tasks of firewood and water, easing your toil.
*(Fourth of the Ten Responsibilities)*

Your clan upholds old traditions, and you yourself bear the state’s esteem. Though the Dao is one and unchanging, duties and expectations must be distinguished.

Thus, I now grant you an iron-and-copper *ruyi*. With it, you may command and respond to guests and officials, establishing your name in affairs.
*(Fifth of the Ten Responsibilities)*

You revere teaching and goodness, adhering to the law without bias. Your vessels and robes serve their purpose, entrusted to practice and refinement.

Thus, I now grant you a bamboo staff tipped with tin. With it, you may shake the Three Realms, and the spirits will tremble at its sound.
*(Sixth of the Ten Responsibilities)*

You aspire to profound sincerity, your distant thoughts attuned to the numinous wind. Where your heart directs, the mind follows and connects.

Thus, I now grant you two incense burners, accompanied by frankincense. With them, you may send purple smoke curling to the celestial halls, summoning the attention of the divine.
*(Seventh of the Ten Responsibilities)*

You purify your form and keep your storehouse clean, having set aside rich foods. You proclaim the Dao with pine and cypress, relying on fragrant vinegar.

Thus, I now grant you a set of cups and plates. With them, you may hold osmanthus wine in the evening and receive chrysanthemum dew at dawn.
*(Eighth of the Ten Responsibilities)*

You revere the classics and scriptures, following models and exemplars. The use of brush and ink lies herein.

Thus, I now grant you a large inkstone, with paper and brushes to accompany it. With them, you may compose texts, transcribe words, and receive truths face-to-face.
*(Ninth of the Ten Responsibilities)*

Your true heart is inwardly steadfast, your pure conduct outwardly manifest. You cleanse and sweep away defilement, your inner and outer bearing as pristine as snow and frost.

Thus, I now grant you a snail-shell washing basin, with a hand towel to accompany it. With them, you may enter the hall for morning rites and exit for ablutions.
*(Tenth of the Ten Responsibilities)*

Now, I grant you these ten things, each aligned with the precedents of history. You may respond with praise and follow these words to govern. Let there be no arrogance or indolence, lest you fall short of this intent.

Taking up my brush to express my thoughts, I dare address you, Recluse.

**Edict Asking What the Mountains Hold**
*Poem in Reply*

What does the mountain hold?
On its ridges, many white clouds.
They bring joy only to oneself—
Not fit to be plucked and sent to you.

**Inscribed on the Wall of My Dwelling**

Yifu was carefree and unrestrained,
Pingshu sat and spoke of emptiness.
Never mentioning the Zhaoyang Palace,
Suddenly it became the Xiongnu’s court.

**Sorrow on a Cold Night**

Night clouds arise, night geese take fright.
Their mournful cries pierce the night’s sorrow.
The empty mountains fill with frost, high mist levels the plain.
Lead-white glow sinks beneath the bed-curtain,
A lone light—cold moon faint.
The cold wind tightens, sorrowful heart breaks.
Tears of grief spent, yet feeling remains.
Who can bear this resentment?
Thoughts arise—who could endure?

**Ballad of the Hu Pipe**

From self-willed flight through the heavens,
To the clamor of gain and loss—
A hundred years, four or five dynasties,
Yet in the end, it is the Lord of Jiachen.

**Emperor Wu of Liang’s Discourse on Calligraphy**

By imperial decree, the officials of the Central Secretariat were reviewed, and only Zhou Xizanfu was found capable. With a heart as deep as the *Hanxin*’s, he awaits the *Jiazhong* note to exhale his breath.

Now, having mastered the subtleties of the upper form and perfected the principles of the lower, his skill is such that I have often compared Zhong [You] and Wang [Xizhi] to the world, advancing their art ever further. What grieves me is my own dullness, unable to fathom their heights, and I can only sigh in admiration.

Previously, I received three sheets of divine calligraphy, and now, with these, five in total. Not only does each character seize the eye, but every stroke pierces the heart. Day by day, their strength and grace grow, becoming ever more unmatched. To repay the past years, they are no longer of the same kind. This alone suffices—what need is there to seek further among Zhong and Wang?

My heart has always revered the present. My admiration and devotion deepen, my joy and delight overflow, and I cannot but share this.

Again, I was bestowed two scrolls. Upon examining the inscribed titles, all were as Your Majesty’s edict had described. Since they were not openly bestowed, I could only keep them briefly, unable to retain them long. I have already traced one section, but as it is unfinished, I did not send it with this message. The paper scrolls have been used before, and much else is mixed in, leaving nothing further to take. I also request to wait until all is complete before returning them.

Moreover, these writings are in the style of literary pieces. I am now unskilled and must practice further. I only wish for fine calligraphy, like the *Yue Yi Lun* or *Tai Shi Zhen*, to be imitated in copying sutras, preserving the essentials for eternal transmission.

**Emperor Wu of Liang’s Reply**

The two scrolls I wished to keep a little longer, but it makes no great difference. The paper scrolls are from a book’s binding, and since you needed to see the originals, I sent them. There is nothing particularly worth taking, but I have included them here, and I will need finer calligraphy later.

As for examples like the *Lun* and *Zhen*, Wang Xizhi’s recent works are not extremely fine, and the *Yue Yi Lun* is somewhat robust and vigorous—perhaps not a true trace. The *Tai Shi Zhen* is slightly more refined and charming, but the brushwork is too delicate, and the style deviates. Both have already been examined by Your Majesty, and beyond these, there is nothing else to send.

As for the *Yue Yi Lun*, my own heart has long suspected it to be a tracing, yet I dared not speak lightly of it. Now that Your Majesty’s decree confirms it is not genuine, I privately trust that my discernment has not been far off.

Regarding the *Zhen* and *Yin*: praise that exceeds is as weak as drowning, yet your quiet and pure grace has granted me eternal provision. I am deeply moved by your compassion and reward, beyond words to express. Though this writing does not follow the standard examples, its practical use and principle are the same.

You have inquired about fine regular script, and I have prepared two additional scrolls. Earlier, in the capital, I obtained a scroll of *feibai* calligraphy, said to be one of Wang Xizhi’s finest works. I have never seen another to compare, so I cannot verify it, but its vigor and force are astonishing. I humbly present it here. Though it may not serve your purpose, if it might fill a gap in your collection, I would be honored to offer it to Your Majesty.

In the past, I saw a catalog of Wang Xizhi’s standard script at Ma Cheng’s residence. Ma said that among Wang’s works—such as his calligraphy for the *Luoshen Fu* and over ten other pieces—all were in the modern style, except for two scrolls of the *Jijiu Pian*, which retained the ancient method, tight and fine yet nearly unrestrained. I recall his words, but those works are now scattered and no longer extant. Ma also said that the notes and colophons attached to scrolls were all imitations meant for reprimanding the various princes and court officials.

Recently, I saw the first three scrolls of a set of letters, which I believe have long been separated. I dared not presume to discuss their authenticity, but I hoped that among these three scrolls, one or two might follow the example of attached colophons. Your Majesty’s decree then unexpectedly granted me the first scroll, and my heart trembles with awe. When I first saw the scroll’s title, which mentioned twenty-three or twenty-four, I rejoiced at its abundance. Now, your gift has reached two hundred and seventy—my astonishment knows no end.

The imperial treasury is vast as the sea, not to be drawn from with a single bottle. Measuring my own use, I have already received more than enough, both before and after. These five scrolls, great and small, far exceed the humble station of one such as I. Without your extraordinary grace, how could I have dared to hope for such favor?

By nature, I have always been broadly learned but never precise. Once, troubled by the lack of books to read, I wished to become a scribe. Later, enamored with clerical script, I envied those who held office as keepers of records. I have often said that within the span of a human life, one’s understanding cannot encompass all things. The world is vast, yet men are confined to indulging their five desires—truly, this is a cause for shame and regret. Even if I were to become a ghost of talent, I would still be but a dull immortal. This remains true to this day.

At first, I intended to turn inward after the *Wuyi* year, but with state affairs so pressing and my heart heavy with silence, I dared not trouble you further with idle matters. Yet in addressing these affairs, I have already become burdensome and presumptuous. I humbly pray that Your Majesty’s sagely compassion will overlook my faults.

---

I have also reviewed your separate letter, which states that such matters should be subtly appreciated. Since this is a worthy endeavor, though it lies outside my usual practice, I venture to offer a few rough observations.

When the brush is held slanting, the strokes lack sharpness; when the grip is too loose, the writing becomes weak. Short dots and lifts make the characters swollen, while long ones cause them to drift apart. Hasty strokes make the characters wide; sparse strokes make them sluggish. Constraint lacks vigor, while abandon lacks restraint. Pure bone lacks charm; pure flesh lacks strength. Too little ink makes the writing float and rough; too much makes it clumsy and dull. All these are common faults, and where the brush naturally leads, so follows the principle of nature.

If the brush’s rise and fall are well-placed, its movements unobstructed, the strokes connected yet distinct, the momentum like a towering peak, the waves and turns measured by the compass and square, the thickness and thinness balanced, the plump and lean harmonized, the bone and force well-matched—then the writing will be graceful and warm, pleasing to the eye, yet sharp and imposing, full of vitality. When it delights both sight and mind, it may be counted among the finest. Though one may recognize the styles of many masters, one must still master their connections.

Even if the Six Scripts are skillfully executed, mastery still comes only through practice.

One may hold fast upon a single hearing, or recall upon a single glance. From ancient times to the present, such persons are not without precedent. Yet in the final analysis, all mastery comes down to practice. Cheng Miao could transform script because the forms had grown old; Zhang Zhi could excel in calligraphy because of accumulated skill in study. Only when the old is thoroughly known and the accumulation complete may one freely discourse.

In my youth, I never once completed a full cycle of sixty years, nor did I exhaust the reams of paper—yet now in old age, what more can be said? It would only invite ridicule from contemporaries and derision from later generations. Thus, I have made bold to speak with unrivaled confidence. Upon reading such claims, one’s back grows hot and the true self is obscured—here, the true is indeed burdened. This is merely mastery of a single art, not what I deem a triumphant endeavor. It is but dust upon the heart’s Dao, not what I call desirelessness.

Moreover, in the *Treatise on Calligraphy* presented to Emperor Wu of Liang, there is a miscellaneous section in the first volume. I have carefully annotated and appended it separately, though I fear it may not fully accord with my humble intent. Along with my own copies, I submit them together for consideration. For over ten days now, my thoughts have been fraught with apprehension, leaving no peace in any matter. The delay has grown prolonged, and further postponement is unwarranted. The remaining entries are of no use, save for two pieces by Ji Kang and his peers, which follow the structural conventions of classical texts—though I regret they are not as refined as Guo Pu’s works.

Upon reviewing the volume’s contents, the number of entries is not insignificant. The original directive mentioned only four volumes, but this appears to be a compilation from the Yuanjia era of the Liu-Song, with many later additions and losses. Of Wang Xizhi’s renowned works, only a few survive—*Huangting Jing*, *Exhortation to Ascend the Throne*, *Portrait Eulogies*, and *The Goddess of the Luo River*—I am uncertain whether any others remain.

The twenty-third volume now contains twelve entries on separate sheets. Of these, only eight are attributed to Wang Xizhi. The *Yue Yi Lun* in cursive script is exceedingly vigorous and sharp, though not overly deliberate, hence some characters are flawed. The *Grand Preceptor’s Admonition* and *Ode to the Great Elegance* are meticulously composed, yet somewhat constrained. These are fine examples of fan inscriptions and screen calligraphy. The remaining five pieces offer little of note. Minister Tao’s single sheet is not bad, though it is not Wang Xizhi’s work, nor is its author known—it appears to be a tracing. The two sheets by the Gentleman of the Yellow Gate and the single sheet of *Zhi Lian Li* are by Wang Xianzhi, also likely tracings. The *Prescription for Treating Malaria with Foxglove Root* is likewise by Wang Xianzhi, another tracing.

The four items above are not Wang Xizhi’s works.

The twenty-fourth volume now contains twenty-one entries. Of these, only eleven are attributed to Wang Xizhi. None are particularly close to his style, and many are careless tracings, making further detailed assessment difficult. The first sheet, dated the third year of Huangchu, is a later imitation of Wang Xizhi’s work. The *Miao Xi Epitaph* is by Master Xu. The *Embracing Sorrow and Grief* is by Zhang Cheng. The sheet dated the eleventh day of the fifth month is a tracing of Wang Huan’s *Letter of Reprimand*. The *Longing for the Recluses of Huang and Qi* and the *Entangled Thoughts* are both later imitations, clumsy and crude. One sheet remains unexamined—it is by Wang Xianzhi.

The *"Conveniently Changed Month"* sheet is by Zhang Yi. The *"Fifteenth Day of the Fifth Month County Notice"* sheet is also by Wang Min. The *"Prescription for Treating Drinking"* sheet is by Xie An. The above ten entries are not Wang Xizhi’s works. Fearing that they may not have been properly distinguished, I now respectfully present the calligraphy of Master Xu and Ren Jing. By comparing them separately, one may discern the styles of Wang Min, Zhang Cheng, Xie An, and Zhang Yi, which are suitable for official use.

**Emperor Wu of Liang’s Response to the Recluse’s Letter**
Having reviewed the distinctions among the various calligraphic works, I find your discernment truly refined. However, the differences and similarities, as well as their merits, remain unclear to me.

The two sheets of *Attending Secretary and Yellow Gate* are by Ren Jing. Observing the characters in the submitted Jing works, they appear closely aligned. The recent two sheets of Jing’s calligraphy display a mixed and facile style, which cannot be Jing’s true hand. One must further assess them by examining brushstrokes, wave-like flourishes, and the essence of various masters. This is not something to be hastily executed on paper; for now, I shall maintain restraint and adhere to moderation.

The traced works of Xu and Ren are all returned.

**Further Letter from Emperor Wu of Liang on Calligraphy**
Upon reviewing your previous letter, though brief, its principles are comprehensive. Even with fewer than two hundred characters, it contains ample praise and critique, succinctly encapsulating all. Your written sentiments are profoundly moving, such that even the aged bones of Zhong [Yao] would be honored anew, and the delicate frame of [Wang] Xianzhi would rise from the netherworld. Only [Wang] Xizhi’s reputation can be justly elevated or diminished by such inquiry, revealing the jade-like standards with clarity. Without the sagely discernment of graded evaluation, I fear the trend of blindly following recent fashions will lead to eternal confusion.

Since [Zhang] Zhi is hailed as the sage of cursive script and Zhong [Yao] himself perfected clerical script, your argument aligns with divine insight, a rarity unmatched across the ages. With this principle now clear, those who vainly attempt to mimic the tiger’s form should promptly abandon their brushes, return to antiquity, and embrace authenticity, thereby advancing this flourishing era. Though my humble opinion has been heard, my admiration knows no bounds.

In recent times, all have revered [Wang] Xianzhi. By the end of the Qi dynasty, his fame and substance had spread throughout the realm. Not only was Zhong [Yao] no longer acknowledged, but even [Wang] Xizhi was similarly neglected. This is not a matter of mere rejection but of the natural fading of influence, limited to a few lineages.

Upon receiving your treatise, I was so overjoyed that I danced and leapt, yet this scarcely expresses my elation. I wish to privately share the traced works with Hongyuan and Sikuang—both are men of equal discernment—who will surely praise and celebrate them, gaining more than half their benefit.

Though I do not know Hongyuan personally, I have corresponded with his nephew Xu through scholarly exchanges, and thus we have met in this way. However, since I am in the palace, I fear he may have already heard of the traced works. The selected characters vary in size and cannot be harmoniously adjusted. Guo’s examination suggests they may still be acceptable, though the brushwork differs significantly. Since this work will be transmitted for a thousand generations, its traces should be made to follow accordingly.

In my declining years, I have received three sheets from you. Upon carefully examining the characters, I find them robust and meticulous. I surmise that once words express intent, the intent aligns with the words. As the mind guides the intent and the hand unites with the brush, the result is even more worthy of praise. My humble heart trembles with reverence, and my cherished admiration grows ever deeper.

The prevailing opinion holds that no traces of Zhong [Yao] remain east of the Yangtze, a matter of constant lament. I have long hoped for the restoration of the Central Plains to access the *Taiqiu Stele* for tracing. Your treatise mentions that while authentic works are scarce, they can still be inferred, suggesting some survive. I wonder how many characters remain. Since I cannot personally inspect them, I wish to have a skilled artisan trace and fill in several lines. If I am granted this, it would be an extraordinary blessing.

Moreover, [Wang] Xizhi’s studies of Zhong [Yao] exhibit ingenious structure and meticulous form, surpassing his own spontaneous works. I wonder how many such examples exist. If you could provide the *Huangting Jing*, *Xiang Zan*, and other texts, along with his self-composed works, I would no longer seek them. Instead, I request the finest of his studies of Zhong [Yao], in profound gratitude for your exceptional favor.

**Emperor Wu of Liang’s Reply**
There is indeed one scroll of Zhong [Yao]’s calligraphy, traditionally regarded as authentic. However, I believe it is entirely traced, and most are unworthy of discussion. Only two or three lines appear to be traced, faintly capturing Zhong’s style.

[Wang] Xizhi’s studies of Zhong [Yao] that can be verified number around twenty. Beyond these, the smaller characters with shorter strokes mostly follow Zhong’s method. I intend to have them copied and mounted, but it is not yet convenient to send them. Next month, when the task is complete, I will dispatch them.

**On Calligraphic Rivalry**
Before [Wang] Xizhi’s time in Wuxing, his calligraphy was not yet fully refined. All his finest works date from his tenure in Kuaiji, roughly the decade of the Yonghe era. After resigning his post and mourning his father, he no longer served in office and scarcely wrote himself, entrusting all to a single individual whose work remains unseen in the world. The relaxed and distinctive pieces are mistakenly called his late works.

After [Wang] Xizhi’s death, [Wang] Xianzhi, at seventeen or eighteen, fully imitated this person’s calligraphy, thus achieving a resemblance. Now, by Your Majesty’s decree, this distinction is made clear, sparing [Wang] Xizhi the criticism of having no late works.

Upon reflection, I recently encountered someone who studied Yan [Zhenqing]’s calligraphy so closely that it became indistinguishable. In my own traced copies, though the character forms resemble hawks, the brushwork and energy are lost. I wonder if among the previous scrolls, one or two meticulously executed pieces might be included in the mounting process. If you deign to grant this, I will inquire again by year’s end. Otherwise, I dare not presume upon your generosity.

**Response to Court Gentlemen on the Differences Between Daoist Immortality and Buddhist Dharma**

Initially, a court gentleman of Liang inquired: "I have privately studied Daoist texts on immortality and often find myself sighing in admiration, forgetting weariness. Yet I admire only their language, not their meaning. Considering that the seven-foot body shares the same origin in the Great Beginning and partakes of the Five Constants, why is it that only immortals ascend to the azure clouds while others decay like metal and stone? You preside over the Gate of the Mysterious Dao and have mastered the teachings of the Immortal Gardens. There must be a way to exhaust this profound question. I humbly request a brief explanation."

The Recluse replied: "Your inquiry is most excellent, though it surpasses my humble ability to expound. Nevertheless, I shall attempt to explain: If one merely compares the bamboo and paulownia to the willow, their natures differ inherently. This is not the subject of today’s discussion."

If one draws an analogy to the kitchen knife and boiling grain, tracing their functions to cultivation and irrigation, this merely addresses their origins, not the eternal and unchanging essence. Those who attain immortality are fundamentally different. Even within this category, there exist several types; for now, let us discuss their true nature.

All forms, whether material or spiritual, arise from the union of form and spirit. When form and spirit are conjoined, one is human or being; when they separate, one becomes spirit or ghost. That which is neither separated nor conjoined falls under Buddhist dharma, while that which is both separated and conjoined pertains to the Dao of immortality.

Now, how does one achieve this immortality? It is a matter of refinement, a thorough comprehension of the principles of transformation. When clay is shaped upon the wheel into a vessel, it becomes earth yet differs from earth. Though dry but unburnt, it crumbles when wet; though fired but not fully matured, it remains fragile. Only when fire and force are sufficient does its surface and interior become firm. Rivers and mountains may vanish, yet this form remains indestructible.

Suppose one seeks immortality: with medicinal stones, one refines the form; with essence and spirit, one purifies the soul; with harmonious qi, one washes the substance; with virtuous power, one unbinds its fetters. When all methods converge without obstruction, one may unite to ride clouds and mount dragons, or separate to undergo liberation through apparent death and transformation. Neither united nor separated, one may exist or vanish at will. Thus, each follows their karmic path, cultivating the Dao and advancing in study, gradually ascending without limit until the teachings’ work is complete—yet this differs from the ultimate quiescence of extinction.

*Preface to the "Secret Essentials of Ascending to Perfection"*
Formerly, while among people, I had already compiled and edited two volumes on the practices of the true scriptures, which I then deemed thorough. Recently, dwelling in seclusion and embracing tranquility, I have attained greater reverence and purity. Testing these methods, I found them still lacking. Now, after repeated reflection and refinement, I have achieved coherence within and without, elucidating the principles of true study so that all becomes clear and unimpeded. Every word and phrase carries its purpose: some expound the transition from being to non-being, some reveal the hidden through the manifest, some deduce the origin from its mechanism, some clarify this by referencing that. Without prior immersion in scriptures and precise engagement with Daoist techniques, a cursory reading would be like gazing at the sea. Only through meticulous inquiry into its intricacies can one truly comprehend its essence.

Thus, the Dao is complete in seven chapters, its meaning aligned with the highest rank. I have often heard the ancient saying: "Not knowing is difficult, but acting upon knowledge is the true challenge." It is not learning that is difficult, but understanding the learning. I have repeatedly observed those who obtain two or three scrolls, or five or six methods, believing the principle exhausted on paper, then retreat to the mountains to practice, only to grow more confused with time. These have not even entered the gate, let alone approached the inner sanctum. If questioned on specifics, they are at a loss, claiming the scriptures say no more than this and that they merely follow faithfully. Yet I have endeavored to initiate inquiry, to guide and illuminate the path. If one encounters a person of wisdom and humility, they may be moved to seek understanding and discern right from wrong. But those who are foolish and obstinate will dismiss it outright, asking, "Why debate differences or critique sacred texts?" Some cling to their own views, while others claim adherence to ancient methods, refusing to engage in discussion or debate. Such cases are not few, and it is truly lamentable.

The term *jing* (scripture) signifies a path—a constant, unobstructed way. Just as cloth requires both warp and weft to be woven into fabric, if the mechanism is flawed or the shuttle misaligned, how can a coherent pattern emerge? The Perfected Ones established symbols and imparted teachings not for the uninitiated but for those capable of instruction. They often marked the broad avenues while omitting the winding paths, trusting that those with discernment would infer the rest. Even the Five Classics, the philosophers, histories, rhapsodies, and odes—despite generations of commentary—remain debated. How much more so for the profound and wondrous secrets of the esoteric Dao, the extraordinary texts of the transcendent realm? Should one not delve into their hidden depths, exhausting thought and plumbing the obscure?

Having composed this rough draft, I laid down my brush and sighed: "If Yuanxuan Ping were here, he would understand the principles I have grasped, which nearly traverse the boundary between heaven and humanity. With whom else could I discuss this?" I shall entrust it to the mysterious convergence.

*Preface to the "Compendium of Medicinal Essentials"*
In high antiquity, the Divine Farmer composed the *Materia Medica*, recording three hundred sixty-five substances to correspond with the days of the year. Each day brought forth one herb, each herb governed one ailment, aligning above with celestial patterns, in the middle with human affairs, and below with earthly principles. Harmonizing the five flavors, he crafted decoctions and elixirs to prepare for the four seasons’ changes. This was to establish the root so that the Dao might flourish. In that era, human hearts were simple and desires few. Even minor illnesses were cured with perfect efficacy.

Since then, the world has grown artificial and emotions shallow; cunning and anxiety have multiplied, desires know no bounds, and worries never cease. Thus, pathogenic qi frequently invades, and illnesses grow more severe and painful. Though potent medicines are administered, they fail to cure. Later, Lord Leigong and others expanded the *Materia Medica* and the *Pairs of Medicinals*, broadening their therapeutic applications and multiplying their categories.

As the world changes and emotions shift, illnesses deepen. Some preemptively prescribe medicines for diseases not yet present, while others use a single herb or a hundred together to cure one ailment—all to expel evil and restore balance, addressing root causes and preventing harm. Yet the three schools’ listed diseases vary in scope: some substances differ but share names, others are identical but named differently; some are cold where they should be hot, or bitter where they should be sweet; their harvesting methods and origins diverge. Such discrepancies make it nearly impossible to rely on them.

In the time of the Divine Farmer, there was no writing. Only with the Yellow Emperor did records begin. Thus, the *Divine Farmer’s Materia Medica* was categorized into four classics and three schools, with successive additions and omissions—was this not a matter of adapting to the times, taking different paths to the same destination?

However, the *Materia Medica* has endured through countless ages. Without masters to transmit it or scholars to annotate and copy it, errors have accumulated, characters and meanings have been lost, and no one has corrected them.

The efficacy of formulas lies in their application and harmonious blending.

*Preface to the One Hundred and One Formulas of the Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergencies*
In the year *gengchen* of the Great Era, the Recluse says: I have dwelt in secluded mountains for nearly a decade. Though I have often cultivated virtue and performed deeds of merit, most have been but temporary measures—nothing that might transmit fragrance to distant descendants! Yet nothing surpasses the act of composition. I have seen Ge Hong’s *Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergencies*, which amply fulfills the aspiration to illuminate even a single corner.

Of all the great afflictions of human life, none is more urgent than illness. To suffer illness without treatment is like fighting fire without water. Those in the imperial entourage may easily find physicians and remedies, but beyond the city walls, they are already difficult to come by. How much more so in remote villages, distant wilderness, deep mountains, or isolated shores—where untimely deaths abound, their number beyond reckoning!

Medical texts abound in volumes, yet their profusion brings little relief. To consult them is to be led astray by confusion. This work of Ge Hong’s is truly of profound benefit, yet it remains incomplete, its excellence not yet fully realized. Thus, I have gathered and supplemented it with one hundred and one additional formulas, distinguishing them in vermilion script as *One Hundred and One Formulas of the Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergencies*. For miscellaneous ailments and simple treatments, this compilation now suffices for most needs.

In ancient times, Ying Qu composed his *One Hundred and One Poems* to admonish conduct and refine the heart. My compilation here serves to safeguard and support my own person. Moreover, as the Buddhist scriptures say: "Humans, composed of the Four Great Elements, form a single body, which may suffer one hundred and one illnesses." Therefore, it is deeply fitting to reflect on this. From the most learned scholars to the common people, none should fail to copy and study it.

Beyond this compilation, I have also composed five additional volumes of *Proven Formulas*, further discussing the symptoms of various diseases and the adaptive use of medicines—all of which are highly effective treatments, not merely resources for those in seclusion. Even those in grand halls or noble chambers would do well to examine and take heed.

Ge Hong’s preface states: "This may be applied in poor households and rustic dwellings." Yet its use is not so limited. Now, if gentlemen of the gentry enjoy leisure and ease, they may peruse these medical texts. But if they are dispatched to distant posts, entrusted with official duties, or stationed in guarded palaces where dawn and dusk are cut off, or bound by military service behind fortified walls—then let them too find value in these pages.

When suddenly stricken by illness, one can only clasp hands in helplessness—how much better to delve into one’s satchel, where ready remedies may be found to forge a physician from even the most unskilled. Thus, I have exhaustively discussed symptoms to ensure clarity and prevent confusion. With but a glance at the headings, one may avoid misdiagnosis.

*Preface to the Materia Medica*
Dwelling in reclusion among the peaks and crags of Mount Mao, I turned in my moments of leisure from breath cultivation to the study of arts and techniques. Surveying the properties of herbs in the *Materia Medica*, I saw therein the fullness of the sage’s intent and so composed this discourse. The old accounts all attribute the *Divine Farmer’s Classic* to Shennong, and I affirm their truth.

When the Divine Farmer ruled all under Heaven, he drew the Eight Trigrams to bridge the minds of spirits and men, devised plowing and planting to spare the harm of slaughter, and proclaimed medicines to heal the sick and rescue lives cut short—these three Ways have endured through the ages, growing ever more luminous. King Wen and Confucius expounded the *Changes*, subtly illuminating the realms of heaven and humanity. Hou Ji and Yi Yin sowed the hundred grains, their bounty showering all living things. Qi Bo, Huangdi, Peng Zu, and Bian Que spread their teachings, their grace flowing through all that breathes, preserving the lives of three thousand people in every generation—we rely upon them still.

Yet before the Yellow Emperor’s time, written records did not survive. The Six Lines pointed the way, and the images of tilling and sowing arose from immediate practice. As for the governing properties of medicines, how could they be transmitted save through direct recognition passed down in unbroken succession? Only with Tongjun and Leigong were these teachings first inscribed on bamboo slips. This work should rank alongside the *Plain Questions*, though later hands have often embellished it. The First Emperor’s burning of medical formulas, divination texts, and arts of prognostication spared it, and so its complete record endured. But when the Han court fled and the Jin rulers fled in turn, texts were scattered and burned—scarcely one in a thousand survived.

Here now survive these four scrolls, being the original canon. The commanderies and counties named therein follow the system of the Later Han, and were likely recorded by [Zhang] Zhongjing, [Hua] Yuanhua, and others. It is also said there exists the *Tongjun’s Record of Gathered Medicines*, which in four scrolls describes the flowers, leaves, forms, and colors of herbs, and discusses their paired applications and mutual necessity. From the Wei and Jin onward, Wu Pu, Li Dangzhi, and others repeatedly revised and expanded it—sometimes to five hundred ninety-five entries, sometimes to four hundred forty-one, or three hundred nineteen. At times the Three Grades were jumbled together, with cold and heat properties confused, plants and minerals undifferentiated, insects and beasts unclassified. Moreover, their indicated treatments often proved inconsistent, and physicians, unable to examine all texts, varied in discernment and depth of understanding.

Here I have gathered and synthesized the various canons, refining and condensing their complexities. Taking the *Shennong’s Materia Medica*’s Three Grades—three hundred sixty-five entries—as the foundation, I have added a supplementary grade of three hundred sixty-five from the *Famous Physicians’ Formulas*, totaling seven hundred thirty kinds. All essentials have been carefully selected, with nothing omitted, and arranged by categories and classes. I have further annotated their seasonal uses, places of origin, and the requirements of Daoist scriptures and arts, compiling this preface and catalogue into seven scrolls. Though this work may not rival the excellence of earlier masters, it stands as one school’s systematic effort.

After my passing, may it be bequeathed to those of kindred understanding.

*Inscription on the Altar Stele of the Former Residence of Director Xu*

Vast and boundless—such is the numinous essence of the cosmos. It transcends all expression in words or images, all records in written traces. Yet if left unspoken, how shall later generations come to know it?

It embraces and exhales the myriad existences, nurturing the growth of grasses and trees. Its origins lie in profound obscurity, its meaning归于冥昧. As for the division of forms and realms, the distinct natures and functions of things—these may be discussed where matters are bounded by observation and hearing, where principles are exhausted by calculation and knowledge.

Why are mountains so lofty, seas so vast? Because they possess the capacity to contain. Within the great heavens lie thirty-six lesser heavens, all expanding to dwell within the emptiness of earth. They span the veins of flowing waters, open the gates of wind-swept peaks, and connect the qi of clouds and mists.

This mountain was originally called Mount Gouqu. Beneath it lies the Eighth Cavern Palace, known as the Heaven of Jintan Huayang. Its circumference measures one hundred fifty *li*, divided into three administrative precincts. During the reign of Emperor Yuan of the Former Han, the Three Mao Lords of Xianyang attained the Dao and came to govern this domain—hence its name, Mount Mao. The full account is detailed in the biographical records.

In the first year of the Taihe era of the Jin dynasty, Director Xu of Jurong established his residence here, and its traces remain to this day. At the beginning of the Song dynasty, Prince Jing of Changsha built a Daoist abbey at the eastern edge of this site. In the thirteenth year of the Tianjian era of the Liang dynasty, the abbey was repurposed into the Zhuyang Lodge, fulfilling distant omens foretold in earlier prophecies. Later, a fire ravaged the lodge, and a new hermitage was constructed to the west for habitation. In the fourteenth year, the Yugang Study Hall was built separately, emulating the traces of the Mystic Continent. By the seventeenth year, the altar stele was repaired and inscribed, reverently recording the true principles.

The Perfected One bore the surname Xu, with the personal name Mi, courtesy name Sixuan, and given name Shi. He was originally from Pingyu in Runan. In the second year of the Zhongping era of Emperor Ling of the Later Han, his sixth-generation ancestor, Xu Guang (courtesy name Shaozhang), fled the turmoil caused by the flatterer Xu You and crossed the Yangtze, settling in Jiyang Village of Duxiang County in Jurong, Danyang. Later, he served the Wu kingdom as Superintendent of the Imperial Household, renowned for his discernment and brilliance, with successive generations distinguished in talent and wisdom.

His grandfather, Xu Shang (courtesy name Yuanfu), possessed literary talent and keen insight, serving as Gentleman of the Interior in Wu. His father, Xu Fu (courtesy name Zhongxian), was of profound and far-reaching character, his demeanor refined and unadorned. He held the posts of Magistrate of Ke County, General of Pacification, Prefect of Xianxia, and Marquis of Xicheng.

Director Xu was the fifth son of Xu Fu. From childhood, he was known for his intelligence and simplicity. While still a prince, Emperor Jianwen regarded him as a paragon among his peers. He began his career as Erudite of the National University. His mastery of court rituals and Confucian discourse made him a leading authority. Later, he served as Magistrate of Yuyao, where he alleviated the people’s hardships and extended his benevolence to neighboring counties. Recalled to the capital, he became a trusted advisor at the emperor’s side.

At the end of the Shengping era, he was appointed Director of the Bureau of Military Affairs and Chief Examiner of his home commandery. Externally, he oversaw military regulations; internally, he evaluated the worthy. Distant regions adhered to his discipline, and his hometown emulated his conduct. During the Taihe era, he was promoted to Gentleman Attendant at the Yellow Gates and Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary. Adorned in the splendor of court regalia, his duties centered on the cultivation of virtue.

When Emperor Jianwen ascended the throne, he honored the elderly and cherished the wise. Had the emperor not passed prematurely, Director Xu would have retired. Instead, he withdrew to his mountain retreat to devote himself to the cultivation of the supreme Dao. Though he wore the court’s sash and cap and engaged in scholarly discourse, his heart soared beyond material forms, his aspirations bound to the gates of rosy clouds. His fourth elder brother had already departed on a distant journey. In the fourth year of the Yonghe era, he too withdrew from the world and never returned.

Director Xu had long admired the secluded and wondrous, and as the years deepened, he formed a profound spiritual bond with Master Yang. During the Xingning era, the host of Perfected Ones descended upon Master Yang, bestowing upon him the Dragon Script and Cloud Seal. The revelations encompassed the profound and abstruse mysteries of the numinous teachings, which Director Xu diligently studied. As he approached the age of retirement, his devotion to practice grew ever more steadfast.

In the first year of the Taiyuan era, he departed this world at the age of seventy-two. His sons and nephews buried him in a grand tomb west of the county. The traces of his ascent to the capital of Jingling remain fresh, and the soaring sword’s mark endures.

According to the *True Records*, his destiny was predestined, his karmic foundations long established. In the time of King Wu of Zhou, he was the younger brother of Xue, the Grand Minister of the Nine Palaces of Changli. Moreover, the accumulated merits of his ancestors ensured blessings for their descendants, so he was born into this world to fulfill his Dao. The Jade Tablet conferred upon him the rank of Perfected One of Supreme Clarity, with a noble title equivalent to a marquis and a position among the ministers. He governed the affairs of immortals, assisted the sage in shepherding the people.

The true transmission has not yet been fully revealed to the world, so its details cannot be fully recounted. Master Yang, whose personal name was Xi, is fully documented in the *True Records*.

Director Xu’s third son, Xu Yufu (courtesy name Daoxiang, given name Pian), was born to his mother, née Tao Wei, who had already passed away and ascended to the Palace of Easy Transitions in the Cavern Heavens. He was of luminous intelligence and purity, surpassing all his contemporaries.

The commandery recommended him for the post of *shangji*, yet he declined, spurning worldly affairs like chaff and dust to devote himself to the profound Daoist arts. He was none other than the true master of Master Hongjing in the mysteries of the unseen. He dwelt constantly in this residence, repairing and transmitting the scriptures and methods. Master Yang often sought his guidance, and through repeated communion, they attained true resonance.

In the fifth year of the Taihe era, he passed away here at the age of thirty. The *True Records* state: sixteen years later, he would be destined to ascend as the attendant to the Eastern Flower Youth, the Prime Minister of the Azure Lad. In the Court of the Celestial Dawn, he would receive the scriptures and be appointed as an Immortal Duke of Supreme Clarity, sharing office with Gu Xizi. His rank in the Court of the Celestial Dawn was comparable to that of a palace attendant in the mortal realm.

His eldest brother, Kui (secular name Zhen), and his second brother, Huya (secular name Lian), both likewise attained the Dao. Kui now has a great-great-grandson, Lingzhen, who resides in the mountains and has urged the establishment of the Hall of Successive Perfected Ones to honor the virtue of their distant ancestor.

Our August Emperor, riding the power of his great vow, descended to this land to nurture the black-haired people and mold the myriad beings. He guided by law and shaped customs, unfolding teachings in accordance with the unfolding of destiny. As Master Yinju had long accumulated the three scriptures and records of the Perfected Ones, dwelling for many years in Huayang, it was fitting that he return to his former residence to maintain and cultivate it. Thus, artisans were summoned to construct this hall of tranquility. In reverence to the celestial standard and to propagate the great Dao, an azure altar was raised in the east and a pure pagoda erected in the west. Between altar and pagoda lies the foundation, where tiles and bricks were laid, and beams were set in place. Purple mists and white vapors coil and swirl, casting their shade like a canopy.

South of the residence lies a well, dug by Director Xu himself. South of the well is a great pond, a remnant of Guo Chao’s design. Its source is the spring of Lord Tian, and its path follows the tracks of Jiang Ba. Flanking it is Leiping, and before it stretches Xiabo. To the east, ridges connect in succession, while to the north, a long ridge extends. The willows of Yanggu and the fertile valleys converge at the western edge. Within these four bounds, the land is called Jinling, the "lung of the earth." Director Xu’s dwelling is especially distinguished. Soon, he will harness clouds and rainbows to soar high, driving swift cranes to chase the wind. Gazing upon the vast and boundless waves, he will roll up the distant ancient capital like a scroll.

As the ancients said: if no deeds are wrought, what legacy remains? Thus, we dare to inscribe this stone in praise, that it may endure for future worthies. The primal axis races with the qi, and the earth’s spirit exhales its numen. By nature, it divides into realms; by perception, it assumes form. Transforming through the eight abodes, its merit permeates the four darknesses. Traces vanish like lightning, bodies abide like deep pools. The revolving regions stand like mountains, and in a single day, the sea’s clouds unfurl. Grasping the wind and swimming the waters, their traces truly rest upon emptiness. Even the hidden craftsmen of stone open caverns to frame their dwellings. With lofty sentiments and radiant presence, they reside in the celestial palaces and earthly abodes. Winding peaks curve like bows, and painted lands float like lungs. Five gates open on all sides, and nine paths encircle them. Long ridges stretch beside the hills, their streams intertwining like braided cords—thus it is called "Dragon’s Crouch." The emperor named it "Golden Mound."

Long ago in the Western Han, the Three Mao Brothers came as guests. By the Eastern Jin, the Two Xus embraced the true Dao, laying foundations, dredging wells, dwelling in seclusion, and communing with spirits. Truly, they were worthy aides to the sage, granted the honor of serving at the Celestial Dawn. Though the ages have passed and names have faded, the scriptures and records fully proclaim their radiant essence, which has not yet dimmed. Yet the refined and the coarse have mingled, and the sacred steps have crumbled. Frost has withered the trees in the courtyard, and weeds have overgrown the once-tended gardens.

When the Hall of Huayang was first established, two cycles of twelve years had elapsed. Ever observing the former principles, we now follow the grand path. The emperor declared: "O Grove, here shall you abide." We have cultivated and built it, and now it stands resplendent. The sacred hall resonates with subtle echoes, pouring forth fragrance like a vase of blossoms. Jade palaces and azure tablets gleam with radiant patterns. Jeweled caskets and jade seals are draped with embroidered curtains and silken veils. Orchid lamps blaze brightly, and golden censers waft their incense. The paired teachings of the paulownia and the square mirror are both studied. Together, they testify to the purity of the heart and the impurity of the body. Departing from being and non-being, they embrace both the ornate and the plain. They are named the "Vacuous August One," and their methods are those of true awakening. Medicinal omens manifest in luminous forms, and meditative resonance opens wisdom. Soaring in joy, they grasp the rainbow and tread upon light. They dispel suffering and cast off the mundane, returning to brightness and regaining their hearing. Things speak of their power, yet I see no merit of my own. Through the ages, past and present, the two realms stretch boundlessly. The three illusions deceive, yet the boat and the ravine move of themselves. Responding to destiny as it unfolds, they act without premeditation. Thus, we inscribe this in the tortoise-shell records, that gods and humans may bear witness.

The Stele of Lord Ge, Left Minister of the Grand Ultimate of Wu

That which crowns the two principles at their inception and whose name transcends the origins of the myriad things cannot be debated by speech nor fathomed by designation. If it could be described in words, how could metal and stone transmit antiquity? When it flourishes, the sun and moon shine in vain. When it is silent, mortals remain in eternal darkness. Thus, it emerged from the pass, guiding with two scrolls, and ascended, bestowing its five texts. It allowed those who embrace the numinous and hold to consciousness to know that within the unfathomable, there is essence.

From that time onward, through successive generations, it has manifested. Cloud-script and dragon-chapters gleam upon the forest peaks. Earthly words and radiant qi flourish in the halls and courtyards. Those who could leave behind models and become the subjects of ballads and chants have continued until this day.

In the middle ages, Gan Zuo startled the King of Wei, and Xiang Feng displayed his marvels to the Lord of Wu. Yet the talent of Lord Ge was surpassingly brilliant, standing out most prominently. Though he traveled through famous mountains in his time, he often dwelt upon this ridge. This ridge is no cavern-heaven, yet it straddles the central river. To the east, peaks stretch into the sea; to the south, layered peaks pierce the clouds. To the west, the river runs clear; to the north, the outskirts of the city lie near. This is a hidden and manifest realm of mystery, a gateway for emergence and retreat. A stone well, half a fathom deep, is drawn from daily, yet its source remains unfathomable. A three-legged white muntjac, unchanged for a hundred years, embodies a purity that even spirits cannot alter and deities guard and protect. Followers of the hemp-robed lineage of the Historians have successively dwelt here. Later, his descendant Sun Weizu also inherited the residence.

In later years, Pan Hong of Shanyin (courtesy name Wensheng) resided here. From youth, he embraced the Daoist nature, his will and strength resolute and bright. Previously, he established an abbey in Yuyao, Siming, and the Kingdom of Yue, a hundred li upward, where the paths were overgrown and perilous. Yet his arts and knowledge proved useful, and the sentiments of the people turned toward him.

In the seventh year of the Tianjian era, the powerful and venerable families of the commandery and counties jointly urged him to remain, not by his own will, but because this mountain stood at the vital crossroads of five counties. Thus, he stayed for fifteen years. Intending to move his retreat to the altar above, he found an old stele already toppled and broken. Pan Hong reflected: if one cherishes the shade of a tree, how much more should one revere its branches? Could the sacred traces left by the immortal sage be allowed to vanish? He therefore erected a new stele in its place, wishing to inscribe his name upon it for eternal transmission. Though his hermitage lay a thousand *li* distant, he entrusted this stone to be carved here.

The immortal sage was surnamed Ge, personal name Xuan, courtesy name Xiaoxian. A native of Jiyang Village in Danyang’s Juyong County, he originally hailed from Langye but later settled here when his ancestor, the Marquis of Piaoxi of the Later Han, ceded his state to his younger brother. His seventh-generation ancestor, Ai, was that younger brother and inherited the title of Marquis of Piaoxi. His grandfather, Ju, served as Prefect of Anping and Gentleman of the Yellow Gate. His great-uncle, Mi, governed five commanderies, including Yuzhang. His father, Yan, styled Deru, held the posts of Registrar of the Province, Magistrate of Shanyin, Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary, and Grand Master of Splendid Happiness. Their lineage teemed with brilliance, its renown filling the annals of history.

From childhood, the sage bore extraordinary conduct, surpassing all his peers. His spirit soared with lofty distinction, his essence radiant and transcendent. Though he never studied the classics, he grasped them intuitively; though he heard of Daoist arts but once, he mastered them completely. No conventional norms could restrain him, no ordinary wisdom encompass him. He dwelt beyond the bounds of human sentiment and reason, beyond the reach of words and forms.

In the early Wu era, Zuo Yuanfang arrived from Luoyang and transmitted to him the Seven Transformations of the White Tiger and the Nine Elixirs of the Furnace and Fire. Thereupon, his five spiritual penetrations became fully realized, and his transformative Dao knew no limits. Though Sun Quan admired and esteemed immortals and marvels, he harbored suspicion and malice within. Those like Yu Fan suffered rebuffs and exile, yet he stood in awe of the immortal sage, constantly seeking his counsel. The sage traversed rivers and mountains, attended by dragon and tiger retinues. He frequented Changshan and Gaizhu, and his comings and goings were especially numerous. The windswept orchids of Tiantai and the fragrant breezes of Lanfeng were his favored haunts. When he returned to the capital, he treated people as playthings, his conduct unpredictable and bold, overturning rivers and mountains at will. Whether casting his shoes into the abyss or commanding stones to rise at his rebuke, none could match his audacity.

At that time, there was a man adrift upon the sea, tossed by the winds across boundless, surging waves. Suddenly, he came upon a divine isle, where someone entrusted him with a sealed scroll, inscribed: *"To be delivered to Master Ge the Immortal."* He was instructed to return to Wu and present it. From then on, the entire realm revered him as the Immortal Master. Thus, in the *Baopuzi*, it is also written: *"My ancestor was an immortal."* The Master was indeed a descendant of Baopu. Three generations of his forebears were immortals. Common texts and traditions speak of him as having been appointed to the position of Left Immortal Master by the Supreme Polarity. Yet in works like the *Zhen’gao* and the old genealogies of the Ge clan, the accounts do not align. Perhaps the teachings diverged, or the circumstances of the time necessitated such claims—much like a guard bearing a halberd at the palace steps. How could one expect to pluck the sacred peaches thrice, merely to be tasked with summoning spirits and commanding ghosts, unaware that his rank remained but a minor office? Judging by the expedient Dao, there is no need to debate their discrepancies further.

In the seventh year of the Chiwu era, on the fifteenth day of the eighth month of the jiazi year, at dawn, the Immortal Master ascended to transcendence. He departed never to return, ever accompanied by Guo Shengzi and others. In time, he would be appointed to the Mysterious Capital, granted the celestial rank of a divine office, and serve as one of the Four Auxiliaries, governing and overseeing the affairs of humans and earthly spirits. Gazing back upon his former homeland, how could he not sigh with longing? Turning to later disciples, may he extend the compassion of guidance.

Daring to rely upon the humble standing of his clan, I now recount the legacy of this true immortal. Thus:

The nine gorges stand severed, the seven stars hang suspended in emptiness. Space is divided to form realms, darkness gathers to construct the heavens. Things flourish in number, transformations arise in form. Life follows the turning of shapes, spirit is entrusted to the transmission of karma. Frost withers the wilds in decline, bamboo and paulownia thrive in emerald hues. Springs and ruins share a common fate, yet Peng and Xian alone return. Life is grasped through affairs, years are sought through learning. Like gold in the cold, like silk on the loom—

The Immortal Master’s jade scepter gleamed, his hidden brilliance burst forth. He matched the traces of Xiang’s boyhood, his shadow joined that of Xiang Ru. He bathed his essence in the brocade chambers, concentrated his mind upon the dark peaks. Having mastered the tiger’s transformation, he then rode the dragon’s chariot. He exhausted the heights of Tai and Huo, roamed the vastness of Lan’s vault. The azure altar purified itself, the jade waters flowed endlessly. He wandered through fragrant groves to bathe in the Dao, his heart moved with sorrow for the ancients. This towering stele stands to eternally spread his lofty virtue. The orchid winds of his favored haunts have already been engraved upon a grand monument. Yet this land, his former dwelling, remains uncarved with enduring inscriptions. Now, his distant descendants, in reverence of his pure legacy, respectfully seek to inscribe and erect this stele, that his fragrance may be transmitted to future generations.

**Petition for Resignation from Office**

I have heard that the winds of Yao soared to the heavens, and Yingyang’s discourse stirred the rivers. The virtue of Han encompassed the earth, and Shangyin’s spirit soared on the breath of lingzhi. I have long dwelt in seclusion, wearing the cap and sash for many years. My service was never for glory, nor my studies for salary. I have always yearned to hang my official cords at the palace gates and till the fields alone, to sit beneath the moon at my valley door, or play the zither amid the clouds. By the grace of the central court, I was granted my wish to retire to the hills and streams. Now, I shall vanish like a shadow in the cassia courtyard, my spirit communing with the pines. Though I depart from the palace gates, my homeland remains in sight. As I coil my words in reflection, tears fall upon the waves.

My boat and oars have already been left behind; I cannot attend in person. Unable to bear the weight of my longing, I respectfully submit this petition.

**Imperial Rescript in Reply**

You have cast aside worldly burdens and grain, ever aspiring to purity and emptiness. In the tranquility of the mountains, you find joy in your true nature—may you fully realize your noble aspirations. If you have any needs, you may report them at once.

Additionally, you are granted ten bolts of silk and twenty sticks of wax. A separate gift of fine goods is also bestowed.

Monthly, We grant you five *jin* of superior *fuling* and two *dou* of white honey for your regimen of ingestion.

**Submission of *Zhou’s Records of Mystic Communication***
Your servant reports: In the latter part of the tenth month, matters concerning the Zhou family arose. As I was then observing purification rites, I could not immediately submit a report. Now, I have respectfully compiled these events into four volumes, which are presented separately. Yet I, enmeshed in the web of doubt like Guo, failed to awaken to belief sooner. In remorse and self-reproach, I fear I have incurred stern censure—all is set forth in detail in the accompanying memorial. Humbly, I pray for leniency in my negligence. Respectfully submitted.

**Imperial Rescript in Reply**
We have reviewed your memorial and seen Zhou’s posthumous revelations, which clearly fulfill earlier prophecies. The two or three instances of verification are especially wondrous. The four volumes are now retained here. As for the accompanying memorial, its every word is noted; We can only sigh in admiration.

**“Announcing the Journey”**
Since the spirit’s inception of old,
The green karma has long followed.
Transformation is not annihilation;
In principle, sorrow and joy fade.
Crown and sword are but empty shadows;
The bit and bridle belong to the immortal’s form.
Departing this bright chariot’s song,
You join the guests of Ying Terrace.
If you can tread the tracks left behind,
I shall guide you to the Dao’s mystic ford.

**“Rhapsody on the Wind of the Cloudborne Immortals”**
Drifting in distant reaches,
One morning it soars over the azure sea, scattering dawn’s rosy clouds,
Traversing the blue mist to fill the farthest heavens.
It surges through Dragon Gate, churning the waters,
Crosses Cong Pass, whirling snow.
Thus the Han realm stirs in awe,
The moon’s chariot startles at its patterns.
It floats through the void into light,
Ascends the sky, rides the clouds.
A single flight spans ten thousand *li*,
Yet scarcely a day passes.
This is the wind of Liezi—wind that depends on conditions.

Yet there is a wind that embraces the cosmos,
Envelops the pillars of heaven,
Circulates through the eight directions,
Cycles through the four seasons.
*Qi* stirs the pitch-pipes when the season arrives;
Its position shifts from *xun* to *li*, from *ji* to *kun*.
One sees only the threads of its coming and going,
Never the beginning or end of its term.
This is the wind of Great Emptiness—wind of non-action.

**Stele Inscription for the Changsha Lodge at Mount Mao**
All the myriad forms arrayed in the world arise from the nurture of the Two Modes.
The hundred teachings flourish without transcending the bounds of the Three Teachings.
Scholars of the court don their ceremonial robes within palace halls;
The steadfast and upright raise their banners on the mountain’s edge.

Inscription:
Great is the Creative! All things depend on it for their beginning.
Kings receive the Mandate, and the Three Powers are ordered.
Only the sage moves the divine;
Only the divine bestows blessings.
Virtue resounds in song and bell,
Names shine in the annals of history.
Brotherly love and reverence—
Here, the western lands proclaim them.
Words follow flourishing deeds,
To honor those who came before.
Dare we alter old customs?
Yet we have revised the miscellaneous verses.
Carved in stone, it shall not perish,
Leaving fragrance for generations to come.

**Stele Inscription for the Sun Gate Lodge at Mount Taiping**
The Sun Gate Lodge takes its name from the dawn’s rays piercing the gorge, opening the crag to draw forth the torch’s light. Formerly, the Eminent Lord Du of Wu Commandery—his renown high in two dynasties, his virtue foremost in the four quarters—spread his teachings far and wide, their influence reaching several commanderies. He expanded his precincts east of Mount Taiping and built his retreat north of Jing Mountain. Finding this place secluded and wondrous, he established his foundation here. Those who dwell here in pursuit of the Dao have passed many years.

**Inscription for the Quilin Lodge at Mount Mao**
Lofty ridges rise without;
Deep halls gleam within.
Narrow caves branch to the side;
Winding springs mirror the distance.
Those who esteem virtue abide in benevolence,
Seeking life and nurturing destiny.
Now heaven, now earth—
Now ordinary, now sacred.
Roofs and rafters stand side by side,
Each claiming to know the Dao.
Their teachings vary,
Their literary styles soar or plunge.
Yet who compares to Quilin Lodge,
Alone in its steadfast excellence?
Here, one conceals one’s traces and veils one’s merits,
Abiding in this place to grow old together.

**Letter in Reply to the Secretary**
The beauty of mountains and rivers has been a shared topic since ancient times. Lofty peaks pierce the clouds; limpid streams reveal their beds. On either shore, stone cliffs glow with intermingled hues. Green forests and emerald bamboo stand complete in all four seasons. At dawn, the mist begins to disperse—monkeys and birds cry in chorus. As the evening sun inclines, fish leap in the depths. Truly, this is the immortals’ realm within the desire realm. Since Xie Lingyun’s time, none have matched its wonders.

**Letter in Reply to Yu Zhong**
For some time now, you have perched your transcendent wings on the branches of Jing, gazing at the brocade clouds in the azure sky. Spring’s blossoms have arrived, adorning the grasses and stones with fresh beauty. Your words stir the depths of feeling; your aspirations intertwine with mine. Truly, the discourse of kindred spirits is never empty. Though you remain near the vermilion towers, your heart longs for Mount Tai. How could you merely loosen your hair in the high peaks, or scatter frost in the remote valleys? How admirable indeed!

This rustic has been fortunate to lodge his form on lofty heights, resting his shadow in the endless woods. Often, I sigh beneath the flowing moon or face the wind with deep emotion. Yet my entanglements remain unresolved, and my appearance betrays the passage of time. Unless one equates life and death as one, who could remain untroubled? The world drifts on—who shares this sentiment? If I should meet a kindred spirit, we might share our sorrows together. Since you have come, Master Yu, how could I not advance? Why wander restlessly, vainly beating the earthen jar? When leisure comes, let us attend to rejuvenation. Would this not be as radiant as in youth, free from shame before the ancients?

**Letter in Reply to Zhao Yingcai**
You have built your learning within the realm of scholarship, yet your talent soars beyond its bounds. Unwilling to sweep your gate in search of office, you are too indolent even to refine your skills for advancement. Thus, you remain aloof in your garden lane, at ease in the countryside. This, then, is the so-called “proud guest.” As for this rustic beneath the cliffs—he guards his single-minded resolve. Not that I dare scorn glory or mock the world, but I follow my nature and go straight ahead, preserving my uselessness to gain leisure. Gathering firewood and drawing water bring me abundant joy; cutting pines and boiling herbs—what other tasks occupy me?

Yet the heavens and earth are a vast dwelling, and the myriad things share in a single transformation. Life and death, good and evil—how can one fathom them?

**Preface to *The Classic of Physiognomy***
Physiognomy reveals the nature and destiny inscribed in one’s form and bones, just as fortune and misfortune are manifest in one’s *qi* and appearance. It is like acting only after thorough deliberation, or responding only after the heart has moved. Inner and outer correspond, yet none know how. Still, wealth and nobility, longevity and early death—each meets its allotted measure. Dong Xian, though barely past twenty, rose above the Three Dukes, his wealth half the nation’s. Yet before thirty, his body was broken, his family ruined.

Feng Tang’s chair wore thin in the bureau halls, Yang Xiong stood like a wall in his lofty chamber—yet both reached hoary age. Some feast on jade viands in their twilight years, yet their rank never rises above clerk or scribe. Some are sharp as spirits in wisdom, yet barely reach their allotted span. Others cannot tell beans from wheat, yet live out their days in ease. This further shows how each attains but a partial measure.
