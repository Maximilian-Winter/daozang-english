**The Orthodox Classic of the Divine Chess: Preface**

The *Orthodox Classic of the Divine Chess* is a work of uncertain authorship, annotated by Yan Youming of the Jin dynasty and continued by He Chengtian of the Liu-Song dynasty. It comprises two scrolls. The base text is derived from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Tai Xuan* section. Collated versions include Dunhuang manuscript P.4048, volume 719.

**Preface to the *Divine Chess Classic***

The origins of the *Divine Chess Classic* are unknown. Some say Emperor Wu of Han commanded Dongfang Shuo to employ it, and none of his ancient divinations failed—his art relied on this book. Others claim the Yellow Stone Elder bestowed it upon Zhang Liang. Still others recount the esoteric affairs of the Prince of Huainan, also attributing them to this text. Likely, later admirers embellished its reputation to exalt its art, but how could it truly be the work of all these figures?

Though I had long heard of it, I paid it little mind, deeming it not a classic or historical work. By the end of the Kaicheng era, as I prepared to journey to Min, I heard of the Jian River, where rocks barred the surging rapids, and boatmen scaled perilous crags. Even the bravest warriors would sweat and tremble—how much more so a coward like me? As a scholar, I could not resolve my fear.

Upon reaching Si, I encountered my cousin An and confessed my timidity. An said, "I’ve heard the Jian River is not so treacherous—those tales are exaggerated." He possessed a divination book that could dispel doubt, so I asked him to consult it. The oracle read:

*"Above and below, the heart is at peace,
No treachery arises within.
Stand firm, free from care,
Heed not idle rumors."*

I laughed, and indeed, the rumors proved false. An then entrusted the book to me, and I carried it to Min. My journey was untroubled, and I came to trust its wisdom. Whenever I sought answers to other doubts, they were as clear as if I had witnessed them myself.

Alas! What the world dismisses may yet be a supreme treasure, while what it esteems may not be truly fine. A single volume of this book resolved my uncertainties—how could it not be prized?

From this, I understood that a scholar’s rise or fall, wealth or poverty, is fated, and cannot be judged by a single path. Examining the book, it seemed the work of one who had attained the Dao. Twelve chess pieces are divided into three sets of four—upper, middle, and lower—cast to form a hexagram, then matched to the text to reveal its meaning.

The upper four represent Heaven, the middle four Humanity, and the lower four Earth—the trinity of the Three Powers. Each of the twelve pieces bears an inscription, akin to the judgments of the *Zhou Changes*. Cast together, they form a hexagram, hence the name *Divine Chess*.

Later, while serving as an official in Fuzhou, I had ample leisure. I gathered dozens of versions, collated and corrected them, removing errors and preserving truth, compiling them here. Future scholars may study it without doubt.

During my time in Min, the distance from my homeland stretched thousands of miles across land and water, leaving me uneasy. One day, I cast the pieces and obtained the hexagram *"The Broad Way of Heaven"*, its words most auspicious. I trusted its promise. Yet, days after leaving Min, an imperial decree summoned me as an imperial censor. The divination had foretold this—was it not divine?

The *Divine Chess Classic* is a legacy of the Yellow Stone Elder. Some say it is Dongfang Shuo’s method of divination. Others claim it was composed by Zhang Liang or the Prince of Huainan, Liu An, annotated by Yan Youming of the Jin and He Chengtian of the Song, with a preface by Li Yuan of the Tang. Transmitted through the ages as the Yellow Stone Elder’s work, the *Bibliographic Treatise of the Tang Dynasty*’s *Five Elements* section records only its title.

Its method employs twelve round pieces carved from jujube wood struck by lightning. The oracles number one hundred and twenty-four. Four pieces symbolize Heaven, inscribed with "upper"; four symbolize Humanity, inscribed with "middle"; and four symbolize Earth, inscribed with "lower." After prayer, they are cast, and the oracle is consulted to determine fortune or misfortune.

The *History of the Southern Qi* records Jiang Mi’s divination, yielding: *"A guest comes from the south, bestowing fine wealth—treasures, jewels, golden cups, and jade vessels."* Yang Wengong’s *Garden of Talks* records that in the first year of Xianping, while seeking an external appointment, he cast three upper, two middle, and one lower pieces, matching Jiang Mi’s oracle. At the time, the compilation of the *Veritable Records of Taizong* was unfinished, so his request was denied. Soon after, he was appointed as an envoy for a prince’s birthday and received gifts of silver vessels. Later, he cast again, obtaining four middle and three lower pieces, the *"Avoiding the World"* oracle, which read:

*"Petty men prevail,
Noble ones lose the Way.
Leave my home,
Enter the deep grass."*

He indeed fell ill and returned to Yangdi. Other divinations were equally accurate, but each casting pertained to a single matter—repeating it yielded no result. As the saying goes: *"To profane is to receive no answer; divination is not repeated."*

Zhu Xi, in his discussions with Lin Zhengqing on the *Changes*, remarked: "Recently, someone asked about the *Changes*. I replied, 'Have you seen the *Divine Chess* oracles? The *Changes* is much the same.'" Observing the prefaces and annotations from the Jin, Song, and Tang dynasties, as well as the words of two Song masters, one trusts it as an ancient text. Great sacrifices to the divine tortoise, divination methods—all are preserved. Even methods like milfoil stalks or tile divination are usable; how much more so an ancient text from the Qin and Han?

Alas! The ruler’s mandate extends across the vast heavens; the sun’s brilliance endures as if present. Above, as if present; beside, as if present—such is the power of the spirits. Knock, and they respond; move them, and they commune. Is not the spirit of the heart worthy of reverence?

Master Zhang Nanxuan, during a drought in Bagui, cast the pieces under the scorching sun and obtained the sixty-second oracle, *"Yin Prolongs"*:

*"Water deep in the courtyard,
Boats row beneath the hall."*

Soon after, heavy rain fell. This is recorded in his *Recorded Sayings*.

This book was once in my late father’s collection. Its oracles distinguish yin and yang, odd and even; only when yang prevails over yin is it auspicious.

Through one’s own sincerity and devotion, none fails to receive a response.

The *Divine Chess Classic* was originally transmitted by the Marquis of Liu to the Yellow Stone Master during the Han, enabling foreknowledge of events yet to come. Initially used for divining the times, deploying troops, and setting out on journeys, it proved infallible. By the reign of Emperor Wu, Dongfang Shuo was ordered to test its accuracy across myriad affairs, and it invariably struck true. Some say the Eight Masters employed this method, passing it to the King of Huainan; a retainer from Huainan later obtained it, guarding it in secrecy so that none might receive it.

By the Tai Kang era of the Jin, the Daoist adept Chang Fahe of Xiangcheng declared: An old man clad in yellow hempen robes appeared, bearing this book in a bamboo tube, and bestowed it upon Fahe. Fahe then transmitted it to the world.

Its method employs twelve pieces made from thunderstruck wood, or catalpa, jujube, or sandalwood, each one cun and two fen in diameter, three fen in thickness. Four pieces are inscribed with the *upper* character, four with the *middle* character, and four with the *lower* character.

When divining, one must first compose the spirit, purify with incense, don proper attire, and sit in stillness. After a moment of focused contemplation, hold the twelve casting pieces with reverence, exhale upon them, and offer a prayer. Then cast all twelve pieces at once, arranging the resulting *upper*, *middle*, and *lower* characters in sequence to form a hexagram. Discard any scattered pieces and consult the manual to interpret the outcome. For each matter divined, cast the pieces only once—repeated casting renders fortune and misfortune uncertain.

During the Song era, Wang Yin and his brothers, along with He Chengtian, deliberated upon this classic. Those who approached it with sincere devotion invariably found its judgments accurate. Yet many, failing to grasp its subtle principles, dismissed it as ineffective and treated it with disdain. He who discerns the incipient knows more than half the truth; he who remains unaware of the incipient misjudges even the slightest movement. To know both the incipient and the movement is to comprehend more than half the Way. Whether one withdraws or advances, accepts or rejects, these paths diverge—one cannot assume that a single auspicious phrase confirms predestined fate.

Thus, "In the northeast, friends are lost," yet in the end, there is cause for celebration. "The traveler gains an ox," but this portends disaster for the villagers. "Darkness in *Mingyi*," "Greatness in *Feng*’s upper trigram"—these cannot be discussed as equals. The hexagrams, divided into *upper*, *middle*, and *lower*, embody the *Yijing*’s principle of the Three Powers. Through permutations, they yield a total of one hundred twenty-four hexagrams, with odd and even numbers determining fortune and misfortune. Odd numbers are yang, and yang is auspicious; even numbers are yin, and yin is inauspicious. By this method, fortune and misfortune become clear.

The words accompanying each hexagram are its *yao* text. The diviner must focus solely on their truth or falsehood, for therein virtue and vice are determined. If the meaning of the words does not align with the situation, one should carefully consider their intent. For instance, phrases like "majestic and resplendent, attaining without seeking" bode well for matters such as pursuing fugitives or recovering lost items, but not for divining illness or marriage. Similarly, "A year of prosperity, a month of flourishing—how can one know the stability of Mount Tai?" suggests that when treading danger, seeking wealth is auspicious, yet for one wandering far from home longing for return, the outcome remains uncertain.

Again, "Ruler and minister exchange positions, great fortune arises"—this is auspicious for the noble person but dire for the petty. Or "Thieves plunder my home, the worthy conceal themselves and advance"—this is auspicious for the petty but inauspicious for the noble. All such interpretations must be deduced by analogy. The distinction between noble and petty lies not in rank or power but in orientation: those who turn toward the Dao are noble, while those who turn away are petty. The wise employ this method without confusion.

"For whatever doubts reside in the heart, simply speak them aloud."

#9 "Whenever one wishes to divine, one must first compose the spirit, purify with incense, don proper attire, and sit in stillness. After a moment of focused contemplation, take up the twelve divination pieces and, with reverent heart, exhale and invoke them."

The Dunhuang version reads: "Each time one performs divination, one must first purify with incense and sit in quietude for a while. Then, holding the pieces, recite the incantation: *'Earthly servant so-and-so humbly invokes the gods of the Four First Months, the gods of the Four Mid-Seasons, the gods of the Four Seasons, the Twelve Celestial Offices—above, I beseech the Heavenly and Earthly Parents, the Supreme Primordial Elders, the Sun and Moon, the Five Planets, the Northern Dipper’s Seven Stars, the Four Seasons and Five Phases, the Six Jia and Yin-Yang, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, and the Year’s Bright Hall: so-and-so harbors doubts in the heart and requests a decision. If auspicious, declare it auspicious; if inauspicious, declare it inauspicious. Of gain or loss, right or wrong, let the forms appear upon the earth. For whatever doubts reside in the heart, simply speak them aloud.'"

#10 Immediately cast all twelve divination pieces at once, then arrange the resulting "upper," "middle," and "lower" characters in sequence to form a hexagram. Discard the stray pieces and consult the manual to interpret it. For each matter divined, cast the pieces once—casting again will render the auspices uncertain.

The Dunhuang version reads: *Cast the pieces to determine "upper," "middle," and "lower," then arrange them into a hexagram to fix the auspices. Once determined, do not divine again, for a second casting will leave the auspices uncertain.*

#11 The hexagram’s "upper," "middle," and "lower" positions correspond to the *Yijing*’s principle of the Three Powers. Through permutation, a total of one hundred twenty-four hexagrams are formed, all distinguished by odd and even lines to determine auspices.

The Dunhuang version reads: *The "upper," "middle," and "lower" positions embody the principle of the Three Powers. Through permutation, one hundred twenty-four hexagrams are formed, all distinguished by odd and even lines to determine auspices.*

#12 Odd lines are yang, and yang is auspicious. Even lines are yin, and yin is inauspicious. By this principle, the auspices may be discerned.

The Dunhuang version reads: *Odd lines are yang, even lines are yin. By this principle, the auspices may be discerned.*

#13 Then it is fitting.

The Dunhuang version reads: *Fitting.*

#14 For instance, when the signs are towering and resplendent, gains come unbidden. In such cases, divination for matters like pursuing fugitives or recovering lost property is auspicious, but for illness or marriage, it is not.

The Dunhuang version reads: *For example, when the signs are towering and imposing, gains come unbidden. In such cases, divination for pursuit, recovery, or seeking wealth is auspicious, but applying it to illness brings misfortune.*

#15 When treading perilous ground, divining for wealth is auspicious. For those traveling afar who long for a swift return, the signs will indicate they have not yet arrived.

The Dunhuang version reads: *When in distress, divining for wealth or dwelling places is auspicious. For those wandering in distant lands who hope for a quick return, the signs will indicate they have not yet arrived.*

#16 Likewise, when ruler and minister exchange positions and great fortune arises, the noble encountering this will find it auspicious, while the petty will meet great misfortune.

The Dunhuang version reads: *Likewise, when ruler and minister are in their proper places and great fortune arises, the noble encountering this will find it auspicious, while the petty will meet misfortune.*

#17 All must be deduced by category.

The Dunhuang version reads: *Deduce by category to grasp the hexagram’s meaning.*

#18 The terms "noble" and "petty" are judged by alignment with the Way, not by rank or power. Those who turn toward the Dao are noble; those who turn away are petty. The wise apply this principle and remain free from confusion.

The Dunhuang version reads: *The terms "noble" and "petty" are judged by virtue and conduct, not by rank. Those who uphold the Dao are noble; those who abandon it are petty. Those who value benevolence and righteousness while scorning bribes and profit are noble; those who slight trust and righteousness while prizing rank and emolument are petty.*

In ancient times, before the sages composed the *Yi*, the people used spirit divining blocks, which were modeled after the *Yi*. The Way of the *Yi* is profound and difficult to comprehend, thus they created the symbolic system of spirit blocks. Though it does not exhaust the subtleties of the *Yi*, without mastery of the *Yi*, how could one compose the oracles of the spirit blocks?

The system of spirit blocks takes three as its warp and four as its weft. The three positions—above, middle, and below—represent Heaven, Humanity, and Earth. They also signify the ruler, the minister, and the people. The four configurations—one as *shaoyang*, three as *taiyang*, two as *shaoyin*, and four as *laoyin*—pair *shaoyang* with *shaoyin* as harmonious, while *taiyang* with *taiyang* becomes adversarial. Harmony brings joy, while adversity sparks conflict—this is the constant Way. Yet sometimes, losing the Way, harmony may invert into enmity; or by aligning with its course, adversity may transform into utility—such are its permutations.

When yang prevails, paths align and mutual illumination follows. When yin dominates, intentions diverge and discord arises. This marks the division between the noble and the petty. The alternation of yin and yang, the differentiation of forms, and the shifting of names—such is the Way of the *Yi*. The *Yi* draws its symbols from chariots, buckets, arrows, hares, foxes, and the like; yet by extension, it encompasses all things under Heaven. It speaks of a horse yet signifies a dragon, or names water yet implies transformation—this is the meaning of the *Yi*. Without penetrating the mysteries of all under Heaven, one cannot grasp it. Thus, the spirit blocks were created in emulation of the *Yi*, and only those deeply versed in the *Yi* can master them.

I have always admired the accuracy of its divinations but lamented that interpreters fail to fully convey the author’s intent. Therefore, I have expanded upon its principles and elucidated its meaning.

**Method for Crafting the Blocks**
Use *pili* wood, catalpa, jujube, or white sandalwood, measuring one *cun* and two *fen* in diameter, three *fen* in thickness, and perfectly round, calibrated to the *zhou* ruler. Cut the wood on a *jiazi* day, inscribe it on a *bingzi* day, carve it on a *wuzi* day, apply cinnabar grains on a *gengzi* day, and store it in a case on a *renzi* day. The case should be made of *ziwei* wood.

**Preparation of Pokeweed (Shanglu)**
Take any quantity of pokeweed root, pare away the thin outer layer with a bronze knife, and slice it thinly. Soak it in east-flowing water for two nights, then steam it in a steamer, layering it with bean leaves. Steam from noon until midnight, remove the bean leaves, dry the root in the sun, and finely chop it for use as sacrificial jerky.

**Invocation and Incantation**
*"Heaven is clear, Earth is tranquil; the River Chart holds its numen. A single censer of sacred incense purifies the ten directions. Three rolls of the ritual drum summon all spirits to heed."*

**Prayer**
*"Heaven and Earth unite their virtue, sun and moon their brightness; the four seasons keep their order, ghosts and spirits align with fortune and misfortune. August Heaven is impartial, aiding only those with virtue. On this day, in this year, this month, this day, [name and native place], I reverently burn incense and invoke the gods of the Four First Months, the Four Middle Months, the Four Seasons, the Twelve Earthly Branches, the Celestial and Terrestrial Parents, the Supreme Primordial Sovereign, the Sun to the left and Moon to the right, the Five Stars and Northern Dipper, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Four Seasons and Five Phases, the Six Jia and Yin-Yang, the Hall of Light and Yearly Virtue, the Twelve Celestial Gods, the Twelve Terrestrial Spirits, the Year, Month, Day, and Hour Officers, and the Attendant Messengers of Merit: I, born at this hour, humbly present my purpose regarding [state matter]. My heart holds a wish, my mind harbors doubt; hesitant and uncertain, I seek your judgment. Favor or ill, fortune or misfortune—let the oracle decide. I reverently await your sagely illumination and manifest response."*

**Incantation**
*"Om hum hum ma-ni da-li hum cha chi."*
Recite three times in a single breath.

Then cast the twelve blocks at once, forming a hexagram according to the upper, middle, and lower positions. Consult the oracle’s words to determine fortune or misfortune.

**Closing Prayer for Sending Forth the Spirits**
*"Having invoked your presence and reverently consulted the spirit blocks, I have received your gracious response. Now I humbly send you forth. May you return adorned with clouds and mist, ascending to your palaces in the celestial vault. As you came, you bestowed grace; as you depart, leave blessings behind. Whenever summoned, return as before."*

**Sacrificial Rite**
On the seventh day of the first lunar month each year, fast and bathe according to the ritual. By the waterside, prepare a mat, wine, fruit, incense, jerky, and paper candles. Invoke the spirits as previously described, then clasp the left hand in a mudra, bow, and sigh:
*"Heaven is clear, Earth is numinous; dragons and tigers hold their power. The Six Jia and Six Ding spirits follow my command. Banish evil, uphold the right, emerging from darkness into light."*

I now receive your summons—descend swiftly without delay.
Form, shadow, sound, and qi shall instantly dissolve into dust.
Dare any resist or defy? Lightning and thunder shall strike them down.
Hasten, hasten, as the statutes command!

Offer three sticks of incense, pour the libation, and bow according to ritual—with utmost sincerity, none shall fail to be moved.

**Prohibitions**
On the six *wu* days, divination is forbidden; any attempt will yield no verification.

**Ascending Prosperity** Divination – *Great Passage* Hexagram  1-1-1
*From small to great, without stumbling or collapse.*
*From low to high, attaining wealth and eminence.*

*Fitting to journey forth, inauspicious to conceal one’s brilliance.*
Yan says: *Aspiring from small to great may lead to wealth and nobility. If the great aspires to the small, there will be peril and ruin.*
He also says: *Heaven and Earth having taken their places, the sage harmonizes with them. Ordering the primordial chaos, inaugurating the origin of creation—thus it is said: from low to high.*

*Establishing merit and creating systems, nothing is not auspicious. Secret schemes and covert plans are inadvisable; the elderly, the ill, and marriage unions are unfavorable, for pure yang is difficult to harmonize. Travelers have not returned; those imprisoned will be released; merchants profit.*

He says: *For official advancement, visibility is auspicious, concealment inauspicious. The ill should not remain in dark places; it is fortunate to avoid them by going elsewhere. Slander brings no harm; households prosper greatly. Military campaigns are auspicious; battles are victorious. Pregnancies yield sons; fields, silkworms, fishing, and hunting bring great bounty. All is auspicious.*

Explanation: *From small to great—yang begins to grow. Three hearts in accord—journeying forth is fitting. Inauspicious to conceal brilliance—its way is radiant. This divination’s three positions are all yang; lesser yang is just rising, thus the image of ascending from small to great, from low to high. Those who obtain it—whether initiating enterprises, seeking fame, or pursuing profit—all is auspicious. Litigants should seek justice through upright means; travelers are fortunate but have not yet returned. Secretive or deceptive schemes must not be undertaken. The ill will worsen; avoiding them brings fortune.*

**Gradual Peace** Divination – *Receiving Blessings* Hexagram  1-1-2
*Dwelling in tranquility, establishing one’s enterprise—possessions increase. Both wealthy and noble, though emolument and rank have not yet arrived.*

Yan says: *Calm the heart and steady the will to await the seasons—then all will be auspicious. If one seeks hasty fulfillment, it will not come to pass.*
He also says: *Yin and yang having taken their rightful places, the Dao of Heaven and Earth is thus attained by humanity. This is the image of settling into one’s vocation. Seeking office, pursuing wealth, managing fields and silkworms—all are auspicious. Marriage is initially difficult but later easy. Travelers will arrive; households are at peace. Legal matters do not come to fruition; imprisoned persons will be released through effort.*

He says: *Distant travelers arrive; pregnancies yield sons. Legal matters and imprisonment will be absolved by imperial pardon. The ill will not die; all affairs are auspicious.*

Explanation: *Dwelling in tranquility and managing property—firmness and softness are balanced. This is not desired outwardly, yet blessings are received in reality. In this divination, two yang are above and one yin below; the positions of the Three Powers are all fitting. Thus the image of being both wealthy and noble—it is fitting to preserve this and not indulge in insatiable desires, then all will be auspicious. Households and marriages are settled; legal matters encounter no obstruction. Travelers have not returned; seeking office leads to attainment and governance. Hearing of misfortune, one need not grieve; though illness has not yet abated, it brings no harm.*

**Abundant Fortune** Divination – *Auspicious Celebration* Hexagram  1-1-3
*Resplendent and illustrious, the household possesses gold and silk. Supplies are complete, affairs are settled—without seeking, one obtains.*

Yan says: *Having gold and silk, there is no need for seeking. Dwelling at home is auspicious; travelers have not returned.*
He also says: *Heaven generates the myriad things—its principle is ever-abundant. Without need for striving, all naturally comes to fruition. This hexagram is pure yang; marriages are not harmonious. The imprisoned are without guilt; fields and silkworms succeed. All other affairs are auspicious.*

He says: *Travelers are about to arrive; pregnancies yield sons. Merchants profit; legal matters and imprisonment are absolved by pardon. Pursuits and suppressions all succeed.*

**Explication:**
*Resplendent and illustrious*—this is pure yang. *The household possesses gold and silk*—the earthly Dao shines. *Supplies are complete, affairs are settled*—its power is abundant and strong. *Without seeking, one obtains*—its fruitfulness flourishes. This hexagram has three yang lines with the lower position thriving; the earthly Dao produces things, thus gold and silk overflow and affairs are settled. The fullness of yang is rooted below, while lesser yang rises above—like a tree with a flourishing root and abundant fruit, hence the image of obtaining without seeking. For one who casts this divination, all pursuits are auspicious. Managing property is most favorable; in war, great victory; in pursuit, the fugitive is captured. In litigation, one spends wealth but prevails; in illness, it is inauspicious; those in hiding cannot escape.

**Divination – *Abundant Prosperity***
Hexagram 4
*Abundant wealth, utmost nobility—the Dao of Heaven turns and shifts. Following the course, rising and falling, waxing with the times, waning with the seasons. Descendants by the tens of thousands, by the hundreds of millions.*

Yan says: *One who dwells in wealth and nobility yet does not forget poverty and lowliness will have a name that flows to posterity. If one cannot practice humility and retreat, ruin will surely come. Travelers are on the road; it will be long before they return.*
He also says: *From the second to the fourth line, the earthly Dao is twice fulfilled. The principle of wealth and nobility reaches its apex here. Yet when fullness is attained, it must wane; when high, it is perilous—hence "turns and shifts." If one follows the ebb and flow of yin and yang, not opposing the times, one can preserve body and reputation, and blessings will extend to descendants. This hexagram favors humility and retreat; prisoners will have difficulty leaving. Those awaiting others will face slight delays; travelers will not depart.*

He says: *The ill will recover slowly; it is fitting to sacrifice to the heavenly spirits and seek blessings. Marriages and weddings are auspicious; those accumulating wealth should not add further. Distant travel is inadvisable; hasty words may lead to official disputes—it is best to seek those who uphold the law.*

**Explication:**
*Abundant wealth, utmost nobility*—the household’s enterprise is complete. *Following the course, rising and falling*—to preserve fullness. *Descendants by the tens of thousands*—it is not fitting to contend. This divination has yang above and old yin below, with upper and lower in their proper places. It bears the image of position and substance, wealth and nobility at their peak, with nothing left to add. Thus, one should follow the course of the times, know contentment, and avoid recklessness—then one may preserve one’s own success, and descendants will guard it without loss. Marriages are auspicious; seeking office, pursuing wealth, and awaiting matters have all reached fruition—one must not overreach. Those awaiting travelers should cease, for it is auspicious; in official matters, seek harmony—if pressed further, there will be regret. Illness will recover; in war, one should not act rashly—if an encounter occurs, halting is auspicious. Trust in others is lacking; when matters reach their extreme, they must reverse. What was auspicious may turn inauspicious, and what was inauspicious may turn auspicious. The Dao of joy and harmony leads to the *Surprise and Delight* Hexagram.

---

**Divination – *Surprise and Delight***
Hexagram 1-2-
*Firm without, yielding within—harmony and unity are all-encompassing. Nurturing nature, preserving life, roaming with the spirits.*

Yan says: *What is sought is contrary; one should only preserve oneself. The ill have not recovered; it is fitting to make offerings and pray—there is no cause for worry. Official duties will not advance; matters will not succeed. Prisoners will have difficulty leaving.*
He also says: *Marriages are auspicious; pregnancies yield sons. The ill should seek the spirits; merchants profit; in war, great fortune.*

He says: *Yin occupies a yang position—hence "firm without." One should not force advancement; nurturing nature and preserving life is the image of self-sufficiency.*

**Explication:**
*Firm without, yielding within*—it is fitting to be in accord with others. *Planning carefully, acting cautiously*—to preserve one’s whole person. *Roaming with the spirits*—this is not inauspicious. This divination has one yin line amid two yang lines, hence the image of firmness without and yielding within. Yin occupies a yang position—it is not fitting to act. Thus, one should harmonize, be circumspect, and preserve—then it is auspicious. In illness, there are malevolent spirits; sacrifices are auspicious. Litigation will not succeed; marriages and commerce are auspicious. In war, do not fight; prisoners will have difficulty leaving. Rumors are often false and deceitful—secret plans are fitting. The *Fright* Hexagram leads to *Minor Peril.*

---

**Divination – *Fright***
Hexagram 1-2-2
*A rooster crows at noon, climbing the roof and stretching its neck. The hen is below the wall—startled by a fox. Cutting off its cry, it flees—its body is spared harm.*

Yan says: *In all matters, initial difficulty and distress will ultimately bring no other misfortune. In all undertakings, there is first ruin, then success. Travelers have not arrived; illness should be treated early.*
He also says: *The upper responds to the lower, but is blocked by the middle—unable to aid one another, hence the fright. Yet, dwelling in a high position, it ultimately controls and governs; cutting off its cry, it flees—disaster is averted.*

The male belongs to yang, the female to yin—the natural predator of chickens is none other than the fox. This hexagram portends that official matters will not succeed, and prisoners will only be released with powerful assistance.

He says: Travelers may encounter bandits; seeking office, marriage, or trade will all be unfavorable. Borrowing or seeking aid will be difficult, and desires will be thwarted. Fields and silkworms will yield no harvest. In all matters, there will first be worry, then good fortune.

Explanation: One male and one female—there is secret contention. The firm and strong reside above, and the yielding cannot overpower them. Moving in accord with the proper response ensures no collapse. This divination shows a young yang occupying the honored position, while the two yin below both desire to act. The upper and lower correspond but are blocked by the middle, hence the image of the rooster crowing atop the roof while the hen below is startled by a fox. Yet, as yang holds the superior position and governs, and the middle yin is not yet dominant, they ultimately unite without harm or ruin. Divined affairs will require effort—first peril, then peace. Travelers will return but face obstacles midway. Military campaigns will bring fear; illness should be treated urgently. Seeking office or marriage will be obstructed by others. One must rely on the powerful—all will first be difficult, then obtained.

**Abundance – *Year of Plenty***
Hexagram 1-2-3
*First month, noon hour—year in Great Beam. The east wind thaws the ice; plowing and mulberry thrive. By year’s end, the harvest will be abundant, and joy will be boundless.*

Yan says: For all endeavors, the years, months, and days of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* will be auspicious, though results may come slowly. Without these years, months, or days, fields and silkworms will not prosper, yet no misfortune will arise.
He also says: This is the image of yin departing and yang arriving—the year resides in the *you* month, Great Beam.
The *Diagnosis* says: When the Great Year is in *you*, even begging for water yields wine—such is its abundance.
This hexagram governs fields and silkworms as auspicious. Officials will not yet attain their posts, but those in office will have no worries; the ill will suffer no harm.

He says: Travel by water or land, marriage, and harmony—all are greatly auspicious, the hexagram of talent.
Explanation: Heaven and humanity are in harmony, yin following yang. The land is fertile and expansive—fitting for fields and mulberry. At the juncture of *wu* and *you*, fortune is unstoppable. This divination shows young yang above, with young yin in the middle following it—the positions of heaven and humanity are proper. Vigorous yang occupies the earthly position; above is harmony, below is abundance, hence fields and silkworms thrive. The "first month" refers to the initial line, and "Great Beam" is *you*. The lower three form *Li*, which is *wu*; the middle two form *Dui*, which is *you*. All divined affairs will proceed as desired, with results manifesting in the years, months, or days of *wu* and *you*, or in the *you* direction.

**Minor Excess – *Minor Success***
Hexagram 1-2-4
*Disaster arises from below—beware a single servant. Secret plots converge, hands and feet poised to act.*

Yan says: Though yang holds its position, it is plotted against by the many yin. Thus, a servant harbors secret schemes to cause harm. Be wary of those nearby. This hexagram portends worry in all matters, though no great misfortune will arise. Official affairs will nearly conclude, but prisoners will struggle to be freed—due to yang’s weakness.

He says: Travelers will encounter bandits; those at home will face troubles. Servants will cause harm; groups will stir gossip. Endeavors will not succeed; the ill will be cursed by subordinates.
Explanation: A solitary yang above is weak in power. Yin thrives within the household—there is concern over servants. This divination shows one yang above, with strong yin below and young yin in the middle. The weak and yielding cannot control what lies beneath, hence the image of disaster arising from below—beware the servant. All divined affairs will be unfavorable. This and the sixth hexagram both feature one yang above, yet their divinations differ. In the latter, the lower position is young yin, which harbors the intent to follow above but is blocked by the middle. Here, however, the yin is mature, acting wantonly below, and the middle cannot restrain it. It is like a weak husband and young wife managing a household, where fierce servants and defiant maids refuse their master’s commands—its inauspiciousness is self-evident.

**Attaining Aspirations – *Self-Sufficiency***
Hexagram 1-3-1
*Ambitions clearly attained, in harmony with the times. Wealth and resources are abundant, with no lack of servants.*

Yan says: Aspirations are fulfilled, resources are sufficient, and servants are at hand.
He also says: Pure yang governs—this is the image of attaining aspirations. With utmost impartiality in heart, wealth and resources are fully provided.
Master Han says: When King Wen campaigned against Chong, he reached the ruins of Yellow Crane. His sandal strap broke, and as he turned to fix it, all around him were worthy men—none could be dispatched, so he tied it himself. This is the way of the noble person, holding to the Dao of utmost impartiality.

He says: Officials will enjoy abundant emoluments; distant travelers will arrive. The ill will recover; prisoners will be freed. Pregnant women will bear sons; trade will be profitable. This is the image of great success in all endeavors.
Explanation: The dragon attains the proper center—greatly in accord with the times. Above and below harmonize and follow, sufficient for great deeds. This divination shows vigorous yang occupying its position, attaining aspirations and the times, with the young yang above and below united in purpose. What worry could there be over insufficient resources or lack of servants? For the diviner, nothing sought will not be obtained—this is the most auspicious of divinations.

**Fulfillment – *Coming Prosperity***
Hexagram 1-3-2
*Once desires were unmet—now they are fulfilled. All things attain their proper order; affairs proceed with clarity.*

Yan says: First, one attains aspirations, with loyalty and goodness as the foundation. Private matters are not fitting. Travelers will return; the ill will recover.
He also says: The positions of the Three Powers are correct; yin and yang are harmonious. This is the Dao of the noble person—here, it is prosperity. Promotion and longevity will increase; trade will be profitable. All affairs will be auspicious.

He says: Marriage and harmony will unite; undertakings will greatly succeed. Fields and silkworms will thrive; the distressed will attain their aspirations. Prisoners will be freed; endeavors will fulfill desires. Travelers will arrive soon. Affairs proceed with clarity—all things attain their proper order.
Explanation: *Once desires were unmet*—the yielding was within.

The yang flourishes and acts externally—this is the time of opening and prosperity. Upright and selfless, its Dao thus becomes great. In this divination, the positions of the Three Powers are correct, yin and yang harmonize, and the noble person’s single Dao prospers. One should not engage in private or hidden matters but rather in upright and magnanimous affairs. The diviner who obtains this will find great fortune.

**Talent Flourishes, Divination of Peace and Auspiciousness** *(1-3-3)*
Abundant are the scholars, their virtuous power shining brightly.
Meetings bring joy, lasting happiness without misfortune.

Yan says: One advances by talent and will receive aid from noble persons. By year’s end, success will come, and its strength will not be singular. The ill will recover, travelers return, and all affairs will be auspicious. If one seeks audience with kings or lords or pursues fame, it will be even better.

He says: Seeking office will fulfill aspirations; travelers will arrive. Trade, fields, and silkworms will be profitable; marriages will be auspicious. The ill will recover, legal matters will not succeed—this divination is highly favorable.

Explanation: *Abundant are the scholars*—they follow those above. *Meetings bring joy*—the journey will be honored. In this divination, one yang occupies the upper position, while the middle and lower positions are all three yang. This resembles a ruler possessing firm and enlightened virtue, with many worthy followers. For commoners, it signifies the assistance of noble persons and good friends. Divining for office, meeting superiors, marriage, trade, or military affairs—all will be auspicious. In warfare, one will gain worthy allies; in endeavors, one will receive assistance—all is fortunate.

**Leisure Divination, Divination of Joyful Travel** *(1-3-4)*
Riding dragons and driving steeds, roaming the four directions.
Joyful and content, boundless delight in travel.

Yan says: Follow your heart’s desires—east, west, south, or north—nearly all matters will succeed. Travelers have not yet returned; the ill will recover on their own. *The Book of Changes* says: *At the right time, ride the six dragons to govern the heavens.* It also says: *The mare belongs to the earthly kind, traveling the earth without bounds.*

He says: Lost thieves and stolen goods will be recovered; a male child will be born. Trade will be profitable; marriage will naturally align. Fields and silkworms will flourish; those in bonds will have no worries—all affairs will be resolved.

Explanation: *Riding dragons and driving steeds*—the lower submits and supports. *Roaming the four directions*—none dare oppose me. In this divination, one yang resides above, while the middle and lower positions are balanced. The three yang are dragons, the four yin are steeds—each finds its proper place and serves me. Thus, one may roam the four directions, delighting without end. The diviner who obtains this should boldly advance. Only in inquiring about travelers will they not return, though they will fare well abroad.

**Worry Divination, Divination of Isolation** *(1-4-1)*
Above alone, below solitary—schemed against by the treacherous.
The illness of the heart’s chamber cannot be swiftly cured.
Only when the season of yang spring arrives will one regain freedom.

Yan says: One will constantly harbor fear, dreading harm, but with the rescue of a noble person, all will ultimately be without fault. For the ill, recovery will come in the second or third month. It is also said: Two yang are separated by layers of yin, beyond aid. This resembles treacherous ministers usurping power, first harming petty men. It is an omen of worry and harm—few affairs will be auspicious, and travelers will encounter obstacles.

He says: Managing property will not be auspicious; one will be plotted against by thieves. The ill will recover slowly; prisoners will not be released—this divination is slightly inauspicious.

Explanation: *Above alone, below solitary*—yin flourishes within. Petty men create barriers, and aspirations cannot be communicated. Upholding integrity and awaiting the right time will preserve the center. In this divination, the upper and lower positions are both one yang, while four yin reside in the middle, forming a clique of petty men. This is the omen of the true Dao being obstructed. All divined matters will face barriers and misfortune. One should uphold integrity to guard against disaster. This resembles the fifth divination, but here, the worry arises because the four yin form a clique, their power vast and difficult to remove. Thus, one must wait for the yang season, when the solitary yang’s assistance arrives, to resolve the crisis.

**Vigilance Divination, Divination of Thieves** *(1-4-2)*
Heaven and earth are vast and relaxed; petty men act freely.
Prohibitions are unenforced; thieves invade my home.

Yan says: One will lose property, and the head of the household will fall ill, recovering only by autumn. This divination greatly favors upholding integrity; it is not suitable for pursuing affairs. Travelers have no set return date; those chasing fugitives will not succeed.

He says: Medicine will not benefit the ill; legal matters will not be resolved lightly. Seeking wealth will yield little profit; one must guard against thieves at home—this divination is highly inauspicious.

Explanation: *Heaven and earth are vast and relaxed*—laws and orders are implemented. *Thieves invade my home*—one cannot oversee them. The sigh of the noble person is the joy of the petty man. In this divination, a multitude of yin surrounds one yang. Yin flourishes in the middle position, and though the lower originally responds to the upper, it is blocked by the middle and instead allies with it. Thus, the noble person’s chamber is occupied by thieves. The diviner should guard against thieves. Matters of home, property, trade, office, warfare, or travel—all will be inauspicious. Only in fleeing or hiding will one find fortune.

**Destroying Thieves, Divination of Enforcing Orders** *(1-4-3)*
The lord’s command oversees affairs, punishing and eliminating treachery and villainy.
Wielding spears and brandishing halberds, great undertakings will follow.

Yan says: One should be employed by others or employ others; acting independently will lead to failure. The ill are afflicted by spirits—exorcism is advisable. Travelers are safe; pursuing them will be auspicious. Divining for suppressing rebels or capturing fugitives will ensure victory. Treachery within, villainy without—this divination favors small victories over great ones. Trade will be profitable; seeking office will succeed. Fields, silkworms, and marriages will all be auspicious.

He says: The king’s punitive expeditions will prove effective. Legal matters will resolve themselves; no affairs will be inauspicious.

Explanation: *Yin obstructs the middle*—seeking to rectify it. *The lord’s command punishes*—military strength is abundant. *Wielding spears and brandishing halberds*—to strike at illness. In this divination, yin obstructs the middle, but the lord’s command to punish it is backed by formidable force. Thus, one wields weapons to eliminate harm. The diviner who obtains this will find great success in advancing.

In this divination, a single yang occupies its proper position above, while three yang forces flourish below, with four yin forces residing in the middle. Though yin seeks to obstruct, the three yang powers unite in virtue. Thus, yin’s treachery is exposed, giving rise to the image of the lord’s command and officers mobilizing to eliminate villainy and calamity. For military campaigns or capturing fugitives, great victory is assured. The sick will recover upon treatment; in legal disputes, the righteous will prevail. Travelers will remain unharmed; obstacles will be overcome. All undertakings will be auspicious.

**Defeated in Battle: The General’s Loss Hexagram**
*One-Four-Four*
Jackals and tigers roar,
Endless rains flood the land.
Battles yield no victory,
Weak troops and valiant warriors alike.
Overwhelmed by raiders,
Many perish or flee.

Yan says: To weaken one and strengthen another—both defy principle. All affairs grow difficult; travelers should return. Mid-journey, terror strikes; punitive expeditions are ill-advised.

He also says: Yin’s influence grows ever stronger, while the lord’s Way daily wanes. Jackals and tigers, external raiders, connect on all sides—enemies cannot be overcome.

He says: Regional lords guard the borders, yet officials fall prey to bandits. Even atop high ridges, they suffer deluges. The sick grow gravely ill; prisoners remain firmly bound; lawsuits stall. Cycles repeat endlessly. Trade, fields, silkworms, and seeking office—all prove unfavorable.

Explanation: Jackals roar and waters overflow—yang’s path stands alone. Great villains conspire together, their peril beyond rescue. In this divination, a single yang perches atop accumulated yin, hence the images of roaring jackals and ceaseless rain. All affairs turn inauspicious; deploying troops is most ill-omened. Only in times of great drought will prayers for rain succeed.

**Three Images, Upper Sixteen Hexagrams.**
**Divine Aid: The Spirit’s Protection Hexagram**
*Two-One-One*

The Great Unity deploys troops, the Jade Maiden stands beside. The shaman becomes an immortal master, dispelling misfortune.

Yan says: The household’s elder will fall ill, for a female ghost brings harm—best to perform exorcism. Most affairs remain obscure; even the traveler cannot return for this reason.

It is also said: The celestial deity, the Venerable Great Unity, has the Jade Maiden as his aide, while Wu Xian was a worthy minister of Yin. These are but auspicious titles. This hexagram brings fortune through prayers and exorcisms. If the sick are afflicted by spirits, hasten to dispel them. Seeking office, pursuing matters, trade, and marriage—all prove favorable.

He says: The traveler arrives soon; no harm comes from slander. Legal troubles end without worry, and one gains human aid. Best to seek blessings and avert calamity—what is undertaken will succeed.

Explanation: The Great Unity deploys troops to dispel misfortune. Yang, though solitary amid yin, does not long abide with evil. Here, though yin resides above, two yang lines find fellowship, forming a united resolve to expel wickedness. The upper yin, in turn, serves our purpose—hence the omen of the Great Unity leading troops. The Jade Maiden at his side mirrors the radiant aid of Wu Xian. Though affairs may seem doubtful, one ultimately gains friends’ assistance to succeed. The sick recover through exorcism; the traveler returns; battles end in great victory.

**Decaying Hexagram of the Seduced General**
*Two-One-Two*
Two women, one man—above and below drive each other. Yin’s qi seizes yang, leading to depletion and emptiness.

Yan says: Man and woman clash; marriage begins but later dissolves. Though the traveler returns, bandits await on the road.

It is also said: The outer is no Jade Maiden, the inner betrays the Great Unity. One yang, subdued by two yin, forms a hexagram of depletion. The sick grow worse.

He says: What is sought brings no benefit; what is done fails to harmonize. The traveler does not arrive; silkworms and fields yield no hope. Legal troubles prove hard to resolve; the sick worsen. All affairs turn greatly inauspicious.

Explanation: Two women, one man—yang is trapped by yin. It resists essence yet surrenders to seduction, leading to depletion and ruin. Here, one yang is ensnared between two yin. Both yin and yang are weak; the lesser seeks union, but yang cannot rise, overpowered by yin, hastening depletion. All matters divined under this sign prove ill-fated.

**Rectifying Hexagram of Disciplined Order**
*Two-Zero-Three*
Heaven darkens, clouds ascend; yang stirs from below. The noble governs chaos; the petty fear punishment.

Yan says: Yin usurps yang’s place, rising like clouds. Mighty yang lies below, poised to ascend to the ninth five. It quells rebellion and restrains violence—all evil dissipates. Minor punishments serve as great warnings. This hexagram excels in governance; all affairs begin with worry but end in joy.

He says: What is sought is not obtained; what is done does not succeed. Upholding justice to quell chaos, the petty fear guilt. The sick do not recover; the traveler returns but gains no profit, only slander.

Explanation: Heaven darkens, clouds ascend—like a dragon leaping from the abyss. Using rectitude to expel evil is like water flowing in order. Here, though yin and yang are misplaced, one yang stands at the center, three yang below, forming the image of the noble governing chaos and the firm overcoming the yielding. Divined for governance, civil rule, pursuing fugitives, or quelling rebellion—all prove auspicious. Lawsuits end in righteous victory; secrecy brings no good. For the noble, this is greatly fortunate; for the petty, the opposite holds.

**Unreturned Hexagram of Exile**
*Two-Zero-Four*
Fields lie barren, earth grows hollow; the people relocate. Awaiting a bountiful year, they return to their homes.

Yan says: This hexagram marks yin’s extreme rise, which yang cannot restrain. Fields lie waste, people scatter—only in a year of plenty do they return. The sick recover slowly; silkworms and fields prove unfavorable.

He says: Officials lose emoluments; travelers do not return. Silkworms and fields lose their capital. Though this hexagram is not auspicious, it cannot harm. Best to endure poverty and remain tranquil—seeking blessings brings good fortune.

Explanation: Fields lie barren, earth grows hollow—nothing to rely upon. The petty harbor divergent desires, never uniting. Upholding rectitude and awaiting the moment, one surely attains their place. Here, yang is trapped by yin, while the lower position teems with yin—hence the image of barren fields, hollow earth, and fleeing people. Yet the lower yin, being mature, does not seek union. The petty, having their way, reach their limit and decline, while the lesser yin above instead aligns with us—thus, one ultimately returns to the old home. All affairs meet obstruction; remaining tranquil and awaiting the right time brings good fortune.

**Cautionary Hexagram of Hoarded Wealth**
*Two-Two-One*
Burying gold and hiding jade, one boasts of supreme nobility. Ghostly debts remain unpaid; the spirits withhold blessings.

Yan says: Yang is deemed noble, hence "gold and jade." Boasting of supreme nobility, the spirits do not protect. The sick are haunted by ghosts—best to hasten exorcism. Legal troubles require human aid to resolve.

He says: Hoarding wealth invites calamity. Though treasures exist, one must fear bandits. The sick do not recover; travelers do not return. Prisoners remain confined; silkworms and fields yield no harvest. Deploying troops brings no advantage—one is seized by ghosts. This is ill-fated.

Explanation: Burying gold and hiding treasure—yang lies below. The ghostly path ascends; blessings cannot be borrowed. Here, a solitary yang is suppressed beneath two yang, unable to act. Two yin above, weak and yielding, take this as their treasure—thus, no blessings come, only worries. The diviner must expect ruin from greed.

**Peaceful Hexagram of the Adorned Garden**
*Two-Two-Two*
The year is abundant, the month prosperous; fields and lands expand. Steadfast as Mount Tai, no misfortune befalls in the end.

Yan says: Broadly open the fields, awaiting the year’s end. Divide heaven and earth—no calamity or fault arises. Unshaken, steadfast as Mount Tai. At home, all is auspicious; silkworms and fields yield great harvests. The sick suffer no pain; the traveler has not returned.

He says: Holding office, one enjoys emoluments; wealth and silk come of their own accord. Troops prevail in battle; the pregnant bear sons. Those with learning—this hexagram is greatly auspicious.

**Explication:**
"Abundant year, prosperous month"—all share the same aspiration. Gentle and yielding, favorable and upright, blessings know no end. "Steadfast as Mount Tai"—beginning and end are as one. This divination’s three positions are all yin, yet attain central correctness, bearing the image of dwelling in peace, abiding in compliance, and harboring no external desires. Thus, fortune prevails, misfortune vanishes. For inquiries into household affairs, fields and silkworms, official posts, or market trade—all are greatly auspicious. In campaigns, land is gained; the sick recover without treatment; lawsuits incur no blame; the traveler has not yet returned.

**Heavenly Emolument Divination: Hexagram of Rising Fortune**
*Two-Two-Three*
Receiving Heaven’s emolument, ascending like the sun. From youth in office, rank and stipend flourish.

Yan says: Auspicious for seeking wealth at home; the traveler has not returned. The sick should perform exorcisms; offer sacrifices to seek blessings. It is also said: Heavy yin stirs into motion, ascending like the sun—this approaches pure auspiciousness. Not suitable for reclusion or rebellion. In market trade or hiring servants, desires are difficult to fulfill; the rest is auspicious.

He says: Endeavors are lofty and distant, all coming to fruition. The sick suffer no pain; military campaigns are fortunate. Favorable for praying to the stars; all plans succeed. No matter should be kept secret.

**Explication:**
Yang flourishes below, strength following softness. Cultivating virtue and refining conduct, one receives Heaven’s favor. In this divination, two yin reside above while vigorous yang lies below, advancing upward—an image of the sun’s ascent. For seeking office or advancement, it is greatly auspicious. This divination is purely fortunate, except for reclusion, exile, market trade, or servants.

**Abundant Wealth Divination: Hexagram of Unimpeded Prosperity**
*Two-Two-Four*
Wealth like a wellspring, though used, never exhausted. All sought is attained; joy knows no end.

Yan says: All matters are auspicious; at home, there are celebrations. The traveler returns soon; wealth flows like a wellspring, inexhaustible in use. All desires are fulfilled, bringing unparalleled joy.

He says: Officials attain high promotion; livelihoods grow rich and ample. Fields and silkworms yield double harvests; good fortune and joy abound. The sick recover; prisoners are released—this hexagram is greatly auspicious.

**Explication:**
"Wealth like a wellspring"—one gains the advantage of the land. Softness and compliance move above and below; nothing sought goes unfulfilled. In this divination, the lower position is rich in yin, not clashing with the upper, thus forming the image of fertile land. The two yin, gentle and compliant above, do not act recklessly but enjoy peace—hence their prosperity is unceasing. All inquiries into matters are auspicious.

**Later Fortune Divination: Hexagram of Sorrow and Joy**
*Two-Three-One*
The heart bears sorrow, restless and sleepless. Fearing calamity, fortune arrives instead. Celebration and joy bring great benefit.

Yan says: Initially there is sorrow, but in the end, joy. It is also said: Yin occupies Heaven’s position, where it does not belong. Thus, though there is sorrow, the three yang unite to resist, unable to cause harm. This hexagram brings minor sorrow first, then great fortune—hence no blame.

He says: Gossip comes to nothing; the traveler is on the way. In marriage or trade, difficulty precedes ease. The sick first suffer, then recover; legal matters turn from ill to good; lost items are hard to retrieve.

**Explication:**
Yin overpowers yang—its position is not esteemed. Anxiety subsides, and fortune is gained through firmness in the center. In this divination, yin occupies the upper position while yang resides below—an image of misplaced position. Yet one yang lies below, vigorous and centrally situated, while weak yin cannot restrain strength. Initially, there is doubt, but in the end, good fortune prevails. All matters begin with sorrow but conclude with joy—sorrow is empty, fortune is real.

**Peaceful Divination: Hexagram of Latent Flow**
*Two-Three-Two*
Above and below are at peace; the heart harbors no deceit. Upright and free from worry, do not heed rumors.

Yan says: A righteous heart brings good fortune; do not believe rumors. The traveler arrives; prisoners are released. Though this hexagram has yin above and below, three yang reside in the center. Initially, there is worry, but each abides in its place—no regrets remain. All matters proceed naturally; sorrow precedes joy. Serving rulers and forming alliances is especially good.

He says: Marrying brings a fine wife; the traveler is on the way. The pregnant bear sons; the sick encounter strange omens but suffer no harm. Legal matters dissipate; fields and silkworms prosper. In campaigns, trade, and all matters—greatly auspicious.

**Explication:**
Above and below are both soft, relying on the central ruler. Upright and unyielding, they gain the people’s support. In this divination, three yang occupy the center while above and below are yin. Lesser yin is not yet dominant, avoiding conflict and fostering harmony. Yang’s vigor and yin’s abundance cannot prevail—thus the image of universal peace, with omens but no misfortune.

**Averting Evil Divination: Hexagram of Flourishing Virtue**
*Two-Three-Three*
The multitude loves me, warding off calamity. Fierce dogs do not bite; ten thousand things come to fruition.

Yan says: All matters are auspicious, gaining others’ assistance. The traveler returns; wealth is acquired; at home, all is fortunate. It is also said: Though yin resides above, it is not in its rightful place. Yet yang’s vigor prevails, able to dispel misfortune—all love it. In the three preceding hexagrams, yin usurps yang’s position, but virtue is not lacking. Cultivating it brings good fortune; sorrows cause no suffering.

He says: High ministers and regional lords gain worthy aides. Marrying secures a virtuous wife. The sick recover; prisoners are released; others lend assistance. In war, victory is won; the pregnant bear sons; trade is profitable.

**Explication:**
Modesty and brilliance reside above—all find them lovable. Worthy aides assist in succession, ensuring no harm.

Here the yin resides in the upper position yet does not wield its power. The host of yang below remains steadfast and upright, free from perversity. Though fierce dogs do not bite, they instead serve to ward off misfortune for me. In divination, one gains the support of many, ensuring success through their aid.

**Hexagram of Great Capture, Governing Things** (2-3-4)
The Han Lu hound pursues the hare—its steps cannot stretch forth. The biting dog lies ahead; the pursuer follows behind. Layer upon layer, they press so closely that escape is impossible.

Yan says: At home, all is auspicious; the traveler returns, arriving both before and after. It is also said: The three yang reside in the center, able to restrain the multitude of lesser forces. The fierce dog’s pursuit of the hare leaves no room for flight—speaking of success in the turn of a heel. In all matters, what begins small will grow great. This hexagram favors the capture of fugitives, the pursuit of wealth (which will be abundant), and divination concerning property. For illness, it bodes ill.

He says: Officials and those in sericulture all find their pursuits favorable; travelers meet with good fortune. The sick grow distressed; prisoners remain confined; legal matters prove difficult to resolve; military campaigns return empty-handed. It is also said: Though this path is arduous, why sigh over toil and labor? Cast your line into the deep pool, and you shall surely land a great turtle.

**Explication:**
The three yang occupy the center—vigorous Dao prevails. Though the petty man is yielding, he cannot contend. Even if he seeks to leap and surge, in the end, he submits to fate. In this divination, though the three yang are situated amid two yin, with lesser yin above and elder yin below, the desires of old and young differ. They are constrained by the firm and cannot act. Thus, it takes the form of the Han Lu hound pursuing the hare. For the diviner, it is highly auspicious for capturing fugitives, suppressing rebels, seeking wealth, pursuing profit, and marriage. Travel will meet with obstacles; prisoners will find it hard to escape; the sick will be in grave danger; at home, there is no misfortune. Most matters will come to fruition, but attempts at resolution will fail.

**Hexagram of Decline and Revival** (2-4-1)
The sagely and the worthy succeed one another; the faint revives and flourishes anew. Like the melon vine stretching endlessly, it gradually ascends.

Yan says: Affairs that were askew now reunite; seekers obtain what is hidden; all things follow the heart’s desire. It is also said: Though yang is faint and weak, its aspiration lies in uprightness. Rising from below to above, it resembles the melon vine’s tendrils, extending ceaselessly upward. With a sincere heart in one’s endeavors, one revives what is fading and restores what is broken. This hexagram favors official promotion, the bestowal of grace and fortune, and the seeking of heirs.

He says: Studies come to fruition; the traveler arrives soon. Sericulture yields great harvests; trade is profitable; the wife one marries is virtuous and fair; officials ascend in rank; all desires are fulfilled. The sick grow distressed—praying to the spirits will bring good fortune. Lost items will not be recovered.

**Explication:**
Yin flourishes in the center, but when it reaches its extreme, it must decline. Like the melon vine stretching endlessly, yang returns. Gradually ascending, the upright Dao is restored. In this divination, lesser yang resides beneath the host of yin, perilously isolated. Yet lesser yin lies above, with elder yin in the center—they lack the will to unite. The petty man, though at his peak, is doomed to discord, while lesser yang rises from below. As they wane, it advances, like the melon vine’s ceaseless ascent—a sign of revival after decline and the restoration of order. All matters bode well.

**Hexagram of Avoiding Disaster** (2-4-2)
Summer departs, autumn arrives; frost brings calamity. Birds and beasts grow thick fur; grasses and trees shed their leaves.

Yan says: In all matters, spring’s beginning follows the heart’s desire; at home, all is auspicious; the traveler has not yet returned. It is also said: Summer emerges, autumn retreats—yang scatters as yin reaches its peak. Thus, birds and beasts shed their fur, grasses and trees fade in color. The noble man, in a time of obscurity and stillness, cannot advance with the affairs of the age. This divination leans toward misfortune.

He says: Officials face unjust accusations; prisoners and rebels harm one another. The sick grow distressed; military campaigns meet with misfortune; legal matters are hard to resolve; travelers do not return; livelihoods are lost; there is gossip, theft, and banditry.

**Explication:**
Summer departs, autumn arrives—yin qi flourishes. Grasses and trees wither and yellow; stillness preserves uprightness. In this divination, the host of yin holds sway, with elder yin in the center—a time when the noble man’s Dao is obstructed. The diviner should withdraw, remain still, and guard their integrity; seeking advancement will not bring good fortune. All matters will fail to achieve their aims; the sick will face great distress.

**Hexagram of Enlightening the Obscure** (2-4-3)
Yin at its extreme transforms into yang; hibernating creatures stir and emerge. The imperial pardon is proclaimed; the bells and drums resound grandly.

Yan says: Through yin, yang is aroused; reverently employing the multitude of creatures is like striking bells and drums to grant broad amnesty, opening the gates of the dark prison. This is the hexagram governed by the celestial immortals. It is highly auspicious for official advancement but ill-suited for marriage, for yin and yang injure one another and lack harmony.

Sunzi says: Do not intercept a formation with banners arrayed in perfect order; do not strike a battle line drawn up in full strength.

He says: Imperial grace descends; prisoners are released; officials attain high rank; livelihoods multiply tenfold.

**Explication:**
Yin at its extreme transforms into yang—thunder arises from within the earth. The bells and drums resound grandly—the voice of virtue spreads far. In this divination, the three yang succeed the yin at its peak, like the thunderclap that awakens hibernating creatures—a time when the noble man’s Dao flourishes. All matters bode well; when deploying troops, it is fitting to display civil virtue.

**Hexagram of Hidden Illness** (2-4-4)
Yin’s excess brings minor illness; one lies prostrate, filled with sorrow. Gazing upward at the heavens, then bowing low in submission.

Yan says: One’s desires are unfulfilled; the traveler faces misfortune. It is also said: Yin’s harm arises subtly, not yet reaching its extreme—hence, it is called minor illness. Yet lying prostrate and gazing at the heavens, one sees no savior; thus, one bows low in submission, consumed by worry. This hexagram bodes ill for all matters; only secrecy is advisable.

He says: The sick cannot be saved; prisoners’ sentences are sealed; reasoning proves difficult; travelers encounter misfortune—this hexagram is inauspicious.

**Explication:**
Yin’s dominance spreads insidiously—distress and hardship follow. Bowing low and gazing at the heavens, sorrow reaches its extreme.

Here, two yin lines are exhausted below, while one yin line perches above—this portends misfortune for the world. In divination: illness leads to death, prisoners remain confined, the besieged find no rescue, and all matters turn inauspicious.

**Hexagram of Minor Advancement in the Yang Divination (311)**
*Office and salary come in due season; emolument aligns with one’s years.*
Diligently attend to affairs—take heed, lest you lose the moment.

Yan says: Official salary arrives in its time; in retreat or advancement, the cold season of one’s years brings both fortune and emolument. Be vigilant and cautious; do not grow lax or negligent.
For the sick, swift recovery. The traveler, though returned, gains something along the way.

It is also said: Dispelling accumulated yin, one governs the host of yang, doubling brightness and radiance.
Beholding the beauty of the state, one speaks of position—all affairs are in great harmony.
Other external matters may also be pursued in season: marriage and official pursuits are especially auspicious.

He says: For all one seeks, choose an auspicious time.
For the sick, offer prayers and supplications for blessings. The traveler will arrive at once.
For the imprisoned, seek those who enforce the law—they will surely secure pardon.

*Explanation*: The brilliance of yang is upright and direct; the path of office is greatly flourishing.
The noble person’s time for service is to act in due season. In this divination, the three yang lines occupy their rightful positions, while the middle and lower lines are yang in ascent.
The Dao of yang is unimpeded; yin’s perversity is cast aside. For those in office or pursuing the Way, this is the moment to act.
All matters are highly auspicious—advance without missing the opportunity. Every affair is favorable, save those of secret yin.

**Hexagram of Heaven’s Blessing: The Path (312)**
*Ascend high and gaze afar—above, one sees the celestial thoroughfare.*
The Jade Maiden, most sagely, bestows upon me a divine talisman.
Eternal bestowal of agelessness, to preserve my body.

Yan says: This is the image of receiving things, matters arising from a woman.
At home, all is auspicious. The traveler has not yet returned but will surely obtain rare treasures. The sick will recover of themselves.

It is also said: Heaven and Earth’s positions are now correct; Heaven and humanity unite in virtue. It is like ascending high to observe the six directions, yet below, one responds to yin.
When one finds their match, the divine talisman may be sought and seen.
A century of venerable age may be attained in tranquility.
This hexagram is an omen for the noble: yin and yang are in their rightful places, without mutual harm. All affairs are auspicious.

He says: For those at home, fortune. Marriage brings beauty.
The traveler’s road is unimpeded; the sick will recover at once. In official matters, seeking high ministers brings good fortune.
Silkworms and wheat flourish; the pregnant will bear sons. Merchants profit; the traveler returns. This hexagram is greatly auspicious.

*Explanation*: Ascending high to gaze afar is to occupy the superior position.
The Jade Maiden bestows the talisman—yin’s mutual response.
Centered and correct, one receives Heaven’s blessing.
Here, a single yang resides in the middle, above supporting the firm and luminous ruler, below responding to the young yin’s match—its fortune is unparalleled.

**Hexagram of Nobility: Encountering the Auspicious (313)**
*Virtue shines brilliantly; ten thousand years without end.*
The Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper guard and defend me.
Attaining promotion and emolument, generation after generation brings prosperity.

Yan says: Above and below are both yang; within and without, all is illuminated.
This is no hexagram for the common folk—it is the sign of the honored and wise.
Even those who would meet the lord may draw a comparison.

It is also said: All one seeks will be obtained; the traveler returns.

He says: Officials will be promoted; scholarship will bear fruit. Leading troops, one gains advantage; the army suffers no harm.
For the sick, pray to the celestial spirits. Marriage is fitting; merchants profit. The traveler returns; silkworms and wheat thrive. Official matters disperse. This hexagram is greatly auspicious.

*Explanation*: Virtue shines brilliantly—the Dao of yang is manifest.
The Northern Dipper guards and defends—yin’s treachery is dispelled.
In seeking office or planning affairs, one gains the power of the noble.
For grave sites or dwellings, this is an auspicious location.
For those at home, movement; for travelers, companionship. This is the divination of the noble.
Even common folk who obtain it will know extraordinary joy. Prayers are fitting.

---

**Hexagram of Prayer and Exorcism (314)**
*Numerous strange anomalies appear—summon the shaman to perform the rites.*
Pray and supplicate for blessings; calamity vanishes, misfortune ceases.
Great and small find peace—by the power of the gods and spirits.

Yan says: The subject will encounter strange events. At first, matters do not proceed as desired, but later, all conforms to the heart.
The traveler will arrive; there will first be tidings. At home, all is auspicious.

It is also said: Through accumulated yin encroaching upon extreme yang, one remains still while witnessing anomalies.
The so-called shaman responds to the superior position—prayer is fitting.
By harmonizing and dispelling misfortune, is this not the protective power of the gods?
All affairs are slightly auspicious.

He says: Fear calamity and misfortune—perform good deeds to avert them.
There may be quarrels, disputes, lawsuits, or hardships; evil dreams or strange anomalies. Former misfortune, later fortune; beginning difficult, end easy. Fortune and misfortune are evenly matched—only vigilance and exorcism are fitting.
For the sick, sacrifices to the celestial spirits bring good fortune. Marriage will be promptly settled, for within and without, there is response.

*Explanation*: Witnessing anomalies gives rise to doubt.
The household harbors an old ghost, whose power cannot be overcome.
Appeal to the divine—security is preserved without loss.
Here, accumulated yin resides within, while the superior position is replete with yang. Thus, the middle position speaks of the diviner obtaining it.
The household will encounter strange events—exorcism brings good fortune. For illness or lawsuits, prayer and exorcism are fitting. Seeking others, one gains their power. In all matters, initial worry yields to later fortune.

---

**Hexagram of Bestowing Goods: Initial Auspiciousness (321)**
*A guest arrives from the south, leaving me fine wealth.*
Precious goods and rare treasures: a golden platter, a jade cup.

Yan says: Someone will send things; at home, all is auspicious. The traveler returns, obtaining treasures and wealth.

It is also said: Yin occupies the center, responding to external yang—friends arrive from afar, is this not fitting?
The south is the position of yang, hence "from the south."
Precious goods and rare treasures are the resources of the noble; the golden platter and jade cup, the vessels of a fine feast.

He says: Marriage is auspicious; all one seeks will be obtained. The sick will recover; merchants profit. Official matters disperse; the traveler returns. This hexagram is greatly auspicious.

*Explanation*: A guest arrives from the south—firm and yielding respond.
The golden bowl and jade cup express reverence.

Here the divination shows Lesser Yin dwelling at the center, with one yang aligned below, while abundant yang holds its proper place above. Yin, through its yielding compliance, responds to external yang—thus obtaining precious goods. The "south" refers to the upper three lines forming *Li*, the southern direction. The "golden bowl and jade cup" arise from the lower single line as *Qian*, for *Qian* represents gold and jade, and the round vessel—hence the image of a golden bowl and jade cup. The first line corresponds to the upper and aligns with the center; the center is even, signifying a guest’s gift. For the querent, all matters are greatly auspicious, with seeking wealth and marriage most favorable.

**Peaceful Land Hexagram** (3-2-2)
The land is at peace, without hardship or difficulty.
Sow and cultivate as you wish; journeys and returns are favorable.

Yan says: The lower position does not encroach upon the upper, hence "the land is at peace." Planting is timely, trade is profitable, official ranks advance, illness poses no threat, travelers are safe and will soon arrive, marriages are harmonious, and dwellings are auspicious.
He says: Seekers attain their desires, the sick recover lightly, official matters bring no worry, and all affairs are tranquil—this is a hexagram of great fortune.

*Explanation*: "The land is at peace" because the yielding dwells in lowliness. "Without hardship or difficulty" comes from an untroubled heart. With no deceit between above and below, what could go amiss? Here, firm yang resides above while the middle and lower positions harmonize in compliance—thus the land is at peace and free from difficulty, so movement and stillness, advance and retreat encounter no obstruction. All matters are auspicious.

**Reverent Harmony Hexagram** (3-2-3)
Above, one stands upright; below, people fulfill their duties.
Households live in harmony, young and old unite in effort.
With unopposed resolve, all one seeks is obtained.

Yan says: Yin occupies the central position, embodying the Way of compliance—hence "below, people fulfill their duties." This hexagram unites the strength of all below, so all requests are fulfilled.
He says: Marriages are auspicious, husbands and wives harmonious, dwellings secure, travelers return, business and sericulture prosper, sons are born, and all matters are greatly fortunate.

*Explanation*: Yang’s firmness above is fitting and proper. With vigor and compliance mutually supporting, those below fulfill their duties. Households live in harmony, and nothing sought is denied. This hexagram brings good fortune in office, at home, on journeys, in work, marriage, and trade—nothing is not favorable, making it a greatly auspicious sign for all plans.

**Defiance Hexagram** (3-2-4)
Below does not follow above; the center cannot restrain the outer.
Above and below clash in defiance, discipline and order collapse in ruin.

Yan says: The Yin path steadily grows, while yang cannot contain it—such discord leads to chaos, hence "ruin." The sick grow worse, and medicine proves ineffective. Armies suffer defeat, and travelers do not return. This hexagram bodes ill for all matters.
He says: Nothing sought is obtained, nothing undertaken succeeds. One will see households scatter, property lost, armies defeated, distant journeys plagued by disaster, the sick distressed, official matters entangled, legal troubles unavoidable, and all exits leading to death’s gate—nothing is auspicious. Do not act or change course; only with the new year will fortune return. If obtained in the first month, it is inauspicious.

*Explanation*: "Below does not follow above" because yin prevails. "Above and below clash in defiance" through mutual aggression. "Discipline and order collapse in ruin"—they cannot prevail in the end. Here, above and below clash while yielding yin occupies the center, unable to govern the petty yet also unable to rightly follow above—this inevitably leads to ruin. All matters are inauspicious for the querent.

**Hidden Virtue Hexagram** (3-3-1)
The Four Hoary Ones of Mount Shang,
Cultivating nature and walking the Dao.
Inhaling and exhaling primordial qi,
One may attain agelessness.

Yan says: Though this hexagram is pure yang, the lower position governs, approaching the image of a noble retreat—thus one may nurture its purity. All matters are secure and auspicious, except marriage, which is unfavorable due to its pure yang nature.
He says: Officials ascend to high rank, sericulture and farming should begin early, travelers return at once, official matters disperse immediately, the sick recover on their own, and trade, home life, and all affairs prosper—this is an omen of great fortune.

*Explanation*: The Four Hoary Ones of Mount Shang illuminate while dwelling in seclusion. Inhaling and exhaling primordial qi allows for leisurely ease. Here, double yang occupies the upper two positions, a time of brilliance under heaven. Yet with one yang below, only the Four Hoary Ones of Mount Shang can match this. For the querent, it is fitting to dwell in peace and uphold integrity, enjoying the blessings of health and tranquility—do not seek advancement from others.

**Growing Firmness Hexagram** (2-1-3)
Two people share one heart,
Both as inner and outer.
Dwelling together in one state,
They rely on each other like lips and teeth.

Yan says: Gain comes from others, loss from oneself. Also: Three yangs reside above yin—hence "two people share one heart." Home life and all other matters are auspicious. Officials fare even better, marriages bear minor flaws, the sick recover slowly, and those seeking counsel find success. Travelers have not returned but will surely receive news.
He says: Rulers and ministers observe propriety, friends share one heart. Trade is profitable, sons are born, silkworms and wheat bring minor fortune. Official matters find aid, the sick suffer no harm, and medical treatment is advisable. This hexagram brings no calamity—greatly auspicious.

**Explanation says:**
"Two people share one heart" signifies doubled firmness. The yielding and compliant reside below, unharmed. Withdrawing to rely on each other like lips and teeth, they form a steadfast barrier. In this configuration, one yin dwells beneath doubled yang—yielding yet without conflict. Two yangs above act in unison, serving as inner and outer, embodying the image of dwelling together in one state. Like lips and teeth, they depend on each other and cannot be separated. For matters concerning rulers and ministers, brothers, husbands and wives, or friends, all are auspicious. One must not harbor groundless suspicions. In household affairs and commerce, great joy prevails. Do not heed slanderous words. Planting yields abundance, and silkworms and wheat bring harvest. Pregnant women will bear sons, official matters find resolution with aid, and the sick should seek medical treatment and perform blessings for protection. Marriages are harmonious, matching fine partners. For travelers, though they have not returned, news will surely arrive. This hexagram, when consulted for affairs, trade, or household matters, is an omen of great fortune. One version states: If one seeks elsewhere, it will not be favorable.

**Hexagram of Strong and Prosperous Forces (3-3-3)**
A multitude thrives and regains strength,
Already wealthy and flourishing.
Favorable for establishing merit,
None can resist or oppose.

Yan says: In this hexagram, each of the three positions holds three yangs—truly at the height of prosperity. Thus, in establishing merit and undertaking affairs, none can obstruct. In all matters, one should follow the straight path without partiality, never straying into crookedness—only then will it be auspicious.
He says: This hexagram is in its prime. Pregnant women will bear sons, travelers will return at once, business ventures are profitable, fields and silkworms yield double, hunting and fishing bring gains, relocation is auspicious, those raising armies will triumph, and those guarding borders will find peace. Homes are fortunate, illnesses recover, official matters disperse, trade is profitable—this hexagram is greatly auspicious.

**Explanation says:**
Three yangs share the same virtue, thriving and regaining strength. In establishing merit and undertaking affairs, they act with bold resolve. This configuration, with all three positions as yang, is firm, vigorous, and grand, reaching the height of wealth and prosperity. Thus, it is favorable for establishing merit and undertaking affairs. For those who obtain this hexagram, it is greatly auspicious to take action, especially in military matters. However, for illness, it is severe, and for marriage, it is unfavorable—due to its pure yang nature.

**Hexagram of Noble Beauty (3-3-4)**
Green windows and purple chambers,
Within dwell ladies of grace.
With radiant countenances and fragrant hues,
Orchids and irises bloom.

Yan says: The yin position flourishes, and matters arise from women. The sick recover on their own, and all sought-after goals are attained. Also: Pure yin resides below, corresponding above to heaven and humanity. Their essence and qi are fresh and fragrant, like orchids. Travelers return at once, marriages are most favorable, the sick find peace, and all affairs are auspicious.
He says: This is the hexagram of inner nobility. For marriage, the noble can be obtained, but the humble cannot. As a yin hexagram, it is unfavorable for yang matters. In planning, litigation, or encounters with influential figures, as well as with inner nobility, monks, nuns, or Daoists, it is auspicious. At home or abroad, financial gains and blessings abound, people admire you, and all matters are peaceful.

**Explanation says:**
Doubled firmness above shines with the Dao of yang. The multitude of yin below submits, resembling ladies of grace. Their descendants will surely flourish. In this configuration, though the multitude of yin is strong, it resides in the lower position, while the Dao of yang shines brightly above. The yielding dare not encroach, thus forming a proper correspondence. In all consulted matters, there is harmony. Travelers return at once, marriages are greatly auspicious, friendships deepen, and illnesses are not fatal.

**Hexagram of Gaining Emolument and Rising Fortune (3-4-1)**
Ruler and minister exchange positions,
Just as great fortune arises.
Messengers and letters travel,
People act with self-indulgence.

Yan says: Relocation is auspicious, and this direction brings profit. Pursuits will surely meet success. Travelers have not returned, but news arrives first. For the sick, their dwelling must be changed—moving away will avoid harm. Perhaps perform sacrifices, but do not partake; if one does, it will be auspicious. Also: One yang below, with a multitude of yin above—hence "exchanging positions." As merit and enterprise rise, they rely on others to succeed—hence "messengers and letters travel." In this hexagram, matters initially do not harmonize, but later bring great fortune—difficult at first, easy afterward.
He says: The lines of those in office undergo change, and affairs are auspicious. Travelers by water and land all return, livelihoods multiply tenfold, pregnant women bear sons, and marriages secure fine partners.

**Explanation says:**
"Ruler and minister exchange positions" signifies yin submitting to yang. "Messengers and letters travel with self-indulgence" means losing their proper allegiance. In this configuration, three yangs reside above, while one yang is below—this is called "ruler and minister exchanging positions." Moreover, four yins occupy the middle, overpowering it, while the three above, firm and strong, dwell externally and cannot attend to their ruler. Instead, they ally with the multitude of yin to pursue great fortune. Messengers and letters travel, acting with self-indulgence—this is extremely inauspicious. This hexagram is the exact opposite of the fifteenth hexagram in the "Three Images, One Above" section. Comparing and observing them reveals the author’s intent.

**Hexagram of Doubt and Hesitation (3-4-2)**
Intentions are glimpsed,
Yet fear they cannot be realized.
Advancing and retreating in hesitation,
Uncertain of what to do.

Yan says: In all matters, if one wavers in advancing or retreating, affairs will not be single-minded. Without single-mindedness, they cannot succeed. Also: Yin resides in the lower position, corresponding above to yang. Desiring action, the multitude of yin internally obstructs—hence the hesitation. Yet if one strives with determination, there will ultimately be gain. In this hexagram, all matters begin without success but end with it.
He says: What is sought is not obtained, what is undertaken does not succeed, livelihoods are unprofitable, officials retreat, travelers are confused, official matters are difficult to resolve, the sick face danger—this hexagram is an image of bewilderment.

**Explanation says:**
"Intentions are glimpsed" because the response lies below. "Fear they cannot be realized" due to the obstruction of petty people. "Advancing and retreating in hesitation" means doubt prevents resolution. In this configuration, yin resides in the lower position, corresponding above to yang, but is separated by the four yins in the middle.

The upper yang seeks to respond to the lower, yet is constrained by yin—thus doubt arises and cannot be resolved, giving birth to worry and misfortune. Divination reveals confusion without success: the sick waver between improvement and decline, and all matters prove unfavorable.

**Evil-Dispelling, Clarity-Shining Hexagram**  ☰☰☷
*Three-Four-Three*
The sun rises in the eastern sky, blazing with radiant brilliance.
Though malevolent qi lingers, it is scorched and consumed by the flames.
The multitude of worthy ones shatters the yin, and calamities dissolve.

Yan says: Amidst the prevailing yin, it is called "malevolent qi." The surrounding yang, through its searing heat, purges it.
All matters begin in discord but end in fortune.

He says: Official matters fail, yet one receives assistance. Prisoners free themselves; the sick first suffer but later recover. Travelers return at once; trade and official pursuits, though initially thwarted, ultimately yield great fortune.

**Explanation says:**
"Blazing with radiant brilliance"—both above and below are luminous. When malevolence reaches its extreme, it declines and cannot persist. The multitude of yin is shattered and dispersed, and the human Dao prevails. In this hexagram, two firm yangs assail a dominant yin: though effort is required at first, success is ultimately assured. All divined matters are auspicious; though perilous, there is no blame. However, divining yin matters brings misfortune.

**Upright Yang Hexagram**  ☰☰☷
*Three-Four-Four*
Above stands a worthy ruler; below lurk slanderous ministers.
Sun and moon cast their light, yet dark dust remains unseen.

Yan says: The three yangs above form the image of a worthy ruler. Though sun and moon shine brightly, they do not illuminate the dark dust.

For those in high positions, fortune prevails; slander does not take root. Marriage brings a virtuous wife, and the sick suffer no distress.

He says: Though the yang above is luminous, the multitude of yin gazes upward in reflection. Though sun and moon shine, dark dust still arises. This hexagram portends frequent regrets. Seeking office is somewhat difficult, but divining marriage is auspicious, for yin and yang respond to each other. The sick waver between improvement and decline, recovering only at the onset of spring. All matters bring minor fortune, flourishing only when spring stirs.

**Explanation says:**
The firm yang occupies its rightful position—above stands a worthy ruler. The accumulated yin below resembles dark dust. Obstruction lingers unresolved, and aspirations cannot be fulfilled. In this hexagram, the firm yang ascends to the celestial position, yet the middle and lower positions are filled with crooked yin, jointly causing obstruction. There is a ruler but no ministers, hence his will cannot be enacted. Divined matters often bring regret; only marriage, through mutual resonance, is auspicious. This hexagram holds equal measure of fortune and misfortune.

**Orphaned-Poverty Hexagram: Encountering Difficulty**  ☷☰☰
*Four-One-One*
Emerging from warmth into cold, clad in thin garments.
Departing from my loving mother, I suffer this calamity and transgression.

Yan says: Two yangs lie below, obscured by the multitude of yin. It is as if one leaves what is beloved and encounters harsh pity.
In this hexagram, all matters are inauspicious. Travelers do not arrive; the sick worsen, bearing the image of separation. It is best to maintain the status quo. Obtaining this in the first or second month brings fortune; in other months, misfortune.

He says: Officials make no progress; livelihoods yield no profit. Dwelling in solitude and poverty, one endures hardship to the end. Prisoners struggle to be freed; the sick do not recover. Nothing aligns with one’s desires. Marriages lack constancy; all matters demand caution. Only with the arrival of the new year does vitality return.

**Explanation says:**
"Clad in thin garments"—lowly and orphaned. The dominant yin above obscures all, leaving none to accompany him. In this hexagram, two yangs reside beneath the dominant yin yet receive no response, like an orphaned child. Moreover, the fourth line, with its crooked yin above, resembles a jealous wife regarding the orphan—his plight is extreme. Divining illness portends danger; travelers face prolonged hardship; officials encounter obstacles; livelihoods falter; military campaigns meet resistance. All matters are inauspicious.

**Hidden Dragon Hexagram: Awaiting the Hour**  ☷☰☷
*Four-One-Two*
Shun tilled the fields, reaching Mount Li.
The soil was fertile, the harvest abundant—ten thousand measures reaped in a year.

Yan says: All matters begin in the third or fourth month and conclude in the eighth or ninth month.
Again, it is said: The hidden dragon tills the fields, responding to the year’s abundance—who but Yu Shun could achieve this? This hexagram aligns with the first yang line of *Qian*, preserving one’s integrity in reclusion to cultivate the ruler’s virtue within. Whether matters are great or small, acting with benevolence is fitting; seeking through calculation is difficult. The sick will recover only by the end of autumn.

He says: Suitable for farming and sericulture; what is sought will be obtained. Trade brings profit; households prosper. Travelers return; pregnant women bear sons. Marriages harmonize. This hexagram brings great fortune in all matters.

**Explanation says:**
The accumulated yin above is exhausted, leaving none to accompany him. His virtue flourishes and finds resonance below. When the time arrives, he rises—none can resist. Though this hexagram places a single yang amidst the multitude of yin, the upper yin, having reached its extreme, has exhausted its path. The lesser yin below aligns with me. Though the upper does not regard me, the lower responds—hence the image of Shun plowing Mount Li. Though not loved by his parents, his profound virtue ultimately ascends to renown.

**Beneficial Friend Hexagram: Responsive Divination**  ☷☰☷
*Four-One-Three*
A noble scion arrives, knocking at my gate.
He speaks of fortune and blessing—going forth, I shall surely receive favor.

Yan says: One should go only when summoned. To be called and not go is inauspicious. The words advise going; if a traveler is abroad, calling him will bring his return.
Again, it is said: The inner responds to the outer, not remaining within—his aspiration lies in going, for the middle position aids him. When a guest knocks at the gate, who could be nobler than a scion? This hexagram is timely for marriage and all the more favorable for seeking. One version states: Seeking from others brings misfortune.

He says: Officials gain merit; farming and sericulture are auspicious. The sick recover; legal matters disperse. Travelers return; seekers attain their desires. All matters bring great fortune.

**Explanation says:**
"A noble scion knocks at the gate"—the response lies without. "Going forth, I shall surely receive favor"—the journey brings assistance. In this hexagram, exhausted yin resides above, while flourishing yang lies below. Yin, having reached its extreme, seeks the yang—hence the image of knocking at my gate. The noble scion is a person of high standing. The middle position, a lesser yang, neither competes with me nor aids me, thus going forth brings blessing.

Divination favors advancement, for one shall receive assistance from a noble person. The sick will encounter skilled physicians; in military affairs, allies will respond. All matters bring good fortune.

**Long Treachery Hexagram (Many Difficulties)**
*Four-One-Four*
Separated and distant, with repeated obstructions.
All undertakings prove unfavorable; nothing prospers.

Yan says: In all endeavors, the heart’s desires remain unfulfilled, and one encounters only alarm and dread, for a single yang cannot prevail alone. Though it occupies the central position, it suffers repeated harm. Retreating into concealment, survival itself becomes difficult. This hexagram is wholly inauspicious—one must maintain the status quo and avoid new ventures, for all new schemes bring misfortune.

He says: Travelers by land and water meet with repeated setbacks and ruin. The sick recover with difficulty; prisoners remain confined; merchants gain no profit. This hexagram is greatly inauspicious.

**Explanation says:**
Separated and distant, one is beset by isolation. Already solitary and weak, how can anything be accomplished? This hexagram shows a lone yang submerged within accumulated yin, unable to rise—thus nearly all matters bring misfortune.

**Divine Assistance Hexagram (Utmost Adversity Reversed)**
*Four-Two-One*
Four ghosts and two shamans bow in supplication.
Heavenly spirits descend to release the imprisoned.
Afflictions vanish; blessings from Heaven are attained.

Yan says: All entanglements dissolve. Heavy yin prevails in the heavens, and ghostly qi transforms. A single yang stands alone—who but the heavenly spirits could respond thus? All matters begin inauspiciously but conclude favorably.

He says: Collaborating with others brings good fortune. Marriages harmonize; prisoners are freed; the sick recover; travelers return; pregnancies yield sons; silkworms and wheat yield modest harvests; enmities resolve themselves; seeking office or wealth first brings worry, then good fortune.

**Explanation says:**
Four ghosts and two shamans—yin flourishes and ascends. Heavenly spirits descend with blessings, for adversity has reached its extreme and now gives way to prosperity. In this hexagram, yin prevails, assuming the form of ghosts and spirits. A lesser yin occupies the central position, drawn to its own kind. Though the single yang is weak and cannot rise on its own, the young man and young woman will surely unite if they seek it. Thus, they can entreat the spirits above on my behalf, bringing down blessings and dispelling calamities. What was once a surging yin above is no longer a ghost but a heavenly spirit. This is the image of adversity reaching its limit and the Way of Peace returning. Divination indicates reliance on others will prove effective, with initial hardship followed by joy.

**Expiatory Sacrifice Hexagram (Auspicious for Offerings)**
*Four-Two-Two*
Tombs and high mounds—ghosts and spirits roam above.
Hasten to perform expiatory rites, and you may avoid misfortune.

Yan says: Accumulated yin with no yang forms towering, ghostly mounds—the image of tombs. Ghostly and spiritual forces flourish; only wholehearted sacrifice can avert misfortune.

He says: If one has vowed offerings to spirits but not fulfilled them, doing so now brings good fortune. Should strange omens appear, it is auspicious to sacrifice to the spirits of hills and mounds. This hexagram is middling—official advancement, seeking wealth, recovery from illness, and legal matters all begin with difficulty but conclude favorably. Travelers abroad face obstruction from a yin person but will return by summer; all else remains peaceful.

**Explanation says:**
Tombs and high mounds—ghostly qi thrives. Perform expiatory rites swiftly to accept fate with reverence. In this hexagram, four yin lines occupy the upper position, while the middle and lower positions hold only lesser yin, with no yang—thus the image of tombs and high mounds. Only through reverence and compliance can one avoid disaster. The diviner should avoid contention; in all matters, adopting a gentle, upright, and honest approach brings good fortune.

**Later Laughter Hexagram (Auspicious for Prayers of Blessing)**
*Four-Two-Three*
The essence of metal stirs, but the primal scholar restrains it.
Pressing down with the left hand, one obtains favor and protection.

Yan says: Metal belongs to the west, the position of lesser yin, governing weapons and slaughter. The "primal scholar" is a great person. The left is yang, meaning that when yin qi stirs to bring harm, the great person assists. Pressing down with the left hand, the harm is dispelled—yang can restrain yin. In this hexagram, worries do not come to pass, and extreme disorder turns auspicious.

He says: This hexagram brings initial sorrow followed by joy. In all undertakings, one attains good fortune through the assistance of others. In ventures and aspirations, there is first sorrow, then joy. All matters ultimately gain the aid of a noble person, transforming misfortune into blessing. In affairs, good fortune prevails. Those with powerful officials may avoid calamity, but they must remain cautious and adhere to constancy in all things.

**Explanation says:**
Lesser yin ascends, and the essence of metal stirs. The three yang lines restrain it, causing it to halt on its own. In this hexagram, exhausted yin occupies the upper position, while lesser yin resides in the middle—two forms the image of *dui*, hence the "essence of metal." The three yang below correspond to the upper lines. Lesser yin cannot act, for the left is yang. In all matters, one gains assistance from others, first through caution, then through joy.

**Initial Auspiciousness Hexagram (Auspicious for Prayers of Blessing)**
*Four-Two-Four*
In ancestral temple rites, harm ceases and misfortune halts.
Blessings fill the gate, while calamities flee ten thousand miles.

Yan says: The multitude of yin above forms the image of ancestral temples. Official matters disperse, the sick recover—it is fitting to seek blessings and offer sacrifices to the spirits. When encountering omens or in all matters, one should perform rites at the ancestral temple to attain good fortune.

He says: If a daughter is conceived, guard against great fire.

**Explanation says:**
The ancestral temple rites are where the spirits reside. By reverently upholding them, blessings come without misfortune.

Here is the translation:

---

This divination shows four yin both above and below: the upper as ancestral temples, the lower as burial mounds. The second, with its lesser yin, occupies the central position, like one who serves gods and ghosts. By reverently and obediently upholding the rites without fail, one receives blessings and avoids misfortune. The omens thus mirror this auspiciousness.

**From the Heart Divination (Treading the Peaceful Hexagram)**
*Four-Three-One*
The dark clouds gather above, while below no slanderers remain.
All matters flow smoothly, each returning to its true nature.

Yan says: In all matters, follow the heart, and others will assist. He also says: Yin occupies the upper position, revered by the multitude of yang. Misfortune departs, blessings arrive—all through ancestral rites. This hexagram favors grand sacrifices at the ancestral temple, ensuring household peace and ultimate safety from blame.

He says: A son will be conceived; the traveler returns at once; no bitter disputes arise. The sick should perform rites and seek blessings to recover. Fields and silkworms yield harvests—greatly auspicious. This hexagram is most effective in autumn.

**Explanation says:**
The dark clouds above signify yin ascending. Below, no slanderers remain, for the yang path is unimpeded. This divination shows four yin above, while the two lower positions are yang, forming the image of dark clouds. The third, central, and first positions each occupy their rightful place. With yang unobstructed by yin, no slanderers remain—this is the image of all matters flowing smoothly. The omens for all affairs are auspicious; the traveler returns immediately.

**Loss and Gain Divination (Overcoming Strength Hexagram)**
*Four-Three-Two*
My treasured pearl is gone, now lost upon the heavenly thoroughfare.
Unexpectedly, the thief lurks in hidden malice.
Yet the dark crow comes to my aid, driving the foe away.
The wind stills, the waves calm—I return to my home.

Yan says: In all matters, one is first restrained, then follows the heart. If objects are obtained through others, they will soon depart. First hardship, then success—such is the nature of most affairs. He also says: Four yin bandits violently steal my rare treasure. Yet yang remains, and in the end, treachery is cut down, like the dark crow pursuing evil birds. The storm subsides, and one may return to the old dwelling. This hexagram is first inauspicious, then auspicious.

He says: First restraint, then success—all matters follow this pattern. Fields and silkworms prosper; a son is conceived—this is a greatly auspicious hexagram.

**Explanation says:**
"My treasured pearl is gone" signifies yin’s exhaustion above. This divination shows four yin exhausted above, while two yin grow below, forming the image of my pearl stolen and the thief’s hidden lair. Yet three yang reside in the center, aligned with the upper position. The lesser yin is too weak to oppose them and thus cannot cause harm. The omens promise initial fortune followed by peace, with good fortune attained through others’ assistance.

**Seeking Aid Divination (Receiving Assistance Hexagram)**
*Four-Three-Three*
The Controller of Fate descends, inspecting the threads of destiny.
Though life’s span is not yet exhausted, one suffers unjustly.

Immediately summon Bian Que to open the jade flask.
Bestow a single pill of medicine, and life is restored.
Yan says: The sick should take nine doses of medicine; what they seek will be obtained, and the traveler will return.
It is also said: The Controller of Fate is the Celestial Physician.
Though the host of yin resides above and the multitude of yang dwells in the center, though they occupy their proper positions, they become obstacles instead. If the innocent are drowned in unjust calamity, Heaven commands Bian Que to save them, and the disaster is dispelled.
This hexagram brings fortune through misfortune, life through illness.
He says: In official matters, there will be documents and confusion before resolution; it is also called "rest and dispersal."
In all affairs of this hexagram, misfortune precedes good fortune; in official matters, one gains the power of a noble.
**Explanation says:**
Yang is obscured by yin, yet no great guilt exists.
The doubled firmness ascends—it cannot ultimately be defiled.
This divination shows pure yang in the middle and lower positions, with four yin above, forming the image of the innocent being trapped. Yet yang is in its prime; though momentarily suppressed, it will not sink into ruin. Moreover, yin at its extreme must decline, while the Dao of yang is in full vigor, and one shall receive the aid of celestial spirits.
The omens promise initial hardship followed by prosperity, fortune through misfortune.
The sick will be weary but not die; in warfare, peril will yield victory; in all matters, initial sorrow will turn to good fortune.

**Great Passage Divination (Unobstructed Hexagram)**
*Four-Three-Four*
The celestial thoroughfare lies smooth and broad,
Five paths open, six ways connect.
I travel within it,
Riding clouds, mounting dragons.
Yan says: The three yang occupy the center, their position noble and virtue abundant—I am yang. The celestial thoroughfare is unobstructed; riding clouds and mounting dragons, one commands the six directions. Like the Nine-Five of *Qian*, if the common people encounter it, they cannot bear it and will instead invite misfortune. Yet if one assists in governing a bright era, one may remain blameless. Whatever is sought will be obtained, following one’s will.
It is also said: The sun rises in the east,
Illuminating my hundred paths.
Its lingering light extends
Even to the hidden valleys.
Official matters will disperse; the sick will recover; the traveler will return; merchants will profit greatly; marriages will harmonize—this hexagram is a sign of great good fortune.
He says: When the Yellow Bell meets the *zi* hour, the yang qi flourishes.
Gradually, harmony and peace will come—no need for sighs.
All affairs follow the heart; all matters bring joy.
**Explanation says:**
The celestial thoroughfare lies smooth and broad—
the soft cannot overcome the firm.
Riding clouds, mounting dragons—
the position is central and upright.
This divination shows old yin above and below, incapable of action, while three yang reside in the center, firm, bright, and mighty, unstoppable in any direction. Thus it forms the image of the celestial thoroughfare smooth and broad, five paths opening, six ways connecting.
For the one who obtains this, it is fitting to govern the state, pacify the common people, eliminate the cruel, and expel the violent—nothing is impossible.

**Obscured Survival Divination (Faint Survival Hexagram)**
*Four-Four-One*
Breath comes faintly, lingering,
Without strength.
Face upturned, one calls to Heaven;
Head bowed, one cowers low.
Seeking brings no connection;
Seeing brings no attainment.
Yan says: Only a single yang remains,
Sunken beneath the earth.
Bound by yin’s dark veils,
Head bowed, cowering low.
How much life remains?
This hexagram is greatly inauspicious.
The sick will be gravely ill; fields and silkworms will yield no profit; on distant journeys, one will encounter bandits.
He says: In all matters, nothing is fitting—
only sighs remain.
In office or private life, one faces slander and disputes,
Deep and hard to clear.
Guard stillness and retreat.
Or travel a thousand *li* to escape disaster.
Official matters are hard to avoid; illness is hard to cure; merchants will lose capital; distant journeys will bring calamity.
Whatever one plans will be unfavorable—
it is fitting to cultivate blessings to avert misfortune.
**Explanation says:**
Breath comes faintly, lingering in servitude,
Head bowed, cowering low—
utter destitution, with none to appeal to.
This divination shows a single yang obscured beneath layers of yin, the image of extreme hardship.
The sick will surely die; battles will be lost; prisoners will not escape; litigants will not prevail—all matters are inauspicious.

**Yin Growth Divination (Middle Suppression Hexagram)**
*Four-Four-Two*
Layers of yin reside above,
Ghostly qi drifts and wanders.
Water pools in the central courtyard;
Boats sail beneath the hall.
Yan says: A hexagram of pure yin,
Inner and outer do not respond.
Disasters of official ghosts all belong to yin.
In all matters, this is an omen of misfortune and decline.
Though inner and outer do not respond,
If official power aids it, it may instead turn auspicious.
A daughter will be born.
He says: The traveler will encounter bandits; in all matters, nothing is favorable.
Yin schemes and slander—
one must be cautious.
It is also called the "Enlightenment Hexagram"—
in small matters, slight good fortune.
**Explanation says:**
Layers of yin reside above—
the Dao of yang is blocked.
Water runs deep in the central courtyard—
fear of drowning.
This divination shows pure yin, the image of misfortune without response.
For the one who obtains this,
Yin people, bandits, and thieves will cause harm.
The sick face great misfortune.
It also portends yin schemes, curses, official ghosts, and slander—
all matters are inauspicious,
Except for seeking rain.

**Worldly Divination (Extreme Hardship Hexagram)**
*Four-Four-Three*
Trapped in misfortune,
One sits alone behind closed doors.
Followers scatter;
There is no way to obtain fire.
Yan says: The yang qi has lost its position,
With none to follow—
Thus it is called "sitting alone."
Fire is yang, the resource of transformation.
The host of yin blocks it—
there is no way to obtain it.
The household faces ruin;
In all matters, nothing goes as desired;
Marriages will have no descendants.
This hexagram is greatly inauspicious—
one must be especially cautious.
The sick will not recover; the traveler will not return.
He says: The sick have no qi; official matters are hard to resolve.
**Explanation says:**
Trapped in misfortune—
yin rides over yang.
No way to obtain fire—
darkness and obscurity.
This divination shows yang losing its position and lacking support,
While yin ascends and its faction flourishes.
For the one who obtains this,
There will be unprovoked disaster—
a greatly inauspicious divination.

**Multitude of Misfortunes Divination (Utmost Peace Hexagram)**
*Four-Four-Four*
Misfortune strikes violently;
In all matters, nothing is favorable.
Illness lingers endlessly;
Every movement brings stumbles.
Yan says: All three positions are yin—
misfortune arrives secretly.
In action or stillness, speech or silence,
Nothing is auspicious.
He says: This hexagram brings a multitude of disasters;
The sick face extreme peril.

Desires unfulfilled, all matters unfavorable.
Proceed with caution—gradually, things will stabilize.
Flowers bloom in frost-laden skies,
A sight of blossoms fills the eye.
Though one exhausts all human effort,
Human affairs remain fickle.

**Explanation says:**
Utmost yin with no yang—
the extreme of exhaustion.
In movement, one stumbles,
No strength can be applied.
This divination shows all three positions as exhausted yin,
A multitude of misfortunes arise,
All endeavors meet obstruction,
One can only await ruin.

**Bitter Endurance Divination (Heavenly Yang Hexagram)**
*One-One-Zero*
Dwelling in poverty, enduring hardship,
No doors or household to call one’s own.
Trapped within narrow paths,
No ground even to plant an awl.

Yan says: Standing apart from the crowd,
One dwells alone in the outer realm.
No inner resonance,
No place to settle.
Poverty and hardship,
Only confinement remains.
This hexagram brings misfortune in all matters.

He says: The dwelling has nothing to rely upon,
Thus it is said: *no ground even to plant an awl.*
The sick face extreme distress,
Desires go unfulfilled,
Official matters are hard to resolve,
Long journeys bring encounters with bandits—
All should cultivate blessings.

**Explanation says:**
Dwelling in poverty, enduring hardship—
No means to establish a home.
Coming and going along narrow paths,
One can only sigh.
This divination shows the upper and middle positions isolated,
With no lower position,
Thus forming the image of destitution and homelessness—
All matters are inauspicious.

**Joyous Harmony Divination (Matched Pair Hexagram)**
*One-Two-Zero*
Husband and wife draw close,
No others intrude.
Sitting knee to knee,
Only joy and contentment.

Yan says: Hard and soft in resonance,
An image of harmony.
This hexagram brings harmony in all matters,
Marriage is most auspicious.

He says: The household is at peace,
All desires are fulfilled.
Every matter follows the heart,
Silkworms and fields yield great harvest—
An omen of great fortune.

**Explanation says:**
Husband and wife draw close—
A proper household.
Knee to knee in joy,
A moment of self-delight.
This divination, though lacking a lower position,
Has yang above and yin in the middle,
Achieving its pairing,
With no one to sow discord.
The household is auspicious,
Marriage most auspicious.
All matters proceed smoothly,
Though only in small affairs—
Great undertakings are not favored.

**Fulfillment Divination (Completion Hexagram)**
*One-Three-Zero*
Abiding in one’s proper place,
Matters align with one’s will.
Set the mind at ease,
Fortune and prosperity arrive in due course.
Celebration and joy abound,
All brings lasting benefit.

Yan says: Three yang in the middle,
Achieving its proper order.
This hexagram brings good fortune in all matters,
The sick suffer no pain,
Those seeking office find ever greater success.

He says: All matters follow the heart,
Marriage is harmonious.
Official matters resolve easily,
The household enjoys wealth and nobility,
Those in office ascend to higher ranks—
All matters are greatly auspicious.

**Explanation says:**
The yang path flourishes,
Abiding in its proper place.
No treachery above or below,
Preserving fortune and benefit.
This divination shows yang in its rightful position—
All matters are auspicious.

**Ghostly Omen Divination (Ghostly Relations Hexagram)**
*One-Four-Zero*
Food will not pass the lips,
Breath will not enter the nose,
The heart and belly are knotted with vexation,
Sleep eludes the night.

Yan says: Soft yin resides within,
Not in harmony with the initial yang,
Thus bringing harm.

He says: The sick face misfortune,
Prisoners find no release.
One should reflect on oneself,
Not blame others.
Overland travel brings encounters with bandits,
Voyages meet wind and fire—
All matters are inauspicious.

**Explanation says:**
One yang amidst four yin—
The will cannot flow.
Heart and belly knotted with vexation—
The illness lies within.
This divination shows soft yin occupying the human position,
While a solitary yang stands above,
With no companions,
Above and below out of harmony,
Qi and breath obstructed—
An image of worry and illness.
All matters are inauspicious.
Beware of hidden yin threats,
On journeys, fear wind, water, and bandits.

**Delayed Fortune Divination (Ultimate Benefit Hexagram)**
*Two-One-Zero*
Entrusting matters to others,
Day by day, one awaits their intent.

Up to the present, only now does one attain fine joy.
Though matters linger long, in the end one fulfills their will.

**Yan says:**
Affairs must reverse and intertwine,
Only then will aid arrive.
Entrusting matters to others,
In the end one obtains good fortune.
Yet one’s position is solitary and humble,
Unable to advance on their own—
Thus delay brings goodness.
This hexagram responds slowly but auspiciously.

**He says:**
Using affairs to entrust others,
All accord with the heart’s desire,
Only belatedly,
With external joy and celebration.
The sick suffer from heart and belly ailments, recovery is slow;
Travelers wishing to return meet with obstruction.
Every matter proceeds slowly,
Yet attains its good fortune.

**Explanation says:**
Entrusting matters to others,
Seeking without immediate success.
Lingering long, one fulfills their will,
In the end there is attainment.
In this divination, yin and yang are paired,
Yet the middle and lower positions are intertwined and disordered.
One’s position is solitary and humble,
Unable to advance swiftly—
Thus only after long duration does it come through.
In all matters, initial worry gives way to joy,
Ultimately fulfilling what is sought.
One should not act with haste.

---

**Anxiety and Separation Divination (Caution and Vigilance Hexagram)**
*Two-Two-Zero*
Though at peace, still perilous;
Though joyful, still sorrowful.
Ever fearing separation,
Unable to remain together.

**Yan says:**
Two yin face each other in residence,
With no yang position at all.
As if good intentions do not pair,
Ever seeming as if parted.
Marriage is difficult to unite,
For it is pure yin.
In all matters, there is no advantage—
Strictly guard against reckless action.

**He says:**
Desiring separation,
Uncertain of good or ill.
What is sought is hard to obtain;
One’s dwelling should be frugal.
Household members may harbor schemes of hidden yin;
Legal matters remain unresolved;
The sick have not recovered;
Travelers have not returned;
Commerce yields no profit;
Military campaigns meet with no victory—
There is calamity, no joy.

**Explanation says:**
Though at peace, still perilous—
The household is empty.
Ever fearing separation—
Intentions do not align.
This hexagram has two yin residing externally,
With no household—
Thus one is at ease yet unaware of danger.
Moreover, intentions do not pair,
With nothing to rely upon.
Those who obtain this divination
Will not fulfill their desires.
The family’s fortunes dwindle,
Ever burdened with worry that cannot be dispelled.

---

**Central Abundance Divination (Great Completion Hexagram)**
*Two-Three-Zero*
Encountering me at the crossroads,
The carriage rumbles along.
What treasure is this?
Yellow gold and white silver.
Ever ensuring abundance,
Seeking without fear of poverty.

**Yan says:**
Though yin resides above,
Yang dwells in the center.
Intentions respond externally,
Supreme prosperity and blessing.
No fear of poverty—
This hexagram is greatly auspicious.
What is hoped for should be distant,
Then there will be joy and celebration,
Great good fortune.

**He says:**
Either through others’ arrival one obtains goods,
Or by seeking others one gains wealth.
Like the flourishing of the myriad things,
One reaps double abundance.
Seeking office brings harmony;
Travelers gain greatly and return at once.
Legal matters disperse;
The sick recover;
All affairs are greatly auspicious—
Especially suitable for seeking wealth.

**Explanation says:**
Encountering me at the crossroads—
The firm and yielding respond.
The carriage rumbles along—
The position is central and correct.
Seeking without fear of poverty—
Great celebration ensues.
In this divination, all affairs are auspicious.
Only with land and position,
Managing property and establishing enterprises,
Is it not advantageous in one’s hometown,
But advantageous abroad.
In all divinations lacking a lower position,
This is generally the case.

---

**Assisting Peril Divination (Upholding Integrity Hexagram)**
*Two-Four-Zero*
The sagely person is refined,
What form do they take?
Worthy and good respond within,
First weeping, then singing.

**Yan says:**
What sets the sagely person apart from others
Is their cultivation of both refinement and substance—
Only then are they esteemed.
This hexagram brings initial sorrow, then joy.
Seeking to meet the ruler for office and emolument,
There is no beginning, but there is an end.
One version says:
Yesterday, setting out on a journey,
I encountered bandits and soldiers.
A stray arrow struck me,
Both eyes now dim and blurred.

**He says:**
Going out or staying in is inauspicious;
One may meet bandits and soldiers,
Struck by a flying arrow in the eye.
Travelers have not arrived;
The sick are gravely afflicted;
Prisoners are difficult to release.

**Explanation says:**
Going out and encountering misfortune—
Yin occupies the center.
A stray arrow strikes the eye—
The upper position is exhausted.
In this divination, both the upper and middle positions are yin,
With no lower position,
Nor proper pairing—
They harm one another.
Those who obtain this divination
Will be oppressed and violated by petty yin forces.
Travelers worry over bandits;
Legal matters are hard to resolve;
Military campaigns suffer defeat;
Marriages are discordant—
In nearly all matters, there is fault.

---

**Flowing Fortune Divination (Attaining Heaven Hexagram)**
*Three-One-Zero*
Continuously meeting misfortune,
Now one joins with good fortune.
Not merely for a time,
Blessing shall accumulate for generations.

**Yan says:**
Three yang above—
Nothing can invade.
This brings fortune and celebration.
In this hexagram, initially there may be worry,
But afterward, no suffering.
Managing the household brings advantage.
Another version says:
Affairs begin as one wishes,
Office and emolument are then obtained.
Travelers return;
The sick recover;
The household is at peace—
All that is sought is greatly auspicious.

**He says:**
Affairs begin with worry,
Then fortune arrives.

**Explanation says:**
Continuously meeting misfortune—
First there is worry.
Now one joins with good fortune—
Ultimately attaining what is sought.
In this hexagram, above and below are both yang,
With no obstruction.
Intentions align, the Way converges—
One may bring about fortune and blessing,
An image of attaining Heaven.
In all matters, initial regret gives way to good fortune.

**Late Arrival Divination (Awaiting the Time Hexagram)**
*Three-Two-Zero*
Shouldering the plow to till,
In the fourth month, one lifts their feet.
Diligently hastening with the season,
Millet and sorghum flourish.

**Yan says:**
Yang occupies the upper ranks,
Yin is centered in the correct position—
This is the proper principle.
Planting with the season,
There is much advantage.
In the fourth month, the three yang—
Crops and grains begin to thrive,
Fields and silkworms bring great good fortune.

**He says:**
In all matters, as one wishes,
Only slightly delayed.
After long duration, it comes through.

**Explanation says:**
In all matters, initial worry gives way to joy,
Ultimately fulfilling what is sought.
One should not act with haste.

---

**Anxiety and Separation Divination (Caution and Vigilance Hexagram)**
*Two-Two-Zero*
Though at peace, still perilous;
Though joyful, still sorrowful.
Ever fearing separation,
Unable to remain together.

**Yan says:**
Two yin face each other in residence,
With no yang position at all.
As if good intentions do not pair,
Ever seeming as if parted.
Marriage is difficult to unite,
For it is pure yin.
In all matters, there is no advantage—
Strictly guard against reckless action.

**Yan says:**
Desiring separation, yet not discerning good from ill,
What is sought proves difficult to obtain.
Dwelling places should be guarded against famine.
Within the household, there may be schemes of hidden malice.
Official matters remain unresolved,
The sick have not recovered,
Travelers have not returned,
Commerce yields no profit,
Military campaigns meet no victory—
Only misfortune, no joy.

**Explanation says:**
Though at peace, still perilous—
The household is empty.
Ever fearing separation—
Intentions do not align.
In this hexagram, two yin reside externally,
Without a household to call their own.
Thus, though at ease, one knows not the danger.
Moreover, intentions fail to pair,
With nothing to rely upon.
For the one who draws this divination,
Desires go unfulfilled,
The family’s fortunes dwindle,
And constant worry cannot be dispelled.

---

**Abundance Hexagram (Great Success Divination)**
*Two-Three-Zero*
I meet my fields and paths,
Chariot wheels rumbling.
What treasures do I hold?
Yellow gold and white silver.
Ever ensuring abundance,
Seeking without fear of poverty.

**Yan says:**
Though yin resides above,
Yang dwells within.
Intentions respond to the external—
Primal harmony brings fortune and blessing.
No need to fear poverty;
This hexagram is greatly auspicious.
Aspirations should be set far—
Then joy and celebration will come.
Greatly auspicious.

**He says:**
Either receiving goods from visitors,
Or journeying to seek others and gaining wealth.
Like the sprouting of all things,
Yielding double abundance.
Seeking office brings harmony,
Travelers return with great gains.
Legal matters disperse,
The sick recover,
All affairs are greatly auspicious—
Especially fitting for seeking wealth.

**Explanation says:**
Meeting my fields and paths—
Hard and soft respond.
Chariot wheels rumbling—
The position is central and upright.
Seeking without fear of poverty—
Great celebration ensues.
This divination bodes well for all matters.
Yet with earthly positions,
Managing property or establishing enterprises
Brings no advantage at home,
But profit lies abroad.
Few are the divinations of lower rank—
Most follow this pattern.

---

**Upholding Danger Hexagram (Guarding Integrity Divination)**
*Two-Four-Zero*
The sage is refined,
What form does he take?
Worthy and good respond within,
First weeping, then singing.

**Yan says:**
What sets the sage apart from others
Is his balanced refinement of culture and substance—
Only then is he esteemed.
This hexagram brings initial sorrow, then joy.
Seeking office from the ruler,
It begins poorly but ends well.
*Another version states:*
Yesterday, while traveling,
Bandits and soldiers confronted me.
A stray arrow struck my eye,
Leaving both sightless and lost.

**He says:**
Going out brings no fortune,
Or encountering bandits,
Struck in the eye by an arrow.
Travelers have not arrived,
The sick are gravely afflicted,
Prisoners remain unresolved.

**Explanation says:**
Traveling meets with misfortune—
Yin occupies the center.
A stray arrow strikes the eye—
The upper position is exhausted.
In this divination, both upper and middle are yin,
Lacking a lower position,
Nor are they a fitting pair—
They harm one another.
For the one who draws this,
They will be oppressed by petty yin forces.
Travelers fear thieves,
Legal matters are hard to escape,
Military campaigns end in defeat,
Marriages fail to harmonize—
Nearly all affairs bring fault.

---

**Flowing Fortune Hexagram (Heaven’s Favor Divination)**
*Three-One-Zero*
Meeting misfortune again and again,
Now it joins with good fortune.
Not just for a time—
Blessings shall span generations.

Three yang above—
Nothing can invade,
Thus bringing fortune and celebration.
This hexagram brings initial worry,
But later no suffering.
Favorable for household affairs.
*Another version states:*
Affairs begin as the heart desires,
Then office and rank are attained.
Travelers return,
The sick recover,
The household is at peace—
All seeking is greatly auspicious.

**He says:**
Affairs begin with worry,
Then fortune arrives.

**Explanation says:**
Meeting misfortune again and again—
First there is worry.
Now it joins with good fortune—
Ultimately obtaining what is sought.
This hexagram’s upper and lower are both yang,
Without obstruction.
Intentions align with the Dao,
Bringing fortune and blessing—
Taking the image of Heaven.

---

**Timely Action Hexagram (Waiting for the Season Divination)**
*Three-Two-Zero*
Shouldering the plow to till,
In the fourth month, lifting one’s feet.
Diligently seizing the season,
Millet and sorghum flourish.

**Yan says:**
Yang occupies the upper ranks,
Yin holds the central position—
This is the proper principle.
Planting at the right time
Brings great advantage.
In the fourth month, the three yang—
Crops begin to thrive,
Fields and silkworms bring great good fortune.

**He says:**
In all matters, as one wishes,
Only slightly delayed.

**Explanation says:**
Yin follows yang—
The upper position is constant.
Tilling at the proper time—
Fulfilling what is hoped for.
This divination’s three yang hold their positions,
While yin follows—
An image of compliance without opposition.
Yet lacking earthly position,
One must labor diligently and act in season
To reap a harvest.

---

**Harmonizing Virtue Hexagram (Equal Power Divination)**
*Three-Three-Zero*
The enlightened lord above,
Below, no treachery.
Court robes in solemn array,
Great brightness dispels darkness.

**Yan says:**
Above, a wise ruler;
Below, worthy ministers—
Thus no treachery,
And all is in orderly harmony.
This hexagram is greatly auspicious.

**He says:**
Initial worry, then good fortune.
Approaching office brings even greater benefit.
Prisoners soon released,
This hexagram brings great fortune in all affairs.

**Explanation says:**
The lord is enlightened, the ministers good—
No treachery.
Court robes in solemn array—
Not fitting for frequent changes.

**Hexagram of All Yang in Ruler-Minister Positions**
*Three-Three-Zero*
Here, all yang occupies the positions of ruler and ministers,
With no yin or petty men to intervene.
This attains the utmost goodness—
All affairs are auspicious.
One should uphold the old,
Not seek change.
Only in divining marriage is it auspicious;
For two marshes, the outcome is unfavorable.

**Hexagram of Certain Gain**
*Three-Four-Zero*
The Han hound pursues the hare,
The flying hawk seizes the pheasant.
No venture fails to yield,
And what is gained is fully reliable.

**Yan says:**
Three yang above,
Resonating within and without—
A hexagram of orderly compliance.
With running hounds and flying hawks,
No pursuit fails to capture.
This hexagram is especially suited for the hunt.

**He says:**
All affairs begin without end,
Legal troubles disperse,
Silkworms and fields yield great harvest.
Yet he adds:
Though aspirations start grand,
They end with minor loss.

**Explanation says:**
The Han hound pursues the hare—
Yang rides over yin.
Such is the capture,
A great taking of game.
This divination is most favorable for
Pursuing fugitives, quelling rebels,
Managing property, or seeking office.

---

**Hexagram of Avenge Shame**
*Four-One-Zero*
A wife brings food to the fields,
Yet no plowing father appears.
A thieving crow, shameless,
Pecks at my dried meat.
I draw my bow and shoot,
Striking its left wing.

**Yan says:**
Yang’s position is solitary and weak,
Obscured by heavy yin—
Affairs suffer harm,
Thus the crow steals the meat.
Yet yang’s nature,
From weakness to strength,
Will ultimately prevail,
Avenge its shame.

**He says:**
This stems from disputes with others,
Breeding private grievances.
The hexagram portends worry:
Travelers meet misfortune,
Silkworms and fields yield little,
All pursuits prove unfavorable,
Marriages fail,
Legal matters remain unresolved.

**Explanation says:**
No plowing father appears—
Veiled by obscuring growth.
Small strength bears heavy burdens,
Inviting banditry and harm.
Shooting the wing,
Though victory comes, it is punitive.
Here, heavy yin rules above,
A lone yang within—
Yet treachery and theft will ultimately be defeated.
In warfare, initial defeat yields later victory.

---

**Hexagram of Inviting Bandits**
*Four-Two-Zero*
Drunken quarrels erupt,
Blades and staves rise together.
The host, seized by terror,
Binds himself to halt the chaos.

**Yan says:**
Dwelling in a position without rank,
Beneath a throng of yin—
Guest and host breach propriety,
Drunken rage sparks strife.
Only when the host humbles himself
Does the turmoil cease.
This hexagram bodes ill,
Gatherings with guests grow dire.

**He says:**
First, verbal strife,
But in the end, no worry.

**Explanation says:**
Drunken quarrels—
The peril of petty men.
The host binds himself,
To evade their edge.
This divination is unfit for action;
Self-preservation is best.

---

**Hexagram of Knowing When to Stop**
*Four-Three-Zero*
Ahead, bandits and thieves;
Behind, travelers approach.
Whether to advance or halt,
One may yet preserve oneself.

**Yan says:**
Three yang dwell together,
Yet hold no position below.
A throng of yin above,
Like bandits lying in wait.
Yet as the three yang begin to flourish,
Calmly stepping forward,
They cannot be harmed.
Though no great fortune comes,
One may yet preserve oneself.
This hexagram favors small journeys.
He adds:
This hexagram lacks a lower position,
Thus no travelers follow behind.

**He says:**
First, verbal strife,
A desire to return home—
One should pause for now,
To avoid calamity.
All affairs bear minor fault;
Do not proceed,
But defer to what comes later.

**Explanation says:**
A throng of yin above—
Bandits lie ahead.
Having an upper but no lower position—
No one follows behind.
Knowing peril and halting,
One may avoid fault.

---

**Hexagram of Urgent Entanglement**
*Four-Four-Zero*
Suspended in urgency like a noose,
No rescue arrives in time.
Even the example of Gaozi of Lu
Cannot compare.

**Yan says:**
Yang’s power and virtue both wane,
A throng of yin grows ever stronger—
An omen of ruin and chaos.
As when Duke Min of Lu was slain,
Cheng Ji fled to Ju’s neighbor,
And in that winter, Gaozi of Qi came to盟,
Pacifying Lu’s turmoil.
This hexagram foretells initial defeat,
Then later fortune.
He adds:
All affairs demand haste;
Delay brings discord.

**He says:**
All matters require swift action,
Not procrastination.
As when Duke Min of Lu was slain,
And Duke Xi, son of Jizi, fled to Ju’s neighbor,
That winter Gaozi came to盟—
The *Zuo Zhuan* notes: "Gaozi acted in concert,"
To quell Lu’s chaos, hence his name was not recorded.
All affairs begin with defeat,
Then end in fortune.

**Explanation says:**
Suspended in urgency—
Like reaching the utmost extremity.
No rescue arrives in time—
Calamity presses close.
The absence of a lower position
Forms the image of high suspension.
Here, a throng of yin ascends,
Inevitably inviting ruin.
Yet one hopes for rescue from others—
A dire predicament.
All divined affairs bear ill omens.

---

**Hexagram of Reverent Caution**
*Zero-One-One*
Illuminating virtue, blocking transgression,
Affairs lie in following the moment’s flow.
The worthy are cautious at the outset,
The noble guard against the subtle.

**Yan says:**
Though the upper position is vacant,
The hexagram is wholly yang—
Sufficient to illuminate its great virtue,
And block all wrongdoing.
He adds:
All affairs should move with the season,
While guarding against the subtle.

**He says:**
All affairs should follow the moment’s flow,
Then one’s aspirations may be fulfilled.
As Zang Xi Bo said in the *Zuo Zhuan*:
"Illuminate virtue, block transgression,
To oversee the hundred officials."
This hexagram is greatly auspicious for approaching office.

**Explanation says:**
Illuminating virtue, blocking transgression—
This lies in following the season.
Caution from beginning to end
Requires guarding against the subtle.
This divination favors knowing the moment,
And acting with uprightness.

---

**Hexagram of the Emperor’s Dao**
*Zero-One-Two*
Heaven and earth share their work,
Yin and yang commune.
Endeavors vast and boundless,
From west to east.
Coming and going, moving and dwelling—
Hard to trace their path.

**Yan says:**
Heaven and earth first commune,
Grasses and trees just begin—
No tracks yet appear.
Requests meet no response,
Travelers have not returned.

**He says:**
Aspirations grand yet hard to achieve,
Beyond measure.

**Explanation says:**
Heaven and earth share their work—
Yin and yang attain harmony.
Endeavors vast and boundless—
Progress knows no limit.
Hard to trace their path—
Beyond reckoning.
This divination is greatly auspicious
For establishing merit and undertaking great deeds.

---

**Hexagram of Indecision**
*Zero-One-Three*
Like a fox, hesitant and wavering,
The mind remains unsettled.

**Hexagram of Hesitation**
*Zero-One-Three*
Advance yields no hope;
Retreat must follow right.
**Yan says:**
Though the superior position is vacant,
The host of yang strive in rivalry—
An image of indecision.
Inner and outer lack response,
Thus hesitation lingers.
To act against reason
Is not as good as retreating to uphold right.

**He says:**
Advance and retreat remain uncertain,
Hard to follow the heart.
Nearly all matters are thus.

**Explanation says:**
Hesitant as a fox,
No path to follow.
Advance yields no hope—
The heart wavers.
Retreat must follow right—
Lest one fall into misfortune.
This hexagram depicts a time without a ruler’s position,
While the host of yang lie below,
Without fixed direction—
Hence the fox’s hesitation.
Yang exists without yin,
Inner and outer lack response.
Thus advance yields no hope;
Better to retreat and follow right.
In divination, stillness brings good fortune.

---

**Hexagram of Treacherous Deceit**
*Zero-One-Four*
Defying Heaven, betraying the lord,
Disordering human relations.
Indulgent and treacherous,
All gnash their teeth in rage.

**Yan says:**
Above, no heavenly position;
Within, solitary and weak.
The host of yin usurp command—
Thus arise those who defy and betray,
Treacherous schemers who shun the upright,
Whose words target the good.
Holding office brings greater misfortune;
Litigation lacks reason.

**He says:**
Others blame them,
For their own wantonness—
Hence "gnashing teeth,"
Speaking of deep resentment.
This hexagram is greatly inauspicious.

**Explanation says:**
A lone yang amid the host of yin—
The minister loses his place.
Petty men run rampant,
None can restrain them.
This divination shows no heavenly position above,
A weak and solitary center below,
While the host of yin ally below,
Acting wantonly—
An image of defying Heaven and betraying the lord.
In divination, nothing is not inauspicious.

---

**Hexagram of Reversal**
*Zero-Two-One*
Above and below inverted,
All affairs lose propriety.
East and west diverge,
No longer following one another.

**Yan says:**
Matters proceed,
Yet none align with the heart—
For yin and yang are misplaced.

What is done brings no benefit;
What is sought finds no harmony.

**He says:**
To advance or act in seeking matters,
Relying on others, all may succeed—
But delay brings fortune.
The sick suffer in the heart and belly,
Recovery will be slow.
Travelers wish to return;
In all things, delay brings good fortune.

**Explanation says:**
Above and below are overturned—
The soft overcomes the hard.
East and west diverge—
Hopes are dashed.
This hexagram shows no heavenly position above,
While yin and yang are inverted below.
All affairs are perverse and inauspicious.
The diviner must act with caution.

---

**Hexagram of Primal Virtue**
*Zero-Two-Two*
Deep thought and far-reaching reflection,
Dwelling in peace yet wary of danger.
Though no harm exists now,
Ultimately, collapse and loss will come.
Always follow the right Way;
Beware of deceit and fraud.

**Yan says:**
Pure yin without yang
Cannot ensure lasting good fortune—
Thus danger and defeat appear.
This hexagram brings temporary ease,
But later, blame will come.

**He says:**
In all matters, deep thought and far-reaching reflection are fitting.
Though all is peaceful now,
Ultimately, it will not be favorable.

**Explanation says:**
Soft and weak, resting in ease—
Yet in the end, collapse and loss come,
For there is no master.
Always follow the right Way,
Then one does not lose their place.
This divination shows two yin in alignment below,
With no master above—
A fleeting peace,
Yet ultimately unable to stand firm.
The diviner must uphold rightness
To preserve themselves.
If they act recklessly,
Danger and defeat will surely come.

---

**Hexagram of Vigilance**
*Zero-Two-Three*
Virtue dispels misfortune;
Reverence and caution are fitting.
Though now constrained,
Fortune and emolument will come of themselves.

**Yan says:**
This hexagram transforms its lower yin into yang—
Virtue suffices to dispel misfortune,
Ultimately bringing blessed prosperity.
In all matters, initial small worries
Will later yield great good fortune.

**He says:**
Fortune and emolument will surely come,
Though slightly delayed.
Matters will follow one’s will.

**Explanation says:**
Virtue dispels misfortune—
Yang rises below yin.
Fortune and emolument come of themselves—
Ultimately, the heart’s desire is attained.
This hexagram shows yin and yang misaligned,
Yet the three yang are strong and vigorous,
Yin cannot overcome them—
Thus the image of virtue dispelling misfortune.
Though misfortune may arise at first,
Ultimately, great good fortune comes.
Its power is natural,
Not requiring pursuit.
In divination, all matters are auspicious.

---

**Hexagram of Yin Treachery**
*Zero-Two-Four*
Yin treachery plots rebellion,
Unfavorable for descendants.
Though momentarily content,
Later, no peace will come.

**Yan says:**
Transforming yang into yin—
This is the image of treachery.
Yin treachery schemes harm,
Descendants will dwindle—
Thus "unfavorable for descendants."
In this hexagram, all matters and undertakings
Initially bring good fortune,
But later, harm.

**He says:**
Though matters may now align with one’s wishes,
Later, they will not be auspicious.

**Explanation says:**
Yin treachery plots destruction—
Petty men seize their moment.
Yet in the end, no peace comes—
Ultimately, no refuge remains.
This divination brings initial good fortune,
But later misfortune.

---

**Hexagram of Auspicious Encounter**
*Zero-Three-One*
Stepping out, one meets good fortune,
Aligning with the good.
A bright pearl shines at night,
So I am not led astray.

**Yan says:**
This hexagram brings good fortune in all things—
Travelers, merchants, farming, and sericulture
All gain good fortune.
For officials, it brings honor and prominence—
A greatly auspicious hexagram.

**He says:**
Having met good fortune,
And illuminated by a bright pearl,
All matters are without misfortune;
All undertakings succeed.

**Explanation says:**
Stepping out, one meets good fortune—
Finding one’s kind.
A bright pearl shines at night—
Though dark, it is not blind.
This divination shows yang finding its kind,
Without losing order.
The three’s firm brightness
Suffices to illuminate the dark—
Truly aligning with the good.
In all matters, good fortune.

---

**Hexagram of Peace and Prosperity**
*Zero-Three-Two*
Heaven wanes, earth rests;
The worthy hold their posts.
Journeys return, illness fades—
Boundless benefit, no limit.

**Yan says:**
Yin and yang each hold their place;
The noble remain still and guard themselves.
In all matters, returning to the root brings great good fortune.

**He says:**
What is sought cannot be rushed;
All matters follow the heart—
A greatly auspicious hexagram.

**Explanation says:**
The worthy hold their posts—
Positions are proper and constant.
Journeys return, illness fades—
Gains without loss.
In this divination, what is sought
Cannot be rushed—
Then all matters follow the heart,
Bringing good fortune.

**Hexagram of Preserving Life**
*Zero-Three-Three*
The phoenix holds a pearl in its beak,
Alighting in the corner of my courtyard.
Fortune comes to me,
Misfortune is driven away.

**Yan says:**
In an age where the high hold no position,
Only one who governs with pure firmness
Sees the omen of good fortune.
Misfortune dissolves, fortune arrives—
The phoenix, most sacred of omens.
The pearl, a treasure of delight:
All that is sought shall be attained.

**He says:**
Fortune and emolument draw near—
A greatly auspicious and beneficial hexagram.

**Explanation says:**
The phoenix alights in the courtyard—
The radiance of worthy virtue.
Fortune arrives, misfortune departs—
All good converges.
In this divination, nothing is inauspicious,
Save for seeking rain, which thwarts desire.

---

**Hexagram of Upholding Worthiness in Decline**
*Zero-Three-Four*
The noble stand firm,
The petty bow low.
A luminous lord governs the age,
Distinguishing purple from crimson.

**Yan says:**
Abiding in the stability of a weighty position,
They emit the illumination of three yang.
As the *Book of Changes* says:
“This is the time when the petty must not be employed.”
Seeking office brings great fortune;
All other matters attain their proper principle.

**He says:**
A wise ruler presides above,
The noble are employed—
All wishes follow the heart.
The petty submit in lowliness,
As reason dictates.

**Explanation says:**
The noble attain their positions—
The petty submit.
Distinguishing crimson from purple,
Each holds their proper post.
In this hexagram, yin and yang each occupy their rightful place:
Firm brightness shines from above,
While yielding yin follows below.
In divination, matters attain their principle;
Both noble and petty know good fortune.

---

**Hexagram of the Ascending Dragon**
*Zero-Four-One*
The hidden dragon prepares to rise,
Dark clouds gather above.
The world receives blessings—
First adversity, then joy.

**Yan says:**
Though the beginning is inauspicious,
The end brings great fortune.
One yang lies below—
As in the *Book of Changes*, the “hidden dragon” of the first nine,
Poised to ascend as clouds arise.
Welcoming it, they soar together,
Riding the empty sky—
An omen of harmony between lord and minister across the land.

**He says:**
This hexagram begins in adversity but ends in prosperity;
All matters bring good fortune.

**Explanation says:**
The hidden dragon meets the clouds—
Ascending to heaven.
First adversity, then joy—
Advance without hindrance.
This hexagram has no heaven above,
Only one yang beneath four yin—
Thus the image of the hidden dragon meeting clouds.
Though the beginning is fraught with difficulty,
The end brings success—
A greatly auspicious hexagram.

---

**Hexagram of Overturning and Prosperity**
*Zero-Four-Two*
The celestial dragon rages,
The thunder lord beats his drum.
Clouds gather, rain descends,
Floodwaters surge across the earth.

**Yan says:**
Pure yin occupies a time without response,
Unable to dispel calamity or avert disaster—
Thus the day when thunder and lightning clash,
And floodwaters bring ruin.
This hexagram brings regret in all matters:
Travelers, marriages, and commerce all meet misfortune.

**He says:**
Rain flows, sweeping all clean—
A hexagram of instability in all matters.

**Explanation says:**
The celestial dragon rages—
Yin rises above.
Floodwaters surge across the earth—
Nothing can withstand them.
In this divination, all undertakings are inauspicious,
Save for seeking rain.

---

**Hexagram of Withdrawing from the World**
*Zero-Four-Three*
The petty gain power,
The noble lose the Way.
Abandoning my halls and home,
I enter the deep grasses.

**Yan says:**
Bright yang virtue retreats to a lowly place,
While dark yin usurps the central position—
An image of worthy men suppressed and stagnant.
Thus they forsake their halls,
Dwelling far away in the marshes and grasses,
Cultivating their resolve in seclusion,
Awaiting their time.
This hexagram favors retreat, not advance.

**He says:**
Overpowered by yin,
They lose their rightful place.

**Explanation says:**
The petty gain power—
Yin overcomes yang.
Entering the deep grasses—
Their position is improper.
In this hexagram, yin and yang are misaligned;
All matters favor retreat and shun advance.

---

**Hexagram of Ghostly Activity**
*Zero-Four-Four*
Two ghosts dwell together,
Ever hungry, ever hollow.
They wish to enter the gate,
But fear this talisman.

**Yan says:**
An image of accumulated yin—
Ghosts are about to bring harm.
With no master for sacrifices,
They are said to be hungry and hollow.
The ghosts dare not approach,
Fearing the talisman.
This hexagram favors reciting scriptures and mantras
To expel malevolent spirits;
Sacrifices bring good fortune.

**He says:**
Fortune departs, misfortune arrives—
One should cultivate merit and virtue,
Perform good deeds to dispel evil.
The sick should inscribe talismans
And recite the *Ruan* incantation to recover.
Fields and silkworms yield meager harvests—
A hexagram of constant hardship.

**Explanation says:**
Two ghosts dwell together—
Yin’s malevolence accumulates.
Fearing this sacred talisman,
They are left with nowhere to go.
In this hexagram, two yin lie below,
With no position above—
No ancestral temple or master for sacrifices,
Thus they are homeless ghosts.
Though the celestial position is empty,
Luminous brightness presides above,
Preventing the ghosts from approaching,
As if a talisman barred their entry.
In divination, all matters meet great hardship;
The sick should be treated with talismans and incantations.

---

**Hexagram of Slight Loss**
*One-Zero-One*
Climbing a tree to pluck mulberry leaves,
I fall to the ground, sprawled and prone.
The eastern neighbor has medicine—
I rush to ask for the prescription.
There I meet a skilled physician,
And escape unbroken, unharmed.

**Yan says:**
Seeking something, one incurs this affliction;
Proceeding further to make amends brings good fortune.
Also:
Yin loses its yin position,
The yang line has no response.
Like ascending high only to fall,
Yet with yang present in the center,
No yin disaster befalls.
Seeking a prescription from the eastern neighbor
Averts injury—
For the east is the beginning of yang,
And supplication brings good fortune.

**He says:**
The sick should return to where the illness began
And make amends—this brings good fortune.
Travelers have not returned;
Legal matters are difficult to resolve.

**Explanation says:**
Climbing a tree, falling to the ground—
Ascending high brings peril.
Asking for the prescription, obtaining medicine—
In the end, no loss is suffered.
In this hexagram, above and below are both yang,
With no yin—
Though disaster strikes, it is not severe.
The east is the beginning of yang,
Thus one seeks the prescription from the eastern neighbor
And finds a physician.
The sick are in distress—
They should return to where they incurred the affliction
And make amends; this brings good fortune.

---

**Hexagram of Initial Harmony**
*One-Zero-Two*
Like a newlywed bride,
Unaccustomed to her home.
With diligent effort and self-reliance,
She will bear children in time.

**Yan says:**
Though lacking a central position,
Yin and yang are in harmony,
Inner and outer in accord.

**Like Newlyweds, Harmony Comes Later**
First harmony comes after marriage.
In all matters, when responses align,
One may rely on oneself.
Be vigilant day and night, as if facing peril—
Only then will fortune come.
Illness and official matters bring no suffering;
All affairs turn auspicious.

**He says:**
Marriage begins without harmony but ends in accord.
Trade, business, and all undertakings prosper.
Official matters remain difficult to resolve.

**Explanation says:**
The bride is newly wed, unaccustomed to her home—
Their bond is not yet deep.
With diligent effort and self-reliance,
They build their household.
In this hexagram, yang is above and yin below,
Each in its proper place, yet not yet intimate.
Like a new bride, their connection exists but is not yet profound.
Yet the central position is unobstructed;
Though distant at first, they grow close in time.
Thus, with perseverance and effort, harmony is ultimately achieved.
For matters facing obstacles, one must apply force—
Even in military campaigns, resolution comes in the end.

**Hexagram of Barren Soil**
*One-Zero-Three*
The earth is high, the stone unyielding;
One looks up and pleads to heaven.
The plow lies idle, the hoe unused—
The fields stand barren, the crops sparse.

**Yan says:**
Within and without, all is yang,
With no yin qi.
Moisture cannot penetrate;
Plowing and sowing are in vain.

**He says:**
All matters require action—
Seek, and you shall attain.
Without seeking, it is like famine from no plowing,
Or drought from no rain.
Ordinary affairs fare as usual;
Silkworms and fields follow the same pattern.

**Explanation says:**
The earth is high, the stone unyielding—
Hardness without harmony.
Looking up to plead to heaven,
There is nothing to be done.
In this hexagram, three yang lines occupy the earthly positions,
With no yang above and no one in the central place—
Isolated, unable to nurture life.
All matters are hollow;
Labor yields no results.

---

**Hexagram of Malevolent Spirits**
*One-Zero-Four*
Evil spirits dwell in the house,
Sitting in pairs, watching.
They wait for transgressions,
Cutting off water and fire.
Heavenly and earthly spirits
Lie in wait for human faults.

**Yan says:**
Yin and yang are unobstructed,
Yet cannot restrain one another.
The human position is empty,
Leaving nothing to govern the household—
Thus, malevolent spirits fill the space.
This hexagram bodes ill for all matters;
For divining residences or illness, it is especially ominous.

**He says:**
One should perform rites to cultivate blessings and avert misfortune,
And take great care with water and fire.

**Explanation says:**
Evil spirits in the house arise from accumulated yin qi.
Yang is solitary and cut off,
With no one in the central position.
Water and fire are severed—
The human path withers.
This hexagram is inauspicious for all matters.

---

**Hexagram of Emptiness**
*Two-Zero-One*
Felling trees in water,
Fishing on a mountain.
Wasted effort, lost strength—
Empty hands, hollow words.

**Yan says:**
The human position is vacant,
Heaven and earth inverted.
Attempting deeds or creating things—
All come to naught.
Thus it is said:
Felling trees in water,
Fishing on a mountain—
Nothing is gained.
This hexagram portends great misfortune for marriage,
And illness cannot be cured—
For yin and yang are overturned.

**He says:**
Travelers do not return,
The ill grow gravely worse,
Marriages fail to unite,
Official matters are hard to resolve—
Nothing is favorable.

**Explanation says:**
Felling trees in water defies the proper course.
Empty hands, hollow words—
There is nothing to sustain life.
In this hexagram, yin and yang are inverted,
With no human position—
Like fishing on a mountain or felling trees in water.
What is sought cannot be obtained;
All matters are inauspicious.

---

**Hexagram of Two Widows**
*Two-Zero-Two*
Two women without husbands,
Quarreling, living apart.
They go out and return by different paths,
Dwelling in separate chambers.

**Yan says:**
Within and without, all is yin,
Their wills do not align.
Like two women without husbands,
They inevitably contend.
Residences bring misfortune;
Marriages do not succeed.
This hexagram is inauspicious for all matters—
Two yin lack a master.

*The Book of Changes* says:
"Two women dwelling together,
Their wills do not harmonize."
This hexagram is greatly inauspicious.

**He says:**
It is as if there is an intent to separate,
Like moving yet not fully moving.

**Explanation says:**
Above and below are two yin—
Women without husbands.
Going out and returning by different paths,
The chamber is empty.
In this hexagram, above and below are both yin,
With no master in the center—
Thus the image of two women without husbands,
Their wills unaligned, dwelling apart.
For the diviner, all matters run counter;
What is sought brings misfortune.

---

**Hexagram of Repeated Peril**
*Two-Zero-Three*
Two follow one another,
Seeking to avoid danger.
They encounter calamity and fall into a well—
Strength and effort are in vain.

**Yan says:**
Seeking to evade yin’s harm,
They lose their position.
As if falling into a well in peril,
Hands and feet remain, yet strength cannot be applied.
Nothing is accomplished;
Construction and planning often fail.
Traveling afar is most inauspicious.

**He says:**
Desiring action, there is nowhere to apply force.
What is sought is not obtained;
What is done does not succeed.
For divining illness, it is especially ominous.

**Explanation says:**
Seeking to avoid danger,
Their hearts are suspicious.
Encountering calamity and falling into a well—
How lamentable.
In this hexagram, lesser yin is above,
Firm yang below—
Their wills do not align.
Thus, they begin in suspicion and end in mutual ruin.
This hexagram is inauspicious for all matters.

---

**Hexagram of Yin’s Depletion**
*Two-Zero-Four*
Frost and snow swirl,
Soaking my robes.
The north wind blows upon me—
I cannot return home.

**Yan says:**
Yin qi prevails,
Within and without, no master.
Adrift in wind and snow,
The path home is lost.
This hexagram brings many faults;
For travelers, it is especially inauspicious.
Seeking office or trade—
Nothing goes as desired.

**He says:**
Nothing is accomplished;
There is slander and flattery—
One must be cautious.

**Explanation says:**
Frost and snow swirl—
Yin qi gathers.
Unable to return home,
There is no household.
This hexagram is inauspicious for all matters—
Keep far from it.

---

**Hexagram of Futile Effort**
*Three-Zero-One*
Journeying east to gather herbs,
One ascends Mount Tai.
No magic mushrooms are found—
Only fragrant orchids.
Orchids are not urgently needed;
One returns empty-handed.

**Yan says:**
Within and without, pure yang—
They do not respond.
Doubled hardness above,
Like towering mountains.
The central position is discordant—
Difficult to achieve merit.
Seeking herbs and finding orchids—
An image of hollow beauty.

**Matters of Hollow Repute**
*Three-Zero-One*
All affairs bear names without substance—
Hearing joy, one feels no joy;
Hearing sorrow, one feels no sorrow.

**He says:**
Marching troops meet no fortune;
All pursuits fall short of desire.

**Explanation says:**
Seeking herbs and finding orchids—
Beauty without substance.
Returning empty-handed—
A cause for shame.
This hexagram has three yang above,
An image of towering mountains.
Within and without, pure yang—
Yet the center holds no position, no resonance.
Thus, hollow beauty yields no effect.
Merit is difficult to establish;
One must not act.

---

**Hexagram of Rain Disaster and Hardship**
*Three-Zero-Two*
Ceaseless downpours,
Floodwaters surge to the heavens.
People dwell in nests,
Without fire or kinship.

**Yan says:**
Within and without, the lines are correct,
But the central position is empty.
Yin and yang clash—
Thus, rain falls without end.
Above, three lines—
An image of nest-dwelling.
This hexagram brings manifold faults;
All undertakings grow more ominous.

**He says:**
An image of impending chaos—
Nothing goes as it should.

**Explanation says:**
Floodwaters surge to the heavens—
Yin qi grows long.
Dwelling in nests without kinship—
Strife stirs above.
This hexagram has three yang above,
While lesser yin lengthens below.
The center lacks a master—
Thus, desire manifests as rain and flood.
Yang rules above,
Yet cannot make a home—
An image of nest-dwelling without fire.
To the diviner, this portends misfortune.

---

**Hexagram of Rain Disaster and Exhaustion**
*Three-Zero-Three*
Scorching drought brings calamity—
Heaven and earth parched.
One pleads to the dragon above,
Seeks springs below.
Anxious and fearful,
All are unsettled.

**Yan says:**
Heaven and earth are both yang—
An image of extreme yang.
Pleading to the dragon, seeking springs—
Yet nothing stirs.
This hexagram is greatly inauspicious;
Fields and silkworms yield no profit.

**He says:**
Drought and scorching bring disaster—
Above, no benevolent moisture;
Below, resentment festers.
Nothing comes to fruition.
Marriage, wealth-seeking, construction—
All are unfavorable.

**Explanation says:**
Heaven and earth are both yang,
Without a human position.
Solitary yang cannot generate—
Thus, disaster and drought arise.
In divination, nothing succeeds.

---

**Hexagram of Distant Pursuit and Flight**
*Three-Zero-Four*
Chasing fugitive bandits,
One reaches Lelang.

**Hexagram of Reclaiming Lost Treasures**
*Three-Zero-Five*
Thus, my treasured jade is reclaimed,
My cattle and sheep are led back.

**Yan says:**
Heaven and earth correspond,
Yin and yang hold their positions.
Thus, one journeys far to the seas,
Illuminating and exalting nine generations.
Yet on the road, there is no master—
The treasured jade, cattle, and sheep
Inevitably fall to bandits.
This hexagram is slightly auspicious.
For military campaigns, there is victory;
Lelang lies in the Eastern Sea.

**He says:**
If one seizes others’ possessions,
It will bring misfortune.
Hasten to return them, and it will be auspicious.
Or if household items are taken when they should not be,
This, too, is inauspicious.

**Explanation says:**
Pursuing bandits and capturing fugitives
Is a journey to achieve conquest.
Reaching Lelang
Is the toil of a distant expedition.
Leading back my cattle and sheep
Is reclaiming what was lost.
This divination shows yin and yang in their proper positions, responding to one another,
Yet lacking a central position—
Thus, it bears the image of being robbed,
Of suffering loss.
One must exert effort in a distant campaign before awaiting success.
The diviner labors first, then achieves;
In warfare, there is initial hardship, then victory.

---

**Hexagram of Thieves and Bonds**
*Four-Zero-One*
Thieves seize precious treasures,
Desiring to make them their own.
People expose their deceit,
Ghosts bind their arms.

**Yan says:**
Yin occupies heaven’s position,
While yang is cast below—
Like petty men usurping the vessels of gentlemen,
Drawing the censure of both men and spirits.

**He says:**
If illness arises from seizing others’ possessions,
Hasten to return them.
Guard against gossip;
This hexagram is greatly inauspicious.

**Explanation says:**
Thieves seize precious treasures,
But ghosts bind them—
They cannot possess them.
This, too, is shameful.
This divination arises from a single yin residing in heaven’s position,
Where it does not belong—
This is theft.
Though yang is solitary and weak,
It is not something we can suddenly claim.
Thus, men and spirits both strike,
And there is no escape.
All divined matters are inauspicious,
Except for capturing thieves, which will surely succeed.

---

**Hexagram of Military Defeat and Calamity**
*Four-Zero-Two*
Defying the Dao, violating principle,
Yin and yang wound one another.
August Heaven offers no protection—
Instead, one reaps disaster.

**Yan says:**
Yin usurps yang’s position,
Thus, it is called defiance and rebellion.
In all matters, following principle brings auspiciousness;
Violating principle brings misfortune.

**He says:**
Illness is difficult to cure,
Legal matters do not resolve,
Those who hear lawsuits are harmed,
Military campaigns lose discipline,
Merchants profit little.

**Explanation says:**
Defying the Dao, violating principle—
Positions are improper.
Yin and yang wound one another—
This cannot endure.
This divination arises from extreme yin occupying the upper position,
Defying the Dao.
With no human position in the center
And no correspondence below,
Though it may usurp for a time,
Disaster lurks within.
All divined matters are inauspicious.

---

**Hexagram of Cliques and the Suppression of Worthies**
*Four-Zero-Three*
The crooked advance, the upright retreat,
Failing to hold their rightful posts.
Worthy men hide in seclusion,
Gentlemen sigh in despair.

**Yan says:**
Yin advances, yang retreats—
Thus, it is called loss of office.
Worthy men and gentlemen
Cannot be employed,
So they hide in seclusion and sigh.
As the saying goes:
“Promote the upright, set them above the crooked,
And the people will submit.
Promote the crooked, set them above the upright,
And the people will not submit.”

**He says:**
Nothing succeeds;
It is best to withdraw and act with integrity.
If public words go unheeded,
Adapting to the times brings auspiciousness.
Gentlemen meet misfortune,
Petty men meet good fortune.

**Explanation says:**
The crooked advance, the upright retreat—
This is inversion.
Petty men seize the moment,
Gentlemen withdraw.
This divination shows a host of yin usurping power,
While yang is relegated below,
Far from intimacy—
Thus, it bears the image of the crooked advancing, the upright retreating,
Worthy men hiding in seclusion.
In all matters, it is best to retreat;
Holding to integrity brings auspiciousness.

---

**Hexagram of Verbal Strife and Auspicious Expenditure**
*Four-Zero-Four*
The eastern household takes a bride,
The western neighbor hosts a feast.
With clamor and clatter, they bind the swine,
With yelps and barks, they beat the dogs.
Be vigilant against misfortune,
To avoid external calamity.

**Yan says:**
Matters arise from a single gathering;
Do not partake in their hall—
This is auspicious.
Or if there is a wedding rite, it is auspicious,
For it is a gathering of like-minded friends.

**He says:**
Inner and outer positions are evenly matched:
Though the eastern household has the joy of a bride,
The western neighbor can still host a feast.
The two families slaughter dogs and beat swine,
Vying in extravagance,
Futilely scheming and comparing—
Both will face verbal strife.
It is also said:
This hexagram brings disputes, legal matters, and marriages—
Only by yielding possessions will it be auspicious.
For the ill, performing good deeds is advised.
This hexagram is middling.

**Explanation says:**
Taking a bride, hosting a feast—
Inner and outer are evenly matched.
If they compete without expiation,
Calamity will surely follow.
This divination shows both upper and lower as extreme yin,
Their forms evenly matched.
One household takes a bride, the other hosts a feast,
Competing in revelry,
Indulging without restraint—
This is the nature of petty men:
Joy reaches its peak, then turns to excess,
And sorrow arises.
Thus, if one can exercise restraint, misfortune may be avoided;
Otherwise, disputes and violent conflicts will ensue.
The diviner must be cautious.

---

**Hexagram of the Unmanifest**
*One-Zero-Zero*
Primordial qi first stirs,
The myriad things are yet unformed.
Light has not yet merged,
Entrance and exit are shrouded in darkness.
Just as it begins to move and take shape,
Nothing comes to fruition.

**Yan says:**
One is the beginning of the myriad things,
Yang qi first stirs,
Yet light has not yet emerged.
It originates from a single line,
Seeking the multitude of forms.
In all matters, there is delay;
Nothing can be swiftly accomplished.

**He says:**
Affairs do not succeed,
The ill recover on their own,
All matters are middling,
Desires remain unfulfilled.

**Explanation says:**
Primordial qi first stirs,
Yet nothing accompanies it.
Entrance and exit are shrouded in darkness—
Profound and unfathomable.
This hexagram shows that affairs do not succeed;
All matters are middling.

---

**Hexagram of Transience and Subtlety**
*Two-Zero-Zero*
From heaven, images are established,
Qi still drifts and wanders.
Unable to settle,
It flows east and west.

**Yan says:**
From one to two, the steps begin to multiply,
Yet the foundation’s traces have just emerged.
The human path is not yet established—
Thus, it drifts and flows,
Unable to find stability,
An image of aimless wandering.
Desires cannot be fulfilled.

**He says:**
Human affairs are unsettled—
An omen of incompletion.

**Explanation says:**
From heaven, images are established—
Its Dao is subtle.
Flowing east and west—
No foundation is laid.

**Hexagram of Unsettled Affairs**
*Three-Zero-Zero*
Heaven and earth establish forms,
And humans are transformed into life.
Following qi’s ascent and descent,
They cannot find peace.

**Yan says:**
Rulers and ministers are intermingled,
With no fixed abode.
Left to come and go freely,
No restraint binds them.
Though this hexagram bears no great fault,
All matters remain discordant.

**He says:**
In all affairs, there must be obstruction—
Desires cannot be fulfilled.

**Explanation says:**
Heaven and earth establish forms—
This is the inception of life.
Following qi’s ascent and descent—
No settled dwelling is found.
This hexagram suggests some direction,
But one must not force action.

---

**Hexagram of Death’s Image**
*Four-Zero-Zero*
Humans are born to die,
And ghostly qi then arises.
The four seasons are complete,
Cold and heat succeed one another.
Sunken and obscured, unseen—
Its body congeals in yin.

**Yan says:**
Above lies layered yin,
Below, no yang position—
This is the image of death.
The dead are cut off from creation,
Yin and yang part ways,
The four seasons shift.
For the ill, worry deepens;
Its body is dark yin—
The image of ghosts.
**He says:**
In old age, as one nears the end,
Hosts of ghosts return—
An omen of misfortune.

**Explanation says:**
Layered yin, profound and dark—
It reaches its utmost above.
Yang qi is faint and obstructed—
The human Dao comes to an end.
Sunken and obscured, unseen—
How dire it is!
This hexagram foretells death in illness,
And misfortune in all matters.

---

**Hexagram of Radiant Yang**
*Zero-One-Zero*
Heaven’s light descends,
Sun and moon shine forth.
All things act as clouds,
And all that have feet walk.

**Yan says:**
A single yang shines alone—
Thus, it is called "Heaven’s Light."
All things that live
Must rely on sun and moon.
Though this hexagram brings minor difficulties,
There is hope in the end.

**He says:**
In all matters, one should deliberate carefully—
Do not rely entirely on others for good fortune.

**Explanation says:**
Heaven’s light descends—
The human Dao prospers.
All that have feet walk—
No darkness remains.
This hexagram, with one yang at its center,
Is the image of sun and moon’s radiance,
On which all beings depend.
In seeking affairs, success may be hoped for, though delayed.

---

**Hexagram of Year’s Abundance**
*Zero-Two-Zero*
Heaven and earth open and connect,
All things flourish.
Affairs are now decided—
A great harvest in the year.

**Yan says:**
This hexagram resembles the one above,
With heaven and earth’s power of sowing and planting,
Leading to great abundance.
It portends minor good fortune.

**He says:**
In all matters, good fortune comes late—
Do not seek swift results.
Act with rectitude,
And all will follow suit.

**Explanation says:**
The human Dao approaches prosperity.
This hexagram, from one to two,
Shows gradual increase—
In seeking affairs, progress comes step by step.

---

**Hexagram of Human Affairs**
*Zero-Three-Zero*
Human affairs arise—
Auspicious, with no misfortune.
Those who stay gain fortune,
Those who travel will arrive.

**Yan says:**
Three yangs reside in the center—
The human Dao begins to flourish.
Though lacking support,
Great good fortune will ultimately come.

**He says:**
In all matters that arise,
All will be unimpeded.
Travelers will return as scheduled.

**Explanation says:**
Human affairs arise—
Yang stands at the center.
Auspicious, with no misfortune—
Great success in the end.
This hexagram, with three yangs emerging from earth,
Is the time of the *jianyin* month,
When human affairs begin.
Heaven and earth unite in harmony—
Auspicious, with no misfortune.

---

**Hexagram of Preserving the Self**
*Zero-Four-Zero*
Ghostly qi is not yet formed,
Perilous toxins have no shape.
Guard and tend to life,
And the household will be at peace.

**Yan says:**
The central position holds the human image—
Thus, ghostly qi is not yet formed.
Yet it occupies a weak yin position,
With no interaction.
One should guard and withdraw cautiously,
Acting in secret, not openly.
If assailed by ghostly perils,
Any action will fail—
No good fortune comes.

**He says:**
One should preserve the self
And remain tranquil.

**Explanation says:**
Ghostly qi is not yet formed—
There is no support.
Guard and tend to life—
Peaceful dwelling is fitting.
This hexagram, with yin in a yang position,
Has no firm foundation.
The diviner should be prudent,
Withdrawing and guarding the self in secret—
Then no fault will arise.

---

**Hexagram of Transformation and Nurturance**
*Zero-Zero-One*
Bright, bright is the high heaven,
Shining upon the earth below.
Transforming and nurturing all life,
Opening and unfolding doors.
All affairs become clear,
Mutually gazing upon one another.

**Yan says:**
Earth, paired with heaven,
Must receive its radiance,
Moistening all sprouts below,
Enabling them to grow.
**He says:**
In all matters, follow the heart’s intent,
Though progress may be slow—
This hexagram bears no fault.

**Explanation says:**
High heaven shines upon the earth—
To bring forth life.
Mutually gazing in darkness—
No thing fails to flourish.
This hexagram, with yang coming to dwell in earth’s position,
Is the image of high heaven’s illumination.
In affairs, there is initial success but no great achievement—
Yet no fault arises.

---

**Hexagram of Earth’s Benefit**
*Zero-Zero-Two*
Foundations are established, affairs settled,
Humans and things align in rectitude.
Drinking pure, eating sweet,
Each preserves its nature.

**Yan says:**
Heaven as one, earth as two—
Thus, the foundation is already laid.
Humans and things, following this,
Each rectify their natures—
Minor good fortune in all matters.

**He says:**
Success comes slightly late,
For the other has not yet grown—
An image of good fortune in all things.

**Explanation says:**
Foundations are established, affairs settled—
The Dao of earth is complete.
Drinking pure, eating sweet—
Each preserves its nature.
In seeking affairs with this hexagram,
There is good fortune from beginning to end.

---

**Hexagram of Establishing the Season**
*Zero-Zero-Three*
Affairs flourish, works arise,
Heroes lay foundations.
Sages and worthies save the world,
Laws and decrees attain principle.

**Yan says:**
Three yangs occupy the lower position—
The image of flourishing works and arising affairs.
To create foundations,
None but heroes can achieve success.
Thus, they clarify laws to save the world.

**He says:**
In all matters, there will be words from others
To assist in decision and action.

**Explanation says:**
Affairs flourish, works arise—
The Dao of yang is established.
Sages and worthies save the world—
Advancing to accomplish great deeds.
This hexagram, with three yangs in earth’s position,
Lays foundations and establishes enterprises.
Its vigor and strength suffice for action,
With none to obstruct it.

**For the Querent: Greatly Fitting to Act**
All affairs are wholly auspicious.

**Funeral Hexagram: All Yin**
*Zero-Zero-Four*
Nurturing life, sending off the dead,
Sacrifices pure and abundant.
The filial son leans on his staff,
Clothing coarse, the omen dire.

**Yan says:**
This hexagram is of yin numbers—
The extreme of the ten thousand things.
Receiving qi from Heaven,
Born to become human, dying to return to earth,
Thus it is called nurturing life and sending off the dead.
Through sacrificial rites,
The affairs of the filial son are made clear—
The passing of kin.

**He says:**
This hexagram concerns the filial son with living parents,
Who must be utmost in devotion,
For there may be mourning ahead.
In divining illness, it is exceedingly inauspicious;
All affairs are unfavorable.

**Explanation says:**
Nurturing life, sending off the dead—
The human Dao is exhausted.
The bodily form returns to earth,
To merge with the indistinct.
This hexagram is the image of utter distress;
In divination, there is nothing it does not portend as dire.

**Formless Yin Hexagram**
*Zero-Zero-Zero*
Yin spreads formless,
The omen’s shape not yet formed.
Act and there will be regret;
Retreat to preserve integrity.

**Yan says:**
All twelve pieces are overturned—
The characterless hexagram of formless yin.
Originally possessing form,
Yet reverting to formlessness,
The principle of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, is exhausted.
Thus, the *Lingqi* begins with the lines of the first hexagram
And ends with the formless body of the pieces.
Since it lacks written lines or images
To constitute a hexagram,
It does not fall within the one hundred twenty-four hexagrams.
This hexagram is not fit for action;
Thus, retreat to preserve hidden integrity,
To dispel great misfortune.
For chronic illness, the patient will not die;
For sudden illness, the omen is dire.

**He says:**
Unfavorable for seeking;
Fitting to stay home and guard one’s resolve.
All affairs are without worry;
Fitting for official matters.
If innocent, the case will be swiftly dismissed;
If guilty, the matter will be difficult to resolve.
Unfavorable for battle;
Unattainable in seeking.
This hexagram brings peace to the household,
A sign without gain or loss.

**Explanation says:**
Before the Great Ultimate divided,
There was profound obscurity.
Yin and yang blended,
Their forms indistinct.
Retreat in stillness, abide in silence,
To preserve integrity.
This hexagram’s fortune is undetermined;
No action should be taken.
Abide in quietude and self-restraint,
Then good fortune will come without misfortune.
For the querent who obtains this,
Hearing sorrow, do not grieve;
Hearing joy, do not rejoice—
Guard steadfastness, a hexagram without gain or loss.

The *Lingqi Jing*

In the third month of the year *xinchou*, the Khitans launched a massive invasion, encircling the city of Yan. The open fields were filled without a single empty space, covered entirely in white earth. The gentry and common folk were struck with terror, while officials and subordinates were seized with confusion. The young and the weak, women and children, could not be secured even from morning to night. With no one to appeal to, I burned incense and consulted the *Lingqi Jing*. The divination yielded a hexagram of three *yang* above, two *yin* in the middle, and two *yin* below, with the following judgment: "The land is at peace, without hardship or difficulty. Most suitable for sowing and cultivation; advantageous for travel and return."

The next day, the Prefect of the Bureau of Merit, the Lord of Boling, summoned me to drink and discuss the matter. Boling said, "Yesterday, I too received this same omen." At that time, the Khitan siege grew increasingly pressing. A monk from my clan, who had just taken charge of the household, came to offer comfort. We again devoutly prayed and cast the lots, and the previous hexagram reappeared.

By the fifth month, no relief forces had arrived. I and my peers—Magistrate Zhou of Changping, Magistrate Wu of Huailai, and Chief Captain Zhao Zonggu—lodged at the garrison post. Anxious that the reinforcements were delayed, we spoke of the *Lingqi Jing*. At the group’s request, we devoutly prayed and cast the lots, obtaining a hexagram of two *yang* above and one *yin* in the middle. Seeing the hexagram’s form incomplete, the entire company was stunned and sighed in dismay. The judgment read: "Entrusting matters to others, one awaits their intent day by day. Only now is joyful news obtained. Affairs will require delay, but the aspiration will ultimately be preserved." Yan said: "Due to its solitary and humble position, it cannot stand alone. If auspicious, it will remain so in the end, though the outcome will be slow."

By the sixth month, the peril and distress had grown even more severe. I again requested to cast the lots, but the group said, "Enough, enough. Even if a favorable hexagram appears, we dare not trust it. If it turns out ill, our sorrow will only deepen." I silently said to myself: "Just cast them. If the result is good, we will rejoice; if ill, I will devise my own plan to escape." Thus, I cast the lots and once more obtained the hexagram of "the land is at peace, without hardship or difficulty."

On the ninth day of the seventh month, my disciple, the physician Guo Tong, came to visit and offer comfort. I was not at home, so he spoke with my sons about the *Lingqi Jing*. They earnestly prayed again and cast the lots, obtaining once more the hexagram of "the land is at peace." I then made a vow: if I were delivered from this calamity, I would hand-copy ten volumes of the text to transmit to those of like mind.

On the twenty-fourth day of the eighth month of that year, the great army lifted its siege. Thus did I know that utmost sincerity moves the divine, and utmost sincerity moves the numinous. With reverence, I record this affair and append it to the end of my ten-volume transcription.

—Preface by Han Yun, the Purple-Gathered Mountain Recluse of the Dang Clan

The name of this scripture appears in the *Tangshu Jingji Zhi*, and the *Nanshi* further records that Hong Mi of the Southern Qi also used it to divine fortune and misfortune. The text it preserves matches this one. In our present dynasty, Yang Wengong’s *Tanyuan* likewise records this scripture, attesting to its divinations as spirit-like in accuracy. My late father once hand-copied it as a treasured family text.

When I was still in the womb, my father had just suffered the loss of his teacher, and enemy scouts had already infiltrated our lands. He was ordered to depart with haste. Casting the lots, he obtained the hexagram "secure as Mount Tai," and indeed, no harm came to him afterward. In every divination, the hexagrams proved unfailingly accurate—how numinous this scripture is!

Upon close study of its prognostic verses, one must conclude they were composed by a Han-dynasty hand, not by any diviner of the Three Kingdoms or later. In essence, each divination invariably strikes the mark of affairs, unlike other arts that vaguely foretell fortune or misfortune. Its verses lean more toward the ominous than the auspicious, akin to the *Yijing*’s principle that "fortune and misfortune, regret and humiliation arise from movement." In any single inquiry, only one outcome is favorable, while three are fraught with misfortune, regret, or humiliation—is this not the natural principle of waxing and waning, fullness and emptiness?

Among the divination texts of our age, the *Yijing* and *Liuren* are the most reliable for discerning the constant Dao, yet their meanings run deep and obscure, difficult to grasp. At worst, their interpretations branch into myriad possibilities, and their calculations diverge. How could they compare to this scripture, so clear and penetrating, revealing its judgments with simplicity and directness?
