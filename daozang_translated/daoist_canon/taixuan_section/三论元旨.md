**Preface to *The Essential Meaning of the Three Treatises***

The enlightenment attained through a single realization illuminates even the most obscure depths, while the delusion clung to in a single moment renders all paths foolish. Thus, superfluous growths are maladies of the form, just as deluded thoughts and afflictions are maladies of the mind. When the malady of form is cured, the body finds peace; when the malady of mind is dissolved, the true nature shines forth. To cure the malady of form, one must rely on a skilled physician; to dissolve the malady of mind, one must depend on sublime teachings. The principle of spontaneity is wrought as if by furnace and hammer. Life is finite, and one must wield the skill of a master butcher. Following a luminous teacher, one receives the model; adhering to the model, one moves with the pivot. Relying on the supreme canon as a guide, one forgets the guide and beholds the mystery.

The dust of the marketplace is dark and murky, causing one to lose the root and stray from the true. When the inner sanctuary is pure and empty, the spirit is whole and the *qi* is wondrous. A whole spirit is the root of long life; wondrous *qi* is the source of immortality. All things, in their great communion, attain realization through cultivation.

For long have I dwelt among mountains and waters, secluded in quiet retreat, my unwavering heart attuned to the nature of non-action. Serene amid the forests and wilds, my profound intent ever full, I offer these three treatises as a glimpse of one corner. Though the language may seem coarse, the principle is trustworthy. May scholars harbor no doubt, and may their practice yield verification. The great affliction of life and death—who is not grieved by it? I universally exhort those to come to together behold its mystery.

**The Essential Meaning of the Three Treatises**

**Chapter One: The Origin of the Dao**

The origin of the Dao is subtle and profound, the ultimate principle, spiritually responsive and all-pervading, unified in essence yet manifesting in myriad forms. Terms such as non-action, supreme, infinite, boundless, Dao-nature, true nature, inherent nature, mysterious nature, emptiness, spontaneity, emptiness and penetration, liberation, utmost refinement, utmost subtlety, utmost sageliness, utmost truth, purity, clarity, neither birth nor extinction—these many designations, though varied, are without error in principle. All are names for the numinous origin of the perfected ones of the Great Dao. Realization leads to sagehood; delusion binds one to the mundane. Though delusion and realization diverge, how do they differ from the utmost truth?

The profound and quiescent is not distant; perceiving delusion, one grasps the real. The common people are mired in the delusion of form and color, while the sages expound non-action to dispel their obstructions. They point to the realm of emptiness and nothingness, unfolding the source of the subtle and wondrous. When one comprehends that emptiness and form present no obstacle of attachment, the ever-true nature is revealed.

Thus, the *Sutra of the Fundamental Limit* states: "Because of attachment to nature, one employs expedient means to expound the provisionality of all dharmas. Because of attachment to the provisional, one employs expedient means to expound the emptiness of all dharmas." Penetrating the true nature, the true nature flows unimpeded—how could emptiness or the provisional hinder it?

Yet without realization, one must still the dust of the world. The utmost refinement cannot be observed through thoughts of form; the utmost profundity cannot be fathomed by superficial emotions. Without clarifying emptiness and purifying thoughts, one cannot preserve the true. Even with vast learning and many approaches, without the illumination of emptiness and quiescence, realization remains unattainable. To perceive form and not return to the spirit—this is the height of delusion. Not comprehending the spirit, how can one truly record it?

**Record of Cuiwei Abbey**

The Daoist Yan Yujing of Cuiwei Abbey in Fuzhou requested that I compose a record of its construction and renovation, following the text of *Record of Cuiwei Abbey* by Lord Wen’an. I had not yet found time to take up my brush, but this spring, while visiting the shrine of the Perfected Lord Wang of Nanfeng, I passed by Cuiwei. Its fertile fields and rich soil, its winding streams and encircling mountains, all layered in verdant hues, stretched sinuously for over ten *li*. The ridges and foothills rose and fell without end—truly a fine place where the vital *qi* of the land converges.

According to Lord Wen’an’s record, the mountain of the perfected ones lies at the junction of Yu and Ru, in the southern prefecture of Jinxī. In the first year of the Tianbao era of the Tang (742), a Daoist built a hut at its foot, naming it Valley Grove. In the first year of the Xuanhe era of the Song (1119), it was granted the plaque Cuiwei Abbey. In the second year of the Taiding era of the Yuan (1325), the abbot Zhou Yingti renovated it entirely, and thus the account was written.

Over time, the abbey fell into disrepair, becoming a wasteland of brambles by the end of the Yuan. At the beginning of our dynasty, He of the Later Chariot of Jinxī, a prominent family in the region, invited Luo Zemin, a Daoist from Yanxi Abbey in Nancheng of Yu, to serve as abbot of Yanshou Abbey. His disciples included Xiong Yiqian and Yan Yujing. In the sixth year of the Hongwu era (1373), Yujing petitioned for ordination as a Daoist. In the seventh year (1374), the Ministry of Rites appointed him as a musician in the Court of Imperial Sacrifices. Shortly after, he returned home due to his mother’s mourning. In the eighth year (1375), he resumed his post as a musician. In the twelfth year (1379), he was granted leave to return. Yiqian, meanwhile, resided at the princely residence in Qingzhou. In the seventeenth year (1384), the Daoist registry summoned him to oversee affairs at Cuiwei Abbey.

In the twenty-second year (1389), Zemin passed away, and Yujing gave him a generous burial. He then led his disciples Huang Yongsu and Li Yongguang in managing both Yanshou and Cuiwei Abbeys. Many halls, corridors, and structures were repaired. In the autumn of the thirtieth year (1397), he built a pavilion atop the mountain, where pines and bamboos grew lush and verdant, naming it Green Waves. He also obtained Lord Wen’an’s record from Li Yincheng of the village, which aligned with his aspirations for expansion and renovation, prompting him to make this renewed request.

I have heard that the numinous traces of ancient immortals and perfected ones are often found in the grandeur of mountains and rivers—what is called "the land ennobled by the person" is indeed true. Among the mountains and waters of our prefecture, none surpass those of Yu and Fu, and Cuiwei, which originated in the Tang and flourished in the Song and Yuan, is surely a case of "a noble land producing outstanding people."

To have one’s name endure in the present age, and to be counted among renowned scholars like Lord Wen’an, is truly splendid. Yujing, with his keen and perceptive nature, excels in playing the *qin* and painting. His renovations and innovations must surpass even those of today. In entrusting him with the affairs of the abbey, the right person has indeed been chosen.

I take no small delight in seeing this endeavor come to fruition and recording it. As for the layout of its mountains, rivers, and temple structures, these have already been detailed in previous records, and I shall not repeat them here.

**Record of the Charitable Ferry**
Nanfeng, once a prefecture, is now the superior county of Yu. Its mountains and waters are lofty and elegant, its people numerous and prosperous, and merchant sails and trading vessels constantly ply its markets. Its roads connect upward to Nanchang, Yuan, and Gan, and downward to Yu, Fu, Min, and Guang. The charitable ferry lies precisely at this vital crossing, where boats cannot but be established.

The stream lies five *li* from the county seat. Above it rise layered ridges and overlapping peaks, like an encircling belt facing north toward the elegance of Junfeng—this is called Tortoise Mound. During the Chongning era of the Song, the Perfected Lord of the Divine Palace, renowned for his Dao and conduct, was favored by Emperor Huizong. In his later years, he shed his mortal form there, and the auspicious sign of the tortoise further enhanced its fame.

Among the worthy and good of the county was one Zou Tiebie, who once received the Dao from the Shangguan family. Shangguan was a nephew of the Perfected Lord of the Divine Palace. Later, Zou again encountered the Perfected Lord, who personally transmitted to him its profound mysteries, and his Dao thus flourished. At that time, Wang Zhi, then magistrate of Nanfeng Prefecture, had once studied under Tiebie. During the transmission of the teachings, thunder suddenly shook the altar. Zou said, “I am about to transcend.” Wang, startled and overjoyed, offered all his wealth in devotion. Zou declined, saying, “I am but a cloud-and-water wanderer—what use have I for this?” Wang then requested to expand the Wondrous Numinous Abbey to enshrine and serve the Perfected Lord. The old abbey lay in another village, so it was relocated and rebuilt. From then on, whenever drought, flood, illness, or affliction struck, the residents’ prayers were invariably answered, and supplicants came daily. Yet the ferry still suffered from the hardship of crossing, which was neither convenient nor proper for those seeking profit. Thus, a boat was established at the ferry, and a pavilion built above it, providing a place for rest.

During the military upheavals of the late Yuan, the pavilion fell into ruin, and the boat was destroyed. In the spring of the *gengwu* year of the Hongwu era, I once paid homage at the Perfected Lord’s shrine. At that time, the Wondrous Numinous Abbey lay overgrown and untended, so I ordered Zhang Hui, the Dharma heir of Yu, to raise funds and renovate it. Once the work was completed, in the *yihai* year, the Pavilion for Awaiting the Immortals was also rebuilt, and a boat was provided as a charitable ferry. Moreover, several *mu* of paddy fields were donated to support the ferryman and cover the cost of replacing the boat. This was a plan of profound foresight, and the compassionate concern for those burdened by crossing was fully preserved.

Several times I was asked to compose a record of this. Now, *yi* (charity) is the fitting response to affairs. The image of a boat disperses and bridges what is impassable—this is the sage’s way of drawing analogies from things. Even the most ordinary streams and islets, though they do not comprehend their own nature, exemplify the forgetting of both inner and outer—this is the forgetting of the One.

The forgetting of the One is the heart. It is the heart that illuminates, utterly extinguishing all vexations, like a clear spring cleansing a filthy vessel. Once the vessel is ordered, it may be put to good use; once the heart is stilled, the universal is released, and only then can the true be attained. Thus the scripture says: “Ever without desire, observe its mystery.”

Yet once the mystery is truly mysterious, and forgetting is truly real, then inner and outer are wholly forgotten, and one transcends to attain both. Through this awakening to the mystery, one knows without knowing and attains the true One through the forgetting of the One. This is not merely about the One—it applies universally. Know that the One is the origin of the myriad things, and the myriad things are the instruments of the One. The not-One that is not the One is attained through the true One. The source of the true One is fundamentally without admixture, neither now nor ancient, neither perishing nor arising. Thus the *Scripture of the Most High* says: “Serene and solitary, it stands unchanging; circulating without beginning.” This is what it means.

To profoundly grasp this source is to be without error. The heart equals the Dao, and the Dao equals the heart—Dao is heart, and heart is Dao. Heart and Dao share a single nature, neither being nor non-being, and thus they are mysterious. Abiding in being, one is not attached to being yet does not depart from non-being; abiding in non-being, one is not attached to non-being yet does not depart from being. Everywhere present, nowhere obstructed, spirit and understanding merge, and the nature of true constancy is realized. This is what is meant by “penetrating the heart and attaining the ultimate view, reaching the limitless.”

All sentient beings sink in the sea of suffering, and this arises from the heart. To extinguish delusion and return to the true is the wondrous source of spontaneity.

The One is born of *yinyun* (primordial vapor). *Yinyun* arises from the two halves. To gather the heart and abide in the One is called *anding* (peaceful stability). To reduce the heart to ashes and forget the One is called *mieding* (extinguished stability). To awaken the heart to the true One is called *taiding* (supreme stability). To ascend bodily and transform into a feathered being is called an immortal. To equal the true spirit in form is called a perfected one. To embody the same nature is called a sage. A heart-mirror bright and wise is called one who awakens to immortality. A heart that penetrates the true spirit is called one who awakens to the true. A heart that unites with the true nature is called one who awakens to sageliness. These three stabilities and four grades of heart enable one to ascend to the Dao.

The four grades of heart are coarse, fine, subtle, and wondrous. Thus, those who cultivate and refine themselves push the coarse to its limit to reach the fine, the fine to its limit to reach the subtle, the subtle to its limit to reach the wondrous, and the wondrous to its limit to attain the Dao.

Now, ignorance and frenzy are called coarse. Clarity, softness, and purity are called fine. Spirit merged with emptiness and stillness is called subtle. Profound attainment of the true source is called wondrous. To still the heart and inwardly illuminate, observing all thoughts as empty, so that coarse delusions universally dissolve, is called attaining the coarse. To utterly extinguish fine delusions is called attaining the fine. To comprehend the subtlety of spirit is called attaining the subtle. To awaken to the Dao and penetrate the wondrous is called attaining the wondrous.

Moreover, the congealing of *qi* and the colored body is called coarse. The wandering of *qi* and the flow of breath are called fine. The mirroring and functioning of spirit and wisdom are called subtle. The constancy of true nature is called wondrous. Through cultivation, nourishment, and refinement, premature decay and universal harm are eliminated—this is called attaining the coarse. The harmonious flow of *qi* is called attaining the fine. The equality of form and spirit is called attaining the subtle. The dissolution of form and nature is called attaining the wondrous.

Know that the colored body is coarse, the wandering *qi* is fine, spirit and wisdom are subtle, and true nature is constantly wondrous.

What, then, is the wondrous? It is spoken in contrast to the coarse. Beings are mired in the coarse, and thus are urged to cultivate the wondrous in relation to the Dao.

What is wondrous about it? In terms of the Dao, there is no wondrous and no non-wondrous; in relation to things, there is the wondrous and the non-wondrous. In terms of the Dao, there is no cultivation and no non-cultivation; in relation to things, there is cultivation and non-cultivation.

Through spirit, one penetrates nature, becoming spirit without being spirit. Through the coarse, one discards the wondrous, becoming wondrous without being wondrous. Yet those who extinguish the heart and obliterate wisdom to sit in emptiness and delusion practice the Dharma of quiescent extinction. Those who fuse spirit and nurture *qi* to sit in dual forgetting practice the Dharma of longevity.

Extinction following birth is called quiescent extinction. Birth following extinction is called true birth. To penetrate birth after extinction is to dissolve into true emptiness and wondrous existence.

Yet the deluded perceive the Three Realms as the Three Pure Ones—this is easily known in practice but difficult to comprehend in principle. Those who are not disturbed by the desires of emptiness and existence, and who constantly abide in the serene clarity of the heart, possess the profound mind of the perfected person.

Yet the restless, violent, and unruly impulses that cannot be swiftly restrained resemble the madness and folly of beings. To quell chaos with stillness, to preserve stillness with constancy, to be lucid in movement and illuminating in stillness—those who thus refine wisdom and nature to dispel delusion, and who embody true wisdom and true nature with clarity, are the profoundly awakened.

To rest in harmony, to diminish desires, to preserve simplicity, not to listen with the ears but with the heart, not to listen with the heart but with *qi*, not to listen with *qi* but to entrust it to nature—those who are complete in affairs yet able to forget, and who forget in principle yet remain complete, are the comprehensively enlightened.

Those who seek knowledge through texts, sight, and hearing are relying on the artificial. Those who clarify emptiness and inwardly illuminate to unite with nature are genuine. To abandon the artificial and penetrate the real is to make the artificial real as well.

**Chapter Thirty-Five: The True Source**
The Dao nurtures beings through emptiness and pervades all directions; the true source responds spiritually with subtlety, and *qi* moves to form vessels according to their nature. All corporeal kinds rely on *qi* to live, while all sentient awareness is endowed by spirit.

Spirit is the function of nature; awareness is the function of spirit. Primordial *qi* is the function of nature; yin-yang and *qi* are the functions of primordial *qi*; form and yin-yang are the functions of *qi*. Thus, the *Scripture of the Supreme* states: "The Dao is empty yet inexhaustible in use." The *Scripture of Southern Florescence* states: "Spirit and essence are born of the Dao." This is what is meant.

To be vast and embrace all is called nature; to be singular and pervade the individual is called spirit. The body is the vessel of spirit and awareness; the heart is the capital of spirit and awareness. Thus, the *Scripture of Western Ascent* states: "The body is the abode of spirit." Awareness also arises from spirit.

Spirit in relation to awareness is like the sun in relation to light. Light arises from the sun but is not the sun’s body; awareness arises from spirit but is not the true spirit. Spirit within the body can perceive externally, while nature is universally serene, its movement never deviating from stillness.

Viewing nature from spirit, nature is wondrous while spirit is coarse. Viewing the body from spirit, the body is coarse while spirit is wondrous. Though nature, spirit, and awareness share the same origin, their functions differ. Awakening unites spirit with nature; delusion mires awareness and severs spirit.

Those mired in awareness and severed from spirit drift through life and death with the movement of *qi*. Those who unite spirit with nature are wondrously and perpetually free. Thus, sentient beings are said to form shapes through the resonance of spirit and *qi*, possessing both form and awareness. Insentient kinds are endowed with *qi* alone, lacking spirit, and thus have form but no awareness.

Know that spirit can become the awareness of beings but cannot become their form. *Qi* can become the form of beings but cannot become their awareness. Thus, nature and spirit are numinous, while *qi* and form are insentient.

Beings endowed with yin-yang and the Five Phases undergo growth and decline, but the true source of correct nature is never exhausted or depleted. Corporeal beings die when *qi* scatters and live when *qi* gathers, yet *qi* has distinctions of gathering and scattering, while spirit has no difference between life and extinction.

Know that spirit can move *qi*, and *qi* can also sustain spirit. When gathered, they form together; when scattered, each moves independently. Impure flavors and foul odors sustain the turbid *qi* of yin-yang; wondrous medicines and pure harmony sustain the correct *qi* of primordial harmony.

When correct *qi* is complete and sustains spirit, there is non-action and non-desire. When the turbid *qi* of yin-yang sustains spirit, there is much desire and much action. Much desire and much action are the source of premature decay and drowning in suffering. Non-action and non-desire are the essence of serene and constant existence.

The origin of beings arises from the middle way. Mired in awareness, they transmigrate according to karma, revolving without leaving the Dao—yet why do they not awaken to the Dao? Sentient beings with form and appearance have distinctions and divisions. Pursuing objects, they generate delusion; accumulating delusion, they form karma. Unable to escape retribution, they fail to reflect inwardly.

Those who awaken to the profound and serene emptiness, though deluded yet not deluded, though bound to objects yet not bound, are not captured by delusion or objects—how then could there be karmic retribution? The confusion of the three karmas and six senses arises from turbid *qi* and clouded emotions; in tranquil contemplation and perfect emptiness, spirit is clear and *qi* is refreshing.

Thus, the *Scripture of the Original Boundary* states: "Sound, whether clear or turbid, follows its original tone." It also states: "All is felt according to the karma of beings." The *Scripture of Western Ascent* states: "The *qi* of accumulated goodness arrives; the *qi* of accumulated evil arrives."

Yet evil *qi* is turbid and strong, increasing darkness and generating delusion. Good *qi* is pure and complete, penetrating emptiness and illuminating clarity. To be illuminated and clear is like parting the mist to glimpse the azure sky.

Those shrouded in darkness and obscurity are like those drowning in a muddied river. Thus, when darkness and light are both transcended, when good and evil are both obscured, and when the utmost true source and the flowing wondrous origin are reached, this is the mystery of spontaneity.

Spontaneity is the nature of non-action, requiring no external cause—hence it is called "spontaneous." Those who cultivate practice attain non-action through action, and reach non-birth through birth. When one fully comprehends the self and accords with spontaneity, the nature of non-birth is realized. This nature is not without birth, yet it can give rise to all things. Though it gives rise to all things, the wondrous origin has never truly been born. Thus, the non-action of non-action and the form of no-form are the wondrous essence of the Dao. The action of action and the form of form are the vast functions of the Dao. The wondrous origin, in its relation to the originless—

The mind is the master of all delusions and also the gateway to all wonders. The depths of the nature, spirit, and consciousness are all illuminated and penetrated through the mind. Yet the foolish masses, called "deluded consciousness," know nothing of ritual and law, and are thus called "shallow consciousness." Those with discerning thoughts and keen insight are called "wise consciousness"; those serene, gentle, and unadorned are called "pure consciousness"; those with a settled mind and empty tranquility are called "still consciousness"; those who extinguish the mind and abolish wisdom are called "forgotten consciousness"; those with clear inner reflection are called "discerning consciousness"; those who comprehend the divine and true are called "subtle consciousness"; those who penetrate the ocean of nature are called "wondrous consciousness."

Alas, many in this age are mired in coarse consciousness, while those who grasp the divine and subtle are rare. Those who grasp the divine transcend consciousness, though they remain connected to it. Those mired in consciousness are not without spirit, yet they remain separated from it. Those who grasp the divine and subtle see both essence and function clearly in spirit and consciousness. Those mired in coarse consciousness cling to partial views of consciousness and fail to unite with spirit.

To unite with spirit and penetrate nature, one must first cultivate mindfulness meditation, then proceed to the meditation of forgetting the mind. When the mind is extinguished and wisdom abolished, all realms become still. Externally, no sounds are heard; internally, no forms are seen. In the midst of formlessness, a sudden subtle awakening arises—spirit becomes empty and fused, and this is the principle of spirit. When spirit is fused and emptiness dissolved, merging into boundlessness, one abides in vast openness, and the wondrous nature of the Dao, the true origin, is realized.

Thus, using consciousness to illuminate consciousness, one exhausts consciousness to penetrate spirit. Using spirit to illuminate spirit, one exhausts spirit to penetrate nature. Penetrating nature, nature sees itself; penetrating spirit, spirit sees itself. When spirit sees itself and nature sees itself, this is true seeing. Using consciousness to see spirit or spirit to see nature is deluded seeing.

Those who attain a settled mind do not fall into evil destinies—how much more so for those whose spirit unites with nature? The subtle spirit and wondrous nature, though inherently numinous, are fundamentally tranquil and free from delusion. Beings mired in consciousness without penetration are called "deluded minds." Those who comprehend the source of spirit do not abandon delusion for truth.

The essence of nature abides in emptiness, identical to emptiness yet not emptiness; it abides in form, identical to form yet not form. It can encompass both emptiness and form, ever still and ever penetrating—what is vast contains all, what is minute enters all. First, it does not enter the Three Realms; second, it enters the Formless Realm; third, it enters the Form Realm; fourth, it enters the Desire Realm; fifth, it enters the Evil Destinies.

Wondrous medicines can nurture harmony; sitting in forgetfulness can illuminate nature. Nurturing harmony prevents the body from dying; penetrating nature prevents delusion from arising. When neither death nor birth exists, form transforms and communicates with spirit—this is the way of feathered transcendence and true immortality. Thus, the *Shangqing*, *Taiqing*, and *Zhen’gao* scriptures all speak of the wondrous elixir of golden cinnabar and refining *qi* to communicate with spirit, enabling one to ascend lightly, become an immortal, and unite with the sagely.

Thus, eliminating deluded thoughts is the essential key to awakening the Dao, and the harmony of spirit and *qi* is the pivot of immortality. Those who claim to cultivate the Dao without eliminating delusion are like the blind grasping for clarity. Refining thoughts to stillness and penetrating the true spirit is like drilling wood to spark a flame.

Those who concentrate the mind in sitting forgetfulness to penetrate spirit and awaken nature practice the method of cultivating spirit. Those who guide the body through movements and exhale and inhale primordial harmony practice the method of cultivating the body. Cultivating spirit without cultivating the body is the method of liberation. Cultivating the body without cultivating spirit is the method of prolonging life. Cultivating both spirit and body together is the method of learning immortality.

In cultivating spirit, refining the mind comes first; in absorbing *qi*, guiding and pulling movements take precedence. When guiding and pulling movements harmonize with the Great Harmony, and refining the mind penetrates all wonders, spirit fuses with empty clarity, and *qi* flows freely in purity. Transforming spirit and *qi* to circulate freely—what truth is not then complete?

Thus, superior practitioners of the Dao universally release worldly toils, comprehend the true source, perfect wisdom, and embrace the wondrous. Nurturing harmony, they preserve life, like fire passed from one torch to another. With long vision and eternal life, they ascend on rainbows to the immortal realm, progressing from immortality to truth, from truth to sageliness—sageliness is the wondrous flow of communication. This is not abandoning the body of action but attaining the nature of non-action.

Middle practitioners of the truth comprehend the source of the mind, yet their bodily forms remain ordinary. They abandon the leaking body to enter the sagely realm—this is abandoning the form of action to attain the nature of non-action.

Superior practitioners attain both form and spirit, eternally wondrous in the true source. Middle practitioners attain spirit but sink the body, thus requiring liberation. Inferior practitioners fail to attain either spirit or form and follow karmic transmigration.

The Dao is eternally one in its spontaneous form, while things differ in myriad ways. The Dao can generate things, yet things are not the true Dao. Observing through the Dao, the myriad things and dharmas all communicate through the one Dao. Observing through things, the myriad things and dharmas each cling to their own path. Though things differ, the Dao does not differ; though dharmas vary, the Dao does not vary. Though action ceases, the Dao does not cease; though emptiness and form are severed, the Dao is not severed.

The true reality abides in serene spontaneity, pervading all with effortless freedom—this is the Dao of great penetration. The Dao is the root-source of the myriad dharmas. To wondrously attain the true and constant is to return to the origin and revert to the primordial.

The Dao’s relation to sentient beings is like that of an emperor to the common people: those who ascend the imperial throne command the allegiance of all dharmas. Those who attain the wondrous Dao likewise perceive all dharmas. Thus the *Sutra of the Fundamental Limit* states: possessing all wisdom and accomplishing the supreme Dao.

Form aggregates, consciousness aggregates, mind aggregates, and perception aggregates—when these four aggregates coalesce, good and evil arise. The Great Vehicle is level and equal, without excess or limit, while the gradual teachings of the Dharma-gate entail cultivation and realization. Thus, one relies on the boat to reach the shore, then abandons the boat upon arrival. One relies on study to achieve success, then discards study once success is attained. As the *Virtue Classic* says: "For learning, daily increase; for the Dao, daily decrease—decrease and further decrease until reaching non-action, where non-action accomplishes all." Those who pursue learning daily augment their views of action, while those who cultivate the Dao daily diminish their knowledge of action and views. By diminishing the existent, one penetrates the non-existent; by penetrating the non-existent, one possesses all.

Yet the true source abides in profound stillness, responding and adapting to conditions. Sentient beings differ in the sharpness or dullness of their roots, so the teachings of the sages likewise vary between gradual and sudden. Cultivation through action is called the gradual teaching; true realization of non-action is called the sudden teaching. The true nature pervades all, perfectly equipping every method—this is called the Dao’s response. Expounding sutras in Han lands and teaching in foreign regions—this is called a distinct response. All sentient beings share the same nature as the Dao—this is called universal resonance; receiving teachings according to their kind—this is called distinct resonance.

Thus the *Sutra of the Ocean of Emptiness* states: "The sage is non-active; sentient beings therefore respond with action." It further says: "Sentient beings resonate with the sage through different conditions; the sage’s response to sentient beings likewise varies in form." Therefore, the wondrous essence abiding in stillness is called the true body; manifesting in phenomenal forms is called the responsive body; receiving retribution according to causes is called the reward body.

Within the wondrous lies the vast, and within the vast lies the wondrous. When the sage responds to action, it is the wondrous within the vast; when sentient beings awaken to non-action, it is the wondrous within the vast. Yet all myriad dharmas originally emerge from the profound and obscure, where the principle of spontaneity resides, and the conditions of causes are the same.

Thus, the Dao is one in nature yet can respond to all spirits; spirit is one yet can respond to all things; things receive one spirit yet can respond to all consciousness. Responding to spirit produces the wisdom of harmonious life; responding to form manifests the shapes of the myriad kinds; responding with the body extends the sage’s compassionate transformation; responding with nature guides the deluded masses. Nature is the wondrous numen of emptiness and spontaneity. Responding to the sage is the wondrous function of nature; responding to spirit is the subtle function of nature; responding to form is the minute function of nature; phenomenal appearances are the vast function of nature.

The sage who responds is the sage of the responsive body. Phenomena are the forms of all conditioned things in heaven and earth. Thus, the response can generate the myriad things yet does not generate; can accomplish the myriad things yet does not accomplish; can possess the myriad things yet does not possess; can empty the myriad things yet does not empty. Not being a thing yet able to act as things, it is not confined by things; not being a dharma yet able to act as dharmas, it is not bound by dharmas. Responding without deviating from its root—this is the true and constant nature of the great Dao.

The six paths arise in throngs, yet the Dao does not arise; the three realms undergo kalpic transformations, yet the Dao does not change. To cultivate and unite with the Dao, nothing precedes spirit, while form follows after. The thirty-six thousand spirits of the body are the unified governance of a single life. Their functions differ yet all return to one—like the limbs of a body. Phenomena within phenomena reveal sameness within difference; spirits within spirits reveal difference within sameness. Though existence and non-existence stand opposed, principle and phenomenon interpenetrate.

Thus, within spontaneity there are causes, and within causes there is spontaneity. Spontaneity does not depart from causes, nor causes from spontaneity—yet they differ while being the same. All causes are ultimately the causes of spontaneity. From the root descending to the near, functions vary according to use; gathering the near to return to the root, all is encompassed without exclusion. The true essence embraces all images, its mysterious responses transforming the great chiliocosm—thus it can wondrously unify one spirit while distinguishing a hundred billion.

Without distinguishing treasures, one cannot know their value; without illuminating the Dao, one cannot embody its truth. Things receive the Dao and are born, thus things possess the Dao-nature. Those who do not awaken to the Dao are deluded by the customs of a degenerate age. The supreme teaching responds, and teaching can guide to principle. Those who do not know the teaching suffer the eight difficulties; slandering and reviling the sage incurs the three painful destinies.

Yet the Dao is omnipresent, and one need not despair over sentient beings—for awakening enables penetration, and how distant is the separation? Thus the *Sutra of the True Treasury* states: "All afflictions are but the adornments of true nature," turning delusion into truth. This is what is meant by: movement does not deviate from stillness, stillness does not deviate from movement; response abides in truth, truth abides in constant response. As the *Western Ascent Sutra* says: "The Dao is not mine alone—all things possess it." Thus, those who can practice can penetrate, and those who can penetrate are sages.

Preserving the true one, the correct one, and the threefold one—this is the Dao’s accomplishment. The great image of primordial chaos has manifold applications, yet the unenlightened find its principles difficult to rightly believe. Now I cite essential passages from various sutras to dispel the doubts of seekers. Thus the *Supreme Sutra* says: "The great image has no form." And the *Western Ascent Sutra* states: "Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than the Dao."

The reason the Dao is soft and weak is that it envelops Heaven and Earth and permeates the myriad things. The *True Treasury Sutra* states: "In all under Heaven, nothing is softer or weaker, yet it encompasses all without exclusion, subtle and minutely refined." The *Nanhua Sutra* says: "The most refined has no form; the greatest cannot be encompassed." This clarifies that the supreme Dao, being non-action, embraces all phenomena. The *Laozi Sutra* says: "The Dao gives them life; virtue nurtures them." The *Supreme Three Heavens Orthodox Sutra* states: "The Dao is vast, boundless, and profoundly obscure; from the Great Void’s transformations, darkness arises." The *Scripture of Great Peace* says: "The Dao envelops what lies beyond form; it generates spirit and essence." The *Nanhua Sutra* states: "The Dao possesses sentiment and sincerity, is without action and form; it spiritually empowers ghosts and gods, gives birth to Heaven and Earth." This clarifies that spirit and darkness, Heaven and Earth, and the myriad things all serve as instruments of the Dao.

The *Western Ascent Sutra* says: "When I recall the time before my birth, before I had a body, it was true essence accumulated as qi that formed my body." It further states: "Form without spirit cannot generate itself; spirit without form cannot complete itself. Only when form and spirit unite do they mutually engender and perfect." This clarifies that all beings with nature arise from the mutual resonance of spirit and darkness, which gives rise to the body. Spirit resides within ants, assuming the form of ants; spirit resides within elephants, horses, osprey, and roc, assuming their shapes. Spirit adapts in length to the substance, while substance depends on spirit to activate its function. Discerning good and evil is called *shí* (discernment); the hidden, numinous transformations are called *shén* (spirit). That which animates the body is none other than spirit. When the body exists, spirit abides; when spirit departs, the body dies.

The body receives one spirit, which generates thirty-six thousand spirits. At the moment of death, the thirty-six thousand spirits return to the one spirit, which then departs. One spirit dwells within and equals one body; within the one, it equals the multitude of spirits. Birds and beasts receive one in the same way, yet they do not possess the full complement of spirits as humans do. In quantity, this is so; likewise, in the purity or turbidity of qi. The resonances differ in myriad ways, hence the many variations.

The kinds of grasses and trees are generated solely by qi and do not receive spirit to complete their forms; thus, they lack discernment and function. Without discernment, they also lack karma. The *Original Boundary Sutra* states: "Reciting and contemplating this sutra opens the path to liberation, and the spirit ascends to the Southern Palace." The *Scripture of Salvation* says: "When the hun-soul and spirit momentarily vanish, one does not pass through hell but immediately regains form." It further states: "The suffering souls of innumerable ancestors and past generations are all thereby delivered." This clarifies that those who cultivate goodness guide their spirits toward the good Dao, benefiting not only themselves but also their kin.

The *Great Precepts Sutra* says: "When the heart-spirit is agitated, it gives rise to love and desire, causing people to wander in delusion." The *Original Boundary Sutra* states: "Those who inflict much harm, upon death, their spirits depart and cycle through the three evil destinies." This clarifies that those who do evil suffer retribution in their spirits. The *Ascending Mystery Sutra* says: "In profound communication and tranquil seclusion, the spirit becomes luminous and enters the subtle." The *Karmic Retribution Sutra* states: "With a tranquil mind and serene contemplation, one returns the spirit to the Dao." The *Nanhua Sutra* says: "Detach from form, abandon wisdom, and merge with the Great Communion." The *Original Boundary Sutra* states: "It cannot be made to be so, nor can it be made not to be so—hence it is called *ziran* (self-so). Awakening to this true nature is called awakening to the Dao."

This clarifies that those who transcend illusion, attune to spirit, and awaken to nature—like cicadas shedding their shells—temporarily rely on spirit to return to the truth of the great Dao. The Dao, in relation to one’s inherent nature, is but a different name. Fire’s nature responds to dryness in its function, while water’s nature responds to moisture—this illustrates the nature of the Five Phases, not the nature of the supreme Dao. Since the Five Phases are thus, the myriad phenomena may be known. Though largely the same, they still differ in minor ways. Therefore, insentient kinds all possess their inherent nature, while sentient beings all possess their karmic nature; the Dao’s emptiness and pervasiveness are called its wondrous nature.

The *Original Form Sutra* says: "Cherish the spirit and protect the qi, and you may attain longevity." The *Karmic Retribution Sutra* states: "Refine the darkness and transform the form; turn the spirit to return to the Dao." The *Western Ascent Sutra* says: "Become one with the Dao in body yet without form." This clarifies that when form and darkness are both refined, they transform into spirit; turning the spirit to return to the Dao, one unites with the Dao in spirit, thereby encompassing all phenomena. Spirit alone equals the one body. Spirit, empowered by the Dao, becomes numinous; things, empowered by spirit, gain discernment.

The Dao is profoundly still, of one appearance, its wondrous essence truly constant. Spirit and darkness differ in two ways yet both serve the Dao’s function. Darkness is boundless and without limit; spirit has transformation and transition. Spirit is numinous, while darkness is not; darkness is vast, while spirit is not. Darkness has purity and turbidity; spirit has activity and rest. Only the Dao remains eternally thus, serene and unchanging.

Therefore, extensive learning and broad knowledge enhance discernment; preserving truth and refining darkness enhance spirit. Enhancing spirit connects one to the source without dependence; enhancing discernment increases the function of deliberate action. Deliberate action has limits and bounds; non-action is without limit or end. Alas, the careless multitude does not comprehend this subtlety.

The *Ascending Mystery Sutra*’s "Three Disciplines of the Dharma Wheel" states: "These three disciplines of the Dharma Wheel are the constant disciplines of the scriptural teachings, the eternal disciplines of immeasurable kalpas, which no sage of the past has ever altered. The disciplines comprise the superior, middling, and inferior practitioners." The concluding chapter speaks of guiding the three vehicles, which are the three practitioners—no other designation exists. *Shì* (practitioner) means "endeavor." The supreme practitioner embraces the conduct of the One, vows to attain the Dao without fail, and completes the endeavor without cessation. *Shì* (endeavor) signifies the ability to complete; *chéng* (vehicle) signifies the path of conveyance.

To summarize briefly:
The superior practitioner broadly opens the gates of the Dharma, placing others before self, delivering even rulers and kings, sacrificing self to aid others, extending benevolence to birds and beasts, bestowing kindness upon all living beings, revering teachers and upholding the Dharma as if in the presence of the divine, maintaining long fasts and arduous contemplation, delving deeply into the profound mysteries, expelling the old and absorbing the new, with a heart like cold ashes and a body like withered wood, intent unwavering and qi gentle, both human and spirit exerting effort. Such conduct, though entailing one death and one rebirth, ensures an unretreatant resolve to achieve the rank of highest immortality.

The first is *conduct*, the second is *vow*, the third is *compassion*, and the fourth is *lamentation*. *Conduct* encompasses the one hundred eighty precepts and two hundred forty rules of deportment, all of which govern body, speech, and mind, and constitute the myriad good practices. The twelve supreme vows are *vows*. The forty-five contemplations are *compassion*. These all derive from the *Scripture of the Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure*.

*Expedient means of liberation* include: the Golden Register for liberating emperors and kings, the Yellow Register for liberating ancestors and descendants, and the Natural Liberation for all sentient beings—this is *lamentation*. *Conduct* takes the cessation of evil as its meaning; *vows* take profound aspiration as their covenant; *compassion* takes virtue as the shade for all things; and *lamentation* takes the relief of suffering as its embrace. Once the Way of the four disciplines is established, there is the severance of a single retribution.

The middling practitioner, aspiring to the Mystery, liberates all beings, rescues from distress and dispels calamity, bestows merit and repays virtue, establishes fields of profound blessedness, serves ruler and parents with loyalty and filial piety, embraces gentleness and wisdom, cherishes benevolence, empties the heart to attain the supreme Dao, savors the numinous scriptures, eats without thought of satiation, and wears clothing without concern for cold. With all practices perfected, three deaths and three rebirths follow, replenishing the Perfected of the Nine Palaces and cultivating the supreme Dao of Jade Clarity. In conduct, they are meticulous: observing the three hundred great precepts, reciting the thirty-nine chapters of the *Great Cavern*, and contemplating the method of the Three Ones. Upholding precepts to sever evil, the five destinies are without opposition; reciting scriptures to still the spirit, the heart is not driven outward; preserving the One to empty the mind, spirit and heart become serene. When serenity is settled, the mirror beholds the supreme Dao, ascending into non-action, and worldly retribution is severed.

The lesser practitioner severs emotions and endures hardship, nurtures the spirit through diet and regimen, renounces glory and splendor, dwells in mountains and forests, delights in hills and streams, abides in serenity and steadfastness, abstains from grains and roots, and maintains long fasts while contemplating the Dao. Seated upright, they face their teacher as if present; in coming and going, they keep company with birds and beasts. Solitary in lofty crags, they lodge alone in empty mountains, carve cypress to adorn themselves, their faces bearing the look of hunger, their hearts as if holding cinnabar. Tested, they are unafraid; spirit stilled, heart at peace. Such conduct moves the August Sovereign of Emptiness: nine deaths and nine rebirths follow, their resolve and vows unretreatant. They attain transformation, riding clouds in flight, roaming and feasting on the Five Peaks, carefree in the Great Void. Proceeding thus, they ascend to the rank of lofty immortals, cultivating the Dao of Jade Clarity alongside the middling practitioner.

The scripture states: The six penetrations and contemplative methods—five colors, five sounds, five tastes, five fragrances, five treasures, floral splendor, and all adornments—disturb the nature. The scripture states: In the east, *penetrating vision*; in the west, *penetrating emptiness*; in the south, *penetrating clarity*; in the north, *penetrating subtlety*; in the center, *penetrating void*. With the six penetrations and wisdom, the contemplation of the Dao is accomplished, casting off immeasurable dust and burdens. When dust and burdens are exhausted, this is called the six penetrations.

The *Scripture of the Immortals* states: The eye of wisdom, the ear of wisdom, the nose of wisdom, the tongue of wisdom, the body of wisdom, and the heart of wisdom—entering the Dao of the Rare and Silent, transcending the dharmas of the Three Realms, all is empty. This is called the six penetrations.

The *Scripture of the Three Realms* states: Upholding precepts is the root of fasting and purification; stillness is the foundation of concentrated contemplation; concentrated contemplation is the cause of descending perfection; descending perfection is the treasure of ascending the Dao.

The scripture states: The darkness of the Three Treasures resides in the heart; the adept of the Three Treasures resides at the edge. The "edge" is the register, the threshold. Abiding in the heart, contemplating and acting, transforming the perverse to follow the upright, accumulating goodness and establishing merit—virtue is fulfilled, reaching the ultimate, the ultimate of the Ultimateless. Drawing in the many streams, guiding those with aspiration.

The scripture states: When spirit and essence dwell within the inner chamber, the primordial darkness abides forever—this is the Dao of long life and enduring vision. *Darkness* takes emptiness and void as its essence, form and color as its function; *essence* takes profound obscurity as its essence, light and sound as its function; *spirit* takes subtlety and wonder as its essence, transformation as its function.

The scripture states: "Invisible to sight, it is *even*; inaudible to hearing, it is *rare*; untouchable to grasp, it is *subtle*." This is the Dao of spirit, darkness, and essence as the Three Ones, merging three into one, dispersing one into two. The "one" is non-being; the "not-one" of the one is called the True One. Here ends the essential purport of the Three Discourses.
