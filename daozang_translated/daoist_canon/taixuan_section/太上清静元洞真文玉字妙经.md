**The Supreme Clarity Primordial Cavern True Writ of Jade Characters Sublime Scripture**

The August Heaven Supreme Lord Emperor, the Limitless Supreme Primordial Lord—this is the Lord of the Dao, the King Father of the East, the qi of Azure Yang, the forebear of the myriad spirits. The Non-Action Western Queen Mother is the qi of Grand Yin, born of spontaneity. The August Heaven Supreme Emperor, the Supreme Unity Primordial Lord, is the star at the center of heaven.

This Lord resolves the concealed writs, the concealed kings: Han Chang, Li Jian, Piao Rongzi, Chi Chengzi, Shouzi, Guo Liangqiangzi, Xuanzǐ, Wang Shenzu, Taizengzi, Yī, the great sea drowning in waters, seeking Ying, following Kong Tong, Lu Huangzi, Huangming Guangzi, Yinyou Qiongying, Gongzi, Zhutian Shi Yiying, Dancheng Chengyi, Qixuanguang, Jianjin Zang, Li Changzi, Xuanguang, Zhongchengzi, Taihe Diande, Li Yuling, Jiao Siye, Gan You, Da Fangboyang, Yuhua, Chen Yuzǐ, Guangdacheng, Chijing Chengzi, Liuqu Wuyou, Yinzi, Qiaozhenzi, Xishe Youyi, Kencheng, Zhongbo Jing’er, Wencheng, Wuyi Wuwei, Guli, Dongshan Jingzhen, Jiaoyuanqi, Biro Xiang, Youwen Tong, Ju Li Zang, Bo Chao Shi, Kuo Daxiang, Xiamen Yu, Huangshen Guo, Xiamen Shen, Jing Tongmen, Zhi Da Xu, Ming Shi Zhang, Yuanchen Liuying, Lingmiao Qianying—all empty, soaring jade-feathered writs, the hundred stars of Mount Huang, the sun-serpent Ru, Yuehua’s mandate, running through Yu’s transformations, the craftsman’s remnants, the mountain’s restraints, the chariot at the utmost pole, the purple ox of Chou Market, the succession of Yuan Fu’s mandate.

One ascends and descends for nine days; the sun’s primordial unity extends nine tones. Yi Yanma’s mandate, surging upward, excites the rain; the heavens above are tranquil, the passage serene. Zhi Zhen Gongming, the youthful Marquis Lin, Guanghua Dezuo, Xu Shangwang Tingyin, Qiu Ling, Shangying Zhenxu, Han Han Zhengtong, Mingling Taishen, the vast and expansive spirit-immortals descend. Lingzhuzi, the White Horse, Xuantong Xuanwei, the purple-penetrating radiance, the yellow-receiving thoroughfare, the body’s primordial mandate, the flowing blessings of infant moon-essence, the green succession returning essence, repelling poison, warming the body, withering the true, augmenting the cinnabar’s splendor, traversing the earth—□ extending the years, the mandate of dark expeditions, the wisdom of tranquil truth, soaring and ascending, born of stone beams.

The true taboo: the Xuán constellation nurtures clouds, sprouting from grass roots, the jade grove receives the mandate. From the mouth □□ issues □□: "If not I, you shall not transcend. If not I, you shall not attain." Revolving spirit, exhaling radiance, the jade-splendored body. The Lord descends to the sands, bestowing cinnabar waters, originally issuing from the Three Heavens of Primordial Unity.

**Right:** Three hundred ninety characters. The Three Primordials inspect the true concealed writ, resolving the text.

**Celestial Writ Harmonizes with the Mandate:** The Primordial Six Yi participates in knowing the wood’s dissolution, revealing the omen’s form, each part distinct.

**Right:** Postscript talismanic incantations of the Nine Heavens, seventeen characters:
*Control the constricted heavens, pacify the heart; the enlightened master’s heart, the three bodies’ names, the heart conjoined with the Nine Sons, the Great Square’s baleful omens—none surpass the perfected. Thus the blade’s balefulness, the heavens too, precede the heavens. Cherish the Fire Bird, bind the heart, the Primordial World’s yin radiance.*

**Right:** *Dragon Flight* concealed incantation on plain silk, thirty-seven characters:
*Chaos-opening luminous guide, sudden gasping orchid net, rejoicing in transcendent catalpa, profound abyss plucking, perusing the foundation, bamboo slips level and serene, pitying knowledge, equal brilliance, flame abyss valley replete, dharma synthesis penetrating paulownia, radiant roaming prosperity, limpid pearl’s reflection, the master’s rejoicing elder, clouds extending, silent vase’s play, soaring above, feathered shadow’s bright extension, orchid’s luxuriance narrating, resplendent awaiting, measured heights, immortal prosperity frozen, traversing the Dark Radiance, ascending the Flourishing Cloud, universal immortal waves, journeying to the fan’s expanse, swift azure revering rosy clouds, grand feathered retention, nephew’s ascension, penetrating numinous captor, purple essence pine clouds, reverent tranquility, orchid mushrooms.*

Thirty-two characters belong to the *Orthodox Heavenly Names*:
*Ten Directions’ Orthodox Taboos, Four Directions’ Orthodox Taboos, Nine Stars’ Orthodox Taboos, Seven Stars’ Orthodox Taboos, Five Stars’ Orthodox Taboos, True Heaven Three, Twenty-Four Perfected, Eight Births, Eight Deaths.*

**Right:** One hundred ten *Lords of the Upper Clarity* taboos:
*Eastern Marchmount Heavenly Mystery, taboo: Origin Wind, style: Jade Prosperity Righteous Radiance.*
*Eastern Azure Emperor, Year Star’s Void Sovereign Son, Azure Emperor’s Dark Radiance Long Mystery Mansion, ingesting the Azure Emperor’s essence, chanting the true writ thrice.*

*Southern Marchmount Heavenly □, taboo: Open Luminance, style: Alas, Summoning Generation.*
*Southern Vermilion Emperor, Mars Star’s Void Sovereign Son, Vermilion Emperor’s Heavenly Origin Longevity Mansion, ingesting the Vermilion Emperor’s essence, chanting the true writ thrice.*

*Western Marchmount Heavenly Void, taboo: Luminous Sovereign, style: Luxuriant Grove.* *This taboo belongs to the lower talisman.*
*Western White Emperor, Venus Star’s White Treasury Son, White Emperor’s Primordial Radiance Longevity Mansion, ingesting the White Emperor’s essence, chanting the true writ thrice.*

*Northern Marchmount Primordial Perfection, taboo: Aid Initiation, style: Meng’s Exquisite Ice Jade.*
*Northern Black Emperor, Mercury Star’s Yu Qiang Lord, Black Emperor’s Primordial Luminance Dark Palace Mansion, ingesting the Black Emperor’s essence, chanting the true writ thrice.*

*Central Marchmount Flourishing Yang, taboo: Meng Ying, style: Forest Mound.*

**Right:** Explication of the Five Talismans within the staff, decoding the *Numinous Treasure’s* *Tally Talisman* characters:
*Flame luminous numinous majesty, profound floating ultimate, scorching red whirlwind crossbow penetrating, classed primordial clan, containing the pivot’s axis, superior metal prosperity, opening radiance, lunar essence treasure, black node numinous assembly, concealed marquis’ bureau, treasure taboo true incantation decoding the child.*

**Right:** Thirty-three characters, all the Five Directions’ *Orthodox Treasure Taboos*.
*Secret names without place unused—thus when inscribing talismans for transformation, journeying eastward, invoke the Eastern Direction’s true taboo; nothing fails to be repelled. Journeying southward, invoke the Southern Direction’s treasure taboo true name; nothing fails to be repelled.*

Explication of the transmission of *Upper Perfected Talisman Characters’* method and measure: those who attain the Dao are not merely *Middle Immortals*.
*From the* Crimson Writ’s Upper Chapter.

**Right:** Decoding the *Numinous Treasure’s Tally Talisman* characters.
Decoding the *Eight Radiant Records’* talismanic incantations:
*Loan taboo: Ancestral Maiden; Tripod taboo: Hook; Stele taboo: Shattered Torso; Crystal taboo: Zhang Tiger; Together taboo: Dark Wind.*

**Right:** These are the *Numinous Treasure’s Three Sections’* *Five Directions’ Demon Kings’* true surnames and names. The method’s lodged mysterious names—those of the *Eastern Florescence Purple Palace’s* *Azure Record*—are transmitted to attaining Daoists, not to *Middle Immortals*.
When journeying eastward, silently intone the *Azure Heaven Demon King’s* surname and name to dispel balefulness and avert calamity. When journeying southward, do likewise. For those journeying in the four seasons’ months, intone the Central Direction. When journeying westward, invoke the Western Direction’s names. When journeying northward, invoke the Northern Direction’s names. For all five directions’ comings and goings, inscribe talismans likewise. Those who transmit lightly face the *Wind Blade’s* trial.

*Cavernous Mystery Writ, Nine Heavens Perfected, Three-Five Concealed, Fourteen Words, Two-Seven Depart Six-Eight.*
*Former lives’ womb transformations, flowing golden primordial realm, unflourishing bodily virtue, already bound to divine immortals. Briefly traversing the Five Sufferings’ courts, former lives possess karmic affinity. In the empty pavilion, plain silk is arrayed; may the Eight Difficulties’ bodies be delivered, turbid qi scoured away, together frolicking with the Upper Perfected. Six Perfections engender Brahmanic traces; the Utmost Perfected emerges from the Void Mystery. Empty cavern facing cloudy empyrean, gazing upward to the Ten Poles’ guests. Forms receive the Heavenly Honored One’s aspect, boundlessly ascending to the worthy. The Supreme’s Three Heavens unite with the Seven Treasures to pacify the numinous.*

These *Three Sections’* *Eight Radiant Talismans’* true incantations deliver those whose lodged names are immortal; they are not recklessly transmitted to the unfaithful, facing the *Wind Blade’s* trial. The *Three Sections’* *Eight Radiant Records’* *Thirty-Two Heavens’ Treasure Writs* are methods for delivering those who attain the Dao, not transmitted to *Lower Immortals*. Unless one’s myriad kalpas’ cyclic revolutions and present life’s good affinity converge, the multitude does not behold these treasure incantations. One must select the proper person for transmission. Transmission must find its proper person. The true incantations emerge from the scriptural scrolls.

**Right:** These *Three Sections’* *Eight Radiant Talismans* comprise ninety-six talismans. The incantations emerge from the *Minor Kalpa* scrolls.

Moreover, the *Supreme’s Three Heavens United with the Seven Treasures to Pacify the Numinous*, ten characters, are the *Eight Radiant* postscripts’ great talismanic true incantations:
*Great illumination transforms immortals, returning to the origin to dissolve evil. The hun-spirit penetrates firm rectitude; myriad evils submit in assent. The Controller of Destinies fixes life; the august spirit pacifies the po. If baleful transgressions exist, all are consigned to the Dark Obscurity. The Great One transforms the Six Harmonies; the Five Spirits assist the Mud Pill. Seven accumulations extinguish the Three Paths; blood corpses block the lower passes. Three collars face the Imperial Perfected; uproot the placenta tree’s roots. The Elder is styled Divine Ancestor; the same-hearted Primordial Plain Lord. The Heavenly Sovereign enters the Grand Clarity; the Five Elders present the talismanic writ. Generation after generation ascends the Feathered Palace; the resplendent flower’s solar chariot. The Primordial King initiates luminous essence, securing my root life gate. Protecting and assisting, the green qi circulates; return to the upper valley’s lower mystery. The Dark Radiance reflects body and spirit, morning crossing the Supreme’s wheel. Sun and moon conjoin the jade collar; years follow the two dawns’ division. Within the cinnabar writ’s jade hall, one’s position is as the Supreme Lord. On the left, the Feathered Terrace’s child is engraved; on the right, the Golden Countenance Immortal is raised.*

The *Supreme Clarity’s Primordial Cavern Divine Writ of Jade Characters, Wondrous Scripture of the Dao* concludes.
