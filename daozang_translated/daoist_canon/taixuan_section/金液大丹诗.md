**Gold Elixir Great Elixir Poem**

One substance born of Heaven-Earth,
Two polarities nurture the medicinal root—
Yin-essence merges with Earth’s spirit,
Yang-qi emanates from Heaven’s soul.

Transformed as a tiger, it treads the Golden Path,
As a dragon, it hides within the Wooden Gate.
Solar essence refines the lunar shadow,
Counted steps secure it at Kunlun’s peak.

True Water submits to True Fire,
Fire’s perfection forges noble gold,
Gold’s perfection fells the Wood and transforms,
Returning to Earth, it earns reverence.

Sun and Moon refine yin and yang,
Wind and Clouds ensnare Dragon and Tiger.
Three cycles, four and five complete,
Transcending the world’s rise and fall.

Creation long submerged in flux,
Must cast off life’s decayed husk—
Red lead weighs heavy in Heaven’s realm,
White mercury stands apart in Dao’s gate.

Inheriting qi, the divine Dragon-Tiger,
Formed, the Dao’s husband and wife.
Yin-yang’s True Water and Fire,
Refined, they ascend to the Celestial Capital.

Nine transformations govern the three essences,
True-hearted refinement is no hardship—
The Tiger’s birth yields fierce divine water,
The Dragon’s change produces saintly gold.

Gold and Wood’s affinity unites the body,
Heaven-Earth forge the Great Elixir.
The Five Phases’ essence enters the abdomen,
Ascending the Nine-Heaven Altar.

Men know lead’s thousand-day alchemy,
True mercury binds itself—
Three autumns’ cultivation complete,
Boiled, it becomes the Tiger’s peak.

Dragon’s might subdues the Tiger’s crouch,
The Tiger’s ferocity tames the Dragon’s repose—
Life’s transformation opens the Victorious Gate,
Divine Elixir emerges in Mysterious Play.

One substance harmonizes with Heaven’s span,
Nine returns, seven illuminations—
Chase lead, yet it eludes,
Pursue mercury, it vanishes aloft.

Transformed as Tiger, it submerges in the Spring,
As Dragon, it hides in Fire’s treasure.
Divine clarity penetrates the Great Dao,
Refined, it crowns the King of Medicines.

Recognizing Wood’s vital essence,
Worthy of planting on the pool’s brink—
Balanced, it divides the Fire’s flame,
Harvesting noble gold’s bloom.

The Tiger’s fierce light is gathered,
The Dragon’s lightning flashes—
At once, the Saintly Dao is realized,
A thousand days refine the morning’s glow.

Discussing lead yet not knowing lead,
How can one grasp the profound principle?
The Green Dragon does not rise and fall,
The White Tiger hides in repose.

Darkly merging with True Qi,
Clearly sensing the High Immortal—
Cultivation’s power is vast,
Completion reveals Heaven’s intent.

The *Ren-Gui* Great Elixir Pool,
*Bing-Ding* as the True Medicine’s foundation,
*Geng-Xin* births the Tiger’s might,
*Jia-Yi* radiates the Dragon’s awe.

Sun and Moon enhance their splendor,
Yin and Yang exchange their robes—
Immortal transmission of Fire’s timing,
*Wu-Ji* wears the flying man’s crown.

Reflecting the Inner Five Phases,
Contracting Earth, harmonizing with Heaven,
Transforming the Tiger into a Golden Body,
Giving birth to the Dragon in Wooden Form.

Three Flowers refine by nodes,
One substance wraps the boundary script—
After seven returns and nine transformations,
Transcending the mundane, entering the Saintly Spirit.

Clarifying the Great Elixir’s core,
Seek within the mercury’s depths—
The Eastern Dragon meets its fate,
The Western Tiger pays homage.

Affinity and nature blend in harmony,
Containing breath, profound and deep—
Refined, it becomes the True One Qi,
Transcending the world, free from rise and fall.

The Great Dao is nameless in origin,
The Soul Elixir reveals its operation—
Heaven-Earth open the Sacred Thing,
Dragon and Tiger birth the Divine.

Water and Fire’s True Primordial Qi,
Yin and Yang refine the Solar Essence—
The Moon’s thirty-six revolutions,
Resplendent, granting eternal life.

One is True Water,
Three open the Immortal Path—
Four bloom the Flower of Days,
Two refine the Spirit-Soul.

Five hues manifest the Yang Qi,
Nine returns, the Elixir ascends from dust—
Circulating the Twelve Seasons’ script,
Life’s transformation lifts the body aloft.

Lead and Mercury’s Great Elixir Lord,
True Persons unite as one—
Heaven-Earth nurture the numinous Qi,
Dragon and Tiger split the Primordial Purity.

Five hues shine with clarity,
Three essences’ natures divide—
After nine transformations’ refinement,
The dwelling is abandoned, ascending to Azure Clouds.

The enlightened observe further,
Returning Elixirs in five forms—
Immortal hands personally refine,
Mortals transmit with devoted hearts.

Seeking the Tiger from a master’s guidance,
Knowing the Dragon through Dao’s scrutiny—
Three winters, the Martial and Civil turn,
Light illuminates the Nine-Heaven’s chill.

Divine Water irrigates the Flower Pool,
Knowing the interplay of presence and absence—
Green Dragon merges with the Tiger’s body,
White Tiger absorbs the Dragon’s fat.

Two substances communicate the Sacred,
Three essences blend in resplendent ritual—
A thousand days refine the Flower,
Completed, it honors Heaven’s timing.

Entering the Dao, one must know its non-duality,
With a pure heart, discerning the subtle—
Name and form granted in the Immortal Realm,
Lead and Mercury return to the Sacred.

Dragon and Tiger’s Returning Elixir’s root,
Husband and wife symbolize the medicinal foundation—
Yin and Yang’s division holds the secret key,
Few awaken to its profound truth.

A substance that ensnares the mind,
Immortal sages explore its depths—
The Fire Dragon sheds its Water shell,
The Water Tiger erects its Golden Spleen.

Transformed as Tiger, it becomes the True Groom,
Summoning the Dragon, it establishes the Saintly Bride—
Their union births the Great Dao,
Inviting them to the Nine-Function Chamber.

The Dao opens, aligning Heaven and Earth,
No mortal can glimpse the Immortal Path—
Lead and Mercury clearly reveal the truth,
The Cloud-Carriage’s path is unerring.

The Abyss defines South and North,
Thunder and Dipper align East and West—
Four Symbols ignite Dragon and Tiger,
Extraordinary function, resolve unyielding.

Scriptures and precepts discuss unity,
Yin and Yang rise from the North to South—
The Boy’s years: four, five, six,
The Girl’s years: twelve, thirteen.

Sun and Moon’s union in twilight’s embrace,
Husband and wife’s beauty grows ever more coveted—
Elixir’s transformation follows the Fire’s Dao,
Nine transformations—no idle talk.

The Soul Elixir reveals the hidden Dao,
One Qi circulates in the flames—
Responding to the Sun and Moon’s union,
Transforming Tiger and Dragon, salty and pungent.

Immortal sages play with Gold and Wood,
Morning and evening, they toy with the Black Hare—
Awakening to the principle of eternal life,
Through lead, they reject the old guest’s invitation.

Lead and Mercury cycle through spring and autumn,
Heaven-Earth’s midst is good for cultivation—
Completion yields the world-transcending medicine,
After ingestion, one attains Heaven’s roaming.

Yang-refinement gathers the born Soul,
Yin-dissolution scatters the dispersed Spirit—
Dragging the Dragon, devouring the Tiger,
Two substances flow in Sacred Communion.

The Dao is sought before one’s eyes,
Golden sprouts are not grasped in search—
The Golden Mountain opens the Tiger’s Valley,
Wooden Water washes the Dragon’s jaws.

Yang-qi, the Dragon’s breath, exhales,
Yin-wind, the Tiger’s inhalation—
Divine Flame burns the Sacred Water,
The Elixir ascends, soaring the Nine-Heavens.

Green Dragon and White Tiger study,
Lead and Mercury unite as kin—
Male and female share affinity,
Husband and wife radiate in crimson clouds.

Yin and Yang’s singular substance,
Morning and evening, fierce in the Three Flowers—
After eighteen Heavenly Stems,
The Cloud-Piercing Path is unerring.

「The Dao/Way enfolds the hidden elixir within the Yin-Yang embrace,
Immortal messengers descend to open and transcribe.
The Great Dao/Way’s divine communion is complete—
The Returned Elixir’s sacred essence is never cast aside.

Dragon’s *emotion/qing* is inscribed on the left bank,
Tiger’s *nature/xing* is recorded on the right—
Beneath the banner, the Primordial Lord rejoices,
At the Mystic Gate, feathered disciples knock.

One substance irrigates the Three *Jins* (refinements),
The Five Phases are mastered through profound inquiry—
Westward gather the Tiger’s roaring halt,
Eastward seize the Dragon’s resonant stillness.

In the Sacred Land, the Elixir’s form is perfected,
Only Heaven’s alignment harmonizes with the Dao/Way-heart—
Refining Yang through three *jius* (ninefold cycles),
Divine beings sigh in reverence and awe.

The Sun-Moon Elixir’s essence is most refined,
Gods and Immortals display their utmost sacredness—
When Yin-Yang’s union is complete,
Dragon and Tiger spontaneously merge and coalesce.

Water and Fire harmonize the *Zhenqi* (True Qi),
Morning and evening embody the refined form—
Three cycles of cold and heat’s power,
Sweet and exquisite flavor, its fragrance alone.

How does one advance in Dao/Way’s path?—no surety,
Clutching the heart like ice, yet firm—
Yellow Lead summons response and resonance,
Black Mercury reveals the essence’s condensation.

Two substances generate radiant brilliance,
The Three Flowers bloom with vibrant hues—
When Yin-essence fades, it vanishes utterly,
Yang-power ascends, riding the clouds.

Black Water purifies the profound depths,
White Lead attains its hidden essence—
Westward *Jin* (Metal) subdues Eastward Wood,
Eastward Wood originates from Westward *Jin*.

At their appointed meeting, hands cannot be parted,
In perfect harmony, hearts contract—
After three autumns of cultivation,
A thousand days refine the light and shade.

All things shed their mortal forms,
The Three Talents (Heaven, Earth, Man) are most spiritually sublime—
Know the Lead’s refinement and Mercury’s secret,
Clarify the Dao/Way to harmonize with Heaven’s script.

Refining the Tiger’s Elixir-power,
Capturing the Dragon’s essence to brew—
Once cold and heat are exhausted,
The True Self enters the Immortal Pavilion.

Lead and Mercury’s fame spreads far,
Yet few perceive their hidden Dao/Way—
Obscure and distant, harboring Water and Earth,
Dazzling and illuminating, casting light east and west.

*Qingxing* (emotion-nature) and divine light unite,
Yin-Yang’s sacred power converges—
Twenty-seven adjustments perfected,
One’s name is already inscribed in the Immortal Register.

Though Lead and Mercury are oft-heard of,
Few grasp their profound mysteries—
Red Lead emerges from Black Elixir,
White Mercury enters, light as Yellow.

Dragon and Tiger generate Golden Marrow,
Room (chamber) and Parameter (bedchamber) refine Wooden Essence—
A thousand days nurture the Three Flowers,
Nine Heavens welcome within the belly.

True Mercury rests with the Immortals,
True Lead grounds the Sacred Elixir—
In past births, one neared them briefly,
Now the Dao/Way’s mystery is unveiled.

Three years, the Divine Elixir shines,
Nine returns radiate luminous hues—
Later practitioners of the Dao/Way,
Seek the *Zihe* (Purple River) Robe.

The Dao/Way alone encompasses Heaven-Earth,
Bukan and *Kun* (Heaven-Earth) yield the Elixir’s peak—
The Five Phases all respond and transform,
The Four Symbols (trigrams) flow through every scripture.

Divine Water is the Primordial Sovereign,
True *Jin* (Metal) enters Wood’s refinement—
Who knows the Sacred Fire’s truth?
It transmutes Earth, ascending Nine Heavens.

Wood bears treasures fit for use,
Water enfolds True *Jin*—
Within the Five Phases’ essence is secured,
These Three *Bans* (substances) are profound.

Refining Yin-Yang’s Sacred Qi,
Nurturing the Tiger to earn the Dragon’s reverence—
A thousand days of fire’s culmination,
The Elixir’s light shines upon the Divine.

The Great Elixir returns as Returned Elixir,
A single grain ascends, piercing Heaven—
The Dragon’s might subdues the Tiger’s power,
The Tiger’s ferocity captures the Dragon’s breath.

Two years of shared gestation,
Three *Bans* (substances) distilled into one—
Ten months of divine penetration,
Earth is formed, seated upon the Golden Furnace.

True Water and Earth must be known—
*Kun*’s Primordial Victory is the Earthly Root,
*Zhen*’s hidden essence is the Sacred Wood,
*Li*’s borrowed fire is the *Jin*’s form.

The Five Phases must be discerned,
A thousand days refine the Spirit—
Essence is gathered, exhausting the Eight Trigrams,
Dragon and Tiger enfold treasures within.

Alas, the floating world is fleeting,
Hard to abandon the Gate of Life and Death—
Swiftly cultivate the Sacred Elixir,
Only then can one rival Heaven-Earth.

Divine Water decocts the Dragon’s *po* (spirit),
Sacred Flame refines the Tiger’s *hun* (soul)—
After three years of labor,
A single grain faces Heaven’s glory.

Still contemplation transforms sinking and floating,
Clarity of the Dao/Way knows no betrayal—
Divine beings should awaken to its truth,
Life and Death sway like withering and flourishing.

The Great Dao/Way’s root is transformation,
Cultivating the body to revive one’s fate—
The Five Phases’ true secrets are revealed,
Like a crown, pouring nectar as recompense.

Yellow Lead triumphs in entering the Mystic,
Black Mercury surges from the Spirit’s spring—
Two Qi meet and merge,
The Three Flowers are secretly wrapped and decocted.

East and West follow the Sun-Moon’s rhythm,
South and North move with the passing years—
After three years of labor,
Luminous light ranks the Immortals.

Formless, one hears the Great Dao/Way,
With Elixir, the Mystic is concealed—
True Water returns to True Fire,
Red Lead replaces Black Lead.

The Five Phases gather Qi fully,
The Four Symbols reverse the winds’ rotation—
Fire circulates through Yin-Yang’s embrace,
The Sacred Elixir gleams in the Azure Sky.

When *Bukan* and *Kun* harmonize in *Tai* (peace),
Sun-Moon nurture the *Hua* (Flower) Pool—
Green Wood’s Three Flowers are hidden,
White *Jin*’s Seven Maidens know.

Husband and Wife align as *Jin* and Wood,
Each birthing Tiger and Dragon offspring—
Nine turns and three cycles complete,
The Spirit’s communion leaves no doubt.

*Duì*’s (Lake) brilliance conceals the Golden Tiger,
*Zhen*’s (Thunder) rumble harbors the Wooden Dragon—
Rain and wind meet at their appointed hour,
*Qingxing* (emotion-nature) merges in warmth and reverence.

Water and Earth nourish the root and stem,
Yin-Yang sears the fundamental essence—
Past verdant clarity reveals profound logic,
Not shared with the common worldly folk.

True Lead dwells in the distant void,
Faintly visible, its form concealed—
First, South and North unite,
Then East and West merge together.

Three years of Fire’s power in motion,
Nine turns yield the Elixir’s fragrance—
Cold and heat, Yin and Yang prevail,
Heaven-Earth produce the Elixir’s sacredness.»

「The Great Dao is hard to discern,
Who knows the Five Phases within?
Buan (Heaven-Earth) holds the balance in its core,
The Soul and Spirit (*húnpò*) shine bright in the heart’s realm.

Earth’s Spirit (*dìpò*) reveals the True Principle,
Heaven’s Soul (*tiān hún*) unveils the Sacred Essence—
If one grasps this mystery,
Their name shall hang in the Nine Heavens’ glory.

The Western neighbor’s fine son boasts of his prowess.

Yin-Yang pair without deviation—
After three years of effort,
A single grain ascends to the celestial.

The lost laugh at the false and the unseen—
Descending with Earth’s Spirit,
Responding to Heaven’s talisman.

The name proclaimed in the Imperial Court.

After Seven Returns and Nine Circulations (*qī fǎn jiǔ huán*),
Effortless longevity (*xiāobì yǒng shòu*) shall endure.

Lead (*língqiān*) is the sovereign,
Mercury (*línggōng*) is the Fire-Lead’s subject—
Awakening to Yin-Yang’s logic,
One then knows the *Qingxing*’s true nature.

East and West unite in Metal-Wood,
Months, days, and hours align—
All Fire must pass through the Immortal Fire (*xiān huǒ*),
Only then can one master advance and retreat.

There is a substance that blends with Heaven’s workings,
No more than the True Adept (*dàshì*) knows—
To lie as Dragon, to rise as Tiger,
To call the groom the original wife.

Refining shifts through Metal-Wood,
Circulating the High Abyss (*kàn gāo*)—
The Three Flowers’ power spreads,
Ascending beyond the depths of ignorance.

Long life pierces the azure void.

There is a thing with hidden true name,
Born to commune with Heaven-Earth’s spirit—
The Sun Palace transmits bone-qi,
The Moon’s Cavern nurtures the body’s form.

Refine the Yang-soul to purity,
Dissolve the Yin-shadow to stillness—
*Bǐng-Dīng*’s martial arts now end,
One grain transcends the Three Pure Ones.

The Great Dao’s transmission is not vain,
It splits open Heaven-Earth’s origin—

Only the Sage’s words reveal its truth.

The Tiger’s form arises from Lead’s alchemy,
The Dragon’s name comes from Mercury’s roar—
Refine with Sun and Moon’s full measure,
Then serve the Garden of Highest Immortals.

To ponder is rare, to attain is rare—
Once found, it is as turning the palm,
Yet without it, guard the Empty Hall’s gate.

Yang-Mercury births Original Qi,
Yin-Sand endures through cold’s harsh years—
The Three Blooms follow seasonal cues,
Worthy to offer to the Jade Emperor’s gaze.

Three years pass without a single flaw.

Breathing communicates with the spirit’s stillness,

A year the Golden Tiger receives,
A changing season the Wooden Dragon craves—

The cycles turn the Flower’s bitter heart,
Refined, the medicine’s taste becomes sweet—
The Mysterious Light now shines,
The Elixir’s completion is serene beyond measure.

Sun and Moon each cast their light,
The Vital Essence flows, never dying—
The Dragon transforms in Wood-Fire’s embrace,
The Tiger changes in Water-Metal’s concealment.

The Four Symbols’ cycles converge,
The Five Phases return to the Earthly realm—
The Elixir is done in thirty months,
When taken, one attains Heaven’s hall.

The *Tài Yī* Divine Palace’s dust,
Shines brighter through the clear window—
Wood’s Vitality and Metal’s nature settled,
The Yellow Old Man and Purple Wanderer are true.

Water-Metal’s Tiger stands guard—
The Five Phases’ Qi harmonizes,
The Elixir’s power invites the Immortal Guest.

The Metal’s brilliance in the Pool of Divinity.

The Tiger is born in *Rén-Jǐ*’s embrace,
The Dragon rises near *Jiǎ-Yǐ*’s kin—
Heaven and Earth’s cycles turn complete,
The Purple Wanderer’s light shines upon mortals.

Mother’s essence, child’s transformation, is *Wēng*,
The Metal’s essence, Wood’s family, is *Róng*—
In two years, the hue returns,
In one breath, the sun’s red is seized.

Dissolving the Yin, the Dao is perfected,
Refining the *qi*, the Spirit’s passage is achieved—
The *Huan* of the True Elixir is named,
Long life ascends through the Azure void.

There is a hidden thing, its true name unknown,
Born of the Heaven-Earth’s sacred breath—
The Sun’s palace transmits *bone-qi*,
The Moon’s cavern nurtures the body’s form—
Refining the Yang soul is correct,
Dispelling the Yin shadow is done.

*Bǐng-Dīng*’s martial and civil are severed,
One grain suffices to cross the Three Pure Ones.

The Great Dao is not falsely passed down,
It splits open the Heaven-Earth’s origin—
The ignorant miss the subtle marvels,
The enlightened hear the Sage’s words.

Forging the Tiger through Lead’s transformation,
Naming the Dragon with Mercury’s proclamation—
Refining with Sun and Moon’s full measure,
Only then does one enter the Immortal Garden.

What is the logic of the Supreme Medicine?
Refining the Yin to birth the Yang—
Now dividing the South-North paths,
The East-West chambers are made right.

The Dragon and Tiger lie in breath,
The *Fáng Cān* hosts unseen guidance—
Nine returns, seven refineries,
The body surges, soaring aloft.

The spirit-sprout’s water has feeling,
Changing water earns the name *Qiáng*—
Autumn harvests the Metal’s marrow,
Spring stores the Wood’s inner essence.

From *Kūn*’s passage, refining Purple,
Entering the Sage, the Yellow is lightened—
*Wù-Jǐ* sits in the Central Palace,
Mutual aid ascends to the Upper Pure.

Sitting in the world’s elixir’s mystery,
Life begins from Heaven-Earth’s Lead—
Yin and Yang produce Dragon and Tiger,
Metal and Wood forge the Elixir Field.

Advance and retreat in the Three Blooms’ secrecy,
Balancing the Two *qi*’s rotation—
From the void, refining yields the full,
Changing bones, the Sage’s path is true.

Black Mercury births White Mercury,
From *Mēng* to the Sage’s work is done—
The Southern soul grows from the North,
The Western shadow gestates in the East.

Sun and Moon, Yin and Yang, resonate,
Spouses match as one—
In three autumns, twenty-seven cycles,
The Elixir’s power reaches the Spirit’s passage.

There is a thing of the Supreme Yin’s essence,
Only *Kūn*’s dew bears its true name—
The Three Refineries align the True Path,
The Five Colors grow ever distinct.

The Tiger lies, the Sage refines,
The Dragon is roasted in Sun and Moon’s broth—
Uniting the cycles of the scriptures,
The body’s Sage transcends mortal emotion.

Lead and Mercury’s names are far-reaching,
From the True, Water-Fire is born—
The Yellow is lightened, producing White Mercury,
White Mercury transforms into Yellow’s lightness.

The Two Essences harmonize as one,
A single person cannot follow both—
Nine Yangs refine to reveal the True,
The Fire’s end, all Immortals welcome.

Yellow Lead returns to Black Lead,
White Mercury’s refinement is profound—
The Western Pool hosts the male counterpart,
The Eastern Palace marvels at the female sage.

Union follows the Sun and Moon’s rhythm,
Transformation proves the Sage’s path—
Nine refineries, the Elixir’s light reveals itself,
Long life knows no count of years.

Creation’s force matches the Heavenly,
The Elixir’s text is listed within—
Yin and Yang balance the Five Colors,
Lead and Mercury move the Three Mysteries.

The Dragon and Tiger’s essence breathes,
The *Fáng Cān* hosts unseen alchemy—
Do not abandon the True Water-Fire,
Refining invites the Sage’s path.

The Five Colors, one essence, are born,
The Three Elements perform nine transformations—
The True Yin-Yang hues are correct,
The True Water-Fire is refined to completion.

True Mercury stands through Lead’s foundation,
True Dragon transforms as Tiger—
Refining with Sun and Moon’s light,
Three Nines display their clarity.

Sun and Moon bestow eternal life,
*Qián-Kūn*’s balance is inherent—
The Elixir’s logic is profound,
The Great Dao’s essence is boundless.

Four-Five’s Metal Bloom is fair,
Six-Three’s Wood stands true—
External flames align with inner fire,
Glory and shame are left to others’ strife.

True Water emerges from *Qián*’s origin,
True Metal is born from Wood’s gate—
The Spirit Pool collects the Tiger’s shadow,
The Sacred Fire subdues the Dragon’s soul.

Sun and Moon restrain the soul and shadow,
Yin and Yang refine the children and descendants—
Nine returns to *Wù-Jǐ*,
The Crane’s journey pays homage to the Heavenly Sage.

The Metal’s fluid, the Great Elixir’s poem, is complete.
