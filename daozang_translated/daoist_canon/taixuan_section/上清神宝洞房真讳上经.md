**The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Divine Treasure and the True Taboo Names of the Grotto Chamber**

This scripture is also named *The Arrayed Records of the Dao Lord Azure Lad* and *The Jade Scripture of the Grand Protector*. Cultivated by divine immortals, it is the perfection of Supreme Clarity.

In former times, Lady Wei Huacun transmitted it to Lord Xu Yuanyou, who dwelled in the Western City’s Rampart Terrace. There, he swore an oath with the Purple Radiance and the Tenfold Flowered Jade of Medicinal Essence, cutting the brocade of starry clouds and the soaring phoenix of treasured auroras to proclaim it to Supreme Clarity. After a hundred years, it was passed to the perfected ones, its texts never exposed to the common folk, so that the heavens of true illumination might be revealed.

The Jade Protector King Azure transmitted it to the Dao Lord, whose taboo name was Longguangxuan and whose style was Youwu. Born of the primordial qi of Wood Perfection in the Eastern Jade Na Country, upon the Mountain of Mystic Pendants, his jade-like form was embraced by verdant splendor, his flowing pearls flanked by guardians. After nine thousand circuits, fragrant blossoms of jasper unfolded, the roots of medicinal herbs gleamed, and his nine-foot jade countenance surveyed the ten directions. Heavenly maidens bore his robes, the Jade Emperor bowed in reverence, and his chanting voice rang clear, startling the forests and valleys.

The Heavenly Treasure Divine Immortal King bestowed upon the Azure Prime Perfected One a secret register of one hundred fifty-five texts, their true titles complete and exhaustive. Transforming the gates of the myriad destinies, he inaugurated the kalpa of Brahma, declaring the root of the Dao’s unfolding:

The utmost Dao is the Grotto of Emptiness.
The root of transformation is awakened intent.
Heaven and Earth do not speak, yet they manifest signs.
The ten thousand things and all species bear their forms.
Thunder, wind, clouds, and qi move by resonance.
Thus it is because awakened intent is attained—all things are transformed through the Grotto of Emptiness.
Transformation is constancy.
Change is name.
The myriad images of Heaven and Earth all arise from the Grotto of Emptiness, yet the Grotto of Emptiness has no being.
The images of transformation and awakened intent all emerge from the Grotto Chamber.
The Grotto Chamber is being within non-being.
The Grotto of Emptiness is non-being within being.
The chamber exists, yet things do not depend on man.
Heaven’s craft surpasses man’s, for its intent is not perceived yet is attained.
Man attains it through intent.
Attainment is taking.
Heaven manifests intent to man, bestowing it.
When what is bestowed aligns, then virtue and primordial qi merge as one, and there is nothing that cannot be done, nothing that cannot be seen.
Life and death, coming and going, the waxing and waning of the myriad kinds—all reside within awakened intent.
Heaven and Earth are our father and mother, and there is nothing in which they differ.
Beginning and end, being and non-being—none lie beyond this.
Acting and responding in accord, the subtle is revealed.
The subtle is the true taboo names of the Divine Treasure of the Supreme Clarity Grotto Chamber.
The true is the truth of this.
The taboo is the reverence for this.
One who attains this becomes a Most High Immortal.

The Jade Protector Dao Lord, at that time, emanated a radiance of jasper light, boundless and inexhaustible. His head bore a towering crown, his form adorned with pearls and treasures, draped in the hues of auroral clouds. Heaven and Earth proclaimed auspicious omens, and cinnabar mushrooms displayed their fragrance. Having perfected the true Dao, he withdrew to his retreat and addressed the perfected ones of later sagacity after the Golden Portal Emperor Lord:

“Great indeed! Profound and ultimate! By generating and broadly bestowing, nurturing the source of transformation, this is called the Jade Treasure. The infant guards the feminine, its profound blessings unseen—thus it is named the Azure Lad.”

The Golden Portal Emperor Lord addressed the Azure Lad:

“Your body possesses jade bones, your heart the Nine Sovereigns. The windows of the sun ascend and descend, the purple will rests beneath your cheeks, your azure eyes shine deeply. Naturally, you are fit to ascend as a high perfected one. The secret taboos of the utmost Dao are now revealed to you. As your form dwells in celestial harmony, you must also refine and cool it, so that being and non-being merge in transformation, ascending to the Mystic Palace.”

The Azure Lad Dao Lord withdrew to the fragrant grove of his retreat, pacing with his elbows and entreating further instruction. The Lord then declared:

“You must dwell in seclusion, close your eyes and practice seeing as though they were open. Whether your eyes are open or closed, do not abandon seeing in order to see. After a hundred days of this, at night your vision will penetrate with light. You must then gather the light of Heaven within the Mystic Mirror, contemplating the crystal water within your body. Then, gaze upward at the true extremity below, where the Three Perfected Ones of the Grotto Chamber reside within a square inch.

After a hundred days of this, you will hear a sound like the thunder of Heaven, and within that square inch, a space of a square *zhang* will appear. After a hundred and eighty days, it will be like a great hall. After three hundred days, like a palace. After a thousand days, it will equal Heaven and Earth. Without thought, you will think; without reflection, you will reflect; without awareness, you will be aware; without intent, you will intend. Only through the communion of essence will the myriad images be complete. All that was attained through awakened intent will reside within.

The divine Dao will manifest of itself, dimly yet brilliantly, and you will be far removed from the world. Within the Grotto Chamber, you will witness your own endless transformations, boundless and without limit. Should you suddenly ascend to Heaven, sit serenely in the Grotto Chamber, holding the scripture and facing south. The Yellow and the Old will then nourish you with divine marvels.”

The Azure Lad Dao Lord practiced this for a thousand days. His body bore the *huoluo* talisman, and he rode the clouds upon a phoenix to reach the Palace of the Sun. There, the crimson qi of the sun congealed its essence, coiling in a thousand folds. The spirit of the sun’s root condensed the purest jade, named Yuyi Chizhang Longwen. The Azure Lad bowed to it and gathered the sun’s essence.

**The Luminous Jade Text of Supreme Clarity**

The Azure Lad Dao Lord said:

“Drink the cinnabar of the sun, its double rings radiant and bright. Draw in and absorb the utmost essence, ascending to the moon. The yellow qi expands and enfolds, secretly gathering the golden rays. Nurture emptiness to cultivate brightness, and your spirit will be profoundly serene—thus it is called *Jielin Huangshu Huwen*.”

The Azure Lad Dao Lord gazed into the emptiness of the Mystic Ultimate, communing with the luminaries of the divine. The qi of the sun and moon conjoined, refining and cooling the true form.

The heavens and earth receive their subtlest essence, while the numinous spirits emerge from their chambers. Gazing back upon the Nine Heavens, soaring across the Eight Extremities, the Golden Perfected gather qi, and the Jade Empyrean radiates renewed light. The light permeates the singular form, revealing within the Three Palaces. The Three Palaces merge and transform into twenty-seven palaces, towering like the Golden Court, where Jade Infants sit in array.

The Mud-Pill Palace contains nine chambers, each with its own name, connecting below to the Long Loft and the Twelve Jade Cities. Within the Central Cinnabar Field lie nine palaces:

Between the high points of the two breasts, where the flesh is level, lies the Guarding Inch of the Twin Fields. On the left resides the great spirit Mingning, styled Shu Ping; on the right, the great spirit Zhengjing, styled Zi Zhang. Clad in embroidered red robes, they hold fire bells to illuminate the four directions.

The Loft encircles the Palace of the Perfected, wherein dwells the Jade Clarity Perfected, named Tian Yu, styled Xuan Tong. Clad in azure cloud robes, he holds a jade mirror.

The lungs form the Luminous Clarity Palace, home to the Pristine Flower Dao Lord, named Cheng, styled Yu Xu. Clad in flying cloud robes, seated upon a golden couch, he holds a great pearl like a chicken’s egg.

The heart forms the Cinnabar Prime Palace, wherein dwells the Jade Perfected, named Long Jing, styled Xi Shen. Clad in red brocade jade robes, he holds the sun in his mouth.

The spleen forms the Yellow Chamber Palace, wherein dwells the Central Jade Maiden, named Shesheng, styled Bo Hun. Clad in purple rosy cloud robes, she holds a jade ruler.

The liver forms the Orchid Spirit Palace, wherein dwells the Wood Duke, named Chang Jing, styled Meng Xian. Clad in azure cloud robes, he holds the Jade Emperor’s writ, seated upon a striped dragon.

The gallbladder forms the Supreme Perfection Palace, wherein dwells the Mystic Radiance Lad, named Yan Wei Yu, styled Xian Hun Zi. Clad in purple cloud robes, he holds a sword.

The left kidney forms the Jade Emperor’s Palace, wherein dwells the Mystic Minister Lord, named Tong Zhen, styled You Fu. Clad in green cloud robes, he holds a fiery jade.

The right kidney forms the Jade Maiden’s Palace, wherein dwells the Upright Perfection Lad, named Xu Gen, styled Zheng Xian. Clad in yellow jade robes, he sits with palms joined, facing inward.

Within the depths of the intestines lies the Supreme Constancy Palace, wherein dwells the Lofty Lord, named Dong Ying, styled Han Hua. Clad in azure cloud robes, he holds a bamboo staff.

The nine palaces above are inhabited by spirits like infants, seated amidst purple clouds, governing the square inch within.

The Lower Cinnabar Field also contains nine palaces:

Beside the navel, between the two high points where the flesh is level, lies the Guarding Twin Fields. Within reside two great spirits: on the left, Biaoyuan, styled Qi Wang; on the right, Liming, styled Jing Qing. Clad in purple embroidered robes, they hold fire torches to illuminate the Nine Abysses below and guard the radiance of life.

One inch inward lies the Hall of Light, home to the great spirit Taokang, named Yu Wei, styled Shang Ming. Clad in red brocade robes, he sits upon a golden couch.

Two inches inward lies the Grotto Chamber, home to the Mystic Supreme Emperor Lord, named Wu You, styled Ming Zhen. Clad in dark brocade robes, he holds a key.

Three inches inward lies the Cinnabar Field Palace, wherein dwells the great spirit of the Life Palace, named Wu Guang, styled Qin Yuan. Clad in red gauze robes, he holds a jade bell.

Four inches inward lies the Flowing Pearl Palace, wherein dwells the great spirit of Weak Water, named Ji Yuan, styled Tian Ying. Clad in white silk robes.

Five inches inward lies the Purple Ultimate Palace, wherein dwells the Great Unity spirit, named Baoling, styled Qingsheng. Clad in plain brocade robes.

One inch upward lies the Grotto Prime Palace, wherein dwells the Southern Jade Consort, named Su, styled Jue Chang. Clad in azure cloud robes.

Two inches upward lies the Grotto Court Palace, wherein dwells the Azure Prime Supreme Emperor, named Da Huang, styled Zeng Zi. Clad in yellow embroidered robes.

Three inches upward lies the Grotto Yang Palace, wherein dwells the Great Lord of the Sun’s Mystery, named Yu Ming, styled Jian Sheng. Clad in dark brocade robes.

Four inches upward lies the Grotto Perfection Palace, wherein dwells the Great Unity spirit, named Bo Gao, styled Du Yuan. Clad in vermilion robes, he sits upright, facing outward.

The nine palaces of the Lower Cinnabar Field, each a square inch, are inhabited by spirits shaped like infants, seated amidst yellow clouds.

The Azure Lad Dao Lord clearly beheld the twenty-seven Perfected, arrayed like Jade Infants, secretly forming a lotus chamber. The spirit turns inward, beyond knowing, and the form unites with the Supreme Mystery. The Dao and its virtue come to dwell, becoming one with heaven. The incantation reads:

Twin gates layered in residence,
Nine Jade Cities of the palaces.
The Three Palaces arrayed,
Cinnabar and azure spread their essence.
Circulating through a hundred passages,
Refining the corpse’s form.
Subtle existence merges with qi,
Transforming to generate light.
Commanding the Great Possession,
Ascending to fly in Jade Clarity.
The Dao replete with numinous treasures,
The Mystery governs the Perfected’s names.
Virtue blankets all beings,
The Jade Emperor’s face brightens.
The body bears the dragon chariot,
Circling the myriad heavens.
Gazing down upon the Three Luminaries,
Seated, knowing a hundred million years.
Composing this scripture in one chapter,
Inscribed upon the Eastern Flower Jade Tower of the Mystic Observatory,
To transmit the golden names and azure writings on jade slips
To those of the Highest Perfection.

The Jade Scripture of the Azure Lad’s Protection of the Dao Lord

Ninefold unfolding of the Dragon Embryo’s origin,
The embryo’s subtlety in the Great Non-Beginning.
Jade emptiness flows in constant non-being,
Intent and truth treasure their abundant meeting.
Flanking the sun at the eastern mulberry dawn,
Swallowing and absorbing from the Purple Gate.
The Three Primes reach the Prime of Non-Beginning,
Supreme virtue governs the Upper Mystery.
Moved and stirred, yet indistinct,
Wondrous enlightenment follows the Dao’s nature.
Taokang, father of the jade celestial sphere,
Life’s essence ascends to the Mud-Pill.
Cinnabar pearls nurture the cloud’s root,
Heaven’s awn descends into the abyss.
The true spirit merges with the mother’s essence,
Trickling like a gentle flowing spring.
Silently guiding the Lord Bo Yu,
Morning rosy clouds rise as congealed mist.
Illuminating and enfolding the Upper Jade Duke,
Supporting and settling within the visage’s chamber.
Venus conceals the mushroom’s bloom,
The Supreme Emperor bows at the jade steps.
Merging and transforming, the true and constant name,
Wisdom and wisdom command the Nine Returns.
A hundred million years are not too many,
Unchanging, the flying spirit elixir.
The Great Dao attains eternal abiding,
Eternal abiding between opening and closing.

The Jade Scripture of the Azure Lad Dao Lord is a covenant of utmost gravity, the mysterious pivot of the Dao. Now, resting in the Azure Grove, it oversees the Highest Perfected, harmonizing and guiding the spirit and qi, nurturing the origin of life. The numinous treasures and true names precede heaven and earth. Those who know this scripture will attain transcendence; those who know its precious names will ascend to the ancestral mystery, serving on high beside the Imperial Throne, with boundless years of life.
