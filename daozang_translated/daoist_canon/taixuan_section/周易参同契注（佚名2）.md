### *Commentary on the Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, Fascicle One

**Anonymous Commentary**

Qian and Kun are the gates of the *Yi*, the parents of all hexagrams. Kan and Li form the frame, turning the hub and aligning the spokes.

The *Xici* states: "Are Qian and Kun not the gates of the *Yi*?"
For Qian embodies pure yang, and Kun embodies pure yin.
All yang lines in the hexagrams derive from Qian’s yang;
all yin lines derive from Kun’s yin.
Thus, the yin and yang of Qian and Kun serve as the gateway to all hexagrams.

In the human body, Qian corresponds to the head, encompassing the ears, eyes, nose, mouth, and tongue—all that is manifest externally.
Kun corresponds to the abdomen, encompassing the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys—all that resides internally.
Thus, all things belonging to yang are the work of Qian;
those belonging to yin are the work of Kun.

In the beginning, there were no hexagrams.
Yet Kan was conceived within Kun, and Li was conceived within Qian.
In the human body, the kidneys belong to Kan and reside below;
the heart belongs to Li and resides above.
When Kan and Li unite, Kan circulates its yang, and Li circulates its yin, giving rise to the sixty-four hexagrams.
When the Kan-man and Li-woman in humans unite in intercourse, the essence of all things is thereby established.
Thus it is said: "Turning the hub and aligning the spokes."

**Chapter One (concluded)**

The Four Gendered Hexagrams serve as the bolt and key.
They encompass the Dao of yin and yang, just as a charioteer wields the marking line, holds the bit and reins, aligns the compass and square, follows the wheel tracks, and governs the exterior from the center.
Their reckoning lies in the pitch-pipes and calendar, where the lunar phases comprise five and six.
Thirty days in all.
The warp and weft attend the sun’s command, combining to make sixty, with firm and yielding as outer and inner.
The Four Hexagrams are Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li.
The gendered pairings are the Dao of yin and yang.
In their greatness, they exhaust the yin and yang of all hexagrams, all of which are encompassed by these four.
In their function, they set in motion the yin and yang of all hexagrams, all of which are activated by these four.
Thus, governing the exterior from the center is like the two holding the marking line within, so that the compass and square are naturally aligned without;
or the charioteer grasping the bit and reins within, so that the wheel tracks naturally follow without.
In their numerical aspect, Qian’s nine, Kun’s six, Kan’s seven, and Li’s eight truly form the guiding principles of the pitch-pipes and calendar.
Regarding a single month, two celestial stems span five days, and six stems span fifteen days—hence a month contains the numbers five and six.
When two hexagrams are used per day, firm and yielding alternate as warp and weft, outer and inner, fully realized in this manner.

**Chapter Two (concluded)**

At dawn of the new moon, *Zhun* presides over affairs; by dusk, *Meng* takes its turn.
Day and night each govern one hexagram, employed in due sequence.
After the *Qian* and *Kun* hexagrams, the *Yi* follows with *Zhun* and *Meng*.
Now, if *Zhun* rules at dawn and *Meng* at dusk, it is clear that two hexagrams are used each day.
If one further extends this sequence after *Zhun* and *Meng*, then day and night each govern one hexagram, and a month completes the cycle of sixty hexagrams.

**Chapter Three (concluded)**

From *Ji Ji* to the dark of the moon and the break of dawn...

**Chapter Four**

When an end is reached, it begins anew.
The celestial stems and earthly branches mark the cycles; movement and stillness have their early and late phases.
The *Yi* hexagrams conclude with *Ji Ji* and *Wei Ji*. Beginning from the first day with *Zhun* and *Meng* and proceeding to the dawn and dusk of the dark moon, it is clear that the cycle ends with *Ji* and *Wei*. Yet when an end is reached, it must have a beginning, so the next month’s first day again commences with *Zhun* and *Meng*.
Not only do the daily hexagrams follow their sequence, but *Zhun* and *Meng* also operate at the *zi* hour. Five days span two celestial stems, so the first quarter occurs at the *mao* hour, the last quarter at the *you* hour, while on the fifteenth and sixteenth days, the hexagrams operate at the *wu* hour. Their movements thus have early and late phases, which must not be overlooked.

**Chapter Five**

In spring and summer, the inner body is engaged, from *zi* to *chen* and *si*.
In autumn and winter, the outer is employed, from *wu* to *xu* and *hai*.
Yang qi arises at *zi* and ascends, hence spring and summer are termed the inner body. Yin qi descends from *wu*, hence autumn and winter are termed the outer use. This speaks of the twelve months’ fire phases.

**Chapter Six**

Rewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn; darkness and light follow cold and heat.
The line texts embody benevolence and righteousness, manifesting joy and anger in due season. Thus aligned with the four seasons, the Five Phases attain their principle.
In the *Yi*, the Way of Heaven has yin and yang, the Way of Earth has firm and yielding, and the Way of Man has benevolence and righteousness. When yang reaches spring, it brings forth life; when yin reaches autumn, it brings sternness. Man emulates yang’s life-giving by bestowing benevolence as reward, and yin’s sternness by enacting righteousness as punishment—his joy and anger thus manifest externally.
For the adept in cultivation, embodying spring’s life-giving occurs when yang qi is at its peak, at the first quarter of the month, when the golden essence takes flight. For spring belongs to Wood, and the golden essence to the Water of *Kan*. Water engenders Wood, embodying the principle of benevolence. Embodying autumn’s sternness occurs when yin qi is at its height, at the last quarter of the month, when the medicine is gathered. For autumn belongs to Metal, and the medicine of the *Li* palace belongs to Fire. Fire restrains Metal, embodying the principle of punishing rebellion. Thus aligned with the four seasons, how could the Five Phases not attain their principle?

**Chapter Seven**

Heaven and Earth establish their positions, and the *Yi* operates within them.
Heaven and Earth are the images of *Qian* and *Kun*. "Establish their positions" means arranging the positions of yin and yang in correspondence. The *Yi* refers to *Kan* and *Li*.
*Kan* and *Li* are the two functions of *Qian* and *Kun*. These two functions have no fixed line positions; they circulate through the six voids, their comings and goings unfixed, their ascent and descent without constancy. Hidden and submerged, they transform within. They enfold the myriad things, serving as the guiding principles of the Dao.
That *Kan* and *Li* are the two functions of *Qian* and *Kun* is because *Qian*, being pure yang, is wholly Heaven’s virtue and cannot act on its own. Thus the *Yi* states: "Heaven’s virtue cannot be made primary." Its function lies in yin—only by guarding foolishness with wisdom and clarity does the dragon’s power become usable. Hence it is said: "Seeing the dragon without a head is auspicious." "Without a head" means guarding foolishness.
*Kun*, being pure yin, cannot employ itself, nor can two lowly things command each other. Thus the *Yi* states: "Perseverance in correctness is beneficial." Its function lies in yang, for self-employment leads to delusion, while finding a master brings benefit. Hence it is said: "Losing friends in the northeast ultimately brings celebration." The northeast is the direction of yang.
Thus the *Qian* hexagram speaks of "using nine," and the *Kun* hexagram of "using six," while the others do not mention "use." When pure yang generates one yin, the central void of *Li* becomes *Qian*’s function. When pure yin generates one yang, the firm center of *Kan* becomes *Kun*’s function. Therefore, among the sixty hexagrams, all yang lines are set in motion by the yin within *Qian*, and all yin lines by the yang within *Kun*. This is why *Qian* and *Kun* are the parents of the hexagrams. They do not stand among the hexagrams themselves, while *Kan* and *Li* serve as their functions. Thus they too remain hidden and submerged, not manifesting through line positions.
The "six voids" refer to the initial state of all hexagrams, which begin with the pure body of *Kun*, their six central positions all empty. Only because the six positions are empty can *Kan* and *Li* transform within, circulating *Qian* and *Kun*’s yin and yang through the six voids, thereby completing the bodies of the sixty hexagrams. Precisely because they must circulate through the sixty hexagrams, yin and yang sometimes ascend or descend, come or go—hence they cannot be reduced to fixed patterns, nor do they have constant forms. Though *Kan* and *Li* do not act directly, they enfold the myriad things and serve as the guiding principles of the Dao.
In man, *Qian* is the father and *Kun* the mother. The father’s essence and the mother’s blood are also *Kan* and *Li* as the two functions of *Qian* and *Kun*. Yet neither father nor mother can act on their own: yang must rely on yin, and yin on yang. Only when *Kan* and *Li* interact and function together do the five viscera, six bowels, hundred bones, and nine orifices all arise therefrom.

**Chapter Eight**

To govern the existent with the non-existent, the vessel’s use lies in its emptiness.
Thus in tracing waxing and waning, *Kan* and *Li* vanish.
The existent is the myriad things; the non-existent is the single yang qi. The existent is the po; the non-existent is the hun.
Here, "non-existent" refers to *Kan* and *Li* generating the two things of yin and yang, thereby forming the sixty hexagrams. Hence it speaks of waxing and waning.

What is called "vanishing" refers to *Kan* and *Li* no longer functioning.

**Chapter Eight**

Words are not carelessly crafted; theories do not arise in vain.
Drawing evidence to demonstrate effects, measuring by the numinous and bright.
Extending categories to structure hexagrams, tracing principles for verification.
*Kan* is the lunar essence of *wu*; *Li* is the solar radiance of *ji*.
Sun and moon constitute the *Yi*, with firm and yielding in balance.
Earth reigns over the four seasons, weaving the beginning and end.
Green, red, white, and black each reside in their quadrant,
All receiving their mandate from the central palace, the work of *wu* and *ji*.
To say earth flourishes in the four seasons: among the five phases, earth has no fixed position, just as *Kan* and *Li* serve as the two functions of *Qian* and *Kun*, thereby circulating to form the sixty hexagrams.
Thus *Kan* governs *wu* and *Li* governs *ji*, both residing at the center.
From the first to the eighth day at noon, fifteen hexagrams are employed to symbolize spring’s green;
From the eighth day at noon to the full moon, fifteen hexagrams symbolize summer’s red;
From the sixteenth to the twenty-third day at noon, fifteen hexagrams symbolize autumn’s white;
From the twenty-third day at noon to the thirtieth day, fifteen hexagrams symbolize winter’s black.
Thus it is said: green, red, white, and black all receive their mandate from *wu* and *ji*.

**Chapter Nine**

The *Yi* is imagery.
No suspended image is more luminous than the sun and moon.
Exhausting the numinous to know transformation: when yang departs, yin arrives.
Like spokes converging at the hub, the wheel turns—
Emerging and entering, alternately rolling and unfolding.
The *Yi* contains three hundred eighty-four lines; based on the lines, tokens are drawn—these tokens are the sixty-four hexagrams.
From the dark moon to dawn, *Zhen* arrives to receive the token.
At this moment, heaven and earth unite their essence,
Sun and moon mutually sustain.
The male yang scatters its dark effusion;
The female yin transforms the yellow womb.
Chaos intermingles and conjoins,
The primal root establishes its foundation.
Nurturing the bud, fostering the calyx,
Congealing spirit to form the body.
All things tread forth from this,
No movement of the gnat but proceeds therefrom.
The male yang refers to *Kan*.
"Scattering its dark effusion" means first transforming into *Zhen*, then into *Dui*, until it becomes *Qian*.
*Qian* is heaven; heaven’s color is dark, thus the *Scripture of Dragon and Tiger* states: "The male yang is the azure-dark water."
The female yin refers to *Li*.
"Transforming the yellow womb" means first transforming into *Xun*, then into *Gen*, until it becomes *Kun*.
*Kun* is earth; earth’s color is yellow, thus the *Scripture of Dragon and Tiger* states: "The female yin is the ochre-yellow metal."

**Chapter Ten**

Thereupon, Confucius praised the primal chaos, the virtue of *Qian* and *Kun* penetrating emptiness.

**Chapter Eleven**

In ancient times, at the dawn of the Primordial August, *The Osprey* established the first beginning.
The rites of crowning and marriage intertwine their qi, and in the first year the sprout burgeons.
Of old, the sages composed the *Book of Changes*, whose Upper Canon begins with *Qian* and *Kun*—the Way of father and mother.
Thus the *Appended Judgments* states: "The Way of *Qian* completes the male; the Way of *Kun* completes the female."
The Lower Canon begins with *Feeling*, *Five*, and *Grief*—the Way of husband and wife.
Thus the *Sequence of Hexagrams* states: "Only with male and female does there come husband and wife."

Viewed from the standpoint of heaven and earth, *Qian* abides above while *Kun* abides below—this is the unjoined *Stagnation*.
Seen from the perspective of the individual body, the unjoined *Li*-female and *Kan*-male form the uncrossed *Fire and Water*—the *Unfinished*.
Is this not the truth that solitary yang cannot engender, solitary yin cannot complete, and only the vast and empty can penetrate all?

Yet when heaven and earth unite as *Peace*, when water ascends and fire descends to become *Completion*, is this not the truth that heaven and earth unite to generate the myriad things, and male and female unite to harmonize their aspirations?
Thus the sages ordered the *Book of Songs*, placing *The Osprey* at its head, and the Way of husband and wife was thereby rectified.

**Chapter Twelve**
The sage is not born in vain; above, he observes the manifest celestial signs.

**Chapter Twelve**
The celestial signs advance and retreat, expanding and contracting in accord with the seasons. Thus the *Book of Changes* aligns with the heart of heaven. The *Changes* correspond to heaven and earth—none but the sage can fathom this.

**Chapter Thirteen**
The *Fu* hexagram establishes the first sprouts;
The eldest son inherits the father’s form, the mother founds the primal foundation.
The waxing and waning of *Kun* above respond to the pitch-pipes,
Ascending and descending according to the pivot of the Dipper.
On the third day, clarity emerges—*Zhen* receives the west at *geng*.
On the eighth day, *Dui* receives *ding*, the first quarter hangs level as a cord.
On the fifteenth, the *Qian* body is complete, fullness reaches *jia* in the east.
The toad’s slowness and the hare’s radiance—sun and moon share a dual brightness.
The toad’s slowness marks the hexagram’s rhythm; the hare spits forth its living light.
When the seventh and eighth days’ course is done, the fifteenth’s count bends low in descent.

**Chapter Fourteen**
At the sixteenth turn, *Xun* receives the mandate, *xin* appears at dawn’s leveling.
*Gen* aligns with *bing* in the south—on the twenty-third, the last quarter.
On the thirtieth day, *Kun* at *yi* loses its companion in the northeast.
When the measure is exhausted, succession passes on, and the embodied *Dragon* is reborn.
The place where sun and moon meet is called the *chen*—thus in a year they meet twelve times.
Yet their meeting intersects at the new moon, hence it is said: “Sun and moon unite as jade discs” at the new moon.
Only at the new moon’s union do the moon’s dark essence sometimes eclipse the sun.
Yet both sun and moon move in reverse through the heavens—
the sun travels one degree per day, while the moon advances slightly more than thirteen degrees daily.
By the third day, the moon’s light begins to appear, having already moved nearly forty degrees from the sun.
Thus as the sun sets in the west, the moon receives the sun’s spirit—
like pure *Kun* gaining a single yang—this is the *Zhen* hexagram.
It appears above the western *geng* position, hence *Zhen* governs *geng*.
By the eighth day, the moon has drawn farther from the sun, its yang spirit growing full—
this is the *Dui* hexagram. As the sun sets, the moon’s course reaches the southern *ding* position—
this is the first quarter, hence *Dui* governs *ding*.
By the fifteenth day, sun and moon face each other, and the yang essence is complete—
thus the *Qian* hexagram. As the sun sets, the moon has risen above the eastern *jia* position, hence *Qian* governs *jia*.
Yet even as the moon’s spirit reaches fullness, by midnight at *ren-zi*, the yin essence has already begun—
this is the *Li* hexagram, hence *Li* governs *ren*.
From the sixteenth day onward, the yin essence first appears—
like pure *Qian* gaining a single yin—this is the *Xun* hexagram.
At the moment the spirit first stirs, its governed direction can be determined by the sun’s setting.
But once the yin essence has arisen, its emergence grows ever later,
and the moon’s position can no longer be fixed by the sun’s descent.
Thus its determination relies on the sun’s rising.
From the sixteenth day onward, as the sun prepares to ascend, the moon first reaches the western *xin* position—
hence *Xun* governs *xin*.
By the twenty-third day, the moon nears the sun again, its yang spirit half-diminished—
this is the *Gen* hexagram. As the sun rises, the moon’s course has just reached the southern *bing* position—
hence *Gen* governs *bing*, the last quarter.
The ancients said: “Near one, far three” describes the quarters.
At the first quarter, the moon’s forward motion has not yet distanced it far from the sun—hence “near one.”
At the last quarter, the moon has drawn much farther and now trails behind the sun—hence “far three.”
From the twenty-third to the month’s end, the yang essence is spent, returning to the *Kun* hexagram.
As the sun begins to rise, it reaches the eastern *yi* position—hence *Kun* governs *yi*.
Yet as the yin qi reaches its extreme, the yang essence is already conceived in the dark night at *zi* and *gui*—
this is the *Kan* hexagram, hence *Kan* governs *gui*.
In the following month, it again receives the sign of *Zhen* at *geng*, hence it is said: “The embodied *Dragon* is reborn.”
For *Zhen* is the Dragon.

**Chapter Fifteen**
*Ren* and *gui* pair with *jia* and *yi*; *Qian* and *Kun* encompass the beginning and end.
The numbers seven and eight make fifteen; nine and six likewise correspond.
The fifteen numbers of the four directions sum to thirty—
the yang qi seeks extinction and concealment.
The eight trigrams array the luminaries, their movements never losing the center.
*Qian* governs *jia*, yet also governs *ren*.
*Kun* governs *yi*, yet also governs *gui*.
According to the *Horizontal Heavenly Stem Cycle*,
*Kan* also governs *gui*, and *Li* also governs *ren*—why?
For the *Qian* hexagram is pure yang, and at yang’s extreme, a single yin arises—
thus when *Qian* reaches its yang extreme, *Li* is already born.
The *Kun* hexagram is pure yin, and at yin’s extreme, a single yang arises—
thus when *Kun* reaches its yin extreme, *Kan* is already born.
Hence it is said: “*Ren* and *gui* pair with *jia* and *yi*; *Qian* and *Kun* encompass the beginning and end.”
“The yang qi seeks extinction and concealment” means that by the thirtieth day, it transforms into pure *Kun*, leaving no yang—
just as by the thirtieth day, the moon has no light.

**Chapter Sixteen**
The primal essence is subtle and hard to perceive—
one infers and verifies through signs and evidence.
At rest, observe its images; model its forms.
Erect standards as measures, divine auspices to determine fortune or misfortune.
Issue decrees in accord with the seasons—
do not miss the moment when the lines move.
Above, examine the patterns of the *River Chart*;
below, sequence the earth’s flowing forms.
In the center, investigate the human heart—
compare and consider the Three Powers.
In motion, follow the hexagram’s rhythm;
at rest, rely on the *Image* texts.
*Qian* and *Kun* put into practice—
only then are heaven and earth ordered.
How could one not be cautious?
The secrets of fire and timing are most refined—
beyond the reach of ordinary reckoning.
One must carefully investigate and align with them,
creating diagrams and images to approximate their forms.
Is this not what is meant by “above, examine the patterns of the *River Chart*?”

Next, erect markers upon the earth to divine the moment’s auspices—
this may serve as a model for human conduct.
Is this not what is meant by “below, sequence the earth’s flowing forms?”

Further, only when one acts in accord with the seasons, neither exceeding nor falling short,
is this not what is meant by “in the center, investigate the human heart?”

Thus, when the Three Powers are settled and the hexagram’s rhythm unerring,
one’s virtue aligns with heaven and earth, one’s brightness joins with sun and moon,
and one’s fortune or misfortune accords with ghosts and spirits.
How could one not be cautious?

**Chapter Sixteen**
The first principle of governance is to grasp the subtle and profound,
to unfold and distribute treasures.
The essential Dao holds the handle of the Dipper, its pointer aligning with the twelve celestial branches to unify the transforming net.
When the lines stir within, fortune or misfortune arises without.
The five wefts interweave in sequence, responding to the seasons’ movements.
When the four and seven fall into discord, the twenty-eight lodgings lose their proper bearing, rising and bowing in disarray.

The first principle of governance speaks of the initial stage of refining the Golden Elixir.
One must first grasp the subtle and profound essence, making the heart as clear as counting one and two.
Only then may one follow the Dipper’s pointer to gather the myriad treasures in due order.
Once the pivotal mechanism is set and one moves in accord with the lines’ images,
fortune and misfortune will invariably respond.
The five wefts are the five phases and the four seasons,
intertwining and each following its principle, thus able to respond to the times.
The four and seven refer to the twenty-eight lodgings arrayed across the four directions,
forming the 360 degrees of the celestial circumference.
If their sequence is disrupted, whether ahead or behind, rising or bowing out of place,
discord will arise—how could one not be wary?

**Chapter Seventeen**
Wenchang oversees the records; the Three Dukes are summoned to account.
The hundred officials and their bureaus each govern their respective domains.
Wenchang signifies the ruler’s issuance of governance.
The Three Dukes symbolize *kan* and *li*.
The hundred officials symbolize the sixty hexagrams.

**Chapter Eighteen**
The sun unites the essence of the five phases;
the moon receives the discipline of the six pitch-standards.
Five and six make thirty degrees—
once the cycle is complete, it begins anew.
Tracing origins to grasp endings, one discerns the threads of survival and decay.
If the ruler grows arrogant and excessive, overbearing and deviating from the Dao,
or if ministers act with deceit and flattery, their conduct straying from the proper path,
the waxing and waning of the moon’s phases will fall into disorder, bringing misfortune and calamity.
Those who uphold the law must admonish and reprove, exposing faults to admonish the ruler.
When the ruler is arrogant and self-indulgent, nearing fullness,
this means that at the crucible’s edge, one fails to weigh the precise measures, disregarding the method.
When ministers act with deceit, straying from the proper path,
this means the sequence of the sixty hexagrams is disrupted, harming the divine chamber and the immortal embryo.

**Chapter Nineteen**
The Pole Star receives rectitude, at ease and entrusting matters below.
The Hall of Light disseminates governance, and the state suffers no harm to the Dao.
Within, one nurtures the self, abiding in tranquility and emptiness.
Tracing back to the hidden and manifest, the inner illumination shapes the body.
Seal the mouth to fortify the numinous root.
The Three Lights sink into obscurity, warming and nourishing the child-pearl.
Though unseen, it is near and easily sought.
As the Three Lights are drawn inward, they are said to sink into obscurity.
The Pole Star refers to the Dipper.
The human head mirrors heaven.
“Rectitude” refers to the mud-pill of the Nine Palaces.
“Receives rectitude” means transmuting the dragon and tiger of *kan* and *li* to present them here.
Only then may one be at ease, entrusting the work to the yin and yang registers below—
that is, refining with fire.
One *cun* before the mud-pill of the Nine Palaces lies the Hall of Light.
From there, one enters the Three Fields within,
so the state suffers no harm to the Dao, and long life may be preserved.
Yet one must also illuminate the inner elixir to nurture the self,
abiding in the realm of tranquility and emptiness.
Though the origin is hidden, the inner illumination shapes the body like a pearl born of water,
and the banks do not wither—this speaks of the lead in the *kan* palace.
As for gathering the mercury of the *li* palace and, with the dragon and tiger, fortifying the numinous root,
this is the qi of the five flowers in the heart.
Without sealing the mouth, it cannot be gathered.
The mouth is the *dui* trigram.
This is the true qi of one’s own body, not external qi—hence it is said to be near.

**Chapter Twenty**
The Yellow Center gradually permeates the principle, its moisture reaching the skin.
At first rectified, it is ultimately cultivated—
once the stem is established, the branches may be sustained.
The One veils and conceals it, so the world does not know.
The One is water.
The Yellow Center is the spleen, which transforms the medicine of cinnabar and stone
to nourish the four limbs and the five viscera, giving rise to branches and leaves—
hence it is said that once the ultimate is cultivated, the branches may be sustained.
The One is water.
It means water must not be recklessly discharged, for it can nurture the self from within—
yet the world does not comprehend this.

**Chapter Twenty-One**
The supreme virtue acts without striving, not seeking through scrutiny.
The lower virtue acts through effort, its function unceasing.
When the upper is sealed, it is called "being";
when the lower is sealed, it is called "non-being."
The non-being serves the upper,
where the numinous virtue resides.
These two apertures follow the method—
the qi of Metal also requires long endurance.

The supreme virtue and lower virtue refer to *Li* as the heart, which dwells above,
within which the Jade Fluid may become the Reverted Elixir, benefiting humanity—hence it is called supreme virtue.
*Kan* as the kidneys dwells below,
within which the Golden Fluid may also become the Reverted Elixir, benefiting humanity—hence it is called lower virtue.
To gather the Jade Fluid, one need not rely on cultivation.
To gather the Golden Fluid, one cannot do without the furnace and bellows—
without cultivation, it cannot be attained.
When sealed and obstructed,
the Jade Fluid is closed and enters the Mysterious Throat (the Mysterious Female),
then rejoicing in its return.
The Golden Fluid is closed and enters the Tail Gate,
then rejoicing in its absence of leakage.
This is the distinction between "being" and "non-being."
The Golden Fluid ascends from below to become the *po*;
the Jade Fluid descends from above to become the *hun*—
hence it is said the numinous virtue resides.

**Chapter Twenty-Two**
Know the white, guard the black—
white is Metal’s essence, black is Water’s foundation.
The numinous brightness comes of itself.
Water is the pivot of the Dao, its number named One.
The beginning of yin and yang,
mysteriously containing the Yellow Sprout.
The master of the five metals,
the Northern River Chariot.
Thus lead appears black without,
yet harbors golden splendor within—
clad in coarse cloth, bearing jade,
outwardly a madman.

Mysterious is the color of Heaven;
Yellow is the color of Earth.
Within pure *Qian*, yang reaches its extreme and generates yin,
whereupon *Li* arises.
From *Li* emerges *Xun*, then *Gen*, extending to *Kun*—
this is what is meant by containing the Yellow Sprout.
When a person receives the embryo,
it originates from the father’s essence,
transforming to generate the five viscera—
thus among the five viscera’s metals, the kidneys preside.
Preserved in the kidneys, it becomes Metal.
When the golden essence takes flight,
the River Chariot is employed to transport it—
the River Chariot is the qi ascending from the North to reach the Muddy Pellet.

**Chapter Twenty-Three**
Metal is the mother of Water,
the mother conceals the child’s embryo.
Water is the child of Metal,
the child dwells in the mother’s womb.
The Perfected One is most wondrous,
seeming to exist, seeming not to exist.
Like a great abyss with tangled kelp,
now sinking, now floating.
Withdrawing, they disperse,
each guarding its own domain.

Metal can generate Water—hence it is called the mother of Metal.
Metal resides within *Kan*—hence it is said to conceal the child’s embryo.
*Kan* is the kidneys; though the kidneys are Metal’s child,
they first dwell within the mother’s womb before this body exists.
Yet when first concealed in the mother’s womb,
if not for the Perfected One’s presence within,
how could it attain such wondrous subtlety?
Viewed from its subtlety, one takes it as being;
yet as a mere clod of earth, one takes it as non-being—
yet the myriad things are all contained within.
Like sinking and floating in the great abyss,
it cannot be fathomed by ordinary perception.
When it withdraws and disperses,
the five viscera, six bowels, hundred bones, and nine orifices
are all thereby completed.

**Chapter Twenty-Four**

**Chapter Twenty-Five**

Its essence resembles white; when refined, it becomes vermilion.
Tempered as external defense, white enfolds the steadfast core within.
Square and round, a mere inch in span—intermingled, they constrain one another.
Born before Heaven and Earth, majestic and exalted.

The human body’s upper part is Heaven; its lower part, Earth.
Before this body existed, it received the father’s essence,
and only then could this Heaven and Earth come to be—thus essence and qi take precedence.
The *Book of Changes* takes *Qian* as the head and *Kun* as the belly—this is the same principle.
Square and round, a mere inch in span—this is the cinnabar field.
Metal resides within *Kan*, and its color is white.
Yet if one does not obtain the vermilion of the southern quarter,
how could one complete the golden elixir?
It is like the father’s essence requiring the mother’s blood
to fulfill the meaning of generation and transformation.
Thus white abides within as the steadfast core,
while *Li* serves as external defense to refine it without—
hence they constrain one another within a single inch.
For within pure yin, one yang revives to form *Kan*,
then transforms into *Zhen*, into *Dui*, and finally into *Qian*.
Within pure yang, one yin arises to form *Li*,
then transforms into *Xun*, into *Gen*, and finally into *Kun*.
Thus *Kan* and *Li* are born before Heaven and Earth,
and so stand majestic and exalted.

**Chapter Twenty-Six**

Surrounding walls and watchtowers—shaped like Penglai’s isles.
Encircling barriers, sealed gates, four passages winding and slow.
Guard and defense are tight and firm, barring all wickedness.
Curved galleries connect, ever vigilant against the unforeseen.
One may remain free of care, yet not succumb to weariness.
The chamber brims with spirit and qi—none can detain them.
Those who preserve it thrive; those who lose it perish.
In movement and stillness, rest and activity, it ever accompanies the person.

The walls and watchtowers are the palaces of the kidney region.
The curved galleries are the Gate of the Tailbone.
Vigilance against the unforeseen means preventing leakage in dreams.
Only by maintaining no deviant thoughts in daily life can this be achieved.
Movement leads to loss of stillness, while rest and activity preserve it.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven**

These are the misguided methods of internal alchemy:
inward gazing with deliberate thought,
treading the steps of the Dipper and lunar lodges,
reckoning days and celestial stems.
The yin path suppresses nine and one, muddling and toying with the primordial womb.
Ingesting qi gurgles in the intestines and stomach;
exhaling the upright, inhaling external perversities.
Day and night, never sleeping outwardly;
from new moon to dark moon, never ceasing.
The body grows weary and exhausted, the mind dazed as if deranged.
The hundred vessels seethe and race, unable to settle into clarity.
Piling earth to erect altars, morning and evening offering reverent sacrifices.
Ghosts and spirits manifest forms, dreams and sleep stir emotions.
The heart rejoices, the mind delights—prolonging the appointed time.
Yet suddenly, life is cut short in death, exposed and rotting.
Every action goes awry, perverse and contrary to the pivotal mechanism.
Such arts are myriad, with a thousand strands and ten thousand threads—
all deviating from the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, twisting and turning against the Nine Capitals.

These are the sundry heterodox minor methods, by which later learners may know what to avoid.

**Chapter Twenty-Eight**

The discerning grasp its meaning, perceiving clearly its source.

Persevering in its practice, rising early and retiring late without rest,
After three years of ingesting the elixir, one ascends lightly and roams afar.
Striding through fire yet unscorched, entering water yet undrenched.
Able to appear, able to vanish—ever joyful, free from care.
The Dao perfected, virtue accomplished, one withdraws to await the moment.
The Great One then summons, and one’s name is transferred.
With merits fulfilled, one ascends on high, receiving the register and the chart.
The book of *Can* declares: those who apply their minds to fathom it
will find no elixir beyond the golden cinnabar.

**Chapter Twenty-Eight**

The *Fire Record* was not composed in vain; it expounds the *Yi* to clarify the process.
The crescent-moon method: the White Tiger serves as the pivot of refinement.
Mercury is the flowing pearl of the sun, the Green Dragon accompanying it.
Raising the sheaf to meet the west, soul and spirit naturally bind.
The upper crescent, *dui*, holds the number eight; the lower crescent, *gen*, also eight.
When the two crescents merge their essence, the body of *Qian* and *Kun* is formed.
Two eights make one *jin*; the Dao of the *Yi* stands upright, unwavering.
A *zhu* contains three hundred and eighty-four *zhu*, corresponding to the number of hexagrams and lines.
The upper crescent yields eight ounces of lead; the lower crescent, eight ounces of mercury.
One *liang* equals twenty-four *zhu*; together, sixteen *liang* total three hundred and eighty-four *zhu*,
matching the three hundred and eighty-four lines of the sixty-four hexagrams.
Thus it is said: the body of *Qian* and *Kun* is formed.
The White Tiger is the silver within *Kan*.
Without the crescent-moon furnace to refine it, this treasure can never be obtained.
It is called the pivot because, once this treasure is secured,
it must be circulated along the winding path until it reaches the Muddy Pellet and halts.
Next, *Li* becomes the sun, the flowing pearl emerging from the Jade Pool,
while the Green Dragon travels the same path to arrive.
If one can guide the mercury-dragon through the Mysterious Female’s gate,
then dragon and tiger unite—hence "raising the sheaf to meet the west."
The tiger is the *po*; the dragon, the *hun*—thus they bind within the crucible.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine**

Gold enters fierce fire, yet its color does not fade nor its luster dim.
Since the dawn of creation, the sun and moon have never lost their brightness,
nor has gold forfeited its weight, nor have the sun and moon altered their form.
Gold originally receives the solar tally at the new moon’s dawn.
When gold returns to its mother, the moon at dusk envelops it,
hiding its frame and sinking into the cavernous void.
Gold regains its original nature, and the cauldron’s radiance rejoices.
Gold is the fluid within *Kan*. Refined by the fire of *Li*, it grows ever firmer and more luminous.
The sun is *Li*; the moon, *Kan*.
Without the interplay of metal and fire, *Kan* and *Li* would lose their brilliance after use,
yet gold never loses its weight, for it is ceaselessly regenerated.
The sun and moon retain their form because their source is utterly steadfast.
Yet only when metal and fire are employed for the golden elixir can this hold true.
Otherwise, as the *Huangting Jing* says—"leaves fall, the tree withers, losing its verdure;
qi perishes, fluids leak, and the body is no more"—such cases cannot be spoken of in the same breath.
The *Classic* states: "Begin with rectitude, and the end will be well-ordered; establish the stem, and the branches may be grasped."
This is the meaning.
In general, gold is born from *Kan* and waxes and wanes with the sun’s spirit.
Thus, at the new moon, it receives the solar tally and grows ever more abundant.
From the birth of the yin tally to the dark of the moon, the lunar *po* transforms into *Kun*.
Thus gold returns to its mother, for *Kun*’s earth is gold’s mother.
Yet when yin reaches its extreme, yang is born.
At the dark of the moon, the moon already enfolds the sun’s spirit,
like *Kan* gestating within *Kun*.
Though its light is not yet visible externally, it lies concealed within its frame,
submerged in the cavernous void.
At this moment, the golden elixir regains its original nature, and its brilliance blazes ever brighter.

**Chapter Thirty**

The numbers of *zi* and *wu* combine to make three; *wu* and *ji* are called five.
When three and five harmonize, the eight minerals form the guiding principle.
Breathing in desire, contemplation unites them as husband and wife.
Yellow earth is gold’s father; the flowing pearl, water’s mother.
Water treats earth as its ghost; earth subdues water, preventing its rise.
The Vermilion Bird is the essence of fire, balancing victory and defeat.
When water prevails, fire is extinguished, and both perish, returning to the fertile earth.
Once the three natures converge, their original essence shares a common ancestor.
*Kan* is water, the number one; *Li* is fire, the number two.
Together they make three.
*Kan* governs *wu*; *Li* governs *ji*. *Wu* and *ji* belong to earth, the number five—hence "three-five."
The two embody the relationship of husband and wife, thus they harmonize.
The eight minerals are the eight luminous jades of the *Huangting Jing*,
referring to the elixir ingredients gathered from the eighth to the fifteenth day.
The two are prized as husband and wife, their union sought through breath.
Exhaling when the sun rises, inhaling when the moon appears.
Yellow earth is the fluid of the spleen, thus it generates the metal of the lungs.
The flowing pearl is the sun’s flowing pearl, also the lung’s fluid, thus it generates *Kan*’s water.
Yet when the yin tally arrives, the yang qi vanishes and hides, the body’s *po* transforming into *Kun*.
*Kun* belongs to earth, so water is subdued and grows faint, unable to stir.
Without the fire’s essence to harmonize it, how can its spirit be restored?
Only when water prevails and fire wanes does earth ultimately dominate, leaving no vitality.
Yet it is called "water’s prevalence" rather than "yin’s prevalence,"
for from the lower crescent to the thirtieth day, the season is winter, the direction north—hence "water prevails."

The Three Essences Share a Common Origin—this refers to the moment when a person first receives the embryo. The father’s essence serves as the foundation, transforming to form the five viscera, and thus the Five Phases of the five viscera all take water as their origin.

**Chapter Thirty-One**
Sesame prolongs life—this is *huma*.
The returning elixir may be ingested.
Gold’s nature does not decay, thus it is the treasure of all things.
Those who consume it as alchemists gain long life.
Earth wanders through the four seasons, guarding boundaries and setting rules.
Golden sand enters the five viscera, dispersing like mist or wind and rain.
Black vapor reaches the four limbs, restoring radiance and luster to the complexion.
White hair turns black again, fallen teeth regrow in their original place.
The elderly regain youthful vigor, the aged crone becomes a maiden.
Transforming form to escape worldly calamity, one is called a Perfected Person.
The gold within *Kan* is refined into the returning elixir, never decaying—thus it is the greatest treasure among all things.
"Earth wanders through the four seasons" means that the two trigrams *Kan* and *Li* govern *wu* and *ji*, distributing the sixty-four hexagrams across thirty days, dividing them into four seasons.
Thus, one month seizes the qi of an entire year.
Beyond the crucible and furnace, *Kan*-gold and *Li*-sand are used to nurture the inner elixir.
When golden sand enters the five viscera, it disperses like clouds and mist, moistening like wind and rain.
Thus, it steams the four limbs, reversing age to restore youth—how could this not have its foundation here?

**Chapter Thirty-Two**
Lead powder cast into fire loses its color and reverts to lead.
Ice and snow, warmed by hot water, dissolve into the Great Mystery.
Gold takes cinnabar as its essence, harmonizing with mercury.
Transformation arises from its authenticity, beginning and end naturally following one another.
To become an immortal through ingestion, one must use substances of the same kind.
Plant millet with millet, hatch chicks with eggs.
Supporting nature with like kinds, things form easily as if molded.
Fish eyes are not pearls, thistles have no value.
Like attracts like; discordant matters do not yield treasure.
Thus, swallows do not birth phoenixes, foxes and hares do not nurse horses.
Water does not flow upward in flames, fire does not moisten downward.
Lead powder is made from lead—cast into fire, it reverts to lead.
Ice and snow, formed from water, melt in warm water to become water again.
So too the golden elixir relies on cinnabar and mercury; when fire ceases, it returns to its original nature.
This reveals that things have their roots, and beginning and end cannot destroy themselves.
How could those who cultivate the elixir disregard *Kan* and *Li* and employ their minds elsewhere?

**Chapter Thirty-Three**
The world abounds with scholars, gifted with lofty talent.
Yet chance meetings elude them, wasting fire and squandering wealth.
They rely on texts, imposing their own interpretations.
Threads lack cause, measures lose control.
They smelt malachite and quartz, purchase mother-of-pearl and lodestone.
They burn sulfur with camphor wood, knead clay and refine it into flying ash.
They smelt the five metals with copper beneath the bellows, using them as auxiliary pivots.
Mixed natures of different kinds—how could they willingly unite?
A thousand attempts lead to ten thousand failures; what they seek to transmute turns to dross.
Fortune never favors them, for only the sage truly understands.
From youth to white-haired age, doubt arises midway.
Turning from the Dao to cling to delusion, leaving the straight path for crooked byways.
Peering through a tube, their vision is narrow—how can they gauge what lies ahead?
If wisdom is insufficient to illuminate this principle, do not rashly act on whim.
To act on whim invites the scorn of those who know.

As for the utmost sages, none surpass Fuxi, who first drew the Eight Trigrams, modeling them upon Heaven and Earth. King Wen, imperial ancestor, structured the forms and composed the line statements. The Master, near-sage and hero, supplemented them with the *Ten Wings*. These three lords, Heaven’s chosen, arose in succession through the ages. Though their excellence followed in steps, their virtue and power did not differ in kind. Their creations built upon what came before, their calculations weighed each fraction with care. What has form is easily measured, but what leaves no trace is hard to contemplate. Their deeds set patterns for emulation, their works established the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents* for the world. Lacking innate foreknowledge, they relied on teachers to awaken their understanding. Bright as one who parts the curtains, they opened their eyes and ascended the high terrace. The *Book of Changes* was thus completed by the hands of these three sages—how could it be easily understood? How much more so the subtle principles of the Golden Elixir, which embodies the *Changes* in its very essence? Its mysteries and hidden depths surpass even these.

The *Fire Records* of six hundred chapters share a common aim. Though their words are earnestly expounded,世 people do not ponder them deeply. Tracing their origins, the obscure and the manifest originally dwell as one. I speak here for the wise—how dare I treat these writings lightly? Yet if I seal my lips in silence, I risk severing the Way and incurring punishment. To commit my thoughts to bamboo and silk might reveal Heaven’s tally. Hesitant, I sigh in uncertainty, gazing up and down in foolish attachment. The art of refinement has its methods, yet I hesitate to lay them all bare. I shall outline only their essential framework, that the branches may be seen through the guiding threads. These six hundred chapters correspond to a year’s ten months of firing—excluding the second and eighth months of rest—with each month employing sixty hexagrams, totaling six hundred. "Obscure" refers to the Way of Heaven and Earth; "manifest" refers to man.

With metal as the embankment, water enters and flows freely.

With gold reckoned at fifteen and water’s measure the same,
Before the furnace, fix the weights—five parts water in excess.
These two become the true essence, gold’s weight as in its origin.
The third then does not enter; fire’s dual aspect joins with it.
Three substances unite in reception,
Transforming with a power divine.
Beneath lies the qi of Great Yang,
Steaming and seething in but a moment.
First liquid, then congealing,
It is called the Yellow Ascent.
As years and months draw to their close,
Nature is undone and lifespan harmed.
The form becomes ash and dust,
Appearing like dust on a bright window.

The fifteen refers to taking five from ten.
From the first to the fifteenth day,
One gathers gold at the waxing half-moon—
Thus below it is said “five parts water.”
Water is the numinous water of the Jade Pool, likewise measured.
The “third that does not enter” divides one day into four parts:
Both gold and water take one part,
While the remaining twenty-three days do not.
“Fire’s dual aspect” refers to the two *gen* trigrams of yin and yang, the fire of necessity.
Gold is the yang within *kan*,
Water is the yin within *li*, the clear water of the Jade Pool.

“As years and months draw to their close”:
In the twelfth month, the end lies in the *kun* hexagram’s close at the *hai* month.
In one month, it ends on the thirtieth day of *kun-yi*.
In one day, it ends at the *hai* hour.
The yang soul of fire perishes therein—thus it is called “nature undone.”
Each day steals a minor year,
Each month steals a middle year,
Twelve months steal a great year,
All reaching their term by year’s end, harming one’s clarity.
Only when thus undone and harmed
Does the moon’s form resemble ash and dust,
Its appearance no different from dust on a bright window.

Entering through the Crimson Gate,
Seal its junctures fast,
Ensuring all is whole and firm.
Beneath, the blazing fire spreads,
Its roar ceaseless day and night.
First, the civil method is applied;
In the end, the martial is arrayed.
Observe with utmost care,
Discerning the shifts of cold and warmth.
Through the twelve cyclical nodes,
At each completion, attend anew.
When qi is spent and life near its close,
Rest and death claim the hun and po souls.
The hue shifts, turning deep violet—
Resplendent, the Reverted Elixir forms.
Ground to powder, shaped into a single pellet,
The *daogui* is most divine.
Prayers and treatments combine here,
Where all medicines converge.

The Crimson Gate refers to the crucible.
Seal it whole and firm, allowing no leaks,
Then kindle the fire to refine it.
Begin with the civil, end with the martial,
Attending to cold and warmth.
When the fire’s measure completes one cycle,
Qi is exhausted, the flame spent,
The hun fades, the po returns—
And the Elixir is achieved.
What is this if not divine?

Extending the reckoning of the Five Phases,
Concise yet not cumbersome.
Water is raised to quench fire,
And suddenly light is extinguished.
Sun and moon press close,
Ever between dark and dawn.
When water waxes, Kan encroaches on yang,
When fire wanes, Li dims the day.
Yin and yang consume each other,
Their intercourse the natural Dao.

The moon itself holds no brightness,
But borrows light from the sun.
Only when the moon reaches its darkest
Does it transform into pure Kun’s body.
Yet within, Kan’s yang is already conceived,
Thus at the cusp of dark and dawn,
The moon may encroach on yang—
Hence the saying of raising water to quench fire.
Kan encroaching on yang, Li dimming the day—
This is the moon eclipsing the sun,
Also called the natural intercourse of yin and yang.

Above, Chapter Thirty-Nine.

Names serve to fix essence,
Characters express the nature’s speech.
When metal returns to its original nature,
Only then is it called the Reverted Elixir.
I dare not speak falsely,
But emulate the sages’ texts.
Ancient records speak of Dragon and Tiger,
The Yellow Emperor praised Golden Flower.
Huainan refined Autumn Stone,
Wang Yang added Yellow Sprout.
The worthy can uphold and practice,
The unworthy must not partake.
The Dao of past and present remains one,
Its discourse reveals all plans.
Scholars, exert yourselves,
Reflect deeply and ponder.
The essential words are plain,
Clear and never deceiving.

Names correspond to tangible reality,
While characters emerge from the nameless.
The "having" is the *po*, its essence;
The "non-having" is the *hun*, its nature.
Only when the Elixir’s fire is extinguished
Can nature be restored and the Elixir formed.
Though the principles of the Golden Elixir
Require careful attention to grasp,
Its meaning is self-evident, not concealed.

*Anonymous Commentary*

The Qian’s firmness and Kun’s softness,
Mutually embracing in union.
Yang bestows, yin receives,
Male and female each requiring the other.
Only when they #1 unite in creation
Does essence-qi begin to unfold.
Kan and Li crown the head,
Radiance spreading and descending.
The profound and obscure are hard to fathom,
Impossible to depict in diagrams.
The sage measures and weighs,
Aligning the primal foundations in sequence.
The four blend into chaos,
Directly #2 entering the void and nothingness.
The sixty hexagrams expand and spread as a chariot,
Dragon and horse harnessed to the yoke,
The enlightened ruler mastering the seasons.
In harmony, they follow,
The path level and without deviation.
Deviant ways are perilous and treacherous,
Toppling and endangering the state.
From the first to the fifteenth day,
Qian envelops Kun.
From the sixteenth to the thirtieth day,
Kun envelops Qian.

The moon as a celestial body initially possesses only its substance, yet it becomes luminous only after receiving the light of the yang. The primal foundations are Kan and Li. The four refer to the addition of Qian and Kun. "Entering the void" means non-application. The chariot carries the sixty hexagrams as it moves. The ruler is the heart-mind.

**Chapter Forty-One**
When the noble person dwells in their chamber and their words are virtuous, they elicit a response even from a thousand *li* away. This speaks of the lord of ten thousand chariots, abiding within the nine-fold chamber, issuing decrees and commands, aligning with the rhythms of yin and yang. Conceal the vessel and await the proper time; do not transgress the hexagrams and months. *Zhun* employs *zi* and *shen*; *Meng* uses *yin* and *xu*. The remaining sixty hexagrams each have their own days. Issuing decrees and commands in accord with the rhythms of yin and yang refers to extracting the elixir and regulating the firing times.

Regarding the sixty hexagrams, one day employs two hexagrams. Regarding the firing process, one day uses two periods—morning and evening. Thus, only *Zhun* and *Meng* are mentioned, as they are the first hexagrams following *Qian* and *Kun*, though their application naturally involves advance and retreat. Hence, the timing differs before and after. For instance, at midnight, the *zi* hour, when the first yang arises, one embodies the single yang and applies the fire. At the *chou* hour, when the second yang arises, one embodies the two yang and applies the fire. By the *si* hour, one employs the sixfold fire. One count corresponds to three qi manifesting as a single yang line. Two counts correspond to three cycles of two qi, manifesting as two yang lines. By six counts, three cycles of six counts manifest the full six yang. This is the way of eight transformations to complete a hexagram.

When the inverted yin tally first arises at *wu*, one retreats by one count, applying the fivefold fire. Retreating to the *hai* hour, the six yin are complete, and no fire remains. The statement that *Zhun* employs *zi* and *shen* refers specifically to the *Zhun* hexagram, for it is composed of upper Kan and lower Zhen. The Zhen hexagram begins at *gengzi*, while the Kan hexagram next begins at *wushen*. The statement that *Meng* uses *yin* and *xu* likewise refers to the *Meng* hexagram, for it is composed of upper Gen and lower Kan. Kan begins at *wuyin*, while Gen next begins at *bingxu*. Thus, each hexagram has its own morning and evening.

Regarding the hexagrams of the direct days, the sixty hexagrams are recorded within the twelve hours, their application each having its own sequence. Yet in a single day, fire is not applied beyond two hours, so *Zhun* and *Meng* are cited as the general case.

**Chapter Forty-Two**
I have briefly set forth the two images, though I have not yet exhausted their details.

**Chapter Forty-Three**
Establishing principles#8 calls for enacting punishments; applying benevolence requires bestowing virtue. Those who defy them meet misfortune; those who follow them attain fortune#9. Consult the calendrical statutes, abide in utmost sincerity and meticulousness. Carefully observe the celestial stems and branches, scrutinizing the waxing and waning. Even the slightest deviation brings regret and harm. From the first to the fifteenth day, brightness is bestowed upon the moon, thus it is called "applying benevolence." From the sixteenth to the thirtieth day, the lunar essence gradually obscures brightness, thus it is called "enacting punishments."

**Chapter Forty-Four**
At the two solstices, the measures change, diverging and twisting in complexity. Midwinter brings scorching heat; midsummer yields frost and snow#10. At the two equinoxes, the directions are askew, no longer aligning with the clepsydra’s marks. Wind and rain fall out of season; floods and droughts contend. Locusts surge like boiling water; strange grasses sprout wildly. Heaven displays its omens; mountains collapse and the earth splits#11. The filial son’s devotion moves the August Ultimate. Near at hand, it issues from his own mouth; afar, it flows into distant lands. Some thereby invite calamity; some thereby secure fortune. Some usher in great peace; some provoke warfare. These four outcomes arise from the heart’s intent.

The winter solstice corresponds to the *zi* hour; the summer solstice to the *wu* hour; the spring equinox to the *mao* hour; the autumn equinox to the *you* hour. At the winter solstice, when the first *yang* arises, apply the first-grade fire. When the six *yang* reach their peak, apply the sixth-grade fire. At the summer solstice, when the first *yin* arises, reduce the fire by one grade, applying only the fifth grade. When the six *yin* reach their peak, the fire grades are entirely extinguished.

Taking the month of the winter solstice as an example: in one month, only the first-grade fire is applied, always during the *zi* hour. This holds for all twelve months. For instance, from the first to the early third day, apply the fire during the *zi* hour; from the evening of the third to the fifth day, apply it during the *chou* and *hai* hours; from the sixth to the early eighth day, apply it during the *yin* and *xu* hours; from the evening of the eighth to the tenth day, apply it during the *mao* and *you* hours; from the eleventh to the early thirteenth day, apply it during the *chen* and *shen* hours; from the evening of the thirteenth to the fifteenth day, apply it during the *si* and *wei* hours; from the sixteenth to the early eighteenth day, apply it during the *wu* hour; from the evening of the eighteenth to the twentieth day, apply it during the *si* and *wei* hours; from the twenty-first to the early twenty-third day, apply it during the *chen* and *shen* hours; from the evening of the twenty-third to the twenty-fifth day, apply it during the *mao* and *you* hours; from the twenty-sixth to the early twenty-eighth day, apply it during the *yin* and *xu* hours; from the twenty-eighth to the thirtieth day, apply it during the *chou* and *hai* hours. This is the fifth section on the daily application of fire in both morning and evening.

As for the twelfth month, when the second *yang* arises, the application of the second-grade fire follows the same pattern. From this, one may silently comprehend the progression from the first *yang* to the sixth *yang*.

**Chapter Forty-Five**
Movement and stillness have their constancy; adhere to their guiding line. The four seasons proceed in due order, harmonizing with the *qi*. The firm and the yielding are decisively divided, never encroaching upon one another. The Five Phases guard their boundaries, neither recklessly expanding nor contracting. The *Yi* circulates in ceaseless flow, bending and stretching, reversing and repeating#12.

Harmonizing with the *qi* means that when the *yang* arises at the *zi* hour, one may apply the first-grade fire. Though month, hour, and day converge, the fire may still be applied gradually, never in rapid succession. For instance, if one hastily applies the fire of the *chou* and *yin* hours, it will only bring harm. Why? Because those two hours lack the corresponding second or third *yang* to respond. This is why it is prized to harmonize with the *qi*.

**Chapter Forty-Six**
Between the dark and new moons, the signs align and proceed in accord. Primal chaos and the vast expanse unite; the female and male follow one another. Essence and moisture flow and permeate, bestowing transformation and circulation. The numinous brightness of Heaven and Earth#13 cannot be measured. Employ them to secure the body, concealing form and hiding away.

It begins in the northeast, in the region of *Ji* and *Dou*. Revolving rightward, it spews forth the wheel’s radiance and spits out the sprout’s light. From the hidden depths, the obscure#14 scatters its luminous essence. From the new moon to the dark moon, the fire grades must all align precisely, without excess or deficiency. Only from the first quarter to the last quarter does the primal chaos prevail, where female and male unite, and the essences of *Kan* and *Li* flow and circulate. It is fitting to gather and respond during the *chou* and *yin* hours, which correspond to the degrees of *Ji* and *Dou*. The rightward revolution is retrograde motion. The spewing wheel is the moon’s radiance; the spitting sprout is the sun’s radiance. The hidden depths are the palaces of *Kan* and *Li*.

**Chapter Forty-Seven**
Above the *Bi* constellation, *Zhen* emerges as the omen. The *yang* *qi* initiates its inception; the first nine is the hidden dragon. *Yang* is established by threes; *yin* communicates by eights. Thus, on the third day, *Zhen* stirs; on the eighth day, *Dui* proceeds. The second nine is the visible dragon, harmonious and luminous. When the virtues of three and five are perfected, the *Qian* body is complete. The third nine remains vigilant at dusk, its divine tally diminished and broken. As prosperity and decline gradually transform, it ultimately returns to its origin. *Xun* continues its lineage, firmly securing and upholding. The fourth nine hovers in hesitation, advancing and retreating along a perilous path. *Gen* governs cessation and progression#15, never transgressing#16 the proper time. On the twenty-third day, it guards the appointed moment of the crescent. The fifth nine is the soaring dragon, ascending to the celestial position with joy. The sixth five, *Kun* submits, binding and encompassing the beginning and end. It nurtures the multitude of offspring, becoming the mother of all its kind. The ninth above is the dragon in excess, waging virtue’s battle in the wilds. When the nine is employed, it flutters lightly, serving as the Dao’s compass. The *yang* numbers are exhausted, and once exhausted, they arise anew. Pushing forth the emotions to unite with nature, they turn and intertwine.

Above the *Bi* constellation lies the *geng* direction. The first *yang* arises, corresponding to the *Zhen* hexagram and the *chufu* line of the first nine. On the third day, life begins to brighten. On the eighth day, the first quarter arrives, and the second *yang* flourishes, corresponding to the *Dui* hexagram and the line of the second nine. On the fifteenth day, the three *yang* are full, corresponding to the *Qian* hexagram and the line of the third nine.

On the sixteenth day, the first *yin* arises, corresponding to the *Xun* hexagram. In terms of the pure *Qian* hexagram, this is the line of the fourth nine. The lower quarter is the *Gen* hexagram, called "not to exceed the proper time," meaning that in measuring the slightest weights, one must not go beyond. In terms of the pure *Qian* hexagram, this is the line of the fifth nine. From the twenty-third to the thirtieth day, it is the *Kun* hexagram. Thus, it is spoken of as *Kun* bearing *Qian*. Yet when referring to the sixth five, it is because all *yin* symbols take *Kun* as their master, hence the use of the sixth five. In the pure *Qian*, this is the line of the ninth nine, where *yang* has been entirely consumed and *yin* reaches its extreme before rebirth, thus concluding with the "use of nine."

**Chapter Forty-Seven**
Following the turning of the *xuanji*, ascending and descending, rising and falling. Circulating through the six lines, it is difficult to observe. Thus, it has no fixed position and serves as the ancestral foundation of the *Yi*. The *xuanji* is the instrument for correcting celestial patterns. When *yang* *qi* arises, it moves from below upward; when *yin* *qi* descends, it moves from above downward. Circulating through the six lines, they wax and wane within them, forming the sixty-four hexagrams, which cannot be reduced to rigid rules. This interplay of hardness and softness is why they are the ancestral foundation of the *Yi*.

**Chapter Forty-Eight**
At the dawn of the new moon, it is the *Fu* hexagram, where *yang* *qi* first flows through. Its entry and exit are without haste, and the erected gnomon reveals subtle strength. The *Huangzhong* pitch corresponds to the *zi* month, and its signs begin to flourish. Spreading warmth and softness, the common people receive their constant sustenance.

**Chapter Forty-Nine**
At the *Lin* hexagram’s furnace, the kindling is applied, opening the path to true radiance. The brilliance gradually advances, increasing day by day. The *Dalü* of the *chou* month binds and adjusts the balance.

**Chapter Fifty**
Looking upward, it forms the *Tai* hexagram, where hardness and softness flourish together. *Yin* and *yang* intertwine, the small departing and the great arriving. Converging at the *yin* month, it moves in accord with the seasons.

**Chapter Fifty-One**
Progressing through the *Dazhuang* hexagram, it flanks the gate of the *mao* month. Elm pods fall and return to their roots. Punishment and virtue bear one another, and day and night begin to divide.

**Chapter Fifty-Two**
In the *Guai* hexagram, *yin* has retreated, and *yang* advances forward. Washing and cleansing its wings, it shakes off the dust of slumber.

**Chapter Fifty-Three**
The *Qian* hexagram is vigorous and bright, broadly covering the four neighbors. *Yang* ends at the *si* month, where it interacts at the center.

**Chapter Fifty-Four**
The *Shen* hexagram begins the sequence, treading frost first. The cold spring at the well’s bottom, the *wu* month as the guest of the vine. The guest submits to *yin*, and *yin* becomes the host.

**Chapter Fifty-Five**
The *Lin* hexagram departs from its position, gathering its essence. Cherishing virtue and awaiting the time, its handle lingers in obscurity.

**Chapter Fifty-Six**
The *Pi* hexagram is blocked and impassable; what sprouts cannot grow. *Yin* extends while *yang* is subdued, and *yang*’s name is erased.

**Chapter Fifty-Seven**
In the *Guan* hexagram, observe its measures and weigh the conditions of mid-autumn. Nurturing the young and tender, the old and withered revive. Shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout anew, growing beneath the cover of what came before.

**Chapter Fifty-Eight**

**Chapter Fifty-Nine**
In the *Bo* hexagram, the limbs rot and the form dissolves. The transforming *qi* is exhausted, and the supreme spirit is lost.

**Chapter Sixty**
When the Dao reaches its limit, it turns back, returning to the origin of *Kun*. In *Heng*, it follows earth’s patterns, receiving heaven’s decree and spreading its mandate. This speaks of the twelfth month’s fire, which is the fire of the year. Only in the third, eighth, and twelfth months is fire not used—because fire is defeated in the third, dies in the eighth, and perishes in the twelfth. This is the principle in the five phases where metal’s birth fears fire’s death, so fire is extinguished in response.

**Chapter Sixty-One**
The profound and distant Dao, though veiled and partitioned, remains interconnected. It responds to measure and nurtures the seed, the origin of *yin* and *yang*. Vast and indistinct, its beginning is unknowable. Those who first stray from the crimson path later become lords. No level ground remains uninclined—such is the Dao’s nature. Change and renewal alternate, waxing and waning in mutual dependence. Ending with *Kun* and beginning with *Fu*, it cycles like an unbroken ring. Emperors and kings inherit and uphold it, its design enduring for a thousand generations. The profound and distant Dao, though veiled and partitioned, refers to *Kan* and *Li*, which are remote yet truly connected. "Responding to measure" denotes the phases within the waxing and waning crescents. "Nurturing the seed" is the origin of *yin* and *yang*. *Yin*’s origin begins in *Li*, while *yang*’s origin resides in *Kan*. "First straying" means *Li*’s *yin* does not take the lead; thus, the waxing crescent first nurtures *yang*’s origin, while *yin*’s nurturing occurs in the waning crescent. "Becoming lords" also reflects the male’s rightful place without and the female’s within.

**Chapter Sixty-Two**
To cultivate one’s nature and prolong life, deferring the appointed end, one must carefully consider the future and contemplate its origins. The body one receives is fundamentally formless. The primordial essence scatters like clouds, relying on *qi* to establish its beginning. "The future" refers to the matter of prolonging life and deferring the end. "Its origins" means the moment of conception, which begins from nothingness. Once the primordial essence disperses and *qi* establishes its foundation, the hundred bones and nine orifices are all complete. The method of returning the elixir is precisely based on this.

**Chapter Sixty-Three**
*Yin* and *yang* serve as measures, the dwelling of *hun* and *po*. The *yang* spirit is the sun’s *hun*; the *yin* spirit is the moon’s *po*. *Hun* and *po* mutually serve as each other’s abode. The nature presides within, establishing its form. The emotions operate without, constructing walls and outer defenses. When the defenses are complete, people and things find peace. At this time, emotions align with *Qian* and *Kun*. *Qian* moves directly, spreading *qi* and flowing essence. *Kun* is still and receptive, serving as the Dao’s dwelling. The firm acts and retreats; the yielding transforms and flourishes. Nine returns, seven reversals, eight reunions, six residences. The male is white, the female red—metal and fire restrain each other. Then water settles fire, the beginning of the five phases. Supreme goodness resembles water, clear and flawless. The Dao’s form is elusive; the true one is difficult to depict. Though transformed and dispersed, each abides in its own place. *Hun* and *po* mutually serve as each other’s abode. In terms of fire phases, the sun’s *hun* joins the moon’s *po*, embodying the principle of advance and retreat. In terms of *Kan* and *Li*, the essence and *qi* of *Kan*’s male cannot be nurtured without *Li*’s female womb to form the golden elixir. In terms of the body, the hundred bones, nine orifices, six bowels, and five viscera cannot endure without the *qi* of the five metals as their root. Thus, the fire, *qi*, and spirit that constitute the *hun* are ultimately bound to the corporeal, which is the *po*. Without *po*, the *hun* has no dwelling; without *hun*, the *po* becomes discarded matter. Therefore, what operates without serves the emotions and *po*, while what resides within serves the nature and *hun*. *Qian* moves directly, spreading *qi* and flowing essence, akin to male union. *Kun* is still and receptive, serving as the Dao’s dwelling, akin to the female womb. Thus, when the firm acts and retreats, the yielding transforms and flourishes even more. For those who cultivate the elixir, nine returns, seven reversals, eight reunions, and six residences follow the same principle. "Nine returns" refers to three thousand completed practices, totaling nine years, symbolizing the nine months of gestation. "Seven reversals" refers to lead, mercury, dragon, tiger, blood, *qi*, and spirit—all returning to the three fields. "Eight reunions" refers to eight hundred achievements: one ounce per month, ninety-six ounces per year, accumulating over nine years to eight hundred ounces, returning to the elixir field. "Six residences" refers to heaven and earth’s six children. In the first three years, the eldest son and daughter are nurtured in the lower field; in the middle three years, the middle son and daughter are nurtured in the middle field; in the final three years, the youngest son and daughter are nurtured in the upper field. The "male white" is the metal within *Kan*; the "female red" is the cinnabar within *Li*. "Water settles fire" refers to the earlier principle of stabilizing the furnace’s weights and measures. "Supreme goodness" is the *yin* within *Li*; from the Dao’s generation of the one, it becomes the *yang* within *Kan*. From the transformations of *Kan*’s *yang*, the five viscera, six bowels, hundred bones, and nine orifices all find their proper places.

**Chapter Sixty-Three (continued)**
It resembles a chicken’s egg, white and black conjoined. A span of one *cun* marks its beginning. The four limbs, five viscera, sinews, and bones are all complete. After ten months, it emerges from the womb. Its bones are soft and pliable; its flesh smooth as lead. This describes the process from conception to birth. A span of one *cun*: I once read in the *Classic of Difficult Issues* that the body’s own *cun* serves as a measure, corresponding to the standards of *sheng* and *dou*, where a square *cun* equals one *liang*. Thus, the beginning of human gestation also starts from this single *cun*.

**Chapter Sixty-Four**
Does the earlier mention of eight *liang* find its determination here?

**Chapter Sixty-Five**
The *yang* burning-mirror draws fire—without the sun, no light is born.
The square vessel of *fangzhu* cannot yield water or broth without stars or moon.
The two *qi*, dark and distant, still respond in mutual transformation.
How much more so for that which dwells near in the body, pressing close to heart and chest?
*Yin* and *yang* pair with moon and sun; water and fire serve as their proofs.
This speaks of *Kan* as the moon, within which lies water;
*Li* as the sun, within which lies fire.
What difference is there between this and the *yang* burning-mirror drawing fire or the *fangzhu* gathering water?

**Chapter Sixty-Six**
Ears, eyes, and mouth—the three treasures—
firmly sealed, do not let them scatter abroad.
The true person lurks in the deep abyss,
floating and wandering, abiding by the compass’s center.
Coiling and bending to see and hear,
opening and closing, all in perfect accord.
They serve as the pivot and linchpin of the self,
in movement and stillness, inexhaustible.
The *qi* of *Li* inwardly nourishes defense and guard;
*Kan* then ceases to rely on hearing.
*Dui* unites in silence,
rare speech follows the primal chaos.
Once these three are secured as the mechanism’s keys,
relax the body and dwell in an empty chamber.
Entrust the will to emptiness and nothingness,
taking absence of thought as the constant.
Proof is difficult to shift;
the mind, focused, does not stray.
In sleep, spirit embraces spirit;
in waking, one awaits the signs of presence or absence.
The countenance gradually grows moist,
the bones and joints ever more firm and strong.
Repel the host of *yin* perversities,
then establish the true *yang*.
Cultivate this without cease,
and the *qi* will drift like clouds and rain.
Gentle as spring’s moisture,
flowing like melting ice.
From the head, it streams down to the feet,
then ultimately ascends again.
Coming and going, it penetrates the boundless,
pervading the vessel’s interior.
Reversion is the Dao’s verification;
weakness is virtue’s handle.
Weed and hoe the long-accumulated filth,
so that the subtle is finely tuned and harmonious.
The turbid finds the path to clarity;
long darkness yields to radiance.
Reversion means the old man returns to youthful vigor,
the aged woman becomes a maiden—this is the Dao’s verification.
Weakness means that the humble are honored by others,
the lagging are placed first—thus it serves as virtue’s handle.
Filth refers to one’s own unvirtuous conduct.
The subtle refers to the Dao’s essence.
Turbidity and darkness refer to the Way of blending light and merging with the dust,
burying brilliance and smoothing away luster.
These all describe the cultivation of the Dao in the external.
From “pervading the vessel’s interior” onward,
all describe the cultivation of the Dao within.

The *Book of Changes* states: "Li corresponds to the eyes, Kan to the ears, Dui to the mouth." Each of these harbors its own spirit. It speaks of "firmly sealing" and "securing the barriers"—the eyes may indeed be closed, the mouth firmly shut, yet the ears must be covered with both hands. It further says: "Relax the body in an empty chamber." This means that during waking and sleeping, one should close the eyes, cover the ears, seal the mouth, and clench the teeth, so that within, one constantly hears the sound of wind and thunder, the fiery qi roaring ceaselessly—thus the spirit and qi naturally abide. In this way, yin evil is entirely repelled, and true yang establishes itself. Diligently practicing this, harmonious qi flows smoothly, and the cultivation within is thus achieved.

**Chapter Sixty-Six**
People favor petty arts,
unaware of the Dao’s depth.
They abandon the proper path for deviant shortcuts,
seeking speed yet finding no passage.
Like the blind refusing a staff,
or the deaf straining to hear gong and shang,
they plunge into water to catch pheasants and hares,
or climb mountains in search of dragons and fish.
They plant wheat hoping for millet,
or wield a compass to draw a square.
Exhausting their strength and spirit,
throughout the year they see no success.
To know the method of ingesting qi,
the matter is simple and not complex.

**Chapter Sixty-Seven**
Those in the world who delight in goodness
initially lack broad insight.
Upon learning some minor technique, they rejoice beyond measure,
believing none in the world could surpass them—
this is precisely how they deceive themselves.

The radiant pearl of the Great Yang
ever seeks to depart from man.

Swiftly obtaining the Golden Flower, it transforms in mutual succession.
Alchemized into white liquid, congealing to utmost firmness.
The Golden Flower first intones—within a brief interval,
dissolving and transmuting into water, its abundance like horse-teeth in ranks.

The Yang then advances to harmonize,
their natures and dispositions naturally aligned.
Yet the pressing Yin of the hour
confines and restrains, barring the gate.

The compassionate mother nurtures and rears,
the filial son repays her kindness.
The stern father issues commands,
instructing and admonishing his descendants.

The Five Phases contend for dominion,
each relying on the other to engender life.
Fire’s nature melts metal,
metal severs the flourishing wood.

The Three, the Five, and the One—
the utmost essence of Heaven and Earth.
This may be transmitted by oral instruction,
but is difficult to convey in writing.

The Great Yang is the head.
The Flowing Pearl is the fluid of the lungs.
The *Huangting Jing* speaks of the seven fluids surging through the central chamber—
the chamber refers to the space between the brows.

Only this one fluid
is easily lost from man,
for all revile it.

The Golden Flower is the fluid of the kidneys.
The lungs correspond to metal, the kidneys to water;
mother and child gather together,
their abundance likened to horse-teeth in ranks.

The Yang is the solar soul,
also called the nature.
The compassionate mother is Kun.
Kun is the abdomen, giving birth to the fluids of the five viscera—
thus the fluids of the five viscera nourish the body.

The stern father is Qian.
Qian is the head, requiring the fluids of the five viscera
to ascend to the Mud-Pill Palace before they can be alchemized into the Golden Elixir.

"Fire’s nature melts metal" refers to the fluid of the Li Palace,
which is drawn at the lower quarter—
the lower quarter resembles autumn,
its position in the west, the time when metal flourishes.

"Metal severs the flourishing wood" refers to the fluid of the Kan Palace,
which is flown at the upper quarter—
the upper quarter resembles spring,
its position in the east, the time when wood flourishes.

The Three are the heart, lungs, and liver.
The Five is the spleen.
The One is the kidneys.
To refine the Golden Elixir,
one must rely on these—
hence they are called the utmost essence of Heaven and Earth.

**Chapter Sixty-Eight**
At midnight, turn to the right;
at noon, revolve to the east.

At the boundary between Mao and You, host and guest assume their names.
The Dragon calls to the Tiger; the Tiger inhales the Dragon’s essence.
Each feeds upon the other, both coveting the advantage—
thus they interlock and swallow, chewing and devouring one another.

Mars guards the west; Venus traverses the heavens.
Where the killing qi descends, what can stand unshaken?
The wildcat and dog guard the mouse; crows and sparrows fear the crane.
Each attains its function—how dare they make a sound?

At midnight, Kan; at noon, Li—
turning right and moving eastward is counterflow.
This refers to the work of gathering the medicine and flying the golden radiance.

Kan resides in the north and below, thus desiring to turn right and ascend.
Li dwells in the south and above, thus desiring to move eastward and descend.
Mao is wood, the Dragon.
You is metal, the Tiger.
Though the names they govern differ, with one exhalation and one inhalation,
the two meet and join, restraining and subduing each other, unable to flee.

The west and Venus are both metal.
At first, metal departs the womb of midnight—
in the space of a single breath, Mars seizes its guard over metal,
and so metal follows Mars in traversing the heavens.
Once Venus has crossed the sky, it can again subdue the Azure Dragon—
thus in the sixty-eighth chapter it is said: "Fire’s nature melts metal; metal severs the flourishing wood."

Therefore, *The Scripture of the Yellow Court* states:
"Sunrise and sunset, moon’s breath stored—
those who attain this all restrain and subdue."
If not subdued, there will be sound.

Should one fail to grasp the principle, reckless speech avails nothing.
Exhausting the wealth of household and chamber, wives and children suffer hunger and poverty.
From ancient times to the present, countless millions have pursued this path—
yet few meet with success, and fewer still attain completion.
Seeking rare medicines far and wide, they stray ever farther from the Dao.
But should one truly encounter it, the thread of its beginning becomes clear.
Like kindred things shatter one another, so too are the ends and beginnings of all things measured.
The five phases align and each finds its proper union—this is the mutual resonance of kindred things.
The firing times of civil and martial, the ends and beginnings of things.

The five phases restrain one another, alternating as father and mother.
The mother contains the nourishing fluid; the father presides over scrutiny and union.
Essence congeals and form flows—metal and stone do not decay.
With careful focus and no leakage, one attains the completion of the Dao.
Erect a pole and the shadow appears; call into the valley and the echo resounds.
Is this not wondrous? The supreme image of heaven and earth.
Yet if one takes a mere inch of *Gelsemium* or an ounce of *Croton*, swallowing brings instant collapse, unable even to lift the head.
At such a moment, though Zhou Wen and Cao of divination, Confucius of hexagrams, Bian Que with his needles, or Wu Xian with his drums were present—
could they revive the fallen or restore them to swift motion?
When the five phases are made to restrain and subdue one another, they do not flee.
Not fleeing, they can then engender one another.
Thus, as surely as a pole casts a shadow or a valley returns an echo, the gathering of the five phases yields the elixir—this much is clear.

The maiden by the river’s edge—spirit-like, most divine.

The moment fire is obtained, it takes flight, leaving no trace of dust.
Ghosts conceal themselves, dragons hide away—none know where they abide.
Should one seek to master it, the Yellow Sprout serves as the root.
The maiden is the qi of the five flowers within *Li*.
The *Classic* often speaks of "closure"—
this is to prevent its scattering outward.
This is not the qi sought through breath.
Within this qi lies the True One’s water, for qi is the mother of water.
The Yellow Sprout is the transformation of the *Kan* metal.
These two, female and male, seek one another, yet cannot be grasped together.

---

Things devoid of yin and yang violate heaven and forsake the Origin.
When a hen hatches her own eggs, her chicks are incomplete.
Why is this so?
Union was not achieved, the Three and Five failed to merge, hardness and softness parted ways.
The essence of transformation is the natural work of heaven and earth—
as fire moves and flames rise, as water flows and moistens below.
No teacher guides them; such is their nature.
The origin governs all, and this order cannot be altered.
Observe the mating of female and male:
hardness and softness bind, inseparable.
When their rhythm aligns, no craft or control is needed to govern them.
As a boy is born curled forward, a girl lies supine—
they receive this from the womb, the breath of the primal beginning.
Not only at birth is this manifest;
even in death, they replicate it.
This is not taught by parents—
it is fixed at the moment of union, determined from the very start.
The boy born curled forward illustrates *Kan* as male, its lines gathered inward.
The *Yellow Court Classic* calls this "the posterior humbled."
The girl lying supine illustrates *Li* as female, its lines gathered upward.
The *Yellow Court Classic* calls this "the anterior raised."
Only thus is the meaning of union achieved, hence the later seven or eight chapters speak of "child south, noon north."

---

*Kan* male is the moon, *Li* female is the sun.
The sun bestows virtue, the moon unfurls its light.
The moon receives the sun’s transformation, its body unharmed.
When yang loses its bond, yin encroaches upon its brightness.
At new and full moons, eclipses press close, veiling and overwhelming one another.
Yang’s form wanes, yin’s encroachment brings calamity.
Male and female depend on each other, inhaling and exhaling to nurture.
Female and male intermingle, seeking their kind.
Bestowing virtue and unfurling light—this is how male and female depend on each other, seeking their kind.
Only when the sun’s spirit joins the moon’s essence—this is called "conducting fire."
At the cusp of new and full moons, the moon’s essence may sometimes eclipse the sun.
When the new moon dawns, one should apply subtle yang, lest yin’s qi overpower yang too severely, risking harm.

---

Metal transforms into water, water’s nature flows freely.
Fire transforms into earth, and water cannot move.
Thus the male acts outwardly, the female remains inwardly still.
If excess transgresses measure, the female restrains him.
The essence must bind the spirit, preventing wanton indulgence.
Neither cold nor heat, advancing and retreating in due time.
Each attains harmony, together they emit the proof of their union.

The male moves and acts outwardly, the female remains still and stores inwardly—this accords with the "Upper Virtue" and "Lower Virtue" in the twenty-second chapter.

---

Cinnabar is the essence of wood, and only when it meets metal do they unite.
Where metal and water converge, wood and fire take the lead.
These four merge in primordial chaos, arrayed as dragon and tiger.
The dragon, yang in nature, bears an odd number; the tiger, yin in nature, bears an even one.
The liver, green, is the father; the lungs, white, are the mother.
The kidneys, black, are the child; the spleen, yellow, is the ancestor.
The child marks the beginning of the Five Phases; the Three Substances form one household, all converging in *wu* and *ji*.
Cinnabar is the qi of the heart.
The liver belongs to wood and thus can generate fire.
Metal is the fluid of the lungs, ever united with the liver’s fluid.
Yet metal’s child is water, so it joins with wood;
its child is also fire, so it leads with fire.
The liver is the dragon, bearing the number three, father of fire.
The lungs are the tiger, bearing the number four, mother of water.
The kidneys are the child of metal; the spleen is the kidneys’ ancestor.
The Three Substances are: wood and fire as one, metal and water as two, earth as three.
One household refers to all that dwells within this body.
*Li* governs *ji*, *Kan* governs *wu*—the merit and fruition return to them.

---

Hard and soft arise in alternation, traversing their respective domains.
Dragon to the west, tiger to the east, establishing the weft at *mao* and *you*.
Punishment and virtue meet as one, rejoicing in their encounter.
Punishment presides over subjugation and killing; virtue presides over generation and ascent.
In the second month, the stolen *luo* star arrives at *mao*;
in the eighth month, wheat sprouts as Heaven’s *ju* star occupies *you*.
North at *zi*, south at *wu*—each serves as the other’s guiding principle.
The numbers one and nine end only to begin anew.
Embracing the primordial in *Xu* and *Wei*, they sow essence at *zi*.
East is *Zhen*, the liver, the dragon.
West is *Dui*, the lungs, the tiger.
South is *Li*, the heart.
North is *Kan*, the kidneys.
From the waxing half-moon to the fifteenth day, the metal of the *Kan* palace takes flight, moving from north to south;
from the sixteenth to the waning half-moon, the elixir of the *Li* palace is gathered, moving from south to north—hence "north at *zi*, south at *wu*."
Yet the dragon ever follows fire, the tiger ever follows water, so *Kan* and *Li* unite in marriage.
And metal and wood cannot be sundered, so the dragon couples with the tiger, the tiger with the dragon—thus "dragon to the west, tiger to the east."
In essence, the golden elixir centers on the metal of *Kan*, and in the end returns to embracing the primordial in *Xu* and *Wei*, sowing essence at *zi*.

By riverside islets, the turtledoves call to one another.

Fair and graceful is the noble maiden,
the gentleman’s fine mate.
The male does not dwell alone,
the female does not live in solitude.
The Dark Warrior—tortoise and serpent—coil and intertwine.
Thus do yin and yang make plain:
each must have the other.

Were two women to share a chamber,
though their beauty be as sisters,
and Su Qin send his eloquence,
Zhang Yi broker the match,
unleashing persuasive tongues,
deploying honeyed words,
pouring out their hearts to harmonize,
seeking union as husband and wife—
yet with hair worn thin and teeth decayed,
they would never truly know each other.

If herbs and minerals are not of the same kind,
their names and categories differ.
Their proportions misaligned,
their guiding principles lost—
though the Yellow Emperor tend the furnace,
the Great One hold the flame,
the Eight Lords refine and temper,
Huainan blend and harmonize,
erecting lofty altars,
steps of jade laid beneath,
offering unicorn jerky and phoenix-cured meats,
prostrating in long obeisance,
praying to the spirits,
pleading with the ghosts,
bathing in purity, fasting in reverence,
hoping for some sign—
it would be like mending a cauldron with glue,
or plastering a wound with porridge,
adding water to ice to dispel cold,
or using hot broth to quench heat:
the flying tortoise and dancing serpent
would only grow more erratic.

Since the opening of heaven and earth,
there has been yin and yang after sky and land;
there have been husband and wife after male and female;
there have been hun and po after sun and moon;
there have been qi and fluids after heart and kidneys.
The essential truth lies in the union of above and below,
the coupling of female and male—
only then does the principle of endless generation arise.
How could any single thing stand alone?

*Commentary on the Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, Volume Three
Anonymous Annotation

Only the unadorned translation follows:

---

Only the ancient sages and worthies embraced the Mysterious and held fast to the True. They ingested and refined the Nine Cauldrons, transforming their traces to conceal themselves in obscurity. They contained essence and nourished spirit, aligning their power with the Three Luminaries. Their fluids suffused the interstices of the skin, and their sinews and bones became firm. All perverse influences were dispelled, and the upright qi abided constantly. Through long accumulation, they altered their forms and became immortals.

Grieving for later generations who loved the Dao, they followed the winds of reputation and sketched ancient texts. They composed diagrams and writings to reveal the Way to posterity, exposing the branches while concealing the root. They entrusted their teachings to various minerals, veiling them beneath layers of texts. Scholars who obtained these works spent their lives turning the pages of their cases, sons inheriting their fathers’ pursuits, grandsons treading in their ancestors’ footsteps. Yet through generations of transmission, confusion deepened, and none gained true insight. Thus officials abandoned their posts, farmers neglected their plowing, merchants forsook their goods, and men of resolve fell into poverty.

I lament this deeply and have therefore compiled this text. Its words are concise and easy to ponder; its matters are few and not cumbersome. I have laid out its principles in order, verifying what can be observed. The weights are numbered, and the sequence follows accordingly. Thus I have composed these disordered verses, opening their gates and apertures. Let the wise examine and reflect, applying their minds to this inquiry.

The ancient sages ingested and refined the Nine Cauldrons, contained essence and nourished spirit, harmonizing their power with the Three Luminaries. Thus their fluids filled the interstices of the skin, their sinews and bones became firm, the upright qi abided constantly, and they attained immortality. Yet the writings they composed to instruct later generations, entrusted to various minerals, bore profound meanings that were hidden and difficult to fathom. Thus later scholars never gained true insight and could not find the gate by which to enter.

Now, the Master of Wei has composed this work so that all may know the measured weights of lead and mercury, the orderly sequence of fire times, and the unbroken cycle of practice. Let scholars examine and reflect all the more carefully.

**Chapter Seventy-Nine**

No image is greater than Heaven and Earth,
Yet the Mysterious Gorge spans ten thousand li.
The River Drum approaches the Star Marker,
And the people are all startled and alarmed.
The gnomon’s shadow advances and retreats recklessly,
And for nine years misfortune and calamity befall.
The August One gazes upon it,
And the king retreats to reform himself.
The passes and barriers rise and fall,
And harmful qi chases and flees.
The Jiang and Huai dry up,
Their waters flowing into the sea.
The female and male of Heaven and Earth
Pace between *zi* and *wu*.
*Yin* and *shen* are the ancestors of yin and yang,
Emerging and entering, completing the beginning and end.
Following the Dipper’s handle and the Celestial Pivot,
Grasping the balance to fix the primal order.

The Mysterious Gorge between Heaven and Earth is like the waters of the Yellow River descending from the heavens, flowing through the north. In the human body, it corresponds to the northern River Chariot, resembling the River Drum star beside the river. In the human body, this is the *kan* male. The Star Marker is the celestial region of the Northern Dipper. In the human body, it corresponds to the ascent from the northern River Chariot straight up to the Muddy Pellet. The "people" are likened to the interior of the body. When one seeks to fly the golden essence, the inner *zhen* must be stirred, hence the term "startled and alarmed."

As for the gnomon’s shadow advancing and retreating, *kan* is the moon, and the yang within *kan* is the moon’s gnomon shadow. "Advancing and retreating recklessly" means retreating without advancing, referring to reckless dissipation like water flowing wildly. Thus Yao suffered nine years of floods, and misfortune and calamity arose. The August One is the Perfected One of the Upper Clarity. Knowing the impossibility, the king must retreat and reform. The king is the spirit of the heart.

The way of closing the passes must not be careless. If they rise and fall without stability, perverse qi will seize the opportunity to harm. The Jiang and Huai are the waterways of the south. In the human body, they correspond to the yin within *li*, likened to the outflow from the Jade Pool. Their drying up occurs because their waters flow into the sea, unaware of the way of replenishing infusion.

The female and male of Heaven and Earth do not stray beyond the pacing between *zi* (*kan*) and *wu* (*li*). *Yin* is where fire is born and gathers, what the *Yi* calls "completing the end and beginning" in *gen*. *Shen* is where water is born and gathers, what the *Yi* calls "serving in *kun*" and "the work of *kun* in completing things." How can one fail to follow the Dipper’s pointer to determine its use?

**Chapter Eighty**

At Fengshan, the cauldron is heated to a boil,
while flames blaze fiercely below.
The White Tiger leads the chant at the fore,
and the Azure Fluid harmonizes behind.
The Vermilion Bird soars and plays,
its radiance scattering in five hues.
Yet it encounters the snare’s spread,
pressed down and unable to rise.
Its cries are mournful and bitter,
like an infant longing for its mother.
Overturned and cast into the scalding trap,
its feathers and plumage are crushed and broken.
Before the water-clock has passed its halfway mark,
fish-scale ripples surge in playful crests.
Five-colored images dazzle and gleam,
their transformations without fixed master.
The seething cauldron churns and races,
violently surging without cease.
Layer upon layer they pile and press,
like interlocking fangs of hounds.
Its form resembles midwinter ice,
with stalactites jutting in disarray.
Towering and tangled, they mingle and merge,
piled and propped in mutual support.

The cauldron is the vessel for heating; Fengshan is lightning.
The White Tiger is the fluid of the lungs.
The Azure Fluid is the liver, the Dragon.
The Vermilion Bird is the heart, exhaling the fivefold radiance of qi.
Thus it bears five hues and pertains to fire.
When fire is restrained by the water of *kan*,
it is like the Vermilion Bird caught in a net.
So fire can only cling to the Azure Fluid, its mother,
and remain within the cauldron.
The water-clock not yet past its halfway mark is the hour of *zi*.
At the onset of *zi*, a gentle fire is applied to refine it,
and so its waves rise like fish scales in playful crests.
That its days have no fixed master means the fire’s qi increases daily,
and thus its transformations are without settled pattern.
When it reaches its peak as martial fire, it surges violently.
Layered and heaped, like interlocking fangs of hounds,
like stalactites in disarray,
or tangled and propped in mutual support—
these describe the ceaseless progression before and after.

**Chapter Eighty-One**
When yin and yang attain their proper pairing...

When they abide in serene detachment and steadfast mutual embrace,
the Azure Dragon dwells in Chamber Six—
spring blossoms in the east, the Thunder trigram at *mao*.
The White Tiger resides in Encouragement Seven—
autumn’s awns in the west, the Lake trigram at *you*.
The Vermilion Bird rests in Spread Two—
true yang intermingles at the southern *wu*.
When these three come to pay homage together,
their household becomes a chorus of kinship.

At root there are but two substances,
yet in the end they become three and five.
When three and five unite with the One,
all gather and return to the Two Places.

Refine them according to the higher method,
and the days’ count likewise follows the beginning.
*Mao*, the Thunder trigram of the east, is where Chamber Lodge resides;
its season is spring, its things blossom, in man it is the liver, the Azure Dragon.
It is called Six because six is water’s perfect number—
this refers to the time after the waxing half-moon, the *Great Strength* hexagram at the *mao* position,
which is the water of the Flying Kan Palace.

*You*, the Lake trigram of the west, is where Encouragement Lodge resides;
its season is autumn, its things bear awns, in man it is the lung, the White Tiger.
It is called Seven because seven is fire’s perfect number—
this refers to the time within the waning half-moon, the *Contemplation* hexagram at the *you* position,
which is the fire drawn from the Li Palace.

*Wu* is the south, the domain of Spread Star.
It is called Two because earth’s two engenders fire.
Yang qi reaches its zenith here, the sun’s essence attains fullness,
and fire’s qi flourishes to its utmost—thus it is called true yang.

The Six is lead; the Seven is mercury; the Two is fire.
When these three constantly unite as one, the elixir is achieved.
Fire is an insubstantial thing, yet in truth it is the two substances of lead and mercury.
In the end, east’s three and south’s two make five;
west’s four and north’s one make five;
the central palace of spleen-earth is also five—thus they are called three fives.
All return to the cauldron and merge into one.
That all gather and return to the Two Places refers to the Mysterious Female and the Tail Gate.
The higher method means entering the cauldron.
To apply fire according to the days’ count requires even greater caution.

First white and then yellow,
red and black penetrate both inside and out.
This is called the First Cauldron,
its nourishment like a grain of millet.

It is the work of nature itself,
not some devious or false path.
As when mountain and marsh qi steam together,
giving rise to snow and turning into rain;
when mud dries it becomes dust,
when fire dies it transforms into earth.

Like the *nie* dye turning yellow,
becoming glue,
or yeast and *nie* fermenting into wine—
things of the same kind readily yield their effects,
while those of different natures resist skillful transformation.

This wondrous art alone
is precise and truthful, without deception.
Transmitted to countless generations hence,
its brilliance will be self-evident and verifiable,
shining like stars across the Milky Way—
once mastered, its patterns become clear,
and the myriad transformations will be visible.

The lungs belong to Metal, thus white;
the spleen to Earth, thus yellow.
The spleen’s fluid rises from the Yellow Wild,
while the lung’s fluid descends from the Central Void—
these two constantly meet and merge.
Red is the qi of the heart;
black is the qi of the kidneys.
These two also constantly serve as inner and outer,
and when all four gather in the Nine Palaces of Mud,
it forms the First Cauldron.

When the elixir grows to the size of a millet grain,
it enters the Cinnabar Field—
is this not the natural Dao of Heaven and Earth?
How can it not be like mountain and marsh qi communicating,
giving rise to clouds and bringing forth rain?
When fire blazes, mud dries and turns to dust;
when fire subsides, it returns to earth—
this is the initial stirring of yang’s spirit in *Zhen*,
which by the fifteenth day fully becomes *Kun*.
When *Kun* is joined with the Yin Talisman,
the cinnabar body is restored to its original state.

Coming and going, like leaves turning yellow,
or indigo becoming glue,
or *nie* transforming into wine—
all arise from their own nature,
not by some external force.

**Chapter Eighty-Three: Supplementing Omissions**

Those who expound on the *Cantong Qi* often do so loosely,
leaving fine details incomplete.
Here, omissions are filled and gaps sealed,
presenting the essentials in an orderly manner.
Though the intent cannot be entirely unified or the themes perfectly aligned,
the direction remains unerring.
Entitled *Five Mutual Resemblances*,
it fully encompasses the *Great Change*’s nature and essence.

The Five Phases mutually engage, each finding its match.
The ten stems begin with *jia*—Wood is born of three, so *jia* holds the number four;
*yi* corresponds to *ding*, the civil fire of two, while *bing* is the martial fire.
Yet *jia*’s transformations—like tanned leather or scattered hair—are too broad and vague.
Now, refining the profound and drawing connections,
this is further elucidated:

*Xin* and *geng* belong to Metal, born of four;
*ren* and *gui* belong to Water, born of one.
Thus, *ren* is true lead, *gui* true mercury, *yi* true mercury—
ending with *ren* and *gui*.
Heaven and *yi* hold the number three;
Earth gives birth to Fire, so *bing* and *ding* hold two;
Heaven gives birth to Earth, so *wu* and *ji* hold five;
Earth gives birth to Metal, so *geng* and *xin* hold four.
*Yi*, *ji*, *xin*, and *gui* are the yin stems,
while *xin* and *gui* hold one—these are the yang stems.
What is unseen is yin, manifesting within the Five Phases and the five viscera,
so the seven and four are matched with yin positions.
What is visible is yang, appearing outside the Five Phases and the five viscera,
so they are matched with yang stems.

*Yi* should be *chen* (沉), likely a scribal error.
The five viscera’s treasures are likened to seventy-two minerals—
this is the *Great Change*’s nature and essence,
as in the *Scripture of Dragon and Tiger*,
all spoken in terms of minerals.
Elsewhere, it speaks of the Five Metals,
all framed in terms of Metal.
Or it says the culmination lies in divine water,
all framed in terms of Water.
One moment it speaks of *bing* and *ding* in terms of Fire,
for the mercury of the *Li* Palace resides in *ren*,
as *ren* governs the *Li* Palace.
*Wu* and *ji* are discussed in terms of medicinal substances,
for *kan* governs *wu*, and *li* governs *ji*—
all are the sources from which medicinal substances arise.

The Yellow Emperor and Laozi’s investigation of furnace and fire matters all stems from a single path, each with its own authentic basis: the three Dao of Metal, Wood, and Fire all emerge from one route. The "three Dao" are as follows: Wood (three) and Fire (two) combine to form the number five—this is the first Dao; Metal (four) and Water (one) combine to form the number five—this is the second Dao; the spleen’s fluid pertains to Earth, making five—this is the third Dao. That they are said to "stem from one" means all return to the *niwan* (mud-pill palace).

---

Branches, stems, flowers, leaves—
fruits hang in abundance.
Yet all reside in the rootstock,
never losing their fundamental nature.
What is spoken with sincere heart
is examined and without error.

The five viscera are likened to a tree:
branches, stems, flowers, leaves, and fruits all arise from it.
Yet that these things exist as they do
depends precisely on the rootstock never losing its fundamental nature,
for it first nurtures them from within.
Thus, the *Bi Fa Ling* (Complete Methods and Commandments) desires first to cultivate the inner elixir,
and only afterward to refine flying gold essence for the outer elixir—this is the principle.

---

Like the mid-winter season,
bamboo and trees all wither and break.

Assisting the yang to expound for merchants and travelers,
the lord conceals himself deeply.
In accord with the season and its celestial signs,
he seals his mouth and refrains from speech.
The Dao of Heaven is vast and boundless,
the Great Mystery (*Tai Xuan*) defies form or description.
Empty and still, it cannot be perceived—
its very frame dissolves into nothingness.
Errors and missteps lose the thread of affairs,
words rebound to harm the speaker.
Distinguish and order these four images,
to enlighten those blind to what follows.

When the mid-winter season arrives,
the myriad things all return to root and restore their mandate,
thus branches and leaves wither and break.
Therefore, the lord, following the season’s signs, shuts the passes at the solstice,
and merchants and travelers do not journey.
Those who later fail to heed the direction
do so because they neglect this return and concealment.
Cultivators of the elixir must know to take the body as a tree,
the five viscera as its root,
and the treasures born of the five viscera as its flowers, leaves, and fruits.
When flowers and leaves have fallen away,
the lines (*yao*) gather and conceal them to manure the rootstock.
Thus, when tending the furnace, beyond fixing the weights and measures,
the remainder is gathered in—
as in the twenty-second chapter, where golden sand enters the five interiors,
dispersing like mist in wind and rain.

*Huiji* #30: A rustic from a secluded valley, a withered life.

One who clings to plainness and simplicity,
finds no joy in fleeting splendor.
Dwelling in remote obscurity,
he scorns profit and renown.
Holding fast to tranquility and detachment,
he seeks only peace and calm.
At ease in quiet seclusion,
he composes these writings.
He sings of the Great *Yi* of Master Shu,
the legacy of the Three Sages.
Examining its purport,
he finds all principles united in one thread.
The Three Sages’ legacy—
above, it is in Heaven;
below, it is in Earth;
between, it is in Man—
nothing is left unembraced.
Thus it is said: *The Yi* aligns with Heaven and Earth.
When sages and worthies rise to high station,
they use it to govern the state and pacify the world.
When they are confined to lowly estate,
they use it to order the household and cultivate the self.
Yet further, it emerges beyond the dust of the vulgar,
used to refine the nature,
or to prolong life—
never were these two Ways distinct.

---

The task lies in following principle,
to manifest and radiate the spirit.
When spiritual transformation flows unimpeded,
the Four Seas know peace.
Set forth as a calendar,
it may be followed for ten thousand generations.
Applied to governance,
its practice is never cumbersome.
Inwardly drawn to nurture the nature,
it accords with the naturalness of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi.
Those who hold virtue most deeply
return to the root and revert to the origin.
It lies near, within the heart,
not apart from one’s own body.
Embracing the One without abandonment—
thus may one endure forever.
Paired with dietary arts,
yin and yang are arrayed.
Yet cinnabar from Wudu is cast aside,
the Eight Stones discarded.
For the cultivator of the elixir,
if only he follows the constant norms of Heaven and Earth,
then the spirit will radiate without fail,
spiritual transformation flow unimpeded—
how could peace not prevail?
The School of Yin and Yang employs it as a calendar,
bestowing the seasons upon the people,
unchanged through the ages.
The Yellow Emperor and Laozi draw upon it to nurture the nature,
thus knowing the treasures of the self—
what is stored is most profound,
what is generated, inexhaustible.
When flowers, leaves, and fruits have ripened,
they symbolize the return to the root and reversion to the origin.
Acting in embrace of the One,
never once is it forsaken.
Further, they cause yin and yang to pair,
fulfilling the meaning of generation and completion.
If the cultivator of the elixir truly understands this,
what need has he for the Eight Stones of Wudu?

---

Discerning its use to perfect things,
the world holds it in esteem.

Arranged in threefold alignment, branches and stems intertwine.
Same in origin yet different in name, all emerge from a single gate.
Not merely stacked in parallel phrases—
this text’s harmony reveals its truth,
where even rough jade holds discernible beauty.
Were I to embellish with falsehoods,
I would only incur superfluous fault.
Thus I name it *The Kinship of the Three*,
offering but a glimpse of its essence.
Few in words yet vast in meaning,
descendants ought to uphold it.
Abandoning the times to flee harm,
one takes refuge in the hills and mountains,
roaming the boundless expanse,
dwelling among spirits as neighbors.
Transforming form to ascend as immortals,
merged in silence, soundless.
Once in a hundred generations, they descend,
soaring through the mortal realm.
Spreading wings of plumage,
they incline toward the southwest.
When yang meets calamity—
floods and droughts sever the wellspring—
twigs and leaves wither yellow,
losing their flourishing splendor.
Yet those of good fortune bear one another,
steadfast and serene, attaining long life.

What "completes things" refers to their ripened state, ready for use.
If the world could truly savor this,
clarity would dawn between heart and eye,
and I know they would treasure it as priceless,
unmoved even by what the world holds dear.

The "threefold alignment" is the Three-and-Five,
though their names differ, they reside within this body.
"From a single gate" means all are perfected from the Mud-Pill Palace.
Yet in cultivating this method,
one must also know the way to preserve the body and evade harm:
sometimes abandoning the era to depart,
relying on the power of hills and mountains;
sometimes roaming the vast beyond,
living beside spirits—all to escape the world.
Otherwise, one risks sudden misfortune like drought or flood,
where branches rot and leaves wither yellow,
losing their radiant glory.
For those who walk this path,
how could they not choose the fortunate to accompany them?

**Ode to the Crucible** (originally preceding the *Supplement*, now appended here)

Round as the Three-and-Five,
circumference one foot five inches,
hollow at the center five inches wide—
named the Great Unity Furnace,
round as heaven, square as earth,
shaped like a gourd.
Each division: one inch one *fen*,
thickness: one inch one *fen*.

Mouth four by eight.
Lips turned outward, folded to a circumference of three feet two inches,
the luminous heart spanning one foot across.
Two-inch lips.
A high tier encircling two inches in height.
Length: one foot two inches.
Including the body, total length: one foot two inches,
with eighty measures of water entering the crucible.
Thickness uniform: one inch one *fen*.
The belly aligned at three.
Body, belly, and base—straight through top, middle, and bottom alike.
Seated with warmth descending.
The crucible suspended in its chamber, not touching the ground.
Yin above.
Water enters.
Yang rushes downward.
Fire below.
Head and tail in martial alignment:
*Si* (yang) as tail, *Wu* (yin) as head, *Hai* as martial fire.
The middle refined:
*Si* and *Wu* mediate as civil fire.
Beginning at seventy, ending after three decades.
Two hundred and six, well-tempered and even.
Together completing the three hundred and sixty of the celestial cycle.
Yin fire white.
Great whiteness, the fire’s number—meeting yin metal, it finds use,
hence more white than red.
Yellow fang lead.
Lead is the mother of fangs.
Yellow fangs arise from lead.
Two sevens gather:
Azure Dragon in *Fang*,
White Tiger in *Xu*.
Assisting and aiding humanity.
Azure Dragon and White Tiger—each the qi of seven lodgings.
Nourishing the brain, stabilizing ascendant mystery.
At midnight’s center, divine water and Metal Mother nurture the true child of silver water,
warming and fostering the child-pearl.
Attaining peace and preservation.
Coming and going in play, never leaving the chamber.
Gradually growing great, nature and temperament pure.
The Crone and the Infant, nurtured by the Mother’s care, remain only within the crucible.
Returning to the One, restoring the original source.
Beginning with the Water Mother as the elixir’s foundation,
the Water Mother in turn gives birth to true mercury.
Cherish and revere as lord and minister.
After one full cycle, the toil is most arduous.

Guard it in secrecy, lest confusion and darkness arise.
The path is long, and again profound.
Should one attain this, they unite Heaven and Earth.
With the elixir’s touch, the hun and po are purified.
Attaining longevity, dwelling in the immortal village.
Those who delight in the Dao seek its root.
Examine the Five Phases, determine the precise measures.
Contemplate deeply—no need for discourse.
Conceal and preserve, do not transmit the text.

Ride the white crane, mount the dragon’s scales.
Roam the Great Void, pay homage to the Immortal Lords.
Inscribed in the celestial charts, styled as a Perfected One.

The crucible’s construction takes the middle inch of the left hand’s middle finger as its measure.
Yet the symbolic resonance of this vessel’s design remains imperfectly expounded—let it await the enlightened.
As for the fire times, it is said:
*Begin with seventy, end with three decades.*
This speaks only of a single month’s firing.
Master Wei’s intent, however, holds that from ten breaths to thirty breaths, none suffice as fire.
Thus, from the first day, forty breaths serve as the starting point;
the second day, fifty breaths;
the third day, sixty breaths—yet even this falls short.
Why? For the moon’s essence only begins to brighten on the third day,
a faint yang, so sixty breaths still cannot be called fire.
By the twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth days,
yin qi gradually waxes strong, and the breaths retreat from sixty to fifty, then to forty—hence *ending with three decades.*
*Beginning with seventy* refers to the fourth day, when seventy breaths are added in a single day before fire may truly be spoken of.
From the fourth day onward, ten breaths are added each day,
until the fifteenth day, when a total of one hundred eighty breaths have accrued.
Then, from the sixteenth day, the breaths retreat from one hundred eighty to the month’s end,
completing the count of two hundred sixty—thus *two hundred six.*
Combining seventy with the three decades to match the three hundred sixty of the celestial cycle—this is Master Wei’s intent.

Yang begins at *zi* as its head, ending at *si* as its tail;
yin begins at *wu* as its head, ending at *hai* as its tail.
The *martial* between head and tail lies between *si* and *wu*;
the *central* lies between *zi* and *hai.*
Yin is the *Li* palace.
The *Great White* speaks of the fluid within *Li.*
Yellow-sprout lead is the fluid within *Kan.*
The *two sevens* are the seven days specifically mentioned in the *Huangting Jing.*
From the evening of the eighth to the fifteenth is seven and a half days;
from the sixteenth to the noon of the twenty-third is also seven and a half days—
thus they are collectively referred to as seven days.

*Nourishing the brain* means replenishing the *mud-pill palace.*
*Stabilizing ascendant mystery* means ascending from the Northern River Chariot.
*Midnight* refers to the adept in cultivation.
*Never leaving the chamber* means all lies within one’s own body.
When the Three Fields gradually fill, it is called *completing the fire.*
*Returning to the One, restoring the original source* means achieving the golden elixir.
*One full cycle* is the three-altar fire times of a year.
One must guard and protect, fearing leakage and loss,
until nine cycles are complete—only then is great accomplishment attained.
Is the path not long indeed?

The *Book of Changes* takes *Qian* and *Kun* as its body,
*Kan* and *Li* as its movement;
beginning with *Zhen* and *Xun*,
ending with *Gen* and *Dui.*
Yet *Qian* and *Kun* encompass above and below.
The trigrams form three, symbolizing the Three Powers;
doubled to six, they accord with the Six Qi;
the lines numbered five, they embody the Five Phases;
measuring five with six, they clarify the cycles of return.
This is the meaning of *combining the Three Powers and doubling them.*

These ten days govern the progression of the twelve earthly branches.
The *Upper Canon* begins with *Qian* and *Kun*, ends with *Kan* and *Li*;
the *Lower Canon* begins with *Xian* and *Gan*, ends with *Jiji* and *Weiji.*
Divided into nine palaces, ordered by the inverted opposition of *Qian* and *Kun*’s two lines,
the sixty-four hexagrams’ lines all proceed from this.
*Kan* and *Li* are the central qi of yin and yang,
their sequence alternating between inversion and uprightness without change.
*Zhen, Gen, Xun,* and *Dui,* receiving qi in partiality,
their sequence reverses entirely in opposition.
All follow the principle of yin-yang circulation,
odd and even intermingling, void and solid seeking each other,
firm and yielding mutually propelling.
The revolutions of Heaven and Earth’s four seasons,
the circulation of blood and qi in the human body—
the unity of this principle is fully revealed here.

For things, birth gives rise to form,
form gives rise to proliferation,
proliferation gives rise to number.
*Proliferation* means spreading, extending.
The greatness of this expansion is numbered fifty,
thus the eight bones, nine orifices, five viscera, six bowels,
hands’ and feet’s digits, combined with the two kidneys,
total fifty.
The one not engaged in calculation is the position of the Great Ultimate.
As for divining with milfoil,
dividing into two symbolizes the Two Modes,
hanging one symbolizes the Three Powers,
counting by fours symbolizes the Four Seasons,
returning the remainders to the hand symbolizes intercalary months—
thus it is done twice before hanging.
The heavenly number is five, the odd—
all that is empty and moves: intent, qi, will, wisdom, intellect.
The earthly number is five, the even—
all that is solid and exists: the four limbs, the body.
The heavenly number twenty-five:
the nine orifices, five viscera, six bowels, five officials.
The earthly number thirty:
the digits of hands and feet, the twenty-eight bones, the two kidneys.
In all, fifty-five—
this is how transformations are accomplished and the spirits’ workings are enacted.
Gathering the primal chaos to form essence and qi,
exhaling and inhaling to harmonize yin and yang,
acting where there is no action—
only thus are transformations fulfilled.
Wisdom and foolishness arise from one nature;
good and evil stem from a single thought.
Where thought and consideration dwell,
consideration extends without limit—
this is how the spirits’ workings are enacted.
This is what is meant by *the Dao of one yin and one yang,*
and *the spirits’ unfathomability.*

Heaven and Earth are balanced.
The *Qian* hexagram’s counting rods number two hundred and sixteen—
this is the tally of sinews and vessels.
The *Kun* hexagram’s counting rods number one hundred and forty-four—
this is the tally of teeth and bone joints.
Together, three hundred and sixty—
combining the counts of major and minor sinews, vessels, and bone joints to form a single body,
just as three hundred and sixty days form a single year.
The Master spoke of “meeting the cycle,” yet there remains that which is not yet nurtured.
The celestial sphere measures three hundred sixty-five and a quarter degrees,
three hundred sixty-six days in all, fixing the four seasons to complete the year.
Now speaking of three hundred sixty is to leave six aside for measurement—
this follows the principle of the *Great Expansion*’s subtraction of five and one.
The Han Confucians, taking three hundred sixty days and three hundred eighty-four lines,
with twenty-four lines lacking position,
thus proposed the theory of “six days and seven parts.”
Further excluding the four cardinal hexagrams—*Kan*, *Li*, *Zhen*, and *Dui*—
they devised the system of twenty-four qi,
but this is scarcely a matter of reflection.
When the Master dispersed the two counting rods of *Qian* and *Kun* into three hundred sixty days,
the twelve lines of *Qian* and *Kun* no longer held their positions.
Yet all within the hexagrams are none other than *Qian* and *Kun*.
The sixty-six days, along with the waxing and waning of the moon,
yield six days—though called “fullness and conjunction,” they are left empty for use,
and cannot be excluded.
These twelve days correspond to the twelve lines.
Accumulated as intercalary months, their function knows no end.
This principle perpetually circulates within the six voids,
and only the six voids can set it in motion.
In sum, fifty-five is the number of the *Great Expansion*.
Yet only fifty are spoken of daily—
the true product of expansion, and only fifty exist.
For the operation of the five officials, having already given rise to the consideration of a single heart’s selfishness,
and setting aside what is unused,
the number forty-nine perfectly accords with the correctness of Heaven’s principle.
Thus, this body of ours is not human but Heaven.
Aligning the Heaven within our body with the Heaven above,
the shifts of qi and number are as one with Heaven.
In cultivating the self, one can exhaust the spirits and know transformation—
this is the flourishing of virtue.
In divination, fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse are all foreknown.
In governing the state and pacifying the world,
the three hundred sixty offices of the *Rites of Zhou* correspond to the days, forming the months—
there is nothing that cannot be ordered.
The Master’s four ways of the sage are all present herein.
As for the two *Yijing* texts’ fifty thousand one thousand five hundred twenty words,
they correspond to the number of all things—
that is, the hairs, down, pores, and orifices of our body.
And within them, the numbers of the ten thousand things of the world are complete.
The twelve earthly branches of a day sum a year’s *gen*—
four thousand five hundred twenty,
and the two texts’ words again correspond to this.
The *Zihua Zi* states:
Above, it divides and completes Heaven;
below, it unites and completes Earth.
Once divided, it is named the Center.
Division must unite with something—
it is named Harmony.
Center, Mystery, Harmony, and Unity—
the ten thousand things are transformed and born.
This is what is called “three threes and six sixes,”
the four movements that complete the *Changes*,
the eighteen changes that form a hexagram.
Eight hexagrams make a lesser completion;
drawing them out, extending them by analogy,
all the world’s capacities are exhausted.
Pushing and expanding them,
these are the numbers of Former Heaven.
Thus the Dao is made manifest through them,
and virtue and conduct are made spirit-like.
Can one respond to the world’s changes with them?
Can one assist the divine luminaries?
The numinous all derive from the numbers of Heaven One and Earth Two,
Heaven Three and Earth Four,
Heaven Five and Earth Six,
Heaven Seven and Earth Eight,
Heaven Nine and Earth Ten.
The *Hemp-Clad Master* spoke of “Heaven One generating Water,”
the qi of *Kan* gestating within *Qian* Metal—
these all describe the formation of images.
Only when Heaven One and Earth Six unite is Water formed;
*Qian* and *Kan* combine, and Water is completed in Metal—
these describe the formation of forms.
Though the generating and completing numbers of the Five Phases
may be recited even by children,
their meaning is such that even the old and strong do not grasp their import—
this is the intent of “accomplishing transformation and enacting the spirits’ workings.”
The *Hemp-Clad Master* understood this.
Thus the Master said:
“One who knows the Dao of transformation—
does he not know the spirits’ doings?”
And again:
“The *Changes* are without thought, without action,
still and unmoving,
yet responsive and penetrating all the world’s affairs.”
The sage uses this to purify the heart,
retiring and concealing it in secrecy.
Fortune and misfortune share the people’s breath;
the spirits know the future, knowledge conceals the past.
Such were the wise, perspicacious, and sagely of old—
divinely martial yet not slaying.
Thus it is said:
No image is greater than Heaven and Earth;
no transformation is greater than the four seasons.
No suspended image is more luminous than the sun and moon;
nothing is more exalted than nobility and wealth—
all are but extensions of this.
Thus it is said:
“Three Heavens and two Earths lean upon the numbers.”
Test this with the fingers of the hands and feet:
the joints of the fingers are two Earths and three Heavens;
the joints of the toes are three Heavens and two Earths.
The five digits of each hand and foot—
here again the number five is manifest.
The *Wenyan* of *Qian* states:
“The great person’s virtue accords with Heaven and Earth,
their brightness with the sun and moon,
their order with the four seasons,
their fortune and misfortune with the spirits.
Preceding Heaven, Heaven does not oppose them;
following Heaven, they comply with Heaven’s timing.
Heaven itself does not oppose them—
how much less so humans? How much less the spirits?”
In the *Dayou* hexagram, only the fifth line is yin—
this too embodies the meaning of leaving five aside.
And the top yang line of Heaven states:
“From Heaven comes protection—
auspicious, nothing not beneficial.”

Heaven and humanity are one; when spoken of together, they are the Dao. Thus it is said: The *Book of Changes* proceeds from *Qian* and *Kun* to *Kan* and *Li*, and from *Kan* and *Li* to *Zhen*, *Gen*, *Xun*, and *Dui*—here the forms of Heaven and Earth are complete, and the Dao of the *Changes* is made manifest. From Heaven and Earth come yin and yang; from yin and yang come essence and qi—thus human nature is perfected and our bodies established. Know then that the eight trigrams and nine palaces are none other than the eight members and nine orifices of our bodies, while the five movements and six qi are the five viscera and six bowels within us. In images, numbers, lines, and counting rods, not a single affair is without its essence, spirit, hun-soul, or po-soul; not a single thing is without a single qi circulating through yin and yang, opening and closing. Herein lies the great Dao of the *Book of Changes*.
