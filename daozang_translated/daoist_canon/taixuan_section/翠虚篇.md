**The Emerald Void Scroll**

**Title:** *The Emerald Void Scroll* (*Cuìxū Piān*). One fascicle. Composed by Chen Nan of the Southern Song. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, Great Mystery Section.

**Preface to *The Emerald Void Scroll***

I once read the poem Zhang Ziyang presented to the Master of White Deer Grotto, which said:
*"I hear you have known the medicine for many years—*
*Why not refine the mind and smelt mercury and lead?*
*Let not the lamp be snuffed out by the wind,*
*For the six paths of rebirth leave no room to blame Heaven."*

Upon reading this, I closed the scroll and struck my breast, sighing deeply: Ziyang’s words were meant for those who already knew the medicine—how much more so for those still benighted! Thus, day and night, I took the wind and lamp as my warning. For ten years, I pored over books of golden hoops and thorny trials; for another ten, I practiced the arts of golden lead and wooden mercury—yet it all tasted like chewing wax. Though I sought a path beyond birth and death, I fumbled like a fly at a window, unaware that the world had already passed me by.

Only upon reverently perusing *The Emerald Void Scroll* and listening to the profound discourses of lofty recluses did I begin to understand: what is gathered is called the *medicine*; what is refined is called the *fire*; what congeals is called the *elixir*; what is nurtured is called the *embryo*—yet in truth, they are one. The place of its arising is called the *river source*; the vessels hidden in mountains and seas are called the *altar, furnace, crucible, and hearth*. The nature it receives is given names like *mercury, lead, water, and fire*; the forms it takes are called *cinnabar, dark pearl*, and other titles. Yet from today’s perspective, it is but a single thing.

Indeed, the ancients dissected the true origin and distinguished the categories of *qi*, giving rise to teachings on gathering, uniting, forging, and bathing. Like the hexagrams of the *Yijing*, all emerge from *Qian*; like the stars and birds of the celestial sphere, all revolve around the Dipper. Through the subtleties of extraction and replenishment, discussions of weights and measures arise. But by observing the moon’s halos—black and white—and the tides of earth—ebbing and flowing—one may silently grasp the intent of seizing the hour within the day. With not even a hair’s breadth of error, why fear that the Golden Elder will not ride the dragon, or the Radiant Maiden will not mount the tiger?

The elixir’s head is knotted in an instant; the infant is born within ten months. Spirit congeals, *qi* gathers, and a body exists beyond the body. This is truly the swiftest path to immortal learning, the wondrous Way of transcending the world. Its essential, subtle, and concise words are all contained within *The Emerald Void Scroll*.

Respectfully inscribed by Wang Sicheng, the True Breath Master, who bows twice with reverence after burning incense.

**The Emerald Void Scroll**
Composed by Perfected Chen of the Muddy Pellet.

**The Purple Court Scripture**

The Celestial Sovereign of the Crimson Palace governs the firmament of Qian,
The Qian Dragon soars to the Nine-Flowered Heaven.
Within Heaven lies the wondrous, boundless Palace of the Limitless,
Where myriad scrolls point to the arcane chapters—
Each verse reveals the golden elixir’s intent,
A thousand phrases, ten thousand words, distilled into one.

Teach men only to seek mercury and lead,
Gather these two into the crucible and refine them.
At night, fire erupts from Kunlun Mountain,
Its flames cooling as the moon’s light turns cold.
Above the Winding River, the Golden Crow takes flight,
While Chang’e rejoices with the Dipper and Ox.

Refine them without pause for even a moment,
A single breath, vast and subtle, pierces the Three Passes.
The qi flows ceaselessly through the Three Passes,
A white meridian ascending to the Muddy Pellet.
Above the Muddy Pellet rests the Purple Gold Crucible,
Within it, a lump of purple gold—
Transformed into jade nectar, flowing into the mouth,
Fragrant, sweet, and refreshing upon the tongue’s tip.
Swallowed and absorbed into the five viscera,
The organs rejoice, the body at peace and hale.

When the Crimson Serpent and Azure Dragon unite,
Wind stills, waves calm, tiger and dragon coil.
The divine water brims, the Flowery Pond at rest,
White snow swirls, flying across the four mountains.
The Seven-Treasure Pavilion stands through the twelve hours,
Before it, golden blossoms bloom in profound splendor.

This is the essence of lead and mercury,
Transmuted into marrow, filling the gates’ source.
Seek only the Celestial Cycle within the body,
From the waxing crescent to the waning, and back again.
The medicine is balanced, the qi abundant,
As heaven and earth, sun and moon, converge in union.

The void shatters into a hundred fragments,
Chew the chaos soft as silk.
Turned and folded, it becomes a single coin,
The body suffused with jade’s luster and gold’s firmness.
Crimson blood is exchanged for white blood,
Golden light fills the chamber, dense and resplendent.
A pool of autumn water cradles the bright moon,
A golden blossom blooms like a crimson lotus.

Now the body’s spirit and qi are whole,
No need to seek the Dao or delve into Chan.
I now know your wisdom is thus,
That you are destined to become an immortal.
Clearly instructed without a second word,
Silently refine and withdraw, then replenish.

In a year, harvest the moon without waiting a year,
In a month, seize the sun without waiting a month,
In a day, grasp the hour as hours yield to days,
Within the hour, find the moment—profound and arcane.
Arcane beyond arcane, inexpressible in words,
Yet it lies in the new moon, full moon, dark moon, and crescent.
The Golden Elder and Radiant Maiden wrest creation,
Ghosts and spirits weep in astonishment and clamor.
Clouds disperse, rain scatters, all sounds stilled—
A single grain of the mysterious pearl sown in the Jade Field.
Ten months of fire, the sacred embryo becomes an immortal,
Nine revolutions, nine new moons, cycling in endless return.

At first, the meridians of the spine’s pass open,
Next, the bladder blazes like fire,
Within, the two kidneys simmer like boiling water,
Stirring to surge toward the heart’s source.
Heart and kidneys, water and fire, naturally unite,
Metal and wood, though separated, follow their course.
The Yellow Court’s qi dwells in the Central Palace,
The palace governs all phenomena, the heart holds sway.
The water’s source, clear as a jade mirror—
Who sets the river chariot sailing like a boat?
In an instant, flames soar, scorching the heavens,
The crow’s soul and hare’s spirit crumble to dust.

Thus, in silence, seek the true root,
A straight path leading to the numinous truth.
Clearly, essence is preserved by qi,
Gradually, qi accumulates to generate spirit.
This spirit is the essence of heaven and earth,
Pure yang, undying—the true person.
Knowing this, one should cultivate immortality,
And the only gate to immortality is the golden elixir.
The golden elixir has no second secret—
A single acre within the body is your homestead.
Saliva, mucus, essence, fluids, blood, and humors—
These seven yin substances, how can they be rectified?

Within Kan, it is not the kidneys but the numinous root,
At the pool’s bottom, the sun glows red as the Northern Horse gallops.
Seven returns, nine reversions—all in a moment,
All things in creation are thus born.
Only this true operation of Qian and Kun,
No need for empty striving or silent words.
Without thought, without念, the spirit grows dull—
How then can it congeal into the embryonic immortal?

The embryonic immortal is but the union of two,
And this union occurs in but an instant.
Do you yet know the return of the Great Yang?
It lies just before the Winter Solstice.
It is said when the golden essence descends,
With what is it restored?
The golden essence lies in the Kun Palace’s medicine,
Kun resides in the southwest, the river’s source.
The toad’s light shines all day upon the Western River—
This is the root of the medicine.

Exchange hours for days, moments for hours,
A single drop of sweet dew—named the Numinous Spring.
Swallowed, it surges into the heart, piercing the lung’s transport points,
Falling into the bladder to form the elixir.
The elixir’s head does not congeal in the bladder—
Though it originates there, it rests in the liver.
The liver, wood’s fluid, meets the golden essence,
Encountering earth, they unite to complete the Great Return.

Do not say this is the work of effort,
Lest such words cling to form.
Begin with form, end without form—
Refine essence into qi, qi returns to the root,
The root of qi congeals into spirit,
Only then is there non-doing and spiritual communion.

Like husband and wife in union,
A single drop of essence and blood forms the infant.
Their union is born of emotion, yet emotion,
Still brings forth a child in ten months—
How much more so when the cosmos lies within your grasp?

Within the body, the tiger’s roar and dragon’s song,
Though the dragon’s song is unseen,
Waves surge high, a thousand fathoms deep.
Though the tiger’s roar is unheard,
The night wind howls through ten thousand forests.

From the elixir’s coagulation onward,
Through the deepening of the fire’s refinement,
Until the tenth month, when frost descends,
Spirit and soul flee—who dares contend?
A year comprises twelve months,
Yet who dares bathe at Mao and You?
Thus, in the tenth month, enter the spirit chamber,
The golden crucible brimming, dragon essence overflowing.
The mechanism of binding clouds and seizing the moon—
With the secret received, what difficulty remains in cultivation?

If you truly bind the clouds upon the mountain,
And grasp the moon’s soul,
Nodding at these words, you know the ancients—
What worry remains that your body will not ascend?

Within the body’s shell, within the heart’s depths,
Lies a priceless treasure—
It can give life or bring death,
Feed the hungry or sate the full.
Seek its meaning, take its origin,
And wander carefree, joyous, without hunger or cold.

Such scenes and proofs of attainment
All unfold within a single day’s effort.
This effort seems idle,
The medicine is not distant, its gathering not difficult.

Who knows the fire’s glow, crimson as ten thousand fathoms,
Burning away the Three Corpses, the jade crucible grows cold?
The cinnabar field can birth purple mushrooms,
The Yellow Court may yield red coptis.

A single taste of red coptis banishes hunger forever,
One dose of purple mushrooms preserves a youthful face.
The body becomes wholly white as milk-flowers,
Golden sinews and jade bones never dim with age.

When merit is complete and the Way fulfilled, cranes arrive—
With one leap, you ascend to the clouds’ edge.

*Song of the Great Dao*
True yin and true yang are the true Dao,
Yet they lie before your eyes—why seek them afar?
Ordinary folk year after year refine the returning elixir,
Some see blue and yellow and claim it is fine.

The steadfast should aspire to uphold the method,
Not harm the spirit-mind but perceive the Dao.
Simply know how to seek the true Yellow Sprout,
And one who consumes it will never age.

The Yellow Sprout is not the same as worldly lead,
In vain do they labor, seeing no achievement.
Wasting time, their hair turns white in vain—
Where in this drifting world can they visit Red Pine?

The divine water of the Flower Pool is rare in the world,
Its transmission unknown to the vulgar.
They take worldly lead and mercury,
Mistaking them for the true, lost in confusion.

The Green Dragon pursues the Tiger, the Tiger follows the Dragon,
The Red Bird mates with a resonant clang.
Regulate the qi, move the fire, follow the Palace of Birds,
Cinnabar enters the belly, the body surges with vitality.

The profound mystery of the Five Phases is hard to grasp,
Dragon and Tiger lie hidden in Kan and Li.
Hundreds of methods for the returning elixir exist,
But the most wondrous requires the true Flower Pool.

Cinnabar’s position is not inherently red,
The four seasons array it in the southern abode.
The Flowing Pearl’s nature has no fixed dwelling—
If you know its origin, it is like autumn stone.

The sun’s essence and moon’s radiance are the two true qi,
Containing the embryo, nurturing the child, it is divine.
When the transformation nears its end, you will see it yourself,
Clearly becoming the dust on the bright window.

Do not rely on the lead-mercury of this world,
The golden elixir’s secret is unknown even to sages.
Do not take the lead and mercury of common folk,
Measuring years to move the fire, clinging to one another.

Heaven births two things from emptiness,
Now wife, now child, now husband.
The gate of three and five is the sun and moon,
Able to distinguish east and west, beginning and end.

Nurture the natural endowment of the utmost spirit,
The qi of harmony congeals to form the body.
Wealth and nobility come only from embracing the Five Colors,
Knowing that lead and mercury together form kinship.

Heaven and Earth do not shun each other,
Gathering primordial harmony within the cosmos.
For ten months, nurture the mother and child apart—
The wise never again circulate qi.

The mystery of dark and yellow is hard to discern,
The gate of lead and mercury is difficult to reveal.
If people do not grasp its source,
Examine the Five Phases closely to hear and see.

The infant’s obscurity is beyond comprehension,
In vain they labor their spirit, suffering needlessly.
Simply understand the sages’ words,
And you will clearly see the path to heaven.

Three and four dwell together in one chamber,
One and two are husband and wife in a pair.
They must rely on a good matchmaker to unite,
Then their friendship deepens in affection.

Floating and sinking, indistinct, hard to distinguish,
Those who awaken from the lost path spend years in vain.
To know when the numinous medicine will form,
The yang number must ultimately return to nine cycles.

Yin and yang’s obscurity is unknowable,
Green Dragon and White Tiger contend with each other.
By year’s end, they transform and devour one another,
The White Tiger restrains the Dragon, the Dragon gradually wanes.

Heaven is the father, Earth the mother,
The Vermilion Bird in the south, the Dark Warrior in the north.
As years pass, all become earth—
Where then can people seek Dragon and Tiger?

Three unite in principle as one clan,
Constantly moving the sun and moon to shine within.
Having met the Three Flowers and the golden jade liquid,
Nine cycles must conclude with ten months’ work.

The Green Dragon’s essence resides in the Eastern Palace,
Matched with Heaven and Earth in the Zhen position.
After the White Tiger appears from this,
How could the Flowing Pearl refuse to follow?

Dragon and Tiger refined, five cycles grow strong,
In the crucible, the fragrance of chrysanthemums gradually arises.
Now is the proper time for cultivation—
Do not let the years drift idly by.

To recognize cinnabar as the essence of wood,
Move it to the west to join with metal.
Where can ordinary people trace its signs?
In the indistinct, the Five Mysteries are obscure.

Those who awaken are like returning to their homeland,
Those lost on the path find it no easier than seeking a road.
Three operate together from one source—
Their original surname never left the ancestral clan.

One exists, one does not,
Metal Lord as wife, wood as husband.
The profound and distant cannot be measured—
How could the steadfast ever force their way?

Standing in the vastness of heaven, paired with earth’s yellow,
Male essence harmonizes in the same chamber.
The white liquid transforms according to the furnace’s measure—
Those who consume it find their hearts cool and bright.

Who determines the origin of metal and wood’s mutual harm?
The Five Phases reverse and connect of themselves.
In the world, the Yellow Dragon, yin fire, and white mercury—
Who can recognize the Yellow Sprout’s lead?

Worldly lead and mercury do not depend on each other,
The steadfast know they lie in Kan and Li.
The wise conceal them where others cannot see,
As Huainan’s secret refinement lies in the Flower Pool.

When the nine-cycle elixir nears completion as the year ends,
Open the crucible to see the medicine’s red blossoms.
Water and fire transform, all becoming earth—
Where then can people seek the Golden Elder?

The transmission of lead and mercury is rare in the world,
Cinnabar as substance, snow as its robe.
Dimly it dwells in your own home—
Day after day, you look yet do not know.

The returning elixir enters the mouth, the body grows light,
Able to dispel long illness and banish demons.
From this, greed and desire have nothing to cling to,
Transforming even the foolish from worldly passions.

Who awakens to the numinous elixir’s transcendence of the world?
The Three Flowers unite and befriend the Dragon.
Look at those who refined elixirs before and after—
How many thousands, even tens of thousands, have perished?

*Chant of Emerald Void at Luofu*
In the autumn of the eighth month, Jia Ding Ren Shen,
The Emerald Void Daoist was at Luofu.
Before my eyes, all things pass like water,
Where in heaven and earth is a single sandpiper?

I will shed my form and return to the Jade Tower,
Thus I impart the fire-tending secrets of the golden elixir,
Speaking them to Bai Yuchan of Qiong Mountain,
That he may deeply know the bones of creation.

Daoguang Chan Master Xue Zixian
Passed to me the *Returning to the Root and Restoring Life*,
Pointing out the two words, lead and mercury—
What is called the true mystery within the mystery.

All the toil comes down to ten months,
Gradually gathering, gradually congealing.
Now the spirit is communicated through white blood,
I already feel my four limbs free of cold and heat.

Later, I still went forth to seek masters,
Examining how many wild fox spirits I exposed—
Each and every one not the true One,
All mere side doors, not the authentic Way.

I fear you waste this youthful spring in vain,
So I recount it all from the beginning for you:
Unless it be the secret of the golden liquor and returning elixir,
There is no need to squander your spirit in vain.

Like the deluded who study "bedchamber arts,"
Their hearts ever clinging to lustful union,
Calling it "yin elixir" or "the method of controlling women,"
Pressing fingers between the brows to swallow qi,
Seizing others’ essence to replenish their own,
Clinging to the Three Peaks with perverse views—
The birth gate they call the "source of life,"
Nine shallow thrusts and one deep, repeated endlessly.
Xuanyuan, Pengzu, Lao Rongcheng,
Huanggu, Shouguang, Zhao Feiyan—
Their households have other paths to the heavens,
Practiced in wine shops and brothels.
Do not say you meet immortals among the flowers,
Only to trade a golden hairpin for a clay tile.
The root is already rotten, leaves but green in vain,
The qi-sea churns, death comes swift as an arrow.

Other side doors may still offer some ease and comfort:
Some practice "serving qi" as the Central Yellow,
Some "guarding the crown" as the Primordial Chaos,
Some "circulating qi" as the Precelestial,
Some "swallowing saliva" as the Numinous Spring.
Or they fixate on a point beside the spleen,
Insisting it is the root of breath;
Or take mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female,
Inhaling purity and exhaling turbidity as "returning and restoring."
Or silently supplicate the Highest Lord,
Eyes upturned to guard the Mud Pill.
With these, they visualize qi’s ascent and descent,
Calling it the "Spine’s Pass";
Or hold breath and swallow saliva,
Calling it the "Jade Liquor and Golden Liquor Elixir";
Or concentrate spirit below the navel,
Or fix thoughts between the brows.
Some circulate the mind along the spine,
Some press the tongue to the palate,
Hunch shoulders, crane necks, arch backs—
Calling it "direct entry to the Royal Capital Mountain."
Mouth as the "Flowery Pond," tongue as the dragon,
Calling it "numinous water flowing murmuringly."
These side-door methods of ease and comfort,
How can they hope to become celestial immortals?

Eighty swallows, nine held back, one swallowed,
Gathering qi to the navel as "embryonic breathing,"
Hands clutching prayer beads to count breaths,
Water clocks and earthen gnomons to mark time.
Or following the *Lingbao* secret methods,
Forcibly restraining the tailbone to swallow saliva;
Or studying the *Xishan Huizhen Ji*,
Facing the wall in silence all day.
Though people now learn to sit in meditation,
When has the moon ever illumined the cold pond’s jade?
Though they practice "embracing the One,"
When have they ever been like jade hidden in stone?

Some say the Great Dao is fundamentally non-action,
Dry wood, dead ash, solitary silence;
Some claim it is already manifest and complete,
Yet ask them—where is the illusory body obtained?
Others exhaust their forms gathering sun and moon,
Calling it "heavenly hun and earthly po";
Others ingest the Seven Luminaries through the night,
Calling it the "true bloodline of creation";
Others "fly golden essence from behind the elbow,"
Qi steaming, water dripping;
Others "contain the true qi of Taiyi,"
Hearts darkly serene, worthy and still.
Some circulate the flowing pearl in cycles,
Some in stillness visualize red tangerines—
Such are all methods for nurturing life,
Yet none can transform insubstantial into numinous essence.

The Dao’s essentials nurture the child within the void,
Within it lies the true and certain mark.
All rely on the wondrous heavenly mechanism’s simplicity,
Scattered through alchemical texts yet never revealed.
Pitiful are the foolish who cling to delusion,
Pointing at one another, sketching emptiness upon emptiness.
Such bizarre and deranged lot,
Sitting and swaying, trembling for hours,
Bending, stretching, prostrating in countless postures,
Weeping and wailing like children at play—
All because the square inch of their hearts has no master,
Qi scattered, spirit wild and flying.
A throng of vain thoughts clamoring in chorus,
Deceiving the common folk, beguiling the foolish.
They know not how to unite with the Dao’s truth,
Only to unite with demons in vain folly.

Once the heart stirs, qi follows,
Leaping, trembling, activating the spirit’s mechanism.
Some say this is "yang qi arriving,"
Some say it is "dragon and tiger battling,"
Some say the "river chariot welcomes a thousand times,"
Some say "water and fire rush in pursuit."
Watch as they sway the qi of the five viscera,
One day the brain drains, the spirit withers.
The ancestral immortals left elixir secrets,
Generating something from nothing as the elixir’s foundation—
When was there ever such ghostly and monstrous behavior?
All are the delusions of inferior scholars.

I have heard the sages and masters of former ages:
Within non-action, nothing is not done,
All arises from formlessness to generate true form,
No need for visualization or forced cultivation.
Therein lies the marvel, strange and wondrous—
Heart and kidney were never Kan and Li,
Liver, heart, spleen, lungs, kidneys, intestines, gallbladder,
Only old fences around empty houses.
Tears, saliva, essence, qi, blood, fluids,
Only aids to be used as stepping stones.
Spirit, hun, po, heart, intent, qi—
Observe them: they seem real, yet are not.

Why seek inner vision or mirror the form,
Or listen for numinous echoes, gaze into limpid pools?
Swallowing mist, drinking dew, ingesting primordial qi,
Their efforts prove futile, hearts and spirits weary.
Expounding on emptiness, tinkering with furnace fires,
Demanding written pledges, collecting gold and treasures.
Daring to equate frogwort with the vast ocean,
Claiming the Primordial Heavenly Worthy is none other than themselves.
Falsely assuming titles, feigning divine powers,
Pointing at ghosts and spirits to expound cause and effect.
Today and tomorrow, they file petitions,
Inner elixir, outer elixir—nothing is beyond them.
Deceiving the worthy, deluding the sages, obscuring the Three Luminaries,
They claim to see fortune and misfortune as clearly as a loom’s shuttle,
Summoning disciples to wander the market’s dust,
Drunk on wine, sated with virtue, forming gangs.

The Great Dao has always transcended names and forms,
True immortals are never adorned with flowers and grasses.
They teach others to take vows and labor diligently—
How is that better than your own diligent practice?
If one person is deluded, it may still be endured,
But delusion passed to delusion leads to old age in confusion.
These blind leading the blind,
Together they enter the maze—truly lamentable.
When fortune is exhausted and retribution arrives,
Offending heaven, there is no place for prayer.
The Three Origins and Nine Palaces record their transgressions,
Their hun and po seized, they endure the underworld’s trials.

The world delights in learning immortality,
Yet how many daily seek the profound mystery?
Each boasts of their own absurdities, competing in loftiness,
Neglecting the true and real as the ultimate truth.

The ancients’ wise words must be firmly remembered:
With skill refined and effort pure, speech communes with immortals.
Words that fail to connect reveal no true kinship,
And without sufficient work, nothing attains perfection.

In my own practice, after one year’s cultivation,
The six pulses stilled, and qi returned to its root.
A spiritual infant then dwelt in the cinnabar field,
Its form and visage mirroring my own.

Yet reflecting on those who study the Dao in this dusty world,
After three or nine years, they merely drift in vain.
Still wandering as cloud and water across the four seas,
Cold-eyed, I see who among them is truly worthy of transmission.

Seeking the Dao through incense at the stove, they remain in the lower ranks;
Examining right and wrong, one discerns the foolish from the wise.
Returning, I compose this *Song of Emerald Void*,
Radiant as the sun shining in the azure sky.
It sweeps away the petty arts of lesser learning,
Distinguishing the firing times and refining the elixir’s ingredients.
I take only the gold within water,
Gathering emptiness to forge the crucible of creation.
Urging the hundred pulses to return to their source,
When pulse and conception vessels halt, the elixir begins to coalesce.

At first, a withered tree clings to a cold cliff;
Two beasts meet like lightning in a flash.
From the central, true position, the mysterious pearl is born.
Waves calm, winds cease, clouds and rain disperse.
In half a moment, the elixir’s head appears—
Soft as a cotton ball, hard as iron.

At this time, the crimson phoenix of the south bleeds;
Its gathering requires precise timing.
Once obtained, all things become complete,
Returning to life and rooting in the true cavity.
Within lies a true paradise,
Where landscapes gleam and the moon shines bright.
Dragon chants, tiger roars, lead and mercury unite;
The golden sprout and white snow are clearly seen.
Whenever heaven and earth conjoin,
Seize the mechanism of yin and yang’s creation.

At *mao* and *you*, *jia* and *geng*, one must bathe;
At crescent, full, waning, and new moons, guard against danger.
Adjust the weight daily and hourly,
Withdrawing and adding as needed, all in tranquil harmony.
Within the twelve hours, only one moment matters—
Nine returns, seven reversions, these are the steps.
The work of warming and nurturing must be steadfast,
The *xun* wind ever blowing into the *kan* trigram.
In walking, sitting, sleeping, and eating, remain thus,
Lest the fire cool and the elixir’s power lag.
After a year, the celestial cycle excludes *mao* and *you*;
Nine revolutions of effort consume nine months.
By the tenth month, jade frost descends,
The sacred embryo perfects, and wind and thunder roar.

A year’s gestation births one child,
Who begets grandchildren, branching endlessly.
In this most wondrous transformation of thousands and millions,
How could it be lightly taught to others?

Forget form, still the heart, sever all "you" and "I";
In life and death, movement and stillness, distinguish host from guest.
Morning and evening, the elixir’s ingredients rise and sink;
Water and fire, hexagrams and talismans must be carefully managed.
True qi steams without cold or heat,
Pure yang flows without birth or death.

There is a path where mother and child part ways—
Its wonder lies in the Dipper’s tail and the Oxherd and Weaver maidens.
If you wish to prolong life and rescue the aged and infirm,
Cut off lust and abandon the side gates.
To permanently preserve this flowing form in the world,
You must circulate the fire and refine the spirit elixir.

The spirit elixir’s work takes three hundred days;
Seven dissolutions, seven moltings complete the great return.
Gathered, it forms a body; scattered, it becomes qi—
The same in heaven as it is among men.

Better to seek a master’s peaceful method
Than to perversely plunder essence and blood.
As the ancients said, "All under heaven returns to this"—
You must learn the non-action of the pure and still.

Bind the ten thousand acres of clouds to the green mountain,
Scoop the full moon from the azure pool.
The mysterious pass—a single aperture—none know it,
Yet this is the most wondrous *daogui* knife.

One night, I encountered Master Lü the Scholar,
Who possessed an elixir formula even more marvelous:
He took the great void as his crucible,
Seized the sun and moon as his ingredients.
Mountains, rivers, and the vast earth ignited with fierce fire,
Within which the ten thousand images birthed clouds and thunder.
The primordial chaos of old became the myriad things,
All conjoining in an instant to form the sacred embryo.
No gold or wood intervened,
No dragon or tiger divided south and north.
No inquiry into mother or child, female or male,
No distinction between husband and wife, black or white.
What man calls the Great Return Elixir?
Even the Supreme Lord Lao could not swallow it.

The Old Lord left it for the carefree wanderer,
Who, upon consuming it, ascends as an immortal to the Great Ultimate.
With a cup of primordial wine,
Feeding on this *daogui* to strengthen the countenance—
Though the seas may turn to mulberry fields,
In my Dao, a year in the pot has not yet passed.

I know your heart is firm as iron,
Thus I transmit these words secretly, mouth to mouth.
In the wondrous place, not half a phrase exists—
The immortal’s method is truly natural.

Hasten to begin, knit the embryo immortal,
And chant brightly as you return to Penglai’s heaven.

**On the Foundation of the Elixir Returning to the One**

The ancients said: "Attain the One, and all things are complete."
Ah!
How true!

This saying—
it is why I carve away the overgrowth of alchemical scriptures,
why I mark the pivotal essentials of the Purple Writ.
For this is the truth:
The One is the foundation of the Golden Elixir,
the origin of a thousand classics and ten thousand treatises,
the ancestor of a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes.

To speak concisely:
Heavenly soul and earthly spirit are but the essence of the sun and the radiance of the moon;
cinnabar lead and black mercury are but the essence of metal and the fluid of wood.
The crow and hare are the tortoise and serpent;
the horse and ox are the dragon and tiger.
Cinnabar and quicksilver form the bones of the yellow sprout and white snow;
cinnabar and autumn stone arise from white gold and black tin.

Distinguished as male and female, husband and wife,
embodied as metal, wood, water, and fire,
categorized as the azure, the dark, the slow, and the swift,
symbolized as Qian and Kun, Kan and Li—
whether called the River Chariot,
or the Yellow Ascension,
or spoken of as the fire-jujube and the exchange-pear,
or as golden sand and jade mercury—
or by names like Elder Ding and Yellow Matron,
or titles such as Infant Boy and Maiden Girl—
dissected into black and white,
divided into azure and yellow,
all this profusion,
in truth, is but the two words: yin and yang.
All are one thing.

Consider the Guarding-the-One Altar,
the Wu-Ji Gate,
the Mysterious Pass’s single aperture,
the Gate of the Mysterious Female,
the Divine Water and Flower Pool,
the lead furnace and earthen crucible,
the cinnabar tripod,
the recumbent moon furnace,
the Central Yellow Palace,
the Elixir Origin Mansion,
the Spirit Chamber and Qi Mansion,
the Pass Origin and Elixir Field,
the root of breath,
the site of coagulation—
these, too, are all one place.

Again, like the winter and summer solstices,
the spring and autumn equinoxes,
the Mao and You, Jia and Geng,
the crescent and full, the dark and new moons,
the Zi and Wu, Si and Hai, Yin and Shen,
the twenty-four qi,
the seventy-two seasonal markers,
the year’s conjunctions,
the month’s revolutions,
the Kan and Li moments,
the months of the hare and rooster,
the Qian and Xun caverns,
the gates of two and eight,
the morning *Tun* and evening *Meng*,
the day *Gou* and night *Fu*—
people, not knowing, believe one must strictly adhere to times and seasons,
calculate qi and measure markers,
dissect methods by the number,
weigh by the scruple and hexagram.
Thus they say: "Gaze at the earth-gnomon, watch the night’s water-clock"—
how grievously mistaken!

Do they not know that the year’s creation is but the essence and qi of the body’s cycle,
that day and night, hours and moments, are but the transformations of essence and qi?
Within them lie decline and flourishing,
rising and falling,
floating and sinking,
clarity and turbidity.
Thus the sages used external symbols to verify them,
unaware that the qi and numbers of heaven and earth lie in a single moment’s work.

Within this are the signs of yin and yang, cold and heat,
the states of generation and destruction, fullness and deficiency.
In the small, it follows the hundred divisions of the day;
in the large, it mirrors a year—
yet all occurs in a single moment.
That moment is one place;
one place is one thing.

If one knows that this is the One,
then gathering follows method,
circulation has measure,
weights and measures have standards,
water and fire have degrees,
and the wonders of withdrawal and addition, advance and retreat,
the mysteries of bathing and conjoining—
none lack caution against danger, vigilance against peril.
For the slightest error,
and the sun and moon lose their way,
gold and mercury part crucibles.
None but those deeply versed in creation’s workings
can fathom the meaning of yin and yang as profoundly secret as this.

"The Way is called the alternation of one yin and one yang"—
the Way is the Golden Elixir,
the Golden Elixir is this.

The ancient immortals and transcendent spirits,
the refined ones who refined the Seven Returns and Nine Cycles,
the Great Elixir of Golden Liquid—
these were but shortcuts to entering the Dao.
Thus there are sayings of a moment’s work naturally conjoining,
the return of wind blending all,
the hundred days’ achievement of efficacy.
Practiced for nine months, it is called the Nine Revolutions;
refined for a year, it is called the Sacred Embryo.

This is why it remains hidden, not revealed—
heaven’s secrets are cherished,
and this Dao is not lightly disclosed.
How could there be no fortune or misfortune in transmitting it to the worthy or unworthy?

Even saliva, nasal mucus, essence, fluids, qi, and blood are yin substances,
while Mud Pill Palace, Elixir Field, heart, kidneys, spleen, lungs,
tailgate, spine, mouth, and nose—
these are not truly one place.
How then can one know the separation of metal and wood,
the incompletion of water and fire?

If one can use the One to rectify the multitude of classics,
to examine the words of past sages,
not taking spirit and qi as naturally returning,
not taking meditation as naturally conjoining—
if one can discern thus,
perhaps one may unknowingly align with Sun and Hao,
yet still not hasten the hundred meridians to return to the source,
exhaust the nine passes to their depths,
where the three fires gather,
the eight waters converge.

As for spirit entering qi to form the fetal fire,
refining the medicine into the elixir—
how can this be easily understood?
Some say "spirit guards qi,"
some say "when spirit congeals, qi gathers,"
some say "spirit and qi naturally return"—
white-haired, they remain bewildered,
sighing in vain at emptiness.
How could they know the true wonder of the Elixir Foundation’s One?

Those who wander in floating spirits,
who bow to Hua Quan in the misty obscurity above—
attaining the One can complete the ten thousand.
Thus I write *On the Foundation of the Elixir Returning to the One*
and entrust it to the scholars, to White Jade Toad.

The teachings of Chen Niyuan of Yingchuan,
the Supreme Unity’s Knife and Round,
are transmitted to later ages.

**Water Melody Song**
*For Jiu Xiazi, Ju Jiushi*

Seize the wondrous celestial mechanism,
at midnight watch the stars blaze.
A droplet of pearly dew—
who guides it to the rice flower’s head?
Gather it now, in this moment,
like a green lotus closing its petals to concoct the medicine,
piercing the autumn of the Jade Pool.
As the ten thousand sounds stir the first wind,
a lone gull glides beneath the bright moon.

The Purple River Chariot,
riding the crimson phoenix,
enters the jade tower.
This is called jade mercury,
which, with lead and earth, perfectly aligns.
The five qi and three flowers gather at the crown,
stoked by the true fire of nature,
refined until it resembles the pomegranate’s red.
After ten months, the fetal immortal emerges,
borne away by thunder and lightning.

---

**Magpie Bridge Immortal**
*For Dianxuzi, Sha Daozhao*

The red lotus holds the medicine,
dew pearls congeal in azure,
falling drop by drop into the Flower Pool.

**Returning to the Golden Crucible, Calling Ding Gong,**
Refined until it resembles a single crimson tangerine.
The Three Flowers spew flame,
the Five Clouds embrace the moon,
above lies the golden womb’s divine chamber.
The bridal chamber’s clouds and rain stir with spring’s breeze—
after ten months, the fetal immortal is complete.

**True Pearl Curtain**
*For Hainanzi, Bai Yuchan*

The great elixir of golden cinnabar is within every person,
but it must be transmitted heart-to-mind, mouth-to-ear.
A slice of the White Dragon’s liver,
a cup of *tihu* wine—
seek only in the high where none exists, in the low where all abides,
shifting the Southern Aster to turn the Northern Dipper.
How laughable—
the Golden Elder and the Mystic Maiden,
the two locked in struggle.
A touch of lead and mercury blended just so,
observe the Han’s moon and the sea’s tide,
drawing and adding the fire’s measure.
An arrow piercing the Three Passes—
only then does the immortal’s hand reveal itself.
The hare arrives where the crow dwells,
the tortoise brother swallows the serpent whole.
Do you know?
Those two, Zhong and Lü,
are my teachers and friends.

**Verses on the Golden Elixir**

Half a catty of true mercury, half a catty of lead,
hidden in the numinous source before the Supreme Ultimate.
Seize the hour of *zi* to gather it,
refine it into golden liquid to enter the cinnabar field.
Divine talismans, white snow congealing into the mysterious pearl—
this is the golden elixir’s first furnace.
Through the twelve hours, recognize *zi* as the key,
lest the golden crucible’s mercury flowers wither.

Water and fire intertwine, tiger meets dragon,
the Golden Elder and the Mystic Maiden vie for mastery.
Green departs, white arrives, then turns to black—
only at red does it enter the Yellow Palace.
The jade crucible’s third revolution reveals the yellow sprout,
within fire, the red lotus unfurls its petals.
The adept lingers in the Crimson Palace, craving the night’s moon—
a cup of fine wine to nourish the cinnabar.

The fourth revolution of the red furnace turns the Four Spirits,
adding talismans, stoking the fire to nurture the fetal essence.
Dragon and tiger coil around the crucible, contending for creation,
the *xun* wind stirs the lamp upon the water.
The fifth revolution yields the White Horse’s sprout,
then the Six Bandits drive the River Chariot.
The Five Phases complete, thunder’s roar resounds—
now is the time to ascend the tower and gaze upon the mercury flowers.

Refined into jade liquid, the divine cinnabar elixir,
seizing and subduing the tortoise and serpent in an instant.
Here lies the moment of completion’s subtle work—
tend the jade crucible’s fire, let it not grow cold.

Heaven’s seven stars, earth’s seven treasures,
man’s seven apertures governed by the brain.
The sevenfold-returned numinous cinnabar consumes yin’s breath—
in the lead furnace, use only the gentlest fire.

The eighth revolution: divine brocade, Jade Clarity’s sand,
*mao* and *you* draw and add fire without error.
Thirst quenched by the Flower Pool, hunger sated by qi,
the Yellow Matron watches the golden flowers all day.
The ninth revolution: purple gold becomes the supreme treasure,
the Gate of Heaven and Door of Earth seal themselves.
Three hundred eighty-four *zhu*,
scattered into thirty-six thousand grains.

The Azure Youth holds the mirror to the Muddy Pellet,
auspicious clouds from the five viscera pierce the upper pass.
*Zi*, *wu*, *yin*, *shen*, *si*, and *hai*—
when the fetal orb’s count is full, it emerges from Kunlun.

Shift the Northern Dipper toward the Southern Aster,
pierce the Yellow Court to enter the Purple Court.
A year of drilling and clustering brings true creation—
the Great Yang shines directly at the moon’s third watch.

Above, it aligns with the stars; below, with lead.
The Great Yang paces thirty-six exchanges.
Without the dharma’s image, how could it be gathered?
Who speaks of birth before heaven and earth?

Yellow cinnabar, ceruse, litharge—
these are Jiazhou’s powers of creation.
If you have not witnessed the true Yang’s singular method,
how many in the world have ever known it?

The essence of red lead is called true mercury,
the essence of black mercury is true lead.
Seek not creation in the kidneys—
look instead within the heart for the primordial.

Numinous mercury is not mere quicksilver,
cinnabar’s lack of redness deludes most.
Who can recognize such true substances?
Those who do mount simurghs to shed the world’s dust.

Three true forms, one rare,
congealing into numinous marvels few understand.
Do not say dragon and tiger share a single source—
this is the immortal’s foundation laid.

The Star of Stability paired with the center,
reclining water’s union changes its hue to yellow.
Unlike common gold, silver, or iron,
its completion relies wholly on yin and yang.

Avoid graves, defiled fields,
and battle-scarred lands where men sleep.
When *kun*’s numinous qi takes form as fortune,
it becomes the seeker’s minor grotto-heaven.

Mountain forests’ quietude is most fitting,
whether in the world’s dust or the countryside.
When earth’s virtue is thick, the elixir grows thick—
reckless acts swiftly bring misfortune.

The chamber should face wood, toward the rising sun,
*dui*’s bright window facing the evening light.
Guard it well—let no one know its name,
and at dusk’s yin, do not seal the golden walls.

The Eight Gates’ transformations open in due time,
advancing and retreating with the metal’s decree.
Do not neglect the bright furnace or the hundred doors—
calmly, the two crucibles occupy the Three Terraces.

The six hundred verses rise and fall with clarity,
the Three Luminaries must follow the sun’s emptiness and fullness.
Shift the Eight Trigrams to clarify weight and measure,
align with the clepsydra’s flow—do not halt the process.

When yin’s fire ceases, yang’s fire dissolves,
principles divide externally, following Fu Xi’s lines.
Follow further the black and white of heaven’s edge-moon—
only after the six periods does the new moon meet the dark.

The four seasons’ revolutions follow the star-ladle,
day and night evenly divided into a hundred marks.
Reverently, the Primordial Sovereign reaffirms the pattern—
scrutinize the times, for they are clearly marked.

Heaven’s twelve hours are distinct,
yet mortals divide them into the elixir’s regimen.
If you claim the clepsydra lacks proof,
you will not grasp the mystery, and the medicine will not form.

The heart-earth empty and idle, severed from ten thousand threads,
best to return to stillness and observe the self.
To know the iron-spined man—
what worry is there in beginning the elixir’s work?

Those who speak do not know; those who know do not speak.
Lofty discourse and grand theories abound,
yet though none may argue now,
you may deceive yourself for a lifetime.

One who attains the Dao becomes like an infant,
unmoved by idle words, right or wrong.
If you cannot see with the heart’s eye,
who will you ask in regret later?

The obstinate cannot grasp the truth,
morning’s practice abandoned by dusk—this is not sincerity.
Only with a sincere heart and diligent refinement will results appear—
then you are among those who truly know.

Father’s essence, mother’s blood congeal to form the fetus,
yet its shape still resembles another’s.
Recognize the true father and mother within the body—
only then can you seize the Five Phases’ essence.

At the hour of *zi*, qi faces the *weilü* pass,
the spinal River Chariot pierces the crown’s gate.
A crystal pearl enters the crucible—
the Red Dragon holds mercury, ascending to the Muddy Pellet.

Qi enters the cinnabar field to nourish the white crow—
only then does the day yield the yellow sprout.
The Flower Pool’s divine water cradles the bright moon,
and the *daogui* obtained is as small as a sesame seed.

Know that medicine, refined by fire, becomes the elixir,
and the elixir, meeting fire, becomes immortal.
A moment’s effort yields immediate results,
yet mastery demands three years of ripening.

The Great Dao lies plain before your eyes,
yet people fail to grasp it and waste their return to the spring.
The yellow sprout is none other than the qi of heaven and earth,
while the divine water’s root is linked to mercury.

Once you recognize the source, there is no need to rush—
three threes unite as nine, forming pure yang.
Hidden transformations manifest as divine radiance,
and from here, you ascend near the Jade Emperor.

Unite heaven and earth, merge their primal essence,
mother and child meet in silent reverence.
First mercury, then lead—this is the Great Dao;
do not let the companionless crane return to heaven.

This treasure has long been passed down through the two eights,
in an auspicious year and month, it is placed in the furnace.
Ten days of fire-tending, knowing the seasons,
surely the sprout matures and mercury is perfected.

Silent intent, wordless principle—this is the truest path,
nothing else binds or relates.
Turn your gaze inward with but a trace of effort,
and once clarity dawns, all affairs grow still.

Red lead and black mercury form the foundation of the great elixir,
their union is rarely known in the world.
When these two become *wu* and *ji*,
the immortals call it a single *daogui*.

The sun’s crow and moon’s hare, two wheels full,
their root lies in precelestial essence—hard to grasp.
On a moonlit night, if you can gather them,
heaven’s soul and earth’s spirit congeal into the numinous elixir.

Do not dismiss the golden elixir as trivial—
you must labor diligently and delve deeply.
Seek guidance from teachers and mentors,
for it lies not elsewhere, but right before you.

Before refining the returning elixir, first cultivate lead;
the tortoise and snake, one qi, give birth to the precelestial.
Empty the heart, fill the belly—only then can harmony arise,
forging the numinous cinnabar into a single, perfect sphere.

Walking together, sitting together, sleeping side by side,
they follow you all day, ever present.
Recognize these swiftly and gather them in haste—
to see them is to find the lead of the watery realm.

Not lamp-light, sun, moon, nor stars,
the medicine’s spirit shines with extraordinary brightness.
With eyes half-closed, gaze long into the luminous place—
a resplendent pearl reveals its true nature.

To spend the day in seeming foolishness—what is there to gain or lose?
Stealthily apply effort amid idleness.
At first, jade liquid flies like drifting snow,
gradually, flowing gold fills the old hut.

Numinous mercury, attuned to the true, transforms endlessly—
it is best to preserve and guard, not to overstep.
The divine talisman silently courses through the three passes,
while lead follows the Yellow River into the Great Luo.

The *jia*-dragon and *geng*-tiger stand guard together,
only when lead and mercury share the furnace can work begin.
Recall the union of earth and heaven in harmonious balance—
naturally, *kan* and *li* unite in marriage.

The fire-tending of the celestial cycle spans the hidden and manifest,
its movements of withdrawal and addition occur in due time.
Why divide the qi-seasons into eight nodes?
Beware even a moment’s lapse or a hair’s breadth of error.

The Five Phases, Four Images, *kan* and *li*—
the poetic verses clearly explain them to you.
Yet where the work truly begins,
how many comprehend? How many know?

If you have not yet met a teacher, study these verses,
for within them lies the secret to cultivation.
Though you may not reach Penglai’s path,
you will at least gain leisure in life and delay death.

By day, circulate the numinous banner; by night, tend the fiery mushroom.
Withdraw and add with care, ever vigilant against danger.
Without like-minded companions to share and appreciate,
how can you gauge the furnace’s fire-tending?

The *zhen* trigram returns to the *dui* region in the west,
the three yangs and the maiden play with the bright cauldron.
The *xun* wind stirs the coral tree,
entering *gen* and returning to *kun*—another cycle begins.

Clench your fists, close your eyes, guard the flowing pearl—
this is the true path of entry.
As the *Wuzhen Pian* states:
when true gold builds the house, how can it ever wither?

Who knows the mechanism of short before and long after?
Within the twelve hours, only one moment matters.
Waxing and waning, full and new—advance and retreat,
refining through nine cycles to gestate the infant.

On Kunlun’s peak, fire stars fly,
when metal and wood meet at the *kan*-thunder hour.
When the medicine reaches the full moon, the scale must be full—
hurry to add fire, lest you miss the moment.

The great medicine relies on spirit, qi, and essence;
gathered in one place, they unite and form.
The elixir’s head is but precelestial qi,
refined into the yellow sprout, blooming as jade blossoms.

The truth lies plain in a single word,
yet in old age, the paths diverge in ease and difficulty.
First, awaken to the *daogui* in an instant,
then gradually refine the nine cycles of the great returning elixir.

Seize the two and place them in one furnace,
a pool of true water congeals into true butter.
Swallow the *daogui*’s savor, let it return to your belly,
nourishing the yellow sprout to yield the jade talisman.

Draw back the hundred vessels, return them to the source—
naturally, mercury will meet lead.
The mountains and rivers of the great earth are all treasures,
yet who knows to seek the precelestial within the body?

Within the palace, beneath the eyes, fire stars fly,
thunder and lightning churn, white snow hangs suspended.
Within the body, the sound of dripping is heard—
the three corpses’ essence and blood can sate hunger.

Seek the Five Phases and Four Images outside,
yet they reside within a single inch of your heart.
Master the interplay of yin and yang to perfect the wondrous Dao,
and even tiles and pebbles will turn to gold.

In the crescent-moon furnace, refine *kan* and *li*—
in a moment, a single *daogui* forms.
A message to the patriarch Zhang Ping Shu:
the ten thousand sages and thousand worthies all reside in the west.

When drunk and deeply asleep in dream,
a boat laden with treasure crosses Cao Creek.
Once you discern the foundation of the elixir,
its release and gathering lie entirely in your hands.

On the southwestern road, the moon’s radiance shines bright—
the great medicine arises from this place.
Recall an ancient verse:
above the winding river, the magpie bridge spans.

A month’s thirty days, a single day—
the method of elixir-refining rivals heaven’s work.
The union of two eights becomes the mother of the elixir,
while seeking dragons and tigers afar is but vain labor.

White and black thread the *weilü* to the cinnabar field,
a single true pearl, soft as silk.
Cold light fills the earth, birthing jade’s laughter,
while the two pools’ autumn waters ripple with red lotuses.

The crucible’s fire-tending is meticulously arranged,
refining until pure yang qi ascends.
When the earthly gate closes, the bones and body solidify;
gradually, the heavenly gate opens of its own accord.

Water is the numinous talisman, the harmonious fluid,
fire is the elixir’s pivot, the primordial essence.
When they meet in the palace’s congealing point,
the medicine naturally forms, and new life blooms.

A man’s pregnancy births the fetal immortal—
all because the toad’s light waxes full each night.
Seizing heaven’s mechanism, the true transformation,
within the body, the Jade Pure Heaven resides.

Within the crucible, vermilion tangerines glow crimson across the sky—
this is the ceaseless work of nurturing the fire.
Primal qi returns to the furnace, the spirit unscattered,
as spring mountains, spring waters, and spring winds arise of themselves.

First dry the golden crucible to quicken living mercury,
when the mercury is dried, the great elixir is complete.
Clearly there grows an herb of immortality,
transmuting iron to gold without deceiving man.

Tears, saliva, essence, fluids, qi, and blood—
true and false intermingle, requiring discernment.
From nothing comes something: these are the medicinal materials,
not to be confused with illusory, hollow things.

Scriptural transformations occur in an instant,
yet the deluded seek them in distant days and months.
Simply guard the fire-hexagram for three hundred moments,
and a luminous pearl is born in the night.

A celestial source flows straight from Kunlun,
nowhere more hidden than the Nine-Bend Bay.
A million jade dragons roar without cease,
as a river of spring moonlight chases the fishing boats.

When spirit and essence merge in the return to darkness,
bone and flesh fuse so subtly they go unnoticed.
The joints open and flow freely,
the countenance gleams, smooth as an infant’s.

Measurements must correspond to the two crescents,
this pattern of the law mirrors heaven’s abyss.
Turn and ask the Yellow Dame for guidance—
why wait for mere oral transmission?

Lead and mercury trace back to the roots of dragon and tiger,
the Mysterious Female’s gate is the door of wu and ji.
Only within the jade pot of spring’s hues
may one pluck a blossom to question Fu Xi and Xuan Yuan.

Near, it takes three mornings; far, ninety days—
know that transformations have their appointed hours.
Without understanding the elixir of long life’s creation,
even lazy mercury transmuting to gold stirs wonder.

The crucible holds no hidden medicine to seek,
what is sought and what emerges are the same gold.
Cast it large or small at will—
such is the profound principle of the ice-pure vessel.

Entering the crucible requires a weight of one jin,
yet when weighed, it becomes sixteen stars.
Each star holds true gold’s wonder within water,
combining to form flowing pearls in perfect balance.

The Kan Palace’s even pond, the stone-foot spring,
stars face one another, shooting toward the high heavens.
The murmuring yang pulse courses through green and white,
bathing the golden body to make it firm.

All say the Perfected One remains utterly silent—
how could he ever reveal it through words?
If not for arrogance, matters would require no speech,
it is only that the chest lacks mercury and lead.

When heaven and earth first parted, sun and moon rose high,
shaped like an egg, then like a peach.
Yin and yang’s true qi knows its seasons,
waiting three years to shed the armor of strife.

The dragon-tiger cinnabar’s meaning is most profound,
within the five-spirit gold, mercury and lead flow.
After a thousand mornings, it turns purple and soars into the clouds,
ascending straight to the Great Canopy Heaven.

To use lead, one must blend it with mercury,
the two families become kin as the woman sings.
When refined to the point the Purple River Chariot stirs the earth,
white clouds accompany the passing crane.

Red and black unite as wife weds husband,
once a year entering the elixir’s pivot.
In the bridal chamber’s depths, true cloud and rain—
a child is born, just like them.

The Kan man and Qian woman dwell in heaven’s domain,
buying medicine and firing the elixir costs no coin.
Within the crescent moon furnace, the work of creation is brewed—
a bit of wondrous medicine requires true lead.

What strange thing provokes laughter time and again?
Now even men can conceive.
Their own essence and blood intermingle,
within the body, husband and wife are wondrous indeed.

Three families contain the union of two things,
the red dragon flies up to the azure clouds.
At night, sweet dew passes through the empty sky,
a sliver of moon hangs above the Magpie Bridge.

Returning to the union, cultivate the water-fire school,
the rabbit and crow bathe in the inner elixir’s red glow.
After sixty-six circuits of the celestial orbit and the cold furnace,
the ten-month fetus matures, revealing sacred power.

Water and fire share essence between wood and metal,
but where does one seek fire and wood?
Shedding yellow to don purple—why?
Only because the River Chariot’s revolutions run deep.

The jade talisman and golden liquid refine the celestial immortal,
moonlight illuminates Kunlun’s lotus pool.
Pointing to the northern Dark Warrior’s affair—
why do tortoise and snake entwine?

Rain washes the new bamboo as twin phoenixes take flight,
beneath the jade mushroom, a sacred tortoise.
Holding the zither, it plays the dance of immortal melodies,
then releases Chang’e to feast by the small pool.

Golden light suffuses the body, the marrow fragrant,
golden sinews and jade bones are wholly yang.
Refined until red and white flow as white,
yin qi dissolves, and the body is naturally sound.

Once the work is done with utmost sincerity,
concentrate the spirit, gather the qi, and secure true essence.
The complexion becomes jade-like, hunger and thirst vanish—
only then does the golden elixir’s momentary formation appear.

The Green Maiden stands alone in the crystal palace,
her graceful form brimming with intent.
At midnight, the Yellow Dame comes knocking at the door,
to act as matchmaker, marrying her to the Golden Elder.

The Great One’s mysterious pearl, the golden liquid elixir,
returns to the origin, restores the root, and preserves youthful countenance.
One must personally heed the enlightened master’s words,
only then may you be shown the way.

At night, a single emerald lotus leaf appears,
within it, red pellets drip like pearls.
Dripping into the Flowery Pond, it becomes spirit water,
congealing in the cinnabar field to form the elixir’s pivot.

High and Kan are called the essences of water and fire,
originally formed from Qian and Kun’s two trigrams.
Simply take Kan’s essence to infuse the high cavity—
pure Qian can then grasp the flying jasper.
