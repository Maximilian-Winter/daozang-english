**Preface to *The Profound Secrets of the Su Wen’s System of Qi Dynamics***

Composed by Liu Wenshu, Gentleman for Court Audiences and Director of the Imperial Medical Academy

Medical texts are the classics of the Three August Ones. Fu Xi observed the celestial patterns and created the calendrical arts; Shen Nong tasted the hundred herbs and systematized *materia medica*; the Yellow Emperor discoursed on illness and suffering, completing the *Su Wen*. From this, we know the Dao’s profound mysteries are not easily fathomed. Without devoted and painstaking study, how could one grasp their subtle workings?

Moreover, the inquiries into qi dynamics are most essential for supplementation and drainage. Though the exchanges between the Yellow Emperor and Qi Bo, as well as Gui Yuqu, are fully recorded—with chapters divided and arranged—there remains no method of entry, making application somewhat difficult. My nature is narrow and my knowledge shallow, yet I privately admire the true teachings. My heart dwells in the sacred canon, and though years have passed, even amid the dust and toil of official duties, I have never once set it aside. I have gathered these writings with my brush, filling scrolls over time, exhaustively tracing their sources, appending explanations, resolving doubts, and dividing them into diagrams.

I have distilled the secret texts of the ancient qi dynamics and condensed the profound discourses on yin and yang in this book, arranging them as a net is held by its ropes or pearls strung on a thread—clear and luminous, with annotations clarifying the profound meanings. All have their proper place. I have not embellished the language, hoping only to make it more accessible, so that readers may, at a glance, suddenly comprehend the wondrous Dao—more than half the journey will then be complete.

I dare not seek fame; rather, I fear the errors in medicine that mislead people, cutting short their long lives and bringing calamity.

Written on the full moon of the twelfth month, *dingchou*, in the year *jimao* of the Yuanyou era.

**1. On the Generation, Destruction, Sequence, and Reversal of the Five Phases**

The principles of the Five Phases’ mutual generation and mutual overcoming are manifestly clear. The Ten Heavenly Stems, Twelve Earthly Branches, Five Qi Dynamics, Six Climatic Qi, years, months, days, and hours—all arise from these and interact in their functions.

In Heaven, they become qi: cold, heat, dryness, dampness, and wind.
On Earth, they take form: Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Soil.
Form and qi interact, giving rise to the myriad things—this is the great pattern of creation and transformation. Tracing their wondrous functions, one may call them infinite.

Wood governs the East and corresponds to spring.
The word *wood* (*mu*) signifies *touching* (*chu*) and *covering* (*mao*). Yang qi stirs and touches, covering the earth to generate life. Water flows eastward to give rise to Wood. Wood rises above and spreads below—such is its natural quality.

Fire governs the South and corresponds to summer.
The word *fire* (*huo*) signifies *transformation* (*hua*) and *destruction* (*hui*). Yang is above, yin below; suddenly flourishing, it transforms the myriad things. Fire is produced by drilling wood, deriving from what Wood generates. Yet Fire has no fixed form; its body is fundamentally Wood. It emerges to respond to things, exhausts itself, and returns—such is the natural principle.

Metal governs the West and corresponds to autumn.
The word *metal* (*jin*) signifies *restriction* (*jin*). Yin qi begins to restrict the myriad things, causing them to gather and contract. Gold is sifted from sand—it is born of Soil. Born of Soil yet distinct from it—such is its natural form.

Water governs the North and corresponds to winter.
The word *water* (*shui*) signifies *moistening* (*run*). Yin qi moistens and nourishes the myriad things. Water flows from west to east, generated by Metal. Water meanders, following the downward path to reach its destination—such is its natural nature.

Soil governs the Center and shares the position of the Southwest, corresponding to late summer.
The word *soil* (*tu*) signifies *spitting* (*tu*). It contains and spits forth the myriad things: what is to be born emerges, what is to die returns. It is the home of the myriad things, thus it flourishes at summer’s end, generated by Fire. If Soil overcomes Water, Water then retaliates—such is the natural principle.

As for their mutual overcoming: the child can always avenge the mother.
Wood overcomes Soil; Soil’s child, Metal, retaliates by overcoming Wood. Wood’s child, Fire, retaliates by overcoming Metal. Metal’s child, Water, retaliates by overcoming Fire. Fire’s child, Soil, retaliates by overcoming Water. Water’s child, Wood, retaliates by overcoming Soil.

Mutual generation is their beginning;
mutual overcoming is their end.
All emerge from Heaven’s nature.

The strong may be attacked: Soil, when met with Wood, becomes unobstructed.
The replete may overcome the deficient: Water, when met with Soil, is cut off.
Yin may dissolve yang: Fire, when met with Water, is extinguished.
The fierce may be matched by the hard: Metal, when met with Fire, is damaged.
The hard may restrain the soft: Wood, when met with Metal, is felled.

Thus, the Five flow and revolve in turn. In sequence, they generate one another; in reversal, they overcome one another. In this way, each serves its function to fulfill the Dao.

**2. On the Ten Heavenly Stems**

Heaven begins with the Stem *jia*; Earth begins with the Branch *zi*—this is how the sages investigated the relative weight and lightness of yin and yang. They assigned names to manifest their virtues and established designations to signify their affairs. Thus, *zi* and *jia* combine to complete the cycle.

From afar, one may step through the years, encompassing sixty in total.
From near, one may reckon the days, illuminating the twelve hours.
The waxing and waning of the yearly qi dynamics, the early or late arrival of the climatic qi, the life and death of the myriad things—comparing past and present, all may be known. Yet this is not all.

One may examine the subtle to foresee a person’s yet-unmanifested fortune or misfortune, clarify its application to discern the life or death of an illness—then the profound and minute meanings may be called truly great.

Thus:
The East: *jia* and *yi*—Wood’s position, enacting spring’s mandate.
*Jia* is yang within, yet yin still envelops it; grasses and trees begin to split their shells and emerge.
*Yi* is yang past the midpoint, yet has not attained the proper direction, still bent and constrained. It is also said that *yi* (*zhe*) means *to pull out* (*zhe*): the myriad things all shed their shells, drawing themselves out.

The South: *bing* and *ding*—Fire’s position.
The West: *geng* and *xin*—Metal’s position.
The North: *ren* and *gui*—Water’s position.
The Center: *wu* and *ji*—Soil’s position.

The South: *bing* and *ding*—Fire’s position, enacting summer’s mandate.
*Bing* is yang above and yin below, yin within and yang without. *Ding*’s yang is strong, just able to contend with yin’s qi. It is also said that *bing* (*bing*) means *bright* (*bing*): the myriad things all shine forth, manifest and vigorous.

The Center: *wu* and *ji*—Soil’s position, circulating through the four seasons.
*Wu* is yang soil: the myriad things are born and emerge from it, and when felled, return to it. *Ji* is yin soil: it achieves without action. It is also said that *wu* (*mao*) means *luxuriant* (*mao*), and *ji* (*qi*), *to rise* (*qi*). As soil governs the end of each season, the myriad things, having shed their blossoms, press down and rise again.

The West: *geng* and *xin*—Metal’s position, enacting autumn’s mandate.
*Geng* is the yin stem, where yang renews and continues. *Xin* has yang below and yin above, the yin stem where yang reaches its extreme. *Geng* means *to renew* (*geng*), and *xin*, *new* (*xin*). Both *geng* and *xin* are metal, and metal’s flavor is pungent—only after things mature do they acquire flavor. It is also said that the myriad things, solemn and ordered, renew their luxuriance and bear new fruit.

The North: *ren* and *gui*—Water’s position, enacting winter’s mandate.
*Ren* is yang, having received the embryo, where yin nurtures it—thus the position where yang is born. *Ren* as *embryo* shares the same meaning as *zi*. *Gui* means *to measure* (*kui*): when Heaven’s mandate reaches this point, the myriad things close and store. They conceive within, and in measured concealment, the sprouts begin—such is the Dao of Heaven, whence the day’s name. Thus the classic states: “Heaven has ten days, and when the six are exhausted, the cycle of *jia* completes.” This is the numbering of Heaven and Earth. Therefore, *jia*, *bing*, *wu*, *geng*, and *ren* are yang; *yi*, *ding*, *ji*, *xin*, and *gui* are yin. Each of the Five Phases pairs one yin and one yang, hence the ten days.

**Diagram of the Twelve Branches**
**Discourse on the Twelve Branches, Third**

Pure yang forms Heaven, and with the Five Phases manifest, the ten stems are established. Turbid yin forms Earth, and with the eight directions fixed, the twelve branches are divided. As qi shifts and the seasons turn, year by year, fullness and emptiness follow their cycles. Rising and descending, every thing’s transformations may be foretold. Thus, the pairing of stems and branches together attains wondrous use.

*Zi* is the North’s utmost yin, the position of cold water, where the first yang begins to germinate. Thus, when yin reaches its extreme, yang is born. *Ren* as *embryo* and *zi* as *child* mark the eleventh month’s celestial time.

By *chou*, yin still holds fast and binds it. *Chou* is yin, meaning *to assist* (*chou*): at the juncture of the twelfth month’s end and beginning, it takes *binding* as its name.

*Yin* is the first month, when yang has risen above and yin settled below—the time when people first perceive it. Thus, the pitch pipes’ flying ashes are observed to await its arrival, marking the beginning of affairs. *Yin* also means *to extend* (*yan*) and *moisture* (*jin*), the pathways of things.

*Mao* is the time of the sun’s ascent. *Mao* also means *luxuriant* (*mao*), for in the second month, yang qi flourishes and all things burgeon.

*Chen* is when yang has passed its midpoint, the third month’s time, when all things quake and grow. *Chen* also means *to shake* (*zhen*).

*Si* is the fourth month, pure yang without yin. From *zi* to *si*, these are yang’s positions, where yang thus prevails. *Si* also means *to rise* (*qi*), when all things have fully emerged and ascend.

*Wu* is when yang has not yet yielded, and yin begins to take charge. It is also said that *wu* means *to grow* (*zhang*) and *great* (*da*): by the fifth month, all things reach fullness and grandeur.

*Wei* is the sixth month, when wood has doubled and matured. It is also said that *wei* means *flavor* (*wei*), for when things mature, they acquire flavor—sharing the same meaning as *xin*.

*Shen* is the seventh month’s celestial time, where yang’s work is done, and yin reaches *shen*. Then above and below communicate, and people first see white dew; the falling of leaves marks its sign. Thus, one may recount yin’s affairs to their completion. *Shen* also means *body* (*shen*), for all things’ forms are complete.

*You* is the time of the sun’s setting, when yin is at its center—the eighth month. It is also said that *you* means *to sheath* (*jian*): the myriad things all contract and withdraw.

The ninth month, *xu*, is when yang is not yet exhausted, yet lies dormant, concealed within *xu* soil—thus the *qian* position, for *xu* is Heaven’s gate. It is also said that *xu* means *to extinguish* (*mie*): all things wither and fade.

The tenth month, *hai*, is pure yin. *Hai* also means *to restrain* (*he*): yin qi restrains and slays the myriad things—such is Earth’s Dao, whence the month’s name.

The stems of *jia* are Heaven’s Five Phases, each spoken of as one yin and one yang. The branches of *zi* are Earth’s corners, thus *zi*, *yin*, *wu*, and *shen* are yang; *mao*, *si*, *you*, and *hai* are yin. Soil resides in the four corners, ruling at the end of each season. Soil has four: *chen* and *xu* are yang, *chou* and *wei* are yin—hence their numbers differ.

When combined, ten stems pair with twelve branches, together forming sixty days. Six cycles of six complete a year. Thus, the classic states: “Heaven uses the six-six node to complete a year.” This is its meaning.

The twelve branches are also called the twelve pitches, or the twelve celestial times. Each branch has its corresponding star, the ruling asterism among the twenty-eight lodges it governs. Thus, one’s birth coincides with the lodge’s creature as their sign. Among the stellar creatures, there are primary and secondary: for instance, *Wei Fire Tiger* and *Ji Water Leopard* both reside in *yin*; *Kang Metal Dragon* and *Jiao Wood Dragon* in *chen*. The tiger and dragon are primary, the rest follow this pattern. The *Fire Tiger* and *Metal Dragon* are further ordered by the seven luminaries. What is now called *mi ri* refers to the names of the seven luminaries. When the sun directly governs the day, it is called *mi ri*, following the day’s lodge. Though these two are not explicitly detailed in the *Plain Questions*, they are profound principles of yin and yang. Thus, they are briefly presented here in passing.

**Diagram of the Five Phases’ Tones**
**Discourse on the Five Phases’ Tones, Fourth**

The Ten Celestial Stems and Twelve Earthly Branches combine to form sixty days, serving as the reckoning of Heaven and Earth, harmonizing to govern the days. *Jia* (甲), the East, marks the beginning of spring and is the eldest of the seasons; the North, where yang begins to stir, is the forerunner of qi. Thus, *jia-zi* (甲子) stands first, followed by *yi-chou* (乙丑). Yet within the cyclical branches, they intermingle and correspond, so the Five Phases alternately encounter one another, with none exclusively claiming dominion.

There is also the method of *na yin* (纳音), the cyclical mutual resonance of the Five Tones, which aligns with the function of the *lü-lü* (律吕, pitch pipes). Within each branch, five tones are contained, so the twelve branches together encompass sixty tones. For instance, within the *zi* (子) branch: *jia-zi* is Metal, *bing-zi* is Water, *wu-zi* is Fire, *geng-zi* is Earth, and *ren-zi* is Wood. According to the *Han Annals*, "those of the same kind marry, and after skipping eight positions, a child is born"—this is the *na yin* method. "Those of the same kind marry" refers to *jia*, a yang stem, and *zi*, a yang branch; when upper and lower both align as yang, they become excessive and cannot foster harmony. Thus, *yi-chou* is taken as the wife, for both its stem and branch are yin. The other positions follow this pattern. "Skipping eight to bear a child" means that eight positions before *jia-zi*, *ren-shen* (壬申) Metal is born below; after another eight skips, *geng-chen* (庚辰) Metal is born in the third position. Then, moving leftward toward Fire, Fire is born after three skips in the same manner; Wood follows after three more, then Water, then Earth, and finally Metal, completing one cycle. The cycle then resumes with Metal born above *jia-wu* (甲午), proceeding in order. "Skipping eight" refers to excluding the upper and lower positions—it is not merely the eighth position. If counted from *jia-zi* to *gui-you* (癸酉), the total is ten, representing the qi of a full *zhou jia* (周甲, sixty-year cycle).

That Metal is first in *na yin* is because among the Five Phases, only Metal possesses sound; when cast into instruments, its resonance becomes manifest. The *Baihu Tong* states: "The bell is the tone of *dui* (兑), which in humans forms the lungs, one of the five viscera. It first governs sound, and its resonance externally corresponds to firm skin and hair—this is the transformation of Metal. When autumn arrives, all things wither, and the air grows crisp and harsh, the wind sharp and howling—this is the nature of Metal." Contrary to the sequence that begins in the East and moves rightward toward the South, the Five Tones start in the West and proceed rightward toward the South. Yang is born at *zi* (子), hence the downward generation; yin is born at *wu* (午), hence the upward generation. This "upward and downward generation" precisely refers to Heaven’s qi descending and Earth’s qi ascending. The *Book of Changes* says, "Heaven and Earth unite in harmony," and this is the meaning therein.

That generation stops at three reflects the principle of the Three Origins. Thus, the classics state: "Three form Heaven, three form Earth, three form Man." The *Book of Changes* takes three as the image of its lines, and *Laozi* says, "One gives birth to two, two give birth to three, and three give birth to the myriad things"—this is the same idea. For there is a beginning, a middle, and an end, and all is complete. The Five Tones transform and cycle, so each of the twelve branches contains five tones, forming thirty positions that encompass the sixty *jia-zi*. Hence, the classics say: "Yin and yang intermingle, and change arises from this." And also: "High and low summon one another, ascent and descent follow in succession, and transformation occurs." This is the meaning.

**Diagram of the Six Transformations**
**Discourse on the Six Transformations, Fifth**

The Five Phases manifest forms upon the Earth, serving the daily needs of the world. They generate and restrain one another, forming the fundamental origin of the myriad things. Extending this upward, their qi transforms in a hundred ways—how could they be measured? Thus, when affecting humans, they constitute the body and serve as the pivot of the spirit’s mechanism; when reaching Heaven, they drive the cycles of cold and heat, becoming the source of generation and transformation. From this, the ancient sages discerned its subtleties, and the *Inner Canon* was composed. It states: "On Earth, they form shapes; in Heaven, they become qi."

Yet while there are five phases, there are six qi, distinguishing the transformations of Sovereign Fire and Ministerial Fire. The Six Qi transformations refer to cold, heat, dryness, dampness, wind, and fire—the primordial qi of Heaven. The three yin and three yang then uphold them, calling them the *biao* (标, manifestations). The discussion of *biao* and *ben* (本, roots) is found in the text below.

Each of the Six Qi has a transformation, though this is a general outline. Examining the texts, we find: Earth’s transformation is dampness and rain; Metal’s transformation is dryness and clarity—each merely clarifies its nature. Wood’s transformation is wind, which governs spring. "Spring" (*chun*, 春) means "stirring" (*chun*, 蠢); yang qi stirs and moves, so wind rouses and animates the myriad things, serving as Heaven’s decree. Sovereign Fire’s transformation is heat, governing the end of spring and beginning of summer. It issues the command of warmth and gentleness but does not bring scorching heat, reflecting the virtue of the sovereign. Ministerial Fire’s transformation is summer heat, governing summer. "Summer" (*xia*, 夏) means "great" (*da*, 大), sharing the meaning of *wu* (午). Scorching heat then prevails.

Metal’s transformations are clarity and dryness, governing autumn. "Autumn" (*qiu*, 秋) means "harvest" (*qing*, 擎), sharing the meaning of Metal. Cold and frost then prevail. White dew is the qi of clarity. Metal belongs to *geng* (庚) and *xin* (辛); *xin* is the wife of *bing* (丙), carrying the qi of Fire, hence dryness. The *Classic of Difficulties* states: "*Xin* is *shang* (商), the softness of *bing*—thus the transformation of Metal’s dryness is clear." Prolonged rain followed by a west wind is the sign of dryness and clearing. If rain falls with a west wind, dryness and dampness contend, yet it will clear on its own.

Water’s transformation is cold, governing winter. "Winter" (*dong*, 冬) means "end" (*zhong*, 终); severe cold then prevails. Earth’s transformations are dampness and rain, governing *chang xia* (长夏, the long summer), which refers to the sixth month. Earth is born from Fire and flourishes in the midst of summer. Having grown, it reigns, and the soil becomes moist and warm, so the transformation of dampness prevails. For when damp, Earth lives; when dry, Earth dies. Springs emerge from the ground—this confirms the truth of the damp transformation.

The Canon states: "Earth’s *qi* ascends to become clouds; Heaven’s *qi* descends to become rain. Rain emerges from Earth’s *qi*, clouds from Heaven’s *qi*." Thus the transformation of Earth and rain is manifest. Though they govern the same year’s mandate, they cycle and administer it in turn.

The sequence of the four seasons’ cold and warmth, combined with the six *qi*’s transformative mandates, makes each year distinct. Generally, spring’s warmth, summer’s heat, autumn’s chill, and winter’s cold are the proper *qi* of Heaven and Earth. When the visiting *qi* occupies the host’s position, there arise differences of inversion, compliance, excess, and dominance. Hence the *qi* and climate vary—how could they be fixed and uniform?

The *qi* of yin and yang and the four seasons begin in the central months and reach their peak in the final months. Thus the Canon states: "There is a discrepancy of thirty *du* and some fraction." It also speaks of the application of the *qi* mandate’s waxing and waning, which lies in the four *wei* (corners). Therefore, yang’s movement begins with warmth and peaks in heat, while yin’s movement begins with coolness and peaks in cold. This is what is meant by the divisions of spring, summer, autumn, and winter differing in their allocations.

The four *wei* refer to the four seasonal months: *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*. Spring’s *qi* begins in the second month and reaches its warm peak in the third; summer’s *qi* begins in the fifth month and reaches its hot peak in the sixth; autumn’s *qi* begins in the eighth month and reaches its cool peak in the ninth; winter’s *qi* begins in the eleventh month and reaches its cold peak in the twelfth. From this, the discrepancy in *qi* is clear.

Yet at the summer solstice in the fifth month, yin *qi* is born but gives rise to great heat; at the winter solstice in the eleventh month, yang *qi* is born but gives rise to great cold. This is because *qi* arises from below and then pushes upward. Thus when yin is born, yang ascends and heat intensifies; when yang is born, yin ascends and cold intensifies. As verified today: in summer, wells are cool and frozen; in winter, wells are warm. This is what is meant by the constancy of the year.

**Diagram of the Four Seasons’ Qi and Climate**
**Discourse on the Four Seasons’ Qi and Climate (Chapter Six)**

The winter solstice is one of the central *qi*. Earthworms coil as the sun and moon move, forming the four seasons through their constancy. Thus the sages established laws to track them. Yin and yang interweave to generate the myriad things through their boundlessness, so the sages pointed to phenomena to observe them. The beginning and end of the six *qi*, the waxing and waning of the five movements’ excess and deficiency—tracing them to their fundamental principles, examining them through their ultimate numbers—these have been handed down through the ages without error.

The Canon states: "Five days make a *hou* (climatic phase); three *hou* make a *qi* (seasonal phase); six *qi* make a *shi* (season); four *shi* make a year." It also says: "The sun is yang; the moon is yin. Their movements have divisions and records; their circuits have measured distances. The sun travels one *du* per day; the moon travels thirteen *du* and some fraction. Thus the great and small months total 365 days to complete a year, and the accumulation of *qi* surplus fills the intercalary month."

The Canon further states: "The sun travels one *du* of the heavens by day and night, making one day. Together, 365 and a quarter days complete the celestial circuit, forming one year. A *hou* corresponds to every five days, so three *hou* form one *qi*, totaling fifteen days. Three *qi* form one *jie* (solar term). The *jie* refer to the eight terms: *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring), *Chunfen* (Spring Equinox), *Lixia* (Beginning of Summer), *Xiazhi* (Summer Solstice), *Liqiu* (Beginning of Autumn), *Qiufen* (Autumn Equinox), *Lidong* (Beginning of Winter), and *Dongzhi* (Winter Solstice). These eight terms, three each, make twenty-four *qi*, which divide and govern the four seasons, completing a year.

The equinoxes of spring and autumn are so called because, in terms of the six *qi*, at the midpoint of the second month, the first *qi* ends and the second *qi* begins; at the midpoint of the eighth month, the fourth *qi* ends and the fifth *qi* begins. In terms of the four seasons’ mandates, this is when the *qi* of yin and yang’s cold and warmth can be divided. The division of day and night into fifty *ke* (marks) is also the midpoint of yin and yang. Thus the Canon states: "At the division, the *qi* differ." This is what it means.

The solstices of winter and summer are so called because, in terms of the six *qi*, at the midpoint of the fifth month, the *qi* of the *Sitiān* (Controller of Heaven) reaches its position; at the midpoint of the eleventh month, the *qi* of the *Zaiquan* (Controller of the Springs) reaches its position. In terms of the four seasons’ mandates, this is when yin and yang reach their extremes. At the summer solstice, the day does not exceed sixty *ke*, for yang reaches its peak; at the winter solstice, the day does not exceed forty *ke*, for yin reaches its peak. These are the unchanging celestial signs. Thus the Canon states: "At the solstice, the *qi* are the same." This is what it means.

Heaven turns from west to east, while the sun, moon, and five planets follow the heavens, moving from east to west. Thus the *Baihutong* states: "Heaven rotates left; the sun, moon, and five planets move right." The sun, moon, and five planets are yin within Heaven, so they move right, like ministers facing their lord.

The sun travels one *du* of the heavens by day and night; the moon travels thirteen *du* and some fraction by day and night. This means that within the additional one *du*, dividing it into nineteen parts yields seven. Generally, the moon moves swiftly, completing one celestial circuit in twenty-seven days. Combining the thirteen *du* and the seven nineteenths gives twenty-nine days, during which the moon travels 387 *du* and some fraction. Comparing the moon’s swift movement to the sun’s slower pace: in twenty-nine days, the sun travels twenty-nine *du* of the heavens, while the moon has already completed one circuit of 365 *du* and an additional twenty-two *du*, yet it still falls seven *du* short of the sun.

The Yin-Yang scholars say that the movements of the sun and moon naturally have sequences of before and after, with unequal slowness and speed, lacking a constant standard. Thus there are differences in the great and small months’ endings. Originally, 365 and a quarter *du* (twenty-five *ke*) make one year. Excluding the year’s surplus leaves 360 days; further excluding the six days lost in small months leaves 354 days to complete a year. Altogether, this is eleven days and twenty-five *ke* short, so intercalary months are added to form a twelve-month system. The *qi* at the beginning of the year is the arrival of three *hou*; the midpoint of the month indicates the direction of the Dipper’s handle, which corresponds to the twelve earthly branches.

The intercalary month’s reckoning lacks the establishment of *qi* and the orientation of the Dipper’s handle; all other *qi* are merely observed through the calendar’s eight nodes, and by calculating the surplus, an intercalary month is formed—thus the celestial degrees are complete. As the classic states: "Establish the beginning at the origin, align the standard at the center, and calculate the surplus at the end—thus the celestial degrees are complete." This is its meaning.

Gazing into the boundless depths of heaven, how could there be degrees? Yet the positions where the sun and moon traverse each day are marked by the twenty-eight lodges as evidence, recording them as daily degrees. Thus the classic says: "The stars and constellations regulate the movements of the sun and moon." *Regulate* here means *institution*—heaven itself has no *hou*, but through the timely manifestations of wind, rain, frost, dew, grasses, and trees, which can be verified, we measure them as *hou*. Each *hou* spans five days, wherein the *qi* of the five movements succeed one another in sequence, like a ring without end, cycling perpetually. As the *Book* states: "A period of three hundred and sixty-six days, with intercalary months, determines the four seasons to complete a year." This is its principle. Those of the medical profession must not be ignorant of it.

The classic says: "One who does not know the year’s additions, the盛衰 of *qi*, or the origins of deficiency and excess cannot be called a practitioner." Wang Bing observed that if the movements of heaven’s true *qi* are not yet fully comprehended, how can the causes of human illness be precisely understood? This is the profound warning of the ancient sages.

**Diagram of the Six-Qi Transitions at Seasonal Junctures**
**Chapter Seven: On the Six-Qi Transitions at Seasonal Junctures**

Yin and Yang converge, dividing into six positions where cold and heat unfold; the sun and moon shift, driving the four seasons as the *qi*-mandates alternate. Thus the classic says: "To the right of *Xianming*, the position of the sovereign fire." *Xianming* refers to the sun, corresponding to the *mao* position. To the right of the sovereign fire, stepping back once, the ministerial fire governs; stepping back again, earth-*qi* governs; stepping back again, metal-*qi* governs; stepping back again, water-*qi* governs; stepping back once more, wood-*qi* governs—these are the ruling positions of the six *qi*.

From the mid-month *qi* of the twelfth month, the *Great Cold* day, the initial *qi* of wood begins; next, at the mid-month *qi* of the second month, the *Spring Equinox* day, the second *qi* of sovereign fire begins; next, at the mid-month *qi* of the fourth month, the *Lesser Fullness* day, the third *qi* of ministerial fire begins; next, at the mid-month *qi* of the sixth month, the *Great Heat* day, the fourth *qi* of earth begins; next, at the mid-month *qi* of the eighth month, the *Autumn Equinox* day, the fifth *qi* of metal begins; next, at the mid-month *qi* of the tenth month, the *Lesser Snow* day, the sixth *qi* of water begins. Each *qi* governs sixty days and eighty-seven and a half *ke*, totaling three hundred sixty-five days and twenty-five *ke*, completing one year. If there is a surplus beyond the year or days lost in small months, it falls short.

However, when calculating by the calendar, the transition of *qi* follows the solar terms—this pertains to the Yin and Yang of earth, the so-called "stillness that holds its position." It serves as the constant governing *qi* of each year, where cold, heat, dryness, dampness, wind, and fire are the regular patterns of the six *qi*, though their responses differ.

There is also the Yin and Yang of heaven, the so-called "movement without ceasing," which includes the *Controller of Heaven*, the *Within-the-Earth*, and the four *Intermediaries*. Rotating and residing above, it is called *guest qi*. The *guest qi* carries out heaven’s mandate within the year; where heaven’s mandate arrives, there are again the transformations of cold, heat, dryness, dampness, wind, and fire. The *host qi* merely complies, reverently following the mandate of the *guest*. If the *guest* prevails, it follows; if the *host* prevails, it resists. In these two, there is victory but no retaliation.

**Diagram of Day and Ke**
**Chapter Eight: On Day and Ke**

A day consists of one cycle of day and night, with the twelve hours evenly divided across it. Thus, the wise of old devised the bronze clepsydra to hold water, its floating arrow marking the descent, the arrow divided into one hundred *ke* to measure the passage. Though the sun and moon wax and wane, they cannot escape this reckoning—hence, within a single day, there are one hundred *ke* of observation.

The six *qi* govern a full year, so each *qi* presides over sixty days and eighty-seven and a half *ke*. From this, we know that the moments of *qi*-transition may be early or late, and thus this diagram is established to clarify them. Though the summer days vary in length, causing the shifts between day and night and altering the times of sunrise and sunset, the total remains one hundred *ke*. Yet the *ke* at which the *qi* exchange cannot be altered.

In a *jiǎzǐ* year, the first *qi* begins at the first *ke* of the water clock’s descent and ends at the eighty-seventh and a half *ke*, at the midpoint of *zǐ* (midnight). The second *qi* resumes at the eighty-seventh *ke* and six *fēn*, ending at the seventy-fifth *ke*, four *ke* into *xū* (7–9 p.m.). The third *qi* resumes at the seventy-sixth *ke*, ending at the sixty-second and a half *ke*, at the midpoint of *yǒu* (5–7 p.m.). The fourth *qi* resumes at the sixty-second *ke* and six *fēn*, ending at the fiftieth *ke*, four *ke* into *wèi* (1–3 p.m.). The fifth *qi* resumes at the fifty-first *ke*, ending at the thirty-seventh and a half *ke*, at the midpoint of *wǔ* (noon). The sixth *qi* resumes at the thirty-seventh *ke* and six *fēn*, ending at the twenty-fifth *ke*, four *ke* into *chén* (7–9 a.m.). This completes one full cycle of the year’s celestial reckoning, and the remaining *ke* carry over into the first *qi* of the *yǐchǒu* year.

Proceeding thus in rotation until the first *qi* of the *wùchén* year, it resumes at the first *ke* of the water clock’s descent—four years make one small cycle. This is why the *shēn-zi-chén* years share the same *qi* assembly. The first *qi* of *sì-yǒu-chǒu* years all begin at the twenty-sixth *ke*; the first *qi* of *yín-wǔ-xū* years all begin at the fifty-first *ke*; and the first *qi* of *hài-mǎo-wèi* years all begin at the seventy-sixth *ke*. Since the *qi* all commence at the same *ke*, this is called the "Three Convergences," and its principle arises from this.

Fifteen small cycles make one great cycle, totaling sixty years.

**Diagram of Root and Branch**
**Chapter Nine: On Root and Branch**

The Three Yin and Three Yang are the six qi of Heaven—the *branches*; Water, Fire, Wood, Metal, and Earth are the Five Phases of Earth—the *roots*. From generation and growth to transformation, harvest, and storage, Yang contains Yin, and Yin contains Yang. Movement and stillness summon one another; above and below confront each other; Yin and Yang intermingle—thus arises change. This is the Dao, not merely inscribed in vain, for within it resides the most profound principle.

As expounded in the *Four Inquiries* on the mutual relations of branches and roots, their origins remain unfathomable. The Greater Yin’s damp Earth and the Lesser Yang’s ministerial Fire share the same branch and root, yet the Lesser Yin’s sovereign Fire and the Greater Yang’s cold Water differ in Yin-Yang and cold-heat—whence does this principle arise? Could it be that it emerges naturally, beyond the reach of human naming?

From ancient times to the present, Yang is said to proceed in sequence, its vigor advancing from the Greater Yang to the Lesser Yang; Yin moves in reverse, its vigor retreating from the Lesser Yin to the Greater Yin. This aligns with the divination of the *Yi*’s hexagrams. Thus, the sovereign Fire governs at *wǔ*, the position where the first Yin arises. Fire is inherently hot, yet its qi coincides with the inception of Yin—hence the divergence of branch and root, and why sovereign Fire belongs to the Lesser Yin. Water resides in the northern *zǐ*, the position where the first Yang arises. Water is inherently cold, yet its qi coincides with the inception of Yang—hence the divergence of branch and root, and why cold Water belongs to the Greater Yang.

Earth occupies the southwest *wèi*, corresponding to the long summer month. *Wèi* follows *wǔ*, and thus Earth is called the Greater Yin. Ministerial Fire governs at *yín*, which follows *chǒu*, and thus ministerial Fire is called the Lesser Yang. Wood resides in the eastern *zhèn*, governing the liver in humans. The liver, though Yang, emerges as Yin has not yet fully receded; though it dwells beneath the diaphragm in a Yin position, Wood awaits Yin before it can grow—hence it belongs to the Terminal Yin. Metal resides in the western *duì*, governing the lungs in humans. The lungs, though Yin, serve as the canopy; though they dwell above the diaphragm in a Yang position, Metal awaits Yang before it can manifest—hence it belongs to the Yang Brightness.

Thus, the distinctions among the six qi and the principles of branch and root arise from this.

**Diagram of Generation and Completion Numbers**
**Chapter Ten: On Generation and Completion Numbers**

Heaven’s height is vast and boundless—do the six qi revolve within it to complete the four seasons? Earth’s depth is profound and obscure—do the five phases generate and transform within it to complete the myriad things? Truly, they are infinite and unfathomable.

The sages established methods to calculate and track them, for none can escape their numerical order. Observing the basis of these numbers, one sees they all arise from nature itself. Thus, they are recorded in the classics, consistent and unchanging. By deduction, one grasps their mechanism; by exhaustive inquiry, one comprehends their transformations—all without departing from the realm of numbers.

One is Water, two is Fire, three is Wood, four is Metal, five is Earth—each has its proper place.

Water resides in the northern position of *zǐ*. *Zǐ* marks the initial arising of Yang, and one is the number of Yang—hence Water is called one. Fire resides in the southern position of *wǔ*. *Wǔ* marks the initial arising of Yin, and two is the number of Yin—hence Fire is called two. Wood dwells in the east, the region of Yang; three is an odd number, also Yang—hence Wood is called three. Metal dwells in the west, the region of Yin; four is an even number, also Yin—hence Metal is called four. Earth corresponds to the late summer of the southwest; five is an odd number, also Yang—hence Earth is called five. From this, it is clear that numbers are paired with Yin and Yang.

Yet if one examines their profound meaning: Water is born from one. Before Heaven and Earth divided and the myriad things took form, nothing was not first manifest in Water. Thus, the *Língshū Jīng* states: "The Great One is the exalted name of Water, the mother of Earth, the source of the myriad things." Testing this in the present: the seeds of grasses and trees before they ripen, the embryos of humans and insects, the yolks of eggs—all are Water. Is this not because Water is one?

When Water gathers and form and substance transform, nothing lacks the qi of Yin and Yang within before it is complete. Thus, the bitterness of small things is the omen of Fire. When things ripen, they become sweet—the flavor of Earth. When sweetness reaches its extreme, it reverts to blandness, which is the root. Now, humans receive the transformation of Yin and Yang from their parents, and thus the two kidneys are formed first: the left kidney belongs to Water, the right kidney to Fire. Fire is called the Gate of Life, for Fire is only seen after Water—hence Fire is called the next two.

Though the seeds of grasses and trees differ in size, within each there are two parts that unite, just as in human kidneys. This is the omen of Yin and Yang, for without the union of Yin and Yang, the myriad things cannot generate and transform. Once Yin and Yang unite, then there is spring’s generation and autumn’s completion—hence the next three is Wood, the next four is Metal.

Water has its domain, Fire has its repository, Wood has its arising, Metal has its differentiation—all depend on Earth to complete the five, hence the next five is Earth. Wood dwells in the east, Metal in the west, Fire in the south, Water in the north, Earth in the center, its position borrowed from the four directions, corresponding to the four seasons. In humans, it governs the four limbs. Thus, Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire all depend on Earth to be complete. Combining them with Earth’s number five, Water becomes six, Fire seven, Wood eight, Metal nine. Earth’s generating number is always five and does not reach ten, for Earth does not require ten to be complete. The numbers of generation and completion all unite through five, and from this the number of the Great Expansion is established. How could the myriad things escape their numbers?

The proper transformations of the Three Yin and Three Yang follow the root generating numbers; their corresponding transformations follow the branch completion numbers. In the cycles of the Five Movements, excess is governed by completion numbers, deficiency by generating numbers—each is assessed by the abundance or scarcity of its numbers. The arising of administrative decrees, qi transformations, and cycles of dominance and response all clarify these applications.

**Diagram of the Five Heavenly Qi**
**Chapter Eleven: On the Five Heavenly Qi**

The celestial stems and terrestrial branches interweave, arrayed across the eight directions, each with its fixed position. The stellar lodges encircle them, casting their images above, each corresponding to its own terrestrial region. Thus, in high antiquity, the observation of celestial qi and the gazing of astral omens were recorded in books, bequeathed to later generations. Only through careful scrutiny and profound contemplation can their truths be illuminated.

The heavens divide into five qi, while the earth arranges the Five Phases. The five qi branch and flow, dispersing above, traversing the stellar lodges, and below, aligning with the cardinal and intercardinal directions—thus they are designated as the Five Movements. The qi of the Cinnabar Heaven courses through the four lodges of Ox, Girl, Straddler, and Wall, descending to the positions of *wù* and *guǐ*, establishing the Fire Movement. The qi of the Yellow Heaven courses through the four lodges of Heart, Tail, Horn, and Gullet, descending to the positions of *jiǎ* and *sì*, establishing the Earth Movement. The qi of the White Heaven courses through the four lodges of Neck, Base, Bond, and Net, descending to the positions of *yǐ* and *gēng*, establishing the Metal Movement. The qi of the Dark Heaven courses through the four lodges of Spread, Wings,娄, and Stomach, descending to the positions of *bǐng* and *xīn*, establishing the Water Movement. The qi of the Azure Heaven courses through the four lodges of Rooftop, House, Willow, and Ghost, descending to the positions of *dīng* and *rén*, establishing the Wood Movement. These five qi traverse the twenty-eight lodges, aligning with the twelve terrestrial divisions, their configurations clearly discernible. Thereby, the Five Heavens are established, and the Five Movements are founded.

The *xū* position is the Celestial Gate, the *qián* direction; the *sì* position is the Earthly Portal, the *xùn* direction. From Chamber to Net, fourteen lodges govern the yang and the day; from Bond to Heart, fourteen lodges govern the yin and the night—together comprising a single day.

**Diagram of the Five Tones Establishing the Movements**
**Chapter Twelve: On the Five Tones Establishing the Movements**

Metal is called *shang*, Wood *jiao*, Fire *zhi*, Water *yu*. In yang years, they are termed "Greater"; in yin years, "Lesser." The *Book of Jin* states: *Jiao* means "to stir," symbolizing how the yang qi stirs and activates its position—this corresponds to *dīng* and *rén* years. *Zhi* means "to halt," signifying how things reach their peak and then cease at their position—this corresponds to *wù* and *guǐ* years. *Shang* means "strength," denoting the unyielding nature of Metal at its position—this corresponds to *yǐ* and *gēng* years. *Yu* means "to unfold," as the yang qi begins to return, and the myriad things propagate and unfold at their position—this corresponds to *bǐng* and *xīn* years. *Gong* means "center," the Dao of central harmony, pervading all without exception; it also encompasses the hall, chambers, inner rooms, and alcoves, hence the term *gong*. The diagrams vary, for Earth likewise interpenetrates Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire, reigning over the four seasons and flourishing in the four viscera—all embodying this unifying principle. Its position corresponds to *jiǎ* and *jǐ* years.

Thus, the Five Movements arise from the ten celestial stems: *jiǎ* governs Earth; Earth generates Metal, so *yǐ* follows; Metal generates Water, so *bǐng* follows. In this manner, the Five Phases generate one another in turn, with *jiǎ* as yang and *yǐ* as yin, alternating in sequence like a ring without end. Examining the origins of the Five Tones and Five Movements, none fail to summon one another above and below, to ride upon one another in great and small, ultimately converging in governance.

Therefore, from the division of the day into *kè* arises the day; from the day arises the month; from the month arises the year—each successively giving rise to the next in their regulated use. Though in high antiquity, observers of heaven divined the qi to determine the positions of the beginnings, seeing the azure qi of heaven traversing *jiǎ* and *jǐ* as the Earth Movement, the white qi traversing *yǐ* and *gēng* as the Metal Movement, the black qi traversing *bǐng* and *xīn* as the Water Movement, the green qi traversing *dīng* and *rén* as the Wood Movement, and the red qi traversing *wù* and *guǐ* as the Fire Movement—none failed to follow this pattern.

If one examines the method of monthly establishment, the cause of the Movements’ inception becomes further evident. Why? *Bǐng* is the yang of Fire; it is established at the beginning of *jiǎ* and *jǐ* years, with the first month marked by *bǐng-yín*. Since *bǐng* Fire generates Earth, *jiǎ* and *jǐ* govern the Earth Movement. *Wù* is the yang of Earth; it is established at the beginning of *yǐ* and *gēng* years, with the first month marked by *wù-yín*. Since *wù* Earth generates Metal, *yǐ* and *gēng* govern the Metal Movement. *Gēng* is the yang of Metal; it is established at the beginning of *bǐng* and *xīn* years, with the first month marked by *gēng-yín*. Since *gēng* Metal generates Water, *bǐng* and *xīn* govern the Water Movement. *Jiǎ* is the yang of Wood; it is established at the beginning of *wù* and *guǐ* years, with the first month yielding *jiǎ-yín*. Since *jiǎ* Wood generates Fire, *wù* and *guǐ* govern the Fire Movement. *Rén* is the yang of Water; it is established at the beginning of *dīng* and *rén* years, with the first month yielding *rén-yín*. Since *rén* Water generates Wood, *dīng* and *rén* govern the Wood Movement. All Five Movements arise from the celestial stem established in the first month—is this not the mutual regulation of the sun, moon, and years?

**Diagram of Monthly Establishment**
**Chapter Thirteen: On Monthly Establishment**

The twelve earthly branches correspond to the twelve months: the first month is *yín*, the second *mǎo*, and so forth. In *jiǎ* and *jǐ* years, the first month is established as *bǐng-yín*; in *yǐ* and *gēng* years, *wù-yín*; in *bǐng* and *xīn* years, *gēng-yín*; in *dīng* and *rén* years, *rén-yín*; and in *wù* and *guǐ* years, *jiǎ-yín*—thus employing the ten celestial stems to establish the month on *yín*. Observing this method, the *jiǎ-zǐ* year serves as the beginning, utilizing the first occurrence among the sixty *jiǎ-zǐ* cycles for establishment, with subsequent occurrences following in order. Thus, *bǐng-yín* is first, *wù-yín* second, and so on, proceeding in sequence.

When the positions in the *Nayin* Diagram of the sixty *jiǎ-zǐ* cycles are fully established, they revolve anew above to complete their cycle—this is evident in the establishment of time, with the daily stems following the same method. In years of insufficiency during yin phases of the Five Movements, the initial qi commences on the day of Great Cold. If the stem of the day and hour aligns with the yearly stem, it is called the "Stem-Virtue Concord," resulting in balanced qi—neither excessive nor insufficient. This is briefly presented to clarify its application.

**Diagram of Heaven and Earth’s Six Qi**

**On the Six Qi of Heaven and Earth, Fourteenth**

The Classic states: When the qi of Heaven and Earth unite, the six seasonal divisions emerge, and the myriad things transform and arise. Now, Earth arranges the Five Phases—this speaks of its function. Branching into twelve, it distributes the qi of the Five Phases and yin-yang across the eight directions. For when Heaven’s qi descends, Earth’s qi ascends in response, both fully embodying the transformative qi of the Five Phases before uniting in function. Observing the myriad things, none fail to be transformed and generated by the qi of Heaven and Earth.

Earth’s qi is quiescent and constant; Heaven’s qi is dynamic and mutable. Yet their source of Six Qi is the same, though their sequences differ. Why? Heaven’s qi begins with Lesser Yin and ends with Reverting Yin. The Classic states: "Lesser Yin is called the *origin*; Reverting Yin is called the *end.*" Earth’s qi begins with Reverting Yin Wood and ends with Greater Yang Water. The Classic says: "To the right of *xiǎnmíng* lies the position of Sovereign Fire"—this is its sequence. Thus, their differing sequences arise from the mutual dependence of Heaven’s true qi and Earth’s *kūn*-origin qi.

Therefore, Heaven’s Six Origin Qi inversely align with Earth’s twelve branches, their sequences formed by the direct and indirect transformations of the Five Phases:
- Lesser Yin governs *zǐ* and *wǔ*
- Greater Yin governs *chǒu* and *wèi*
- Lesser Yang governs *yín* and *shēn*
- Yang Brightness governs *mǎo* and *yǒu*
- Greater Yang governs *chén* and *xū*
- Reverting Yin governs *sì* and *hài*

Such is the cause of Heaven’s qi in its beginning and end.

Earth’s Six Qi inversely align with Heaven’s four seasons, their sequences formed by wind, heat, summerheat, dampness, dryness, and cold:
- Reverting Yin Wind-Wood governs spring
- Lesser Yin Sovereign Fire governs late spring and early summer
- Lesser Yang Minister Fire governs summer
- Greater Yin Damp Earth governs long summer
- Yang Brightness Dry Metal governs autumn
- Greater Yang Cold Water governs winter

Such is the cause of Earth’s qi in its beginning and end.

The Classic states: "Heaven has yin and yang; Earth also has yin and yang"—this refers to their mutual correspondence above and below. Heaven’s qi moves without cease, thus every five years its cold shifts in response to Earth’s qi, which remains static and holds its position. If Heaven’s qi does not augment Sovereign Fire, then every five years one qi remains, shifting rightward above Minister Fire, for Sovereign Fire does not establish a year. Earth’s cycle completes in five years; Heaven’s cycle fulfills in six periods. In five years, the qi of the Five Phases pervades; in six periods, the positions of the Six Qi complete a circuit—this slightly differs from the sequence of stems over branches.

Taking the interlocking of yin and yang and the mutual overcoming of above and below, it fulfills the meaning of a cycle. With five and six combined, thirty years form one cycle—thus, sixty years. **Diagram of the Ruling Qi**

**On the Ruling Qi, Fifteenth**

Earth’s qi remains static and holds its position, thus spring warmth, summer heat, autumn chill, and winter cold become the constant mandates of each year, for the four seasons are governed by the Six Qi. Jueyin Wood serves as the first qi, marking the beginning of spring’s breath. Wood generates Fire, so Shaoyin Sovereign Fire and Shaoyang Minister Fire follow. Fire generates Earth, so Taiyin Earth follows. Earth generates Metal, so Yangming Metal follows. Metal generates Water, so Taiyang Water follows. All unfold their mandates through mutual generation, each without fail possessing its sequence.

Wood as the first qi governs the sixty-odd days before the Spring Equinox. From the alignment of *Dou* with *Chou* to the midpoint of *Mao*, when the celestial degrees reach this point, the wind qi begins to move. Sovereign Fire as the second qi governs the sixty-odd days after the Spring Equinox. From the alignment of *Dou* with *Mao* to the midpoint of *Si*, when the celestial degrees reach this point, the mild warmth begins to spread. Minister Fire as the second qi governs the thirty-odd days before and after the Summer Solstice. From the alignment of *Dou* with *Si* to the midpoint of *Wei*, when the celestial degrees reach this point, the scorching heat begins to prevail. Earth as the fourth qi governs the sixty-odd days before the Autumn Equinox. From the alignment of *Dou* with *Wei* to the midpoint of *You*, when the celestial degrees reach this point, the rains begin to fall and the damp mists arise. Metal as the fifth qi governs the sixty-odd days after the Autumn Equinox. From the alignment of *Dou* with *You* to the midpoint of *Hai*, when the celestial degrees reach this point, the clear qi begins to move, and all things become desiccated. Water as the sixth qi governs the thirty-odd days before and after the Winter Solstice. From the alignment of *Dou* with *Hai* to the midpoint of *Chou*, when the celestial degrees reach this point, the cold qi begins to move.

The six positions rotate to govern the qi, completing one year. Thus, the Six Qi of Heaven each year shift to reside above, carrying out Heaven’s mandates. The times of their transitions have already been fully recorded.

**Diagram of the Guest Qi**

**On the Guest Qi, Sixteenth**

The Six Qi divide into above and below, left and right to carry out Heaven’s mandates, while the twelve earthly branches divide the seasonal mandates and days to administer Earth’s transformations. When above and below summon one another, the qi of cold, heat, dryness, dampness, wind, and fire differ from the qi of the four seasons—this arises from the varying configurations of their encounters.

The Six Qi govern the twelve earthly branches through direct and corresponding transformations. Why, then, does Jueyin govern *Si* and *Hai*? Jueyin is Wood, and Wood is born in *Hai*, thus its direct transformation is in *Hai*, and its corresponding transformation is in *Si*. Though *Mao* is the proper division of Wood, it is the corresponding transformation of Yangming Metal, hence it follows generation and aligns with *Si*. Why does Shaoyin govern *Zi* and *Wu*? Shaoyin is Sovereign Fire, occupying the honored position, thus it rightfully holds the southern *Li* position; its direct transformation is in *Wu*, and its corresponding transformation is in *Zi*. Why does Taiyin govern *Chou* and *Wei*? Taiyin is Earth, which belongs to the central palace and is lodged in the *Kun* position, residing in the southwest at *Wei*; thus, its direct transformation is in *Wei*, and its corresponding transformation is in *Chou*. Why does Shaoyang govern *Yin* and *Shen*? Shaoyang is Minister Fire, its position humbler than Sovereign Fire; though *Wu* is its position, Sovereign Fire occupies it. Fire is born in *Yin*, thus its direct transformation is in *Yin*, and its corresponding transformation is in *Shen*. Why does Yangming govern *Mao* and *You*? Yangming is Metal, and *You* is the west, the west belonging to Metal; thus, its direct transformation is in *You*, and its corresponding transformation is in *Mao*. Why does Taiyang govern *Chen* and *Xu*? Taiyang is Water, though it has *Zi* as its position, Sovereign Fire’s corresponding transformation occupies it. One text states that it resides in *Chen* and *Xu*. *Chen* and *Xu* belong to Earth, thus Water, though it employs Earth, as *Mencius* says: “Water flows through the midst of the earth”—this is evident. Water lies concealed within Earth, as the six *Wu* are the Celestial Gate at *Xu*, and the six *Si* are the Earthly Door at *Chen*. Thus, though Water employs Earth, its direct transformation is in *Xu*, and its corresponding transformation is in *Chen*. This explanation in the *Xuan Zhu* is already detailed, and each has its basis.

This is the union of Heaven’s yin and yang with Earth’s twelve branches, ceaseless in its movement. Simply take the annual pitch-pipe starting from the governing Heavenly number of the current year: the arriving qi is the Governing Heaven, the qi opposite it is the In-Dwelling, and the remaining qi become the left and right intervals. The qi following the In-Dwelling serves as the first qi, governing sixty days and eighty-seven and a half *ke*. It reaches the Governing Heaven as the third qi, governing the first half of the year, from the day after Greater Cold through the entire first half. It reaches the In-Dwelling as the sixth qi, governing the second half of the year, from the day after Greater Heat through the entire second half.

Shaoyin *Zi* leads in sequential movement, and it is always the excessive Governing Heaven. Whether excessive or insufficient, the intervals are the same, aligning with the diagram of the ten stems and their movements above and below. Thus, the classic states: “Before the year’s midpoint, Heaven’s qi governs it; after the year’s midpoint, Earth’s qi governs it”—this is the meaning.

Heaven’s Six Qi are the guests. When these guest qi are arranged upon the steps of Earth’s Six Qi, differences in qi transformations arise. The classic states: “Above and below have positions; left and right have their sequences.” The Governing Heaven is the upper position, in the south; facing north, left is west and right is east. The In-Dwelling is the lower position, in the north; facing south, left is east and right is west. Thus, above and below differ, and left and right diverge. The *Six Subtleties* states: “To the right of Shaoyang, Yangming governs its sequence”—this is when facing south to observe the arrival of qi. It does not refer to the positions of above and below, left and right, but aligns with the evident meaning of left and right, and the governance of Fire.

Facing south to observe, this refers to the designation of positions.

**Diagram of Heavenly Correspondences**
*Discourse on Heavenly Correspondences, Chapter Seventeen*

When yin and yang intersect and above and below assume governance, then arise the transformations of excess, dominance, stagnation, and retaliation—this is the great principle. The *Controller of Heaven* (司天) means "to direct" (直), presiding over the enactment of Heaven’s decrees, occupying the upper position. The *Yearly Movement* (歲運) means "to move" (動), governing the qi of transformation and generation among heaven, earth, and all beings, occupying the middle position. The *Indweller in the Springs* (在泉) governs Earth’s transformations, circulating within the earth, occupying the lower position. Within a single year, these three qi—upper, middle, and lower—each enact their transformative decrees. When their qi coincidentally align and converge, their transformations interpenetrate. Even without the vicissitudes of conquest and retaliation, there arise differences in gradual or sudden onset of illness. This is called *Heavenly Correspondence* (天符) in the year when the Controller of Heaven’s qi coincides with the Middle Qi Movement.

*Correspondence* (符) means "to unite" (合). There are twelve years of Heavenly Correspondences. Among these twelve years, when the yearly movement also aligns with the twelve pitch-standards and the Five Phases, this is further called *Yearly Convergence* (歲會), designated as *Grand Unity Heavenly Correspondence* (太一天符). *Grand Unity* (太一) is the honorific title for this convergence, signifying: first, the convergence of Heaven (天會); second, the convergence of the year (歲會); and third, the convergence of movement (運會). Among these, there are four years—regardless of whether they are yin or yang years—all termed Heavenly Correspondences. Thus, the classic states: "Heavenly Correspondence is the *Enforcer of Law*; Yearly Convergence is the *Enactor of Decrees*; Grand Unity Heavenly Correspondence is the *Noble Person*." When pathogenic qi invades a person, the *Enforcer of Law* causes illness to be prolonged and perilous; the *Enactor of Decrees* causes illness to be gradual and enduring; the *Noble Person* causes illness to be sudden and fatal. This is because the qi’s decree, when it strikes a person, penetrates deeply.

Yearly Convergence aligns with the pitch-standards but not with Heaven’s decree, hence it is called the *Enactor of Decrees*. The commentary states: "Like a regional lord without the authority of an enforcer, there is no swift harm or illness, only persistence." *Diagram of Yearly Convergence*
*Discourse on Yearly Convergence, Chapter Eighteen*

When the ten Heavenly Stems establish the yearly *qi*-phase in conjunction with the twelve Earthly Branches and the Five Phases, it is called *Yearly Convergence*. The governing *qi* of the year does not distinguish between yin and yang years; rather, it selects the central month of each of the four seasons as the four *Direct Bearers of the Year*: *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*. Earth, having no fixed position, is assigned to reign during the final eighteen-plus days of each season, thus the *General Bearers of the Year* also include *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*. Together, these account for eight years.

Beyond these, there are four additional years: *ren-yin*, both Wood; *geng-shen*, both Metal—these two being yang years; *gui-si*, both Fire, and *xin-hai*, both Water—these two being yin years. Though the *qi*-phase and yearly branch converge, they are not considered *Yearly Convergence* because they do not align with the central mandate of the four years. Excluding the two yang years, the two yin years—*gui-si* and *xin-hai*—though not named *Yearly Convergence*, still harmonize the Five Phases above and below, forming years of *Balanced Qi*. In such years, the generation of beings and the response of pulses all adhere to their proper timing, without earliness or delay.

Among the eight years of *Yearly Convergence*, four coincide with the *qi* of the *Heavenly Controller*, thus falling under *Grand Unity Heavenly Correspondence*. The remainder has been discussed in previous sections.

*Diagram of Heavenly Correspondence and Yearly Convergence*
*Discourse on Heavenly Correspondence and Yearly Convergence, Chapter Nineteen*

The six *qi* cycle in rotation, alternately governing Heaven and Earth. Excess and deficiency follow yin and yang, establishing standards through regulation. The upper, middle, and lower *qi* transmit their correspondences, as previously recorded in *Heavenly Correspondence* and *Yearly Convergence*. When the *qi*-phase converges with the *qi* of the *Earthly Controller*, in yang years it is called *Heavenly Correspondence*, and in yin years, *Yearly Convergence*. Thus, within sixty years, there are four years of *Grand Unity Heavenly Correspondence*, twelve years of *Heavenly Correspondence*, eight years of *Yearly Convergence*, six years of *Heavenly Correspondence*, and six years of *Yearly Convergence*. Though these five categories total twenty-six years when considered separately, they amount to only twenty-seven years when combined. The *Classic* speaks of twenty-four years, omitting the additional years—this must be carefully examined.

As discussed in *Northern and Southern Governance, Chapter Twenty*, variations in application, the severity of illness, and the timing of life and death can all be discerned through the *Classic*’s method of calculation.

*Diagram of Northern and Southern Governance*
*Diagram of Northern and Southern Governance, Chapter Twenty*

When applying the ten Heavenly Stems to determine the cycles, the *Ruler Fire* does not govern its own phase. Among the six qi, the *Ruler Fire* holds the highest rank, while among the five phases, *Damp Earth* is supreme—thus, the *Earth Phase* of *Jia* and *Ji* governs the *Southern Polity*. This is because Earth, with its completion number five, unifies Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire, occupying the central position as the honored ruler. Facing south to issue commands, the remaining four phases serve as ministers, facing north to receive them—this is the distinction. In human pulse diagnosis, during the years of *Jia* and *Ji*, when the two phases face south to assess the pulse, the *cun* position lies to the south and the *chi* to the north. When *Lesser Yin* governs Heaven, the two *cun* positions do not respond; when *Lesser Yin* governs Earth, the two *chi* positions do not respond. In the years of *Yi*, *Bing*, *Ding*, *Wu*, *Geng*, *Xin*, *Ren*, and *Gui*, the four phases face north to assess the pulse, so the *cun* lies to the north and the *chi* to the south. When *Lesser Yin* governs Heaven, the two *chi* positions do not respond; when *Lesser Yin* governs Earth, the two *cun* positions do not respond. Thus, south is considered above and north below. This aligns with the principle that men, facing south to receive qi, have a consistently weaker *chi* pulse, while women, facing north to receive qi, have a consistently stronger *chi* pulse. Since yin qi sinks downward, it does not respond. In the arrangement of the six qi, *Lesser Yin* occupies the center, *Terminal Yin* the right, and *Greater Yin* the left—this order cannot be altered. As *Lesser Yin* governs the two *cun* and *chi* positions, when *Terminal Yin* governs Heaven or Earth, it should be on the right, so the right does not respond. When *Greater Yin* governs Heaven or Earth, it should be on the left, so the left does not respond. According to the *Southern Polity*, this pertains to the *chi* and *cun*. If one inverts the hand for diagnosis, then yin, which sinks below, appears to float, and what is fine seems large. The *Classic* states: "When *chi* and *cun* are inverted, death follows; when yin and yang intersect, death follows." First, establish the year to know its qi, observe the left and right responses, and only then can one speak of the order of life and death. Further, through diagnosis, one must distinguish inversion and examine intersection to grasp the subtleties of life and death.

*Diagram of the Convergence of Greater and Lesser Qi and Phases*
*On the Convergence and Transformation of Greater and Lesser Qi and Phases, Chapter Twenty-One*

When Heaven and Earth meet in purity, all beings and the self are transformed. Within a single year, cold, heat, dryness, dampness, and wind jointly govern, while generation, growth, transformation, harvest, and storage are all present within the myriad things. This is not limited to a single year—even within the brief span of a moment, the qi of the five phases is ever-present. Nor is it confined to a single being—even in the finest hair or sprout, the transformations of the five phases are borne. Yet, in governing the phases and pacing the qi, whether greater or lesser, they take turns presiding over the seasons, waxing and waning in succession. Above, they correspond to the waxing and waning of the five planets; below, they are verified in the flourishing and decline of the five creatures. As for the transformations of the five grains, five fruits, five flavors, and five colors, is there a year without them? Only their ripeness varies in degree, and their hues and tastes differ in depth.

For Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth all proceed together, their transformations merely differing in the states of rest, imprisonment, kingship, and ministerial support. The phase that directly governs the cycle acts as its sole master, while the one corresponding to the time serves as the guest. Together, they carry out Heaven’s mandate. In yang years, the qi reigns and is excessive; in yin years, the qi wanes and is insufficient. When excessive, it seeks to balance the phase it overcomes; when insufficient, the overcoming phase encroaches upon its transformation. In excessive years, Wood balances Metal’s transformation, Metal balances Fire’s, Fire balances Water’s, Water balances Earth’s, and Earth balances Wood’s. In insufficient years, Wood merges with Metal’s transformation, Metal with Fire’s, Fire with Water’s, Water with Earth’s, and Earth with Wood’s. When the *Controller of Heaven* and the phase converge, there may be harmony or conflict, mutual restraint or assistance. The *Controller of Heaven* aligns with its proper state, while the phase, when suppressed, deviates from its equilibrium. Thus, the five qi maintain balance, and none encroach upon another.

In excessive years, each of the five phases governs for six years, totaling thirty yang years. *Greater Angle* refers to the six *Ren* years; when encountering *Fire* governing Heaven in *Zi*, *Wu*, *Yin*, or *Shen*, the Wood phase is in conflict, for Fire is Wood’s child, and when it presides above, it is adversarial. *Greater Zhi* refers to the six *Wu* years; when encountering *Cold Water* governing Heaven, it properly suppresses Fire, resulting in a year of balanced qi, where *Upper Yu* aligns with *Proper Zhi*. *Greater Gong* refers to the six *Jia* years, and *Greater Shang* to the six *Geng* years; when encountering *Fire* governing Heaven in *Zi*, *Wu*, *Yin*, or *Shen*, it properly suppresses Metal, resulting in a year of balanced qi, where *Upper Zhi* aligns with *Proper Shang*. When encountering *Water* governing Heaven in *Chen* or *Xu*, it is in conflict, for Water is Metal’s child, and when it presides above, it is adversarial. *Greater Yu* refers to the six *Bing* years.

In insufficient years, each of the five phases governs for six years, totaling thirty yin years. *Lesser Angle* refers to the six *Yi* years; when encountering *Wood* governing Heaven in *Si* or *Hai*, the phase and qi assist each other, aligning with *Proper Angle*. When encountering *Metal* governing Heaven in *Mao* or *You*, the phase merges with its transformation, where *Upper Shang* aligns with *Proper Shang*. When encountering *Earth* governing Heaven in *Chou* or *Wei*, as Wood is insufficient and merges with Metal’s transformation, Earth assumes governance, where *Upper Gong* aligns with *Proper Gong*. *Lesser Zhi* refers to the six *Gui* years; when encountering *Metal* governing Heaven in *Mao* or *You*, as Fire is insufficient and merges with Water’s transformation, Metal assumes governance, where *Upper Shang* aligns with *Proper Shang*. *Lesser Gong* refers to the six *Ji* years; when encountering *Earth* governing Heaven in *Chou* or *Wei*, the phase and qi combine to provide assistance, where *Upper Gong* aligns with *Proper Gong*.

When encountering *Si* or *Hai* with *Wood* governing Heaven, the phase merges with its transformation, where *Upper Jue* aligns with *Proper Jue*. *Lesser Shang* refers to the six *Yi* years; when encountering *Mao* or *You* with *Metal* governing Heaven, the phase and *qi* combine to provide assistance, where *Upper Shang* aligns with *Proper Shang*. When encountering *Si* or *Hai* with *Wood* governing Heaven, as *Metal* is insufficient and merges with *Fire*’s transformation, *Wood* assumes governance, where *Upper Jue* aligns with *Proper Jue*. *Lesser Yu* refers to the six *Xin* years; when encountering *Chou* or *Wei* with *Earth* governing Heaven, the phase merges with its transformation, where *Upper Gong* aligns with *Proper Gong*.

The term *Upper* refers to the decree of *Heaven’s governance*. The distinctions among the five *Greater* and five *Lesser* years arise from encounters that either align or misalign. For instance, *Sovereign Fire*, *Ministerial Fire*, and *Cold Water* invariably govern Heaven in *yang* years, while *Damp Earth*, *Dry Metal*, and *Wind Wood* invariably govern Heaven in *yin* years. Yet within the sixty-year cycle, each has its celestial and terrestrial encounters—sometimes *Heaven’s governance* prevails over the *phase*, sometimes the *phase* prevails over *Heaven’s governance*, or the *phase* may be in a state of excess yet fail to cultivate its *virtue*, instead encroaching upon what it cannot overcome. Alternatively, a *phase* in deficiency may evade what it overcomes, refusing to merge with its transformation. Additionally, there are *Grand Unity Heaven*, *Yearly Conjunctions*, *Celestial Conformities*, and *Yearly Celestial Conjunctions*, which are determined by textual inference and thus not reiterated here.

**Diagram of Phase Governance**
**On Phase Governance, Twenty-Second**

Among the ten celestial stems, five are *yin* and five are *yang*, establishing the five phases as either excessive or insufficient, each overcoming the other in turn. In years of insufficiency, the conquering phase arrives to restrain it, for the *phase* is in a state of depletion. Yet within these cycles, there exist *Yearly Conjunctions* and *Celestial Conjunctions*, which also bring balance to *qi*. Externally, when the year’s stem and branch align, or when the days and hours of *qi* exchange coincide with matching stems, they provide mutual assistance, termed *Balanced Qi*. This achieves equilibrium in the year’s *qi*, ensuring that the pulse of living things and their responses adhere strictly to their appointed times, without deviation.

The sages established names to record these patterns. For example, in the year *Xin-Hai*, *Water* phase should be *Balanced Qi*—why? *Xin* is a *yin* year of *Water* phase, and *Hai* belongs to the northern *Water*; their mutual support brings *Water* *qi* into balance. Another example: in the year *Gui-Si*, *Fire* phase is also called *Balanced Qi*—why? *Gui* is a *yin* year of *Fire* phase, and *Si* belongs to the southern *Fire*; their mutual support brings *Fire* *qi* into balance.

Each year, the initial *qi* exchanges on the day of *Great Cold* preceding the year. For instance, on the day *Ding-Hai* when governance is exchanged, if the day’s stem aligns with *Ren*, it is called *Stem-Virtue Conformity*. *Conformity* means alignment, thus forming *Balanced Qi*. If the hour of governance exchange coincides with *Ren*, it is also called *Stem-Virtue Conformity*. Beyond the day and hour of the initial *qi* exchange, no further alignments are efficacious. The rest follow this pattern: *Jia-Ji* align, *Yi-Geng* align, *Bing-Xin* align, *Ding-Ren* align, and *Wu-Gui* align.

In *yin* years, if the month’s stem also aligns, the mutual support is even more potent. If no conquering phase is encountered but the stem alignment appears, it is also *Balanced Qi*. After the conquering phase has acted and its retribution is complete, if the month’s stem aligns, the phase regains its proper position. Thus, the recording of *excessive*, *insufficient*, and *balanced* years must be determined through careful calculation. Therefore, *Balanced Qi* years cannot be predetermined. The arrangement of *yin* and *yang* years beneath the ten stems here is merely a general outline, provided for ease of understanding. The recording of *Balanced Qi* must be deduced according to the year’s branch, day, hour, and stem, following the prescribed method.

Thus:
- In *Wood* phase: *Greater Jue* years are called *Flourishing Growth* (excessive); *Lesser Jue* years are called *Withered Harmony* (insufficient); *Proper Jue* years are called *Disseminating Peace* (*Balanced Qi*).
- In *Fire* phase: *Greater Zhi* years are called *Blazing Radiance* (excessive); *Lesser Zhi* years are called *Concealed Brightness* (insufficient); *Proper Zhi* years are called *Ascending Brightness* (*Balanced Qi*).
- In *Earth* phase: *Greater Gong* years are called *Abundant Mound* (excessive); *Lesser Gong* years are called *Humble Oversight* (insufficient); *Proper Gong* years are called *Complete Transformation* (*Balanced Qi*).
- In *Metal* phase: *Greater Shang* years are called *Firm Completion* (excessive); *Lesser Shang* years are called *Yielding Reform* (insufficient); *Proper Shang* years are called *Prudent Balance* (*Balanced Qi*).
- In *Water* phase: *Greater Yu* years are called *Flowing Overflow* (excessive); *Lesser Yu* years are called *Dried Streams* (insufficient); *Proper Yu* years are called *Obedient Stillness* (*Balanced Qi*).

Each is recorded accordingly. When *qi* is balanced, it aligns with *Proper Transformation*, neither excessive nor insufficient.

Furthermore, within *excessive* phases, if restrained by the *qi* of *Heaven’s governance*, it may also become *Balanced Qi*. For instance, in the *Blazing Radiance* record, when *Cold Water* governs Heaven for two years, or in the *Firm Completion* record, when the two *Fires* govern Heaven for four years, these are all *Balanced Qi* years.

**The Five Phases Within the Year**
**On the Five Phases Within the Year, Twenty-Third**

The six terrestrial positions divide and govern the four seasons. The five celestial phases also follow their generative sequence throughout the year. In the *Plain Questions*, this is only seen in the *Comprehensive Discourse on the Regular Patterns of the Six Qi*. Every ten years, one governs Heaven, and the text merely mentions the beginning, end, and proper alignment. Here, however, it refers to the *phase* governing a single year, with each phase ruling seventy-three days and five *ke*, totaling three hundred sixty-five days and twenty-five *ke* for the five phases, completing one year.

Thus, the year’s celestial stem determines the *Great Phase* governing the entire three hundred sixty-five days. The year’s governing *phase* is named according to its *Greater* or *Lesser* *Five Tones*. If the year corresponds to *Wood*, it begins with *Greater Jue* and descends through generation, hence called *Proper Beginning*. *Greater Jue Wood* generates *Lesser Zhi Fire*, *Lesser Zhi Fire* generates *Greater Gong Earth*, *Greater Gong Earth* generates *Lesser Shang Metal*, and *Lesser Shang Metal* generates *Greater Yu Water*, concluding the sequence, with *excess* or *insufficiency* following accordingly.

If the year’s *Great Phase* is *Lesser Gong*, then the sequence follows from it: *Lesser Gong Earth* is preceded by *Fire*, hence called *Greater Zhi*. *Greater Zhi Fire* is preceded by *Wood*, hence called *Lesser Jue*. Thus, the governing *phase* begins with *Lesser Jue* and concludes with *Lesser Yu Water*.

*Wood* is the initial *phase*, exchanging on the day of *Great Cold*; *Fire* is the second *phase*, exchanging thirteen days after the *Spring Equinox*; *Earth* is the third *phase*, exchanging twenty-five days after *Lesser Fullness*; *Metal* is the fourth *phase*, exchanging thirty-seven days after *Great Heat*; and *Water* is the fifth *phase*, exchanging forty-nine days after the *Autumn Equinox*. This constitutes the year’s governing *phase*, distinguished by *Greater* and *Lesser* variations.

As recorded in the *Tian Yuan Yu Ce*’s "Sectioning Method," there further exists the *guest phase* of the year, which moves above the *host phase*, following the same principle as the *host* and *guest* of the Six Qi. Thus, the *Yu Ce* states: "The *guest phase* within the year invariably takes the *phase* corresponding to the *celestial stem* two positions before [the year’s stem] as its initial phase."

In years of *Shen-Zi-Chen*, the exchange occurs at the *yin* hour on the day of *Great Cold*.
In years of *Hai-Mao-Wei*, the exchange occurs at the *hai* hour on the day of *Great Cold*.
In years of *Yin-Wu-Xu*, the exchange occurs at the *shen* hour on the day of *Great Cold*.
In years of *Si-You-Chou*, the exchange occurs at the *si* hour on the day of *Great Cold*.

These five *phases* generate one another in sequence, completing the year’s cycle.

However, the classics do not explicitly detail its application. By analogy with the Six Qi, the *phases* should likewise possess *host* and *guest* functions to carry out Heaven’s decrees. For if the Five Phases’ *phase* governs its qi alone, how could the remaining four remain unused, failing to enact generation and transformation?

Yet the *great phase* of the year universally governs the entire year, akin to how the *Controller of Heaven* universally governs the first half of the year. The *Xuan Zhu* refers to this as the "Six Origins’ cyclical return," suggesting that the *Su Wen* conceals a single tone [in its explanation].

According to the *Tian Yuan Yu Ce*’s "Sectioning Method," the *guest* of the Five Phases alternately governs the year, implying that what the classics record is the *host phase* for each year. If we adopt the *Yu Ce* as the standard, its meaning becomes coherent. The *Xuan Zhu*’s interpretation, however, is not accepted in the supplementary annotations.

*Hand and Foot Meridians Diagrams*
*Discourse on the Hand and Foot Meridians, Twenty-Fourth*

Humanity receives the harmonious *qi* of Heaven and Earth and assumes the form of generation and transformation through the Five Phases. Yin and yang, hardness and softness, converge within a single body, making us the most numinous of the myriad beings, linking above and below as the "Three Powers." Thus, the classics state: "The *qi* of life takes root within; its mandate is called the *divine mechanism*." Only when the viscera and bowels, exterior and interior, mutually pair and harmonize does their harmony become the dwelling of spirit and *qi*, serving as the master of the mechanism’s activation. Without the Yellow Emperor and Qi Bo’s subtle discourse, none could comprehend this. Truly, only the sage can fulfill the potential of form—how profound the words!

Thus, the classics say: "The sages of high antiquity discoursed on the principles of human form, distinguishing the viscera and bowels, aligning the channels and collaterals, and unifying the Six Ones." They also state: "The five viscera and twelve joints all connect with Heaven’s *qi*—this refers to the three yin and three yang of the hand and foot meridians." These twelve meridians externally circulate through the body’s form and internally penetrate the viscera and bowels, corresponding to the twelve months—namely, the twelve joints. The five viscera are yin, the six bowels are yang; one yin and one yang form a single union, making six unions.

The *Lesser Yin* meridian governs the heart and kidneys: the heart belongs to fire, while the *Lesser Yin* winter pulse originates in the kidneys. Moreover, the *Monarch Fire* properly governs at *wu* (noon) and transforms in opposition at *zi* (midnight), so the kidney viscus is also governed by *Lesser Yin*. The kidneys are not metal-water; on the right, they pertain to the *Fire of the Gate of Life*. The five viscera are yin and cannot be called yang. Water follows the kidneys, so *Greater Yang* becomes the bowel—thus, the *Hand Greater Yang* Small Intestine and *Foot Greater Yang* Bladder.

The *Greater Yin* meridian governs the spleen and lungs: the spleen belongs to earth, while the *Greater Yin* yin pulse resides in the lungs. Furthermore, earth generates metal, so the child follows the mother’s abode, and the lungs are governed by *Greater Yin*. Metal follows the lungs, so *Yang Brightness* becomes the bowel—thus, the *Hand Yang Brightness* Large Intestine and *Foot Yang Brightness* Stomach.

The *Ceasing Yin* meridian governs the liver and pericardium: the liver belongs to wood, and wood generates fire, so the child follows the mother’s abode, and the pericardium is governed by *Ceasing Yin*. Fire follows the pericardium, so *Lesser Yang* becomes the bowel—thus, the *Hand Lesser Yang* Triple Burner and *Foot Lesser Yang* Gallbladder.

The hand and foot meridians arise thus: the hand meridians’ vessels begin at the two hands, while the foot meridians’ vessels begin at the two feet. In terms of the twelve earthly branches, yin arises at *wu* (noon) and ascends, hence called *hand meridians*; yang arises at *zi* (midnight) and descends, hence called *foot meridians*. The hand and foot meridians thus mark the distinction between above and below. Moreover, the heart, lungs, and pericardium reside above and belong to the hand meridians; the liver, spleen, and kidneys reside below and belong to the foot meridians—this is also the meaning. Though the viscera and bowels share the hand and foot meridians, they form a single union.

The pericardium is not a viscus, nor is the Triple Burner a bowel. The classics state: "The *Shanzhong* is the office of the minister’s envoy, whence joy and happiness emerge." Located in the chest between the two breasts, it is the sea of *qi*, yet the heart governs as sovereign. "The Triple Burner is the office of drainage ditches, whence the waterways emerge." The Triple Burner has a name but no form; above, it joins the *Hand Heart Governor*, and below, it joins the right kidney. It governs the *qi* of the pathways and is called the envoy. Together, they constitute the twelve meridians. Thus, the classics say: "Yin and yang can be counted to ten, extended to a hundred, counted to a thousand, extended to ten thousand. Though the greatness of ten thousand cannot be fully enumerated, their essential principle is one." Though they cannot be fully enumerated, their essential subtlety can be known through the reckoning of separation and union.

The *Discourse on Dominance and Retaliation, Twenty-Fifth*
The *qi* of the Five Phases has abundance and decline; the *qi* of the heavens has vacuity and repletion. They alternately advance and follow to govern the year. Thus, the classics state: "When excess departs, insufficiency follows; when insufficiency departs, excess accompanies it." This is the principle. Therefore, the *qi* of the phases mutually exhibit greater and lesser degrees, giving rise to the transformations of dominance and retaliation.

When excess is great, it precedes the celestial timing, transforming through the victory of replete *qi*—thus, what is not victorious receives the evil. When insufficiency is great, it follows the celestial timing, transforming through the decline and vacuity of *qi*—thus, what overcomes it arrives to restrain it. After being restrained, it must await the proper time to retaliate. Retaliation acts upon what it overcomes, so it cannot advance. Only when the time is right does the child assume dominance, and then the child acts on behalf of the mother.

For example: in a *Wood Phase* *Lesser Angle* year, the *Metal Phase*’s clear transformation arrives to dominate, so the child fire retaliates, reversing with a hot transformation to overcome metal. In a *Fire Phase* *Lesser Note* year, the *Water Phase*’s cold transformation arrives to dominate, so the child earth retaliates, reversing with a damp transformation to overcome water. In an *Earth Phase* *Lesser Palace* year, the *Wood Phase*’s wind transformation arrives to dominate, so the child metal retaliates, reversing with a clear transformation to overcome wood. In a *Metal Phase* *Lesser Shang* year, the *Fire Phase*’s hot transformation arrives to dominate, so the child water retaliates, reversing with a cold transformation to overcome fire. In a *Water Phase* *Lesser Wing* year, the *Earth Phase*’s damp transformation arrives to dominate, so the child wood retaliates, reversing with a wind transformation to overcome earth. Thus, dominance and retaliation share this principle.

The *Xuan Zhu* discusses the six *qi* as having *proper governance* and *oppositional governance*: when the *proper governance* fully actualizes its transformative mandate, its excess leads to dominance without retaliation; when the *oppositional governance* manifests its vacuous transformative mandate, its slightness leads to dominance with retaliation. When dominance is severe, retaliation is severe; when dominance is slight, retaliation is slight—this is called the *transformation of evil qi*. When *qi* are not mutually attuned, evil *qi* afflicts people, causing illness.

Yet Heaven and Earth’s *qi* also enact dominance and retaliation. Thus, the classics state: "From the initial *qi* to the third *qi*, Heaven’s *qi* governs—this is the norm of dominance. From the fourth *qi* to the final *qi*, Earth’s *qi* governs—this is the norm of retaliation." When dominance reaches its limit, retaliation follows; when retaliation concludes, dominance resumes—thus, there is no constant *qi*. Only when dominance and retaliation cease without victory is the *qi* of life extinguished, hence called "injuring life."

Moreover, in years when the phase’s *qi* is greatly excessive, what is not victorious receives the evil. If it attains repletion yet still bullies what it cannot overcome, the phase’s insufficiency invites the arrival of what overcomes it to restrain it, exploiting the vacuity of *qi*.

Moreover, when it is oppressed and humiliated by what it cannot overcome, it will inevitably receive evil in the end, for the *qi* that is fundamentally not its conqueror must harm itself. Thus, the classics state: "Those who humiliate others will in turn receive evil"—this is precisely what it means.

The transformations of the Five Phases are not uniform in this manner, so one must distinguish them by examining the *qi* and seasonal indicators.

**Diagram of the Nine Palaces and Their Governance of the Regions**
**Chapter Twenty-Six: On the Nine Palaces and Their Corresponding Regions**

It is said: In years when the Five Movements are insufficient, disasters occur in the positions governed by the afflicted palace. Thus, one cannot generalize about disasters.

The classics state: "The nine stars hang bright, the seven luminaries revolve in cycles"—these refer to the celestial divisions governed by the nine stars. Therefore:
- In a *Lesser Angle* year, disaster strikes the third palace, corresponding to the eastern chamber and the *Zhen* position, governed by *Tianchong*.
- In a *Lesser Zhi* year, disaster strikes the ninth palace, corresponding to the southern chamber and the *Li* position, governed by *Tianying*.
- In a *Lesser Gong* year, disaster strikes the fifth palace, corresponding to the central chamber, governed by *Tianqin*, with its lodged position in the second palace, the *Kun* position.
- In a *Lesser Shang* year, disaster strikes the seventh palace, corresponding to the western chamber and the *Dui* position, governed by *Tianzhu*.
- In a *Lesser Yu* year, disaster strikes the first palace, corresponding to the northern chamber and the *Kan* position, governed by *Tianpeng*.

All these refer to the directions of insufficient *qi* in the Movements.

According to the *Tianyuan Yuce*:
- *Tianpeng* (1) is the palace of the Water regulator;
- *Tiannei* (2) is the responsive palace of the Earth spirit;
- *Tianchong* (3) is the palace of the Wood regulator;
- *Tianfu* (4) is the responsive palace of the Wood spirit;
- *Tianqin* (5) is the palace of the Earth regulator;
- *Tianxin* (6) is the responsive palace of the Metal spirit;
- *Tianzhu* (7) is the palace of the Metal regulator;
- *Tianren* (8) is the responsive palace of the Fire spirit;
- *Tianying* (9) is the palace of the Fire regulator.

Below, these correspond to the nine regions of the realm, namely: Ji, Dui, Qing, Xu, Yang, Jing, Yu, Liang, and Yong.

**Boar-Snake (Hai-Si):**

**Greater Yang, Reverting Yin,**
**Lesser Yin, Greater Yin,**
**Lesser Yang, Yang Brightness.**

Reverting Yin governs the first *qi*: biting cold, fierce winds arise, flourishing warmth, scorching winds harm men, wind and rain congeal into yin—pestilence arrives. Clear winds, frost and snow, frozen waters, rain births furred creatures; seasonal *qi* spreads unceasingly. Mists and dews obscure, pestilential *qi* lingers.

**Reverting Yin, Lesser Yin, Greater Yin,**
**Lesser Yang borrows counterflow from Yang Brightness, Greater Yang.**

Lesser Yin governs the second *qi*: wind and damp prevail, the realm suffers epidemics. Seasonal rains, intense heat, untimely warmth and chill, cold rains alternate with heat. Rain births feathered creatures; when aligned with its proper position, pestilence spreads.

**Lesser Yin, Greater Yin, Lesser Yang,**
**Yang Brightness, Greater Yang, Reverting Yin.**

Lesser Yang rules the heavens in the third *qi*: great heat blazes, thunder, rain, lightning, and hail arise. The heat arrives, grasses wither, rivers dry, frozen winds intersperse, cold *qi* alternates with heat, scorching winds rage.

**Greater Yin, Lesser Yang, Yang Brightness,**
**Greater Yang, Reverting Yin, Lesser Yin.**

Greater Yin governs the fourth *qi*, called the great rains: torrents, scorching heat, boiling mists, clear winds, dews, cold rains. Things are examined; winds and rains batter. Heat *qi* reverses its use. Drizzling rains, thunder and lightning, rain births scaled creatures; mountains and marshes float with clouds, sudden rains bring dampness.

**Lesser Yang, Yang Brightness, Greater Yang,**
**Reverting Yin, Lesser Yin, Greater Yin.**

Yang Brightness governs the fifth *qi*: warm winds arrive, great coolness, dryness and illness. Early cold, chilling winds rage, autumn *qi* damp and hot, seasonal rains, deep yin. All things flourish; rain births shelled creatures, heat diseases spread.

**Yang Brightness, Greater Yang, Reverting Yin,**
**Lesser Yin, Greater Yin, Lesser Yang.**

Greater Yang at the spring’s end governs the final *qi*: dry cold, biting sharpness, great cold congeals, frigid winds howl, hibernating creatures emerge. Freezing cold, snow, winter warmth—hibernating creatures stir. Rain births scaled creatures; flowing waters do not freeze, earth’s *qi* damp, streams do not ice.

**Heavenly and Earthly Governance, the Fourfold Inquiry into Qi Cycles**

The *qi* of the ruling heavens and the *qi* at the earth’s springs each govern a step of sixty days and eighty-seven and a half *ke*. As guest *qi* moves through celestial decrees, it resides above the host *qi*, thus giving rise to transformations of warmth and chill, cold and heat, dimness and brightness, obscurity and clarity, wind and rain, frost and snow, lightning and hail, thunder and thunderclaps—all differing in their manifestations. Spring’s warmth, summer’s heat, autumn’s chill, and winter’s cold are the proper decrees of the four seasons. How could they be entirely usurped by the *qi* of the phase or the season? Thus, at their appointed times, there naturally arise variations of mildness and intensity.

This arrangement of the sixty-year guest *qi*, placed alongside and beneath the host positions, serves to reveal the great principles of their *qi*’s locations. Heavenly correspondences, yearly meetings, balanced *qi*, the concord or discord of stems and branches, the mutual generation or conquest of *qi* and phase, the victory of guest over host or host over guest, the calamitous transformations of the celestial regions, the sequence of their interactions, the excesses and repressions, the auspicious omens and disastrous changes—all differ from one another, yet are fully expounded in the *Classic* and the *Mysterious Pearl*. By carefully observing the celestial timing and divining the *qi*’s conditions, one may achieve a harmony as precise as tallying tokens.

Yet when the six *qi* reach their extreme, they become excessive and overbearing, giving rise to disasters. Thus, when *qi* reaches its limit, it reverses, and the *qi* that is being overcome takes the lower position to counter it—this is what the *Classic* means by “beneath the ministerial fire, the *qi* of water bears it up.” There are also the intermediary *qi* that follow, as in the *Classic*’s statement: “Above lesser yang, the *qi* of fire governs, with reverting yin as its intermediary.” For when yang reaches its extreme, yin is born, and when yin reaches its extreme, yang is born—such is the wondrous function of the five phases mutually aiding one another.

The intermediary *qi* arise from the transformations of the sixfold convergence of the hand and foot channels and the viscera and bowels. In the realm between heaven and earth, the *qi* naturally respond accordingly.

**Discourse on the Six Diseases, Twenty-Eighth**

Where reverting yin arrives, there arise conditions of tightness and constriction, slackened or contracted sinews, pain in the limbs, spasms, rib-side pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. Where lesser yin arrives, there arise sores, fetal distress, bodily heat with aversion to cold, shivering, terror, confusion, sorrowful laughter, delirious raving, ravenous hunger, and bloody sweat. Where greater yin arrives, there arise accumulations of fluids, glomus and obstruction in the diaphragm, fullness in the center, cholera with vomiting and diarrhea, heaviness of the body, swelling of the limbs, and flaccid flesh that does not rebound when pressed. Where lesser yang arrives, there arise sneezing, vomiting, sores, throat impediment, ringing in the ears, vomiting with surging reflux, inability to swallow food, fright and agitation, dimness of vision, sudden outpouring, bloody stool, severe illnesses, and sudden death. Where yang brightness arrives, there arise sighing, sneezing, floating emptiness, stabbing pain, corpse-like cold, pain in the thighs, knees, shins, and feet, panting, and abdominal diseases. Where greater yang arrives, there arise difficulty in flexing and extending, lumbar pain, night sweats, convulsions, and inhibited flow of urine and stool. Such are the diseases caused by the six *qi*.

According to the *Classic*’s principles, when excesses and repressions occur, whether the host or guest *qi* is greater or lesser, the resulting illnesses depend on the depth to which the pathogenic *qi* penetrates a person, as well as the individual’s endowment, exposure, and ability to avoid harm. As for warm epidemics and seasonal *qi*, when an entire prefecture or county—regardless of size—falls ill, this is due to the natural workings of *qi* and phase in the celestial regions, mountains and plains, hills and valleys, and their orientations.

Now, humans are born with the *qi* of the five phases and also perish according to the numbers of the five phases. Internally, they possess the five viscera and six bowels as the source of vital *qi*; externally, they have the hundred bones and four limbs as the instruments of the spirit’s mechanisms. If one’s daily life is regulated and nurtured, enabling one to avoid pathogenic *qi* and preserve the upright, then one may remain within the bounds of longevity, free from untimely calamities.

Yet when sorrow, anxiety, thought, and worry, joy and anger, pull one internally, and cold, heat, dryness, dampness, wind, and fire assail one externally, then manifold illnesses arise and a hundred diseases are born. How much worse when one pursues profit and fame, indulges in cravings and desires, exhausts oneself with toil, suffers hunger and thirst, overindulges in drink and food, braves cold and heat, endures wind and rain, violates prohibitions, and harms one’s true spirit? In such cases, the causes of untimely injury and death are beyond counting—one can only blame oneself.

The *Classic* states: “Not knowing how to maintain fullness, not timely managing the spirit, seeking to gratify the heart, and acting contrary to the joy of life”—this is what it means. For when the pathogenic *qi* of heaven strike, they harm the five viscera; when the cold and heat of water and grain strike, they harm the six bowels; when dryness and dampness strike, they harm the skin, flesh, sinews, and vessels. Moreover, joy and anger injure the *qi*, while cold and heat injure the form. Wind is the chief of the hundred diseases, and in its transformations, it gives rise to other illnesses. Diseases have no constant pattern, for they arise from the *qi* of wind.

Furthermore, the hundred diseases are born of *qi*. Thus, the changes in the arising of diseases also depend on oneself. It is only after internal and external factors interact that they enter. Therefore, the *Classic* states: “When pathogenic *qi* strike and cause disease, there is *qi* externally, and internally, one is struck by what one detests. If one does not delight in it but nevertheless falls ill, this is called being affected by the year’s deficiency, losing the harmony of the seasons, or encountering the emptiness of the moon—then the pathogenic *qi* is severe. If one is repeatedly struck by pathogenic *qi*, the disease becomes critical.” This is what it means.

Though the *qi* of the phases and the *qi* of the seasons meet and interact, when they are in harmony, there is peace; when they are not in harmony, there is disease. When the phase is excessive, the one it cannot overcome is afflicted by pathogenic *qi*; when the phase is insufficient, the one it should overcome comes to restrain it. When the victories and repressions of host and guest *qi* are pent up and erupt, disease arises.

If one’s true original *qi* is replete, one’s daily life is timely, and one’s activities do not clash or expose one to harm, then even if warm epidemics arise, their effects will be mild. Thus, the sages possessed the arts of nurturing life and cultivating the true. Some may ask: How do the five phases and six *qi* of heaven and earth cause human disease? It is because the five viscera of humans correspond to the five phases of heaven and earth, and the *qi* of yin and yang follow their expansion, contraction, decline, and flourishing.

Wang Bing stated: “Even as the azure heavens spread their *qi*, they do not transgress the five phases. Humans dwell within this *qi*—how could they not correspond to the Dao of heaven?” For humans inhale and exhale the misty *qi* of heaven and earth, consume the products of the five phases’ transformations to nourish themselves, and together preserve their forms—how could they not follow the waxing and waning of the *qi* of the phases and yin and yang? The *Classic* states: “Heaven feeds humans with the five *qi*; earth feeds humans with the five flavors.” This is what it means.

The human chest and diaphragm serve as the passage for food and drink and the conduit for breath. If cold and heat lose their proper measure, prohibitions are violated, and yin and yang fall out of harmony, then epidemic and pathogenic *qi* converge in the chest, entering internally to lodge in the five viscera and six bowels—this is an omen of grave harm, hence called the "chest."

Thus, the sage discusses drawing from the source of transformation, supplementing insufficiency and draining excess, consuming the grain of the year to stabilize one’s *qi*, and eating the grain of the interregnum to expel evil. In this way, illness may be avoided. Yet many are those who fall ill by being affected by the five movements and six *qi*.

The *Classic* further states: “Injury by cold in winter leads to warm disease in spring; injury by wind in spring leads to diarrhea in summer; injury by summerheat in summer leads to malarial disorders in autumn; injury by dampness in autumn leads to cough in winter.” Harm from the *qi* of the four seasons can all cause illness.

During winter, yang governs within, and though cold may enter, its force cannot yet stir. When spring arrives and yang emerges while yin governs within, then cold stirs and contends with yang, giving rise to warm epidemics. During summer, yin governs within, and though summerheat may enter, its force cannot yet stir. When autumn arrives and yin emerges while yang governs within, then summerheat stirs and contends with yin, giving rise to malarial chills.

Moreover, the *qi* of the four directions differ, and the illnesses they cause vary accordingly. Thus, the *Classic* presents the doctrine of “different methods suited to local conditions” to grasp the nature of disease. There are also cases where illness arises in a given year but does not stem from the year’s *qi*—one must trace the source of the affliction, for its signs, symptoms, and pulse may not all be products of the movements and *qi*. The physician must discern this clearly. This discussion extends to such matters to avoid rigid adherence to the movements and *qi*, lest one err in supplementation and drainage.

**On the Six Pulses (Chapter Twenty-Nine)**
To clarify the six *qi* of yin and yang’s cyclical movements, distinguish the supremacy of southern and northern yearly governance, examine the causes of host and guest victories, and scrutinize the changes of excess, victory, depression, and retaliation—one must rely on the pulse to be a true physician.

When the five movements are insufficient, the conquering phase arrives to restrain; when the five movements are excessive, the conquered phase suffers harm. The six *qi* of heaven and earth encounter one another: if they align, it is harmony; if not, it is adversity. When *qi* are compatible, there is peace; when incompatible, there is illness. Only the victorious and retaliatory *qi* of heaven and earth do not manifest in symptoms—these are the victory of heaven from the initial *qi* to the third *qi*, and the retaliation of earth from the fourth *qi* to the final *qi*. Since these are matters of *qi* rather than position, they are not observed through symptoms.

For the rest, one must know the six pulses. Thus, the *Classic* states: “When *Jueyin* arrives, its pulse is wiry; when *Shaoyin* arrives, its pulse is hooking; when *Taiyin* arrives, its pulse is deep; when *Shaoyang* arrives, its pulse is large and floating; when *Yangming* arrives, its pulse is short and rough; when *Taiyang* arrives, its pulse is large and long.” When they arrive in harmony, it is balance; when they arrive excessively, it is illness; when they arrive contrary, it is illness; when they fail to arrive, it is illness; when they arrive prematurely, it is illness. When yin and yang interchange, it is perilous. This is what it means.

Though humans are born with the five phases complete within their bodies, the root of vital *qi* lies within, and it also follows the expansion and contraction of heaven and earth’s *qi*. How is this known? For example, the spring pulse is wiry, the summer pulse is surging, the autumn pulse is floating, and the winter pulse is stone-like. Thus, the five and six *qi* all correspond and appear in the pulse—yet because the workings of the *qi* movements are profound, few discuss them.

The human limbs and body undergo the transformations of cold and summerheat, externally preserving their form, inhaling and exhaling the *qi* of heaven and earth, and internally nourishing the bowels and viscera. If above and below are harmonious, the seasonal *qi* and movements are regulated, and cold and heat are orderly, then there is no suffering. Yet as the yearly movements shift and the *qi* commands intersect, fullness and emptiness follow one another, adversity and harmony alternate, and change gives rise to illness—this is the constant principle of yin and yang.

The *Classic* states: “Going against them generates change; change generates illness. Things arise in response, and *qi* and pulse respond accordingly.” This is what it means. One must establish the year’s *qi* to diagnose and differentiate.

The movements have southern and northern governance. The *Classic* speaks of death when the inch and cubit pulses reverse or when yin and yang intermingle. For example, in northern governance, the two inch pulses should be deep and fine but instead become floating and large, shifting to the two cubit pulses, which should be deep and fine but are not—this is called intermingling, and such a case is fatal. In southern governance, the two inch pulses should be deep and fine but instead become floating and large, shifting to the two cubit pulses, which should be deep and fine but are not—this is called reversal, and such a case is fatal. If only the inch or only the cubit pulse is abnormal and does not correspond, it is neither intermingling nor reversal but merely illness. This serves as an example; other years follow the same principle.

Thus, the *Classic* states: “First know the year’s *qi*; do not violate the harmony of heaven.” Crude physicians, ignorant and unaware, call it cold or heat. Attacking cold to induce heat, the pulse does not change, yet heat illness arises. Suppressing heat to induce cold, the pulse remains the same, yet cold illness emerges. How can one seek proper treatment? The causes of premature death all stem from this.

The *Basic Classic*’s *Discourse on the Qi Signs of the Healthy* states: The Taiyang pulse arrives vast, large, and long; the Shaoyang pulse comes now rapid, now sparse, now short, now long; the Yangming pulse arrives floating, large, and short. The *Classic of Difficulties* likewise cites this in discussing the pulses of the three yin and three yang, speaking of the depth at which yin and yang first arise.

These six pulses reflect the mutual encounter of *qi* and *yun* in their cycles of dominance and retaliation, each manifesting in its proper season and time of transformation, hence their differing movements. Comparing the various discourses, one finds broad agreement with minor variations. When the *qi* and *yun* intersect at their appointed times and days, appearing neither prematurely nor belatedly nor excessively, this is called harmony. Any deviation signals illness.

The *Classic* says: “Food *qi* enters the stomach, the turbid *qi* returns to the heart, overflowing its essence into the vessels. The vessel *qi* flows through the channels, the channel *qi* returns to the lungs. The lungs face the hundred vessels, conveying essence to the skin. Vessel and skin unite their essence, moving *qi* through the *fu*. The *fu*’s essence and spirit become luminous, lingering in the four *zang*. The *qi* returns to the balance, thereby forming the inch pulse and determining life and death.”

It further states: “The *qi* and flavors of the five *zang* and six *fu* all derive from the stomach, transforming and appearing at the *qi* opening.” The *qi* opening is the inch opening. Thus, Qin Yueren, deeply grasping this principle, composed the *Classic of Difficulties*, saying that taking the inch pulse alone suffices to determine the life and death of the five *zang* and six *fu*—this refers to the pulse of the healthy and at ease.

For every drop of water in the clepsydra, the pulse returns to the hand Taiyin, allowing one to diagnose the *qi* of the five *zang* and six *fu*, distinguishing excess and deficiency, and discerning life and death within fifty beats. The *Basic Classic*’s *Discourse on the Qi Signs of the Healthy* discusses the movement of the breath and pulse, then addresses cases where the inch pulse is normal yet death occurs, or where the upper pulse is absent while the lower pulse remains—though distressed, such cases are not fatal. This refers to the already ill, whose *qi* may be swift or sluggish, failing to arrive at the inch pulse on time. What standard, then, can be applied? Thus, the cubit pulse is taken as the measure. The principles discussed before and after differ—what is the reason?

One who masters the essentials of pulse diagnosis—the three positions and nine indicators, the seven exterior and eight interior pulses, the nine pathways and twelve channels—and integrates them with the *yun-qi* pulse methods may be called a great physician.

**Discourse on Treatment Methods, Chapter Thirty**

For the Wood position’s host, drain with sour and supplement with acrid. For the Jueyin guest, supplement with acrid, drain with sour, and relax with sweet.

For the host of the Fire position, drain with sweet and supplement with salty. For the Shaoyin guest, drain with sweet and restrain with salty. For the Shaoyang guest, supplement with salty, drain with sweet, and soften with salty.

For the Earth position’s host, drain with bitter and supplement with sweet. For the Taiyin guest, supplement with sweet, drain with bitter, and relax with sweet.

For the Metal position’s host, drain with acrid and supplement with sour. For the Yangming guest, supplement with sour, drain with acrid, and discharge with bitter.

For the Water position’s host, drain with salty and supplement with bitter. For the Taiyang guest, supplement with bitter, drain with salty, firm with bitter, and moisten with acrid.

These are the supplementation and drainage methods for the six *qi*’s host and guest. When the guest prevails, drain the guest and supplement the host; when the host prevails, drain the host and supplement the guest. Treatment should follow what requires urgency or relaxation.

The *Basic Classic* further discusses treatment methods for the six *qi* governing heaven and residing in earth, as well as for their excesses and countervailing forces, along with dietary and medicinal treatments suited to the year’s *yun* above and below. These vary, each adapted to the patient’s suffering, aligning with the *yun*’s mandate and regulating with the five flavors of medicinal stones.

The five *yun* and six *qi* alternate in dominance, retaliation, excess, and depression, each producing different calamities. The *qi* governing heaven resides in the yang division, while that residing in earth dwells in the yin division. The principles of host and guest, reversal and compliance, are not uniform, giving rise to a hundred illnesses. Thus, the sage exhaustively describes their conditions, supplementing them with the flavors of acrid, sour, sweet, bitter, salty, and bland, along with methods of supplementation, drainage, harmonization, and assistance—this may be called thorough.

For the practitioner, one must clarify the year’s mandate, examine the patient’s symptoms, diagnose the pulse and breath, distinguish yin and yang, and follow the *Classic*’s principles to rescue and heal. What illness, then, cannot be cured?

Regarding the differing natures and flavors of medicinal substances: sometimes one follows their nature while opposing their disposition; sometimes one uses what they overcome or what overcomes them; or employs the flavors of mother and child above and below to supplement or drain. All these are subtle applications, mutually manifesting.

The essentials of illness and treatment are most detailed and varied in the *Classic*’s discourses. Yet these supplementation and drainage methods for the five *yun* and six *qi* must also align with the people of the four directions, whose endowments and nurturance differ. Thus, the *Classic* contains discourses on differing methods suited to local conditions.

In applying acupuncture and medicine, *qi* may be deficient or replete, illness may be severe or mild, treatment may be urgent or gradual, and formulas may be small or large. There are methods of direct and counter treatment. Using cold to treat heat and heat to treat cold is called direct treatment; using cold to treat cold and heat to treat heat is called counter treatment. Cold employed for heat, heat for cold, unblocking for unblocking, obstruction for obstruction; in exterior resolution, do not avoid warmth; in interior attack, do not avoid cold. For those with insufficient form, warm with *qi*; for those with insufficient essence, supplement with flavor. Some obtain results by addressing the root, some by addressing the branch, some by addressing the middle *qi*, some by addressing both root and branch, some by counteracting, and some by following. For Wood depression, free it—this means inducing vomiting to restore harmony.

For Fire depression, release it—this means inducing sweat to disperse it. For Earth depression, purge it—this means draining to prevent congestion. For Metal depression, drain it—this means promoting diuresis and resolving the exterior to unblock the urine. For Water depression, restrain it—this means suppressing its surging counterflow.

When these five methods are applied, *qi* becomes harmonized. Then, assess deficiency and excess to regulate them. These are not merely methods for depression but for all diseases arising from depression.

Yet diseases vary in duration, and formulas may be large or small, toxic or non-toxic; they must be tailored accordingly. These are but brief outlines of the canonical principles of treatment—one must examine them carefully before applying them.

As for the five flavors of medicinals, they generally correspond to the tastes that enter the five viscera for supplementation or drainage: sweet enters the spleen, sour the liver, salty the kidneys, bitter the heart, and acrid the lungs. The tastes that enter the viscera are also employed to regulate and treat based on their natures: acrid disperses, sour astringes, sweet moderates, bitter firms, and salty softens. Acrid and sweet, being dispersive, pertain to yang; sour and bitter, being emetic and purgative, pertain to yin; bland flavors, being diuretic, pertain to yang. These are the great principles of medicinal use.

Within the five movements, there is also the method of necessarily restraining depressed *qi* by first addressing the source of transformation. The *Mysterious Pearl* states: when Greater Yang governs heaven, drain the source of Water in the ninth month; when Yang Brightness governs heaven, drain the source of Metal in the sixth month; when Lesser Yin or Lesser Yang governs heaven, drain the source of Fire in the third month; when Greater Yin governs heaven, drain the source of Earth in the fifth month; when Reverting Yin governs heaven, drain the source of Wood in the twelfth month of the preceding year. This is the method of needling to intercept and drain.

Thus it is said: do not lose the celestial timing, do not oppose the *qi*’s suitability, do not assist its dominance, do not encourage its retaliation—this is what is meant by masterful treatment.

The composition of medicinal formulas follows established patterns. As the canon states: one sovereign with two ministers is an odd-numbered formula; one sovereign with four ministers is an even-numbered formula; two sovereigns with three ministers is an odd-numbered formula; three sovereigns with six ministers is an even-numbered formula. For nearby conditions, use odd numbers; for distant conditions, use even numbers. For sweating, do not use odd numbers; for purging, do not use even numbers. When supplementing or treating the upper body, the formula should be mild; when supplementing or treating the lower body, the formula should be potent. Potency lies in thick *qi* and flavor, mildness in thin *qi* and flavor—each must suit its purpose.

It also states: one sovereign with two ministers is a small formula; one sovereign with three ministers and five assistants is a medium formula; one sovereign with three ministers and nine assistants is a large formula. For cold, treat with heat; for heat, treat with cold. For mild conditions, counter them; for severe conditions, follow them.

Furthermore: the medicinal that addresses the primary disease is the sovereign; that which assists the sovereign is the minister; that which responds to the minister is the envoy. These are not the upper, middle, and lower grades. The three grades clarify the distinction between good and harmful—this is the subtlety of medicinal use.

The *Divine Farmer’s Materia Medica* classifies medicinals into three grades: upper-grade as sovereigns, middle-grade as ministers, and lower-grade as assistants and envoys, distinguishing their beneficial or harmful natures. However, the way of taking medicinals need not always follow this. The sovereign is the one that addresses the primary disease, while the rest serve as ministers and envoys to complete the formula.

Thus, in the supplementation and drainage of the five movements and six *qi*, the five flavors differ, but the great principle remains the same. Those who compose formulas need not use all of them—one or two assistants will suffice to address the disease. For example, if sour is used for drainage, does one need an entire formula of sour medicinals? The sovereign may require only one or two flavors; the rest follow accordingly.

Some argue that in a year when Greater Angle prevails, Wood flourishes and Earth declines, one should drain the Liver channel and supplement the spleen and stomach. If everyone followed this, how could there be illness? This is not a comprehensive doctrine. How could everyone’s viscera and bowels be identical? Suppose the Liver is constitutionally deficient and the spleen *qi* constitutionally exuberant. In a Greater Angle year, if the Liver Wood becomes slightly replete and the spleen *qi* is thereby balanced, only then will harmony be achieved. If one were to immediately drain the Liver and supplement the spleen, this would be "supplementing the replete and draining the deficient," harming what is insufficient to benefit what is excessive—such a death would be the physician’s doing. Thus, the skilled practitioner must examine this carefully; the same applies to the other movements.

Diseases are treated with medicinals by addressing their root and branch—this may be called divine and sagely. Needling removes illness by targeting the points—this may be called skillful and ingenious. When applied with subtlety, it eliminates disease as swiftly as a drum responds to the beater or an arrow loosed from a crossbow—its efficacy is immediate. If misapplied, it harms just as swiftly. There is no room for error, for harming the patient only exacerbates the illness.

Why is this? The principles of all things under heaven are such that benefit comes slowly, while harm comes swiftly. Taking a medicinal yields gradual and subtle effects, but consuming a single harmful substance reveals its impact in an instant. From this, we see that creation is difficult while destruction is easy—this is the constant principle. How can one not be cautious?

The supreme sages bequeathed these subtle teachings, pitying the common people, repeatedly explaining and clarifying, engaging in dialogue to ensure understanding, fearing only that people would not grasp them fully. Yet later generations of physicians, dull in intellect and shallow in learning, fail to comprehend these principles, still clinging to obscure methods—how deplorable! The errors in the texts and the distance from the sages may account for this.

The *Plain Questions* predates the Five Classics, discussing astronomy, geography, human affairs, and the subtleties of the five phases, serving as the foundation of yin-yang and the wellspring of medicine. Its meanings are profound, its language expansive and fluent. From antiquity to the present, only Wang Bing has truly grasped its essence.

The *Plain Questions* records the dialogues between the Yellow Emperor and Qi Bo, Lei Gong, and Gui Yuqu, discussing the vastness of the great void, the revolutions of the five movements, and the comprehensive principles that govern all things. Its subtlety and precision are such that the numbers of heaven and earth cannot escape them, nor can the workings of ghosts and spirits evade them.

Scholars of the world often bow to its study, yet frequently lament their inability to comprehend it. A certain guest who favored this text once pointed to doubts regarding the five movements and six qi, journeying to Chanyuan to consult Hu Yuan. He asked: "In the fourth year of the Yuanfeng era, the year being *xinyou*, Yangming governs heaven as the upper *shang*, while Shaoyin resides in the earth as the lower *zhi*. The heavenly qi is dry, the earthly qi is hot, and the movement is that of lesser *yu*, signifying the year of water’s insufficiency—what is called the *heliu* (dried-up streams) epoch. Yet the Yellow River overflowed with great floods. How does this align with the name *heliu*? Pray, explain this to me."

Hu Yuan sighed deeply and said: "Profound indeed is your question. This is not something one of dull wit could grasp. Yet in the past, I once sat in attendance upon my teacher and heard the remnants of his discourse. My teacher’s discussion of the five phases began thus: they form images and adorn the heavens as the five stars, take shape and anchor the earth as the five peaks, their essence concealed within as the five viscera, their spirit moving without as the five officials. Extending further, their supreme virtue becomes the five constants, their harmony the five flavors, their manifestation the five colors, their expression the five sounds. Among plants, the five grains and five fruits adapt to different conditions; among animals, the five livestock and five insects belong to distinct categories.

For heaven’s number is five, and earth’s number is five. The five positions interact and each finds its correspondence. Herein lies the source of transformation and the movement of ghosts and spirits. Thus, heaven-one and earth-six unite in the north as water, governed by *bing* and *xin*. Earth-two and heaven-seven unite in the south as fire, governed by *wu* and *gui*. Heaven-three and earth-eight unite in the east as wood, governed by *ding* and *ren*. Earth-four and heaven-nine unite in the west as metal, governed by *yi* and *geng*. Heaven-five and earth-ten unite in the center as earth, governed by *jia* and *ji*. Among these five, some align with heaven’s triad, others with earth’s pair. Those of earth’s pair—fire and metal—are born of yin yet mature in yang. Those of heaven’s triad—water, wood, and earth—are born of the odd yet mature in the even. Though their numbers intertwine and the five differ, when establishing the yearly movements and epochs, their qi remains fundamentally balanced, never harming one another.

Thus, the balanced qi of wood values harmonious winds that generate and ascend without violent gales or uprooting storms. The balanced qi of fire values radiant brilliance without scorching flames or searing conflagrations. The balanced qi of earth values misty clouds and moist nourishment without prolonged downpours or sudden torrents. The balanced qi of metal values clear frost and crisp dew without bitter cold or destructive harm. The balanced qi of water values solemn stillness without excessive rain, frost, or hail.

Yet as yin and yang contend, cold and heat alternate, ascending and descending in order, waxing and waning in their seasons. One recedes as another advances, one wanes as another waxes—none can avoid these shifts. Thus, when a movement precedes heaven, its qi may become excessive; when it lags behind, its qi may become insufficient. Excess leads to restraining what it overcomes and bullying what it cannot. Insufficiency leads to what it overcomes becoming slight and resentful, while what it cannot overcome seizes the advantage and rides roughshod. Precisely because there is that which it cannot overcome, the strong may at times yield to the weak, and the weak may at times fear the strong. This is the natural order of things, an inevitable principle.

Let me illustrate: in the epoch of lesser *jue*, when yearly wood is insufficient, the one that bullies and rides it is metal. Metal, failing in virtue, overcomes the windy season with dryness, causing early white dew, premature harvest heat, its transformation marked by desolation, its harm by withered fall—named lesser *jue*, yet in truth akin to the year of greater *shang*. In the epoch of lesser *zhi*, when yearly fire is insufficient, the one that bullies and rides it is water. Water, failing in virtue, overcomes the hot season with cold, causing grim clouds and frozen earth, its transformation marked by biting frost, its harm by hail—named lesser *zhi*, yet in truth akin to the year of greater *yu*. In the epoch of lesser *gong*, when yearly earth is insufficient, the one that bullies and rides it is wood. Wood, failing in virtue, overcomes the damp season with wind, causing violent gales, flattened grass, and flying sand, its transformation marked by uprooting, its harm by scattering—named lesser *gong*, yet in truth akin to the year of greater *jue*. In the epoch of lesser *shang*, when yearly metal is insufficient, the one that bullies and rides it is fire. Fire, failing in virtue, overcomes the dry season with heat, causing scorched lands and blazing infernos, its transformation marked by melting, its harm by searing flames—named lesser *shang*, yet in truth akin to the year of greater *zhi*. In the epoch of lesser *yu*, when yearly water is insufficient, the one that bullies and rides it is earth. Earth, failing in virtue, overcomes the cold season with dampness, causing surging springs, overflowing rivers, and fish appearing in marshes, its transformation marked by sudden downpours, its harm by deluges—named lesser *yu*, yet in truth akin to the year of greater *gong*.

Comprehending this, one may infer that in the *heliu* epoch, the Yellow River’s great floods can indeed be deduced by analogy. Yet this is not all. All things under heaven, in their breath and movement, their growth and flourishing between heaven and earth, may either arise from harmonious qi or perish from discordant qi—none can escape the five phases. Harmonious qi refers to the absence of mutual conquest and retaliation. Discordant qi refers to the alternation of conquest and retaliation. When discordant qi contends, strife and perversity take shape, resentment and anger arise, each seeking dominance over the other. Even with the qi of strength, hardness, courage, and ferocity, how can one always prevail?"

There are always those that counterbalance, lying in wait behind. Thus, when Wood prevails, Metal counters to rescue Earth—and takes its name. If Wood does not flourish, Fire prevails, and Water counters to rescue Metal, whereupon hail descends. When Earth prevails, Wood counters to rescue Water, and grubs fail to breed. When Metal prevails, Fire counters to rescue Wood, and flowing waters do not freeze. When Water prevails, Earth counters to rescue Fire, and the valleys yield no harvest. Those who tyrannize without virtue shall have their violence turned back upon them; those who insult and exploit shall find insult and harm rebounded upon themselves. What goes forth from you returns to you—there has never been a conquest that did not meet its counterbalance. A subtle conquest elicits a subtle counterbalance; an extreme conquest elicits an extreme counterbalance. It is like the echo in an empty valley: swift or slow, sparse or dense, soft or loud, high or low—whatever you summon, it answers in kind. For between heaven and earth, if qi becomes unilaterally dominant and nothing comes to its rescue, then little of the ten thousand things would endure.

Thus, Wind, Heat, Dryness, Dampness, and Cold—each governs one qi. Growth, Flourishing, Transformation, Harvesting, and Storing—each governs one season. When they follow one another in harmony, they can cycle through mutual generation; when they contend in opposition, they can cycle through mutual rescue. Therefore, the five movements and their corresponding qi are like a steelyard: the high is weighed down, the low is lifted up, transformation is met with response, conquest is met with counterbalance. When transformation is met with response, qi is in equilibrium—this is the mutual accord of the five qi. When conquest is met with counterbalance, qi is in disequilibrium—this is the mutual destruction of the five qi. Equilibrium and accord mark the constancy of qi; disequilibrium and destruction reveal its changes. The ancients who understood this and were skilled in nurturing life never failed to regulate fullness and emptiness, guiding the spirit with the Dao. They did not lose the celestial signs, nor did they go against the proper timing of qi. They restrained what was in excess, without aiding its conquest; they assisted what was deficient, without abetting its counterbalance. Thus, joy, anger, sorrow, worry, and fear were unified and could not disturb the spirit, the ethereal soul, the corporeal soul, or the mind. With such cultivation, they could not be harmed by the spring breeze, autumn rain, winter frost, or summer heat. Though the ways of heaven change repeatedly—bringing famine, epidemics, or pestilence—these could not become afflictions.

Alas, where can one find a master of the round mechanism to discuss the five phases with?
