**Preface to *The Comprehensive Transformations of the Yi Diagrams* by Master Kongshan**

The *Daode* [*jing*], though but a few thousand words, is the sole scripture revered by our teaching—has there ever been an age that could dispense with it? Yet its commentaries and annotations proliferate endlessly, leaving one lost amid a tangle of obscurities, with no clear path to follow, only the ceaseless clamor of divergent branches.

Lei Siqi, devoted to learning with discernment, has delved deeply into this text, plumbing its hidden principles and original intent. He has composed an exegesis that harmonizes the shared ground of the Confucians and the Daoists, systematically refuting their divergences, organizing its threads with precision, and weaving them into a seamless whole. His work is no less than entering the very chamber of the Old Master, taking his seat to transmit its teachings.

For those who study this text to the end, thoroughly grasping its doctrines, the profound mystery within the mystery will become clear, and they will not lose sight of its direction. Passed down to future generations, this work may yet render no small benefit to our teaching.

*Preface by Zhang Zongyan, the Succession Celestial Master of Jianzhai, in the bingxu year of the Zhiyuan era.*

Master Lei Siqi, styled Qixian, was a lofty scholar of Linchuan. After the fall of the Song, he lived in seclusion in the Empty Mountains, where he composed *The Comprehensive Transformations of the Yi Diagrams in Divination*, *The Original Meaning of the Laozi*, *The Essential Meaning of the Zhuangzi*—in all, several dozen fascicles—as well as *Three Fascicles of Poems in Harmony with Tao [Yuanming]*. He abandoned Confucian robes, styling himself a Daoist master in the yellow cap, and befriended Zeng Zigong, the former magistrate of Chun’an, and Wu Cheng, now a Hanlin Academician. Scholars and gentlemen from all quarters, drawn to his reputation, often initiated correspondence with him, and those who heard him lecture invariably felt their own limitations.

Yuan Tong, Hanlin Academician and Lecturer-in-Waiting—a man of vast learning and refined character—praised his writings, noting their precise and compelling citations, their power to stir the spirit and exhaust transformations, and their capacity to fully embrace change in service of the Dao. He declared: *"To know Qixian is not to know Qixian’s intent."* In the present age, none are more esteemed as pillars of culture than Academician Wu; none are more celebrated for their writings than Academician Wu. Yet he also remarked: *"In discussing the *Laozi*, [Lei] is most profoundly attuned."* He further commended Lei’s poetry as profound, meticulous, vigorous, and extraordinary, bearing the spirit of Du [Fu] and Han [Yu]. Truly, these are words of insight.

Alas! Of old it was said that Yu Qing could not have written his works without poverty and sorrow, and that had the Grand Historian not suffered misfortune, the *Records of the Grand Historian* would never have been composed. How then could the aspirations of Master Lei, or the books he wrote, be measured by the standards of the common world? How could they be measured by the standards of the common world?

For nearly fifty years, I have read his writings and pondered the man behind them. Now, his disciples and grand-disciples—Fu Xingzhen and Zhou Weihe—have brought twenty scrolls of his poetry and prose to the capital, prompting me to inscribe these words in remembrance.

In the time of the late Emperor Shizu, after pacifying the lands south of the Yangtze, the court first summoned the thirty-sixth Heavenly Master to audience. Soon after, the Heavenly Master was entrusted with overseeing the Daoist teachings. Upon returning to his mountain, he respectfully invited Master Lei to serve as Lecturer in the Mysteries, instructing later generations in the profound learning. Though I was young at the time, I was already devoted to study and became his student. The Master often instructed me: *"Literature is but one branch of the Dao. The purpose of learning is to illuminate this Dao. Without illuminating the Dao, one cannot attain the learning of the sages and worthies."* From then on, I grew daily in self-awareness and resolve. By the time I came of age, I entered the service of my late teacher at court, and thus could not remain with Master Lei to complete my studies.

The Master had annotated *The Comprehensive Meaning of Changes in the Yi Diagrams and Divination*, *The Original Meaning of the Laozi*, and *The Essential Meaning of the Zhuangzi*, amounting to several dozen scrolls, along with twenty scrolls of poetry and prose. In the autumn of the second year of Zhishun, his disciple Fu Xingzhen dispatched his grand-disciple Zhou Weihe to present the annotated works in the capital, saying: *"Though Master’s annotations have been prefaced by Huang Gongzhen, Zeng Gong Ziliang, and Academician Wu Cheng, they lack a word from you to elucidate their significance. We humbly request your contribution."* I replied: *"Alas! The Master has been gone for thirty years. Though I cannot see him again, to see his annotated works is enough. Yet how could his learning be fully encompassed by these annotations? Those who come after and examine these works will know that the Master’s learning was far greater than what is contained here."*

Now in my old age, long settled at court, I have often wished to compile and preface the Master’s writings, but have not yet done so. Now that these works are finally assembled, how could I remain silent and fail to offer a word to illuminate the Master’s learning? Thus, I continue this preface.

The Master’s name was Siqi, styled Qixian. Scholars revered him as Master Kongshan. He was a native of Linchuan in Fuzhou.

On the first day of the sixth month of the third year of Zhishun, in the ren-shen year, Wu Quanjie wrote this preface.

The *Hetu* is none other than the Eight Trigrams. When the Diagram emerged, the sages took it as their model. Fu Xi observed the heavens above and the patterns below, drew from his own body and distant things, to connect with the virtue of the numinous and categorize the conditions of the myriad things. Thus, he first drew the Eight Trigrams and composed the *Yi*. Confucius affirmed that he took the Diagram as his model—how could he have deceived us?

The numbers of the Diagram are arranged in the Eight Trigrams, interacting and interweaving, blending heaven and earth, varying in threes and fives, all naturally so. Later generations, failing to grasp its numbers—truly only forty—with fifteen converging at the center, arbitrarily calculated the numbers of heaven and earth as fifty-five, adding to the forty by conjecture to seek harmony. Thus, their explanations grew ever more confused, and the confusion persists to this day.

After years of deep reflection and exhaustive study of various theories, I alone discerned the intent of the ancient sages. Thus, I composed *Comprehensive Changes* to transmit to scholars of the *Yi* across the ages, that together we might explore its true essence.

The methods of divination have also strayed from their original principles. These are appended in later chapters, and those who share this ancient commitment will surely recognize that I do not dare to mislead.

In the ninth month of the geng-zi year of the Dade era of the Great Yuan, Lei Siqi of Linchuan, styled Qixian, wrote this preface.

**The *Hetu***

The original numbers of the *Hetu* encompass the four cardinal directions and four corners, totaling forty, arranged in a circular formation. The five of heaven and ten of earth are left empty to activate the forty, thus combining the numbers of heaven and earth to make fifty-five.

**Diagram of the Forty Errors in the *Hetu***

The old diagram was altered into a square form, with the five of heaven placed solidly at the center, rendering it unusable for deduction. Here, I first present the circular form to demonstrate the original errors. Those who examine the subsequent diagrams will see the truth for themselves.

**Transmission on the *Hetu*, Part One**

Was it not from the *Hetu* that the *Yi* was composed, and from its numbers that the *Yi* arose? The origin of these numbers lies in nothing more than the Dao of one yin and one yang. The Dao of the *Yi* consists in nothing more than the odd and even numbers alternately dividing and uniting, generating and completing. Yang is odd, yin is even; when transformed and made fluid, their continuity is intricate yet never disordered. This is nothing more than what the *Great Commentary* calls "heaven one, earth two," extending to "heaven five and earth ten."

The *Yi* has the Supreme Ultimate. *Ji* means center, meaning one; the center is one. Thus, the Two Modes are generated. *Yi* means pair, meaning two; paired, they are two. The Two Modes generate the Four Images: one and one, not three, divided into four generating numbers. The Four Images generate the Eight Trigrams: combining six, seven, eight, and nine to form the four completing numbers. Four odds make yang; though yang has distinctions of generation and completion, each is aligned with the cardinal directions. Four evens make yin; though yin also has distinctions of generation and completion, they are evenly distributed among the four corners. Thus, from the cardinal directions, the corners are generated, and from the corners, the cardinal directions are completed.

One and three are odd numbers, the generative numbers of yang, yet they necessarily await the yin numbers six and eight to reach completion. Two and four are even numbers, the generative numbers of yin, yet they likewise depend on the yang numbers seven and nine to reach completion.

From north to east, one advances to three—this is the progressive sequence of yang’s generation. Yet within it is also contained the regressive sequence of yin’s completion, from eight to six, from east to north. From west to south, two advances to four—this is the progressive sequence of yin’s generation. Yet within it is also contained the regressive sequence of yang’s completion, from nine to seven, from south to west.

The four cardinal directions each position their yang odd numbers at the center; the four corners each attach their yin even numbers to the periphery. Yet why do the celestial number five and the terrestrial number ten—both harmonizing with the odd and even of yin and yang, both termed "generative" and "completive"—remain unseen in the positions of the four directions? It is because the Four Images originally lack five, and the Eight Trigrams originally lack ten.

Yet the *Yi*’s capacity to encompass all without excess and to achieve all without omission arises precisely from employing these virtual numbers—celestial five and terrestrial ten—to enact their practical function. In the *Hetu* formed from the Four Images and Eight Trigrams, one should not follow vulgar practice by placing five virtual points at the diagram’s center and appending ten points, falsely calling it fifty, unaware of its true application.

*Kan* begins with one at due north, and one with five becomes *Qian* six at the northwest. *Kun* divides with two at the southwest, and two with five becomes *Dui* seven at the west. *Zhen* emerges with three at the east, and three with five becomes *Gen* eight at the northeast. *Xun* attaches with four at the southeast, and four with five becomes *Li* nine at due south. Thus, yang gains five and becomes even; even gains five and becomes odd; yin gains five and becomes yang; odd gains five and becomes even—this is how generative numbers reach completion and how completive numbers arise.

Generative numbers are fewer than five, originally awaiting the regulation of the center. Thus, the yang numbers one and three establish their center beyond the completive numbers *Qian* six and *Gen* eight. Yin is multitudinous while yang is solitary—hence *Kan* is called "the Abyss." Completive numbers exceed five and cannot independently attain the center. Thus, the yin numbers two and four borrow five from within the yang of the completive numbers *Li* nine and *Dui* seven. Yang is central while yin is peripheral—hence *Li* is called "Clinging."

The Abyss must halt and seek movement—thus the Lord emerges in *Zhen*. Movement serves to unite, proceeding from division. Clinging must yield and delight—thus joy is spoken of in *Dui*. Joy serves to divide, proceeding from union.

The progressive sequence of yang, *Kan*, alone begins with the generative number, proceeding clockwise from north to meet *Xun* four in the east. The progressive sequence of yin, *Kun*, likewise follows as the next generative number, moving counterclockwise from the southwest to join *Zhen* three in the east—thus the generative numbers of yin and yang, three and four, both advance and unite. Examining the seasons, the fourth month is the *Qian* month, when the hexagram’s six yang lines intersect; the *Kun* month, when the hexagram’s six yin lines submit—hence *Xun* originally lacks *Qian*, and the Lord emerges in *Zhen* to align with *Xun*.

The regressive sequence of yang, *Li*, alone attains the center of completive numbers, proceeding clockwise from south to conclude in *Dui* seven. The regressive sequence of yin, *Gen*, truly begins by moving counterclockwise from the northeast, then north and west, culminating in *Qian* six—thus the completive numbers of yin and yang, six and seven, both recede and divide. Examining the seasons, the tenth month is the *Kun* month, when the hexagram’s six yin lines end; the *Qian* month, when the hexagram’s six yang lines bear the beginning—hence *Qian* originally lacks *Xun*, joy is spoken of in *Dui*, and conflict arises in *Qian*.

The celestial number begins with one—this is the entirety of the Supreme Ultimate, the correctness of yang. One splits into two—this is the division of the Supreme Ultimate, the peripherality of yin. One and two intermingle to form three—thus yang has already intoned and become odd. One and three transform to form four—thus yin subsequently follows and becomes even. From one and four intoning at the fore, their intersection and opposition form five; from two and three following behind, their intersection and opposition likewise form five—this is the doubling of five. Two fives interweave to form ten. Interlacing with celestial five—this is the interweaving. The ancient character for five was 久; the ancient and modern characters for ten were both 十—these are their images.

Transforming and penetrating them, this is how generative numbers reach completion and how completive numbers arise. *Kan* one and *Xun* four form five—thus *Qian* six and *Li* nine form fifteen, their sum being twenty. *Kun* two and *Zhen* three form five—thus *Dui* seven and *Gen* eight form fifteen, their sum likewise being twenty. Thus, the ten of one, two, three, and four complete the thirty of six, seven, eight, and nine—hence the *Hetu*’s numbers conclude at forty, virtually employing celestial five and terrestrial ten to constitute the fifty-five numbers of heaven and earth.

The generative numbers’ two fives form ten, though divided into yin and yang, both employ the yang of generative numbers to bear the yin of completive numbers, sustaining the northeast and east, thereby establishing the center. Doubling the fifteen to form thirty, they then alternate yin and yang, further employing the yin of completive numbers to serve the yang of generative numbers, sustaining the south and west, thereby enacting the center.

Establishment lodges in the virtual to embody the actual; enactment distributes the actual to employ the virtual. One, two, three, and four interweave the Four Images, their four virtual fives forming ten to constitute the essence of generative numbers. Six, seven, eight, and nine encompass the Eight Trigrams, their four actual fives dividing into twenty to constitute the function of completive numbers. The union of two fives to form ten has already, through orthogonality and intersection, divided into the twenty of the partial and the whole.

The division of twenty into fives thereby separates and unites to govern the full function of the celestial five. Ten intersects with five bodies, five cycles through ten functions.

Kan’s one and Li’s nine make ten; Kun’s one and Gen’s eight make ten; Zhen’s three and Dui’s seven make ten; Xun’s four and Qian’s six make ten—each pairing one generative with one completive. That one must pair with nine, and three with seven, constitutes the ten yang of the four cardinal directions and four odd positions. That two must pair with eight, and four with six, constitutes the ten yin of the four even positions and four corners. Thus, four fives originally form twenty, but now they become forty-four. Grouping by fives into tens serves to distribute the center among the actual tens of completive numbers; grouping by tens into fives serves to unite the center with the virtual five of generative numbers. Is it not that five fives make ten, ten tens make five, interweaving in crisscross patterns—whether vertically, horizontally, diagonally, inverted, or reversed—none fail to resolve into fifteen?

Grouping by fives to make ten ensures uniformity. The ten of one and nine resides in Kan and Li. Kan’s one dwells in the northern yin, where yang first arises—yang within yin, yin at its extreme generating yang. Yang’s one stands alone at the center’s inception. Li’s nine dwells in the southern yang, where yang reaches its ultimate—yang within yang, yang at its extreme generating yin, conjoined with Xun’s four and Kun’s two, the yin of generative numbers. Yin does not stand alone but arises at the zenith of nine yangs, where yang and yin merge to regulate the center. The *Shuo Gua* speaks of water and fire reaching one another without repelling, for they mark the solstices. The winter solstice emerges from Kan’s center; the summer solstice, yang at its extreme, harbors yin within.

The ten of two and eight resides in Kun and Gen; the ten of three and seven resides in Zhen and Dui. Yang ascends from below, rising from north and east to culminate in the south; yin descends from above, falling from south and west to culminate in the north. Their alternating advance and retreat to attain the center weave the warp of yin and yang, east and west, the path of opening and closing, the cycle of obstruction and passage. From Zhen’s emergence to Kun’s culmination, from joyful words to fulfilled speech, mountains and marshes exchange qi to mark the division of spring and autumn—thus bending to flourish, branching to connect.

As for the ten of four and six, residing in Xun and Qian, this further marks the beginning and end of yin and yang. Beginning and end, the ultimate transformations of heaven and earth, all changes and communications proceed from this regulation. How to clarify this? Yang originates in Qian and Kan, then Gen and Zhen advance from behind to unite in Xun of the southeast. Yin originates in Xun and Li, then Kun and Dui advance from ahead to divide in Qian of the northwest. Yang’s generative numbers—one and three—sum to four, which Xun encompasses; yin’s generative numbers—two and four—sum to six, which Qian encompasses. Doubling four yields the eight nodes, aligning with the sequence of the primary trigrams; doubling six yields six yins and six yangs, twelve months, extending the arrangement of the hexagrams.

Moreover, though Qian’s six arises from the union of two and four, it also forms by combining one and five. From five’s external intersection with one emerges six—five remains generative, while six becomes completive. Yet this follows the Dao of generation and completion. Moreover, when united with Kan’s one at the center, Qian uniquely transforms its old yin into nine. As for Xun, constrained by the generative numbers one and three to a limit of four, yang qi lacks numerical sufficiency to reach the center independently, thus borrowing the central five from Li’s nine to attain the center and oppose Kan. Only by combining four with five does it reach yang’s extreme position; at the extreme, it must revert. Thus, Xun and Li’s shared numbers explain why nine, as old yang, transforms into six.

This specifically addresses the pairing of Qian and Xun in tens and the transformation of nine and six. Yet Qian and Xun’s mutual division and union, their beginning and end, extend beyond this. Zhen’s three and Xun’s four unite as thunder and wind pressing against one another, as seen in the *Da* hexagram. Xun governs the fourth month, as previously explained. Dui’s seven and Qian’s six divide in the northwest, with Qian governing the tenth month—thus the pairing of Qian and Xun in tens does not suffice as an explanation. Qian is yang, yet its number is yin six, positioned before Kan; Dui is yin, yet its number is yang seven, positioned after Kun. Thus, within Qian and Dui’s six and seven, each borrows five for multiplication and division: transforming Qian’s six through the permutations of three and five, a Qian emerges before Kan—Qian’s one thus becomes Kan’s one; transforming Dui’s seven through the permutations of three and five, two Duis emerge after Kun—Kun’s two thus enters Dui’s two.

Though Qian and Dui divide through the completive numbers six and seven, Kan and Kun arise through the generative numbers one and two within the center. Yet Dui is not named two, while Kun is named two; Kan is named one, while Qian is not named one. That Qian does not name its one arises from its embodiment of non-entry into numbers, encompassing the five and ten of generative and completive functions across the eight trigrams as the totality of the Great Ultimate. Speaking in terms of numbers: heaven as one, earth as two, heaven and earth establish their positions. Speaking in terms of qi: dividing yin and dividing yang, yin and yang press against one another. The *Yi*’s operation within them begins here—thus yang’s advancing generative numbers serve as yin’s retreating completive numbers, and yin’s advancing generative numbers serve as yang’s retreating completive numbers. Alternately advancing and retreating, alternately generating and completing, this ceaseless generation of the *Yi*, the Dao of one yin and one yang, knows no end.

Is this not the most refined, most mutable, and most numinous? Moreover, the *Yi* unifies its three lines to thereby generate the eight trigrams; doubling its three lines, it thereby interweaves them to form the sixty-four hexagrams. As for the formation of hexagram lines, they are limited to six. Yet in *Qian* alone, its three lines culminate in what is called nine—why is this? Generally, in the configuration of hexagram lines as illustrated, five serves as the center; only with nine does the center emerge, for the center resides beyond the five that is already centered. The sixth line as the uppermost line is but the surplus of the hexagram’s qi. The generative numbers having reached their end, the completive numbers begin their course—this is how the nine and six lodge their emptiness and fullness. *Kun* arises from the completive number six and is full; *Qian* culminates in the completive number nine and is empty. Six marks the beginning of *Kun*’s completive numbers, appended to its position in the diagram, thereby lodging *Qian*’s nine. Nine marks the end of *Qian*’s completive numbers, appended to its position in the hexagram, thereby aligning with *Kun*’s six. The six, residing at the extreme of the retreating numbers, advances to occupy the position before the center of *Kan*; the nine, residing at the extreme of the advancing numbers, retreats to attach itself behind the radiance of *Li*. Thus, the six in the hexagram still has a position, while the nine in the hexagram has no position and instead lodges its position within the six. Their alternation as nine and six—nine being empty and six being full—thereby jointly manifests their substance and function.

Furthermore, *Qian* is old yang, *Kun* is old yin—they are called father and mother. Lesser yin and lesser yang are called the six sons and daughters. The numbers of lesser yin and lesser yang are seven and eight. *Qian*’s primal power employs nine; *Kun*’s primal power employs six. Together, the sixty-four hexagrams originally possess seven and eight, yet only nine and six are present. The sons and daughters are likewise transformed by their parents and thereby undergo transformation themselves. All things are born of the mother, yet none can name the virtue or power of the father within them—thus *Kun* is still seen in the form of six lines, while *Qian*’s nine possesses its ninefold function yet none can fathom the origin of its form. This is why the *Yi* is numinous without fixed direction and without fixed form.

Heaven’s one combines with heaven’s five to make six; earth’s two combines with earth’s four to make six. Five and six occupy the position of mutual generation and completion within the ten numbers. In the system of *na jia*, *wu* and *ji* serve as the center; *wu* is lodged in the center of *Kan*, and *ji* is lodged in the center of *Li*. *Wu* and *ji* are precisely five and six, placed within the centers of *Kan* and *Li* to reveal their mutual centrality. Six combines two and four as the beginning of earth’s completive numbers, appearing in the hexagram *Kun* as: “Dragons battle in the wild,” which is to battle *Qian*. Suspected of being yang yet resented as excessive yang, it reveals yin’s dependence on yang—thus its Dao is exhausted. *Kun*’s use of six does not exceed: “Favorable to perpetually uphold correctness.” Heaven’s numbers—one, five, and nine—are what is called the beginning, middle, and end; nine is the completion of heaven’s numbers, appearing in the hexagram *Qian* as: “The exalted dragon has regret.” Fullness cannot endure and cannot serve as the beginning; yet *Qian*’s use of nine governs all under heaven and reveals the celestial principle—this is its ceaseless vigor, which depends on nothing from yin. One and nine combine to form *Qian*, making their number ten, yet ten is lodged beyond heaven’s nine, where its function is inexhaustible.

The Dao of earth has no completion, yet succession has an end—this, too, lies herein. This is a general discussion of the nine and six, which may be pondered in the mind. The arrangement of the *River Chart* was originally established for the trigrams; now it extends to the substance and function of the hexagrams as well. The trigrams and hexagrams, without exception, consist of one yin and one yang, generated through the division and combination of odd and even numbers to produce beginnings and completions. One, two, three, and four, with five, are all generative numbers—one through four are their actual substance, while five is their empty function. Six, seven, eight, and nine, with ten, are all completive numbers—six through nine are their actual substance, while ten is their empty function. The four images lack five, the eight trigrams lack ten—this is perfectly clear. Each of the four directions possesses ten numbers, totaling forty; each of the four corners contains five numbers, totaling twenty. Twenty is four times five, with the empty function occupying half; forty is eight times five, with the actual substance encompassing the whole. Thus, the four images combine with the eight trigrams, totaling forty.

Five is the substance of establishing the center and generating; ten is the function of enacting the center and completing. Moreover, five is divided among the completive numbers six, seven, eight, and nine, where yin numbers are few and yang numbers are many—yin is inherently partial, while yang is inherently correct. Five, unable to attain the center, is lodged in the partiality of the four corners; ten combines beyond the generative numbers one, two, three, and four, where yang numbers are few and yin numbers are many—yin is also partial, while yang is also correct. Ten completes the center and resides in the correctness of the four directions—thus correctness is the center, and the center is correctness. Five, as the beginning, establishes correctness within the empty function’s center; ten, as the middle, establishes the center beyond the actual function—both serve as the central Dao of one yin and one yang. Since within yin and yang there is again yin and yang, within substance and function there is again substance and function, emptiness and fullness, beginning and end—end and beginning transform, generation and completion mutually sustain one another, inexhaustibly.

Moreover, five times five makes twenty-five, which is also a heavenly number. Six times five and five times six, three times ten and ten times three make thirty, which is also an earthly number. One with nine, two with eight, three with seven, and four with six—each making ten—and the ten of the original numbers’ empty function, when arranged in fives and tens, make the fifty of the *Great Expansion*.

Yet that initial omen of the One, lodged in the central Five, conceals its function within the primordial form of Heaven—thus it emerges beyond the fifty of the *Great Expansion* and the fifteen, beyond what the *Great Expansion* can employ. How then could one know that the function of the unused is precisely what enables the *Great Expansion* to function? From this, we perceive that what is called the Dao of one yin and one yang, interwoven through threes and fives, encompasses the fifty-five numbers of Heaven and Earth—through which transformations are accomplished and the spirits set in motion. Here lies the means to observe the traces of all under Heaven, to witness its movements, and to comprehend the workings of the divine. This is how Fuxi followed the *River Diagram* to compose the *Book of Changes*.

Confucius, in his commentary on the *Changes*, spoke of its utmost refinement, utmost mutability, and utmost spirituality. Ah! This is its utmost spirituality indeed.

*Second Scroll of the* *Diagrams of the Changes: Penetrating Mutations*
*By Lei Siqi, Daoist of Linchuan*

Within the *River Chart* transmission lies the principle of Heaven and Earth, wherein numbers invariably operate. Yet sometimes numbers exceed, sometimes they fall short. Precisely through this excess and deficiency, a central regulation is established. Thus, though the numbers of yin and yang, odd and even, may divide or unite, be empty or full, advance or retreat, there exists within them a central Dao of natural mutual generation. That which is called "the Dao of one yin and one yang" divides one into Heaven and Earth, unites above and below into Qian and Kun, separates Heaven and Earth above and below into the four directions, and converges at the central origin. Qian and Kun, yin and yang, unite to form the four seasons, yet within them lies the potential for division—all is one and the same Dao.

When speaking of Heaven and Earth in terms of form, north and south serve as the warp, with Heaven above and Earth below. The forms of water, fire, wood, and metal may be diagrammed and divided, hence it is said: "No images surpass those of Heaven and Earth," for their vastness matches Heaven and Earth. When discussing yin and yang in terms of qi, east and west serve as the weft, with Qian as yang and Kun as yin. The qi of winter, summer, spring, and autumn may likewise be ordered and united, hence it is said: "No transformations surpass those of the four seasons," for their mutability matches the four seasons. In these two aspects, the origin differs.

The four directions possess a center; the central origin establishes the body, upon which the Four Images and Eight Trigrams are founded. The four seasons possess the fifth; the fifth origin establishes the essence, upon which the four seasons and eight solar terms proceed. When Confucius composed the *Great Commentary*, he did not preserve the *River Chart* but specifically retained the numbers of Heaven and Earth, demonstrating that if one grasps the numbers, the Chart resides within them.

The numbers of the Chart arise with Heavenly One and are completed by Earthly Six; they arise with Earthly Two and are completed by Heavenly Seven; they arise with Heavenly Three and are completed by Earthly Eight; they arise with Earthly Four and are completed by Heavenly Nine. As for the generation and completion of Heavenly Five and Earthly Ten, from whence are they sought? It is like searching for a steed by following its tracks. Thus, structuring the five within the void of the Eight Trigrams still allows room for their numbers, but structuring the ten within it leaves no space for their numbers.

To know the generation and completion of numbers yet not comprehend their underlying principles is merely to grasp their outward appearance. Without attaining the ancient sages' intent in "establishing the heart of Heaven and Earth" and "setting the ultimate standard for the people," one may sigh for a thousand years—such is the past as it is the present.

Odd numbers all belong to Heaven; even numbers all belong to Earth. That which arises from Heaven is completed by Earth; that which arises from Earth is completed by Heaven. Their nature as Heaven and Earth lies solely in the advance and retreat of yin and yang, the function and substance of odd and even, and their division and union. The *Shuogua* states: "Three for Heaven, two for Earth, relying on numbers; observing changes in yin and yang to establish the trigrams; expressing through firmness and softness to generate the lines." The *Great Commentary* says: "Intermingling through threes and fives, interweaving their numbers; penetrating their changes, thus forming the patterns of Heaven and Earth; exhausting their numbers, thus determining the images of the world." If not for the supreme mutability of the world, who could partake in this? Its subtlety in fully realizing the most wondrous function lies in the method of the *River Chart*.

Numbers begin with one, center on five, and conclude with ten. Centering on five divides the bias of the four; concluding with ten unites the correctness of the eight. At the beginning of one, its entire body is without excess or deficiency, and thus cannot be employed—only the center is attainable. Having entrusted its one to arise within five, it then entrusts its one to be completed within ten to conclude. Thus, the Four Images possess five, the Eight Trigrams possess ten, all having numbers yet no fixed positions. The five generates their bias; the ten completes their correctness. As for the one, it becomes untraceable, appearing only in the five and ten that serve as the center, aligning above.

Thus, though one may seek its underlying reason, it remains unattainable. I recall in childhood observing a herdboy playing what was called the "eight-pattern game," its board nothing more than a grid with the character for ten inscribed within. At the time, I deeply despised it as utterly vulgar and base, never giving it a second thought. Who would have known that at seventy, I would come to understand its truth? That which the common people use daily yet do not comprehend, that which they follow throughout their lives yet do not recognize as the Dao—did the ancients ever deceive us?

For what is now called "○" was anciently "○"; what is now "five" was anciently " "; what is now "ten" was anciently "十," drawn as a cross within "○." From this, the method of fifteen becomes apparent. Moreover, with a single stroke beneath the ten, the centrality of Earth's pattern becomes evident—hence it is called the Central Soil. The vertical stroke of " " reveals north and south as the warp, Heaven's honor and Earth's humility, the positions of Heaven and Earth. The horizontal stroke of "－" reveals east and west as the weft, the division of yin and yang, the alignment of yin and yang. Over time, the biases of the four corners each attain balance; the correctness of the four directions likewise stabilizes their qi in mutual advance and retreat, reciprocal generation and completion, "following the five and ten to establish the central Dao."

Thus, the fifteen of the *River Chart* and the fifty of the *Great Expansion* both possess the numbers ten and five in emptiness, employing them while their actual positions remain formless. To understand the Dao of ten and five as the center—beginning with one, centering on five, and concluding with ten—ten is one. Seeking one through ten, that one is here, visible to the eye and attainable in the heart. After extensive investigation, I have tentatively composed *Since the Yi*, wherein the convergence of ten as the center and Soil is best captured by Sima's *Hidden Depths*. Yet *Hidden Depths* takes the nine as its foundation and the ten as its apex, arranging them into fifty-five numbers as names—thus, its center is already substantiated, not employed in emptiness.

The principle of the *River Chart*’s empty five and lodged ten does not align with this. Though the *River Chart*’s numbers total fifty-five, its actual substantive count is precisely forty, with the remaining fifteen existing in emptiness to operate within the forty—merely serving as a general tally, not possessing any substantive position. The terms "three," "two," and "three-five" refer to the application of their numerical transformations. "Three" arises from the variation of one and two. From one, one divides itself to become two, initiating mutual opposition, so that two is seen while one is not. That one then emerges from within two as three. In the method of three, this constitutes a minor completion, where the three lines stand as humanity’s participation between heaven and earth to generate life. Accumulating three minor completions, tripling the three to unite with Qian’s "nine in use," marks the inception of three—precisely what the yang odd numbers of heaven originally signify.

"Two" arises from one generating two, rising in opposition to stand in parallel, thus symbolizing the Two Modes. From this, two is doubled to represent the Four Images. If one originally becomes two and then three, with one forming three, how could two—itself an opposition of one—not double its three to form a counter-opposition? Thus, refining it by tripling its two yields six, uniting with Kun’s "six in use." This is the inception of two, doubling the Three Powers, so that six lines form a hexagram, six positions compose a pattern—just as the yin pairs of earth originally signify.

From this, tripling the two twos and intersecting the nine to unite them forms five. Doubling the two fives yields ten. Ten appears beyond the three and nine, serving as the lodging place of one. How is this clarified? The tripling, doubling, quintupling, and decupling are all human constructs, yet what naturally harmonizes with heaven and earth lies in the blood-grain of the three lines and the rain-tilt of the two lines. Even in the "five-maintained" and "ten-maintained," humanity stands at the center or beside the weft—here, one may silently recognize the ancient establishment of mind and pole, which resides in this.

One must triple the three threes and double the three twos—this is the minor completion of three and two. Thus, tripling the three threes forms the three of heaven, and doubling the three twos forms the two of earth. The numbers of heaven and earth are thereby refined, united, and divided. Yet that initial number not entering into use is lodged in ten to operate at its center, dividing and uniting to complete its central system—this is one. Seeking it in the chart’s numbers, like a ring without end, that one remains unseen, while only ten is visible. Tripling the three threes and doubling the three twos, united in grandeur, reveals how heaven and earth merge into a single beginning and end.

As for the so-called "three-five interweaving," it remains unexplored. "Three-five interweaving" refers to numbers before five being fewer than five, thus using five as the base; numbers after five being greater than five, thus tripling with five. Within this, five is interwoven and interlaced to enact the method of central regulation. Yet the *Great Commentary* states that only by "permeating their transformations through three and five, interweaving their numbers," can one "complete the patterns of heaven and earth" and "determine the images of the world." This is not easily understood. Since it instructs with "three-five interweaving," how can one not investigate its underlying principle?

After examining works since the *Changes* was first devised—nearly two thousand years—scholars have scarcely probed this. Even the *Dragon Chart*’s continuation offers no elucidation, which is deeply perplexing. Through painstaking effort and profound inquiry, I suddenly awakened to the realization that it concerns nothing else. The *Great Commentary* says: "The heavenly numbers are five, the earthly numbers are five; the five positions interact and each has its union." This is the chart’s numbers. Heaven-one begins at Kan, earth-six attaches to Kun—the union of one and six, summed, is seven. Tripling the heavenly five and interweaving five within, aligning them for examination, their heads and tails are each one. Thus, Kan’s one is yang, establishing the pole at the northern inception; Qian’s six is yin, attaching to the northwest weft.

Heaven-three emerges from Zhen, earth-eight attaches to Gen—the union of three and eight, summed, is eleven. Tripling the heavenly five and interweaving five within, aligning them for examination, their heads and tails are each three. Thus, Zhen’s three is yang, standing at the eastern center; Gen’s eight is yin, attaching to the northeast weft. These two proceed from yang to yin. Earth-two divides in the southwest as Kun; heaven-seven aligns in the west as Dui—the union of two and seven, summed, is nine. Tripling the heavenly five and interweaving five within, aligning them for examination, their heads and tails are each two. Kun’s two is yin, first residing at the southwest weft; Dui’s seven is yang, newly standing at the western center.

Earth-four spreads to Xun, heaven-nine centers at Li—the union of four and nine, summed, is thirteen. Tripling the heavenly five and interweaving five within, aligning them for examination, their heads and tails are each four. Xun’s four is yin, retreating to guard the southeast weft; Li’s nine is yang, facing south to stand at the polar position. These two proceed from yin to yang.

Thus we understand why Qian, Dui, Gen, and Li correspond to six, seven, eight, and nine—precisely the one, two-not-three, and four of Kan, Kun, Zhen, and Xun. Therefore, yang attains five and becomes yin; yin attains five and becomes yang. Even numbers attain five and become odd; odd numbers attain five and become even. Qian’s six is one-five-and-six; Dui’s seven is two-five-and-seven; Gen’s eight is three-five-and-eight; Li’s nine is four-five-and-nine.

From this we further understand the transformations of tripling and quintupling: tripling Qian and Kan, tripling Gen and Zhen, from north to east; tripling Dui and Kun, tripling Li and Xun, from west to south. Tripling to divide, quintupling to unite—this is called "tripling and quintupling to transform." Interlacing to divide reveals their tripling; summing to unite reveals their positions—this is called "interlacing and summing their numbers." And what is interlaced and summed is precisely the tripling and quintupling. Scattered and interlaced, they resemble the doubling of one, two, three, four; divided and gathered to sum them, they return to the recombination of six, seven, eight, nine. This is called "the five positions mutually attaining and each having its union"—how could it ever be like later generations arbitrarily placing five empty points at the center of the diagram and claiming this to be the heavenly five? Thus we understand that the numbers of the River Diagram, whether vertical or horizontal, forward or reverse, are none other than the natural unfolding of the five, not requiring artificial contrivance or forced interpretation to make them so.

The ascending progression of advancing numbers begins at the northern and eastern extremes and reaches the south; the descending regression of retreating numbers begins at the southern and western termini and returns to the north—all follow the movement of yang numbers, with yin naturally following. As for the progression of yin numbers, it moves from Kun’s two to Xun’s four; its regression moves from Gen’s eight to Qian’s six. Yet yin does no more than serve yang—though myriad transformations occur, it is merely the alternation of one yin and one yang.

Thus, quintupling Kan’s one produces Qian’s six in the north; quintupling Kun’s two produces Dui’s seven in the west; quintupling Zhen’s three produces Gen’s eight in the east; quintupling Xun’s four produces Li’s nine in the south—here we see the origin of numerical regulation in tripling and quintupling. Then, reducing Zhen’s latter one to regress, augmenting Gen’s full eight to nine, and tripling the three, we have the initial regulation of tripling. Dividing Zhen’s middle two to unite with Xun’s full four, splitting into six, we have the continuation of the two. Only Li’s full number naturally attains nine, standing at the center of beginning and end, tripling the three—this is the central regulation of tripling. Combining Kun’s full two with the four at Dui’s middle to unite as six, we have the alternation of the two at the end. Severing Dui’s latter three to supplement Qian’s full six, tripling the three—this is the final regulation of tripling. Herein lie the essential principles of "tripling heaven and doubling earth."

Whether interlaced to divide or summed to unite, whether tripling or doubling, the regulation of tripling and doubling must also involve quintupling. This is the great universal transformation and the supreme numerical principle of tripling and quintupling. Confucius spoke of "penetrating its transformations to complete the patterns of heaven and earth; exhausting its numbers to determine the images of the world." Who but one of utmost precision, utmost transformation, and utmost spirit could partake in this? Truly his words are so.

Thus, "tripling heaven" completes the image, referring to Qian. Here, the three threes of yang numbers govern Qian’s primal use of nine, wherein tripling contains doubling, and yang reveals yin. "Doubling earth" emulates the model, referring to Kun. Here, the two twos of yin numbers emulate Qian, thus tripling its two to six, uniting Kun’s primal use of six, wherein doubling employs tripling, and yin reveals yang. From this we see how one yin and one yang, transformed and penetrated throughout heaven and earth, necessarily involve tripling and doubling. Tripling and doubling necessarily involve nine and six.

Moreover, from the Supreme Ultimate come the Two Modes; from the Two Modes come the Four Images; from the Four Images come the Eight Trigrams—nothing more than the generating numbers one, two, three, four and the completing numbers six, seven, eight, nine. As for five and ten, though they exist as numbers, they serve only as virtual functions and are never listed among the substantial forms of the trigrams. For from one divided comes two; from one and two comes three; from one and three comes four—thus the Four Images are established. The Four Images originate from five; the heavenly five is merely the virtual center without substance. Yet one and four make five; two and three also make five—thus two quintuplets. Combined with the original heavenly five, they are further tripled and quintupled. Moreover, one, two, three, four naturally sum to ten, with the heavenly five at the center—tripled and quintupled to fifteen.

The heavenly numbers one, three, five sum to nine; the earthly numbers two and four sum to six, and one and five also make six. One and six make seven; two and five also make seven. One and seven make eight; three and five also make eight. One and eight make nine; four and five also make nine—thus the Eight Trigrams are arrayed. One and nine make ten; one, two, three, four naturally also make ten. The Eight Trigrams inherently lack ten, for ten has no place to contain its form. Using one, two, three, four, its ten is merely nine. Ten as nine is the return to one—thus ten is one.

The numbers of the River Diagram, ten in each of the four directions, show Kan’s one and Li’s nine opposing to make ten, with the virtual function of the central heavenly five making fifteen; Kun’s two and Gen’s eight opposing to make ten, with the virtual function of the central heavenly five making fifteen; Zhen’s three and Dui’s seven opposing to make ten, with the virtual function of the central heavenly five making fifteen; Xun’s four and Qian’s six opposing to make ten, with the virtual function of the central heavenly five making fifteen. From this we know that the heavenly five and earthly ten, though lacking substantial form and position, virtually employ their numbers to perpetually interweave and quintuple.

Thus is the method of interweaving and quintupling. Interweaving and quintupling serve to interlace the two—hence the numbers of the River Diagram are precisely forty in substance, yet through the virtual numbers of heavenly five and earthly ten they are universally applied in calculation, totaling fifty-five for all the numbers of heaven and earth.

Seven is young yang, eight is young yin; their union indeed makes fifteen, yet their generative numbers are incomplete and incapable of transformation. Nine is old yang, six is old yin; their union likewise makes only fifteen, yet the generative numbers—one, three, five forming nine, and two, four forming six—allow six to transform into nine, and nine into six. This is why the hexagrams of the *Zhouyi* exclude seven and eight, fundamentally relying on nine and six. Through interweaving and quintupling, through the three of heaven and the two of earth, all transformations arise from this.

The numbers of the four directions each total ten; combining their nines yields twenty-seven, doubling their sixes yields twelve, and summing these gives thirty-nine—yet one is deliberately omitted. Where then is this one employed? Thus, by preserving this one within the ten, forty is achieved.

Therefore, Kan establishes its axis at one, gathering its ten to return to itself, thereby erecting the Great Center and initiating the generative numbers while completing the fulfilled numbers. Withdrawn and concealed in secrecy, its ultimate depth remains unfathomed. Manifest in the one of the three of heaven and the two of earth, which is reckoned as ten, this is what is called the Center. The Center is where the union of numbers cannot attain their mean, yet causes them to intersect at the center—thus centering what is not centered.

From Kan’s northern one, the center is first established; the second emulates this by dividing Dui’s western seven to form a center; the third emulates it by dividing Zhen’s eastern three to form a center; the fourth emulates it by dividing Li’s southern nine to form a center. Every center is established at ten, all through the union of numbers at ten and their bisection—this is merely to lodge the one within. Only Kan’s one, uniquely without employable function, is singularly established at the center, its function being the function of non-function. The function of having function is the function of the Center—is this not supremely great?

Thus, though Kan’s one does not participate in the functions of the three, the two, or the five, it is employed to regulate the system of the three of heaven, the two of earth, and the interweaving and quintupling. Therefore, the three of heaven does not begin with Kan but with Gen.

The three is nothing other than the transformation of one and two previously described. When one divides itself to become one, arising in opposition, two appears while one is no longer seen. This one further interweaves from within the two—hence it is called the three. This is the minor completion of the threefold regulation. Yet all interlacing of the two, the three, and the five originates here—thus is demonstrated the general principle of the three.

*Yitu Tongbian*, Scroll Two, concludes.

*Yitu Tongbian*, Scroll Three
By Linchuan Daoist Lei Siqi

The *Hetu* was transmitted downward. Daoists take the sun and moon as the Changes, initially treading the well-worn path of convention—yet not entirely so. Upon thorough investigation of the *Great Commentary*, however, it proves not entirely otherwise.

It is said: Qian and Kun—are they the hidden essence of the *Changes*? When Qian and Kun take their places, the *Changes* is established between them. If Qian and Kun were destroyed, the primordial would reveal the *Changes*. If the *Changes* were not visible, Qian and Kun would nearly cease to be. Yet this still does not clarify what the visible *Changes* truly is.

Thus it is further said: Qian and Kun—are they the gates of the *Changes*? Qian is the yang entity; Kun, the yin entity. Yin and yang unite their powers, and hardness and softness take form, □ thereby embodying the compositions of heaven and earth and penetrating the virtue/power of the numinous. Here, the *Changes* as a thing has a form that can be seen.

It is further said: Opening the door is called Qian; closing the door, Kun. One closing and one opening is called change; ceaseless coming and going, penetration. What is seen is called image; what takes shape is called vessel. To regulate and employ it is called method; its beneficial use in ingress and egress, universally employed by the people, is called the numinous. Here, the *Changes* as form is seen to have its use.

Therefore it is said: Heaven and earth take their positions, and the *Changes* operates between them. It is said: No image is greater than heaven and earth; no transformation is greater than the four seasons; no suspended image is more luminous than the sun and moon. It is said: Vastness matches heaven and earth; transformation matches the four seasons; the principles of yin and yang match the sun and moon. In all these instances, the sun and moon are invoked as proof—thus the *Changes* is confirmed as complete.

The *Changes* aligns with heaven and earth, capable of encompassing the Dao/Way of heaven and earth. Gazing upward to observe the images in heaven and downward to observe the patterns on earth, the image-forming is called Qian, which is the sun; the pattern-imitating is called Kun, which is the moon. The sun’s image corresponds to the number of Li, culminating in nine; the moon’s image corresponds to the number of Kan, beginning with one. Every nine must pair with six, but here it speaks of one—one combines with heaven’s five to make six, Kan’s one and Qian’s six form the generation and completion of water, which is the moon’s essence. Moreover, heaven and earth are the forms of Qian and Kun, while Qian and Kun are the functions of heaven and earth. Only when heaven and earth are fixed in position do the qi and shapes of above and below have their unchanging divisions. Thus, when Qian and Kun take their places, the numbers of yin-yang form and function undergo transformation. Heaven and earth have constant forms yet do not reveal their functions; yin and yang have constant functions yet do not exhaust their forms. Only the sun and moon fully manifest both form and function—hence their principles are particularly highlighted to pair with yin and yang.

Moreover, the teachings that model heaven and earth without transgression and complete the myriad things without omission specifically penetrate the Dao/Way of day and night. Is the Dao/Way of day and night difficult to know? The common people use it daily yet remain unaware. Let us briefly outline its general principles:

Qian, the yang entity, has the sun as its kind; Kun, the yin entity, has the moon as its kind. When yin and yang take their places and unite their powers, the four seasons align in order, the sun and moon unite in brightness—these too are kinds. Opening the door as Qian: proximately, the sun’s dawn and the moon’s first quarter; distantly, the spring equinox when day and night divide, called "opening." Closing the door as Kun: proximately, the sun’s dusk and the moon’s last quarter; distantly, the autumn equinox when day and night divide, called "closing." Gazing upward to observe their formed images: the sun’s day, the moon’s fullness, summer’s long daylight. Looking downward to examine their imitated patterns: night’s division, the moon’s new moon, winter’s short daylight.

Thus, when the sun departs, the moon arrives; when the moon departs, the sun arrives—the sun and moon mutually advance, and brightness is born. When cold departs, heat arrives; when heat departs, cold arrives—cold and heat mutually advance, and the year is completed. Change is the image of advance and retreat; hardness and softness are the images of day and night. The sun and moon’s movements, one cold and one hot—thus it is said: The Dao/Way of heaven and earth is steadfast in observation; the Dao/Way of the sun and moon is steadfast in brightness. The movements of all under heaven are steadfast in the One.

Steadfast in the One: the centers of the solstices and equinoxes are all One. Yet this specifically refers to the movements of all under heaven being steadfast in the One, which precisely arises from Kan’s one. The yang qi first stirs at the midnight division—this is truly steadfast in the One. The yang qi of the year revives at the winter solstice’s beginning—here its steadfastness in the One is even more evident. Kan’s number is one; Li’s number is nine. Kan and Li take one and nine as Qian. Li is the sun; Kan is the moon. The sun and moon must unite at the moon’s first day, the new moon. Yet the sun is not called "new moon"; only the moon is called "new moon." The south is not called "new moon"; only the north is called "new moon." The new moon moves in reverse; reversing to meet the sun, it is called "new moon." Observing the new moon’s pattern reveals the moon’s reverse movement. The *Shuogua* says: The *Changes* is reckoned in reverse. The *Book [of Documents]* also says: Level at the new moon. The principles of the *Changes* are indeed the same.

Proceeding from this to the *Changes* as the sun and moon—could their suspended images not be called luminously manifest? Thus, the moon waxes to fullness in three and five, the lesser yin and yang of seven and eight; it wanes in three and five, the elder yin and yang of nine and six. In sum, the earth number thirty completes the month—another method of the *Hetu*. The celestial circuit is 365¼ degrees; the sun moves one degree daily. The winter south and summer north mark the central extremes of cold and heat. The moon moves slightly more than thirteen degrees daily, meeting the sun twelve times in conjunctions—thus the year regularly comprises six yin and six yang months, twelve in total. Heaven and earth are regulated, and the four seasons are completed. The moon’s movements are indeed laborious.

That which names *Kan* as the "Hexagram of Labor" does not refer merely to water. This singular yang of *Kan* does not enter the system of *san-liang* (three-two) or *san-wu* (three-five), but rather stands out as the inception of movement, the beginning of the center. In synthesis, heaven and earth are the *ti* (substance/body), while yin and yang are the *yong* (function/activation). *Ti* is form, by which qi is activated; *yong* is qi, by which form is embodied. Heaven embodies its form through qi, thus its form envelops earth below; earth activates its qi through form, thus its qi ascends to heaven above. Here, heaven’s qi wholly embodies earth’s form, while earth’s form wholly activates heaven’s qi—this further clarifies the *san-liang* system.

The beginning of one’s triad and the end of three’s triad both belong to heaven, yet they are positioned below the level earth. For example: *Qian*, the elder yang, is appended to the completed number of six yin, stationed in the yin region of the northwest, at the extreme of the retiring sequence’s end. *Gen*, the lesser yang, is appended to the completed number of eight yin, stationed in the yang region of the northeast, standing at the inception of the advancing sequence. Yet the singular yang at the center of *Kan*, not employed in the *san-liang* system, arises from the primal one of spontaneous generation, standing distinct amid the yin-yang cycle of beginning and end. It initiates the year’s first month, the moon’s first phase, embodying the *Yi*’s meaning of ceaseless generation—thus fully demonstrating that earth’s *ti* wholly activates heaven.

The beginning of two’s pair and the end of two’s pair both belong to earth, yet they are arrayed above the level earth. For example: *Xun*, the lesser yin, though attached to earth’s generative number of four yin, is positioned in the southeast, where yang qi has already advanced past the midpoint. *Kun*, the elder yin, though attached to earth’s generative number of two yin, remains in the southwest, where yang qi has not yet descended to the midpoint. Moreover, both earthly pairs jointly uphold the center, aligning with the polar extremes of heaven’s triads—corresponding to heaven’s highest point and the sun’s zenith. This fully demonstrates that heaven’s *yong* wholly embodies earth.

From this, we know that without the *san-liang* system—without the sun to determine the length of day and night, without the moon to alternate its waxing and waning—how could the qi, form, *ti*, and *yong* of heaven and earth, the transformations and creations of yin and yang, their ascending and descending, advancing and retreating, their permutations of separation and union, their comings and goings, their destinations—how could one discern their true nature amid the chaotic winds? Thus, it is through this *san* system that the origin of numbers is established.

Heaven’s one begins in the north, moves to the center, and divides earth’s two in the southwest. This cannot be called "heaven and earth in their proper positions," for yang is upright and descends, while yin is partial and ascends. That two is named *Kun* while one is not named *Qian* arises because one originates from *Kan*. From one’s triad with two to form three, proceeding eastward, we see humanity’s triad within heaven and earth to generate life, moving in *Zhen*. Then, doubling two to make four, appending *Xun* to follow and interpenetrate, an image is born—yet this image is not the true substance. The image of heaven, earth, and humanity merely represents the initial pairing of male and female.

The yang of one and three naturally each occupies its center, but the uncentered two and four—how can they be left uncorrected? Thus, they await the application of completed numbers’ intersections to achieve correctness. Though five occupies the central void, its number governs its function. One intersects five, pairing its one to complete six in *Qian*; two intersects five, pairing its two to complete seven in *Dui*; three intersects five, pairing its three to complete eight in *Gen*; four intersects five, pairing its four to complete nine in *Li*—only then is it called a "completed image." The completed image is called *Qian*, and its imitative pattern is called *Kun*—only then can it be said that "heaven and earth are in their proper positions."

In reality, one naturally pairs with one, two with two, three with three, four with four—it is only through intersecting five that transformation occurs. Thus, the singular yang of *Kan* combines to form the six yin of *Qian*; the two yin of *Kun* combine to form the seven yang of *Dui*; the three yang of *Zhen* combine to form the eight yin of *Gen*; the four yin of *Xun* combine to form the nine yang of *Li*. What was initially correct is paired to assist the partial; what was initially partial is paired to return to correctness. Thus, the eight trigrams are arrayed, and their images reside within.

Only the one at the center of *Kan* remains self-contained, not entering the numerical system. Through the *Hetu*’s "three heavens, two earths" and the *san-wu*’s intricate permutations, its transformations unfold. Therefore, from heaven’s *san* system, all employing nine, we know nine is *Qian*’s function; from earth’s *liang* system, all employing six, we know six is *Kun*’s function.

*Qian*’s inception triads with *Gen*’s eight, yet falls short in number—thus it takes *Zhen*’s one to complete nine’s central triad, embodying yang’s extremity and the fullness of numerical form. When the primordial surplus is insufficient, it takes the final triad of nine, then draws *Dui*’s surplus three beyond the center to serve *Qian*’s six at its end. Nine’s paired inception begins with *Zhen*’s central two, combining with *Xun*’s four to compensate its lack. Six’s paired conclusion begins with *Kun*’s original two, combining with *Dui*’s surplus four to complete its six—thus clarifying the interplay of *san-liang*’s nine and six.

Some claim that *Kun*’s two and *Dui*’s seven make nine, and *Qian*’s position naturally yields six, also forming nine and six—yet they fail to recognize that the *liang* system concludes above earth, while the *san* system concludes below earth. How could these be interchangeable? Moreover, *Qian* is originally nine, yet its number is now reduced to six.

Kun was originally six, yet its number is now augmented to nine—this further clarifies how the old yin’s six transforms into nine, and the old yang’s nine transforms into six, thereby establishing the nine and six of the hexagrams and lines. From this, we see that the *san*-Heaven’s function must be nine, while the *liang*-Earth’s form must be six. The opening of the *Xiaoxi* states: “The eight trigrams are arrayed, and their images are therein.” By doubling them, “their lines are therein.” Yet later generations claim that the doubling of the *Yi*’s lines did not originate with Fuxi—this I cannot believe. Moreover, the *Shuogua* says: “Joy is expressed in *Dui*, completion is spoken of in *Gen*.” Whenever it speaks twice of the communication of qi between mountain and marsh, it refers to the hexagram *Xian*. The *Xiang* of *Xian* says: “The two qi stimulate and respond to one another, uniting in stillness and joy. Heaven and Earth stimulate each other, and the myriad things are transformed and born; the sage stimulates the human heart, and the world attains peace.” Observing what they stimulate, the nature of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things becomes visible. Where thunder and wind press upon one another, it refers to the hexagram *Heng*. The *Xiang* of *Heng* says: “Thunder and wind unite, advancing and moving. The Dao of Heaven and Earth is everlasting and unceasing. The sun and moon attain Heaven and thus endure in their illumination; the four seasons transform and thus endure in their completion. The sage endures in the Dao, and the world is transformed and completed.” Observing what they press upon, the nature of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things becomes visible. Tracing the beginning of human Dao in the *Lower Canon*, the intent of the *Shuogua* in doubling the hexagrams is not the slightest bit contradictory. Thus, I maintain that the doubling of the *Yi* decisively began with Fuxi. Otherwise, the *Rites* speaks of the three *Yi*, all of whose primary hexagrams are eight, and whose variations are all sixty-four—would this deceive me? In seeking the Dao of the *Yi*, let this be the starting point.

The *Shuogua* says: “Of old, the sages made the *Yi*, measuring Heaven by *san* and Earth by *liang*, observing the changes in yin and yang to establish the hexagrams, and expressing them through hardness and softness to generate the lines.” Investigating the principles behind their *san* and *liang*, their derivation from the *Hetu*’s primordial inquiry is evident. Moreover, the chapter beginning “The sovereign emerges from *Zhen*” is a grand elucidation of the *Hetu*. It specifically begins with *Zhen* at the center of spring, circling around to conclude at *Gen*, embodying the annual renewal of the Xia calendar. Thus it is said: “In ending the myriad things and beginning the myriad things, none is more flourishing than *Gen*.” It says: “*Gen* is the hexagram of the northeast, where the myriad things complete their endings and begin their beginnings.” The implied meaning is that it begins anew with the emergence from *Zhen*. This is indeed Confucius’s unique way of expressing the cyclical transformation of the four seasons, yet regarding the Dao that permeates day and night, his knowledge did not fully extend to it.

The *liang* system, arising together from level ground to serve the central *san*, divides from spring to autumn and must culminate at the solstice of summer—this is also the image of day. The *san* system, beginning and ending entirely within the earth, divides from autumn to spring and must culminate at the solstice of winter—this is also the image of night. Let us apply this to the constant transformations of daily life: emerging from *Zhen* is the beginning of human activity at sunrise—this is what the ancients called *Zhen* as the verification of the first day. Aligning with *Xun* is the interaction of movement and union. Appearing in *Li* is the culmination of interaction. Laboring in *Kun* is the extreme of movement gradually settling into stillness. Joyfully speaking in *Dui* is rest and reclusion. From *Zhen* to *Dui*, this is the function and form of day, commonly observed by all. As for contending in *Qian*, it ultimately adopts the *san* system’s conclusion. Its number nine preserves *Dui*’s surplus three, entering at dusk to rest within *Qian*’s six and thus concluding. This is the time when yin and yang press upon one another, closed and unused. Yet an ending contains a beginning, and when it reaches toiling in *Kan*, the qi of the night’s division stirs again, corresponding to the return of the seven-day cycle. Completing speech in *Gen* is the distant connection to *Dui*’s surplus three, joyfully speaking in *Dui*. The communication of qi between mountain and marsh, stimulating and uniting, though still in its place, moves when the time is right—this is the renewed beginning of human affairs.

Transformation and change are the images of advance and retreat; hardness and softness are the images of day and night. From Fuxi and King Wen onward, I see that the *Hetu*’s single yin and single yang, advancing and retreating, ascending and descending, circulate endlessly. From antiquity to the present, whether in the distant cycle of a year’s winter and summer or the near cycle of a day’s day and night, nothing does not proceed by this Dao. In our daily lives and constant conduct, there is no need for other inquiries—the Dao of *san*-Heaven that begins in *Gen* is present herein. Regarding *Tai Xuan*’s use of seven hundred twenty-nine to emulate the *Yi*, or *Huangji*’s use of *yuan*, *hui*, *yun*, and *shi* to establish correspondences with the cycles of years, months, days, and hours, observing their transformations and exhausting their numbers in the *Hetu* reveals the visible workings of the Dao. Is this not simple and principle-attaining? Is this not the utmost in subtle transformation and the numinous?

The *Yitu Tongbian* concludes its third section.

The Linchuan Daoist Lei Siqi studies
*Hetu Bianzheng*
The *Hetu*’s existence as a diagram led Fuxi to draw the eight trigrams based on it; King Wen subsequently appended the hexagram statements, and it has been treasured and transmitted through the ages.

From its first appearance in the *Book of Documents*’ *Counsels of Yu* as the "arrangement of the *shu*" to its present designation as the "primordial," who would dare question it? Yet when we trace its origins through the records and reflect on antiquity, we find that earlier accounts lamented its loss of authentic expression, while later interpretations claim that even the *Counsels* failed to capture its true meaning—thus obscuring its original vision. After the Qin burning of the books, it survived solely in the *Book of Documents* commentary of Kong Anguo. The *Han Annals* merely noted its role in "weaving together the warp and weft of the *Book of Changes*," while the *Apocrypha of the Changes* spun ever more convoluted theories, straying further from the original intent. By the Tang and Five Dynasties, its true form and semblance had become so obscure that none could fathom its primordial essence.

At the beginning of the Song, Chen Tuan of Chuan first revived the ancient study of images and numbers. Distressed by its debasement in the divination practices of yin-yang theorists and its entanglement in the *Qian Zaodu*’s *Taiyi* numerology for the nine-palace method, he composed the *Dragon Diagram* to disseminate his teachings. Though I was fortunate to examine his complete work and observe how its principles of separation and union, emergence and withdrawal, were expounded through numerical systems—seemingly as if he had laid bare the very hearts of Fuxi and King Wen—there remained aspects where he failed to grasp their intent. His initial error lay in extracting the number fifty-five from the original diagram to create a separate figure, which he arbitrarily labeled as the "embodied *Luoshu*." While the original diagram already contained all the meanings of vertical and horizontal alignment, interweaving, division and unity, substance and function, the separation of the fifty-five numbers led later generations to abandon the root for the branch, fostering doubts about whether the *Hetu* and *Luoshu* emerged together. Though some affirmed and others denied, none pursued the matter to its ultimate conclusion, only fueling endless debate. When his disciple Liu Mu of Changmin further proliferated fifty-five diagrams under the title *Gouyin*, the distortions multiplied. At the time, Li Guan of Taibo refuted these errors, yet even he claimed to preserve three diagrams. Upon inspection, the first was the *Hetu* as commonly transmitted today; the second was the separate fifty-five-number figure arbitrarily labeled as the "embodied *Luoshu*"; and the third merely depicted the directional positions of the eight trigrams. Changmin, failing to discern the root, was indeed mistaken, but Taibo likewise failed to recognize that these three were fundamentally one, arbitrarily dividing them into three.

From that time onward, the more it was transmitted, the more it was lost; the more it was expounded, the more forced the interpretations became. Some, citing the *Great Commentary*’s account of the *Hetu* emerging from the river and the *Luoshu* from the Luo, even doubted whether the *Great Commentary* was truly the work of Confucius. They did not understand that the *Hetu* was not the *Luoshu*, nor the *Luoshu* the *Hetu*. In the most extreme cases, the fifty-five-number diagram was falsely called the *Hetu*, while Chen Tuan’s transmitted *Hetu* was mislabeled as the *Luoshu*—a complete inversion, leading to endless confusion. They failed to see that the *Hetu*’s eight trigrams clearly display the fifty-five numbers, explicitly denoting the heavenly numbers (five) and earthly numbers (five). From heaven-one and earth-two to heaven-five and earth-ten, their sum is fifty-five, embodying substance and function, emptiness and fullness, origin and end—all fully expressed in a single diagram. When did it ever seek correspondence with the *Luoshu*? And when did the *Luoshu* ever claim to represent the fifty-five numbers?

Chen Tuan’s error began when he arbitrarily separated the fifty-five numbers from the *Hetu* to create a distinct diagram labeled as the *Luoshu*, thereby initiating the transmission of doubt. His initial intent likely stemmed from Han scholars’ transmission of the *Hongfan*’s first five phases, where the second is fire and the fourth is metal. The *Tai Xuan* modeled itself on the *Changes*, also designating two as fire (south) and four as metal (west). Yet in the *Hetu*, two is placed in the southwest and four in the southeast, reversing the positions of fire and metal. Unwilling to directly alter the *Hetu*, Chen Tuan instead extracted the fifty-five numbers to form the *Luoshu*, placing fire (two) in the south and metal (four) in the west according to the *Hongfan*, and appending seven to two and nine to four, thereby rearranging their positions in the south and west. Changmin, unaware of this reasoning, went so far as to claim that fire and metal had swapped places. Yet the number nine of *Li* (fire) resides in the due south, while the number seven of *Dui* (metal) resides in the due west—these are the natural transformations of heaven and earth through the interplay of five, and there is no justification for altering them. How could one arbitrarily compare them to the *Hongfan*’s fire (two) and metal (four) and presume to rearrange them? Moreover, the *Hongfan* only lists the numbers of the five phases, whereas Chen Tuan added seven and nine, attaching seven to two and nine to four—on what basis? If we follow the *Hetu*’s example, where seven is appended to two and nine to four, then the seven *yous* of doubt should correspond to the two of the five affairs, and the nine *fus* of fortune should correspond to the four of the five constants—what kind of coherence would this create? Two, seven, four, and nine are merely numbers, devoid of form, image, or fixed direction; they could be arbitrarily rearranged. But *Li* and *Dui* have their proper places, and fire and metal have their substance and function—would the creative transformations of heaven and earth willingly submit to human contrivance and alter themselves accordingly?

Chen Tuan did not recognize that the numbers of the *Hetu* and *Luoshu* are fundamentally distinct and cannot be made identical. By forcing an illogical comparison, he drew rigid boundaries where none existed, grasping the finger and losing sight of the shoulder and back. Moreover, the emergence of the *Hetu* was not merely about the textual forms of the four images and eight trigrams—it embodied the very substance and function of heaven and earth.

Li in the south symbolizes heaven, yet its center harbors yin—yin by which descent is effected. Kan in the north symbolizes earth, yet its center holds yang—yang by which ascent is achieved. Zhen, with yang at its inception, thus mirrors the eastern rise of the Wood of the Bowels. Dui, with yin at its apex, therefore reflects the western descent of the Metal of the Yin. Qian and Kun embody the very substance of heaven and earth, while yin and yang enact the creative transformations—yet these two trigrams are relegated to the southwest and northwest corners. Habituated to common perception, one might suppose heaven and earth have exchanged places. Nor is this all.

Divinatory methods further assign Zhen and Xun to Wood, Qian and Dui to Metal, Kun and Gen to Earth, while Kan alone represents Water and Li alone Fire. Thus Kan and Li monopolize Water and Fire, just as Qian and Kun are denied exclusive claim to Heaven and Earth—much like Fire and Metal, which cannot be rigidly fixed to a single direction. Kun, occupying the second position in the southwest, is where Earth’s second power generates Fire. Xun, in the fourth position in the southeast, is where Earth’s fourth power generates Metal—both yin. Yet Dui in the seventh position in the west and Li in the ninth position in the south are both yang. Thus the generating numbers are all yin, requiring the completion of yang numbers. Earth’s generating numbers proceed from west to south, hence Kun precedes Xun; its completing numbers proceed from south to west, hence Li precedes Dui.

Observe how fire, once ablaze, reduces to ash and vanishes—fire transformed and spiritually transmuted. Though metal may melt, its essence endures—metal transformed yet its essence unchanged. This mutual transformation of Fire and Metal, alike yet not alike, explains why the numbers one, seven, four, and nine are not fixed but interweave in intricate variation, defying rigid directional analysis.

The diagram of fifty-five numbers places one, two, three, and four within the four directions, while six, seven, eight, and nine are arranged externally. Counting by direction may proceed, but how is one to trace a cyclical sequence that enables their circulation? Moreover, the numbers five and ten are merely assigned to the four directions as virtual functions. Though five and ten are termed Earth numbers, cosmologists distribute Earth’s dominion among the four directions—Chen, Xu, Chou, and Wei. Physicians, speaking of Earth as the Spleen, follow the five-phase cycle, each phase lasting seventy-two days, totaling three hundred sixty days. They further divide Earth’s seventy-two days, apportioning eighteen days to the end of each season, designating this as the Spleen’s period of governance. Medicine, so intimately concerned with human well-being, empirically confirms this division of Earth’s days—yet nowhere does it isolate five as a distinct entity outside the four directions, establishing a separate "central five."

Furthermore, the divinatory method of four operations completes the *Yi*, and eighteen changes form a hexagram. Each change involves four operations, so the total operations per hexagram number seventy-two—aligning with medical theory. Yet this diagram separates five, establishing an anomalous central five. If this center is designated as such, to what practical use shall it be put?

Thus, I contend that Chen Tuan’s invention of the fifty-five-number diagram, distinctively labeled the "form of the *Luoshu*," was fundamentally misguided from its inception. The *Book of Documents*’ Nine Categories each possess their own completed numbers: the first pertains to the Five Phases, the second to the Five Affairs—here, one might still derive numerical coherence. Yet when forcibly extended to the fifth, the "August Standard," it becomes impossible to specify what object or affair it represents. Even more egregiously, the ninefold "Five Blessings" are appended to the "Six Extremities"—should one count the nine, or the five blessings alongside the six extremities? The "August Standard" denotes the Great Mean, yet the "Six Extremities" represent extremes—can extremes be called "mean"? The August Standard is neither object nor affair, hence it may be designated as "central." Yet to concretize it as five dots—do these dots thereby constitute the center?

Each category, from one to nine, retains its inherent numerical integrity. How can they be arbitrarily combined into fifty-five? To insist on such a synthesis is mere delusion. Those who later equate the *Luoshu* with diagrams, and diagrams with the *Luoshu*, are delusional among the deluded.

I maintain that while diagrams may possess coherent numerical structures, and the *Luoshu* may enumerate categorical types, it cannot be spatially arranged as a diagram. My adherence to the *Hetu* is not a claim to have personally witnessed the foundational principles by which Fu Xi and King Wen composed the *Yi*. Yet its numbers—five and ten—interweave horizontally, diagonally, laterally, and orthogonally, generating and completing through advance and retreat, surplus and deficit. The alternation of yin and yang in odd and even, division and union, the eight trigrams’ substantive and functional transformations—these embody the unfathomable subtleties of creation’s numinous workings, beyond human contrivance. They seem to emerge from the natural mechanisms of heaven itself, rightfully serving as the primordial source for Fu Xi and King Wen’s composition of the *Yi*.

I have privately immersed myself in its study, extending its principles by analogy, adapting and penetrating its depths, entering its gate to grasp its profound essence. Presuming to have attained a comprehensive understanding of its substance and function, I have ventured to expound my interpretation. Yet unlike the Han scholars who dogmatically imposed the Five Phases to reconcile with the *Spring and Autumn*’s portents, or who forcibly harmonized the fifty-five numbers into the *Luoshu*, I dare not affirm such approaches, nor align myself with them.

The world may not yet fully comprehend this: the *Hetu* is sometimes said to derive from the *Apocryphon of the Yi*, *Qian Zao Du*, where the Great One deploys its numbers to traverse the Nine Palaces, with the four cardinal and four intercardinal directions each summing to fifteen.

Zheng Kangcheng, in his annotations, further cites the rationale for traversing the Nine Palaces, arriving at the vacant position at the center of the circuit—though this is not to be taken as the number five, but rather as the "August One" occupying the central palace of the five. Yet both his *Apocryphon* and *Commentary* are baseless fabrications, for they fail to recognize that the numbers five and ten are but empty designations employed to regulate the generation of odd and even, their numerical values existing in form alone while their positions remain fundamentally vacant. Moreover, what he terms the "Grand Unity" (*Taiyi*) differs fundamentally from the Supreme Ultimate (*Taiji*). If one does not grasp this distinction, consider the *Record*: "Rites must be rooted in the Grand Unity, which divides to become Heaven and Earth, revolves to become yin and yang, transforms to become the four seasons, and arrays to become ghosts and spirits." Its principle is inherently distinct from that of the Supreme Ultimate, yet it may be laterally comprehended without contradiction. As this belongs to the *Record*’s class of texts, it is appended to the *Commentaries* as evidence.

*Yitu Tongbian*, Scroll Five
By Daoist Lei Siqi of Linchuan

When the ancient sages ruled all under Heaven, establishing the foundational principles of governance to enlighten myriad generations, was this achieved lightly, by arbitrarily imposing their own views to arrogate the power of creation? Clearly, such wisdom was bestowed by Heaven—this much is undeniable. Thus, when the Yellow River yielded the *Hetu*, Fuxi took it as a model to draw the Eight Trigrams; when the Luo River yielded the *Luoshu*, Yu the Great took it as a model to arrange the Nine Categories. In the *Great Commentary*, Confucius spoke of Heaven producing numinous artifacts, which sages took as models, and he included both *Hetu* and *Luoshu* in this, affirming their dual authority. Confucius did not speak of anomalies, force, disorder, or spirits—how could he have seen nothing of substance and yet delighted in fabricating falsehoods to deceive later generations? When Fuxi ruled all under Heaven, he looked up to observe the patterns of Heaven, looked down to observe the laws of Earth, examined the markings of birds and beasts and the suitability of the land, drew near to take from his own body, and drew far to take from external things, thereby creating the Eight Trigrams to communicate the virtue/power of the numinous and luminous and to categorize the conditions of the myriad things. Could the former and later sages have each imposed their own shallow understanding upon these matters? The *Yi*’s vastness matches Heaven and Earth, its adaptability matches the four seasons, and the principles of yin and yang match the sun and moon. As a text, it is vast and all-encompassing, perpetually renewing itself in tandem with Qian and Kun without decay. Without Heaven’s bestowal, could such a work exist? Here, Confucius, having witnessed the emergence of the *Hetu* and *Luoshu*, merely stated that sages took them as models—no other explanation was needed.

Moreover, the *Hetu*’s appearance during the reigns of Cheng and Kang is recorded in the *Gu Ming*, where it was displayed behind the array of ritual vessels—no further accounts exist. Confucius already lamented its absence, sighing, "It is over for me!" At the dawn of the Han dynasty, Kong Anguo, in his *Book of Documents Commentary*, appended to the *Hetu* under the *Shu Xu* that when Fuxi ruled all under Heaven, a dragon-horse bore the *Hetu* from the Yellow River, and he took its patterns as a model, calling it the *River Chart*. Regarding the Heavenly bestowal of the *Hongfan*’s Nine Categories upon Yu, he stated that Heaven granted Yu the *Luoshu*, where a divine turtle bore the patterns on its back, arranged in numbers from one to nine, and Yu ordered them into nine types—these types being the *chou* (categories). These two accounts were originally recorded separately under the original passages of the *Hongfan* and *Gu Ming*, without additional elaboration.

Later, Zheng Kangcheng began to cite the *Spring and Autumn Apocryphon* to jointly annotate the *Great Commentary*’s *Hetu* and *Luoshu*, stating: "The Yellow River flows to connect Qian, issuing Heaven’s treasures; the Luo River circulates to link Kun, disgorging Earth’s tokens. The *Hetu* emerges with the dragon’s manifestation; the *Luoshu* arises with the turtle’s inspiration." He claimed the *Hetu* comprised nine scrolls and the *Luoshu* six, marking the onset of fantastical theories. Yet he still cited Kong Anguo’s annotations, affirming that the *Hetu* corresponded to the Eight Trigrams and the *Luoshu* to the Nine Categories. Subsequently, Wang Fusi and Han Kangbo offered no commentary on this matter. Although Kong Yingda’s *Yi Shu* transcribed Zheng’s annotations in full, he remarked that Wang Fusi’s interpretation followed an unknown tradition, clearly indicating his refusal to endorse Zheng’s views. In his commentary on the *Hongfan* in the *Book of Documents*, he again cited the *Appended Judgments*: "The Yellow River yielded the *Hetu*; the Luo River yielded the *Luoshu*; sages took them as models." He noted that the nine categories each bore written characters, identifying them as the *Luoshu*, and that the "Heaven" which bestowed it upon Yu was none other than the *Luoshu* itself. He further cited Liu Xiang’s *Han Shu·Wuxing Zhi*, which stated: "When Fuxi ruled by Heaven’s mandate, the Yellow River yielded the *Hetu*, and he took it as a model to draw the Eight Trigrams; when Yu governed the floodwaters, he was granted the *Luoshu*, and he took it as a model to arrange the *Hongfan*. The *Hetu* and *Luoshu* serve as warp and weft; the Eight Trigrams and Nine Categories serve as outer and inner."

(Appendix) The foregoing is the shared account of earlier scholars.

The claim that "a tortoise bore the *Luoshu* on its back" finds no basis in the Classics. The *Zhonghou* and various *Wei* texts recount that the Yellow Emperor, Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu all received *tushu* (chart-and-script), invariably describing dragons bearing charts and tortoises bearing scripts. The authorship of these *Wei* and *Hou* works remains unknown; scholars investigating their origins trace their forgeries to the reigns of Emperors Ai and Ping of the Han. Yet even before these texts appeared in the late Western Han, earlier scholars must have transmitted such accounts, which is why Confucius, in describing the nine categories, spoke of a divine tortoise bearing written patterns on its back—numbers from one to nine arranged in sequence—so that Yu, upon seeing them, ordered them to form the nine-category system. The assertion that "Yu ordered them" stems from the belief that divine beings’ speech must be concise; they would not meticulously arrange such sequences, hence the attribution to Yu.

(Full Text) His commentary on the *Hetu* in the "Guming" chapter and on the "Chuma Tu" in the *Records* differs only slightly in detail, but their essential meaning aligns as follows: the so-called *Hetu* corresponds to the Eight Trigrams, and the so-called *Luoshu* corresponds to the Nine Categories—no dissenting views exist on this. From the Han through the Tang, as the *Yijing* circulated, no texts beyond the Classics, commentaries, or exegeses ever prefaced the *Hetu* and *Luoshu* to the canon. Only in the early Song did Chen Tuan (Tunan) first innovate to elucidate symbolic numbers, claiming to have grasped the profound intent of Confucius’ "three presentations of the nine trigrams" through deep study. He produced new writings, notably the *Longtu* (Dragon Chart), which, through recombination and transformation, yielded over twenty diagrams. These fully employed the *Dazhuan*’s numbers—"Heaven one, Earth two... Heaven five, Earth ten, fifty-five in total"—interwoven with the *Na Jia* system to unify *Yi* principles. One diagram, labeled "Forming the Nine Palaces," and another, "Forming the *Luoshu*," entirely omitted the five generating numbers, retaining only Earth’s numbers from six to ten. His explanation that "ten is for application, ten is for completion" merely reiterates the *Hongfan*’s enumeration of the five phases’ operational numbers. By the end of his work, he reintroduced two diagrams: the first, "Forming the Nine Palaces," remained unchanged and was relabeled the *Hetu*; the second, merely rearranging the *Dazhuan*’s fifty-five numbers across the four directions and center, was arbitrarily renamed the *Luoshu*, devoid of any explanatory tradition or discourse. He arbitrarily relocated two and seven to the south, four and nine to the west—no one knows on what authority he based this—yet labeled it thus, likely following earlier interpretations of the *Hongfan*’s five phases (two as fire, four as metal) or the *Tai Xuan*’s alignment with the *Yi* (two as south, four as west). However, his theories did not spread widely, and few understood them.

When Chen Tuan’s teachings passed through five generations to Liu Mu (Changmin), the latter expanded them to fifty-five diagrams, titling the work *Gouyin*. Teachers and disciples mutually praised and propagated these ideas, producing various *Yi* commentaries—*Discourse on Hexagram Virtues*, *Chamber Dialogues*, *Record of the Master’s Teachings*, *Essential Return*, *Subtleties*, and *Communing with the Divine*—collectively called *New Annotations on the Zhouyi*. Liu sought to mystify his work and legacy, yet upon scrutiny, no true marvels emerged. At the time, Li Guan (Taibo) authored *Six Discourses* to refute his errors, condemning them as misleading students and corrupting世教. He retained only three of Liu’s diagrams: the *Hetu*, the *Luoshu*, and the Eight Trigrams. While Liu’s proliferation of diagrams was indeed questionable, Li’s failure to recognize that these three diagrams shared a common origin was equally flawed. The *Hetu* originally arranged the Eight Trigrams with the fifty-five numbers. Liu and his followers later overturned the ancient interpretation of the *Luoshu*, arguing it was not merely the *Hongfan* but another script predating Fuxi, which Fuxi then used alongside the *Hetu* to create the *Yi*. Li’s view aligned with theirs—this perplexity defies understanding.

Upon careful examination of this chapter in the *Dazhuan*, it presents models of Heaven and Earth, adaptations to the four seasons, and suspended images of the sun and moon, while also mentioning divination tortoises. Thus, it speaks of "Heaven producing divine things for sages to model," referring specifically to divination. The *Yi* relies solely on divination, where the tortoise’s virtue is round and spirit-like, subtly aiding the divine to generate omens—how could the *Yi* involve tortoises? The mention of tortoises arises merely because both tortoises and milfoil can be used for divination. The preceding lines, "modeling Heaven and Earth, adapting to the four seasons," are elaborated as: "Heaven and Earth transform; sages emulate them." The earlier "suspended images of the sun and moon" are expanded to: "Heaven hangs images; sages imitate them." As for "Heaven producing divine things," this is further explained as: "Like the Yellow River yielding the *Hetu* and the Luo River yielding the *Luoshu*, sages also model them." Since Fuxi, before Yu, modeled the *Hetu* to draw the trigrams, it naturally extended to Yu modeling the *Luoshu* to arrange the nine categories. How does this harm their analogous and interchangeable use? Did it ever intend to equate the numbers, meanings, or structural coherence of *tushu*? Did it ever claim *tushu* emerged simultaneously? Moreover, not only did Han scholars cite the *Hongfan* as the *Luoshu*, but even Chen Tuan’s initial "Forming the *Luoshu*" merely stated that "ten is for application, ten is for completion," referring to the *Hongfan*’s enumeration of the five phases’ operational numbers—clearly identifying the *Luoshu* with the *Hongfan*. Unaware of his original intent, Liu and his followers betrayed their teacher’s transmission, asserting the *Luoshu* did not originate in Yu’s time, further confusing later scholars and depriving them of reliable foundations. Why?

Moreover, it does not acknowledge that Confucius regarded the sage’s model as such. Not only was Fuxi’s time distant by generations and years, but even from Yu’s era, it had already been over a thousand years. To claim the *shu* emerged from the Luo, comparing it to Fuxi’s *tu* emerging from the River—how does this defy reason? Yet Changmin deliberately advanced this argument, thereby even casting doubt on Confucius’ *Great Commentary*. Though Tunan’s *Dragon Diagram* professed to derive from Confucius’ threefold exposition of the nine hexagrams, its preface states: “The *Dragon Diagram* was scattered by Heaven to be revealed; Fuxi assembled and applied it; Confucius silently embodied it.” It explicitly notes that the initial diagram remained unassembled, consisting solely of the fifty-five numbers. Thus, when the *Great Commentary* speaks of the twenty-five celestial numbers and thirty terrestrial numbers combined, how could it later arbitrarily relabel them as the *Luoshu*? This was surely an initial error. Changmin and his followers, however, perpetuated and compounded the mistake, taking it as the true *Luoshu* and substantiating the error with a fifty-five-number diagram. From Taibo onward, all regarded Tunan’s distinct fifty-five numbers as the authentic *Luoshu*. Yet they failed to consider: Tunan initially designated the *Luoshu* as “applying ten”—but where in the *Luoshu*’s nine categories does the number ten arise? Did they perhaps assume that since the *Great Commentary*’s *Hetu* could be revealed to the world, the *Luoshu* might likewise be revealed alongside it, thus appropriating the *Great Commentary*’s fifty-five numbers to fabricate the *Book of Documents*’ nine categories? Yet the nine categories speak of aligning and unifying the fifty-five numbers—where lies their application? This is the gravest of inconsistencies.

I once traced the origins of Changmin’s claims. After Tunan, scholars like Zhong Fang, Xu Jian, and Li Gai left no further writings. As for his direct disciples, Fan Kuachang’s *Origins and Flow of the Great Simplicity* states: “The dragon-horse bore the *tu* from the River; Fuxi exhausted the interplay of Heaven and humanity, redefined the generative and completed numbers of the five phases, and established the forms of the eight trigrams on earth. Thus, Laozi transmitted to Confucius the origins of the *Yijing* from the Western Zhou: Heaven One at due north, Earth Two at due south, Heaven Three at due east, Earth Four at due west, Heaven Five at the center, Earth Six paired with *zi*, Heaven Seven with *wu*, Earth Eight with *mao*, Heaven Nine with *you*, and Earth Ten with the center—lodged at the end—constituting the fifty-five numbers of Heaven and Earth.” Yet why, after placing the first five numbers at the cardinal directions and center, did he then pair the latter five with *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, *you*, and the center? Are not *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* the cardinal directions? And to say Earth Ten is “lodged at the end”—does the center have an end? A close examination of the assigned numbers reveals that the diagram now transmitted lacks the four corner numbers—proving Kuachang utterly failed to grasp Tunan’s distinctive arrangement. Instead, he arbitrarily followed the *Tai Xuan Jing*’s alignment with the *Yijing*, adopting the *Hongfan*’s sequence of one Water, two Fire, three Wood, four Metal, and five Earth, then fabricated a baseless origin from Laozi, concocting bizarre theories to justify Tunan’s unconventional placement of two, seven, four, and nine. Yet he still did not assign the nine categories to the nine palaces.

Kuachang’s innovations merely extended the remnants of the *Na Jia* system and the divergent *Five Sons Return to Geng* method. He further claimed that the eight trigrams of the celestial realm—*kan* and *li* facing the center—were shifted outward, placing *qian*, *dui*, and *kun* in the east, and *gen*, *zhen*, and *xun* in the west. He did not acknowledge that the five phases largely originated from the *Yijing*; later, he reversed course and cited the five phases as the foundation for determining the hexagrams—this was another major instance of his audacious innovations. Thus, Changmin not only added the fifty-five-number diagram but also, following Kuachang’s exclusion of *kan*, *li*, *zhen*, and *dui* from the four cardinals, equated the four completion numbers with the four directions. He argued: *kan*’s six subtracts its trigram’s three numbers, leaving three numbers to form three lines as *qian*; *li*’s seven subtracts its trigram’s three numbers, leaving four numbers to form four lines as *xun*; *zhen*’s eight subtracts its trigram’s three numbers, leaving five numbers to form five lines as *gen*; *dui*’s nine subtracts its trigram’s three numbers, leaving six numbers to form six lines as *kun*—all deriving lines from numbers and labeling this the *Hetu*. This is to ignore the root and force the branches into alignment. Each of the eight trigrams consists of three lines, generating *yin* and *yang* through their interplay—never has it been heard that a trigram uses only three lines while its surplus lines are redistributed to form other hexagrams. The assigned numbers are arbitrarily paired, and to treat *kan*, *li*, *zhen*, and *dui* as the four images is even more erroneous. The images precede the formation of hexagrams, hence the saying: “The four images generate the eight trigrams.”

He further claimed that the *Luoshu*’s nine categories were the *Hetu*’s natural numbers, with the Supreme Ultimate at the center and the eight categories distributed across the four cardinals and four corners. The five phases were placed at *kan* one, the five affairs at *kun* two, the five regulations at *xun* four, and the five blessings at *li* nine—arranging the nine categories in sequence within the *Hetu*’s hexagram order. Yet the nine categories refer to Yu’s sequential enumeration, proceeding directly from the first one, the second one, without skipping three or four, and applying them in order. Now, aligning them with the *Hetu*’s fifteen vertical and horizontal numbers disrupts the sequence. Without addressing each discrepancy, let us examine the first category, the five phases. If they are indeed the five phases, they should be distributed across the five directions—how can all five be confined to a single direction?

How can they be called the five phases if they are not distributed accordingly? Moreover, the claim that fire and metal swap positions, differing from the *Hetu*, reveals such inversion and confusion as to defy comprehension. Later, Yang Cigong composed the *Dongji Jing* under the pseudonym Guan Ziming, wherein this text attributes to the Master the words: "The original *Hetu* places seven in front and six behind, eight to the left and nine to the right. The sage observed this to draw the eight trigrams. Thus, the whole of seven’s three lines forms *Li*, while its odd line forms *Xun*; the whole of eight’s three lines forms *Zhen*, while its odd line forms *Gen*; the whole of six’s three lines forms *Kan*, while its odd line forms *Qian*; the whole of nine’s three lines forms *Dui*, while its odd line forms *Kun*. The even numbers exhaust their positions, the odd numbers complete their lines—this is said to be how the four images generate the eight trigrams, yet this is the most egregious of errors. *Qian* and *Kun* intertwine to produce the six children; how can what are now called male and female trigrams instead generate the trigrams of their parents? Moreover, to loosely claim that one and seven represent fire, or four and nine represent metal, might still deceive the uninitiated. But to explicitly state that *Li* nine is seven and *Dui* seven is nine is to suggest that the *Hetu*’s numbers can be arbitrarily rearranged—how can this be permissible?

It further asserts that the *Luoshu*’s pattern places five at its center, with nine in front and one behind, three to the left and seven to the right, four at the front-left and two at the front-right, eight at the back-left and six at the back-right. Later generations examined this and took it as the three images, then expanded it through nine transformations into twenty-seven images. Upon scrutiny, only the phrase "five at its center" does not contradict the *Luoshu*; the rest are merely the numbers of the *Hetu*, which, by adopting the *Luoshu*’s "five at the center," entirely loses the principle underlying the five. The *Book of Documents*’ nine categories place the five of the royal standard at the center, fundamentally distinct in function—this can establish their positions. As for the *Hetu*’s "heavenly five," it combines with the "earthly ten" to make fifteen, with the five being a quarter of the completed number and merging with the ten. How could there ever have been five empty points actually placed at the center of the diagram? The transmission of the diagram has been misled precisely by this five.

Cigong’s fabrication of these baseless examples merely serves to obscure his debt to Yang Xiong’s *Three Regions, Nine Provinces, and Twenty-Seven Departments*, which he privately adopted as his own work. In these two cases, the true *Hetu* and *Luoshu* have already been arbitrarily rearranged. Yet Zhu Xi and Cai Jitong instead revered them, believing them to be Guan Ziming’s work. Without considering that Ziming’s *Commentary on the Changes* is a work of profound insight—how could it compare to such imitations?—they followed these superficial conjectures, bolstering the claims by repeating that the *Hetu* places seven in front and six behind, eight to the left and nine to the right, and that the *Luoshu*’s pattern has nine in front and one behind, three to the left and seven to the right, four at the front-left, two at the front-right, eight at the back-left, and six at the back-right.

They argued that the *Great Commentary* presents the fifty-five numbers, while the *Hongfan* states that Heaven bestowed upon Yu the nine categories of the *Hongfan*, and that the numbers of the nine palaces—with nine worn on the head and one underfoot, three to the left and seven to the right, two and four as the shoulders, six and eight as the feet—match the pattern of a tortoise’s back. Liu Mu’s opinion, taking nine as the *Hetu* and ten as the *Luoshu*, falsely attributed this to Chen Tuan, contradicting the traditional views of the Confucians. He further cited the *Great Commentary* to claim that both originated in the time of Fuxi, thereby arbitrarily rearranging the *Hetu* and *Luoshu* without verification. Zhu and Cai’s criticisms were thus directed, yet they directly took Tu Nan’s initially mislabeled *Luoshu* as the *Hetu*, while reversing the original correct *Hetu* into the *Luoshu*. In doing so, Zhu and Cai themselves erred and then blamed the earlier mistakes of Zhang Changmin. Insisting on their own correctness and amplifying their arguments, they failed to reflect and reached this extreme.

Only Cheng Tai’s *Origins of the Changes* occasionally approached clarity. Yet those like Zheng Shuqing, following blindly, further embellished these fantastical claims with additional diagrams, none of which pointed to reality. They merely led later scholars to lose sight of the truth, believing what they should not and doubting what they should not, entangling and confounding the original principles, condemning what is correct and affirming what is not. Tracing the origins of this confusion, it all stems from Tu Nan’s use of the phrase "one of ten" to establish a misguided diagram, leading to this proliferation of errors. Initially, they borrowed the *Hetu* to support the *Luoshu*’s theories, but over time, they abandoned the diagram in favor of the book, and eventually, they took the book as the diagram. Thus, the *Hetu* became an indistinct concept—what purpose does the diagram serve, and what does its depiction of the fifty-five numbers represent? They do not realize that the fifty-five numbers initially arose from a misinterpretation of the *Luoshu*; now, clinging to them as the *Hetu* renders the diagram meaningless. As for those who take the *Luoshu* as the *Hetu*, the *Luoshu* is even less what it claims to be.

Such self-referential arguments have led scholars astray, like sheep lost on branching paths or horses sought in a chaotic market, their disputes as tangled as a clamor of voices—whom should one follow? This has persisted for nearly three hundred years. Thus, by tracing the origins of these errors and exposing the absurdities of these doubts, and by directly correcting them with the original numbers of the *Hetu*, it is hoped that scholars may see clearly, reach their own understanding, and recognize that Tu Nan’s claim of deriving the three arrays and nine trigrams from them is akin to deception. The methods of the diviners who follow the *Yiwei* in using one, six, and eight as white numbers to establish their starting examples are mere trivialities. Even the *Qianzao Du*’s assertion that the Great One takes these numbers to traverse the four cardinals and four corners, all summing to fifteen, is not entirely accurate. Yet from ancient times, scholars have firmly maintained that these were not fabrications by later hands. From my own perspective, there is no need to seek elsewhere: simply examine the chapter in the *Shuogua* that begins, "The Supreme Deity emerges from *Zhen*," and repeatedly investigate its cyclical center. By seeking the true essence from heaven one to earth four and earth six to heaven nine, and clarifying the virtual function of heaven five and earth ten, then through the interplay of threes and fives, the alternation of heaven’s three and earth’s two, and the intricate arrangement of numbers, everything aligns seamlessly with the original intent of Confucius’ *Appended Remarks to the Changes*.

This is called the "Triple Interplay." Confusion arises. Yet when the thunderous discourse is clarified, and the River Chart emerges—its transmission through antiquity unerring—it is sufficient to reveal the *Changes*. Thereby, one thoroughly comprehends the emergence of the Luo Book as one.

Beyond the Nine Divisions, how could there still exist spurious fabrications of charts and numbers? This is truly one of the greatest joys of past and present.
