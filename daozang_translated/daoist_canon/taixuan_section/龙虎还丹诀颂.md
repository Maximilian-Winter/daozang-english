**Ode to the Dragon-Tiger Reversion Elixir Secret**

I was born in the lands of Ba and Shu,
Long dwelling in Qi and Lu’s domain.
*"I"*—thus the Master named himself.

The Master bore the surname Lin,
Given name Taigu, style Xiangxian,
Dao name Chunhezi.
His ancestors hailed from Taiyuan, Jinyi,
Yet by official duty took root in Liangzhou.
He sought the Dao through wide inquiry,
Often wandering Qi and Lu’s lands.

Emperor Taizong, knowing his name, summoned him,
And granted him residence on Jingzhao Mountain—
Thus he was called *Jingzhao Shanren*.
Later, he secluded himself in Huayang, Yizhou,
And was again named *Huayang Xiansheng*.

For long he cherished tranquility,
Ever gazing into stillness.
He scorned fame and gain,
Guarding simplicity—
This was his true intent.

The Dao originates from Nature’s principle,
Its transformation returns to the boundless source.
Speaking of the Dao, one takes Nature as foundation;
Those who apply it skillfully
Attain the boundless.

Examining the trigrams *Kan* and *Li*,
Pointing to lead and mercury.
*Kan* is water, *Li* is fire,
Lead is the Tiger, mercury the Dragon.
This refers to true fire and true water,
True lead and true mercury.

The *Ode* completes sixty-four verses on the Reversion Elixir Secret.
The ancient sages’ mysteries of the Reversion Elixir
All draw upon the *Yijing*’s symbols.
Thus the sixty-four verses of the Elixir Secret
Follow the number of the hexagrams.
If later disciples study them diligently,
Practice them deeply,
They shall perceive their subtlety.

Since the Golden Chamber ignited the divine furnace,
The Chamber is ever revered—hence *Golden Chamber*.
The furnace transforms cinnabar—hence *Divine Furnace*.
The boundless Dao-wind sweeps the eight directions.
The furnace has eight faces,
Yet the wind stirs all—
Thus Taibai Jun’s song says:
*"The altar holds a three-tiered furnace of eight faces."*

Fortunate to observe ten thousand transformations in the Nine Enclosures,
The Nine Enclosures are the cauldron’s vessel,
Encompassing yin and yang.
The *Jade Pouch Ode* says:
*"Anciently, it was named Divine Dragon Marrow;
The Reversion Elixir’s completion relies on the Nine Enclosures."*
This is its meaning.

Who would not marvel at the Imperial Diagram’s praise?
The Imperial Diagram refers to the revered status of the divine elixir.
From Chaos’s division, I alone am exalted.
Among myriad things, none surpasses the Great Elixir in eminence.
It contains the Four Symbols, establishing Heaven and Earth.
One must recognize the refined *qi* of Heaven and Earth—
Metal, Wood, Water, Fire—
Only then can the supreme medicine be forged.

The Reversion Elixir must be sought within this.
Obtaining this is the gate to the utmost subtlety.
If applied without mastery,
It becomes the gate to marvelous attainment.

Common folk burn the Five Metals,
Who knows the Celestial Sovereign dwells in the Azure Pool?
The masses compete to burn mercury and cinnabar,
Claiming it as the spirit elixir.
Yet the essence of the Golden Elixir
Lies within the Hua Pool itself.

To forge the crimson powder in the cauldron,
First blend the white gold ointment within the furnace.
The *Yin-Shu Jing* says:
*"To know and refine is to be a Sage."*
Then those who discern the gold ointment and jade powder—
Are they not the Sages alone?

For those who wish to burn the elixir, take cinnabar,
Its luminous clarity must first be verified.
Cinnabar is born from true lead,
Not the common cinnabar of the world.
Tao Zhenren said:
*"Cinnabar is the supreme treasure within lead."*
Yuanyangzi said:
*"Do not seek cinnabar from Chenjin Prefecture—
Its journey is long; seek it near instead."*

Its root is the Green Dragon’s bone,
The Immortals call it White Horse’s tooth.
The Green Dragon is Wood, is mercury,
And mercury emerges from cinnabar.
Yin Zhenren said:
*"Cinnabar is the essence of Wood."*
And again:
*"When dissolved, it becomes water;
White Horse’s teeth are scattered."*

Tao Zhenren said:
*"White Horse’s tooth—
The finest cinnabar."*

The divine furnace’s eight trigrams take the Five Peaks’ form,
The furnace’s shape follows the eight trigrams and Five Peaks,
Standing thus.
Within, the yang cauldron governs the yin essence.
Water and fire interact,
Yin and yang regulate each other.

Observe where Dragon and Tiger intertwine—
The wind and thunder tremble, a hundred demons startled.
An ancient song says:
*"The Five Phases invert and unfold,
The Dragon emerges from fire’s embrace.
The Five Phases act disorderly,
The Tiger is born within water."*

Water and fire being within the cauldron,
The Dragon and Tiger surge internally,
Wind and thunder shake—
A hundred monsters cower in fear.

Emerging from the Azure Waves, it vanishes into darkness,
Gold is born from water, displaying its transformative power.
Within the cauldron, heavy as snow, yet light as flowers.
Yuanyangzi said:
*"Cinnabar is the substance, snow its attire—
Snowflakes liken its light and clarity."*

Do not shun cold and heat until the Nine Suns of Yang are fulfilled,
Then the elixir’s luminous essence—
The Five Emperors’ refined *qi*—is forged.

Common folk seek to refine the Sun’s spirit-soul,
The Reversion Elixir takes the Sun as soul, the Moon as shadow.
First, seek the mysterious source of transformation’s root.
The mysterious source is profound and secret,
The foundation of the medicine.
Tao Zhenren’s later text says:
*"The essence of Taixuan is the Dao’s fundamental root."*

Then establish *Kan* and *Li* as matched pair,
*Kan* is male, *Li* female—
The symbol of a matched pair.
Their emotions and nature unite Heaven and Earth.
*Nature* refers to cinnabar and mercury,
*Emotion* refers to gold.
The *Paramartha Contract* says:
*"Nature governs the inner realm,
Placing it at Yinyue.
Emotion governs the outer realm,
Fortifying the city walls."*

And again:
*"The Dragon is emotion, the Tiger is nature;
Emotion and nature depend on each other—
The meaning of return and transformation."*

I often see common folk discussing the Great Elixir,
Competing to burn the Eight Stones or dwell in mountains.
An ancient song says:
*"The Eight Stones harm the crimson blood,
The Five Metals deplete the yellow shoots."*
Those who burn the Eight Stones in the mountains,
Claiming them as the Great Elixir—
All are misguided.

They fail to recognize the true forms of Dragon and Tiger,
Which lie hidden in the mysterious and elusive.
The supreme medicine is not distant—
Yet the bewildered fail to awaken.

Cast gold to forge the true cauldron,
For when the cauldron is true,
The mercury naturally aligns.
An ancient song says:
*"The true cauldron is not a cauldron—
Only by using the true cauldron
Does true mercury arise."*

The Two Substances embrace and refine into the Supreme Elixir,
Feasting upon them makes one a transcendent being of dust.

Without the embrace of these Two Substances,
The Great Elixir will never be complete.

The *Qian* and *Kun* Hexagrams alone form the essence,
A thousand mornings of water and fire reveal their efficacy.

Practice the *Qian* and *Kun* Hexagrams,
Employ water and fire in their cycles,
And in a thousand days, the Return Elixir is born.

Thus, Qingxu Zi instructed Master Mao Jun:
*"The Great Elixir, when practiced for a thousand days,
Will manifest as the radiant Purple Bamboo.
The upper and lower strings harmonize the Two Eights,
Their alignment precise to the slightest measure, corresponding to the Western Bundle."*

Qingxu Zi said:
*"Eight measures of *huā* (华) as the upper string,
Eight measures of mercury as the lower string—
Combined, they make one *jin* (斤),
To fulfill the measure of the Two Strings.
Thus, the upper and lower strings harmonize the Two Eights,
To match the weight of the elixir, one *jin*."*

The secret essence of the Golden Elixir lies in the *Huá* Pool (华池),
The Divine Water of the *Huá* Pool teaches:
*"The Pool is water and fire.
Again, the *Zhōngyuán* (中元) text says:
The *huá* (华) is fire,
The Pool is water.
Learners abound, yet masters are rare.
The confused point one another to error,
And those who attain are few indeed."*

When Huai Wang (淮王) realized this, he became a True Immortal (真后),
His chickens and dogs ascended together, abandoning their homes to fly.
The Han Huai Nan Wang (淮南王) Liu An (刘安),
After refining the elixir, his chickens and dogs licked the cauldron,
And they too ascended to the Cloud Path (云路).

Mercury dwells within the sand,
Gold within the lead—
If one can thus intuit the Mysterious,
The profound secrets will naturally unfold.

The sand yields mercury,
The lead yields gold,
A marvel of Nature—
Only those who grasp it enter the True Realm (真境).

Though they have not yet attained the *Dāoguī* (刀圭) power,
They already strive to become Earthly Immortals (地仙).
When the heart comprehends the Supreme Treasure,
What else is it but Immortality?

The *Kàn* Hexagram enfolds gold, yet few know,
The *Lí* Hexagram contains water, yet few recognize.

Tao Zhengren’s lower chapter (下篇) states:
*"Gold is born from the Moon, thus *Kàn* is male.
The flowing pearl (流珠) arises from the Sun, thus *Lí* is female."*
Mao Zhengjun’s song declares:
*"Within the yin lies the yang,
Within the yang lies the yin—
This is the truth."*

If one can discern the True Gold and True Water,
By daylight, they ascend to the Purple Weft (紫微).

Those who can distinguish True Gold and True Water,
Shall swiftly attain sainthood,
Ranking among the celestial immortals (列位仙官).

The Golden Flower, when plucked, is the essence of lead,
Chased like prey, its scales shimmer as light as snow.
It speaks of the Golden Flower congealing like scattered scales,
As delicate as snowflakes in hue.

If one understands the subtleties within this,
The *Huá* Pool and Golden Cauldron will reveal themselves.

Lead enfolded in fire is gold within water—
Mutually employed, their transformations are boundless.

As the hundred refinements proceed, the hue deepens,
The True Essence harmonized—
Refining it further enhances its marvel.

Without encountering a Sage to transmit the oral precepts,
Relying solely on scriptures and commentaries,
The Great Elixir’s secrets remain elusive.
It is not recorded in scriptures or commentaries,
But passed down from Sage to Sage—
A few lines of oral precepts suffice.

Yin enfolded, drawn forth, belongs to yang,
Yet common folk fail to grasp its fine details.

Water cooks it, fire refines it—
Those who understand this principle
Can forge the elixir from cinnabar.

If one can recognize the Primordial Yin and Yang,
They shall enter the Realm of Everlasting Life.

The Earthly Essence and Heavenly Soul are the Tiger and Dragon—
Heavenly Yang is the Dragon’s Soul,
Earthly Yin is the Tiger’s Essence.
A thousand families’ texts describe them in vague terms.

Ancient Sages praised confusion,
Saying the Dao is not far.
Yuan Yang Zi (元阳子) declared:
*"Confusion lies solely in the union of your family’s art,
Day after day, you gaze yet fail to see."*

Common folk seek to recognize True Lead and True Mercury,
Identifying the Golden Master (金公) as lead
And the Water Artisan (水工) as mercury.

Fire enfolds lead—lead is not tin,
Wood conceals water—water is not silver.

True Lead and True Mercury
Are not the mundane black tin and quicksilver.

Only when you grasp the True Sage’s song,
*"Not knowing fire-lead and water-mercury,
Though you master a thousand arts, it profits nothing."*

Rely only on *Kàn* and *Lí*, aided by *Zhèn* and *Sǔn*,
To teach the union of *Jiǎ* and *Yǐ* with *Gēng* and *Xīn*.
*Jiǎ* and *Yǐ* are wood,
*Gēng* and *Xīn* are metal.

Yin Zhengren (尹真人) said:
*"Cinnabar is the essence of wood,
And when it obtains gold, they merge."*

Thus, *Kàn*, *Lí*, *Zhèn*, and *Sǔn*
Are always applied in their interplay.

A single Pool of autumn water reveals its hue,
Nine cycles of yin and yang descend then ascend.
The Nine Cycles are from the first month to the ninth month.
An ancient song says:
*"The ninth cycle, autumn’s end,
The Yellow Shoot’s auspicious form shines,
Its purple light resplendent."*

Lu Master (吕先生) said:
*"The coarse *Gǔshén* (谷神) ascends and descends.
Wait until the White Gold fully melts,
Then a single cluster of Elixir Essence congeals within the cauldron."*

The Golden Body returns as the Elixir—
This alone is the Supreme Treasure.
*The Cansong Contract* (《参同契》) says:
*"When gold returns to its original nature,
It is then called the Return Elixir."*

One breath congeals into the frost within the cauldron,
The Sages of Immortality call it the King of Elixirs.
All other medicines cure ailments,
But the Return Elixir and *Dāoguī* (刀圭) transform mortals into immortals,
Thus it is the sovereign of all medicines.

Nature’s creation is like a chicken egg,
Externally corresponding to *Gēng* and *Xīn* wrapped in yellow.
The cauldron and elixir resemble the egg’s form.
Always study the *Yīnfú* (《阴符》) and *Dàodé Jing* (《道德经》),
For Lu Master’s teachings are profound.

Lu Master, named Dongbin (洞宾),
Was a Sage of recent times.

Nurturing the elixir requires not three years of fire,
Refining the Golden Elixir points directly to half a *shēng* (升) cauldron.
Lu Master’s verse:
*"A single grain of millet contains a world,
Half a *shēng* cauldron boils mountains and rivers."*

In the boundless void, the Sun’s essence shines,
Speaking of the subtle marvels of the Primordial Yang,
Which nurtures all things.

The roots of Heaven and Earth are the teeth of all things.
Aspiring scholars, knowing this, refine according to the method,
And the natural elixir transforms into the *Héchē* (河车).
*Héchē* is another name for the Yellow Shoot.

Yangzi (阳子) of the Jin (晋) said:
*"Refining in *Qian* yields the Yellow Shoot,
Turning in *Kun* produces the *Héchē* (河车)."*
Again, his song:
*"The *Héchē* bears *Jiǎ* as your master,
Guard this path with secrecy—your heart will know."*

Refining the seas, subduing the mountains, regulating the Five Phases,
Within it, you capture the essence of the void.
It speaks of controlling the Five Phases,
Seizing the Primordial Qi (元气).

If mortals but see the True Root,
They should read the *Dàodé Jing* of the Primordial Emperor, the Most High Laozi (太上老君),
Who instructed the Gatekeeper Guan (关令) Yin Xi (尹喜) with the Five Thousand Words of the *Dàodé Jing*,
Whose essence fully contains the True One of the Return Elixir.

The hare flees, the crow flies, and the West is bound—
A hundred years pass like a dream within the soul.

When mortals ask of the path to eternal life,
Their greed for transient glory brings endless death.

The *Shénnóng Jīng* (神农经) says:
*"Knowing white and preserving black,
You seek death but cannot find it."*

It deceives the world, unaware of the Daoist Immortals’ way of transcending life.
They only hasten toward the mundane, yet swiftly reach annihilation.

Within the One, the true One is most difficult to seek,
Its name ranks in the West, its nature is gold.

The One is water.
Within water, the One is white gold.

The True Immortal Tao (陶真人) said:
*"Three and five unite with the One,
The utmost essence of Heaven and Earth.*

Gold is the mother of water,
The mother concealed, the child within the womb.
Water is the child of gold,
The child hidden within the mother’s matrix.

Again, he said:
*'White is the essence of gold,
Black is the foundation of water.*

Water is the pivot of the Dao,
Its number is called the One.

The determined seeker, knowing this, follows its principle—
Naturally, black and white float and sink in harmony.

Black is lead,
White is silver.
Lead sinks, silver floats—
The marvel of nature’s balance.

Heaven and Earth’s furnace refines the essence of the sun and moon,
Regal gold and primeval wood merge in their own accord.
If mortals recognize the true gold and wood,
All transformations come effortlessly to their grasp.

To grasp the meaning of gold and wood,
Then the workings of creation rest in their hands.

The True Immortal Tao’s lower scripture says:
*"He who attains it holds Heaven and Earth in his palm,
Creation in his body—
Ascending to sainthood,
Enrolling in the ranks of the Immortals.*

Awakening to this is like crossing a great river—
The enlightened cross without hindrance.

Always cultivate hidden virtue to move the Bright Heaven.
If you act contrary to the Dao and reveal its mysteries,
The spirits will surely bring misfortune upon you.
If you do not refine your practice yet disclose its secrets,
Disaster will follow.

All volumes of Immortal scriptures share the same principle,
The Return Elixir never strays from the Five Phases.

Never straying from the Five Phases,
The Five Phases become the supreme medicine.

To know the ninefold transformations of yin and yang complete,
Observe the three-year process of water and fire.

A thousand days of water and fire,
And the Great Elixir is formed.

Gently gather the dew of wood,
From a peck to a bushel, then to a weight.
From nonexistence to existence,
From little to much.

Exhaustion and fatigue—is the labor not bitter?
Yet the ancient sages endured such hardship.

They spoke of the ancients all being bound by ambition,
Yet attaining transcendence through it.

Boiling stones, refining gold, and alchemizing the *Tàixuān* (太玄),
The Immortals do not permit its casual transmission.

The essentials of its use—
A treasure of the Immortals, unknown to the world.

If mortals recognize the principle within the *Xuān* (玄),
The *Xuān* is the root of the medicine—
Those who perceive it refine their power to match creation.

They grasp the authority of Heaven and Earth’s transformations.

The Return Elixir’s omen appears in the first month,
As yin and yang interact to reach *Xīyí* (希夷).

*Xīyí*—the path of profound obscurity.

The hidden dragon’s position corresponds to the initial nine,
With the fire symbol drawn from the *Chūjiǔ* (初九).
The first emergence of yang at the child hour is the beginning.

In the second month, the green dragon begins to manifest,
Gathering the subtle essences of the Five Phases.

Wood and mercury congeal their essence,
Gradually revealing the spirit elixir.

One who knows the fire’s tempered warmth and hue,
Will hear the tiger’s roar within the cauldron.

The True Immortal Tao (茆真君) said:
*"Cold and heat return in cycles,
The tiger roars, the dragon hums."*

In the third month, the spirit elixir is called the *Xiǎo Huán* (小还).
Three years make the *Dà Huán* (大还), three months the *Xiǎo Huán*.

The *Xiǎo Huán* congeals like true lead.
You must regulate with intent the harmony of *Wén* (文) and *Wǔ* (武),
Lest yin and yang’s timing be misplaced.

Secure and meticulous—
Cling to the fire’s temper,
Gradually revealing mercury and lead."

The fire’s record marks the days:
At the start and end, *Wén* (cultivation), at the core, *Wǔ* (transformation).
Thus, it is called *Wén-Wǔ* (cultivation-transformation).

By the fourth month, the work is complete—
The soul is established, as a child in the womb,
And the spirit is born.

The Green Dragon and White Tiger contend, devouring each other.
At this time, the *Yù Yè* (jade liquid) subtly congeals,
As yang solidifies and yin dissipates—the tiger flees in haste.

In the fifth month, yin and yang qi intermingle,
And the yellow sprout gradually nurtures the sacred seedling.
The fifth month’s *Gòu* (coalescence) hexagram:
When yang first meets yin, the two qi harmonize,
Gradually gestating the sacred sprout.

This sacred seedling is the elixir of longevity—
Water and fire must still be attuned to the seasons.

In the sixth month, true yin solidifies into the *shā* (sand),
While deluded practitioners vainly seek the *Hé Chē* (river cart).
*Yīn Cōng* (殷葱) warns the *Tóng Rén* (fellow Daoists):
Do not boast in vain to the passing trends.
The ancient sages sternly forbade
Revealing this lightly.

By the seventh month, the medicine is secretly perfected,
Its green, yellow, red, and white forms indistinct.
As yin and yang qi grow stronger,
Its hues shift without constancy.
Rely entirely on water and fire’s impartial force,
Refining the essence of yin and yang qi.

Without the interplay of water and fire,
The two qi cannot condense their essence.

In the eighth month, the cycle returns to the *Duì* (joy) phase,
Where metal aligns with the season’s mandate.

The essence now returns to the **Duì** phase’s brilliance,
Yet still one must guard the **shén shì** (神室) with utmost care—
The **shén shì**, where the medicine is nurtured.
Cultivate the **Chángshēng Huǒlóng** (长生火里龙) within its depths.
When the **Huǒlóng** (火龙) is perfected, humans attain **Chángshēng** (长生).

By the ninth month, the **Hánlíng Gōng** (含灵汞) is fully dry,
A single jar of frost and snow chills the world.
The medicine condenses its essence, its form like frost and snow.
Do not hastily claim the **fúshēng bǎo** (浮生宝) as a fleeting treasure,
But wait until its completion for the **Dà Huán** (大还).

If one greedily consumes its benefits,
And recklessly claims the world’s treasure as perfected,
Then the **língdān** (灵丹) will never be realized.

By the tenth month, the **Jīndān** (金丹) has shed its embryonic form,
Now it truly begins as a **yīng’ái** (婴孩).
The **xiānshèng** (仙圣) liken the **Jīndān** to a child in the womb,
Or a seed upon the tree—its workings are unfathomable.
When nurtured to the tenth month,
It sheds its embryonic form and becomes a **yīng’ái** (婴孩).

This **yīng’ái** is the very essence of **Huán Dān** (还丹),
Yet who would believe it arises from the void?
From **xūwú** (虚无) to tangible form,
Is this not the **ultimate refinement** (至精) in all under heaven?

When the **yīn pò** (阴魄) is consumed, the **yáng** (阳) stands firm,
The **bái jīn** (白金) gives way to the **húilóng** (灰后赤龙).
Within the **dǐng** (鼎), only the **níng cuìyù** (凝翠玉) is known,
In the **lú** (炉), no trace of **huáng qīng** (黄轻) remains.
Transformation and fusion proceed with divine precision,
Interdependent as **yīn** and **yáng** in their celestial harmony.
Tossing and turning, it repeatedly purges **sùchén** (宿尘),
For **tēngdǎo** (腾倒) serves to amplify its **qìshù** (气数).

The *Tài Yì Gē* (太易歌) states:
*"Wēiwēi tēngdǎo tiāndì jīng,
Zhuān cù yīn yáng zǒu shén guǐ yě."*
Do not complain of sluggishness or cling to delay.
The **lóng zhēng hǔ zhàn** (龙争虎战) must ultimately return to its **shǐ** (始).

The **yīn** retreats while the **yáng** flourishes—**yào** grows ever truer.
The **lóng** and **hǔ** mutually engage, and the **yào** gradually attains **tōnglíng** (通灵).

The *Yuánsāng Zǐ Gē* (元阳子歌) says:
*"Qīnglóng zhú hǔ, hǔ xúnlóng,
Suǒwèi lóng zhēng hǔ zhàn zhě yě."*
When the **yīn** essence is refined and returned to its **yuán** (元) source,
The **shénxiān** (神仙) call it **báilángxū** (白琅圩).
**Lángxū** (琅吁) is but another name for **jīndān** (金丹),
Speaking of its purity like jade’s resplendent grace.

The common folk fail to grasp its true form,
And suppose the **huándān** (还丹) resembles **dānshā** (丹砂) in hue.
The *Shénshuǐ Huápó Lùn* (神水华池论) states:
*"Huán zhě guī gēn, dān zhě sè chì yě."*
From one origin, three substances align with the **sāncài** (三才),
The *Táozhēn Rén Zhōng Piān* (陶真人中篇) declares:
*"Lì qiánkūn, yùn shuǐhuǒ, yīng tiān fú, hé sāncài,
Ránhòu chéng dānshā yǐ."*
Thus, though **jīndān** (金丹) springs from a single source,
It employs three substances—**shuǐ**, **huǒ**, and **yào**—
All refined through one **mén** (门).

The **yīn** and **yáng** interact, forming the **shèng tāi** (圣胎).
Naturally nurtured, it is called **shèng** (圣).
When the **shuǐhuǒ qìshù** (水火气数) are balanced, the **jūn** (君) reveals itself,
The **zǐhéchē** (紫河车) manifests with the **cǎilián** (彩鸾).

The *Wúmíng Dào Zhě Gē* (无名道者歌) sings:
*"Xiū dào zǐhéchē, báirì chōng tiān qù."*
The **huápó** (华池) **shénshuǐ** (神水) alone proves its efficacy,
As the *Shénshuǐ Huápó Lùn* (神水华池论) states:
*"Huápó zhě qiān, shénshuǐ zhě gōng yě."*
With one ripple of the autumn wave, clarity penetrates to the depths.
Refined within the **dǐng** (鼎), **yánghuǒ** (阳火) presses close,

「Then there are the faint yet frequent roars of tigers and dragons.
Press them with **lífhuǒ** (离火), stir them with **xùnfēng** (巽风),
And the tigers and dragons clash in battle—
Their thunder heard beyond the forge.

Though the mouth consumes little, the body remains cold,
How could one dread the slow march of years?
With steadfast resolve, one seeks within the embrace of **liàn** (炼),
Yet shuns the **xíngzhǐ guìmén** (行止贵门) of the vulgar.

Noble in pursuit, one does not serve kings or nobles.
The *Jiǔ Huán Qī Fǎn* (九还七返) is hard to grasp—
**Qīng Xī Zǐ** (青霞子) says:
From the eleventh month to the seventh month, it is called **jiǔ huán** (九还).
From the first month to the seventh month, it is called **qī fǎn** (七返).
When **qi** (气) condenses into **shā** (砂), and **shuǐ** (水) transforms into **jīn** (金),
The **jūn** (君) arises from the interplay of **shuǐhuǒ qìshù** (水火气数).

To master the **wǔxíng** (五行) and **sìxiàng** (四象),
The dragon naturally bows in reverence within the **dǐng** (鼎).
If one can employ the **wǔxíng** (五行) and **sìxiàng** (四象),
Then the dragon’s bow will respond in kind.

Beneath **Kūnlún Shān** (昆仑山), the **xuánzhū** (玄珠) is found—
Two substances dwell in one source.
The **xuánzhū** (玄珠) is likened to the supreme treasure,
The two substances refer to the **yàogēn jī** (药根基).

An ancient song declares:
*"If two substances are known to unite as one,
Then the three flowers will reveal the hidden solitary wheel."*
When the **yīnyáng yuánqì** (阴阳元气) are refined to sufficiency,
One knows the **jīndān** (金丹) originates from the void.

Dull and obtuse, yet simple and unassuming,
Without intention, without contrivance, without scheme—
Once the **xīyí zhì** (希夷旨) is recognized,
One finds the **Xuánmén** (玄门) path worth returning to.

The Master himself spoke of delight in the profound and mysterious—
The **Xuánmiào** (玄妙) **Xuánmén** (玄门) indeed.
Though he scorns the coarse and vulgar, he loves the refined and elegant,
For the path to **chángshēng** (长生) is worth traversing.

Those who greedily chase fame and gain, enslaved by **chī** (痴),
Do not heed the **liúnián** (流年) as it flees like passing waves.
They deceive and mock the world, indulging in desires and sensuous pleasures,
Seeking **mínglì** (名利), yet never entering the **chángshēng** (长生) path,
And so they meet decline—
Like waves that never return.

**Gōngyīn** (汞) transforms into **jīn** (金), **jīn** (金) into **shā** (砂),
And **jīnshā** (金砂) gradually becomes **zǐhéchē** (紫河车).
When the **jīnshā** (金砂) **qi** (气) is abundant,
It forms the **zǐhéchē** (紫河车).
If one refines **jīndān** (金丹) and attains the **zǐhéchē** (紫河车),
Then the path to **Pénglái** (蓬莱) will be without delay.

The supreme elixir shines with **líng** (灵) efficacy,
And **shénxiān** (神仙) may yet be hoped for.
When the **qiántǔn** (乾坤) are aligned in the **dǐng** (鼎),
And the **tǔlóng** (虎龙) are formed,
The **sìxiàng** (四象) revolve harmoniously, the **èrqì** (二气) unite—
To grasp the **Huápó** (华池)’s true essence,
The **jīndān** (金丹) will naturally arise.

Understanding the **sìxiàng** (四象) in their shifts,
Recognizing the **èrqì** (二气) in their interplay,
Then **jīndān** (金丹) and **shā** (砂) will transform and take form.
From **wú** (无) arises **yǒu** (有), and **yǒu** (有) returns to **wú** (无)—
Now present, now absent,
Faint and elusive as the utmost precision is nurtured.
The **rìyuè** (日月) drive each other across the **bǐqū** (碧虚).

Without meeting a **zhìrén** (至人) to teach the oral **kè** (诀),

It is futile to read through the five chariots of books in vain.
The true scripture says: *"A little one may gain, much one may be confused."*
It also says: *"Without a master, one clings to texts—never truly comprehending the Way.*
Thus, it is known that without meeting a **zhìrén** (至人) to teach the oral **kè** (诀),
even vast reading yields no benefit.

The foundation of longevity lies in **huángyá** (黄芽).
For **huángyá** (黄芽) is the true essence of the elixir.
When **Húgāngzǐ** (狐刚子) asked **Wèigōng** (魏公):
*"What is **huángyá** (黄芽) made of?"*
**Wèigōng** (魏公) replied:
*"It is lead, yet not lead—five metals arise from the refined **qi** (精) of lead."*

**Qīngxīzǐ** (青霞子) said:
*"If it is lead, why chase lead ten thousand miles?
If it is not lead, why begin with lead?"*
Lead is the **mother** of **huángyá** (黄芽),
And **huángyá** (黄芽) is the **child** of lead.
Once **jīnhuá** (金华) is attained,
No need to gather lead again.

It is also said:
*"In the **huītáng** (灰池) of scorching flames,
Lead sinks, silver floats—
This is called **huángqīng** (黄轻), also **jīnhuá** (金华),
**qiūshí** (秋石), **huángyá** (黄芽),
and **wángyáng** (王阳).*
It is named **huángyá** (黄芽)
because of its yellow hue—
Like the first sprouts of all things,
thus it is called **huángyá** (黄芽).*
He who attains it holds the treasure of longevity.

Subdue and refine it to return to the **wùjǐ** (戊己) lineage.
**Wùjǐ** (戊己) are the vessels of the **dǐng** (鼎).
The **Lǎojūn** (老君) hymn says:
*"**Wùjǐ** (戊己) is the primal foundation;
Water and fire determine superiority and inferiority."*
It is also said:
*"One must complete the **wùjǐ** (戊己) work—
Never speak of it in terms of iron."*

The **Yùnángsòng** (玉囊颂) proclaims:
*"To know the Great Elixir’s foundation,
One must obtain the central **wùjǐ** (戊己) soil.*
Wait until water and silver form **báiyè** (白液),
Then use **báiyè** (白液) to forge **dānsī** (丹砂).*
For **dānsī** (丹砂) arises from **jīnyè** (金液).*

In tattered **máyī** (麻衣) and dusty exile,
I wander lost, my body mingled with the world.
Yet within me flows a single clear pool of **qīngchéng** (清澄) water—
I seek neither fame nor fortune, nor any man’s aid.
For the treasure within this water
Demands no noble patrons,
No pursuit of **zānyīn** (簪缨) rank.

**Huángjīng** (黄精) and **chìsuǐ** (赤髓) congeal into **sī** (砂).
**Huángjīng** (黄精) is the refined **qi** (精) of **huángyá** (黄芽).*
The **Jīnbìgē** (金碧歌) states:
*"**Chìsuǐ** (赤髓) flows as **gǒng** (汞),
And **gǒng** (汞) congeals into **sī** (砂).*
**Báihǔ** (白虎) and **Qīnglóng** (青龙) are of one origin—
**Báihǔ** (白虎) and **Qīnglóng** (青龙) are but strong names;
They are the **qi** (气) of metal and wood,
Blended to condense into the purest elixir.

Yet all before my eyes I fail to see,
And instead take worthless substances as **huángyá** (黄芽).
The *Pāntóngqì* (参同契) says:
*"Things of the same kind gather together;
Disparate matters never yield a treasure."*

The Master further says:
*"To plant grain, use millet;
To cover the hen, use its own offspring.
Qīngxiyazi says:
*'Of like kind they gather;
Disparate things divide—
The *luán* does not nurse the *què*,
Nor is the fox a *mǎwéi*."*

Three thousand maidens attend the subtle mysteries,
The Eight Trigrams cycle back to *xùn* and wood.
*Xùn* is wind, the maiden is the clepsydra—
Pushing and sorting to reveal their numbers.

Scholars fail to grasp the *Xuān*’s true intent,
Yet indulge in sound and color, mere empty forms.

The Classic states:
*"The Yellow Emperor consorted with three thousand women,
Ascending in broad daylight.
Few had but one wife—
Some even lost their lives.
Thus, men who prize beauty and multiply
Meet ruin in the end.

Yet few know the *Xuān*’s secret to transcendence—
The virtue of *huándān* itself.

The deepest mysteries of the *Xuān* are hard to fathom,
Yet within it lies the subtle truth.
Only in *kǎn* and *lí* does the return unfold—
The *Xuān*’s subtlety lies in *kǎn* and *lí*.

Nature’s mysteries align with Heaven’s design.
With each refinement, progress grows—
The chrysanthemum turns from yellow to *liáo*’s red.
As the chrysanthemum’s hue shifts,
As the *liáo*’s color changes—
Such is their transformation.

After a thousand days of refining, the furnace opens,
All things penetrate into the single cauldron.
A thousand days’ labor complete—
All phenomena are revealed within.

Do not casually pass on the *huándān*’s art,
For sages guard its secrets in their hearts.
The age pursues mercury from sand,
Yet fails to see the *Xuān*’s deeper *Xuān*.

Alas, the world extracts cinnabar in vain,
Taking liquid mercury for *dānshā*—
Little do they know the *Xuān*’s true essence of cinnabar.

Nine transformations without ceasing purification,
Frequent purification strengthens the *qi*—
The Five Phases favor water’s affinity.

Only the *dāoguī*’s power completes the elixir,
Granting the high *zhēn* to gather among the immortals.

Thunder roars as the *xùn* wind rages,
Now the autumn tiger battles the spring dragon.
The dragon and tiger devour each other—
Their clash echoes like thunder.

The Primordial Sovereign has the Three Palaces to aid,
Unshaken, seated in the Nine Enclosures.
He abides serenely atop the Three Palaces,
Undisturbed.

The *Wèi Zhēn Jun*’s Fire-Criterion Ode says:
*"The Three Palaces enfold the embryo’s form,
Receiving *qi* must mark the *bǐng-dīng* signs."*

The Dao’s gate is not distant,
Yet mortals chase the needle’s edge.

Ah, men seek only profit and fame,
Competing for trifles—
Who among the few will surpass the *zhēn* and inherit our way?

The silent *zhēnlíng*’s work is now complete,
No need to seek the *Jīnbì* or *Pāntóngqì*.
To know the *Lónghǔ Huándān*’s secret—
Its essence lies clearly here.

The *Lónghǔ Huándān*’s precepts are now complete.
