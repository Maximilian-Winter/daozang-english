**Huangdi Neijing – Ling Shu (Excerpt)**

Huangdi asked: *"When a person first takes form, what founds their essence? What establishes their order? What loss brings death? What attainment brings life?"*

Qibo replied: *"The mother is the foundation, the father the order. To lose the vital essence (*shén*) is to die; to preserve it is to live."*

Huangdi asked: *"What is this vital essence?"*

Qibo answered: *"When blood and qi harmonize, when the nourishing (*róng*) and defensive (*wèi*) circulations flow freely, when the five viscera are complete, and when the vital essence (*shén*) resides in the heart while the soul (*hún*) and spirit (*pò*) are fully present—only then is one fully formed. When the nourishing and defensive circulations move without deviation, when the six bowels transform grains, and when fluids are dispersed—only then can one endure long."*

Within heaven and earth, within the six directions, nothing exists apart from the Five Phases. So too does the human body conform.

Huangdi asked: *"What is meant by ‘virtue (*dé*) and qi generating essence, spirit, soul, spirit-soul (*pò*), heart, intention (*yì*), will (*zhì*), thought (*sī*), wisdom (*zhì*), and deliberation (*lǜ*)’? I wish to understand their origins."*

Qibo replied: *"The heaven within us is virtue (*dé*); the earth within us is qi. When virtue flows and qi gathers, life emerges. Thus, the coming of life is called essence (*jīng*). When two essences converge, it is called spirit (*shén*). When spirit moves in and out, it is called soul (*hún*). When essence enters and exits together, it is called spirit-soul (*pò*). That which governs the body is called the heart. When the heart recalls, it is called intention (*yì*). Where intention dwells is called will (*zhì*). When will stores and transforms, it is called thought (*sī*). When thought reaches far and yearns, it is called deliberation (*lǜ*). When deliberation governs actions, it is called wisdom (*zhì*).*

*Therefore, the wise in nurturing life must align with the Four Seasons, moderating cold and heat; harmonize joy and anger, securing dwelling; regulate yin and yang, balancing softness and firmness. Thus, perverse influences will not take hold, and longevity will follow."*

Qibo said: *"Blood, qi, and spirit are what sustain life and circulate through nature and destiny. The channels are what conduct blood and qi, nourishing yin and yang, moistening sinews and bones, and lubricating joints. The defensive qi is what warms flesh and muscle, fills the skin, and governs the opening and closing of pores. Will and intention are what govern spirit, gather the soul and spirit-soul, and adapt to cold and heat, joy and anger.*

*Thus, when blood harmonizes, the channels flow freely, nourishing and defensive circulations move, sinews and bones grow strong, and joints move smoothly. When defensive qi harmonizes, nails and hair grow firm, skin becomes supple, and pores close tightly. When will and intention harmonize, spirit becomes focused, soul and spirit-soul do not scatter, regret and anger do not arise, and the five viscera resist noxious influences. When cold and heat are balanced, the six bowels transform grains, rheumatic disorders do not arise, and the channels and joints remain unobstructed. This is the natural equilibrium of humanity.*

*The five viscera store spirit, blood, qi, soul, and spirit-soul. The six bowels transform water and grain, conducting fluids. Thus, humanity fully receives what is granted by heaven."*

Qibo said: *"When both yin and yang flourish, pathogenic influences find purchase."*

Qibo said: *"When pathogenic and righteous influences invade from without and have not yet found a fixed lodging, when they wander through the viscera without a settled place, they move with the nourishing and defensive circulations, causing the soul and spirit-soul to flutter—this makes one restless externally and prone to vivid dreams."*

**Chapter on the Six Qi**

Huangdi asked: *"I have heard that humans possess essence, qi, fluids, blood, and vessels. I had thought these were but one qi. Now you distinguish them as six names. I do not understand. Pray, explain what is meant by essence?"*

Qibo replied: *"When two essences converge and form shape, they precede the body in existence—this is called essence (*jīng*)."*

Huangdi asked: *"What is qi?"*

Qibo replied: *"The upper burner opens and disperses the flavors of the five grains, perfuming the skin, filling the body, and moistening the hair—like dew watering the earth. This is called qi."*

Huangdi asked: *"What are fluids (*jīn*)?"*

Qibo replied: *"When the pores emit sweat, this is called fluids (*jīn*)."*

Huangdi asked: *"What is essence-fluid (*yè*)?"*

Qibo replied: *"When grain-qi is abundant, it descends as essence-fluid, moistening the bones so that joints bend and extend. It supplements the brain and marrow, and nourishes the skin and hair—this is called essence-fluid (*yè*)."*

Huangdi asked: *"What is blood?"*

Qibo replied: *"The middle burner receives blood from the juices, transforming it into red—this is called blood."*

Huangdi asked: *"What are vessels (*mài*)?"*

Qibo replied: *"They contain and direct the nourishing qi, ensuring it has no place to evade—this is called vessels (*mài*)."*

*"When one exhales, qi exits; when one inhales, qi enters. The celestial vital qi, in its great measure, exits three times for every once it enters. Thus, if grains are not ingested for half a day, qi weakens; if a full day passes, qi diminishes. The upper burner is like mist, the middle like a ditch, the lower like stagnant water."*

Huangdi asked: *"By what paths do the nourishing and defensive circulations enter and exit?"*

Qibo replied: *"The nourishing circulation emerges from the middle burner, the defensive from the upper. The pure is nourishing (*róng*), the impure is defensive (*wèi*). The nourishing resides within the vessels, the defensive without. The nourishing circulates endlessly, completing fifty cycles before reuniting. Yin and yang interpenetrate like an unbroken ring.*

*The defensive qi travels twenty-five degrees through yin and twenty-five through yang, dividing day and night. Thus, qi moves toward yang and halts at yin.*

*Essence-fluid is what irrigates essence and moistens the orifices. If the upper fluid pathway opens and tears flow uncontrollably, essence-fluid is exhausted. When essence-fluid is exhausted, essence cannot irrigate, and the eyes lose their sight."*

The Five Zang [organs] store the vital essence, spirit, soul, and ethereal soul within them. The Six Fu [bowels] receive the grains and conduct them, receive the qi and disperse it. The channels and vessels receive blood and nourish it, converging to govern the body.

In a healthy person, when the stomach is full, the intestines are empty; when the intestines are full, the stomach is empty. This alternating fullness and emptiness allow qi to flow upward and downward, stabilizing the Five Zang, harmonizing the blood and vessels, and allowing spirit to reside. Thus, spirit is the refined essence and qi of water and grains.

When qi resides in the vessels, if evil qi is in the upper regions, it means the evil qi entering the body is high, hence its presence above. If turbid qi is in the middle, it means that water and grains all enter the stomach, with its refined qi ascending to the lungs, while turbid qi flows to the abdomen and stomach. This occurs when cold and heat are unbalanced, or when diet is improper, leading to illness in the abdomen and stomach—thus it is called turbid qi in the middle. If refined qi is in the lower regions, it means the damp and earthly qi must originate from the feet, hence refined qi is said to be below.

When yin and yang separate, cold and heat contend, and the two qi clash, they coalesce into abscesses and pus.

Qibo said: *"The qi that people receive is the essence of grains. The essence of grains flows into the stomach, which is the sea of water, grains, qi, and blood. From this sea, vapors rise and disperse into the vast heavens. The stomach’s output is qi and blood, flowing through the channels and vessels—the great networks of the Five Zang and Six Fu. The lungs pair with the large intestine, which is the transmitting Fu. The heart pairs with the small intestine, which is the receiving Fu. The liver pairs with the gallbladder, which is the repository of refined essence. The spleen pairs with the stomach, which is the Fu of the five grains. The kidneys pair with the bladder, which is the Fu of body fluids. The lesser yin belongs to the kidneys, and kidney qi ascends to connect with the lungs, thus governing the two Zang. The Triple Burner is the Fu of the middle, from which water flows. These are the Fu that pair with the Zang.*

*The Five Zang constantly circulate within the upper seven orifices. Thus, lung qi connects to the nose, and when the nose is harmonized, it can discern fragrant and foul odors. Heart qi connects to the tongue, and when the tongue is harmonized, it can perceive the five flavors. Liver qi connects to the eyes, and when the eyes are harmonized, they can distinguish the five colors. Spleen qi connects to the mouth, and when the mouth is harmonized, it can recognize the five grains. Kidney qi connects to the ears, and when the ears are harmonized, they can hear the five tones. If the Five Zang are disharmonized, the seven orifices will not function. If the Six Fu are disharmonized, stagnation and blockages form as abscesses.

Thus, when evil is in the Fu, the yang vessels are obstructed, and when the yang vessels are obstructed, qi stagnates, causing yang qi to flourish. When yang qi flourishes excessively, the yin vessels are obstructed, and when the yin vessels are obstructed, qi stagnates, causing yin qi to flourish. When yin qi flourishes excessively, yang cannot nourish, hence *guān* [closure]. When yang qi flourishes excessively, yin cannot nourish, hence *gé* [blockage]. When both yin and yang flourish excessively and cannot nourish each other, it is called *guān gé* [closure-blockage]. Closure-blockage means death before the natural term.

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Why does qi circulate through the Five Zang but not nourish the Six Fu?"*

Qibo replied: *"Qi cannot cease to flow, like water flowing or the sun and moon moving endlessly. Thus, yin vessels nourish the Zang, and yang vessels nourish the Fu, like an unbroken ring with no beginning or end, eternally returning. The overflowing qi irrigates the Zang and Fu internally and moistens the body’s exterior.*

*The mind resides in the heart, allowing one to know past and present. The heart is the great sovereign of the Five Zang and Six Fu, the dwelling of spirit. If its storage is firm, evil cannot penetrate. If it does, the heart is injured, spirit departs, and death follows. Retreat to a quiet place, letting spirit wander freely. Close doors and windows, and the soul and ethereal soul will not scatter. Focus the mind on one spirit, and essence and qi will not disperse. Exclude human sounds to gather essence, and concentrate the spirit. Close the outer gates, and true qi will be preserved."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"There is a single vessel that generates over ten diseases—pain, abscesses, cold, heat, itching, numbness, or insensitivity—endlessly transforming. What is its cause?"*

Qibo replied: *"These are all generated by evil qi."*

The Emperor said: *"I have heard of true qi, righteous qi, and evil qi. What is true qi?"*

Qibo replied: *"True qi is what one receives from Heaven, coexisting with grain qi to fill the body. Righteous qi is the proper wind, coming from one direction—neither solid nor hollow wind. Evil qi is the hollow wind’s harm, injuring people. When it enters deeply, it cannot depart on its own. When righteous wind enters, it does so shallowly and departs naturally. Its qi is gentle and weak, unable to overcome true qi, hence it departs. When hollow evil enters, it stirs the form, raises the body hair, and opens the pores. If it penetrates deeply, pressing against the bones, it causes bone numbness. If it presses against the vessels, blood does not flow, causing abscesses. If it presses internally, clashing with defensive qi, if yang prevails, it causes heat; if yin prevails, it causes cold. Cold drives true qi away, and when true qi departs, cold presses between the skin and flesh, causing the pores to open, raising the body hair, and dispersing qi—this is insensitivity. If hollow evil lodges unilaterally in the body, entering deeply and assaulting the nourishing and defensive qi, when these weaken, true qi departs while evil remains, manifesting as hemiplegia."*

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"I have heard that the intestines and stomach receive grains, the upper burner produces qi to warm the nails and flesh while nourishing the bones and joints, and moistens the pores. The middle burner produces qi like dew, ascending to the valleys and seeping into the channels, harmonizing body fluids and transforming red into blood."*

The blood harmonizes, the channels and vessels first become full.
When full, it flows into the collaterals;
when the collaterals are all replete, it returns to the channels.
When yin and yang are properly balanced, the breath moves accordingly.

Its movement follows the great principles,
its circulation adheres to natural laws,
in harmony with Heaven’s rhythms,
never ceasing.

When examined and regulated,
from emptiness to fullness—
if drained, deficiency ensues;
if overstimulated, the qi is exhausted.
If retained in sequence,
from fullness to emptiness—
if supplemented, excess arises.
Once blood and qi are balanced,
the form and spirit are sustained.

I have learned of the balance and imbalance of blood and qi,
but I do not know
how flaccid ulcers arise,
the timing of their success or failure,
the periods of life and death—
near or distant—
and how to measure them.
May I inquire further?

**Qibo replied:**
The channels and vessels flow without ceasing,
in rhythm with Heaven’s degrees,
in harmony with Earth’s cycles.
Thus, when celestial hosts stray from their courses,
when eclipses obscure the sun and moon,
when Earth’s pathways falter,
when waterways overflow,
when dwellings crumble and crops fail,
when roads are impassable,
when people cannot travel,
when streets and settlements are abandoned—
yet blood and qi still circulate.
Let me explain the reason.

The blood and vessels, the defensive and nourishing,
circulate endlessly.
Above, they correspond to the stars and constellations;
below, they align with the channel pathways.

When cold qi invades the channels and vessels,
the blood congeals.
When blood congeals, it does not flow;
when it does not flow, the defensive qi converges there,
unable to return.
Thus, flaccidity and swelling arise.

When cold transforms into heat,
heat prevails and rots the flesh.
When flesh rots, it becomes pus;
when pus does not drain, the sinews decay.
When sinews decay, the bones are injured;
when bones are injured, the marrow is consumed.
When marrow is consumed, the bones hollow;
when bones hollow and cannot drain,
the sinews wither and the bones become empty.
Then sinews, bones, and muscles fail to nourish each other,
the channels and vessels deteriorate and leak,
darkening the five viscera.
When the viscera are injured, death follows.

**Deranged Vision (Discussion on the Eyes)**
Qibo said:
The refined essences of the five viscera and six bowels
all ascend to the eyes and form the pupil.
The eyes are the refined essences of the five viscera and six bowels,
constantly nourished by the defensive and nourishing,
where spirit and vitality originate.

Thus, when the spirit is exhausted, the soul and ethereal spark scatter,
and the will becomes disordered.
Therefore, the black pupil follows yin,
while the white sclera and red vessels follow yang.
Thus, when yin and yang move together, the eyes are clear.

The eyes are the heart’s emissaries,
and the heart is the spirit’s dwelling.
Hence, when the spirit is divided and the eyes are disordered,
they do not turn.
If suddenly confronted with the extraordinary,
the spirit, soul, and ethereal spark scatter,
unable to reunite,
and derangement ensues.

**The Yellow Emperor asked:**
What qi causes a person to be prone to forgetfulness?

**Qibo replied:**
When the upper qi is insufficient and the lower qi is excessive,
when the intestines and stomach are full while the heart and lungs are empty,
emptiness causes the nourishing and defensive to linger below,
and if they do not ascend in due time,
forgetfulness ensues.

**Discussion on Speechlessness**
**The Yellow Emperor asked:**
What blocks the path, what qi does not flow,
that a person suddenly falls into sorrow and cannot speak?
I wish to hear the method.

**The Minor Teacher replied:**
The throat is the passage for water and grains;
the larynx is the conduit for ascending and descending qi;
the epiglottis is the door of sound;
the lips are the bellows of sound;
the tongue is the mechanism of sound;
the uvula is the gate of sound;
the cheeks and jaws are where divided qi disperses;
the hyoid bone is where spirit qi commands,
governing the tongue’s release.

Thus, when nasal passages leak and tears flow uncontrollably,
the jaw does not close properly,
and divided qi escapes.

If the epiglottis is small and thin,
the released qi is swift,
its opening and closing agile,
and the exhaled breath is effortless.
If the epiglottis is large and thick,
its opening and closing are difficult,
the exhaled breath is slow,
and speech becomes labored.
This is what is called "heaviness of speech."

If suddenly speechless,
cold qi invades the epiglottis,
preventing its release.
When the release fails to reach the tongue and lips,
their opening and closing become sluggish,
and thus, no sound emerges.
