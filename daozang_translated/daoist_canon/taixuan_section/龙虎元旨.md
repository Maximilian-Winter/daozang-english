**The Fundamental Essence of the Dragon and Tiger**

The *Dragon and Tiger* refer to *lead and mercury* (yín gǒng). Mercury is the Dragon, lead is the Tiger.
The mother conceals the child within her womb; the child hides within the mother’s embrace.
Know the white while guarding the black; divine clarity will naturally arise.

The white is the essence of gold (*jīn*), the black is the foundation of water (*shuǐ*).
The method of using lead is subtle and profound—this is what is meant.

That which cannot be recognized must be known; merely rely on Heaven’s nature, and it will be encountered naturally.

Now, take Heaven’s *qi* (arcanum), add Earth’s *qi* (arcanum), and combine the essences of the Sun and Moon to form the Dao of yin and yang.
Mercury is the Azure Dragon, its trigrammatic master is *Zhèn* (☳, Thunder), its hidden master is the liver, and it governs the east with *jiǎ yǐ* (甲乙, Wood).
Wood can generate fire; its original form is azure, but when it meets fire, it becomes vermilion—thus, it transforms into *cinnabar* (dānshā).
It becomes the Vermilion Bird, its trigrammatic master is *Lí* (☲, Flame), its hidden master is the heart, and it governs the south with *bǐng dīng* (丙丁, Fire).
Lí is yang; when yang reaches its peak, yin arises—thus, cinnabar generates mercury within it.
The two strokes in Lí represent the golden rooster (yīng).
The golden rooster within the Sun is also yin.

Lead is the Dark Turtle, its trigrammatic master is *Kàn* (☵, Abyss), its hidden master is the kidney, and it governs the north with *rén guǐ* (壬癸, Water).
Kàn is yin; when yin reaches its peak, yang arises—thus, lead contains white gold within it.
The one stroke in Kàn represents the silver hare (yù).
The silver hare within the Moon is also yang.

Gold is the White Tiger, its trigrammatic master is *Duì* (☱, Joy), its hidden master is the lung, and it governs the west with *gēng xīn* (庚辛, Metal).
Its nature returns to its origin; when subjected to water and fire’s consumption and refining, its hue shifts to yellow.
The yellow sprout signifies transformation, arising from water and fire’s consumption and refining.

The sage does not transmit this openly; instead, it is revealed through oral formulas.
Yellow governs the spleen and is the Central Palace (*Zhōnggōng*), ruled by *wù jǐ* (戊己, Earth).
When the four substances converge into the Central Palace, the elixir is formed.
An ancient verse states:
*"The Dao is solitary yet complete—
Success alone is its fulfillment,
Returning to the Earth of the Middle."*

The liver’s azure is the father—Wood.
The lung’s white is the mother—Metal.
The kidney’s black is the child—Water.
The spleen’s yellow is Earth—Earth has no fixed form,
The sovereign rules through the four seasons,
The Five Phases mutually generate within it.

The Five Phases mutually generate and also mutually restrain.
Thus, Metal generates Water, Water generates Wood, Wood generates Fire, Fire generates Earth, Earth generates Metal—this is mutual generation.
Fire subjugates Metal, Metal subjugates Wood, Wood subjugates Earth, Earth subjugates Water, Water subjugates Fire—this is mutual restraint.
The *tooth* (yá) is Metal; it subdues Wood.
The *cinnabar* (shā) is Fire; it consumes Metal.
Lead is Water; it extinguishes Fire.
When Water is abundant, Earth restrains it.
Completing its kind, restraining its *qi*—this is the principle of **reversed restraint**.
An ancient verse states:
*"Yellow Earth is the father of Metal,
The flowing pearl is the mother of Water.
Water fears Earth as its specter—
When Earth restrains Water, flames do not rise."*

This is the **one Water, two Fires, three Woods**—
The three natures converge, forming the core principle.
Yin and yang find their pairings,
And tranquility arises naturally.

Clouds follow the Dragon,
Winds follow the Tiger.
Shadows cling to form,
Echoes answer speech.
Water’s nature is moist and descending,
Fire’s nature is ardent and ascending.
The Great Return of the Golden Elixir follows this pattern.

The formula states:
*"Within yin lies its yang,
Within yang lies its yin.
Having recognized cinnabar within mercury,
One must seek the gold encased in lead.*
The two flavors are Heaven and Earth’s greatest treasures,
The Sun and Moon’s purest essences.

The Sun is akin to yang’s *qi* (arcanum)—
It loves movement and never rests,
Hence the golden rooster and its likeness.
When yang peaks, yin arises—
Thus, the golden rooster within the Sun is yin.

The Moon is akin to yin’s *qi*—
It loves stillness and does not move,
Hence the silver hare and its likeness.
When yin peaks, yang arises—
Thus, the silver hare within the Moon is yang.

Therefore, Water without yang cannot bear,
Fire without yin cannot illuminate.
Yin *qi* descends from Heaven,
Yang *qi* ascends from Earth—
Clouds, rain, mist, and dew are its manifestations.
The male is white, the female is red—
Thus, they form the primordial pair.
Yin arises from yang,
Yang arises from yin—
This is the Great Dao of Heaven and Earth.

Now, four *liángs* (硫黃) of sulfur,
Restrained with one *cǐn* (斤) of mercury,
The four *liángs* occupy the Central Palace,
All governed by Earth and Water’s mutual restraint,
Gradually merging into one.

Mercury within the sulfur is not mercury alone—
This is not its kind, and thus, it cannot form.

People mistakenly consider sulfur as the *Great Yang* (Tàiyáng)—
Incorrect. The Sun is the essence of the Great Yang,
Yet the golden rooster within it is yin.
Thus, the Sun contains the *Great Yin* (Tàiyīn) within its yang essence—
The golden rooster is it.

Sulfur is Earth; the eight stones are of its kind—
Not the essences of yin and yang.

Transformation arises from its truth,
Its beginning and end are self-dependent.

Hú Gāng (狐剛), the son of Zǐ (子), asked:
*"The elixir of the Azure and Yellow—
All possess their truth.
The eight stones’ efficacy is not negligible.
Why does cinnabar alone secure longevity?"*

Wèi Jūn (魏君) replied:
*"Femininity in stone, masculinity in sulfur—
Repel malevolence, dispel evil.
Stone quartz and *zhuó* (鐘乳, stalactite)—
Nourish marrow, replenish essence.
Magnetism when yang arises—
Treat the kidney’s afflictions.
Cloud mother (*yǔnmǔ*, mica) when taken long—
Cold and heat cannot invade.
Jade fragments when consumed often—
Spirit remains unscattered.
Cǒnggōng (孔公) purple stone—
Body becomes plump and robust.
Fire mountain (*huǒshān*, sulfur) and cannon cinnabar—
Break *líng* (玲, phlegm) with immediate effect.
Once-green (*cèngqīng*, malachite) and empty-green (*kōngqīng*, azurite)—
Boil mercury until it dries.
Ancient records and transmissions state:
Sulfur scatters *pì* (癖, phlegm).
Scriptures of the immortals declare:
Red stone and cinnabar—
Naturally, they do not die.

If one’s *qi* is weak, blood is scattered, body exhausted, and bones dry—
The eight stones’ efficacy can slightly enhance.
If one seeks longevity, eternal vision, preservation of life, and tranquility of spirit—
One must ingest cinnabar.

The eight stones meet fire, all become ash.
Cinnabar enters fire, transforming into quicksilver.
It can be heavy or light,
Divine or responsive,
Dark or bright—
This is the nature of the Five Phases.
When meeting fire, it ascends swiftly and lightly—
Ghosts and spirits seek it, yet cannot find.

All Dragon and Tiger interactions,
Their transformations are firm and steadfast.

The powdered form, when ingested, transforms the intestines into sinews.
Thus, when baked in clay, it becomes pottery that does not decay for a thousand years.
When mixed into flesh, no corruption can dissolve it.
The Golden Elixir, once taken into the body, grants immortality for a thousand years.

It is also said:
The Golden Elixir enters the five viscera,
Its mist disperses like wind and rain.
Its vapors permeate the four limbs,
Bestowing radiant and youthful complexion.
Old men become vigorous youths,
Aged women transform into bewitching maidens.
Teeth and gums regenerate effortlessly,
And one escapes the calamities of mortal life—
Thus, they are called *True Persons*.
How could the efficacy of the Golden Elixir
Be compared to the eight stones?

The method of cultivating the Great Elixir
Does not lie in the abundance of ingredients,
But in the precise application of technique.

An ancient verse states:
*"If lead is true, it is a loyal retainer.
If lead is false, mercury will not unite with it."*

The *Green Waist Messenger* (once-green),
The *Red Blood General* (realgar),
The *White Tiger* (silver) as the brain,
The *Yellow Sprout* (yellow sprout) as the sinew.

The *White Tiger* is silver,
The *Yellow Sprout* is earth,
The *Green Waist* is once-green (copper sulfate),
The *Red Blood* is realgar.

*Green Mist Master* said:
*"Lead is the fire’s retainer,
Mercury and wood are of the same lineage—
Thus, it is called a loyal retainer."*

The *Yellow Sprout* is the earth within the sand,
The root of the lineage.
Its meaning is profound—
A secret known only to the True Master.

*Green Mist Master* said:
*"The Dao is not the ordinary Dao,
Mysterious beyond mystery.
Approach it, and you see no head;
Follow it, and you see no tail.
Sudden in the void, its form emerges—
This is the Yang within Yin.
Sudden in the existent, its form vanishes—
This is the Yin within the intestines.
Who names it the Yellow Sprout?
It is the union of husband and wife."*

*Fox the Firm* asked: *"What is the Yellow Sprout made of?"*
*Wei Gong* replied:
*"It uses lead, yet does not use lead.
The Five Metals are born from lead.
Lead is the marrow of the Five Metals,
The excellent mediator of the Seven Treasures,
The honored sovereign of the Eight Stones.
The Five Metals must avoid lead—
Do not mistakenly employ it.
Refined lead, refined lead—
Lead is refined into it."*

*Fox the Firm* asked: *"Fortunate to hear of the Yellow Sprout,
I dare ask: What vessel is used to refine lead?"*
*Wei Gong* replied:
*"The cauldron is not a cauldron,
The medicine is not medicine.
The Yellow Sprout is not lead—
It must be forged within lead.
To recognize the Yellow Sprout,
One must not stray from lead’s foundation.
Without the Yellow Sprout’s gate,
Even lead must be misapplied."*

*Green Mist Master* said:
*"If the Sprout is lead, abandon lead ten thousand miles.
If the Sprout is not lead, begin with lead.
Lead is the Sprout’s mother,
The Sprout is lead’s child.
If one obtains the Golden Flower,
Lead is discarded and not used."*

It is also said:
*"The cauldron is not a golden cauldron,
The furnace is not a Yue furnace.
From Kan’s depths, it ascends,
In the soil of Dui, it resides.
When the three natures converge,
The two essences naturally unite.
The embryo is secured, unspilled,
Transformation occurs in an instant."*

The secret states:
*"White gold is the sovereign,
The essence of black lead,
Of the Western position,
Yet containing the essence of Minor Yang.
Further refined within lead,
Its divine function becomes true.
In the ash-pit’s furnace,
Lead sinks, silver floats—
This is called Yellow Lightness,
Also the Golden Flower,
Also Autumn Stone,
Also Yellow Sprout.
Its nature is subtly warm—
Already a treasure of longevity.
Yet, the lone Yang’s fang is insufficient.
Only when Yin and Yang unite
Do they become sovereign and minister.
Thus, the Yellow Emperor obtained the beauty of the Golden Flower,
And thus it is called *Beautiful Golden Flower*."*

The *Huainan King* said of Autumn Stone:
*"The eighth month’s node,
The Western position—
Because of its white color,
It is called Autumn Stone."*

*Wang Yang* called it the Yellow Sprout,
*"Because its yellow hue resembles the first sprouts of all things,
Thus it is called Yellow Sprout."*

Its essence originates from one source,
Yet it is named differently by each master.

Once-green (copper sulfate) is the *qi*,
Illuminating the four quarters.
Realgar is the *messenger*,
Its brilliance radiant.
Like a trustworthy mediator,
They unite and mutually assist—
When the great work is complete,
Each has its designated role.

The Eight Stones are abandoned,
While the Yellow emerges from Wudu.
Only gold and water
Dazzle like pearls of light.
Understand its meaning,
And the divine path will support you.

The secret states:
*"Gold’s nature is refined,
Born from the utmost Yang.
Mercury is produced from cinnabar.
Stone’s nature is hot,
Born from the utmost Yin.
Silver is produced from lead.
The two essences each obtain the original *qi* of Heaven and Earth.
Water and fire consume and refine—
Stone sinks, gold floats.
Sovereign and minister reverse,
Yin becomes Yang,
Sovereign becomes minister—
Only then do Yin and Yang rely on each other,
Sovereign and minister harmonize.
This is the supreme mystery of the Immortals,
The origin of the Great Dao.
Above and below, water and fire,
Rise and fall according to time—
Thousands of transformations, ten thousand changes,
None surpass the interplay of lead and mercury.
Like things gather,
Opposing things cannot form a single kind.
Thus, sparrows do not give birth to phoenixes,
Foxes do not nurse colts—
Hence, the necessity of kindred affinity."*

*Green Mist Master* said:
*"All things teem and return to their roots.
Gold is born from water,
The gateway to all marvels.
When Yin and Yang ignite,
Above and below surge—
The divine embryo is unspilled,
The spirit is bound, the soul confined.
Like things unite,
Opposing things separate—
Sparrows do not birth phoenixes,
Foxes are not horses in drought."*

The secret states:
*"Eight *liang* of Yellow Sprout,
Belongs to Heaven, to Firmness, to the Yang Dragon.
Eight *liang* of mercury,
Belongs to Earth, to Softness, to the Yin Tiger.
Thus it is said:
Heaven and Earth, Firm and Soft,
Yin and Yang, Dragon and Tiger.
Eight *liang* of fang (tooth),
Eight *liang* of mercury,
Together making one *jin*—
In accordance with the two strings [of the *Luo* vessel].
Each *liang* has four *fen*,
Sixty-four *fen* in total—
In accordance with the sixty-four hexagrams.
Each *fen* has six *chǐ* (dram),
Totaling three hundred eighty-four *chǐ*—
In accordance with the three hundred eighty-four lines.
Also symbolizing a year’s three hundred sixty days,
Together with the twenty-four seasons,
Completing the number three hundred eighty-four.
One for Water,
Two for Fire,
Three for Wood,
Four for Metal,
Five for Earth—
In accordance with the Five Phases.
Five days make a *hou* (watch),
Forty-five days make a node—
Thus, the ancients relied on the *Yijing* for its symbolism."*

The solitary Yin cannot form, the solitary Yang cannot generate—
Only when Yin and Yang unite does the Dao flourish.

Its medicine, like a child in the womb,
Or a fruit upon the tree,
Is seen only when ripe,
Yet its transformations remain unfathomable.

Firm yet yielding, it is meticulously refined,
No leakage allowed—
Arising from the hour of *Yin* (3 AM),
Peaking at the hour of *Wu* (noon),
And ending at the hour of *Xu* (7 PM).

At first, Fire—one Yang—gives birth to the *Gèn* (Restoring) hexagram,
Proceeding through *Lín* (Approaching), *Tài* (Peace), *Dà Zhuàng* (Great Strength),
*Yáng* (Nourishing), *Qián* (The Creative), *Rùn* (The Receptive),
*Dùn* (Retreat), *Pǐ* (Opposition), *Guān* (Contemplation), *Bō* (Shedding),
*Kūn* (The Receptive)—
Until at *Rùn*, the Fire is extinguished,
And at *Kūn*, the process concludes.

Its medicine, when attaining the flavor of Metal, is pungent;
When attaining the flavor of Wood, is sour;
When attaining the flavor of Water, is salty;
When attaining the flavor of Fire, is bitter—
Circulating through the four directions,
And returning to the central palace,
Where it attains the flavor of Earth and is sweet.

Thus it is called the *Huan Dan* (Returning Elixir) of the Five Phases,
Its flavors complete, returning to the central palace of *Wu Ji* (Earth).
Only then does it earn the name *Huan Dan*.

Now, what is called *Dan* is but the name for its red hue.
*Huan* means returning to its original essence.
If its flavor is not sweet,
Though it bears a red hue, it is not *Huan Dan*.

When the Five Phases traverse the twelve hexagrams,
And complete the cycle of two eights (16),
It does not exceed one *jin*—
From the lower to the upper strings,
Penetrating the Great Dao,
Beyond the grasp of ghosts and spirits,
Beyond the knowledge of sages and worthies.

The medicine is formed from mercury,
Like fruit from flowers bearing fruit,
Like a child shaped by *qi*,
And the medicine from Metal and Water forming the elixir—
Only sages and worthies can reveal the transformations within the furnace.

Yet the heavens and earth naturally achieve success—
This is the wondrous Dao of *Xuanhua* (Mysterious Transformation).

The words of the *Tàishàng* (Supreme) are not to be transmitted to the unworthy,
For the sin extends to seven generations.
If one who receives it does not transmit it,
They too will suffer the consequences.

Thus the ancient sages inscribed it,
And hid it in the stone chamber and golden coffer—
Let those who find it take it as a solemn warning.

The fire regimen begins with half a *jīn* (斤) in the eleventh month,
One *jīn* in the twelfth month,
One and a half *jīn* in the first month,
No fire in the second month,
Two *jīn* in the third month,
One and a half *jīn* in the fourth month,
Two *jīn* in the fifth month,
One and a half *jīn* in the sixth month,
One *jīn* in the seventh month,
No fire in the eighth month,
Half a *jīn* in the ninth month,
Four *liǎng* (两) in the tenth month—
until the fifteenth day to open the furnace.

If one wishes to refine the nurturing medicine,
first place it in the small furnace,
for fifteen days,
then measure the portion without reduction,
and transfer it to the large furnace,
commencing from the eleventh month,
until the *Mào-Yǒu* (卯) and *Yǒu-Xiù* (酉) hexagrams,
when no fire is used—
thus, the elixir is formed in ten months.

*Zǐ-Chǒu-Yín* (子丑寅) belong to spring,
*Mào-Chén-Sì* (卯辰巳) to summer—
these six months are of pure *yáng* (阳) energy in operation,
where *yīn* (阴) seeks *yáng*,
and Water enters Metal.

*Wǔ-Wèi-Shēn* (午未申) belong to autumn,
*Yǒu-Hài-Xū* (酉亥戌) to winter—
these six months are of pure *yīn* energy in operation,
where *yáng* seeks *yīn*,
and Metal enters Water.

The two *qì* (气) mutually vaporize—
the forms of Metal and Water constantly transform,
shifting without fixed direction,
neither ascending nor descending remains constant.
Water gains Metal and ascends,
Metal gains Water and descends—
mutually relying, they undergo transformation,
condensing within the vessel,
the body of the *Huándān* (还丹) elixir—
truly wondrous, truly wondrous!

Later gentlemen should not rashly discuss it.

The *Tàishàng* (太上) truly spoke:
"Within a hundred years of receiving my text,
one may transmit it to three persons."

Thirty years may transmit to one person.
If there is no one of like mind,
write a copy in thirty years,
exhausting its principles,
and conceal it in a cave of a sacred mountain,
awaiting those of destiny to obtain it.

Master Dongyu of Shuyue received it in the fifth year of Zhengyuan [800 CE]
from the recluse Qingxia Zi of Luofu Mountain.
In the nineteenth year of Zhengyuan [814 CE],
he transmitted it to the Prefectural Secretary Zhang Tao of Jianzhou.
In the third year of Kaicheng [838 CE],
it was passed to his kinsman Li Fen in the capital.
In the fifth year of Changqi [841 CE],
it was transmitted to the recluse Chengjun.

The oral instructions are not recorded in the text—
keep them secret, keep them secret.

The song says:

When Heaven and Earth first divided, the sun and moon ascended high,
Like a chicken egg, like a peach.
The true *qi* of *yīn* and *yáng* knows the seasons,
Waiting three years to shed the armor of battle.

The Great Dao is clear before one’s eyes,
Yet common folk misunderstand and return to the source.

The yellow sprout is the *qi* of Heaven and Earth,
Its divine foundation linked with mercury.
The *Lóng-Hǔ* (龙虎) elixir’s essence is most profound—
Within the Five *Shén* (神), mercury and lead flow.

A thousand autumns pass as purple clouds take flight,
Ascending to the head of the Great Luo Heaven.

Recognizing the root source, there is no need for haste—
Three threes combine to nine, pure *yáng* refined.

The hidden light of transformation shines forth,
From this point, ascending to Heaven draws near the Jade Emperor.

To use lead, one must obtain mercury to harmonize,
Their two natures as parents—sing the song of the daughter.

When refined to the *Zǐchē* (紫河车) stage, the earth trembles,
White clouds accompany the crane’s arrival.

Uniting Heaven and Earth, uniting the primal,
When child and mother meet, one dare not speak.

First mercury, then lead—this is the true Great Dao,
Do not let the crane depart without its companion.

This treasure has always been transmitted in twos and eights,
In auspicious years and months, placed in the furnace.

A thousand autumns’ fire follows the season,
Necessarily sprouting as mercury dries.

The essence of *Lóng-Hǔ* is complete.
