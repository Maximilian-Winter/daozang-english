### *The Dongyuan Collection, Fascicle One*
**Author:** Guishan Changquanzi

#### **First Chapter: The Supreme Book, Part One**

**Section One: The Double Mystery**
The Double Mystery illumines the vast—this is called the Primordial Obscurity. The most wondrous rides the light, and thus is supreme. It flows and spreads before the Great Ultimate, yet abides firmly after the final extinction. It enfolds Heaven and Earth, pervading the four wilds. Following what has never begun, presiding over what has never taken form, the Obscure holds the pivot, the Signified bears the Other. Chaotic and boundless, solemn and radiant—it transforms and gives birth to the ten thousand things, responding to the yearning of drought and famine. Vast and towering, it cannot be named or imaged. Thus, those who attain it dare not adorn it with disputation; those who know it dare not treat it as trivial. They preserve it with integrity and caution, abide in it with serenity and joy, and when the time is right, it flourishes greatly. It pervades the whole as one body, its numinous transformations inexhaustible. Its spirit is unfathomable, yet its essence is utterly refined.

**Section Two: The Pure and Unadorned**
The pure and unadorned abide in stillness. They treasure essence and preserve spirit, nurture *qi* in tranquility, and conceal their will in emptiness and vastness. Amidst the boundless expanse between Heaven and Earth, things cannot intrude. Whether leaning or rising, they do not lose their authenticity. They dwell in honor and prominence without delight, in poverty and lowliness without aversion. Water and fire, the four seasons—none can steal their truth. This is called possessing virtue and knowing what Heaven intends. Only then can one know the Great Mystery, the Great Order, the Great Purity, the Great Virtue, the Great Sustainer, the Great Conduct, the Great Uncarved, the Great Wisdom, the Great Tranquility, and the Great Penetration. This is perfection. The Great Mystery is trodden, the Great Order is examined, the Great Purity is inhabited, the Great Virtue is shepherded, the Great Sustainer is broadened, the Great Conduct is enacted, the Great Uncarved is completed, the Great Wisdom is deepened, the Great Tranquility is guarded, and the Great Penetration is esteemed. When these ten matters are thoroughly mastered, purity reaches its utmost. Thus, there is nothing that cannot be done, nothing that is not wondrous. Effaced and thoughtless, serene and non-active—this is its boundary.

**Section Three: Attaining the Dao**
Attaining the Dao is the accomplishment of Heaven, without limit or boundary. Vast and boundless, it fills the Six Voids, roaming beyond the Four Seas. Now observing, now leaning—like the shadowless tree of Yuzhang. Now circling, now wandering—like the garden of Three Blossoms and eternal life. Reclining at the gate of the Rare and the Utmost Unity, steadfast and at ease. In the vast chambers of the Dark Lord and Dongting, floating and settled, entering and exiting. Free and unfettered in the boundless wilds of the Great Square—its dwelling has no end. Such a person, such a principle—nothing can harm them. Wherever they go, they arrive; yet their end is unknown. Thus it is said: Though ants climb stalks, tiles and excrement, birds and beasts, grasses and trees—none are excluded. That which gives rise to things is itself no-thing. Yet the common people of the world, in their daily frenzy, know nothing of this.

**Section Four: The Great Harmony**
The Great Harmony is most wondrous—profound and boundless, its Dao deep as the transformations of water. When its primal state stirs, even divination by tortoise and milfoil cannot foretell its omens. Vast and tranquil in heart, it darkly pervades the ten thousand directions. Undifferentiated yet manifest, it revolves without constancy. Flowing in favorable times, it ripples with self-contentment. Non-active, without near or far, it harmonizes with Heaven’s order. Deceit, artifice, and false emotions—restless and agitated—cannot measure its use.

**Section Five: The Vast and Penetrating**
The vast and penetrating accord with the great sequence, spontaneously giving rise to the nature of the ten thousand things. At rest, it is like an empty valley; in motion, like a spring breeze. Its transformations cover all beings. Thus, its will is not reckless, its words have no limit or strangeness. It does not excel in Heaven’s work, nor is it clumsy in human affairs. Once it attains the center of the circle, it responds to the inexhaustible—whether left or right, it suffices.

**Section Six: The Water Mirror**
The Water Mirror is bright and clear; its Dao is resplendent, like Heaven’s hanging images. Its responses are like an echo; its reflections, like a spirit. Impartial and without omission, it embraces and fuses with the ten thousand existences. Serene and without attachment, it is limpid, luminous, and adorned. It distinguishes beauty and ugliness, long and short, movement and stillness—all are evident to the ear. Now, the hand’s grasp, the foot’s swiftness, the eye’s clarity, the ear’s acuity, the body’s beauty, the faculties’ mastery, the completion of the many—none can be altered. Disaster strikes suddenly, day by day increasing, yet people treasure it as their own—is this not perilous? Thus it is said: Its return is swift in achievement; its fruition awaits duration. Therefore, the sage governs things and orders the world—his Dao resembles this. Drifting without attachment, how could there be a place for grasping? Forms manifest themselves; it moistens above and nourishes below. Illuminating one use without weariness, things naturally turn away. The Dao has never had boundaries.

**Section Seven: Accordance with the Constant**
Accordance with the Constant is without delusion. In action and repose, it is fitting and exhausts the Dao. Holding the left tally and proceeding, pure yet accommodating things, worldly entanglements do not disturb the heart. Cultivating thought and preserving truth, though immersed in the clamor of dust, the solitary remains untransformed, entering the vast Heaven. The empty—this is the abyss of the Dao; the still—this is the dwelling of spirit. Without beginning, it first arose in the Primordial Chaos. The Primordial Chaos was divided into Heaven and Earth; Heaven and Earth arrayed the four seasons; the four seasons mysteriously turned the Five Phases; the Five Phases nourished the ten thousand transformations; the ten thousand transformations returned to the Great Beginning; the Great Beginning wondrously united with the Primal Existence. The Primal Existence—this is called the Gate of Heaven. The Gate of Heaven—this is where the primal emerges, where it enters, where it is born, where it dies. The multitude does not see its form; things return to their nature, merging with the Primordial Obscurity. The sage conceals himself therein. The ancients—their knowledge reached this point.

**Section Nine: The Obscure and Real**
The Obscure and Real wander spiritually, far and distant in the vastness of the Great Brightness.

**Section Ten: The Daoist**

Viewed through the Dao, there is no distinction of far or near, vast or minute, pure or turbid, noble or base. In this constancy, the primal emerges as yang and withdraws to conceal itself. Act with assurance yet dare not presume, and the primal will naturally prevail. From the real attain the empty, standing in the unfathomable. Pure and utterly transparent, things have no barrier before it; entering the primal’s boundlessness, yet the primal seeks no cause.

The Dao is the father and mother of Heaven and Earth, the spiritual pivot of the ten thousand things, the guiding principle of yin and yang, the revolving hub of the Five Phases and Eight Trigrams, the encompassing thread of the worthy and sage, the true dwelling of spirit and illumination, the deep source of mountains and seas, the great handle of the altars of state, the root and stem of the nature and destiny of all that moves and grows. Most revered and most noble, endless through past and present, ever naturally so—how majestic and great it is!

By this, one offers ritual to all under Heaven: ghosts lose their numinosity, and the sage does not harm the people. Thus, things that attain it live; humans that attain it endure. Dwelling finds fulfillment, affairs find continuity, conduct finds its direction, joy finds its place. Reverent yet not elated, insulted yet not angered, its tone is free of bitterness, harmonizing with Heaven’s harmony as it should. It illumines what cannot be illumined, discerns what cannot be discerned—like the sea binding the rivers, it receives all with clarity yet declines nothing, vast to the utmost.

Therefore, in stillness and silence, embody it; in profound clarity, oversee its abiding.

**Section Eleven: The Music of Heaven**

The wondrous tones of Heavenly Music arise from the Beginningless, issuing from the Great Void. They are not of metal or stone, silk or bamboo, gourd or clay, reed or pipe; not of the grand *Da Wu* or the *Zheng Wu* dances, nor the *Zhe Yang* or *Huang E* melodies. The *Sanglin* and *Jingshou* cannot be played, the notes of the twelve pitches cannot be known. Thus, strike it with Supreme Harmony, tune it with the Great Clarity, rouse it with the Cavernous Mystery, move it with the Primal Act, strike it with the Primal String. Its sound and radiance are spontaneous, without beginning or end, without constancy or form. Resounding beyond the eight directions, ringing forth before the Emperor of Images—thus the Dao may be borne and journey with it.

Its pure resonance fills the empty sky, and the sage’s work is born. The sun, moon, and stars scatter to follow their patterns; the ten thousand things follow their generation; the Five Powers respond in fullness—vast and unbounded, yet not self-satisfied. When the month of *Luobin* arrives, the River of Stars congeals, descending as white snow. On the night of Yellow Bell, grasses and trees burst into bloom, and the first stirrings of yang spring arise.

When the sage performs this music, auspicious clouds gather, sweet springs well forth; when it ceases, the balmy breeze harmonizes, and the Jade Candle shines. Gazing, one cannot see it; striking, one cannot hear it; pondering, one cannot know it; pursuing, one cannot reach it. It spreads and unfurls without trailing, flowing and scattering, shifting and moving through the boundless. The sound without pause pervades the four voids, filling Heaven and Earth; ghosts and spirits withdraw into seclusion, vast and luminous. The transmission of the boundless gives rise to all things in profusion, winding and endless.

**Section Twelve: The Workings of Mechanism**

The wondrous workings of mechanism move in response—like a divine vessel, it bows and rises, advances and retreats, gauging depth and shallowness, measuring what is fitting. Progress and withdrawal, lightness and weight—nothing misses its proper place. Its activation brings abundance, benefiting things with moisture, matching the timely rain, awakening principle, aligning with spirit and illumination—yet the people do not know it. Why is this so? Those who excel in penetrating the Dao are thus.

**Section Thirteen: Unwrapping the Bundle**

Unwrap the bundle, release the superfluous—vast and empty, it returns to its natural void. Dissolve right and wrong, cast off profit and harm, discard cunning and wit, temper bold resolve. Thus, in night’s sleep, no startling dread; in day’s waking, no resentful cleverness. Loss and sorrow do not churn within; pain, sickness, grief, and joy do not stray from the heart. Riches, rank, and reward bring no delight; punishments, threats, and prohibitions inspire no fear. Discard the branches, probe the root—such was the ancient perfected one, attuned to its harmony.

Let limbs fall away, dull brilliance and keen hearing, feign the illness of health, know the unknowing. Flowing in undivided unity, embodying Heaven’s balance, roaming beyond the body’s fame and disgrace, at the origin of the ten thousand things—what is there to rejoice in? What is there not to rejoice in?

---

**Section Fourteen: The Pearl’s Recompense**

Thread the pearl through the abyss of goodness, purify the heart and discipline the form. Nurture spirit in profound silence, issuing forth true wisdom—possessing great beauty yet never speaking of it. Like the sun and moon’s self-luminance, penetrating and boundless, nothing is left behind.

The supreme Dao requires no cultivation; its virtue matches Heaven and Earth. Self-lofty, self-profound, yet the ten thousand things cannot depart from it, each fulfilling its principle. Sincere and expansive, serene and unobstructed, the six directions are mirrored clearly—no hidden depth remains unilluminated. Beginning in radiant numinosity, it attains and nearly abides.

---

**Section Fifteen: Wondrous Convergence**

Wondrous convergence—vast and obscure, emptiness congeals with spirit. Accumulate it, yet it is never enough; possess nothing, yet it overflows. Not grasped by ear or eye, not sought by heart or intellect. The further one traces it, the deeper it becomes; the closer one draws, the more distant it seems. Touch it, yet no shiver arises. Gaze ahead—it is not there; suddenly, it is not behind. Harmonious yet not leading, responding to things without form.

The ten thousand things cannot obstruct it; likes and dislikes, safety and peril find no lack. Neither advancing nor welcoming, neither speaking nor silent. The deluded stumble over a single thread; the sagely wise see all goodness as one source. Employed, it fills Heaven and Earth—no beginning or end is discerned. Set aside, one cannot tell where it enters—no trace or sign is glimpsed.

Still and silent, the hundred clans use it daily yet never know. Alas! Clods of earth and heaps of dust rush about—how many in the world awaken to it? Ceaselessly turning, fortune and misfortune shift in secret. In the intervals of coming and going, affairs shatter illusions—those drunk in the house of trivial strife, how can they return?

---

**Section Sixteen: Abandoning Strength**

Abandon strength, have no preferences—unaware even of why it is so. Encounter things without partiality—this is called great completion. Thus, sight is not dazzled by crimson and purple, brocade and embroidery; hearing is not ensnared by clanging bells or resonant pipes; scent is not stifled by pepper, orchid, orange, or pomelo; taste is not sated by fine meats, sweet wine, or rich fare; the body is not pampered by soft furs or thick curtains; thought is not disturbed by discriminating cares or anxious plans.

Externally, not enslaved by fame, wealth, or rank; internally, not confused by defensive learning or clever schemes. Sweeping away all filth, entering the realm beyond comparison—thus it is. Thereafter, one embraces luminous wisdom, receives keen insight. Savoring the flavor of the flavorless, words issue forth like metal and stone in loyal integrity, girded in plainness and simplicity.

Cast off beyond the eight directions and six qi, wings spread in the whirlwind, spiraling through the numinous cavern—wondrously penetrating the void. Such knowledge has reached its limit—profound, lofty, nothing can surpass it.

---

**Section Seventeen: Heaven’s Concealment**

Heaven’s concealment probes the hidden, high and empty, deep and remote—thus the world cannot discern it. Its Dao is subtle and commonplace; its virtue blankets all life. It does not cling to edges, veils its affairs, rising and falling without falsehood.

Dim and obscure, now worn, now broken—like an empty valley, it opposes things. No blame, no praise—none know it: this is called great wholeness.

---

**Section Eighteen: Grief and Joy**

Grief and joy do not enter—this is the perfection of virtue. Taking nothing, giving nothing—this is the stability of nature. Banish thoughts and cares, forget form and intellect. Nurture simplicity, attain emptiness—its virtue is not solitary. Discerning the true from the false without being swayed by things, guarding its origin—thus it nearly abides.

---

**Section Nineteen: Dwelling in the Real**

Dwell in the real abode, breathe deeply in the boundless expanse—transcendent, without corners. Lofty, it has no covering; vast, it has no direction. The door and window are formless forms; the beams are useless timbers. Desiring the desireless in purity, grasping the ungraspable as the great net.

Play with the book of immortality, pivot the tune of non-being. At times, roam the radiant wilderness; at others, dwell in the carefree and unrefined. Sip the fine wine of the spirit flask, play the ancient harmonies. Unrestrained and free, in perfect accord with the Dao—could there be anything more?

Yet the common folk, crude and reckless, grind against one another, collide and compete, topple and do not return, rush like fire without looking back. The six senses plunder one another—no heavenly wandering for the heart. Alas!

Thus, when a chamber is never empty, mother and daughter-in-law clash—righteousness reaches its limit.

**Chapter Twenty: Sudden Extinction**
Suddenly extinguish worldly attitudes, open the heavens and depart from men. An empty chamber generates brightness; auspiciousness abides in stillness. The great worthies who illuminate the Dao, the astute historians and eloquent debaters, the wise and skillful artisans—how could they glimpse this mechanism?

Now vanishing, now submerged, silent and plainly passing. Not responding to calculations of affairs, standing at the root source, and penetrating the natural. Existence and annihilation, love and hate, favor and disgrace, right and wrong—how can these be alertly delighted or controlled? The nine orifices and hundred bones, each thing blending and merging, yet unaware of one’s own possession.

Forgetting time, forgetting place, forgetting past, forgetting present—profoundly empty, profoundly void—thus deeply entering the Great Mystery.

**Chapter Twenty-One: The World**
The world has no rival; the Dao flows unimpeded, knowing its root. It unites the lineage of heaven and earth, exhausts the nature of the myriad things, and emits the light of heaven. Loftily treading the great square of the divine vessel, it transforms alone in the dark and obscure realm. It stirs the long waves of the ocean of virtue, purifies and penetrates the nine abysses. It fans the true wind beyond form, harmonizing the eight directions. Speech and knowledge reach far and vast; a glance or gesture reveals the subtle. Wisdom and virtue are bright and keen, illuminating mechanisms like a mirror.

Thus, the true sage knows people and knows heaven, sharing the same work as creation. Whether moving or still, marvelous functions are inexhaustible. Only then does one comprehend the transformations of life and death, roam freely in the great void, act appropriately with things, and bestow benefits upon the myriad ages without decline.

**Chapter Twenty-Two: Spiritual Encounter**
Spiritually encountering and wandering, the origin has no passage. Not swift yet fast, not traveling yet arriving, not acting yet accomplishing—marvelously above the myriad things, simply being natural. From near to far, from self to others, without form or boundary, beyond the divisions of numbers, beyond the recitations of fine and coarse. Not to be discussed in words, not to be examined by intent.

Riding the void without falling, touching the solid without obstruction. Drinking wind and sipping dew, vast and boundless without direction. Without fear or dread, without love or pride. Crossing mountains and valleys without alarm, piercing metal and stone as if nothing. Seeing without obstruction, clouds and mist do not veil its clarity. Hearing without confusion, thunder does not startle its acuity.

Without partiality or faction, without violating nature. The swirling dust of the world cannot disturb its smoothness. There is no generation or transformation—probing again and again. Opposing it yet not angered, following it yet not obeyed. Though pierced by bravery, no wound is seen; though struck by force, no pain is felt.

Beyond form and number, thus able to overcome things without burden. Coming and going, a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations—without end. In harmony with heaven and humanity, without sounds of sorrow. Yin and yang follow their measure, averting disasters of entanglement and distress. Sun and moon unite in brightness, without eclipses or alterations. Controlling and guiding the six qi to benefit all living beings. Nurturing in constant times, affairs free from demons and specters. Shamans dare not invoke spirits; the earth has no miasmic sand, no venomous stings.

Thus, though the sage resides in the ancestral temple, he takes the hearts of the common people as his own. For the world, he blends his heart, follows their nature, and harmonizes with their transformations. Harmoniously responding to the feelings of things—who would toil and sigh over such attachments? He laments that those who know the Dao are not easily met.

Now, as if seen with one’s own eyes and preserved—words exchanged in passing, content and self-possessed, not seeking the profoundly distant, long attuned to the true wind, awakened from the great dream. How could it not be so?

**Chapter Twenty-Three: Solitary Eminence**

**Chapter Twenty-Three: Solitary Eminence (continued)**

Solitary and majestic, the Dao stands alone.
It moves unseen above the myriad things, its will unwavering.
Not drowned by breadth, nor obscured by ornament—
nothing compels it, yet it remains ever natural.

It wanders beyond the dust and grime, unbound by ties.
No end is known, no beginning traced.
Uncarved, unpolished, it returns to simplicity.
Neither coiled nor stretched, it pervades the four corners in darkness.
Pity those without awareness—how vast is its perfection!

**Chapter Twenty-Four: Abandoning Nature**
Abandon contrivance, and the numinous terrace holds no virtue.
Respond to the ten thousand changes without resistance—
this is called harmony, not aiding heaven with human art.
Such a one knows no limit,
thus merging with the Great Constancy.

**Chapter Twenty-Five: Simplicity**
Serene and at ease, no perverse qi can assail.
Mind tranquil, spirit concentrated—
life preserved, essence guarded.
The soul does not weary, no sorrow or regret,
no fear or trembling. Vast and steadfast,
it delights in itself.
Adapting to things without constraint,
no moment is amiss—where could it not pass?
Virtue fills within, its simplicity complete,
a treasure for the world.
Add to it and it does not increase;
diminish it and it does not lessen.
Deep as the sea, its measure boundless.

**Chapter Twenty-Six: Steadfast Integrity**
Steadfast and responsive, virtue reaches spirit-clarity.
The ancients who excelled as scholars,
hearing this, practiced it diligently—how admirable!
Yet customs cling to habit; let us examine them.
A trickle from a cliff hollows hard stone;
a single thread of silk can sever a sturdy post.
Water is not a drill for stone, nor rope a saw for wood—
why then? Their work is unbroken, and so it comes to pass.

Seeking pearls in the sea, one fears no waves.
Hunting in the mountains, one dreads no beasts—
such is the forgetting of the heart.
Alas! Upright gentlemen,
lifelong they avoid not the snares of fishing and hunting,
bound to shallow, stubborn vessels,
entangled in desires, chasing fleeting pleasures—
vainly they invite ruin.

As for the spirit-person,
taking heaven and earth as a single realm,
countless ages as a single breath,
unaware of before or after, indifferent to past or present,
great and small merged, distinctions dissolved—
how much more for those who seek the Dao in earnest,
holding fast to unwavering sincerity,
strengthening their resolve?
Then the barriers of form may be forgotten,
and the Dao of perfect equilibrium flows unimpeded.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: Profound Stillness**
Profound stillness, deep and silent,
entering the boundless void.
Within, no concealment; without, no exposure.
Taking emptiness as its gate, nothingness as its home,
no lineage, no ancestors, no heirs—
silent, independent, unattached,
unknown and unknowable.
Thus its essence transcends all categories,
its greatness defies enclosure.

**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Forgetting Both**
Forgetting both self and other,
supreme harmony unchanging,
discarding old attachments,
still and unified, unwavering.
No words, no intent—only the breath of nature.
Responsive yet untethered,
deep in repose, nothing is forgotten.
Viewing life and death as one,
nothing can disturb—
how much less the distinctions of hard and white, same and different?
Thus nothing is discarded, nothing retained,
suddenly enlightened, utterly empty—
this is called the pivot of the Dao.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine: Removing Obstructions**
Remove obstructions, forget duality—
pure and unadorned, at ease and unhurried.
The seven apertures flow freely, the square inch is empty.
Like a tree’s hollow core, like settled dust or fleeting foam,
though rewards and punishments hold no sway,
kinship and estrangement elicit no response.
The world’s praise or blame—
unheeded, unaccepted,
as if entering the deepest valley,
wandering where the ten thousand things do not stray,
yet all abide.

**Chapter Thirty: No Attainment**
No attainment is attainable—
this is called the mysterious pattern.
True joy, pure radiance, vast and empty.
Within, unaware of the Great Beginning;
without, ignorant of form and shadow.
No action, no home, neither plain nor stained,
neither existent nor nonexistent.
Facing brightness, unmoved;
confronting darkness, unobstructed.
Embracing all changes, yet nothing is done.
Listening, no sound; observing, no form—
profound and formless.
Used without exhaustion,
no beginning, no end.
Self-rooted, self-originating,
deep beyond knowing,
yet ancient and enduring.

**Chapter Thirty-One: Mirroring the Dao**
Mirroring the Dao’s subtlety,
transcending all bounds.
It carves and polishes the myriad beings,
yet no craftsmanship is seen.
It reveals the three realms,
yet its mechanism remains unfathomable.
It bears the two forces—
neither clear nor turbid.
It cycles through the four seasons—
neither flowering nor fruiting.
Nesting birds and beasts
never take flight or flee.
Flowing into rivers and stars,
its depths are hard to plumb.
First emerging from primordial chaos,
vast and without origin.
Spanning past and present,
no trace is discerned.

Great, it encompasses all—
smooth and unobstructed, without corner or edge.
Small, it seals the tip of an autumn hair,
no speck of dust arises.
A thousand sages cannot fathom it;
ten thousand dharmas cannot contain it.
Beyond sound, beyond form,
unasked, untransmitted.
Thus it is said:
Silent, serene, vast, and deep,
empty, wondrous, spiritually connected—
without hindrance, without obstacle.

**Chapter Thirty-Two: Merging as One**
Merging without peril,
darkly harmonizing with the boundless.
Observing the ten thousand things,
no high or low, no noble or base.
Seeing Mount Tai and an autumn hair—
no difference in scale.
Understanding that all share one gate,
knowing that stench and fragrance, the mundane and marvelous, transform.
Thus it is said: The world is but a single qi.

Such a one regards wealth and rank as clods of earth,
a thatched hut as superior to carved beams,
wildflowers as finer than triple sacrifices,
hempen robes as more precious than fox and sable.
Dwelling in humble lodgings, delighting in simplicity.
Thus forgetting self and other,
who is right, who is wrong?
Knowing that life and transformation are like dream and waking,
great and small share one realm—
naturally, the subtle essence abides.

The common folk are deluded indeed, exhausting themselves in vain—merely following the fleeting moment.

**Waxing and Waning (Chapter Thirty-Three)**
Waxing and waning alternate, yin and yang push one another, forms shift and change. Yet those who penetrate to the Supreme Mystery know there is no absolute wholeness. Observe the realm of ears and eyes: wisdom, bearing, expression, and countenance—all are flawed. What is seen here is unseen there; what is known as existent is unknown in its origin. This single form is but a vessel borne by the great earth, a congregation of impurities, the five phases borrowing from one another, a fleeting harmony. The four seasons give rise and destroy in turn, coming and going without cease. From infancy to youth, from old age to feebleness—is there ever a moment of pause, a lack of transformation?

Alas! The teeming masses rise and vanish in an instant, succeeding and failing in turn. Clinging to this, grasping at that, they rejoice day and night, taking it for reality. Bending and stretching, bowing and rising, inhaling and exhaling—deeming this the wondrous Dao, they see a pellet and crave roasted quail. How deeply deluded they are! Soon their skin decays, their hair withers, and they accomplish nothing—how can they not grieve?

Thus the perfected person outwardly harmonizes with all virtues, inwardly pares the mind to oneness. Viewing the hundred limbs and four limbs as dust and grime, they transcend the realm of common pursuits, roaming freely by heaven’s boundary without private bias. Self and other are wholly preserved.

**Obscurity (Chapter Thirty-Four)**
Obscurity and tangled thoughts, petty thieves within—these are the losses of spirit. Moreover, people of this world, though their years may be in their prime, their conduct is solitary. They squander their affairs, pressing hard against the times, failing when success is near. Sorrows and troubles follow one after another, yet they remain unaware.

This is the path of the bound and broken. The ancients who excelled as scholars did not act thus: they forgot cares and followed things, acted naturally without constraint, cleansed their filth, and appeared dull as if daubed with mud. They perfected their virtue, embraced their leisure—this is called clarity of knowing and fullness of principle.

**Life and Death (Chapter Thirty-Five)**
Life and death are the ultimate principles, the greatest affairs of the people—none surpass them. Yet those who covet life and lose virtue, those who invert values and debase customs, roam and play in all directions, ensnared by passions and desires. Year after year they chatter endlessly, forgetting their root.

The person who embodies the Dao does not act thus. They comprehend the source of all things, fathom the transformations of yin and yang, and realize the profound unity of mind and wisdom. They seal the seven apertures, unifying all states into one. Though their allotted span may end, there is a principle that does not perish. Forgetting self and other, without joy or aversion, they take heaven and earth as a single valley, the great void as their neighbor—how could they be burdened by the form of the body?

**Following the Course (Chapter Thirty-Six)**
Following the course and understanding fate, knowing contentment and avoiding disgrace—this is the way to preserve life and protect form. Take form as the body, virtue as the foundation. Do not chase after the vulgar, do not cling to profit, do not scheme in affairs, do not seek favor from others. Knowing the times but not knowing when to stop—this obstructs the Dao.

Distant yet not troubled, yielding yet not covetous, knowing the past is like the present—life is labor. Responding to change and transformation, beginning and end are not my concern. On level ground, one’s integrity stands firm without effort; things cannot bend it. Even in utter poverty, there is no sorrow. Rejoicing in heaven and knowing fate, one remains free of vulgarity.

Swift as a fleeing hare, inwardly one stretches and relaxes. Dwelling like a corpse, lodging like a guest, one endures without peril throughout life—this is how to last long.

**Guishan Changquanzi’s Writings**
*Book One, Part Two*

**Chapter Thirty-Seven: Supreme Virtue**
Supreme virtue vast and boundless, distant and without end.
Gentle and benevolent, it matches heaven and earth.
It bears and nurtures all, shifting with the four seasons,
soothing the far and near, its blessings reaching reeds and rushes.
Unstored, unburdened, it moves by heaven’s course.
Thus it governs all beings, emerging and entering beyond bounds,
subtle as the divine.
Therefore the sage harmonizes with it and responds,
arising naturally and spontaneously.
Taking the people’s hearts as his own,
he acts only when compelled.
Gradually he nourishes, broadly he covers,
clearly and brightly, abundantly sustaining the ten thousand things—
none do not flourish.
Without scheming, affairs succeed;
without transformation, governance is achieved.
Pure and tranquil, without contrivance,
he rules the world with idle sleeves—
how near to perfection!

**Chapter Thirty-Eight: Responsive Construction**
Responsive construction conceals nothing, becoming spring for all things.
Loving yet not relying on merit,
it meets and gives life to the times.
The heart—its origin is without flaw,
level and simple, unadorned.
Vast as rivers and seas,
it ferries the hundred streams.
Majestic as Mount Tai,
it nourishes the ten thousand things,
its mirror-like reflection like the sun’s virtue, without partiality.
Thus it is said:
Let benevolence and righteousness be your ceremonial jades,
ritual and music your sashes,
wisdom and trust your chariot’s harness.
Dwell in tranquility as your true home,
stand amid the cosmos,
governing the multitudes—
only the sage can do this.

**Chapter Thirty-Nine: Distant Things**
Discern distant things and be free from harm,
value the will and honor authenticity.
Thus the noble person cultivates integrity,
finds peace in his lot,
does not bend to petty men,
delights in contentment,
rejoices in the Dao of heaven without sorrow.
This is called preserving his integrity,
fully sated with virtue,
not allowing excess or indulgence to obscure harmony.
One who knows this
is called a celestial treasury,
complete and flourishing in beauty—
yet unaware of its source.

**Chapter Forty: Vulgar Greed**
Cowardly and base, insatiably grasping,
desiring gain but never satisfied—
such are those bound by petty skills,
wearying body and exhausting mind.
Disaster and misfortune are self-made,
yet they blame others,
indulging their passions until the body is ruined.
Pursuing and entangling,
losing and failing.
Chasing things and defying heaven’s transformations,
they wander dazed within,
and ghosts and spirits come to dwell in their abode.

**Chapter Forty-One: Entangled Thoughts**
Entangled thoughts and restless ease—
the root of great delusion.
Joy and anger assail one another,
day and night in ceaseless striving.
The myriad emotions fester in the spirit’s chamber,
fortune’s favors multiply,
desires sink deep,
the world’s paths are trodden without a backward glance.
How could one know that all things are impermanent,
affairs never fixed?
The mayfly and morning mushroom perish in an instant;
even the sun and moon suffer eclipses—
how much more so for man?
Thus the perfected person embraces the cosmos,
entering without obstruction,
the plain heart uniting with qi,
qi uniting with spirit,
spirit uniting with emptiness,
emptiness uniting with the boundless.
Graceful upon the mountain of the Gourd,
carefree in the natural realm—
its depths are unfathomable, endless.
Serene as if absent yet present,
effortless yet spiritually manifest.
Uncontending, it nurtures the multitude,
forgetting merit while subtly benefiting all.
This is called true power,
the root of the supreme Dao—
how could one not observe heaven thereby?

**Chapter Forty-Two: Dreams and Awakening**
Dreams and waking are equal states,
where form meets and spirit communes.
Who knows the cause of such transformations?
Alas! The restless crowd dwells together,
entangled in the snare of profit,
racing after dissipation,
knowing no rest.
By day, a thousand cares disturb their will;
by night, thoughts confuse their nature.
They clash with things, grinding away,
scheming in all directions,
never considering return—
are they not the fools of heaven and earth?
How could they know that those who attain the Dao
seal their mechanisms?
Hidden, dense, tranquil, profound-rooted—
they see past and present as one,
view life and death as a single thread,
refusing to drown in waking or dreams,
guarding the true source.
Thus, soaring among the thistles and reeds,
where could they go?

**Chapter Forty-Three: The Pivot**
The pivot’s burden is heavy,
filled with deceit and cunning as its task,
suppressing the heart’s lord,
thieves and bandits block heaven’s harmony.
Above and below deceive one another,
losing the true path.
The people grow weary,
chaos replaces constancy,
they lack proper nourishment.
Grasses and trees, birds and beasts cry out in disorder,
withering in the mountains and marshes;
ghosts and spirits reject their sacrifices.
Why is this?
Because they abandon the good Dao,
seeking fame, law, power, and might,
displaying severity, wisdom, and courage.

Thus the sage models what cannot be rigidly fixed,
for rigidity breeds primal fault.
They serve heaven with substance,
not with its blossoms.
Seeing the outward, they know the inward;
observing the past, they know the future;
hearing the echo, they know the sound;
glimpsing the shadow, they know the form.
Therefore it is said:
Bent or straight, they follow the measure;
heavy or light, they respond without force.
The Dao acts in its season,
universally aiding the flourishing of all under heaven,
sharing prosperity with the ten thousand things.
At the great limit, they remain silent,
preserving utmost tranquility and guarding true simplicity,
returning to uncarved simplicity.

**Chapter Forty-Four: Authenticity and Deception**
Authenticity and deception arise from different sources,
yet both occupy their proper place in affairs.
It is said: serving heaven is difficult to falsify,
while serving man is easy to falsify.
Lose the gate of true unity,
and perverse excess assails the numinous palace,
throwing things into chaos.
The true sovereign, proud of skill and indulging emotion,
loses the Dao.
An ancient saying declares:
The great man’s words are a shield and law;
in governance, he maintains constancy.
Abiding in substance as if empty,
harboring knowledge as if foolish—
both are attained as if they were nothing.
Reforming toward goodness as if never sufficient.
Outwardly wounding the inner,
pursuing affairs that ruin the body,
seeing profit and forgetting the Dao—
these are called the three inauspicious signs.
Holding to these inauspicious signs,
how can one avoid blame?
Such principle has never been heard.

**Chapter Forty-Five: Power and Fate**
Power, fate, and schemes—
how can fleeting glory and beauty be firmly entrenched?
Like wax melting and scattering here,
who knows the workings of creation’s alternations?
Boastful deceit and willful emotion
align with the vulgar customs of the age.
Yet heaven’s Dao speaks not but responds with goodness,
dispensing retribution like shadow and echo.
Who knows its reasons?
Who can stand in awe of what is yet to come?
Thus the perfected person knows:
premature death or long life is fate;
poverty or ease, leisure or toil are timing.
What comes by chance cannot be relied upon;
what has passed cannot be pursued.
Prosperity and adversity, gain and loss,
difficulty and ease, success and failure—
why should I trouble my heart with such questions?
Only the pine and cypress,
receiving their mandate from earth,
remain verdant through winter and summer.

**Chapter Forty-Six: Timely Occurrence**

**Chapter Forty-Six: Timely Occurrence (continued)**

Names and realities in their time-bound coincidence—
those who embrace the Dao guard against making them their master.
Now flourishing, now withering,
moving with the moment, halting with the pause.
Exalted ease and humble toil,
honor and disgrace, joy and sorrow—
all converge in a single form.
Meeting fortune or misfortune, good or ill,
they neither startle nor rejoice.
Toppling or stumbling,
why fret or grieve?
Thus the sage observes the boundless transformations,
knows the destined cycles of fullness and emptiness,
faces death without fear,
attains the heights without peril,
transcends all to find contentment,
unmoved by whatever may befall.
Thus, with clarity in all four directions,
the six realms harmonize with time’s changes.
Encountering without grasping,
passing without regret,
measuring by harmony,
resembling yet unburdened—
nothing is not magnified.

**Chapter Forty-Seven: Purity and Stillness**
Purity and stillness are the root;
through them, the world rights itself.
Thus the realm unites in one heart,
above and below transformed by influence.
Qi steeps and suffuses,
woodcutters’ songs of praise
overflow the roads,
distant lands bring tribute,
the people, carrying their children and baskets,
come bearing burdens.
Yet those who covet fleeting warmth like swine or lice,
who mimic the cries of hens or pheasants,
whose measure is but a sparrow’s,
whose talent is but a merchant’s—
grasping at profit without understanding,
they delight in their own conceit.
They deem themselves sufficient,
unaware they have never known
the solitary transformation before form and lord,
the homeland of primal chaos.

**Chapter Forty-Eight: Preservation and Loss**
Preservation and loss stir no alarm—
thus one attains the measure of nurturing life.
How is this known?
By holding fast to sincerity,
discerning the passing of ages,
weighing emptiness and fullness,
recognizing advance and retreat.
What comes is not refused,
what goes is not resisted.
Thus the good person,
leaving the world behind,
preserves the spirit whole.
External things do not burden heaven’s mandate,
their course unobstructed—
how could they traverse peril?
**Chapter Forty-Nine: Floating and Sinking**
Floating and sinking in the great order—
only the subtle and refined
must not go unexamined.
Observe heaven and earth’s guiding principles,
illumine the beginning and end of all transformations.
How much more the feelings of the people,
their departures and arrivals, choices and rejections—
they do not uphold constancy.
Thus they know honor but not disgrace,
pursue things but not the Dao,
take pride in externals while stifling within.
Why do they not take heed for what follows?
Thus the true person
does not flaunt rank or wealth,
does not shun lowliness or hardship,
is not swayed by beauty,
cannot be deceived by cunning.
Unchanging in nature,
unharmed in fate,
their will is single and untiring.
Serene and without contrivance,
how could disaster reach them?

**Chapter Fifty: Drunken Indulgence**
Drunken excess and heedless indulgence—
regret and blame, moral flaws,
perils lurking in the bedchamber—
these cannot be ignored.
To give rein to dissipation,
to move toward death’s ground—
how profound the folly!
Alas, in this age of universal clamor,
not one in ten thousand is free of it.
Dazzled by illusion,
how could they know?
Only the perfected remain unentangled,
preserving heaven’s harmony through few desires and clarity,
nurturing inner virtue to achieve purity.

**Chapter Fifty-One: Gluttony**
Gluttony and covetousness,
wild abandon and greed—
these are the scourge of the people.
Scheming for rare treasures
to gratify private desires,
within they harbor restless hearts,
without they fear exposure and blame.
Their legs race, their spirits chafe,
they do not abide by fate’s allotment,
spending their lives in toil,
pushing and pulling for profit.
In darkness they dread the reproach of ghosts,
in daylight they dread the censure of men.
Not a moment’s peace or rest,
until they meet punishment,
falling short of their natural span,
dying midway—
such are the customs of those who defy heaven and betray their nature,
forgetting what they have received.
They dig moats and raise walls,
planting brambles and thistles—
is this not labor in vain?
Moreover, the people’s hunger
comes from their rulers consuming too much in taxes.
Thus the sage bestows widely without hoarding favor,
governing the four seas without relying on reserves.
For heaven’s Dao benefits without harming,
earth’s Dao gives life without refusing,
and does not presume to rule.
The Dao of emperors and kings
extends aid without amassing,
nurturing and sustaining all,
without desire or contrivance—
thus the myriad things mature and find sufficiency.

**Chapter Fifty-Two: Fear and Caution**
Fear and caution against peril—
this is the way to preserve the body,
keep the true intact,
and fulfill one’s years.
Keep far from the brink of profit and harm,
stand in the garden of generosity.
Going forth without boasting,
dwelling without neglect,
speaking of matters with principle,
without deception or concealment.
Thus, receiving favor without arrogance,
facing want without excess,
neither excessive nor arrogant—
such virtue shines brightly.
But the mediocre, blind and deaf,
dwell where they should not,
fail to see what lies before them,
and though they grasp the fruit,
they cast it aside and flee.
Their fear of others
enables them to avoid calamity,
to distance themselves from harm.
Moreover, the splendid fox and patterned leopard
do not nest in mountain forests or cave dens,
but roam the plains, rivers, and marshes—
thus they meet the snare’s disaster.
Is this not extreme?
Thus it is said:
The great person knows brilliance
but guards obscurity,
dwells nameless as a quail,
eats as a fledgling,
elevates their aspiration,
soaring above floating clouds.
Thus the Son of Heaven cannot make them subjects,
the feudal lords cannot make them friends.
Wandering in the ancestor of the myriad things,
resting in the homeland of Dao and virtue—
what burden could they bear?

**Chapter Fifty-Three: Right and Wrong**
The principles of right and wrong
rest on depth as their foundation,
discernment as wisdom,
simplicity as their guiding thread.
When many and few contend,
nothing can be fully settled—
grasp but the essentials,
for this is the vastness of embodying the Dao.
Among the world’s common folk,
how few forget form to preserve spirit!
The people have been lost for so long—
what does this mean?
Heaven and earth, water and fire,
yin and yang, cold and heat—
none deviate from their patterns,
yet who can set them right?
Why then this tumult and confusion,
bewildered by evil desires?
Nobility and baseness, skill and clumsiness,
life and death, fragrance and stench,
sorrow and joy—
all intermingle.
They mistake ignorance for knowledge,
take delusion for reality.

**Chapter Fifty-Three (continued): Being and Nonbeing**

Being and nonbeing, sound and color—
all sink and stagnate in cyclical return.
Self and other divide,
giving rise to contention and dispute.
Even to grasp the formless and seize the Dark Pearl
is not yet the ultimate.
Yet in gaining this, one loses that.
How much worse for those lost along the way,
entangled in profit and harm,
bound by noble and base, close and distant?
Ten thousand cares assail and agitate—
such is the case everywhere,
with few exceptions.
From this perspective,
who is truly deluded?
Who is not?

---

**Chapter Fifty-Four: Narrow Paths and Broad Ways**

Narrow paths and cramped dwellings
obscure vision with partial views.
The clarity of a peephole’s light,
the boldness of debate, the sharpness of wit—
these are not the supreme Dao of all under heaven.
Gazing at the sky through reeds,
frogs in a well treading the sea,
worrying over a lost sheep,
wandering thoughts through tangled phrases—
brilliant hues dazzle the five colors,
making the great image hard to perceive.
Deafened by the five tones,
how can one fathom the music of no strings?
Those who savor fine meats and citrus as sweetness
know nothing of the primal flavor.
Like fireflies outshining the sun in a cave,
or a crow perched on a withered branch at noon—
how could they know the vastness of the Dark Spirit,
the towering pillar that takes heaven as father,
earth as mother,
and virtue as its resting place?
Those who attain this stand firm,
yet the benighted remain unaware.
A plodding nag or a sparrow
cannot comprehend the aspirations of the phoenix’s fledglings,
the Green Ears, the Swift Black, or the White Yak—
galloping a thousand miles,
soaring through the nine heavens.
The foolish in their furrows cannot keep pace,
and those of limited learning—
how could they know heaven?
Turning their backs on the distant,
rushing toward the near,
drunk on fame and reputation,
cutting short their lives,
they graze within the fence of profit and rank,
gallop through fields of indulgence and excess,
losing the Dao and its virtue—
how tragic indeed!

---

**Chapter Fifty-Five: Bonds and Shackles**

Bound by sound and color,
shackled by rank and eminence—
these are the topsy-turvy scholars.
Like dust in the eyes or insects in the ear,
carving fine script and engraving patterns to obscure truth—
is this not difficult?
Stealing gold at midday or in the early dawn—
is this not punishable?
Yet the rash, greedy, and cruel
throng the halls of power,
dancing to the tune of human titles,
mocking the vast web of the Dao,
never examining themselves.
Like a toad blocking a chariot’s path,
or an ant trying to shoulder a mountain,
clutching at ears and covering eyes—
is this not pitiful?
Thus, arrogance and contempt fester within,
while sable robes, official sashes,
leather caps, and silk cords adorn the outside.
They believe themselves accomplished,
yet their lives are bitter toil,
heedless of what comes after.
The tiger and rhinoceros are caged,
yet they remain unsaved their whole lives—
what a mess!
Who among them will awaken?

---

**Chapter Fifty-Six: Emptiness and Delusion**

Emptiness and delusion, chaos and slander—
when things enter the heart,
they become thieves to the true sovereign.
Dreaming of deer as one’s own,
debating with shifting arguments,
attacking one another over right and wrong,
clinging to the myriad things as real—
even love and affection twist and coil,
harmonious calls and paired wings,
piled butter as solid truth,
branching separations and reunions,
all woven into the snares of the world.
Thus sorrow and joy clash,
tumults arise,
the winds of desire and the colors of passion surge.
The sea of craving churns waves,
the snow of emotion drifts and scatters.
Clouds of confusion veil the sun,
the chase through fields and hunts never ceases—
the people of the world remain lost in their folly.
How could they ever know?
Therefore, those who embody the Dao do not dwell here.

---

**Chapter Fifty-Seven: Stimulus and Response**

Stimulus and response intertwine,
strange and wondrous in endless forms.
Those who do not seek their source
fall into confusion.
Consider the great furnace of heaven and earth,
the subtle shifts of the four seasons and celestial cycles—
who perceives them? Who understands?
When myriad evils startle one another,
forms and things shrink in fear,
entangled in immediate affairs,
rushing day and night,
sinking into the overgrowth—
some die from sorrow or joy,
others perish from blows and strikes.
Indulging in wine and music,
desire and thought entangled,
they invite misfortune, early death,
or calamity through transgression,
rebellion, and error.
Famine, cold, and exposure
cast them into ditches,
robbing them of their natural lifespan.
Crime leads to ruin—
how could this not be perilous?
The Dao has no beginning or end,
yet forms are born and die.
If life is right, why not death?
If death is wrong, why life?
Those who align with right
transform stench and decay into the wondrous.
Those who chase wrong
turn the wondrous into stench and decay.
A chaste woman becomes solid stone,
deep resentment transforms into the jujube thorn—
such emotional shifts cannot all be recorded.
It is said that a spirit with a heart to aid things
receives honor and reverence in form.
A spirit with a heart to harm things
receives lowly and despised forms in return.
Cause and effect follow without fail.
Thus it is said:
The pure and upright ascend in glory,
the greedy and cruel descend in disgrace.
Only the heavenly Dao shows no partiality,
ever favoring the good.
The deluded stumble blindly,
the awakened move with ease.
Whales and sturgeon forget one another in rivers and lakes,
jackals and tigers dominate the mountains and forests—
all is shaped by the push and pull of shadows and echoes.
Thus, those who attain the Dao
share the same source as a thousand sages.
Those who lose their nature
dwell in the same realm as the ten thousand dusts—
is this not perplexing?

---

**Chapter Fifty-Eight: Fame and Goodness**

Fame and goodness are instruments of misfortune,
not the path to full realization.
Cunning and deceit, slippery and tangled—
how can one know what is true?
Those who follow the Dao
often falter at the brink of success,
their fame eroding virtue,
goodness emerging from the ominous.
Even sages cannot overcome these two—
how much less the ordinary?
Thus, they are stained by attachment,
immersed in common emotions.
The self-deceived see uprightness as flawed,
the self-indulgent see fairness as unclear.
From this, great confusion and delusion arise,
leaving no escape.
Therefore, the noble person dwells in substance,
not in mere appearance.
Would one harm the master for the sake of the guest?
Truly, one must not seek what is not,
not dwell where one does not belong.
With a heart full of compassion,
a spirit at ease,
gentle, weak, pure, and frugal,
clothed in the Dao and embracing virtue—
then one moves in harmony with heaven and earth.

**Chapter Fifty-Nine: Likes and Dislikes**

Likes and dislikes cloud the heart,
for within, something is concealed.
What aligns with oneself,
though flattering and obsequious, brings delight.
What differs from oneself,
though loyal, forgiving, and virtuous, is despised.
The body and nature are set adrift,
submerged in the myriad things,
bound by externals, never to return.
The spirit soars, yet the celestial virtue is lost.

The conduct of the great person differs from this.
Without selection, without suspicion,
things come and one responds,
fulfilling what is sincere.
Virtue is shared with others,
not wielding worthiness over them.
Being the utmost impartiality under heaven,
only then does one attain great harmony.

**Chapter Sixty: Fragrance and Stench**

Once fragrance and stench are distinguished,
deluded emotions arise in turn.
Virtue is fragmented,
and the people lose the ultimate principle.
Yet when manure nourishes the crops,
spread through the gardens and fields,
all under heaven partake equally—
the true flavor remains.

Now, some employ elaborate traps and snares,
nets and hooks with bait,
to capture flying and running creatures—
insects, quail, fish, elk, and deer—
along with geese, ducks, chickens, and dogs,
harming others to benefit themselves,
indulging their desires,
pleasing their palates.
No greater fault exists,
for do they know true scent from foul?

Why is this so?
Both birds and beasts possess male and female,
parental love and kinship,
blood and qi—
how far removed are they from human intelligence?

Alas for this shallow and frivolous age,
for those who delight in killing and devouring life,
destroying nests and crushing eggs,
ensnaring creatures in nets.
Wriggling insects and delicate creatures
scatter in terror,
hiding and fleeing
to escape harm,
all losing their lives.

Viewed through the Dao,
heaven and earth are born with me,
the myriad things are one with me.
What is "that," and what is "this"?

**Chapter Sixty-One: Emotions and Skills**

When emotions and skills vie for dominance,
purity and harmony do not arise.
The Dao and virtue grow distant,
confusion spreads across the land,
and the people become deceitful.

Thus, this world and the Dao mutually perish,
abandoning heaven,
opening the human,
extinguishing life.
Grasses and trees flourish,
yet the multitude cannot return to truth.

Therefore, I will bend outwardly while remaining inwardly straight,
serve the worn while renewing virtue,
be level yet not uniform,
harmonious yet not identical.
Taking heaven as my companion,
I strive to unify and eliminate corruption.

**Chapter Sixty-Two: Shackles and Burdens**

Releasing shackles and burdens dissolves doubt,
abandons habit, and halts delusion.
Worry and suffering cannot enter,
thus virtue remains whole.

The world is filled with those lost in stubbornness and aggression,
clinging to cunning and self-serving desires.
Yet no greater enemy exists than the mind—
when the mind stirs, a thousand anxieties arise,
invading and disrupting heaven’s nature.
Without a master within,
one invites calamity upon oneself,
bringing ruin—
nothing worthy of praise.

Wavering and wandering,
traversing the paths of falsity, shallowness, sorrow, and suffering,
distorted and distant,
treading rough and overbearing ways,
mistaking dangling growths, jade gates, knotted cords, and piled tiles
for one’s true possessions—
is there no shame?
What is there to rely upon?

Alas!
Today, the world clamors,
all following this same path.

Thus the perfected person emerges without confusion,
and upon returning, finds fulfillment in the primordial—
neither grasping nor discarding,
abandoning sight and sound,
abiding in stillness and tranquility,
vast and empty of all possession—
this is called returning to the origin.

**Filial Piety and Compassion, Chapter Sixty-Three**
Filial piety and compassion are the supreme virtues of human relations,
the great root of the Five Constants,
the grand guiding principle of all conduct.
Within the primordial qi’s undifferentiated chaos,
they nurture living beings—
distantly, bearing great responsibility toward the myriad things;
nearby, loving and revering the six relations—
never transgressing ritual,
never disrupting custom.

When Heaven wills to save a people,
it shields them with compassion:
in battle, they prevail;
in defense, they stand unshaken.
Thus it is said: the utmost benevolence knows no partiality;
the utmost filial piety is never remiss.

The Son of Heaven relies upon it,
and auspicious clouds spread their broad canopy,
dragons bear the imperial charts.
The common people follow it,
and virtue-stars shine upon their gates,
forests and marshes flourish in the wilds.
Therefore the sage governs the world by this essential Way,
transforming even grasses and trees,
his virtue matching Heaven and Earth.
Thus yin and yang harmonize in mutual support,
crops and grains ripen in season,
the court is graced with fragrant rushes and fine mats,
and below, the people enjoy the blessings of peace.
When this is so,
all under Heaven submit in allegiance,
auspicious omens gather from the four seas,
carriages and scripts unite as one,
and the multitudes rejoice in reverence—
what cause for concern could remain?

**Gentleness and Frugality, Chapter Sixty-Four**
Gentleness and frugality are the foundation of virtue,
the function of the Way—
yet none in the world can practice them.
Why is this?
Because they eschew extravagance.

Rejecting violence and aggression,
one responds all day yet contends with none,
acting not upon things—
thus joyfully upheld without weariness.

Purity within oneself,
restraint and moderation in conduct,
steadfast through the ages,
unchanged by external things,
neither seeking gain nor fearing loss,
one’s wisdom remains unwearied—
thus preserving the body and avoiding harm.
Therefore the sage is full yet does not hoard,
renowned yet does not stand forth,
encompassing Heaven and Earth,
bestowing blessings upon all directions,
yet none know whose virtue this is.

**Integrity and Shame, Chapter Sixty-Five**
Integrity and shame are the pillars of the state,
the guiding principles of affairs,
the foundation of benevolent conduct.
The noble person is vigilant and cautious,
thus neither careless nor flattering,
recognizing shame and detesting evil,
upholding loyalty and trust,
maintaining firmness without daring to offend superiors,
pure and sincere, returning to the joy of nature.
Diligently embracing these virtues,
daily advancing in goodness,
neither diluted nor scattered,
one remains secure throughout life.
How do I know this security?
By this alone.

**Accumulation, Chapter Sixty-Six**
Accumulation without calamity,
the ebb and flow of fullness and emptiness—
foresight is called the Way of holding to what comes after.
Vast indeed is its boundlessness!
Who can reflect upon and revere it,
discerning crooked and straight, true and false,
fortune and misfortune, long life and early death,
all residing in the divine clarity—
not to be taken lightly, nor left unknown?
Thus the wise rectify their conduct by their shadow,
grasp the standard to illuminate the Way,
knowing the future by observing the past,
recognizing the subtle from the manifest.
Heaven and Earth respond in hidden accord,
as swiftly as echo follows sound,
never erring.
Like a weighing beam,
bending and rising at another’s will—
when virtue is vast, one’s conduct spreads;
when substance is good, one’s name is true.
Can the noble person not be cautious?
Clarity dawns before solitary vision,
brilliance shines upon the faint and distant.
Luminous life emerges from obscurity,
form arises from the formless.
Treading on frost, solid ice follows—
not from a single night’s cold;
a nine-*ren* mountain is built—
not from one basket of earth.
All arises gradually.
Fortune and misfortune intertwine—
who grasps their ultimate limit?
As the ancient saying goes:
"Seeing goodness, one fears falling short;
seeing evil, one recoils as from boiling water."
Thus the Heavenly net is vast,
loose yet never failing—
righteousness has its limit.

**Interaction, Chapter Sixty-Seven**
In interactions through the ages,
engaging with others,
one does not allow things to harm the mind.
Weighing alignment and opposition, rise and fall,
discerning safety and danger—
subtle indeed is the balance of the Way,
yet few attain its mystery.
The potter shapes all living things,
each fulfilling its nature.
Whether in accord or opposition, sharing aspirations or differing in wisdom,
the divine connection unites them.
Harmonizing and guiding,
responding with accord,
following the natural order of things,
not losing their proper place—
speech adapts to square and circle,
movements are level and easy.
Daily renewal and change
align with the natural.
Let great and small, long and short,
broad and narrow, many and few,
each find its proper place—
then even gulls may be tamed,
fierce beasts may be reared.
Abiding in timeliness and accordance,
one may merge with the profound virtue,
pervading and unifying all,
circulating without peril.
In nurturing the myriad things,
governing all under Heaven—
what else is there but this?
This is the principle of constant victory.
The Way of the sage—
is it not nearly perfected?

**Indulgence, Chapter Sixty-Eight**
Indulgence in idleness and dissipation,
reckless wandering abroad,
intoxicated by sound, beauty, and perverse pleasures,
heedless and unaware—
this is the blindness of the common people,
losing their proper place.
Galloping in the hunt,
feasting in extravagance and arrogance,
boasting of wealth and nobility,
wearing tattered caps and worn robes,
seeking prominence in the marketplace,
wearing out the heart and wasting the body,
sleepless through the night,
forgetting meals by day,
entangled in countless troubles—
losing one’s will for fame,
harming oneself for profit,
exhausting life in trivial pursuits,
unaware of the great Way—
how grievously sad!
The six senses entangle one another,
and virtue is lost.
Chasing illusory realms,
things vie to deceive—
thus the eyes indulge in what they see,
enchanted by artful smiles and fair forms;
the ears indulge in what they hear,
bewitched by the lewd music of Zheng and Wei;
the nose indulges in what it seeks,
sniffing at rank, pungent, and decaying scents;
the mouth indulges in what it utters,
speaking groundless words;
the body indulges in what it desires,
delighting in fine silks and thick furs.
The eyes’ indulgence
leads to wandering in dissolute scenes—
thus water is used to quench water,
fire to extinguish fire.
The more names one gains,
the less a single day of ease,
the more myriad forms of fatigue,
anxiously awaiting death—
is this not the greatest sorrow?
The true nature is harmed,
the spiritual root withers,
turning from the Way and forgetting the source,
unable to observe its return.
I alone fear the unseen signs,
not allowing what nourishes to harm its own nourishment.
Let us consider:
A person’s seven-foot form
embodies the principles of Heaven and Earth.
Thus the head is round and the feet square,
modeled on the two forces;
the nose is high and the mouth deep,
modeled on mountains and valleys;
the limbs and flesh connect like soil,
the blood vessels flow like rivers and streams;
warmth and vapor resemble blazing fire,
breath and qi differ not from wind and clouds.
Within, all things are complete—
nothing is lacking.
Thus the true person casts aside fleeting worldly concerns,
contemplates the primal harmony of the Dao and virtue,
welcoming the divine and drifting like duckweed,
coming lightly, departing silently.

**Inner and Outer, Chapter Sixty-Nine**
The subtleties of inner and outer
lead to confusion and ruin when unchecked.
Anxious thoughts and restless actions,
frivolity and severity,
a multitude of illusions
alternate day and night before one,
yet none know their origin.
Only the greatly enlightened remain steadfast and joyful in wholeness.
Rank and wealth do not enslave the body,
sorrow and hardship, poverty and success do not diminish life.
Calming desires and settling speech,
unburdened by convention,
unwearied in mind—
thus free from resentment, obstinacy, and sorrow.
Therefore the perfected person controls destiny from within,
not seeking fulfillment from without,
forgetting the liver and gall,
leaving behind the ears and eyes—
then spirit and wisdom become serene,
the face and cheeks empty and tranquil.
Wandering at the beginning of creation,
one merges with the profound obscurity.

**Discourse on Discerning Delusion, Chapter Seventy**

Delusion and confusion, myriad and boundless—like one who forgets to return home, such are the people of obscured understanding. Launching a boat on dry land, extinguishing fire in water—these are not acts of madness. Why is this so? Though one amasses wealth and bribes, one cannot devise a way to exhaust their use; though one frets over riches and honor, one cannot enjoy them for all time. Glory and disgrace intertwine, rising and hesitating in turn, yet one’s anxieties never cease; though one prepares grand feasts of the finest meats to nourish the body, one cannot preserve life. Those who attend to form are distant indeed, foolish indeed—how coarse and far removed from wisdom! How can the people of this world be deemed worthy? Is this not extreme?

When the spirit and consciousness wander outward, one may labor a lifetime without accomplishing a single work—how lamentable! They mistake gold and jade for mere vessels, regard life and destiny as empty nothingness, cherish the ancestral shrines of others while abandoning their own fields and gardens, bind themselves to the five aggregates, and drift amidst the seven emotions. They obscure the radiant torch of wisdom, plunge into the abyss of filth and disgrace, and wear away the root of their spirit, never once attaining ease.

Thus the sage treats the world as a temporary lodging, sees favor and affection as carvings upon bone, and knows that what takes form is not truly form, that what gives life does not truly transform. Therefore, they daily cast aside worldly entanglements. They regard beauty as a blade, cautious and unwilling to act; they see wealth and honor as mere insects and sparrows, enjoying them without pride. Brocade robes and jade chambers are to them like tattered curtains and frayed mats; fine foods and rare delicacies, like coarse grains and plain fare.

In this way, they cultivate wisdom in tranquility, rest in profound stillness, cleanse themselves of craving for sensory pleasures, and uphold kindness and frugality. Their wisdom and brilliance illuminate the world, their virtue and teachings, their benevolent winds, spread fragrance across the four seas. Then, drifting through the gate of the supremely subtle, deeply serene, and wondrously quiescent, they attain vast emptiness and the ineffable, wandering freely in eternal constancy.

**Compendium of Essentials, Chapter Seventy-One**

The essentials of the primordial net encompass all mysteries, illuminating ten thousand generations to come with flawless radiance, free from obscurity. They guide the world’s people back to the constant Dao, allowing all things to attain their natural state—luminous and unobstructed, their thoughts alert, awakened to the true source.

Thus it is said:
Transformation without end—this is the perfection of penetration.
Purity without admixture—this is the subtlety of essence.
Vast and unobstructed—this is the ultimate of the Dao.
Profound and all-penetrating—this is the depth of the real.
Surveying the myriad things—this is the clarity of the sage.
Virtue permeating the animate and inanimate—this is the highest kindness.
Transforming even the lowly—this is the ability of the worthy.
Loyalty and forbearance unerring—this is the goodness of the good.
Mind and wisdom ever bright—this is the completeness of wisdom.
Emptiness, stillness, and indifference—this is the numinosity of spirit.
Serene unity and ease—this is the nourishment of qi.
Eloquent and expansive speech—this is the keenness of talent.
Sincerity without pretense—this is the steadfastness of will.
Humility in conduct—this is the greatness of fortune.

Those of ancient times who cultivated the real examined these many virtues, followed them in the world, and thus interfaced with heaven and humanity—the great Dao was fulfilled.

As for the origin of unity, vast and unbounded, pure and empty, primordial and formless, merged yet unassuming, flowing and expansive, operating without trace, subtly quiescent—it is stabilized by simplicity, nurtures the ten thousand spirits, lush and flourishing, unhurried yet effortless. Spreading throughout the cosmos, its words shine brilliantly, unstained and untainted. Its use is complete in its subtlety, free from affairs and desires, serving as the world’s model.

The arts of the Dao in ancient times were found in this. Now, Master Changquan heard of its influence and delighted in it. He practiced the learning of non-learning, dwelled where the multitude shunned, solitary and withdrawn, retiring from the world. Awkward and plainspoken, he did not let red and purple disrupt his true hue. Earnest and content, indistinct and formless, he emerged and submerged like waves upon the water, his transformations without constancy.

He did not precede others, yet followed things afterward; he did not sever or display, his merit equal to all. He pared away excess, harmonizing the courtyard with purity and harmony. He took the worn as new, the weak as strong, the clumsy as skillful, the humble as true. Alone, he matched the four seasons like a horse, took emptiness as his forest, non-accumulation as sufficiency, the one as the many, the root as essence, the old as vast.

His words, though plain and austere, were not like jade—yet they ascended without peril, stirred without harm. Utterly great, without exterior; utterly small, without interior. His use was vast and expansive, merging with the great unity. Emerging from our lineage, he obscured life and death, blending ancient and present.

He saw fortune and abundance as turbid and sinking, beyond grasp. Thus, in recitation, song, dance, and leaping steps, he stood above the multitudes, knowing not why he was so, yet so he was.

Vague and joyous, yin and yang cannot be reckoned, ghosts and spirits cannot fathom its bounds. Its principle is drawn from yet never exhausted, poured into yet never filled—vast as the source of rivers and seas, without end.

Now, the debates of the hundred schools, the arts and skills of various crafts, though established in the central states and promoted in their time, though useful, inevitably vie for profit, encroach upon the people’s nature, and erode morality. Deceit and malice diverge, unable to return to true constancy—how could they be reversed?

Thus, the people of disorder and chaff, restless amidst the ten thousand things, weave and leap without cease. If one merely speaks of the square and round, the towering and lofty, and aspires to ascend and traverse them, they stand perilously at the brink.

**Utmost Sayings, Chapter Seventy-Two**

Utmost words are wordless; utmost knowledge is unknowing; utmost joy is joyless; utmost action is actionless. The utmost joy is never without joy; the actionless is never without action. Pure qi surges within, manifesting in outward ease. Suspicion and jealousy dissolve entirely, and things return to their nature.

Thus, fish and turtles share the same waters, elk and deer roam the same wilds—even birds and beasts do not shun one another, how much more should humans?

To illuminate the distant by verifying the near, to know the root by observing the branch—this is why words are forgotten.

Yet people speak—though their mouths may utter words, their hearts have never truly spoken. They go against the world, their minds disdaining it, sinking together into oblivion. This is not something the flickering light of a torch or the followers of names and distinctions could comprehend. What does it mean?

Chasing the branches of the ten thousand things without returning to the wondrous source invites the suspicion of transgressing principle. The weariness of the pine and cypress arises from venting their qi and entangling their thoughts, enslaving their minds in pursuit of the Dao, seeking truth by pouring into rivers—like gusting winds and sudden rains that arise with the seasons, causing grasses and trees to flourish. Yet the spirit’s palace becomes obstructed, overgrown within, unable to be cleared. How is this different from carelessly using a Sui pearl to shoot a sparrow on a thousand-fathom cliff? How lamentable!

Only those who comprehend Heaven reach the utmost. The aspirations of the lame turtle, the doctrines of street-corner sophists, the knowledge of those who claim equal wisdom—these are but shallow indeed.

**Dongyuan Collection, Scroll Three**

**Preface and Poems by Changquanzi of Guishan, in Harmony with Langranzi**

I have heard that those who tread the mysterious path of cultivating truth do not follow a single principle, nor do they guard a single gate. Some enter the Dao from the mundane, while others transform the mundane through the Dao—though their affairs and proximities differ, how may one discern the distinction?

I reply: Enlightenment may be sudden or gradual, and learning reveals depths and shallows. What does this mean? Even coarse words may spark profound insight; their patterns, though playful and strange, shine forth with undeniable clarity. Thus, in ancient times, the writings of Zhuangzi, Liezi, Wenzi, and Gengsangzi molded heaven and earth, rode the winds and clouds, mastered the transformations of the six qi, and roamed beyond the eight directions. They harnessed the sun and moon, traversed the cosmos, refined all beings, and extended their blessings even to insects. They expounded the Dao and virtue, aiding the mysterious origin, sweeping through antiquity and the present. Following the course of creation, they silenced the debates of a hundred schools, forged the pivot of ten thousand methods, opened the swift path to transcendence, and unfolded the sublime teachings of the great sages. How vast were these four perfected ones! Were they not those who transformed the mundane through the Dao?

As for those who enter the Dao from the mundane, their number across kalpas has been vast indeed—too many to record in full. Recently, in leisure, I perused the *Songs of the Dao* by Master Langranzi of the Tang, thirty-one poems in all. Their language is spare, their purport profound, outwardly illuminating the principles of the indistinct and obscure, inwardly penetrating the source of embryonic breathing and the flow of qi. Beholding such true attainment, how could one forget it? Alas, though my nature is no more than wood or earth, how could I fail to see the worthy and aspire to emulate them? Thus, unashamed of my wild and unpolished efforts, I humbly continue the tail of the sable, not daring to hope for later generations’ mending, but simply yielding to the ease of idleness and self-contentment.

**I.**
Dream breaks at golden millet’s prime—youth’s zenith,
he turns to forest depths, pillowing on clouded sleep.
Had he not leapt free from the toil-worn den,
how could he fathom the subtle, wondrous power?
The sword of wisdom cleaves the path of sages past,
his spirit-light pierces the ninefold heavens.
From this, he roams unbound through the mortal sea—
who knows this carefree immortal of the earth?

**II.**
At times within his gourd he savors endless spring,
beholding the primal face in its true guise.
Beyond the world, he knows the supreme Dao,
yet in the realm, he meets no man of jade-green hue.
Idly he plants jade trees in the mystic garden,
thirst slaked by the radiant nectar of the Flowery Pool.
Though mulberry fields shift with the sea’s vast change,
the immortal’s scene stays ever fresh through all four seasons.

**III.**
The Dao entrusts itself to my body in the Great Simplicity,
my floating traces care not for east or west.
The spirit-terrace, still, harmonizes with heaven and man,
my refined bearing scorns the vulgar crowd’s embrace.
In jade grottoes, the flute’s song delights a thousand sages,
in the crimson furnace, snow melts to open a hundred gates.
A hint of this wondrous use is spoken plain—
not the dust-bound world’s severance of form and void.

**IV.**
Cultivation must unravel its tangles,
blowing away the clouds of ten thousand kalpas from the spirit-terrace.
A single point of ease forgets craving and desire,
the six gates hushed, all sounds and echoes stilled.
Within the breast, a wondrous will of spirit stirs,
in hand, the deep-wrought patterns of the sacred key.
The golden body refined, he soars beyond—
no ghost of yin shall weep at a lonely grave.

**V.**
Not coveting the world’s wealth, strife, or gain,
he awakens to heaven’s truth, cutting all coming and going.
Kindness sprouts green shoots from withered wood,
cold ashes flare to crimson flame once more.
Having grasped the Dao’s wondrous principle of emptiness,
why fear the relentless press of day and night?
Pitiful, those who waste their fleeting lives—
in secret, their temples whiten with hoarfrost.

**VI.**
The cage of the mundane shattered, he rests at last,
carefree, untroubled, forgetting the turn of seasons.
Wine, beauty, wrath, and wealth—no true livelihood,
but harmony and tranquility are the root of good.
If asked of the elixir of long life,
he searches the seas for companions beyond the world.
Once the golden turtle is hooked and reeled in,
he lies at ease, high upon the white clouds’ crest.

**VII.**
For decades adrift in the mortal sea,
heaven-born, he scorns the gates of lords and marquises.
The qi-mother, like a tortoise, nurtures endlessly,
the heart’s abyss, like a valley, holds depths untold.
Fire blazes in the cinnabar field, golden chrysanthemums bloom,
lead boils in the crucible, jade nectar warms.
Who can speak of the celestial mechanism seized?
He probes the Three Lights, grateful for the sages’ grace.

**VIII.**
The Mystic Pearl secured, his life’s work done,
its use adapts to every moment, everywhere clear.
With both hands, he rends the net of life and death,
his whole being leaps free from the pit of profit and fame.
If he explores the Gate of Dui to seal its power,
he knows the Valley Spirit shall never perish.
Pillowed high in the grotto-heaven beyond the world’s dust,
he pities the ants who scramble for fleeting glory.

**IX.**
No envy for the highest ranks of golden seals,
with cause, he awakens to the Dao—no hardship there.
Qi and spirit in harmony, life is firmly rooted,
passions and desires unseated, the body finds peace.
The shell-gate’s locks of the Three Essentials are struck open,
in the jade furnace, the elixir of the nine heavens is refined.
Such flavors are priceless,
not like common herbs at all.

**X.**
Speak not of mountains, forests, or market dust—
where is the wild cloud not at ease?
On Kunlun, mist gathers where dragons coil in their caves,
in grotto-palaces, wind stirs where tigers roar on peaks.
With resolve, one may feast on the phoenix’s marrow,
without merit, the jade boy’s face cannot be preserved.
The Dao of the Mysterious Origin is known to those who awaken—
in the land of Uncarved Simplicity, they tread homeward in peace.

**XI.**
To whom can I transmit these secrets?
All bear the marks of the vulgar and mundane.
They know only to cherish wife and child,
who can deepen the root and secure the stem?
Within, the five viscera’s spirit-essence is depleted,
without, the Three Powers’ virtue and grace are betrayed.
Beholding this, how foolish men seem—
not cultivating the immortal realm, they sink into the earth.

**XII.**
The jade palace of the immortal path is not far or deep,
yet learners fail to awaken to their original heart.
Who has ever known the frost of the Mystic Cassia?
The inferior horse and mad ape cannot restrain themselves.
Feet tread the azure mist to wander the imperial courts,
the body rides a white deer through jade forests.
The natural Dharma-realm must be made clear—
do not follow the deluded, seeking outward.

**XIII.**
Abiding in ease, at peace in a humble dwelling,
unentangled in worldly affairs, his ties are few.
In the case, the Seven-Star Sword lies idle,
on the shelf, the Three Sages’ books are stored deep.
A heart of ice and snow scorns wealth and honor,
a bearing of water and clouds disdains the void.
By the thatched window, a pillow of pure wind suffices—
why envy those tossed by the red dust’s favor and disgrace?

**XIV.**
Wash away love and desire, swiftly return to purity,
recognize the truth that has always been your own.
Do not cling to the red-powdered charms of the chamber,
but follow the crimson-city dwellers beyond the world.
In the mystic furnace, the elixir of long life is refined,
in the treasure vault, the indestructible body is forged.
In the moon’s palace and starry towers, ever at ease,
the golden countenance grows ever clearer through ten thousand kalpas.

**XV.**
Neither monk nor layman, nor Confucian scholar,
he savors the ease of idleness, his joy unbounded.
Life and destiny are already understood beyond the world—
why fret over honors and splendor absent in this realm?
His heart, like the bright moon, shines high and low,
his body, like a lone cloud, rolls and unfurls at will.
Roaming the cosmos in true delight,
he spares his heart from the world’s driving cares.

**XVI.**
Having ingested the wondrous pill of emptiness,
naturally, his spirit shines with a youthful glow.
His radiant wisdom gleams like the noonday sun,
his body and mind stand firm as Mount Tai.
The magic mushrooms remain fragrant through all four seasons,
the celestial light stays serene through ten thousand kalpas.
If worldly men could daily practice thus,
they would live in joy, soaring through the universe.

**XVII.**
Not misled by heterodox paths or external dharmas,
how many learners awaken to non-action?
Cutting away passions and desires, ever pure and bright,
no need to torment the flesh with cold and hunger.
Silently, he perfects the fruit of the untainted,
endlessly, he gives birth to the child of transformation.
With merit complete and affairs settled, he leaves the mortal world,
riding the crane to court the sages at dawn.

**XVIII.**
In learning the Dao, never seek the outer elixir—
scattered essence and yang cannot return.
Within the five thousand characters, heaven’s principle is clear,
through the twelve hours, the jade countenance is preserved.
Delighting in a simple gourd and plain fare,
his nature, like the cloud-crane, loves emptiness and leisure.
Who in the marketplace knows me, chasing fame and profit?
I roam at ease, unburdened, through heaven and earth.

**XIX.**
Following causes, he passes through without force,
day by day, diligently turning inward to cultivate.

**XX.**
The flute’s melody in grotto-palaces transcends pitch and tone,
the radiance of the gourd-heaven knows no spring or autumn.
At the feast of golden nectar and fragrant peaches,
clouds part to bestow rainbow robes upon the feathered immortals.
Does the Great Dao distinguish between poverty and wealth?
Who in the dusty world would cease their ten thousand pursuits?

**XXI.**
Seeing through the fleeting years, spring and autumn pass,
though others envy me, I deem it no great feat.
I carve open the Great Dao’s path to Chang’an,
seeking a true friend to transcend the worldly stream.
In pure and simple towers, I leisurely delight,
in the distant, dim palace halls, I celebrate my return to rest.
After toasting and drinking, I sleep in sweet intoxication,
drunk and oblivious to the sorrows of the mortal realm.

**XXII.**
Laughing at the fly’s head and snail’s horn fame,
a true man, with resolve, awakens to perfection.
A heart full of wind and moon repays the three joys,
a life amid ten thousand acres of mist and rosy clouds.
With discerning eyes and a brocade mind, a guest of heaven,
amid the red dust and fragrant grasses, worldly passions.
Freely I return to the days of Xuan Du,
soaring high like the roc, ninety thousand leagues.

**XXIII.**
Divine light shines bright, illuminating Penglai’s isles,
who knows the three islands hold a different path?
In the secluded cloud-chamber, no defilement,
the luminous sea of awakening clears itself.
Precious blossoms bloom in radiant splendor,
true fire steeps the body in its course.
When this work is accomplished,
I shall invite the Five Elders to behold the primordial essence.

**XXIV.**
Let the carriages and caps of wealth be his,
none escape the fetters that bind their true nature.
Fleeting gains and floating life arise from delusion,
the celestial mechanism’s secret—do not guess at random.
The marvels of spiritual power transcend past and present,
qi congeals into pure yang, scorning calamity.
When merit is complete and the warts of karma dissolved,
where shall I go? Riding a radiant phoenix to gaze upon the jade terrace.

**XXV.**
Thatched huts in secluded fields, white cogon grass entwined,
my name inscribed in the registers of the Great Luo Heaven.
I long to roam the seas and bestow the mysterious treasure,
yet in the human world, no old friends remain.
Fire-dates and jade nectar cannot be shown,
golden hooks and fragrant bait are cast in vain.
The dusty world is no place to settle,
I gather the mist and rosy clouds, returning to the phoenix’s nest.

**XXVI.**
Tending fields and estates, hoping to glorify the family,
heedless of the frost at the temples and the greying hair.
To relieve suffering and aid the poor, no grain is spared,
while the resentful heart commits sins like grains of sand.
Not cultivating wisdom to wander the immortal isles,
indulging greed and lust, racing with yakshas.
To lose this human form is to meet it never again—
the sages in the void sigh in silent sorrow.

**XXVII.**
Do not be deluded by flowers and wine, enamored of fleeting glory,
examine body and mind, walk beyond the material.
Your present livelihood should remain pure and still,
all past schemes and cunning must be wholly cast aside.
Hour by hour, refine the cyclical stems,
day by day, harmonize spirit, qi, and essence.
Do not say the cultivation of truth bears no fruit—
the celestial immortals secretly add your name.

**XXVIII.**
Having awakened to the two scrolls of the *Yellow Court*,
turn inward to behold the wondrous treasure of body and life.
Standing firm in the void, holding up the pillar of heaven,
within the gourd, the crescent moon furnace shines bright.
Drunk on flowing rosy clouds, I slumber in the crimson palace,
idly wielding the torch of wisdom, I play in the numinous void.
The swift path to heaven is open to all—
doubt not, for it is ignorance that blinds.

**XXIX.**
Procrastinating the months and years, neglecting cultivation,
ten thousand cares assail the heart, karma’s workings.
In the yang realm, one cannot practice perfect virtue,
in the netherworld’s courts, suffering is beyond doubt.
Dwelling in primordial chaos, free from disaster,
entering and exiting the realm of clarity, ageless.
Turning back, the cloud-path to my homeland lies smooth—
in the Land of Huaxu, I keep my destined tryst.

**XXX.**
I urge students: cease your aimless seeking,
recognize at every turn the wondrous true heart.
Your own palace is not small,
the mountains and rivers of the earth are not deep.
A belly full of wind and clouds forms auspicious omens,
a gourd of stars and constellations transforms into refined gold.
Peerless across the four seas, no friends to be found,
I alone listen to the soundless music of the vast.

**XXXI.**
Close the earthly gates, open the heavenly doors,
the iron tree blooms from a different root.
White snow and yellow sprouts meet at the three junctures,
golden crow and jade hare race in flight.
Let the foolish and impure perish in vain—
the Dao abides, ever clear and void.
Practice compassion and forbearance, widely bestow expedient means,
return to the Purple Palace to repay your master’s grace.

**XXXII.**
Once enlightened to the profound mystery,
merit complete, I ascend to the grotto-heavens.
Who has grasped these secret verses?
A fine name endures through the ages.
Riding the wind in broad daylight is not the Dao,
playing in the moonlit empyrean is not immortality.
Having fathomed the formless principle of the subtle and serene,
I merge into a single strand of good cause.

**After Tao Yuanming’s “Returning Home” Rhyme**

Returning home, ah!
To the land of nothingness, I return in solitude.
Awakened to the subtle and serene, the Dao’s essence,
I escape reproach and resentment, sparing my heart sorrow.
Guard each word, let none escape—
even a team of four horses cannot retrieve them.
Sweep away the tracks of flies and snails,
cleanse the rights and wrongs of past and present.
Delight in the quail’s nest and the simurgh’s meal,
wear hempen clothes and kudzu sandals.
Prevent misfortune before its signs appear,
discern the subtle before it manifests.
Heaven and earth turn like a wheel,
the four seasons rush in their course.
I tread the vast expanse,
enter the wondrous gate in silence.
Simple as uncarved wood,
serene, perhaps abiding.
Sated with virtue,
drunk on the winecup.
Moved by ritual, I respond to the moment,
pleased by the Dao, I ease my countenance.
Abandoning kindness and frugality, what remains?
Only tranquility brings peace.
Preserving breath, I strengthen my heels,
mastering closure, I need no locks.
Ever at ease with the three joys,
forever desireless, I observe alone.
Embracing the cosmos, I come and go,
laughing at the wormwood and weeds as I wander.
Inheriting the elegance of Gu Mountain,
I linger by the winding Liao River.
Returning home, ah!
Do not follow Zang or Gu in cutting ties.
Follow your true nature, nurture simplicity—
know contentment, seek nothing more.
Sigh at the illusions that arise from delusion,
find true joy and forget sorrow.
Seeing through Zhuang Zhou’s butterfly dream,
I hold high my resolve, delighting in the fields.
Gathering herbs on emerald slopes,
fishing by moonlight in a small boat.
Obtaining the dark pearl where images fail,
meeting a true friend in Master Hu Qiu.
Severing the net of doubt with the sword of wisdom,
washing the dusty tassel in the clear stream.
Understanding life as fleeting,
realizing death as rest.
So be it.
Abiding in harmony, at peace with the times,
each moment slips away like a crack in the door—hard to retain.

Who can purify and refine to achieve this?
Upright yet not severe, sincere yet not bound by expectation.
A single spark of numinous light—natural and unforced,
ten thousand acres of cloud-fields bear no seed.

Filling limbs and body, sitting in forgetfulness,
moved by spirits and ghosts to compose poetry.
Uniting the myriad things in one treasury,
wandering in the great expanse—what doubt remains?

This staff—
this staff is no worldly thing,
not some common green bamboo or vine.
Upright and wondrous, perfectly straight and new,
its use is clear, without flaw or bend.

It parts the mist and clouds,
strikes the valley of Kun,
pierces the sky to dot the spring verdure.
Dragged or brandished, it displays its numinous might,
shattering emptiness so gods and ghosts submit.

Roaming mountains and seas,
it guides phoenixes and cranes,
flicking forth fragrant mists of sacred fungi.
It pries open jade caves where phoenixes dwell in vain,
dips into the wine of awakening to sober the drunken eye.

What branch or root is this?
A formless tree,
nurtured by heaven, earth, and stars.
Born in the Seven Treasures Grove as the Tree of Enlightenment,
bathed in the Jade Wave Palace’s radiant springs.

Gathered and reaped, it has no flesh or skin,
its prajñā form too subtle to touch.
Yet its innate elegance is perfectly complete,
setting down the pure wind to suffice the Three Realms.

A single slender jade dragon, cold and pale,
a true kin of the immortals beyond the world.

Awakening—
awakening within awakening, enlightenment within enlightenment,
a single spark of numinous clarity, unobstructed.
Unleashing a blazing flame to illumine the sahā world,
the Dharma realm unfolds in all directions, uniquely revealed.

These tidings are most subtle,
the wooden man points afar—white clouds return.
This mysterious pass is hard to speak of,
yet once grasped before the eyes, all scheming ceases.

Not the tangled vines of an old woman’s chatter,
but the true, compassionate, wondrous key.
A bright moon lifted on the staff’s tip,
a brazier of red flame cradling spring snow.

I am originally a cultivator of the Great Awakening,
who suddenly grasped the Chan of the ancestral masters.
Returning to the snowy valley, none respond,
emerald bamboo and yellow blossoms embody spontaneity.

In the painted hall, a single censer emits fine smoke,
vainly sighing at Mañjuśrī’s inquiry into illness.
The moon over Caoxi shines bright, the wind is clear,
golden lotuses bloom across the Jetavana’s grounds.

Shouldering the tiger staff, I return at once,
snow seals the cold mountain path, leaving no way open.
Who in this moment understands such freedom?
Only the few plum branches—true kindred spirits.

Since recognizing the road to Chang’an,
I no longer cherish idle blossoms or wild grasses.
Deep in the night, the cuckoo cries from the branch,
while within the gourd, pavilions and terraces bask in spring’s perfection.

Arriving home, at ease in effortless joy,
everywhere the sacred signs manifest.
Were it not for the thousand hands and eyes of great compassion,
the jade being would not lift the ancient mani.

By what Dharma treasure is this thing revealed?
In the profound, the dim, the fleeting and indistinct.
Sentient beings do not recognize this Tathāgata,
the lion’s den of buddhas across the three times.

To whom can one boast of true leisure and true joy?
All are but cranes and frogs in a well.
When the song of the empty zither ends,
green mountains remain, locked in mist and clouds.

True Emptiness, Wondrous Form—
true emptiness, wondrous form is no mere adornment,
from ancient times to now, none have recognized it.
A mass of pure radiance, displaying auspicious splendor,
ten thousand rays of clear light—even spirits cannot fathom.

Illumining the Three Realms,
shining upon the heavens,
its exquisitely refined body ever fresh.
Responding to things as they arise, without attachment,
the ancestral master who grasps it is called the Golden Immortal.

Ever lustrous, ever pristine,
neither increasing nor diminishing, without birth or extinction.
Sentient beings fail to understand this,
vainly contorting themselves outside its bounds.

Roaming mountains and rivers in search of sages,
all are fools—how can they discern?
Speak of returning, dancing alone in the spring wind,
at ease beneath the plum branch’s moon.

Wine—
I love wine, true wine,
not the worldly kind mixed with flowers and willows.
To brew it requires fine, true ingredients,
a master of numinous clarity and divine skill.

In the jade pot, blending yin and yang,
adding water and fire at the proper time.
The exquisite flavor is called nectar,
drinking it, one never decays through the ages.

It restores youthful complexion,
increases fortune and longevity,
so drunk one forgets heaven and earth exist.
Awakening, sitting alone in the great void,
dispelling the clouds of delusion to gaze at the stars.

When weary, becoming an immortal in drunkenness,
body as enduring as the seas and mountains.

Beauty—
I love beauty, true beauty,
ever replenishing essence and fluids within.
Always letting the red phoenix embrace the black turtle,
rejoicing together in the Palace of Five Lights.

Music without strings, the eight sounds in harmony,
delighting the old yellow woman to no end.
Husband and wife unite in the ninefold transformation,
their work complete, giving birth to the jade infant boy.

With fine bearing, golden countenance,
especially fond of crimson curtains and red brocade canopies.
In an instant, growing vast to face the origin,
their transformations and divine powers beyond measure.

In the Land of Huaxu, enjoying effortless ease,
carefree and at liberty, singing mysterious songs.

Wealth—
I covet wealth, true wealth,
gaining it brings only benefit, no loss or regret.
Shi Chong’s Golden Valley is not precious,
my family’s treasures are few, yet none can guess.

In the Silver Mist Cave, the Azure Cloud Mound,
endless jade and silk are nurtured within.
Embroidered quilts, brocade bundles, pearls and jade,
how can they compare to phoenixes and pavilions in the distance?

Building a dwelling called Terrace of Heaven,
planting every kind of flower and tree in the courtyard.
Peaches of immortality, cinnamon of the moon, sacred fungi,
blooming through the seasons beneath the eternal sun and moon.

Driving dragons and tigers, summoning wind and thunder,
bestowing jade plums across the five lakes and four seas.
Establishing a household to seek true friends,
consorting with immortals beyond the world.

Qi—
I contend for qi, the true qi,
not the common kind that merely supplements spleen and stomach.
In stillness and silence, guarding harmony,
nurturing the gentle bubbling of the furnace and cauldron.

Penetrating the workings of creation, activating yin and yang,
nourishing the myriad things to flourish in fragrance.
A single vast point connecting heaven and earth,
within the gourd, misty vapors display auspicious signs.

Utterly pure and void, utterly strong and great,
pervading the Dharma body in constant peace.
In emptiness, the five colors gather in exquisite clarity,
refining pure yang to transcend the world.

Gathering and returning—where does one go?
To the Hall of Primordial Chaos, the Dragon-Flower Assembly.

The Cowherd—
Wearing a bamboo hat in the spring wind,
piling straw raincoat toward evening’s clear sky.
Molding sand, idly playing,
tapping tiles, laughing in welcome.

Gathering grasses to seek hidden delights,
riding an ox, weary of walking.

The barbarian’s head shrivels tight,
his demon belly swells, his neck bulges thick.
Songs rise for five or seven li,
flutes trill two or three notes.
Beckoning along narrow paths,
they gather, swarming like flying flies.
Knowing only the joy of border patrols,
how would they grasp the shock of favor or disgrace?
Pointing the way like herding horses,
lifting stones like Xu Youping.
Sleeping pillowed on emerald mist,
returning to chant beneath lingering light.
Through the woods they gather rabbit nets,
scoop water to rinse the dust from their caps.
Grasslands clamor all day long,
woodcutters’ songs last a lifetime.
King Xuan once consulted the oracle,
and his imperial enterprise flourished anew.

**Muxiang (Wood Fragrance)**
Spring’s light nears its end,
luxuriant blossoms begin to scatter.
The feathered adept plants in seclusion,
muxiang blooms just in time.
Auspicious clouds congeal on swelling buds,
green leaves drape like hanging pouches.
Snow-like yet thick with petals,
smooth as cream yet bearing form.
Powdered sacs unfurl in small lattice pots,
jade-like herbs gleam beyond sparse fences.
Graceful in the wind’s caress,
radiant beneath the moon’s gaze.
Fragrance beckons fine admirers,
adornment given without reserve.
Favored by the wise and good,
no need for bees or butterflies to know.
Spirit kindled by fair scenes,
elegance outshines lush branches.
Scent clings to sleeves,
cool shade surpasses embroidered curtains.
Who pities the fleeting hour?
Only I keep this fine tryst.
Marvel upon marvel—unmatched,
common reds and purples cannot compare.

**Lamenting the World**
Have you not seen—
years hasten, days and nights urge on like a turning wheel?
A century passes in a finger’s snap,
in an instant mulberry fields become ravines.
Have you not seen—
leaves parting branches, life flickering past like a crack?
Sparks, lightning, a candle in the wind,
a floating pivot on water—what is there to vie for?
Vying like ants butting horns,
decked in red and green,
floating fame, floating profit thick as porridge.
Toil of body and mind—when will it end?
Only when the executioner’s blade falls at Cloud Yang.
Wasting spirit on wine and flowers,
like fleas spinning cocoons to imprison themselves.
Wealth amassed—who will enjoy it?
Eyes close, leaving only a mound of dust.
Sigh for the cicada, the morning mushroom,
suddenly born, suddenly gone.
Yet worn down by spring and autumn’s silent grind,
achieving nothing, only withering away.
The clam’s dream, the puppet stage,
a hundred tricks performed on a staff’s end.
The moment the strings snap—no trace,
only the laughter of the wise.
Perusing the *Book of Zhou*, studying the *Tang Annals*,
countless paths to ruin or glory.
What became of ancient heroes?
Foxes keep company beneath Northern Yu Mountain.
How unlike me—
proud amidst mist and clouds,
wielding a three-foot blade to slay demons.
Planting Tao Yuanming’s chrysanthemums by the fence,
cultivating Shao Ping’s melons in the garden.
A heart like ice and snow,
a resolve like pine and bamboo.
Seeing through the yellow root’s folly—how laughable!
By a thatched window, a single pillow, humming idly,
a clay tripod simmering with aloeswood—ever knowing the Way.
This flavor—no empty words—
ten thousand layered mountains veiled in green mist.
No wonder I return late from Dongting,
where in the wild clouds is there not a home?

**The Joy of Sleep**
Leisurely and carefree, I delight in rest,
now and then bending my arm for a pillow.
Thank heaven for this idle body,
why envy the splendor of high office?
Cool and composed after a simple meal,
all affairs forgotten, sleeves draped over my head.
In a thatched hut beside a pine pavilion,
this repose is sweeter than honey.
Before the curtain, autumn branches toy with the wutong,
beneath the couch, crickets chirp freely.
At ease like Bian Xiaoxian,
who napped by day and was deemed wise.
Knowing fate, delighting in the Dao, forgetting poverty’s flattery,
joy fills the bookshelf, years melt away.
Great was the Duke of Zhou’s dream of old,
drowning thoughts, the spirit unburdened.
Body like rotting wood, lost in darkness,
nature like dead ashes, forgetting odes and hymns.
On a rattan bed, a deep slumber—no cares,
not hearing the clear stream beside my ears.
In a moment, lost in murky stillness,
my soul wanders Hua Xu’s spring hues.
People’s endless trivialities—
dawn and dusk alike in confusion.
Willows shade pavilions, ice mats cool,
tender lotus dots the green pond.
Scenery changes, years pass,
ambitions unfulfilled, yellow millet scattered.
Long sighing for the reclusive elder Xi Yi,
who on the hidden peaks knew this?
Ancient caves buried in clouds, scorning the marketplace,
to this day their fame shines through the world.
Better to hear early of Cloud Creek,
where glory and decay, profit and rank—what are they worth?
"Return!" The three paths remain,
calling the young to dwell by the eastern fence.
What favor did Zai Yu once enjoy, what disgrace now?
Behind Du’s cloud-sealed door, peacefully abiding.
A moonlit window, crystalline and cold,
aids my lifelong love of sleep.
Firm in Poverty

The old rustic’s song of steadfast poverty—
who dares pass it on?
In the rice bowl, spiders weave their webs,
ants breed in the pot.
Sleeping soundly, content in one’s lot,
why blame heaven for calloused hands?
Straightening a hat pinned with rotten wood,
buying wine with elm-seed coins.
Basking in the sun, gathering fireflies,
crossing the ford in a mustard-seed boat.
Gathering fern on distant peaks,
gleaning grain in barren fields.
The window of Kui—
dim and near, reeds grow naturally.
Dust fills the empty walls,
beans sustain the waning years.
Sleeping on fragrant grass,
purifying the heart, forsaking the hearth’s smoke.
Old vines serve as a tiger’s staff,
broken branches trail like a chanting whip.
Only the three joys of poverty,
not a speck of earthly dust.
Beyond the body, dwelling in a humble lane,
washing ears near a clear spring.
Sitting in tears, still knowing this,
singing as I walk—how pitiable!
Ji Lun is no true friend,
Yuan Xian is my equal.
Sandals mended with sedge threads,
clothes patched with wooden cords.
Cold springs like ancient mirrors,
fallen leaves compose fine verses.
Lacking the strength of the River Overseer,
deeply grateful for wrapped green rice.
Forgetting the brocade halls,
leaving the potter’s wheel to fate.
Such affliction—
even now, not yet cured.
If someone asks me,
this alone is my end.

**Free and Unfettered**
Abiding in harmony, free and unfettered,
preserving life far from worldly clamor.
Befriending gulls, swimming the blue islets,
plucking the zither among fishermen and woodcutters.
A heart unashamed of poverty,
a will unarrogant in honor.
Reeling in the line, forgetting the late catch,
strolling at whim, spring’s joy in full bloom.
Abundance complete, needs met,
abundant blessings, dreams of rivers and clouds.

The Yellow Court dissolves a hundred cares,
purple taro awaits the morning’s end.
Unfettered, the three paths open wide,
whirling winds play in ninefold skies.
Joy flows through the short flute’s notes,
clasped hands return to childhood’s braids.
Favor and reward are no sure ground—
tranquility alone is wealth enough.
Let others wield brush and ink,
I alone thread the void’s vast expanse.
Thus wise, I bathe in Yi’s waters,
shunning noise, I cast off Xu’s gourd.
The hollow ring of the craftsman’s chisel,
blunted edges blend with hay and thatch.
In times of adversity, the harbor knows stillness;
in winter’s cold, the pine’s integrity stands firm.
Ninefold thoughts arise in greeting,
five willows sway in desolate grace.
With spouse, perhaps we tend the bamboo,
returning home, too lazy to bow.
Sweet water from the jar for irrigating beds,
forgetting taste, I delight in Shao’s music.
Scorning gold and jade, I cast off harm,
cultivating virtue to illumine ancestral peaches.
Soaring high, I outpace the qilin,
wings unfurled, I laugh at cranes and pheasants.
Cutting off learning, I wander the Dark Pot,
hymns of praise resound for the sagely court.
Watching geese by the winding pond,
shading deer with withered plantain leaves.
Sealing the senses, dwelling in substance,
deep roots need no hinge or sprout.
To untangle knots, one must speak boldly;
to nurture simplicity, delight in flourishing ease.
Crevices hide in profound secrecy,
like the fool concealing brilliance.
The plain cicada clings to the mulberry,
the pivot and tile deftly ride the tides.
Equalizing things—what obstacle remains?
The world’s bonds can be transcended.
Lamenting the snail’s horned strife,
I sit and watch the crow ascend the paulownia.
Why not join the plowing elder?
How could I stoop to a lowly post?
Listening to the phoenix flute beyond the clouds,
spring’s hues dangle from my staff.
Who releases the wooden kite?
The stringless zither tunes itself.
Returning through empty space at day’s end,
no need to borrow the simurgh’s reins.

The Tortoise Mountain Recluse Longquanzi Writes *Secluded Dwelling*

On the full moon of the first lunar month in the *xīnmǎo* year of the Zhèngdà era, the Tortoise Mountain Recluse Longquanzi fled the chaos of war to the ancient lands of Táng, taking refuge amid the furrows of Bìyáng. His fence was of brushwood, his door of brambles; he wore a paper hat and a robe of woven hemp, dined on simple grain and wild greens, his complexion rough and hoarse—dull as a fool, incomplete in manner, concealing all his affairs.

Adrift as one with no home, restless yet strangely content. Withered by worldly bonds, he sat motionless as a clod of earth, dim and obscure as a wooden colt behind a lattice. After a long while, he lifted his gaze to the heavens, chanted a song, and sighed: *"How blissful is secluded dwelling! How blissful is secluded dwelling!"*

Presently, at his side stood the hermit Kuòránzi Xǔ Ruòhuì of Yǐngchāng, who had shed the world like a cicada’s husk. Rising from his seat, he bowed and asked: *"What do you mean by this?"*

Longquanzi replied: *"Have you not heard the crane cry in the shade, its mate answering in kind? When voices harmonize, when qi seeks its like—those of different Ways cannot counsel one another. Those outside the circle cannot know the language of those beyond the bounds."*

Kuòránzi’s expression darkened with indignation as he answered: *"I have heard that the noble-minded ascend, while the petty-minded descend. Yet you, sir, dwell in seclusion—does this not signify the Dao? Is its principle not most subtle? Or is this merely glib deception? Do you not know the joys of riverside hamlets, the elegance of village life, the profound beauty of mountain retreat?"*

The Recluse, startled, replied: *"Ah! Is this so? Why not expound upon it? Do not conceal its essence."*

Suddenly, he opened his speech with great animation:

*"Now, dwelling by the river keeps one far from the dust of the world and dissolves worldly cares. One chants verses in the desolate riverbanks, lodging one’s pride upon the duckweed isles. Silk is twisted into line, hempen thread into hook; bamboo is carved into rod, grains split into bait—thus does one angle for leviathans in the abyss of a hundred fathoms. The wind upon the water is one’s livelihood, gulls and herons one’s companions. At times, one casts the line from a perilous crag; at others, one drifts mid-stream in eddying turns. The fare is simple—rice porridge and minced fish—while the moon shines on the flute and mist gathers on the straw cloak. When the song of gathering water-chestnuts ends, the oars of orchid-wood beat the maple-lined river; returning with the day’s catch, one furls the net and sails home to the blue islets. Adrift upon the waves, one follows nature’s course, carefree and unhurried—escaping the world, one spends the years along the willow-lined shore. Is this not the joy of the fisherman’s life?*

*Next, the elegance of village life: one’s livelihood is drawn from the fields, from mulberry and hemp. In spring, one plows the green shoots; in autumn, one reaps the bound sheaves. Strolling by bamboo-lined streams, calling out in flowered dells, one leads children to the thatched cottage and pastures chickens and dogs at the wicker gate. Beneath pine shade and mossy paths, woodcutters sing their songs; on sunlit slopes of barren earth, one idly sows melons. A pavilion amid wind-tossed bamboo, surrounded by cloud-wreathed mountains—when the rain clears, the sparse woods ring with birdsong, and the fading green slopes are dotted with cattle and sheep. ‘Return, ah, return! Spring is at its finest,’ and before the village feast, one hears the partridge’s cry. Is this not the purity of the field and cottage, the refinement of rustic dwelling?*

*Thus, to spend one’s old age in mountain retreat holds great delight: threading through clouds and winding along streams, one finds stone paths and forest pavilions. Shutting out the world’s dust, forgetting the burdens of things, one harbors no ambition for wealth and rank, finding joy instead in the pleasures of forests and springs. In layered ravines, one nurtures simplicity; in shallow rapids, one washes one’s cap-strings. The wild heart is at ease, untroubled—beyond, one hears the cries of apes and birds; by the pine streams, one smiles to see deer bearing blossoms in their mouths. The mind rests in unadorned simplicity, content in emptiness and leisure. Opening the door, one finds companions in mist and rosy clouds; crossing the bridge, one walks upon beams of wisteria and cypress. At times, one seeks plum blossoms on the highest peaks; at others, one boils tea by the clear stream. The forest ridges rise in bright and graceful peaks; the grottoes harbor scenes of eternal spring. Towering trees pierce the sky, their branches twisting like azure rainbows; stone blossoms adorn the cliffs, their lichen patterns woven like brocade. Here, one whistles in carefree abandon, forgetting all form—how could this compare to the loneliness of secluded dwelling or the stagnation of silent sitting?*

Longquanzi, hearing this, pushed aside his table and, with a slight shrug, smiled and said: *"The foolish do not yield to the wise, the small do not presume upon the great—this is inauspicious. Without ascending Kunlun, how can one know the height of heaven? Without crossing rivers and seas, how can one know the vastness of water? Alas, the chaff-like masses, the clamorous rabble! They have heard only of Lao Peng’s longevity, yet what do they know of the untimely dead who attain venerable age? They see only that a cartload of firewood is as light as a feather, yet fail to see that the tip of an autumn hair outweighs Mount Tai. The universe is but a finger’s breadth; the ten thousand things are but a single horse. Great and small, much and little, long and short, wide and narrow—all reside within the self. Nobility and baseness, success and failure—what have they to do with external things?"*

Kuòránzi, startled, exclaimed: *"This deepens my understanding even more! Ah, this harried youth, though lacking the rites of washing and grooming, the decorum of sweeping and tidying, still wishes to receive your teaching—‘to hear it in the morning and die by evening would be enough.’"* With this, he followed closely, bowing deeply, and prostrated himself twice to request instruction.

The Recluse said: *"Return to your seat. I shall instruct you."*

Then, stirred to sudden inspiration, he responded in form and word—his voice flowing forth like a clear cough, scattering fragrance as wood shavings fall from the plane, abundant and brimming as the surging waves of a vast, dark sea. From the pure wellspring of truth it welled naturally, the essence of reclusive dwelling.

Such a one neither chases after wealth and rank nor grieves over poverty and lowliness; neither delights in long life nor mourns an early death. Clad in coarse silk, he knows the warmth of fox-fur and brocade; eating plain beans, he savors the taste of rice, orchids, and citrus. Sheltered in a thatched hut, he enjoys the shade of towering halls; riding a simple carriage, he bears the adornment of a four-horse chariot. He does not hoard the world’s gains as his own private share, nor does he seek glory in ruling all under heaven. Advancing, he does not court the marketplace, laughing at Zhang Yi’s ruin by desire; retreating, he does not flee to the hills, lamenting Shan Bao’s fate at the jaws of a starving tiger.

Only then may one explore the hidden depths of reclusive dwelling, wander the gates of tranquility, transcend the world’s snares, and cast off human entanglements—coming and going without constraint, acting or resting at will. Now resting in a pine pavilion, now roaming the outskirts; now sipping fine wine to the sound of zither music, now ascending a terrace with a flowering staff. Sweeping moss from the courtyard, planting peach and plum along the garden paths. Strolling across open plains, passing idle days in leisure; lingering by small streams, filling quiet moments with the vastness of heaven and earth.

Freed from the shackles of profit and fame, one faces the wind and moon in carefree ease. The place is secluded, with no visiting guests; the gate stands empty, without rites of welcome or farewell. Clothes and cap worn as one pleases, sleep comes with dreams of a quiet window; books and sword lie neglected, as one turns to gaze at white clouds stretching a thousand miles. Spring excursions and autumn delights, summer coolness and winter warmth—building a snail’s hut in the forest thicket, erecting a bare-walled dwelling in the wilds. Brush and ink gather dust, dissolving ten thousand cares; the wind and the poets’ verses lie scattered, veiled by the mist of the three isles.

At such a time, one drifts away in pure simplicity, ashamed to be entangled in worldly affairs; standing at the root of being, wisdom shines clear as the heavens. Thus one hides the mountain in the marsh, the boat in the ravine, the world within the world—yet pursues nothing, roaming beyond the ten thousand transformations, in the land of *wuheyou*, the boundless wilds. Let Zhe Yi dare not speak of the joy of knocking on the fisherman’s oar; let Zi Zhen dare not speak of the pleasures of tilling at Valley Mouth; let Hong Jing’s sworn covenant dare not speak of the seclusion of Zhongnan’s Juqu.

Those who draw near to me are Beigong Zi; those who befriend me are Huang Dayuan; those who meet me are Pei Du; those who know me are Yuanming; those who honor me are Wei Qiong; those who summon me are Xu Mian. Facing fine days and beautiful scenes, at ease in a humble abode—unburdened and carefree, staff in hand, sandals on feet—one gazes at fish by the pond, listens to birds in the forest. Seizing a few fleeting moments of joy, content in simplicity, one washes away the dust of the mind, opening and closing the gates of heaven. Neither riding the wind in the gardens of Zheng nor dreaming of butterflies in the gardens of Qi. Pillow high in the southern window, yielding to the earth in self-possession.

Body at ease, untroubled; heart empty, unhurried; mind vacant, unthinking; spirit obscure, unknowing; *qi* joyful, without striving. Serene and still, in harmony beyond measure, soaring above the nine abysses, forgetting all answers to the four questions. Like drifting duckweed, like swaying reeds—unfettered and vast, attaining the great mystery, the supreme perfection, the utmost refinement, the ultimate extremity. Such is the principle of reclusive leisure.

Kuòránzi, hearing this, clasped it to his heart with earnest devotion, bowing his head in gratitude, and withdrew in reverent awe. Soaring freely—ah, soaring freely in spirit, he met the profound and obscure, observing the Dao’s equality of all things. Discerning the signs of illusion’s beginning, awakening to the great smelting of yin and yang, exhausting the barriers of creation, penetrating the dense thickets of superiority and inferiority.

Thus one may advance when it is time to advance, retreat when it is time to retreat, soar when it is time to soar, alight when it is time to alight. Above, one reaches the heavens; below, one coils upon the earth. Spirit extends in four directions, sighing at the ten thousand beings, roaming boundless and strange realms, flying beyond all boundaries. Grasping wind and clutching moon, lingering in the spring of Guye; lying on grass and swallowing blossoms, circling the wilds of Dongting. Nurturing truth without adornment, dancing with lotus and hibiscus. Drinking the divine mist from the rice steamer, feasting on morning radiance from the round jade. Sustained by the dew of the Milky Way, borne aloft by the whirlwind’s embrace. Crossing the waters of Peach Blossom Spring to arrive, passing the crimson walls of Red City to depart. Soaring high beyond the bounds of the three realms, flapping wings beyond the nine heavens. Rain clears and sun warms—appearing and vanishing with light ease; wind stills and mist fades—moving freely in graceful disarray.

Unbound by decay, too lazy to keep company with crows perched on withered branches—east and west, up and down, drifting with nature’s current. Treading the vast emptiness, one drifts in blissful contentment.

Alas! In this shallow age, the common crowd is dazzled and indolent, like butterflies flitting in confusion, chasing red and seeking green. The fleeting beauty of things—here they lightly flit through willow lanes, play with shadows in flowered streets. The spirit of plum and the soul of orchid—beware lest they sink into infatuation; powdered wings and fragrant feelers—beware the pursuit of attachment. Wandering through scenes of splendor, surveying the sights—grieving at spring’s dawn, lingering in the golden chambers of blossoms; dabbing powder and stealing fragrance, lodging together in silken curtains. Wild hearts scattered and disordered, seduced by vulgar beauty, swaying with the wind beneath the leaves, chasing after the riches of the branches.

Dream-souls muddied and overflowing, never escaping the veil of delusion; root-nature like the toad in the navel, ultimately unable to transcend the stench of decay. Yet the perfected one is not so. Suddenly awakening, steadily penetrating—riding the light before the dawn of doubt, fulfilling one’s will at the beginning of the boundless. Commanding the myriad wonders, sweeping away the eight impurities; in motion, not following the transformations of things; in stillness, unaware of the one who governs existence. Embracing the universe, vast and minute alike, wielding the luminous clarity of spirit, relying on purity and simplicity.

To cease the carving of caskets, weaving through past and present, savoring the vast and tranquil—blood and pulse dissolve into emptiness and nothingness. Such is to know the primal act and its purpose, to grasp the unso and its so. Within the realm of silence and stillness, the chirp of a tiny insect resounds like thunder; in the land of obscurity and boundlessness, the tip of an autumn hair looms like Mount Tai. Deeper still, more profound, more spiritually refined—beyond this, even the most skilled reckoner cannot fathom, let alone the common mind.

Consider those who awaited celestial omens: the Li clan; the dream-weaver of Nanhua; Cui the Wild Moth; Zhou Fang with his unrolled scrolls; Wang Zhuo, who spoke in verse; the most admirable, Master Zhang; Lu Guimeng, who knew the metamorphosis of the orange; and Changquanzi, who mimicked madness in vain imitation. Yet these are but the fringes—exhausted, they come to an end.

**Reclusion**
Return, ah return! Bowing to clumsiness, feigning foolishness. No need to open the three paths, nor drift upon the five lakes. Dwelling in a crooked hollow, residing in a chink of the wall. My life has its limits—time slips away, unmeasured. Endless striving, ceaseless toil. Neither do I gather ferns, nor must I wash my ears. Without intent, I emerge from the mountain’s cave to inscribe a bridge; weary of soaring through the clouds, I advance in humble sandals. Now on South Mountain, now by the waters of Pu. Delighting in the return to mugwort and thatch, offering a seat to ants and maggots. Some concealed their traces on Su Gate, some purified themselves in the Wine Spring. Though their forms may fade, their fragrance lingers. Unfit for court and temple, they lightly cast aside tattered crowns. Lofty in resolve and integrity, they whistle and wander amidst clouds and mist. Clad in coarse cloth yet holding jade within, they rest on stone by the abyss. Still, they scorn the six seals of the swan’s feather, the thousand goblets of the snail’s horn. Roaming beyond the dust and grime, carefree within heaven and earth. Valleys deep and peaks steadfast, willows by the gate and pines in the courtyard. Seven bowls of fine tea, a mat of pure wind. Stretching and bending beneath the moonlit stream’s misty radiance, exhaling to stir the primordial chaos with the Cloud Lord. Clad in kudzu cap and feather fan, staff adorned with deer-dust and speckled bamboo. Ancient plans among the forests and peaks, profound depths of Dao and virtue. At ease in boundless expanse, leisurely in open heart. Dwelling beyond the world’s edge, gazing upon emptiness and stillness. Forgetting sorrow in the fisherman’s song and woodcutter’s chant, wandering in sandals through mountain hamlets and marshlands. Crane companions and ape friends, pure and clear; solitary in stillness, silent in return. Distant from markets and courts, content and self-sufficient; blocking the brushwood gate, serene and self-possessed. Able to dismiss the four and reflect on the three, never daring to advance an inch or retreat a foot.

Thus it is said: Yu Jun, who carved the obscure; Ma Ji, who knew the true sound. Sighing deeply, Liang Xian found no spectacle; whistling long, Ruan Ji rejoiced all the more.

Enough! **Reclusion, reclusion**—hiding the self in secrecy. Veiled and foolish, without expectation, without insistence. Ah! Let the black-haired masses chase the floating clouds—how can they compare to my return, where earth is thick and the lotus blooms?

**Vastness**
Who recognizes the guest of the great curve’s wholeness, roaming boundless east and west, south and north? A square inch carved open reveals the Five Thousand Characters; a single word encompasses the Three Hundred Poems. Seizing the wind, driving the roc’s wings, the eight wastes and four extremes become mere paths. Fermenting the vastness, stirring limitless brew—stars and constellations fill the flask, yet all remains at ease. The lion’s roar, the flying spring’s sip—with a single sweep, demons vanish and ghosts weep. Last night, wine-sodden, phoenix and simurgh perched upon the terrace; the vastness of the cosmos seemed too narrow for my unbounded heart. Crossing Kunlun’s peaks, traversing with a long flute—lake light and moon drench the white of the stream’s moss. Stone locks green, the crane has not come; wild apes cry in vain at the jade-green lotus peak. Fragrant lingzhi, blossoming jasper—scent drifts, dew heavy, pearls drip. A thousand ages’ heroes are but a cellar of dust; the five-cloud towers and pavilions are the immortals’ abodes.

Return to Red City, where spring is in full bloom—cease casting the silk line upon the misty waves.

**Entering the Dao**
To enter the gate of the Mysterious, one must know its path.

Rejecting ostentation, casting aside wife and children,
Washing clean affection and love, purging perverse attachments.
Embracing softness and poverty, forgetting arrogance and extravagance,
Discussing yin and yang, encompassing the warp and weft of the cosmos.
Harmonizing east and west, balancing li and gui,
Each thread and grain of rice revives a sense of shame.
The body like a solitary cloud, the heart like autumn waters,
Secluded among forests and springs, moving unseen among the dust of the world.
Delighting in a simple gourd and bowl, ever cautious from beginning to end,
Neither drawn to wealth nor rank, nor stirred by enmity.
Inwardly embracing emptiness, outwardly severing all that is false,
Swiftly relinquishing the human realm, fully versed in the Mysterious Principle.
Silent and vast, pure and unadorned,
Refining the body and clarifying the spirit, transcending the mundane.
Surveying the true immortals, they stand apart from this.
All things are manifest, yet only the stubborn remain base.
The Dao does not exalt humanity—it blends its light with the common.
Words as firm as metal and stone, virtue fragrant and ever more beautiful.
Gathering from the multitude of scriptures, scraping away flaws and blemishes,
Diligently studying the myriad methods, the numinous root and jade elixir.
The cinnabar gates and jade palaces require no labor to attain.
Alas, alas! The scholars of this age—
Donning hempen topknots and Daoist robes, nothing more.
What have they truly studied in the classics? How could they know the Way?
One day they leave the household, and deem themselves enlightened;
A lifetime they wander, yet their nature remains restless and unrefined.
Grasping at gluttony, harming others for personal gain—
With such cultivation of the truth, upon what can they rely?
The drifting masses—who among them can be truly discerning?
Heed these words carefully, lest you stray further.
Be vigilant in this, and your pure name shall remain unblemished.

**Ascending the Hall to Address the Assembly**
The supreme virtue is vast and formless, the wondrous Dao subtle and silent,
Existing before earth and heaven, unbound by written words.
Radiant and empty, pervading the ten directions,
Pure, numinous, and unobstructed, circulating through the three realms.
A thousand transformations, ten thousand changes, governing yin and yang,
Its essence and function eternally true—boundless and inexhaustible.
Yet how can the common multitude, burdened by heavy obstructions, bear such a burden?
They scorn the ancient and exalt the present, vainly generating false views,
Chattering about the Dharma and engaging in meditation, opening side doors and windows.
Thus the primordial simplicity of the Great Ultimate scatters, and teachings branch into three schools.
Amid the field of discriminating thought, they cannot return to the source.
Behold these people—how deeply they merit compassion.
Therefore, the gates of expedient means are flung wide, and the compassionate vessel set afloat,
Universally rescuing sentient beings from the苦海, liberating them from the six realms of rebirth.
Guiding them back to the true path, restoring them to the primal chaos.
Carving open a tranquil and joyous gateway, roaming the Crimson Towers of the Pure Capital.
Upon the Five Clouds Terrace, the mysterious pearl of the millet is clearly transmitted;
By the Nine Luminaries Pavilion, the luminous treasure sword is raised high.
Unfettered across the boundless expanse, unconstrained and free,
Moving and resting without action, merging into pure simplicity.
Thus one may sweep away the neither-dead-nor-alive, the neither-excess-nor-lack,
Dispelling both sage and mortal, embracing emptiness and form alike.
Even if the clay ox bellows at the moon, the wooden horse neighs at the wind,
Or the leaking bucket’s mechanism is set in motion—these are but the master’s jest.
In the blazing words of the moment, within the silent radiance,
Shatter the golden-maned lion.
The five petals gather, the three mysteries are brushed aside,
The original hammer of the Primordial is wielded freely.
Manifesting the formless, dwelling idly in the garden of Zheng,
Already there are Zhuangzi and Liezi.
Yet how is it that scholars abandon the host to cling to guests,
Neglecting the profound emptiness, wasting straw sandals in vain pursuit?
What are they seeking? The stone lion’s heart and liver are gouged out,
The wild fox’s drool soaks to the bone marrow.
If one were to practice in this manner, how could a noble person guide them?
Now, I casually cast the medicine of the Dharma into the world,
Offering this brew to nourish the superior ones.
I raise the fundamental livelihood of our original nature, examining the face before us.
Revealing a hint of this message, I entrust it to those who understand—
What tune is this family tradition playing?
A music beyond the standard pitches, a spring beyond the kalpas,
A zither played without strings, a flute sounding the music of heaven.
No need for golden needles and jade threads to embroider the rainbow robes of the phoenix.
If one comprehends this, they may return at once,
Ascending the unending towers, joining the refined gathering.
Drawing water with a bottomless basket, making the rootless iron tree bloom—
What is the model for this transmission?
Beyond the primordial chaos, no negotiation is permitted;
Before the Spirit Treasure Peak, who can set foot?
One must be utterly unencumbered, no longer entangled in confusion.
Suddenly awakening to the Mysterious Wind, roaming the cosmos,
Long cherishing the company of immortal guests—may you treasure this.

**Tea**
I have heard that with a single thunderous roar,
The finest fragrance is exhaled;
Phoenix cakes and dragon rounds manifest the rarest of true substances.
Nurtured by yin and yang, suffused with the vapors of heaven and earth,
Endowed with the vital qi of the four seasons, seizing the purest flavor of the five phases.
In the gardens before spring, born as precious jade flakes;
Before the auspicious snows of Kunlun, wrought into the numinous sprouts of the elixir.
Gathered by jade maidens, its wondrous use follows the seasons.
When ground in the golden mortar, its fragrant dust delights the nose.
When brewed in the stone cauldron, jade blossoms surge like waves.
Lu Tong’s seven bowls wash away the stupor of the six desires;
The three pinches of the venerable elder purge the turbid dreams of all beings.
Those who love it find their spirits refreshed; those who comprehend it find their hearts purified.
Do not say this is merely the custom of immortals—it is truly the sustenance of Daoists.
I offer this single taste to all,
May you return content—treasure this well.

**The Golden Lotus Assembly at Changchun Abbey in Tangzhou**
It is said that families who accumulate goodness will surely enjoy abundant blessings,
While those who harm living things will inevitably invite deep misfortune.
Dwelling within heaven and earth, one must understand the causes of fortune and calamity.
Thus it is said: Heaven has no favorites, it aids only those with virtue.
Retribution follows as swiftly as an echo or shadow, never erring.
Do not dismiss small good deeds as inconsequential, nor belittle minor virtues as unrewarded.
What begins as a trifle, over years, accumulates into mountains.
When disaster strikes, regret comes too late.
Therefore, the noble person, perceiving the outward, understands the inward;
Observing the past, they foresee the future.
Diligent and earnest, humble and compassionate, they pass their days,
Upholding simplicity while bestowing generously, perpetuating the path of goodness.
Alas! The common people’s transgressions blot out the sky,
Turning from enlightenment to embrace the dust, never considering purification.
Losing themselves in things, forfeiting their nature to worldly customs.

Amidst restless fragmentation and scattered chaos, with myriad anxieties clouding the mind like turbid waters, one drifts helplessly through the labyrinth of delusion, unable to return to the root. Beholding the state of the multitudes, how can one not grieve?

Yet our Patriarch Chongyang, the Universally Transforming Perfected One, flung wide the gate of expedient means, broadly expounding the profound principles of the Primordial Origin. He guided the common stream of mortals to wander anew the jadelike path—this is the sacred cause, the joyous assembly of the Golden Lotus.

What does this signify? Gold is the foundation of nature; the lotus, the stem of life. Scattered, it becomes ten thousand vessels; gathered, it returns to one gold. Forged in the great crucible, refined a hundred times, it grows ever purer. Though great in constancy and small in variation, it serves the needs of all beings, each according to their desire. The flower unfolds its five petals, exhaling fragrant winds; it stands peerless among blossoms, its fragrance unmatched. Its brocade banners and crimson adornments rival the craft of creation; its green canopy and golden heart deeply grasp the subtleties of yin and yang. Rippling upon the water’s surface, its elegant rhythm endures like a long hairpin; beneath moon and sun, it paints the isles of Penglai with resplendent hues. Those who awaken to it may keep company with sages; those who uphold it are sustained by virtue and power. Resting in the mysterious pass, one remains free from fault throughout life.

**Rhapsody on Leisure and Tranquility**
In an age of murky love and defilement, who cherishes clarity? While others entangle themselves in a thousand cares, I alone pass my days in idleness. Breaking free from the shackles of calamity, I dwell ever in peace; escaping the snares of flies and gnats, I fully awaken to luminous clarity. Thus, I have severed worldly fetters and mastered the subtle net of the Dao. Roaming the boundless Great Clarity, I deepen my roots and secure my stem; abiding in tranquil serenity, I delight in long life and enduring vision. Having grasped this principle, the mind becomes as limpid as autumn waters; in all movements, it is as wondrous as the arising of spring winds.

Standing solitary and resolute, profound and still, it is sharp yet not cutting—like a mirror distinguishing beauty from ugliness; radiant yet impartial—like the moon illuminating heaven and earth. Upright in nature, at ease in the six senses, lofty and pure in the wellspring of spirit, its integrity is like the pine and bamboo. Vast and unobstructed in the Dharma realm, it is the pure and simple mysterious gate. Thus, the body soars like a solitary cloud, the heart transcends like a wild crane. In subtlety, it conceals mountains within marshes; in freedom from thought, it hides the boat in the ravine. Clear and penetrating, it roams the boundless expanse. Unburdened by the slightest attachment, the spirit soars in the wanderings of Mount Gushe; self and other forgotten, it treads the vastness of the empty sky.

This is no privilege of the sage alone but the doing of the practitioner. If one has not relinquished fame and profit, how can one awaken to the subtle and formless? As the *Nanhua* says of the great sage’s leisure, and as Confucius spoke of the petty person’s anxiety—those who preach Chan while mired in desire, who expound wonders while burdened by family, may earn the veneration of fools but cannot escape the ridicule of the wise. One must cultivate merit in purity, turn inward, and reflect in stillness. As Laozi’s teaching holds: attain utmost emptiness and firmly guard tranquility; as Yan Hui’s essential practice: nourish the limbs and abandon cleverness.

Thus, when mind and method both dissolve, life and death are both relinquished. Through pure cultivation, the fruit of the Dao is perfected; through awakening to emptiness and leisure, the mysterious heaven is pierced. From this, one abruptly casts off the causes of leakage and desolation pervades the cosmos; deeply resting in the cave of non-action, one whistles freely amidst clouds and mist.

How lamentable! The ant toils for its meal, the moth sacrifices its life for the flame. Who, adrift in the bitter realms of suffering, would strive to perfect their virtue? Ah, better to heed the call early, delight in leisure, and return to the Mysterious Capital to pay homage to the Supreme Sage.

**Rhapsody on the Mysterious**
Vast is the origin of doubt, wondrous the profound mystery. I briefly express the aspiration for purity and emptiness, momentarily declaring the subtle and marvelous. Carving open the gate of simplicity, the divine mechanism remains unfathomable; bursting forth the luminous essence, its wondrous use is manifest.

Only when upright is one free from deviation; only when penetrating is there no need for discourse. It does not lie in verbal sparring or hand gestures and oral instructions. The Three Clarities’ mysterious teaching cannot be grasped through clever debate; the single flavor of fermentation does not arise from heroic excellence. For those who awaken, it is inherently present, attained through innate clarity. It does not depend on performing deeds or seated meditation but first requires dispelling desire and forgetting emotion. These subtle workings are scarcely extraordinary.

Within the pot lies the unending day of heaven—most honored, most noble; beyond the world stretches the everlasting spring—truly refined, truly pure. Yet the ignorant and deluded, scattered and lost, cling to a thousand scriptures and ten thousand treatises, embracing the One amid the Five Phases and Two Modes. Though they generate knowledge and perception, they remain fundamentally ignorant of the numinous void; though they distinguish sage from mortal, they never reach true stillness. Today, they cling to peripheral details, abandoning the subtle and formless—like rejoicing in dreamt wealth or sating hunger with painted cakes. The wise craftsman smiles in secret; how would the deluded know?

Grasping the wind of profound tranquility, one attains wonder within wonder; responding to the principle of quiescence illuminating form and emptiness, one acts through non-action. Thus, the true immortals recognize the enlightened. Clad in hemp robes and paper jackets, their hearts hold the celestial mechanism and mysterious principle. Simple, unadorned, pure, and immaculate—within them, heaven and earth, virtue and power are fully contained; sages, worthies, and immortals all attain realization through this. Thus, one ascends the ladder beyond the world, transcending the norms of the mundane. Rolled up, it does not fill a fist; unfurled, it deeply pervades the eight directions. Neither dull nor silent, it transcends yin and yang. From this, one abandons learning and forgets speech, the moon shining above the azure sky; attains emptiness and nurtures vastness, clouds idling beside green peaks.

Alas! The solitary deluded ones rush about in worldly affairs, unwilling to return to purity, blind to the obscure and indistinct. How sorrowful! Who knows the profound mechanism of the Great Dao, where every movement is bound to external things?

**Rhapsody on the Golden Elixir**
The secret formula of the Great Dao is rarely known to learners. A single grain of the Golden Elixir is most precious; the two silver trees are difficult to sustain. Sever ties with the entanglements of right and wrong, fame and profit—externally, this clarifies gains and losses; abandon the realms of wine, sex, anger, and wealth—internally, this strengthens the root and foundation.

How could it not be that tranquility and stillness serve as the origin, yin and yang as the ancestors? Gathering the marrow of the myriad dharmas and sages, seizing the wind and rain of the eight directions and the cosmos. Listening as the thunder of *jia-yi* first erupts, fire nurturing the tortoise and serpent; awaiting the tide of *gui-ren*’s Kan-water, the crucible boiling the dragon and tiger. At that moment, the Jade Maiden rides the phoenix, the Golden Elder mounts the ox. Planting the Yellow Sprout, it roars at the earthly gate; spreading the radiant clouds, they coil afar upon the celestial tower. Thus, the four corners fill with mist, the five peaks gather their clouds. Behold the Azure Youth, crowned with spring orchids, planting mushrooms by the pool; rejoice in the Crimson Child, draped in plain silk, locking the wild monkey in the cabinet. It must be when the crow and hare converge in their palaces, the Milky Way revolves. The Vermilion Bird rests quietly in the fragrant chamber, the Dark Warrior drunkenly slumbers in the clouded hall. Jade terraces rise in mist, the chaos in the sea ascends in transformation; the crimson watchtower deepens in spring, the orioles within the willows first trill their songs. Truly, the secret formula is hard to transmit—profound, yet ever more profound. The ice-wheel gleams bright as Chang’e pounds her elixir; the brocade sail sways gracefully as the immortal maidens steer their boat. In the cinnabar clouds of the cave, horses are seized; on Mount Taibai, the flying spring cascades. Among the clouds, the purple cassia blooms, transforming into jade-like herbs; within the furnace, the green pine bears fruit, transmuting into golden coins. The subtle parrot returns to its nest, the mandarin ducks settle their pillows. Auspicious mists drift, adorning cultural splendor; sweet dew descends, ripening the fields of magic mushrooms. Clear notes resound—cranes sing the zither of the nine luminaries; emerald hues shimmer—cocks spar with the brocade of the seven stars. From this, swords and halberds vanish from the groves, the sun soars to the vast cold palace. Refining cinnabar and mercury into numinous treasures, using wood and metal to forge the true altar. Assembling a thousand spirits in the Hall of Three Blossoms, they return together to the Holy Mother; gathering the ten thousand phenomena in the Palace of the Six Dings, all enter the mud-pill. How splendid! Attaining this Golden Elixir, one instantly transcends the mundane world. Riding the green phoenix, one bids farewell to the Middle Kingdom; following the purple decree, one swiftly ascends to the court of the Supreme Emperor. Clothed in jade pendants and rainbow robes, fed with peaches of immortality and cinnamon elixirs. Joyfully roaming forever in the Mystic Capital, one enjoys eternal life and boundless existence.

**Rhapsody on the Eightfold Chan**
Teaching has sudden and gradual paths, Chan knows no before or after. Those who are deluded remain distant beyond kalpas; those who awaken perceive it here and now. Neither coming nor going, moving through the six supernormal powers with ease; neither arising nor ceasing, transcending the three realms in solitary perfection.

**First: Brushing the Edge**
Fear neither clamor nor disturbance, nor dwell in carefree detachment. Those who divide the gate into five schools forcibly fabricate knowledge and views; those who elevate the One Vehicle still fall into emptiness. Simply reveal constantly, release everything. A thousand paths of cool wind—between the pines, the stone maiden sings; three poles of bright moon—on the ridge, the shepherd boy plucks water chestnuts.

**Second: Dharma’s Function**
Wisdom is innate, spiritual clarity suddenly opens. Responding to circumstances, one must manifest inherent nature; facing conditions, one must still the heart. Harmonizing the four images, penetrating the three talents. Green waters flow endlessly, allowing life and death to arise and cease; green mountains remain unmoved, letting clouds come and go.

**Fourth: True Emptiness**
Everlasting from ancient times to the present, neither decaying nor perishing. Those who are deluded cling to sounds and forms; those who are enlightened transcend into nothingness. Sweeping away wind and clouds, rubbing the stars and constellations. The zither’s melody is exquisite—the wooden horse in the hall roars; the snow’s tune is rare—the jade dragon in the sea flies and runs.

**Fifth: Universal Illumination**
Do not seek the Bodhisattva of the southeast, nor search for Amitābha of the northwest. Wherever the eye falls is the dharma-realm—what place is not Chan? Realizing this, one is truly capable. Dwelling in the dust yet beyond it, how could one fall into the illusions of the ten thousand conditions? In desire yet free from desire, one does not sink into the demons of the six thieves.

**Sixth: Receiving Beings**
Encountering the source from all sides, stillness and illumination return to simplicity. Those who cling to old vines and hags trade bones for a thousand kalpas; those who point directly to the spiritual source utter a single phrase of absolute learning. Freely seizing or releasing, uniquely transcendent. White clouds and green peaks—everywhere is thusness; emerald bamboos and yellow flowers—all things are perfect awakening.

**Seventh: Perfect Completion**
Utterly without attachment, encompassing the great thousand worlds. Those who hold up a flower to the assembly truly overthink; those who scold the Buddha and revile the ancestors still err. Who understands the step forward? The lotus blooms in the Deer Park. □ □ returns—the moon fills the riverboat. Lifting forth one’s own house style, one instantly transcends the ten grounds; trampling the stubborn emptiness of dreams, one uniquely delights in the heavens.

**Eighth: Dissolving Deceit**
All is empty vanity—how dare one contend for worth? Those who compare dregs know not true flavor; those who drill into koans grasp not the wondrous principle. A hair’s breadth of difference leads one a thousand miles astray. The wooden man says: If you wish to know this "coming from the west," you must drink the marrow of the Nirvāṇa Golden Immortal.

**Rhapsody on the Perfected and True**
The divine and sagely bestow their decrees, benevolence universally equal.

Having grandly propagated the Mysterious Teachings, we now reverently uphold the Perfect and True. Who knows that the loftiest immortals of the Ten Poles descend to wander this world? The ancient Way of the Three Sovereigns is broadly expounded, harmoniously transforming all people. Rooted in virtue that pervades all schools, the heart returns to the One Correctness. Those who leave the secular world part from kin and sever love; those who embrace poverty delight in heaven and know destiny. Thus the Perfect and True: study and cultivate nature. Fame, wealth, and sensuality are seen as floating pivots upon water; wisdom and spiritual penetration shine as brightly as the ancient sages of the teachings. Truly, in learning one must not be attached, in seeking the Dharma one must attain great penetration. Broadly accumulating virtuous conduct, one outwardly extends expedient means; deeply engaging in cultivation, one inwardly circulates divine power. Skillfully abiding in non-action and non-duality, one can seek the Way of unity and resonance. Each thing distinct and clear, gleaming like the bright moon in a deep pool; every response manifest, moving like the pure wind over grass. Surely, regardless of high or low, all are uplifted. Those who study have cause and effect; those who attain know neither birth nor extinction. Utmost stillness, utmost harmony, utmost integrity, utmost purity. Uniting all virtues to interact with beings, never forsaking compassion; propagating the Three Teachings to dispel delusion, ever revering the wise and sagely. Generally, begging for food brings no shame, utmost poverty no sorrow. Repaying one’s own kindness to others, one bestows grace upon the orphaned and aged; lofty aspirations and unyielding integrity, one lodges pride in kings and lords. These are called the heroic knights of the Perfect and True, the immortal currents who attain the Dao. Suddenly awakening to the celestial mechanism, loftily spreading the Mysterious Wind and roaming the sacred realms; broadly casting fragrant bait, universally seeking wise companions to journey to Penglai Isle. Thus, seeing things one clarifies the mind, knowing emptiness one awakens to the Dao. Practicing the orthodox Dharma of the Perfect and True, one strictly follows Zhong and Lü; grasping the profound principles of the Great Dao, one solemnly reveres the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. In clarity and tranquility, within the red furnace refine silver threads; in purity and subtlety, within the cinnabar tripod concoct the Great Treasure. Fully expressing renunciation, that false compound, one attains spontaneity. Realizing the wondrous within the wondrous of true appearance, obtaining the perfection within the perfection of true power. Five silver mists of the Dao pierce the Dipper; one wheel of the red sun illuminates the heavens. Crane-drawn chariots bearing golden script ascend to the Nine Yang Palace; peaches of immortality and jade nectar seat one at the banquet of the Ten Thousand Sages. Alas, there are those foolishly deluded, contending over self and others. Those who propagate strange and monstrous things do not comprehend the mysterious and wondrous; those who deceive and bewilder the middling and inferior know not cause and effect. Though they escape the fiery household and the mountain of恩, they enter the shackles of fame and the fetters of profit.

O how lamentable! If one wishes to know the true essence of the Perfect and True, one must suddenly comprehend the emptiness that suffices.

Office does not surpass immortality.
People have far-sightedness, hearts no near worries.
Though one may hold office and attain eminence, it does not compare to the carefree wandering of immortals.
Let them be ranked in the court with golden seals and purple cords—
how can this compare to ascending the Gardens of Hearing, the moonlit palaces and starry towers?
I have heard that the enlightened resign from office, while fools seek official emolument.
When Zhang Liang returned to the mountains, he was utterly free from harm;
when Fan Li took to his boat, he avoided execution.
Knowing this Dao, why seek the floating fame of office?
For what truly benefits the self, nothing compares to the pure blessings of immortality.
When power reaches the highest rank and fame resounds in all directions,
those who enrich wives and indulge children merely covet fat salaries;
those who deceive the public and oppress subordinates fear no deep calamity.
Only deluded by the fiery household, they do not awaken to the immortal realm.
Palaces crumble, honor fades—having created karma, they ultimately return to the underworld;
coarse hemp and humble rags—having realized truth, they hasten to Penglai.
How can this compare to golden elixir and immortal peaches, blossoms bright as clouds and brocade?
Subduing dragons and taming tigers, they dwell in the halls of the Five Elders;
embracing the moon and sleeping in clouds, their pillows are the Seven Stars.
Wholly devoted to non-action beyond the world, they do not love the highest ranks of the court.
In the world, jade hairpins and vermilion shoes are but a dream, floating splendor;
within the gourd, purple cassia and the fields of magic mushrooms flourish for ten thousand years.
The palaces of Qin and the gardens of Han are now white poplars and fragrant grasses;
alas, the old city of Chengdu is but peach blossoms and azaleas.
What use are heaps of money and treasure? What firmness is there in nest-like wives and children?
Even as a worthy minister, one cannot compare to the ranks of immortals.
Have you not seen Chan the Minister, who abandoned office, awakened to the utmost truth, and forgot the world?
Or Prince Siddhartha, who relinquished his kingdom, realized supreme enlightenment, and returned to heaven?
Moreover, those who gain wealth and honor through injustice—how are they different from floating clouds?
Those who obtain profit and emolument through disloyalty—are they not like worn-out shoes?
Even if one attains both ministerial and noble rank, it does not compare to the unique beauty of immortals.
Thus Li Si was defiled and humiliated, meeting the white blade at Yunyang;
while the Yellow Emperor, spiritually penetrating, obtained the Mysterious Pearl at the Red Waters.
This fully demonstrates escaping the worldly net and realizing the immortal lineage.
Sweeping mist and rosy clouds from the Dipper’s mouth, suspending sun and moon from the Star Bridge.
From this, abandoning the limited pride and extravagance of the human realm, the feasts and pleasures of the vermilion steps;
attaining the boundless blessings and benefits of heaven, the carefree wandering of the Purple Palace.
Yet how can one be so deluded by the immortal capital as to covet official rank?
Those who cling to it all suffer imprisonment; those who cast it off avoid sinking into ditches.
Even the splendor of Golden Valley cannot compare to the joy of Peach Blossom Spring.
I urge the people of the world: hear early and learn to be heavenly immortals, return to pay homage to the Three Pure Ones and keep the appointment.

The Bitter Sea—
Vast and bitter sea, surging love river.
Regardless of worthiness or foolishness, all sink and drown; regardless of nobility or baseness, all waste away.
From ancient times to the present, who suddenly casts off the waves of desire?
The most exalted and the noble all perish in the waves of恩.
Recall the ancient purity of the Yellow Emperor, the clarity and emptiness of Laozi.
The Five Constants of Confucius’ utmost virtue, the wondrous principles of Śākyamuni’s Three Vehicles.
Raising high the mast of the Dharma boat, universally rescuing the virtuous.
The Four Sagely Ones of compassion leave behind the mysterious formula to escape the bitter sea;
the turbid and overflowing passions of the multitude willingly drown in the foul waters of the deluded ford.
Yet people drift endlessly, entangled without cease.
Some let their minds wander and float away; some follow the world and sink into the current.
Bogged down in the waves of emotion, mired in the caves of karma, sorrowful.
Coming and going, swift as fish, a hundred years submerged;
moving and turning, slow as turtles, ten thousand ages submerged.

Amidst the vast and murky depths, the bends and eddies stretch endlessly.
Those who cling to them meet with calamity and hardship; those who depart know neither birth nor death.
The wise, the benevolent, the noble, the virtuous—once they set their hands to the task, they forget all else;
the dull, the foolish, the deluded, the lost—these remain entangled for life.
Consider the countless beings drowning in the whirlpools of suffering:
to the deluded, it is called the bitter sea; to the awakened, it is but Penglai and Yingzhou.
The boundless expanse of ten thousand acres of surging waves drowns only the benighted;
the fathomless thousand-span towering billows cannot defile the luminous and clear.
If one dallies thus in idle play, when shall one ever cross to the other shore?
Unless one reaches the shores of the pure shallows, one can scarcely avoid the dark paths of the Yellow Springs.

Behold the worthy Fan Li, who rode a small boat to ascend to the realm of truth;
the enlightened Zhang Qian, who drifted upon the sacred stake and found his encounter.
I exhort the common folk: turn back, do not wander further.
Emulate the feathered immortals of Yingzhou; do not become withered skeletons in the bitter sea.
Thus may you gather mist and rosy clouds in your sleeves and recline high in the green mountains and jade grottoes;
hoist the sun and moon upon your staff and ascend in delight to the sacred isles of the other shore.

Alas! Lightly they rejoice in floating, yet none can escape.
Round and round the waves churn, vast and boundless the clear and turbid merge as one.
"Return! Why not cast off the bitter sea and play in the golden halls and jade chambers of Yaochi?"

Yet the world clings to the fiery household—only fools refuse to leave.
Day and night, they drown in worldly toil; dawn and dusk, they are shackled by passions and desires.
They fret over the hardships of wives and children, the pressing pangs of hunger and cold;
thus their bodies and minds are thrown into turmoil, driven and harried by vexations.
Foolish indeed! They harbor triple intentions, devise a hundred schemes.
They harm others with venom like serpents and lizards, wound kin with cunning like mosquitoes and dragonflies.
Poverty and lowliness stem from causes sown in past lives;
wealth and honor are not the blessings and wisdom of this present existence.

Now, countless heroes vainly bear their names.
They employ cunning, flaunt their cleverness, and indulge in arrogance and extravagance, parading their prowess.
They think not of the life to come, nor heed the path ahead.
Seizing profit and contending for fame, they willingly become seeds of the Three Wretched Realms;
deceiving heaven and obscuring earth, they gladly join the multitudes of the Six Paths.

It is said: they yield to confusion, seeking no health or wholeness.
Their schemes are laced with a thousand poisons; they harbor not a thread of desire for the Way of goodness.
Utterly devoid of awakening, they are truly the most witless of creatures;
most pitiable, they are all destined for hell.
By and large, envy and obstinacy—who can willingly let them go?
They flaunt wind and sell rain, scraping and scrounging for money and goods;
they grasp at clouds and drown in mist, buying and selling fields and deeds.
They cheat neighbors, harm the orphaned and widowed.
Ever harboring perverse and deviant hearts, they mock and slight the worthy and sagely;
disbelieving in the retribution of good and ill fortune, they treat parents with contempt.

Thus they delight only in seeking wealth, never in avoiding sin.
They chant Buddha’s name and recite sutras, feigning goodness with their mouths;
they carve stakes and stab coffins, yet seldom mend their hearts.
Their frivolous and superficial understanding remains unremoved; their flattery and deceit, their schemes and snares, persist.
Like beasts caught in nets, they plunge into the pit of delusion;
like fish in turbid waters, they drift and sink in the bitter sea.
Once the vessel of karma is full, King Yama swiftly summons them.
Beaten with iron rods and bronze hammers, they endure the slow torment of knife mountains and sword trees.
Forever prisoners of the netherworld, they wail in misery day after day;
eternal ghosts of the dark mountains, they cry out in sorrow night after night.

Alas! Since such terror awaits, one ought to awaken early.
Break open the shackles of love and attachment, leap onto the clouded paths of mist and rosy clouds.
"Return! Within the gourd, spring runs deep—go and meet in the Peach Blossom Land."

Yet people say the world has long been corrupt, and many speak of mysteries.

When they discourse on the great elixir of golden cinnabar, they speak of firing times and celestial cycles. Before those who cultivate the hidden and feathered, they recklessly expound on teachings; beside reclusive men of virtue, they wildly preach true principles. Fools!—they flaunt their shallow knowledge, parading their sophistry. Those who seek fame and profit—when have they ever been pure and upright? Those who crave wine and lust—how can they truly observe fasts and precepts? Their tongues are sharp as swords, their words sold for gain. They speak of lineages and patriarchs, yet those who listen seem mad at heart; they claim to dwell in the Dao or the Mysterious, but when questioned, they feign deafness. If they mock superiors and inferiors alike, scorning the wise and foolish, then in discussing prominent figures, they twist facts to fit their meter, and in casual conversation, they lace their speech with archaic particles. Having never truly studied the Dao, they merely aim to fill their mouths. Dividing the subtle mysteries of the Three Vehicles, they confuse the vulgar; displaying the antics of ninefold madness, they prove themselves mere fools.

You claim the Supreme Simplicity and the Great Beginning, the utmost hardness and vastness—yet these lie not within the Void, but first emerge beyond the boundless dark. Hard to express in words, they manifest as the music of heaven. To expound on the wonders of heaven and earth, yin and yang, is already a daunting task; to parse the mechanisms of the turning heavens and creation’s workings is truly beyond grasp. Most know not strength from weakness, how then can they discern right from wrong? Compose a single lyric, and they flaunt it before others; pen a pair of quatrains, and they boast beyond the world. Little do they know that praise given to their faces brings only sorrow when heard anew. Those who pore over ten thousand volumes may yet fail to transcend life and death; the enlightened who grasp the essence of the One Truth soar beyond mist and rosy clouds.

Thus we know that relying solely on perception and hearsay leads not to truth. They abandon Yanzi’s joy in a bamboo bowl and gourd ladle, instead practicing Yang Zhu’s arts of rouge and powder. With glib tongues, they sway the crowd—yet in the Dao, they are not one. Shameless and unprincipled, their conduct limps like a crippled turtle; swayed by joy and wrath, their arguments dart like a flying dragon. Know this: their words may be heard for a moment, but should not be endured long. To befriend them brings no benefit; to study their principles yields only empty rhetoric. They speak of thousands of things, yet the Dao is not in them even halfway. Everywhere they go, they debate right and wrong. Their actions defy reason, and in every place, they vie for prominence. Unaware of the sovereign heart, how can they possess compassion? Fearless and unafraid, when they speak, they compare my length to your shortness; when they argue, they care not for falsehoods or taboos.

Alas, alas! They know not what those who speak of the Dao truly seek—only to cultivate their qi.

**The Daoist’s Leisurely Wanderings**

A man of great aspiration should set his heart on the True. Since the Dao is his foundation, let him wander the world with a carefree spirit. How grand is the mechanism of the Mysterious! It requires a lofty scholar to grasp it. Observe the carefree wanderer—he moves unseen among the dust of the world. Only by shedding the cage of the mundane can one find joy in the Dao. Some wash their ears and discard their gourds, laughing at the folly of Xu You of old; some ride donkeys through the world, surpassing the carefree Master Guo. They do not seek cloud-wandering for its own sake, but rather to gather the magic herbs. Forsaking fame and profit, they do not merely delight in poverty; cutting ties with love and kin, they diligently cultivate the Heavenly Treasure.

If one can withdraw from the world, one should refine the body. Some, sated with classical learning, harbor minds like merchants; others, rich in virtue and conduct, shine inwardly like stars. With such resolve, what harm does wandering do to the spirit? Pitiable are the refined gentlemen who, though they embrace the Mysterious Teachings, remain like recluses in the wilderness, striding freely through the fields. They wander green mountains at dusk, roam beside emerald waters, viewing wealth and honor as floating clouds, casting off glory like worn-out shoes. How noble are the worthy who do this—truly, the Daoist can achieve it. Free from glory and disgrace, they remain serene in poverty; whether still or moving, they soar like solitary cranes. In autumn and winter, gazing across the wilds, they observe the rise and fall of all beings; in spring and summer, they wander in delight, admiring the vibrant hues of a hundred flowers. What wealth could compare to the joy of leisure?

Thus the Perfected Ones of utmost virtue and emptiness ride the winds beyond the world; the enlightened scholars of pure yang wander the mortal realm like merchants. Some wear tattered robes of coarse cloth, donning straw raincoats and bamboo hats; some dwell in forests and springs to conceal their aspirations, or roam marketplaces to forget their habits. What others cannot discern, the Daoist in leisure fully attains. Having cultivated the resolve of the True Person, they dwell in peace. They ascend beyond the realm of the Jade Emperor, gathering in serene assembly. Their merits and deeds complete, body and mind no longer wander. They obtain the joy of the elixir from the Mysterious Crucible, joining the immortal companions of Penglai. Delighted to shed their mortal shells and ascend, they swiftly depart the dusty world; fortunate to ride the phoenix’s wings and return, they forever roam the Isles of Yingzhou.

Yet how varied are people’s natures, how fickle the world’s warmth and cold! Those who stretch out their hands in the streets are called lazy and indolent; those who beg for alms are criticized for their faults. For the most part, they forget both worldly concerns and let right and wrong be. Alas, alas! Who understands that the Daoist’s wanderings are like angling for golden carp—not merely idle leisure?

**Two Lyrics to the Tune "Tossing the Ball"**
*Composed by Changquanzi of Guishan*

**I.**
The Daoist’s heart-seal awakens—
naturally clear and free.
This wondrous work of the Mysterious Pass,
the divine power of Creation,
no brush of past or present could ever paint.
Behold the everlasting spring within the gourd,
where brocade rivers and mountains vie in splendor.
Everywhere, towers of blossoms rise,
fragrant breezes exhale,
and lofty peach trellises soar.
Roaming the Purple Tenuity’s crimson palaces,
the Jasper Pool’s jade gardens—
how could one envy the world’s
gardens and wilds?
Strolling the Phoenix Terrace,
listening to the pure, refined strains of *Xiao Shao*,
its melody so elegant.
Freely roaming in and out,
unbound by spirit or void,
riding jade whips and golden steeds.
Suddenly standing alone in heaven and earth,
gazing at the ten thousand forms
arrayed beneath the azure vault.
In the Hall of Five Lights,
the Assembly of the Mysterious Pearl,
the wondrous body sways like mist and maidenhair.
Fermented from magic mushrooms—
who would pay a thousand gold for its worth?
Only those who meet a true master,
their numinous passage opened,
ever respond without deceit.
Reveling in the sages’ profound truths,
passing days in humility and kindness,
with six senses cleansed,
governing by non-action’s transforming breeze.
The osmanthus branch of the nature-moon blooms,
radiating ten thousand rays of light, unwaning.
Guard the celestial mechanism’s secret,
never let it slip away.
Unfold the root’s subtle Dao—
how many deeply know it?
Since the Great Simplicity first divided,
splitting the primal chaos,
Fu Xi, the August Sovereign, drew the eight trigrams.
Discerning the hundred herbs,
Shennong’s merit shone;
sowing the five grains,
his virtue spread through Hua and Yi.
Thereafter, the era of the Yellow Emperor dawned,
his sagely teachings proclaimed,
and auspicious mushrooms sprouted in every land.
Far-flung frontiers rested in peace,
all nations under heaven at ease.
Then, wandering in search of the Dao,
he sought seventy masters in succession.
From this, the pure wind spread,
and in later ages, immortals emerged in the world’s turning.
Yet today, failing to awaken,
the masses remain deluded,
their legs racing after profit and fame.
Only I cast off all fetters,
carefree and untrammeled,
roaming south and north, east and west.
Within the gourd’s scene,
the true message—
the three fires refining Kan and Li.
In the profound and indistinct,
who believes in the flight of the Pure Yang dragon?
Turning the jade gate and golden pass,
auspicious mists and propitious vapors
veil the Purple Tenuity.
Hearing the snow-melody of the stringless lute,
the immortal’s music so fair,
witnessing sun and moon conjoined,
forging the elixir’s measure.
When the Great Elixir’s work is complete,
brushing my sleeves, I depart,
returning to the path of eternal life.
Dwelling in the celestial palace’s joy,
the Jasper Pool of Wuling.

**II.**
*To the Tune "Heavenly Fragrance: Plum Blossoms"*
All trees return to their roots,
yet through three winters, it stands aloof—
at dawn, the plum’s buds gently unfurl.
Jealous of snow’s spirit,
its purity outshines the flames of mortals,
forbidding careless plucking.
Before a hundred flowers bloom,
it alone claims the eastern lord’s spring hues.
Slanting across Yu Ridge,
its solitary fragrance so refined—
a marvel beyond fathoming.
By West Lake, utterly serene,
surpassing waxen yellow,
it deepens the soul’s awakening.
The courier of the village ahead leaks the news,
bearing glad tidings.
Inspiring poets’ elegant verses,
facing a single golden bud,
one’s spirit finds delight.
Moonlight bathes the cold branches,
heavenly fragrance—how precious!

*To the Tune "Candlelight Shakes the Red"*
Chrysanthemums bloom in golden flowers,
the moon ascends the azure sky, its light so bright.
After frost and rain, their fragrance peaks,
illuminating all four seas in perfect clarity.
Petal upon petal unfurls in radiant splendor,
breathing perfumed winds,
their brilliance soaring beyond the heavens.
By the balustrade, refined and secluded,
in the void’s embrace, graceful and timely,
they reveal their wondrous nature.
The fairy blossoms of Penglai,
Jiaoran’s three paths—few know their song.
The Jade Terrace’s precious mirror shines on *Saha*,
and those who awaken see truth in every turn.
Best to face the eastern fence in admiration,
casting light on rivers and mountains,
the empty hall’s numinous pool.
A few golden stalks,
ten thousand silver rays—
the floating world scarcely understands.

**Two Lyrics to "Dispelling Sorrow"**

**I.**
Years and months rush past,
hurried as galloping steeds.
Coming and going, they silently hasten this floating world.
Who awakens from the River of Love?
Amid waves of desire,
bitterly contending for fame and profit.
In the fiery household, fretting over wife and child,
never heeding one’s own collapse.
You wait until the great limit arrives,
then grieve and regret—
what use is it then?
A living ghost, trading bones a thousand times,
laboring in vain,
tumultuous as ants in chaos.
A true man’s heart is fierce and resolute,
wielding wisdom to cast off a myriad entanglements.
Shattering the mortal cage without hindrance,
roaming mountains and rivers at will.
Beneath the forest’s shade,
drunk on the true wind,
lying at ease in lofty repose,
claiming the noble leisure of purity.

**II.**
Gazing back at the human world,
busy, bustling,
day and night toiling without rest.
How much can one truly do?
This hundred-year span—
like spring snow.
Alas, the heavenly truth lost to love and desire,
like a puppet pulled by strings.
Silently lamenting this floating life in the bitter sea,
changing heads and swapping shells—
when will it ever end?
Hearing of ancient and modern times,
those chasing fame and profit—
mere fox dens and rabbit tracks.
The Six Dynasties and Five Hegemons
all yielded to the heroes of water and clouds.
Only the truly pure make steadfast companions,
nurturing the vast and bright,
the cold integrity of the frost-defying years.
This simple, unadorned life—
with whom to share its beauty?
Only the moon at the pine window.

**Five Lyrics to the Tune "Court-Filling Fragrance"**

**I.**
The Great Awakening’s radiance—
no need to seek it outside,
for each person bears a Tathāgata within.
Yet in this floating life, deluded,
trading bones a thousand times.
Piercing the numinous source’s dharma sea,
the Chan river swells,
waves towering like mountains.
The mud ox roars,
the dawn of *Weiyin* resounds,
and iron walls raise clouds and thunder.

**II.**
Bodhi—
the seamless pagoda,
veiled by forests and peaks,
the mountains’ hues parting.
Let Cao Creek’s snow overflow,
revealing the red plum.
Everywhere, the fragrant realm of *Xiangyan*—
cease distinctions,
whether sacred trees or humble weeds.
The true message—
atop the solitary peak,
the stone maiden embroiders moss.

**III.**
A wondrous family tradition,
neither void nor form,
transcending coming and going.
Surpassing past and present,
those who awaken escape the wheel of rebirth.
Plucking forth the sacred realm of eternal spring,
where jasper flowers bloom
and iron trees soar.
Who knows the awakening—
at midnight, Ding’s hammer strikes,
shaking the nine heavens with thunder.

**IV.**
The Mysterious Gate—
truly carefree,
yet star towers and moon palaces
remain closed to the foolish.
The *Liaoyang* magic mushrooms—
truly surpassing the winter plum.

The mind’s divine mechanism—unfathomable,
why trouble to fly past Penglai?
Beyond the red dust,
jade-shoal idlers,
unwilling to tread upon the green moss.
Fierce in cultivating truth,
ardent in discerning the Dao,
all ten thousand greens seen through as emptiness.
Within the cauldron of Great Void,
silently nurturing harmony and equanimity.
A single luminous pearl gleams,
its radiance like moonlight
illuminating a thousand peaks.
In the eternal spring scene,
atop the Five Cloud Terrace,
magic mushrooms exhale fragrant winds.

These subtle principles—
though distant as a thousand leagues,
meet in truth’s green thread.
Not a speck of dust clings,
purity is the true work.
In daily use, nothing obscured,
transcending birth and death,
the dharma-realm cannot contain it.
If you can grasp this,
carefree and at ease,
everywhere is a celestial palace.

Laozi’s true mechanism,
the Tathāgata’s ancestral seal,
clearly prior to the image of God.
Neither born nor destroyed,
truly the most profound mystery.
A sweep of pure wind across the earth,
deluded clouds disperse,
the bright moon hangs in the sky.
Do you know?
Beyond the vast kalpas,
the dharma-drum shakes the three thousand worlds.

In truth, wondrous indeed—
nameless and formless,
neither Dao nor Chan.
Seeking outside,
how can I transmit it to you?
Unwilling to turn the light inward,
you trudge through mountains and rivers in vain.
Returning at last,
neither person nor ox in sight,
fragrant grasses lock the river mist.

The family’s inherent tradition,
in daily life’s ordinary moments,
where is it not a forest spring?
Hunger eats, thirst drinks,
naturally passing the years.
Actions beyond mortal reach—
cease calculations,
fortune and misfortune are heaven’s will.
Do you know?
This body is but a loan,
how can the ten thousand affairs be firm?

A meager livelihood—
desolate and carefree,
words fail to express it.
A bamboo bowl and gourd dipper suffice,
where to find money to buy mountains?
Just be drifting and free,
let the world’s clamor rage like snowstorms.
True joy—
walking beneath pines in moonlight,
sleeping on rocks with books as a pillow.

**Green-Headed Duck**
After rain clears, rivers and mountains renew their freshness.
Suddenly, bright sun—
spring’s beauty so lovely,
fields and plains seen,
lush green grass spreading.
Watching pear blossoms
veiled in pale moonlight,
hearing pines whisper,
harmonizing with clear springs.
Gentle winds on the pond,
curtains hanging in the courtyard,
dawn orioles sing,
willows shrouded in mist.
Layered emerald peaks shimmer like polished jade,
the season’s wonders defy brush and ink.

Who can awaken?
The splendor of youth does not last,
the human world is not enduring.
Chasing the red dust,
when do they ever turn inward?
Wasting vitality and spirit,
idly passing the years.
Competing for profit like flies drawn to blood,
clinging to wives and sons like ants to fat.
The burning house’s torment,
emotional waves rise and fall,
in the four births and six paths, none remember to return.
Through a thousand kalpas, trading flesh for bones,
they lose their original spiritual source.

Clever ones—
put down all entanglements,
leisurely cultivate immortality.

**Slow Tune of the River Spirit**
Sweep away the six dusts near at hand,
examine the present—
truly the message.
Wisdom’s light blazes.
Personally plucking forth
the wondrous function of the spiritual root—
transcending sound and form.
A melody of *Weiyin*, beyond musical scales,
surpassing past and present—
who can hear its resonant clarity?
Ten thousand miles of clouds gather,
the clear sky vast,
moonlight pure and white.
Freely traversing the golden field of awakened ocean,
laughing at the flatterer’s songs and tangled vines,
a thousand yards of kudzu.
Extinguishing emotional consciousness,
beyond empty kalpas,
the gate veiled in green moss, tranquil and still.
Utterly emptying the extreme,
on the pillow, rivers and mountains in spring’s beauty,
aged pine flowers,
fragrant winds wafting through broad streets.
At this moment, become a carefree
wanderer of mist and rosy clouds.

**Rain-Soothing Bell**
At dawn, the earth congeals.
Wind and clouds gather,
timely as seasonable rain.
Yin and yang harmonize in the void,
becoming sweet dew,
spreading across mountains and marshes.
Droplet by droplet, rich as cream—
washing away demonic vapors,
the four seas grow clear and pure.
The divine work of heaven and earth’s creation—
how many in this bustling world awaken?
The beauty of heaven and earth’s grace,
universally bestowed.
Beyond this Sahā world,
such value is hard to buy.
Nurturing the flourishing of all things,
increasing auspiciousness,
the people sing and dance in celebration.
Five grains abundant,
all affairs peaceful,
far and near secure.
Grateful for the harmony of above and below,
free from action—
we reverently honor the Mysterious Origin Ancestor.

**Three Songs of the Crimson Capital**

**I.**
Born lazy by nature,
loving quietude—
at ease, sitting in clarity.
Face unwashed, hair unkempt,
cultivating detachment,
dispelling disasters.
No entanglements, no conflicts,
letting things pass as they will.
Nor do I know how
to burn incense or light lamps.
Muttering and chanting,
singing freely as I please.

In a dream of Southern Branch,
I saw through the insignificance of fleeting fame and profit,
crushing body and mind.
Holding magic mushrooms,
floating in the realm of nothingness—
who knows me?
Pure winds and bright moon
often celebrate me.
In the distant void,
I cultivate the fruit of immortality.
Clearly awakened, I depart,
endlessly reclining in the nine heavens.

**II.**
Seeking wondrous scenes,
beholding the crimson city’s lush abundance,
a thousand acres of magic fields.
Beyond the world, at leisure,
delighting in truth,
pursuing joyful inspiration.
A small boat carries the moon,
a straw cloak tinkles in the mist.
Sobering from wine,
I chant by the flowing stream.
A single note of Qiang flute,
three scrolls of dawn wind—
refreshingly serene and sublime.

**III.**
Whose slow tune is strummed, unheard?
Like a wild crane soaring into the sky,
a life adrift like duckweed.
Roaming freely through heaven and earth,
with rivers and lakes,
I mend my fishing line.
Hooking a golden carp,
I bring forth abundant blessings.
Then returning,
galloping through the Mysterious Capital.
A staff bearing spring’s colors,
carefree in the immortal realm of Great Void.

The heart vast as rivers and seas,
embracing a hundred streams and ten thousand waves,
clear and unobstructed.
Boundless and deep—
how many know it encompasses the sand-realm?
Radiant brilliance surpasses the three samādhis.
Speaking of the lesser vehicle,
demons retreat in hiding.
The primal wind’s pattern,
the mystery of emptiness—
the foolish cannot comprehend.

Proclaiming the truth of the original beginning,
uniting the gate of all wonders,
peerless in high and low.
Responding to things in every moment,
manifesting compassion,
dispelling disasters.
Neither born nor destroyed,
neither inside nor outside.
This song of mystery—
who will buy it?
Jade Capital immortals
blow the celestial pipes of Great Void.

**Five Songs of Auspicious Cranes**

**I.**
Years turn like blossoms in flight.
The world’s path is ever frantic—
when will men know contentment?
Like ants jostling for a needle’s tip,
this floating fame, this hollow gain,
brings little honor, much disgrace.
Who can master few desires?
Drunk on tranquil bliss, Heaven’s finest bounty.
Let the dusty ledgers scatter in a day,
turn back, retreat to the hidden valley.

Pure fortune—
walking beneath pines in moonlight,
sleeping on stone amid clouds,
a nature free as deer.
Sing a carefree song,
then idly pluck the zither, lay out the chessboard.
Listen to gibbons cry, cranes call,
waters green, mountains blue,
the wind tapping jade-thin stalks beyond the fence.
This true fear—
who among the boastful, past or present,
can carry it forward?

**II.**
Flowers bloom in the Jasper Park,
by the Wuling Stream they are seen.
Behold the jade terraces of the Celestial Court,
where blossoms surely unfurl.
Such grace is rare in the world.
They exhale fresh fragrance, rare and bright,
purple lingzhi among them.
The Lord of Spring cares not—
there is yet another,
a *Perennial Spring* art.
Upon the tree of Non-Action, fragrance lingers,
radiance ever-present, day by day.

Worthy of offering—
the root of the Mysterious Origin,
the golden threads of its branches—
who has truly witnessed this?
Where lies true nobility?
At the Golden Lotus Assembly,
let it unfold at will.
This heaven-born elegance,
a kind of jade blossom,
only befits the company of immortals.
If mortals pluck and return with it,
the Jade Capital will reward their gaze.

**III.**
Wind enters the jade grove,
the peaks of Yu rest awhile.
The wind stirs the jade grove,
deepening true joy.
Heat and vexation vanish at once,
sweeping the dust from the four seas,
vast and open, all is arranged.
The eight directions grow still and pure.
A single flavor—
the wonder of frozen emotion, peerless.
This brother of clarity,
this simple life,
has never been lightly revealed.

Strange and distinct—
day and night, the rustling of the cosmos,
swift as a fleeting glance.
Following the wheel’s track,
seeking wise friends,
keeping the bright moon company.
When a hundred flowers unite in splendor,
their resonant voices spread,
moving yin and yang by the true formula.
Wait for this floating life—
when delusion’s clouds disperse,
weary, we shall speak in detail.

**IV.**
The moon shines on Dongting,
the autumn sky like water.
The night deepens, colors grow fresh,
all things wondrously fair.
The mountain hall’s joy knows no bounds.
See the full moon’s glow,
probing Dongting’s depths.
A pure wind sweeps the earth,
everywhere virtue’s radiance spreads.
Across the sands, its beams pierce the clear sky,
through the ages, green osmanthus congeals in beauty.

Noble—
appearing as form demands,
judging all things without bias,
azure heavens display their auspice.
Solitary, crisp, and rare.
Its light illumines the Dharma Realm,
revealing numinous wisdom.
A thousand paths of pure radiance
enter doors, pass through windows,
brilliant, dispelling the dim and dull to aid all.
May the common folk
awaken early to perfect clarity,
grasping this truth in full.

**V.**
Fortune’s turning arrives in good time.
The pitch-pipes shift,
the Northern Star proclaims its decree.
Soon, auspicious signs appear—
dense clouds congeal into snow,
dawn veils Penglai Isle.
Heaven’s virtue flourishes.
Everywhere, jade flowers gleam in splendor.
Across the vast sky, flakes drift lightly,
revealing the subtle wonder of sacred work.

Profound—
the Void’s creation,
the secret divine mechanism—
to whom can it be explained?
The path to the Three Mountains fades.
Truly carefree,
washing away the world’s dust.
Behold the jade palaces, the jeweled halls,
the pristine pavilions—
immortals come and go in graceful ease.
This ice-pure, jade-chaste family way—
how many suddenly comprehend?

**Playing Jade Steps (Originally "Amusing the Three Terraces")**
Pointing straight to the path of the Mysterious Origin,
lamenting the bitter sea—
the lost who never awaken.

Before your eyes—calm and steady,
no trace of peril or obstruction.
Let go of the ten thousand ties all at once,
and the sages and worthies will naturally lift you up.
Like a lone cloud, a wild crane soaring,
strolling beyond the world, through the azure heavens.
Celebrating the immortal’s words,
thirst quenched by peaches of immortality, sweet and rich.
Coming and going among star towers and moonlit halls,
laughing at those who ask of life and death, past and present.
Riding the auspicious phoenix and sacred simurgh, weary of the Great Void,
returning to where the emerald mists unfold.
Who can transmit this carefree way of living?
Entrust it to the companions of Penglai.

**Flower Heart Moved (Two Poems)**

**Strolling by the River, Seeing Plum Blossoms**
By the water’s edge, their graceful forms emerge,
buds half-opened, sparse shadows slanting,
exquisite and proud, scorning frost and snow.
Lean and solitary, they stand alone by the wind terrace,
mocking the hundred plants frozen and broken.
Their fragrance scatters—
by bamboo fences and thatched cottages,
they are most worthy of planting.

**Breaking Winter’s Grip, Heralding Spring’s Full Arrival**
Jade-like medicine blooms on branches of pearl,
yet who glances at them in passing?
Longing to send word to an old friend,
but couriers are rare—
only facing their subtle scent, forlorn and mournful.
Where now is the Princess of Shouyang?
This Jade Maiden of Guye is pure beyond compare.
To whom can one speak
of the pale moon at dusk by the small window?

**A Hundred Years of Light**

A hundred years of light—
like whirling winds, fleeting breath,
thunder’s lightning flash,
the swift return of sunlight’s gaze.
The fleeting scene cannot be stayed,
and unawares, the temples turn to snow.
When will the thousand green entanglements end?
From dusk to dawn, the heart’s inch knots in sorrow twist.
I urge the heroic:
let not the cauldron shatter,
for once the rope is snapped, it cannot be rejoined.

**One Misstep, Ten Thousand Kalpas Lost**

One misstep, and the human form is lost for ten thousand kalpas.
Alas for the clever and astute,
who never knew the prison’s chains.
Longing to scale the mountain of grace,
to cast aside jade pendants and golden willows—
who would dare to hurl them away?
When the great limit arrives at the gate,
and in an instant, one sees old age,
how can it be denied?
In that exhausted hour,
one recalls the sages’ wondrous secrets.

**Two Songs of the Cavernous Mystery**

**I. The Wild Hall’s Aging Blossoms**

The wild hall’s blossoms age,
beyond the balustrade, their subtle fragrance drifts.
Deep green shadows, deep and still, reflect the window.
Let the sun turn toward the western suburbs—
for now, idly watch the clouds rise over southern shores.
See the distant peaks, faint and blue, meet the sky,
where stone teeth part the spring,
and pearls scatter like flying rain.
The cinnabar mound is but a footstep away—
how many turn their gaze?

The burrowing mole’s tunnels are not worth counting.
Though one might wander the ornate paths forever,
how could it compare to exploring the misty peaks?
To pillow one’s head on the clouds and rosy glow of a thousand valleys,
delighting in this life—
then even the red dust’s touch
could not stain the black and white.

**II. Weary of Wandering, Retreating a Footstep**

Weary of wandering, I retreat a footstep,
to the rustic harbor of Luli’s simple ways.
My vast qi soars into the empty sky—
to whom can it be told?
Drunk, I toast spring’s brew with three cups,
dispelling quiet longing with a single leaf’s vast expanse.
In wild robes, I wander carefree through the forest groves,
pulling trusted friends along
to share the bamboo’s wind, the flowers, the moon.
My life is pure and still—
the subtlest wonders are beyond all questioning.

I scorn the array of embroidered carriages and brocade curtains.
Delighting in the fields and reeds,
I whistle and roam my hoary crown,
planting pines and chrysanthemums,
dwelling in pristine integrity.
This single taste of true reverence—
how many know it?
There is the quiet desk, the rush mat,
the incense burner’s sinking embers.

---

**Song of the Water Dragon**

Where is my homeland for resting?
The sea’s mountains gather mist, the spring wind soft.

**The Flowers Bloom in Lush Profusion**

Flowers bloom in lush profusion, stones glisten with moisture,
clouds flirt in delicate grace, mist hovers in pale wisps—
the very face of heaven flows like water.
The fragrance of sacred mushrooms and cassia drifts apart,
the wine of tangerines and oranges gleams rich,
brocade mats ensnare the verdant hues.
With rainbow skirts trailing in ethereal sway,
jade-feathered canopies take flight—
at the Jasper Pool’s feast,
they revel in beauty’s splendor.
Yet gazing down, they laugh at the world’s wealth and rank.
In the end—
all is but a hollow pretense.
Fields of mulberry darken and shift,
human life ages in vain—
who can truly find contentment?
Tigers war and dragons clash,
Han rises and Qin falls—
what profit remains today?
Behold Penglai’s purple courts,
the ever-springing scenes of paradise—
perfection beyond all compare.

---

**Rain on Flowers**

Swift, swift—time’s voice,
like an arrow loosed in darkness, hurries all away.
People, smoke, and grass blur into vast obscurity.
The frontier geese lament autumn’s late chill,
withered leaves drift in yellowed descent.
Ten thousand miles of passes and mountains lie desolate,
a single sky of wind and rain chills the bones.
This life of quiet ease—
to whom can I confide it,
to bare my inmost heart?
Frost’s cold, dew’s clarity,
chrysanthemums grow gaunt, plane trees wither—
once more, the Double Ninth draws near.
I trust in the light within the gourd,
the homeland of clouds and waters.
Golden halls and jade towers, courtyards,
brooks lined with flowers, pools and gardens—
all the world’s illusions,
hollow fame and fleeting gain,
are but shadows tied to the yellow root.

---

**Two Poems on the Hundred Treasures**

**I.**
Pomegranate blossoms burst in rich fragrance,
curtains half-drawn—
how long the idle hours of a clear day.
The courtyard lies unstirred by dust,
a light rain passes over the pond.
From the secluded pavilion, the breeze
stirs the bamboo’s song,
while stone pillows and rattan couches await.
All else fades—
watching cloud peaks rise and fall,
lost in lofty slumber, carefree,
I have reached the age of Fuxi.
Enough, enough—
the world’s dust is wholly forgotten.
In true constancy’s wondrous work,
I arrange yellowed scrolls and incense.
No need to envy the vulgar throng,
like ants drawn to the scent of fat.
In purity and plainness, I find joy in poverty,
though scorching heat may never breach the hall of Daoist wisdom.
To settle the heart is to glimpse the plain and simple family way—
within the grotto lies another realm of immortals.

**II.**
A single spark of spirit-light,
spinning through ten thousand kalpas,
endlessly cycling through womb, egg, moisture, and transformation.
The bitter sea knows no shore—
when will birth and death ever cease?
The four great elements of the primal root are not enduring—
why cling so stubbornly to this bodily form?
Grind away the floating dreams of the world,
wield the sword of wisdom to sever the roots of karma.
A life of carefree ease beyond the dust,
content with fate, knowing destiny,
I idle in the company of wind and moon.
Embracing and guarding the primal yang,
spirit and qi naturally merge.
Heaven and earth invert, Kan and Li reverse—
this natural harmony of completion is no forced contrivance.
Spring’s birth, summer’s growth, autumn’s harvest—
all things share a single qi, no division between.

---

**Oriole Weaving Through Willows**

Silent accord in the carriage’s ride.

Leave behind weariness and worldly toil,
return to thatched huts and native soil.
Let others vie with martial might—
tiger-stratagems and bear-tactics,
banners rising in fierce contest.
What use such valorous display?
Only to win a face grown prematurely frail.
A turn of the hand, and all is emptiness—
fleeting splendor vanishes like dust.
How much better to delight in simple joys:
blossoms in the imperial gardens,
fish gliding through spring waters,
cheeks flushed with crimson beauty.
Let cares dissolve in revelry,
amid the songs and flutes of Green Gate.
Drunk, lie down in the east wind’s embrace,
watch golden willows sway along the dyke.
Cast off the trappings of office,
let wild greenery spread in disarray.

*Celestial Fragrance, Two Poems*

Swift as a shadow’s passage, years slip by—
worldly affairs no more than dust or hair.
How few perceive this truth and cease their striving?
"Return!" I say—
plow the clouds, fish the streams,
find tranquil ease beneath the pines.
Within the emerald hills’ embrace,
another realm of carefree delight.
A single song of mystery, borne on celestial fragrance—
ah, how fleeting glory’s bloom!
A half-cottage of white thatch suffices.
Heart at ease, I chant and drink through all four seasons.
Reflecting on this human life,
what use, in the end, all striving?
Watching the rise and fall of empty flowers,
this perfect harmony’s message outshines all beauty.
Great simplicity, pure customs,
the wondrous principle of emptiness and clarity.

*On Cultivating the True*

To speak of cultivating the true:
the mysterious pass points straight within—
all external adornments cast aside from the heart.
In stillness, sit cross-legged,
preserve the spirit, grasp the firm,
let go of judgments of right and wrong, high and low.
Live by fate’s unfolding,
content with warmth and fullness—
all else forgotten, erased.
This pure leisure holds boundless worth,
yet to the foolish, it cannot be told.

Here lies the wondrous secret of utmost sincerity—
alas, how few learners ever pause to rest.
In silence, in dimness,
jade blossoms bloom fully within the alchemical flask.
In the midst of vagueness, forms appear—
behold! A luminous pearl
shines bright as the radiant moon.
When this is realized,
one roams the sacred realms.

*Four Poems of Erlang Shen*

I sigh for this fleeting life,
day and night in ceaseless toil.
How long can a lifetime’s fleeting splendor last?
Like a cloud’s question, like lightning’s turning palm.
When will the dream’s encroaching illusions awaken?
Entangled in the fiery court, bound in karmic nets.
This human form, once lost,
meets not again in ten thousand kalpas—
who can turn back?

Awake!
Leap boldly from the waves of delusion’s sea.
The other shore’s scenery is true bliss,
companioned by lone clouds and wild cranes, drifting free.
The spirit’s terrace, fully realized, knows no obstruction—
like the moon hung in the vast, clear sky.
Filling the ten directions, the three realms,
crystal-bright, perfectly luminous,
one chants in carefree song.

Again—
this life’s joys:
ten thousand acres of clouded mountains, wild scenes.
Bamboo groves, plum villages, a thatched hut’s quiet—
this secluded ease the world cannot surpass.
A stringless melody resounds through the cosmos,
facing the sinking incense, the stone stove’s silent listening.
Beneath the forest’s shade, I linger,
nurturing indolence,
cultivating the nature of mist and rosy clouds.

Returning to the mandate,
donning coarse hemp, I penetrate the ancient sages’ mystery.

Behold egrets standing, gulls flying o’er sandy shores,
laughing at drunken parrots, adrift like jars in midstream.
A pillow’s *Huaxu* spring dream awakens—
how could one envy the ranks of marquises and tripods?
Soon turning back, returning home,
moonlight gilds the pine creek,
clouds tread the mossy path.

Again—
leaving the dust of the vulgar,
I take stock of the refined joys of groves and springs.
Bamboo staff, straw sandals, green bamboo hat,
drifting on misty waves with a supple oar.
On moonlit nights, the river and sky’s boundless bliss—
playing a short flute, dreaming of *Xiaoxiang*’s isles.
This message,
priceless, unbartered,
best shared with fisher and woodcutter.
Go home.
Facing evening’s emerald hues, wind rising on the little cove,
I see through *Nanhua*’s tortoise dragging its tail—
let the robed and hatted jackals and tigers have their way.
Who else like me adds wild water to their cup,
drunk beyond the depths of white clouds?
Let autumn moons and spring blossoms,
silently transform mulberry fields,
brightly hasten past and present.

Again—
pouring out my heart,
for the great earth, tears shed for all beings.
Dawn to dusk, tormented by greed for livelihood—
all entangled in the snares of wives and sons.
Scheming ten thousand ruses to chase wealth and rank,
heedless of the plow’s high yoke.
I urge the deluded to awaken early,
lest later lives’ causes and conditions
be truly written in vain.
Secluded and refined,
purchasing the wondrous and profound—
no coin required.
Only keep the lamp of the heart ever unclouded,
that all dharmas’ numinous connections may be subdued.
Awaiting the day when the elixir is complete and the journey home fulfilled,
shedding this fourfold illusory mortal frame.
Toward the Peach Blossom Land’s immortal gathering,
jade halls and golden towers,
eternal spring, never night.

Ascending the Azure Empyrean—
Alas, this human life,
fleeting as lightning, like floating foam.
Why trouble oneself with endless craving?
Glory and decay, gain and loss—
all fated by past causes, what need for sorrow?
Now awakened, I nurture Heaven’s harmony,
dwelling in secluded hills and mounds.
A basket of food, a gourd of drink,
the savor of zither and books—
passing days in leisure, resting in stillness.
Serene and expansive, true joy reciprocates.
Flower mornings, moonlit nights,
mouths agape, brows unfurled in laughter.
The Mystic Pearl gathered, silently I return,
roaming beyond the mundane.
Moon over the Sea of Crabapples—
Timely, the cosmos enacts compassion,
ferrying the suffering sea with a skiff of expedient means.
The Dharma realm reveals its majestic light,
preaching to demon hosts—
they hide and flee in disarray.
True immortals manifest,
possessing wondrous divine arts.
Heaven entrusts me to open the immortal sanctuary,
to broadly expound the great Dao’s mystery,
letting the wind carry its vast proclamation.
Bait fills the *sahā* world,
hooking golden turtles,
roaming the Jade Capital for sport.
At the jade-and-jewel feast,
I look down and whistle at the world’s ant-like battles.

A Sprig of Spring—
Alas for the fleshly puppets,
strangely contending in the dusty world.
Day and night, scorched in the fire of the household,
buried in flowers and wine,
karma’s weight never amended.
When will the bone-trading cease?
Heads and faces tumbling,
the true sovereign of the spirit’s source obscured.
Only I now delight in freedom,
roaming at ease through the vast sea of the world.
Carefree between heaven and earth,
laughing with open heart.
A taste of pure leisure—
ten thousand taels of gold could not buy it.
With ninefold mastery complete,
treading the moon, engraving the clouds,
I steadily ascend the golden lotus immortal assembly.

Drunk, Returning—
Swift as a shadow’s passage, time presses.

The human body is but a wind-blown candle.
Who believes in the unseen divine,
secretly repaying mortals with weal or woe?
Behold the two luminaries like turning wheels—
day and night, honor and disgrace tumble in flux.
The multitude suffers,
buzzing and swarming,
lost in craving and desire.
Only I turn my head,
returning to seclude in mountain valleys.
Fishing in waters, plowing clouds,
elegantly planting a few pines and chrysanthemums.
At leisure, I sing a tune,
envying not the crimson and green of power’s gates.
Cultivating simplicity,
poor yet carefree,
my lifelong wish fulfilled.

Two Cups Tilted—

Gazing back from beyond the world,
the River of Love surges,
vainly toiling—yet for what cause?
Clinging to wife and children,
competing for fame and profit,
thought after thought following them,
obscuring true thusness.
Sky-toppling wealth,
city-toppling beauty—
where do they all lead?
Alas for life’s twilight,
all ultimately reduced to emptiness.
Mourning the right and wrong of past and present.
A hundred years of joyous feasts—
how much in truth?
Dreaming of Southern Branch,
fate bound to Northern Prefecture,
still grasping greedily,
not seeking the path of return.
Trading bones in the wheel of rebirth,
body companioned by foxes and wolves.
How many times laid waste?
Only to reap the ebb and flow,
the bitter torrent of desire.

Again—

Enough, enough—I awaken,
forsaking the vulgar world.

Amidst the depths of Dongting’s search,
how fine the steps I tread.
The Great Elixir forged to perfection,
the precious pearl secured,
melodies played on stringless zithers—
their notes surpassing palace and court modes.
Vastly I propagate the Dao and virtue,
my bearing in the mold of Zhong and Lü,
of Xu You and Chao Fu.
Toward the carefree other shore I turn,
seeking that minstrel of water and cloud.
Who can succeed the sagely lineage?
Wisdom veiled as folly,
the six passions extinguished,
the nine mysteries penetrated in enlightenment.
Subtle essence, pure emptiness,
radiant and numinous clarity—
each and every thing,
without doubt, without care.
A single truth, lustrous and transparent,
meritorious deeds fulfilled,
instantly transcending the dusty realm.
Then I return, at ease and untrammeled,
beyond the world, all resolved.

Phoenix towers and paulownia groves—
escaping summer’s heat, I recline on a rope-strung couch to soothe my mood.
Emerald shadows dense and deep,
beneath the flowers’ shade in several places.
By the pond of daylilies, none inquire of me.
Green lotuses stealthily catch the fragrant breeze’s message.
Too weary to wield the frost-tipped fan, I begrudge my strength’s exhaustion.
Plunging plums in goblets, chilled ice near,
I demand fine tea and limpid spring water.
Bare-chested, my breast unbound from gloom,
once the tally is cast, I possess the share of immortals.

**Two Poems on the Immortals’ Gathering**

Pity the people of this world—
each one hastens to become a seal of office.

Those who refuse to turn back,
clinging to the fiery pit unto death.
Enduring a thousand hardships and ten thousand sufferings,
they sigh, willingly bearing all.
They scheme for their households,
worry for their wives and sons,
fearing they cannot manage.
Once their karma is fulfilled,
see how they, like hares, will flee.
When their eyes fall to the ground,
their faces transform entirely.
Donning fur and horns,
they lament, unable to explain in time.
Act swiftly,
step out of the maze,
and await the immortals’ selection.

Again—
Youth fleets like a loosed arrow,
stealthily exchanging rosy cheeks for age.
Now I see through it all,
startled as if from a dream.
Shedding the prison of the body,
I trust in wild songs and absurdities.
All men speak,
yet one careless slip,
and they become fools.
I laugh with mouth agape,
for worldly customs were ever confining.
Carefree and unmoored,
I wander mountains and rivers at will.
To the ends of the earth,
I find companions in leisure.
On reflection,
these few things
are the truest ease.

**A Sprig of Plum Blossoms**
The body drifts like a white cloud, free to furl or unfurl.
To the shores of the sky and sea,
unfettered and unbound.
The vastness of the Great Void is my dwelling,
no envy for kings or nobles,
their jade disks and carriages.
In leisure alone I find abundant joy.
Let others fuss over livelihoods,
their lives refined and tempered.
When I return, what is the truth of it all?
The moon of the heart shines bright,
its light piercing Penglai’s isles.

**Two Willow Branches**
Suddenly awakened to true emptiness, I cast off external attachments,
delighting in purity and leisure.
Through the four seasons, I stoke the inner fire and circulate the celestial cycle,
cultivating fields of magic mushrooms.
Before the sacred altar and mysterious furnace, I partake in creation,
drinking from the spirit spring.
In the radiant halls of the sun, I dwell eternally,
attaining the golden heavens.

Again—
The two luminaries rush like whirling marbles,
racing across the heavens.
They drive men to toil like mountains,
never resting.
Like cats enamored of flame, they cannot be dragged away,
stubborn and foolish.
Surveying the mortal world, all are thus—
how pitiful.

**Treading the Clouds**
Formless in appearance,
with the luminous mind as my hand.
On the shores of purity, I plant golden willows.
Cutting away demons and monsters, I ride a crane through the clouds,
in the silence of the empty mountains, I whistle and roar.
Beyond the kalpas, I soar,
walking the wondrous path.
In the boundless realm, I seek kindred spirits.
After drinking, I am at ease, intoxicated by the true wind,
the universe vast and clear, utterly without obstruction.

**Powdered Butterflies**
I long to speak of heaven’s mysteries,
but alas, in this dusty world, no one believes.
Only because they lack the predestined affinity.
Enamored of fleeting splendor,
greedy for the fiery pit,
their qi and spirit are depleted.
They trade their bodies like goods,
losing the original seal of the heart-mind.
Once awakened and turning back,
I delight in purity and leisure,
no need to trouble the heart-mind.
Strive to seek the wondrous mystery of the mysterious female.
Refining pure yang,
startling the cosmos with a thunderous roar.
When the time comes,
I shall meet you in the assembly of Penglai.

**Two Jiangshenzi Lyrics**
Who in the world does not love fleeting glory?
Wealth and fame,
two burdens on the shoulders.
Seeing through them, I return,
proudly spending my remaining years in the forest.
Ten thousand acres of mist and rosy clouds are my true companions,
aged apes and cranes,
waters and winds clear.

Let the world’s riders gallop in the dust.
I bar my wicker gate,
sitting in oblivion.
In leisure alone,
the slanting sun lights my window.
I ask—where are my kindred spirits?
In the vastness of the Milky Way,
distant mountains green.

Again—
Zhuang Zhou’s butterfly dream—how many awaken?
Principles perfected and bright,
my remaining years resolved.
I plan to age in fields and gardens,
proudly tilling at the valley’s mouth.
The setting sun and western wind blow fallen leaves,
clouds return to the peaks,
rain clears.
A few cries of evening cicadas in the tall willows.
Faint mist stretches,
wild springs pour forth.
A thousand miles of passes and rivers,
autumn colors fill the mountain city.
In this murky world, few have discerning eyes.
Who remembers me,
nurturing my distant years?

**Green Jade Case**
In a flash, I grasp the path to long life,
level and without coming or going.
All dharmas perfectly fused, transcending the six perfections.
Beyond the kalpas of sound,
how many have ever arrived?
There is another realm of carefree wandering.
Within the realm of luminous clarity, no dawn or dusk.
Who can recommend this pivotal phrase?
Wooden horses neigh in the wind,
mud oxen in the void—
compassionate clouds spread wide,
the thunder of the Dharma roars high,
silently showering the heavens of Chan.

**Two Hymns to the Sage’s Advent**
Spring’s light is radiant,
yellow orioles leave the valleys,
purple swallows return to their nests.
I see immortal peaches blooming, two or three branches,
asking the emerald bamboo and fragrant thatch.
Zither and books by my high pillow,
the wicker gate tightly shut,
allowing no one to knock.
Let the pine pavilion bask in the sun for three poles,
and the butterfly dream linger on the flower branches.

The Daoist’s secluded charm,
the flavor of leisure and ease,
clouds and mist in the forest.
At night, I play the zither in reclusion among the green peaks,
watching the moon’s reflection in the cold spring.
Carefree melodies sung,
the palace tunes of returning home,
snowy songs without strings.
Have I gathered this mysterious pearl yet to ascend the origin?
To become an immortal dwelling in the world.

**Longing for the Immortals**
Awakening from drunkenness,
awakening from dreams,
the moon soaks the pine window, the pillow cool as mushrooms.
Whose house is that, pounding silk?

Voicing true feeling,
delighting in true feeling,
beyond the bamboo, flowing springs gurgle over stones.
Cloud mountains layer like green screens.

**Two Western Rivers Moons**
The heart-mind is like a bright mirror,
no need to wipe it clean—
it reflects all things as they are.
The Way of the immortals is not far,
only those who seek it find it.
The elixir field is full,
the golden cinnabar mature.
The great medicine is complete,
the golden crow and jade hare meet in the crucible.

Again—
The world’s affairs are like a play,
all is empty and false.
Wealth and status are but floating clouds,
vanishing in an instant.
The body is a guest house,
the heart-mind the master.
If the master is at ease,
the guest is content.
The Way of the immortals is not distant,
only those who cultivate it attain it.
The elixir field is full,
the golden cinnabar mature.
The great medicine is complete,
the golden crow and jade hare meet in the crucible.

**Do Not Envy the Golden Chambers**

Do not envy the golden chambers’ schemes,
nor strive to climb the immortal cassia’s bough.
Once awakened, the heart-mirror needs no polish—
in an instant, the floating illusions of self and things dissolve.

Turn back to illumine the gourd-heaven’s sun and moon,
speak no more of the world’s winds and waves.
Drag your slender jade staff through the boundless void,
and return beyond the deep mist of brambles and vines.

**Again—**

Though form and things dwell within the world,
the dreaming soul ever roams Tai Zhou’s terraces.
With whom shall the mountain hall’s true delight be shared?
Beyond the window, sparse plum and slender bamboo.

Miles of mist and rosy clouds drift softly,
half a curtain of wind and moon sighs cold.
Heaven grants me this pure seclusion—
how could fleeting life ever match it?

**Two Songs of Heart’s Longing**

**I**
Night deepens, the world hushed, the water-clock’s drips fade,
autumn’s hues fill the riverbank.
Cold mist stretches across the wild pond—
who could paint such a scene?

The wind whispers,
the moon arcs thin.
Sitting past midnight’s end,
the incense in the censer spent,
the Silver River’s stars sparse,
the butterfly dream takes flight once more.

**II**
Straw hat and bamboo staff befriend the Southern Flower,
plowing and fishing age my livelihood.
How could I be tied yet go unfed?
My will is no gourd left hanging.

Forget the tapping of the ox’s horn,
recall the twisting of the homeward rope.
Proud among the fisherfolk,
on ten thousand acres of mist and waves,
at the head of the Red Lea Shoals,
drunk, I lie among the reeds.

---

**Lesser Layered Mountains**

Since ancient times, the lofty ones shun the city’s clamor,
transcendent, beyond the dust’s reach, hidden in forests and springs.
I once heard the Sage’s parting words:
*“The benevolent and wise—
in the mountain and water’s cave, they dwell at ease.”*

No affairs vex the heart.
Apes and cranes become friends,
the elixir ripens.
In the depths of white clouds, joy in quiet seclusion—
beneath the bright moon,
a single tune of *Lesser Layered Mountains*.

**Four Songs of the Great Official’s Joy**

**Spring**

**Spring**
Strolling verdant fields, wanderers delight—
rivers and mountains gleam in spring’s warm tide.
From the valley, tender orioles call,
willow floss scatters like drifting snow.

**Summer**
Pomegranate blooms dip in fragrant sachets’ hue,
green lotus leaves unfurl like canopies.
To escape the heat, I ascend the tower—heart clear,
frost-like ripples brush the vast moonlit sky.

**Autumn**
The Double Ninth: a refined gathering on high.
Chrysanthemums just split beyond the bamboo fence.
Who believes the chill of mist-laden waves?
Wind taps red leaves—frost-thinned woods grow spare.

**Winter**
Slanted sparse shadows, soft celestial fragrance,
in jade chambers, night talks stir distant poetic souls.
Pour the crimson flush of wine again and again—
let the six-petaled flakes dance in the wind’s wild play.

---

**Four Songs of the Partridge Sky**

**Spring**
A rustic retreat, joy in idleness,
inspired, I chant a *Partridge Sky*.
Peach blossoms laugh in the sun, unfurling brocade,
doorside willows trail threads of emerald mist.

Latch the flowered gate,
sweep the moss-coins clean.
When weary, on a meditation couch,
pillow books and sleep.
If someone asks what I cultivate—
a dream ferried by the moon, a boat of *Huaxu*.

**Summer**
Idle birds flaunt their tongues toward the lush grove,
bathing in steam, hair unbound beneath pine shade.
A cool breeze stirs, bearing the chill of ice-mushrooms—
I chant my true feelings in carefree verse.

Sky like water,
willows like gold.
Fire-clouds stack in jade from distant peaks.
Perched on a high tower, the noble scion’s ease,
in quiet chambers, the recluse’s heart forgets all schemes.

**Autumn**
Suddenly, the west wind stirs my kudzu robe,
rustling autumn hues blanket all lands.
When buckwheat blooms in ordered rows,
when phoenix leaves fall, marked and tallied.

Crows caw at dusk,
a traveler longs for home.
Across the fields, millet stands thick.
Cicadas, cease your cries from the high branches—
lest the wild geese frown in weary flight.

**Winter**
One night’s bitter freeze brings cruel cold,
dawn reveals six-petaled flakes drifting down.
Crimson clouds dusted with powder, moths in flight,
willow fluff follows the wind, butterflies to and fro.

Plum shadows lean,
bamboo bends low.
A mound of lake-jade leans on the railing.
Who will lend me their painter’s skill,
to capture this scene for the *Huangshan* scroll?

**Narrow Hua Creek**
Narrow Hua Creek,
spring winds treat men as guests.
*Men as guests—*
adrift north and south, when will rest come?
Better to follow the Four Old Men of Shang Mountain,
where stone towers and cloud halls dissolve worldly dust.

On Danqiu’s leisure,
a thousand-foot pine stands guard.

**Flower’s Heart Moved**
Beyond kalpas, the primal sound—
I sigh at this toiling life, so vast, so blind.
Piercing the wheel of rebirth, shattering empty space,
I play freely through the six gates, unattached.

Alone in an orchid canopy, the couch secure,
I watch the iron tree bloom in season.
Wisdom’s light blazes—
in the Great Brightness Hall,
jade dragons coil upon the tiles.

A single mystic pearl leaps forth,
advancing in radiant splendor,
ten thousand spirits tremble with joy.
Released and reclaimed, through reversal and flow,
the snow-curve suddenly unlocks the plain key.

True feelings yearn for expression—yet to whom?
I see womb and egg, dream and soul entwined.
At dawn’s vast expanse,
I hear the painted horn on Phoenix Tower,
the moon’s immortal within.

Through kalpas pure and congealed,
the mirror gleams impartial, flawless—
who is fit to bear its mark?
Void and vast, boundless,
it governs the ten thousand spirits’ transformations,
watching over all with boundless light.
Serene, it enfolds the Great Dao,
its essence unfathomable—fortune and ruin, darkly repaid.
Who can reach its pristine azure?
Still and silent, the nine suns,
idle and still, the depths of mystery.

The Primordial Qi stands vast in the azure heavens,
enveloping the three thousand great thousands,
its divine workings the pivot of all.
Lofty and bright, distant and dim,
it responds to the four seasons’ life and change,
inverting the clear and void.
Wisdom’s wind sweeps beyond the empty sky—
how could the deluded masses ever comprehend?
Now I have deeply penetrated it,
returning to savor the joy of carefree wandering.

**Two Songs of Achievement**

**First Song**
In a flash, dawn breaks—
I see through this floating life,
a mere charade.
The road of gain spurs reckless galloping,
time flies swift,
vainly stirring the passions of aging.
I sing alone, I laugh alone,
pondering how few have ever reached
this fair scene:
the garden of home, spring’s hues,
crabapple half-open, green willows swaying light.

Let go, let go—all things are done.
Listen, deep in the tangled mountains,
the cuckoo’s cry.
Return, ah return!
On Chang’an’s ancient road,
fading glow of scattered clouds at dusk.
Dongting lies hushed—
I sigh as the wind sweeps fallen blossoms
beyond my gate.
Since parting, my old friend,
the phoenix’s song in the azure heavens fades away.

**Second Song**
Awakening to the floating world.

Amid the tumult of ten thousand affairs,
let all be forgotten, cast aside.
A staff of woodbine, a cloud-patterned kerchief,
a hempen belt, a paper-wadded robe—
these alone suffice as traveling gear.
Roaming mountains, wandering waters,
wherever I go, joy follows my will.
In carefree ease, delighting in the moment,
free and unbound—who could match such bliss?

Peer at the world’s currents, observe its ways.
Such is the news, the very pattern of life.
True joy lies in this alone—
if you but grasp it,
when man is still and the moon brightens a thousand miles.
Before my small study, a few stalks of cold herbs.
Who knows me here,
as dawn’s light spills over the western hills,
half the casement steeped in fresh green?
