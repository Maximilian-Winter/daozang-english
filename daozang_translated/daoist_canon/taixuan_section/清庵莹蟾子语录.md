**Preface to *The Recorded Sayings of Master Qing’an Yingchan***

When a master of the Dao first meets someone, he draws forth the words from within that person’s own house—is this not the mark of a true master of the Way?

From youth, I studied the Confucian classics; in my prime, I delighted in discoursing on emptiness. Though I was foolish and lowly, if anyone could speak even a word tinged with the sour scent of the Dao, I would not hold myself above them as a Confucian but would humble myself to seek their instruction. Yet I had never encountered a true master—until one day.

Returning to Mount Mao, I was visited by Master Li of Qing’an Hermitage, the Luminous Toad. No sooner had he taken his seat than he uttered a few words, each one utterly free of the taint of worldly striving. Then he expounded on the *Yi* before Fu Xi drew the trigrams, pierced through the barriers that even ancestral masters had failed to fully transcend, and swept away the superficial words of the Three Teachings until all was stark and bare—opening the blind eyes of us deluded ones to a vision of perfect roundness.

A pure qi enveloped us; harmonious radiance filled the room. Was it that the toad’s grotto had shifted into my own body, or had I secretly entered the grotto myself? That night, I was a thousandfold astonished and overjoyed. Collecting my thoughts, I lit incense in my heart and bowed at the foot of my bed, saying: “This is my true teacher, a true master of the Way.” If the master would not cast me aside, I would humbly receive his warnings and teachings.

Thereafter, I followed the master for many days, and our questions and answers were numerous. They were gathered into this volume, which I unfurl from time to time in reverence. Only when I have overturned the fortress of profound subtleties beneath Qing’an’s seat and shattered the Great Void to atoms will I be a man who has accomplished the task.

At that time, if someone were to step forward and ask Old Qing’an: “What use is this relic here?”—he would surely reply: “It is the very target I struck when I first met a master.”

Respectfully inscribed on a day of heavy summer rains in the *wuzi* year of the Zhiyuan era,
Guangchan of Moyin Hermitage, a Daoist of Mount Mao, bows his head in reverence.

**Record of Questions and Answers**

Master Dadian’s *Commentary on the Heart Sutra* states: A monk asked Master Cen, “How does one purify the two rats gnawing at the vine?” Master Cen replied, “People of this age must conceal themselves.” Someone dared to ask, “What does ‘conceal oneself’ mean?” The Master said, “Why wait for withering and decay before knowing emptiness? One must, in this very moment, be unattached to every thing and unstained by every affair. If I do not perceive all phenomena, then all phenomena do not perceive me—this is called ‘concealing oneself.’”

Someone asked, “To speak of it is to fall short, yet in Shandong and Hebei it may still be discussed—what does this mean?” The Master said, “If this matter is to be expressed in words, words cannot exhaust it. The final phrase, vast and boundless, encompasses all—what more is there to say? Even the words ‘falling short’ have already spoken it.”

Someone asked, “Do you recognize this sutra?” The Master replied, “In the western realm of *Gugayānī* and the northern continent of *Uttarakuru*.” The questioner asked, “Why single out these two lines?” The Master said, “I would not put it that way. If someone asked me what this sutra is, I would simply say: a hundred thousand *li* east and west, eighty thousand *li* south and north.”

Someone asked, “‘The great spiritual mantra, the great luminous mantra, the unsurpassed mantra, the peerless mantra’—to what in the Three Teachings do these four lines correspond?” The Master said, “They correspond to the most wondrous of Daoist texts, the most mysterious of mysteries, the unsurpassed and unexcelled, the spontaneous and uncontrived. They also correspond to the Confucian ‘true observation, true illumination, and true victory as one.’ Yet the highest attainment lies beyond words and phrases.”

Someone asked, “When the bodhisattva *Vimalaprabhā* first left the household at the first ground, how did she escape the woman’s trance? Mañjuśrī, the teacher of seven buddhas, could not escape it—why?” The Master said, “Old *Chou’an* put it well: ‘The dog welcomes the guest who once lodged here; the crow guards the fledgling fallen from the nest.’ It is perfectly clear—do not doubt further.”

The Master asked me, “Because Mañjuśrī could not escape the woman’s trance, he summoned *Vimalaprabhā* to investigate the Dharma-gate of non-duality. Mañjuśrī said, ‘Do not move—if you move, you will receive thirty blows.’ How do you understand this?” As I was about to deliberate, Master Ding’an stirred, inadvertently triggering the mechanism, and I presented this to the Master. He approved.

The Master said, “The mud-snake at the bottom of the well dances the *Zhezhi*; the bright moon at the window illuminates the plum and pear. How do you understand this?” After a long pause, I replied, “A melody blown from the hollows shatters the empty flowers in the eye.” The Master said, “Not so.” I then said, “The skull cracks open—only I remain; the eyes bulge forth—nothing else exists.” The Master said, “Closer.”

Someone asked, “In the old case of the two monks rolling up the blind, one succeeded and one failed—what does this mean?” The Master said, “The benevolent see it as benevolence; the wise see it as wisdom.”

Someone asked, “A monk asked Mount Jia: ‘What is the Dharma-body?’ Jia said, ‘The Dharma-body is without form.’ The monk asked, ‘What is the Dharma-eye?’ Jia said, ‘The Dharma-eye is without flaw.’ Daowu heard this and refused the monk further audience. Later, when Boat Monk returned and raised the same exchange, Jia answered as before: ‘This time, there is a lion.’ Master, both questions and answers were the same—why was the first rejected and the latter accepted?” The Master said, “The moon in the clouds is the same, but the streams and mountains differ.”

The Master said, “Someone asked Dongshan about the precious mirror samādhi and the five positions. The secret verse says: ‘The central within the partial, the partial within the central; from the central it comes, to the partial it arrives, and in the combined it reaches.’ How does one investigate these five?” I answered, “The central must not be fixed as central, nor should the partial be seen as partial; the partial must not be fixed as central, nor should the central be displayed as central. When the central returns to the center, the partial also arrives at the center; when partial and central unite as one, all is center—then the combined is reached. At this point, partial and central are both forgotten, and only the center remains.”

The Master said, “Almost—but one must grasp the meaning within movement and stillness.”

One day, the Master sat with four others. He said, “Old Chuan said, ‘It is mind, is not mind, is not not-mind’—how would you put it?” All answers were unsatisfactory. I said, “It is mind, yet not; it is not mind, yet not.” The Master asked, “How is it so?” I gave a shout. The Master said, “Hold it well.”

The Master asked, “What is the Dao?” I struck the table. He then asked, “What is the person of the Dao?” I struck it again. The Master said, “Almost.” I shouted in response. The Master said, “Eight moments too late.”

Someone asked, “Thirty spokes share one hub—how is this to be understood?” The Master said, “Spokes and hub are merely the body of the vessel. Only when spokes converge at the hub does the cart become functional. This is like thirty days sharing one moon to fulfill the function of illumination, or the myriad dharmas returning to emptiness to fulfill the function of nature—all are the same.”

Someone asked, “‘Those who follow life are thirteen; those who follow death are thirteen.’ Many interpretations exist—Master, please clarify for me.” The Master said, “Those who follow life are the harmonious union of water and fire; those who follow death are the discord of water and fire. Water forms the number six, fire the number seven—six and seven together make thirteen. The ancients said: ‘Seven and six make thirteen, the spring colors of the lunar palace.’ Some say it refers to the seven emotions and six desires combined—this is somewhat plausible. Others explain it through the eight trigrams and five phases—this is incorrect. Have you not heard the lower scripture say: ‘The rigid and strong are followers of death; the soft and weak are followers of life’? Rigidity and strength arise from anger and desire; softness and weakness mean curbing anger and restraining desire. When anger and desire arise, fire blazes upward and water dampens below—water and fire are in discord. When anger and desire cease, yang descends and yin ascends—water and fire are in harmony. What doubt remains?”

Someone asked, “‘Between heaven and earth, is it not like a bellows?’—empty yet inexhaustible, moving yet ever-producing.”

Could the revered bellows embody the wondrous workings of heaven and earth’s creation? I humbly seek your enlightened explanation.

The Master replied: The *tuo* is a bottomless sack, and the *yue* is a three-holed flute—together, they form the bellows. This metaphor illustrates how heaven and earth, in their boundless emptiness, contain all subtle principles, just as the human mind, in its emptiness, remains luminously aware. “Inexhaustible” describes its unobstructed, flowing nature; “ever-producing” speaks to its limitless responsiveness to change.

Someone asked: What is meant by “morning *tun*, evening *meng*”?

The Master said: Qian and Kun, Kan and Li form the framework, while the sixty-four hexagrams revolve and transform within it. The cycle begins with *Tun* and *Meng* and concludes with *Ji Ji*, serving as the model for the fire-phase. The alchemical texts take Qian and Kun as the crucible, Kan and Li as the elixir ingredients, and the remaining hexagrams as the mechanisms of transformation. The sixty-four hexagrams, with their three hundred and sixty lines, correspond to the three hundred and sixty days of the year. Starting from the winter solstice, the sequence begins with *Tun* and *Meng*, and ends with *Ji Ji* on the final day of Great Snow. In terms of a single month, it begins with *Tun* and *Meng* on the first day and concludes with *Ji Ji* on the last day of the month. For a single day, it starts with *Tun* and *Meng* at the hour of *zi* and ends with *Ji Ji* at the hour of *hai*. In terms of practice, a moment’s effort seizes the seasonal rhythms of an entire year—beginning with *Tun* and *Meng* and concluding with *Ji Ji*. Thus, “morning *tun*, evening *meng*” is merely a general term. Those who grasp this principle complete the celestial cycle in an instant, with all hexagrams contained within. As the ancestral masters said: “Within the hexagram without lines, Qian and Kun are already determined.”

Someone asked: What is meant by “nurturing the golden goose within the precious vase”?

The Master replied: From the perspective of non-action, this is two separate koans. From the perspective of action, it is a single process of cultivation. Let us first address the non-action approach. A monk asked Master Zhaozhou: “Does a dog have Buddha-nature?” Zhaozhou said: “Yes.” The monk asked: “Then why is it born into this?”

Zhaozhou said: "No."
The monk asked: "Why not?"
Zhaozhou said: "Because it is utterly devoid."

An ancient master also said: "When the gosling in the vase becomes a goose, how does it emerge from the bottle?"
These two koans are ones that many today cannot pass through. If someone can offer a single turning word, their study of the Dao is complete.

Speaking now from the perspective of action: the dog represents "being within non-being," "yang within yin." The dog that guards the minister’s tent prevents internal theft. "Nurturing the golden goose within the precious vase" refers to "gold within water," "elixir within the furnace." To nurture the golden goose is to nurture the sacred embryo. When the sacred embryo matures, it is like the gosling in the vase. That the vase breaks and the goose emerges is common worldly reasoning. That the goose emerges while the vase remains unbroken—this is the marvel of shedding the embryo. Thus, the ancestral masters said: "Within the brocade tent, the jade dog is concealed; within the precious vase, the golden goose is nurtured." Is this not the wonder of the golden elixir?

Someone asked: "Abandoning one’s wife and recklessly severing yin and yang—what does this mean?"
The Master replied: Master Ziyang said: "Without true lead, do not retreat to the mountains." This statement closely resembles those of today’s Dao-seekers, who, misled by false teachers, receive some method and immediately claim to have attained the Dao. They abandon their wives and children, retreat into the mountains, and when their practice yields no results, they grow remorseful—some return to secular life, others remarry. Such people are numerous. Then there are the ignorant and unlearned who, failing to grasp the sages’ principles, claim that abandoning one’s wife is not the Dao, instead pointing to women as cauldrons, or asserting that women’s bodies contain medicine, or designating the birth canal as the place of rebirth. This is a path of great disorder. The ancestral masters originally instructed the world: if one cannot extinguish desire, merely abandoning one’s wife is futile. Seeing that students misconstrued their meaning, they later added: "Naturally, there is a cauldron to refine dragon and tiger—why cling to home, wife, and children?" Today’s unlearned fixate on the first line, entirely neglecting the latter—truly, they are offenders.

Someone asked: "My teacher once said that those who refine the elixir must not fixate on years, months, days, or hours. Why, then, does he also speak of gathering medicine according to dawn and dusk?"
The Master replied: This aligns with the meaning of *Tun* and *Meng*, though its application differs slightly. The advent of spring and autumn marks the year’s dawn and dusk; the waxing and waning moons mark the month’s dawn and dusk; the hours of *yin* and *shen* mark the day’s dawn and dusk; the moment of yin-yang union marks the body’s dawn and dusk. Comprehending the Way of day and night, one understands the principle of yin-yang’s ebb and flow. Tracing the causes of darkness and light, one grasps the discourse on life and death. The great essentials of buddhas, immortals, and sages all lie herein.

Someone asked: "That which cannot be seen is called *xi*; that which cannot be heard is called *yi*; that which cannot be grasped is called *wei*. Is this the same as or different from 'seeing without perceiving me, hearing without attaining, transcending all extremes—this is called the wondrous Dao'?"
The Master replied: They appear broadly similar, but their principles differ fundamentally. The former describes the essence; the latter, its function. *The Doctrine of the Mean* states: "Be cautious of what you do not covet; be fearful of what you do not hear. Nothing is more visible than the hidden, nothing more manifest than the subtle—thus the noble person is ever vigilant in solitude." Only when one sees where "I" cannot be perceived, hears where nothing can be attained, and transcends all extremes can it be called the wondrous Dao. If one merely says that what cannot be seen is *xi*, what cannot be heard is *yi*, and what cannot be grasped is *wei*, what extremes remain to be transcended?

Yin Yu asked with delight: "The year has twelve months, with the *zi* month among them; the day has twelve hours, with the *zi* hour among them. Where is the *zi* hour within the human body?"
The Master replied: "Attain utmost emptiness, guard perfect stillness—then the myriad things arise together, and I observe their return." Does this not describe it?
Yin said: "When *gui* is born, if the hour stirs, it must dissolve—what does this mean?"
The Master replied: "Indeed."
Yin further asked: "The Primordial One suspended a precious pearl five *zhang* above the earth. How is this to be understood?"
The Master said: "How would you explain it?"
Yin replied: "Five is a yang number."
The Master said: "No. Five *zhang* above the earth signifies separation from the five defilements. Within the realm of profound emptiness, it is the concealment of spirit in the wondrous."
Yin said: "Above the five defilements lies the gate of the Mysterious Female, does it not?"
The Master replied: "Though so, without genuine effort and direct realization, merely speaking of such imagery—what use is it?"

Someone asked: "Heaven and earth are not benevolent, treating the myriad things as straw dogs; the sage is not benevolent, treating the common people as straw dogs. Why use such a base analogy?"
The Master replied: Heaven, earth, and the sage do not regard benevolence as benevolence, thus they view the myriad things and the common people as insignificant, likening them to things that live and die on their own. Though they live and die on their own, they ultimately return to the root and restore their mandate. *The Book of Changes* states: "Manifesting benevolence, concealing its function, it moves the myriad things without sharing the sage’s concerns." This is the meaning of "heaven and earth are not benevolent, treating the myriad things as straw dogs." *Qian* bestows great benefit upon the world without declaring what it benefits—how vast! This is the meaning of "the sage is not benevolent, treating the common people as straw dogs."

Someone asked: "[Laozi speaks of] the infant who has not yet learned to smile; Mencius speaks of the great person who does not lose their childlike heart. Are these the same?"
The Master replied: "They are the same. This describes the great simplicity not yet dispersed—its return is not far."
Someone asked: "Laozi said: 'The Dao as a thing is only vague and indistinct. Indistinct yet vague, within it there is something; vague yet indistinct, within it there is an image.'"

"Profound and obscure, within it there is essence; this essence is utterly real, within it there is sincerity." Why, among these three, does he speak only of "this essence being utterly real, within it there is sincerity"?

The Master replied: "The sage speaks of 'a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth.' This 'born before heaven and earth' is the manifest image of the Dao. The image becomes manifest through heaven and earth; heaven and earth are formed in chaos through this thing; the thing is congealed by the wondrous union of the two and fivefold essences. Thus, the two and fivefold essences are the substance of the Dao. The image and the thing are the function of the Dao."

Someone asked: "The passage on being 'cautious and apprehensive where nothing is seen'—the four lines beginning with 'to see yet not perceive me'—are a most apt analogy. If one could illustrate this even more aptly with Confucian sayings, I would be grateful if you would add a word."

The Master replied: "The first two lines describe being in a place where no one is present, yet constantly maintaining sincerity. The latter two lines describe being face-to-face with others, yet always guarding against unforeseen intentions. Consider how 'the burden of heaven is without sound or scent'—its sincerity cannot be concealed. Is this not the subtlety of what is hidden and manifest? Though the burden of heaven has no sound or scent to be heard or known, the principles of heaven shine clearly, and its sincerity cannot be concealed."

Someone asked: "What does it mean that 'anxiety, regret, and shame reside in the minute'?"

The Master replied: "The minute refers to 'my heart is not like stone, unturnable.' In every movement of mind and stirring of thought, first reside in the minute. With great stability in the minute, even the slightest movement will show its first signs—how could there be regret or shame? The key is to be forewarned."

Someone asked: "Are 'three days before *jia*' and 'three days after *jia*' the same as 'three days before *geng*' and 'three days after *geng*'?"

The Master replied: "They are not the same. *Gu* means disorder. To awaken before it arises is to prevent disorder. To awaken after it has arisen and then remedy it means disorder can still be saved. If one does not awaken, the disorder becomes severe. *Jia* means the beginning. Awakening three days prior is called 'before *jia*'; awakening three days after is called 'after *jia*.' Awakening too long after three days is not true awakening. 'Before *geng*' and 'after *geng*' refer to the *xun* hexagram’s nine in the fifth place. *Xun* is wind, the mandate of heaven. When mandates are altered, the people do not trust them—only after the *si* day do they come to believe. If three days before the change, one first announces the advantages and harms, and then implements the reform, the people will follow and trust it. Then, three days after the change, one again admonishes them, so they gladly do good. From *jia* to *wu* and *ji* is the center; *geng* passes the center. Passing the center means change, hence it is called *geng*. *Geng* means reform and renewal."

The Master said: "If it cannot be spoken of as the Dao, then how is the Dao to be explained? Quickly, speak of the Dao!"

I repeated this to him, and the Master assented.

The Master said: "What cannot be spoken of, what cannot be named—how would you explain it?"

I replied: "I could explain it, but I fear my understanding is shallow and superficial. I would be grateful if you would speak of it."

The Master said: "What emerges from spontaneity cannot be spoken of. The Dao originally has no name; this is called the unnameable name. What emerges from the Dao is the Dao that can be spoken of; only then can it be named the nameable name. What cannot be spoken of or named is the beginning of heaven and earth. What can be spoken of and named is the mother of the myriad things. To see its beginning, constantly be without desire to observe its subtlety. To see its mother, constantly be with desire to observe its manifestations. Subtle and profound, it begins in the beginningless. Manifest and bounded, it appears in what can be seen. These two emerge from the same source but have different names; together they are called the profound."

The Master said: "In the past, I sat in attendance before Master Shian. The Master asked me to compose a couplet: *'The essence pass, the spirit pass, and the qi pass—three passes converge as one.'* I responded: *'Heavenly sounds, earthly sounds, and human sounds—ten thousand sounds all resound.'* The Master changed *resound* to *clarify*. What would you compose?"

I replied: *"Gentle fire, fierce fire, and wisdom fire—all fires complete the work."*

The Master then said: "I have a couplet: *'Awakening the later-awakened with prior awakening.'* What would you compose in response?"

I replied: "By external observation to observe internal observation."
The Master said: "Change *by* to *return*—it would be better."

On the winter solstice night, the Master said: *"As the first yang returns, the former kings closed their gates at the solstice."*
What would you compose in response?
I answered: *"The six lines complete Kun; the noble person thus cultivates their work in due time."*
The Master approved.

One day, the Master addressed the assembly: *"The prior sages’ *Yi* of the heart is the later people’s heart of the *Yi*.*
Each of you, compose a couplet."
I answered: *"My body’s spirit and qi are fundamentally the primordial qi and spirit."*
Zhai Zai said: *"The true nature of the Great Beginning—is it not today’s true nature?"*
The Master said: "I have a couplet of my own; all of you, listen carefully."
The Master said: *"The scriptures of the lesser-born are originally the same as the Laozi’s treasury of scriptures."*
None could match it.

The Master asked: *"The lungs correspond to metal, and metal is inherently sinking—why then does it float?
The liver corresponds to wood, and wood is inherently floating—why then does it sink?"*
None could answer.
The Master said: *"The lungs receive qi and thus contain yi; wood is within, so they float.
The liver receives qi and thus contains geng; metal is within, so it sinks.
In terms of hexagrams: Dui is metal, and metal’s nature is to sink. Yet metal generates the water of the northern first line as Kan, and the true fire within Kan flames upward—thus it floats.
Zhen is wood, and wood’s nature is to float. Yet the solid line below Zhen arises from wood generating the fire of the southern second line as Li, and the true water within Li descends—thus it sinks.
In terms of medicinal substances: lead is metal, inherently sinking, yet it rises when exposed to fire—thus it floats.
Mercury is wood, inherently floating, yet it falls when exposed to water—thus it sinks.
In terms of symbolic images: the moon belongs to Kan, inherently sinking, yet it floats when fire is applied.
The sun belongs to Li, inherently floating, yet it sinks when the talisman is withdrawn.
The ancients said: *'At the pond’s bottom, the sun glows red and yin demons vanish'—sinking due to water.
*'At the mountain’s peak, the moon shines white and medicinal sprouts renew'—floating due to qi.
In sum: metal is hollow and thus floats; wood is solid and thus sinks. This is what is meant."*

The Master said: *"Host within host, guest within guest, guest within host, host within guest.*
What do you make of this?"
None grasped the mechanism.
Zhai Zai said: *"The body beyond the body is host within host; the dream within a dream is guest within guest.
Passion within nature is guest within host; nature within passion is host within guest."*
The Master said: "That is somewhat closer."
I answered: *"I have only myself; he speaks of another, yet when he comes to employ me, I in turn command him—this is the meaning."*
The Master said: "Not yet thorough."
I replied: *"Beyond the heart there is no heart—host within host.
Within thought arises thought—guest within guest.
Awareness before movement—guest within host.
Awareness after movement—host within guest."*
The Master said: "It would be more precise to speak in terms of movement and stillness:
*In stillness at its utmost—host within host.
In movement upon movement—guest within guest.
Abiding firmly within movement—guest within host.
Scattering within stillness—host within guest.*"

The Master asked: *"Qian has four virtues; how many does Kun have?"*
I answered: "Kun also has four virtues."
The Master said: "Not entirely satisfactory.
Kun’s *yuan heng li* are the same as Qian’s, but the word *zhen* differs. Only after yielding and following does it become *zhen*—hence it is called the *zhen* of the mare.
The mare is gentle and yielding, yet moves with vigor."

The Master asked: *"How many virtues does Zhun have?"*
I answered: *"Its words—*yuan heng li zhen*—are the same as Qian’s, but its virtues differ."*
The Master asked: *"In what way do they differ?"*
I pondered but could not respond.
The Master said: *"If its virtues were the same, it would not be Zhun’s difficulty.
The *yuan heng* here means *yuan* possesses the meaning of great penetration.
*Li zhen* means benefit lies in steadfast correctness; without correctness, it would not suffice to escape Zhun’s difficulties.
Where is the penetration in that?
Only by firmly guarding the *yuan*’s penetration can one overcome Zhun’s difficulties."*

The Master asked: *"'In the southwest one gains companions; in the northeast one loses companions'—what does this mean?"*
I pondered but could not answer.
The Master smiled and said: *"You do not yet understand."*

Herein lies the principle: when the yin class gains yin companions, the yin qi grows ever more abundant, leading only to deeper delusion—thus it is called "losing constancy." Yet when one reaches the yang position of the northeast, the yin companions are lost, and so "steadfast correctness brings good fortune." As yin follows yang, the principle of generation and completion is fulfilled—thus it is called "gaining constancy." If one severs it with resolute intent, from where could thoughts arise? When the passions of thought are cut off, one loses those companions—this too is called "gaining constancy." Without the utmost clarity in all under heaven, who could attain this?

The Master asked: *"Why are all six lines of Qian auspicious?"*
I replied: *"Because of the attainment of its humble yielding."*
The Master said: *"Yet all lines speak of humility, while the fifth line does not—why is this?"*
I answered: *"The fifth is the position of the ruler. If it were overly humble, it would lose its authority. Thus it is said, 'There is benefit in employing military force—nothing is not advantageous.' Therefore, those who cultivate the true Way must balance firmness and flexibility, never leaning excessively toward softness."*

The Master asked: *"What is meant by 'Before Heaven, do not oppose; after Heaven, accord with the celestial seasons'?"*
I replied: *"That which precedes birth is 'before Heaven'—thus there is nothing to oppose. That which follows birth is 'after Heaven'—thus there is something to accord with."*
The Master said: *"One should take the 'prior awakening' as an analogy for the natural arising of the precelestial, and the 'later awakening' as an analogy for the unavoidable arising of the postcelestial. That which arises naturally does not oppose the heavenly principle; that which arises unavoidably, I dare not oppose Heaven—thus it is called 'according with the celestial seasons.'"*

The Master said: *"Joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure before they arise are called 'the Center'; when they arise and all strike the proper measure, it is called 'Harmony.'"*
He then tested us: *"When desire arises but has not yet arisen—where does one meet it?"*
After a long silence, someone answered.
The Master said: *"That is already arisen."*
I remained silent.
The Master said: *"That is not yet arisen."*
Another answered.
The Master approved, saying: *"Keep this for your own use, lest you blind the eyes of later learners. Only those who awaken on their own may truly apply it."*

*Record of Qing’an Yingchanzi, Scroll One—End*
*Record of Qing’an Yingchanzi, Scroll Two*

**Compiled by Disciple Ding’an Zhao Daoke**
**Essentials of the Daoist Mind**

Qing’an transmitted the *Convergence of Dao and Virtue* to Daoke, whereupon all disciples partook of the Dharma-milk and glimpsed the profound purport beyond words. Now, having gathered the recorded dialogues of these disciples into one volume, I share it with those of like aspiration, that they may awaken through mind-to-mind transmission—hence the title *Essentials of the Mind*.

The Master said: *"This character ‘Dao’ belongs neither to the realm of speech nor to the realm of no-speech, neither to the realm of form nor to the realm of no-form. How do you all understand it?"*
Ding’an said: *"Bah!"*
He’an shouted.
The Master said: *"This character ‘virtue’ belongs neither to cultivation nor to non-cultivation. How is this so?"*
He’an said: *"Acting through non-action."*
Ding’an raised the point.
The Master said: *"All Dharma-heirs, abandon the samādhi of language and bring forth your own scripture."*
He’an traced characters in the air; Cheng’an struck with his fist.
The Master said: *"The final line of the first chapter reads: ‘Mysterious and again mysterious, the gateway of all wonders.’ It is said that the thirty-six revered scriptures all issue from this scripture—yet from whence does this scripture itself issue? Apart from the mouth born of your parents, utter one phrase."*
He’an made the gesture of opening a sutra.
Ding’an shouted.
The Master said: *"The second chapter states: ‘Being and non-being give rise to one another.’ Now, apart from the phrase ‘being and non-being,’ how else might it be expressed? If you can speak it, you plunge into hell like an arrow; if you cannot speak it, you plunge into hell like an arrow."*
All raised the question, yet none struck the mark.
Cheng’an asked: *"How is it?"*
The Master said: *"Thus. Thus."*

The Master said: *"The closing line of the third chapter reads: ‘Act through non-action, and nothing remains ungoverned.’ If it is non-action, why speak of ‘action’? If what is above is action, how then can ‘non-action’ be spoken of below?"*
Ding’an said: *"Substance and function both complete one another."*
Wei’an said: *"This function—yet apart from this function."*
The Master said: *"The fourth chapter’s line, ‘Before the image of the Lord,’ wears out the tongue with speech and bursts the eyes with staring. To hold light within and remain silent—this is precisely when the staff should fall. How do you all understand it?"*
Li Jianzhai raised the question; Shi’an drew a circle.
The Master said: *"The fifth chapter: ‘Between heaven and earth, is it not like a bellows?’"*
The Master chanted:
*"Bottomless, it is called the bellows;
Three-holed, it is called the flute.
Within, a single aperture—
None can lay a finger on it.
For you I blow forth soundless music—
But how is this ‘aperture’ to be grasped?"*
He’an said: *"Evening turns to gaze upon the nostrils."*
Shi’an said: *"A hum."*
The Master asked: *"And what is this ‘soundless music’?"*
He answered in their stead: *"A song drifting through the azure void."*
The Master said: *"The sixth chapter: ‘The gateway of the Mysterious Female.’"*
The Master said: *"The out-breath touches no myriad conditions; the in-breath dwells not in the yin realm. Neither out nor in—how is this to be understood?"*
He’an said: *"Still and unmoving."*
The Master himself said: *"All sounds hushed to clarity."*
The Master said: *"The seventh chapter: ‘Is it not because it is selfless that it can perfect its self?’ This is to say: the cultivator acts only for the self, which is private; universally delivering all beings belongs to emotion. How is the phrase ‘not belonging to private emotion’ to be spoken?"*
Ding’an said: *"Put others before oneself."*
The Master said: *"The eighth chapter: ‘The highest virtue is like water.’"*
The Master said: *"Lay down this droplet, and the Yellow River may run clear several times. But where is this droplet to be laid?"*
Ding’an and He’an raised the same question.
The Master said: *"The ninth chapter: ‘Achieving merit, attaining fame, withdrawing the body—this is the Dao of Heaven.’ But where does one withdraw to?"*
Ding’an said: *"A shout into the void leaves no trace."*
He’an said: *"Nowhere to go."*
The Master said: *"Neither is correct."*
Someone asked: *"Then what is it?"*

The Master said: *"Two feet gallop like a bellows beneath the Northern Dipper."*
The Master said: *"The tenth chapter: ‘Bearing and nurturing the po.’"*
The Master said: *"The po delights in galloping, in movement, in strength and courage—by what method can it be governed? If one governs with intention, it belongs to emotion; if without intention, it cannot be governed. How is it to be governed?"*
He’an snapped his fingers once.
The Master said: *"The eleventh chapter: ‘Thirty spokes share one hub; it is the void at its center that makes the cart useful.’ But when the spokes do not converge at the hub, where is the cart?"*
He’an said: *"Turning round and round."*
Ding’an made a pushing-cart gesture.
The Master said: *"The twelfth chapter: ‘The five colors blind the eye.’"*
The Master said: *"Depart from form, depart from appearance, and the eyes are blinded—how do you all understand this?"*
He’an said: *"Seeing as if not seeing."*
The Master said: *"The thirteenth chapter: ‘Value the great affliction as you do the self.’"*
The Master said: *"With a self, there is affliction; without a self, how can the Dao be perceived? In the end, how is this to be resolved?"*
Ding’an said: *"Lay it down."*
He’an said: *"Nurture its formlessness."*
The Master said: *"The fourteenth chapter: ‘Look at it and it cannot be seen.’"*
The Master said: *"Without seam or fissure—how do you all understand this?"*
Shi’an said: *"Like an egg, perfectly whole."*
The Master said: *"Not so."*
Someone asked: *"Master, how do you say it?"*

The Master said: *"Face to face, yet unrecognized."*
The Master said: *"The fifteenth chapter: ‘Subtle, mysterious, and profoundly penetrating—deep beyond all measure.’"*
The Master said: *"With water, one probes with a staff; with people, one probes with words. With the Dao, what does one probe?"*
Ding’an and He’an both raised their fists.
The Master said: *"A single gesture suffices."*

The Master said: *"The sixteenth chapter: ‘Attain utmost emptiness, abide in perfect stillness; as the ten thousand things arise together, I observe their return.’"*
He pressed: *"To return is to see the heart of Heaven—yet where does the heart of Heaven reside?"*
He added: *"Move not—if you move, thirty strokes."*
Ding’an seized the staff.

The Master said: *"The seventeenth chapter: ‘Of the highest, those below know only that it exists.’"*
The Master said: *"Neither bound to form nor to formlessness—how does one see one’s own highest nature?"*
None of the disciples responded.
The Master said: *"Even now, it is here, expounding the Dao."*

The Master said: *"The eighteenth chapter: ‘When wisdom emerges, great falsity arises.’"*
The Master said: *"Cleverness obscures the great root; wisdom destroys celestial truth—how do you all understand this?"*
Zhi’an said: *"Non-action."*
Sun’an said: *"Wisdom is not as good as foolishness."*

The Master said: *"The nineteenth chapter: ‘Abandon sageliness, discard wisdom.’ How do you all understand this?"*
Ding’an said: *"Forget its origin."*
The Master said: *"The twentieth chapter: ‘Abandon learning, and there is no sorrow.’"*
The Master said: *"What do you all call ‘abandoning learning’?"*
He’an said: *"Chasing the wind, grasping at shadows."*
The Master said: *"To learn non-learning overturns the errors of the multitude."*

The Master said: *"The twenty-first chapter."*
The Master said: *"Is there truly a thing with form, with appearance, with sentience? If you say it comes, then examine it with the eye of study; if you say it does not come, go and examine it with the eye of study. In the end, how is this to be resolved?"*
He’an said: *"Neither existence nor non-existence touches it—only the one true reality."*
Sun’an drew a circle.
The Master said: *"The twenty-second chapter: ‘That which is bent becomes whole; that which is crooked becomes straight.’"*
The Master said: *"The tree that is useless lives long; the goose that is useless is cooked—how is this to be understood?"*
None answered.
The Master said: *"Useful or useless, each follows its time."*

The Master said: *"The twenty-third chapter: ‘Sparse words are natural.’"*
The Master said: *"Silent, wordless—this falls into the second mechanism. What is the first mechanism?"*
None of the answers hit the mark.
The Master said: *"To open the mouth is not a matter of the tongue."*

The Master said: *"The twenty-fourth chapter: ‘One who stands on tiptoe does not stand firm; one who strides cannot walk.’ How do you all understand this?"*
Ding’an said: *"To lift the foot is not a matter of the heel."*
The Master said: *"The twenty-fifth chapter: ‘There is a thing, formlessly formed.’"*
The Master said: *"What thing is this?"*
Ding’an raised an example.
He added: *"‘Within the realm, there are four great things.’ Is there anything even greater?"*
He’an shouted.

The Master said: *"The twenty-sixth chapter: ‘Lightness loses the minister; haste loses the lord.’"*
The Master said: *"Neither light nor hasty—how then?"*
Ding’an said: *"The Dao flourishes, the times are clear."*
He’an said: *"Preserving nature, ever abiding."*

The Master said: *"The twenty-seventh chapter: ‘Good conduct leaves no trace.’ Do you all understand?"*
He’an said: *"A man of great power lifts his foot yet does not rise."*

The Master said: *"The twenty-eighth chapter."*
The Master said: *"To guard the dark, the feminine, the humble—this is function. The boundless, the great uncarved, the infant—this is essence. When the uncarved is scattered, it becomes vessels."*
*"How do you all understand this?"*
Ding’an said: *"Life after life, transformation upon transformation."*

The Master said: *"The twenty-ninth chapter: ‘One who would take the world and act upon it—I see they will not succeed.’"*
*"I say this is mistaken. Where then does the Dao lie?"*
Ding’an said: *"In the act itself."*

The Master said: *"The thirtieth chapter: ‘One who assists the lord with the Dao does not dominate the world with force.’"*
The Master said: *"If bandits arrive, how will you resist?"*
He’an said: *"Transform them with virtue."*
The Master said: *"Better to defend them with compassion."*

The Master said: *"The thirty-first chapter: ‘Fine weapons are instruments of ill omen.’"*
The Master said: *"Without weapons, there is no defense against enemies; to use weapons is not the Dao—what then?"*
Ding’an said: *"Moving against the current, flowing with change."*

The Master said: *"The thirty-second chapter: ‘The Dao is ever without action, yet the uncarved block, though small, none in the world dare claim as subject.’"*
The Master said: *"How do you understand the line ‘though small’?"*
Ding’an said: *"A mustard seed holds Mount Sumeru."*
He’an said: *"Lowly yet uncrossable."*

The Master said: *"The thirty-third chapter: ‘One who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.’"*
The Master said: *"What is that which does not perish?"*
He’an said: *"Within nothingness, there is something."*
Mi’an said: *"Empty and numinous, never obscured."*

The Master said: *"The thirty-fourth chapter: ‘The sage does not exalt himself, thus he fulfills his greatness.’"*
The Master said: *"What is ‘not exalting oneself’?"*
He’an said: *"Vigorously, from the pearl’s mouth it enters."*

The Master said: *"The highest good is like water."*
The Master said: *"The thirty-fifth chapter: ‘Grasp the great image.’"*
The Master said: *"If you say there is an image, it is not great; if you say there is no image, how can it be grasped?"*
He’an said: *"A millet-grain holds a world."*
The Master said: *"This still refuses to acknowledge its greatness."*

The Master said: *"The thirty-sixth chapter: ‘To gather it, first expand it.’"*
The Master said: *"The eyebrow has already passed the eyelash—where then has the error gone?"*
Ding’an said: *"Right where it is."*
He’an said: *"Do not let it wander recklessly."*
The Master said: *"One phrase suffices to pass it."*

The Master said: *"The thirty-seventh chapter: ‘The Dao is ever without action, yet nothing is left undone.’"*
The Master said: *"My verse says: ‘All action is illusion; non-action falls into emptiness. Neither path is trod—now offer a line.’"*
He’an said: *"Face to face, yet they do not meet."*
Zhi’an said: *"Abide firmly in the center."*
Mi’an said: *"Naturally, there is great spiritual power."*
The Master said: *"Here, the school’s essence is revealed."*

The Master said: *"The thirty-eighth chapter: ‘Highest virtue does not act as virtue—thus it has virtue.’"*
The Master said: *"What is called ‘virtue’?"*
He’an said: *"Not claiming possession of what one has."*

The Master said: *"Not self-aggrandizing."*
The Master said: *"The thirty-ninth chapter: ‘Of old, those who attained the One: Heaven attained the One and became clear.’"*
The Master said: *"Where then does attaining the One reside?"*
He’an said: *"It resides where there is no action."*
The Master said: *"Better where there is no use."*

The Master said: *"The fortieth chapter’s final line: ‘The myriad things of the world are born from being; being is born from non-being.’"*
The Master said: *"Beyond being and non-being, what else is there?"*
He’an said: *"There is this—take it as an example."*

The Master said: *"The forty-first chapter: ‘When the inferior scholar hears the Dao, he laughs greatly at it.’"*
The Master said: *"What is he laughing at?"*
He’an raised an example: *"Laughing at this."*
Mi’an said: *"Laughing at non-action."*

The Master said: *"The forty-second chapter: ‘Some are diminished yet gain; some gain yet are diminished.’"*
The Master said: *"When neither diminished nor gained—how then?"*
He’an said: *"No lack, no excess."*
The Master said: *"Refine the undifferentiated."*

The Master said: *"The forty-third chapter: ‘The softest under heaven gallops through the hardest under heaven.’"*
The Master said: *"When touched, do not contend; when the affair passes, the heart is cool. What is the realm of coolness?"*
He’an said: *"Without heat or affliction."*
The Master said: *"Without ignorance."*

The Master said: *"The forty-fourth chapter: ‘Name or self—which is dearer? Wealth or life—which is greater?’"*
Chuan Lao said: *"If you can bring forth the treasure within your home, the weeping crows and mountain flowers are equally fresh. What is the treasure within the home?"*
He’an said: *"Li-li-lo."*
Ding’an shouted.
The Master said: *"First, compassion."*

The Master said: *"The forty-fifth chapter."*
The Master said: *"The previous chapter says: ‘Knowing contentment avoids disgrace; knowing when to stop avoids peril’—this is called constant sufficiency. This chapter says: ‘Great perfection seems flawed; great fullness seems empty’—this is insufficiency. Which is sufficiency, which is insufficiency?"*
Dun’an and Zhi’an said: *"Pride invites loss; humility receives benefit."*
The Master said: *"One whose virtue is abundant yet appears insufficient lives long; one whose wealth is abundant yet appears insufficient is noble. Thus it is said."*

The Master said: *"The forty-sixth chapter: ‘No crime is greater than desire.’"*
The Master said: *"Not seeing what is desirable keeps the heart from chaos. Hurry back—half is saved. What of the other half?"*
Ding’an said: *"Never leaving where one is."*

The Master said: *"The forty-seventh chapter’s final line: ‘Without seeing, it is named; without acting, it is accomplished.’"*
The Master said: *"What is named? What is accomplished?"*
Ding’an and He’an both said: *"Virtue is accomplished; the Dao is named."*

The Master said: *"The forty-eighth chapter: ‘In learning, each day something is added; in cultivating the Dao, each day something is lost.’"*

The Master said: *"To benefit others is extreme; to harm others is extreme."*
Ding’an said: *"Harm oneself to benefit others."*
He’an said: *"Diminish the passions to nourish one’s nature."*
The Master said: *"The forty-ninth chapter."*
*(Text missing)*
The Master said: *"The fiftieth chapter: ‘Those who follow life are thirteen; those who follow death are thirteen.’"*
The Master said: *"The heart of nirvana is easy to grasp, but the wisdom of distinction is hard to fathom. What is the wisdom of distinction?"*
The assembly gave no answer.
The Master said: *"The benevolent call it benevolence; the wise call it wisdom."*
The Master said: *"What is the heart of nirvana?"*
The assembly gave no answer.
The Master said: *"No past lies ahead; no present lies behind."*
The Master said: *"The fifty-first chapter: ‘The Dao gives birth to it; virtue rears it.’"*
The Master said: *"Gives birth to what? Rears what?"*
Shi’an said: *"To give birth and to rear—it is simply this."*
The Master said: *"Examine it closely."*
The Master said: *"The fifty-second chapter: ‘The world has a beginning, which is taken as the mother of the world.’ The first chapter says: ‘That which can be named is the mother of the myriad things.’ What is this name?"*
None answered correctly.
Cheng’an asked: *"What is it called?"*
The Master called out to Cheng’an.
Cheng’an responded.
The Master said: *"The name is settled."*
The Master said: *"The fifty-third chapter: ‘If I were to have even a little knowledge, walking the great Dao, I would fear only straying.’"*
The Master said: *"Fear what?"*
He’an said: *"Fear the Mandate of Heaven."*
The Master said: *"The fifty-fourth chapter: ‘Observe the state by means of the state.’"*
The Master said: *"Observing the state is not easy; observing the self is even more profound. Though the sea may dry up, its depths are seen; when a person dies, the heart remains unknown. Is there one who knows the heart?"*
None answered aptly.
Cheng’an asked: *"Master, do you know the heart?"*
The Master replied: *"Who is asking?"*
The Master said: *"The fifty-fifth chapter: ‘One whose virtue is profoundly abundant is like a newborn child.’"*
The Master said: *"This aligns with Mencius’ saying that the great person does not lose the heart of a child. But is the heart of a child already manifest or not?"*
He’an said: *"Pure and undivided."*
Ding’an said: *"Still and unmoving."*
The Master said: *"Not entirely so—how could you not know that ‘returning is the function of the Dao’?"*
The Master said: *"The fifty-sixth chapter: ‘The knowing do not speak; the speaking do not know.’"*
The Master said: *"Is speaking correct, or is not speaking correct?"*
None answered precisely.
The Master said: *"The mouth given by father and mother will never serve its lord."*
The Master said: *"The fifty-seventh chapter: ‘Govern the state with uprightness; deploy troops with strategy; take the world through non-interference.’"*
The Master said: *"How can one take the world without interference? Without interference, how can one take the world?"*
The assembly gave no response.
The Master said: *"Guide them with virtue."*
The Master said: *"The fifty-eighth chapter."*
The Master said: *"The final line: ‘Radiant yet not dazzling’—how do you understand this?"*
The assembly was silent.
The Master said: *"Wearing coarse cloth while holding jade."*
The Master said: *"The fifty-ninth chapter: ‘In governing people and serving Heaven, nothing compares to frugality.’ How do you understand this?"*
Zhi’an said: *"Thrift."*
The Master said: *"Follow thrift."*
The Master said: *"The sixtieth chapter: ‘When the Dao is applied to the world, its ghosts lose their numinosity.’ How do you explain this?"*
He’an said: *"They have no means to display their abilities."*

Ding’an said: *"Evil does not encroach upon the upright."*
The Master said: *"The sixty-first chapter: ‘A great state is the lower reaches of a river.’"*
The Master said: *"Casually extending the hand of non-action, without stirring the blades of war, peace is secured. What is called the hand of non-action?"*
He’an said: *"Overturning the Three Teachings."*
Cheng’an said: *"Shattering the void."*
The Master said: *"The sixty-second chapter: ‘Can one with crimes be spared?’"*
The Master said: *"Where does the fault lie?"*
Ding’an said: *"Seeking the fault, it cannot be found."*
The Master cast aside the scripture and said: *"Cease this doubt."*
The Master said: *"The sixty-third chapter: ‘Plan difficulty at its ease.’"*
The Master said: *"To speak of ease is not easy; to speak of difficulty is not yet difficult. In this wondrous and extraordinary place, pray continue the line."*
He’an said: *"It is simply within the midst."*
Shi’an said: *"It never departs from the Mysterious Pass."*
The Master said: *"The Northern Dipper faces south."*

The Master said: *"The sixty-fourth chapter: ‘What is secure is easily maintained.’"*
The Master said: *"How do you all understand this?"*
He’an said: *"Guard against the subtle and block the gradual."*

The Master said: *"The sixty-fifth chapter: ‘Those of old who were adept in the Dao did not use it to enlighten the people but to make them simple.’"*
The Master said: *"All dharmas of action—three thousand six hundred gates—once thoroughly examined from the start, are but the toying of spirits. Only I alone embrace the Unnamed Unhewn, and countless demons topple their red banners. Do you all understand?"*
Ding’an said: *"To recognize a single thing is already amiss."*
He’an cast aside the scripture.
The Master said: *"The sixty-sixth chapter: ‘The reason rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys is that they excel in lowliness.’"*
The Master said: *"Now tell me: do the rivers and seas lower themselves to the hundred valleys, or do the hundred valleys lower themselves to the rivers and seas?"*
He’an said: *"Gathering and scattering all return to the One."*
Ding’an said: *"The superior yields; the inferior complies."*
The Master said: *"Lower, lower, lower."*

The Master said: *"The sixty-seventh chapter: ‘Abandoning kindness, one becomes reckless; abandoning frugality, one becomes extravagant; abandoning deference, one becomes presumptuous—this is death.’"*
The Master said: *"Do not drink the water of ignorance. Now, what is called the water of ignorance?"*
Ding’an said: *"Sinking in level ground."*
He’an said: *"Waves rise without wind."*
The Master said: *"The sixty-eighth chapter: ‘One adept as a warrior is not martial.’"*
The Master said: *"Neither civil nor martial, neither gain nor loss, touching the nose, the whole body breaks into sweat. Now, before father and mother were born, where was the nose?"*
Ding’an said: *"Where exhalation and inhalation occur."*
He’an said: *"Where opening and closing take place."*
Shi’an said: *"Just beneath the eyebrows."*
The Master said: *"The sixty-ninth chapter: ‘In the use of arms, it is said: I dare not act as host but act as guest.’ Now, how are host and guest distinguished?"*
None answered.
The Master said: *"Who are you, and who am I?"*
And again: *"Two eyes face two eyes."*

The Master said: *"The seventieth chapter: ‘My Dao is very easy to know, very easy to practice.’ Why then is it said that none can know it, none can practice it? If one can turn a phrase here, the work of study is complete. If not, continue your inquiry."*
Ding’an said: *"The hundred clans use it daily yet do not know it."*
He’an said: *"It is right before one’s eyes, yet people do not recognize it."*
The Master said: *"Only because it is greatly evident."*

The Master said: *"The seventy-first chapter: ‘To know yet think one does not know is best; not to know yet think one knows is a flaw.’ How is this flaw to be cured?"*
He’an said: *"The inch of heart remains undarkened."*
None of the disciples’ answers were apt.
The Master said: *"I shall stabilize it with the Unnamed Unhewn."*
And again: *"Otherwise, you will swallow a red-hot iron ball whole."*
And again: *"The inferior scholar must take medicine to purge the evil knowledge."*

The Master said: *"The seventy-second chapter: ‘When the people do not fear authority, great authority arrives.’ What is great authority?"*
He’an said: *"The great matter of life and death."*
The Master said: *"Impermanence is swift."*

The Master said: *"The seventy-third chapter: ‘Courage in daring leads to killing; courage in not daring leads to life.’"*
The Master said: *"What is the mechanism of killing and life?"*
None answered.
The Master said: *"Like a king wielding a sword."*

The Master said: *"The seventy-fourth chapter: ‘To hew in place of a great craftsman, few do not injure their hands.’ How do you understand this?"*
Ding’an said: *"Not the proper artisan."*

The Master said: *"The seventy-fifth chapter’s final line: ‘Only one who does not make life his purpose is wiser than one who values life.’ How do you all understand this?"*
Ding’an said: *"Because there is no ground of death."*

The Master said: *"The seventy-sixth chapter: ‘In life, the people are supple and weak; in death, they are stiff and strong.’ How do you understand this?"*
Ding’an said: *"The supple and weak are companions of life."*

The Master said: *"The seventy-seventh chapter: ‘The Dao of Heaven diminishes the excessive to supplement the deficient; the Dao of man diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.’ Now, when neither diminishing nor supplementing occurs, what is it like?"*
None answered.
The Master said: *"Neither surplus nor lack—just right when casually grasped."*

The Master said: *"The seventy-eighth chapter: ‘One who bears the state’s misfortune can be king under Heaven.’ How do you understand this?"*
None answered.

The Master said: *"Without taboos."*
The Master said: *"The seventy-ninth chapter: ‘In reconciling great resentment, there must remain residual resentment—how can this be called good?’ How do you explain this?"*
Wei’an said: *"Restraining oneself is good."*
Ding’an said: *"Restraining oneself and returning to propriety."*
He’an said: *"Compassion and forbearance are good."*
The Master said: *"All have grasped the point."*
Someone asked: *"Master, what do you say?"*
The Master said: *"Forgetting both kindness and resentment."*

The Master said: *"The eightieth chapter’s final line states: ‘The people, even to old age and death, do not visit one another.’ How do you explain this?"*
He’an said: *"Abiding in their homes."*
Ding’an said: *"Without contention."*
The Master said: *"The inner realm does not extend outward; the outer realm does not enter in."*

The Master said: *"The eighty-first chapter: ‘The Dao of the sage is to act without contending.’ What is ‘without contending’?"*
None answered appropriately.
The Master said: *"Lay the temple’s banner pole flat."*

The Master then said: *"Each of you compose a couplet embodying the two characters ‘Dao’ and ‘virtue.’"*
He’an said:
*"The Dao stores all functions;
Virtue manifests in all benevolence."*

Ding’an said:
*"The Dao does not lie in cultivation;
Virtue does not lie in seeking."*

Wei’an said:
*"The Dao is not non-existence within non-existence;
Virtue is not existence within existence."*

Shi’an said:
*"The Dao that can be spoken is not the Dao;
The highest virtue does not act as virtue."*

The Master said:
*"The Dao is still and unmoving;
Virtue responds and thus pervades."*

And again:
*"The Dao is pure, tranquil, luminous;
Virtue is humble, yielding, compliant, and harmonious."*

The Master said: *"Each of you compose a couplet attesting to the ‘non-action’ of the two characters ‘Dao’ and ‘virtue.’"*
None answered.
The Master said:
*"The Dao raises a fist;
Virtue bows in reverence."*

The Master pointed to the candle and said: *"Each of you compose a couplet revealing this candle’s essence and function."*
He’an said:
*"Its essence fills and shatters the void;
Its function illuminates and dispels darkness."*

Shi’an said:
*"Its essence is perfectly round;
Its function shines brilliantly."*

The Master said:
*"Its essence is thusness, unmoving;
Its function shines, luminous and all-encompassing."*

And again:
*"Its essence props up heaven and supports earth;
Its function illuminates heaven and shines upon earth."*

The Master said: *"Each of you compose a couplet without words, revealing the candle’s essence and function."*
None answered.
The Master demonstrated, and the assembly had an awakening.

**The Recorded Sayings of Master Qing’an Yingchan, Volume Three**
*Compiled by Zhitang Shi’an and Miao Shanshi*

**Entering the Gate of Zhonghe Hermitage**
A silver mountain, an iron wall—
by whom was this built?
Pass through this barrier,
and there is no opening nor closing.

How then to break through this barrier?
The Master struck the ground with his staff and said:
*"Hmph! Enter the Hall of the Sages here."*

No sooner is the Golden Portal spoken of as a transformed body
than the celestial mechanism is already revealed,
and the adornment of external appearances
becomes but another scene of defeat.

What then is to be done?
*"Bah! To behold the golden full-moon visage,
all must step forward together."*

**On the Sage**
The Sage is most compassionate, most benevolent, most numinous, most holy,
holding the gate of life and death,
enacting execution and issuing decrees,
stirring the turbid and lifting the pure,
driving out evil and aiding the upright.
Evil goes unpunished; good meets no response.

Yet such vast spiritual power is manifest.
If one begs for life from the hands of Qing’an,
having already received it—what then is there to bow for?
*"Hmph! Because I receive reverence, who dares not show respect?"*

**Winter Solstice Ascending the Hall to Expound the Scriptures**
After ascending the seat, offering incense, and reciting the invocations,
the Master raised his staff and said:
*"The Dao is originally wordless;
I too have little to say.
But with this staff,
sometimes it is the substance in my hand,
sometimes it is the function in my hand."*

He held the staff horizontally and asked:
*"Is this substance or function?"*
After a long pause, he continued:
*"In function, it props up heaven and supports earth."*

This staff possesses unfathomable spiritual power,
its wondrous uses beyond measure.
The moment it is raised,
the boundless flying heavenly deities, the Immortal Kings of the Ten Directions,
and the countless hosts of the Great Longevity Spirits
all stand in submission.
Even the Most High Lord Lao comes to the tip of the staff to beg for life.

Why? *"Once the authority is in hand, the command is issued."*

He raised the staff and said:
*"Behold, all of you!"*
He struck once and said:
*"Strike once—strike the void into □ leaps!"*
He stirred it once and said:
*"Stir once—stir the primordial chaos into dense fusion!"*
He drew a line and said:
*"Draw once—draw open the fences of the Three Teachings!"*
He tapped once and said:
*"Tap once—tap through the nostrils of all!"*

Though it possesses such vast spiritual power,
not a single one in the entire world has it ever struck.
Why?

The Pure Hermitage’s staff strikes not the dullard.
With a shout, he asks:
*"Is there anyone who wishes to taste the rod’s bite? Step forth then."*
The True Hermitage emerges, bows, and asks:
*"When snow falls at the Winter Solstice, what is its meaning?"*
The Master replies:
*"This question drips water that freezes solid—
it cannot be taken as an auspicious sign,
yet it cannot be dismissed as inauspicious.
Without the root of learning’s heel, it is no propitious omen.
Without the eye of accumulated study, how then to see it?"*
Hmph!
*"The earth’s thunder shakes as the solitary yang arrives,
the White Maiden and Azure Lad meet in the Crimson Palace.
The song ends, the wine runs dry, clouds and rain disperse—
shattered jade scatters wildly across the void.
Is this not the snow of the Winter Solstice month?"*
Hmph! *"Do not mistake it for mere scenery."*
Why?
*"No need to seek the Winter Solstice beyond the city walls—
within the body, a single bowel stirs to life.
In the year, there is the year’s Winter Solstice;
in the month, the month’s Winter Solstice;
in the day, the day’s Winter Solstice;
in the hour, the hour’s Winter Solstice.
The Festival of the Solitary Yang is the year’s Winter Solstice;
the first day of each month is the month’s Winter Solstice;
the midnight hour is the day’s Winter Solstice.
Now tell me—what is the Winter Solstice within the body?"*
The True Hermitage says:
*"Pray, Master, grant instruction."*
The Master replies:
*"When the moon reaches the heart of the sky,
when the wind brushes the water’s surface—
both hold the same pure savor,
yet few indeed are those who know it."*

Do you understand?
The disciple replies: "Yes."
The Master says: "Yet I fear there may still be those who do not fully grasp it—recite again the chapter *To the Utmost Void*?"
The disciple replies: "I can recite it."
The Master says: "First, recite the opening four lines."
The disciple recites:
*"To the utmost void, hold fast to stillness;
the myriad things arise together,
I thereby observe their return."*

The Master says: "Confucius said: *'Thunder lies within the earth—Return. The former kings, on this solstice day, closed the passes, forbade merchants and travelers from moving, and the lords did not inspect their domains.'* This refers to the ancient sage-kings who, on the Winter Solstice, closed the gates, halted all commerce and travel, and bade the people attain emptiness and preserve stillness, awaiting the return of the new yang. Once the new yang returns, the four seasons proceed in order, and the five grains flourish. When people, at the time of the yang’s return, maintain tranquility—keeping the inner realm from leaking outward and the outer realm from intruding inward—they await the yang’s return. Once the yang returns, the four elements are at peace, the hundred bones are in harmony—this is the Way of long life and enduring vision.

Now, today is the Winter Solstice with snowfall; merchants and travelers naturally cease their journeys—how could this not be an auspicious sign? Yet though all manner of auspicious signs may appear, none compare to the absence of *you*."

"Recite the next four lines."
The disciple recites:
*"Now, the teeming things,
each returns to its root.
Returning to the root is called stillness;
stillness is called the restoration of life."*

The Master says: "These four lines speak of observing transformation and knowing return. Consider the hexagram *Return*: from *Kun* it returns—*Kun* is stillness, yang is movement. Stillness at its extreme gives rise to movement, and the Heart of Heaven is revealed."

"Recite the next four lines."
The disciple recites:
*"Restoration of life is called constancy;
to know constancy is called illumination.
Not knowing constancy, reckless action brings misfortune."*

The Master says: "If one comprehends these subtle workings, one directly enters the realm of true constancy—hence, it is called illumination. But if, when the yang returns, one remains ignorant and acts recklessly, one will surely lose one’s life—hence, it is called misfortune."

"Recite the next four lines."
The disciple recites:
*"To know constancy is to be all-embracing;
all-embracing is to be impartial;
impartial is to be kingly;
kingly is to be heavenly."*

The Master says: "*All-embracing* means to broadly receive and contain. *Impartial* means to extend universally to all things. When one is utterly impartial and universal, one may become a ruler, a teacher—Heaven and humanity share the same principle."

"Recite the final lines."
The disciple recites:
*"Heavenly is the Dao;
the Dao is enduring.
To the end of one’s days, one does not perish."*

The Master says: "To embody Heaven and unite with the Dao—this is the fullness of the Way of long life and enduring vision. Advancing further from here, one realizes the wondrous truth of the *non-arising dharma patience*. If one recognizes this intimately and directly assumes it, settling into the work of stillness—attaining the utmost void, holding fast to stillness—the Heart of Heaven is revealed. Once the Heart of Heaven is revealed, one radiates great luminosity in that very place, illuminating the three thousand great thousandfold worlds. Within each of these worlds are three thousand great thousandfold lands; within each land, three thousand great thousandfold Dharma gates; within each gate, three thousand great thousandfold wise and virtuous beings; within each being, three thousand great thousandfold retinues; within each retinue, eyes that see the same Heart of Heaven, each radiating the same light, illuminating the three thousand great thousandfold worlds. In this way, all beings on earth breathe through a single nostril.

Only then does one realize that every month, every day, every moment is the Winter Solstice—today’s Winter Solstice is but an ordinary day. An ancient worthy said: *'It is all just an ordinary day—yet the deluded masses stir up a commotion.'* Since it is merely an ordinary day, why do we perform these rituals today? Is it something extraordinary? Though we must follow local customs and add a footnote as convention requires—does anyone understand this footnote?"

Shi’an says: "I do not."
The Master says: "Ask me, then."
The disciple asks: "What is the footnote for the Winter Solstice?"
The Master replies: *"On this mid-winter day, joyous snowfall—may your honored presence be blessed with boundless fortune in all your movements."*
"Do you understand?"
The disciple replies: "Yes."

The Master says: "Since you understand, why do you not bow?"
Shi’an bows.
The Master says: "Wait—there is yet something beyond."
Shi’an asks: "What else is there?"
The Master says: "Qing’an has spoken of it: *Auspicious snow heralds the blessings of this solstitial day.* The assembly leader repeats this: *On this propitious occasion, may celestial fortune descend upon us.* Take care, take care."
Then he descends from the seat and dismisses the assembly.

The Master raises his whisk and addresses the assembly: "The body of the Dao is without form, its name without designation—there is nothing to be said, and even if one speaks, it cannot be expressed. Today, having ascended the seat, I borrow this whisk to preach in my stead. This whisk is not a whisk—it is a troublemaker. Why? The moment it is lifted, it overturns the patriarchs’ doubts, blinds the eyes of the crowd, and provokes disputes. This whisk is all mouth, this whisk is all hands, this whisk is all eyes. Its spiritual powers are unfathomable, its transformations boundless."

He holds it upright: "Look—does it have eyes or not?"
He taps it once: "Listen—does it have ears or not?"
He casts the whisk aside: "Hmm—does it have spiritual power or not?"

The attendant picks up the whisk and hands it back to the Master.
The Master says: "Used thus, yet beyond this use."

After a long pause, he continues: "Mountains, rivers, and the great earth—all rest upon the tip of this whisk. The ten thousand phenomena—all rest upon the tip of this whisk. The three worthies and ten sages—all rest upon the tip of this whisk. Every being in the vast world—all rest upon the tip of this whisk."

He waves the whisk: "Is there anyone here who does not rest upon the tip of this whisk? If so, come forth and let us meet."

The Layman Huang steps forward and says:
"A single thunderclap startles like a thunderbolt,
Shaking the cold stars across the heavens."

He addresses the Master: "What is the message of the returning yang?"

The Master traces a circle in the air and asks: "Do you understand?"

Huang replies: "I do."

"What then of the yang within the body?"

The Master flicks his whisk and shouts.

Huang says: "I accept it directly."

The Master says: "Just proceed thus."

Huang bows in gratitude: "Had my teacher not revealed it, I would have nearly missed the birth of yang."

Dai Jiayan asks: "For the most part, it is just an ordinary day,
Yet it stirs the masses into confusion.
Why is it called the Winter Solstice?
And though it is said yang is born, why does snow fall? What is the meaning of this?"

The Master says: "The great earth lies level,
Heaven and earth share one hue—do you understand?"

Dai replies: "I do not."

The Master says: "Come closer, and I will tell you."

Dai approaches the Master.

The Master says: "Though snow blankets a thousand mountains white,
The solitary peak stands tall and unchanging."

Dai bows in gratitude and withdraws.

The Master says: "I have a hidden saying for you all to contemplate.
The sutra states:
'Vague and indistinct—within it there is an image;
Indistinct and vague—within it there is a thing.'
Now, what is this thing?"

If one among you penetrates this, then drag Li Qing’an down from the dharma seat, beat him to death, dig a deep pit, and bury him thick with earth—let no trace remain—it would not be excessive. If you fail to penetrate it, then Li Qing’an will bury you instead. Should this still not suffice, I shall add another annotation.

A verse says:
I have a single thing—
It can be small, it can be vast.
In essence, it is one with the great void;
In function, it pervades the dharma realm.
Lift it, and heaven cannot contain it;
Set it down, and earth cannot bear it.
Those who see it startle with bulging eyes;
Those who hear it split their skulls asunder.
If a Daoist grasps this, the three mountains of Peng Island tremble;
If a black-robed monk grasps this, the lineage of Cao Stream is held in hand.
With it, govern the state—state is at peace, people prosper;
With it, aid the Dao—times are clear, the Dao flourishes.
Were one to speak of its value, its worth would be ten thousand taels of gold;
Yet if one meets a true connoisseur, it is sold without a single coin.
Why without a single coin?
Not for profit—only for joy.
Now I raise it before you and ask:
Do you understand, or do you not?

Shi’an says: I do not.

The Master says: Never mind understanding or not—today, you buy and sell it yourself.

He molds a round image and says: Look—within the seam of these two hands, plucked forth, it is naturally fragrant.

**On the Birthday of the Supreme Lord Lao, Ascending the Seat**

The Master ascends the seat and says: The Supreme is without peer, yet abides in daily use. Pity those without learning, who merely speak of emerging from the hidden pass. Now, all of you, tell me: Where does the Supreme reside?

Hmph! Even now, as he speaks the dharma, do any of you understand? Even if you grasp the meaning at once, you remain a thread’s breadth from Qing’an’s Way. Why? If you say *he* is the Supreme, then what are *you*? You must investigate within yourself to see it intimately.

The Supreme says:
The true and constant Dao—those who awaken attain it.
This is the meaning.

Again, he says: The reason beings do not attain the true Dao is because of deluded mind. When the deluded mind stirs, it gives rise to all manner of karmic conditions. Bound by these conditions, they lose the root of the Dao. Seeing that beings are lost in delusion, the sage establishes various expedient means to guide the world, detaching them from defilements and leading them out of deluded paths—this is why the scripture is composed. The scripture is the path that returns to the Dao.

Those who read this scripture should know: this scripture is but a forced name. In truth, there is nothing to be said, and even if said, it cannot be said. It cannot be grasped, cannot be abandoned, cannot be added to, cannot be diminished, cannot be described, cannot be conveyed to others. It does not belong to discourse, to knowledge, to perception, to hearing, to being or non-being. Do not take it as the mark of reality, do not take it as true emptiness, do not take it as literary meaning, do not take it as annihilation or permanence.

Then how should one who engages with the Dao proceed? Only those who grasp the great image can attain it.

The Supreme says: Grasp the great image, and all under heaven will come. Coming without harm, they rest in great peace. Music and bait may halt the passing traveler, but the Dao, when spoken, is bland and without flavor. Those who perceive the Dao through sound and form cling to impermanent dharmas, which ultimately come to an end. The Dao, when spoken, is bland and flavorless—seen, it is not enough to behold; heard, it is not enough to listen to; used, it cannot be exhausted.

Great indeed are the words of the sage! If one truly trusts this, one can leave behind all marks, end all dharmas, and directly merge them into a single whole—utterly bare, utterly empty—concealing the great sound in silence, hiding the great image in formlessness. Then, naturally, form and spirit are both wondrous, and one unites with the Dao in truth.

Yet how is it that today’s scholars do not seek the master’s intent, but privately speculate, some clinging to literary meaning, others fixating on words? The sage’s purpose in composing the scripture is thus obscured. The unannotated passages in this scripture often differ—this is the reason. Little do they know that the moment one opens one’s foul mouth, ten thousand eight thousand errors arise. The moment one says “the Dao that can be spoken,” it is not the constant Dao. The moment one says “the name that can be named,” it is not the constant name.

Then is the constant Dao unspeakable? Are the five thousand words not the Dao? Is the constant name unnameable? Is the *Daodejing* not a name?

Hmph! The Dao that cannot be spoken—*that* is the Dao. The name that cannot be named—*that* is the name. If you have the eye to see this, your study of the Dao is complete. If not, you merely follow others’ footsteps: the benevolent see it as benevolence, the wise see it as wisdom, the common people use it daily yet do not know it. Thus, few understand the sage’s Dao.

Qing’an spares not his two lips to reveal this to you all. This scroll of scripture is but soiled paper, unfit for wiping. Since it is soiled paper, the five thousand words cannot elucidate the meaning of the unspeakable Dao. It is like a great physician treating illness—prescribing medicine according to the ailment. Once the illness is cured, the medicine is no longer needed. Once the constant Dao is attained, the five thousand words are also useless.

Those who see it thus know: the speakable and nameable are the fringes of the Dao; the unspeakable and unnameable are the Dao’s profound mystery. The named fringe is the Dao’s function; the nameless mystery is the Dao’s essence. The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth; the named is the mother of the ten thousand things. These two emerge together yet bear different names—together they are called the profound. Profound beyond profound—they are the gate of all wonders.

If one can proceed from the named fringe to the nameless mystery, the true and constant Dao is attained. Who but the most utterly empty under heaven could achieve this?

All of you—Qing’an has spoken at length thus far. Is this speaking, or is it not speaking?

All of you who have heard the scripture thus far—is this hearing, or is it not hearing? Those of keen wisdom and insight, if there are those who hear what is not heard, only then do they meet Qing’an’s "speaking of no-speaking." In this way, the Sage’s intent in composing the scripture becomes clear. The opening phrase—it is perfect, complete; cease all doubt.

Someone asks: If the Dao cannot be spoken, and names cannot be named, then why today’s grand ritual—is this not superfluous? The master replies: Not so. The Supreme’s descent on the fifteenth day of the second month is not real—it reveals the meaning of ceaseless generation. Today, celebrating the Supreme’s birth is precisely to illuminate that opening phrase. What superfluity is there? What doubt remains?

All of you—the opening phrase has already spoken itself. What then of the closing phrase? Hmph! The mouth given by father and mother will never serve me.

The master descends from the seat and dismisses the assembly.

The master says: "Seen yet unseen—called *xī*; heard yet unheard—called *yí*; grasped yet unobtainable—called *wēi*. These three cannot be interrogated." I say: Seen yet unseen—called *xī*—is this not formless? Heard yet unheard—called *yí*—is this not soundless? Grasped yet unobtainable—called *wēi*—is this not shapeless?

He raises his whisk and asks: Do you see? He taps it once and asks: Do you hear? If you take this as seeing and hearing, your eye of study is not yet sharp. If you do not take this as seeing and hearing, your eye of study is still not sharp. How do all of you understand this?

Hey An steps forward and says:
Seeing form is not form,
Hearing sound is not sound.
Where the colored body is unobstructed,
One arrives at the city of the Dharma King.

The master says: Leave behind words.
Hey An clenches his fist and says: Look.
He strikes once and says: Listen.
Does this still belong to seeing and hearing?

The master says: Striking emptiness to make a sound.
Hey An asks: Is there more?
The master replies: When you hide the great elephant in formlessness, and conceal the great sound in soundlessness, then come to meet me.

Hey An says: Yes. He bows in gratitude and retreats.

The master raises his staff and says:
The mud ox pants at the moon,
The wooden horse neighs in the wind—
Gazing, it seems to exist, yet no trace is found.
Qing’an’s staff draws the inverted Wondrous Peak.

He continues: To open the mouth is already a mistake—how laborious to raise such things! Hmph! If you seek the August Emperor’s intent beneath the staff, you have not even dreamed of it. Why? The good walker leaves no tracks; the good speaker leaves no flaws; the good reckoner needs no counting rods; the good closer needs no bolts yet cannot be opened; the good binder needs no cords yet cannot be untied.

The ode says:
The step does not depend on the foot,
Grasping things does not depend on the hand.
Touch the tip of the nose—
The whole body is a mouth.

If you can thoroughly investigate this,
The forty-nine days were originally seven sevens.
If you understand it here,
You will know the Supreme spoke the scripture without ever opening his mouth,
And Qing’an raised his staff without ever moving his hand.
If you have not yet done so,
Then work within sound and form—
Is there anyone who understands?
You may not open your mouth,
You may not move your hand.
Leave behind sound and form—
Come forward and meet me.

If you speak, you receive the staff.
If you do not speak, you still receive the staff.

Huang the Layman steps forward, about to open the register, when the attendant says: You may not open your mouth. After a long silence, he stamps his foot once.
The master says: There is more.

Huang coughs.
The master says: Eight *ke* too early or late.

Ding’an steps forward and bows, saying: I beg the master to repeat the teaching.
The master says: You may not open your mouth.
Ding’an raises his fist.
Again he says: You may not move your hand.
Ding’an shouts.
The master says: There is still more above.
Ding’an says: What more is there?
The master says: Among the assembly here today, it would be best to reflect in quietude.

The master descends from his seat. Ding’an follows.
The master seizes him and asks: Where are you going?
Ding’an says: Nowhere to go.
The master says: If you go like this, you may avoid the staff.
Ding’an bows in gratitude.

*Qing’an Yingchanzi’s Record, Scroll Three concludes.*
*(Note: Text may be missing before this line.)*

*Qing’an Yingchanzi’s Record, Scroll Four*
*Compiled by disciple Ning’an Deng Decheng*
*Composed in Weiyang*

The master was in Weiyang composing a line, instructing his disciples to continue with another.
The master says: If any match the rhythm, they may advance a step.

The master says:
Formless, traceless, nameless too,
Upholding heaven and earth from ancient times to now.
Just as Qing’an overturned it all—
Ding’an says: The great thousand worlds all turn to gold.
Wu’an says: Vast and without trace, beyond all seeking.
Fu’an says: Know that the point of entry is found in stillness.
Hei’an says: Transformed, the great earth becomes gold.
Yue’an says: Shattered into nothingness, without a trace.

The master says: Except for Wu’an, all have passed in one stroke.

The master says:
The tripod of heaven and golden furnace refine sun and moon,
The handle of the Big Dipper turns the celestial sphere.
Splitting open chaos, the golden elixir is complete—
Ding’an says: Only then does the true man attain his will.
Wu’an says: The Dao is fundamentally non-action, yet likened to action.
Hei’an says: This is the time before heaven and earth.
Ji’an says: Precisely the moment of transcending the ordinary and entering sagehood.

The master says: Ding’an’s line is supreme.

The master says:
Step forward and overturn the formless,
Lift your head and topple the Great Brahma Heaven.
If someone asks where I dwell—
Ding’an says: Breaking through the golden barrier, unbounded and free.
Wu’an says: A single speck contains the great thousand worlds.
Fu’an says: Hidden in the primordial chaos before the separation of foam.
Heiku says: Neither diminished nor increased, fundamentally natural.
Yue’an says: Only in the space between your brows and lashes.

The master says: Ding’an is first, Fu’an second.

The master says:
Through kalpas, it was ever a single pearl,
Hard as raw iron, soft as butter.
The great thousand worlds have no place to rest—
Ding’an says: Encompassing heaven and earth, the pattern of creation.
Wu’an says: Beyond the Dao, emptiness is inexhaustible.
Fu’an says: Illuminating the void, there is nothing at all.
Pu’an says: Seeing it clearly, there is nothing to seek afterward.
Hei’an says: Filling the void entirely, it is all this.
Aishan says: Boundless pure light illumines the great emptiness.

The master says: None have fully captured it, yet among them, Ding’an and Hei’an come closest.

The master says:
Clinging to non-being or being is not the work,
Abandoning both still falls into emptiness.
Only when neither is relied upon is there unity—
Ding’an says: True being arises from non-being, then subtly flows.
Hei’an says: Neither being nor non-being, only then is there perfect penetration.
Wu’an says: Neither being nor non-being reveals spiritual power.
Fu’an says: Only when the great void is one with the body is the Dao penetrated.

The master says: All come close.

I say: It would be better to silently abide within.

The master says:
Round and complete, a single circle,
Existing before the primordial chaos was divided.
Without stem or root, nothing to grasp—
Ding’an says: Only now is the true trap revealed.
Hei’an says: Present and fully functional in every application.
Wu’an says: Know that when the moon sets, it does not leave the sky.
Fu’an says: Still and unmoving, awakening to the true meaning.

The master says: Hei’an’s line is acceptable.

The master says:
Above, it props up heaven; below, it props up earth,
Yet in the center, a single aperture does not circulate *qi*.
Invisible to the eye, inaudible to the ear—
Ding’an says: Eating and dressing, ever unobscured.
Hei’an says: In every application, never apart.
Wu’an says: Filling the void, even spirits and ghosts fear it.
Sun’an says: How is it different from the void?

The master says: Ding’an’s line is acceptable.

The master further says:
Erect the tripod and dry up the four great seas,
Set the furnace and refine the five Mount Sumerus to dust.
The golden elixir takes form, encompassing the three realms—
Ding’an says: Only then does the true man attain his will.
Wu’an says: The Dao is fundamentally non-action, yet likened to action.
Hei’an says: This is the time before heaven and before earth.
Ji’an says: Precisely the moment of transcending the ordinary and entering sagehood.

The master says: Ding’an’s line is peerless.

The master was at Zhaoyang’s Four Sages Daoist Abbey, refining aspirations with his Dharma kin. These are appended here.

The master says:
Dip the brush-tip and the rivers and lakes run dry,
Grind the ink-stick and the great earth is pierced.
Sealing the void with a single stroke—
Hei’an says: From ancient times to now, misty as clouds and smoke.
Xi’an says: From the tip of the brush, the original heaven is revealed.
Tui’an says: Painting opens the time before parents were born.
Jing’an says: Beyond this mystery, there is no further mystery.

The master says: Jing’an and Tui’an come closest.
Tui’an’s line, if changed to "before the separation of chaos," would be even finer.

The master says:
Little brother An, little toad Chan,
Hidden away, not permitted for outsiders to see.
Last night, opening its mouth to swallow the sky—
Hei’an says: A belly full of cinnabar, the fire blazing.
Jing’an says: Chew it and know the bitter and the sweet.
Tui’an says: The great earth and mountains and rivers lie hidden beneath the tongue.
Yi’an says: A taste of supreme ghee, uniquely sweet.

The master says: All come close.

I say: Swallowing heaven and earth is still not enough.

The master says:
This year, the poor grow poorer still,
Not even room for a needle in the hut.
Poverty comes and goes, endless poverty—
Hei’an says: Only the golden elixir endures through ancient and modern times.
Ji’an says: Through the bones, not a speck of dust remains.
Yin’an says: Stripped bare, the original heart.
Xu’an says: Shedding the skin to see the true heart.
Xi’an says: Refining heaven and earth, all becomes gold.
Wei’an says: Only the whole body is purple gold.
Ding Zai says: Only the divine elixir, a single grain of gold.
The master says: None of these are it.
I answer: The household broken, the people gone, the heart dead.
The master says: Last night, the Yellow Dame gave birth to the infant,
Just emerged from the womb, its form too subtle.
It cannot hide within chaos—
Hei’an says: Return it to the time before the boundless.
Xi’an says: Then, in a grain of millet, recognize the mystery.
The master says: All still miss the mark.
I answer: Beyond the great void, the turning of the celestial pivot.
The master says:
Hearing scriptures and teachings, the task is never complete,
Seeking the mystery apart from the Dharma is also wrong.
Neither departing nor hearing—both are errors—
Hei’an says: Overturn everything, and the work is perfected.
Xi’an says: When hungry, eat; when tired, sleep.
The master says: None have fully grasped it.
I answer: Holding to the center without deviation is the true teaching.
The master says:
Standing at the tip of the pole, the work is hard to complete,
How to take a step forward without moving the feet?
If the feet do not move, how can one reach it?
Hei’an says: The supreme move above is wondrous beyond discussion.
The master says: Lift the skull’s lid and go to court the origin.
The master further says:
Sitting with eyes open, the Dao is hard to achieve,
Closing the eyes, it belongs to yin.
Neither closing nor opening—truly blind fools—
Hei’an says: The whole body is eyes, I know my kin.
Ji’an says: Open one eye to observe the teachings and kin.
The master says: The eye atop the head sees the heart of heaven.
The master says:
If walking on land, one traverses the path,
When the water route comes, one falls into the pit.
Not traversing both paths, how can one attain the Dao?
Hei’an says: A slap across the face—too merciless.
Xi’an says: Originally, the middle way is level and smooth.
The master says: Xi’an comes closest.
I say: Riding the wind back to pay homage to the Three Pure Ones.
The master says:
The gateless barrier is not hard to fathom,
Yet speaking of no gate, there is no barrier.
If there is no barrier, what is there to open?
Hei’an says: Knowing the nest’s pattern, what difficulty is there?
Xi’an says: A single fist shatters the web of doubt.
Xu’an says: Without moving a step, one arrives at Chang’an.
The master says: Xu’an is acceptable.
The master says:
Sitting amidst turbidity, all is yin,
When one awakens, it belongs to emotion.
Neither scattered nor dull—all is defilement—
Hei’an says: Playing the zither to summon the phoenix, naturally clear.
Yi’an says: All conditions extinguished, the great elixir is complete.
Dong’an says: Emptiness and quiescence are rooted in sincerity.
Jing’an says: Releasing the whole body, one naturally attains spirit.
The master says: All fall short.
I answer: Let it be free and at ease, then there is radiance.
The master says:
When the work is done in the depths of darkness,
Guarding even a little wastes the effort.
Not guarding, it becomes vast and boundless—
Hei’an says: This body is wholly one with the great void.
Xi’an says: Within stillness, there is great spiritual power.
Dong’an says: The whole body hides within the great void.
Yi’an says: Silent and unmoving, yet responsive and connected.
The master says: Bring it forth beyond things to display spiritual power.
The master further says:
Last night at midnight, the sun was at noon,
The great beast swallowed the tiger of South Mountain.
Within the clarity of concentration, spiritual power is displayed—
Hei’an says: When the lion roars, who dares insult?
Yi’an says: Shaking heaven and earth, who dares insult?
The master says: Neither of you recognizes this.
I answer: The words make the dragon of the deep rise and dance.
The master says:
Fishing for the moon in water has always been delusion,
Planting lotuses in fire is empty deception.
Rashly seeking heaven expends much effort—
Hei’an says: Not departing from the present, the spiritual power unfolds.
Xi’an says: Without cultivation or verification, the work is complete.
The master says: How does it compare to simply abiding within?
Again he says:
Heaven as the hut, earth as the foundation,
The four directions and eight extremes as the fence.
Within, there is a dull-witted man—
Hei’an says: Alone, he plays with the heart of heaven beneath the moon.
The master says: Better to overturn it all and not dwell.
Again he says:
Before heaven and earth divided, there was the boundless,
Before the boundless, there was the great beginning.
What was the matter before the great beginning?
Hei’an says: Now it is not me, and I am not it.
Xi’an says: Through ancient and modern, only I alone am thus.
The master says: Now, the original body is seen as empty.
The master says:
Last night at midnight, the sun was at noon,
Straight up to the center of heaven, turning the Dipper’s handle.
The turning of the Dharma wheel shakes heaven and earth—
Hei’an says: In the Palace of Great Jewels, truly at ease.
Again he says: The myriad phenomena all come to pay homage.
The master says:
Do not cling to mind or no-mind,
Both minds ultimately do not reach the truth.
Having mind is ultimately a burden—
Hei’an says: Grasping the center, there is truly a cause.
The master says: Forgetting both, one verifies the Dharma-body.
Again he says:
I wield the hand of a killer,
Brandishing the blade that gives life.
I ask you, how to kill and give life?
Hei’an says: Giving life to what was previously dead.
Xi’an says: Severing all birth and death.
The master says: Neither of your blades has an edge.
I answer: The Dharma-king’s decree is here.
The master says:
A radiant, round pearl,
Without boundary outside, empty within.
Gently lifting it, there is no place to set it—
Hei’an says: Alone, it reveals itself, naturally at ease.
Xu’an says: Pervading the sand-realm, the true thusness appears.
Xi’an says: Whether releasing or gathering, all is within it.
Yi’an says: The origin dwells alone within.
The master says: How could you all not be attached?

Ah! Drawing me to dwell within the toad’s moon.
Again he says:
Forged into a searing red iron pellet,
Crimson as the blazing sun, vast as the heavens.
Clamped and fed into every mouth—
Hei’an says: Chewing, one tastes the cool, singular Chan.
Xi’an says: Only when crushed is the full flavor known.
The master says: When liver and bowels rot away, the nature first hardens.

The master says: I play with poetry among the assembly of Dharma kin, yet my true intent lies not in verse but in the Dao. Should one grasp the Dao through poetry, the supreme, perfectly upright wonder is attained.

Now, taking "Turning the Deviant Back to the Right" as the theme and rhyming with *ye zhe*, I compose a quatrain to prove that the theme must not be violated.
Hei’an says:
How laughable, the deluded disciples who fail to know their home—
They hail some false elder as their own father.
Hei’an extends the hand of non-action,
Pointing straight to Chang’an without hindrance.

Shi’an says:
A winding path beside the byway, hundreds of households—
Each mistakes a thief for father.
Now that I’ve called them to turn their heads,
They trust at last the road to Penglai is unobstructed.

Jia’an says:
Three thousand lesser dharmas bloom before the eye—
Take care not to be misled, calling them father.
Seizing by the nose, I drag them back to the great Dao,
Where the bright moon fills the sky, unclouded.

The master says:
To clasp a thief and cry injustice—how lamentable!
With eyes wide open, they still fail to recognize their father.
No wonder Qing’an wields a ruthless hand—
Shattering the heart’s aperture to demand boundlessness.

**Poem Presented to Dongxi**

Where the elixir-path takes root,
Let no external realm intrude.
Once the heart settles into stillness,
Dual forces yield to one another.

Fire of departure refines lead and mercury,
Thunder’s chariot conveys water and metal.
Harmony relies on earth’s receptive power—
Irrigation must draw from heaven’s *ren*.

White snow congeals in the golden crucible,
Yellow sprouts grow like jade hairpins.
These are the true seeds—
Not *xuanshen* in disguise.

**Another Poem**

Grasp the subtlety of hidden mind,
And let thieving rats invade at will.
If one truly believes,
No force is too great to bear.

Vows of compassion vast as the sea,
Skillful means sharp as tempered steel.
Within, the *zi-wu* axis turns;
Without, *ding-ren* is overturned.

Sealed with no lock or key,
Doubt not the gathering of friends.
In the mystery upon mystery,
Only one accords with Zeng Can.

**Eulogy for Magistrate Han’s Request to Praise Patriarch Lü**

This old Lü—
A kind face, a dark heart.
Drifting, soaring,
Unfettered, free.

A sword girded with a green serpent,
The elixir transmitted to the Purple Pole.
Examined closely,
His distinction is clear.

Yet what is this distinction?
Hark!
A divine blade hidden in his sleeve,
Its edge unseen—
Roaming the cosmos,
Known by none.

**Eulogy for Layman Wang’s Request to Praise Master Bao’s Portrait**

This monk—
Stubborn, his back to the staff.
Thirty-six performances,
Each a different guise.

Hmph!
Wait until his face is torn open,
Revealing the true visage beneath.

---

**Eulogy for Layman Zhang’s Request to Praise Hotei, the Cloth-Bag Monk**

This portly fellow—
A thief by trade.
What’s hidden in his cloth bag?
None can tell.

Hmph!
The thief’s heart is ever uneasy—
A smile betrays the truth.

---

**Eulogy for Layman Li’s Request to Praise Patriarch Lü**

What manner of foreigner is this?
Such a strange bearing—
Drifting, soaring,
Twisted, bizarre.

Dwelling in the red dust,
Yet roaming beyond the world.
Once here,
His stolen goods are all exposed.

Where, then, does the thief hide?
Hark!
A green serpent concealed in his sleeve,
A world hidden in a grain of millet.

---

**Eulogy for Shan You’s Request to Praise Patriarch Wang**

This old codger—
A face most unsightly.
Hair sparse as whiskers,
Eyes wide as his mouth.

He claims descent from the Fifth Patriarch,
Yet men call him friend to the Seven Perfected.
How so?
Just look at his mouth.
And if you ask further—
A strike to the back, and he’s upon you.

---

**Eulogy for Layman Zhao’s Request to Praise the Three Immortals**

Master Qing’an—
Yellow and plump, yellow and plump,
Not at all as he seems.
Skilled in nothing,
Yet sustained by others’ offerings.

Do you recognize the truth beneath?

For him, you split open your face,
Yet it becomes no different from empty space.

Jie’an, the pedant, points with his thumb—
A thousand oddities, a hundred grotesqueries.
Having read the books of five carts,
Not a single word does he comprehend.
And why does he not comprehend?
Hark!
Shed the motley of the old comic actor,
To win the indestructible vajra-body.

Mo’an’s realm—
No within, no without.
Vast in embrace, all-containing,
Magnanimous and resplendent.

Cinnabar serves the toad’s use,
The toad embodies cinnabar’s essence.
When cinnabar is perfected, the toad sloughs off,
Its merit equal to the Primordial Beginning.

The zenith of meditation, lustrous and still,
The sea of wisdom, limpid and clear.
One toad bursts forth,
Shining universally upon the insentient.

Hark! Heaven and earth shatter under a hundred pressures,
Revealing alone the great radiance.

**Yi’an’s Eulogy:**
Yi’an’s realm—
No entanglements, no obstructions.

Ah!
From the crown emits a great radiance,
Pervading the three-thousandfold world.

**Eulogy for Li Daishao**
With keen discernment, he corrects his bearing,
Parting the clouds to cultivate the moon.

**On Superior Work:**
All leaks and seepages—
Ah!
Before the perfected one, display your skill,
And in the end, the myriad dharmas all become thoroughly clear.

**Eulogy for Qian Daishao**
Jade comb parts the clouds,
Golden blade carves out the moon.
At the summit, that subtle mechanism—
All is penetrated and made clear.
Ah!
The message before your face,
Unheard, yet revealed within.

**Miscellaneous Eulogies**

**Inscription on the Three Realms Diagram**
Behold this clumsy fellow,
Utterly devoid of resolve.
Half-dead, half-alive,
Still entangled and ensnared.
Ah!
Hurry back in haste—
Yet only half may be saved.

**Inscription on the Meditating Ape**
This brute,
Wild and unruly to the extreme.
Eyes bulging,
Savage nature still intact.
Hark!
Only when its hide is flayed,
Will it roam freely beyond all things, unobstructed.

**Inscription on the Eyes-Closed Ape**
Hark! This furred lump—
What manner of form is this?
Ever raving, ever mad,
A thousand grotesqueries contrived.
Having come to this,
It is caught red-handed in its filth.
Now, where lies the filth?
Ah!
With heart and eyes closed, seated atop the mountain,
Whole in qi, whole in spirit, it wanders beyond the world of things.

**Eulogy for the Black Killing Talisman**
Void as paper,
Mount Sumeru as brush.
Inscribed upon the numinous talisman,
Spirits appear and vanish—
Try asking: how is the killing made alive?

**Eulogy for the Sword**
A blade that slays men,
Brandished horizontally, inverted, raised.
Encounter a buddha, slay the buddha;
Encounter a ghost, slay the ghost.

**Eulogy for the Sesame Cake**
Kneaded into a single mass upon the water,
Shaped into perfect roundness.
Without the skill of fire’s refinement,
How could such true flavor be attained?
Hark!
Plucked forth and offered to you—
No need to grind it between your teeth.

**Eulogy for Malt Sugar**
The juice of yellow sprouts is pressed,
Simmered and tempered by fire’s power.
Sticky as phoenix glue,
Sweet as that heavenly honey.
The dull and clumsy—
Their jaws are sealed shut.
The mighty—
Cannot open their mouths.

**Eulogy for the Gourd**
Endowed with the primordial qi,
Fashioned into such a vessel of the Dao.
Lifted and split with ease,
Whole and perfectly round.
Ah!
Hold it aloft—clearly now,
Beware of misconstruing.
It is said:
This single handle—
Its wondrous function and divine workings unfathomable?
Raised, it veils the sun and covers the sky;
Lowered, the wind stills and the waves subside.

**Eulogy for the Unkempt Sage**
Unkempt head, unkempt head—
What charm does it possess?
A staff dragged aslant,
An iron ox ridden backward.

**Self-Eulogy of True Form**
This face and mouth,
Adheres to no principle.
That which is not yet—
How could it ever have been yours?

Ah!
Call it Li Qing’an,
And you’ve already seen a ghost.

**Eulogy for the Fan**
Perfectly round, a single slice—
Beneath it, the shadows of the ten thousand things appear.
Raised, the bright moon fills the sky;
Waved, a pure breeze brushes the face.
Now tell me—do you see it or not?
Ah!
Ask not whether you see it or not.
For it grants but a single thread of passage—
Flick it once.

**Eulogy for the Elixir**
This thing since time immemorial,
Formless, without substance.
No lack, no excess,
No end, no pause.
Its edge cuts through metal,
Its roundness surpasses the sun.
The Buddhists call it the *Dark Pearl*,
The Confucians call it the *Great Ultimate*.
The Daoists call it the *Golden Elixir*—
Three names, one body.
It lies right before your eyes,
Yet people fail to recognize it.
○ This is it—
No more doubt.

**Two Diagrams for Instruction**

**Eulogy for the Character "藏" (Store)**
Shedding the husk—preserve the primordial form.
Guard the essence—refine into elixir.
Refine the spirit—master the qi.
Prolong vision—abide in spirit.
Nurture growth—stabilize nature.
Form solid—qi numinous—heart luminous.
Essence congealed—spirit settled—root awakened.

**Explanatory Eulogy**
Refine the spirit to temper the form,
Temper the form to guard the essence.
Guard the essence to master the qi,
Master the qi to abide in spirit.
Abide in spirit to stabilize nature,
Stabilize nature to illuminate the heart.
Illuminate the heart to awaken the root,
Awaken the root to make the spirit numinous.
Numinous spirit—qi settled,
Qi settled—essence congealed.
Essence congealed—form solid,
Form solid—longevity attained.
Longevity—vision prolonged,
Vision prolonged—elixir perfected.
Elixir perfected—husk shed,
Husk shed—primordial spirit.
To the right, this eulogy encapsulates the essence of spirit refinement.
To refine the spirit, first refine the essence.
To refine the essence, first master the qi.
To master the qi, first abide in stillness.
Abiding in stillness brings clarity to the heart,
Numinosity to the spirit,
And stability to the qi.
Qi stabilized, essence congeals;
Essence congealed, form solidifies.
Form solidified, the yang spirit sheds its husk—
The Way of longevity and prolonged vision is complete.
The alchemical texts speak of *golden liquid refining the form*,
*Golden liquid returning as elixir*—
None stray from this path.

**Diagram of the Returning Elixir**

**Explanatory Verse for the Diagram**
Within the eightfold golden crucible, the elixir is refined.
Eight is the completion number of wood—
Wood is nature, gold is emotion.
Subduing emotion with nature,
Entering the central palace—
Metaphorically called the *earthen crucible*.
Then, with fire, refine it:
The more it is refined, the more steadfast it becomes,
The more it is refined, the more round and luminous—
Hence the metaphor of the *Golden Elixir*.
Guard it closely within the chambered furnace.
Fire is spirit,
The chamber is the crucible.
The primordial spirit enters the chamber,
Like medicine in the furnace—
Tend it with utmost care,
Lest the slightest error be made.
Lead and mercury, ever prone to flee—
How could one not be vigilant?
A hair’s breadth of deviation,
And no elixir is formed.

Lacking earth, in the Kan palace, Ren and Gui escape.
Earth is Kun—
Kun governs the body.
When the body is still, the tiger roars;
When the body moves, the tiger flees.
The tiger’s roar congeals the essence,
The tiger’s flight scatters it.
"Lacking earth" means the body is unsettled;
"Ren and Gui escape" means the essence is lost.
Scholars cannot afford to be careless.

When the heart stirs, in the nature’s domain, Bing and Ding take flight.
Bing and Ding are fire, belonging to the heart.
When the heart is settled, the dragon sings;
When the heart is restless, the dragon bolts.
The dragon’s song solidifies the qi,
The dragon’s flight scatters it.
"Heart stirs" means the fire blazes;
"Bing and Ding take flight" means the qi disperses.
These two lines illustrate the flight of lead and the escape of mercury.

Where the master abides, yin demons are subdued.
The master is the original true nature,
The indestructible primordial spirit.
"Abides" means the primordial spirit enters the chamber.
"Yin demons subdued" means desires are extinguished.
For those who cultivate the Dao:
When body and heart are still,
Spirit congeals and qi solidifies.

The bright moon and sun—timely treasures radiant.
The sun and moon symbolize the essence of the body.
"Bright" means the essence has congealed.
With deep practice and effort,
Refining it into a single precious treasure,
Its radiance shines through heaven and earth.

The one, two, three—primordial elements merge as one.
Heaven-one generates water—essence.
Earth-two generates fire—qi.
Heaven-three generates wood—spirit.
Essence, qi, and spirit refined into one,
The three and five unite—returning to the root.

Old Man Gold lies dead, embracing the infant.
The character *gold* with *public* beside it is lead.
"Lead dies" means the sea of desire is exhausted,
Passions extinguished,
The sacred embryo formed,
The infant revealed.

One lead, two mercury meet in the three palaces.
One is the generative number of water—essence,
Metaphorically called lead.
Two is the generative number of fire—qi,
Metaphorically called cinnabar.
Three is the generative number of wood—spirit,
Metaphorically called mercury.
The three palaces are where the three primordials reside.

Eastern Sea’s Old Man Gold—refined a hundredfold.
The Eastern Sea symbolizes nature,
Old Man Gold symbolizes emotion—
Another name for lead and mercury.
Emotion returns to nature, refined by fire.
Only through a hundredfold refinement does it become the supreme treasure.

Within the body, the primordial serves as substance and function.
Within one’s own body lies the natural seed—
To seek it externally is folly.
The body’s primordial essence is the function of the Golden Elixir,
The heart’s primordial qi is its substance.

The wood-fluid of the Gen palace is the root and origin.
The Gen palace is earth,
The wood-fluid is mercury—
Together called *mercury within cinnabar*,
The mother of the Golden Elixir.
Lest scholars lack a standard,
These names are provisionally given.

The sun dwells in the moon’s cavern—truly luminous.
"Sun dwells in the moon’s cavern" means yang enters the yin chamber,
Drawing from Kan to fill Li,
Extracting lead to replenish mercury,
The infant and the maiden unite,
Metal and wood merge,
Water and fire commingle.

When the heart dies, the spirit lives—wisdom’s nature flows.
When the heart dies, the spirit lives;
When the spirit lives, wisdom flows.
Thus, those who cultivate the Dao:
The body like withered wood,
The heart like dead ashes,
Utterly still.
With practice perfected,
Wisdom’s nature becomes round and luminous.

When the work is complete and the water dries, lead and mercury conjoin.
When the practice is fully perfected, the sea of desire naturally dries up.
When nature and emotion merge as one, mercury and lead intertwine.
When the fire-phase’s work is accomplished, form and spirit transcend.
Only then does the Golden Elixir take shape.

*A single grain of the Great Elixir shines through heaven’s red—*
The Great Elixir is the Great Ultimate’s perfection.
Not formed from external things, but refined from the original true suchness.
When a person ingests and returns to it, they fruitfully attain the Golden Immortal.

**In cultivating the Dao, first clarify the Three, Two, and One—**
The Three, Two, and One are essence, qi, and spirit.
Not the essence of intercourse, the qi of breath, or the spirit of thought,
But the original essence, original qi, and original spirit.
This must not remain unclear.

**In practicing the work, do not indulge the arising of the heart-mind.**
During the practice, do not let the heart-mind wander.
When the heart arises, fire flares upward; when the heart is settled, ignorance ceases.
Throughout the twelve hours, constantly examine and restrain.

**If people of this age would trust my words,**
Those who study the Dao cling to texts and fixate on images, never attaining clarity themselves.
Laozi said: *My words are very easy to know, very easy to practice,
Yet the world cannot know them, cannot practice them—such is the lack of trust.*

**Strike and unite heaven and earth to house the true master.**
Heaven and earth are body and heart.
Those who truly trust strike and unite body and heart to recognize their original face.
If you meet face-to-face, you will decisively realize no coming, no going.

**Kan-water’s waves surge due to lack of earth—**
Kan-water’s waves surge when essence does not abide.
"Lack of earth" means the body is unsettled.
As the *Elixir Scriptures* say: *True earth restrains true lead.* This is it.

**When the nature-heaven stirs thoughts, the arising heart is born—**
When the nature-heaven stirs thoughts, emotions move within.
"The arising heart" is distraction.
As the *Elixir Scriptures* say: *True lead restrains true mercury.* This is it.

**To establish the mercury furnace, first work with water—**
In setting up the furnace and establishing the tripod, first stabilize essence—hence "first work with water."
When essence is stabilized, qi congeals.
Lead and mercury naturally conjoin.
As the *Elixir Scriptures* say: *Lead and mercury return to the earthen cauldron.*

**Within the cauldron, harmonize and refine the Eight Metals—**
The Eight Metals are emotion and nature.
The cauldron is the Yellow Center.
When nature and emotion return to the center, body and heart become profoundly still.
As the *Elixir Scriptures* say: *Body and heart still and unmoving.* This is it.

**When eyes droop in sleep, work with water-mercury—**
During practice, the demon of sleep disrupts.
In sleep, draw fire from water to attack mercury.

**When the heart’s breath settles, refine the Eastern Metal—**
When body and heart are unmoving, metal and wood merge.
When breath settles, refine—
The one nature becomes round and luminous, all conditions cease.

**The cart moves because the axle turns—I awaken to the heart-mind—**
The cart moves because the axle turns; people move because the heart moves.
When the axle turns, awakening—
One who understands this principle attains perfection.

**The Three Palaces, Two, and One—sun and moon shine bright—**
The Three Origins unite as one; the two substances become round.
The Three Palaces shine—
Bright as the sun and moon, they illumine heaven and earth.

Meng’an said: *Master Qing’an composed these two nested-character and hidden-head poems not to indulge in cleverness,
But to elucidate the substance and function of the Golden Elixir, revealing the subtlest without gap.
The nested-character ode speaks of the Elixir’s substance; the hidden-head poem, of its function.
The hidden-head’s intent expresses the Elixir Dao’s subtlety,
While the self-explication of its details makes the Elixir’s principles manifest.
If one views the diagrams and grasps the meaning, the Golden Elixir’s work is complete.*
Thus, he appended them to the collection to share with fellow cultivators.

*Qing’an Yingchan’s Record, Volume Five concludes*
*Qing’an Yingchanzi’s Record, Volume Six*

The disciple Sun’an Cai Zhi recorded this:

**Yellow Center Resolves Doubts #1**

The Master said: *The ancestral masters, perfected beings, and highest sages of former ages possessed the Supreme Correct and True Dao, which they transmitted to the world to deliver people. Do you truly understand this?*

Ding’an replied: *This disciple has only just entered the Mystery Gate—utterly foolish and dull. Yet by your grace, Master, I have been accepted, a fortune of a thousand lifetimes. The Supreme Correct and True Dao I do not yet know; I humbly beseech your instruction.*

The Master said: *The Supreme Correct and True Dao is that which admits no higher, the most profound of the profound, beyond all form or image, spontaneously so—utterly perfect and wondrous. The sages were compelled to name it the Dao. Since ancient times, all transcendent immortals have attained realization through this, and none have achieved cultivation without it. The oral transmission of the sacred masters, the heart-to-heart transmission of successive generations—the essential teaching of the Golden Elixir—is precisely the wondrous Dao of the Supreme Correct and True.*

Ding’an said: *The Supreme Correct and True’s wondrousness is likened to the Golden Elixir. What is its principle?*

The Master said: *The character "gold" (金) signifies firmness; "elixir" (丹), roundness. The Buddhists compare it to Perfect Enlightenment; the Confucians, to the Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate is no other thing—it is simply the original, singular numen. The original true nature is indestructible through endless kalpas, firm as gold, round as cinnabar, growing ever brighter with refinement. The Buddhists say: "○ This is True Suchness." The Confucians say: "○ This is the Supreme Ultimate." Our Dao says: "○ This is the Golden Elixir." The substance is the same; only the names differ.*

*The Book of Changes states: "In Change there is the Supreme Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes." The Supreme Ultimate is the designation for the spontaneous and formless. The Two Modes are the one yin and one yang—Heaven and Earth. Humanity is born between Heaven and Earth; this is called the Dao of Jiang Cai, and it is fully contained within the single body. The Supreme Ultimate is the primordial spirit; the Two Modes are body and mind. In terms of the Elixir Dao, the Supreme Ultimate is the mother of the Elixir; the Two Modes are true lead and true mercury.*

*What is called lead and mercury is not quicksilver, cinnabar, sulfur, black tin, or herbs and trees; nor is it the essences, fluids, snivel, spittle, heart-kidney qi, or blood. Rather, it is the primordial essence within the body and the primordial spirit within the heart. When body and mind are unmoving, essence and qi congeal and coalesce—this is likened to the Elixir. What is called the Elixir is the Elixir Body. ○ This is the true nature. Extracting ○ from the Elixir is called Elixir Accomplishment. The so-called Elixir is not fabricated from external things; it is the fulfillment of the original source, the attainment of the Correct and True.*

*Few in the world understand this. Today’s cultivators of the Dao mostly lack correct transmission; they all seek outwardly, following the deviant and turning from the correct. Thus, though many study, few succeed. Some refine the five metals and eight stones; some refine the three refuges and five counterfeits; some refine the qi beyond the clouds and mist; some refine the essence and brilliance of the sun and moon; some gather the light of the stars; some imagine pellets forming in empty space to become the Elixir. Some imagine objects in the cinnabar field to be the Elixir; some fly the golden essence from behind the elbow; some visualize between the brows; some return essence to replenish the brain; some circulate qi to return it to the navel. Then there are those who swallow saliva and ingest fluids, inhale the new and exhale the old, practice the Eight Brocades, the Three-Character Method, shake the spine, turn the windlass, close the Tail Gate, guard the navel’s stem, gather heavenly water, calcine autumn stone, bend and stretch in daoyin, massage and regulate, silently pay homage to the Supreme Emperor, press the tongue to the upper palate, return the three fields, close and conduct qi, amass great fire in the bladder, or drill the five phases into the bitter sea. Such minor methods number in the thousands. Even with diligent effort and gathering, they ultimately cannot accomplish the great work.*

*The scriptures say: "The correct Dharma is hard to encounter, and many go astray; the true path often leads into deviant sects." This is what they mean. The essentials of the utmost truth are utterly simple and easy—difficult to encounter, yet easy to accomplish. If one meets a perfected being who points the way, none fail to succeed.*

Ding’an said: *This disciple, by past karmic affinity, has been fortunate to meet you, Master, and receive the Dharma-milk. I humbly beseech your illumination of the essentials of the Golden Elixir.*

The Master said: *Listen carefully now, and I shall expound. The practice of the Elixir lies entirely in seizing the transformations of Heaven and Earth. Take Qian and Kun as the crucible and vessel, the sun and moon as water and fire, yin and yang as the mechanism of transformation, the crow and hare as the medicinal substances. Rely on the celestial pivot’s revolutions, depend on the Dipper’s handle to advance and retreat. Gather qi at the proper time, move the tally according to principle. Advance the fire and retreat the tally, harmonize the Four Images. Pursue the two qi to return them to the Yellow Path, unite the three natures in the Primordial Palace. Return to the root and revert to the origin, restore the mandate. When merit is complete and spirit perfected, the mortal sheds its shell to become an immortal—this is called Elixir Accomplishment.*

Ding’an said: *The transformations of Heaven and Earth seem difficult to seize.*

The Master said: *It is entirely within the single body—what difficulty is there? Heaven and Earth are the physical form; water and fire are essence and qi; yin and yang are body and mind; the crow and hare are nature and emotion. Thus, the physical form serves as the crucible and furnace, essence and qi as water and fire, emotion and nature as the mechanism of transformation, body and mind as the medicinal materials. The sages, fearing that students would have no standard to follow, used Heaven and Earth as metaphors. The human body and the transformations of Heaven and Earth are no different. The two words "body" and "mind" are the medicine, are the fire.*

*Thus, the celestial hun and terrestrial po, the Qian horse and Kun ox, yang lead and yin mercury, Kan man and Li woman, sun crow and moon hare—none lie outside the two words "body" and "mind." The celestial pivot’s revolutions are the celestial mind. The Elixir scriptures say: "If the human mind unites with the celestial mind, the inversion of yin and yang ceases in an instant." They also say: "Observe the Dao through the mind, and the Dao is the mind; observe the mind through the Dao, and the mind is the Dao."*

The Dipper’s handle in its revolutions—this is the Mysterious Pass. The Mysterious Pass is the most profound and wondrous mechanism. Yet many of today’s students cling to physical forms, some claiming it lies between the brows, others at the navel wheel, or between the two kidneys, or behind the navel and before the kidneys, or in the bladder, or in the Cinnabar Field, or in the nine palaces of the head as the Mysterious Pass, or pointing to the birth gate as the place of bodily origin, or to the mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female—all these are mistaken. To fixate on physical form is entirely wrong. Yet one must not seek it outside this body either. The various Elixir scriptures do not specify its location, precisely because it defies description in words or brush. Hence the term "Mysterious Pass." The sages merely inscribed a single character: *zhong* ("center"). Through this *zhong*, the Mysterious Pass becomes clear.

This *zhong* is not the center between inner and outer, nor the center among the four directions or above and below, nor the center within a center. The Buddhists say: "Neither think of good nor think of evil; at just such a moment, what is your original face?" This is the *zhong* of Chan. The Confucians say: "Before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure are aroused—this is called *zhong*." The Daoists say: "Where thoughts do not stir—this is called *zhong*." Thus, the Three Teachings employ but a single *zhong*.

The *Book of Changes* states: "Still and unmoving—this is the essence of *zhong*; responsive and penetrating—this is the function of *zhong*." Laozi says: "Attain utmost emptiness, guard profound stillness; as the myriad things arise together, I observe their return." The *Book of Changes* says: "Return reveals the heart of Heaven and Earth." Now, in the *Fu* hexagram, one yang is born beneath five yin. Yin is stillness; yang is movement. When stillness reaches its extreme, movement is born. At this very point of movement lies the Mysterious Pass. Simply apply effort in the moments of thought and action throughout the twelve double-hours. Over time, the Mysterious Pass will naturally appear. Once seen, the medicinal substances, fire phases, withdrawal and addition, and even the transformation of the embryo and spiritual transcendence—none lie beyond this single aperture.

To "gather the medicine" is to gather the true lead and true mercury within the body. The medicine arises at a specific time. This time is not the winter solstice, nor the waxing moon, nor the midnight hour. The master says: "In refining the Elixir, there is no need to seek the winter solstice; within the body, a yang naturally arises." He also says: "When lead reaches *gui*-birth, swiftly gather it; when gold meets the full moon, it is no longer fit to taste." Thus, seek the moment of *gui*-birth within the body—this is the arising of one yang, the time to begin gathering.

After the union of the two qi, one must recognize how to maintain fullness and avoid excess. "When gold meets the full moon, it is no longer fit to taste." Advancing the fire and withdrawing the tally lack clear standards, so the yearly cycle of seasons—cold and heat coming and going—serves as the model for the fire tally. The waxing and waning of the moon also illustrate the principles of withdrawal and addition. For example: at the winter solstice, yang is born—the *Fu* hexagram, twelfth month; two yangs—the *Lin* hexagram, first month; three yangs—the *Tai* hexagram, second month; four yangs—the *Dazhuang* hexagram, third month; five yangs—the *Guai* hexagram, fourth month; six yangs—the pure yang *Qian* hexagram, where yang reaches its extreme and yin is born, fifth month; one yin—the *Gou* hexagram, sixth month; two yins—the *Dun* hexagram, seventh month; three yins—the *Pi* hexagram, eighth month; four yins—the *Guan* hexagram, ninth month; five yins—the *Bo* hexagram, tenth month; pure yin—the *Kun* hexagram, where yin reaches its extreme and yang is born, returning to the beginning. This is the mechanism of advancing and withdrawing the fire tally.

Alas, students cling to texts and adhere to images, beginning the fire advance at the winter solstice, withdrawing the tally at the summer solstice, and bathing in the second and eighth months, unaware of the essentials. Seeing students misdirect their efforts, the sages compressed the yearly cycle into a single month, using the new and full moons to represent the winter and summer solstices, the two quarters to represent the second and eighth months, two and a half days to represent a month, and thirty days to represent a year. Yet students then fixated on the moon for their practice. The sages further compressed the moon’s waxing and waning into a single day, using midnight and noon to represent the new and full moons, and dawn and dusk to represent the two quarters. Students then fixated on a single day for their practice.

Masters of recent times have said: "Within a single moment of effort lies a year’s cycle of seasons." They also said: "Before father and mother were born, where were the years, months, days, and hours?" This is how the sages guided students to avoid misdirecting their efforts. Alas, those who cling to forms do not fathom the principle, adhering to texts and images, vainly exhausting their minds.

I now directly point this out to you: the moment of *gui*-birth within the body is the arising of one yang. When yang ascends and yin descends, this is three yangs. When yin and yang separate, this is four yangs—corresponding to the second month, like the waxing moon, akin to the *mao* hour, the time for bathing, then advancing the fire. When yin and yang unite and spirit and qi merge, this is six yangs. After yin and yang unite and spirit and qi blend, one must recognize how to maintain fullness. Without knowing when to stop, all previous efforts are wasted. Hence it is said: "When elixir gold meets the full moon, it is no longer fit to taste." Then withdraw the tally, corresponding to one yin, and when yin and yang separate, this is three yins—yin and yang in their hidden positions, the time for bathing, corresponding to the eighth month, like the waning moon, akin to the *you* hour. Then proceed to six yins, where yin reaches its extreme and yang is born—in an instant, a single celestial revolution is complete.

Simply follow this practice. Over time, effort will gradually congeal and solidify, transforming the formless into form, coalescing into the sacred embryo, called the completion of the Elixir.

Ding’an said: "The initial effort and the application of the celestial revolution’s fire phases have been revealed by the master, yet the various alternate names remain unclear. I hope the master will clarify."

The master said: "Alternate names are merely metaphors, all contained within the two words 'body' and 'mind.' At the outset of practice, concentrate the ear’s resonance, contain the eye’s light, seal the tongue’s qi, and regulate the nose’s breath—let the four great elements remain unmoving."

Let the essence, spirit, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, and intent each settle into their proper places—this is called the "Five Qi Assembling at the Origin." Drawing them into the Central Palace is called "Gathering the Five Phases." When the heart remains unmoving, the dragon intones; when the body remains unmoving, the tiger roars. When both body and heart remain unmoving, this is called "Subduing the Dragon and Taming the Tiger." The essence and qi are metaphorically likened to the tortoise and serpent, while the body and heart are likened to the dragon and tiger. When dragon, tiger, tortoise, and serpent merge into one, this is called "Harmonizing the Four Symbols." Using nature to govern emotion is called "Metal and Wood in Union." Using essence to guide qi is called "Water and Fire in Intercourse." Wood and fire share the same source, the two natures forming one family—east’s three and south’s two together make five. Water and metal share the same source—north’s one and west’s four are held in common. Earth resides in the Central Palace, belonging to the self; the five numbers of wu and ji return to their original generative count. When heart, body, and intent merge into one, the three families meet and form the sacred embryo—this is collectively called the "Three and Five in Fusion."

Refining essence into qi, refining qi into spirit, refining spirit to return to emptiness—this is called the "Three Flowers Gathering in the Tripod," also known as the "Three Passes." Today’s scholars often designate the tailbone, spine, and jade pillow as the Three Passes, but these are merely methods of practice, not the essential points. Wherever the heart stirs with thought is the Mysterious Female; those who point to the mouth and nose are mistaken. Body, heart, and intent are the Three Essentials. The nature within the heart is called "mercury within cinnabar," while the qi within the body is called "metal within water." Metal is born of water, the mother of water; when metal returns to dwell within water, it is called "the mother concealed in the child’s womb." Let no external realm enter, nor any internal realm depart—this is called "Sealing and Preserving." Stillness without motion is called "Nurturing the Fire." Emptiness and spontaneity are called "Application." Sincerity and unwavering resolve are called "Guarding the City." Subduing the inner realm is called "Field Warfare." True mercury is called the "Radiant Maiden," true lead is called the "Infant." The embryonic intent is called the "Yellow Dame." Nature and emotion are called husband and wife. Clarifying the heart and stabilizing intent, with nature still and spirit numinous, the two substances coalesce, the three origins converge—this is called "Forming the Embryo." Cherishing the numinous root is called "Warm Nurturing." Warm nurturing is like a dragon tending its pearl, like a hen brooding her eggs—this is called "Protecting and Sustaining." Let no deviation occur, for even a hair’s breadth of error will render all prior effort void.

When the yang spirit manifests, this is called "Shedding the Embryo." Returning to the root and restoring life, reverting to one’s original state—this is called "Transcendence." Shattering emptiness is called "Completion." Ding’an asked: "When the Golden Elixir is complete, can it still be seen?" The master answered: "It can." He asked again: "Does it have form?" The master answered: "It has no form." He asked again: "If it has no form, how can it be seen?" The master answered: "The Golden Elixir is merely a forced name—how could it have form? That it can be seen does not mean it can be seen with the eyes. As the Buddhists say: 'Within non-seeing, one intimately sees; within intimate seeing, one does not see.' The Daoist scriptures say: 'Looked for but not seen, listened for but not heard—this is called the Dao.' Looked for but not seen, yet never not seen. Listened for but not heard, yet never not heard. What is called visible and audible is not within the reach of ears and eyes, but is seen by the heart and heard by intent. It is like a great wind rising: entering the mountains, it shakes the trees; entering the water, it stirs the waves—how can one say it does not exist? Observed, it cannot be seen; grasped, it cannot be held—how can one say it exists? The substance of the Golden Elixir is likewise. Thus, in the beginning of refinement, being and non-being are mutually employed, movement and stillness follow one another, until success is achieved. All conditions suddenly cease, all dharmas are empty; movement and stillness are both forgotten, being and non-being are both relinquished—only then is the Mystic Pearl formed, the Great One returned to truth.

When nature and life are both preserved, form and spirit both wondrous, one emerges from being and enters non-being, roaming freely beyond the clouds—this is the fruition of the Golden Immortal. Thus, the scriptures and alchemical texts employ various alternate names to guide learners, leading them from the coarse to the subtle, gradually entering the sublime, until they perceive nature and awaken to emptiness. Yet the true matter does not lie on paper. It is like a boat for crossing the river, ferrying the people—once the far shore is reached, the boat is no longer needed. As the ancients said: 'Having caught the hare, forget the snare; having caught the fish, forget the trap.' This is what is meant. Moreover, this collection of mine must not be rigidly held to the page. One should only chew it thoroughly, savor its flavor, and delve into its source. Perhaps at a single word, the heart’s ground may open, and one may directly enter the realm of non-action—this is not difficult. There are further subtleties beyond, not easily spoken of lightly. One must seek them beyond the words, depending on how far your practice has progressed. There will be heart-to-heart transmission and oral instruction. For now, devote yourself earnestly to the practice. The profound precepts issue a solemn warning, thus I offer this verse:

*I grant you a scroll of the Golden Elixir—*
*Devote yourself earnestly to seek within.*
*If you can fathom the meaning in these words,*
*The wondrous function will pervade the Great Void."*

**A Guide to Refining Nature**

The study of nature and principle has no fixed sequence. Some say one must exhaust principle, fulfill nature, and arrive at life—this follows an order. Others say the three are accomplished simultaneously. Today’s scholars do not know which is correct. Let me explain clearly. Those of middling and lesser capacity must proceed gradually: first exhaust the principles of things, and only when fully exhausted can nature be fulfilled. If even one thing remains unexhausted, there will be an obstruction. One must first exhaust everything thoroughly to perceive one’s own nature, and only then proceed to life. Those of superior wisdom are not so. By exhausting a single principle, all principles become clear; fulfilling nature and arriving at life are accomplished all at once. It is like the Buddhist precepts, concentration, and wisdom—all are one.

For those of the lowest capacity, forgetting emotion and cutting off thought is called "precepts"; stillness without motion is called "concentration"; silent recognition and subtle penetration are called "wisdom." Those of superior capacity are not so.

The superior adept, in observing precepts, naturally attains concentration; in concentration, wisdom spontaneously flows through—all three matters are accomplished at once.

Those who refine the Golden Elixir begin gradually: first refining essence into qi, then progressively refining qi into spirit, and finally refining spirit to return to emptiness. The sudden teaching is not so. Here, essence, qi, and spirit are called the primordial medicinal substances, and the work is completed all at once.

In seeking thus, what sequence is there in the study of nature and principle? If one is a man of resolve, all three matters are accomplished at once. And what does it mean for all three to be accomplished at once? Hmph—like a tangled skein of silk in a pot, one slash severs it all.

*The Shortcut to Immortality*
Master Yian of Yian Hermitage was a worthy magistrate of Xinghua. His benevolence extended to all things, and though he lived amidst the red dust of the world, his heart dwelled in the mysterious realm—truly a man who dwelt in the world yet transcended it. One day, he visited me in my Toad Hollow and sought instruction. When I briefly outlined the work, his questions and responses were uncommon, leaving me no choice but to speak. Thus, I composed these nine foundational matters and presented them to him, aligning with the principle of the Nine Returns. Within, the transformations of the Golden Elixir are elucidated, with references to the profound tenets of the Chan school. Study this text, savor its meaning, and seek its essence deeply—naturally, the distinction between self and other will vanish, and no view of difference will remain. As for the essentials of ascending to truth and treading the realm of the immortals, nothing surpasses this, hence the title *The Shortcut to Immortality*.

Written by Li Chunsu, the Luminous Toad of Clear Hermitage in Duliang.

1. **Commencing at the Right Time**
To refine the Golden Elixir, one must first understand where to begin. Without knowing the initial work, all manner of contrivances and fabrications are futile. As the Perfected One of Purple Yang said: "Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min, without meeting a true teacher, do not force guesses." One must have a true teacher point out where to place the hands and feet. Even knowing where to begin, one must also know the timing. This "time" refers to the moment of the first yang. Most people mistakenly identify the hour of *zi* as the time of the first yang—this is incorrect. To fixate on the hour is wrong, yet to say there is no time is also wrong. Have you not heard Lü the Perfected say: "Refine the self and await the time"? And have you not heard the Perfected One of Purple Yang say: "When lead sees *gui* arise, swiftly gather it—scripture says the time arrives and the spirit knows"? Pondering this, you will understand: when *gui* arises within the body, that is the time of the first yang. And what is the time when *gui* arises? Hmph—walking to the end of the water, sitting to watch the clouds rise.

2. **True Lead and True Mercury**
Once the timing for commencing is known, one must recognize true lead and true mercury. Lead and mercury are not common lead, black tin, cinnabar, or quicksilver—they are the two original substances within one’s own body. Forcibly named as medicinal substances, their wondrous resonance and union are metaphorically called lead and mercury. Lead’s nature tends to fly, mercury’s to flee. When lead sees mercury, it does not fly; when mercury sees lead, it does not flee. The medicinal substances within the body are likewise. Do you wish to see the medicine? Hmph—clouds rising over the southern and northern mountains.

3. **Gathering the Medicine into the Crucible**
Recognizing it is not remarkable; knowing how to gather it is the marvel. To gather the medicinal substances, one does not depart from movement and stillness. Gathered from within movement and stillness, they are sent into the crucible of effortless transformation, refined with the true fire of samadhi into purple powder, coagulated into the mysterious pearl. Consuming it, one may attain longevity and enduring vision. How to understand the phrase "coagulating the mysterious pearl"? Hmph—grasping ten thousand acres of clouds from the green mountain, scooping the reflection of the moon from the azure pool.

4. **Drawing Lead and Adding Mercury**
Having mastered the refinement of the medicine, one must understand drawing and adding. Drawing and adding mean removing excess to supplement deficiency. All beings in the world—celestial, human, asura, and non-human—have emotions in excess and nature deficient; thoughts in excess and mind deficient; essence in excess and qi deficient. Forgetting essence to nurture nature, gathering thoughts to return to mind, refining essence into qi and beyond—this is called drawing and adding. Yet even if one draws excess and supplements deficiency, it is not extraordinary. There is still a higher matter: one must reach the point of neither drawing nor adding. What is neither drawing nor adding? Hmph—neither surplus nor lack, just right when taken by hand.

5. **The Fire-Timing of the Microcosmic Orbit**
When one reaches the point of neither drawing nor adding, it is precisely the time to apply the fire-timing. It is also said: "True fire has no timing." And: "Do not impose timing upon the fire." Hmph—these two phrases have blinded the eyes of many and opened the eyes of many. I now directly point it out to you. Fire is the heart; timing is thought. Refining thought with the heart is called fire-timing. When the heart is settled and thought ceases, the fire-timing is applied. Though it is said thus, one must not cling to heart and thought, nor depart from them. Departing from heart and thought is delusion; clinging to them is attachment. Neither within nor apart from heart and thought—how then? Hmph—cold comes and heat goes, autumn harvests and winter stores.

6. **Maintaining Fullness and Securing Achievement**
During the practice, one must recognize how to maintain fullness. Without knowing how to maintain fullness, all prior efforts are wasted. The Perfected One of Purple Yang said: "If one’s heart is not yet content with maintaining fullness, one may one day suffer disgrace." The Supreme Lord said: "Those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness." This is the meaning. And what is maintaining fullness? Hmph—full yet not overflowing, thus one long retains abundance.

7. **Securing the Crucible and Furnace**
Having understood maintaining fullness, one must further secure the achievement. Securing means sealing the earthen cauldron tightly.

A hair’s breadth of deviation sets heaven and earth apart. Thus, when the fire-tending is complete and the cycles of the celestial revolution are fulfilled, one abides in silent radiance, the true breath flowing ceaselessly. Throughout the twelve hours, one must vigilantly attend to it, until the elixir ripens and spontaneity is attained. And what are the signs of the elixir’s ripening? Hmph—this night a full measure is poured: where is there no clear light?

8. **Nurturing and Cultivating**
Once the golden elixir takes form, further nurturing and cultivation are required. What is nurturing and cultivating? It is like a woman carrying a child. Throughout the twelve hours, in movement and stillness, sitting and lying down, one must proceed with utmost care—like an ox nurturing its yellow essence, like a dragon guarding its pearl—constantly preserving it within, never allowing interruption, until the moment of parturition, when one’s feet stand firmly upon solid ground. Do you understand parturition? Hmph—when the melon is ripe, the stem falls away.

9. **Regulating the Spirit and Emerging from the Shell**
After parturition, one regulates the spirit in its comings and goings, proceeding with even greater care, like a mother cherishing her infant. In daily life and diet, one must always hold it close; when it begins to move, one must watch over it. If not watched over, it may fall into pits and ravines. Only when the work is established may one depart from the mother. The work of regulating the spirit is just the same. Master Zhongli said:
*"The child is young and not yet grown,
Wholly dependent on the mother’s grace.
After three years and nine cycles, worldly ties are done—
Then roaming heaven and earth, it needs no kin."*
This is the meaning. Though spoken thus, do not take it as a mere state of affairs.

Only by guarding against danger and remaining vigilant at every moment—until the crucible and furnace are entirely overturned—does one attain carefree ease, moving without restraint, roaming beyond the material world, and merging with the Great Void as one body.

How to overturn the crucible and furnace?
With a single phrase—*home shattered, people lost* (☯十力)—the empty sky shatters into fragments, revealing the solitary cinnabar toad.

**Water Tune Prelude: Revealing the Nature’s Principle**
The supreme Dao speaks no words,
Its divine workings beyond all measure.
Originally complete, nothing to add,
Nothing to subtract—no gain, no loss.
Not in wide learning or broad study,
But in silent communion and deep reflection,
Within stillness, ponder carefully.
The true intent within—
Never departs from the Central Yellow.

Round and full,
Radiant and bright,
Manifesting in majesty.
Without excess or lack,
The entire being, formless, aligns with true constancy.
Simply recognize this now in silence—
It is Maitreya of the future,
To be embraced directly.
Opening the eye atop the crown,
Nothing in all realms can conceal it.

**The Secret Essentials of the Golden Elixir**
The Great Dao is wordless,
Yet without words, its Dao cannot be revealed.
The Golden Elixir is formless,
Yet without form, how can its elixir be seen?
Thus, the sages modeled heaven and earth,
Transforming people through the Dao,
Establishing myriad names,
Setting forth countless forms,
Composing scriptures and classics on the elixir,
To guide and enlighten all beings.
Alas, today’s scholars cling to forms and texts,
Generating interpretations,
Spawning heterodoxies,
Splitting the Three Teachings into divergent paths,
Unable to unite as one—
All because they know not the source.
Now, I set forth the secret essentials of the Golden Elixir’s transformations,
Composing thirty-five verses.
Clarifying the supreme principle,
Directly pointing to its various names,
I title this *The Secret Essentials of the Golden Elixir*,
Offering it to the Retired Hermit of the Thatched Hut,
That he may easily comprehend.
If one grasps the meaning through these words,
One naturally embraces the root and returns to emptiness,
Directly entering the wondrous realm of the Inaudible and Invisible.

**Nature and Life**
The primordial true suchness is called *nature*,
The primordial unity of qi is called *life*.
Nature is originally vast in spiritual power,
Yet bound by the body, it loses its efficacy.
Now, if one fully lets go,
It once more radiates luminous clarity.

**Substance and Function**
Modeling heaven and earth is called *substance*,
Embracing yin while holding yang is called *function*.
Heaven and earth establish the foundation,
Yin and yang drive the mechanism of transformation.
These pivotal principles—
Few truly understand.

**Dragon and Tiger**
The primordial qi within the heart is called the *dragon*,
The primordial essence within the body is called the *tiger*.
When nature is settled, the dragon returns to water,
When emotions are forgotten, the tiger withdraws to the mountain.
When nature and emotion harmonize,
One’s name is enrolled among the immortals.

**Lead and Mercury**
The numinous spring of the Great One is called *lead*,
The fiery palace of Vermilion Mound is called *mercury*.
To refine the mercury of Southern Mountain,
First draw forth the lead of Northern Sea.
With body at ease and mind unmoved,
The supreme treasure solidifies.

**Crucible and Furnace**
The true metal of Qian Palace is called the *crucible*,
The true earth of Kun Palace is called the *furnace*.
The crucible is forged of Qian’s metal,
The furnace must be enveloped in Kun’s earth.
Once body and mind are upright,
The crucible and furnace stand firm.

**Elixir Kiln**
The singular true nature is called the *elixir*,
The four great illusory aggregates are called the *kiln*.
The illusory body serves as the elixir kiln,
True suchness is the medicinal material.
With unceasing effort,
The spiritual embryo forms within.

**Being and Nonbeing**
Chasing wind and clutching shadows is called *being*,
Scooping water to toy with the moon is called *nonbeing*.
Only when one grasps the departure from Kan and Li,
Does one know that being is nonbeing.
When being and nonbeing merge as one,
They are refined into a luminous pearl.

**Medicine and Fire**
Drawing in emotions with qi is called *medicine*,
Refining thoughts with the mind is called *fire*.
Gathering the medicine is fundamentally easy,
The firing process is likewise not difficult.
With not a single matter in the heart,
True fire penetrates the Three Passes.

**Mysterious Female**
The valley of emptiness is called the *mysterious*,
The aperture of returning to the root is called the *female*.
When qi returns to the root within the empty valley,
This is the gate of heaven and earth.
Once the opening and closing are mastered,
The golden crucible remains warm as broth.

**Centrality and Uprightness**
Stillness without movement is called *centrality*,
Responsiveness without obstruction is called *uprightness*.
Only when the heart is tranquil is it upright,
Only when the spirit is clear is it central.
Abiding in profound stillness,
Heavenly principle responds and flows.

**Numinous Treasure**
The hundred spirits undispersed are called *numinous*,
The myriad qi perpetually present are called *treasure*.
The treasure within one’s own body,
Manifests efficacy in all actions.
If one can truly contain and nurture it,
It radiates great luminosity.

**Purity and Stillness**
The cessation of waves in the numinous source is called *purity*,
The absence of dust in the field of nature is called *stillness*.
The spirit-water is originally pure,
Yet following the current, it becomes turbid.
Now, if one remains unmoving,
The sun of wisdom naturally rises from east to west.

**Withdrawing and Adding**
Forgetting emotions and severing thoughts is called *withdrawing*,
Refining emotions and nurturing nature is called *adding*.
Nurturing nature is adding mercury,
Forgetting emotions is reducing lead.
Once form and spirit attain perfection,
There is neither gain nor loss.

**Bathing**
Polishing the ground of the heart is called *bathing*,
Washing away toil and dust is called *washing*.
To subdue the wild ape,
First capture the unruly horse.
Not a speck of dust clings—
Spirit and qi unite with the heart.

**Return and Union**
Yin at its extreme gives rise to yang—this is *return*,
Yang at its extreme gives rise to yin—this is *union*.
When yin reaches its limit, yang returns,
When yang arises, union follows.
If the adept understands this principle,
They surely perceive the heart of heaven.

**Intercourse and Union**
The blending of two things is called *intercourse*,
The convergence of the three primals is called *union*.
The maiden resides in the eastern chamber,
The metal lord dwells in the west.
The Yellow Dame brings them together,
Matched as husband and wife.

**Warm Nurturing**
Gentle, ceaseless true breathing is called *warmth*,
Containing light in silent stillness is called *nurturing*.
Once the infant within the womb is formed,
Apply the work of warm nurturing.
Tend to it constantly,
And upon shedding the shell, spiritual powers manifest.

**Return and Restoration**
Qi uniting with spirit is called *return*,
Emotions returning to nature is called *restoration*.
To restore gold to nature,
First teach fire to return to the heart.
When the two become one,
All the earth turns to gold.

**Gathering and Release**
Entering the gate of the Inaudible and Invisible is called *gathering*,
Exiting the paths of delusion is called *release*.
The eternal numinous youth,
Whose spiritual powers are beyond measure.
When released, he pervades the Dharma realm,
When gathered, he conceals himself like a millet pearl.

**Emptiness and Perfection**
The absence of being and nonbeing is called *emptiness*,
The hollowness within and without is called *perfection*.
Clinging to being leads to illusion,
While grasping at nonbeing misses the mark.

**Emptiness and Perfection**
Being and nonbeing both unestablished,
Within and without utterly void.

**Spiritual Penetration**
Awakening to the root and knowing the source is called *spiritual*,
Vast and without attainment is called *penetration*.
Seeing through the face of birth-and-mother,
Neither Buddha nor immortal remains.
Vast and without attainment,
Let the sea become fields as it will.

**Round Illumination**
Returning wholly to the Great Ultimate is called *round*,
Fusing through true emptiness is called *illumination*.
When effort reaches the elixir’s symbolic form,
And merit is complete, the treasure becomes firm.
The moon of nature appears in shape,
Illumining what preceded birth.

**Awakening and Illumination**
Overturning the ten thousand illusions is called *awakening*,
Revealing the true constant alone is called *illumination*.
Qi returns to the primordial beginning,
The original spirit reverts to the Great Origin.
The ten thousand conditions are overturned,
The solitary true suchness revealed.

**Integral Perfection**
Pure and undivided is called *integral*,
One with the Great Void is called *true*.
One principle amid a hundred concerns,
Converging paths though diverse in course.
Grasping the principle of integral perfection,
Body and mind merge with the Great Origin.

**Quatrain Poems**
*For Cheng Jie’an*

In non-doing, best to act within the nothing,
Naturally the jade toad shines on the azure cliff.
Nightlong labor without ceasing,
Qi rounded, spirit complete, the infant is born.

Jie’an sees through the world’s heat and cold,
Hones his brilliance, buries his light, nurturing tranquility.
Yet there is one true joy,
Scooping water from the emerald pool to play with the jade toad.

Brother Jie, pure and without thing,
Only the jade toad nurtured within.
When merit is complete and the three-five elixir formed,
Its radiance shines south and north, east and west.

Confucianism exhausts heavenly principle, Buddhism probes Chan,
Daoism refines the golden elixir by natural law.
Only the jade toad unifies all,
At the crown’s gate, the eye of Dharma-body complete.

The master is originally a learned Confucian,
Yet also received the true lineage of immortals.
Penetrating true emptiness to achieve great awakening,
The jade toad’s sign appears in earth and heaven alone.

**Five Auspicious Quatrains of Seclusion**
*For Cheng Jie’an*

Apart from the mysterious pass,
All else is not true.
Non-doing ends in stumbling,
Action labors in vain.

Nature settled, fire and water part,
Mind clear, wood and metal merge.
The four return to one place,
All rests in Jie’an’s completion.

Liver and lungs are not dragon and tiger,
Heart and kidneys are not fire and water.
Nature and emotion blend,
Sun and moon naturally embrace.

Intention must abide in the center,
Mind must not stray outward.
Jie’an ever steadfast in oneness,
The embryo nurtured, the infant formed.

The Cowherd stands by the river,
The Weaver Girl crosses the bridge.
Once they meet,
Their two intentions harmonize.

From the sea’s depths, red flame arises,
From the mountain’s peak, white waves surge.
Jie’an’s joyous place,
Ever hearing the wooden man’s song.

The crucible stands, the embryo crucible suspended,
The furnace holds the Great One’s furnace.
Knowing only the joy of generation,
Then one may begin the work.

In an instant, emptiness becomes full,
In a moment, being enters nonbeing.
Jie’an’s work complete,
He obtains the night-shining pearl.

Without medicine, do not lightly ascend,
With living lead, hasten the work.
Drive the chariot with the water tiger,
Raise the fire with the mysterious wind.

The two things unite in emotion,
The three passes open their paths.
Where nature’s heaven clouds arise,
Light illumines Jie’an in red.

The subtlety of non-doing revealed,
The mysterious pass profound and obscure.
Seeking heaven’s treasure,
Look for gold within the water.

The numinous ground without the slightest veil,
Jie’an without a speck of dust.
The jade toad round and bright,
Its light piercing the nine heavens.

One, two, three, four, five,
East, west, south, north, center.
The five phases drill into one place,
Only relying on the Metal Lord.

Attaining the One, all things are complete,
Where does the One reside?
If you can further forget the One,
This is the golden elixir.

The formless preceded heaven and earth,
The shapeless preceded the primordial chaos.
Before heaven, chaos intermingled,
Beyond the mysterious, no further mystery.

Abiding in sincerity, one enters sagehood,
Offering reverence, one penetrates the mysterious.
In movement and stillness, nothing attained,
Carefree, delighting in spontaneity.

**On the Three Teachings of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism**
*For Cheng Jie’an*

*Confucian Principle*
Extending knowledge, investigating things...

Every thing contains the subtle Great Ultimate,
Abiding in sincerity and offering reverence, one grasps the mechanism.
Soundless, scentless, traceless,
Yet embodying all things, its principle shines forth—none can defy it.

**Rectifying the Mind, Sincere in Will**
Sincerity and clarity, stillness and stability—these are the roots of the Dao.
In movement and stillness, none differ.
In daily life, maintain the One in rectitude,
And naturally the heavenly principle responds and communicates.

**The Human Mind is Precarious**
Alas, how the world clings in deep delusion,
Chasing sounds and sights, ever teetering on peril.
If one can return to principle and exhaustively examine the self,
Nature settles, the body is at peace, and the spirit rejoices.

**The Dao-Mind is Subtle**
The Dao resides in the daily life of ordinary people,
Manifesting benevolence, concealing its function, and unleashing spiritual power.
Neither excess nor deficiency—ever present,
Yet how the eyes of ordinary people remain blind.

**Only Precision, Only Oneness**
The marvelous mechanism of the heavenly mind lies in its essence and function.
Abandoning the false to follow the true, one enters the subtle.
Refining wisdom to enter the spirit—only through steadfast oneness,
With deep effort and force, one reaches the state of *xi yi*.

**Faithfully Holding the Mean**
Having attained the subtle, one devotes effort to practice,
The great Dao, vast and level.
In its wondrous applications, the center remains steadfast,
The perilous is stabilized, the subtle made clear.

**Exhausting Principle, Fulfilling Nature**
Abiding in sincerity is essential—first exhaust principle,
Exhausting principle lies in the spiritual power of perfect sincerity.
When sincerity is perfected and principle exhausted, the great root of heaven,
The nature of heaven is revealed in supreme radiance.

**To Extend to Destiny**
One who delights in heaven and knows destiny is a true noble person,
One who exhausts principle and probes the subtle is a great sage.
Simply holding the mean as the great root,
Fully illuminating the great root, one communes with the spirit.

**Loyalty and Forbearance Alone**
The heart that reproves others should first reprove the self,
The heart that forgives the self should first forgive others.
Only when loyalty and forbearance are both complete does one attain the Dao,
Persevering to the end, beginning anew—never departing from benevolence.

**Returning to See the Heavenly Mind**
When the host of yin is exhausted, a single yang arises,
Firmly seal the mysterious pass—do not open it recklessly.
In the stillness of utmost quiescence, observe the movement within,
The heavenly mind gleams pure—one awakens to the original.

**Knowing All Things in Their Fullness**
Every thing in the world embodies the heavenly principle,
Yet few among people today truly know this.
Tracing origins, returning to endings, one preserves the Great Ultimate,
Exhausting the spirit, knowing transformation, one enters non-action.

**Retreating to Conceal in the Profound**
The principle of the primordial *Tai Yi* is profound and obscure,
Vast and great, precise and subtle—its wonders beyond assessment.
Savoring and exploring the mysterious, the mystery lies within the self,
Washing the mind, retreating to conceal—utmost in sincerity.

**Constant Vigilance in Solitude**
Seen yet unseen, heard yet soundless,
In concealment and revelation, the subtle and profound—ever perfectly sincere.
Its responsive spiritual mechanism is beyond human fathoming,
Yet the majestic heavenly intent shines forth clearly.

**Unifying with the One**
Each thing inherently contains a Great Ultimate,
Its mechanism and seal govern creation, embodying heaven and earth.
Through adversity and success, the One pervades—fully the heavenly principle,
Embracing the root, returning to the origin, harmonizing with nature.

**Returning to the Ultimate of Non-Ultimate**
Within the ultimate of non-ultimate lies the complete Great Ultimate,
The Great Ultimate takes form, dividing into the Two Modes.
The myriad things, the Three Powers—all are complete within me,
Returning to the non-ultimate is the sage’s foundation.

**Buddhist Teachings**
**Two Bodies, One Essence**
The Dharma-body is pure and formless in its origin,
How can the phenomenal be called the Perfect Body?
Even if a thousand or ten thousand transformation bodies arise,
If they cannot unite as one, they are not wholly true.

**Three Minds as One**
The three minds are fundamentally one—originally without division,
Yet grasping and separating them is merely delusion.
If one can remain unstained by the present,
The past and future all return to emptiness.

**Dissolving to Realize Emptiness**
Boast not of learning or discussing Chan,
Simply settle the mind and sever all entanglements.
Discard all acquired knowledge and understanding,
And the clouds of delusion disperse—the moon’s radiance is full.

**Manifesting the Subtle Without Interval**
Seeing yet as if not seen,
Inability to contain and conceal leads back to delusion.
Hiding the body, veiling brilliance—without trace,
Only then is one the golden-maned lion child.

**Neither Establishing Existence nor Non-Existence**
Clinging to existence or non-existence—both are hard to fathom,
Dualistic grasping leads to loss and emptiness.
Even uniting existence and non-existence remains illusion,
Only by holding the mean can one merge with spiritual power.

**Precepts, Samadhi, Wisdom**
In movement, unmoving—this is true precepts,
True samadhi alone unites with the ancestral lineage.
When wisdom ascends and pervades the Dharma-realm,
All karmic illusions and delusions melt away.

**No Fixed Dharma**
Seeking Dharma through Chan, one’s nature is wholly deluded,
Departing from Dharma to seek the mysterious only deepens deviation.
When one realizes Dharma arises from the mind,
Dharma is empty, the mind is quiescent—one sees the Tathagata.

**Empty and Penetrating, Spiritually Communicating**
An empty mind, still and stable, communicates with the mysterious feminine,
Poverty so pure it penetrates the bones—this is the foundation of the Dao.
The spirit’s realm gleams bright—the moon of the mind appears,
The zenith of Chan alone reveals its great radiance.

**Suchness, Awakened Nature**
The true nature is originally perfect and complete,
Suchness unmoving, illuminating the midst of heaven.
Its light shines pure and unobstructed,
Piercing the primordial chaos before the separation of *Hong Meng*.

**Constant Joy, Self, Stillness**
Nurturing the spirit, cultivating the will—yearning for purity and emptiness,
All day carefree, at ease in expansion and contraction.
Most blissful is the true joy within samadhi,
The zenith of Chan alone shines, luminous and such.

**Mending the Tattered Robe in the Morning Sun**
Mending the tattered robe in the morning sun—mere pretense,
Patching the shoulders, then the waist.
Mended only to tear again,
How can it compare to being utterly bare?

**Finishing the Sutra by Moonlight**
The silver toad in the sky barely half,
Yet the deluded seek to finish the final passage.
Suddenly, a wisp of dark cloud arrives,
And their eyes remain as blind as ever.

**The Diamond Sutra Pagoda**
A seamless pagoda, clear and distinct,
Forcibly pried open by others.
Eight faces, four directions—all are eyes,
Within, the living Tathagata appears.

**Daoist Teachings**
**Purity and Non-Action**

**Purity and Non-Action**
Clear and pure, fundamentally wordless,
Any act of doing disrupts spontaneity.
Silently comprehend, penetrate the mysterious pass,
The numinous spirit transforms, the treasure congeals firm.

**The Supreme and Utmost Real**
Non-action excels as the method for heaven and earth,
Discern the root in above, below, and center.
Only through right concentration can one grasp this essence,
True Suchness emerges, blazing through the Gate of Heaven.

**The Wondrous Function of True Origin**
Neither cling to "no-mind" nor "mind,"
How can "no-mind" fathom the heart of heaven?
Mind inevitably becomes a burden,
Cast off both "being" and "non-being," and awakened nature is pure.

**Diminish and Diminish Again**
Mountain and marsh diminish through the interplay of Gen and Dui,
Admonishing one to curb anger and extinguish wrath and delusion.
Diminish and diminish again, without obstruction,
Abandon learning, embrace non-action, and enter the foundation of sagehood.

**The Three Returns of Day and Night**
The great principle of prior heaven is hard to seek,
Yet all day long, diligently hold fast to the One True.
The work of the three returns is for daily use,
The mysterious pass is penetrated, and the yang spirit emerges.

**Once Attained, Forever Attained**
Scholarly understanding and insight are but dust,
The voices of the Hearers and Perfect Awakening are mere grime.
Purify the mind, refine thoughts in the purity of Chan’s heaven,
Both sage and commoner behold the radiance of the sun of wisdom.

**Withdrawing Lead and Adding Mercury**
Withdrawing lead is merely severing worldly ties,
Adding mercury is the work of one’s original nature.
When emotion and nature merge, the immortal Dao is complete,
Mercury and lead congeal, and the Great Elixir is perfected.

**The Gate of the Mysterious Female**
The mysterious pass and the female portal are the Dao’s gate,
Open, it aligns with Qian; closed, it aligns with Kun.
The deluded busily point to mouth and nose,
How can the original mandate return to its root?

**Departing the Paths of Delusion**
Cast off fame, forsake profit, delight in emptiness,
Sever all illusory conditions.
The waves of the sea of nature settle, the boat reaches the shore,
A wheel of bright moonlight emerges from the clouded thoroughfare.

**Entering the Gate of Profound Silence**
The three passes are penetrated, the true mystery is attained,
The true creation of non-action is fundamentally natural.
With each step, transcend the formless realm,
Lifting the head, the body resides in the Great Heavenly Net.

**Excessive Words Lead to Exhaustion**
A thousand scriptures, ten thousand discourses expound the ancestral teaching,
Yet how lamentable that the deluded see no common path.
Grand debates and lofty speeches boast of sharpness,
In the end, all fall into stubborn emptiness.

**Better to Abide in the Center**
Discoursing on the wondrous and discussing the profound leads nowhere,
Better to silently guard the center.
Neither leaning nor deviating, the mysterious pass is penetrated,
Unchanging, one aligns with the sage’s achievement.

**The Nine-Turned Spirit Elixir**
Erect the crucible, burn dry the four great seas?
Set the furnace, refine to dust the five Mount Sumerus.
The golden elixir takes form, encompassing the three realms,
Only then is it the time for a true man to fulfill his ambition.

**The Dao That Can Be Spoken Is Not the Eternal Dao**
The true and constant Dao is beyond words,
Any speech clearly betrays the宗.
If one grasps the meaning within the unsaid,
No further effort is needed to complete the work.

*End of the Sixth Scroll of the Recorded Sayings of Qing’an Yingchanzi*
*(This piece also appears in the third scroll of the* Zhonghe Collection*, titled "Questions and Answers of Zhao Ding’an." Differences exist. Postscript.)*

I have often heard that the Most High initiated teachings to guide those yet to come, giving rise to the study of divine transcendents. Yet how could the study of divine transcendents be spoken of in ordinary terms? Only when one encounters a perfected being who illuminates the mind and transforms its nature, who comprehends the mechanism of yin-yang’s opening and closing, and who penetrates the principle of the unity of inherent nature and life-destiny—only then, standing transcendent and independent, responding to transformations without end, may one truly discourse upon the study of divine transcendents.

Since the Eastern Florescence transmitted its lineage, and after the radiance of Zhong and Lü spread forth, transcendents emerged in ranks, all of them eminent scholars and towering masters. Some aided rulers in enacting the Dao above, while others bestowed blessings upon the people to relieve their suffering below. The mystic wind flourished ever more, and those who arose to study transcendence have been countless through the ages.

Thereafter, Yingchanzi Li Qing’an emerged, tracing the origins of the Daoist study and receiving esoteric transmission from the divine transcendents. The essence of the Three Teachings was brilliantly clear within his breast. From all directions, seekers flocked to his door, their numbers beyond reckoning, to request his further instruction. His expositions on the wonders of the golden elixir, his exchanges with disciples in answering doubts, and his swift, incisive responses—all these words were recorded and compiled into a book titled *Recorded Sayings of Qing’an*. I have recited its passages again and again: not a single superfluous word in any chapter, not a single extraneous character in any line. All reveal the enduring influence of the Most High and disclose what the earlier perfected ones had left unspoken. Truly, it may be called luminous and wondrous. Its teachings correspond inwardly and outwardly with the *Zhonghe Collection*.

The feathered scholar Deng Tanran of Jingnan had long transcribed this work. Now, he has commissioned artisans to carve and print it, ensuring the transmission of Qing’an’s virtuous voice endures, and thus demonstrating the universality of his intent. Those who study transcendence and peruse these writings will surely find themselves inspired to transcendence—how could this be but a small contribution?
