**Preface to *The Mysterious Pearl’s Esoteric Discourse***

In my youth, I devoted myself to the Dao, resolute in my pursuit of learning, undeterred by winter’s cold at my desk or summer’s scorching heat. Later, when the principles of heaven’s governance were established, I withdrew from scholarly pursuits, passing my days in leisure, my heart dwelling in the supreme Dao. Often, I pondered the great reckoning, fearing the fleeting years left me without refuge; I longed to fathom the true essence, yet dreaded time’s swift passage. Thus, I focused my mind on seeking the Dao, steadfast in my quest for the wise, until I encountered the Mysterious Pearl and became his disciple.

For years, I dared not inquire into the gate of the supreme and wondrous Dao. Gradually, I delved into its depths, and he expounded its profound principles, instructing me: *"In a century, one may transmit this to but a single person. To those without the resolve to seek it, do not recklessly divulge it."* Upon meeting the Master of the Mysterious Pearl, he awakened my understanding, and so I styled myself "Awakener of the Mysterious," for I had sought enlightenment from the Master of the Mysterious Pearl.

Now, I have directly transcribed five copies, each comprising ten volumes. Though the headings and categories share the same meaning, their title is *The Mysterious Pearl’s Esoteric Discourse*—the very words the Master of the Mysterious Pearl secretly imparted by mouth. Over a hundred years, I have not encountered a single seeker of true resolve, yet I dared not conceal the sage’s teachings. Thus, I transcribed five copies and concealed them within the deep caves of the Five Peaks, first offering them to the mountain spirits before sealing them away. I did this so that future seekers might chance upon them. Should one find them, they must treasure and cherish them, transmitting them only to those of extraordinary worth, never lightly bestowing them upon the unworthy. Such was the Master of the Mysterious Pearl’s earnest admonition.

These ten volumes reveal heaven’s decrees, the transformations of the cosmic cycles, the products of the earth, and the calamities yet to come—all of which may be foreseen. The abstruse words of the *Suwen* may be directly elucidated through them. They teach the cultivation of the five viscera, the nourishment of all life, the methods for reinforcing the weak and rectifying imbalance, and the arts of dispelling evil to preserve the upright. Thus, the sage declared: *"Heaven gives life, heaven takes it away—such is the principle of the Dao."* One who fathoms the meaning of the Mysterious Pearl may, upon perceiving heaven’s life-giving forces, prolong life, and upon perceiving heaven’s destructive forces, evade death. As the *Yinfu Jing* states: *"To observe heaven’s Dao and grasp its movements is perfection."* This means that one who aligns with the great cycles of the five phases and six qi may fulfill heaven’s allotted span of one hundred and twenty years. Those who die prematurely do so because the five phases and six qi alternately punish and cut short life. Thus, the ancestral masters taught: *"The Dao of the six qi originates in heaven’s mechanism. Its advent may be discerned, its departure traced."* It should be inscribed on jade tablets, stored in golden caskets, and transmitted only to the worthy—lest misfortune befall nine generations.

**Volume I of *The Mysterious Pearl’s Esoteric Discourse on the Six Qi of the Suwen***
*Recorded by the Awakener of the Mysterious*

**The Record of the Fivefold Movements’ Primordial Penetration**

The movement governs qi, thus occupying the central position—between heaven above and earth below, within the convergence of qi, amid the myriad transformations, where all things and humanity arise. Movement is motion, revolution—cyclical and unceasing. When the Supreme Ultimate first divided, the five movements were arrayed horizontally at the center, revolving to this day, endlessly repeating.

The sages observed and discerned: since the opening of heaven and earth, they saw a green qi spanning *ding* and *ren*—thus *ding* and *ren* govern the Wood movement; a red qi spanning *wu* and *gui*—thus *wu* and *gui* govern the Fire movement; a yellow qi spanning *jia* and *ji*—thus *jia* and *ji* govern the Earth movement; a white qi spanning *yi* and *geng*—thus *yi* and *geng* govern the Metal movement; a black qi spanning *bing* and *xin*—thus *bing* and *xin* govern the Water movement. First, the five movements revolve, then the celestial regulators are recorded.

The celestial regulator serves as the guest, while the movement’s qi is the host. The in-ground regulator also serves as the guest, with the intermediate qi as the secondary guest. Thus, the qi of the five movements ascends to unite with heaven. The qi of the Wood movement ascends to unite with the Azure Heaven; the qi of the Fire movement ascends to unite with the Vermilion Heaven; the qi of the Earth movement ascends to unite with the Yellow Heaven; the qi of the Metal movement ascends to unite with the White Heaven; the qi of the Water movement ascends to unite with the Mysterious Heaven.

The qi of the Azure Heaven courses through *Gui*, *Liu*, *Wei*, and *Shi*—corresponding to the *ding* and *ren* divisions. The qi of the Vermilion Heaven courses through *Jiao*, *Kang*, *Niu*, and *Nü*—corresponding to the *wu* and *gui* divisions. The qi of the Yellow Heaven courses through *Xin*, *Wei*, *Shen*, and *Jing*—corresponding to the *jia* and *ji* divisions. The qi of the White Heaven courses through *Kang*, *Di*, *Bi*, and *Zi*—corresponding to the *yi* and *geng* divisions. The qi of the Mysterious Heaven courses through *Zhang*, *Yi*, *Lou*, and *Wei*—corresponding to the *bing* and *xin* divisions.

Within the Azure Heaven, a green qi courses through four lodges, descending to unite with the Wood movement, aligning with *ding* and *ren*. Within the Vermilion Heaven, a red qi courses through four lodges, descending to unite with the Fire movement, aligning with *wu* and *gui*. Within the Yellow Heaven, a yellow qi courses through four lodges, descending to unite with the Earth movement, aligning with *jia* and *ji*. Within the White Heaven, a white qi courses through four lodges, descending to unite with the Metal movement, aligning with *yi* and *geng*. Within the Mysterious Heaven, a black qi courses through four lodges, descending to unite with the Water movement, aligning with *bing* and *xin*.

Amidst the five movements and five colors, within the flowing qi, the six qi are distinguished. Within the green qi, heaven generates wind, and wind generates Wood upon the earth. Within the red qi, heaven generates warmth and heat—both sovereign and ministerial Fire—thus heat generates Fire upon the earth. Within the yellow qi, heaven generates dampness, and dampness generates Earth upon the earth.

Within the white qi, heaven generates clarity and dryness, and dryness generates Metal upon the earth. Within the black qi, heaven generates cold, and cold generates Water upon the earth.

Thus, the six qi of heaven are wind, warmth, heat, dampness, dryness, and cold. The five movements produced by earth are Water, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Wood. When the six qi and five movements unite above and below, all transformations and creations arise from them, and the flourishing, decline, birth, and dominance of the five creatures all depend on them.

The five creatures are furred creatures, feathered creatures, naked creatures, armored creatures, and scaled creatures. Thus, the *shi* and *zi* (master and disciple) serve as the leaders of furred creatures, corresponding to Wood; the phoenix serves as the leader of feathered creatures, corresponding to Fire; humans serve as the leaders of naked creatures, corresponding to Earth; the tortoise serves as the leader of armored creatures, corresponding to Metal; and the dragon serves as the leader of scaled creatures, corresponding to Water. These five encompass all categories of beings.

Thus, in the movements: *ding* and *ren* govern the Wood movement, with *ren* presiding over hardness and *ding* over softness. Hardness signifies excess, while softness signifies insufficiency. Excess means the Wood qi harms Earth, while insufficiency leads to self-decline, and self-decline results in receiving Metal’s punishment. *wu* and *gui* govern the Fire movement, with *wu* presiding over hardness and *gui* over softness. Hardness signifies excess, while softness signifies insufficiency. Excess means the Fire qi harms Metal, while insufficiency results in receiving Water’s punishment. *jia* and *ji* govern the Earth movement, with *jia* presiding over hardness and *ji* over softness. Hardness signifies excess, while softness signifies insufficiency. Excess means the Earth qi harms Water, while insufficiency results in receiving Wood’s punishment. *yi* and *geng* govern the Metal movement, with *geng* presiding over hardness and *yi* over softness. Hardness signifies excess, while softness signifies insufficiency. Excess means the Metal qi harms Wood, while insufficiency results in receiving Fire’s punishment. *bing* and *xin* govern the Water movement, with *bing* presiding over hardness and *xin* over softness. Hardness signifies excess, while softness signifies insufficiency. Excess means the Water qi harms Fire, while insufficiency results in receiving Earth’s punishment. These describe the hardness and softness of the movements and the meaning of their flourishing and decline.

The movements arise from the heavenly stems. There are ten stems—five yang and five yin—which pair with earth’s six yin and six yang to form the sixty *jiazi* cycles. Thus, *jia*, *wu*, *bing*, *geng*, and *ren* are yang stems, governing yang years. Yang years correspond to *zi*, *yin*, *chen*, *wu*, *shen*, and *xu*, and in these six years, yang stems converge, all signifying excess. *Yi*, *ding*, *ji*, *xin*, and *gui* are yin stems, governing yin years. Yin years correspond to *chou*, *mao*, *si*, *wei*, *you*, and *hai*, and in these six years, yin stems converge, all signifying insufficiency.

Yet insufficiency may include balanced qi. Balanced qi occurs, for example, in a *ding-mao* year of the Wood movement—this is called balanced qi. Why? Though *ding* is the soft aspect of Wood, and *mao* is a yin year, *mao* assists *ding*’s softness, thus achieving balanced qi. Another example: in a *yi-you* year of the Metal movement—this is called balanced qi. Why? Though *yi* is the soft aspect of Metal, and *you* is a yin year, *you* assists *yi*’s softness, thus achieving balanced qi. Another example: in a *xin-hai* year of the Water movement—this is also called balanced qi. Why? Though *xin* is the soft aspect of Water, and *hai* is a yin year, *hai* assists *xin*’s softness, thus achieving balanced qi. Another example: in a *gui-si* year of the Fire movement—this is also called balanced qi. Why? Though *gui* is the soft aspect of Fire, and *si* is a yin year, *si* assists *gui*’s softness, thus achieving balanced qi. Another example: when a *ji* year encounters *chou* or *wei* years—though *ji* is the soft aspect of Earth, and *chou* and *wei* are yin years, *chou* and *wei* assist *ji*’s softness, thus achieving balanced qi. *Chen* and *xu* are also Earth positions, but these two years are yang years, each signifying excess.

Another method: Each year, the transition of qi occurs on the day of Major Cold preceding the new year. For example, in a *ding* year, if the day of transition coincides with the first day of the lunar month and falls on a *ren* day, *ding* meeting *ren* is called the "stem-virtue correspondence." Correspondence means union, thus achieving balanced qi. If this alignment is missed by even a single day, it will not be effective. If, at the time of transition, the hour coincides with the *ren* stem, the same applies; beyond this, it will not be effective. The rest follow this pattern. Thus, *ji* meeting *jia*, *xin* meeting *bing*, *gui* meeting *wu*, and *yi* meeting *geng* are all "stem-virtue correspondences." Outside the day and hour of transition, this alignment does not occur.

Furthermore, in years of insufficiency, if the month’s stem aligns, correspondence is achieved, though it may not be effective. If one encounters a stem alignment before the victorious qi prevails, it results in balanced qi. If, after the victorious qi has acted and the restorative qi has completed its course, the month’s stem aligns, it regains its proper position. Detailed explanations follow in the secret texts.

**Anticipation and Response, Supplementation and Drainage: A Record**

The five movements and six qi each have their victories and restorations. Thus, when Wood is about to prevail, green mists first appear among the forests, and the trees emit sounds—this is the omen of the radiant *Zhen* star. Furthermore, when Wood is about to prevail, the *gong* tone loses its harmony, naked creatures fail to thrive, and the rains and dampness lose their season. In the twelfth month, one first seizes its source of transformation—this is called "anticipation."

Anticipation means seizing in advance what is yet to come. Seizing means draining; one drains its source with needles. Thus, when the Wood qi is about to prevail, one first drains the source of the Liver, located at *Taichong*, in the depression three *cun* behind the base of the big toe—this is where the Liver meridian passes, serving as its source. First, press the source point with the left hand; when the moving qi is felt, insert the needle. The needle enters three *fen*, the position of yang, and upon receiving the heavenly qi, retain the needle for three breaths—this corresponds to Wood’s generative number, three.

Then, tap the area around the point with the hand to guide the qi to the needle’s tip. Push the needle inward to a depth of five *fen* and retain it for eight breaths—this corresponds to Wood’s completion number, eight. Here, one draws the heavenly qi to receive the earthly qi. When the needle’s tip seems to move, the qi has connected. Quickly withdraw the needle and immediately press the point with the hand. This is how one anticipates Wood’s excess by draining the Liver’s source, preventing it from overwhelming Earth.

For medicinal treatment, use acrid and balanced herbs to restrain Wood’s excess, and sweet herbs to support Earth’s deficiency. Avoid sour foods, which would aid Wood’s dominance.

When Fire is about to prevail, the distant horizon glows with a crimson hue, mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees first wither and dry, and creatures of the *jia* category develop widespread dry scabs. The *shang* tone loses its harmony—this occurs in the third month. One anticipates and seizes its source of transformation, draining Fire’s source before Wood’s ascendance. Thus, the Heart’s source emerges at *Tailing*, in the depression between the two bones behind the palm—where the Heart meridian passes, serving as its source. First, press the source point with the left hand; when the moving qi is felt, insert the needle. The needle enters three *fen*, the position of yang, and upon receiving the heavenly qi, retain the needle for two breaths—this corresponds to Fire’s generative number.

Then, tap the area around the point with the hand to guide the qi to the needle’s tip. Push the needle inward to a depth of five *fen* and retain it for seven breaths—this corresponds to Fire’s completion number. Here, one draws the heavenly qi to connect with the earthly qi. When the needle’s tip seems to move, the qi has connected. Quickly withdraw the needle to drain the excess qi. This drains the source of the Pericardium and lesser Heart, addressing the excess of ministerial Fire. The source of sovereign Fire is called the "source of Lesser Yin." The Lesser Yin’s source emerges at *Duigu*, the true source of the Heart, located in the depression at the tip of the *dui* bone behind the palm—also named *Shenmen* or *Zhongdu*. The needling method follows the previous procedure.

For medicinal treatment, use salty and balanced herbs to restrain Fire’s excess, and acrid herbs to supplement Metal’s deficiency. Avoid bitter foods, which would aid Fire’s dominance.

When Earth is about to prevail, mountains and stones first moisten, yellow dust rises on all sides, oppressive heat arises, the *lei* and *mai* qi become agitated, mist and haze spread, and the *yu* tone diminishes—these are its signs. In the fifth month, one anticipates and seizes its source of transformation, first draining the Spleen’s source. Thus, the Spleen’s source emerges at *Taibai*, in the depression at the inner side of the foot’s *jiao* bone—where the Foot Greater Yin meridian passes, serving as its source. First, press the source point with the left hand; when the moving qi is felt, insert the needle. The needle reaches three *fen*, the position of yang, and is retained for five breaths—this corresponds to Earth’s number.

Tap the area around the point with the hand to guide the qi to the needle’s tip. Push the needle inward to a depth of five *fen* and retain it for five breaths—also corresponding to Earth’s number. This is called drawing the heavenly qi to connect with the earthly qi. When the needle’s tip seems to move, quickly withdraw the needle to drain the excess qi, preventing the Spleen’s qi from becoming excessive and harming the Kidneys.

For medicinal treatment, use sour and balanced herbs to restrain Earth’s excess, and salty herbs to supplement the Kidneys’ deficiency. Avoid sweet foods, which would aid Earth’s dominance.

When Metal is about to prevail, western winds arise frequently, pines and bamboos rustle, the earth generates white salt efflorescence, the earthly qi first dries, mountains manifest white vapors, a killing force arises, trees wither and grasses fade, and the *jiao* tone wanes—these are its omens. In the sixth month, one anticipates and seizes its source of transformation, first draining the Lung’s source. Thus, the Lung’s source emerges at *Taiyuan*, in the depression one *cun* and five *fen* behind the large tendon of the palm—where the Hand Greater Yin meridian passes, serving as its source. First, press the source point with the left hand; when the moving qi is felt, insert the needle. The needle reaches three *fen*, the position of yang, and is retained for four breaths—this corresponds to Metal’s generative number.

Tap the area around the point with the hand to guide the qi to the needle’s tip. Push the needle inward to a depth of five *fen* and retain it for nine breaths—this corresponds to Metal’s completion number. This is called drawing the heavenly qi to connect with the earthly qi. When the qi is obtained, quickly withdraw the needle to drain the Lung’s excess qi, preventing it from harming the Liver.

For medicinal treatment, use bitter and balanced herbs to restrain Metal’s excess, and sour herbs to supplement the Liver’s deficiency. Avoid acrid foods, which would aid Metal’s dominance.

When Water is about to prevail, the sky becomes heavily overcast, crows fall silent, the great void darkens, the yang light fails to govern, cold qi arrives first, the *zhi* tone falls short, and Mars disappears—these are its omens. In the ninth month, one anticipates and seizes its source of transformation, first draining the Kidneys’ source. Thus, the Kidneys’ source emerges at *Taixi*, in the depression below the inner ankle at the prominence of the large bone—where the Foot Greater Yin meridian passes, serving as its source. First, press the source point with the left hand; when the moving qi is felt, insert the needle. The needle enters three *fen*, the position of yang, and is retained for one breath—this corresponds to Water’s generative number.

Tap the area around the point with the hand to guide the qi to the needle’s tip. Push the needle inward to a depth of five *fen* and retain it for six breaths—this corresponds to Water’s completion number. This is called drawing the heavenly qi to connect with the earthly qi. When the qi is obtained, quickly withdraw the needle to drain the Kidneys’ excess qi, preventing it from harming the Heart’s qi.

For medicinal treatment, use sweet herbs to balance and restrain the Kidneys’ excess, and bitter herbs to supplement the Heart’s deficiency. Avoid salty foods, which would aid the Kidneys’ dominance.

Why does one regulate these sources of transformation? To regulate means to supplement; to seize means to drain. One drains the excess of the prevailing phase and supplements the deficiency of the weakened phase. For example, when Wood’s qi prevails, Earth becomes deficient. Thus, one drains the Liver’s source and supplements the Spleen’s source.

When Fire’s qi prevails, Metal becomes deficient. Thus, one drains the Heart’s source and supplements the Lungs’ source. When Earth’s qi prevails, Water becomes deficient. Thus, one drains the Spleen’s source and supplements the Kidneys’ source. When Metal’s qi prevails, Wood becomes deficient. Thus, one drains the Lungs’ source and supplements the Liver’s source. When Water’s qi prevails, Fire becomes deficient. Thus, one drains the Kidneys’ source and supplements the Heart’s source.

To regulate and supplement the sources of transformation, first press the source point with the left hand. When the moving qi is obtained, insert the needle to a depth of five fen, reaching the yin division—Earth’s qi. Retain the needle for the duration of one exhalation, corresponding to the generative number of the Five Phases. When the movement of Earth’s qi is felt, withdraw the needle to three fen, reaching the yang division—Heaven’s qi. This is called drawing yin to yang, a method of regulating and supplementing the sources of transformation. Retain the needle for the duration of one exhalation, corresponding to the completion number of the Five Phases.

Thus, when the needle is inserted from the exterior to the interior and then withdrawn, it is called draining. When the needle is inserted from the interior to the exterior and then withdrawn, it is called supplementing. Supplementing is therefore regulating, and seizing is draining. One drains the excess of the prevailing phase and regulates the deficiency of the weakened phase. *Suwen Liuqi Xuanzhu Miyu*, Scroll One, concludes.

"Yunfu Tiandi Ji" Chapter

In the year of *jiazi*, the central phase is Earth, governed by the Grand Palace (*Taigong*). Earth-qi is in excess, and this is called "Abundant Mounds" (*Dunfu*). Earth’s motion brings rain and transformation, resulting in excessive dampness throughout the year. This injures the kidney viscus and, over time, affects the bladder. Scaled creatures (*linchong*) fail to thrive, while shelled creatures (*baochong*) flourish excessively—this is the triumph of spleen-qi. The people suffer from abdominal pain, cold limbs, melancholy, heaviness of body, and vexing oppression. Above, this corresponds to the Star of Saturn (*Zhenxing*). In severe cases, muscles wither, feet become limp and unresponsive, walking induces cramping, pain arises beneath the feet, fluid retention causes central fullness, digestion weakens, and the four limbs fail to rise. When transformation arises from its proper position, the viscus-qi lies concealed in its workings, and qi rules alone. Springs surge, rivers overflow, dried marshes teem with fish, and great winds and rains arrive. Earth collapses, scaled creatures appear on land, and diseases manifest as abdominal fullness, rumbling intestines, and severe diarrhea. The transformation of rain is five—this is the mandate of excessive Earth.

The year of *jiamu* shares the same transformative mandate.

In the year of *yichou*, the central phase is Metal, governed by Lesser Shang (*Shaoshang*). Disaster strikes the seventh palace (*qigong*), which is the West, corresponding to *dui* (Lake) in the directions, the lung in the human body, and autumn in the four seasons. This signifies Metal’s insufficiency, and it is called "Following Transformation" (*Congge*). Fire’s triumphant mandate prevails over Metal, causing all things to flourish, while dryness and desiccation spread. The people suffer from heaviness in the shoulders and back, frequent sneezing, and bloody diarrhea. The qi of contraction (*shouqi*) lags behind its mandate, and the triumph of the conqueror grows extreme. Metal’s child is Water, and Water comes to rescue its mother—this is called "Counter-Triumph" (*Fusheng*). In counter-triumph, cold rains arrive violently, bringing hail, snow, frost, and killing qi. Yin cold ascends to the head and brain, causing pain that extends to the chest and nape, fever, and failure of the cinnabar valley (*dangu*) to form. The people suffer from mouth sores and, in severe cases, heart pain. The transformation of desiccation is four, following the generative number.

The year of *yiwei* shares the same correct transformative mandate.

In the year of *bingyin*, the central phase is Water, governed by Grand Yu (*Taiyu*). Water-qi is in excess, and this is called "Flowing Overflow" (*Liuyan*). It punishes Heaven’s mandate, preventing transformation, and the heart viscus is afflicted. Cold qi spreads, harming the heart’s fire. The people suffer from fever, vexation, palpitations, yin cold in the upper, middle, and lower regions, delirium, forgetfulness, and heart pain. Cold arrives early, and in severe cases, the abdomen swells, channels become distended, wheezing and coughing arise, night sweats occur, and one is struck by *meng* wind. Great rains fall, and dust and mist gather densely. The transformation of cold is six, following the completion number—this is the governance of excess.

The year of *bingshen* follows the same mandate as before. Why does Water’s transformative mandate grow even stronger? Because *shen* (Metal) generates Water, and in a *shen* year, the surplus of Water’s phase becomes even more pronounced.

In the year of *dingmao*, the central phase is Wood, governed by Correct Jue (*Zhengjiao*). The phase attains balanced qi, and this is called "Spreading Harmony" (*Fuhe*). This is what is meant by balanced qi: Metal does not conquer Wood, nor does it bring disaster to Earth. Thus, each transformative mandate aligns with its proper time, and this is called balanced qi, also known as "Yearly Convergence" (*Suihui*). *Ding* governs Wood, and *mao* is Wood—its qi assists it. In the *ding* year, the first month is *renyin*, and *ren* harmonizes with *ding* in stem virtue—this is called "Stem-Virtue Convergence" (*Gande Fu*). Thus, the yearly triumph prevails. The transformation of wind is three, following the generative number. This is the day of correct transformation (*Zhenghua*), meaning the mandate transforms in accord with its time, and no other mandate intrudes—thus, it is the day of correct transformation.

The year of *dingyou* shares the same phase, but it does not receive the year’s power. *You* is Metal, and in the first month, *renyin*, it is also called "Stem-Virtue Convergence." However, the triumph sign does not arrive, so it is not called a Yearly Convergence. The transformation of wind is three, following the generative number. In the year of *dingyou*, the mandate is even more pronounced.

In the year of *wuchen*, the central phase is Fire, governed by Grand Zhi (*Taizhi*). Fire-qi is in excess, and this is called "Blazing Radiance" (*Hexi*). When qi triumphs, the lung viscus is afflicted, and over time, the large intestine is also affected. Armored creatures (*jiachong*) suffer calamity. Autumn and winter are warm, while summer is scorching. However, its transformative governance is only half—why? Because above, it encounters the Water of the Heavenly Controller (*Sitian*), which restrains half of Fire’s power.

In the transformation of heat, seven follows the completion number—this is the standard measure of governance, with no exception. Such is the mandate. The years of *wuxu* all follow this pattern.

In the year of *jisi*, the central phase is Earth, governed by Minor Gong (*Shaogong*). Disaster befalls the five palaces, with the fifth palace being the Central Palace, corresponding to the *Kun* hexagram’s position. In humans, it governs the spleen; in the four seasons, it aligns with summer; among creatures, it rules the protected insects (*baochong*). When Earth is deficient, it is called "Humble Orchid" (*Beilan*). Thus, the transformative mandate of the four seasons’ qi is not upright, and Wood comes to triumph. Great winds arise frequently, and the people suffer from abdominal fullness, jaundice, and edema. The qi of rain and dampness fails to transform, and the protected insects perish prematurely. When the triumph runs deep, Metal comes to counterbalance. At the arrival of this counterbalance, white dust rises on all sides, and the force of stern killing arrives. Leaves wither and fall, and the people suffer afflictions of the liver viscus, while the furred creatures languish in distress. Once the counterbalance subsides, the spleen’s qi remains depleted. Only in the ninth month, *jiaxu*, when *ji* gains the power of *jia* and achieves its stem convergence, does it return to the Central Palace. The transformation of rain follows the number five, and the governance of *sihai* years aligns with this pattern.

In the year of *gengwu*, the central phase is Metal, governed by Grand Shang (*Taishang*). When Metal-qi is in excess, it is called "Firm Completion" (*Jiancheng*). When qi triumphs, the liver is afflicted. White dust rises on all sides, and the killing qi gathers like clouds. The generative qi fails to govern, while the consumptive qi prevails. Furred creatures suffer greatly, and grasses and trees bloom late. The people fall ill with blockages in the flanks and limbs, sinew contractions, blurred vision, and mood swings. Though its transformative governance brings calamity, it does not reach extreme severity—it attains only half its power. Why is this?

The above sees the presence of Lesser Yin Sovereign Fire governing, and the year *wu* is also Fire, thus Metal’s command is half diminished, and Wood’s calamity is likewise minor. The dryness transformation follows the completion number nine, as does the year *gengzi*.

The year *zi* is Water, and Metal-qi accords with it, so its calamity reaches full triumph. The emotional transformation follows the completion number nine. In the year *xinwei*, the central phase is Water, governed by Lesser Yu, with calamity in the first palace. The first palace is the *kan* position, corresponding in humans to the kidneys, and in the four seasons to winter. The creatures are scaled creatures. When Water-qi fails to flow, it is called "dried streams." Then Earth comes to triumph, and dampness prevails greatly. The long-qi is used in reverse, and its transformation is swift. Summer heat and rain arrive frequently, and the people suffer from abdominal fullness, heavy limbs, watery diarrhea, cold sores, flowing water that does not freeze, pain in the waist and thighs, discomfort in the popliteal fossa, thighs, and knees, vexation, foot weakness, reversal cold in the feet, pain in the soles, and in severe cases, swelling of the instep. When the visceral qi is not upright, the resurgence arises. Wood comes to rescue Water, and great winds arrive violently. Grasses are laid flat, and trees shed their leaves. Growth is not fresh, complexions change frequently, sinews and bones contract together, flesh becomes flaccid and paralyzed, vision is dim, objects appear sparkling, muscles twitch, and qi erupts. Pain arises in the diaphragm and heart. The Yellow qi is thus diminished, and the five grains fail to sprout. When the resurgence subsides, Water-qi is pacified. By the seventh month, *bingshen*, Water’s governance is the upright *yu*. The cold transformation follows the generative number one. The perverse transformation is called "when the seasonal command is not upright." The command of *xinchou* is thus.

In the year *renshen*, the central phase is Water, governed by Grand Jue. Wood-qi is in excess, and it is called "Burgeoning Growth." Then great winds uproot and break, and the qi punishes the Spleen viscus, eventually reaching the Stomach. As Wind-qi spreads, the Spleen Earth is afflicted. The people fall ill with diarrhea, reduced appetite, heavy limbs, vexation, rumbling intestines, and fullness in the flanks. The transformative qi governs alone. Insects and birds take flight, and grasses and trees are unsettled. In severe cases, they are shaken and fall. There is pain in the flanks and vomiting. The wind transformation follows the completion number eight. This is the measure of perverse transformation, when the upright command loses its season. In the year *renyin*, the qi is even more severe. It is also called a "yearly convergence," for *yin* Wood and *ren* Wood converge. In the year *guiyou*, the central phase is Fire, governed by Lesser Zhi, with calamity in the ninth palace. The ninth palace is the southern *li* position, corresponding in humans to the Heart, and in the four seasons to summer. Here, Fire-qi is insufficient, and it is called "Hidden Brightness." The Heart viscus is inherently weak, and the summer command is not upright. Feathered creatures perish prematurely. Then Water comes to triumph. When Water arrives, its triumph brings great cold. The long-qi is not upright, and things are scorched and decline. The cold is so severe that Yang-qi fails to transform, and flourishing beauty is broken. The people suffer from pain in the chest, fullness in the flanks and limbs, pain in the flanks, back, shoulders, and between the scapulae, and pain in the inner arms. Depression and darkness cloud the Heart. When the triumph reaches its depth, Fire has a child—Earth—who comes to its rescue. The mother then overcomes the triumph. Dust and gloom gather, and great rains arrive. Black qi is thus subdued. The people suffer from sudden blindness, abdominal fullness, inability to eat or drink, internal cold, rumbling intestines, diarrhea, cramping pain, atrophy, and numbness. Their feet cannot support their bodies. When the resurgence subsides, Fire-qi begins to balance. In the fifth month after, *wuwu*, *gui* meets its stem-branch Fire counterpart and returns to the upright *zhi*. The heat transformation follows the generative number two. The perverse transformation is called "losing the upright command." The year *guimao* is likewise.

In the year *jiaxu*, the central phase is Earth, governed by Grand Gong. Earth-qi is in excess, and it is called "Abundant Mound." Earth enacts the rain command. Then dust, summer heat, and dampness gather. The Great Void is filled with dust, darkness, clouds, and rain. When the seasonal qi is excessive, it harms the Kidneys, eventually reaching the Bladder. The transformative qi is in excess, while the visceral qi does not govern. The people fall ill with qi reversal, impotence, cold in the foot meridians, lack of strength, loss of essence, and scaled creatures suffer. When qi is abundant, Wind arises to triumph and shift. The people suffer from eye diseases, blockages, and jaundice. When the above triumphs, Heaven’s command is not followed. The rain transformation follows the number five. It is also called perverse transformation, when governance loses its season. The year *jiachen* is the opposite transformation of this command.

In the year *yihai*, the central phase is Metal, governed by Upright Shang. It is a balanced qi, and it is called "Judicious Balance." The so-called balanced qi refers to the third month, when *gengchen* arrives early, meeting the stem’s virtue. *Yi*, the yielding, meets *geng*, the firm, and the qi returns to its upright position. Fire has not yet attained its kingly phase, so it does not triumph but is first balanced. When Fire does not triumph, Water does not resurge. Moreover, *hai* is Water, and it also gains the year’s power, so Fire does not triumph. The emotional transformation follows the generative number four. The upright transformation is called "no other command," for it follows its own transformation in due time. In the year *yisi*, Fire comes to slightly triumph, for *si* is Fire and can assist the triumph. Then, during the mid-season qi of the second month, Sovereign Fire’s seasonal transformation is called "Fire comes to triumph." Metal-qi triumphs, and Lesser Shang follows Greater Zhi. The triumph does not last long and does not await Water’s resurgence. Instead, in the third month, *gengchen*, *yi* meets *geng*, and the qi is complete. Metal returns to Upright Shang, and the qi is balanced.

In the year *bingzi*, the central phase is Water, governed by Grand Yu. Water-qi is in excess, and it is called "Flowing Overflow." When Water is abundant, it overcomes the Controller of Heaven, and the transformative command is not followed. *Bing* is the Water phase, the stem’s firmness, and it is also Water. Greater Yang governs Heaven. When it is excessive, Water-qi confronts Fire, and the long command is not followed. This is the triumph of the visceral qi. The Heart viscus is afflicted, eventually reaching the Small Intestine. Feathered creatures suffer calamity, while scaled creatures thrive. The cold transformation follows the completion number six. It is also called perverse transformation, when summer loses its seasonal uprightness. The year *bingwu* differs only slightly. *Wu* is Fire, and Fire gains the year’s power. Though *bing* is the phase’s firmness, Water triumphs. It is said that Fire resides in the southern *wu* position, gaining the upright *li* qi’s assistance. Thus, the summer command is transformed, the Heart viscus is not afflicted, feathered creatures do not suffer calamity, and the heat transformation attains its upright transformation. There is no other perverse qi that arrives.

In the year *dingchou*, the central Wood phase governs with the upright *jiao* tone, for Wood’s virtue attains balanced qi—its name is "Spreading Harmony." What does this mean? It does not await Metal’s triumph but first achieves alignment with the celestial tally. At the onset of the initial qi, it encounters the first month *renyin*; though *ding* is Wood’s yielding phase and *chou* a yin year, *ren* is Wood’s firm phase, and its virtue aligns with *ding*. When *ding* meets *ren*, its qi is restored in full, so Metal does not triumph, Fire does not counter, and Wood’s virtue assumes the upright *jiao* tone, its generative qi prevailing. The seasonal command of Wood does not harm Earth, and the people enjoy well-being. Shelled creatures, furred creatures, and armored creatures each flourish in their season. The wind transformation follows the generative number three—this is the day of upright transformation. In accordance with the seasons, the governance does not lose its timely order.

In the year *dingwei*, the qi transformations and phase movements align with Heaven, following the governance of *dingchou*.

In the year *wuyin*, the central Fire phase governs with the excessive *zhi* tone, for Fire’s qi is in excess—its name is "Blazing Radiance." The phase movement precedes Heaven, arriving prematurely, hence it is called "preceding Heaven." Moreover, the phase aligns in virtue with Heaven, termed a "celestial tally." Above, Lesser Yang’s ministerial Fire presides over Heaven, so the phase and Heaven share Fire’s nature, and its qi is intensely abundant. Scorching heat spreads, the Metal viscus Lung is afflicted, and the people suffer from malaria, shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, blood overflow, diarrhea, constipation, dryness, deafness, internal heat, shoulder and back heat, and in severe cases, chest pain, rib and limb fullness, pain in the chest, back, shoulders, and scapulae, pain in the inner arms, bodily heat, bone pain, and spreading damp-heat. The gathering qi does not prevail, while the growing qi alone flourishes, manifesting Fire’s triumph. The heat transformation follows the completion number seven—this is the day of perverse transformation, when governance loses its timely order.

In the year *wushen*, there is a slight difference: *shen* is Metal, which assists the Lung. Though the Lung suffers Fire’s punishment, its qi is somewhat steadfast, and the people’s illnesses are halved—hence the slight difference. The remaining commands follow this pattern.

In the year *jimao*, the central Earth phase governs with the diminished *gong* tone, for Earth’s qi is insufficient, bringing calamity to the fifth palace—the fifth palace is the Center. In humans, it corresponds to the Spleen. Its qi divides into the four qi, and its creatures are shelled—its name is "Humble Orchid." Wood then comes to punish: the Wood phase’s wind triumphs over Earth, and wind prevails greatly. The transformative qi loses its command, grasses and trees flourish luxuriantly, swaying violently, flowering but bearing no fruit. The people suffer from undigested diarrhea, cholera, heaviness, abdominal pain, strained sinews and bones, and aching muscles. The triumph is extreme. Metal’s child comes to counter, and when the counter arrives, the gathering governance is severe: grasses and trees wither and fade, sudden pain strikes the chest and abdomen, pulling downward to the lower abdomen, with frequent sighing. Insects consume sweet and yellow things. Qi invades the Spleen, grains rot, and people eat little and lose their meals. When the counter subsides, Earth’s qi is not yet upright. Later, in the ninth month *jiaxu*, Earth returns to the upright *gong* palace. The rain transformation follows the number five—this is the day of perverse transformation, when the command loses its upright order.

In the year *jiyou*, it differs from this year: *you* is Metal, which fears triumph, so Wood’s triumph is slight.

In the year *gengchen*, the central Metal phase governs with the excessive *shang* tone, for Metal’s qi is in surplus—its name is "Firm Completion." With Metal’s qi in surplus, the generative qi withers, and the gathering qi brings destruction: white dust rises on all sides, grasses and trees wither and fall, forests become desolate, and dryness parches the fields white. The people suffer in the Liver, furred creatures are distressed, and there is rib-side qi block, difficult urination, dribbling urine, blurred vision, and muscle spasms. The dryness transformation follows the completion number nine—this is the day of perverse transformation, when the spring command loses its governance.

The phase movement in *gengxu* follows this pattern.

In the year *xinsi*, the central Water phase governs with the diminished *yu* tone, for Water’s qi is insufficient, bringing calamity to the first palace—the first palace is the northern *kan* position. In humans, it corresponds to the Kidneys, and its creatures are scaled. Water’s decline is called "Dried Flow," meaning desiccation and exhaustion, for Earth’s phase triumphs over Water. Earth’s phase brings rain, hence it is called the "rain transformation’s triumph." When the triumph arrives, by the fourth qi, great rains pour ceaselessly, the Kidney viscus is endangered, and eventually the Bladder is afflicted. Scaled creatures are distressed, and Water’s peril is dire. Wood then comes to counter the triumph: great winds arise repeatedly, stirring dust high, breaking and toppling forests, and hurling sand and stones. Thus, Earth’s qi is depleted, the Spleen viscus is afflicted, and shelled creatures suffer calamity. When Wood’s counter subsides, Earth is not yet fully restored. In the seventh month *bingshen*, *xin* meets *bing* in alignment, and Water returns to the upright *yu* tone. Water’s blackness is complete, and the cold transformation follows the number one—this is the day of perverse transformation, when governance loses its timely order.

In the year *xinhai*, there is a slight difference. Why? *Hai* is Water, and though *hai* is a yin year, *hai* Water aligns with *xin* Water’s phase movement in a "yearly convergence," so Water attains balanced qi. Thus, Earth does not triumph, and Wood does not counter—hence it attains the upright *yu* tone. This is the day of upright transformation, when the cold transformation follows the generative number one.

In the year *renwu*, the central Wood phase governs with the excessive *jiao* tone, for Wood’s qi is in surplus—its name is "Arising Life." *Ren* is Wood’s phase movement, the firm phase of the movement. *Wu* is a yang year, and in yang years, excess prevails—hence the qi’s abundance is great. The generative qi’s command is excessive, the movement precedes Heaven, and the wind transformation flourishes. The transformative qi loses its command, and rain and dampness are deficient. The Spleen viscus is afflicted, eventually reaching the Stomach, and shelled creatures do not flourish. The wind transformation follows the completion number eight—this is the perverse qi losing its timely order.

The year *renzi* is likewise.

In the year *guiwei*, the central Fire phase governs with the upright *zhi* tone, for Fire attains balanced qi—its name is "Ascending Clarity." Why? The two Fires on the left and right serve as intervening qi to assist it. Moreover, in the fifth month *wuwu*, it first achieves alignment with the celestial tally. When *gui* meets *wu*, its qi is complete. Having first attained the tally’s power, Water does not triumph—hence it is called balanced qi, for Water does not triumph and Earth does not counter. Fire also does not bring calamity to the ninth palace—hence it is called the upright *zhi* tone.

The heat transformation follows its timely order, and the upright transformation is called "without other influences"—the heat transformation being two, following the generative number. The year *guichou* follows the same pattern as before.

In the year *jiashen*, the central Earth phase governs with the grand *gong* tone, for Earth’s qi is in excess—its name is "Abundant Mound." Earth enacts the rain mandate, and thus the transformative qi flourishes. When the visceral qi is untimely, perverse qi invades the Kidney viscus, eventually reaching the Bladder. Scaled creatures then languish; cold and chill reverse to warmth, while rain and dampness prevail. The people suffer from abdominal pain, reversal counterflow, dispiritedness, heaviness of body, vexation and oppression, and in severe cases, muscle atrophy, inability to lift the feet, frequent cramps, pain beneath the soles, fluid retention causing central fullness, poor digestion, and inability to raise the four limbs. The rain transformation being five marks the day of perverse transformation, for the visceral qi is not upright. The year *jiayin* differs from this. Why? *Yin* belongs to Wood, and Wood can restrain Earth—this is the balanced qi. Thus, the visceral qi is balanced, scaled creatures naturally flourish, and the Kidney qi is harmonized. This is called the day of upright transformation, hence it is free from other perverse influences.

In the year *yiyou*, the central Metal phase governs with the upright *shang* tone, for Metal attains balanced qi—its name is "Prudent Equilibrium." The seventh palace suffers no calamity; Fire’s triumph does not arrive, and Water’s retaliation does not come. Furred creatures flourish, and the Lung viscus’s qi is at peace. Why? Though *yi* is the yielding phase of Metal’s qi, and *you* is a yin year, *you* is the Metal position of the western direction, and Metal’s qi assists it—hence it attains balanced qi. The long qi also does not restrain the generative qi, and the killing qi is naturally upright. The cool transformation being four follows the generative number—this is called the day of upright transformation without other perverse influences. The year *yimao* differs from this. In that year, the Metal phase is in minor *shang*, for Metal’s qi is insufficient—its name is "Following Transformation." Fire then gains the second qi, and the sovereign Fire’s phase comes to prevail in its division, bringing sweltering heat. Furred creatures perish, and the Lung falls ill. Since Fire’s triumph is insufficient, Water has not yet acted in retaliation to balance its qi. Why? In the third month *gengchen*, *yi* meets *geng* and harmonizes with its celestial virtue. The Metal phase attains the upright *shang* tone, and its qi is thus balanced, ensuring the killing qi does not lose its mandate. The clear transformation being four follows the generative number—this is called the day of perverse transformation with other influences.

In the year *bingxu*, the central Water phase governs with the grand *yu* tone, for Water’s qi is in excess—its name is "Flowing Overflow." Water, strengthened by the firmness of *bingxu*, with *xu* bearing the Greater Yang above, aligns with cold. Its qi confronts Fire, and the long qi loses governance; scorching heat thus wanes. Sudden chills arise intermittently, and the visceral qi flourishes. Frost and hail appear, its mandate is cold clouds and biting chill, and feathered creatures forget their nature. The visceral illness becomes perilous, eventually reaching the Small Intestine. The people suffer from heart heat and vexation, heart dryness and palpitations, yin counterflow, cold in the upper, lower, and middle, delirium and forgetfulness, and heart pain. Cold qi arrives early. The cold transformation being one, six in the generative and completion numbers, and two transformations merging with the celestial mandate—this is called the day of perverse transformation losing its governance. The year *bingchen* follows the same pattern.

In the year *dinghai*, the central Wood phase governs with the upright *jiao* tone, for Wood attains balanced qi—its name is "Spreading Harmony." Wood’s qi does not harm the third palace. Why? Though *ding* is the yielding phase of Wood’s qi, and *hai* is a yin year, in the first month *renyin*, *ding* meets *ren* and harmonizes with its celestial virtue—hence it attains balanced qi. Thus, the phase achieves celestial harmony, and Wood’s qi is complete. Metal does not triumph, and Fire does not retaliate. Wood also does not harm Earth’s mandate, allowing each seasonal mandate to attain its proper transformation—hence it is called the day of upright transformation. The wind transformation being three follows the generative number. The upright *dingsi* year follows this same mandate.

In the year *wuzi*, the central Fire phase governs with the grand *zhi* tone, for Fire’s qi is in excess—its name is "Brilliant Scorch." Above, it joins virtue with the Lesser Yin sovereign Fire—this is called a "Celestial Tally." Fire enacts the summer heat mandate, and thus scorching heat prevails greatly. The summer mandate is excessive, its mutation is oppressive steam, and its manifestation is blazing brilliance. As such, the Heart’s qi is in excess, and perverse heat scorches the Lung viscus, eventually reaching the Large Intestine. Furred creatures do not thrive, the killing qi loses governance, and the stern killing lacks authority. The summer heat transformation follows the completion number. The year *wuwu* is called the "Grand Son’s Celestial Tally," a triple convergence. That is, *wu* Fire phase above joins the Lesser Yin sovereign Fire, and *wu* is the southern direction’s position—thus, the three Fire positions join virtue. Its transformation becomes even more severe, and this is called the day of perverse transformation where autumn loses its uprightness.

In the year *jichou*, the central Earth phase governs with the minor *gong* tone, for Earth’s qi is insufficient—it brings calamity to the fifth palace. The fifth palace is the central palace, corresponding in humans to the Spleen, in the hexagrams to *Kun*, in the governing qi to the fourth qi, and in creatures to shelled creatures. Earth being insufficient, its name is "Humble Supervision." Earth enacts the rain mandate, and the damp transformation is thus deficient. Wood then comes to restrain it, and Wood enacts the wind mandate—thus, the wind transformation prevails in triumph. When this triumph arrives, it comes early with the first qi. During the time of wind and Wood, transformation is upright, and the Spleen falls ill, eventually reaching the Stomach. Shelled creatures are severely afflicted, the fourth qi is again deficient, and Earth is in peril. Metal then arrives, bringing dryness in retaliation to triumph over Wood. Wood in turn declines, and the Liver falls ill, eventually reaching the Gallbladder. Earth then becomes tranquil, the Spleen’s illness is cured, shelled creatures are relieved, and by the ninth month *jiaxu*, *ji* meets *jia* to harmonize its celestial virtue. Earth returns to the upright *gong* tone’s position, called "Rain and Wind," where triumph and retaliation coincide. The measure of perverse transformation—perverse transformation is the name for mutual restraint and triumph. The rain transformation being five, the year *jiwei* follows this same upright pattern.

In the year *gengyin*, the central Metal phase governs with the upright *shang* tone, for Metal attains balanced qi—its name is "Prudent Equilibrium." *Yin* is yang, and *geng* governs excess, so why is it called balanced qi? Because above, it meets the Lesser Yang ministerial Fire as the Celestial Controller, and below, it is restrained by what it encounters—thus, the Celestial Controller punishes the phase, and the phase cannot be excessive. Hence, its excess is tempered to appear balanced. Its qi also harms the Liver, though this is but a minor calamity. Furred creatures are slightly afflicted, and the spring mandate is clear and dry.

The Dryness transformation being nine follows the completion number, and the perverse transformation is not severe.

In the year *gengshen*, Metal attains excess, following the Greater *shang* tone of Metal—its name is "Firm Completion," for *shen* Metal serves as its assistant. The Metal qi harms the Liver and, over time, affects the Gallbladder. The mandate of generative qi does not kill, yet Metal qi being excessive, the Dryness transformation follows its decree.

In the year *xinmao*, the central Water phase governs with the Lesser *yu* tone, and the Water qi is insufficient, bringing calamity to the first palace—the first palace being the *kan* position of the north. In humans, Water corresponds to the Kidneys. Water being insufficient, its name is "Dried Flow," meaning desiccation and exhaustion. Thus, the Earth qi arrives to triumph, punishing the Water, and above, the rain mandate is enacted—its name is the "Rain Transformation Triumph." The triumph reaches its peak in the fourth qi, for Earth attains its timely transformation and thus prevails. The Great Void is veiled in dust and haze, clouds churn in turmoil, and the rain mandate transforms repeatedly. The Kidney viscus falls ill, and over time, the Bladder is affected. Scaled creatures suffer grievously, the winter mandate turns warm, flowing waters do not freeze, and the peril of Water’s distress invites Wood’s restorative punishment. Wood, being Water’s child, enacts the Wind mandate—its name is the "Wind Transformation," where triumph and restoration coincide. Thus, the great wind restores its triumph over rain. Earth, corresponding to the Spleen, falls ill in turn, and shelled creatures suffer misfortune—the Earth qi is endangered. As such, the Earth qi begins to wane, and by the seventh month *bingshen*, Water regains its upright *yu* tone. The Cold transformation being one follows the generative number, and the perverse transformation is called "Loss of Upright Mandate." The year *xinyou* is likewise.

In the year *renchen*, the central Wood phase governs with the Greater *jue* tone, and the Wood qi is in surplus—its name is "Burgeoning Growth." Its qi is abundant, and Wood being excessive, the Wind mandate prevails. Winds arise in great force, stirring and snapping, howling and tearing, their power wreaking havoc. When the qi overreaches, it harms the Spleen and, over time, affects the Stomach. Shelled creatures fail to thrive, and the transformative qi does not fulfill its mandate. The Wind transformation being eight follows the completion number, and the perverse transformation is called "Loss of Upright Mandate." The mandate of *renxu* likewise follows this year’s decree.

In the year *guisi*, the central Fire phase governs with the upright *zhi* tone, and Fire attains balanced qi—its name is "Ascendant Peace." Though *si* is a yin year and *gui* is yielding, first, *si* is Fire and is also called a "Yearly Convergence"; second, Water has not attained its timely transformation; third, in the fifth month *wuwu*, *gui* meets *wu* in union, their stems harmonizing—thus, it attains balanced qi. Since Water does not arrive to triumph nor Fire to restore, the Fire mandate follows its season. The Heat transformation being two follows the generative number, and the upright transformation is called "Following the Season’s Upright Mandate."

In the year *guihai*, the central Fire phase governs with the Lesser *zhi* tone, and Fire is insufficient, bringing calamity to the ninth palace—the ninth palace being the *li* position of the south. In humans, it corresponds to the Heart, and creatures are feathered. Fire being insufficient, its name is "Concealed Brightness," for *hai* is Water, differing from *si*. Thus, Water gains the year’s power and arrives to enact triumph—sudden cold ensues. When triumph is questioned, the people suffer in the Heart and, over time, in the Small Intestine, while feathered creatures fall ill. When the triumph is extreme, Earth arrives to restore its triumph. Water, distressed by the triumph, causes the Kidneys to fall ill in turn, affecting scaled creatures. By the fifth month *wuwu*, Fire regains its upright *zhi* tone, its qi now balanced, and the perverse transformation is called "Loss of Governance Mandate."

[Textual variants noted in collation are incorporated into the translation below.]

When Wood is insufficient, its name is "Veiled Brilliance." In humans, it corresponds to the Liver, and creatures are hairy. Metal, gaining the year’s power, arrives to enact triumph—sudden winds arise. When triumph is questioned, the people suffer in the Liver and, over time, in the Gallbladder, while hairy creatures fall ill. When the triumph is extreme, Fire arrives to restore its triumph. Metal, distressed by the triumph, causes the Lungs to fall ill in turn, affecting feathered creatures. By the third month *bingchen*, Wood regains its upright *zhi* tone, its qi now balanced, and the perverse transformation is called "Loss of Governance Mandate."

When Earth is insufficient, its name is "Lowly Oversight." In humans, it corresponds to the Spleen, and creatures are naked. Wood, gaining the year’s power, arrives to enact triumph—sudden dampness ensues. When triumph is questioned, the people suffer in the Spleen and, over time, in the Stomach, while naked creatures fall ill. When the triumph is extreme, Metal arrives to restore its triumph. Wood, distressed by the triumph, causes the Liver to fall ill in turn, affecting hairy creatures. By the ninth month *renxu*, Earth regains its upright *gong* tone, its qi now balanced, and the perverse transformation is called "Forgetting the Mandate."

When Metal is insufficient, its name is "Hidden Clarity." In humans, it corresponds to the Lungs, and creatures are feathered. Fire, gaining the year’s power, arrives to enact triumph—sudden heat arises. When triumph is questioned, the people suffer in the Lungs and, over time, in the Large Intestine, while feathered creatures fall ill. When the triumph is extreme, Water arrives to restore its triumph. Fire, distressed by the triumph, causes the Heart to fall ill in turn, affecting winged creatures. By the ninth month *yihai*, Metal regains its upright *shang* tone, its qi now balanced, and the perverse transformation is called "Forgetting the Mandate."

When Water is insufficient, its name is "Concealed Brightness." In humans, it corresponds to the Kidneys, and creatures are scaled. Earth, gaining the year’s power, arrives to enact triumph—sudden cold ensues. When triumph is questioned, the people suffer in the Kidneys and, over time, in the Bladder, while scaled creatures fall ill. When the triumph is extreme, Wood arrives to restore its triumph. Earth, distressed by the triumph, causes the Spleen to fall ill in turn, affecting naked creatures. By the fifth month *wuwu*, Water regains its upright *yu* tone, its qi now balanced, and the perverse transformation is called "Loss of Governance Mandate."

**Heavenly Origin’s Fixed Transformations Record**

The term *sitian* (Controller of Heaven) means "upright"; it denotes serving the uprightness of Heaven. The *zuoyou* (Left and Right) follow the upright, subordinate to the Controller of Heaven, thus accompanying the Controller to serve Heaven’s uprightness. Their names are the *wenqi* (Interrogating Qi), for the root qi follows Heaven’s emptiness and periodically interrogates the transformations of its mandate. This is the interrogating transformation of the Controller of Heaven’s mandate, hence the name *wenqi*.

Thus, some harmonize with Heaven, while others do not; some transform in parallel with Heaven’s mandate, while others overpower it and refuse transformation. Some precede Heaven’s mandate, others follow it; some arrive early in interrogation, others late; some come early and depart early, others come late and depart late; some come early but depart late, others come late but depart early. Some fear Heaven’s mandate and do not arrive; some respond on the left but not the right, or on the right but not the left; some respond on both sides, others on neither. Some follow the Southern Regulator, others the Northern Regulator. Such is the non-uniformity of Heaven’s mandate. Though predetermined, it is also governed by the minutely detailed fixed records, for Heaven’s mandate must transform—if it does not, the reasons are expounded below.

The *tianyuan* (Heavenly Origin’s Six Qi) are *jueyin*, *shaoyin*, *taiyin*, *shaoyang*, *yangming*, and *taiyang*. *Jueyin* governs the *sihai* (巳亥) cycle; *shaoyin* the *ziwu* (子午) cycle; *taiyin* the *chouwei* (丑未) cycle; *shaoyang* the *yinshen* (寅申) cycle; *yangming* the *maoyou* (卯酉) cycle; and *taiyang* the *chenxu* (辰戌) cycle. These are the numerical cycles of yin and yang’s alternating fixed records, thus they end and begin anew.

*Jueyin* is Wood. Its mandate is wind; its nature, warmth; its virtue, harmony; its distress, uprooting and tearing; its triumph, breaking and falling; its retaliation, furious gales. Its transformation is three eights; its creatures, furred; its organ, the Liver. Its diseases are tremors, dizziness, and tendon spasms. Its color is green; its flavor, sour; its odor, rancid. It nourishes the sinews; its indicator, the eyes; its season, spring. Its star is Jupiter; its movement, the left flank. Its symbol is the Azure Dragon; its pulse, string-like and long. Its trigram is *Zhen* (震); its positions, *yin* (寅) and *mao* (卯). Its grain is green; its fruit, the plum; its livestock, the parrot. Its warnings are falling and ruin; its disasters strike the Third Palace. Its spirit is the *hun*; its fluid, tears. It governs *si* (巳) and *hai* (亥); its phase aligns with *ding* and *ren*.

*Shaoyin* is Sovereign Fire. Its mandate is heat; its nature, warmth; its virtue, benevolence; its distress, oppressive steam; its triumph, extreme heat; its retaliation, stifling sultriness. Its transformation is two sevens; its creatures, feathered; its organ, the Heart. Its diseases are fright and palpitations. Its color is red; its flavor, bitter; its odor, scorched. It nourishes the vessels; its indicator, the tongue; its season, summer. Its star is the Lesser Blaze, resembling Mars—red and small. Its movement is at the heart; its symbol, the Vermilion Bird; its pulse, surging and vast. Its trigram is *Li* (離); its positions, *si* (巳) and *wu* (午). Its grain is cinnabar; its fruit, the apricot; its livestock, the sheep. Its warnings are vexing heat; its disasters strike the Ninth Palace. Its spirit is the *shen*; its fluid, sweat. It governs *zi* (子) and *wu* (午); its phase aligns with *wu* and *gui*. It does not govern the phase qi, for Sovereign Fire is nominal and does not command the Five Phases.

*Taiyin* is Earth. Its mandate is rain; its nature, moistening; its virtue, gentleness; its distress, dusty obscurity; its triumph, ceaseless downpours; its retaliation, sleet and hail. Its transformation is five; its creatures, naked; its organ, the Spleen. Its diseases are fullness, belching, and jaundice. Its color is yellow; its flavor, sweet; its odor, fragrant. It nourishes the flesh; its indicator, the lips; its season, late summer. Its star is Saturn; its movement, at the navel; its symbol, the Curved Array. Its pulse is moderate; its trigram, *Kun* (坤); its positions, *chen* (辰), *xu* (戌), *chou* (丑), and *wei* (未). Its grain is millet; its fruit, the jujube; its livestock, the ox. Its warnings are dimness and dullness; its disasters strike the Fifth Palace. Its spirit is the *yi*; its fluid, drool. It governs *chou* (丑) and *wei* (未); its phase aligns with *jia* and *ji*.

*Shaoyang* is Ministerial Fire. Its mandate is summerheat; its nature, blazing; its virtue, fierce intensity; its distress, boiling and seething; its triumph, scorching stone; its retaliation, molten metal. Its transformation is two sevens; its creatures, winged; its organ, the Pericardium. Its diseases are madness and mania. Its color is red; its flavor, bitter; its odor, scorched. It nourishes the blood; its indicator, the tongue; its season, summer. Its star is Mars; its movement, *Laogong* (the center of the palm). Its symbol is the Vermilion Bird; its pulse, hook-like. Its trigram is *Li* (離); its positions, *si* (巳) and *wu* (午). Its grain is cinnabar; its fruit, the apricot; its livestock, the sheep. Its warnings are flipping and entanglement; its disasters strike the Ninth Palace. Its spirit is the *zhi*; its fluid, sweat. It governs *yin* (寅) and *shen* (申); its phase aligns with *wu* and *gui*.

*Yangming* is Metal. Its mandate is dryness; its nature, freezing; its virtue, clarity; its distress, stern killing; its triumph, withering and decay; its retaliation, flying ruin. Its transformation is four nines; its creatures, shelled; its organ, the Lungs. Its diseases are wheezing, coughing, and sneezing. Its color is white; its flavor, pungent; its odor, fishy. It nourishes the skin and hair; its indicator, the nose; its season, autumn. Its star is Venus; its movement, the right flank. Its symbol is the White Tiger; its pulse, floating. Its trigram is *Dui* (兌); its positions, *shen* (申) and *you* (酉). Its grain is white; its fruit, the peach; its livestock, the horse. Its warnings are frost and dew; its disasters strike the Seventh Palace. Its spirit is the *po*; its fluid, nasal mucus. It governs *mao* (卯) and *you* (酉); its phase aligns with *yi* and *geng*.

*Taiyang* is Water. Its mandate is cold; its nature, freezing; its virtue, biting chill; its distress, piercing cold; its triumph, dense frost; its retaliation, hail. Its transformation is six; its creatures, scaled; its organ, the Kidneys. Its diseases are wilting and reversal. Its color is black; its flavor, salty; its odor, putrid. It nourishes the bones; its indicator, the ears; its season, winter. Its star is Mercury; its movement, below the navel. Its symbol is the Dark Warrior; its pulse, stone-like. Its trigram is *Kan* (坎); its positions, *hai* (亥) and *zi* (子). Its grain is black; its fruit, the chestnut; its livestock, the hare. Its warnings are frost and snow; its disasters strike the First Palace. Its spirit is the *zhi*; its fluid, spittle. It governs *chen* (辰) and *xu* (戌); its phase aligns with *bing* and *xin*.

Why does *Jueyin* govern *si* (巳) and *hai* (亥)? It is called *Jueyin* Wood, and Wood is born in *hai*, thus it rightfully governs *hai* and corresponds in transformation to *si*. Though *mao* (卯) is the proper position for Wood, it is the domain where *Yangming* Metal undergoes transformation, following the source of generation to align with governance.

Why does *Shaoyin* govern *zi* (子) and *wu* (午)? It is called *Shaoyin* as the Sovereign Fire, occupying the honored position. Thus, it rightfully claims the southern *Li* position, governing *wu* in direct transformation and corresponding to *zi* in opposition.

Why does *Taiyin* govern *chou* (丑) and *wei* (未)? It is called *Taiyin* as Earth, which rules the Central Palace. Lodged in the *Kun* trigram, *Kun* resides in the southwest, occupying the *wei* position. Thus, it governs *wei* in direct transformation and corresponds to *chou* in opposition.

Why does *Shaoyang* govern *yin* (寅) and *shen* (申)? It is called *Shaoyang* as the position of Ministerial Fire, subordinate to Sovereign Fire. Though *wu* is its position, Sovereign Fire occupies it, for Fire is born in *yin*. Thus, it rightfully governs *yin* and corresponds in transformation to *shen*.

Why does *Yangming* govern *mao* (卯) and *you* (酉)? It is called *Yangming* as Metal, and *you* is the western position of Metal. Thus, it rightfully governs *you* and corresponds in transformation to *mao*.

Why does *Taiyang* govern *chen* (辰) and *xu* (戌)? It is called *Taiyang* as Water. Though Water has its position in *zi*, it is the domain where Sovereign Fire undergoes transformation. Water returns within Earth, for the Six *Wu* reside at the Celestial Gate—*xu* is this. The Six *Si* reside at the Terrestrial Door—*chen* is this. Thus, Water is subsumed by Earth’s function, governing *xu* in direct transformation and corresponding to *chen* in opposition.

What do the transformative commands signify? Why does Wind-Wood transform through three and eight? Why does Fire-Heat transform through two and seven? Why does Earth-Rain transform through five? Why does Dry-Metal transform through four and nine? Why does Cold-Water transform through one and six? These are the numbers of the Five Phases, each possessing generative and completion numbers. Thus, Water is one, Fire two, Wood three, Metal four, and Earth five—these are the generative numbers of the Five Phases. What, then, are the completion numbers? Each is its base number increased by five: Water six, Fire seven, Wood eight, Metal nine, and Earth ten. Earth has no completion number because Earth reigns over the four seasons and does not occupy a fixed direction. Moreover, numbers proceed to ten and then reverse, returning to five. Heaven has nine palaces and cannot reach ten; it turns back at nine.

How are direct and corresponding transformations clarified through root and branch? They arise from their root and are completed through their branch. What is the branch? What is the root? Direct transformation is the root; corresponding transformation is the branch. Thus, *Jueyin* directly transforms in *hai*, Wind transforms through three—this is the root, hence the generative number. It governs *si* in correspondence, Wind transforms through eight—this is the branch, hence the completion number. *Shaoyin* directly governs *wu*, Heat transforms through two—this is the root, hence the generative number. It governs *zi* in correspondence, Heat transforms through seven—this is the branch, hence the completion number. *Taiyin* directly governs *wei* and corresponds to *chou*, both transforming through Rain as five. Earth has no completion number, thus only the generative number. *Shaoyang* directly governs *yin*, Fire transforms through two—this is the root, hence the generative number. It governs *shen* in correspondence, Fire transforms through seven—this is the branch, hence the completion number. *Yangming* directly governs *you*, Dryness transforms through four—this is the root, hence the generative number. It governs *mao* in correspondence, Dryness transforms through nine—this is the branch, hence the completion number. *Taiyang* directly governs *xu*, Cold transforms through one—this is the root, hence the generative number. It governs *chen* in correspondence, Cold transforms through six—this is the branch, hence the completion number. All follow the root in generative numbers and the branch in completion numbers. Direct governance embodies the fullness of transformative command; corresponding governance embodies its emptiness.

What of left and right? They follow governance and are termed *intercalary qi*. For instance, if *Jueyin* governs Heaven, its left is *Shaoyin* and its right *Taiyang*. If *Shaoyin* governs Heaven, its left is *Taiyin* and its right *Jueyin*. If *Taiyin* governs Heaven, its left is *Shaoyang* and its right *Shaoyin*. If *Shaoyang* governs Heaven, its left is *Yangming* and its right *Taiyin*. If *Yangming* governs Heaven, its left is *Taiyang* and its right *Shaoyang*. If *Taiyang* governs Heaven, its left is *Jueyin* and its right *Yangming*. The preceding is left, the following is right. If the Northern Regulator governs Heaven, left lies in the west and right in the east. If the Southern Regulator governs Heaven, left lies in the east and right in the west. All Wood, Fire, Metal, and Water phases are governed by the Northern Regulator, while only Earth is governed by the Southern Regulator.

In all cases of governance, the *in-quarter* and the phase jointly rule the year, except for the left and right intercalary *qi*. The left governs the first three *qi*—the initial, first, and second—corresponding to Wood, Sovereign Fire, and Ministerial Fire. These three *qi* align with the left. The right governs the last three *qi*—the fourth, fifth, and final—corresponding to Earth, Metal, and Water. These three *qi* align with the right.

Why do intercalary *qi* sometimes arrive and sometimes not? For example, if *Shaoyang* Ministerial Fire governs Heaven, its left is *Yangming*. *Yangming* is Metal, and Metal retreats from Fire, failing to arrive. The corresponding transformation of Ministerial Fire in Heaven is empty; only if Water phase appears may it arrive slightly. Otherwise, it does not arrive. In all other cases, it arrives.

If *Shaoyin* governs Heaven, its left is *Taiyin*. The left governs the first, second, and third *qi*, and *Taiyin* Earth fears the initial Wood *qi*, thus arriving late. Why? After entering the second *qi*, Wood *qi* retreats from its position, only then arriving—hence its lateness. This principle applies to all others. Moreover, the left intercalary *qi* governs first, while the right intercalary *qi* governs afterward, both harmonizing with Heaven’s governance.

When it arrives, the order of precedence follows the principles described below. If the intercalary *qi* prevails over Heaven, it arrives. If Heaven prevails over the intercalary *qi*, the intercalary *qi* does not arrive—though it may arrive at another time. This also follows the principle of direct correspondence in transformation: the left intercalary *qi* circulates within the *Yang* sequence, aligning with Heaven’s governance, and arrives when it encounters the correct cyclical sign.

How is this observed? For example, in a *zi* year when *Shaoyin* governs Heaven, the left presents *Taiyin*. *Taiyin* is Earth, which governs the fifth palace. When the cyclical sign *jiazi* enters the fifth palace, it arrives. Another example: in a *chou* year when *Taiyin* governs Heaven, the left presents *Shaoyang* Ministerial Fire, which governs the ninth palace. When the cyclical sign *jiazi* shifts to *chou* and enters the *Li* palace, *Shaoyang* Ministerial Fire arrives. These two examples illustrate the method; all others follow accordingly—examine them carefully and apply.

**Observing Celestial Signs in Accordance with Heavenly Principles**
Whenever the six *qi* descend, ascend, and assume their positions, their arrival is observed through the waxing and waning of *qi*, their compliance or rebellion, and the auspicious or inauspicious omens—all reflected in the changes of the five planets’ forms, the movements of the sun and moon, and celestial phenomena. These are all responses to the *qi* governing Heaven.

At times, *qi* arrives but the star is not seen; at others, the star appears before the *qi* arrives. Some stars deviate from their proper paths or positions, appearing too early or late, growing large when they should be small, or brightening when dim. Sometimes one star appears as two, or *qi* responds while the star does not, or the star fails to appear when expected. The sun and moon may lose their proper courses, brighten excessively, or darken. They may align with *qi* and celestial signs or diverge; stars may cluster, or a star may conjoin the moon while another *qi* disrupts them. They may share the moon’s path, trespass the moon’s horns, or two stars may clash while one diminishes. Two stars may radiate light at each other—all these portend fortune or misfortune, aligning below with above and manifesting clearly in the myriad transformations.

The afflictions of the people, the seasons, and future calamities or blessings are all described in this record.

For instance, when *Shaoyin* Sovereign Fire governs Heaven, it corresponds above to the *Genhuang* star. If this star appears bright and resplendent, it signifies Sovereign Fire’s presence in Heaven. If it does not appear at the expected time, why? Unless it is a year of excessive Water *qi*, its absence is inauspicious. If Water is not excessive that year, the star should appear in Heaven; if not, it is ominous. On Earth, it should appear during the *qi*’s active phase, after half the year has passed. If it fails to appear at either of these times, it is also inauspicious.

If it appears alongside the five planets, it signifies the ruler’s neglect of governance. If it appears near the Metal star (*Venus*), with *Venus* large and bright while *Genhuang* is dim and small, it portends rebellion by military ministers. *Genhuang* resembles *Yinghuo* (*Mars*) but is redder, smaller, and lacks *Mars*’s radiant glow—its natural form is small and faintly red.

If it appears near the Water star (*Mercury*) or Wood star (*Jupiter*), it signals impending rebellion in the ministerial ranks. If near Fire (*Mars*) or Earth (*Saturn*), it also indicates disloyalty. Thus, no star should rival *Genhuang* in brilliance—all such cases signify treason.

If two *Genhuang* stars appear, they are not to be confused with *Mars*. If they are similar in size and indistinguishable, they foretell the rise of an unborn ruler in this world.

If two *Taibai* (*Venus*) stars appear, identical in size and indistinguishable, especially if close together, one is *Venus* and the other the *Gejia* star. Their appearance heralds great warfare.

If two *Yinghuo* (*Mars*) stars appear, similar in size and indistinguishable, and they remain close without deviating, one is *Mars* and the other the *Kangji* star. Their appearance foretells severe drought, which will end only when they retreat.

If two *Chen* stars (*Mercury*) appear, similar in size and indistinguishable, and they remain close without deviating, one is *Mercury* and the other the *Linze* star. Their appearance portends heavy rain. If the stars scatter and fall, it foretells heavy snow.

If two *Sui* stars (*Jupiter*) appear, similar in size and radiance, and they remain close without deviating, one is *Jupiter* and the other the *Qiangkou* star. Their appearance signals a great victory by bandits, which will manifest within half a year.

If two *Zhen* stars (*Saturn*) appear, similar in size and radiance, and they remain close without deviating, one is *Saturn* and the other the *Linyu* star. Their appearance foretells neighboring states invading borders, which will occur in the following two years. These are the inauspicious omens of the six *qi*’s interactions.

It is also said: Why does *Taibai* (*Venus*) resemble the Old Man star? In a year when Metal governs Heaven, it appears in the north during autumn. If it appears very similar to *Venus* but distant, its sighting in autumn indicates a frozen government that fails to enforce severity—signifying the nation’s longevity.

In a year when Wood governs Heaven, a *Jing* star appears in the east, as large as a half-moon and radiant, with light rays. Its appearance heralds the emergence of an enlightened ruler.

In a year when Water governs Heaven, a *Xianshi* star appears, resembling *Mercury*—pale blue-white, without radiance, and smaller than *Mercury*. If it appears distant, it signifies a worthy person living in seclusion, their name unknown.

In a year when Fire governs Heaven, a *Wenli* star appears, with four stars above and two below. The two lower stars resemble the body of the Dipper, small and red. Its appearance foretells a great plague, killing half the population. If seen, administer emetic medicine on the spring equinox to prevent illness.

In a year when Fire governs Heaven, a *Tianyu* star appears—one large and three small—often accompanied by yellow-red *qi*. Its appearance signals widespread epidemics with contagion. Administer diaphoretic medicine three times before the spring equinox to resolve it; reinforce the upper and supplement the lower to prevent illness.

When Wood governs Heaven, a *Maotou* star appears—large with long, radiant rays. This star must not scatter and fall; if it does, locusts will swarm across the land in the following three years, devouring farmlands.

In a year when Metal governs Heaven, if *Venus* approaches the *Corpse Star*—which resembles a palm star but is smaller, dim, and surrounded by a white *qi*—this is the *qi* of hidden corpses. It portends the slaughter of millions, with blood flowing for a thousand miles. If *Mars* also nears the *Corpse Star*, many will die, their bodies left exposed in the wild.

When Earth governs Heaven or resides in the Springs, a *Jiaose* star appears—resembling *Saturn* but smaller and not aligned with its celestial path. Its appearance heralds a year of abundant harvests. In a year when Earth governs Heaven, a great star appears in the south—large, yellow-white, and flickering with radiant rays. Called the *Zhanghuang Star*, it may linger for several nights, sometimes emitting sounds before scattering. As it scatters, red *qi* follows, then fades into yellow, vanishing. The next day, the sky remains windless and cloudless, yet turns yellow, and the sun appears dim. This is called the *qi* of Heavenly Stagnation, foretelling a great plague that will wipe out entire households. If seen, administer emetic and diaphoretic medicine to prevent illness. Should one contract this disease, induce vomiting and purging; warming or tonifying treatments must be avoided.

In a year when Fire governs Heaven, if the moon appears red, and this redness persists from its rising until midday without fading, it signifies severe drought. If Fire encroaches upon the moon’s horn, drought follows; if Water encroaches, heavy rains ensue. If the sun rises and remains dim from dawn to mid-morning without clouds, it portends disaster for the ruler. If the moon appears red and dim at its full phase, it foretells misfortune for the empress or concubines. If *Venus* suddenly turns red, a great wind will arise the next day. If black *qi* surges southward from the Northern Dipper, crossing the Milky Way to reach the Southern Winnowing Basket, heavy rains will follow.

When Metal governs Heaven, a great star appears in the northeast—large with radiant rays, accompanied by smaller stars below, faintly veiled in white *qi*. This is a *comet*, and its appearance foretells plunder and chaos. In a year when Wood governs Heaven, if *Jupiter* deviates from its path and drifts northward toward the Northern Dipper, lingering near the *Xuanleng* asterism and swaying east and west, it signals twelve years of national collapse, civilian suffering, and military strife.

If, in the hours before dawn (between midnight and the hour of the Ox), an image resembling the rising sun appears in the east—with red *qi* rising high and spreading across the eastern sky—then, after the *qi* disperses, two great stars emerge and remain visible until sunrise, this is called the *Jing Star*. Its appearance foretells national disaster and the ruin of agriculture. If *Venus* appears in the east at dawn during a yang year as the *Morning Star*, or in the west at dusk during a yin year as *Venus*, yet fails to follow its proper celestial path, it signals military chaos and governance in disarray.

If, at sunrise, white *qi* resembling an overturned boat appears in the east, it foretells mass slaughter, famine, and widespread illness. If, at dusk, clouds appear dim and not dark, on the verge of dispersing yet transforming into shapes like dragons, tigers, geese, or wild geese, it signifies treacherous ministers plotting rebellion. Whenever stars appear during the day, it portends disloyal subjects. If the Five Planets deviate from their paths, they foretell fortune or misfortune.

In a year when Wood governs the *qi* of the year and Wood governs Heaven, *Jupiter* should appear large and bright. If Wood’s *qi* aligns with the *Celestial Sign* but Wood is insufficient, Metal will overpower it, causing *Venus* to appear unusually large and bright. If *Venus* shares the same celestial path as *Jupiter*, yet *Jupiter* appears small while *Venus* dominates, their proximity foretells that seven years later, the people will fall ill—suffering from wind-dryness disorders. Treat with bitter and hot medicines, assisted by sour and neutral remedies.

In a year when Fire governs the *qi* of the year and Fire governs Heaven, if Fire aligns with the *Celestial Sign* but Water counteracts it, *Mars* should appear large, yet *Mercury* appears instead. If *Mercury* shares the same path as *Mars*, yet *Mars* is faint, three years later, the people will fall ill—suffering from cold-heat disorders. Treat with sweet and warm medicines, assisted by bitter and hot remedies.

In a year when Earth governs the *qi* of the year and Earth governs Heaven, if Earth aligns with the *Celestial Sign* but Wood overpowers it, *Saturn* should appear large, yet *Jupiter* appears instead. If *Jupiter* shares the same path as *Saturn*, yet *Saturn* is faint while *Jupiter* shines brightly nearby, eight years later, the people will fall ill—suffering from wind-dampness disorders. Treat with acrid and cooling medicines, assisted by sweet and warm remedies.

In a year when Metal governs the *qi* of the year and Metal governs Heaven, if Metal is insufficient and Fire overpowers it, *Venus* should appear large, yet *Mars* appears instead. If *Mars* shares the same path as *Venus*, yet *Venus* is faint while *Mars* blazes brightly nearby, six years later, the people will fall ill—suffering from vexing dryness. Treat with salty and cold medicines, assisted by acrid and cooling remedies.

In a year when Water governs the *qi* of the year and Water governs Heaven, if Water is insufficient and Earth overpowers it, *Mercury* should appear large, yet *Saturn* appears instead. If *Saturn* shares the same path as *Mercury*, yet *Mercury* is faint while *Saturn* shines brightly nearby, six years later, the people will fall ill—suffering from cold-dampness disorders. Treat with sour and neutral medicines, assisted by salty and cold remedies.

The years of illness are determined by the generative numbers of the Five Phases. For instance, when Wood is punished by Metal, the affliction lasts seven years—Wood’s number is three, Metal’s four, together making seven. The illness manifests as wind-dryness, a combination of Metal and Wood disorders. The treatment should first restrain Metal’s excess, then replenish Wood’s deficiency.

When Fire is punished by Water, the affliction lasts three years—Water’s number is one, Fire’s two, together making three. The illness manifests as cold-heat, a combination of Water and Fire disorders. The treatment should first restrain Water’s dominance, then replenish Fire’s deficiency.

When Earth is punished by Wood, the affliction lasts eight years—Wood’s number is three, Earth’s five, together making eight. The illness manifests as wind-dampness, a combination of Wood and Earth disorders. The treatment should first restrain Wood’s dominance, then replenish Earth’s deficiency.

When Metal is punished by Fire, the affliction lasts six years—Fire’s number is two, Metal’s four, together making six. The illness manifests as vexing dryness, a combination of Fire and Metal disorders. The treatment should first restrain Fire’s dominance, then replenish Metal’s deficiency.

When Water is punished by Earth, the affliction lasts six years—Water’s number is one, Earth’s five, together making six. The illness manifests as cold-dampness, a combination of Water and Earth disorders. The treatment should first restrain Earth’s excess, then replenish Water’s deficiency.

In all years of mutual conquest and retaliation, if the stars do not share the same celestial degree or do not overcome one another, these symptoms will not appear. If there is only mutual conquest and retaliation without subjugation between the stars, there will be no such illness or disaster.

The sun’s radiant majesty is the great standard of luminous order, the guiding principle of light and shadow, the essence of all yang, and the symbol of all nobility. When the sun is vast and its light travels unimpeded, the world knows peace. When the sun rises with a white glow, yang lacks virtue. When the sun sets without light, yang suffers punishment. When the sun’s light shines brilliantly, the ruler falls ill. When the sun has risen a pole’s height yet remains dim and colorless without clouds, the people suffer. When the sun is two poles from setting in the west yet remains dim, people die. When the sun passes midday yet remains half-dark, the ruler’s Way is deficient, and the people lose their livelihood.

When the sun has two "feet," many warlords rise. When the sun shows red "feet," the state faces urgent invasion. When the sun hangs with "fangs," barbarians invade, and generals are deployed. When the sun has "double ears," the Son of Heaven gains territory. When a yellow aura embraces the sun, the chief minister is inwardly loyal. When the sun darkens at midday, failing to emerge, great floods occur. When the sun is dark at noon, yin prevails, and treacherous ministers control the ruler.

When the sun has black light, within sixty days the five grains will be damaged, and great floods will come. When the sun has six "ears," within sixty days the state will perish. When the sun has a red aura like a crown at its side, or "ears" appear with a grasping form, and the shape suggests warfare, great winds will rise, followed by violent rain. When the spring sun has four "ears," the Son of Heaven will have a grandson within three years.

When an aura like a tiger strikes the sun, a general will rebel. When a green dragon guards the sun, ministers plot against the ruler. When green qi rises above and below the sun, it is auspicious to deploy troops. When green and red qi obscure the rising sun, a great battle is certain. When the sun has a tiger-like red aura at its side, ten thousand will die. When the sun is colorless, or a red qi like a star leaps within it, the ruler faces misfortune.

When an aura two feet wide appears east or west of the sun, the state will face sorrow and war. When a black qi like a coiled dragon appears above the sun, great winds will come. At the winter solstice, if clouds greet and send off the sun at sunrise and sunset, the year will bring epidemics among the people. Red clouds foretell drought, white clouds war, yellow clouds plague, black clouds great floods, and green clouds great winds.

When the sun has a double yellow halo, winds and rains will come in season, bringing abundant harvests and low prices. When the sun has a white halo, within ninety days violent warfare will erupt, the year will see many sudden illnesses, and nobles will fall sick. When the sun has a triple green halo, the state will face excessive wind and rain; within ninety days, the queen will suffer disaster, and winter thunder or summer snow will occur.

When the sun has a double red halo, the disaster will strike below; the land where it appears will suffer locusts, two hundred days of drought, high grain prices, rampant banditry, and minor military conflicts. When the sun has four halos, the Four Seas will see war, lasting one year. When the sun’s halo is half-formed like a cauldron lid, it portends reconciliation with a distant and harmonious state. When the sun has three halos, the feudal lords will rebel. When the sun has five halos, the year will bring famine and high grain prices. When the sun has ten halos, the world will perish, the earth will yield nothing, and this will last five years.

When a star falls as earth, great famine and bloodshed follow. When a star falls as sand, armies are defeated and states perish. When a star falls as metal, great war arises. When a star falls as stone, disaster strikes those below. When a white rainbow appears, or Saturn scatters into a rainbow, and a white rainbow emerges beneath it, blood will flow. When a white rainbow pierces the sun, close ministers will betray the ruler. When a white rainbow appears in the east in summer, wheat will be expensive. Wherever a white rainbow appears, the state will see killing. When a white rainbow circles a city but does not complete the loop, the side from which it comes will prevail in attack.

When a rainbow appears in the west, the year will bring disaster to women. When a rainbow arches over a city, blood will flow beneath it. When a red rainbow descends straight from the heavens to point at a state, that land will face chaos and ruin. When a rainbow bends like a snake with its head pointing downward, the people below will fall ill. When a rainbow appears with the sun in the east, the year will be inauspicious. When a rainbow lingers to the left of the sun without dissipating, those who see it will face disaster.

When a white qi appears below Venus, great war will come. When a green qi appears below Jupiter, great winds will come. When a yellow qi appears below Saturn, great plague will come. When a black qi appears below Mercury, great floods will come. When a red qi appears below Mars, great drought will come. When the moon has a halo with a star inside, great winds will come. When a black qi appears behind the moon, great rains will come.

When the moon has a shadow like a small moon above it, the state will face conflict. When the moon has a double halo, wind and rain will come. When the moon has four halos, the four gates of the state will face chaos and misgovernance. When the moon’s halo has clouds like hands at its side, the people will face disaster. When the moon has three large "feet" below it, ten thousand will die. When the moon should be full but is not, and white clouds follow it on all sides, the queen will face disaster. When the moon’s two horns have large stars, the people will face disaster.

When a large star appears behind the moon, with many small stars below, hail will come. When a black qi emerges from the moon and turns red, on the third day a black wind will come. When a white qi emerges from the moon, great snow will come. When Venus moves through the constellations with its rays sharp above and broad below, advancing and retreating in proper measure, appearing at the appointed time, the world will prosper. When Venus is high, small, and bright, shining without rays, it portends great peace. When Venus is large and radiant with rays, it portends warfare.

When Venus enters the moon and the star’s color is distinct, ministers plot against the ruler. When the moon eclipses Venus like a solar eclipse, loyal ministers will be executed. When Venus appears in the west, the moon in the north, and a star in the north, the state will face powerful warfare.

When a star appears south of the moon, Chinese armies will prevail in the southern lands. When Venus and the moon draw near, if the space between them allows three fingers’ breadth, it portends warfare; if two fingers’ breadth, it portends city distress.

When Venus lies north of Saturn, lands will be lost and the state will perish. When Venus stands high and bright in the west, appearing early, it portends a powerful army. When Venus appears in the east and remains visible after sunrise, it portends armed conflict.

When Venus should appear but does not, it is inauspicious. When many stars gather beside the moon, encircling it once like a courtyard wall, it portends the state’s victory. When a purple qi swirls around the moon, the empress and consorts possess virtue.

When the moon is full and bright, its brightness vast and still as if motionless, the empress and consorts possess virtue. When the moon is full yet dim, lacking radiance, the empress and consorts face calamity. When the moon remains bright even in daylight, the ruler lacks virtue.

*Recorded by Qi Xuzi*

**Heavenly Cycles and Their Annual Encounters**

**Jiazi Year (1st Celestial Stem, 1st Earthly Branch):**
Above, the upright *zheng* phase prevails. Lesser Yin’s sovereign fire governs heaven, with heat prevailing above. Its transformation is abundant yet insubstantial, triumphant yet inviting retaliation. The earthly *qi* of the year aligns harmoniously with fire, for fire engenders earth. The heat transformation is seven—a number derived from the branch’s completion. Below, it encroaches upon the lung *qi*; above, white *qi* ascends to serve heaven, signifying the dominance of the long *qi*. Great summer heat spreads, and the people suffer from panting, coughing, alternating chills and fever, snoring, sneezing, and nasal congestion—all rooted in the lung. The *jia*-type insects perish. When the triumph is extreme, water arrives to retaliate, and the cold *qi* reverses its function. The heart viscera fall ill, feathered insects emerge, and the summer heat of heaven turns to cold. The celestial body *Chenxing* (Mercury) appears abnormally large, while *Genhuang* (a stellar marker) dims.

**Jiawu Year (7th Celestial Stem, 7th Earthly Branch):**
Above, the upright *zheng* phase prevails. Lesser Yin’s sovereign fire governs heaven, with heat prevailing above. Its transformation is abundant and substantial, triumphant yet without retaliation. The heat transformation is two—a number derived from the stem’s generation. The long *qi* flourishes, great summer heat spreads, the lung *qi* rises, and white *qi* serves heaven. The lung falls ill, and *jia*-type insects perish. The people suffer from heat prevailing above. Treat with salty-cold substances, for water’s nature and flavor subdue the triumph of fire-heat. Avoid consuming bitter-heat foods, which would aid fire’s dominance. Above, *Genhuang* shines brightly, while *Taibai* (Venus) loses its luster.

**Yichou Year (2nd Celestial Stem, 2nd Earthly Branch):**
Above, the upright *gong* phase prevails. Greater Yin’s earth governs heaven. Its transformation is abundant yet insubstantial, triumphant yet inviting retaliation. The year’s metal *qi* and heaven’s earth mutually engender, and the rain transformation is five. Below, it suppresses the kidney *qi*, which weakens; black *qi* serves heaven, and the transforming *qi* triumphs. Damp *qi* flourishes, the kidney viscera fall ill, and the illness lingers in the bladder. Scaled insects perish. The people suffer from impotence, extreme debility with intermittent recovery, lumbar pain, and difficulty in movement. When the triumph is extreme, wood arrives to retaliate. Great winds arise frequently, and the people suffer from spleen and stomach ailments. *Baochong*-type insects perish. *Suixing* (Jupiter) appears abnormally, while *Zhenxing* (Saturn) dims.

Feathered creatures perish, and those with chronic heart illness die. When triumph is profound, earth’s rains arrive, and earth’s transformation is hindered. Dust and dampness revive, and continuous rain falls. Kidney illness arises, and scaled creatures suffer disaster in reverse. *Zhenxing* shines brightly, while *Chenyao* conceals itself—this is called a *Heavenly Conformity*, and the retaliation is half-suppressed.

**Dinghai Year (4th Celestial Stem, 12th Earthly Branch):**
Above, the upright *jiao* phase prevails. *Jueyin* wood governs heaven, with wind prevailing above. Its upright transformation is abundant and substantial, triumphant yet without retaliation.

*Qixuanzi’s Exposition*
*Divination of Qi and Yun: The Record of Cycles*

Movement is motion—circulation, recurrence, and revolution. Within the ascent and descent of the Great Void, above and below summon one another, and the signs of *qi* governing the turning of *yun* emerge.

Since the primordial beginning, when heaven and earth first parted, within the dual *qi* of ascent and descent, there has been the revolving, recurring *qi*, all endowed with the Five Phases. Thus, it is called the Five *Yun*. Specifically:
- Earth *yun* operates between *jia* and *ji*,
- Metal *yun* between *yi* and *geng*,
- Wood *yun* between *ding* and *ren*,
- Fire *yun* between *wu* and *gui*,
- Water *yun* between *bing* and *xin*.

Within these Ten Celestial Stems, the Five *Qi* circulate—this is called *yunqi*.

Within the second *jia* interval, within the governance of *Sitiān* and *Zaiquan*, it is thus named the Three Origins. When the Three Origins unite, movement begins. Thereupon, the Three Powers, the Four Seasons, and the Six *Qi*—all transformations and creations—arise from this.

Thus, some receive the heavenly mandate yet fail to transform; some punish earthly transformations yet fail to generate; some are subjected to heavenly governance yet the *yun* does not respond; some are borne by earth yet the *qi* is not concentrated. Some exceed and self-triumph; some fall short and suffer punishment from others; some self-deplete yet return to equilibrium. Therefore, the heavenly mandate responds to transformation, earthly products generate and complete, the Four Seasons alternate in correctness, and the myriad transformations wither and flourish—all arise from this.

Hence, auspicious omens and inauspicious portents become visible; peace and calamity may be foreknown; famine and abundance likewise depend on this; the people’s illnesses and disasters may also be verified.

Thus, the arrival has its day, observation has its time, and examination has its method. One must also divine by direction, calculate by position, and observe the hour—it cannot be perceived carelessly. It is necessary to scrutinize the days’ count, for there are inherent calculations of addition, subtraction, generation, completion, advance, and retreat.

One must also purify, fast, and abstain before observing—do not reveal this to the unworthy.

This method begins from the first day of the first month of the *jiazi* year of the first year of Linde in the Great Tang (a *jiyou* day), when the Metal Dog of *Lou* descended first. The accumulated years then subtract one; the next follows the sevenfold principle.

Next, divide by nineteen and subtract one—this is called the intercalary number. Then multiply by twelve, and after multiplying, add the intercalary number, followed by the number of the current month. Next, separately expand the lower position and then halve it. Then remove the intercalary number and further eliminate the Five Phases. Next, advance the upper position by one place and multiply by three. Then extract the number from the lower position—this is called "removing the lesser completion." Afterward, add the day under the month to determine the total. Then subtract sixty repeatedly; if there is a remainder, multiply it by one hundred. Again, subtract eighty-seven repeatedly; the remainder is then added to the *yun* number. If it exceeds, use the #3 completion number; if deficient, add the generative number to see the result.

In a yang year, if an even number is encountered, add one; in a yin year, if an odd number is encountered, subtract one. This number corresponds to the *ke* within the day. For excess *yun*, the twenty-four methods of all *yun* arrive on their appointed day; the qi *yun* arrives at its designated hour. Thus, excess arrives thirteen days early, deficiency arrives thirteen days late, balanced *qi yun* coincides with the ruling heaven on the same day, heavenly punishment *yun* arrives five days after the ruling heaven, and earthly punishment *yun* arrives six days after the ruling heaven. The calculations and methods have their own appointed times and hours.

1. *Jiazi*: *Jia* Earth *yun* in excess, *zi* as a yang year. The counting number increases by six—why? *Zi* belongs to *Kan*, its number is one; Earth *yun* has no completion number, so its number is five.

**Heavenly Punishment: Excessive *Yun* Chapter**
**Heavenly Judgment: Six Methods of the *Yun* in Yang Years**

Over thirty years in a yang year, when the *yun* should be excessive but is restrained by the *si tian* (Controller of Heaven), it cannot reach full excess. Thus, it is neither excessive nor deficient, resulting in no disasters, no overcoming, and no retaliation—this is because it is not a yin year.

1. *Gengzi*: *Geng* Metal *yun* in excess, *zi* as a yang year. The counting number increases by five—why?
*Zi* belongs to *kan*, its number is one. *Geng* Metal *yun* in a yang year should be excessive, but with *shaoyin* Sovereign Fire as the *si tian* above, it restrains the Metal *yun* below. Fire suppresses Metal’s excess, preventing it from being excessive. Its number follows the generating cycle, thus adding only four. One and four together make five, hence adding five *ke*.
When the *yun* transitions, face *shen* and gaze forward. *Geng* is lodged in *shen*, so only a white *qi* appears, flowing from *geng* to *zi* and concluding. At the end, a red *qi* from Heaven descends to restrain the Metal *qi*, preventing Metal from harming Wood. This is neither a yin year nor an excessive *yun*, hence called the *Heavenly Judgment Yun*.

2. *Gengwu*: *Geng* Metal *yun* should be excessive, *wu* as a yang year. The counting number increases by thirteen—why?
*Wu* belongs to *li*, its number is nine. *Geng* Metal *yun* should be excessive, but with *shaoyin* Sovereign Fire as the *si tian* above, it restrains the Metal *yun* below. Fire suppresses Metal’s excess, preventing it from being excessive. Its number follows the generating cycle, which is four. Four and nine together make thirteen, hence adding thirteen *ke*.
When the *yun* transitions, face *shen* and gaze forward. Only a white *qi* appears, flowing from *geng* to *wu* and concluding. At the end, a red *qi* from Heaven descends to restrain the Metal *qi*, preventing it from being excessive. This is neither a yang nor yin year.

3. *Gengyin*: *Geng* Metal *yun* should be excessive, *yin* as a yang year. The counting number increases by twelve—why?
*Yin* belongs to *gen*, its number is eight. *Geng* Metal *yun* should be excessive, but with *shaoyang* Minister Fire as the *si tian* above, Fire suppresses Metal’s excess below, preventing it from being excessive. Its number follows the generating cycle, which is four. Four and eight together make twelve, hence adding twelve *ke*.
When the *yun* transitions, face *shen* and gaze forward. Only a white *qi* appears, flowing from *geng* to *yin* and concluding. At the end, a red *qi* from Heaven descends to restrain the Metal *yun*, preventing it from being excessive and thus unable to harm Wood.

4. *Gengshen*: *Geng* Metal *yun* should be excessive, *shen* as a yang year. The counting number increases by six—why?
*Shen* belongs to *kun*, its number is two. *Geng* Metal *yun* should be excessive, but with *shaoyang* Minister Fire as the *si tian* above, it restrains the Metal *yun* below. Fire suppresses Metal’s excess, preventing it from being excessive. Following its generating number, which is four, four and two together make six, hence adding six *ke*.
When the *yun* transitions, face *shen* and gaze forward. Only a white *qi* appears, rising straight from *geng* without flowing horizontally. *Geng* is lodged in *shen*, so the *qi* rises directly. Later, a red *qi* from Heaven descends to restrain it, preventing excess. This is not a yin year, and its *qi* cannot harm Wood.

5. *Wuxu*: *Wu* Fire *yun* should be excessive, *xu* as a yang year. The counting number increases by seven—why?
*Xu* belongs to Earth, its number is five. *Wu* Fire *yun* should be excessive, but with *taiyang* Cold Water as the *si tian* above, it restrains the Fire *yun* below, preventing excess. Following its generating number, which is two, two and five together make seven, hence adding seven *ke*.
When the *yun* transitions, face *si* and gaze forward. First, a yellow *qi* appears, then a red *qi* flows horizontally, from *wu* to *xu* and concludes. At the end, a black *qi* from Heaven descends to restrain the Fire *qi*, preventing excess.

6. *Wuchen*: *Wu* Fire *yun* should be excessive, *chen* as a yang year. The counting number increases by seven—why?
*Chen* belongs to Earth, its number is five. *Wu* Fire *yun* should be excessive, but with *taiyang* Cold Water as the *si tian* above, Water suppresses Fire’s excess below, preventing it from being excessive. Following its generating number, which is two, two and five together make seven, hence adding seven *ke*.
When the *yun* transitions, face *si* and gaze forward. First, a yellow *qi* appears, then a red *qi* flows from *wu* to *chen* and concludes. At the end, a black *qi* from Heaven descends to restrain the Fire *yun*, preventing it from harming Metal. Thus, it is neither excessive nor a yin year.

The methods of *pingqi* (balanced *qi*) *yun* total sixteen, but here are thirteen. Among the four-year conjunctions, three are removed as they coincide with *tianfu*, hence thirteen.

1. *Jiwei*: *Ji* Earth *yun* is yin and thus insufficient. *Wei* is a yin year, and above it meets *Taiyin* Earth as the *sitian* (celestial controller), harmonizing its virtue, hence called *tianfu*. The *fu* aligns with *Ji* Earth *yun*’s *qi*, making it balanced, thus called *pingqi*. The arriving *qi* matches the *sitian* on the same day. The counting number for *wei* as Earth is five; *ji* gains the balanced *qi* and adds five. One added to one is subtracted, so it is neither insufficient nor excessive.
When the *yun* transitions, face *wei*. Since *ji* is lodged in *wei*, a purple *qi* first appears. After it fades, a yellow *qi* rises upward to the heavens, where it meets another yellow *qi* from the sky, thus harmonizing with celestial *qi*. No other colors appear—inquire for auspiciousness.

**The *Yun* Encounters Overstepping and Connects with the Era: The Twenty Methods of *Tuo Lin***

*Tuo Lin* refers to years within the sixty *jiazi* cycle where the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches do not correspond—these are years of great misfortune. Yet not every such year results in *tuo lin*; it may occur once in over a hundred years, bringing widespread ruin where the people and agriculture fall into desolation.

The "twenty methods" account for forty years within the sixty-year cycle, from remote antiquity to the present, where *yun* and *qi* consistently correspond without *tuo*. There are twelve years of *shou zhi* (Stem-Guarding), where correspondence remains unbroken:
1. *Jia-yin*
2. *Yi-mao*
3. *Wu-wu*
4. *Ji-wei*
5. *Geng-shen*
6. *Xin-you*
7. *Bing-wu*
8. *Ding-wei*
9. *Ren-zi*
10. *Gui-chou*
11. *Wu-xu*
12. *Ji-si*

These twelve years of *shou zhi* maintain unbroken correspondence.

Next are twelve years of *tianfu* (Celestial Correspondence), where *yun* and *qi* also align:
1. *Wu-zi* (same as *shou zhi*)
2. *Wu-wu* (same as *shou zhi*)
3. *Wu-yin*
4. *Wu-shen*
5. *Bing-xu*
6. *Bing-chen*
7. *Ji-chou*
8. *Ji-wei* (same as *shou zhi*, conflicting with *shou zhi* year)
9. *Yi-mao* (same as *shou zhi*)
10. *Yi-you*
11. *Ding-si*
12. *Ding-hai*

Among these twelve *tianfu* years, three coincide with *shou zhi*, leaving nine distinct years.

Next are twelve years of *di he* (Earthly Harmony), where correspondence remains unbroken:
1. *Geng-zi*
2. *Geng-wu*
3. *Xin-chou*
4. *Xin-wei*
5. *Ren-yin*
6. *Ren-shen*
7. *Gui-you*
8. *Gui-wei*
9. *Jia-chen*
10. *Jia-xu*
11. *Gui-si*
12. *Gui-hai*

These twelve years of *di he* maintain unbroken correspondence.

Next are ten years of *zhi fu* (Direct Correspondence), where *yun* and *qi* also align:
1. *Ren-chen*
2. *Ren-xu*
3. *Bing-wu* (same as *shou zhi*)
4. *Bing-zi*
5. *Bing-yin*
6. *Bing-shen*
7. *Xin-mao*
8. *Xin-you* (same as *shou zhi*)
9. *Yi-wei* (same as *shou zhi* and *tianfu*)
10. *Ji-chou* (same as *tianfu*)

Among these ten years, five coincide with others. Within the above forty-six years, eight overlap, leaving thirty-eight distinct years. Additionally, *jia-zi* as the *yuan shou* (Origin Head) maintains correspondence, and *ding-mao* as the *sui hui* (Yearly Convergence) also remains unbroken—adding two more years. In total, forty years maintain unbroken correspondence, with only twenty years experiencing *tuo lin*:

1. *Yi-chou*: At the *yun* transition, face *chen* and gaze forward. Only green *qi* appears; white *qi* emerges but then recedes, failing to reach *chou*—this is *yi* not corresponding to *chou*, a year of great misfortune.

14. *Yi-wei*: The reckoning follows a yin year. At the *yun* transition, face *chen* and gaze forward. First, green *qi* appears; white *qi* emerges but then recedes, failing to reach *wei*—this is *yi* not corresponding to *wei*.
15. *Ding-you*: The reckoning follows a yin year. At the *yun* transition, face *wei* and gaze forward. First, red *qi* appears; blue-green *qi* emerges but then recedes, failing to reach *you*—this is *ding* not corresponding to *you*.
16. *Ji-hai*: The reckoning follows a yin year. At the *yun* transition, face *wei* and gaze forward. First, purple *qi* appears; yellow *qi* emerges but then recedes, failing to reach *hai*—this is *ji* not corresponding to *hai*.

17. *Yi-si*: The reckoning follows a yin year. At the *yun* transition, face *chen* and gaze forward. First, green *qi* appears; white *qi* emerges but then recedes, failing to reach *si*—this is *yi* not corresponding to *si*.

18. *Ji-you*: The reckoning follows a yin year. At the *yun* transition, face *wei* and gaze forward. First, purple *qi* appears; yellow *qi* emerges but then recedes, failing to reach *you*—this is *ji* not corresponding to *you*.

19. *Geng-xu*: The reckoning follows a yang year. At the *yun* transition, face *shen* and gaze forward. First, white *qi* appears but then recedes, failing to reach *xu*—this is *geng* not corresponding to *xu*.

20. *Xin-hai*: The reckoning follows a yin year. At the *yun* transition, face *xu* and gaze forward. First, warm white *qi* appears; black *qi* emerges but then recedes, failing to reach *hai*—this is *xin* not corresponding to *hai*.

The above are all cases of *tuo lin* ("detached correspondence"). This does not necessarily occur every year; it is only when the *qi* of the *yun* fails to arrive that the Heavenly Stem does not correspond to the Earthly Branch, all indicating inauspicious years.

**Chapter on Disasters and Transformations in the Cycle of *Yun***
**Twelve Methods of Punitive *Yun***

These methods apply to six yin years and six yang years.

1. *Ren-zi*: *Ren* Wood *yun*, *zi* yang year. When the *yun* transitions, the reckoning follows the preceding method. Beneath the Wood *yun*, it encounters *yang ming* Metal as the *zai quan*. Metal comes to punish Wood: white mists rise on all sides, bearing down upon the Wood *yun*. The punitive *qi* is weak and diminished, so the Earth’s power is lesser than Heaven’s decree.

2. *Ren-wu*: *Ren* Wood *yun*, *wu* yang year. When the *qi* and *yun* transition, the reckoning follows the preceding method. After the *qi* passes, below lies *yang ming* Metal. White *qi* is frequently seen in the mountains and valleys, repeatedly punishing the Wood *qi*. The Wood *qi* is faint and small, unable to overcome the victory, so the Earth prevails over the *yun*.

3. *Gui-chou*: Fire *yun* is insufficient. When the *yun* and *qi* transition, the reckoning follows the preceding method. Below, it encounters *tai yang* Cold Water as the *zai quan*. After the *yun* *qi* passes, black *qi* frequently rises, appearing dim and dark from afar. It punishes the Fire *yun* from above, leaving its *qi* insufficient and the transformation of heat bereft of its mandate.

4. *Gui-wei*: Fire *yun* is insufficient. When the *qi* and *yun* transition, the reckoning follows the preceding method. After the *yun* *qi* passes, Earth Water comes to punish. Black *qi* arises from the Earth, overpowering the Fire *yun* from above. Its *qi* is insufficient, and the decree of heat’s transformation weakens, losing half its force.

5. *Jia-yin*: Earth *yun*, which is excessive. When reckoning the *yun*, the later *qi* is unified. After the *yun* passes, below appears *jue yin* Wood as the *zai quan*. At times, green mists rise on all sides; from afar, forests appear as if veiled in smoke, yet remain verdant. Thus, the Earth’s *qi* frequently manifests, and the transformation of Earth—rain and dampness—must still lose its mandate.

6. *Jia-shen*: Opposite to *jia-yin* in transformation, it also encounters *jue yin* Wood as the *zai quan* below, punishing the Earth *yun*. The transformation of rain and dampness is the same as in *jia-yin*.

7. *Yi-mao*: Metal *yun* is insufficient. Its reckoning is diminished, and the *qi* conditions follow the preceding method. After the *yun* *qi* passes, below it encounters *shao yin* Sovereign Fire as the *zai quan*. Heat steams from the Earth, and red *qi* ascends, coming to punish the Metal *yun*. Thus, the decree of dryness and clarity is all deficient, instead giving rise to the transformation of heat—this is the mutation of the Earth’s *yun*.

8. *Yi-you*: Metal *yun* follows the preceding method. Below, it encounters *shao yin* Sovereign Fire as the *zai quan*, punishing the Metal *yun* from above. The decree of clarity and dryness is deficient, instead generating the decree of heat, just as in *yi-mao*.

9. *Bing-chen*: Water *yun*. Below, it encounters *tai yin* Earth as the *zai quan*. The *yun*’s decree and *qi* conditions follow the excessive pattern. Afterward, there is yellow, stagnant *qi*, and distant mists appear dim. Earth comes to restrain Water. Thus, the decree of cold is reversed to warmth, and winter brings light rain.

10. *Bing-xu*: Water *yun*. Below, it encounters *tai yin* Earth as the *zai quan*. When reckoning the *yun* *qi*, the method follows the preceding pattern. Earth *qi* lies below, punishing the cold transformation from above, just as in the decree of *bing-chen*.

11. *Yi-si*: *Yi* Metal *yun*. The method of observing the *qi* and *yun* is the same as before. After the *yun* passes, below it encounters *shao yang* Minister Fire as the *zai quan*. Heat moves upon the Earth, steaming the Earth’s *qi*. Flames illuminate the countryside. Thus, the Metal *yun* loses its proper decree and instead transforms into Fire.

12. *Yi-hai*: *Yi* Metal *yun*. The method of observation follows the preceding description. Below, it encounters Minister Fire, which overcomes the Metal *yun*, instead generating the decree of heat. In the six yang years, the victory is slight; in the six yin years, the victory is severe.

**Ten Methods of Intercalary Punitive *Yun***

1. *Yi-si*: Central Metal *yun*. The reckoning follows a yin year. At the *yun* transition, if white *qi* and red *qi* arrive together, this indicates the *qi* of Fire’s victory. If red *qi* arrives subsequently, this is the left intercalary *qi*—*shao yin* Sovereign Fire—secondarily punishing the insufficiency of Metal.

2. *Gui-si*: The reckoning follows a yin year. At the *yun* transition, if black *qi* and red *qi* arrive together, this indicates Water coming to prevail. If black *qi* arrives subsequently, this is *tai yang* Water as the right intercalary *qi*.

3. *Bing-zi*: The reckoning follows a yang year. The *qi* of a yang year has no distinct color. Only after the red *qi* of *bing-wu* has fully appeared, then black *qi* from *bing* to *zi* arrives. If yellow *qi* arrives instead, this is the *tian xu* ("Heavenly Void") of oppositional transformation, with *tai yin* Earth *qi* coming as the left intercalary *qi*. Though the intercalary *qi* is secondary, the *si tian* ("Controller of Heaven") also arrives—this is the intercalary *yun*. Where there is punishment, it will arrive.

4. *Jia-zi*: The reckoning follows a yang year. At the *yun* transition, yellow *qi* arrives from *jia* to *zi*. If green *qi* arrives subsequently, this is the left intercalary *qi*—*jue yin* Wood coming to punish the Wood *yun*. Earth is the southern ruler, so Wood is on the left.

5. *Yi-mao*: The reckoning follows a yin year. At the *yun* transition, white *qi* appears first, then red *qi* arrives together with it, indicating Fire coming to overcome Metal. If red *qi* arrives subsequently, this is the right intercalary *qi*—the *qi* of Minister Fire.

6. *Gui-mao*: The reckoning follows a yin year. At the *yun* transition, red *qi* appears first, with black *qi* arriving together with it, indicating Water coming to overcome Fire. If black *qi* arrives subsequently, this is the left intercalary *qi*—the *qi* of *tai yang* Water.

7. *Yi-chou*: The reckoning follows a yin year. At the *yun* transition, red *qi* appears first, arriving together with white *qi*, indicating Fire coming to overcome Metal. If red *qi* arrives subsequently, this is the left intercalary *qi*—Minister Fire coming to punish Metal.

8. Moreover, if there is a sovereign Fire as the right intercalary *qi*, when the left intercalary *qi* arrives, the right does not; when the right arrives, the left does not. Thus, an additional year is established, making the count eight.

9. *Ren-shen*: The reckoning follows a yang year. At the *yun* transition, as in a yin year, if white *qi* arrives later, this is the left intercalary *qi* of *yang ming*, punishing the Wood *yun*.

10. *Bing-shen*: The reckoning follows a yang year. At the *yun* transition, after black *qi* passes, if yellow *qi* appears as in a yin year, this is the right intercalary *qi*—*tai yin* Earth coming to punish the Water *yun*.

**Five Methods of Guest *Qi* Punishing the *Yun***

1. When the Wood *yun* is insufficient, Metal prevails. If a guest *qi* arrives subsequently, it becomes the residing *qi*—termed the "lesser intercalary *qi*." Observing the time, if the *qi* arrives obliquely, though its color is faint, it traverses the *yun* horizontally—this is the guest *qi*. If there is a prevailing *qi*, it does not arrive; if there is none, it does. This is the small white *qi* piercing through the Wood *yun*.

2. When the Fire *yun* is insufficient, Water prevails. If the *qi* arrives simultaneously, and *tai yang* comes to reside, this is black *qi* traversing the Fire *qi* horizontally.

3. When the Earth *yun* is insufficient, Wood *qi* arrives together, and *jue yin* comes to reside—this is green *qi* traversing the Earth *qi* horizontally.

4. When the Metal *yun* is insufficient, Fire *qi* arrives together, and Minister Fire comes to reside—this is red *qi* traversing the white *qi* horizontally. Sovereign Fire is likewise in *wu*.

5. When the Water *yun* is insufficient, yellow *qi* arrives together, and *tai yin* comes to reside—this is yellow *qi* piercing through the black *qi*.

**Six Methods of Heavenly Correspondence Overcoming the *Yun***

Among the balanced *qi*, there are six heavenly correspondences, which occur in yin years and differ from these six overcoming heavenly correspondences.

1. *Wu-zi*: The Fire *yun* is excessive. The reckoning follows a yang year, with red *qi* extending from *wu* to *zi*. Its *qi* is bright and distinct, and the heavens bear red *qi* in accord. Above, it joins with the virtue of *shao yin* Sovereign Fire. The term "overcoming heavenly correspondence" refers to self-overcoming, thus punishing Metal.

2. *Wu-wu*: Likewise, the Fire *yun* is excessive. The reckoning follows a yang year, with red *qi* extending from *wu* to *wu*. The heavens bear red *qi* in accord. When the *qi* converges, if the sky is free of clouds, it portends auspiciousness—hence the name "overcoming."

3. *Wu-yin*: The Fire *yun* is excessive. Above, it joins with *shao yang* Minister Fire to prevail together, unlike the benevolence of Sovereign Fire. When Fire is too abundant, all things wither and scorch; metal melts and stones liquefy; waves boil; insects perish; and the people suffer from panting and coughing.

4. *Wu-shen*: The Fire *yun* is excessive. Above, it joins with *shao yang* Minister Fire to prevail together. When the overcoming reaches its extreme, Metal loses its proper state and falls into distress, ultimately without Water to restore balance—this exemplifies self-overcoming. At its zenith, all things wither and scorch, and Venus diminishes.

5. *Bing-xu*: The Water *yun* is excessive. Above, it encounters *tai yang* Cold Water as the *si tian*. The heavenly and earthly *qi* converge. Thus, summer turns cold, and winter becomes biting. Cold mists arise repeatedly; yang light fails to govern. When extreme, Earth does not restore balance—this exemplifies overcoming. Mars loses its color, and feathered creatures perish.

6. *Bing-chen*: The Water *yun* is excessive. Above, it joins with *tai yang* Cold Water in command. The two *qi* unite in virtue, and guest *qi* assists. Hail arrives suddenly; cold winds assail; earthly *qi* chills; heavenly *qi* congeals; human *qi* contracts. The biting cold intensifies; Earth does not restore balance. Red *qi* and crimson clouds vanish entirely.

**Four Methods of the Supreme Heavenly Correspondence *Yun***

This is the triple convergence of heaven, earth, and *yun*.

1. *Wu-wu*: Above, *shao yin* Sovereign Fire governs as *si tian*; in the center, the Fire *yun* is excessive. The year *wu* belongs to the south, the position of *li* Fire—hence the name "Supreme Heavenly Correspondence" of the triple convergence. The reckoning adds sixteen: *wu* is *li*, its number nine; the excessive Fire *yun* is seven. Seven and nine together make sixteen. At the *yun* transition, facing *wu*, one sees radiant red *qi*. The heavens bear red *qi* in accord—this *yun* must give birth to noble persons.

2. *Yi-you*: Above, *yang ming* Metal governs as *si tian*; in the center, the Metal *yun* is insufficient. The heavenly correspondence is balanced. *You* belongs to the west, *dui*, corresponding to Metal—hence the name "triple convergence." The reckoning marks the year as seven; the *yun* adds seven. At the *yun* transition, facing *chen*, white *qi* extends from *yi* to *you*. The heavens bear white *qi* in accord. Those born in this *yun* are destined to become renowned generals.

3. *Ji-wei*: Above, *tai yin* Earth governs as *si tian*; in the center, the Earth *yun* is insufficient. The heavenly correspondence is balanced. *Wei* is *kun* Earth; the reckoning adds five. At the *yun* transition, from oneself to *wei*, radiant yellow *qi* appears. The heavens bear yellow *qi* in accord—this *yun* gives birth to future chancellors.

4. *Ji-chou*: Above, *tai yin* Earth governs as *si tian*; in the center, the Earth *yun* is insufficient. The heavenly correspondence is balanced. *Chou* is the central palace of Earth—hence the name "triple convergence." The reckoning adds five. At the *yun* transition, from oneself to *chou*, radiant yellow *qi* appears. The heavens bear yellow *qi* in accord—this *yun* gives birth to prime ministers.

These four Supreme Heavenly Correspondences govern the birth of noble persons.

**Four Methods of the Same Heavenly Correspondence**

When *shao yin* governs as *si tian* in *zi* and *wu*, the *wu* year is the same heavenly correspondence—first;

When *Yangming* governs as *si tian* in *mao* and *you*, the *you* year is the same heavenly correspondence—second. When *Taiyin* governs as *si tian* in *chou* and *wei*, both *chou* and *wei* are the same heavenly correspondence—fourth. The observation of *yun-qi* follows the method: the four-year convergence in the preceding balanced *qi* has already clarified this correspondence.

**Twelve Methods of the Same Yearly Convergence**

1. *Geng-zi* Metal *yun*: Below, *Yangming* Metal is *zai quan*; the earth emits white *qi* to assist the Metal *yun*’s triumph.
2. *Geng-wu* Metal *yun*: Below, *Yangming* Metal is *zai quan*; the earth emits white *qi* to assist the Metal *yun*’s triumph.
3. *Gui-chou* Water *yun*: Below, *Taiyang* Water is *zai quan*; the earth releases black *qi* to assist the Water *yun*’s triumph.
4. *Gui-wei* Water *yun*: Below, *Taiyang* Water is *zai quan*; the earth releases black *qi* to assist the Water *yun*’s triumph.
5. *Ren-yin* Wood *yun*: Below, *Jueyin* Wood is *zai quan*; the earth emits verdant mist to assist the Wood *yun*’s triumph.
6. *Ren-shen* Wood *yun*: Below, *Jueyin* Wood is *zai quan*; the earth emits verdant mist to assist the Wood *yun*’s triumph.
7. *Gui-mao* Fire *yun*: Below, *Shaoyin* Sovereign Fire is *zai quan*; the earth emits red *qi* to assist the Fire *yun*’s triumph.
8. *Gui-you* Fire *yun*: Below, *Shaoyin* Sovereign Fire is *zai quan*; the earth emits red *qi* to assist the Fire *yun*’s triumph.
9. *Jia-chen* Earth *yun*: Below, *Taiyin* Earth is *zai quan*; the earth emits yellow mist to assist the Earth *yun*’s triumph.
10. *Jia-xu* Earth *yun*: Below, *Taiyin* Earth is *zai quan*; the earth emits yellow mist to assist the Earth *yun*’s triumph.
11. *Gui-si* Fire *yun*: Below, *Shaoyang* Ministerial Fire is *zai quan*; the earth steams red *qi*, illuminating the outskirts at night to assist the Fire *yun*’s triumph.
12. *Gui-hai* Fire *yun*: Below, *Shaoyang* Ministerial Fire is *zai quan*; the earth steams red *qi*, lighting the wilds at night, with fires visible beyond the suburbs to assist the Fire *yun*’s triumph.

**Five Methods of Heavenly Depression**

1. In a Wood *yun* year, if Metal governs as *si tian* above, the heavenly constraint overpowers the *yun*, which fails to prevail. In the following yin year, after *si tian* retreats but before the Wood *yun* transitions, the suppressed Wood *qi* transforms into verdant *qi*, bringing calamity to the world and causing sudden deaths among the people.
2. In a Fire *yun* year, if Water governs as *si tian* above, the heavenly constraint overpowers the *yun*, which fails to prevail. In the following yin year, with the *yun-qi* transition delayed and *si tian* already retreated, the suppressed Fire *qi* bursts forth, afflicting the world and the people with restlessness, fright, red urine, sores, ulcers, and rashes.
3. In an Earth *yun* year, if *Jueyin* Wood governs as *si tian* above, the heavenly constraint overpowers the *yun*, which fails to prevail. In the following yin year, after *si tian* retreats but before the *yun-qi* transitions, the suppressed Earth *qi* scatters, causing the people to suffer from swelling, jaundice, abdominal distension, edema, diarrhea, and limb weakness.
4. In a Metal *yun* year, if Sovereign or Ministerial Fire governs as *si tian* above, the heavenly constraint overpowers the *yun*, which fails to prevail. In the following yin year, after *si tian* retreats but before the *yun-qi* transitions, the suppressed Metal *qi* disperses, afflicting the people with limb fullness, blockage, distension, muscle spasms, strangury, urinary difficulty, dryness in the upper burner, blurred vision, irritability, pallor, sorrow, and melancholy.
5. In a Water *yun* year, if *Taiyin* Earth governs as *si tian* above, the heavenly constraint overpowers the *yun*, which fails to prevail. After *si tian* retreats but before the *yun-qi* transitions, the suppressed Water *qi* scatters, causing the people to suffer from atrophy, cold limbs, impotence, incontinence, limb blockage, joint pain, and lower abdominal fullness.

**Five Methods of Heavenly Destruction**

1. If the Wood *yun* is excessive, arriving early with surplus *qi*, and *Yangming* Metal governs as *si tian* above without having retreated, the heavenly Metal constrains it. Wood does not submit, transforming into thunderous sounds—this is called *Heavenly Destruction*. The people suffer from convulsions and spasms; plants flourish prematurely, but frost returns to kill them, causing restlessness, blockage, thirst, and delirium.
2. If the Fire *yun* is excessive, arriving early with surplus *qi*, and *Taiyang* Water governs as *si tian* above without having retreated, the heavenly Water constrains it. Fire does not submit, transforming into scorching heat, while hail falls—this is called *Heavenly Destruction*. The people suffer sudden deaths, alternating chills and fever, abdominal fullness, dry throat, and esophageal obstruction.
3. If the Earth *yun* is excessive, arriving early with surplus *qi*, and *Jueyin* Wood governs as *si tian* above without having retreated, the heavenly Wood constrains it. Earth does not submit, transforming into dense fog and dust, followed by gentle rain and then violent winds—this is called *Heavenly Destruction*. The people suffer from limb swelling, dampness, jaundice, edema, and loss of appetite.
4. If the Metal *yun* is excessive, arriving early with surplus *qi*, and Sovereign or Ministerial Fire governs as *si tian* above, the heavenly constraint prevails. Metal does not submit, transforming into rustling winds, tiger roars, and ape cries—this is called *Heavenly Destruction*. The people suffer from restlessness, tooth decay, throat dryness, thirst, brittle hair, wheezing, and coughing.
5. If the Water *yun* is excessive, arriving early with surplus *qi*, and *Taiyin* Earth governs as *si tian* above without having retreated, the heavenly constraint prevails. Water does not submit, transforming into sleet and unrelenting gloom—this is called *Heavenly Destruction*. The people suffer from bone atrophy, leg soreness, impotence, incontinence, limb blockage, joint pain, and lower abdominal fullness.

**Chapter on Disasters, Omens, and Cyclical Patterns**

**Era of Great Peace**
In years when the Five *Yun* are excessive, observe as before: if, beside the *yun*’s proper position, five-colored hues like rainbows appear, flanked by "ears," and if solar "ears" also manifest, persisting long after the *yun* has passed without dissipating, a single sighting heralds thirty years of Great Peace.

**Era of Ascending Peace**
The Era of Ascending Peace corresponds to the *yun* of the imperial house attaining kingship—fire for fire, water for water. In years of excessive *yun*, hues beside the *yun*’s proper position resemble rainbows, lingering without fading. Their appearance brings prosperity, joyful livelihoods, flourishing imperial governance, and an aura slightly lesser than the Era of Great Peace.

**Era of Heavenly Warfare**
The Era of Heavenly Warfare arises within the Five *Yun*, regardless of excess or deficiency. After the *yun* passes, a white *qi* like silk appears, followed by clouds clinging to it—these clouds, too, are white, resembling wolves or tigers. Their sighting foretells major warfare the following year.

**Era of Heavenly Aridity**
The Era of Heavenly Aridity occurs in years of excessive Metal *yun*, or when Wood is deficient and Metal prevails, or when the Metal *yun* aligns with a Heavenly Correspondence, invariably in years dominated by dry Metal transformations. It may also appear in years when Earth fails to restrain. After the *yun* passes, white *qi* scatters into red, intermingling as red and white. Its sighting portends severe drought.

**Era of Heavenly Moisture**
The Era of Heavenly Moisture often appears in years of excessive Earth *yun*, or when Water is deficient and Earth prevails, or in years when Earth aligns with a Heavenly Correspondence. In years of excessive Earth, yellow *qi* manifests; in years when Earth overcomes Water, yellow and black *qi* intermingle. If the *qi* appears as fine, greenish-black strands like horsehair, its sighting signals flooding disasters.

**Era of Usurpation**
The Era of Usurpation is determined by the *yun* of the imperial house attaining kingship. After the *yun* passes, a distinct white *qi* encroaches upon it. Within this white *qi*, small red specks like sparks appear, followed by clouds resembling snakes or insects. This foretells rebellion against the sovereign.

**Era of the Illustrious Sovereign**
The Era of the Illustrious Sovereign appears in years when the imperial house’s *yun* is excessive. The *yun* is vast and luminous, accompanied by purple *qi*. Alternatively, it may resemble a purple canopy, a purple figure, or a five-colored dragon. Its sighting heralds the flourishing of imperial governance.

**Era of the Sage**
The Sage is born of Heaven and Earth, emerging once every thousand years. In years of Grand Heavenly Correspondence, Heavenly Correspondence, or when the *yun* aligns with Heaven, a red *qi* illuminates the sky, and celestial brilliance suffuses the mountains and valleys. From the caves and grottoes of these peaks, a Sage is born.

**Era of the Worthy**
The Worthy appears once every five hundred years, not born of Heaven and Earth. In years of Heavenly Correspondence or when the *yun*’s governance is harmonious, after the *yun*’s *qi* passes, white *qi* surges upward in specific regions, towering and resplendent. Where this *qi* descends, many Worthies are born.

**Era of Heavenly Locusts**
In years when the *yun* clash without harmony, regardless of excess or deficiency, yellow masses appear within the *yun* and do not disperse. If locusts appear but the masses remain intact, no disaster occurs. If the masses scatter like fragmented stars, the infestation will be severe, affecting the regions where they disperse.

**Era of Famine**
In years when the Five *Yun* clash and overcome one another, after the *yun* passes, clouds—yellow, black, or obscuring the *yun*—appear, resembling ghosts, geese, ducks, or overturned boats. Their sighting foretells crop failure.

**Era of Heavenly Pestilence**
Heavenly Pestilence may arise in any *yun*, its *qi* arriving even when the *yun* is unseen. Minor disasters manifest as epidemics with yellow *qi*. Major disasters occur when the yellow *qi* is encircled by halos of purple and red, varying in size, scattering like tiny lightning bolts or writhing earthworms. The intermingling of purple, red, and yellow *qi* within the yellow portends mass death.

**Era of Bountiful Harvests**
The Era of Bountiful Harvests occurs in years of deficient *yun* where the *qi* is faint yet unexpectedly profound, or when the overcoming *qi* does not merge. In years of excessive *yun*, all five colors intermingle with yellow *qi*. After the *qi* passes, clouds resembling people, phoenixes, or cranes appear, heralding abundant harvests.

**Era of Auspicious Omens**
The Era of Auspicious Omens may appear in years of excessive or deficient *yun*. Beyond the *yun*’s proper position, hues of purple or red manifest, resembling lingzhi mushrooms or mountains with trees. Their sighting brings Great Peace, national prosperity, and a content, abundant populace.

**Era of True Correspondence**
The Era of True Correspondence heralds the emergence of a sagely and enlightened sovereign, answering to the future Son of Heaven. It appears within excessive *yun*, its five colors unfixed—wood responding to wood, fire to fire. The *qi* is vast, flanked by subsidiary hues of the same color, accompanied by several smaller *qi* streams. Each stream represents an emperor, while the smaller *qi* signify descendants.

**The Southern Regulator’s Twelve Celestial Governances**

When the Southern Regulator governs Heaven, it proceeds from the *gan* in sequence to the *zhi*, then applies the *zhi*’s numerical value to the generative and consummate numbers.

1. **Jiazi Year (Earth Phase)**
   The Southern Regulator governs Heaven. The celestial face turns north, with the left aligned to the west and the right to the east. Above, the *zheng* tone presides. The sovereign fire resides in Heaven, and celestial *qi* revolves in harmony.
   From *jia* to *zi*, it advances eleven positions. *Zi* corresponds to *kan*, its number one; fire’s consummate number is seven. At the celestial hour, it arrives precisely eight *ke* before the celestial count.
   Eleven days later, fire begins its governance of Heaven, initiating the celestial mandate. Five days into its rule, *Tai Gong* arrives in harmony. Crimson *qi* ascends, heat prevails in Heaven, azure mists appear at dusk, and yellow clouds arise at dawn—these are the attendant hues following the Regulator’s color.

2. **Jiawu Year (Earth Phase)**
   The Southern Regulator governs Heaven. The celestial face turns north, with the left aligned to the west and the right to the east. Above, *Tai Zheng* presides. The sovereign fire resides in Heaven, and celestial *qi* revolves in harmony.
   From *jia* to *wu*, it advances five positions. *Wu* corresponds to *li*, its number nine; fire’s generative number is two. Nine and two combine to make eleven.
   At the celestial hour, it arrives eleven *ke* before the celestial count. Five days later, fire begins its governance of Heaven, initiating the celestial mandate. Five days into its rule, *Tai Gong* and *Tai Zheng* rise in harmony. Crimson *qi* appears above, azure mists manifest at dusk, and yellow *qi* emerges at dawn—this is the celestial Dao in harmonious accord, an auspicious sign.

3. **Jichou Year (Earth Phase)**
   The Southern Regulator governs Heaven. The celestial face turns north, with the left aligned to the west and the right to the east. Above, the *zheng gong* tone presides. Grand Yin earth resides in Heaven, and celestial *qi* revolves in harmony.
   From *ji* to *chou*, it shifts seven positions to the left. *Chou* corresponds to earth, its number five; earth’s consummate number is also five. Two fives combine to make ten.
   At the celestial hour, it arrives ten *ke* after the celestial count. Seven days later, earth begins its governance of Heaven. *Shao Gong* harmonizes with the *zheng gong* above, initiating the transformation of the celestial mandate. Yellow *qi* ascends, dampness prevails in Heaven, and crimson *qi* with red clouds frequently appear at dawn and dusk—these are the proper hues of the left and right attendants.

4. **Jiwei Year (Earth Phase)**
   The Southern Regulator governs Heaven. The celestial face turns north, with the left aligned to the west and the right to the east. Above, the *zheng gong* tone presides. Grand Yin earth governs Heaven, and celestial *qi* revolves in harmony.
   *Ji* originally resides in *wei*, requiring no leftward shift. *Wei* corresponds to earth, its number five; the phase earth’s number is also five. Two fives combine to make ten.
   At the celestial hour, it arrives ten *ke* after the celestial count. On that day, earth governs Heaven and immediately enacts the celestial mandate. Eighteen days into its rule, *Shao Gong* converges with *Zheng Gong*. Yellow *qi* ascends, dampness prevails in Heaven, and crimson *qi* aligns with the celestial mandate at dawn and dusk.

5. **Jiaxu Year (Earth Phase)**
   The Southern Regulator governs Heaven. The celestial face turns north, with the left aligned to the west and the right to the east. Above, *Tai Yu* presides. Grand Yang cold water governs Heaven, and celestial *qi* revolves in harmony.
   From *jia* to *xu*, it shifts nine positions to the left. *Xu* corresponds to earth, its number five; the phase earth’s number is also five. Two fives combine to make ten.
   At the celestial hour, it arrives ten *ke* before the celestial count. Nine days later, water begins its governance of Heaven. *Tai Gong* imposes punishment on *Tai Yu*, but *Yu* remains unharmed, and the *qi* does not harmonize. Black *qi* ascends, cold prevails in Heaven, yellow *qi* appears at dawn, and yellow mists arise at dusk, eventually turning violet before shifting to black—this is the sign of harmonious transformation.

**Twelve Methods of Heavenly *Qi* Failing to Aid**

Whenever Heavenly *qi* fails to aid, it is because Heaven is deficient and intermediary *qi* arrives, or the phase’s *qi* is deficient and its conqueror arrives. Thus, Heavenly *qi* and the phase’s *qi* do not harmonize, each instead encountering its conqueror, leading to failure.

Each conqueror must seize its proper seasonal mandate to achieve mutual aid. From the three positions of *mao*, *si*, and *chou*—yin years of opposing transformations—twelve years are selected. Each position spans five years, from which three years of Heavenly *qi* aligning with virtue are chosen, yielding twelve years in total.

Excluded are:
- *Ding-si* phase, which aligns with Heaven as wood;
- *Ji-chou* phase, which aligns with Heaven as earth;
- *Yi-mao* phase, which aligns with Heaven as metal.

1. *Yi-si*: Heaven in opposing transformation, with left and right intermediary *qi* arriving from Heaven’s intervals. The phase’s metal is insufficient, and fire arrives to conquer. The phase is overcome by fire, and Heaven is invaded by intermediary *qi*—thus Heavenly *qi* cannot provide mutual aid.

2. *Ji-si*: Heaven in opposing transformation, with intermediary *qi* arriving. The phase’s earth is insufficient, and wood arrives to conquer. The phase is punished by wood, and Heaven is invaded by intermediary *qi*—thus they do not aid one another.

Orthodox transformation refers to the celestial mandate in its proper phase, its decree upright, free from perverse transformations, for the *qi* of Heaven is full.

1. *Yi-hai*: *Jueyin* governs Heaven in orthodox transformation. Wood’s root phase is *mao*, yet *mao* is opposed by the counter-phase of *yangming* metal. Wood is born in *hai*, hence the orthodox transformation. Orthodox transformation returns to its root, following the generative number three. After seventeen days of governing Heaven, the phase clashes above, and in the next three days, it descends to overlook; earth is subdued, hibernating creatures perish, and the spleen repository ails. Five days later, yellow *qi* ascends, the upper *qi* slightly depleted, borne by the phase’s power. The mandate of wind transformation prevails, and though orthodox, metal’s phase slightly overcomes it, thus Heaven’s mandate is but a minor victory of wind.

**Disasters, Stagnation, Reversal, and Harmony: The Five Methods of Earthly Stagnation in the Subterranean Springs**

1. *Jueyin* wood resides in the subterranean springs; *si* and *hai* are directly opposed, following the same principle. If metal phase appears above, the metal phase conquers below, wood *qi* does not arise, and green mist lingers as wood *qi* remains long concealed within the earth.

In the following year, when the water phase prevails, the wood *qi* remains concealed, and its pent-up fury erupts from the earth, bringing disaster to the people. The afflictions strike suddenly: loss of speech, paralysis, atrophy of the sinews, emaciation, and cold limbs. The green mist and dampness recede, sweet and yellow *qi* fail to transform, great winds arise repeatedly, the heavens grow dim with dust, and clouds and rain cease.

2. When both sovereign and ministerial fire reside in the subterranean springs, *zi* and *wu*, *yin* and *shen* stand in direct opposition, following the same principle. If the water phase appears above, the water phase conquers below, and the fiery *qi* of the earth—red *qi*—remains concealed, unable to emerge, lying hidden deep within the earth for years. In the following year, when the wood phase arrives, the fire *qi* remains suppressed, and its pent-up fury begins to break forth, bringing disaster to the people. This manifests as madness, convulsions, sighing, depression, restlessness, and oppressive heat, with urine like blood. All things wither and dry, and mountains and rivers grow parched.

3. When *Taiyin* earth resides in the subterranean springs, *chou* and *wei* stand in direct opposition, following the same principle of transformation. If the wood phase appears above, the wood phase conquers below, and the earth *qi* remains concealed within the earth, its yellow *qi*—its true color—unable to emerge for a long time. In the following year, when the fire phase arrives, the earth *qi* remains suppressed, and its pent-up fury begins to vent. Once released, it brings pestilence to the people: jaundice, swelling, dampness, distension, abdominal fullness, swollen feet, diarrhea, and turbid stools. Mountains and marshes grow dim and obscured, all things lose their freshness, and rain falls in murky confusion.

4. When *Yangming* metal resides in the subterranean springs, *mao* and *you* stand in direct opposition, following the same principle of transformation. If the fire phase appears above, the fire phase conquers below, and the white *qi* does not appear, the fire *qi* lying concealed within the earth, unable to ascend. In the following year, when the earth phase arrives, the metal *qi* remains suppressed, and its pent-up fury at last breaks forth from the earth, bringing disaster to the people. The afflictions include wheezing, coughing, grief, chills and fever with shivering, coughing of blood, and withered hair. Grasses and trees wither, the killing force of autumn arises in spring, and the forests resound with eerie sounds.

5. When *Taiyang* water resides in the subterranean springs, *chen* and *xu* stand in direct opposition, following the same principle of transformation. If the earth phase appears above, the earth phase suppresses it, and the black *qi* remains long concealed, unable to manifest. In the following year, when the metal phase arrives, the water *qi* remains suppressed, and its pent-up fury begins to erupt from the earth, bringing disaster to the people. The afflictions include numbness, cold limbs, atrophy of the bones, chills in the channels, incontinence, and weakness in the waist and knees. All flowering plants wither, and the sunlight loses its brilliance.

**Treatise on Terrestrial Intervals and Material Records, Scroll One**
**Thirty-Six Methods of Interval Transformation in the Spring-Qi**

1. Beneath *jiazi*, *jimao* appears: Yangming resides in the spring-qi. Oppositional transformation bears intervals; when harmonious with the yearly qi, it is termed a "minor interval," which is to say, a single interval. If the terrestrial sequence follows an odd number, the left interval precedes, not the right; if it follows an even number, the right interval precedes, not the left. As for the intervals of the land: first, the flavors of beings are interrupted; thereafter, the commands of qi are interrupted. For example, when Yangming resides in the spring-qi: if the celestial north is upright, the terrestrial south is upright; if the celestial south is upright, the terrestrial north is upright. Thus, in upholding the celestial upright, the land manifests *jimao*; if the celestial south is upright, the left reveals Taiyang. Following an odd sequence, Taiyang’s interval comes first—first interrupting the generation of salty flavors and black vegetation, then interrupting the command of cold. Following an even sequence, the right interval comes first: Shaoyang’s right interval first interrupts bitter flavors and red blossoms, then proceeds to the command of heat. This single interval is here presented as an example; all others follow accordingly.

If the terrestrial sequence follows an odd number, the left interval precedes, not the right; if it follows an even number, the right interval precedes, not the left.

Next are the six minor intervals of yearly qi punishment:

1. Beneath *wuwu*, *guiyou* appears: *Wu* and *gui* govern the fire qi. The land reveals Yangming in its proper transformation in the spring-qi. Proper transformation originally bears no intervals; thus, when the fire qi is excessive, it overcomes the metal of the governing land below, resulting in a minor interval. If the terrestrial sequence follows an odd number, the left interval precedes, not the right; if it follows an even number, the right interval precedes, not the left.

2. Beneath *gengshen*, *yihai* appears: *Yi* and *geng* govern the metal qi. The land reveals Jueyin in its proper transformation in the spring-qi. Proper transformation originally bears no intervals; thus, when the metal qi is excessive, it punishes the wood of Jueyin below, and wood succumbs to metal’s conquest, resulting in a minor interval. If the terrestrial sequence follows an odd number, the left interval precedes, not the right; if it follows an even number, the right interval precedes, not the left.

3. Beneath *renchen*, *dingwei* appears: *Ding* and *ren* govern the wood qi. The land reveals Taiyin earth in the spring-qi. The land’s proper transformation originally bears no intervals; thus, when the wood qi is excessive, it overcomes the earth of the governing land below, resulting in a minor interval. If the terrestrial sequence follows an odd number, the left interval precedes, not the right; if it follows an even number, the right interval precedes, not the left.

4. Beneath *xinhai*, *bingyin* appears: *Bing* and *xin* govern the water qi. The land reveals Shaoyang ministerial fire in the spring-qi. The land’s proper transformation originally bears no intervals; thus, when the yearly water qi overcomes the fire of the governing land below, it results in a minor interval. If the terrestrial sequence follows an odd number, the left interval precedes, not the right; if it follows an even number, the right interval precedes, not the left.

5. Beneath *xinmao*, *bingwu* appears: *Bing* and *xin* govern the water qi. The land reveals Shaoyin sovereign fire in the spring-qi. The land’s proper transformation originally bears no intervals; thus, in a year governed by the water qi, it overcomes the fire of the governing land below, resulting in a minor interval.

When the terrestrial sequence follows an odd number, the left interval precedes, not the right; if it follows an even number, the right interval precedes, not the left.

6. Beneath *jiwei*, *jiaxu* appears: *Jia* and *ji* govern the earth qi. The land reveals Taiyang cold-water in the spring-qi. The land’s proper transformation originally bears no intervals; thus, in a year governed by the earth qi, it overcomes the water of the governing land below, resulting in a minor interval. When the terrestrial sequence follows an odd number, the left interval precedes, not the right; if it follows an even number, the right interval precedes, not the left.

**Ten Principles of Earth Intervals in the Spring-Qi**

1. When Shaoyin resides in the spring-qi and encounters its proper transformation, yet no wood qi governs the center, neither left nor right intervals arise to disrupt the transformation. Shaoyin alone conducts its bitter transformation, and thus bitter substances grow increasingly lush. As fire moves through the land, it attains its qi, and since fire generates earth, earth becomes the interval. Sweet substances thus proliferate, and yellow blossoms flourish. Because wood does not arrive to create an interval, earth itself becomes the interval.

2. When Yangming governs the land in the spring-qi and its proper transformation proceeds without intervals—neither above nor below, left nor right, does fire interfere with the central qi, nor do they mutually restrain or overcome—then the land’s metal transforms of itself. White substances grow abundant, and pungent flavors intensify. Thus, the qi of the governing land is exceedingly fine, and earth arrives to create an interval. Sweet substances’ flavors also lengthen, and yellow substances deepen in hue. This occurs as earth qi encroaches upon the mandate of metal.

3. When Shaoyang ministerial fire governs the land in the spring-qi and its proper transformation proceeds without intervals, and when no water qi governs the year, the land attains its own mandate. Bitter flavors thus abound, red blossoms grow vivid, and cinnabar valleys bear fruit. During the time of its proper flourishing, earth arrives to create an interval. Sweet substances vie in lushness, and yellow blossoms compete in growth. This arises as earth rides the beauty of fire to arrive.

4. When Taiyang cold-water governs the land in its proper transformation, with no intervals on left or right, and no earth qi governs the year, the land attains its own mandate. Salty substances’ flavors thus lengthen, and the qi of transformation becomes singular in its command. When its proper mandate is in effect, sweet earth arrives to create an interval. Though it creates an interval, it does not restrain; rather, water remains self-contained. Sweet transformation and sweet-flavored substances form a distinct transformation, self-styled as the earth interval.

5. When Shaoyin conducts a counter-transformation in the spring-qi, the land’s qi becomes depleted. During the time when interval substances have yet to transform, or when interval qi arrives exceedingly late, the transformation of sweet earth arises anew, competing in flavor with the interval substances. Sweetness emerges to supplement the decline of bitterness, and thus within bitterness, sweetness is reborn.

6. When Yangming conducts a counter-transformation in the land, the land’s qi becomes depleted. Pungent substances’ flavors grow thin, and interval transformation arrives late, failing to produce its interval flavor. Sweet earth arrives to nourish the deficiency of metal, and within pungent substances, sweetness may intermingle. This is the interval transformation of sweet earth aiding metal’s flavor.

7. When Shaoyang ministerial fire conducts a counter-transformation in the land, the land possesses an interval transformation. If flavors are not singular, and interval substances seek to arise, earth qi acts first. If within flavors sweetness emerges internally, it prevents saltiness from arising. The nature of this interval sweet earth is swift in transformation and abundant in arrival to meet the interval.

8. When Taiyang conducts a counter-transformation in the spring-qi, the land’s qi becomes depleted. Salty substances’ flavors grow thin, while sweet substances dominate. Thus, within salty substances, a reversal occurs, and sweetness may supplement their saltiness, lengthening their flavor. This is the establishment of sweetness overcoming and returning flavor through restraint.

9. When Taiyin conducts a counter-transformation in the land, the land’s qi becomes depleted and receives intervals from others. If wood arrives to restrain sweetness, sweet flavors ought to decline. Sweet substances, yellow blossoms, and aged grains all grow thin in qi. Their sweet flavors also fear wood and decline, corresponding to the year’s depletion and diminution. Yet the flavor shifts into salty substances, and their flavors ought not to diminish.

10. When Taiyin governs its proper transformation in the spring-qi, and neither left nor right intervals arrive, nor does wood qi govern the year, sweetness rules with singular authority. Thus, within all flavors, sweetness intermingles, distinct from other flavors. Within the spring-qi, only earth intervals abound, for the land’s earth is aided by the great earth.

**Record of the Correspondences of the Five Phases**

Grasses and trees, wind, Jupiter, furred creatures, thunder and lightning—all correspond to wood. These pertain to the eastern category, governed by Jueyin, presiding over the four seasons as spring, transforming in the initial qi. In the Eight Trigrams, it is Zhen; in the Nine Palaces, it is the Third Palace; its celestial image is Jupiter. The celestial transformation issues as wind, as harmony and warmth. The transformation of creatures produces furred beings, with the *shizi* and qilin as their chiefs. The earth’s production yields sour flavor and blue-green color. The earth’s transformations, celestial stellar images, and wind’s seasonal correspondences—auspicious signs respond to timely omens, inauspicious signs to baleful portents, and propitious signs to felicitous auguries. These eastern categories all correspond to their wood.

When the wind-wood spring mandate brings warmth and harmony, wind spreads and engenders life. The great void is veiled in dust, and mighty winds uproot and shatter. From afar, the qi appears as a blue-green haze; the four qi radiate azure mist and luminous hues. Fragrant blossoms flourish, their transformations sour, their growth lush and exuberant, grasses and trees burgeoning in glory.

When the celestial correct mandate exceeds its measure, wind rules alone, and rain’s nourishment is deficient. Earth then follows its mandate, and wood qi does not punish. If earth does not comply but instead transforms into rain, the rain is suppressed by great winds, and thus rain and wind contend for dominance.

If the mandate aligns with celestial virtue, Jupiter shines brightly, blue-green mists frequently manifest, and azure qi is seen from afar. Furred creatures transform, rare beasts appear as auspicious omens, the earth yields lingzhi, forests grow wondrous trees, and the wilds bear famed herbs—all harmonizing with wood’s virtue.

In the eastern correctness, spring holds no killing mandate. Harmonious qi unfolds repeatedly, flowers and plants bloom charmingly, thunder arises in mid-spring, lightning strikes in season, and rainbows appear in timely response. Following this brings myriad transformations to flourishing glory; opposing it brings calamity and disaster.

When the celestial stems are jia or yi, and the trigrams are Zhen or Xun, if Jupiter deviates from its course, the year brings great famine, and the people suffer many illnesses. If Jupiter appears small, the people face disaster; if it appears large, the ruler is sagely and the state is secure, the people enjoy fortune, and blessings converge.

When Jupiter is lustrous and bright, its body white and tranquil, moving along the central path, its nature is upright. If it moves correctly, the ruler’s heart is upright; if it moves perversely, the ruler’s heart is perverse. If it moves leisurely, it brings double fortune; if it is too slow or swift, losing its position, all is in vain.

A blue-green hue brings peace to the people; yellow brings abundant harvests; black brings great lamentation; red with agitation heralds the rise of armies. If it is large with rays and horns, the ruler is blessed with sons. If it is white and small, the state has a powerful minister deserving execution. If it is blue-green and black, suddenly large then small, encircled by a red halo, a great black wind arrives.

When Jupiter’s movement is regular in its retrogression and progression, it surely brings fortune; if it loses regularity, it surely brings disaster. If Jupiter skips a station and advances, this is called "excess," and there will be war, with princes and lords unsettled. If it retreats from a station, this is called "deficiency," and generals will die and armies be defeated.

When Jupiter is eclipsed by the moon, the state will know much weeping, or a great minister or empress will pass. When it conjoins with Mars, treacherous ministers will be executed. When it approaches or conjoins with Venus, great battles will ensue.

Moreover, when metal and wood stars conjoin, if metal is south of wood, the southern lands will suffer military defeat; if metal is north of wood, the northern lands will suffer defeat—this applies likewise to east and west.

If Jupiter lacks light and moves erratically, the state has lost governance and faces sorrow. If it retrogrades and encroaches upon a state, or lingers and encircles it, the ruler is without the Dao.

Jia and yi are the virtues of wood; wind and thunder are the mandates of wood. Spring winds sigh softly, summer winds flutter and soar, autumn winds are desolate and rustling, and winter winds are whistling and biting—these are the regular patterns of the four seasons. Following them brings peace to all transformations; opposing them brings illness to all people.

If spring winds flutter and soar, the world suffers pestilence; if spring winds are desolate and rustling, the world knows plunder and conflict; if spring winds are whistling and biting, there is famine and loss of livelihood—these are failures of spring wind governance.

If summer winds sigh softly, the state’s governance is unstable; if summer winds are whistling and biting, many people die violently; if summer winds are desolate and rustling, great armies will mobilize—these are failures of summer wind governance.

If autumn winds sigh softly, the coming year will not be bountiful; if autumn winds flutter and soar, the people suffer from madness and illness; if autumn winds are whistling and biting, the state harbors treacherous ministers—these are failures of autumn wind governance.

If winter winds sigh softly, pestilence arises in winter; if winter winds flutter and soar, drought and floods are uneven; if winter winds are desolate and rustling, the five grains will not ripen—these are failures of winter wind governance.

Thunder is the intent and qi of wood. The thunder trigram Zhen corresponds to the eastern mao position. Lightning precedes thunder. If thunder first resounds in the east, the five grains will be abundant. If it first resounds in the south, there will be minor drought. If it first resounds in the west, corpses will lie exposed, and cattle and horses will die of pestilence. If it first resounds in the north, all rivers will overflow.

Winter thunder in the upper reaches is an omen of a fallen state. Where thunder strikes, corpses lie exposed in the wilds. When thunder and lightning are divined together, on the *baku* days there will be illness.

Thunder portends great battles; when great winds arise, the state issues urgent decrees. The *baku* days are: in spring, *jisi* and *dingchou*; in summer, *jiazi* and *renxu*; in autumn, *jihai* and *dingwei*; in winter, *jiawu* and *renchen*.

If on a *wuzi* day in winter there is no rain but lightning strikes, and lightning flashes without thunder, it portends war and chaos in the world. If thunder rumbles without clouds, great disaster befalls the people.

If thunder and lightning strike the imperial palace, ministers plot rebellion, and within five years, armies will clash and blood will flow. If they strike a ancestral temple, it is called "heaven’s warning," and the ruler acts without the Dao. A second strike foretells the state’s territory being diminished and seized within eight years.

If thunder and lightning strike the mansion of a noble, a flattering minister holds power, and within six years, the state’s land will be reduced. If they strike the carriages and cavalry of a noble’s retinue, the ruler is bewitched by women and neglects governance.

A single clap of thunder that ceases portends the ruler issuing severe decrees. If thunder crashes like a thunderbolt and dragons appear, a worthy scholar will emerge in the state. When thunder and rain are accompanied by gale-force winds that uproot trees and destroy houses, petty men occupy high positions while worthy scholars flee. If thunder and lightning strike with great slaughter, the ruler heeds slander and executes the loyal and good.

If thunder remains silent until summer, the ruler trembles without martial authority and retreats before powerful ministers. When thunder roars in late autumn, it is called the "heavenly hound’s cry," and the barbarians mobilize for war. If thunder sounds before spring, the people will suffer from pestilence.

Plants and trees are the earth’s manifestations. When lingzhi mushrooms or extraordinary trees grow in ancestral temples, it signifies the ruler’s devotion to sacrifices and the world’s great peace. If lingzhi or extraordinary trees grow in suburban altars, it portends abundant harvests and universal peace. When lingzhi grows in palace halls, the imperial house will flourish. Trees with interlocking branches are auspicious omens for the state. If extraordinary trees grow in the ruler’s palace, the state will receive blessings. When a tree dies and revives, the state will change its governance.

If mulberry trees wither in summer, the five grains will not ripen. When trees bleed upon being felled, the lord will face misfortune. If trees spontaneously grow on tombs, the state has lost its governance. When trees in the altars of soil and grain die, the ruler will lose territory. If a great tree in the suburban altars dies, it is the same omen.

If trees shed leaves out of season, it is as if they were felled by metal, and within two years, violent armies will invade from abroad. When trees uproot themselves, the state will descend into chaos. If trees bloom a second time, the ruler will face disaster. Frost in summer causes trees to wither and leaves to scatter seventy paces away, foretelling great warfare and people abandoning their homeland. If trees grow in summer but wither before ripening, the people will suffer calamity.

When bamboo and cypress wither in summer, the feudal lords will lose their positions. If trees "weep"—growing damp without rain—their bark turning red, it signals military defeat. Bamboo growing without nodes indicates the state has lost its governance. When bamboo sprouts two stalks from the same root, a powerful minister schemes for the throne. If bamboo leaves wither and suddenly revive, a powerful minister seizes control.

When withered trees revive in winter, it is called "yin and yang exchanging places," and the state will perish within two years. If trees bloom in winter, those who should live will die; winter blossoms foretell the outbreak of war. Except for plum blossoms, winter-sweet, and flowers that bloom in all four seasons, all other winter blooms are inauspicious. If trees bear fruit twice, the dead will return to life. When trees bear fruit in both spring and winter, the ruler will face misfortune. If they bear fruit again in autumn and winter, neighboring states will invade.

When jujube trees bear fruit twice, summer will bring hail. If plum trees bear fruit twice, spring will bring frost. When bamboo bears fruit twice, the people will suffer famine for three years. If trees suddenly cry out, their lord will die. When trees spontaneously grow in roadways, the ruler has lost the Dao. If trees grow atop houses, a sage will emerge in that land. When trees grow in unnatural forms, the people will be displaced.

If trees suddenly emit sounds like metal, the land will split apart. When trees sprout strange branches, the state will collapse. If plants and trees resemble human shapes, the state will face great peril. When grasses and trees wither on their own, the state will attain great peace.

When purslane grows abundantly, many will die of illness. If sweet flags proliferate, great floods will come. When *lian* grass spreads, famine will surely follow. If *hanhua* blooms in excess, there will be plunder and strife. When creatures resembling trees—such as those transforming into qilin, giving birth to Confucius, appearing as silkworms, or manifesting as *xieyu* or *bijiān* beasts—emerge, they are auspicious omens of a sagely king.

When white foxes arrive, governance will extend far. If a unicorn appears, the world will know great peace. When a white elephant arrives, the ruler will be overthrown in his domain. If a white deer appears, the ruler’s affairs will proceed swiftly. When a six-legged beast arrives, the state will be well-ordered without chaos. If a three-eyed beast appears, even commoners will be consulted in governance. When red bears emerge, power will rest with ministers.

If a dragon-horse arrives bearing tribute, the state will submit to its rule. When a patterned fox appears, benevolence will extend to widows and orphans. If a nine-tailed fox appears, the kingly Way will flourish. When a tiger has two mouths, a new lord will rise, and great ministers will rebel and harm him. If tigers devour one another, there will be great famine within three years.

When tigers and wolves enter the state, commanderies and cities will face misfortune. If wolves chase people, barbarians will invade and slaughter the land. When wild beasts and crows gather in the state, cities will face warfare. If wild beasts enter water without cause, the state will perish. When beasts howl in groups within cities, the cities will be emptied. If wild beasts hang themselves in the marketplace, the region will suffer great floods.

When wild beasts—large or small—enter cities, capital districts, or roads in great numbers, great harm will befall the land. If wild beasts give birth to offspring resembling humans, the era will change rulers. If they bear young resembling livestock, cities will be emptied. If wild beasts give birth to chaotic offspring, the ruler’s state will perish. If they bear winged young like birds, the world will face warfare.

When wild beasts give birth to offspring without ears or noses, cities will face rebellion. If they bear young without eyes, cities will face misfortune. If they bear serpent-like offspring, cities will suffer fires. If wild beasts give birth to many-legged young, cities will face civilian disasters. If they bear tailless offspring, the ruler will have no heir. The same applies to domestic animals.

If wild beasts give birth within city walls, the region will suffer drought and great disaster. When wolves and deer cry out ominously in cities, the people will die that year. If foxes enter homes and rooftops in great numbers, there will be sudden deaths, and the ruler will perish through licentiousness. When wild beasts carry withered wood into city streets, the ruler’s state will collapse.

If livestock suddenly speak, their words will foretell good or ill. When moles emerge, evil people will rise. If foxes howl in courtyards, misfortune will surely follow. When gibbons enter cities, water disasters will strike. If otters enter cities, great floods will come. When white hares arrive on their own, it is an auspicious omen for the king.

If hares climb city walls, cities will be emptied. If hares enter palaces without cause and give birth, the state will face misfortune. When hares traverse the royal palace, the ruler will perish. If purple hares appear, there will be abundant harvests. A three-legged hare foretells a great plague across the land.

If oxen and horses suddenly change in appearance, the ruler will face misfortune. When a household’s horse changes color, its master will face misfortune. If a cow gives birth to a horse, the ruler will fail to preserve the ancestral temples.

If oxen or horses suddenly speak, the good or ill they foretell will come to pass. If a cow gives birth to a calf with a southern-facing head, it foretells the division of military lands. If a cow is born with six legs and upper teeth, the ruler of the age will become a bandit. If a cow gives birth to a calf with a head and tail resembling a fish, great warfare will arise. If a cow gives birth to a calf with a human face and animal body, the people of the land will suffer illness. If a cow mates with a horse, the age will fall into chaos.

If a horse suddenly grows horns, the state will perish, or the Son of Heaven will personally lead a campaign against the barbarians. If a horse’s tail transforms to resemble that of an ox, it is called "changing garments," and petty men will govern major affairs. If a horse is born with four ears, the state will be divided into four. If a horse gives birth to a lamb, the people will be at peace—this also applies to cows.

If a sheep has four eyes, it is called "dual radiance," and the land will be torn by fourfold strife. If a dog gives birth to a piglet, the times will be greatly peaceful. If a pig gives birth to a puppy, the times will be unstable. If dogs and pigs mate, the consorts and concubines of feudal lords will plot harm. If a dog’s fur suddenly changes color—if a black dog turns white or a white dog turns black—the master of the household will face punishment. If dogs or pigs emerge from the earth, commanderies and cities will suffer great disasters. If large gatherings of dogs and pigs occur in the streets, a major rebellion will soon arise.

If a dog wails mournfully at a person, there will be a great funeral. If dogs lead one another into water or onto rooftops, there will be a great funeral. If a dog suddenly plays near a well, there will be a terrifying event. If a dog urinates or defecates in a well, ancestral hall, or on bedding, it foretells great fame. If a dog eats its own offspring, there will be imprisonment. If a dog suddenly dies, it is a sign of great misfortune. If a dog gives birth to headless pups, the household will face great misfortune. If a dog is born without hind legs, it is an omen of misfortune for the household.

If a rat gives birth three times in a single day, it foretells famine. If rats build nests in trees, there will be a great flood. If rats gather in the marketplace and wail loudly, the feudal lords will rebel. If rats dance in the central courtyard or on the roads, the household will be ruined. If one hears rat sounds underground, the household will be ruined. If rats eat their own young, the city will be emptied. If rats carry their young away and do not return, there will be a fire. If rats move their young to new burrows, heavy rain will come. If rats gather on high walls, there will be a great flood. If a rat’s head is severed on the road, the age will be marked by warfare and slaughter.

If rats give birth to multiple-headed offspring, the land will be plagued by plunder. If rat pups are born without feet, it foretells a year of misfortune. If rats gather and carry away objects, there will be great famine. If rats damage crops, the state’s punishments and laws will be unjust. The Fire Star, summer’s fire, feathered insects, and winged insects all correspond to fire. The southern regions of bing and ding, governed by the virtue of fire, enact their mandate in summer, aligning with the sovereign and ministerial fires, and above with the Fire Star and the Sparkling Deluder, while below, insects correspond to feathers and wings.

If the Fire Star appears large and radiant, it brings joy, and the people will be healthy and harmonious. If it is small and red, it portends anger, and the people will suffer disasters and illness. If the Fire Star approaches the Woman constellation, pregnant women will face misfortune, and many mothers will die in childbirth. If the Fire Star nears the Southern Dipper, the ruler will face disaster. If the Fire Star approaches the sun and the moon turns red, there will be a great drought.

If the Fire Star grows large and develops rays, encircled by a green halo, it foretells scorching winds and heat-induced illnesses. If the Fire Star deviates from its course and wanders far, the people will suffer disasters and bloodshed. If the Fire Star’s rays are small and flanked by minor red stars, it foretells fires that damage homes and harm many people. If the Fire Star appears yellow and large, the land will be struck by plague. If the Fire Star turns white, armies will invade the imperial palace. If the Fire Star turns green, there will be many dry winds and droughts. If the Fire Star suddenly dims, a great flood will follow drought.

If the celestial fire of bing and ding burns ancestral temples due to the ruler’s lack of reverence, indulgence, or failure to uphold winter’s mandate, and if heavenly fire burns palaces, altars, and state temples, there will be great calamity, for the ruler lacks proper governance within. If the ruler lacks proper governance within and fails to act with integrity toward ministers, it will result in fire disasters. If heavenly fire burns palaces, temples, and residences, the ruler has lost virtuous conduct. If the ruler heeds the words of pregnant women, his harem will diminish.

If heavenly fire burns the gates of commanderies and cities, external rebellions will erupt. If heavenly fire burns the stables, war will begin. If heavenly fire burns many homes, the state’s laws will be flawed. If heavenly fire burns crops in the fields, the local lord has lost governance. If heavenly fire burns mountains and valleys, the chief minister is unjust. If heavenly fire burns all things, the ruler’s heart lacks compassion. If heavenly fire burns oxen, the state’s soldiers will harbor resentment.

If heavenly fire burns rivers and plains, military officials will be in subordinate positions. If heavenly fire burns tents in military camps, the army will be defeated. If heavenly fire burns trees and the trees wail, treacherous people will rise. If heavenly fire burns prisons, the imprisoned noble will be wronged. If heavenly fire burns streets, the people will be displaced. If heavenly fire burns the main hall, it means the ruler does not heed remonstrance.

If flames erupt at night but no fire is visible, the ruler is benighted. If fire arises and extinguishes on its own, the land will be consumed by mutual destruction. If fire burns city walls, great floods will sweep through. If the earth suddenly produces fire with a radiant glow, the state will perish. If fire emerges from the ground in a military camp, the army will be defeated and the general will die. If palaces and halls are scorched by fire without cause, blood will flow in the imperial palace.

If fire emerges from water, bandits will rise, and warfare will be inauspicious. If a phoenix appears even once, the land will enjoy a hundred years of great peace. If paired-wing birds arrive, virtue will extend to the hidden and obscure. If a white turtledove comes, the ruler will not abandon the old for the new. If a white swallow nests, the ruler possesses filial virtue. If a star falls and becomes a crow, a great army will arrive.

If a literary crow dwells in the wild, within three years there will be mourning and drought. If storks and magpies share a nest, it is a sign of decline and loss, as worthy men are overthrown. If magpies nest in trees, many people will die that year. If a crow has three heads, many people will die of illness. If a crow has four feet, the harvest will fail. If a crow has two heads and four feet, the land will be torn by war.

If a crow-like bird with deep red legs and a black body appears, there will be a fire. If a bird as large as a magpie with a black body, fleshy wings, a head like a swallow, and long tail feathers—called a "water demon"—appears, there will be a flood.

If wild geese soar and linger above the palace halls for two or three days, the commanderies and towns will rebel. If a crow caws at the ruler’s gate in a human voice, that ruler will perish. If multicolored flying crows circle the imperial chambers with strange cries, the sovereign will be unsettled. If flocks of crows take human form in flight, the ruler will fall and the people lose their livelihoods. If many crows descend to drink from a household’s well, that home will be emptied. If crows in flight assume the shapes of the six domestic animals, the world will be in chaos. If flocks of crows fly in the form of dragons, the emperor will flee the capital. If flocks of crows fly in the form of bees or flies, there will be a fire. If a wagtail bears young resembling hawks, there will be great winds, and the land will split into three. If a turtledove has one head and three bodies, the earth will quake and suffer damage.

If flocks of crows gather upon the water, women will hold power, and the kingly Way will be severed. If flocks of crows spiral as if in combat, blood will flow in that land. If locusts devour the grass, governance will fall to women. If locusts emerge and fly, then suddenly die on their own, within three years there will be great warfare. If bees are born within the state’s halls, it is inauspicious. If mole crickets swarm and gather at the court, a renowned general will emerge. If locusts have red heads and black bodies, or black heads and red bodies, governance will be harsh and oppressive, and bandits will rise in the wilds. If monstrous insects appear, the people will suffer violence.

In the second year of *Jianwu* during the Han, a strange insect emerged in Hebei, as large as a wild goose, with hair on its head tied like a black coin knot; when it alighted on grass, it could not fly, and transformed into green mud—thus the people of the realm suffered. If shrikes appear as omens, the ruler will face disaster. If creatures with many colors, as large as crows, with heads like cats and long, flat bodies appear—if shrikes gather in numbers, there will be flooding in the middle of the year. If shrikes cry out, there will be mourning and misfortune. If shrikes nest upon the roof and call incessantly, within sixty days disaster will strike. If flocks of crows cry repeatedly at night, the capital will be alarmed. If flocks of crows perch upon the roofs of homes, there will be a fire. If crows mate with domestic parrots, the state will be plagued by licentiousness.

If large crows damage the sprouts and ears of the five grains, the regional lord will fail to govern. If sparrows nest in wells, rebels will overthrow the ruler. If sparrows nest in trees, there will be a great flood. If sparrows and swallows contend, neighboring states will fall into chaos. If sparrows and owls fly together, ministers will rebel against the ruler. If flocks of sparrows attack crows, there will be drought and flood. If sparrows vanish, the year’s harvest will fail. If pheasants nest in trees, a great flood will come. If a pheasant enters a home, there will be sorrow. If pheasants sport in the ruler’s hall, the ruler will face disaster. If pheasants cry in flocks, the land will be divided. If pheasants come to mate with domestic parrots, then depart and return, there will be war.

If female parrots cry out at midnight, the realm will be rife with treachery. If a male parrot enters a well, there will be imprisonment. If parrots and crows clash, the ruler will kill. If parrots suddenly die in great numbers, the ruler will be weakened and resources depleted. If parrots cry at dusk, women will hold power. If parrots chase wild crows and fly high away, the local people will scatter. If parrots do not cry at sunrise, the ruler will lack sagacity. If parrots do not lay eggs but instead hatch strange insects, petty men will gain office. If parrots do not leave their nests by noon, the state’s decrees will be untimely. If a female parrot transforms into a male, a woman will later usurp power and disrupt governance.

In the second year of *Xianqing* during the Tang, a female parrot transformed into a male, and later Empress Wu became ruler. If a female parrot grows a crest, ministers will not submit. During the *Xingyuan* era of Emperor Yuan of Jin, a female parrot in Hengyang grew a crest; eighty days later, Huan Xuan established a state, and eighty days after that, he fell. If a parrot’s eggs hatch into bees, the five grains will not ripen. If a parrot’s eggs hatch into mice, there will be plunder and robbery. If parrots and wild crows enter a home, great disaster will strike. If ducks do not enter water, there will be severe drought. If ducks take flight, petty men will rise to high positions. If geese lay eggs resembling running beasts, ministers will be disloyal. If geese have two heads, two rulers will arise. If geese and ducks bear animal tails, the people will suffer calamity.

If a great crow with a hundred heads cries in a flock, the realm will be torn by war and the ruler will spawn many heirs. If a great crow devours wild beasts, a treacherous hero will emerge. If giant mosquitoes like bees come to harm people, the people will face disaster. If strange insects like cicadas, noisy and hooked, appear, petty men will gain influence. If a great crow perches upon the imperial hall and remains still without sound, it is auspicious; if it cries, it is inauspicious. If a great crow perches in a tree and flocks of crows attend it, the state will prosper and the people flourish.

The Central Palace, the Star of Stability, the earth, and the protective insects all correspond to earth. The Star of Stability in the Central Palace is the radiance of earth; when observed in proper motion, all is auspicious, but if it flows in reverse or loses its course, all portends misfortune. When the Star of Stability aligns with earth’s fortune, it corresponds above to the Supreme Yin’s celestial governance, and all omens of disaster or fortune are judged by its conjunction with Saturn.

If the Star of Stability is large and bright, the people will be at peace; if small and dim, the ruler and people will face disaster. If it is large with rays, horns, and a brilliant glow, surrounded by red qi, the realm will suffer pestilence. If it appears alongside a yellow haze in the sky, yellow winds will rise, followed by great plague. If the Star of Stability is small and retreats in reverse, with white qi encroaching upon it, there will be severe drought and the people will suffer. If the Star of Stability is large and yellow, with five ranks of small yellow stars attending it, there will be great abundance and the people will be at peace.

If the Star of Stability flows but does not move, the region it passes over will face disaster. If it moves in reverse and retreats greatly, with rays and horns, there will be military conflict and the people will suffer. Among the five planets, the Star of Stability moves most slowly, taking two and a half years to traverse one palace—this is its regular course. If it moves swiftly out of turn, both military and people will face disaster, and all transformations will be unsettled. If the Star of Stability suddenly turns green, there will be great winds, and the five grains will fail. If it suddenly vanishes, there will first be drought, then rain—either the rain will be uneven, or there will first be rain, then great floods.

If the Star of Stability turns black, there will be prolonged heavy rains. If it is not near the sun but suddenly vanishes, the ruler will perish. If the Star of Stability is small and encircled by a halo, many people will die in disasters.

The Star of Stability shifts and drifts to left or right—this portends civil strife and military chaos. If beneath the Star of Stability appears a crimson qi stretching over ten feet long, it signifies that scheming ministers will seize power.

When the Star of Stability first emerges and appears large, with a white qi extending over fifty feet above it, it foretells slaughter and bloodshed across a thousand li. If the Star of Stability is large and moves in its regular course, with a purple qi trailing behind, it signifies that the emperor’s son will ascend the throne.

If the Star of Stability trespasses against the Southern Dipper, the ruler will face disaster. Should the Star of Stability enter the Celestial River and dim, lingering without movement, people will resort to cannibalism. If the Star of Stability trespasses against the Northern Dipper, the throne will change hands within twelve years.

When a retinue of stars attends the Star of Stability below, the realm will turn toward enlightenment. If a star falls and turns to earth, there will be great famine and bloodshed; if it falls and turns to sand and stone, war will erupt and the state will perish.

When the earth trembles violently, the ruler will lose his throne within a thousand days. If the earth quakes across a thousand li, construction projects will surge, and that year will be inauspicious. All earth tremors are ominous. If the earth quakes and damages city walls, houses, and people, it is called "loss," and warfare will spread across the four seas.

If the earth splits open a zhang wide, the five grains will suffer. If the earth splits beneath the ruler’s gate, ministers will rise from within. If the earth splits in the marketplace, the state will face misfortune. If the earth bleeds, bloodshed will follow. If the earth turns red as cinnabar, turmoil will erupt immediately. If the earth produces crow eggs, the people will fall ill. If the earth splits open a li wide, the general will perish and the state will fall.

When mountains collapse and break, turning into valleys filled with water, the realm will be overrun with refugees. If the earth suddenly rises in the middle of a road, the realm will enjoy great prosperity. If the earth sinks on its own, that state will perish.

In the eighth year of Emperor An of Jin’s *Yuanxing* reign, during the third lunar month of spring, the earth in Shanyin sank four chi deep with a sound like thunder—later, war erupted in fulfillment of the omen. If the earth rises in a city or market, the state will prosper; if it rises within a city’s walls, the structures will decay and collapse. If the earth rises in the marketplace, the state will benefit.

If the earth rises within the altars of soil and grain, the king’s power will grow. If the land produces stones, spring and summer will bring prosperity. If the earth sinks into the ruler’s chambers, ministers will plot rebellion. If the earth collapses on its own, forming springs or producing strange objects, the people will suffer from floods and great disasters.

If sounds arise from tombs, the ruler will face turmoil. If tombs shift on their own, natural disasters will strike and the state will fall. If tombs sink, the people will flee. If trees atop tombs wither, plagues will spread among the people.

If the earth trembles in a military encampment, battle will ensue. If flies and insects appear in a wild encampment, the army will be defeated and the general will die. If pits form in the encampment, the general will perish. If the earth splits in a military camp, it is auspicious to relocate. If the earth sinks or splits within ancestral temples, the state will perish.

If dragons emerge from earth fissures, the ruler will be exiled. If fire arises from earth fissures, the army will be destroyed. If the earth does not freeze in winter, the state will undergo political change. If the earth suddenly produces "soil coins," the people will scatter. If holes appear beneath a household’s rooms, the family will be ruined. If holes appear beneath the imperial gates, the state will fall.

If the earth grows fur in the morning, floods will come. If it grows fur at dusk, rebellion will arise. If the earth produces flesh-like masses, the army and people will suffer disasters. If countless flying insects emerge from earthen holes, plagues will kill many. If black qi rises from earthen holes, the state will harbor secret plots. If white qi emerges and scatters into mist, rebellion will follow.

If a light drizzle falls in winter fog—called "heaven weeping over corpses"—the people will lose their ruler. If snakes emerge from earth fissures, rebellion will come. If humans emerge from earth fissures, disasters will strike. If fish emerge from earth fissures, floods will come. If metal objects emerge from earth fissures, great war will follow. If rats appear from earth fissures, the state will face famine and chaos.

If the earth produces a human face, the wrongly punished will appear. If it produces a human eye, turmoil will follow. If it produces earthen horses, war will erupt. If it produces earthen humans, the feudal lords will rebel. If it produces earthen beasts, the northern tribes will invade. If it produces earthen oxen, discarding them brings good fortune.

If human voices arise from the earth, people will die in disasters. If dog sounds arise from the earth, the state will face trouble. If the cries of flying birds arise from the earth, the people will suffer. If bell sounds arise from the earth, high ministers will face disaster. If thunder sounds arise from the earth, plagues will spread.

If a person grows an extra head atop their own, war will come. If the dead revive in great numbers, famine and rebellion will follow. During the reign of Sun Hao of Wu, the Jiao family revived after seven months in the earth—soon after, the state fell.

If a person is born speaking, the state will face slanderous traitors. If a person is born invisible, royal affairs will grow urgent and the people will flee. If a person is born with dragon or snake features, the state will be invaded. If a virgin gives birth, a son brings good fortune while a daughter brings misfortune. If a person is born with rat features, their land will be seized. If a person is born with wild beast features, barbarian tribes will rise within a year. If a person is born with ox or horse features, war will come. If a person is born with dog or pig features, the ruler will lose the Dao.

If a person is born with a fish’s head, great floods will come. If a person is born with four eyes, the state will decline. If a person is born with eyes on their abdomen, grain will become expensive. If a person is born with a sealed mouth, famine will strike. If a person is born without a head or limbs, the ruler will neglect court affairs. If a person is born without ears or a nose, the ruler will be blind to remonstrance.

If a person is born with many feet, refugees will scatter. If a person is born with hands like feet, treacherous ministers will arise. If a person is born with one head and two bodies, the ruler will lose authority. If a person is born without feet, war and mourning will bring chaos, and the state’s foundations will weaken.

If a person is born with wings and flies away, severe drought will come. If a person is born resembling a yaksha, a cunning hero will rise. If a person is born with ox horns, beasts will fight. If a person is born with flying bird features, refugees will flee within two years. If a person is born without two arms, the state will lose its advisors. If a person is born with one arm, the state will lose loyal worthies. If a person is born with one foot, the state will lose wise counsel.

If a person is born with ten children, feudal lords will vie for power. If a person is born with three sons, great peace will come. If a person is born with three daughters, the state will grow licentious and lose governance. If a person is born as a flesh-like mass, famine will strike. If a person is born without genitals, the state will lack court rituals.

If a person is born with red hair like cinnabar, drought will come, and the family line will end. If a person is born with reversed ribs, a cunning hero will rise. If a person is born without hair, a disastrous year will follow. If a person is born with eyebrows extending past their feet, the state will enjoy longevity. If a person is born with hair covering their face, the state will face many troubles.

If a person is born with a face on their back, disloyal ministers will arise. If a person is born with four feet, the realm will boil over. If a person is born with hair like a monkey’s, the realm will face turmoil. If a person is born with a donkey’s head, upright ministers will not assist. If a person is born with a tail, the people will suffer disasters.

If a person is born with two mouths, the harvest will fail. If a person is born with two pillars and three nostrils on their nose, the state will enjoy good fortune. If a person is born with two pupils in one eye, it is an omen of supreme auspiciousness. If a person is born with seven pupils, the realm will face many troubles. If a person is born with four breasts, the realm will see conquests.

If a person is born with three eyes, the realm will prosper. If a person is born with a dog’s head, the ruler’s heart will be unrighteous. If a person is born with a sheep’s head, the ruler will grow licentious and lose governance. If a person is born with a boar’s head, lewd women will seize power. If a person is born with a monkey’s head, foreign ministers will be disloyal.

If a person is born without nine orifices, the realm will be blocked, and the ruler will be blind. If a person is born with their face on their back, the state will face misfortune. If a person is born with three heads, the state will face conflict. If a person is born with a donkey’s lips, rebellious ministers will arise. If a person is born with a crow’s egg, the state will not promote worthies.

If fog rises from the earth, it corresponds to the virtue of soil. If red qi appears in fog, a great plague will come. If fog transforms into yellow clouds, a severe plague will spread. If thick fog first turns purple then black, darkening the day like night, secret plots will arise within. If fog transforms into green clouds, later becoming purple qi, a sage emperor dwells among the people.

If a great fog persists for seven days without dispersing, the ruler will grow blind to governance.

If fog arises and transforms into rain, lingering without clearing, the ruler heeds the words of a wanton woman. If yellow clouds obscure the sun and later black fog emerges, great rain will follow. If green qi encroaches upon the sun, scattering into yellow qi, wind and rain will come. In evening divination, if red qi later shifts to black clouds, and yellow mingles within, prolonged rain will ensue. If white qi embraces the sun and black clouds cover it, hail will form within the clouds.

The Star of Venus, metal and stone, mountains and valleys, and armored insects all correspond to the Metal phase. The west, governed by the Metal virtue of Geng and Xin, aligns above with Venus, above with the Yang Brightness Controller of Heaven, in the middle with the excessive Metal phase of the year’s qi, and below with the Yang Brightness in the Springs. If Venus appears high and small, it portends great peace. If Venus appears large and radiant, war will arise. If Venus deviates from its course, approaching the south means war in the south; approaching the north means war in the north. If Venus traverses the constellations, its form tapering above and broadening below, advancing and retreating in proper measure, the realm will prosper. If Venus should remain visible when it ought to be hidden, ministers will disobey. If Venus hides when it should not, military affairs will falter. If Venus appears in daylight, great battles will follow. If Venus and the moon eclipse one another at an unusual time, generals will be executed. If Venus enters the moon and its stellar hue remains distinct, ministers plot against the ruler. If Venus emerges in the east while the moon is not yet full, and the star lies south of the moon, it bodes well; if north, armies will be defeated.

When Venus appears in the west at the moon’s first crescent, if the star lies north of the moon in the yin position, the state’s armies will be strong; if south, the central kingdom’s armies will prevail. If Venus and the moon draw near, with three fingers’ space between them, armies will be strong; two fingers’ space portends city distress; one finger’s space means cities will fall and generals flee. If Venus lies north of Saturn, lands will be lost and the state perish. If Venus appears in the east, visible even after sunrise, war will come. If Venus is large at first appearance but later diminishes, armies will weaken. If Venus is small at first but later grows, armies will strengthen. If Venus and Mars converge, one in the east and one in the west, kings and lords will suffer. If Venus sinks into the Milky Way, small and dim, a million will be slain, and blood will flow for a thousand li.

When stars fall as metal or iron, the realm will face war. If cauldrons boil in the wild, emerging from the earth, within three years a state will be usurped. In the third year of the Green Dragon reign of the Wei, Cheng Xiu built palaces, seized Jing’an in the west, and erected a bronze basin to catch dew; the sound of trees breaking echoed for a thousand li as the Metal heavens wept. Thus, the city of Ba flowed away—this was Metal losing its nature. If bells toll on their own, within three years war and chaos will arise. In the tenth year of Emperor An of Jin’s Yongxing reign, Mount Huo collapsed, revealing six bells; later, the throne passed to Liu Yu, Duke of Song.

If stone drums sound on their own, the state will be unsettled. In the time of the Three Hao, stone drums tolled, and the next year Sun En rebelled. If metal drums sound on their own, war will arise. If swords ring on their own, it is inauspicious. If a sword’s blade weeps blood, victory in battle will follow. If the ruler’s sword unsheathes itself, accompanied by blood and sound, war and wounds will come. If the blades of halberds and spears ring, war will arise. If a mirror fails to reflect one’s head, harm will befall. If gold in the state treasury suddenly leaps, the land’s ruler will change. If gold, jade, and treasures in the market suddenly become cheap, the noble will suffer losses.

If cauldrons in a military camp ring, the general will achieve merit. If stone statues weep, the world will fall into chaos. If stone statues emerge in the wild or mountains, a commoner will become ruler. In the second year of Sun Quan’s Wufeng reign, fifth month, in Yangxian County beneath Black Mountain, a stone statue over ten feet tall stood upright—this fulfilled the *Book of Changes* prophecy of Jing Fang that a commoner would become emperor. If stones form the shapes of birds or beasts, lords will rise. If stones resemble flying crows, the ruler’s female relatives and close ministers will conspire. If stones take the form of children, the ruler’s line will end. If stones appear on roads, the state will lose its ruler. If stones appear in stone quarries, the three armies will plot rebellion. If stones grow hair-like strands, within five years war will be plotted. If stones pile atop one another, within five years conspiracies will form. If stones emerge from water, close ministers and women will collude.

If mountains emit purple qi like lingzhi mushrooms, a sagely and enlightened ruler will appear. If mountains produce vessels or chariots, a sagely ruler will arise. When the sage-king Shun ascended the throne, mountains yielded chariots, white essence offered tribute, the Old Man Star appeared, waters flowed freely, the sea stilled its waves, irrigation came in season, the sun and moon shone brightly, and the sage’s virtue reached all without obstruction. If mountains produce auspicious qi, it heralds great peace. When auspicious qi appears, worthies emerge in the wilds, and noble men fill the court.

If mountains wail like men day and night for no reason, war and mourning will come. In the year a state is to perish, stones weep and ghosts wail, and blood rains from the sky. If mountains collapse without cause, the state will divide, and the ruler’s virtue will wane. If mountains collapse in spring, the state will be invaded; in summer, great floods will come; in autumn, great armies will arise; in winter, famine will strike. If mountains split apart, ruler and ministers will contend. If mountains roar like thunder, bandits will come within half a year. If mountains collapse and divide, war will come to that land. If mountains produce strange things unseen by men—with form, substance, or sound—their towns will face great floods and famine.

If mountains tremble at unusual times, the realm will be at war. If mountains suddenly glow, it bodes ill for ministers. If mountains turn red as blood, lords will not aid, and father and son will be estranged. If mountains transform into human shapes, the state will be hollowed. If water in mountain caves flows with the sound of jade, a sagely ruler will ascend the throne. (This jade-like sound is the "jade tone.") If mountains emit green or black qi, their waters will harm people and creatures. If mountains display white qi like silk or jade, it is an auspicious sign. If mountains reveal five-colored clouds and radiance, the king will bring peace, and the people will live in joy.

If tortoises grow green fur, it heralds great peace. If a tortoise’s eyes are white as pearls, an enlightened ruler will appear. If a tortoise resembles conjoined jade, a sagely ruler will emerge.

When crabs emerge in great numbers, it portends fierce winds. When conches sound, it portends fierce winds. When clams emit light, it portends overcast rain. When dried conches cry out on their own, it portends disaster and chaos. When turtles and snakes mate, and many are seen, it portends the state’s collapse and governance’s failure. When conches and clams gather in the capital, rebel armies will rise in turmoil. When flying birds eat clams, it portends famine. When turtles speak in human words, it portends ministers’ rebellion. When turtles and soft-shelled turtles devour fish, it portends famine. A three-legged turtle portends great peace. A three-tailed turtle portends bumper harvests. A nine-tailed turtle portends the state’s prosperity. A four-eyed turtle portends chaos under heaven. When conches and clams are excessively numerous, it portends the people’s suffering. When conches and clams frantically roam on the water’s surface, it portends military upheaval. A white soft-shelled turtle portends foreign ministers’ rebellion. A three-legged soft-shelled turtle portends the rise of feudal lords to kingship. A crab with four shells portends war. When turtles and soft-shelled turtles roam in markets, it portends military upheaval. When a turtle grows horns, it portends plunder and violence. When a soft-shelled turtle grows horns, petty men will seize power.

When frost arrives in accordance with the seasons, the state will possess majesty. If frost lingers at noon and returns after seeing the sun, it signifies ministers executing punishments without regard for the ruler. If frost melts before sunrise, it signifies the ruler failing to administer punishments. If frost persists after seeing the sun, it signifies the ruler’s unyielding authority, impervious to challenge. If frost appears without stars visible, it signifies ministers executing the ruler’s punishments. If frost does not kill living things, it signifies ministers usurping the ruler’s authority. If frost emits sound, it portends armies invading. If frost in the third lunar month kills grass and trees, there will be war and famine. If frost does not fall in late autumn, state governance will falter.

The rivers, seas, streams, wells, scaled creatures, Chen Star (Mercury), and hailstones correspond to the Water phase in the north. The Chen Star, embodying the Water virtue, aligns above with the Celestial Cold Water (Taiyang), harmonizes in the middle with the Water phase’s movement, and corresponds below with the Terrestrial Taiyang. When the Chen Star appears unusually yet shines in proper measure, the people will live in great peace. When the Chen Star appears large and radiant, it portends severe cold and snow. When it appears small and dim, it portends the people’s suffering. When it appears bright yet without sharp rays, clear and luminous, it portends civilized virtue and sagely power. When black qi coils beneath the Chen Star, it portends great floods. When the Chen Star appears small and yellow, it portends a warm winter without cold. When the Chen Star deviates from its course, moves erratically, or wanders, it portends disastrous years.

The Ren and Gui stems embody the Water virtue. When the Yellow River yields the *Hetu* (River Diagram) and the Luo River yields the *Luoshu* (Luo River Writing), when sweet springs flow and sweet dew descends, these all portend the auspicious signs of an enlightened ruler. The Yellow Emperor was born at Shouqiu, and at his birth, sweet springs flowed—a response to the auspicious omen, signifying the virtue of an enlightened ruler. When the sea remains calm without waves, it reflects the virtue of an enlightened ruler. When the Yellow River runs clear, it corresponds to great peace. It clears in alignment with enlightened times, not merely once every three thousand years. When water fails to moisten what lies below, punishments will be unjust. When all rivers flow toward their source, the ruler holds governance firmly.

When water transforms like blood, it will kill people in that land. In the second year of Chen Taijian, the Yangtze River turned to blood, reaching Jinling—later, war erupted, and the last ruler’s state fell. When islands in water grow long, the corresponding region will prosper. When the Earth Star (Saturn) falls and becomes water, it portends war, loss, floods, droughts, and famine. When springs flow without rain, the state will suffer great floods. When springs surge without rain, the people will face chaos. In the fifth year of Yong’an during the reign of Sun Hao of Wu, on the *renwu* day of the eighth month, the Yangtze River swelled and rose—two years later, great armies arose.

When water suddenly reverses its flow, women will confuse and disrupt governance. When flowing water halts, the land will face famine. When stagnant water suddenly flows, war will erupt across the land. When flowing water abruptly changes course, the state will alter its policies. When water in a capital or city suddenly dries up or shifts location, the city’s people will flee. When pond water suddenly overflows, the ruler will perish. When clear water suddenly turns turbid, the heavens will descend into chaos. When water flows through court and market, it portends military upheaval and governance’s collapse. When water freezes in late spring, the state will lose its governance. When water freezes in summer, the year will not yield harvests. When water freezes in autumn, the year will bring chaos. When water does not freeze in winter, the people will fall ill. When water suddenly cries out, the people will suffer. When water produces a metallic sound, the people will be displaced from their lands. When water suddenly emerges from rock crevices, ministers will plot to seize power. When well water overflows, people will flee in disaster. When well water suddenly turns turbid, the land will face plunder and violence. When sounds emerge from wells, it portends war. When black clouds rise from wells, great floods will come. When wells emit qi in summer, yin and yang will lose balance, and the people will fall ill. When thunder arises from wells, droughts and floods will strike unevenly.

When dragon eggs appear in rivers, great floods will come. When water suddenly emerges in a household’s courtyard, great wealth will follow. When ponds and marshes suddenly dry up, the city will decline and face misfortune. When the Yellow River runs dry, it is called "yin reversed," and within five years, people will flee. When the sea tide does not advance, the ruler’s Dao will falter. When the Yellow River surges like mountain peaks, it is called "threatening suppression," and within five years, ministers will rebel. When the sea tide does not recede for long, the state will face chaotic governance. When the sea surges like mountains, the world will be restless and unpeaceful. When rivers suddenly transform, within six years, the state will change rulers. When lakes resemble sea tides, ministers will rebel. When high mounds transform into marshes, their lands will be diminished.

When flowing water carries metal, it portends great peace. When flowing water carries written characters, it portends great peace. When flowing water carries brocade and embroidery, it portends the people’s suffering. When flowing water carries strange wood, an enlightened ruler will appear. When flowing water carries strange beasts, the world will descend into chaos. Hail, snow, and all such phenomena are transformations of water.

When hail falls in summer, it signifies untimely storage of ice. During winter, when the Dipper points to the northern region and the sun aligns with the Xu constellation, the state should store ice, offering it to ancestral temples. If this is not done according to the season, hail will strike in summer. When hail falls upon people, the ruler should heed their grievances. When hail kills birds, the ruler listens to slander. When hail strips tree bark and breaks branches, the ruler will enforce cruel punishments, and the people will harm themselves.

When hail destroys the five grains, and the hailstones bear what seem to be eyes, this is Heaven’s warning of punishment—it is the people’s transgression. When hail falls like pearls, the ruler intends harm upon the people. When hail falls like goose eggs, the ruler is arrogant and negligent. When hail falls like crows’ beaks, Heaven warns against slanderous ministers.

Whenever the Greater Yang governs the heavens, cold encroaches upon the summer mandate. If the summer mandate serves Heaven and fails to enact scorching heat, hail will not fall. If the ruler and minister—both associated with Fire—do not serve Heaven and instead enforce scorching decrees, hail will descend. This is called Heaven’s reprimand through the transformation of Fire.

When winter brings extreme cold yet no snow falls, the ruler lacks governance. When winter brings rain but no snow, yin and yang have reversed their mandates. When snowflakes are large in the air but small upon reaching the ground, punishments are misapplied. When snow accumulates in human shapes, the people face disaster. When snow accumulates in the form of flying birds, the state harbors slanderous ministers. When snow accumulates in the shapes of wolves and tigers, the yin lands will prevail in war. When snow blankets objects but not mountains, the state fails to embrace great worthies.

When snow falls but rises before reaching the ground, only to descend again, the ruler intends to wrong the innocent. When snow falls warm, the ruler will be absolved of guilt.

Scaled creatures take the form of water, manifesting its transformations. When dragons appear, it heralds great peace. When fish are born with two heads, war will follow. When a yellow dragon appears, it is an auspicious sign for the ruler. When Emperor Shun assumed the throne, a yellow dragon bore a jade ring in its presence, revealing a sage and enlightened ruler.

When dragons gather in a state, strife will arise. During the reign of Duke Zhao of Lu, dragons appeared, and Zichan said: "Cultivate virtue, and no harm will come." When a dragon drinks from the water within a military camp, the state will be weakened. When a dragon appears in a river, the ruler will face disaster. When a dragon enters a human dwelling or emerges from a pond, it signifies ministers plotting against their sovereign.

When snakes gather on roads or in cities, or when they swarm markets, it bodes ill for the state. When snakes appear in the main hall during winter, it is inauspicious—do not kill them. When snakes mate in the marketplace, the state will perish. When snakes appear in the market during winter, great ministers plot treason. When snakes enter wells, the people will suffer illness. When snakes are born with two heads, war will come. When a snake is born with one horn, it heralds a feudal lord. When a snake is born with two feet, the people will face disaster. When a snake is born with two tails, bandits and raiders will multiply. When a snake is born with four feet, plunder and violence will erupt.

When people mistakenly call a snake a dragon, the state will be unstable. When a snake is born with a rat’s head, the state will be weakened. When a snake is born with a crow’s beak, it foretells ominous filth. When a snake is born with a human head, the people will suffer death. When a snake is born with crow’s wings, a treacherous hero will rise.

When fish are born with beast-like heads, the state will be unstable. When fish are born with human heads, disease will spread. When fish are born with crow’s beaks, disaster will follow upon sight. When paired fish appear in great numbers, benevolence will extend across the land. When carp grow horns, feudal lords will govern. When Heaven rains fish, there will be war and mourning. When fish traverse human roads, the world will descend into chaos. When the sea punishes great fish, driving them onto land, a high minister will pass. When whales emerge from the sea, the ruler will perish. When fish grow crow’s wings, the world will fall into disorder. When fish are born with four eyes, disaster will strike. When fish appear in great numbers, the harvest will fail. When fish are cheap in the market, famine will follow. When fish grow crow’s tails, the state will undergo change. When *tui*-fish appear, young children will face disaster. When fish resemble women’s faces, licentiousness and chaos will reign.

When rivers and lakes run dry of fish, violent warfare will erupt. During the reigns of King Wu of Chu and King Liu Tan of Wu, a fish from the sea was used as a basin, and in that year, fish vanished from rivers and lakes—turmoil ensued. When fish leap from the water and do not return, sudden war will come. When fish are born with three mouths, it bodes ill for the state. When fish are born eyeless, the state’s governance will falter. When fish are born with human hands, plunder and violence will arise. When fish leap from the water, the people will face disaster. When fish are born with human feet, petty men will serve as ministers. When fish are born tailless, the world will descend into chaos, and people will scatter. When fish gather in broken schools, war will erupt.

The above five categories of anomalous transformations are not mere aberrations—they have existed since ancient times, arising in accordance with the movements of Heaven and Earth’s qi, yielding responses: misfortune answers misfortune, and fortune answers fortune.

**Record of the Origins of Transformation and Endowment**

There is a thing formless yet complete, emerging from the primordial void, where not a single speck of dust yet settled. At the beginning of the wondrous Dao of the Great Beginning, existence arose from non-existence. Before Heaven and Earth took shape, the Great Beginning coalesced into the Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate divided, giving birth to Heaven and Earth: the pure qi ascended to form Heaven, while the turbid qi descended to form Earth. The yin essence of Earth became the moon, and the yang essence of Heaven became the sun. The union of sun and moon generated the five planets in the heavens. As Earth first opened, it bore a child named the Five Phases, which shared a kind with the five planets, while the Six Qi formed a single [pattern].

Thus, Earth gave rise to springs and sources as water. The Kan position of the moon lies in the north, so water was born first—its number is one. Next, the yang qi of Heaven became fire. The Li position of the sun resides in the south, so fire was born next—its number is two. Then, water’s veins nourished life, giving rise to grasses and trees. The Kan position in the north generates the Zhen, and Zhen generates wood in the east—thus, wood’s number is three. Next, the primordial transformation gave rise to mountains and peaks, which produced gold and jade. Thus, the Kun position generates the Dui, and Dui generates metal in the west—hence, metal’s number is four. Then, the four directions took form, giving rise to the central soil—thus, soil’s number is five, and it resides in the center.

Among the Five Phases, soil is revered, for it is the Kun soil. This is not the child of fire but the primordial division when turbid qi descended to form Earth—it is the Kun origin. The Kun origin began with the wondrous Dao of the Great Beginning, hence the reverence for Kun soil. The child born of fire is the central soil, not the Kun origin. Thus, Kun and the central soil must occupy two distinct positions.

On Earth, these took form as the Five Phases; in Heaven, they became the Six Qi. The commands of Heaven manifest as wind, which is the Jueyin wood—the first qi.

The east wind harmonizes to become warmth—this is the Shaoyin sovereign fire, hence the second qi. Within warmth arises heat to become summerheat—this is the Shaoyang ministerial fire, hence the third qi. Within summerheat, steaming and nurturing produce dampness—this is the Taiyin soil, hence the fourth qi. Amidst rain and dampness, transformation yields clarity—this is the Yangming metal, hence the fifth qi. Within clarity, cold arises to become chill—this is the Taiyang water, hence the sixth qi. Within cold, wind is born, completing the cycle to return to the beginning. From this point onward, it continues endlessly like a ring without end, cycling without cease.

Thus, Heaven generates Jupiter, and Earth generates wood; when Earth generates wood, Heaven generates wind, and the union of *ding* and *ren* gives rise to furred creatures. Heaven generates Mars, and Earth generates fire; when Earth generates fire, Heaven generates heat, and the union of *wu* and *gui* gives rise to feathered creatures—here, the sovereign and ministerial fires are as one. Heaven generates Saturn, and Earth generates soil; Kun soil first gives rise to *si* fire, for at this time fire generates soil. When Earth generates soil, Heaven generates dampness, which transforms into rain and dew. The union of *jia* and *ji* gives rise to naked creatures.

Heaven generates Venus, and Earth generates metal; when Earth generates metal, Heaven generates emotion. Why does metal transform into dryness? When *xin* is wedded to *bing* as husband, *geng* and *ren* await *xin*’s return; when *xin* returns, it bears fire and metal returns—thus metal transforms into dryness, for this is the husband’s command. This clear transformation is metal’s inherent nature. The union of *yi* and *geng* gives rise to scaled creatures.

Heaven generates Mercury, and Earth generates water; when Earth generates water, Heaven generates cold, and the union of *bing* and *xin* gives rise to scaled creatures.

Heaven generates the qi of birth, and Earth generates spring; when Earth generates sourness, Heaven generates *jue*, and the flow of wood’s movement gives rise to green—the image of the Azure Dragon, paired with the east. Heaven generates the qi of growth, and Earth generates summer; when Earth generates bitterness, Heaven generates *zhi*, and the flow of fire’s movement gives rise to red—the image of the Vermilion Bird, paired with the south. Heaven generates the qi of transformation, and Earth generates long summer (the summer season); soil reigns over the four seasons, and the late summer corresponds to Kun, the true soil position—long summer is the time of nurturing. When Earth generates sweetness, Heaven generates *gong*, and the flow of soil’s movement gives rise to yellow—the image of the August Spirit, paired with the central Kun. The August Spirit encompasses all soil spirits.

Heaven generates the qi of harvest, and Earth generates autumn; when Earth generates acridity, Heaven generates *shang*, and the flow of metal’s movement gives rise to white—the image of the White Tiger, paired with the west. Heaven generates the qi of storage, and Earth generates winter; when Earth generates saltiness, Heaven generates *yu*, and the flow of water’s movement gives rise to black—the image of the Dark Warrior, paired with the north.

Earth generates the *Kan* trigram, and Heaven generates the first palace. Earth generates the *Kun* trigram, and Heaven generates the second palace. Earth generates the *Zhen* trigram, and Heaven generates the third palace. Earth generates the *Xun* trigram, and Heaven generates the fourth palace. Earth generates the central soil, and Heaven generates the fifth palace. Earth generates the *Qian* trigram, and Heaven generates the sixth palace. Earth generates the *Dui* trigram, and Heaven generates the seventh palace. Earth generates the *Gen* trigram, and Heaven generates the eighth palace. Earth generates the *Li* trigram, and Heaven generates the ninth palace. The nine palaces correspond to Earth’s eight trigrams, with Heaven’s nine as an odd number—yang—and Earth’s eight as an even number—yin. Thus, Heaven’s odd yang gives rise to creation, and Earth’s even yin gives rise to transformation—this is called *zaohua* (creation-transformation).

Therefore, yang creates and yin transforms—this is the source of creation and transformation. The term *zaohua* signifies the mutual generation of yin and yang; tracing its origin, yin and yang both arise from the Great Beginning. Later, yin and yang generate one another—yang is born within yin, and yin is born within yang. Thus, when yang reaches its extreme, yin is born, and when yin reaches its extreme, yang is born.

Now, the myriad things—grasses, trees, fruits, grains, flowers, and herbs—are the ancestral roots of inherent nature, all formed naturally from the single qi of the great Dao. Thereafter, creation and transformation diverge. The sprout is creation, and the seed is transformation. If one claims the sprout arises from the seed and the seed matures from the sprout, tracing this to its source becomes unfathomable. Rather, it begins with the single qi of Heaven and Earth in their natural state—at this time, root and sprout arise together. Later, the sprout generates the seed, and the seed generates the sprout—thus it is called *zaohua*. Therefore, the sprout is creation, and the seed is the source of transformation. This is the source of all transformations, and so too are the transformations of the five creatures.

The five creatures encompass all living things in the world, divided into five to correspond with the Five Phases. Now, humans correspond to soil as naked creatures, serving as the chief of the five creatures. From the Great Beginning and the Great Ultimate, when Heaven and Earth first opened, the single qi of the great Dao formed naturally. At that time, male and female arose together; later, through union, humans were born. Thus, the body is creation, and yin qi is the source of transformation. Yin qi refers to the male organ and the female genitalia—the source of transformation. The body generates the yin organ, and the yin organ generates humans through union. This is like plants where the sprout generates the seed, and the seed generates the sprout. Or like birds laying eggs—eggs come from birds, and birds come from eggs—thus its source cannot be exhausted. Tracing it to the beginning, when Heaven and Earth first divided, natural transformation was the same: male and female arose together, later diverging into creation and transformation through union. Within the egg, birds are born, each with male and female. Thus, form is creation, and the egg is the source of transformation.

Now, this principle applies to all five creatures and the myriad transformations, all originating from the beginning of Heaven and Earth.

**The Six Yuan Cyclical Return Annals**

The Yellow Emperor asked: What is the governance of Greater Yang?
Qibo replied: It is the cycle of *chen* and *xu*. Greater Yang governs Wood and is thus placed at the beginning.

**Greater Angle** corresponds to the excessive Wood phase of the central movement. *Jiao* is the note of Wood, hence *Greater Jiao*. Greater Yin descends to appear as Greater Yin at the spring.
*Ren-chen* and *ren-xu* years: *xu* governs the proper transformation, while *chen* governs the oppositional transformation. Its movement is the transformation of Wind and Wood, for *ding* and *ren* govern Wood, hence the Wind transformation. Its transformation manifests as the stirring of plain silk, the splitting and unfolding of the first qi—wind whistles, branches sway, plain silk tears, and all things sprout and begin to grow. Its aberration brings shaking, uprooting, and destruction, for Wind’s fundamental nature is Wood; excess harms Wood itself. Its afflictions include dizziness, tremors, and blurred vision, for when qi is excessive, the Liver suffers its own illness.

**Greater Angle** begins with Wood as the initial qi. Thus, *ren-xu* opposes, while *ren-chen* governs the proper phase.
**Lesser Zhi** arises when *ren-xu* generates *gui-hai* and *ren-chen* generates *gui-si*. This is the first element giving rise to the second, for *gui* governs Fire and *si-hai* are Yin, hence *Lesser Zhi*. *Zhi* is the Yin of Fire.
**Greater Gong** arises when *gui-hai* generates *jia-zi* and *gui-si* generates *jia-wu*. *Zi* and *wu* are Yang years, hence the excessive *jia* Earth movement, thus *Greater Gong*. *Gong* is the note of Earth, marking the nurturing of the third element.
**Lesser Shang** arises when *jia-zi* generates *yi-chou* and *jia-wu* generates *yi-wei*. *Yi* governs Metal, and *chou-wei* are Yin years of insufficiency, hence *Lesser Shang*. *Shang* is the note of Metal, marking the nurturing of the fourth element.
**Greater Yu** concludes, for Wood begins and Water ends—this is the head and tail of the Six Qi. Thus, the characters *jiao* and *yu* reveal the beginning and end. This occurs when *yi-chou* generates *bing-yin* and *yi-wei* generates *bing-shen*. *Bing* governs Water, and *yin-shen* are Yang years of excess, hence *Greater Yu*. *Yu* is the note of Water, marking the nurturing of the fifth element.

**Lesser Jiao** marks the return to Yin. As the *Suwen* states, "the door does not descend, and the shoes are placed for the cyclical return." This sixth element begins anew, completing the cycle and returning to *jiao*—thus resuming the beginning. There is one more position, initiating a new cycle’s head, this being the sixth element. *Bing-yin* generates *ding-mao*, and *bing-shen* generates *ding-you*. *Ding* governs Wood, hence *Lesser Jiao*, for *mao-you* are Yin years of insufficiency. Thus, *ding* reappears as *ren*. *Ding* and *ren* harmonize their stem virtues, for *ding* and *ren* govern Wood, and *jiao* reappears—hence the term "cyclical return."

Greater Yang governs Fire and is thus placed second, as the Controller of Heaven.
**Greater Zhi** corresponds to the excessive Fire phase of the central movement. *Zhi* is the note of Fire, hence *Greater Zhi*. Greater Yin descends to appear as Greater Yin at the spring.
*Wu-chen* and *wu-xu* years: *xu* governs the proper transformation, while *chen* governs the oppositional transformation. Its movement is the transformation of Heat, for *wu* governs Fire, and *chen-xu* are Yang years where Fire enacts the mandate of Heat, hence Heat. Its transformation manifests as warmth, summerheat, and oppressive heat—all Fire qi in excess, hence extreme Heat. Its aberration brings blazing wildfires and boiling waters, for Fire’s mandate in excess causes wild waters to seethe. This reflects Fire’s excess.

Yet this is not so. If *wu-yin*, *wu-shen*, *wu-zi*, and *wu-wu* all correspond to Heat transformation and govern excess, why is this not the case for *wu-xu* and *wu-chen*? Because Greater Yang Water governs Heaven, they do not correspond. Their afflictions of Heat oppression also do not correspond.
**Lesser Zhi** is the note of Fire. In *wu-chen* and *wu-xu* years, *wu* governs Fire, and *chen-xu* are Yang years—Yang years should be excessive, yet here it is *Lesser Zhi* because the Controller of Heaven’s Water restrains it, hence *Lesser Zhi*.
**Lesser Gong** arises when *wu-chen* generates *ji-si* and *wu-xu* generates *ji-hai*. *Ji* governs Earth, and *ji-hai* is a Yin year of insufficiency, hence *Lesser Gong*. *Gong* is the note of Earth, marking the nurturing of the second element.
**Greater Shang** arises when *ji-si* generates *geng-wu* and *ji-hai* generates *geng-zi*. *Geng* governs Metal, hence *Shang*. *Zi* and *wu* are Yang years of excess, hence *Greater Shang*. *Shang* is the note of Metal, marking the nurturing of the third element.
**Lesser Yu** concludes, for *yu* governs Water as the terminal phase. This occurs when *geng-zi* generates *xin-chou* and *geng-wu* generates *xin-wei*. *Xin* governs Water, and *chou-wei* are Yin years of insufficiency, hence *Lesser Yu*. *Yu* is the note of Water, marking the nurturing of the fourth element.
**Greater Jiao** always begins with Wood as the initial qi. This occurs when *xin-chou* generates *ren-yin* and *xin-wei* generates *ren-shen*. *Ren* governs Wood, hence *Jiao*. *Yin* and *shen* are Yang years of excess, hence *Greater Jiao*. *Jiao* is the note of Wood, marking the nurturing of the fifth element.
**Lesser Zhi** arises when *ren-yin* generates *gui-mao* and *ren-shen* generates *gui-you*. *Gui* governs Fire, hence *Zhi*. *Mao* and *you* are Yin years of insufficiency, hence *Lesser Zhi*. *Zhi* is the note of Fire. The previous cycle began with *wu*, and now the sixth element reveals *gui* and *wu*—*gui* and *wu* stems harmonize with Fire, hence the term "cyclical return."

Greater Yang governs Heaven, and the third movement is *Greater Shang*, hence the third position.
**Greater Gong** corresponds to the central Earth movement. *Gong* is the note of Earth. Greater Yin descends to appear as Greater Yang at the spring.
*A-jia-chen* and *jia-xu* are both *sui-hui* years, with *xu* governing the proper transformation and *chen* the oppositional transformation. Their movements coincide with the Earth of the spring, hence the name "same-year convergence." Its movement is the transformation of Yin mist, for

In *chen* and *xu* Yang years, Yang years govern excess, hence *Greater Gong* serves as the primal head. *Lesser Shang* arises when *jia-chen* generates *yi-si*, and *jia-xu* generates *yi-hai*. *Yi* governs the Metal movement, and *Shang* is the note of Metal. *Ji-hai* is a Yin year, and Yin years are insufficient, hence *Lesser Shang*. This is the second cycle of generative succession.

*Greater Yu* concludes when *yi-si* generates *bing-wu*, and *yi-hai* generates *bing-zi*. *Bing* governs the Water movement, and *Yu* is the note of Water. *Zi* and *wu* are Yang years, and Yang years govern excess, hence *Greater Yu*. This is the third cycle of generative succession.

*Greater Jue* initiates when *bing-wu* generates *ding-wei*, and *bing-zi* generates *ding-chou*. *Ding* governs the Wood movement, and *Jue* is the note of Wood. *Chou* and *wei* are Yin years and should be insufficient, yet why is this *Greater Jue*? *Ding* originally resides in *wei*, and here it aligns with the direct correspondence of the celestial stems, hence *Greater Jue*. Thus, *ding-wei* is *Greater Jue*, and *ding-chou* is *Lesser Jue*, giving rise to two interpretations. This is the fourth cycle of generative succession.

*Greater Zhi* arises when *ding-wei* generates *wu-shen*, and *ding-chou* generates *wu-yin*. *Wu* governs the Fire movement, and *Zhi* is the note of Fire. *Yin* and *shen* are Yang years governing excess, hence *Greater Zhi*. This is the fifth cycle of generative succession.

*Lesser Gong* emerges when *wu-yin* generates *ji-mao*, and *wu-shen* generates *ji-you*. *Ji* governs the Earth movement, and *Gong* is the note of Earth. Here, it returns to *jia*, and *jia* and *ji* harmonize, completing the six cycles and beginning anew. Greater Yang governs Heaven, and this is a Metal movement with Greater Yang, hence the fourth position. *Greater Shang* corresponds to the central Metal movement. Greater Yin descends to appear as Greater Yin at the spring.

*Geng-chen* and *geng-xu* years: *chen* governs oppositional transformation, and *xu* governs proper transformation. Their movement aligns with the Metal of the spring, hence its nature is that of frozen Metal. Its transformation manifests as mist and dew, with Metal’s qi dispersing amidst white haze—fog arises on ridges, dew forms, trees wither, and the Metal wind howls. Its mutation brings stern desiccation, with leaves falling before they yellow, governed by the Metal’s desiccating force. Its affliction is dryness: back pain, chest fullness, and Metal’s excess injuring the lungs, eventually reaching the liver, causing chest fullness and rib-side oppression. *Greater Shang* is the note of Metal. *Geng* governs the Metal movement in *geng-chen* and *geng-xu*, Yang years of *chen* and *xu*, hence *Greater Shang*.

*Lesser Yu* concludes when *geng-chen* generates *xin-si*, and *geng-xu* generates *xin-hai*. *Xin* governs the Water movement, and *Yu* is the note of Water. *Ji-hai* is a Yin year of insufficiency, hence *Lesser Yu*. This is the second cycle of generative succession.

*Lesser Jue* arises when *xin-si* generates *ren-wu*, and *xin-hai* generates *ren-zi*. *Ren* governs the Wood movement, and *Jue* is the note of Wood. *Zi* and *wu* are Yang years and should govern excess, yet why is this *Lesser Jue*? Here, *wu* is Fire, and Wood is weakened by Fire, hence *Lesser Jue*. Thus, *ren-wu* is *Lesser Jue*, and *ren-zi* is *Greater Jue*, giving rise to two interpretations. This is the third cycle of generative succession.

*Greater Zhi* emerges when *ren-wu* generates *gui-wei*, and *ren-zi* generates *gui-chou*. *Gui* governs the Fire movement, and *Zhi* is the note of Fire. *Chou* and *wei* are Yin years and should be insufficient, yet why is this *Greater Zhi*? *Gui* originally resides in *chou*, named the stem-branch direct correspondence, hence *gui-chou* is *Greater Zhi*, and *gui-wei* is *Lesser Zhi*. This is the fourth cycle of generative succession.

*Lesser Gong* arises when *gui-wei* generates *jia-shen*, and *gui-chou* generates *jia-yin*. *Jia* governs the Earth movement, and *Gong* is the note of Earth. *Yin* and *shen* are Yang years and should govern excess, yet why is this *Lesser Gong*? Here, *shen* is Metal, named the branch-punishing stem deficiency, as *jia* fears *shen*, hence *Lesser Gong*. Thus, *jia-shen* is *Lesser Gong*, and *jia-yin* is *Greater Gong*, giving rise to two interpretations. This is the fifth cycle of generative succession.

*Lesser Shang* emerges when *jia-shen* generates *yi-you*, and *jia-yin* generates *yi-mao*. *Yi* governs the Metal movement, and *Shang* is the note of Metal. *Mao* and *you* are Yin years, hence *Lesser Shang*. This is the sixth cycle, beginning with *geng* and ending with *yi*, where *yi* and *geng* harmonize in *Shang*, named "cyclical return." Greater Yang governs Heaven, and this is a Water movement with Greater Yang, hence the fifth position. *Greater Yu* corresponds to the central Water movement. Greater Yin descends to appear as Greater Yin at the spring.

*Bing-chen* and *bing-xu* years: *chen* governs oppositional transformation, and *xu* governs proper transformation. Their movement aligns with the Water’s cold mandate, hence the nature of cold transformation. Its transformation brings congealing severity and biting cold, as the governing Heaven’s Water and the central Water movement combine, hence their mutual intensification. Its mutation brings ice, snow, frost, and hail, as the two Waters merge, easily reversing to cold from warmth, producing hail’s destructive force. Winter’s governance is stern and congealing, with great snow spreading transformation. Its affliction is great retention in the stream-valleys, disease in the kidneys, eventually reaching the heart, with blood stagnating below. One may needle the stream-valley points. *Greater Yu* concludes this Water movement, *bing* governing Water, and *Yu* the note of Water. *Chen* and *xu* are Yang years of excess, hence *Greater Yu*.

*Greater Jue* initiates when *bing-chen* generates *ding-si*, and *bing-xu* generates *ding-hai*. *Ding* governs the Wood movement, and *Jue* is the note of Wood. *Ji-hai* is a Yin year and should be *Lesser Jue*, yet why is this *Greater Jue*? Here, *ji-hai* is the year when Greater Yin governs Heaven, and *ding* aligns with the celestial tally, hence *Greater Jue*. This is the second cycle of generative succession.

*Greater Zhi* emerges when *ding-si* generates *wu-wu*, and *ding-hai* generates *wu-zi*. *Wu* governs the Fire movement, and *Zhi* is the note of Fire. *Zi* and *wu* are Yang years of excess, hence *Greater Zhi*. This is the third cycle of generative succession.

*Greater Gong* arises when *wu-zi* generates *ji-chou*, and *wu-wu* generates *ji-wei*. *Ji* governs the Earth movement, and *Gong* is the note of Earth. *Chou* and *wei* are Yin years and should be insufficient, yet why is this *Greater Gong*? *Ji* originally resides in *wei*, aligning with the stem-branch direct correspondence, hence *Greater Gong*. Thus, *ji-wei* is *Greater Gong*, and *ji-chou* is *Lesser Gong*, giving rise to two interpretations. This is the fourth cycle.

*Lesser Shang* emerges when *ji-chou* generates *geng-yin*, and *ji-wei* generates *geng-shen*. *Geng* governs the Metal movement, and *Shang* is the note of Metal. *Yin* and *shen* are Yang years and should govern excess, yet why is this *Lesser Shang*? Here, *yin* and *shen* are governed by Ministerial Fire, which restrains it, named "celestial punishment." This is the fifth cycle of generative succession.

*Lesser Yu* arises when *geng-shen* generates *xin-you*, and *geng-yin* generates *xin-mao*.

"Xin governs the Water movement, and *Yu* is the note of Water. Here, *xin* meets *bing*, and the subsequent Water movement marks the sixth cycle’s return to completion.

The Emperor said: 'I wish to understand the governance of *Yangming*.'
Qibo replied: 'This pertains to the *mao-you* cycle. *Yangming* presides over Heaven, and with the Water movement in *Yangming*, it is thus designated the first.

*Lesser Jue* appears with the Wood movement in the center. *Shaoyin* is seen below as the *Shaoyin* in the Springs. Cold and heat alternate in victory and restoration, corresponding to Wood’s insufficiency. Disaster strikes the third palace: Metal’s clarity overcomes Wood, the victory is extreme, and Fire arrives to restore balance. Metal is overcome by Fire, and Wood is thus pacified—this is termed 'emotional victory,' with heat’s restoration mirroring the initial triumph. *Zhengshang* governs Heaven as *Yangming* Metal. In years with *wei*-restoration, Heaven’s power is not excessive, hence *Zhengshang*.

*Ding-mao* is a *suihui* year, and *ding-wei* is a *yun* year. *Mao* belongs to Wood, and the movement aligns with the year, hence *suihui*. *Ding-you* is a *zhenghua* year, not termed *hui*. Its movements are wind, clarity, and heat: wind is Wood’s transformation; clarity arises when Metal overcomes Wood; heat is Fire’s restoration over Metal—thus three transformations.

*Zhengjue* is the initial *Jue*, the note of Wood, and *ding* governs the Wood movement. *Mao-you* are Yin years, so *Ding-mao* should be *Lesser Jue*, yet as *mao* Wood is a *suihui* year, it should be *Greater Jue*. Here, under Metal’s dominance, it is *Zhengjue*. *Ding-you* is *Lesser Jue*—these are the two interpretations. This marks the cycle’s beginning.

*Lesser Zhi* arises when *ding-mao* generates *wu-chen*, and *ding-you* generates *wu-xu*. *Wu* governs the Fire movement, and *Zhi* is the note of Fire. *Chen* and *xu* are Yang years and should govern excess, yet why is this *Lesser Zhi*? It is because the Heavenly *Yangming* Water overcomes it. This is the second cycle of generative succession.

*Lesser Gong* emerges when *wu-xu* generates *ji-hai*, and *wu-chen* generates *ji-si*. *Ji* governs the Earth movement, and *Gong* is the note of Earth. *Ji-hai* is a Yang year and should govern excess, yet it is *Lesser Gong*. This is the third cycle.

*Greater Shang* arises when *ji-hai* generates *geng-zi*, and *ji-si* generates *geng-wu*. *Geng* governs the Metal movement, and *Shang* is the note of Metal. *Zi* and *wu* are Yang years and should govern excess, yet why is this *Lesser Shang*? It is because *Shaoyin* Sovereign Fire presides over Heaven in these *zi-wu* years, and Heavenly Fire overcomes it—termed 'celestial punishment,' hence *Lesser Shang*. This is the fourth cycle.

*Lesser Yu* concludes when *geng-wu* generates *xin-wei*, and *geng-zi* generates *xin-chou*. *Xin* governs the Water movement, and *Yu* is the note of Water. *Chou* and *wei* are Yin years, and Yin years govern insufficiency, hence *Lesser Yu*. This is the fifth cycle.

*Lesser Jue* begins when *xin-wei* generates *ren-shen*, and *xin-chou* generates *ren-yin*. *Ren* governs the Wood movement, and *Jue* is the note of Wood. *Yin* and *shen* are Yang years and should govern excess, yet why is this *Lesser Jue*? It is because *shen* is governed by Metal overcoming the Wood movement—termed 'celestial punishment.' Here, *shen* is *Lesser* and *yin* is *Greater*—this completes the cyclical explanation.

*Yangming* presides over Heaven, and with the Fire movement in *Yangming*, it is thus designated the second.

*Lesser Zhi* appears with the Fire movement in the center. *Shaoyin* is seen below as the *Shaoyin* in the Springs, harmonizing with the Fire below—this aligns with *suihui*. Cold and rain alternate in victory and restoration, corresponding to Fire’s insufficiency. Disaster strikes the ninth palace: Water’s cold overcomes it, the victory is extreme, and Earth’s rain restores balance. Fire is thus pacified—hence cold and rain alternate in victory and restoration.

*Gui-mao* and *gui-you* are *you*-*zhenghua* years, with *mao* as the opposing transformation. Its movements are heat, cold, and rain: heat is Fire’s inherent transformation; cold arises when Water overcomes it; rain is Earth’s restoration over Water—thus three transformations.

*Zhengzhi* in *gui-mao* and *gui-you* governs the Fire movement, and *Zhi* is the note of Fire. *Mao-you* are Yin years and should be *Lesser Zhi*, yet here it is *Zhengzhi* because the Earthly *Shaoyin* Fire aligns with it. This marks the cycle’s beginning.

*Greater Gong* arises when *gui-mao* generates *jia-chen*, and *gui-you* generates *jia-xu*. *Jia* governs the Earth movement, and *Gong* is the note of Earth. *Chen* and *xu* are Yang years, and Yang years govern excess, hence *Greater Gong*. This is the second cycle.

*Lesser Shang* emerges when *jia-chen* generates *yi-si*, and *jia-xu* generates *yi-hai*. *Yi* governs the Metal movement, and *Shang* is the note of Metal. *Si* and *hai* are Yin years, hence *Lesser Shang*. This is the third cycle.

*Greater Yu* concludes when *yi-si* generates *bing-wu*, and *yi-hai* generates *bing-zi*. *Bing* governs the Water movement, and *Yu* is the note of Water. *Zi* and *wu* are Yang years, hence *Greater Yu*. This is the fourth cycle.

*Greater Jue* begins when *bing-wu* generates *ding-wei*, and *bing-zi* generates *ding-chou*. *Ding* governs the Wood movement, and *Jue* is the note of Wood. *Chou* and *wei* are Yin years and should be *Lesser Jue*, yet why is this *Greater Jue*? It is because *ding* originally resides in *wei*, aligning with the stem-branch direct correspondence, hence *Greater Jue*. Here, *wei* is *Greater* and *chou* is *Lesser*—these are the two interpretations. This is the fifth cycle.

*Greater Zhi* arises when *ding-wei* generates *wu-shen*, and *ding-chou* generates *wu-yin*. Previously, *gui* met *wu*, and *wu-gui* aligns with Fire—this movement completes the cycle. This marks the sixth return to the beginning.

*Yangming* presides over Heaven, and with the Earth movement in *Yangming*, it is thus designated the third.

*Lesser Gong* appears with the Earth movement in the center. *Shaoyin* is seen below as the *Shaoyin* in the Springs. Wind and frost alternate in victory and restoration, corresponding to Earth’s insufficiency. Disaster strikes the fifth palace: Wood’s wind overcomes it, the victory is extreme, and Metal’s frost restores balance. Wind is overcome by frost, and Earth is thus pacified—hence wind and frost alternate in victory and restoration.

*Ji-mao* and *ji-you* are *you*-*zhenghua* years, with *mao* as the opposing transformation. Its movements are rain, wind, and frost: rain is Earth’s inherent transformation; wind arises when Wood overcomes Earth; frost is Metal’s restoration over Wood—thus three transformations.

*Lesser Gong* in *ji-mao* and *ji-you* governs the Earth movement, and *Gong* is the note of Earth. This marks the cycle’s beginning.

*Greater Shang* arises when *ji-mao* generates *geng-chen*, and *ji-you* generates *geng-xu*. *Geng* governs the Metal movement, and *Shang* is the note of Metal. *Chen* and *xu* are Yang years, and Yang years govern excess, hence *Greater Shang*. This is the second cycle.

*Lesser Yu* concludes when *geng-xu* generates *xin-hai*, and *geng-chen* generates *xin-si*. *Xin* governs the Water movement, and *Yu* is the note of Water. *Si* and *hai* are Yin years and govern insufficiency, hence *Lesser Yu*."

This marks the third cycle of generation. *Lesser Jue* begins when *xin-si* generates *ren-wu*, and *xin-hai* generates *ren-zi*. *Ren* governs the Wood movement, and *Jue* is the note of Wood. *Zi* and *wu* are Yang years, which should govern excess, hence *Greater Jue*; yet here it is *Lesser Jue* because *wu* belongs to Fire, and Wood is weakened when encountering Fire—thus *Lesser Jue* in *zi* and *Greater Jue* in *wu*. This is the fourth cycle of generation.

*Greater Zhi* arises when *ren-wu* generates *gui-wei*, and *ren-zi* generates *gui-chou*. *Gui* governs the Fire movement, and *Zhi* is the note of Fire. *Chou* and *wei* are Yin years, which should govern insufficiency, hence *Lesser Zhi*; yet here it is *Greater Zhi* because *gui* originally resides in *chou*, forming a stem-branch conjunction with the direct tally—thus *Greater Zhi* in *chou* and *Lesser Zhi* in *wei*. This marks the fifth cycle of generation.

*Greater Gong* concludes when *gui-wei* generates *jia-shen*, and *gui-chou* generates *jia-yin*. *Jia* governs the Earth movement, and *Gong* is the note of Earth. Beginning with *ji* and ending with *jia*, *shen* and *si* unite in Earth. This completes the sixth cycle, returning to the beginning.

Yangming governs the heavens, and Metal movement aligns with Yangming—hence the fourth position. *Lesser Shang* is centered in Metal movement. Shaoyin governs the earth below as the lesser Yin in the spring, where Earth overcomes Metal movement. Heat and cold alternate in victory and restoration, for Metal is insufficient: disaster befalls the seventh palace. Fire enacts the heat mandate to overcome it, reaching extreme excess; Metal has its child, Water, which enacts the cold mandate to restore balance. Fire and Metal thus achieve harmony—hence the name "heat and cold alternate in victory and restoration."

*Yi-mao* and *yi-you* are years of the Grand Celestial Tally, where *yi* originally resides in *mao*—hence the name "year tally." The Grand Celestial Tally arises from a triple conjunction: above, Yangming Metal governs the heavens; in the middle, Metal movement prevails; below, *you* belongs to Metal. The three Metals unite—thus named the Grand Celestial Tally. Its movements—frost, heat, cold, and cool—are Metal’s inherent transformations. In this triple conjunction, Metal, though inherently lesser, should govern excess; thus the two transformations of heat and cold do not manifest, and victory and restoration do not arise.

*Greater Shang* in *yi-mao* and *yi-you*: *yi* governs the Metal movement, and *Shang* is the note of Metal. *Mao* and *you* are Yin years, which should govern insufficiency, hence *Lesser Shang*; yet here it is *Greater Shang* due to the Grand Celestial Tally’s triple conjunction. This marks the beginning of the cycle.

*Greater Yu* concludes when *yi-mao* generates *bing-chen*, and *yi-you* generates *bing-xu*. *Bing* governs the Water movement, and *Yu* is the note of Water. *Chen* and *xu* are Yang years, governing excess—hence *Greater Yu*. This is the second cycle of generation.

*Greater Jue* begins when *bing-chen* generates *ding-si*, and *bing-xu* generates *ding-hai*. *Ding* governs the Wood movement, and *Jue* is the note of Wood. *Si* and *hai* are Yin years, which should govern insufficiency, hence *Lesser Jue*; yet here it is *Greater Jue* because Jueyin Wood governs the heavens in *si-hai*, aligning the movement with the celestial tally. This marks the third cycle of generation.

*Greater Gong* arises when *wu-wu* generates *ji-wei*, and *wu-zi* generates *ji-chou*. *Ji* governs the Earth movement, and *Gong* is the note of Earth. *Chou* and *wei* are Yin years, which should govern insufficiency, hence *Lesser Gong*; yet here it is *Greater Gong* because *ji* originally resides in *wei*, forming a stem-branch conjunction with the direct tally—thus *Greater Gong* in *wei* and *Lesser Gong* in *chou*. This marks the fifth cycle of generation.

*Greater Shang* concludes when *ji-wei* generates *geng-shen*, and *ji-chou* generates *geng-yin*. *Geng* governs the Metal movement, beginning with *yi* and ending with *geng*—*geng* and *yi* unite in Metal movement. This completes the sixth cycle, returning to the beginning.

[The fourth cycle is absent.]

Yangming governs the heavens, and Water movement aligns with Yangming—hence the fifth position. *Lesser Yu* is centered in Water movement. Shaoyin governs the earth below as the lesser Yin in the spring, where Water movement overcomes Earth Fire. Rain and wind alternate in victory and restoration, for Water is insufficient: disaster befalls the first palace. Earth enacts the rain mandate to overcome it, reaching extreme excess; Water has its child, Wood, which enacts the wind mandate to restore balance. Wind overcomes rain, and Water achieves harmony—hence the name "rain and wind alternate in victory and restoration."

*Xin-mao* and *xin-you* govern the right transformation in *you* and the opposing transformation in *mao*. Their movements—cold, rain, and wind—are Water’s inherent transformations; rain arises when Earth overcomes Water, and wind arises when Wood restores victory over Earth—thus three transformations govern the mandate. *Lesser Yu* concludes in *xin-mao* and *xin-you*: *xin* governs the Water movement, and *Yu* is the note of Water. *Mao* and *you* are Yin years, governing insufficiency—hence *Lesser Yu*. This marks the beginning of the cycle.

*Greater Jue* begins when *xin-mao* generates *ren-chen*, and *xin-you* generates *ren-xu*. *Ren* governs the Wood movement, and *Jue* is the note of Wood. *Chen* and *xu* are Yang years—hence *Greater Jue*. This is the second cycle of generation.

*Greater Zhi* arises when *ren-chen* generates *gui-si*, and *ren-xu* generates *gui-hai*. *Gui* governs the Fire movement, and *Zhi* is the note of Fire. *Si* and *hai* are Yin years, which should govern insufficiency, hence *Lesser Zhi*; yet here it is *Greater Zhi* because the Fire year-branch assists it—thus *Greater Zhi* in *gui-si* and *Lesser Zhi* in *gui-hai*, as both interpretations apply. This marks the third cycle of generation.

*Greater Gong* arises when *gui-si* generates *jia-wu*, and *gui-hai* generates *jia-zi*. *Jia* governs the Earth movement, and *Gong* is the note of Earth. *Zi* and *wu* are Yang years—hence *Greater Gong*. This marks the fourth cycle of generation.

*Greater Shang* concludes when *jia-wu* generates *yi-wei*, and *jia-zi* generates *yi-chou*. *Yi* governs the Metal movement, and *Shang* is the note of Metal. *Chou* and *wei* are Yin years, which should govern insufficiency, hence *Lesser Shang*; yet here it is *Greater Shang* because *chou* and *wei* belong to Earth, which generates Metal, reinforcing it. This marks the fifth cycle of generation.

*Greater Yu* concludes when *yi-wei* generates *bing-shen*, and *yi-chou* generates *bing-yin*. *Bing* governs the Water movement, beginning with *xin* and ending with *bing*—*bing* and *xin* unite in the primordial *Yu* of Water. This completes the sixth cycle, returning to the beginning.

The Yellow Emperor said: "Excellent. What of the governance of Shaoyang?"

Qibo replied: "It pertains to the *yin* and *shen* cycles. Shaoyang governs the heavens, and Wood movement aligns with Shaoyang—hence the first position. *Greater Jue* is centered in Wood movement. Jueyin governs the earth below as the lesser Yin in the spring. Movement and Wood unite in a year tally.

*Ren-yin* and *ren-shen* govern the right transformation in *yin* and the opposing transformation in *shen*. Their movement is the drumming of wind, as Wood movement enacts the wind mandate. Its transformations are the resounding of wind, the purity of spring, the splitting of the earth, and the unfolding of buds—wind’s drumming scatters purity, opens the earth, splits flowers, and awakens spring’s unfolding."

Its transformations are the shaking, uprooting, and snapping of trees in furious winds—thus wind injures Wood, causing collapse and ruin. Its afflictions are dizziness, vertigo, limb distension, rib-side tension, and fright—excess injures the liver, and prolonged harm extends to the spleen.

*Greater Jue* begins with *ren-yin* and *ren-shen*. *Ren* governs Wood movement, and *Jue* is the Wood tone. *Yin* and *shen* are Yang years, hence *Greater Jue*—the primal origin.

*Lesser Zhi* arises when *ren-yin* generates *gui-mao* and *ren-shen* generates *gui-you*. *Gui* governs Fire movement, and *Zhi* is the Fire tone. *Mao* and *you* are Yin years, thus deficient, hence *Lesser Zhi*. This is the second phase of generative assistance.

*Greater Gong* arises when *gui-mao* generates *jia-chen* and *gui-you* generates *jia-xu*. *Jia* governs Earth movement, and *Gong* is the Earth tone. *Chen* and *xu* are Yang years, thus excessive, hence *Greater Gong*. This is the third phase of generative assistance.

*Lesser Shang* arises when *jia-chen* generates *yi-si* and *jia-xu* generates *yi-hai*. *Yi* governs Metal movement, and *Shang* is the Metal tone. *Si* and *hai* are Yin years, thus deficient, hence *Lesser Shang*. This is the fourth phase of generative assistance.

*Greater Yu* concludes when *yi-si* generates *bing-wu* and *yi-hai* generates *bing-zi*. *Bing* governs Water movement, and *Yu* is the Water tone. *Wu* and *zi* are Yang years, thus excessive, hence *Greater Yu*. This is the fifth phase.

*Lesser Jue* begins when *bing-wu* generates *ding-wei* and *bing-zi* generates *ding-chou*. *Ding* governs Wood movement, and *Jue* is the Wood tone. *Ren* at the origin and *ding* at the end unite in Wood movement. This is the sixth phase, completing the cycle and returning to the beginning.

Shaoyang governs the heavens, and Fire movement aligns with Shaoyang—hence the second position. *Greater Zhi* is centered in Fire movement, above harmonizing with heaven. Jueyin governs the earth below as the lesser Yin, with Wood and wind in the spring.

*Wu-yin* and *wu-shen* are celestial correspondences, where correspondence means union. Above, lesser Yang Fire governs heaven; within, *wu* governs Fire movement—above and within unite in virtue. Its movement is summerheat and Fire, its transformation summerheat. Its transformations are warmth, clamor, oppression, and scorching—ministerial Fire transforms in accord with the two qi. Thus all things flourish in warmth and clamor.

Its excesses are blazing fury and seething overflow—fire scorches flowing metal, and wild marshes boil like broth. Its afflictions are upper-body heat and oppression, blood spillage and hemorrhage, heart pain—excess Fire injures the heart, and prolonged harm extends to the lungs. When Fire governs heaven, heat afflictions arise above. Blood spillage is vomiting blood or nosebleed; hemorrhage is bloody stool or rectal bleeding. Heart pain is fullness and pain in the heart.

*Greater Zhi* corresponds to *wu-yin* and *wu-shen*. *Wu* governs Fire movement, and *Zhi* is the Fire tone.

In *yin* and *shen* yang years, excess prevails, hence *Greater Zhi*. This marks the Primordial Origin. *Lesser Gong* arises when *wu-yin* gives birth to *ji-mao*, and *wu-shen* gives birth to *ji-you*. *Ji* governs the Earth phase, and *Gong* is the Earth tone. In *mao* and *you* yin years, it is *Lesser Gong*. This is the Second Origin.

*Greater Shang* arises when *ji-mao* gives birth to *geng-chen*, and *ji-you* gives birth to *geng-xu*. *Geng* governs the Metal phase, and *Shang* is the Metal tone. In *chen* and *xu* yang years, excess prevails, hence *Greater Shang*. This is the Third Origin of Nourishment.

*Lesser Yu* concludes when *geng-chen* gives birth to *xin-si*, and *geng-xu* gives birth to *xin-hai*. *Xin* governs the Water phase, and *Yu* is the Water tone. In *si* and *hai* yin years, deficiency prevails, hence *Lesser Yu*. This is the Fourth Origin of Nourishment.

*Lesser Jue* initiates when *xin-si* gives birth to *ren-wu*, and *xin-hai* gives birth to *ren-zi*. *Ren* governs the Wood phase, and *Jue* is the Wood tone. In *zi* and *wu* yang years, excess should yield *Greater Jue*, yet here it is *Lesser Jue*—why? *Wu* is Fire, and Wood encounters Fire in weakness, thus *ren-wu* is *Lesser Jue*, while *ren-zi* is *Greater Jue*, giving rise to these two interpretations. This is the Fifth Origin of Nourishment.

*Greater Zhi* arises when *ren-wu* gives birth to *gui-wei*, and *ren-zi* gives birth to *gui-chou*. *Gui* originally resides in *chou*, but when the heavenly stem aligns with the direct agent, it becomes *Greater Zhi*. Thus, from the head *wu* to the tail *gui*, *wu* and *gui* unite in the Fire phase—this completes the cycle of the Primordial Origin.

*Lesser Yang* governs heaven, and Earth phase prevails as *Lesser Yang*, hence this is the Second [cycle]. *Greater Gong* appears as the central Earth phase. *Jueyin* Wood is in the spring below, and Earth is overcome by the phase of the land.

In *jia-yin* and *jia-shen* years, *yin* governs direct transformation, while *shen* governs oppositional transformation. Its phase is yin rain, and the Earth phase enacts the rain mandate to transform. Its transformations are softness, moisture, and heavy marsh—*ji* transforms into dampness, and the seasonal mandate is damp-heat. Thus, when all things are overly soft and moist, prolonged rain and deep yin are called "heavy marsh."

Its excesses are trembling, fright, whirlwinds, and sudden fury—manifesting as sudden collapse and unceasing diarrhea, termed "excessive transformation." Its afflictions are heavy body, edema, glomus, and phlegm-rheum. Excess leads to spleen disorders, and prolonged harm extends to the kidneys.

*Greater Gong* corresponds to *jia-yin* and *jia-shen*. *Jia* governs the Earth phase, and *Gong* is the Earth tone.

In *yin* and *shen* yang years, as yang years are excessive, they correspond to *Greater Gong*. This is the first *yuan*. *Greater Shang* arises from *jia-yin* generating *yi-mao*, and *jia-shen* generating *yi-you*. *Yi* governs the Metal phase, and *Shang* is the Metal tone. *Mao* and *you* are yin years of insufficiency, which should correspond to *Lesser Shang*; why then is it *Greater Shang*? This is because *Yangming* Metal appears above, and the phase aligns with the celestial tally. This is the second *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Greater Yu* concludes with *yi-mao* generating *bing-chen*, and *yi-you* generating *bing-xu*. *Bing* governs the Water phase, and *Yu* is the Water tone. *Chen* and *xu* are yang years of excess, hence *Greater Yu*. This is the third *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Greater Jue* arises from *bing-chen* generating *ding-si*, and *bing-xu* generating *ding-hai*. *Ding* governs the Wood phase, and *Jue* is the Wood tone. *Si* and *hai* are yin years, which should correspond to *Lesser Jue*; why then is it *Greater Jue*? This is because the Earth phase encounters *Jueyin* Wood as the celestial controller, aligning with Wood. This is the fourth *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Greater Zhi* arises from *ding-si* generating *wu-wu*, and *ding-hai* generating *wu-zi*. *Wu* governs the Fire phase, and *Zhi* is the Fire tone. *Zi* and *wu* are yang years, inherently excessive, hence *Greater Zhi*. This is the fifth *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Lesser Gong* arises from *wu-zi* generating *ji-chou*, and *wu-wu* generating *ji-wei*. Beginning with *jia* and ending with *ji*, it completes the Earth phase. This is the sixth *yuan*, returning full circle to the beginning.

*Shaoyang* governs the heavens, and as Metal phase meets *Shaoyang*, it is designated the fourth. *Greater Shang* corresponds to the Metal phase. Below, *Jueyin* Wood resides in the springs, where Metal phase overcomes Earth’s Wood. *Geng-yin* and *geng-shen* enact direct transformation in *yin*, and oppositional transformation in *shen*. Its phase is frozen Metal, and the Metal phase enacts the freezing mandate to transform. Its transformations are mist, dew, and crystalline clarity—Metal in excess stirs white dust on all sides, transforming into mist and dew. *Crystalline clarity* reflects Metal’s pure and resonant nature.

Its excesses are stern desiccation and withering decay—excesses that deviate from the norm. Metal’s wrath manifests as white *qi* transforming into killing force, causing grasses and trees to wither prematurely, not awaiting their yellowing. Its afflictions are the shoulders, back, and chest; excess harms the lungs, and prolonged harm extends to the liver.

*Lesser Shang* corresponds to *geng-yin* and *geng-shen*. *Geng* governs the Metal phase, and *Shang* is the Metal tone.

In *yin* and *shen* yang years, they should correspond to *Tai Shang*, yet they instead manifest as *Shao Shang*—why is this? It is because *Shao Yang* ministerial fire presides over heaven above, and heavenly fire restrains them, hence the name *heavenly punishment*. Thus, under *Shao Shang*, all transformative mandates from *si* onward do not align.

*Shao Yu* concludes with *geng-yin* generating *xin-mao*, and *geng-shen* generating *xin-you*. *Xin* governs the water phase, and *Yu* is the water tone. *Mao* and *you* are yin years of insufficiency, hence *Shao Yu*. This is the second *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Tai Jue* begins with *xin-mao* generating *ren-chen*, and *xin-you* generating *ren-xu*. *Ren* governs the wood phase, and *Jue* is the wood tone. *Chen* and *xu* are yang years of excess, hence *Tai Jue*. This is the third *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Tai Zhi* follows with *ren-chen* generating *gui-si*, and *ren-xu* generating *gui-hai*. *Gui* governs the fire phase, and *Zhi* is the fire tone. *Si* and *hai* are yin years, which should be insufficient and thus *Shao Zhi*—yet they manifest as *Tai Zhi*. Why? Because *si* is fire, and here it aligns with the yearly branch, hence *Tai Zhi*. Thus, *si* is *Tai* while *hai* is *Shao*—these are the two explanations. This is the fourth *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Tai Gong* follows with *gui-si* generating *jia-wu*, and *gui-hai* generating *jia-zi*. *Jia* governs the earth phase, and *Gong* is the earth tone. *Zi* and *wu* are yang years, hence *Tai Gong*. This is the fifth *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Shao Shang* follows with *jia-wu* generating *yi-wei*, and *jia-zi* generating *yi-chou*. *Yi* governs the Metal phase, and *Shang* is the Metal tone. Here, *geng* begins and *yi* concludes—*yi* meets *geng* to harmonize its Metal, thus *Shang* returns and restores. As *Shao Yang* presides over heaven, water returns to *Shao Yang*, hence the fifth position.

*Tai Yu* is centered in the water phase. *Jue Yin* is below, with *Jue Yin* wood in the spring source. *Bing-yin* and *bing-shen* enact the primary transformation in *yin*, and the oppositional transformation in *shen*. Its phase is frigid severity, and the water phase enacts the mandate of frigid severity. Its transformations are congealing desolation and biting cold—water in excess enacts these transformations. *Congealing* refers to ice and frost; *desolation*, to deep yin; *biting cold*, to extreme cold. Here, the water phase overcomes heavenly fire.

Its deviations are ice, snow, frost, and hail—deviations that exceed normal *qi*. Its virtues manifest as freezing and spreading transformations, while its killing force brings frost, snow, and hail prematurely, not awaiting winter. Its afflictions are cold-induced edema, rooted in the kidneys, and prolonged harm extends to the heart.

*Tai Yu* concludes with *bing-yin* and *bing-shen*. *Bing* governs the water phase, and *Yu* is the water tone. *Yin* and *shen* are yang years, hence *Tai Yu*. This is the *yuan* origin.

*Tai Jue* begins with *bing-yin* generating *ding-mao*, and *bing-shen* generating *ding-you*. *Ding* governs the wood phase, and *Jue* is the wood tone. *Mao* and *you* are yin years of insufficiency, which should be *Shao Jue*—yet they manifest as *Tai Jue*. This is because *mao* is the yearly convergence of wood, hence *mao* is *Tai* while *you* is *Shao*. This is the second *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Tai Zhi* follows with *ding-mao* generating *wu-chen*, and *ding-you* generating *wu-xu*. *Wu* governs the fire phase, and *Zhi* is the fire tone. *Chen* and *xu* are yang years of excess, hence *Tai Zhi*. This is the third *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Tai Gong* follows with *wu-chen* generating *ji-si*, and *wu-xu* generating *ji-hai*. *Ji* governs the earth phase, and *Gong* is the earth tone. *Si* and *hai* are yin years of insufficiency, which should be *Shao Gong*—yet they manifest as *Tai Gong*. This is because *si* is the earthly gate of *si*. This is the fourth *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Shao Shang* follows with *ji-si* generating *geng-wu*, and *ji-hai* generating *geng-zi*. *Geng* governs the Metal phase, and *Shang* is the Metal tone. *Zi* and *wu* are yang years of excess, yet they manifest as *Shao Shang*—why? Because *wu* is fire, and *Shao Yin* presides over heaven, where fire imposes heavenly punishment, hence *Shao Shang*. This is the fifth *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Shao Yu* concludes with *geng-wu* generating *xin-wei*, and *geng-zi* generating *xin-chou*. *Xin* governs the water phase, and *Yu* is the water tone. *Xin* meets *bing* to harmonize the water phase and *Yu* tone. This completes the sixfold cycle, returning once more to *Yu*.

The Emperor said: Excellent. What of the governance of *Tai Yin*?
Qibo replied: It pertains to the *chou* and *wei* epochs. *Tai Yin* presides over heaven, and the wood phase governs *Tai Yin*, hence the first position.

*Shao Jue* is centered in the wood phase. *Tai Yang* is below, with *Tai Yang* in the spring source. The mutual overcoming of coolness and heat aligns with wood’s insufficiency—disaster befalls the three palaces. Metal enacts the mandate of clarity to overcome it, and the overcoming reaches its extreme. Fire arrives to counter-overcome, and wood is thereby harmonized. Thus, it is named *cool overcoming* and *heat counter-overcoming*.

In years of *Zheng Gong* insufficiency, earth governs heaven, and earth is balanced, hence *Zheng Gong*—all five positions align. *Ding-chou* and *ding-wei* enact the primary transformation in *wei*, and the oppositional transformation in *chou*. Its phase is wind, freezing, and heat—wind is the fundamental transformation of the wood phase. Freezing arises when Metal arrives to enact its overcoming transformation. Heat arises when fire counter-overcomes Metal, hence the three transformations.

*Zheng Jue* begins with *ding-chou* and *ding-wei*. *Ding* governs the wood phase, and *Jue* is the wood tone. *Chou* and *wei* are yin years, which should be insufficient, hence *Shao Jue*. Yet it is called *Zheng Jue* because *ding* originally resides in *wei*, named *stem-branch convergence*, and thus should be *Tai Jue*. As earth presides over heaven above, the wood phase submits to it, and half its *qi* returns to the earth phase—this is also called *Zheng Jue*. Thus, *wei* is *Zheng* while *chou* is *Shao*—these are the two explanations. This is the *yuan* origin.

*Tai Zhi* follows with *ding-chou* generating *wu-yin*, and *ding-wei* generating *wu-shen*. *Wu* governs the fire phase, and *Zhi* is the fire tone. *Yin* and *shen* are yang years of excess, hence *Tai Zhi*. This is the second *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Shao Gong* follows with *wu-yin* generating *ji-mao*, and *wu-shen* generating *ji-you*. *Ji* governs the earth phase, and *Gong* is the earth tone. *Mao* and *you* are yin years of insufficiency, hence *Shao Gong*. This is the third *yuan*.

*Tai Shang* follows with *ji-mao* generating *geng-chen*, and *ji-you* generating *geng-xu*. *Geng* governs the Metal phase, and *Shang* is the Metal tone. *Chen* and *xu* are yang years of excess, hence *Tai Shang*. This is the fourth *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Shao Yu* concludes with *geng-chen* generating *xin-si*, and *geng-xu* generating *xin-hai*. *Xin* governs the water phase, and *Yu* is the water tone.

*Si* and *hai* are yin years of insufficiency, hence *Shao Yu*. This is the fifth *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Shao Jue* begins with *xin-si* generating *ren-wu*, and *xin-hai* generating *ren-zi*. *Ren* governs the Wood phase, and *wu* being fire, Wood meets fire and becomes deficient, hence *Shao Jue*. *Ding* meets *ren*, combining into the Wood phase, completing the cycle and returning to *Jue*. *Tai Yin* governs the heavens, and with the fire phase under *Tai Yin*, this is the second sequence. *Shao Zheng* appears as the fire phase in the middle. *Tai Yang* below reveals *Tai Yang* water as the spring in the earth. Earth-water prevails over the fire phase. Cold and rain alternate in dominance, corresponding to fire’s insufficiency. Disaster strikes the ninth palace: when water’s cold mandate arrives to overcome, the dominance grows extreme, and earth’s rain transformation counteracts it, hence the term "cold and rain alternate in dominance." *Gui-chou* and *gui-wei* govern the proper transformation, with *chou* opposing transformation. Its phases are heat, cold, and rain: heat is the fire phase’s fundamental transformation; cold arises when water’s mandate overcomes fire; rain arises when earth’s mandate counteracts water. Thus, these three transformations operate. *Shao Zheng* in *gui-chou* and *gui-wei*: *gui* governs the fire phase, and *Zheng* is the fire tone. *Chou* and *wei* are yin years, hence *Shao Zheng*. Though *gui* in *chou* aligns with the direct sign, earth’s *Tai Yang* water overcomes it, hence *Shao Zheng*. This is the *yuan*’s inception.

*Tai Gong* follows with *gui-chou* generating *jia-yin*, and *gui-wei* generating *jia-shen*. *Jia* governs the earth phase, and *Gong* is the earth tone. *Yin* and *shen* are yang years of excess, hence *Tai Gong*. This is the second *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Tai Shang* follows with *jia-yin* generating *yi-mao*, and *jia-shen* generating *yi-you*. *Yi* governs the Metal phase, and *Shang* is the Metal tone. *Mao* and *you* are yin years, hence *Shao Shang*, but here it is *Tai Shang* because the heavens reveal *Yang Ming* Metal, combining with the celestial Metal as a *tian fu*, hence *Tai Shang*. This is the third *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Tai Yu* concludes with *yi-mao* generating *bing-chen*, and *yi-you* generating *bing-xu*. *Bing* governs the water phase, and *Yu* is the water tone. *Chen* and *xu* are yang years of excess, hence *Tai Yu*. This is the fourth *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Tai Jue* follows with *bing-chen* generating *ding-si*, and *bing-xu* generating *ding-hai*. *Ding* governs the Wood phase, and *Jue* is the Wood tone. *Si* and *hai* are yin years, hence *Shao Jue*, but here it is *Tai Jue* due to the celestial *tian fu*. This is the fifth *yuan*.

*Tai Zheng* follows with *ding-si* generating *wu-wu*, and *ding-hai* generating *wu-zi*. *Wu* meets *gui*, combining into the fire phase. This is the sixth *yuan*, returning to *Zheng*. *Tai Yin* governs the heavens, and with the earth phase under *Tai Yin*, this is the third sequence. *Shao Gong* appears as the earth phase in the middle. *Tai Yang* below reveals *Tai Yang* water as the spring in the earth, with earth ascending to unite with the heavens, countering the earth below. Wind and clarity alternate in dominance, corresponding to earth’s insufficiency. Disaster strikes the fifth palace: when Wood’s wind transformation arrives to overcome earth, the dominance grows extreme, and Metal’s clarity mandate counteracts Wood, restoring earth’s balance, hence the term "wind and clarity alternate in dominance." "Alternate" signifies Metal’s dominance, echoing the prior dominance. *Ji-chou* is a *Tai Yi Tian Fu*, as is *ji-wei*: *ji* governs the earth phase, *chou* and *wei* are earth years, and *Tai Yin* governs the heavens as earth, with all three converging, hence the name *Tai Yi Tian Fu*. Its phases are rain, wind, and frost: rain is earth’s fundamental mandate; wind arises when Wood overcomes earth; frost arises when Metal overcomes Wood. With the earth phase as a *tian fu*, only earth’s rain transforms independently, while wind and frost do not overcome. *Tai Gong* in *ji-chou* and *ji-wei*: *ji* governs the earth phase, and *Gong* is the earth tone. Aligning with the *tian fu*, hence *Tai Gong*. This is the *yuan*’s inception.

*Shao Shang* follows with *ji-chou* generating *geng-yin*, and *ji-wei* generating *geng-shen*. *Geng* governs the Metal phase, and *Shang* is the Metal tone. *Yin* and *shen* are yang years of excess, hence *Tai Shang*, but here it is *Shao Shang* because *yin* and *shen* reveal *Shao Yang* ministerial fire governing the heavens, termed *tian xing*, hence *Shao Shang*. This is the second *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Shao Yu* concludes with *geng-yin* generating *xin-mao*, and *geng-shen* generating *xin-you*. *Xin* governs the water phase, and *Yu* is the water tone. *Mao* and *you* are yin years of insufficiency, hence *Shao Yu*. This is the third *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Tai Jue* begins with *xin-mao* generating *ren-chen*, and *xin-you* generating *ren-xu*. *Ren* governs the Wood phase, and *Jue* is the Wood tone. *Chen* and *xu* are yang years of excess, hence *Tai Jue*. This is the fourth *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Tai Zheng* follows with *ren-chen* generating *gui-si*, and *ren-xu* generating *gui-hai*. This is the second *yuan*.

*Tai Yin*, *Shao Shang*, *Tai Yang*, governing cold’s dominance and counteraction. *Yi-chou*, *yi-wei*: its phases are frost, heat, and cold.

*Tai Shang*, concluding *Tai Yu*, *Tai Jue*, *Shao Zheng*, *Tai Gong*, *Tai Shang*, *Tai Yin*, *Shao Yu*, *Tai Yang*, governing rain and wind’s alternation in dominance. *Xin-chou* and *xin-wei* govern the proper transformation, with *chou* opposing transformation. Its phases are cold, rain, and wind: cold is the water phase’s fundamental transformation; rain arises when earth overcomes water; wind arises when water counteracts earth. Thus, these three transformations operate. *Tai Yu* concludes in *xin-chou* and *xin-wei*: *xin* governs the water phase, and *Yu* is the water tone. *Chou* and *wei* are yin years, hence *Shao Yu*, but here it is *Tai Yu* because *Tai Yang* resides in the spring, uniting with the earth, hence *Tai Yu*. This is the *yuan*’s inception.

*Shao Jue* begins with *xin-chou* generating *ren-yin*, and *xin-wei* generating *ren-shen*. *Ren* governs the Wood phase, and *Jue* is the Wood tone. *Yin* and *shen* are yang years, but here it is *Shao Jue* because Wood meets fire and becomes deficient, aligning with the celestial fire, hence *Shao Jue*. This is the first *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Tai Zheng* follows with *ren-yin* generating *gui-mao*, and *ren-shen* generating *gui-you*. *Gui* governs the fire phase, and *Zheng* is the fire tone. *Mao* and *you* are yin years, hence *Shao Zheng*, but here it is *Tai Zheng* because *mao* Wood generates fire, and fire prevails. This is the third *yuan*.

*Tai Gong* follows with *gui-mao* generating *jia-chen*, and *gui-you* generating *jia-xu*.

Here the *jia* governs the Earth phase, and *Gong* is the Earth tone. *Chen* and *xu* are yang years of excess, hence *Tai Gong*. This is the fourth *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Shao Shang* follows with *jia-chen* generating *yi-si*, and *jia-xu* generating *yi-hai*. *Yi* governs the Metal phase, and *Shang* is the Metal tone. *Si* and *hai* are yin years of deficiency, hence *Shao Shang*. This is the fifth *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Tai Yu* concludes with *yi-si* generating *bing-wu*, and *yi-hai* generating *bing-zi*. *Bing* marks the end, *xin* the inception, and *bing* the completion of the Water phase. These six *yuan* complete the cycle of *Yu*’s return.

The Emperor said: "Excellent. What of the *Shao Yin*’s governance?"

Qi Bo replied: "This is the *zi-wu* cycle. *Shao Yin* presides over Heaven, and the Wood phase governs *Shao Yin*, hence it is the first. *Tai Jue* appears with the Wood phase at its center. *Yang Ming* is seen below as *Yang Ming* at the Spring. *Ren-zi* and *ren-wu* align with the *wu*’s central transformation, while *zi* corresponds to its opposition. Its *qi* stirs the wind, and the Wood phase enacts the wind’s transformative mandate. Its transformation is the rustling of silken banners, the splitting of buds—Wood receiving the first *qi* and giving rise to the myriad things. Thus, the wind rustles, silken banners flutter, buds split, and sprouts grow. Its aberration is violent uprooting and tearing—excess brings transformation. Wind injures Wood. Its afflictions manifest as distension and fullness; excess harms the liver, and over time, the spleen.

*Tai Jue* begins with *ren-zi* and *ren-wu*. *Ren* governs the Grain phase, and *Jue* is the Wood tone. *Zi* and *wu* are yang years, hence *Tai Jue* marks the inception of the *yuan*.

*Tai Zheng* follows with *ren-wu* generating *gui-wei*, and *ren-zi* generating *gui-chou*. *Gui* governs the Fire phase, and *Zheng* is the Fire tone. *Chou* and *wei* are yin years of deficiency, and should be *Shao Zheng*, but here it is *Tai Zheng* because *gui* in *chou* aligns with the stem-branch conjunction and the direct correspondence of the celestial tally. Thus, *chou* is *Tai* and *wei* is *Shao*, giving rise to two interpretations. This is the second *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Tai Gong* follows with *gui-wei* generating *jia-shen*, and *gui-chou* generating *jia-yin*. *Jia* governs the Earth phase, and *Gong* is the Earth tone. *Yin* and *shen* are yang years of excess, hence *Tai Gong*. This is the third *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Tai Shang* follows with *jia-shen* generating *yi-you*, and *jia-yin* generating *yi-mao*. *Yi* governs the Metal phase, and *Shang* is the Metal tone. *Mao* and *you* are yin years of deficiency, and should be *Shao Shang*, but here it is *Tai Shang* because *Yang Ming* Metal presides over Heaven, enacting the celestial tally. This is the fourth *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Tai Yu* concludes with *yi-mao* generating *bing-chen*, and *yi-you* generating *bing-xu*. *Bing* governs the Water phase, and *Yu* is the Water tone. *Chen* and *xu* are yang years of excess, hence *Tai Yu*. This is the fifth *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Tai Jue* follows with *bing-chen* generating *ding-si*, and *bing-xu* generating *ding-hai*. *Ding* governs the Wood phase, and *Jue* is the Wood tone. *Si* and *hai* are yin years of deficiency, and should be *Shao Jue*, but here it is *Tai Jue* because *Jue Yin* Wood presides over Heaven, and the phase aligns with the celestial tally. This *ding* meets *ren* to complete the cycle. *Shao Yin* presides over Heaven, and the Fire phase governs *Shao Yin*, hence it is the second. *Tai Zheng* appears with the Fire phase at its center. *Yang Ming* is seen below as *Yang Ming* at the Spring. *Wu-zi* is the celestial tally, and *wu-wu* is the grand celestial tally. The tally signifies conjunction. When the phase aligns with Heaven, it is called the celestial tally. When the year converges with the threefold conjunction, it is the grand celestial tally. Its *qi* blazes with scorching heat—excess and surplus align with Heaven, hence the fire *qi* flourishes in transformation, giving rise to scorching heat. Its transformation is radiant brilliance and oppressive heat—the Fire phase in excess manifests as blazing warmth and luminous clarity. Oppressive heat penetrates humanity, afflicting the people. Its aberration is searing conflagration and boiling tumult—transformation deviates from the norm. Scorching heat dominates transformation, and water boils like a seething cauldron. Its afflictions manifest as upper-body heat and blood overflow; excess harms the heart, and over time, the lungs.

*Tai Zheng* begins with *wu-zi* and *wu-wu*. *Wu* governs the Fire phase, and *Zheng* is the Fire tone. Thus, it marks the inception of the first *qi* of the *yuan*.

*Tai Gong* follows with *wu-wu* generating *ji-wei*, and *wu-zi* generating *ji-chou*. *Ji* governs the Earth phase. *Wei* and *chou* are yin years of deficiency, and should be *Shao Gong*, but here it is *Tai Gong* because *ji* in *wei* aligns with the stem-branch conjunction and the direct correspondence of the celestial tally. This is the second *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Shao Shang* follows with *ji-wei* generating *geng-shen*, and *ji-chou* generating *geng-yin*. *Geng* governs the Metal phase, and *Shang* is the Metal tone. *Yin* and *shen* are yang years, and should be *Tai Shang*, but here it is *Shao Shang* because *Geng-shen* aligns with *Shao Yang* Minister Fire presiding over Heaven, enacting the celestial punishment, hence *Shao Shang*. This is the third *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Shao Yu* concludes with *geng-yin* generating *xin-mao*, and *geng-shen* generating *xin-you*. *Xin* governs the Water phase, and *Yu* is the Water tone. *Mao* and *you* are yin years of deficiency, hence *Shao Yu*. This is the fourth *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Tai Jue* begins with *xin-mao* generating *ren-chen*, and *xin-you* generating *ren-xu*. *Ren* governs the Wood phase, and *Jue* is the Wood tone. *Chen* and *xu* are yang years of excess, hence *Tai Jue*. This is the fifth *yuan* of generative assistance.

*Tai Zheng* follows with *ren-chen* generating *gui-si*, and *ren-xu* generating *gui-hai*. *Gui* governs the Fire phase, and *Zheng* is the Fire tone. *Si* and *hai* are yin years of deficiency, and should be *Shao Zheng*, but here it is *Tai Zheng* because *si* aligns with Fire, and the branch harmonizes with the stem’s virtue. Thus, *gui* meets *wu*, and *wu-gui* governs the Fire phase. This is the sixth *yuan*. *Zheng* completes the cycle.

*Shao Yin* presides over Heaven, and the Earth phase governs *Shao Yin*, hence it is the third. *Tai Gong* appears with the Earth phase at its center. *Yang Ming* is seen below as *Yang Ming* at the Spring. *Jia-zi* and *jia-wu* align with the *wu*’s central transformation, while *zi* corresponds to its opposition. Its *qi* brings overcast rain, and the Earth phase enacts the dampness’s transformative mandate, hence overcast rain. Its transformation is gentle moisture and timely rain—the Earth phase softens the heat, and dust settles into dampness. Thus, it is gentle and moist. By the fourth *qi*, great rains fall in season. Its aberration is violent storms and thunderous shocks—transformation deviates from the norm. Excess and surplus bring sudden downpours, thunder, and hail, as Earth prevails in its victory. Its afflictions manifest as abdominal fullness and bodily heaviness; excess harms the spleen, and over time, the kidneys.

**Tai Gong in Jia-zi and Jia-wu years.**
*Jia* governs the Earth phase, corresponding to the *Gong* tone of Earth. *Zi* and *wu* are yang years, hence *Tai Gong* (Great Palace). This is the Primordial Origin.

**Shao Shang in this Jia-zi begets Yi-chou, Jia-wu begets Yi-wei.**
*Yi* governs the Metal phase, corresponding to the *Shang* tone of Metal. *Chou* and *wei* are yin years, deficient, hence *Shao Shang* (Lesser Note). This is the Second Origin of Generation.

**Tai Yu concludes this: Yi-chou begets Bing-yin, Yi-wei begets Bing-shen.**
*Bing* governs the Water phase, corresponding to the *Yu* tone of Water. *Yin* and *shen* are yang years, excessive, hence *Tai Yu* (Great Flourish). This is the Third Origin of Generation.

**Tai Jiao begins this: Bing-yin begets Ding-mao, Bing-shen begets Ding-you.**
*Ding* governs the Wood phase, corresponding to the *Jiao* tone of Wood. *Mao* and *you* are yin years, which should be *Shao Jiao* (Lesser Angle), but here it is *Tai Jiao*—for *mao* belongs to Wood, aligning with the phase in a Yearly Convergence, hence *Tai Jiao*. This is the Fourth Origin of Generation.

**Tai Zhi in this: Ding-mao begets Wu-chen, Ding-you begets Wu-xu.**
*Wu* governs the Fire phase, corresponding to the *Zhi* tone of Fire. *Chen* and *xu* are yang years, hence *Tai Zhi* (Great Governance). This is the Fifth Origin of Generation.

**Tai Gong in this: Wu-chen begets Ji-si, Wu-xu begets Ji-hai.**
*Ji* governs the Earth phase, corresponding to the *Gong* tone of Earth. *Si* and *hai* are yin years, which should be *Shao Gong* (Lesser Palace), but here it is *Tai Gong*—for the sixth *si* is the Earthly Portal, and *Ji* matches *si*, hence *Tai Gong*. *Ji* meets *Jia* to harmonize the Earth phase. This is the Sixth Origin, completing the cycle.

**The Palace returns to its full circuit.**
*Shao Yin* governs Heaven, Metal phase under *Shao Yin*, hence the fourth position. *Tai Shang* (Great Note) appears at the center as the Metal phase. *Yang Ming* is seen below as *Yang Ming* at the Spring. *Geng-zi* and *geng-wu* align with the *wu*’s central transformation, while *zi* corresponds to its opposition. Its *qi* brings freezing vigor, as the Metal phase enacts the clear and bracing transformation. Its manifestation is mist and dew, desolate and stirring—the Metal phase in motion; white haze like mist, Metal winds sighing audibly. Its aberration is stern desolation and withering: when Metal’s wrath arises, transformation deviates into desolation and decay, for Metal’s *qi* prevails, and verdant growth withers. Its afflictions manifest as upper-clearance disorders affecting the lungs, and over time, the liver.

**Shao Shang in Geng-zi and Geng-wu years.**
*Geng* governs the Metal phase, corresponding to the *Shang* tone of Metal. *Zi* and *wu* are yang years, which should be *Tai Shang* (Great Note), but here it is *Shao Shang*—for *Shao Yin* Sovereign Fire governs Heaven, imposing celestial punishment, hence *Shao Shang*. This is the Primordial Origin.

**Shao Yu concludes this: Geng-zi begets Xin-chou, Geng-wu begets Xin-wei.**
*Xin* governs the Water phase, corresponding to the *Yu* tone of Water. *Chou* and *wei* are yin years, deficient, hence *Shao Yu* (Lesser Flourish). This is the Second Origin of Generation.

**Shao Jiao begins this: Xin-chou begets Ren-yin, Xin-wei begets Ren-shen.**
*Ren* governs the Wood phase, corresponding to the *Jiao* tone of Wood. *Yin* and *shen* are yang years, which should be *Tai Jiao* (Great Angle), but here it is *Shao Jiao*—why? *Shao Yang* Ministerial Fire governs Heaven, and Fire scorches Wood, hence *Shao Jiao*. This is the Third Origin of Generation.

**Tai Zhi in this: Ren-yin begets Gui-mao, Ren-shen begets Gui-you.**
*Gui* governs the Fire phase, corresponding to the *Zhi* tone of Fire. *Mao* and *you* are yin years, which should be *Shao Zhi* (Lesser Governance), but here it is *Tai Zhi*—why? *Mao* Wood engenders Fire, hence *Tai Zhi*. This is the Fourth Origin of Generation.

**Tai Gong in this: Gui-mao begets Jia-chen, Gui-you begets Jia-xu.**
*Jia* governs the Earth phase, corresponding to the *Gong* tone of Earth. *Chen* and *xu* are yang years, excessive, hence *Tai Gong*. This is the Fifth Origin of Generation.

**Shao Shang in this: Jia-chen begets Yi-si, Jia-xu begets Yi-hai.**
*Yi* governs the Metal phase, corresponding to the *Shang* tone of Metal. *Yi* and *geng* harmonize the Metal phase. This is the Sixth Origin, completing the cycle.

**Shao Yin governs Heaven, Water phase under Shao Yin, hence the fifth position.**
*Tai Yu* (Great Flourish) appears at the center as the Water phase. *Yang Ming* is seen below as *Yang Ming* at the Spring. In the *Bing-zi* Yearly Convergence, Water phase aligns with the Heavenly Stem, a convergence of phase and year, hence the Yearly Convergence. *Bing-wu* aligns with central transformation. Its *qi* brings cold, as the Water phase enacts the frigid transformation. Its manifestation is congealing desolation and biting cold—Water in excess, ice solidifies, the heavens grow bleak and bitter, the cold reaches its extreme. Its aberration is ice, snow, frost, and hail: when transformation loses its norm, the cold’s virtue prevails, manifesting as frost and snow, while Water’s hail brings destructive transformation. Its afflictions manifest as cold and lower-cold dampness affecting the kidneys, and over time, the heart.

**Tai Yu concludes in Bing-zi and Bing-wu years.**
*Bing* governs the Water phase, corresponding to the *Yu* tone of Water. *Zi* and *wu* are yang years, hence *Tai Yu*. This is the Primordial Origin.

**Tai Jiao begins this: Bing-zi begets Ding-chou, Bing-wu begets Ding-wei.**
*Ding* governs the Wood phase, corresponding to the *Jiao* tone of Wood. *Chou* and *wei* are yin years, which should be *Shao Jiao* (Lesser Angle), but here *Ding* is lodged in *wei*, hence *Tai Jiao*. This is the Second Origin of Generation.

**Tai Zhi in this: Ding-chou begets Wu-yin, Ding-wei begets Wu-shen.**
*Wu* governs the Fire phase, corresponding to the *Zhi* tone of Fire. *Yin* and *shen* are yang years, excessive, hence *Tai Zhi*. This is the Third Origin of Generation.

**Shao Gong in this: Wu-yin begets Ji-mao, Wu-shen begets Ji-you.**
*Ji* governs the Earth phase, corresponding to the *Gong* tone of Earth. *Mao* and *you* are yin years, deficient, hence *Shao Gong*. This is the Fourth Origin of Generation.

**Tai Shang in this: Ji-mao begets Geng-chen, Ji-you begets Geng-xu.**
*Geng* governs the Metal phase, corresponding to the *Shang* tone of Metal. *Chen* and *xu* are yang years, excessive, hence *Tai Shang*. This is the Fifth Origin of Generation.

**Shao Yu in this: Geng-chen begets Xin-si, Geng-xu begets Xin-hai.**
*Xin* governs the Water phase, corresponding to the *Yu* tone of Water. *Xin* phase aligns with *bing*, and *bing* and *xin* share the *Yu* tone. This is the Sixth Origin, completing the cycle.

The Emperor said: "Excellent. What of the governance of *Jue Yin*?"
Qi Bo replied: "The *si-hai* cycle. *Jue Yin* governs Heaven, Wood phase under *Jue Yin*, hence the first position. *Shao Jiao* (Lesser Angle) appears at the center as the Wood phase. *Shao Yang* is seen below as *Shao Yang* at the Spring. The interplay of cool and heat, victory and restoration, aligns with Wood’s deficiency: disasters strike the three palaces. That is, Metal’s clear transformation comes to vanquish Wood, and the victory is extreme. Wood has its child—Fire’s hot transformation restores victory over Metal, and Wood is thus harmonized. Hence it is said: cool and heat, victory and restoration, align."

In years where *Jue Yin* governs Heaven and Wood is deficient, Wood above attains balance. *Ding-si* is a *tianfu* year of dual transformation; *Ding-hai* is a *tianfu* year of proper transformation. Their *qi* movements manifest as wind, cold, heat, and wind—these are the fundamental transformations of Wood. Cold arises when Metal’s command overcomes Wood; heat arises when Fire’s command restores victory over Metal. Thus these two transformations occur.

*Tai Jiao* begins with *Ding-si* and *Ding-hai*. *Ding* governs Wood’s *qi*, corresponding to the *Jiao* tone of Wood. Though *si* and *hai* are Yin years of deficiency, they should be *Shao Jiao*, yet here they are *Tai Jiao*—this is because *Jue Yin* Wood aligns with the *tianfu*, hence *Tai Jiao*. This is the First Origin.

*Tai Zhi* follows: *Ding-si* generates *Wu-wu*, and *Ding-hai* generates *Wu-zi*. *Wu* governs Fire’s *qi*, corresponding to the *Zhi* tone of Fire. *Zi* and *wu* are Yang years of excess, hence *Tai Zhi*. This is the Second Origin of mutual generation.

*Tai Gong* follows: *Wu-wu* generates *Ji-wei*, and *Wu-zi* generates *Ji-chou*. *Ji* governs Earth’s *qi*, corresponding to the *Gong* tone of Earth. Though *chou* and *wei* are Yin years of deficiency, here they are *Tai Gong*—this is because *Ji* lodges in *wei*, and the stems mutually generate, making *wei* *Tai* and *chou* *Shao*. This is the Second Origin of mutual generation.

*Shao Shang* follows: *Ji-chou* generates *Geng-yin*, and *Ji-wei* generates *Geng-shen*. *Geng* governs Metal’s *qi*, corresponding to the *Shang* tone of Metal. Though *yin* and *shen* are Yang years and should be *Tai Shang*, here they are *Shao Shang*—this is because *Shao Yang* Ministerial Fire governs Heaven above, imposing celestial punishment, hence *Shao Shang*. This is the Fourth Origin of mutual generation.

*Shao Yu* concludes: *Geng-yin* generates *Xin-mao*, and *Geng-shen* generates *Xin-you*. *Xin* governs Water’s *qi*, corresponding to the *Yu* tone of Water. *Mao* and *you* are Yin years of deficiency, hence *Shao Yu*. This is the Fifth Origin of mutual generation.

*Tai Jiao* begins anew: *Xin-mao* generates *Ren-chen*, and *Xin-you* generates *Ren-xu*. *Ren* governs Wood’s *qi*, corresponding to the *Jiao* tone of Wood. Here *Ding* reappears, and *Ren* aligns with Wood’s *qi*. This is the Sixth Origin, completing the cycle and returning to the beginning.

When *Jue Yin* governs Heaven and Fire’s *qi* aligns with *Jue Yin*, it occupies the second position. *Shao Zhi* appears at the center as Fire’s *qi*. *Shao Yang* is seen below as *Shao Yang* at the Spring. The interplay of cold and rain, victory and restoration, aligns with Fire’s deficiency: disasters strike the nine palaces. That is, Water’s cold command comes to vanquish Fire, and the victory is extreme. Earth’s rain command restores victory over Water, and Fire is thus harmonized. Hence it is said: cold and rain, victory and restoration, align.

*Gui-si* is a year of dual transformation; *Gui-hai* is without transformation. Their *qi* movements manifest as heat, cold, and rain—these are the fundamental transformations of Fire. Cold arises when Water’s command overcomes Fire; rain arises when Earth’s command restores victory over Water. Thus these three transformations occur.

*Tai Zhi* in *Gui-si* and *Gui-hai*. *Gui* governs Fire’s *qi*, corresponding to the *Zhi* tone of Fire. Though *si* and *hai* are Yin years of deficiency and should be *Shao Zhi*, here they are *Tai Zhi*—this is because *Shao Yang* Ministerial Fire governs below at the Spring, aligning with Fire’s *qi* in a *suihui* year, hence *Tai Zhi*.

*Tai Gong* follows: *Gui-si* generates *Jia-wu*, and *Gui-hai* generates *Jia-zi*. *Jia* governs Earth’s *qi*, corresponding to the *Gong* tone of Earth. *Zi* and *wu* are Yang years of excess, hence *Tai Gong*. This is the Second Origin of mutual generation.

*Shao Shang* follows: *Jia-wu* generates *Yi-wei*, and *Jia-zi* generates *Yi-chou*. *Yi* governs Metal’s *qi*, corresponding to the *Shang* tone of Metal. *Chou* and *wei* are Yin years of deficiency, hence *Shao Shang*. This is the Third Origin of mutual generation.

*Tai Yu* concludes: *Yi-chou* generates *Bing-yin*, and *Yi-wei* generates *Bing-shen*. *Bing* governs Water’s *qi*, corresponding to the *Yu* tone of Water. *Yin* and *shen* are Yang years of excess, hence *Tai Yu*. This is the Fourth Origin of mutual generation.

*Tai Jiao* begins: *Bing-yin* generates *Ding-mao*, and *Bing-shen* generates *Ding-you*. *Ding* governs Wood’s *qi*, corresponding to the *Jiao* tone of Wood. Though *mao* and *you* are Yin years and should be *Shao Jiao*, here they are *Tai Jiao*—this is because *mao* aligns with Wood’s *qi* in a *suihui* year, hence *Tai Jiao*. This is the Fifth Origin of mutual generation.

*Tai Zhi* follows: *Ding-mao* generates *Wu-chen*, and *Ding-you* generates *Wu-xu*. *Wu* governs Fire’s *qi*, corresponding to the *Zhi* tone of Fire. Here *Gui* begins and *Wu* concludes, with *Wu* and *Gui* aligning in Fire’s *qi*. This is the Sixth Origin, completing the cycle.

When *Jue Yin* governs Heaven and Earth’s *qi* aligns with *Jue Yin*, it occupies the third position. *Shao Gong* appears at the center as Earth’s *qi*. *Shao Yang* is seen below as *Shao Yang* at the Spring. The interplay of wind and clear *qi*, victory and restoration, aligns with Earth’s deficiency: disasters strike the five palaces. That is, Wood’s wind command comes to vanquish Earth, and the victory is extreme. Metal’s clear command restores victory over Wood, and Earth is thus harmonized. Hence it is said: wind and clear *qi*, victory and restoration, align.

*Ji-si* and *Ji-hai* are years of dual transformation; *hai* is a year of proper transformation. Their *qi* movements manifest as rain, wind, and cold—these are the fundamental transformations of Earth. Wind arises when Wood overcomes Earth; cold arises when Metal restores victory over Wood. Thus these two transformations—rain, wind, and cold—occur.

*Tai Gong* in *Ji-si* and *Ji-hai*. *Ji* governs Earth’s *qi*, corresponding to the *Gong* tone of Earth.

In *Si-Hai* yin years, the phase should be *Lesser Gong*, yet here it is *Greater Gong*—this is because the sixth *Si* resides in Earth’s gate, hence *Greater Gong*. This is the *Primordial Origin*.

*Lesser Shang* begins with *Ji-Si* giving rise to *Geng-Wu*, and *Ji-Hai* giving rise to *Geng-Zi*. *Geng* governs Metal’s *qi*, corresponding to the *Shang* tone of Metal.

In *Zi-Wu* yang years, the phase should be *Greater Shang*, yet here it is *Lesser Shang*—this is because *Lesser Yin* Sovereign Fire governs the heavens above, imposing celestial punishment, hence *Lesser Shang*. This is the *First Nourishing Cycle* of *Resource and Generation*.

*Lesser Yu* concludes with *Geng-Wu* giving rise to *Xin-Wei*, and *Geng-Zi* giving rise to *Xin-Chou*. *Xin* governs Water’s *qi*, corresponding to the *Yu* tone of Water. *Chou-Wei* are yin years of deficiency, hence *Lesser Yu*. This is the *Third Nourishing Cycle* of *Resource and Generation*.

*Lesser Jue* begins with *Xin-Chou* giving rise to *Ren-Yin*, and *Xin-Wei* giving rise to *Ren-Shen*. *Ren* governs Wood’s *qi*, corresponding to the *Jue* tone of Wood. In *Yin-Shen* yang years, the phase should be *Greater Jue*, yet here it is *Lesser Jue*—this is because *Lesser Yang* Ministerial Fire governs the heavens above in *Yin-Shen*, and fire’s excess scorches Wood, hence *Lesser Jue*. This is the *Fifth Nourishing Cycle* of *Resource and Generation*.

*Greater Zhi* begins with *Ren-Yin* giving rise to *Gui-Mao*, and *Ren-Shen* giving rise to *Gui-You*. *Gui* governs Fire’s *qi*, corresponding to the *Zhi* tone of Fire. In *Mao-You* yin years, the phase should be *Lesser Zhi*, yet here it is *Greater Zhi*—this is because *Mao* belongs to Wood, and Fire encounters Wood in its flourishing phase, hence *Greater Zhi*, which is the yearly generation. This is the *Fifth Cycle* of *Resource and Generation*.

*Greater Gong* begins with *Gui-Mao* giving rise to *Jia-Chen*, and *Gui-You* giving rise to *Jia-Xu*. *Jia* governs Earth’s *qi*, corresponding to the *Gong* tone of Earth. In *Chen-Xu* yang years, the phase should be *Greater Gong*. Here, *Jia* returns to *Ji*, completing the cycle of Earth’s *Gong* phase.

*Jueyin* governs the heavens above, and Metal’s *qi* governs *Jueyin*, hence the fourth phase. *Lesser Shang* is centered in Metal’s *qi*. *Lesser Yang* is seen below as *Lesser Yang* at the spring, where Earth’s fire subdues Metal’s *qi*.

Heat and cold, victory and restoration, align with Metal’s deficiency: disasters strike the seven palaces. That is, Fire’s heat command comes to vanquish Metal, and the victory is extreme. Water’s cold command restores victory over Fire, and Metal is thus harmonized. Hence it is said: heat and cold, victory and restoration, align.

*Yi-Si* and *Yi-Hai* are years of dual transformation; *Hai* is a year of proper transformation. Their *qi* movements manifest as cold, heat, and cold—these are the fundamental transformations of Metal. Heat arises when Fire overcomes Metal; cold arises when Water restores victory over Fire. Thus these two transformations—cold, heat, and cold—occur.

*Lesser Shang* in *Yi-Si* and *Yi-Hai*. *Yi* governs Metal’s *qi*, corresponding to the *Shang* tone of Metal.

The *Yi-Si* and *Yi-Hai* years are years of Metal’s deficiency, hence *Lesser Shang*. They mark the inception. The *Tai-Yu* concludes with *Yi-Si* generating *Bing-Wu* and *Yi-Hai* generating *Bing-Zi*. *Bing* governs the Water *qi*, corresponding to the *Yu* tone of Water. The *Zi* and *Wu* years are yang, hence *Tai-Yu*. This is the second cycle of generative assistance.

The *Tai-Jiao* begins with *Bing-Wu* generating *Ding-Wei* and *Bing-Zi* generating *Ding-Chou*. *Ding* governs the Wood *qi*, corresponding to the *Jiao* tone of Wood. The *Chou* and *Wei* years are yin; they should be *Lesser Jiao*, but here they are *Tai-Jiao* because *Ding* is lodged in *Wei*, aligning with the heavenly stems and thus forming a direct resonance. This is the third cycle of generative assistance.

The *Tai-Zhi* follows with *Ding-Wei* generating *Wu-Shen* and *Ding-Chou* generating *Wu-Yin*. *Wu* governs the Fire *qi*, corresponding to the *Zhi* tone of Fire. The *Yin* and *Shen* years are yang and excessive, hence *Tai-Zhi*. This is the fourth cycle.

The *Lesser Gong* arises from *Wu-Yin* generating *Ji-Mao* and *Wu-Shen* generating *Ji-You*. *Ji* governs the Earth *qi*, corresponding to the *Gong* tone of Earth. The *Mao* and *You* years are yin and deficient, hence *Lesser Gong*. This is the third cycle of generative assistance.

The *Tai-Shang* follows with *Ji-Mao* generating *Geng-Chen* and *Ji-You* generating *Geng-Xu*. *Geng* governs the Metal *qi*, corresponding to the *Shang* tone of Metal. The cycle begins with *Yi* and concludes with *Geng*; *Yi* and *Geng* unite in Metal, completing the *Shang* cycle. As *Jueyin* governs the heavens and Water *qi* aligns with *Jueyin*, this is the fifth cycle. *Lesser Yu* manifests with Water *qi* at its center.

With *Shaoyang* governing below as the *qi* in the springs, Water overcomes the Earth Fire. Rain and wind, victory and restoration, align with Water’s deficiency: disasters strike the first palace. That is, Earth’s rain command comes to vanquish Water, and the victory is extreme. Water, thus besieged, is restored by Wood’s wind command, and Water is harmonized. Hence it is said: rain and wind, victory and restoration, align.

The *Xin-Si* and *Xin-Hai* years are years of dual transformation; *Hai* is a year of proper transformation. Their *qi* movements manifest as cold, rain, and wind—these are the transformations of Water. Rain arises when Earth overcomes Water; wind arises when Wood restores victory over Earth. Thus these three transformations occur.

The *Lesser Yu* concludes with *Xin-Si* and *Xin-Hai*. *Xin* governs the Water *qi*, corresponding to the *Yu* tone of Water. The *Si* and *Hai* years are yin, hence *Lesser Yu*. This marks the inception.

The *Lesser Jiao* begins with *Xin-Si* generating *Ren-Wu* and *Xin-Hai* generating *Ren-Zi*. *Ren* governs the Wood *qi*, corresponding to the *Jiao* tone of Wood. The *Zi* and *Wu* years are yang and should be *Tai-Jiao*, but here they are *Lesser Jiao* because *Shaoyin* Fire governs above, and Fire restrains Wood, diminishing it. This is the second cycle of generative assistance.

The *Tai-Zhi* follows with *Ren-Wu* generating *Gui-Wei* and *Ren-Zi* generating *Gui-Chou*. *Gui* governs the Fire *qi*, corresponding to the *Zhi* tone of Fire. The *Chou* and *Wei* years are yin and should be deficient, but here they are *Tai-Zhi* because *Gui* is lodged in *Chou*, aligning with the heavenly stems and thus forming a direct resonance. This is the third cycle.

The *Lesser Gong* arises from *Gui-Chou* generating *Jia-Yin* and *Gui-Wei* generating *Jia-Shen*. *Jia* governs the Earth *qi*, corresponding to the *Gong* tone of Earth. The *Yin* and *Shen* years are yang and excessive, and should be *Tai-Gong*. Here they are *Lesser Gong* because *Jia* encounters *Shen*’s punishment, thus diminishing it. This is a year of restraint. This is the fourth cycle of generative assistance.

The *Tai-Shang* follows with *Jia-Shen* generating *Yi-You* and *Jia-Yin* generating *Yi-Mao*. *Yi* governs the Metal *qi*, corresponding to the *Shang* tone of Metal. The *Mao* and *You* years are yin and deficient, and should be *Lesser Shang*, but here they are *Tai-Shang* because *Yangming* Metal governs the heavens above, forming a heavenly resonance with the *qi* of the year. This is the fifth cycle.

The *Tai-Yu* concludes with *Yi-Mao* generating *Bing-Chen* and *Yi-You* generating *Bing-Xu*. *Bing* governs the Water *qi*, corresponding to the *Yu* tone of Water. The *Chen* and *Xu* years are yang, hence *Tai-Yu*. The cycle begins with *Xin* and concludes with *Bing*; *Bing* and *Xin* unite in Water, completing the *Yu* cycle.
