**The Discourse of the Sea Traveler**

The sea traveler Li Guangyuan was a man of Bohai. Orphaned in youth, his family possessed vast wealth. Upon reaching adulthood, he sailed with fellow villagers to Qingzhou and Huaizhou as a merchant. Later, he crossed the sea again, where a Daoist traveled on the same vessel.

The Daoist asked him, “Who remains in your household, and what of your wealth? Why do you brave the sea?”

Li replied, “I am orphaned with only my brothers, and our wealth amounts to ten thousand. The Daoist said, “Given this, why risk the winds and waves for profit? The boundless sea and its endless swells may overturn your vessel in an instant—fish and dragons would seize the chance, and none could foresee the outcome.”

Li Guangyuan answered, “I do not cross the waves for profit. I reflect that all in this world is but a dream, like morning dew that cannot linger, or lightning that vanishes in a flash. Old graves are not yet dry before new ones follow. Heaps of gold buried in the earth are of no use to the dead; jade piled to the heavens cannot preserve life. Thus, I traverse the sea to enter the Central Kingdom, seeking perfected ones and realized masters, hoping to learn what practice might prolong my years. Having met no such teachers, I now return home—not for profit.”

The Daoist said, “You are still young, yet already weary of worldly desires and glory, aspiring to cultivate the Dao to extend your life. This is truly rare. Why doubt your destiny to ascend as an immortal?”

Li Guangyuan replied, “How could an earthworm’s form become a dragon? A sandpiper’s smallness can hardly match the phoenix. I dare not hope for great awakening—if I might only learn the art of cultivating the body to prolong life, that would suffice. Should a noble master deign to instruct this unworthy one, I would be most fortunate.”

The Daoist said, “The great medicine of the Golden Elixir cannot be obtained without encountering a perfected one, but preserving life and prolonging years lies within its essence. The Golden Elixir resides within the body—there is no other medicine. If you can distance yourself from the bedchamber, purify the turbid to attain clarity, rest your head on stone, rinse your mouth with flowing water, shed vexations for tranquility, and prevent the dissipation of primordial *qi*, you may attain longevity. This primordial *qi* is the original, undifferentiated *qi* within the body—the foundation of a person, the root of life. When thoughts cease, *qi* stabilizes; when spirit is at peace, *qi* settles. Thus, the wise still their judgments, sever sensory desires, ensure their breath does not stray beyond the nose, and direct their thoughts inward. When the Three Fields yield their treasures, longevity is assured. Further practices—absorbing the new and expelling the old, rinsing and swallowing saliva—all serve to extend life and secure the body. As the ancient song says:

*Qi* is the medicine that adds years,
Saliva the herb that extends life.
The world rushes and races in vain—
Who else should one seek but oneself?”

This is the truth made clear.

Guangyuan remarked, “The noble one’s bearing and appearance are extraordinary—surely this is the proof of it.”
The other replied, “I have practiced this Way and thus attained such a state. Now I am a hundred years old, yet illness has never touched me.”
Guangyuan bowed again in gratitude and said, “How fortunate I am to hear of the great Dao! Had I not a predestined affinity, how could I have beheld this?”
The Daoist then disembarked on the eastern shore, intending to travel to Silla, and so they bade each other farewell.

Guangyuan returned to Bohai and, following this Way, turned away from worldly vanity. He withdrew to Changyun Island, where he cultivated himself for several years. The benefits and confirmations were evident, and because of his comings and goings, people of the time called him the “Sea Traveler.”

Later, Guangyuan reflected that among the teachings of the world, there must be a gate to transcendence, a Way of golden elixir and jade liquid. Dwelling only here, how could he ever attain it? The Central Lands abounded with famous mountains and sacred realms of the various schools. Thus, he abruptly left the island and journeyed among the renowned mountains to seek these matters.

On the third day of the eighth month in the *jisi* year, he arrived at Mount Song’s Shaoshi Peak. He lodged in a monastic guesthouse for over ten days. Later, he walked south alone, surveying the ravines and valleys. After five or six *li*, he suddenly encountered an elderly man beneath a pine by the roadside. The man leaned on a staff adorned with three gourds, wore a short hemp robe and a long headscarf, and bore an air unlike ordinary people.

The old man asked Guangyuan, “What are you doing here?”
Guangyuan replied, “Nothing in particular—just admiring the mountains and waters.”
“Where have you come from?”
Guangyuan said, “For ten years, I have come from the sea, traveling through famous mountains until I reached this place. What brings you here?”
The old man said, “I was orphaned young, with a family fortune of ten thousand. I always scorned glory and wealth, caring only for the wondrous Dao, and so I came here.”
“How many years have you sought the Dao? Have you encountered anything?”
Guangyuan said, “I have wandered within the seas for over twenty years. Several years ago, on a boat, I met a Daoist who taught me to preserve and nurture essence and *qi*, and to guide and stretch the four limbs. Following his instructions, I have seen some confirmation.”
The old man said, “If so, then the Dao is already accomplished. What more do you seek?”
Guangyuan replied, “I have heard that the Way of immortals includes the arts of golden liquid and returning elixir. Fearing I might waste my years in vain, I have secretly set my heart on seeking them.”
The old man asked, “In your search for the golden liquid and returning elixir, have you encountered anything?”
Guangyuan said, “I have sought them for ten years but have found nothing.”
The old man smiled faintly and said, “Do you recognize me?”
Guangyuan replied, “I am dull and do not recognize this noble one.”
The old man said, “I am Master Yuanshou.”
He then asked, “What is your surname?”
Guangyuan said, “My surname is Li, and my name is Guangyuan.”
The old man laughed again and said, “My style is Yuanshou, and your name is Guangyuan—we match each other. I have found my man.”
He then asked, “In seeking the Way of the golden elixir, do you do so for others or for yourself?”
Guangyuan replied, “If I can achieve it for myself, I will also lift up those with the proper destiny.”
The master said, “This may be transmitted. If it were only for oneself, immortality would not be granted.”
Guangyuan bowed again in gratitude.
The master said, “Had you not a predestined affinity, even if you labored your whole life, you would not have encountered this. Your immortal bones are already manifest, and your spiritual foundation is gradually taking shape. If you truly listen to my words…”
He then set down his staff and sat upon a stone, gesturing for Guangyuan to sit as well.
Guangyuan said, “If the master wishes to transmit the supreme Dao, how can I, unworthy as I am, be so discourteous?”
The master replied, “The supreme Dao is not distant. In the space of this single day’s discourse, its mysteries may be exhausted. I cannot let you stand for long.”
Guangyuan then bowed and sat.
The master said, “The returning elixir is not some other medicine. The true One is its foundation; lead and mercury depend on each other; the yellow sprout is its root—only then can it be accomplished.”
Guangyuan said, “I have seen people of the time discuss the yellow sprout, but none know its profound principle. Without knowing the yellow sprout, what can be used to refine and complete it?”
The master said, “Lead emerges from within lead—only then is it the supreme treasure. Mercury transmits the *qi* of gold—only then is it called the yellow sprout. Have you not seen the ancient song:

*Yellow sprout, lead, and mercury refine,
The yin husk holds the yang flower.
Without the principle of the yellow sprout,
The returning elixir’s path is distant.*

People of the world refine the supreme medicine,
All mistaking it for yellow blossoms.
Lead yellow is a dead thing—
How could it reach the immortals’ home?

The yellow sprout is not in medicine;
From the inner image, take its essence.
If you reach the yellow sprout’s ground,
Gold and silver are but empty boasts.
This is what it means.”

Guangyuan said, “I have seen *The Five Categories of Gold and Jade*, which says, ‘Lead has great toxicity. How can it accomplish the supreme medicine?’”
The master replied, “Though it has great toxicity, that is because people of the world do not understand how to use it. For example, among the world’s toxic medicines, are there not many like croton? Yet if one knows how to use them, they can cure illness. Lead is the same. Thus, *The Ode of Tao Zhi* says:

*Within lead there is gold,
Within gold there is treasure.
The wise obtain it—
Would they refine gold from lead
Rather than treasure from gold?*

This is not the lead of the world. People of the world directly use lead, hoping to obtain the yellow sprout, but not one in ten thousand succeeds. This is because they neither recognize nor understand lead.”
Guangyuan asked, “Are there two kinds of lead?”
The master said, “Lead is not two. It is like raising a child: if you cut flesh from the parents’ bodies and place it in the child’s belly, how could the child be born? If separated from the parents, how could the child come into being? The ancient song says:

*The crucible is fundamentally without crucible,
The medicine fundamentally without medicine.
The yellow sprout does not use lead—
It must be made from within lead.
The yellow sprout is the yellow sprout,
But lead is ten thousand *li* from lead.
The yellow sprout is not the yellow sprout—
Only in lead does it begin.
Lead is the father of the sprout,
The sprout is the child of lead.
The child hides in the mother’s womb,
The mother hides in the child’s placenta.
Know the white, guard the black—
Spiritual illumination will come of itself.*

This is what it means. Thus, the various scriptures praise only the efficacy of lead.”

If one abandons this lead, it is like forsaking parents to seek a child. The ancient song says:

*Do not ruin my lead—
Let my life be preserved.
Do not break my chariot—
Let me return home.
If lead severs the river chariot, all efforts are in vain;
If lead shatters the river chariot, all works come to naught.*

It also says:
*The Mystery arises from the Golden Duke,
Majestically standing at the very beginning.*

And again:
*A single thing contains five hues.*

The *Taozhi Pian* states:
*The union of five hues accords with the natural Dao,
Thus giving birth to heaven and earth, becoming female and male.
Then the essence of the sun is returned to the moon’s cavern,
The flower of spirit congeals within the void,
Able to generate the essence of purple qi,
Secretly uniting with the true in perfect harmony.
Were one not an immortal, none could perceive this.*

Those who do not understand or comprehend it will err by the slightest misstep, losing it by a thousand *li*. Thus the song says:

*To use lead yet not use lead,
One must work within lead.
If common folk use lead,
Using lead is still wrong.*

Another song says:
*To use lead, do not use common lead—
The lead used is the old cinnabar field.*

All these make clear that one must not abandon lead but rather understand how to employ it. When used, yin and yang fall into order; when misapplied, husband and wife turn against each other. The key lies in delving deeply into lead. The *Yuanyangzi Song* says:

*True yin and true yang are the true Dao,
Right before your eyes—why seek afar?
Fools year after year refine divine elixirs,
Suddenly seeing blue and yellow, they call it good.
Those of resolve must seek the Dharma’s rule,
Lest they waste their spirit in vain confusion.
If one can but obtain the true yellow sprout,
Those who ingest it will live without aging.*

This is evident.

Guangyuan says: I have often heard people claim that cinnabar and mercury are the yellow sprout. What principle is this?

It is said: This is not the teaching of the perfected ancients. Cinnabar and mercury, lacking fixed nature and form, cannot generate life—just as a woman cannot conceive alone. Thus the *Li Xichan Pian* says:

*Cinnabar and mercury dwell together,
Yet the two maidens never know each other.*

If self-establishment is so difficult, how can the great Dao be achieved? The yellow sprout arises from the union of Kan and Li, the mutual generation of metal and water, the crowning of the male and the readiness of the female, the following of female and male. From non-being it enters being; when yin stirs and bowels intertwine, only then can it be accomplished, in accord with the highest principle. Thus the *Yin Zhenjun Song* says:

*The true qi of the north is the river chariot,
The Jia and Yi of the east are golden sand.
When the two essences nurture and return as one,
The Vermilion Bird stirs and gives birth to the golden flower.
The golden flower can generate heaven and earth’s treasure—
Those who grasp this speak the true Dao.*

This is evident.

Guangyuan says: I have also seen people take gold as the yellow sprout, silver as the yellow sprout, refined cinnabar-silver as the yellow sprout, extracted silver as the yellow sprout, or tin, bamboo-node lead, Jin Yao lead, desiccated lead, and the like as the yellow sprout. Others take litharge, red lead, or lead-yellow-flower as the yellow sprout. What principle is this?

It is said: None of these are correct. All such substances are crude and inert; when refined, their color fades and form withers; when burned, they turn to dust or mutate into earth. They are but dry bones and dead flesh—what use are they? Solitary yin and widowed yang cannot match the supreme transformation. Ingesting them scorches the viscera; consuming them shortens one’s years. How could they compare to the yellow sprout or approach the great Dao?

The yellow sprout arises from the union of lead and mercury, the merging of metal and wood, the intercourse of dragon and tiger, the restraint of water and fire. By aligning emotion with nature, making the hun follow the po, it fulfills the work of return and reversal, clarifies the principle of breath, and thus achieves the union of yang and the conception of yin. The mother is preserved within the child, obtaining heaven and earth’s essence to complete the primordial Dao. The ancient song says:

*Mercury does not reveal its ore,
Gold does not expose its form.*

And again:
*Cinnabar is the essence of wood,
Only when joined with metal does it unite.*

And again:
*When the dragon comes, the body contracts and the hun is sated;
When the tiger comes, it devours and generates marrow and fat.*

This is now clear.

Guangyuan says: If the yellow sprout is said to be made from lead and mercury, the mutual generation of metal and water, I remain confused and do not yet understand how it can be accomplished.

It is said: It is like farming in the human world. When planting crops, farmers first plow and select good land, then await the proper season, relying on wind and rain to harmonize, the seasons to hasten growth. By year’s end, the harvest is reaped in full. The cause of the yellow sprout is the same. By harmonizing lead and mercury, matching Kan and Li, water and fire following one another, the time fully ripening, they naturally unite, transforming beyond compare. When the yellow sprout is formed, the great Dao is complete. The song says:

*Lead and the yellow sprout, together with the three flowers,
Gather my qi to congeal into cinnabar.
First, the sun’s movement is like fire’s conveyance,
Five hues hidden within the divine flower.
Once made the servant, the Dao is without flaw—
When the three are complete, one is a immortal.*

This is evident.

Lord Guangyuan asked: "Having now heard of the yellow sprout, how then is the supreme medicine formed? I venture to inquire into its essential principle."

The master replied: "The supreme medicine employs only the Five Phases—nothing else is added. Should any extraneous elements be introduced, it ceases to be the supreme medicine. An ancient song says:

*Seize the Azure Dragon of the East,
Pair it with the White Tiger of the West.
Then take the Vermilion Bird of the South,
To meet the Dark Warrior of the North.
Yet the subtlest art lies within—
Lose not the Central Earth.*

This is evident. These Five Phases are the fundamental categories of lead, by which the elixir is formed. If non-conforming elements are present, the elixir cannot be achieved. It is like a household of father, mother, husband, and wife—no outsiders may enter. Lead, mercury, and the Five Phases are likewise."

"When subdued and congealed into medicine, the bones, flesh, essence, qi, and blood vessels are all complete, and only then is it fit for ingestion. Another ancient song says:

*Why speak of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth?
To preserve the body and safeguard life—these are Dragon and Tiger.
If students fail to recognize the essence of the Five Phases,
They mistakenly take others for their parents.
Wood governs qi, the Tiger governs bones,
Blood governs Water, flesh governs Earth.
The Way of immortality lies in the Li Palace—
When the Five Phases are mastered, the body has its lord.
The Five Phases must be kin to mercury,
For external substances are unfit as companions.*

Another song by Helan Qiu states:

*The Azure Dragon rises, the White Tiger rests,
The Dark Warrior soars, the Vermilion Bird sits,
The Yellow Dragon in the center bears fruit itself.
Mother cherishes child, child cherishes mother,
In the crucible, a single cloud congeals—
Ingesting a knife-tip’s measure, nothing is impossible.*

This is the Dao."

Lord Guangyuan asked: "Though the great medicine arises from the Dragon and Tiger’s subjugation and the true qi of the Five Phases, when it comes time to ingest it, what is its most essential form?"

The master replied: "The completed medicine is but a single substance—mercury. Though it is the embryo of divine water and becomes purple-gold powder, already containing the five hues and manifesting the Five Phases, when embodied, it is called the Golden Liquid Returned Elixir. The immortals of highest antiquity all followed this single method. An ancient song says:

*Mercury alone is the immortal’s medicine,
Passed down through ages, its fire-taming hard.
When the River Chariot transforms it to purple powder,
That powder in an instant becomes the Golden Elixir.*

*The true method of the Golden Elixir has no hooks,
Mercury alone is most profound.
A knife-tip’s touch verifies its transmutation—
Ingest it, never die, and sail the immortal’s boat.*

Another song says:

*Take the drawn-out mercury,
Return it to burning, reverse it to cinnabar.
In the womb, it receives the five hues,
When the moon is full, it is the yellow sprout.
Lost on the path, it cannot be seen—
Face to face, yet separated by heaven and sea.
When you reach the River Chariot’s ground,
This alone is the immortal’s home.*

This is clear."

Guangyuan asked: "If mercury refined by fire becomes an elixir, then since ancient times there have been many who have subdued cinnabar and mercury with fire—why is it that none of them have prolonged their years through ingestion, nor found success in transmutation? What is the reason for this?"

The master replied: "This is because they have not grasped the wondrous arts of the immortals, have not followed the principles of the scriptures, have not mastered the system of the Five Phases, and have not obtained the essence of the sun and moon. Some have mixed incompatible substances, while others have strayed far from the utmost truth. Even if they refine a thousand pounds of mercury with fire, it is no different from tiles and stones. Not only is it useless for transmutation, but ingesting it will even shorten one’s lifespan. Thus, the *Biography of Master Wang* states: 'In ancient times, there were two brothers who took a pound of mercury to Yangshan and refined it for three years. The mercury, subdued by fire, turned the color of red glass, and they believed it to be the supreme elixir. Each brother ingested half a pound, but within six months, they were wearing padded robes and had to be supported while walking. What they hoped would prolong their years instead harmed their bodies. Is this not due to the differences in medicinal substances and the errors in their methods? This serves as clear proof. Those who seek the truth must obtain the true formula—then not one in ten thousand will fail.

Since the Yellow Sprout is the foundation of the great elixir, and the elixir is formed by the Five Phases, one who understands the true origin—how could they not transcend the world? I do not yet know the proper measurements, the duration of refinement, or the method for achieving success. I humbly request the formula."

The master said: "The measurements of the immortal’s supreme elixir are not fixed by the great Dao. The refinement of the Golden Elixir follows a rhythm, for not only must the furnace and vessel take proper form, but the crucible must also embody Heaven and Earth. The fire begins at *zi* as its starting point, and one must understand the hexagrams’ omens. It continues from *li* and ends at *hai*, only then will the radiant splendor appear. This is like a child in the womb, which must await the fullness of the moon, or a chick within the egg, which must endure the cycle of the sun. As for measurements, the two eights dwell together; as for timing, a single stellar cycle must be completed. Only then can the dragon rise with clouds and rain, and the tiger roar upon the mountain crags—naturally prolonging one’s years above the world, rather than becoming a dead thing of the mortal realm."

A song says:
*The maid of sixteen, the essence of lead,
When yang arises, kindle the fire; when yin is exhausted, cease.
A stellar cycle completes the rain—
The supreme elixir attains numinous power.*

Another verse by Tao Hongjing in *Gazing at the Southern River* says:
*The elixir of long life is formed by the Five Phases.
The gates of *zi* and *wu* open, while *mao* and *you* govern the four seasons.
Fire unites with Heaven and Earth—
Dragon and tiger devour each other.*
This is what it means.

Guangyuan said: "I have received your instruction on the Great Elixir. Yet I have seen in various texts many names—*Sun’s Essence and Moon’s Spirit, White Tiger and Azure Dragon, Cinnabar and River Chariot, True Lead and Proper Mercury*—which confuse the mind. I do not yet know which among these is the correct designation. May I ask the reason?"

The master replied: "Though there are many names, they all follow the same path. The *Sun’s Essence* is the essence of yang; the *Moon’s Spirit* returns to the body of yin. The *Azure Dragon* is Wood, how could it depart from the East? The *White Tiger* is Metal, and thus resides in the West. *River Chariot* and *Golden Liquid* are the favored names of immortals. *True Lead* and *Proper Mercury* are the designations of those who have attained understanding. As long as one grasps the subtle workings, what need is there for hesitation? They do not transcend the Five Phases, nor is there any other principle."

Guangyuan said: "I have also seen in the *Yellow Emperor’s Scripture of the Hidden Talisman* that among the hundred methods of the Returned Elixir, the essential lies in the *Divine Water* and *Flowery Pond*. Within the Flowery Pond, the utmost spirit and wonder reside. Thus, the Yellow Emperor encountered this and ascended to perfection, and Ma Ming thereby attained the Dao. The principle of the Flowery Pond is fully expounded in the earlier chapter on the Five Phases. Thus, the *Song of Master Yuanyang* says:
*The Divine Water and Flowery Pond are rare in the world,
Their transmission forbids the knowledge of the vulgar.
If worldly lead and mercury are used,
They will only deceive people forever without doubt.*"

Guangyuan said: "I have seen in various elixir scriptures the phrase: *Three, Five, and One—the essence of Heaven and Earth.* I do not yet understand what this refers to."

The master replied: "The earlier chapter thoroughly explained that *Three, Five, and One* are also the Five Phases—nothing else. If you study this further, you will surely reach the root. Have you not seen the ancient song:
*Yin’s *kan* vainly seeks the One,
Yang’s *li* takes the Five’s radiant form.
To know the three places,
Embrace the spirit of Wood.
Refine the elixir—first master the secret,
Then delve into the ancient scriptures.
When you complete the numinous cinnabar,
Heaven’s chariot will plow the five clouds.*"

Guangyuan said: "Among the myriad medicines in the world, why is it that only the *Golden Liquid Returned Elixir* can prolong life, preserve longevity, and even ascend one to perfection?"

The master replied: "Your ignorance is such that you still do not understand. As for the people of the world..."

All things in the world are endowed by the Five Phases, and their life extends to the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys—how could they depart from the Five Phases of yin and yang? When one comprehends the essence of the Five Phases and unites it with the radiance of all phenomena, penetrating the wondrous use of *purple gold*, its flowing nectar earns the name *Pool of Flowers*. Consuming it, how could one not secure the four limbs, fortify the five viscera, naturally attain longevity, and transcend the world as if it were already before one’s eyes?

Yet the deluded cling to the ancient song:
*"Golden sand enters the five viscera,
Mist scatters like wind and rain.
Steaming, it reaches the four limbs,
And one’s complexion becomes bright and fair.
The old man regains youthful vigor,
The aged woman becomes a maiden once more.
White hair turns black again,
Fallen teeth grow anew.
Thus is one called a True Person."*

As for mineral medicines, the Five Phases do not record them. Consumed raw, they poison and harm the organs; refined by fire, they differ little from tiles and pebbles. They may cure minor ailments, but how can they compare to the Great Elixir? The principle is clear, the true source unobscured.

Herbal medicines, subject to the decay of the four seasons, cannot withstand frost and snow. Though a thousand flavors may blend, they only treat wind and dampness—how can they compare to the Great Elixir?

Guangyuan asked: "The Golden Elixir, when consumed, grants long life and even ascension to immortality. Beyond this, what other use does it have in the world?"

The master replied: "Deluded, oh so deluded! Does the Great Elixir of the Golden Medicine have no other use? When this elixir is complete after a year, its ten-month cycle fulfilled, opening the furnace yields *purple powder turned gold*, and lifting the cauldron scatters the *yellow sprout* in abundance. It encompasses the five colors and gathers the hundred spirits. First, it transmutes mercury into yellow gold. Only then is it verified that after ingestion, one’s sinews and bones are eternally fortified, life and household are saved—this is no empty word.

As the ancient song says:
*Cinnabar, oh cinnabar,
You save my life, you save my home.*

And Tao Hongjing’s *Wang Jiangnan*:
*When the tenth month is full,
Open the cauldron—a mass of red.
A few flecks of lingering frost hold the five colors,
The divine water of the embryo rings clear,
Its fragrance rich and rare.*

Thus may it be known.

Guangyuan asked: "Beyond this *yellow sprout*, what other medicine can turn mercury into a treasure?"

The master replied: "Beyond this *yellow sprout*, there is no other medicine."

Guangyuan asked: "How are other medicines refined?"

The master said: "What is refined is mercury. Mercury is the essence of heaven and earth, the spirit of the five metals. Its nature is fluid and unstained by impurities—hence the common saying that mercury is without falsehood. How could other substances enter the *yellow sprout*? The *yellow sprout* is inherently mercury, formed by the essence of the Five Phases. Without it, nothing is achieved.

Yet people exhaust their days and strength seeking the essence of alum and minerals, traveling thousands of miles in vain. Even if they obtain them, they achieve nothing in the end, their thoughts labored and hearts weary, only to return to the yellow springs. Is this not lamentable? All because they do not understand the nature of medicines, nor recognize that like gathers with like. Alum and minerals do not share the same origin as metal. Since mercury is the spirit of gold, how can mineral medicines enter and transmute it into gold?

Thus the song says:
*Gold can be made, the world can be delivered.
If gold is not made, you only deceive yourself.*
This is no falsehood. The great joy lies before your eyes, yet people remain unaware. To insist on using alum and minerals is like seeking fish in the mountains or casting nets for rabbits in the sea—how can it succeed?"

Guangyuan asked: "Some people use the five metals as a crucible to refine mercury, yet after years of effort, nothing is achieved. What is the reason?"

The master replied: "The five metals are mere worldly substances, not the supreme medicine. The *Yellow Sprout* chapter explains this in detail. Moreover, the art has its hidden secrets, the Dao its profound subtleties. Only through oral transmission and heart-to-heart instruction can the elixir be completed. Yet people recklessly rely on superficial sayings, blindly following ancient formulas to refine mercury, seeking great attainment. They do not realize that the Five Phases contain gestation like a pregnant woman, and lead and mercury depend on each other like a morning hen brooding her eggs. As for the wondrous Dao, it connects to the divine. The slightest deviation disrupts the order of yin and yang.

Thus Tao Hongjing’s *Wang Jiangnan* says:
*The secret of the Returned Elixir,
A wondrous art passed mouth to mouth.
If you trust ancient formulas, you will surely err,
Tossing and turning, wasting money in vain—
Do not blame the immortals.*

And his *Pusa Man*:
*Every household has the medicine of long life,
Yet people use it incorrectly.
The qi and timing still drift and sink—
Where, sir, do you seek it?
Before your eyes, yet unrecognized,
You mistakenly search in lead.
This thing lacks the yellow sprout,
Wasting years in vain.*

Examine this principle closely, and you will understand.

Guangyuan asked: "The four yellows and eight minerals have no relation to the Great Dao and do not harmonize with mercury. Yet sulfur can instantly refine mercury into cinnabar. What is the reason?"

The master replied: "Mercury is true yin, sulfur is borrowed yang. True qi is restrained by borrowed yang, and they depend on each other from beginning to end—this is the great principle of yin and yang. Moreover, sulfur is the liquid of alum, alum is the fluid of iron, and magnetite is the mother of iron. Needle sand and magnetite refine sulfur into *cloud powder*—this is one root. Sulfur is thus the descendant of iron, while mercury is the essence and spirit of gold. Though the two qi temporarily harmonize, they ultimately achieve nothing. Only by carefully investigating the principle can the root be seen."

Guangyuan asked: "Various alums cannot refine mercury, nor do they harmonize with it. Yet I have seen green alum mixed with salt refine mercury into powder or frost. What is the reason?"

The master replied: "Mercury is the spirit and soul of gold. Green alum is the essence of iron. In terms of the five metals, the two qi share a root, but in the discourse of lead and mercury, copper and iron are far apart. Thus, green alum can temporarily refine mercury into powder, but it serves no great purpose."

Just as when refining yellow arsenic by sublimation, covering its vessel with a lid turns it white—yet without salt, its color remains unchanged. All such matters are trivial and unrelated to the Great Dao. You must simply delve deeply and forever cast aside distractions.

The ancient scriptures say: *"Flying mice follow mercury; the river chariot subdues it."* If杂 impurities are present, there can be no success. An old verse declares:

*"By the riverside, an old woman,
Most wondrous and divine.
At fire’s touch, she takes flight,
Unsoiled by dust or grime.
Like ghosts concealed or dragons hidden,
Her whereabouts unknown.
To master her, the yellow sprout
Must be the root alone."*

This much is clear.

Guangyuan asked: "The world does not understand lead and mercury, nor does it recognize the Five Phases. People use the Four Yellows to refine mercury, the Eight Stones to concoct the supreme elixir, and employ every manner of preparation—alum, male and female minerals, magnetite, arsenic, chalcanthite, and green vitriol—all to no avail. They mistake divine frost for black tin, or revere the ignorant as sages. They temper with fire a thousand times, refine with water ten thousand cycles, tend the crucible for three years, or watch the furnace for five—yet achieve nothing, exhausting their spirit in vain. I fear that even immortals may not know: among all the alums, has anyone truly succeeded in refining mercury? I humbly request an outline of the method."

The master replied: "In all things under heaven, even the most minute, nothing exists without principle, analogy, or affinity between kindred types. How can this remain obscure? Mercury is the essence, spirit, and marrow of gold. It shares a root with lead and a body with water. Within the Five Phases, they conceive one another; metal and water generate each other. Only when qi transforms into radiance does the supreme elixir take form. Once transmuted into mercury, its changes are boundless, its transformations infinite—unmatched in the world.

Thus, *The Treatise of Tao Hongjing* states: *'Metal is the mother of water; the mother conceals the child in her womb. Water is the child of metal; the child nests within the mother’s embrace.'* This speaks of how metal and water naturally contain one another, the calf hidden within its mother, awaiting transformation to coalesce. *'The eldest son inherits the father’s body, establishing lineage through the mother.'* This means cinnabar is born of metal, and mercury flows as its child—nurtured by gold, it inherits the body and flourishes. The Dao accords with nature; its workings are profoundly subtle, beyond knowing, beyond thought.

If one relies on alums, stones, or miscellaneous substances, the form and essence become entirely estranged, the ancestral lineage lost, and return to the origin impossible. It is like birds and chickens sharing a nest, or cats and mice dwelling in the same burrow—like using lacquer to mend a cauldron, or mercury to treat a wound. Not only is there no benefit, but harm is certain. A song says:

*'The world prefers the false over the true,
Mixing stone medicines with mercury.
The alchemical maiden scatters into mist,
Leaving only vain repute to cling together.
Alums and chalcanthite drain one’s estate,
Fools trust charlatans as kin.
Without encountering immortals to speak of the supreme principle,
One’s white-haired years end in futility.'*

This, too, is clear."

Moreover, mineral medicines number roughly seventy-two in total. The sages of antiquity carefully distinguished their sour and salty properties, recording them in medical treatises—yet these serve only to treat various illnesses and repel demonic influences, bearing no relation to the workings of creation nor aligning with the Five Phases. Even if one were to obtain an original formula and master its most subtle refinements, it would but temporarily preserve the hair and temples; how could it ever transform the sinews and bones?

The world, lost in delusion, recklessly transmits these methods, deceiving others with claims of divine transcendence. They recklessly grind alums and stones together with lead and mercury, mix them with willow ash, boil them with jujube leaves, or refine them with vinegar and honey. Some even sublimate them with water or wine—yet never achieve success, squandering their days in vain. They speak of "solidifying the crucible," yet iron and stone prove no match for true firmness; they boast of "covering and insulating," yet before long, all efforts come to naught. After three years of labor, what remains has crumbled to dust. Then they claim that chickens and dogs have ascended, or that dragons and serpents have transformed—never realizing the principle of the Great Dao, blindly blaming heaven and resenting others. Such deluded souls are not rare in this world.

Still others exhaust every mineral and herb under heaven, depleting their wealth in pursuit, their minds growing ever more confused. Is this not lamentable? Guangyuan said: "People take mulberry wood ash to refine cinnabar and mercury." An ancient song states:

*'The dragon dwells in the forty-eighth position of Zhen.'*
*(Note: Zhen (震) is the third trigram, corresponding to the character "sang" (桑, mulberry).)*

Another song says:
*'Gather it before the silkworms feed,
Use it after the fire’s transformation.'*

These are all said to be the root of the Great Medicine—yet who truly knows if this is so?

It is said: The foundation of the Great Medicine has already been fully expounded. As for using mulberry ash and the like, these are all inventions of the deluded, recitations of fools, passed down in succession yet achieving nothing. The "forty-eighth position of Zhen" mentioned in the Immortal’s song refers to the weight and directional alignment of the supreme medicine, not the character for "mulberry." The unenlightened, failing to grasp this, cling to emptiness, chasing illusions like deer pursuing sheep or apes grasping at the moon. How could they ever succeed? The Great Medicine relies purely on the Five Phases, with no other substances involved.

Alum mixed with other stones still fails to form the elixir—how much further astray are those who rely on mulberry firewood and the like! Thus the *Cantong Qi* states: "Foxes do not nurse horses, nor do swallows give birth to phoenixes."

Guangyuan said: "Many in the world take soot from chimney flues, claiming it to be the essence of wood, matching it to the position of the Green Dragon." The *Song of Yuanyangzi* says:
*"To know cinnabar as the essence of wood,
Move it west to join with metal.*
*Where do the deluded seek Dragon and Tiger?
In the dim vastness, all is vague and obscure."*
This is precisely the case.

Others seek well salt from Yongzhou or use the *Taiyin* Primordial Essence Stone to pair with the White Tiger’s image. How could this align with the true Way of Dragon and Tiger, the origin of the Great Elixir?

I say: How deeply you struggle to awaken! The supreme Way is not distant, yet people fail to recognize it. Fools and the wise alike pass down these errors—how lamentable! The supreme medicine is a living, transformative substance, its nature concealed in immortal records, extending human life below. Those who obtain it understand the Five Phases intuitively; those who encounter it see all phenomena illuminated. Once the golden elixir is achieved, poverty and illness vanish together.

As for soot, ore, and primordial essence—these are dead things of the world, no different from tiles and pebbles. Ingesting them halts the flow of blood and qi; refining them exhausts the spirit. How could they transform into the Great Elixir? The truth lies before your eyes, yet the deluded remain blind.

The *Song of Yuanyangzi* speaks of the true Way of Dragon and Tiger—how could it refer to soot and ore? Yuanyangzi was a true immortal; how could he be so misled? The true Dragon and Tiger are the essence of the returning elixir, the heart of lead and mercury. Immortals have expounded this clearly in scriptures and treatises, yet the deluded grow ever more confused.

Thus the *Inscription of the Golden Elixir* states:
*"Cinnabar’s position is not inherently red;
Arranged through the four seasons, it resides in the southern abode.*
*Belonging to the south, the fire of Bing and Ding,
Its form is red."*
Extract the mercury within cinnabar, and it aligns with the east, the wood of Jia and Yi—its form is the image of the Green Dragon.

*"Black lead is not inherently black;
Within it holds the embrace of the Five Virtues."*
Matching the north, the water of Ren and Gui, its form is black. Extract its essence, and it belongs to the west, the metal of Geng and Xin—its form is white, the image of the White Tiger.

The song says:
*"When the Five Phases do not proceed in order,
The Tiger is born within water.*
*When the Five Phases are inverted,
The Dragon emerges from fire."*

The *Rhapsody of the Golden Elixir* also states: "Fire turns east to become the Dragon; water revolves west to become the Tiger." Li Bingchan said: "The *Taiyin* resides in the southern abode; the *Taiyang* in the northern. Fire’s wood is mercury; water’s metal is lead. Governed from the central palace, qi assists by kind." All these expound the Dragon and Tiger, verifying the divine elixir. How could soot, ore, or primordial essence compare? Reflect deeply—there is not a single error. To trust the deluded is to suffer in vain.

Guangyuan said: "Master, you have fully expounded the Way of the Great Elixir. I have heard that in ancient times, Liu Wang of Huainan refined *qiushi* into the supreme medicine, consuming it to ascend to heaven. What is *qiushi*? I have also seen many alchemical records referring to the title 'Saint Without Knowledge,' which the world calls 'green salt.' Is this true?"

I say: The *qiushi* refined by the King of Huainan *was* the Great Elixir—there is no other principle. It is one thing with many names. Sages adapt their terms to the moment, assigning names as they see fit. The "Green Metal Tiger" is the foundation of the Great Elixir. Its color is congealed white, belonging to the west. The west corresponds to autumn, hence its name. It is like the "River Chariot" and "Yellow Sprout"—all of one kind.

"Saint Without Knowledge" refers to the marrow of cinnabar, the profound gate of lead and mercury. When the Five Phases govern and subdue, it generates flesh and bone; when all phenomena are encompassed, blood and qi are complete. Immortals seek it yet do not know it; sages ponder it yet do not attain it—hence its name. How could it be green salt? The deluded are mistaken.

Guangyuan said: "The Way of the Great Elixir is wondrous and subtle—how did the immortals first come to know it?"

I say: Gold is the child of water; mercury is the soul of gold. Though they share a root with the Five Phases, they cannot unite across ten thousand years. Lingyangzi Ming, a sage of the primordial beginning, and the immortals of antiquity knew this return to the source must hold a secret Way. Thus they paired south with north, west with east, arranging these four directions without neglecting the central path. For a year they tended the fire; for ten months they opened the furnace. After seven returns without loss and nine revolutions complete, the flying soul was subdued and the wandering spirit returned home—hence the name *Purple Gold Fire-Liquid Great Return Divine Elixir*.

The song says:
*"Nine returns, seven reversals, three-five-one,
Dragon and Tiger unite in the divine chamber.*
*The ash pool’s flames refine heaven and earth’s essence;
The golden liquid returning elixir’s work is complete."*

Guangyuan said: "I have reverently heard your teaching on the Way of the Great Elixir. Yet many in the world use herbs—red celery, lettuce, *zhangliu*, pine resin, all gathered and employed. They extract juice from *didan*, uproot *tianweng*, combine *yinxian* and purslane, and use *longnao* and dodder, forming them into pellets in hopes of obtaining gold. Such people are as numerous as hemp or reeds—will any succeed?"

I say: Though humans are of one kind, wisdom and folly vary endlessly. Endowments differ, and so do achievements. The wise comprehend all within the realm; the foolish do not see what lies in their palm. It is like clouds rising to the heavens while tiles and pebbles remain on the earth. The vital qi of *lei* cannot be suppressed, nor can tiles and pebbles be lifted—so too with the wise and foolish; transformation is not possible.

Moreover, mercury is the accumulated qi of yin, the essence of primordial water. It takes ten thousand years to take form, joining with the Five Metals to become their spirit. Heavier than gold, pure and untouched by dust—it lies before your eyes. What is difficult to see?

Herbs sprout in spring, grow in summer, wither in autumn, and decay in winter. Their branches and leaves are not sturdy, their roots and stems not enduring. Split them, and they yield water; burn them, and they turn to ash. To expect them to congeal into mercury is as distant as heaven from earth.

Those who blindly chase profit, devoid of knowledge, deceive and mislead their contemporaries—how could they ever succeed? Some in Hebei point to the Three Hao regions, claiming herbs grow there; others in Lingnan speak of success in the Two Shu territories. All are empty transmissions, devoid of truth. Passed down through generations, their errors are lamentable. The wise discern this; the foolish remain ignorant.

Guangyuan said: "Is it possible that herbs might yet produce cinnabar?"
The master replied: "How long is a rabbit’s horn? How much fur does a tortoise have?"
Guangyuan said: "Rabbits have no horns; tortoises have no fur."
The master said: "Then how is the notion of herbs yielding cinnabar any different?"

Guangyuan said: "If herbs cannot produce cinnabar, why do so many in the world speak of the *Three Yellows and One Vault*, claiming herbs can refine cinnabar into gold?"
The master said: "The nature of the Three Yellows differs from mercury, and they are volatile. How could they be controlled to form gold? When raw, they turn to smoke and ash; when subdued by fire, they become like tiles and pebbles—no transformation occurs. If the mother is but tiles and pebbles, how can the child become gold or silver? It defies reason. Just as in the world, flying creatures bear male and female, walking creatures bear male and female, so too with ants, insects, and fish—all follow this pattern. How then could the *Three Yellows and One Vault* or herb-derived cinnabar ever succeed? If they could, why not simply use gold to produce gold? What harm would there be? Moreover, gold is the root; once formed, it does not vanish entirely. It does not defy the workings of creation. Those who leave behind such alchemical texts achieve nothing, for they point to herbs.

Herb-derived cinnabar has, from ancient times to now, been but a phantom name—like seeking dust in water, drilling ice for fire, expecting cicadas to birth phoenixes, or cranes to bear serpents. Even mineral medicines differ fundamentally; how could herbs ever enter the process? Yet falsehoods are passed down, driving men to futile searches—north of the ridges, south of the ridges, beyond the seas, within the seas—crafting clever arguments about branches and leaves, expounding on sour and salty flavors, only to harm themselves in the end. Shi Chong lost his family because of this; Liang Ji’s clan was destroyed. They pursued countless schemes, seeking every possible means, yet only managed to stave off poverty and hunger. Why then seek motherless cinnabar to make gold and silver? The deeper the greed, the farther from the Dao.

True immortals, when refining medicines to create gold and silver, do not require motherless cinnabar. They regard glory and wealth as dirt, and gold and jewels as nothing to covet. If they transform small amounts, it is only to demonstrate the efficacy of their medicines, to aid the poor and hungry—not to indulge desires and destroy themselves. Those who insist on using motherless cinnabar to make gold and silver are utterly deluded.

Motherless cinnabar, when burned, cannot be contained—it flees like a spirit. Compared to raw mercury, how much less can it achieve? In the end, it is all vanity. The wise hear this and awaken; the foolish cling to it until their hair turns white. Seeking snakes that dance, turtles that fly—is this not tragic?"

Guangyuan said: "I see many in the world exhaust their wealth trying to make gold and silver from motherless cinnabar, yet achieve nothing. What is the reason for this?"
The master said: "These are not true seekers of the Dao, but those who compete for wealth. The Dao takes emptiness and tranquility as its foundation, stillness and clarity as its basis. One must temper desires and dwell in the mountains, abandon greed and live in the world, preserve the spirit and nurture qi, eat cypress and pine. Only then can one gradually attain purity, slowly reach the true realm.

Gold and silver are worldly things, meant only to briefly aid fleeting life. If it is your portion, they will come without seeking; if not, seeking will not bring them. When scattered, they reveal one’s virtue; when gathered, they demand careful consideration. Do not lose yourself in error.

Guangyuan asked again: "What is motherless cinnabar?"
The master laughed and said: "You insist on creating gold and silver, yet require motherless cinnabar. Why not simply use gold and silver as the mother? Mercury returns to its mother’s body—is this not reasonable? If you must have no mother, then what of the cinnabar, divine cinnabar, calomel, and light powder of the world—all formed from mercury, yet containing no metals? Are they not the same as motherless cinnabar?

Remember my words, and you will not be deceived by the illusions of your time."

Guangyuan said: "I have heard your instruction. But among the herbs of the world, are there any that can extend life and transcend the mundane?"
The master said: "Many famous herbs can extend life. Have you not read the *Records of the Ten Continents* or the *Biographies of Divine Immortals*? They contain countless accounts of transcending the world. Lingzhi mushrooms stand tall, red herbs display their beauty, yellow essence and white wood, red arrows and poria—peach blossoms and apricot kernels, cypress leaves and pine seeds—all are suitable for cultivation, as recorded in the medical texts. Some boil white stones to stave off hunger, refine primordial essence to transcend the world. These are the practices of those beyond the mundane, the extraordinary men of mountains and wilds, who go without grain for years, cultivate the true for decades. Thus, inner and outer align, and consuming herbs yields results. Is this not extending life and transcending the world?

But the common folk know nothing of the supreme Dao. Their greed knows no end. They only amass jade and pile gold, considering it worldly joy. Indulging in arrogance and extravagance, they vie in ostentation, never a day without fine flavors, never a day without fine silks. Their seven orifices flow ceaselessly, their three fields are not secure. Even if they consume myriad divine medicines, what good will it do? How could they ever transcend the world?

Follow my words, and the great Dao is not far; the true realm will surely be attained."

Guangyuan said: "By chance, I ascended the heights and encountered a true person. You have not dismissed me as a mere fool but entrusted me with profound mysteries. Your kindness is as vast as heaven and earth, beyond words to express. Now I wish to prepare these medicines and enter the famous mountains to refine them. Is this permissible?"

The master said: "This Dao is most vast and most wondrous. You must guard it with utmost care. Should you leak its celestial mysteries, not only will your seven generations suffer calamity, but your own body will be destroyed. Keep it strictly concealed, and do not speak of it or associate with those unworthy.

Though this mountain is renowned, it lies near the great capital. Now, with warfare just breaking out, this mountain stands in the path of conflict, and many fugitives take refuge here. You cannot refine the divine elixir here.

In the Wu and Yue regions of Jiang-Zhe, there are many famous mountains—Luofu, Maoling, Mount Lu, Tiantai—all currently at peace, with no troubles to come. These are the places where worthy sages gather and the immortals roam. You should go there to refine the great elixir, and you will surely transcend the world.

All that I have told you is without error. Guard it well."

Guangyuan said: "Your kindness is as deep as the Bohai Sea, as weighty as the mountains. I am but a humble man—how can I ever repay you?"

The master replied: "That you have this destiny is a meeting of karmic conditions. I see the people of the world in turmoil, all greedy for glory and rank, all loving extravagance and abandoning simplicity. In an instant, they all die, and I grieve deeply for them.

If you record what I have taught and compile it into a manual to guide those with the proper destiny, that will be your repayment to me. This is my wish as well."

Guangyuan was overcome with emotion and could not speak.

The master then asked: "You have spent much time by the sea—have you ever drunk the primordial wine?"

Guangyuan replied: "I do not know what primordial wine is."

The master then untied the gourd from his staff and drew water for Guangyuan. He added medicine to the gourd, covered it with a leaf, and in moments, it turned into wine—crimson and purple in hue, with an extraordinary fragrance and taste. The master drank a cup himself and gave the rest to Guangyuan to finish. Immediately, his spirit felt refreshed, and he bowed again in gratitude.

The master pointed and said: "The day grows late. You should return now. My dwelling is just south of this peak. Come again if you have no pressing matters."

With that, he departed. A wisp of cloud flashed by, and his traces vanished.

Guangyuan returned to the temple lodging. The next day, he went directly to the south of the peak to seek the master, but the paths were all lost. When he reached the southern slope, there were no trails at all—only white clouds, flying crows, and the warm murmur of the mountain stream. No person was to be seen. Then he knew the master did not dwell among mortals.

With deep regret, he recorded these teachings into a volume, hoping that scholars and gentlemen would examine them carefully.

*The Discourse of the Sea Traveler* concludes.
