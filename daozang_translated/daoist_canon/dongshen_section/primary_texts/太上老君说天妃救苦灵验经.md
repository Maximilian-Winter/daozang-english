*The Heavenly Honored Lord Lao Speaks the Efficacious Sutra of the Heavenly Consort’s Salvation from Suffering*

We look up to invoke the imperial-bestowed title, boundless in majesty,
A compassionate assistant to the Northern Dipper, divinity most efficacious.
Her awe-inspiring presence manifests upon the great seas,
Her virtue and power widely bestowed—all under heaven revere her.
She shields the realm and saves the people without obstruction,
Aiding the perilous and rescuing the imperiled in an instant.
Now roaming the celestial realms, now the human world,
Now traversing the waves and billows, now the earthly prisons.
Demons and specters all submit to her,
Phantoms and malevolent spirits all hide in retreat.
She transforms misfortune into fortune as swiftly as a finger-snap,
Bestows blessings and dispels calamities as if annihilating dust.
When mortals pray, holding golden censers,
All turn their hearts to her in earnest supplication.

**Sincere Devotion and Homage:**
In the wondrous realm of Putuo, on Meizhou of Xinghua,
Her numinous responses and virtue are extraordinary,
Her filial piety moves the gods, her divine power vast.
She calms the waves to rescue those in distress,
Upholds the perilous to revive the dying.
Great in compassion, great in mercy,
She saves the suffering, delivers from hardship—
By imperial decree, her luminous efficacy shines forth:
*Heavenly Consort, Illustrious in Wondrous Response, Vast in Benevolence, Universally Salvific, Protector of the Realm, Shelter of the People.*

**Invocation Mantra:**
We invoke the Three Heavens’ Supreme Overseer,
The Nine Heavens’ roaming sentinel, never at rest.
The August Heavenly Consort, whose merit shields the realm,
By imperial decree, her numinous grace defends the court.
Adorned with a floral crown, she rides a phoenix chariot,
Clad in kingfisher robes, wielding a dragon’s form.
To the east, the Western Flower’s ghostly generals array,
To the south, she leads expeditions, aiding the divine hosts.
Her sword and talisman gleam with the Dipper’s light,
Her decrees and commands sweep away demonic spirits.
Her majestic presence manifests—all revere her,
Her heart moves with compassion, rain and dew equally bestowed.
She saves the people, shields the realm, bestowing grace,
Upholds the harmed, eradicates calamity, fostering prosperity.
Her power and virtue pervade the upper realms,
Her mercy descends to the world, delivering all beings.
Mountains and rivers, altars and states, forever secure,
Wind in harmony, rain in season, preserving great peace.
Her radiance scatters, her brilliance fills the Three Realms,
In the human world and heavens, sun and moon shine bright.
Celestial dragons and ghosts all pay reverence,
By decree, all ascend to the Supreme Clarity.
I now vow to uphold this forever,
With wholehearted devotion, I honor the true sutra.

**Homage Mantra:**
Yin’s virtue first arises,
Yang’s light brings auspicious purity.
Her majesty blazes forth,
Saving and delivering the people.
She beheads demons, eradicates evil,
Swiftly ascending to the Supreme Clarity.
The Three Terraces come to guard,
All sages welcome her.
Wearing heaven, treading earth,
She paces the Dipper and the Striding Star.
No sorrow remains unvanquished,
No wish left unfulfilled.
Recite the divine mantra,
The Dao’s *qi* endures forever.

At that time, the Heavenly Honored Lord Lao was in the Boundless Realm. Gazing upon the vast oceans, the great rivers and their sources, the Four Seas and Nine Rivers, the Five Lakes and watery marshes, he saw dragons, serpents, fish, and leviathans emerging and transforming, spirits and demons assuming a thousand forms.

Among the multitudes of beings, some engaged in commerce and trade, seeking treasures and rarities; some ventured to distant lands, trafficking with foreign domains; some from outer realms presented tribute, while the imperial state bestowed grace; some transported grain and tribute, sailing to and fro. Yet when winds and waters turned treacherous, tides surged violently, waves rose suddenly, or when wind and thunder struck, rain and hail poured down—then ghosts and spirits, seizing the shifts of yin and yang, capsized boats, took lives, and wrought indiscriminate harm. Those thus afflicted had no escape, forced to seize others to replace their deaths, their resentment surging upward—how could they be saved?

Thereupon, the Perfected One of Vast Salvation ascended to address the Heavenly Worthy: "Within the Dipper resides the Wondrous Conduct Jade Maiden. Since kalpas past, she has cultivated myriad virtuous practices, vowing to propagate the true teaching and broadly deliver beings, universally granting peace and bliss."

Then the Heavenly Worthy commanded the Wondrous Conduct Jade Maiden to descend into the human world and save the people’s afflictions. In the year of *jiashen*, on the twenty-third day of the third month at the hour of *chen*, she was born into the world.

From birth, she was spiritually attuned; as she grew, her divinity was extraordinary. She cultivated wondrous practices, demonstrated great spiritual powers, and delivered the people. She vowed to resolve the hardships of all sentient beings, eradicate calamities, uphold the distressed, and relieve suffering. When her merit was complete and her fruit full, she ascended in broad daylight. The earth gods and altar lords memorialized her to the Three Heavens.

Thereupon, the Lord Lao issued a decree, bestowing upon her the title: *Heavenly Consort, Assistant to the Dipper, Filial and Pure in Illustrious Response, Faithfully Salvific, Protector of the Realm, Shelter of the People, Illustrious in Wondrous Response, Vast in Benevolence, Universally Salvific.*

Then the Heavenly Consort, hearing the proclamation of the Dharma, expansively declared her vow: "From this day forward, if there are traveling merchants or settled traders seeking wealth, or farmers, artisans, and craftsmen tilling and managing; if armies array in battle, or women struggle in childbirth; if official disputes arise, or slanderous tongues assail; if myriad vexations afflict, or illnesses linger without respite—whoever can arise with reverence and invoke my name, I shall respond in that very moment, granting their wishes and fulfilling their hearts’ desires, their plans succeeding as they intend.

I constantly roam the celestial realms, pervading the human world, even to the earthly prisons, springs, rivers, and seas—every place. All who seek shall have their wishes fulfilled."

Thereupon, the Perfected One of Vast Salvation, hearing these vows, bowed in reverence and submitted, reciting a gatha:

By decree, she assists the Dipper,
Her traces manifest, her power divine.
Flying talismans, racing seals,
She commands the celestial soldiers.
She captures traitors, beheads demons,
Upholds the perilous, rescues the imperiled, aiding the heavenly hosts.
Evil spirits forever annihilated,
Illnesses pacified, peace restored.
Those who revere her prosper,
Those who oppose her fall.
She suppresses fires and thefts,
Severs the paths of darkness.
East, west, south, north—
The four directions purified.
Her divine might shakes all,
Families and realms secure.
The heroic Heavenly Consort,
Auspicious in this enlightened age.
Roaming the Three Realms,
Pervading all spirits.
Wind and thunder guard her,
Generals and soldiers sustain her.

Descending to the mortal realm, she annihilates disasters and wrongs.
Below, she reaches the earthly prisons, notifying all divine administrators.
The wrongfully oppressed are avenged,
Those who kill are executed.
Those who give are loved,
Those who scheme are pursued.
With wholehearted reverence,
All things flourish in harmony.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands!

Thereupon, the Heavenly Consort, having heard the gatha, bowed before the Heavenly Venerable and proclaimed her vows:

First, she vows to ferry boats and ships safely to the other shore.
Second, she vows to protect merchants and travelers, ensuring their peace and joy.
Third, she vows to expel malevolent spirits, forever dispelling them.
Fourth, she vows to eradicate calamities and misfortunes, purifying households.
Fifth, she vows to hunt down traitors and thieves, banishing their traces and forms.
Sixth, she vows to capture and execute the wicked, eradicating the violent and obstinate.
Seventh, she vows to save the people and protect the realm, bringing them great peace.
Eighth, she vows to absolve sins and dissolve transgressions, freeing all from karmic retribution.
Ninth, she vows to assist in difficult childbirths, ensuring the safety of mother and child.
Tenth, she vows to shelter the virtuous, sparing them from unjust harm.
Eleventh, she vows to guard the Dharma realm, bringing timely winds and rains.
Twelfth, she vows that all who turn to her shall be protected and blessed with peace.
Thirteenth, she vows that those who cultivate the Dao shall achieve fruition in their practice.
Fourteenth, she vows that those who seek office and promotion shall attain rank and prosperity.
Fifteenth, she vows that the departed shall transcend suffering, and the Nine Dark Realms shall know rest.

Then, the Venerable Lord, having heard the Heavenly Consort’s vows, commanded the Mysterious and Wondrous Jade Maiden to bestow upon her the title of **Unbounded Dipper-Assisting Governance and Universal Salvation Heavenly Consort**. He granted her a pearl crown and cloud-embroidered slippers, jade pendants and a ritual scepter, crimson robes with azure sashes, a dragon-drawn chariot and phoenix palanquin, a sword and seal. Before and behind, her retinue was majestic and solemn. Her forces included the **Yellow Wasp Marshal**, the **White Horse General**, the **Ding-Ren Envoys**, the **Tamarix Incense Great Sage**, and the **Yan the Great Deity**, who possessed the **Thousand-Mile Eye** to detect treachery and the **Favorable Wind Ear** to report affairs. Blue-robed youths, water bureau officials, and divine aides bolstered her might, manifesting the true transformation.

Should any man or woman reverently invoke her name, or perform purification rites and establish altars, or maintain a pure household, or recite this sutra once—even a hundred or a thousand times—over rivers and seas, they shall be delivered from disasters, malevolent spirits annihilated, illnesses healed, official misfortunes forever stilled. In battle, evil shall depart; in prisons, peace shall reign. Bandits shall not invade, slander shall not harm. Silkworms and crops shall yield a hundredfold, livestock shall multiply, wealth and emoluments overflow, commerce thrive. Merchants and traders, seeking treasures, shall traverse the seas in safety, free from fear. Those seeking office or undertaking affairs shall achieve their desires.

When the Heavenly Venerable had finished expounding this sutra, the devas, dragons, ghosts, and spirits all vowed to uphold it. Thereupon, the **Vast Salvation Perfected One** recited another gatha:

The Golden Portal’s Sacred Empress,
Enfeoffed to assist the Dipper.
Her divine traces manifest among heaven and humankind,
Mountains and rivers nurture her excellence.
The third month’s *chen* day,
The waning moon answers the season.
Protecting the realm, her spirit endures,
A myriad lifetimes proclaimed in homage.
What blessing does she not bestow?
What peril does she not rescue?
In harmony with the Dao, true and real,
The Jade Emperor cherishes and protects her.
Recite this sutra in accord,
And demonic spirits shall bow their heads.
Burn incense, scatter flowers,
Perform purification rites, establish altars.
In times of urgent peril,
Pray devoutly.
Receive and uphold it as prescribed,
And all shall be answered.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands!

The Dipper Immortal, True Empress,
Ranked among the Nine Heavens.
Above, she aids the Golden Portal,
Below, she reaches the springs’ source.
The Seven Primes’ Envoys,
In harmony with the Dao’s spontaneity.
Mortals revere and turn to her,
Their blessings boundless.
The boundless heavens,
Bestow blessings without end.
The heroic Heavenly Consort,
Her responses boundless.
Between heaven and earth,
All honor her name.
Her pure virtue manifests protection,
The realm knows peace.
Your servant now obeys and upholds,
Forever preserving prosperity and integrity.

When the Vast Salvation had finished reciting this gatha, the Wondrous Conduct Heavenly Consort bowed before the Heavenly Venerable, took her leave, and departed. The spirits of the Three Realms, devas, dragons, gods, and ghosts all rejoiced, faithfully receiving and practicing it.

**Heavenly Consort’s Salvific Talisman**
The talisman’s incantation proclaims:
Dipper-Assisting Perfected One,
Responsive and transformative in birth.
One talisman, one draught of water,
Saves and aids the myriad people.
Dispels disasters, removes obstacles,
Forever ensures peace and tranquility.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands!

The Celestial Empress,
Descended from the Northern Dipper.
Her traces manifest in the Three Realms,
Her spirit flows through the vast seas.
Divine transformations, wondrous powers,
Invoked by name, she brings salvation.
Thirty-two marks,
Her countenance perfect and complete.
Responsive to every thought,
Most sacred, most divine.
Her majestic radiance resplendent,
Protecting the realm, sheltering the people.
Sea winds stir the waves,
Her blessings descend upon prayer.
With wholehearted reverence,
Her true form manifests.
Appearing in the void,
Commanding the heavenly hosts.
Her divine might descends,
Ghosts submit, spirits tremble.
The **Putian Earth Lord**,
Sacred transformation in the bamboo grove.
The **Northern Dipper Great Sage**,
Drives away malevolent spirits.
Dispels disasters, scatters misfortunes,
Households and realm secure.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands!

The **Divine Talisman of the Heavenly Consort**—when in urgent need, burn incense, recite the preceding incantation seven times, inscribe this talisman, and grind it with well-drawn water and frankincense to consume. Naturally, all shall be well, and none shall fail to receive response.

Thus concludes the *Most High Lord Lao’s Scripture of the Heavenly Consort’s Efficacious Salvation from Suffering*.
