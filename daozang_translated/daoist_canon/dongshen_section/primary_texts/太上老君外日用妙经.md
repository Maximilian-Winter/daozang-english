**The Wondrous Scripture of the Supreme Lord Lao’s External Daily Practices**

Revere Heaven and Earth, honor the sun and moon.
Fear the laws of the state, follow the kingly Way, and be filial to parents.
Be humble toward superiors, harmonious with inferiors.
Do good deeds, cease evil ones.
Encourage others in learning, dissuade them from wrongdoing.
The wise know peril; the full, overflow.
Stillness brings constant peace; frugality, constant sufficiency.
Caution spares worry; forbearance, disgrace.
Shun extravagance, pursue truth and substance.
Conceal others’ faults, extol their virtues.
Practice convenience, harmonize with neighbors.
Draw near to the worthy and good, distance yourself from sensual indulgence.
The poor guard their lot; the rich bestow kindness.
Act with impartiality, never rely on power.
Always restrain the self, never envy or encroach.
In youth, avoid greed; root out cunning and deceit.
Resolve grievances when encountered, accumulate good deeds.
Keep promises without fail, speak with sincerity.
Remember the orphaned and widowed, relieve the poor and destitute.
Save those in peril, accumulate hidden virtue.
Practice kindness and mercy, refrain from taking life.
Heed loyal words, never deceive the heart.
Follow these practices, and you may ascend beyond.
