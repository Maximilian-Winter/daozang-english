**The Scripture of the Great Dipper’s Mighty Stalwart Reciting the Demon-Subduing Divine Incantation, Spoken by the Most High**

The Lord Lao said:
The Great Dao is formless, ever dwelling in the profound and obscure. It is the sagest among sages, the most numinous among the numinous, encompassing the boundless and nurturing all beings. Thus, those endowed with sentience receive its mandate, and those with consciousness comprehend its nature. Those who defy it perish; those who accord with it live.

If you wish to ascend beyond the mortal realm and avoid the nether darkness, purify your mind with utmost sincerity and recite this scripture day and night. Recite it a hundred times, and your hun and po will be at peace. Recite it a thousand times, and dragon spirits will guard your form. Recite it ten thousand times, and evil spirits will be subdued and vanquished. All wishes shall be granted, all deeds shall succeed. Malevolent ghosts will be subdued, and wayward spirits bound. Those who see me shall die; those who hear me shall tremble. Those who slight me shall be destroyed; those who revere me shall live.

After ten thousand recitations, you shall attain spiritual freedom, your entire body shall feel light, and all desires shall be fulfilled. You shall ride cloud chariots, pay homage to Heaven and Earth, and be ranked among the immortals. Your descendants shall receive blessings, and your household shall prosper.

If worldly disciples can listen with sincerity, I shall not deceive you. But you must cultivate utmost devotion. Whether dwelling in the wilds, encountering warfare, facing calamity or misfortune, besieged within a walled city, or meeting tigers, wolves, venomous snakes, or malevolent ghosts and demonic spirits—amidst all terrors, simply recite this scripture. Do not chant loudly; let no sound escape. Purify your mind, concentrate your intent, and store up sincerity. I shall dispatch divine soldiers to instantly dissolve disasters and misfortunes, and blessings shall naturally arise.

All divine names, when urgently invoked, shall respond:
One hundred thousand Heavenly Masters extend life,
One hundred thousand Perfected Ones record destiny,
One hundred thousand Golden Lads guard the hun-soul,
One hundred thousand Jade Maidens protect the form,
One hundred thousand Heavenly Soldiers devour ghosts,
One hundred thousand Mighty Warriors consume spirits,
One hundred thousand Generals slay demons,
One hundred thousand Diamond Gods bind evil,
One hundred thousand Dragon Kings rage in fury,
Thunder Lords wield lightning in crisscrossing bolts.

All they encounter shall be devoured, regardless of name. Waves shall darken the sun, mountains and peaks shall shift, winds and thunder shall roar, and thunderbolts shall crash. The Five Emperors and Five Peaks shall follow the Six Jia, and the Six Ding shall be commanded as well. At their approach, demonic ghosts shall split their skulls, and evil spirits shall have no place to hide. Tigers and wolves shall flee in haste, and blades shall inspire no fear.

Those who recite must focus their minds and not treat this lightly. After ten thousand recitations, the Dao shall be perfected, and you shall naturally journey to Penglai and Yingzhou. The merit of the Great Emperor has been practiced by the Five Emperors.

*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances of the Most High and the Mysterious Capital!*
