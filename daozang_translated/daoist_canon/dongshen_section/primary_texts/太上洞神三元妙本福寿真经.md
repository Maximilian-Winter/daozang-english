### **The Supreme Cavern-Spirit Wondrous Root of the Three Primes Sutra of Blessing and Longevity**

#### **Chapter on the Revelation of the Three Luminaries**
At that time, the Great Sage Ancestor, the Mysterious Origin, the Dao-Virtue Heavenly Worthy, the Most High Lord Lao, resided in the Purple Tenuity Heavenly Palace of the Grand Clarity Immortal Realm. The Heavenly Emperors of all heavens, the great celestial immortals, the Perfected Lords of the Three Primes, and the boundless host of immortals and sages arrayed themselves in ranks to pay homage. Celestial soldiers, jade lads, and golden maidens stood in attendance.

Then, the Great Perfected of Penetrating Mystery and Supreme Virtue stepped forth and addressed the assembly: "Your servant has heard that when the Five Ultimates first divided, the One True [Dao] gave rise to transformation; when the Two Modes moved in vigor, the Five Qi were generated. All this was governed by the Three Primes and administered by the Three Officials. From the four directions and eight extremities to the Three Realms and ten directions, from mountains, rivers, and seas to sages, common folk, birds, beasts, dragons, fish, grasses, trees, and insects—all that flies, hides, moves, or grows, all that waxes or wanes, all birth and transformation—none lies beyond the dominion of the Three Primes.

All beings within the bounds of existence, from emperors above to the myriad people below, their glory or obscurity, prosperity or decline, wealth or longevity, health or peace, fortune or misfortune, success or failure, calamity or blessing—all are determined by the Three Primes. Your servant, in his ignorance, does not understand: by what cause or virtue do the Perfected Lords of the Three Primes hold the pivot of creation? Through the transformations of past and present, enduring across kalpas, their numinous responses to good and evil, public and private, are precise to the finest detail. I humbly beseech the Great Compassion to reveal this in subtle detail, that all heavenly beings may attain clarity and understanding, and devote themselves to cultivation and reverence."

Having finished his address, he bowed nine times, knelt in reverence, and held his jade tablet, awaiting the response.

At that moment, the Most High, enveloped in golden light, remained silent and motionless. Then, with a faint smile, he gazed upon the Peerless Wondrous Dao Heavenly Worthy of the Primordial Text and the Golden Portal Emperor. The Emperor, intuiting the Most High’s secret intent, admonished the Great Perfected of Penetrating Mystery and Supreme Virtue:

"I have heard that before the beginning, before heaven and earth, the Dao was not the constant Dao. It cannot be seen, nor can it be named; it cannot be heard. Profound beyond profundity, it is the secret accord of the subtle and imperceptible. Wondrous, supremely wondrous—it silently conforms to the utmost emptiness and stillness. Within the dark and boundless expanse of the Three Primes, within the tranquil and vast womb of the Five Ultimates, the Perfect True [Dao] presides over the primordial chaos, governing the Great One within the undifferentiated. It is neither being nor non-being, neither sound nor form. Wondrously present yet non-existent, it stands alone and unchanging; truly non-existent yet profoundly abiding. Forced to name it, we call it 'that which precedes the Emperor of Heaven'; we designate it as 'the Origin of the Primordial Sovereign.'

When the Great Ultimate first arose, the Three Primes brought forth transformation; when the primordial chaos was cleaved, the One Qi was generated. The Three Extremes established the center, the Two Modes settled into their positions. The Emperor governs the warp and woof; the spirit controls the pivot. Thus, heaven first congealed as water, and earth unified its source. In the blended harmony of the primordial, the primordial Qi fused at the center. The transforming potter’s wheel turned in subtle motion, and the impulse of life endured. Therefore, the Lords of the Three Primes hold the offices of governance, patrolling and examining all. From the immortal officials and Perfected Ones to the celestial and terrestrial deities, the Water Mother, the Three Realms, the myriad spirits, and all beings—good and evil, human and otherwise—all are subject to their jurisdiction."

#### **Chapter on the Heavenly Official’s Sincere Governance**
The Heavenly Official embodies the essence of the One, centered and pure, governing with vigor and the four virtues of the primordial: origination, flourishing, fruition, and firmness. Thunder roars, winds howl, clouds drift, and rain descends. Being and non-being alternate in an endless cycle. The potter’s wheel of creation blends the One Qi, generating life without end. Rising and falling, extending and contracting, it sustains the four seasons in ceaseless motion. The mandate is executed under Shaohao; perfect benevolence emanates from the Valley of Light. Stirring the winds of kindness, mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees flourish in beauty. Fusing the primordial Qi, all that flies, hides, moves, or grows attains harmony. The power of great virtue achieves the most wondrous transformations; the mysterious benevolence manifests boundless efficacy. It holds the handle of great generation in the heavenly courts and governs the mechanism of primordial transformation in the heavenly bureaus. The Emperor’s virtue is boundless; the Perfected One’s merit is infinite.

All mountain and peak lords, city gods, and earth spirits within the world, along with all improper deities, spirits, and beings, are subject to examination, promotion, demotion, reward, or punishment.

#### **Chapter on the Earthly Official’s Nurturing of the Root**
The Dao is the mystery of the myriad things; Earth is the foundation of all beings. The Earthly Official fuses the Five Ultimates within the profound and obscure, nurturing the ten thousand existences amid ceaseless transformation. Above, it receives the Dao of Heaven, embodying utmost softness yet acting with firmness. At its center, it contains the primordial yellow, its function vast and its subtlety boundless. It encompasses the eight wastes and ten expanses, bearing the four seas and nine provinces. It embraces the myriad forms in transformation and preserves the wondrous body of life. It connects the veins of the nine springs and unites the subtle mechanisms of the profound. Mountains and marshes exchange qi; winds and clouds gather in secluded valleys. Heaven and Earth wondrously unite, stirring thunder and lightning to cleave the vast sky. To the east, it reaches Fusang; to the west, Fine Willow. To the south, it extends to the Southern Pole; to the north, it borders the Northern Capital. At its center, it supports the sacred peaks and renowned mountains, above which rise the immortal realms of Kunlun.

It propels the cycles of yin and yang, obscuring and revealing the sun and moon’s ascent and descent, decline and obstruction. Thus, winter’s storage and spring’s release bring peace and prosperity. All beings—sentient and insentient—are governed by the great image of the Central Yellow. Even the most minute forms are born from the fertile earth. Therefore, the merit of the Earth Mother is immeasurable; the virtue of the Central Emperor is boundless.

All people’s conduct, whether active or withdrawn, receive the blessing of Earth’s nurturing virtue. In life and death, rest and repose, all are sheltered by its vast and encompassing grace. All improper deities, demons, specters, and malevolent spirits within the nine provinces, eight wastes, mountains, rivers, plains, and wilds that harm the people are subject to examination and punishment. All sentient and insentient beings, their birth, growth, and nurturing, are governed by the transformations of creation.

**The Water Official’s Return to the Source Chapter**

The Water Official is one root of the great Dao, vast and flowing through ten thousand streams. Its sagely virtue is as deep and clear as the boundless sea; its divine power is as still and pure as the Jade Pool. It dwells unseen in the primal vastness of primordial chaos, in the uncarved simplicity of the undifferentiated void. Its depths are unfathomable, its surging waves blending with the great emptiness; its clarity knows no bounds, its stillness resting even before the earth took form. It is yielding yet inexhaustible in use, adaptable as square or round, profound beyond measure. Though it fills all things, it never overflows; though it comes and goes, it never breaks its trust. Its nature is soft, yet its essence is utterly firm; its tendency is downward, yet its service is impartial. Its hidden depths cradle gold, jade, and pearls; its flowing currents nurture dragons, fish, and giant clams. It penetrates the finest crevices, encompasses the vastest expanses. In its divine transformations, it can topple mountains and overturn peaks; in its power to overcome the hard and strong, it pierces metal and stone. The Dao sustains the world, bearing ships of ten thousand bushels to illuminate the age, reflecting the bright moon across a thousand rivers. Such is its nature—rising and falling naturally. Thus, the highest good is like water, benefiting all things without contention. Its divinity is like heaven, enduring through the ages without change. Vast, pure, and clear, boundlessly gentle and harmonious, it communes with heaven and earth, shares the same body as the empty void. It nourishes all things, fosters all life.

Yet the common flow fails to comprehend the grace of its vast bounty, offering only sighs of awe at its expanse. All rivers, seas, streams, springs, brooks, and ravines; all wells, valleys, pools, and deep ponds; all dragon palaces and ocean treasuries; all water-mother spirits, venomous dragons, flood serpents, giant clams, fish, turtles, water monsters, and malevolent spirits that bring harm to humanity—all are subject to examination, punishment, and execution.

**The Three Primes’ Subtle Essence Chapter**

The primordial, supreme, most true, undifferentiated, Central Yellow’s primordial *qi*; the profound, pure, and luminous primordial essence; the wondrous Dao of the Radiant Valley’s azure splendor—such are the Three Primes. Human beings are likewise constituted. If, in the world, the faithful and virtuous, who have long cultivated merit and virtue, come to hear these subtle mysteries, their illusions melt like ice, their bodies and minds become pure and still. They nurture primordial essence, refine primordial *qi*, and illuminate the primordial spirit. Merging spirit, *qi*, and essence, they concentrate them in the Celestial Valley, returning to the wondrous Dao of the limitless and most true. Through eons, they endure, attaining boundless longevity and boundless blessings. Their sagely merit and mysterious virtue are beyond comprehension.

On behalf of the Most High, I now proclaim the compassionate and wondrous teaching, solemnly expounding the **Incantation of the Three Primes**:

Great is the Primordial Origin,
The wondrous Dao is naturally so.
True Yang blazes in hidden radiance,
True Yin is profoundly mysterious.
The true sovereign dwells in the undifferentiated,
From the ultimate beginning, the heavens arise.
The Primordial Sovereign divides the Five Ultimates,
Establishing the pole to govern the Three Primes.
The Three Primes fuse the Five *Qi*,
Creating and transforming humanity, earth, and heaven.
The Three Powers intermingle in harmony,
And the myriad things are born in ceaseless generation.
Humankind is most wise and noble,
Their true nature embodies the highest heaven.
In non-action, they attain perfect purity,
Upholding the fullness of Dao and virtue.
Pure as flawless jade,
Firm and bright as unyielding gold.
Like earth, they embody gentle and profound virtue,
Like water, they adapt with perfect skill.
Their nature is originally without birth or death,
But the arising of the heart creates bias.
The four non-essentials and eight consciousnesses
Give rise to love and aversion, deluded conditions.
The sea of suffering churns in endless waves,
Rolling on to drown the true source.
The Most High, moved by compassion, saves,
Building the Dharma-ship as a mighty vessel.
It ferries people to the Dao’s shore,
Yet some, in madness, refuse.
Adrift without direction,
They willingly sink into the dark springs.
Through the cycles of rebirth in the realms of suffering,
The karma-fire burns through long eons.
Recklessly abandoned, unrepentant,
Their ignorance is deeply pitiable.
When the heart’s breath is without birth or death,
The heart’s purity dissolves karmic transgressions.
When the heart is empty, it transcends the eight consciousnesses,
When the heart is pure, all faults vanish.
When the heart is pure, without falsehood,
The heart’s clarity radiates perfect wisdom.
When the heart is unobstructed,
The heart’s understanding precedes all phenomena.
Simply turn the heart toward rectitude,
And golden lotuses bloom in the fire.
Deluded, one becomes a lowly ghost;
Awakened, one ascends as a lofty immortal.
Guard the treasure of spirit and *qi*,
And the Three Primes return to their original state.
Boundless is the great merit,
Its subtlety beyond words.
Wash the heart with single-minded devotion,
Purify the heart with utmost reverence and sincerity.
Sincerity evokes response,
And all naturally attain benefit and integrity.
The true wondrous image is not empty,
Without color, scent, or sound.
Its divine transformations are unfathomable,
In stillness and clarity, all is luminously revealed.
It releases all karmic afflictions,
Dissolves all calamities and misfortunes.
In action and repose, ever pure and auspicious,
Blessed with fortune, emolument, longevity, and well-being.
The subtle Dao of the Three Primes,
Brings great illumination as you will.
Bow in unwavering sincerity,
Reverently believe and diligently practice.
May the heart’s sovereign ever be at peace,
And the world forever know harmony.

**The Three Officials’ Compassionate Vow Chapter**

At that time, the Lords of the Three Primes and Three Officials, having heard this scripture and incantation, performed the ninefold obeisance before the Most High Dao and, holding their jade tablets, made this vow:

“We, who govern the Three Primes and traverse the world in examination and judgment, always embody the Dao in purity and non-action, yet we do not presume to know our own virtue. Now, having heard this Dharma-teaching, we vow to propagate it throughout the world. For all good and virtuous men and women who receive and uphold the Three Primes’ precepts, purify body and mind, recite and savor this scripture, reverently chant this true incantation, and practice with diligence—we, in accordance with the Most High’s decree, hereby proclaim to all the celestial immortals and sages, the officials and bureaus of the Three Primes, and the deities of the Three Realms and Ten Directions: If there are those in the world who hold and recite this scripture and incantation, we shall respond to their sincerity, hastening to protect and defend them. We shall rescue them from water, fire, warfare, banditry, illness, and suffering; from the perils of childbirth, boats, rafts, and all calamities and injuries. We shall absolve their past and present karmic transgressions, sins, and obstacles, safeguarding their progress toward the supreme, most true, and wondrous Dao. We shall cause all long-standing ailments to vanish, their spirits to become clear and robust, their forms and essences to be healthy and secure, and their blessings and longevity to increase.”

Having made this vow, they bowed again in reverence.

At that moment, the Great Perfected of Penetrating Mystery and Supreme Virtue, together with the Celestial Emperors, Heavenly Immortals, the Sages and Immortals of the Three Primes, and the innumerable Perfected, all joined their voices in praise. Through eons uncounted, they had never heard such wondrous teachings. Having awakened to the great origin of the Three Primes and the vows of the Three Officials, they were filled with true joy and delight. Heavenly music resounded in harmony, celestial melodies of subtle beauty filled the air, and heavenly flowers and fragrances suffused the space. The Perfected and Immortals of the Ten Directions bowed in reverence and returned to their original abodes, universally wishing that humans and gods alike would reverently believe and practice.

The *Supreme Cavern-Spirit Wondrous Origin Three Primes Blessing and Longevity True Scripture* concludes.

**Postface**

The original celestial nature is pure, still, empty, and luminous, utterly devoid of desire or emotion—how could there be good or evil? Yet when a single thought arises, the distinction between deviance and rectitude is made.

In high antiquity, rulers, ministers, common folk, and all beings were utterly sincere, simple, and unadulterated, without duplicity of heart. All possessed a single virtue, and naturally the Three Primes flowed in harmony, their original nature wise and numinous. From the middle ages onward, however, cunning and cleverness prevailed, and the heart-mind drifted into delusion. Greed, anger, competitiveness, jealousy, contention, deceit, falsity, treachery, arrogance, extravagance, and ignorance arose, with no awareness or repentance to the end.

Human desires grew excessive, and celestial nature was lost. Thus, the innocent suffered calamity, the good endured misfortune, and the afflicted found no redress. As the perverse *qi* of high and low clashed, epidemics, warfare, famine, banditry, malevolent spirits, demonic apparitions, and disasters arose in concert, leading to illness, injury, disability, and premature death. Alas!

Our Supreme Venerable One, moved by compassion, and the Celestial Thearch, in their boundless grace, entrusted the Three Officials and the Heavenly Ministries with the duty of inspecting and evaluating all during the Three Primes’ circuits. Their merits and transgressions were made manifest, wrongs were righted, sins were pardoned, and suffering was relieved. Those who performed virtuous deeds were granted blessings, emolument, and longevity, their descendants becoming wise and illustrious. Those who committed evil were punished with destruction, their descendants becoming foolish and debased. The response of sagely impartiality was as swift as an echo, natural and infallible.

This scripture embodies the wondrous essence and sublime function of the Supreme Venerable One’s Three Primes Dao and virtue, its sacred power and divine efficacy. It enables those of resolve who cultivate the true and illuminate the origin to return to simplicity and restore the mysterious wind of high antiquity, thereby attaining the wondrous Dao of utmost truth.

Having received and transmitted the ancient text, I collated and divided it into chapters to make its profound principles easily understood and the Dao-heart clearly discerned. Above all, I pray for the eternal stability of the imperial reign and the boundless prosperity of the sagely sovereign. Next, I wish that the faithful may purify their hearts, recite and uphold this scripture with sincerity, and practice it with devotion, so as not to betray the sagely compassion of the Supreme Venerable One, whose Dao saves the world and whose Three Officials’ vows bring blessings to humanity.

When Layman Wang of Zhong’an first beheld and sincerely recited this scripture, he rejoiced and vowed to raise funds for its embroidered printing, widely disseminating it to transform humans and gods alike and guide them to the true Dao. How could this be a small contribution?

On the yang solstice of the *jiazi* year of the Taiding era, the Purple-Robed Adept of the Golden Balustrade, your humble servant Miao Shanshi, bows and respectfully composes this postface.
