The Highest Lord Lao said:
Heaven and earth unite their essences, yin and yang distribute transformation, and the myriad things are born. Inheriting past karmic conditions, they partake of the singular Dao/Way of spirit. Through the harmony of father and mother, humans receive life.

In the first month, it is a *bao* (embryonic sac), where essence and blood congeal.
In the second month, it becomes a *tai* (fetus), its form beginning as a germ.
In the third month, the yang spirit stirs as the three *hun* (ethereal souls), quickening to life.
In the fourth month, the yin spirit solidifies as the seven *po* (corporeal souls), stabilizing the form.
In the fifth month, the five phases divide into the organs, settling the spirit.
In the sixth month, the six pitch-pipes determine the viscera, nourishing the numinous.
In the seventh month, the seven essences open the orifices, illuminating with radiance.
In the eighth month, the eight luminous spirits are complete, descending with true numinosity.
In the ninth month, palaces and chambers array themselves, fixing each essence in place.
In the tenth month, qi is full, and the ten thousand images are perfected.

The primordial harmony feeds it as sustenance, ceaseless in its timing.

The Supreme Unity Sovereign resides in the head as the Mud-Pellet Lord, governing all spirits.
The illuminating life-awareness spirit is humanity’s *hun*.
The Controller of Destiny dwells in the heart, receiving the primordial of life.
The Non-Flourishing One abides on the left, governing the three *hun*.
The White Prime One abides on the right, restraining the seven *po*.
The Peach Child resides in the navel, deepening the root of essence.
It illuminates the hundred joints, generating the hundred spirits.
Thus, throughout the body, the spirits are never empty.

Primordial qi enters through the nose, irrigating the Mud-Pellet.
Thus, the spirit is luminous, and the form is firmly at peace.
Movement and stillness, activity and rest—all hinge upon the heart.
Thus, life is said to have its cause.

I contemplate internally, and each is distinctly divided.

The heart is restraint, the master of the body.
The heart can restrain and regulate, keeping form and spirit from deviance.
The heart is spirit—its transformations are unfathomable, thus it has no fixed form.

Therefore, the five viscera store the five spirits:
The *hun* in the liver, the *po* in the lungs, essence in the kidneys, will in the spleen, and spirit in the heart.
Their names differ, but they are designated according to their locations.

The heart is fire. The essence of the great yang of the south governs fire; above, it is Mars, and below, it corresponds to the heart.
Its color is red, its three lobes like a lotus flower. The spirit’s luminosity anchors there, whence its name derives.

This spirit is neither green nor yellow,
neither large nor small, neither short nor long,
neither curved nor straight, neither soft nor hard,
neither thick nor thin, neither round nor square.
Its transformations are unfathomable, blending yin and yang.
Vast, it encompasses heaven and earth; minute, it enters the tip of a hair.
Restrained, it is upright; unrestrained, it is wild.
Pure and still, it lives; turbid and restless, it perishes.
Bright, it illuminates the eight directions; dark, it strays in one corner.

If one can but remain empty and tranquil, the Dao/Way of life naturally endures.
Eternally preserving non-action, one’s body will flourish.

As it is formless, none can name it.
Fortune and misfortune, good and ill—all arise from it.

Thus, the sage establishes ruler and subject, clarifies rewards and punishments, appoints officials, and institutes laws and measures, all to instruct humanity. Yet humanity is difficult to tame—it depends entirely on the heart.
If the heart is pure and still, then no misfortune arises.

Thus, drifting through the cycle of birth and death, sinking into evil destinies—all stems from the heart.
Deluded thoughts, hatred and love, grasping and rejecting, clinging and attachment—gradually, these entangle one, binding ever tighter, until one cannot escape, leading to destruction.
Like an ox or horse pulling a heavy load into the mire, sinking deeper with each step, unable to free itself, it meets its end in death.
Humans are the same.

At the beginning of life, the spirit is primordially pure and still, limpid and free of defilement.
Once it receives and inhabits form, the form is stained by the six emotions:
The eyes covet beauty, the ears indulge in sound,
the mouth craves flavor, the nose seeks fragrance,
the mind follows desire, the body seeks plumpness and lightness.
From this, one drifts and wanders, unable to awaken.

The sage, moved by compassion, establishes teachings to transform and guide, causing one to contemplate internally and settle the heart.

The Highest Lord Lao said:
Observe carefully this body—it arises from emptiness,
through the convergence of conditions, the accumulation of essence and the gathering of qi.
Riding karmic forces, the spirit descends, harmonizing to receive life.
It models heaven and earth, inhales yin and exhales yang,
distributes the five phases to correspond with the four seasons.
The eyes are the sun and moon, the hair the stars,
the eyebrows the canopy of flowers, the head Mount Kunlun.
Palaces and chambers are arrayed, spirits are settled within.
Among the ten thousand things, humans are the most numinous.
Nature and life unite with the Dao/Way—humans ought to cherish them.
Contemplate internally this body—only humans are noble.
Yet failing to honor themselves, they recklessly defile with dust,
becoming filthy, foul, and turbid, disturbing form and spirit.

What is distant, what is close? Observe carefully the self and others.
Guard the Dao/Way and attain long life; do good and preserve authenticity.
The foolish of the world toil endlessly, pointlessly enduring hardship.

The Highest Lord Lao said:
Receiving one’s allotment from the Dao/Way is called *ming* (destiny).
From the One, receiving form is called *xing* (nature).
That which engages with things is called the *xin* (heart-mind).
The heart-mind having recollections is called *yi* (intention).
What intention produces is called *zhi* (will).
Knowing all things is called *zhi* (wisdom).
Wisdom pervading the ten thousand things is called *hui* (discernment).
Moving to nurture the body is called *hun* (ethereal soul).
Stillness to stabilize the form is called *po* (corporeal soul).
Flowing through bones and flesh is called *xue* (blood).
Preserving spirit and nourishing qi is called *jing* (essence).
When qi is clear and swift, it is called *rong* (nutritive qi).
When qi is turbid and slow, it is called *wei* (defensive qi).
Encompassing the hundred bones is called *shen* (body).
The ten thousand images fully manifest is called *xing* (form).
Being solid and bounded is called *zhi* (substance).
Appearance that can be modeled is called *ti* (structure).
Having measure in size is called *qu* (frame).
Thoughts beyond reckoning are called *shen* (spirit).
Responding to transformations from afar is called *ling* (numinosity).
Qi entering the body is called *sheng* (life).
Spirit departing the body is called *si* (death).
That which communicates life is called the *Dao/Way*.

The Dao/Way exists yet has no form; it is non-existent yet possesses sentiment. Its transformations are unfathomable, connecting with the numinous and all living beings. Within the human body, it becomes spirit and clarity—what is called the heart-mind. Thus, to teach people to cultivate the Dao/Way is to teach them to cultivate the heart-mind; to teach them to cultivate the heart-mind is to teach them to cultivate the Dao/Way.

The Dao/Way cannot be seen, so it is made manifest through life. Life cannot be eternal, so the Dao/Way is used to preserve it. If life perishes, the Dao/Way is abandoned; if the Dao/Way is abandoned, life perishes. When life and the Dao/Way unite as one, there is everlasting life, transcendence, and becoming a spirit-immortal.

People cannot long preserve this because they fail to inwardly contemplate the heart-mind. With inward contemplation unceasing, the Dao/Way and life endure forever.

The Venerable Lord said: People wander and stray into evil paths, sinking into filth and defilement, because the six emotions give rise to delusion and generate the six consciousnesses. The six consciousnesses discriminate, binding them with attachment and aversion, coming and going, grasping and rejecting, staining them with afflictions, and thus they remain far from the Dao/Way. Therefore, inwardly contemplate how the six consciousnesses arise from the six desires. From whence do the consciousnesses arise? They arise from desire. From whence does desire arise? It arises from consciousness. Deluded thoughts and inverted views give rise to consciousness. This is also called "spontaneity" or "non-action," originally empty and tranquil, fundamentally without consciousness. With consciousness comes discrimination, giving rise to all perverse views. Once perverse views arise, all is affliction. Entangled and bound, they wander in the cycle of birth and death, forever losing the Dao/Way.

The Venerable Lord said: The Dao/Way has no birth or death, but form has birth and death. Thus, when we speak of birth and death, it pertains to form, not to the Dao/Way. Form is born because it attains the Dao/Way; form dies because it loses the Dao/Way. If one can preserve life and guard the Dao/Way, they will endure forever without perishing.

The Venerable Lord said: If one can constantly keep the heart-mind clear and tranquil, the Dao/Way will naturally come to reside. When the Dao/Way comes to reside, spirit and clarity abide in the body; when spirit and clarity abide in the body, life does not perish.

People constantly desire life yet cannot empty the heart-mind; they constantly fear death yet cannot preserve spirit. This is like desiring nobility yet not employing the Dao/Way, seeking wealth yet not pursuing treasure, wishing for speed yet not moving one’s feet, or longing for fatness yet not eating one’s fill.

The Venerable Lord said: The Dao/Way is attained through the heart-mind, and the heart-mind is illuminated by the Dao/Way. When the heart-mind is illuminated, the Dao/Way descends; when the Dao/Way descends, the heart-mind is unobstructed. The spirit and clarity within the body are like fire depending on a lamp. Light arises from fire, fire from the wick, the wick from the oil’s moisture, and the oil from the lamp’s vessel. If any of these four are lacking, how can light arise? It is also like light relying on spirit for illumination, spirit depending on the heart-mind for abiding, the heart-mind arising from form, and form being perfected by the Dao/Way. If any one of these is insufficient, upon what can light depend?

Thus, what is called spirit and clarity refers to the eyes seeing, the ears hearing, the mind knowing, and the heart-mind perceiving—discerning the principles of things, knowing even the most subtle and minute, all made bright by spirit. Therefore, it is called spirit and clarity.

The Venerable Lord said: To empty the heart-mind is to dispel its fullness; to have no heart-mind is to remove its existence; to stabilize the heart-mind is to make it unmovable; to pacify the heart-mind is to keep it from danger; to still the heart-mind is to prevent it from disorder; to rectify the heart-mind is to keep it from deviance; to purify the heart-mind is to keep it from turbidity; to cleanse the heart-mind is to keep it from defilement. All these use what exists to remove what should be removed.

The four perceptions: A straightforward heart-mind does not waver; an even heart-mind has no highs or lows; a bright heart-mind has no darkness or obscurity; an unobstructed heart-mind has no blockages. All these arise from spontaneity.

To roughly speak of these principles, the rest can be contemplated.

The Venerable Lord said: Knowing the Dao/Way is easy; believing in the Dao/Way is difficult. Believing in the Dao/Way is easy; practicing the Dao/Way is difficult. Practicing the Dao/Way is easy; attaining the Dao/Way is difficult. Attaining the Dao/Way is easy; guarding the Dao/Way is difficult. Only by guarding it without loss can one abide forever.

The Venerable Lord said: The Dao/Way cannot be transmitted through words; it is received through the mouth and attained by constantly keeping the heart-mind empty and spirit tranquil, so that the Dao/Way naturally comes to reside. The foolish do not understand this. They exhaust their bodies, distress their hearts, toil their wills, and agitate their spirits, yet the Dao/Way grows ever more distant, and their spirits grow ever more sorrowful. Those who turn their backs on the Dao/Way to seek it must be cautious in their choices.

The Venerable Lord said: The Dao/Way values long preservation. Guard spirit and secure the root; let essence and qi not scatter, and purity remain undivided. When form and spirit unite with the Dao/Way, one ascends to Kunlun in flight. Born of the prior heavens, preserved by the posterior heavens, entering and exiting without interval, not passing through its gate. Blowing yin and warming yang, controlling the *po* and restraining the *hun*. For a hundred million years, one’s kin endure; for a thousand generations, one’s descendants remain. As yellow dust rises on all sides, the perfected one rides a sheep. In golden halls and jade chambers, one sends off the old and welcomes the new.

The Venerable Lord said: The Dao/Way of inner contemplation stills the spirit and settles the mind. No chaotic thoughts arise, and no deviant delusions invade. Body and things are firmly secured. With eyes closed, one seeks within; inside and out, all is emptiness and silence. The spirit’s Dao/Way grows subtle and profound.

Observe the ten thousand realms without; examine the single mind within. All becomes luminously clear and still—stillness and chaos both cease. Thoughts link in succession, deeply rooted and profoundly tranquil. Abiding in serene constancy, it is obscure and unfathomable. Sorrows and troubles vanish forever; right and wrong are no longer known.

The Venerable Lord said: I am no sage, yet through study I have attained this. Thus, in my pursuit of the Dao/Way, I hold fast to all teachings. Of the thousand scriptures and ten thousand arts, only the mind matters.

*Thus concludes The Venerable Lord’s Scripture of Inner Contemplation.*
