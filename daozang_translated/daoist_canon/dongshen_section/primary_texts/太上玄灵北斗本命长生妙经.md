**The Supreme Mysterious Numinous Northern Dipper Original Destiny Longevity Wondrous Scripture**

**Opening the Scripture: The Supreme Wondrous Numinous Chapter**

We bow our heads to the Supreme Venerable One,
And prostrate in reverence to the Northern Asterism.
Gazing upward, we invoke the Two August Emperors,
And present ourselves before the Seven Primordial Lords.
This scripture first emerged in the Shu capital,
The Dao as the root of Heaven and humanity.
It dispels calamities and resolves peril,
Preserves life and guards the Mysterious True.

From the Southern Mound come three thousand envoys,
From the Northern Dipper, seven thousand spirits.
All arrive to protect the Dharma throne,
Together entering the Gate of Purity.

Now, with utmost sincerity, your servant recites,
And the Dao-qi naturally abides.

In the first year of the Yongshou era, on the seventh day of the first month, the Supreme Lord Lao descended upon the Shu capital and transmitted *The Northern Dipper Longevity Wondrous Scripture* to Celestial Master Zhang Daoling. Unsatisfied with its verses alone, he further bestowed the wondrous secret of long life.

The Supreme Lord spoke:
Heavenly One generates water,
Born from the northern direction.
Thus, the Purple Tenuity Enclosure stands lofty,
Exalting the Northern Asterism.
The lodges of the Northern Asterism
Are arrayed as the Seven Primordials:
The head leads with Greedy Wolf,
The tail shines with Broken Brilliance,
While Literary Splendor stands at the center,
Serving as the pivot of Heaven and Earth.
Therefore, the Northern Dipper governs life and death,
The great assembly that nurtures beings and sustains humanity.

All sentient beings,
Having received the qi of Heaven and Earth,
And the decrees of yin and yang,
Whether male or female,
Whether long-lived or short-lived,
All proceed from the mandate of the Northern Dipper.

Now, seeing that living beings lack a gateway to cultivate the path of truth,
And no sincere rites to venerate the Dipper,
I take pity and greatly reveal the Mysterious Numinous.
You must listen carefully,
And widely propagate its circulation,
So that all may ascend to immortality
And escape the cycle of rebirth.

The Celestial Master bowed again, overjoyed beyond measure.

The Supreme Lord spoke:
The Northern Dipper’s majesty
Arrests the wheeling of all constellations.
It revolves Heaven and turns Earth,
Dispelling filth and banishing miasma.
Through spring, autumn, winter, and summer,
It generates beings and births humanity.
In the east, south, west, and north,
It establishes the records and sets the gates.
Titled the Nine August Ones,
The True Lord of the Northern Culmen.
The Three Terraces and the Florid Canopy
Govern the essence and souls of humanity.
The Seven Primordials’ decrees
Bind the primordial spirit of humanity.
Thus, it is called the Original Destiny,
First issuing from the Mysterious Writ.
Beings are freed from tribulation,
The Dao harmonizing with Heaven and Earth.
By constantly paying homage,
Body and destiny endure forever.

As the Supreme Lord uttered this jade-like voice,
The hearts of the ten directions’ celestial realms melted like ice,
All rejoicing at once,
Delighted to encounter this supreme Dharma bridge.

The Celestial Master crawled forward on his knees to the jade throne and recited a gatha:
Heaven and Earth generate primordial qi,
Numinous radiance gathers at the Northern Asterism.
The Purple Tenuity opens the imperial throne,
The Mysterious Gate arrays the True Lords.
It dissolves all misfortunes and perils,
And engenders the myriad kinds of humanity.
Great is the Literary Splendor lodge,
Revolving the Dao like spring.

When the Celestial Master finished reciting the gatha,
The immortal ranks returned to their ranks,
The sagely chariot ascended to Heaven,
Bowing to the Mysterious Vault.
All beings received deliverance.

**Here ends** *The Supreme Mysterious Numinous Northern Dipper Original Destiny Longevity Wondrous Scripture*.

**Eulogy and Perfect Numinous Incantation**

Great is the Northern Culmen,
Generating beings without cease.
Its pivotal mechanism moves,
Heaven and Earth are established.
The Supreme Lord bestows the teaching,
Living beings encounter its planting.
It dispels calamities and resolves tribulations,
The divine eye perceives like lightning.
Now, your servant fasts and bathes,
May the Supreme be moved.
Beginning and end fulfilled,
Protecting family and state.
Reciting the words of the Dao,
This alone is our sole intent.
This scripture is rarely encountered,
Through kalpas numbering ten thousand myriads.
Having encountered it,
One must surely attain realization.
O benevolent Primordial Numinous,
Witness this merit and virtue.
