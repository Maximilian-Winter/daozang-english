*The Supreme Wondrous Dao: The Authentic Scripture of Primordial Beginning*
**Guan Yinzi**

Guan Ling Yinxi was a minister of the Zhou dynasty. When Laozi journeyed west, Yinxi observed a purple qi hovering over the pass and knew a true person was about to arrive. He awaited and sought him out, and indeed encountered Laozi. Laozi, recognizing his extraordinary nature, composed a text for him. After receiving Laozi’s work, Yinxi himself wrote nine chapters, titled *The Master Guan Yinzi*.

Today, the Taihu Temple in Lingbao County, Shanzhou, marks the ancient Hangu Pass where Yinxi awaited Laozi. The Zongsheng Palace on Mount Zhongnan was Yinxi’s former residence. King Mu of Zhou later renovated its thatched pavilion, renaming it the Louguan (Tower Abbey), and established a shrine to Laozi. The flourishing of Daoist abbeys truly began here.

After bestowing the scripture, Laozi departed westward through the Dasan Pass and later reunited with Yinxi at the Green Ram Market in Chengdu, where he granted him the title *Master of Primordial Beginning*—the "vast and true person" referred to in the *Zhuangzi*.

**Chapter One: The Cosmic Character**

The character *yu* (宇, "cosmos") is the Dao.
Without the Dao, there would be nothing to speak of; that which cannot be spoken *is* the Dao.
Without the Dao, there would be nothing to contemplate; that which cannot be contemplated *is* the Dao.

The heavens and things surge in tumultuous flow; human affairs are tangled and chaotic—now whirling like eddies, now clashing like blades, now fleeting like semblances that are not. Yet people contend over them, take sides in them, display them, clamor over them, reject them, or seek to control them.

To speak of them is like blowing shadows; to ponder them is like carving dust. Even the wisdom of sages breeds delusion; not even spirits can fathom them.

It cannot be acted upon, cannot be attained, cannot be measured, cannot be divided. Thus it is called *Heaven*, *Destiny*, *Spirit*, *Mystery*—together, the Dao.

Nothing exists that is not Heaven; nothing exists that is not Destiny; nothing exists that is not Spirit; nothing exists that is not Mystery.

If this is true of things, how could it not be true of humans?
All may be called Heaven; all may be called Spirit. All may align with Destiny and embody Mystery. One cannot say, "That is Heaven, this is not," or "That is Spirit, this is not," or "That is Destiny, this is not," or "That is Mystery, this is not."

Thus, those who master my Dao perceive within a single thing the fullness of Heaven, the exhaustion of Spirit, the alignment with Destiny, and the embodiment of Mystery.

In learning, one may pursue differences, dissecting names while the reality remains the same. In attainment, one merges with sameness, forgetting distinctions and names.

To observe the Dao is like observing water: if gazing at a mere pond seems insufficient, one turns to rivers, to the Yangtze, to the sea, declaring, "This is the ultimate water!" Yet they fail to recognize that their own saliva, tears, and sweat are also water.

The Dao is not partial to any person—sages do not see one as possessing the Dao while another does not.
The Dao is not bound to any self—sages do not see themselves as advancing toward or retreating from the Dao.

Because it does not "have" the Dao, it is never without the Dao; because it does not "attain" the Dao, it never loses the Dao.

Those who do not understand the Dao yet recklessly divine its nature are like archers shooting at an overturned vessel.
The lofty claim it holds gold and jade; the mediocre, horns and feathers; the base, tiles and stones.
Is this so, or is it not? Only the one who placed the object knows.

A single potter can craft ten thousand vessels, yet never is there a vessel that can craft the potter, nor harm the potter. The singular Dao gives rise to the myriad things, yet never is there a single thing that can create the Dao, nor harm the Dao.

The Dao stretches boundless and unknowing; the heart roams unbound and untethered; things follow one another without cease. Like lightning’s swift flight, like sand’s wild scatter—yet the sage knows the heart as one, things as one, the Dao as one, and these three in turn merge into one. They do not reject the one for its lack of uniformity, nor let non-uniformity disrupt the one.

Using a basin as a pond, a stone as an isle, fish circle them endlessly, traversing thousands upon thousands of miles without exhaustion—why? Because water has no source, no return. The sage’s Dao has no beginning, no end, and thus responds to things without exhaustion.

Do not love the Dao, for love is water; do not observe the Dao, for observation is fire; do not pursue the Dao, for pursuit is wood; do not speak of the Dao, for speech is metal; do not contemplate the Dao, for thought is earth. Only the sage, without departing from true nature, ascends the great Dao. When the heart has yet to stir, the Dao lends itself to it.

Thick clouds veil the sky, rivers and lakes darken, fish drift in confusion—then suddenly they glimpse a glimmer in the waves, food stirring, a gift from heaven, and rush toward it, only to be caught by hook or net. Those who do not know the selfless self yet chase the Dao are no different.

The arts and techniques in the world are many: some revere obscurity, some clarity; some strength, some weakness. Clinging to them becomes mere affairs, while releasing them becomes the Dao. The Dao can never be attained—what can be attained is called virtue, not Dao. The Dao can never be practiced—what can be practiced is called conduct, not Dao. The sage uses what can be attained and practiced to nurture life, and what cannot be attained or practiced to nurture death.

After hearing the Dao, those who act and cling do so for the sake of humanity; those who act not and cling not do so for the sake of heaven. To act is to fail; to cling is to lose. Thus, one may hear the Dao in the morning and die by evening.

When the passions are utterly still, one becomes a sage; when they incline toward goodness, a worthy; when toward evil, a petty person. The utterly still passions arise from the self’s nothingness, which cannot be shown; the good or evil passions arise from nothing into being, which cannot be concealed. Good and evil passions imply knowledge, possessed only by living beings; utterly still passions imply non-knowledge, and beneath the vast sky, the Dao is present everywhere.

Do not say the sage’s ceaseless effort perfects the Dao through diligence, nor that the sage’s unchanging steadfastness secures the Dao through grasping. The sage’s effort is like loosing an arrow—it moves by virtue of the target, not by itself. The sage’s steadfastness is like gripping an arrow—it holds by virtue of the target, not by itself.

To seek the Dao through words, actions, learning, or knowledge is to turn endlessly without attainment. Knowing words is like the murmur of a spring; knowing actions, like the flight of birds; knowing learning, like grasping at shadows; knowing knowledge, like interpreting dreams. The moment these cease, the Dao comes to meet you.

To build things through affairs is difficult; to abandon things through the Dao is easy. All things under heaven are hard to complete but easy to destroy. A single spark can burn ten thousand things—yet when the things are gone, where does the fire remain? A single breath of the Dao can still the myriad things—yet when the things are gone, where does the Dao abide?

In life, some die after a day, some after ten years, some after a hundred. Those who die in a day are like those who attain the Dao in a single breath; those who die after ten or a hundred years are like those who attain it after long passage. The living, though active and wise, are merely called living, not dead. Those who have not grasped the Dao, though active and wise, are merely called engaged in affairs, not in the Dao.

Not knowing that my Dao is without speech or action, yet striving for it through words and deeds, one may suddenly encounter some strange thing and cling to it as the Dao—unaware that abandoning the source to seek the stream will never reach the source, nor forsaking the root to seek the branch ever attain the root.

Archery, charioteering, lute-playing, chess—none of these can be mastered in a single breath. Only the Dao, formless and boundless, can be grasped in an instant. When two archers meet, skill or clumsiness is revealed; when two chess players meet, victory or defeat is seen; when two who know the Dao meet, nothing can be shown. What cannot be shown has no skill or clumsiness, no victory or defeat.

My Dao is like the sea: toss in a hundred million pieces of gold, and it is not seen; toss in a hundred million stones, and it is not seen; toss in a hundred million filths, and it is not seen. It carries tiny shrimp and minnows, it carries great whales and leviathans. Gathering all waters into it, it is not in excess; dispersing all waters from it, it is not diminished.

My Dao is like dwelling in darkness: those in the light cannot see things in the dark, yet those in the dark can see all in the light. The petty person’s power leads to evil; the noble person’s power leads to goodness; the sage’s power leads to nothingness. Only in nothingness is the Dao found.

My Dao is like a sword: to cut with its edge is sharp, to grasp its edge is to be wounded. The lotus does not ask the bean, the bean does not answer the lotus; the tile does not ask the stone, the stone does not answer the tile—yet the Dao is not lost. Question and answer flow as one qi—where is the Dao? Those who look up to the Dao are misled; those who follow it most closely know only the Dao’s affairs, not the Dao itself.

Thus, the sage does not regret the Dao’s absence, nor rely on its abundance; does not borrow the Dao from sages, nor sell it to fools.

**Two Pillars**
Pillars uphold heaven and earth.

As the scholar-tree or the basin, as the plate or the flask, as the vessel or the urn—all can uphold heaven and earth. The cracks of tortoise shells, the counting of milfoil stalks, the broken shards of tile, the veined patterns of stone—all can inform the knight. Yet it is inauspicious.

Know then that the principles of heaven, earth, and the myriad things are complete within each single thing; every thing contains them, none borrowing from another. With my essence I join their essence, and when the two essences contend, the spirit responds. One female and one male hatch from eggs; one mare and one stallion gestate in the womb. Form is their essence; principle is their spirit. Love is my essence; observation is my spirit. Love is water; observation is fire. When love grasps and observation follows, it becomes wood; when observation abides and love gathers, it becomes metal.

First conceive the primordial qi within a single thing. Hold fast to love to unite with its form, and obscurely observe to unite with its principle—then the image is preserved. The image of a single revolution pervades the great void: from the center it ascends to become heaven, from the center it descends to become earth. There is no ascent without descent, no descent without ascent. That which ascends is fire; that which descends is water. That which longs to ascend but cannot is wood; that which longs to descend but cannot is metal.

Wood as a thing: when drilled, it yields fire; when wrung, it yields water. Metal as a thing: when struck, it yields fire; when smelted, it yields water. Metal and wood are the intercourse of water and fire. Water is essence and heaven; fire is spirit and earth; wood is the soul and man; metal is the corporeal soul and things. That which revolves without cease is time; that which encompasses and abides is direction. Only soil begins and ends it. Some dissolve it; some depart from it.

The people of the world cannot be counted by the hundreds of millions. Each person’s dreams differ; each night’s dreams differ. There are heavens and earths, people and things—all formed by thought—uncountable as dust. How do we know that the present heaven and earth are not formed by some thinker?

The heart corresponds to the jujube; the liver to the elm. I communicate with heaven and earth. Dreaming of water foretells rain; dreaming of fire foretells clear skies. Heaven and earth communicate with me. I and heaven and earth seem conjoined, seem separate—each returning to its own purity.

Though heaven and earth are vast, they have color and form, number and direction. Yet I possess that which is neither color nor form, neither number nor direction, yet contains heaven and earth. Those who die in the womb, those who perish in the egg—whether human or thing—though heaven and earth are vast, they know nothing of them. Those who calculate heaven and earth do so with my limited perception. It is like the hand not touching the blade, the blade not wounding the hand.

Within dreams, within mirrors, within water—heaven and earth exist there too. To dispel the heaven and earth of dreams, sleep without dreaming. To dispel the heaven and earth of mirrors, let the form not be reflected. To dispel the heaven and earth of water, let the urn not be drawn. Their being or non-being lies here, not there. Thus the sage does not dispel heaven and earth but dispels perception.

Heaven is not heaven of itself—there is one who makes it heaven. Earth is not earth of itself—there is one who makes it earth. It is like houses, boats, and chariots, which await man to be completed; they do not complete themselves. Knowing that they have dependence, knowing that this has no dependence—above, one does not see heaven; below, one does not see earth; within, one does not see the self; without, one does not see others.

That which has time is qi; that which is not qi has never known day or night. That which has direction is form; that which is not form has never known south or north. What is that which is not qi? It is that from which qi itself arises. Like shaking a sail to obtain wind: before it is shaken, it is not the qi of wind; once shaken, it is called qi. What is that which is not form? It is that from which form itself arises. Like drilling wood to obtain fire: before it is drilled, it is not the form of fire; once drilled, it is called form.

The changes of cold, heat, warmth, and frost are like tile and stone: placed in fire, they grow hot; placed in water, they grow cold; breathed upon, they grow warm; inhaled upon, they grow frosty. It is only because external things come and go, while tile and stone themselves neither come nor go. It is like the reflection in water: it comes and goes, but the water itself does not come or go.

Clothing flutters in the void to obtain wind; breath blown upon things obtains water. Water poured into water makes a sound; stones struck together emit light. One who understands this can produce wind, rain, thunder, and lightning, for wind, rain, thunder, and lightning all arise from the movement of qi, and qi arises from the movement of the mind. Just as inwardly imagining great fire brings a sensation of heat over time, and inwardly imagining great water brings a sensation of cold, one who understands this can unite with the powers of heaven and earth.

The changes of the five clouds can foretell the year’s abundance or scarcity; the arrival of the eight winds can foretell the moment’s fortune or misfortune. Thus we know that good and ill omens, disasters and blessings, are but the revolutions of a single qi.

Merge self and other, unite with heaven and earth—yet those of private wisdom recognize only themselves. Heaven and earth are lodged, the myriad things are lodged, I am lodged, the Dao is lodged. If separated from lodging, the Dao cannot stand.

**Three Ultimates**
The ultimate is to honor the sage. In governing the world, the sage does not distinguish between my worthiness or foolishness, thus he follows others’ worthiness and makes them worthy, follows others’ foolishness and makes them foolish. He does not distinguish between my right or wrong, thus he follows the rightness of affairs and affirms them, follows the wrongness of affairs and negates them.

Knowing the great unity of past and present, he may prioritize the ancient or the present. Knowing the great unity of inner and outer, he may prioritize the inner or the outer. No thing in the world can burden him, so he grounds himself in humility. No thing in the world can be external to him, so he embraces emptiness. No thing in the world can obstruct him, so he acts with ease. No thing in the world can block him, so he transforms with adaptability.

With this, he centers the world and can establish rites. With this, he harmonizes the world and can create music. With this, he imparts fairness to the world and can regulate archery. With this, he circulates through the world and can repel invaders. With this, he follows the world and can establish laws. With this, he observes the world and can fashion tools.

The sage does not govern the world by himself alone but governs the world through the world. The world ascribes merit to the sage, yet the sage attributes merit to the world—thus the governance of Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang made the world say it was all natural.

Heaven covers all without exception: it gives life and takes it away, yet Heaven has no love or hate. The sun shines on all without exception: it illuminates the beautiful and the ugly, yet the sun has no partiality or indifference.

The sage’s Dao follows the Mandate of Heaven—it is not that the sage can Dao by himself. The sage’s virtue accords with the times—it is not that the sage can be virtuous by himself. The sage’s affairs are for others—it is not that the sage can act for himself. Thus, the sage does not possess the Dao, does not possess virtue, does not possess affairs.

The sage knows that the self is no-self, so he unites all with benevolence. He knows that affairs are no-self, so he weighs them with righteousness. He knows that the mind is no-self, so he restrains it with ritual. He knows that knowledge is no-self, so he illuminates it with wisdom. He knows that words are no-self, so he upholds them with trust.

The sage’s Dao sometimes takes benevolence as benevolence, sometimes takes righteousness as benevolence, or ritual, wisdom, or trust as benevolence. Benevolence, righteousness, ritual, wisdom, and trust each encompass all five, yet the sage unifies them without fixation. The world cannot name them.

Do not observe the sage through his conduct, for the Dao leaves no traces. Do not observe the sage through his words, for the Dao has no speech. Do not observe the sage through his abilities, for the Dao does nothing. Do not observe the sage through his appearance, for the Dao has no form.

Though his conduct may be most lofty, it does not depart from high and low. Though his words may be most refined, they do not depart from right and wrong. Though his abilities may be most divine, they do not depart from skill and clumsiness. Though his appearance may be most distinct, it does not depart from beauty and ugliness. The sage borrows these to reveal himself to the world, yet the world remains blind to them—only then does it see the sage.

The sage learned from bees to establish the order of ruler and minister, from spiders to weave nets and snares, from moles to institute rituals, and from fighting hares to devise warfare.

The common people learn from the worthy, the worthy learn from the sage, and the sage learns from the myriad things. Only the sage is one with things, and thus has no self.

The sage says: "Observe the Dao in heaven and earth, in all beings—harmonize with it, begin and end with it, blend with its hues, nurture it like an egg. Do not cling to the Dao, do not discard things, do not exalt the noble, do not despise the humble."

The worthy say: "Each thing is different—sometimes I abandon it, sometimes I embrace it, lengthen or shorten it, straighten or square it. This is how things are altered."

Yet the sage knows that the杂杂杂杂杂杂杂杂 are base and separate, dwelling apart—this is how one is human, not how one makes it one’s own.

The sage is the same as the common people in food and drink, clothing, houses, boats, and carriages, in nobility and humility, wealth and poverty. The common people often resemble the sage, and the sage often resembles the common people. Those who look up to his loftiness and marvel at his greatness—is this so, or is it not so?

A fish wishing to be different from other fish leaps from the water onto the shore and dies. A tiger wishing to be different from other tigers leaves the mountains for the marketplace and is captured. The sage does not differ from the common people—it is only that things cannot confine him.

The Dao does nothing. To respond to the world with the Dao is to act, not to Dao. The Dao has no fixed form. To lodge the Dao in things is to have things, not the Dao. The sage ultimately cannot step outside the Dao to show it to others.

Like a bell resounding, like a drum sounding—such are the sage’s words. Like a cart rolling, like a boat sailing—such are the sage’s actions. Since none can name it, he retreats from the world’s words. Since none can know it, he seizes the world’s wisdom.

The maggot eats the snake, the snake eats the frog, the frog eats the maggot—each devours the other. The sage’s words are likewise: some speak of the harm of being, others of the harm of non-being, still others of the harm of neither being nor non-being. His words move like a saw’s teeth, yet the true sage leaves no single word behind.

Like the dragon, like the jiao-dragon, like the snake, like the tortoise, like the fish, like the clam—the dragon can be all of them. The jiao-dragon is only itself, unable to be the dragon, the snake, the tortoise, the fish, or the clam. The sage is like the dragon, the worthy like the jiao-dragon.

Within himself, he has no fixed abode; his form manifests in things. In movement, he is like water; in stillness, like a mirror; in response, like an echo.

Vague as if vanished, silent as if pure—those who are the same harmonize with him, those who grasp him lose him. He never precedes others but always follows them.

Vast and boundless, he roams the Great Beginning. Sometimes he is gold, sometimes jade, sometimes dung, sometimes earth.

Sometimes he soars with things, sometimes pursues them, sometimes ascends mountains with them, sometimes plunges into the depths with them. Now dignified, now flexible, now mad, now foolish.

When a skilled zither player has a sorrowful heart, the sound is mournful; with a longing heart, the sound is lingering; with a resentful heart, the sound is winding; with an admiring heart, the sound is radiant. What produces sorrow, longing, resentment, and admiration is neither the hand nor the bamboo, neither the strings nor the paulownia—it comes from the heart, matches the hand, comes from the hand, matches the instrument. Those who possess the Dao never miss the mark.

The sage uses speech, action, and thought to be one with others, and uses non-speech, non-action, and non-thought to be different from others.

The clearer the mind is about gain and loss, the less harmony there is with kin. The clearer the mind is about worthiness and foolishness, the less fellowship there is with friends. The clearer the mind is about right and wrong, the less affairs are accomplished. The clearer the mind is about beauty and ugliness, the less things are in accord. Thus, the sage blends them all.

Those with foolish and clumsy minds rashly cite the sage’s foolishness and clumsiness to justify themselves, not realizing that the sage is sometimes foolish, sometimes wise, sometimes skillful, sometimes clumsy.

Those who take the sage as their teacher are worthy; those who take the worthy as their teacher are sages. For those who take the sage as their teacher follow traces and forget the Dao, while those who take the worthy as their teacher turn away from traces and unite with the Dao.

The worthy rush upward and do not see below; the multitude rush downward and do not see above. The sage harmonizes above and below, acting only as is fitting—how could it be said that the sage is distinct from the worthy and the multitude? In the principles of the world, the male leads and the female follows; the stallion gallops and the mare pursues; the cock crows and the hen responds. Thus, the sage establishes words and deeds, while the worthy cling to them.

Though the sage’s Dao may shift like a tiger’s stripes, in affairs it moves like a turtle; though the Dao may be as fine as silk, in action it is as coarse as sackcloth. What is called the sage’s Dao—how solitary it is, how penetrating, how luminous! Only by embracing and pairing with the myriad things while no single thing can pair with it does it become the master of all things. Clouds coil and unfurl, birds soar and wheel—all within the empty void, and thus their transformations are inexhaustible. The sage’s Dao is likewise.

**The Four Symbols**
The Symbols are essence, spirit, soul, and corporeal soul.
Water may be divided or united, but essence has no self. Fire depends on oil or fuel, but spirit has no ego. Thus, the ear may be blocked before or behind yet still hear—no self; wisdom may be exalted—no self; unity may be singular—no self; winter may wither autumn’s things—no self; black may not be altered—no self; the north may grant longevity—no self. All these are essence.
The tongue and teeth form speech—no ego; ritual may be humble—no ego; duality may be paired—no ego; summer may follow spring’s things—no ego; red may be altered—no ego; the southern sky—no ego. All these are spirit.
Because essence has no self, when rice is hulled, its essence remains. Because spirit has no ego, when a ghost possesses a thing, its spirit appears.
Those who preserve essence forget right and wrong, forget gain and loss; what is here is not there. Those who embrace spirit alternate between obscurity and clarity, strength and weakness; what is there is not here.
Essence and spirit are water and fire; the Five Phases mutually generate and extinguish them. Their coming has no beginning, their going no end. Thus, my essence is but a drop—without birth or death; my spirit but a sip—without arising or ceasing. Only by having no self, no other, no beginning, no end does one merge with heaven and earth.
Essence is water; corporeal soul is metal. Spirit is fire; soul is wood.
Essence governs water, corporeal soul governs metal—metal generates water, so essence is stored in corporeal soul. Spirit governs fire, soul governs wood—wood generates fire, so spirit is stored in soul.
Fire alone can melt metal and consume it, burn wood and reduce it, thus uniting soul and corporeal soul.
Essence in heaven is cold, on earth is water, in humans is essence. Spirit in heaven is heat, on earth is fire, in humans is spirit. Corporeal soul in heaven is dryness, on earth is metal, in humans is corporeal soul. Soul in heaven is wind, on earth is wood, in humans is soul.
When my essence unites with the essence of heaven, earth, and the myriad things, it is like myriad waters merging into one. When my spirit unites with the spirit of heaven, earth, and the myriad things, it is like myriad fires merging into one. When my corporeal soul unites with the corporeal soul of heaven, earth, and the myriad things, it is like metals of different kinds melted into one. When my soul unites with the soul of heaven, earth, and the myriad things, it is like different woods grafted into one. Then heaven, earth, and the myriad things are all my essence, my spirit, my soul, my corporeal soul—what is death, and what is life?
The movement of the Five Phases: from essence comes soul, from soul comes spirit, from spirit comes intent, from intent comes corporeal soul, from corporeal soul comes essence. These five revolve endlessly, so the false heart of the self flows and turns through the transformations of creation for countless eons without end.
Yet kernels sprout into countless trees—though heaven and earth are vast, they cannot sprout a kernel in empty space. Hens lay countless eggs—though yin and yang are subtle, they cannot lay an egg from a hen without a rooster. Only by gathering all that comes to me into a single breath can I transform things into myself, so there is no thing without me. What power among the Five Phases could alter this?
The multitude grasp the soul with the corporeal soul—when metal is in excess, wood is insufficient. The sage moves the corporeal soul with the soul—when wood is in excess, metal is insufficient.
For the corporeal soul’s storage is accompanied by the soul, and the soul’s wandering is followed by the corporeal soul. By day, the soul lodges in the eyes; by night, the corporeal soul rests in the liver. Lodging in the eyes, it sees; resting in the liver, it dreams. What is seen is the soul without discrimination—discrimination arises from analysis. To analyze and call it "heaven and earth" is the soul’s habitual delusion. What is dreamed is the corporeal soul without discrimination—discrimination arises from analysis. To analyze and call it "self and other" is the corporeal soul’s habitual delusion.
Fire generates earth, so spirit generates intent. Earth generates metal, so intent generates corporeal soul. When spirit moves, it is no longer called spirit but intent. When intent moves, it is no longer called intent but corporeal soul.
Only the sage knows that self is no-self and things are no-things—all arise from thought and calculation. Thus, when the myriad things come, I respond with nature, not with the heart. Nature is the heart before it sprouts. Without the heart, there is no intent—for without fire, there is no earth. Without intent, there is no corporeal soul—for without earth, there is no metal. If one is absent, all five are abolished.
Having merged heaven, earth, and the myriad things into soul, one can merge them into corporeal soul. All that creation subtly crafts is my soul; all that creation possesses is my corporeal soul. Then there is not a single thing that can be cast upon me.
The character for *hun* (soul) is written with "cloud" and "ghost"; the character for *po* (corporeal soul) is written with "white" and "ghost." In script, this is so. A ghost is what a person becomes after death. Cloud is wind, wind is wood; white is qi, qi is metal. Wind scatters, so it is light and pure—what is light and pure ascends to heaven. Metal is hard, so it is heavy and turbid—what is heavy and turbid descends to earth. The light and pure is the corporeal soul following the soul in ascent; the heavy and turbid is the soul following the corporeal soul in descent.

Those who ascend through *ren* (benevolence) serve as the Wood Star’s aides; those who ascend through *yi* (righteousness) serve as the Metal Star’s aides; those who ascend through *li* (propriety) serve as the Fire Star’s aides; those who ascend through *zhi* (wisdom) serve as the Water Star’s aides; those who ascend through *xin* (trustworthiness) serve as the Earth Star’s aides. Those who sink through lack of *ren* are assailed by Wood’s malevolence; those who sink through lack of *yi* are assailed by Metal’s malevolence; those who sink through lack of *li* are assailed by Fire’s malevolence; those who sink through lack of *zhi* are assailed by Water’s malevolence; those who sink through lack of *xin* are assailed by Earth’s malevolence.

When soul and corporeal soul are evenly balanced, one dwells among men. Ascending soul is noble; descending corporeal soul is base. Luminous soul is wise; oppressive corporeal soul is foolish. Light soul is radiant; heavy corporeal soul is dark. Soaring soul becomes feather; sharp corporeal soul becomes fur. Bright soul is spirit; obscure corporeal soul is ghost. Their forms, their dwellings, their perceptions, their affinities—all correspond to the Five Phases. Only the numbers of the Five Phases vary and do not align, which is why the myriad things are so numerous that even between heaven and earth they are never exhausted.

The Five Affairs return to the Five Phases; the Five Phases give rise to the Five Creatures—how can one exhaust their permutations? It is like divining with tortoise shells or counting with milfoil stalks: when sincerity is truly present, the Five Phases respond; if sincerity is lacking, no matter how one divines or counts, not a single response appears. The sage borrows things to traverse the world, and the Five Phases cannot but correspond.

The Three possess soul: soul is perception; the eye is essence; color is spirit. What perceives them are the soul, ear, mouth, nose, heart, and the like. In this life, love is essence, the root of that life’s father; observation is spirit, the root of that life’s mother. Though love and observation differ, both arise from perception. The root of that life lies in that which gives life: the first is the father, who imparts qi—Water; the second is the mother, who imparts blood—Fire. With father and mother, that life is born.

Yet when love is devoid of perception, it is like molten metal merging; when observation is devoid of perception, it is like a lamp’s illumination. If my perception does not sprout, how can my life exist? It is like striking a drum: the drum’s form is what I possess; the drum’s sound is what I sense. Though the striker has departed, the lingering sound remains—yet in the end, even that vanishes. The drum’s form is like my essence; the drum’s sound is like my spirit; the lingering sound is like my soul and corporeal soul. Realize that they come and go in an instant, and how can the qi of the Five Phases belong to me?

The fruit’s kernel must await the presence of Water, Fire, and Earth—only then can it generate endlessly. If any of the three are lacking, as in great drought, great flooding, or barren earth, none suffice to give life. Essence (Water), spirit (Fire), and intent (Earth) do not originally interact; only when man unites them with the root can activity arise within. It is like the art of *shu* and *chi*: from utter nothingness, one perceives manifold activity.

Soul is Water. The root of Wood lies in winter’s Water, yet it blossoms in summer’s Fire. Thus man’s soul is stored in night’s essence and appears in day’s spirit. United with essence, what it perceives is uniquely mine—for essence has never belonged to another. United with spirit, what it perceives is shared—for spirit has never belonged to me.

Realize that this body is like a body in a dream, appearing as emotion dictates—then one can soar with spirit as one’s self and roam the Great Purity. Realize that this thing is like an object in a dream, appearing as emotion dictates—then one can congeal essence into things and traverse the Eight Wastes. This Dao can perceive spirit and essence to prolong life, or forget spirit and essence to transcend life.

Inhaling qi to nourish essence is like Metal generating Water; inhaling wind to nourish spirit is like Wood generating Fire—thus one borrows the external to extend spirit and essence. Rinsing with water to nourish essence ensures essence’s inexhaustibility; rubbing with fire to nourish spirit ensures spirit’s inexhaustibility—thus one borrows the internal to extend spirit and essence. As for those who forget spirit and essence to transcend life, I have already spoken of them.

One diligent in propriety does not let spirit scatter—thus can gather spirit. One diligent in wisdom does not let essence dissipate—thus can contain essence. *Ren* is yang and luminous—thus can lighten the soul. *Yi* is yin and obscure—thus can govern the corporeal soul.

The cicada larva rolls a pellet; when the pellet is formed, it concentrates its essence, and a white mosquito dwells within. Soon it sheds its shell and becomes a cicada. If the larva did not concentrate, how could the mosquito be white? The cook boils a crab, leaving one leg on the table. Though the crab is boiled, the discarded leg still twitches. Life and death are but the gathering and dispersal of a single qi—neither born nor dead, yet man arbitrarily calculates daily life and death.

Some die standing, some sitting, some lying down, some from illness, some from medicine—all deaths are equal, without distinction of rank. The one who knows the Dao does not see life, and thus does not see death. Those who weary of life and death or seek to transcend them are all afflicted by this great delusion. It is like a transformed being: if one harbors weariness of life and death or a desire to transcend them, this is called a demon, not the Dao.

Those who calculate life and death say: after death, there is existence; or after death, there is nothing; or after death, there is both existence and nothingness; or one should hope; or one should fear; or one should accept; or one should transcend. The more their perceptions shift, the more their minds race without cease. Yet they do not realize that my life and death are like a horse’s hand or a cow’s wing—originally nonexistent, and again not nonexistent. It is like water and fire: though one may encounter water and fire, they cannot burn or drown one.

**Five Mirrors**
The mirror is the heart. When the heart is obscured by fortune and misfortune, numinous ghosts seize it; when obscured by desire for men and women, lewd ghosts seize it; when obscured by hidden sorrow, sinking ghosts seize it; when obscured by reckless abandon, mad ghosts seize it; when obscured by oaths and curses, strange ghosts seize it.

Such ghosts may take the dark as their body, the hidden as their body, the wind as their body, qi as their body, clay effigies as their body, painted images as their body, aged beasts as their body, or broken vessels as their body. Where their essence meets this essence, the two essences contend, and the spirit responds. Those seized by ghosts may interpret strange omens or auspicious signs; they grow haughty, claiming not that ghosts dwell within them but that the Dao dwells within them. Over time, they may die by wood, die by metal, die by rope, or die by well. Only the sage can master spirits without being ensnared by them, commanding the myriad spirits and holding their mechanism. They may gather them, scatter them, or wield them, responding to the ten thousand things while their heart remains still.

Without a unified heart, the five senses race in disarray; the heart cannot be unified. Without an empty heart, the five phases are all present; the heart cannot be empty. Without a tranquil heart, the myriad transformations shift imperceptibly; the heart cannot be still. If one seeks unity, duality arises to oppose it. If one seeks emptiness, fullness fills it. If one seeks stillness, movement shakes it. Only the sage can gather the ten thousand existences into a single breath, so that not one thing can enslave their clarity. They can disperse a single breath into the ten thousand existences, so that not one thing can question their actions.

Fire may burn for a thousand years, yet it can be extinguished in an instant. Knowledge may persist for a thousand years, yet it can be cast aside in an instant. That which flows is the boat, but what causes it to flow is the water, not the boat. That which moves is the cart, but what causes it to move is the ox, not the cart. That which thinks is the heart, but what causes it to think is intention, not the heart. Not knowing why it is so, yet it is so—thus its coming has no source, its going no destination. With no source in its coming and no destination in its going, it can merge with the original source of heaven and earth, neither ancient nor modern.

To know that the heart is without thing is to know that things are without thing. To know that things are without thing is to know that the Dao is without thing. Thus, one does not exalt extraordinary conduct nor marvel at subtle words. When things and self intersect, the heart arises—just as fire is born when two sticks are rubbed. One cannot say it is in me, nor in the other; one cannot say it is not me, nor not the other. To cling and divide into self and other is folly.

Do not rely on what you call profit and harm, right and wrong. Do these truly attain profit and harm, right and wrong? The sage moves in unknowing, and how much more so for you. The dreams of the night may seem longer than the night itself. The heart has no time: one born in Qi sees only the land of Qi; but when they go to Song, to Chu, to Jin, to Liang, what the heart holds changes—it has no fixed direction.

The master archer learns from the bow, not from Yi. The master boatman learns from the boat, not from the helmsman. The master of the heart learns from the heart, not from the sages. Right and wrong, beauty and ugliness, success and failure, fullness and emptiness—the Creator moves them all, yet they arise from private knowledge clinging to them.

Thus, even when one seeks to cast off "that which is not," it still remains. Even when one seeks to cast off "that which is neither being nor non-being," it still remains. Do not say it is obscure; do not say it is chaotic—it still remains. It is like returning to a place once visited: the memory is vivid, neither to be forgotten nor cast aside. The one who refines their knowledge transforms knowledge into wisdom.

Do you understand the teaching of transforming knowledge into wisdom? To think of ghosts is to tremble; to think of thieves is to fear. Knowledge is like mistaking millet for sorghum, or jade for stone—all are drifting, formless illusions without end. Seeing a strange thing gives rise to strange thoughts, which give rise to strange knowledge. These thoughts and this knowledge do not take root in me. Consider today: today alone. As for thoughts and knowledge of tomorrow, who can predict them? When tomorrow comes, the swirling thoughts and knowledge all arise from what has been born.

Daily thoughts and daily knowledge are like a rhinoceros gazing at the moon: the moon’s reflection enters its horn. The image arises only because of knowledge; the true moon was never in the horn. The heaven and earth and the ten thousand things within the breast are likewise. One who understands this teaching sees nothing outside and feels no emotion within.

Things born from earth return to earth. Affairs born from intention return to intention. To know intention is to affirm and then deny, to praise and then condemn—intention changes, but the heart does not. Intention awakens, but the heart does not. With only this one heart, intention is but dust passing to and fro; affairs are but shadows rising and vanishing. Within my heart abides the great constancy.

Emotion arises from the heart; the heart arises from nature. Emotion is the wave, the heart the current, nature the water. What comes to me is like the spark from striking stone—if nature receives it, the heart does not arise, and things drift lightly by. Wisdom and folly, truth and falsehood: some recognize them, some do not. Though there may be wisdom and folly, truth and falsehood, to call them such is bound to my knowledge. Knowing that all is shaped by knowledge, even what is true becomes false.

The heart stirred by things does not give rise to the heart but to emotion. Things intersecting with the heart do not give rise to things but to knowledge. Things are not even real—how much less knowledge? Knowledge is not even real—how much less emotion? Yet deluded people cling to being in the midst of utter nothingness, cling to constancy in the midst of utter change. A single emotion, once grasped, accumulates into ten thousand emotions; ten thousand emotions, once grasped, accumulate into ten thousand things. Things come without end, but my heart has its limits.

Thus, my good heart is controlled by emotion; my original emotion is controlled by things. One may send them away or summon them, yet their coming and going were never in my power. Creation drives them on without cease.

Yet they do not know: though heaven and earth are vast, they can command the formed but cannot command the formless; though yin and yang are subtle, they can command the qi-endowed but cannot command the qi-less. Where the heart goes, qi follows; where qi goes, form responds. It is like the Great Void: within utter nothingness, it transforms into one qi; within that one qi, it transforms into the ten thousand things—yet that one qi is not called the Great Void. My single heart can transform into qi and form, yet my heart itself is without qi and without form. Know that my single heart is without qi and without form, and heaven and earth, yin and yang cannot command it.

In ordinary times, when a person’s eyes suddenly see extraordinary things, it is always because essence has congealed to make it so. When a person is ill, and their eyes suddenly see extraordinary things, it is always because something is lacking in their heart to make it so. If you know that my heart can manifest being from non-being, then you know that my heart can manifest non-being from being. But if you do not believe this, it will naturally not be numinous.

Someone may ask: since consciousness is already clouded, who can avoid belief? I reply: just as the snake-catcher’s heart does not fear snakes, though he dreams of snakes, he feels no terror. Thus the Yellow Emperor said: “The Dao has no ghosts or spirits—it goes and comes alone.” My thoughts change daily, and there is something that makes them do so—it is not I, but fate. If you know it is only fate, outwardly you will not see the self, and inwardly you will not see union.

It is like two eyes that can see the ten thousand things of heaven and earth: if you briefly turn their light inward, for a moment they see nothing. The eye that gazes at carvings injures its clarity; the ear that listens to clashing sounds injures its acuity; the heart that ponders the profound injures its vitality. Do not measure others by your own heart—measure them by their own heart. One who understands this teaching can manage affairs, cultivate virtue, penetrate the Dao, engage with others, and forget the self.

The principles of the world begin with the small: if the small is not controlled, it grows to the large; if the large is not controlled, it grows to the uncontrollable. Thus, one who can control a single emotion can perfect virtue; one who can forget a single emotion can align with the Dao.

The six *bi*—*bi* means food, and food means form. People of the world distinguish self from others by saying, “My thoughts differ from theirs, their thoughts differ from mine.” Yet in dreams, too, “my thoughts differ from theirs, their thoughts differ from mine”—which is the self, and which is the other? People of the world distinguish self from others by saying, “My pain differs from theirs.” Yet in dreams, too, “my pain differs from theirs, their pain differs from mine”—which is the self, and which is the other? Nails and hair do not feel pain; hands and feet do not think—yet they are also me. How can they be distinguished by thought or pain?

People of the world consider solitary visions dreams and shared visions wakefulness. Yet when essence congeals, there are cases of a single person seeing something alone by day; when spirit unites, there are cases of two people sharing the same dream at night. Both are my spirit—so which is dream, and which is wakefulness? People of the world consider fleeting visions dreams and long-held visions wakefulness. Yet what is seen briefly is the qi of yin and yang; what is seen for a long time is also the qi of yin and yang. Both are my yin and yang—so which is dream, and which is wakefulness?

Those who love benevolence often dream of pines and cypresses, peaches and plums; those who love righteousness often dream of blades and weapons, metal and iron; those who love propriety often dream of baskets and sacrificial vessels; those who love wisdom often dream of rivers and lakes; those who love trustworthiness often dream of mountains and plains. All are governed by the five phases—there is no exception. Yet in dreams, if one hears or thinks of something, the dream changes accordingly; the five phases cannot be rigidly applied.

The sage governs things with the heart and restrains the heart with nature, so the heart moves in accord with creation, and the five phases cannot be rigidly applied. When you see beings with snake heads and human bodies, ox arms and fish scales, ghostly forms and bird wings, do not be startled. Such marvels are not as strange as dreams, and dream marvels are not as strange as wakefulness. With ears and eyes, hands and arms, marvels abound all the more.

Great words cannot be spoken; great wisdom cannot be thought. Someone asked me: “What is your clan name, your given name, your courtesy name? What do you wear, what do you eat? Who are your friends, who are your servants? What zither do you play, what books do you read? What is ancient, what is modern?” At that moment, I remained silent, not uttering a single word. When the questioner pressed me relentlessly, I could only reply: “You do not even see me—what use is there in my attributes?”

Form can divide and unite, extend and conceal. A husband and wife can produce two children—form divides. A husband and wife, two people, can produce one child—form unites. Eating sesame seeds prolongs life—form extends. On a moonless night without fire, no one sees me—form conceals.

Generating the ten thousand things from one qi is like replacing hair—thus form divides. Uniting the ten thousand things from one qi is like mending a cleft lip—thus form unites. Spirit preserves qi; qi preserves form—thus form extends. Uniting form with spirit and spirit with nothingness—thus form conceals.

Do you wish to know this? Do you wish to practice it?

There is nothing that cannot be seen—so nothing is not seen by it. There is nothing that cannot be heard—so nothing is not heard by it. The five grains can nourish form, yet nothing is not my form. The flavor of jade can nourish qi, yet nothing is not my qi. Thus my form and qi are the ten thousand things of heaven and earth.

The trapper who is accustomed to oxen becomes fierce; the hunter accustomed to tigers becomes brave; the fisherman accustomed to water becomes adept at sinking; the warrior accustomed to horses becomes strong. The ten thousand things can become me.

Within my single body, internally, pinworms and roundworms transform; externally, lice and fleas steam forth. Scabs become tortoises and fish; emaciation becomes rats and moles. I can become the ten thousand things.

As for my being me—like gold in ashes, yet not like the gold in ore. Break the ore to obtain gold, pan the sand to obtain gold, yet sift the ashes all one’s life and never find gold.

A single bee, though minute, can roam and observe heaven and earth; a single shrimp, though tiny, can roam wantonly through the great sea. When clay figurines are formed, some are noble, some base, some male, some female—yet their substance is earth, and when they crumble, they return to earth.

The eye sees of itself, yet the eye has no color. The ear hears of itself, yet the ear has no sound. The tongue tastes of itself, yet the tongue has no flavor. The heart measures of itself, yet the heart has no thing. The multitude chases after externals; the worthy cling to what is within; the sage treats all as false.

The qi of my body’s five phases—yet the qi of the five phases is by nature one thing. For example, in one place, one may draw water, draw fire, grow wood, congeal metal, transform earth—its nature, in gathering and embracing, is fundamentally without distinction.

Thus when creatures with feathers flourish, creatures with fur do not thrive; when creatures with fur flourish, creatures with scales do not thrive. One who understands the mutual functioning of the five phases can forget the self.

The withered tortoise has no self, yet can perceive great wisdom. The lodestone has no self, yet can manifest great power. The bell and drum have no self, yet can produce great sound. The boat and cart have no self, yet can achieve distant travel. Thus though my single body possesses wisdom, power, movement, and sound, it has never possessed a self.

The ant’s shadow-shot can slay me—know that the unknowing is also myself, and beneath all heaven, there is nowhere I am not.

One whose heart is lost in memory forgets hunger; one whose heart is consumed by anger forgets cold; one whose heart is nurtured forgets illness; one whose heart is stirred forgets pain. If one draws qi to nourish harmony, who can make one hungry? If one preserves spirit to cultivate warmth, who can make one cold? If one nurtures the five viscera with the five phases, there is no harm—who can make one ill? If one returns the five viscera to the five phases, there is no knowing—who can cause one pain?

People take the absence of knowing and acting as the absence of self, yet though there be knowing and acting, it does not impair the absence of self. It is like fire—restless and ceaseless, yet never possessing a self.

Seven Cauldrons: The cauldron is transformation. The Dao is fundamentally utter nonbeing. Those who return affairs to the Dao obtain it in a single breath. Affairs are fundamentally utter being. Those who move affairs with the Dao encompass them in a hundred acts.

Those who attain the Dao’s honor can assist the world; those who attain the Dao’s solitude can establish the self. Those who know the Dao is not bound by time can make one day into a hundred years, a hundred years into one day. Those who know the Dao is not obstructed by place can make one li into a hundred li, a hundred li into one li. Those who know the Dao has no qi yet can move the qi of being can summon wind and rain. Those who know the Dao has no form yet can transform the forms of being can alter birds and beasts.

Those who attain the Dao’s purity are not burdened by things—their bodies become light, and they can ride phoenixes and cranes. Those who attain the Dao’s wholeness are not drowned by things—their bodies become dark, and they can sit upon dragons and whales.

Being is nonbeing; nonbeing is being. One who knows this Dao can command ghosts and spirits. Fullness is emptiness; emptiness is fullness. One who knows this Dao can enter metal and stone. Above is below; below is above. One who knows this Dao can serve the power of the stars and constellations. Past is present; present is past. One who knows this Dao can divine with tortoise and milfoil. Others are myself; myself is others. One who knows this Dao can peer into the lungs and liver of others. Things are myself; myself is things. One who knows this Dao can cultivate dragons and tigers within the belly.

Know that images arise from the heart’s transformations—by observing the heart thus, one can become an infant girl. Know that qi arises from the heart’s generation—by absorbing spirit thus, one can become a cold furnace. By this, one can overcome things—tigers and leopards may be tamed. By this, one can unite with things—water and fire may be entered.

Only the man of Dao can do these things, yet he can also do them and choose not to. Human power can seize the creative transformations of heaven and earth—such as summoning thunder in winter, making ice in summer, causing a dead corpse to walk, a withered tree to bloom, capturing ghosts in a bean, fishing in a cup, opening a painted door, or speaking with a clay ghost. All are the work of pure qi, thus able to transform the ten thousand things.

Now, the ceaseless churning of human emotions is also the work of qi. Yet qi as a thing has union and dispersal. The way I move qi has never been united, nor has it ever been dispersed. Union brings life; dispersal brings death. That which has never united nor dispersed knows neither life nor death. Guests come and go, yet the post station remains unchanged.

There are those who chant spells, those who serve spirits, those who use written charms, those who change fingers—all can command spirit, master qi, and transform the ten thousand things. Yet only the insincere find it hard to trust themselves and easy to trust externals, thus relying on such methods. If one knows how to be sincere, there is no need to wait for these things to be so.

With each breath, a person travels four hundred thousand li in a day—transformation may be called swift indeed! Only the sage does not abide and does not change.

The blue phoenix lives a thousand years and transforms a thousand times; the peach tree serves five lords and its heart changes five times. The sage treats affairs as a guest and things as transient—how could he not wish to establish himself in the world? Yet those bound by form and number fear the unknowability of transformation.

The ten thousand things shift and change, now hidden, now manifest—yet their qi is one. Only the sage knows the one and does not change.

The growth of nails, the lengthening of hair, the circulation of nourishment and defense—none ceases for an instant. The multitude sees these in the obvious but not in the subtle; the worthy sees them in the subtle but cannot yield to transformation; the sage yields to transformation, and thus does not change.

Within a room, one’s perceptions are constant. Then one goes to the gate, to the neighbors, to the village, to the district, then to the outskirts, the mountains, the rivers—perceptions differ, likes and dislikes follow, harmony and contention arise, gain and loss take shape. Thus the sage is ever cautious in movement and stillness.

Just as the great sea transforms into countless fish and shrimp, its water remains one. My self and all things, lush and flourishing within the great transformation—our nature is one. To know this oneness is to be without self or other, without life or death.

The principles of the world may shift: right may turn to wrong, wrong to right; kindness may become punishment, punishment kindness. Thus the sage dwells in constancy yet contemplates change. In youth, one should heed the teachings of parents and elders; in maturity, grasp the admonitions of friends; in old age, remain vigilant against the follies of youth and prime. Though the ten thousand transformations may shift, they cannot constrain me.

The principles of the world show that the light are easily changed, the heavy resist change—like wind and clouds, which vanish in an instant, while the nature of gold and jade endures through ages. Those who are light and bright may move with creation’s transformations without clinging, yet something unchanging persists within.

Two children may love each other, yet in adulthood meet as strangers; two adults may love each other, yet in old age meet as strangers—like the transformations of sparrows into clams or hawks into turtledoves, without past or present.

**The Eight Strategies**
Strategies are things. The masters of divination in ancient times—skilled in reading milfoil stalks and scorched tortoise shells—could reveal the ancient within the present, the present within the ancient; the high within the low, the low within the high; the small within the great, the great within the small; the one within the many, the many within the one; humanity within things, things within humanity; the self within the other, the other within the self.

This Dao has no present in its coming, no past in its going; no summit in its height, no base in its depth; no exterior in its vastness, no interior in its minuteness; no singularity in its root, no multiplicity in its branches; no things beyond it, no self within it; no self in its nearness, no other in its distance.

It cannot be divided, cannot be united; cannot be described, cannot be pondered. Only in its undifferentiated wholeness does it become the Dao.

Water flows, thus congealing into the five essences; fire soars, thus dispersing into the five odors; wood flourishes, thus blooming into the five colors; metal hardens, thus solidifying into the five sounds; earth harmonizes, thus nurturing the five flavors. Though constant in their fiveness, their transformations are beyond counting; though things are five, their combinations are beyond reckoning.

Thus the ten thousand things between heaven and earth cannot be rigidly called ten thousand, nor five, nor one; nor can they be rigidly called not ten thousand, not five, not one. Some unite, some separate—through this, forms arise, numbers emerge, qi takes shape. Yet all is labor in vain: things do not know me, I do not know things.

Within my heart, the ten thousand things may take form. Where the heart inclines, love follows; where love follows, essence follows. Where the heart is bound, it first congeals into water. The heart’s longing for things brings forth drool; its sorrow, tears; its shame, sweat. There is no momentary state that does not endure, no enduring state that does not change.

Water generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal, metal generates water—attacking and overcoming one another in endless cycles. The infant and the alchemical maiden, the golden tower and the crimson palace, the azure dragon and the white tiger, the precious cauldron and the red furnace—all are these things, yet something beyond these things persists.

Birds and beasts may suddenly chirp, suddenly cry out, suddenly flee; plants and trees may suddenly sprout, suddenly stand tall, suddenly wither. Heaven and earth cannot retain them, the sage cannot strike them—only that which moves them endures.

Being resides there, non-being here: a drum does not sound without being struck. Even resides there, odd here: a chime does not ring without a hand to strike it. Though it is one thing, the multitude is confused by its names, seeing things but not the Dao. The worthy dissect its principles, seeing the Dao but not things. The sage unites with heaven, seeing neither Dao nor things—all is Dao.

Not clinging to it is the Dao; clinging to it makes it a thing. To know the falsity of things, one need not discard them. For example, seeing an earthen ox or a wooden horse, though the name of ox or horse lingers in feeling, the mind forgets their reality.

**The Nine Remedies**
Remedies are mixed treatments. Do not take small matters lightly: a tiny crack may sink a boat; do not dismiss small things: a tiny insect may poison the body; do not underestimate petty people: they may betray the state.

Only by attending to small matters can one accomplish great deeds; only by accumulating small things can one achieve great things; only by befriending petty people can one unite with the great. Heaven cannot be certain of people, nor can people be certain of events. Only by distancing oneself from affairs and others can I remain within myself. Only what is fitting is fitting—there is no inherent rightness in complexity or simplicity, caution or forbearance, diligence or indolence.

The height of wisdom is knowing wisdom is insufficient to encompass things, thus becoming foolish. The height of eloquence is knowing eloquence is insufficient to express things, thus becoming speechless. The height of courage is knowing courage is insufficient to overcome things, thus becoming timid.

Of heaven and earth’s ten thousand things, not one is truly mine. Things are not me, yet they cannot but respond; I am not me, yet I cannot but nurture myself. Though I respond to things, I have never possessed them; though I nurture myself, I have never possessed a self.

Do not say external things make me external; do not say externalizing myself makes my heart external. The Dao is one—it cannot be approached step by step.

One who scrutinizes the tip of a hair cannot see the vastness of heaven and earth; one who listens closely to faint sounds cannot hear the crash of thunder. Seeing the great, one cannot see the small; seeing the near, one cannot see the far. Hearing the great, one cannot hear the small; hearing the near, one cannot hear the distant.

The sage sees nothing, thus sees all; hears nothing, thus hears all.

The eye perceives countless things—some love gold, some love jade—yet this is to fixate on a single hue as the eye’s sole purpose. The ear perceives countless sounds—some love bells, some love drums—yet this is to fixate on a single resonance as the ear’s sole function.

Only the sage neither covets nor rejects, neither clings nor dwells. What excels in the present can enact the ancient; what excels in the branch can establish the root. The cunning outwit thieves to catch thieves; the brave overpower tigers to subdue tigers. Only by overcoming the self can one perfect the self; only by mastering things can one benefit things; only by forgetting the Dao can one possess the Dao.

What is too rigid invites destruction; what is too hard will break. What is too sharp invites ruin; what is too keen will dull. The phoenix’s divinity lies in its rarity—thus the sage roots himself in depth. The musk deer leaves its fragrance to evade capture—thus the sage binds himself in restraint.

A vessel with two holes, when filled with water, spills it all; close one, and the water does not flow. For ascent and descent are mutual: though a well be a thousand fathoms deep, drawing water lifts it upward. Thus the sage does not precede things.

When people err, though harm befalls them afterward, they secretly debate the error before it occurs. Only by not relying on one’s own wisdom but embracing others’ wisdom can one transcend the self and encompass all selves. Practicing this lifelong, one may never falter.

Customs differ across eras, regions, even households and individuals—how could I cling to one model to constrain later ages? Only by adapting to the times, aligning with customs, seizing the moment before action, relinquishing anger and curbing desires, simplifying affairs and forgiving others, weighing priorities to act—only then does one harmonize with the unfathomable and unite with the boundless Dao.

There are exchanges of Dao, exchanges of virtue, and exchanges of affairs. Exchanges of Dao—like father and son—transcend right and wrong, worthy and unworthy, and thus endure. Exchanges of virtue involve right and wrong, worthy and unworthy, and thus may unite or part. Exchanges of affairs part when they meet.

Do not mistake clumsiness for the Dao’s simplicity—rejoice in agility. Do not mistake dullness for the Dao’s obscurity—rejoice in clarity. Do not mistake arrogance for the Dao’s loftiness—rejoice in harmony. Do not mistake dissipation for the Dao’s vastness—rejoice in focus. Do not mistake melancholy for the Dao’s stillness—rejoice in joy. The ancients’ teachings on learning harbor many flaws—one must remedy them.

Do not condemn the world to exalt the self; do not belittle others to elevate the self; do not dismiss the Dao to aggrandize the self; do not slander virtue to glorify the self; do not disparage talent to flaunt the self.

To confound the world’s wise, it is not wisdom but foolishness that prevails. To exhaust the world’s eloquence, it is not eloquence but silence that triumphs. To subdue the world’s courage, it is not courage but timidity that conquers.

Heaven cannot make lotuses bloom in winter or chrysanthemums in spring—thus the sage does not defy the seasons. Earth cannot make tangerines grow in the north or martens thrive in the south—thus the sage does not defy customs. The sage cannot make hands walk or feet grasp—thus the sage does not defy his own strengths. The sage cannot make fish fly or birds gallop—thus the sage does not defy others’ strengths. Such is the way: one may act or rest, hide or reveal, but never be constrained—this is the Dao.

Those who speak little are not resented; those who act little are not criticized. Those with little wisdom are not burdened; those with few skills are not enslaved. Conduct yourself with sincerity, act with simplicity, treat others with forgiveness, respond with silence—your Dao will never be exhausted.

Plan according to affairs, decide by principle, act through others, and leave success to heaven. Model conduct on the present, model principles on the past. Align affairs with others, but walk the Dao alone.

Gold and jade are hard to relinquish; earth and stone are easy to discard. When encountering subtle words or wondrous deeds in the study of the Dao, beware of clinging to them. They are to be practiced, not grasped—grasping them becomes a malady of the heart, incurable by any medicine.

Those who ignore urgent matters to pursue many, other, or strange tasks will meet with poverty, disaster, and misfortune. They do not realize the Dao is everywhere—one cannot abandon this to seek that.

In worldly principles, abandoning the close for the distant, the root for the branch, the worthy for the unworthy, the near for the far—these may suffice briefly, but prolonged, they breed harm.

Those who once discoursed on the Dao spoke of it as serene stillness, profound depth, crystalline clarity, boundless emptiness, or obscure darkness. Do not, upon hearing such words, recoil in fear.

The supreme principle of the world transcends words and meaning. If you grasp that beyond words and meaning lies something higher than subtle words and wondrous meanings, you will align with my teaching.

The sage’s grand words are like gold and jade; his humble words are like platycodon and plantain. Used rightly, platycodon and plantain give life; used wrongly, gold and jade bring death.

When discussing a matter, one says it is beneficial, another says harmful, a third says it may be either, a fourth says it is both. It must fall into one of these—yet those who expound the Dao do not speak.

Affairs have their place in affairs, words have their principle; the Dao has no fixed place, words have no fixed principle. Know that words have no fixed principle, and every word becomes the Dao. Fail to know this, and even the most perfect words become obstacles or ailments.

It is easy not to trust fools, hard not to trust the worthy. Easy not to trust the worthy, hard not to trust sages. Easy not to trust one sage, hard not to trust a thousand sages.

Those who do not trust a thousand sages see no one outside, no self within, no Dao above, no affairs below.

The sage’s words are hazy, to make people deaf; obscure, to make people blind; heavy, to make people mute.

Only in deafness does one not hear sound; only in blindness does one not see form; only in muteness does one not utter words. Those who do not hear sound do not hear the Dao, do not hear affairs, do not hear the self. Those who do not see form do not see the Dao, do not see affairs, do not see the self. Those who do not utter words do not speak of the Dao, do not speak of affairs, do not speak of the self.

People merely know that within false attainment there is true loss, yet fail to know that within true attainment there is also true loss. They merely know that within false affirmation there is true negation, yet fail to know that within true affirmation there is also true negation.

Speaking of the Dao is like speaking of dreams. Those who speak of dreams say: "Such gold and jade, such vessels, such birds and beasts." The speaker can describe them but cannot take and give them; the listener can hear them but cannot receive and obtain them. Only the adept listener neither clings nor disputes.

Let the Dao be round, virtue square; let conduct be level, affairs sharp.
