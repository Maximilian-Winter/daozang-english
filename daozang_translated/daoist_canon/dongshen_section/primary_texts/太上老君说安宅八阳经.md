At that time, the Most High Lord Lao resided in the Heaven of Blessed Virtue, summoning the sacred assemblies of the ten directions, celestial deities, and earthly spirits to gather in congregation. As he expounded the wondrous Dharma, the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate, bearing a tablet, approached and addressed Lord Lao: "I observe that sentient beings in Jambudvīpa, when constructing dwellings, frequently encounter calamities. By what expedient means may the foolish be delivered?"

Lord Lao replied: "If there are good men and good women who, upon constructing dwellings, disturb the dragon deities, causing the house to creak and groan, the earth to bloom and split—whether in the southern hall or northern chamber, eastern gallery or gate, well, stove, pestle, mill, storehouse, boat, cart, lodgings, pens for the six livestock, farmsteads, or monasteries—any structure, room, gallery, or cave that offends the celestial, terrestrial, annual, monthly, daily, or hourly *sha*; the *sha* of the four directions; the earth spirits of the five directions; the Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior; the Generals and Grand Year; the Yellow Banner and Leopard Tail; the twelve hourly spirits; the Six Jia taboos; the Earth Duke, Earth Mother, Earth Mansion, Crouching Dragon, and all malign *sha*—they should recite this scripture to expiate and offer repentance. All offended deities and *sha* will then conceal themselves, be banished to the four directions, and each be pacified in their respective quarters, daring not to cause harm. By reciting this scripture, all evil ghosts will dissipate of themselves, illnesses will be dispelled, the body will grow strong and light. The merit of reciting this scripture is boundless.

If good men and good women, when safeguarding silkworms and mulberries, recite this scripture with sincere devotion, they will receive blessed retribution. Or, when constructing dwellings, repairing granaries, cattle pens, horse stables, pigsties, or chicken coops, or when excavating and breaking ground, reciting this scripture three times to a hundred times will ensure the Earth Mansion’s harmonious generation, the union of yin and yang, favorable orientation and seating, the dragon deities’ protection, and the convergence of a hundred blessings. Their households will be at peace, free from all obstacles, all prayers answered, and all aspirations fulfilled."

Upon hearing this scripture, the great assembly rejoiced exceedingly, paid their respects, and departed, faithfully receiving and upholding it.

Here ends *The Scripture of the Eight Yang for Pacifying Dwellings*, Spoken by the Most High Lord Lao.
