The Supreme Lord Laozi said: The Dao emerges from formlessness, nameless and soundless, colorless and tasteless. It is serene, taking emptiness and nothingness as its essence, spontaneity as its life, and the subtle, mysterious, and primordial qi as its root, possessing the power of the boundless. It has no exterior or interior, no above or below, no before or after, existing as a unified whole, born before Heaven and Earth. Its subtlety and vastness pervade all, yet it cannot be named, and so it is called the Dao.

When united, it becomes primordial qi; when dispersed, it forms Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth converge once every three hundred and sixty billion myriad years. Their fate is determined by the numbers three, five, seven, and nine, at which point their lifespan is exhausted. When their lifespan ends, yang essence transforms into fire, and yin essence transforms into water. First, fire burns from above, reaching the Six Heavens, and from below, reaching the Nine Earths. Then water levels them, merging all into one. After another three hundred and sixty billion myriad years, it opens again, and primordial qi is once more differentiated—pure qi becomes Heaven, turbid qi becomes Earth. Heaven is dark and clear; Earth is fundamental and yellow. The essence of the Great Yang becomes the sun; the essence of the Great Yin becomes the moon. The essences of the sun and moon further divide to form the twenty-eight lunar lodges and the stars. Heaven has the four seasons, the five phases, the six jia stems, and the twelve hours. When the qi of Heaven and Earth intermingle, then people, birds, beasts, grasses, trees, crawling creatures, and wriggling beings all flourish and come into being. Thus arise the Five Peaks, the Four Waterways, and the thirty-six mountains, which bring forth clouds and rain. The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors are established, and the lineages of the hundred clans successively give birth to descendants.

In this manner, primordial qi converges and diverges without end. From beginning to end, countless hundreds of millions of years have passed, and the cycles of convergence and divergence cannot be reckoned. When the time of Heaven and Earth’s end arrives, all forms and images of the myriad things dissolve into emptiness. Only the perfected ones and Daoist adepts, whose merit and virtue are boundless, can undergo myriad transformations, refine and alter their forms, and dwell above the Nine Heavens of the Mysterious Primordium. Thus, they transcend the countless transformations of Heaven and Earth over hundreds of millions of years, possessing this boundless qi. At this time, only the numinous primordial qi remains. Primordial qi takes the Dao as its origin, and so nothing in the world surpasses the Dao.

The Six Directions of Heaven and Earth are like an egg or a wheel, with primordial qi encircling them like the halo of the sun. This is the dispersion of primordial essence. The central region of the Six Directions spans eighteen thousand li in each direction. This mountain is entirely composed of gold, glass, and crystal at its summit. Its palaces, grasses, trees, birds, and beasts all take the forms of the seven treasures. Above it lies the domain of the Heavenly Thearch, who records the thirty-six thousand spirits of the world. All things that die belong to Mount Kunlun. Above it are the Nine Heavens. The Nine Heavens are a collective name, comprising tens of millions of layers of heavens. Yet the great expanse is bounded by nine, for nine is the ultimate number. The palaces of the various heavens all hang in the void. It is said that the people of Heaven possess ethereal bodies, capable of flight, with eyes that see subtly and ears that hear faintly. They transform across the Three Heavens, residing in the realm of the Supreme True Dao. Only those with the greatest merit and virtue are born in this heaven. Below this heaven, beings are born in various layers according to the measure of their merit and virtue.

Below Mount Kunlun are the Nine Earths. Beneath the Earth is a layer of water, and beneath the water is wind. Each of the wind and water layers has nine strata, mutually supporting one another. When the Earth trembles today, it is due to the movement of wind and water. When a ruler possesses great merit and virtue, if there is grievous injustice, Heaven and Earth move in response, and spirits and gods are stirred. Beneath these Nine Earths are the offices of various ghosts and the hells. There are also hells within the Nine Heavens. Above the Nine Heavens dwell the immortals and sages. Below the Nine Heavens reside the ghosts and spirits, governed by the current corrupt officials and deceitful powers. Each has its own ruler, who records and governs them without the slightest error.

The Gate of Heaven lies in the northwest, and the Door of Earth lies in the southeast. The Gate of Heaven and the Door of Earth are the spirits that directly oppose each other. The eastern region is called the Celestial Hook, containing eighty-one states, spanning eighty-one thousand li in length and breadth—this is the present land of the earth. South of the mountain is the Flaming Heaven, with sixty-four states spanning sixty-four thousand li. West of the mountain is the Plain Heaven, with forty-nine states spanning forty-nine thousand li. North of the mountain is the Dark Heaven, with twenty-five states spanning twenty-five thousand li. The people of these four heavens inhabit distinct lands, each with its own sun, moon, stars, Five Peaks, Four Waterways, and thirty-six mountains. The beings born in these three heavens differ due to the karmic retribution of human sins and blessings. Thus, the records do not describe them. From ancient times to the present, when Heaven generates sages, it does not allow them to be spoken of. Only in this land do rulers and ministers, fathers and sons, superiors and inferiors, good and evil exist. The people of this heaven endure the greatest suffering—plowing, weaving, taxes, labor, hunger, thirst, illness, government, and the pain of life and death.

If one can fulfill the Dao’s precepts in life, then seven days after death, they will be reborn in the blissful abodes of the various heavens, dwelling eternally in the qi of the Dao, free from punishment, with blessings flowing to their descendants and the ability to absolve the heavy sins of seven generations. If reborn among humans, they will surely become descendants of the noble and wealthy. If one’s life is filled with evil and devoid of good, upon death they will enter hell, where their hun and po souls are tormented with every kind of suffering. Their sins are tallied, and they must repay their debts through labor. If they are reborn as humans, they will surely be born among the lowly, the foolish, and the ignorant.

Beyond the Four Heavens of Kunlun lies the Iron Enclosure Mountain, and beyond that mountain stretches a realm untouched by sun or moon, called the Eight Dark Realms. There stands the throne of the Lord of Mount Tai, who governs the prisons of the underworld. When a person dies, they are brought before him, where their sins and merits are examined and recorded, after which they are dispatched to the various hells. Within those hells are scalding cauldrons, grinding wheels, copper pillars, iron spikes, blades, and swords—agonies beyond description.

Beyond the Nine Heavens and Nine Earths, beyond the four directions of Kunlun, the Six Directions end here. Beyond this, only primordial qi envelops the boundless void, where even sages and worthies cannot discern the truth. The qi of Earth is yellow, and yellow governs the center; thus, Kunlun Mountain is like the hub of a wheel, from which the Six Directions extend.

Now, the sun and moon emerge from Tang Valley, where grows a tree called Fusang. At dawn, the sun ascends its upper half to traverse the sky, and at dusk, it sinks into Mengfan. Mengfan and Tang Valley are both names of waters, connected to the single layer of water beneath the earth. Thus, the earth moves in tandem with the sun and moon, their rising and setting, waxing and waning, and the mechanisms of the celestial balance all originate from this. Here, the transformations of heaven and earth, life and death, reach their limit.

Within the Six Directions, life and death arise in endless succession. Take heed, child: if you wish to escape the sorrows of the Three Offices, you must uphold the precepts and commandments, honor your master, and contemplate the Dao. The Dao does not deceive. It abides in the world, lifetime after lifetime, delivering all beings. Whether one becomes an emperor, a lowly official, an ordinary person, a cripple, a beggar, a beast, an aged creature, or a star, none can fathom its workings.

If the wise cultivate goodness without evil and amass sufficient merit, they may ascend to heaven in broad daylight. Even those who achieve *shijie* immortality through corpse liberation cannot escape this: when their allotted lifespan ends, they too must face death. Humans are bound by fate; one must not resent the Dao.

Moreover, the inhabitants of the heavens stand thirteen feet tall. Humans range from eight feet in height downward, while ghosts do not exceed five feet. Humans are equal to heaven and earth, possessing thirty-six thousand spirits, eighteen thousand offices, and three hundred sixty mechanisms. Thus, gestation lasts ten months, reflecting the number of the ten directions of heaven and earth.

The human face bears the forms of the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, the Eight Trigrams, the Five Phases, the Six Jia Cyclical Signs, the Twelve Earthly Branches, and the Four Symbols. The Four Symbols are Wind, Water, Fire, and Earth. Only when these four qi converge is a human formed. Thus, human life begins when the harmonious union of father and mother’s yin and yang gathers the ten thousand spirits, forming a fetus within the womb—what is called the "net of illusion." Before this net is shed, one remembers all past lives. But once the first cry is uttered upon entering the human realm, all is forgotten.

The stirring of blood and vessels, the warmth of flesh and bone—all are the work of the Four Symbols. At death, when qi ceases and wind departs, the body cools as fire leaves, blood congeals as water stills, and the bones harden as earth remains. Even livestock partake of yin and yang and the Five Phases, though they do not fully comprehend them, being deemed lowly.

At birth, harmonious qi assembles the form; at death, a fierce wind dissolves the body—hence the terms "life" and "death." Thus, the laws of the heavenly Dao are natural. Therefore, the good and evil one enacts in life bring retribution as inevitably as a shadow follows form or an echo answers sound. Child, you must focus your thoughts on the true and the singular to encounter this Dao. Its laws are pure and stern; they must not be applied carelessly. The Dao is ever-present in the world, never departing even for a moment—only humans remain unaware of it.

On the first day of the lunar month, the fifteenth, and the last day, the Heavenly Emperor dispatches the Six Divisions of Recording Envoys to traverse the world and record the good and evil deeds of humanity. Can one not be cautious? Can one not be cautious?

Laozi said: Since the beginning of creation, the scriptures I have expounded number in the hundreds of thousands of scrolls. Some are hidden in the Orchid Terrace, Jade Caskets, and Stone Chambers, sealed away and uncountable. By the time of King You of Zhou, when the realm fell into chaos, I arrived at Hangu Pass and taught the pass warden Yin Xi the arts of the Dao. Yin Xi attained the Dao and became a perfected one, then journeyed westward with him into the lands of the Hu. First, they practiced the Dao in the Kunlun Mountains of the Yuezhi, where the king attempted to burn them, but they were unharmed. The Dao revealed a body of empty space, its neck bearing the radiance of the sun, its form like vajra, adorned with seventy-two marks and eighty-one excellences. The king submitted and received the Dao.

Later, I composed a scripture of forty thousand words for the Hu, titled *Prajñāpāramitā* and *The Five Thousand Character Scripture of the Dao and Virtue* in thirty sections. Together with Yin Xi, I then traveled to Śrāvastī, where on the eighth day of the fourth month, I was miraculously born as the prince of the kingdom. At fifteen, I left the kingdom to study the Dao, and upon its completion, became Śākyamuni Buddha. *Buddha* is a Hu word; in Han speech, it means "immortal." The pass warden Yin Xi changed his name to Ānanda. Among the śramaṇa disciples who studied his teachings were one thousand two hundred fifty, known as bodhisattvas. *Bodhisattva* is a Hu term; today’s Daoist followers are the same. After teaching the Hu, on the fifteenth day of the fifth month, I achieved *shijie*, entrusting myself to the Mud Pill. The Mud Pill is non-action.

The Dao has no fixed name, no constant form. Sometimes it is called Śākyamuni Buddha, sometimes Vimalakīrti, sometimes the Wheel-Turning King. Through such transformations and distinct emanations, it teaches in myriad ways. Thus, those who elucidate the Dharma emulate its forms, erecting stupas, crafting clay figures, and adorning wooden images.

Returning to the Han lands, I was titled the Most High. The Great Dao is non-action; "Most High" signifies that nothing surpasses it. "Lao Jun" means one who existed before heaven and earth, possessing the qi of the Limitless—hence "old." The Dao’s laws are non-action, delighting in life and abhorring killing, with compassion as the greatest virtue.

The world’s people, unaware, slaughter living beings and pray for longevity, abandoning the affairs of non-action to pursue the works of action. Thus, plagues and pestilence spread unchecked, illnesses arise without end, and the age knows no great peace. I shall now expound the Dao of Orthodox Unity and the Covenant of Might, commanding the three myriad and six thousand spirits within the eight directions and the four seas, the hosts of immortals, celestial soldiers and horses, generals and officers, the Six Dings and Eight Historians, to subdue all perverse forces, vanquish demons and subjugate ghosts, all ascending to join the True Unity. In heaven above and earth below, no evil shall remain—all malevolent spirits and demonic hordes shall cease in an instant.

The Dao’s teachings take the master as their foundation. Thus, I transmit the Orthodox Unity Dharma to Zhang Zhennan, that his descendants through the generations may uphold its texts and teachings, enlightening the myriad people, ordaining male and female Daoists to guide and instruct the common folk. When the time comes for heaven and earth to transform, the Dao shall mark their names in the registers, mutually aiding and delivering one another.

Hearken, all worthy ones: the scriptures and precepts are the root and origin of the Dao. The Three Caverns’ scriptures, precepts, and regulations are vast, but fearing that people cannot fully prepare them, I have revealed the Covenant of Might and Orthodox Dharma to save the world’s mortals. Now, as all things unite in oneness, you must hold this in reverence.

The *Scripture of the Wondrous Beginning of the Most High* concludes.
