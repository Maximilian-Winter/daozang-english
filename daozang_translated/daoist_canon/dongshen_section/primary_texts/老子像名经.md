**Laozi Iconographic Scripture of Divine Names**
*Volume One*

At that time, the Most High Laozi, together with the Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions, the Mighty Spirits of the Ten Hosts, and boundless multitudes, traversed the infinite worlds of the Ten Directions, propagating the teachings and transforming beings.

They beheld how sentient beings had committed grave transgressions across the Ten Directions, their orphaned souls mired in suffering, enduring manifold torments. Emerging from darkness into light, they died and were reborn, drifting through the hells of the Ten Directions—some cast into the Wind-and-Thunder Hell of the East, others plunged into the Furnace-and-Coal Hell of the South, confined in the Metal-Hammer Hell of the West, or frozen in the Frigid-Ice Hell of the North. Some fell into the Scalding-Cauldron Hell of the Northeast, others into the Bronze-Pillar Hell of the Southeast; some were trapped in the Slaughter-and-Carving Hell of the Southwest, conscripted into the Fire-Cart Hell of the Northwest, hurled into the Fire-Pit Hell above, or submerged in the Filth-and-Excrement Hell below. They endured every manner of punishment, each according to their karma.

Their bodies were shattered, limbs scattered asunder, subjected to ceaseless torture day and night without respite. Profoundly moved by the suffering of beings, Laozi now proclaims these one thousand one hundred and sixty divine names of the Heavenly Worthies who manifest through transformation across the Ten Directions. By reverently invoking and extolling these names, may all beings in the infinite worlds of the Ten Directions repent their transgressions, eradicate evil, and cultivate blessings and virtue.

All you Perfected Ones, listen attentively.

Then the Most High Laozi addressed the Universal Salvation Perfected One of the East and the assembled immortals, declaring the divine names of the ninety Heavenly Worthies of the Nine Qi Infinite World of the East. Those who venerate them shall eradicate boundless sins and attain immeasurable blessings.

They broadly expound the Great Vehicle, disseminate the essential teachings of the Dao, and deliver all sinful beings, causing them to depart from suffering and attain peace and joy.

Then the Most High Laozi addressed the Universal Salvation Perfected One of the East and the assembled immortals: If you can guide and transform all beings in the infinite worlds of the Ten Directions—whether male or female—so that they all return to sincerity, reverently bow, invoke, and extol the divine names of the ninety Heavenly Worthies of the Nine Qi Infinite World of the East, they shall eradicate the karmic retributions of life and death for all beings. The sins of arrogance and neglect toward the Three Treasures, failing to cultivate reverence; violating scriptures and breaking precepts, forsaking good and embracing evil; disrespecting masters and teachers, disregarding covenants; deceitful betrayal, defying reason and refusing repayment; malicious speech, cursing and reviling; drunkenness and brawling, disdaining public and private duties; secret plotting of evil, covertly harming others; hating kin and loving strangers, harboring inner resentment and delighting in external affairs; slandering the virtuous, leading them into deviant paths; harming the good and fostering evil, feigning compliance while betraying in secret—such are the Ten Evils of the East, boundless and immeasurable, beyond reckoning.

If one now wholeheartedly confesses and repents, wishing to eliminate these ten sins, they shall not be recorded by the Ten Upright Deities of the East or the messengers of the Heavenly Emperor, nor reported to the celestial courts. After the expiration of their fate, they shall not fall into the wind-and-thunder hells of the East’s Infinite World. Their embodied spirits in life and death shall be spared the calamities of thunder and lightning. In future rebirths among humans, they shall enjoy boundless happiness.

Then the Universal Salvation Perfected One and all the assembled immortals bowed their heads in single-minded reverence, respectfully receiving the teachings.

They broadly expound the Great Vehicle, disseminate the essential teachings of the Dao, and deliver all sentient beings burdened with sins, enabling them to depart from suffering and attain peace and happiness."

At that time, the Lofty Supreme Lord Lao addressed the Perfected of Salvation from Suffering of the North and the assembly of immortals: "If you can guide and transform all sentient beings in the Boundless Realm of the North—whether male or female—so that they all return to sincerity, with wholehearted faith pay homage, extol, and praise the names of the fifty sacred images of the Heavenly Worthies in the Five Qi Boundless Realm of the North, you shall eradicate the karmic retributions of sentient beings in the cycle of birth and death. This includes the sins of killing living beings with blood, the sins of refusing to bestow alms and establish meritorious deeds, the sins of consuming living beings for sustenance, the sins of hunting with hawks and hounds to kill living beings, the sins of setting fires to mountains and harming crawling creatures, the sins of seeing the sick and not generating compassion or offering treatment, the sins of digging pits on thoroughfares to break people’s limbs, the sins of recklessly placing thorny brambles to obstruct travelers’ paths, the sins of stealing others’ spouses and deceitfully luring away their servants, and the sins of stealing sacred images, bells, chimes, and other objects.

Such are the ten evil sins of the North, boundless and immeasurable, beyond reckoning. Now, if one wholeheartedly confesses and repents, eliminating these ten sins, the Ten Upright Deities of the North and the death-recording spirits of the Northern Dipper will not inscribe their offenses. These sins will not be reported to the celestial courts, and after the end of their lives, they shall not fall into the freezing, dark, and icy hells of the Boundless Realm of the North, forever spared the suffering of lying exposed on beds of ice. In their next rebirth among humans, they shall enjoy boundless happiness."

Thereupon, the Perfected of Salvation from Suffering and the assembly of immortals wholeheartedly prostrated in reverence and respectfully received the teachings.

The Most High Lord Lao said: These Heavenly Worthies, each with bodies of wondrous golden hue, bear upon their necks flying, resplendent aureoles. Upon their heads they wear seven-jeweled lotus crowns that reach to heaven, adorned with cloud-bright, flowing, radiant hairpins. Their bodies are draped in five-cloud, variegated brocade robes, and they don garments of cinnabar radiance and flowing, shimmering skirts. Their feet are shod in square shoes of double-pearl brilliance. Each is accompanied by ten divisions of attendants: fierce soldiers of heaven and dragon, earthly immortals and Daoist adepts, demon-subduing kings, dharma-protecting perfected, vajra-holding earth spirits, celestial marshals and warriors, jade lads bearing incense, jade maidens scattering flowers, five-colored lions, and divine archers.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthies mounted the void and traversed the mist, journeying together through the boundless world of the northeast, broadly delivering all sin-laden beings, guiding them into the joyous Dao, and granting each peace.

At that time, the Most High Lord Lao addressed the Reverent and Compassionate Perfected of the Northeast and the assembled immortals: "If you can exhort and transform all good men and good women of the boundless world in the northeast, urging them to wholeheartedly submit and sincerely pay homage, extolling the sacred names of the one hundred twenty Heavenly Worthies of the northeastern Brahma qi, then they shall eradicate the sins of setting snares and nets, hunting birds and beasts, committed by both the living and the dead across generations. Next, they shall eradicate the sins of delighting in falconry and hawking, roaming to capture living beings. Next, they shall eradicate the sins of slaughtering the six livestock at year’s end to offer sacrifices. Next, they shall eradicate the sins of falsely accusing the innocent and causing them to be imprisoned. Next, they shall eradicate the sins of severing affection, separating flesh and blood. Next, they shall eradicate the sins of branding the faces of slaves and servants. Next, they shall eradicate the sins of ruining marriages and preventing harmony. Next, they shall eradicate the sins of bodily impurity and defiling the Three Treasures. Next, they shall eradicate the sins of mocking those afflicted with leprosy, madness, wind, or epilepsy. Next, they shall eradicate the sins of nitpicking and seeking out others’ faults."

Those who bear these ten heinous sins of the northeast—sins boundless and immeasurable, beyond reckoning—if now they repent with but a snap of the fingers, eradicating these ten transgressions, shall not have their offenses recorded by the Ten Upright Deities of the Northeast, the envoys of the Great One, nor reported to the Celestial Courts. Thus, when their lifespan ends and their fate is spent, they shall not fall into the Cauldron-Boiling Hell of the Boundless World of Brahmanic *qi* in the northeast, forever spared the torment of scalding and boiling. Their five limbs shall remain whole, their six viscera pure, roaming freely in the Purple Chambers and dwelling leisurely in the Crimson Palaces.

Should they be reborn among humans, they shall become teachers and models for others, enlightening sentient beings and guiding them into the Dharma’s true form. This is owing above to the grace of the One Hundred and Twenty Heavenly Worthies of the Brahmanic *qi* in the northeast, and below to the sincerity of these men and women who wholeheartedly submit and take refuge.

Thereupon, the Venerable Master of Compassion and Reverence, along with the assembly of immortals, snapped their fingers in homage and bowed in reverence to receive the teachings.

*Laozi’s Scripture of Iconic Names, Scroll the Fifth, concludes.*
*Laozi’s Scripture of Iconic Names, Scroll the Ninth.*

At that time, the Most High Laozi addressed the Longevity Perfected of the Upper Realm and the assembly of immortals: The divine names and images of the Three Hundred and Twenty Heavenly Worthies of the Boundless World of Brahmanic *qi* in the Upper Realm—those who pay homage to them shall eradicate boundless sins and attain boundless blessings.

The Most High Lord Lao said: Such Heavenly Worthies, with all forms perfectly complete, surrounded by boundless retinues of attendants, universally abide in the Immeasurable Realm of the Upper Regions, broadly expounding the Great Vehicle, disseminating the essential teachings of the Dao, delivering all sentient beings burdened with transgressions, enabling them to depart from suffering and universally attain peace and bliss.

At that time, the Most High Lord Lao addressed the Upper Region’s Longevity Perfected and all the immortals: If you can guide and transform all sentient beings in the Immeasurable Realm of the Upper Regions—both Daoists and laypersons, men and women—universally leading them to return to sincerity, with utmost reverence pay homage, recite, and extol the sacred names of the three hundred twenty Heavenly Worthies of the Immeasurable Brahma-Qi Realm of the Upper Regions. This can eradicate the karmic retributions of sentient beings, including transgressions from past lives involving bodily actions, precepts, and rituals—such as worshipping earth altars and kitchen stoves; sins of trusting in spirit-mediums and improperly venerating ghosts and spirits; sins of sharing beds with those lacking precepts; sins of gossiping and concealing improper acts; sins of promiscuity and unruly conduct; sins of forging documents to falsely implicate the virtuous; sins of cursing heaven and earth, the Three Luminaries, wind, and rain; sins of disrespecting officials and attacking others’ faults; sins of stealing the permanent property of the Three Treasures; and sins of encroaching upon the sacred lands of the Three Treasures for fields and dwellings.

Such are the ten grave sins of the Upper Regions, boundless and immeasurable, impossible to recount. Now, if one wholeheartedly confesses and repents, eliminating these ten sins, they will not be recorded by the Ten Upright Deities or the Supreme Unity of the Upper Primordial for submission to the Heavenly Courts. After the expiration of their lifespan, they will not fall into the fiery hells of the Immeasurable Realm of the Upper Regions, forever freed from the anguish of burning and torment. In subsequent rebirths among humans, they will enjoy boundless happiness.

Thereupon, the Longevity Perfected and all the immortals wholeheartedly prostrated in reverence, respectfully receiving the teachings.

The Most High Lord Lao said: Such Heavenly Worthies, with all aspects perfected, surrounded by immeasurable retinues of attendants, abide in the boundless Brahma-qi worlds below, broadly expounding the Great Vehicle, unfolding the essential teachings of the Dao, delivering all sinful beings, causing them to depart from suffering and attain peace and bliss.

At that time, the Most High Lord Lao addressed the Lifeguarding Perfected and all the immortals below: "If you are able to guide and transform all beings in the boundless worlds below, and extol the sacred names and images of the one hundred twenty Heavenly Worthies of the Brahma-qi boundless worlds, you can reduce the karmic retributions of sentient beings for their past transgressions—sins such as discarding scriptures and scorning sacred texts, gluttony from past vegetarian feasts, licentiousness and jealousy that sunders flesh and blood, misappropriating bamboo, wood, and various ritual implements of the Three Treasures, using false measures and scales to deceive others, selling goods for excessive profit, trading in ill omens and deceiving the worthy, cursing and slandering the noble and base as if they were beasts, slaughtering living beings and butchering creatures, disrespecting parents while cherishing one’s own wife and children. Such are the ten evil sins of the lower worlds, immeasurable and boundless, beyond reckoning. Now, if one wholeheartedly confesses and repents, these ten sins shall be eradicated, and the Ten Upright Deities and the Lower Primordial Unity will not record them. They will not be reported to the Heavenly Courts, and after death, one will not fall into the filthy hells of the boundless worlds below, forever spared the suffering of foul places. Reborn among humans, one shall enjoy immeasurable bliss.

Thereupon, the Lifeguarding Perfected and all the immortals bowed their heads in reverence and respectfully received the teachings.

The Most High Lord Lao said: "All such Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions are the primordial responses of the Original Beginning to qi, pervading the ten directions of life and death, pacifying and protecting lands, teaching and guiding beings. According to karmic conditions, they scatter their reflections and divide their bodies, appearing in endless transformations. With the turning of kalpas, they are sometimes hidden, sometimes manifest, opening the path to deliverance and bestowing blessings upon the ten thousand heavens. If Daoist priests, nuns, and all men and women can arouse good intentions, whether for rulers, kings, parents, spouses, children, their own families, the seven ancestors and nine lineages, or all beings under heaven and upon earth, and according to their means—whether with gold, silver, pearls, jade, tiles, stones, bronze, iron, cinnabar, or painted and embroidered images—create their likenesses, dispersing them throughout the ten directions to fill all lands, bowing in worship, making offerings, establishing temples to deliver people, performing rituals, reciting scriptures, scattering flowers, lighting lamps, confessing sins, making vows, upholding precepts, and observing fasts, they shall enjoy peace in this life, ascend to heaven in past lives, and gain immeasurable, inconceivable blessings.

If a ruler faces calamities—such as solar or lunar eclipses, stars losing their courses, floods or droughts, plagues among the people, or wars breaking out on all sides—then within sacred temples and divine altars, or in palace halls and courtyards, they should arrange twelve thousand lamps in ten concentric circles of one thousand two hundred lamps each, opening eight gates to form a complete and radiant illumination within and without. Day and night, they should bow in repentance, scatter flowers, burn incense, and take refuge in the names of the one thousand one hundred sixty sacred images of the ten directions, chanting and reciting them. They should establish grand treasure feasts, release living beings, practice almsgiving, set up a hundred high seats, and lecture on the wondrous scriptures of the Three Caverns’ Great Vehicle. Thus, the land shall be at peace, and the world shall enjoy great tranquility.

If nobles, governors, or any of the people face various dangers, they too should diligently practice these rites. In this life, they shall flourish, their seven ancestors shall ascend to heaven, they shall escape hell, and the long night shall become bright. For generations without end, they shall enjoy effortless bliss.

The method of lighting lamps may also involve arranging one thousand two hundred lamps in the ten directions, or constructing a great treasure wheel with twelve thousand lamps above. They may be set up in any location—nobles using a thousand, commoners a hundred—all following this method. At night, the lamp-light should remain unbroken; by day, it may be extinguished. On the day of dispersal, they should hold grand feasts, perform rituals, chant praises, and proclaim their merits to the heavens, gaining immeasurable blessings beyond words."

Thereupon, the Perfected Ones of the ten directions and all their retinues bowed their heads together, praised the teaching, and withdrew.
