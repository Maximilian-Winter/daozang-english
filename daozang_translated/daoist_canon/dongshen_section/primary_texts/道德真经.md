### *The True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue, Volume One*

**Chapter 1: Embracing the Dao**
The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao;
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
Nameless, it is the beginning of heaven and earth;
Named, it is the mother of the ten thousand things.
Thus, in constant non-being, one observes its mystery;
In constant being, one observes its manifestations.
These two emerge together yet bear different names.
Together they are called the profound.
Profound and yet more profound—
The gateway to all mysteries.

**Chapter 2: Nurturing Life**
When all under heaven recognize beauty as beauty, ugliness arises.
When all recognize goodness as goodness, not-goodness arises.
Thus, being and non-being give rise to each other,
Difficult and easy complete each other,
Long and short shape each other,
High and low incline toward each other,
Sound and voice harmonize with each other,
Front and back follow each other.
Therefore, the sage abides in non-action and practices the teaching without words.
The ten thousand things arise, yet he does not refuse them;
He gives them life, yet does not possess them;
He acts, yet does not rely on them;
He accomplishes, yet does not dwell in it.
Only because he does not dwell in it does it not depart.

**Chapter 3: Pacifying the People**
Do not exalt the worthy, and the people will not contend.
Do not prize rare goods, and the people will not steal.
Do not display what is desirable, and the people’s hearts will not be disturbed.
Thus, in the sage’s governance,
He empties their hearts,
Fills their bellies,
Weakens their ambitions,
Strengthens their bones,
Ever keeping the people without knowledge and without desire.
He ensures that the knowing dare not act—
Acting through non-action, nothing is left ungoverned.

**Chapter 4: The Fathomless Source**
The Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible.
Profound! It seems the ancestor of the ten thousand things.
It blunts its sharpness,
Untangles its knots,
Softens its glare,
Merges with its dust.
Submerged! It seems to endure.
I do not know whose child it is—
It appears before the image of the Lord.

**Chapter 5: Emptiness and Use**
Heaven and earth are not humane;
They treat the ten thousand things as straw dogs.
The sage is not humane;
He treats the hundred clans as straw dogs.
The space between heaven and earth—
Is it not like a bellows?
Empty yet never exhausted,
The more it moves, the more it yields.
Much speech leads to exhaustion—
Better to guard the center.

**Chapter 6: The Completion of Images**
The valley spirit does not die—
This is called the mysterious female.
The gateway of the mysterious female—
This is called the root of heaven and earth.
Subtly enduring, it seems to exist;
Its use is never exhausted.

**Chapter 7: Veiling Radiance**
Heaven is eternal, earth enduring.
The reason heaven and earth can be eternal and enduring
Is because they do not live for themselves—
Thus they can live long.
Therefore, the sage places himself last and yet comes first,
Puts himself outside and yet remains.
Is it not because he is selfless?
Thus he can achieve his self.

**Chapter 8: Ease of Nature**
The highest virtue is like water.
Water benefits the ten thousand things yet does not contend;
It dwells in places all others disdain—
Thus it is close to the Dao.
In dwelling, be close to the earth.
In the heart, be deep.
In giving, be kind.
In speech, be truthful.
In governance, be orderly.
In affairs, be capable.
In action, be timely.
Only by not contending can one be free from blame.

**Chapter 9: Balancing the Extreme**
To hold and fill to overflowing is not as good as stopping.
To sharpen and grind to a point cannot be long preserved.
When gold and jade fill the hall, none can guard them.
Wealth and honor with arrogance bring self-inflicted ruin.
To withdraw when the work is done—
This is the Dao of heaven.

**Chapter 10: The Power of Capacity**
In embracing the soul and holding to the One, can you never part from it?
In concentrating qi and attaining softness, can you be like an infant?
In cleansing and purifying your profound mirror, can you make it without blemish?
In loving the people and governing the state, can you practice non-action?
In opening and closing the gates of heaven, can you play the female?
In understanding all directions, can you do so without knowledge?
It gives life and nurtures,
Gives life yet does not possess,
Acts yet does not rely on it,
Leads yet does not dominate—
This is called profound virtue.

**Chapter 11: The Use of Non-Being**
Thirty spokes share one hub—
Where there is nothing, lies the use of the cart.
Clay is shaped into a vessel—
Where there is nothing, lies the use of the vessel.
Doors and windows are cut to make a room—
Where there is nothing, lies the use of the room.
Thus, being provides the advantage,
Non-being provides the use.

**Chapter 12: Restraining Desire**

**Chapter 12: Restraining Desire**
The five colors blind the eyes,
The five tones deafen the ears,
The five flavors dull the palate,
Racing and hunting madden the heart,
Rare goods impede conduct.
Thus the sage attends to the belly, not the eye—
Therefore he discards that and takes this.

**Chapter 13: Disdaining Shame**
Favor and disgrace are like alarm,
Regard great trouble as you do your body.
What is meant by "favor and disgrace are like alarm"?
Favor is base.
Gaining it is like alarm,
Losing it is like alarm—
This is what is meant by "favor and disgrace are like alarm."
What is meant by "regard great trouble as you do your body"?
The reason I have great trouble
Is that I have a body.
When I no longer have a body,
What trouble could I have?
Therefore, one who values the body as the world
May be entrusted with the world.
One who loves the body as the world
May be charged with the world.

**Chapter 14: Praising the Mysterious**
Look for it and it cannot be seen—it is called *Yi* (Subtle).
Listen for it and it cannot be heard—it is called *Xi* (Rare).
Grasp for it and it cannot be held—it is called *Wei* (Minute).
These three cannot be fully fathomed,
Thus they merge into one.
Its rising is not bright,
Its sinking is not dark,
Unceasing, unnameable,
It returns to nothingness.
This is called the formless form,
The imageless image,
The elusive and evanescent.
Meet it and you do not see its head,
Follow it and you do not see its rear.
Hold to the ancient Dao
To master the present being,
To know the ancient beginning—
This is called the thread of the Dao.

**Chapter 15: Manifesting Virtue**
The masters of old who were adept in the Dao
Were subtly mysterious and profoundly penetrating,
Too deep to be known.
Because they were unknowable,
I force myself to describe them:
Cautious, as if crossing a winter stream,
Wary, as if fearing neighbors on all sides,
Reserved, as if a guest,
Yielding, as ice about to melt,
Simple, as uncarved wood,
Vast, as a valley,
Opaque, as muddy water.
Who can still the turbid and gradually clarify it?
Who can rouse the stagnant and gradually bring it to life?
Those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness.
Because they are not full,
They can be worn yet ever renewed.

**Chapter 16: Returning to the Root**
Attain utmost emptiness,
Hold fast to stillness.
The ten thousand things arise together,
I thereby observe their return.
All things flourish,
Each returns to its root.
Returning to the root is called stillness,
Stillness is called returning to life,
Returning to life is called constancy,
Knowing constancy is called clarity.
Not knowing constancy leads to reckless action—disaster.
Knowing constancy brings acceptance,
Acceptance brings impartiality,
Impartiality brings kingship,
Kingship brings heaven,
Heaven brings the Dao,
The Dao brings enduring,
And one’s body is not imperiled.

**Chapter 17: Pure Customs**
The highest rulers—those below know they exist.
Next, they are loved and praised.
Next, they are feared.
Next, they are scorned.
When trust is insufficient, there is distrust.
How carefully they weigh their words!
When tasks are accomplished and affairs completed,
The people say, "We are naturally thus."

**Chapter 18: Declining Customs**
When the great Dao is abandoned,
There is benevolence and righteousness.
When wisdom and cleverness emerge,
There is great hypocrisy.
When the six relations are not in harmony,
There is filial piety and kindness.
When the state is in chaos and confusion,
There are loyal ministers.

**Chapter 19: Returning to Simplicity**
Abandon sagacity, discard wisdom,
And the people will benefit a hundredfold.
Abandon benevolence, discard righteousness,
And the people will return to filial piety and kindness.
Abandon skill, discard profit,
And thieves and robbers will disappear.
These three, as cultural adornments, are insufficient—
Therefore let them have something to which they belong:
Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity,
Reduce selfishness, diminish desires.

**Chapter 20: Different Customs**
Abandon learning and there will be no sorrow.
How much difference is there between "yes" and "ah"?
How far apart are good and evil?
What others fear, I too must fear—
How boundless! How endless!
The crowd is merry,
As if feasting on a great sacrifice,
As if ascending a springtime terrace.
I alone am inert, showing no sign,
Like an infant who has not yet smiled,
Listless, as if with nowhere to go.
The crowd all have more than enough,
I alone seem lacking.
I have the heart of a fool—how muddled!
The common people are bright,
I alone am dim.
The common people are sharp,
I alone am dull.
Vast, like the ocean,
Ceaseless, as if without end.
The crowd all have purpose,
I alone am stubborn and rustic.
I alone differ from others,
Yet I value seeking sustenance from the Mother.

**Chapter 21: The Empty Heart**
The appearance of great virtue
Follows only the Dao.
The Dao as a thing
Is elusive and evanescent.
Evanescent, elusive,
Yet within it are images.
Elusive, evanescent,
Yet within it are things.
Dark, obscure,
Yet within it is essence.
Its essence is most real,
Within it is trustworthiness.
From ancient times to the present,
Its name does not depart,
By which we observe the origins of all things.
How do I know the origins of all things?
By this.

**Chapter 22: Increasing Humility**

**Chapter 22: Increasing Humility (continued)**
To yield is to be preserved whole;
To be bent is to become straight;
To be hollow is to be filled;
To be tattered is to be renewed;
To have little is to possess;
To have much is to be perplexed.
Therefore the sage embraces the One,
And becomes the model for all under heaven.
He does not display himself, and so is luminous.
He does not assert himself, and so is distinguished.
He does not boast, and so achieves merit.
He does not strive, and so endures.
It is only because he does not contend
That none under heaven can contend with him.
The ancient saying, "To yield is to be preserved whole,"
Is not an empty phrase.
Truly, to be preserved whole is to return to it.

**Chapter 23: Emptiness and Non-Being**
Rare words are natural.
A whirlwind does not last the morning;
A sudden rain does not last the day.
Who makes these? Heaven and earth.
If even heaven and earth cannot make them last long,
How much less can man?
Therefore, those who follow the Dao
Are one with the Dao.
Those who follow virtue
Are one with virtue.
Those who follow loss
Are one with loss.
Those who are one with the Dao,
The Dao also welcomes them.
Those who are one with virtue,
Virtue also welcomes them.
Those who are one with loss,
Loss also welcomes them.
When trust is insufficient,
There is distrust.

**Chapter 24: Forced Effort**
One who stands on tiptoe does not stand firm;
One who takes long strides cannot walk far.
One who displays himself is not luminous;
One who asserts himself is not distinguished;
One who boasts achieves no merit;
One who strives does not endure.
In the Way, these are called:
"Excess food and redundant deeds."
Some things detest them,
Therefore those who possess the Dao do not abide in them.

**Chapter 25: The Image of the Dao**
There is a thing, formless yet complete,
Born before heaven and earth.
Silent and void,
It stands alone and does not change,
It moves around without peril,
And is the mother of all under heaven.
I do not know its name;
I style it "Dao";
If forced to give it a name, I call it "Great."
Great means it flows ever onward,
Flowing ever onward means it is far-reaching,
Far-reaching means it returns.
Therefore: the Dao is great,
Heaven is great,
Earth is great,
And the king is also great.
Within the realm there are four greats,
And the king occupies one of them.
Man models himself on earth,
Earth models itself on heaven,
Heaven models itself on the Dao,
And the Dao models itself on nature.

**Chapter 26: The Weight of Virtue**
The heavy is the root of the light;
Stillness is the ruler of motion.
Therefore the noble person travels all day
Without leaving the baggage wagon.
Though there are beautiful sights to see,
He remains calm and unattached.
How can a lord of ten thousand chariots
Treat himself lightly before all under heaven?
To be light is to lose one’s ministers;
To be restless is to lose one’s throne.

**Chapter 27: Skillful Means**
Good traveling leaves no tracks;
Good speech has no flaws;
Good reckoning uses no tally sticks;
Good closure needs no bolts, yet cannot be opened;
Good binding needs no cords, yet cannot be untied.
Therefore the sage is always good at saving people,
And so abandons no one.
He is always good at saving things,
And so abandons nothing.
This is called following the light.
Thus the good person is the teacher of the bad,
And the bad person is the resource of the good.
One who does not value his teacher,
Or love his resource,
Though wise, is greatly deluded.
This is called the essential mystery.

**Chapter 28: Returning to Simplicity**
Know the masculine, hold to the feminine,
And be a valley for all under heaven.
Being a valley for all under heaven,
Eternal virtue does not depart,
And you return to the state of infancy.
Know the white, hold to the black,
And be a model for all under heaven.
Being a model for all under heaven,
Eternal virtue does not err,
And you return to the boundless.
Know honor, hold to disgrace,
And be a valley for all under heaven.
Being a valley for all under heaven,
Eternal virtue is complete,
And you return to simplicity.
When simplicity is scattered, it becomes vessels;
The sage uses it, and becomes the chief of officials.
Therefore the great ruler does not carve.

**Chapter 29: Non-Action**
Those who would take hold of all under heaven and act upon it,
I see they will not succeed.
All under heaven is a sacred vessel,
Not to be acted upon.
Those who act upon it ruin it;
Those who grasp it lose it.
Therefore things sometimes lead, sometimes follow;
Sometimes breathe gently, sometimes blow fiercely;
Sometimes are strong, sometimes weak;
Sometimes are secure, sometimes destroyed.
Therefore the sage avoids excess,
Avoids extravagance,
Avoids excessiveness.

**Chapter 30: Restraining Warfare**
One who assists a ruler with the Dao
Does not dominate all under heaven with arms.
Such affairs tend to rebound.
Where armies camp, thorns and brambles grow.
After great wars, years of famine follow.
The good person aims only for results,
And does not dare to dominate by force.
He achieves results but does not boast;
He achieves results but does not brag;
He achieves results but is not arrogant;
He achieves results because he has no choice;
He achieves results but does not dominate.
When things reach their prime, they age.
This is called "not the Dao."
What is not the Dao soon ends.

**Chapter 31: Against Warfare**
Fine weapons are instruments of ill omen.
Some things detest them,
Therefore those who possess the Dao do not abide in them.
The noble person at home values the left;
In war, he values the right.
Weapons are instruments of ill omen,
Not the instruments of the noble person.
He uses them only when he has no choice.
Peace and quiet are prized.
Victory is not beautiful.
Those who find it beautiful
Rejoice in killing.
Those who rejoice in killing
Cannot achieve their ambitions under heaven.
Thus in auspicious affairs, the left is honored;
In inauspicious affairs, the right is honored.
The lieutenant general stands on the left,
The supreme general stands on the right.
This means they are positioned as in a funeral.
When many are killed,
One should mourn with sorrow and grief.
When victorious in war,
One should observe the rites of mourning.

**Chapter 32: The Virtue of the Sage**
The Dao is eternally nameless.
Though its simplicity seems small,
None under heaven can subordinate it.
If kings and lords could hold to it,
The myriad things would submit of themselves.
Heaven and earth unite to drop sweet dew,
And the people, without being commanded, distribute it evenly.
When institutions begin, names arise.
Once names exist,
One should also know when to stop.
Knowing when to stop is how to avoid peril.
The Dao’s relation to all under heaven
Is like that of rivers and valleys to the great rivers and seas.

**Chapter 33: Discerning Virtue**
One who knows others is wise;
One who knows himself is enlightened.
One who conquers others has strength;
One who conquers himself is mighty.
One who knows contentment is rich;
One who perseveres has will.
One who does not lose his place endures;
One who dies yet does not perish enjoys long life.

**Chapter 34: The All-Pervading Dao**
The great Dao flows everywhere,
To the left and to the right.
The myriad things depend on it for life, yet it does not refuse them.
Its work is accomplished, yet it does not claim credit.
It clothes and nourishes the myriad things, yet does not act as their master.
Ever without desire, it may be called "small."
The myriad things return to it, yet it does not act as their master—
It may be called "great."
Because it never regards itself as great,
It is able to achieve greatness.

The myriad things return to it, yet it does not act as their master—
It may be called "great."
Thus the sage never regards himself as great,
And so is able to achieve greatness.

**Chapter 35: Virtue of Benevolence**
Hold to the great image, and all under heaven will come to you.
They come without harm, and dwell in peace and security.
Music and fine food may make the passing traveler pause,
But the Dao as it issues from the mouth is bland, without flavor.
Look for it and it cannot be seen;
Listen for it and it cannot be heard;
Use it and it cannot be exhausted.

**Chapter 36: Subtle Illumination**
That which is to be contracted must first be expanded.
That which is to be weakened must first be strengthened.
That which is to be abolished must first be exalted.
That which is to be taken away must first be given.
This is called subtle illumination.
The soft and weak overcome the hard and strong.
Fish must not leave the depths;
The sharp instruments of the state must not be displayed to others.

**Chapter 37: Governance**
The Dao is ever without action, yet nothing is left undone.
If lords and rulers can hold to it, the myriad things will transform themselves.
When transformation stirs and desire arises,
I will press it down with the nameless uncarved block.
The nameless uncarved block—
It too will be without desire.
Without desire, through tranquility,
All under heaven will right itself.

*Tao Te Ching, Scroll One*
*(Note: Following the original text, two and a half pages—ten blocks—of Fu Yi’s *Ancient Text of the Tao Te Ching* are inserted here under the character 聖. Corrected according to *Heshang Gong’s Chapter and Verse*, without further textual notes to avoid redundancy.)*

*Tao Te Ching, Scroll Two*
**Chapter 38: On Virtue**

**Chapter 38: On Virtue**
The highest virtue does not act as virtue—thus it possesses virtue.
The lesser virtue never loses virtue—thus it lacks virtue.
The highest virtue acts not, nor does it act for any purpose.
The lesser virtue acts, and it acts for a purpose.
The highest benevolence acts, yet without purpose.
The highest righteousness acts, and with purpose.
The highest propriety acts, yet none respond—
Then it rolls up its sleeves and forces compliance.

Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue arises;
When virtue is lost, benevolence arises;
When benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;
When righteousness is lost, propriety arises.
Propriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust,
And the beginning of disorder.
Forethought is the flower of the Dao,
And the onset of folly.
Therefore, the great person dwells in the substantial,
Not in the superficial.
Abides in the fruit,
Not in the blossom.
Thus, they discard the latter and embrace the former.

**Chapter 39: The Root of Law**
Of old, those who attained the One:
Heaven attained the One and became clear.
Earth attained the One and became stable.
Spirits attained the One and became numinous.
Valleys attained the One and became full.
The myriad things attained the One and came to life.
Lords and rulers attained the One and became the standard for all under heaven.

Should this attainment be pressed further:
Without clarity, heaven might split.
Without stability, earth might erupt.
Without numinosity, spirits might vanish.
Without fullness, valleys might dry.
Without life, the myriad things might perish.
Without nobility and loftiness, lords and rulers might falter.

Thus, the noble takes the humble as its root,
The lofty takes the lowly as its foundation.
Therefore, lords and rulers call themselves "the orphaned," "the widowed," "the unworthy"—
Is this not taking the humble as their root? Is it not so?
Thus, the pursuit of excessive praise yields no praise.
One should not desire to gleam like jade or clatter like stone.

**Chapter 40: Rejecting Utility**
Reversion is the movement of the Dao;
Weakness is the function of the Dao.
All things under heaven arise from being,
And being arises from non-being.

**Chapter 41: Sameness and Difference**
When the highest scholars hear of the Dao, they diligently practice it.
When middling scholars hear of the Dao, they half-believe it.
When the lowest scholars hear of the Dao, they laugh loudly at it.
If they did not laugh, it would not be the Dao.

Thus, the established saying goes:
The bright Dao seems dim;
The advancing Dao seems to retreat;
The level Dao seems uneven.
The highest virtue resembles a valley;
Great whiteness seems sullied;
Abundant virtue seems insufficient;
Established virtue seems lax;
True substance seems mutable.
The great square has no corners;
The great vessel is late in completion;
The great tone is soundless;
The great image has no form.
The Dao is hidden and nameless—
Yet only the Dao excels at bestowing and completing.

**Chapter 42: The Dao’s Transformations**
The Dao gives birth to the One;
The One gives birth to the Two;
The Two give birth to the Three;
The Three give birth to the myriad things.
The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,
And through the blending of qi, they achieve harmony.

What people despise are "the orphaned," "the widowed," and "the unworthy"—
Yet kings and dukes use these as their titles.
Thus, things may be diminished yet gain,
Or increased yet lose.
What others teach, I also teach:
"The violent do not die a natural death."
I will take this as the father of my teaching.

**Chapter 43: Universal Application**
The softest under heaven gallops through the hardest.
Non-being enters where there is no space.
Thus, I know the benefit of non-action.
The teaching without words,
The benefit of non-action—
Few under heaven attain these.

**Chapter 44: Establishing Boundaries**
Fame or self—which is dearer?
Self or wealth—which is greater?
Gain or loss—which is more harmful?
Thus, excessive love incurs great cost;
Hoarding brings heavy loss.
Know contentment, and you will not be disgraced.
Know when to stop, and you will not be imperiled.
This is how to endure.

**Chapter 45: Vast Virtue**
Great perfection seems flawed, yet its use is inexhaustible.
Great fullness seems empty, yet its use is unending.
Great straightness seems bent;
Great skill seems clumsy;
Great eloquence seems inarticulate.
Movement overcomes cold;
Stillness overcomes heat.
Clarity and tranquility are the standard for all under heaven.

**Chapter 46: Moderating Desire**
When the world follows the Dao, warhorses are retired to fertilize fields.
When the world loses the Dao, cavalry horses breed in the suburbs.
No crime is greater than indulging desire;
No disaster is greater than not knowing contentment;
No fault is greater than the desire for gain.
Thus, knowing contentment’s sufficiency is ever sufficient.

**Chapter 47: Discerning the Distant**
Without stepping outside, one knows all under heaven.
Without looking through the window, one sees the Dao of heaven.
The farther one goes, the less one knows.
Thus, the sage knows without traveling,
Names without seeing,
Accomplishes without acting.

**Chapter 48: Forgetting Knowledge**
In the pursuit of learning, one gains daily.
In the pursuit of the Dao, one loses daily.
Losing and losing again,
Until one reaches non-action.
Through non-action, nothing is left undone.
To govern all under heaven, one must always remain without affairs.
When affairs arise, it is no longer sufficient to govern all under heaven.

**Chapter 49: Embracing Virtue**
The sage has no fixed mind,
But takes the people’s mind as their own.
The good, I treat as good;
The not-good, I also treat as good—thus attaining virtue in goodness.
The trustworthy, I trust;
The untrustworthy, I also trust—thus attaining virtue in trust.
The sage, in their presence under heaven, is reverent,
And for all under heaven, harmonizes their minds.
The people all fix their ears and eyes upon them,
And the sage treats them all as children.

**Chapter 50: Valuing Life**
Emerging into life, entering death—
Of those bound for life, ten have three;
Of those bound for death, ten have three.
Of those whose lives lead them to death’s ground, ten have three.
Why is this so?
Because they over-nourish life.
I have heard that those skilled in preserving life
Travel on land without encountering rhinoceros or tiger,
Enter battle without donning armor or weapons.
The rhinoceros finds no place to thrust its horn;
The tiger finds no place to sink its claws;
Weapons find no place to lodge their blades.
Why is this so?
Because they have no ground for death.

**Chapter 51: Nurturing Virtue**
The Dao gives them life;
Virtue nurtures them.
Matter shapes them;
Circumstances complete them.
Thus, the myriad things without exception revere the Dao and honor virtue.
The reverence for the Dao, the honor for virtue—
No one bestows these, yet they are always naturally so.
Thus, the Dao gives them life, nurtures them,
Rears them, matures them, ripens them, sustains them, and protects them.
It gives life yet does not possess,
Acts yet does not rely,
Leads yet does not dominate—
This is called profound virtue.

**Chapter 52: Returning to the Source**
The world has a beginning,
Which is the mother of the world.
Once you grasp the mother,
You know her children.
Once you know the children,
Return to guard the mother.
Thus, to the end of life, you will not be imperiled.

Block the openings, shut the gates—
And to the end of life, you will not toil.
Open the openings, meddle in affairs—
And to the end of life, you will not be saved.

To see the small is called clarity;
To guard the soft is called strength.
Use your light,
Yet return to the state of no-light,
Leaving no harm to the body—
This is called embracing the constant.

**Chapter 53: Adding Evidence**
If I had but a little knowledge,
I would walk the great Dao,
Fearing only to stray.
The great Dao is smooth,
Yet the people prefer byways.

The court is immaculate,
The fields are overgrown,
The granaries are empty.
They wear fine embroidery,
Carry sharp swords,
Sate themselves with food and drink,
Hoard excess wealth—
This is called the boast of thieves.
It is not the Dao!

**Chapter 54: Cultivating Observation**
What is well planted cannot be uprooted;
What is well embraced cannot slip away.
Thus, descendants will never cease their sacrifices.

Cultivate it in your person—
Your virtue will be genuine.
Cultivate it in your family—
Your virtue will overflow.
Cultivate it in your village—
Your virtue will endure.
Cultivate it in your state—
Your virtue will abound.
Cultivate it in the world—
Your virtue will be universal.

Therefore, observe the person through the person,
The family through the family,
The village through the village,
The state through the state,
The world through the world.
How do I know the world is so?
By this.

**Chapter 55: The Mystery’s Token**
One whose virtue is profound
Is like a newborn child.
Poisonous insects will not sting it,
Fierce beasts will not seize it,
Birds of prey will not strike it.
Its bones are weak, its sinews soft,
Yet its grip is firm.
It does not know the union of male and female,
Yet its organ stirs—
Such is the perfection of its essence.
It cries all day without hoarseness—
Such is the perfection of its harmony.

To know harmony is called the constant;
To know the constant is called clarity.
To augment life is called ill-omened;
To let the mind direct the qi is called forceful.
When things reach their prime, they age—
This is called not-Dao.
Not-Dao perishes early.

**Chapter 56: The Mystery’s Virtue**
Those who know do not speak;
Those who speak do not know.
Block the openings, shut the gates,
Blunt the sharpness, untangle the knots,
Soften the glare, merge with the dust—
This is called the mysterious sameness.

Thus, it cannot be made close,
Nor can it be made distant;
It cannot be benefited,
Nor can it be harmed;
It cannot be valued,
Nor can it be demeaned.
Therefore, it is honored by the world.

**Chapter 57: The Unadorned Wind**
Govern the state with uprightness,
Use the military with cunning,
Take the world with non-interference.
How do I know this is so?
By this:

The more prohibitions in the world,
The poorer the people.
The more sharp weapons the people have,
The more troubled the state.
The more skill and craft,
The more strange things arise.
The more laws and decrees are promulgated,
The more thieves and bandits there are.

Therefore, the sage says:
I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves.
I love stillness, and the people right themselves.
I do not interfere, and the people enrich themselves.
I have no desires, and the people simplify themselves.

**Chapter 58: Following Transformation**
When governance is dull,
The people are simple.
When governance is exacting,
The people are lacking.

Disaster is where fortune leans;
Fortune is where disaster lurks.
Who knows their ultimate point?
Is there no norm?
The norm reverts to the strange,
Goodness reverts to the baleful.
The people’s delusion has lasted long indeed.

Thus, the sage is square but not cutting,
Sharp but not piercing,
Straight but not overbearing,
Bright but not dazzling.

**Chapter 59: Guarding the Dao**
In governing people and serving Heaven,
Nothing surpasses frugality.
Only through frugality can one return early.
To return early is called accumulating virtue abundantly.
Accumulating virtue abundantly—
There is nothing one cannot overcome.
When there is nothing one cannot overcome,
No one knows one’s limit.
When no one knows one’s limit,
One can possess the state.
Possessing the mother of the state,
One can endure long.
This is called deep roots and firm foundation,
The Dao of long life and enduring vision.

**Chapter 60: Occupying the Position**
Governing a great state
Is like cooking a small fish.
When the Dao is applied to the world,
Its ghosts lose their spiritual power.
Not that its ghosts lose their spiritual power,
But their power no longer harms the people.
Not only do the ghosts’ powers not harm the people,
The sage also does not harm the people.
When neither harms the other,
Virtue converges in them.

**Chapter 61: The Virtue of Humility**
A great state is the lower reaches,
The confluence of the world.
The world’s confluence is the female.
The female always overcomes the male with stillness,
Using stillness as the lower.

Thus, if a great state lowers itself to a small state,
It will win over the small state.
If a small state lowers itself to a great state,
It will win over the great state.
Thus, some lower themselves to win,
Some lower themselves and win.
A great state desires only to unite and nurture people;
A small state desires only to join and serve others.
Both obtain what they desire,
So the great should lower themselves.

**Chapter 62: The Dao**
The Dao is the mystery of the myriad things,
The treasure of the good,
The refuge of the not-good.
Fine words can be traded,
Noble conduct can be offered to others.
Why abandon those who are not good?

Therefore, when the Son of Heaven is established,
The Three Ministers are appointed,
Though one may present jade disks followed by teams of horses,
It is not as good as sitting and offering this Dao.

Why was this Dao valued of old?
Did they not say:
Seek and you will obtain,
Have sins and you will be spared?
Therefore, it is honored by the world.

**Chapter 63: The Beginning of Grace**
Practice non-action,
Attend to non-affairs,
Taste the tasteless.
Whether great or small, many or few,
Repay resentment with virtue.

Plan for difficulty when it is easy;
Act on the great when it is minute.
The world’s difficult affairs
Must begin with what is easy.
The world’s great affairs
Must begin with what is minute.
Thus, the sage never strives for the great,
And so accomplishes the great.

One who makes promises lightly must lack trust;
One who takes things lightly must encounter many difficulties.
Thus, the sage treats things as difficult,
And so never encounters difficulty.

**Chapter 64: Guarding the Minute**
What is at rest is easy to hold;
What has not yet shown signs is easy to plan for.
What is brittle is easy to break;
What is minute is easy to scatter.
Act before it exists;
Govern before it is in disorder.

A tree as wide as a man’s embrace
Grows from a tiny shoot.

A nine-story terrace rises from piled earth;
A thousand-mile journey begins with a single step.
One who acts fails in it;
One who grasps loses it.
Thus, the sage does not act and so does not fail,
Does not grasp and so does not lose.

The people in their affairs
Often fail when near completion.
Be as cautious at the end as at the beginning,
And there will be no failed affairs.

Thus, the sage desires what others do not desire,
Does not prize goods hard to obtain.
Learns what others do not learn,
And returns to what the multitude has passed by.
Thereby he aids the naturalness of the myriad things,
Yet dares not act.

**Chapter 65: Simplicity of Virtue**
Those of old who were adept in the Dao
Did not enlighten the people with it,
But rather made them simple.
The people are difficult to govern
Because of their cleverness.
Thus, to govern the state with cleverness
Is the state’s ruin.
Not to govern the state with cleverness
Is the state’s blessing.
To know these two is also a pattern.
To constantly know this pattern
Is called profound virtue.
Profound virtue is deep and far-reaching,
And turns back with things,
Then attains great compliance.

**Chapter 66: Putting Oneself Last**
The reason rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys
Is that they excel in staying low.
Thus, they can be kings of the hundred valleys.
Therefore, if the sage wishes to be above the people,
He must speak as though he were beneath them.
If he wishes to be ahead of the people,
He must put himself behind them.
Thus, though he dwells above, the people do not feel his weight;
Though he stands in front, the people do not feel harmed.
Thus, the world delights in pushing him forward and does not tire of him.
Because he does not contend,
No one in the world can contend with him.

**Chapter 67: The Three Treasures**
All under heaven say my Dao is great, yet it seems unlike anything else.
Precisely because it is great, it seems unlike anything else.
If it were like anything else, it would long since have become small.

I have three treasures that I hold and preserve:
The first is compassion,
The second is frugality,
The third is not daring to be first in the world.
Compassionate, thus able to be courageous;
Frugal, thus able to be expansive;
Not daring to be first in the world,
Thus able to become the chief of all vessels.

Now, to abandon compassion yet claim courage,
To abandon frugality yet claim expansiveness,
To abandon the last yet claim the first—
This is death.
For with compassion, in battle one wins;
In defense, one is secure.
Heaven will save such a one,
And protect him with compassion.

**Chapter 68: Matching Heaven**
One adept as a warrior is not martial;
One adept in battle is not enraged;
One adept at conquering the enemy does not engage them;
One adept at employing others places himself below them.
This is called the virtue of non-contention,
The power of employing others,
Matching Heaven—
The ultimate of old.

**Chapter 69: The Mysterious Use**
There is a saying in the use of arms:
I dare not be the host, but rather the guest;
I dare not advance an inch, but rather retreat a foot.
This is called marching without marching,
Rolling up one’s sleeves without baring one’s arms,
Seizing without confronting an enemy,
Wielding a weapon without holding one.
No disaster is greater than underestimating the enemy;
Underestimating the enemy nearly costs me my treasures.
Thus, when evenly matched armies meet,
The one that retreats will win.

**Chapter 70: Knowing Difficulty**
My words are very easy to know,
Very easy to practice.
Yet none under heaven can know them,
None can practice them.
Words have an ancestor,
Affairs have a lord.
It is only because of ignorance
That they do not know me.
Those who know me are few,
Thus I am esteemed.
Therefore, the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade.

**Chapter 71: Knowing Sickness**
To know yet to think one does not know is best;
Not to know yet to think one knows is sickness.
Only by regarding sickness as sickness
Can one not be sick.
The sage is not sick,
Because he regards sickness as sickness—
Thus he is not sick.

**Chapter 72: Loving Oneself**
When the people do not fear authority,
Then great authority arrives.
Do not constrict their dwelling,
Do not oppress their livelihood.
Only by not oppressing them
Will they not be oppressed.
Thus, the sage knows himself but does not display himself,
Loves himself but does not exalt himself.
Therefore, he discards that and takes this.

**Chapter 73: Acting Through Non-Action**

**Chapter 73: Acting Through Non-Action (continued)**
To be brave in daring leads to death;
To be brave in not daring leads to life.
Of these two, one brings benefit, the other harm.
Who knows the reason for Heaven’s aversion?
Even the sage finds this difficult.
The Way of Heaven:
Excels in victory without contention,
Responds well without speech,
Arrives of itself without summons.
Though unhurried, it excels in planning.
The net of Heaven is vast and wide,
Sparse yet nothing escapes.

**Chapter 74: Governing Delusion**
When the people no longer fear death,
Why threaten them with death?
If the people always feared death,
And I seized and killed those who act strangely,
Who would dare?
There is always an executioner who kills.
To kill in place of the executioner
Is like hewing wood in place of the master carpenter.
Few who hew wood in place of the master carpenter
Do not injure their own hands.

**Chapter 75: The Harm of Greed**
The people’s hunger
Comes from their superiors consuming too much in taxes—
Thus they hunger.
The people’s difficulty in being governed
Comes from their superiors’ meddling—
Thus they are difficult to govern.
The people’s disregard for death
Comes from their excessive pursuit of life—
Thus they disregard death.
Only those who do not make life their aim
Are wiser than those who value life.

**Chapter 76: Warning Against Strength**
When the people are born, they are supple and weak;
When they die, they are stiff and strong.
All things—plants and trees—
When alive are supple and fragile;
When dead, they are withered and dry.
Thus, the stiff and strong are companions of death;
The supple and weak are companions of life.
Therefore, when an army is strong, it will not prevail;
When a tree is strong, it will be felled.
Thus, the strong and stiff occupy the lower position,
While the supple and weak occupy the higher.

**Chapter 77: The Way of Heaven**
The Way of Heaven—
Is it not like drawing a bow?
What is high is pressed down,
What is low is lifted up;
What has excess is reduced,
What is insufficient is supplemented.
The Way of Heaven reduces excess to supplement insufficiency.
The way of man is not so—
It reduces the insufficient to serve the excess.
Who can take excess and offer it to the world’s insufficiency?
Only one who possesses the Way.
Thus, the sage acts without relying on it,
Accomplishes without dwelling on it,
And does not wish to display his worth.

**Chapter 78: Trusting in Simplicity**
Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water,
Yet nothing can surpass it in attacking the hard and strong—
Nothing can replace it.
Thus, the soft overcomes the hard,
The weak overcomes the strong.
There is none in the world who does not know this,
Yet none can practice it.
Therefore, the sage says:
To bear the nation’s disgrace
Is to be lord of the altars of soil and grain;
To bear the nation’s misfortune
Is to be king under Heaven.
Straightforward words seem paradoxical.

**Chapter 79: Fulfilling Agreements**
When great resentment is reconciled,
Some resentment must remain.
How can this be made good?
Therefore, the sage holds the left tally
And does not demand from others.
Those who possess virtue oversee the tally;
Those who lack virtue oversee exactions.
The Way of Heaven shows no favoritism—
It always aligns with the good.

**Chapter 80: Standing Alone**
Let states be small, their people few.
Though there be tools for ten or a hundred,
Let them not be used.
Let the people hold life dear
And not wander far afield.
Though there be boats and carriages,
Let none ride them.
Though there be armor and weapons,
Let none display them.
Let the people return to knotting cords for use.
Sweet be their food,
Fair their clothing,
Secure their dwellings,
Joyful their customs.
Neighboring states may be within sight,
The cries of cocks and dogs may be heard,
Yet the people will grow old and die
Without ever coming and going between them.

**Chapter 81: Manifest Reality**
Truthful words are not fine;
Fine words are not truthful.
The good do not dispute;
The disputatious are not good.
The wise are not broadly learned;
The broadly learned are not wise.
The sage does not accumulate.
Having given all to others,
He possesses even more.
Having bestowed all on others,
He has even greater abundance.
The Way of Heaven benefits and does no harm.
The Way of the sage acts and does not contend.
