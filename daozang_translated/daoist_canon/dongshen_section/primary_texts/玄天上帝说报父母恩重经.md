**The Most High Dark Heaven Emperor’s Sutra on Repaying the Profound Kindness of Parents**

Wondrous conditions arise without cultivation; wondrous conduct accumulates without effort.
From cultivation comes cultivation; through cultivated conditions, the wondrous is realized.
From accumulation comes accumulation; through accumulated conduct, the wondrous is penetrated.
The wondrous originates from non-being; vast accumulation arises from being.
Expounding broadly on wondrous conditions, manifesting words to exhort cultivation.
Resplendent wondrous conduct demonstrates forms of accumulation.
Wondrous conditions and wondrous conduct, once cultivation and accumulation are connected—
If worldly beings, in a single thought or movement, hold both condition and conduct,
They delude themselves about their original nature, destroying non-being and losing being.
Like parents who give birth to sons and daughters:
At first, no form is seen; form is entrusted to existence.
Within being, forms arise, transforming into myriad shapes.
Hardships, suffering, afflictions, anxieties, sorrows, and grief—all arise from form.
Since I am entrusted with form, I daily afflict my parents,
Causing my parents to grieve day and night.
As my form exists, the forms of father and mother gradually decay.
Because of my form, my parents’ original forms are buried in suffering.
Parents and children cycle endlessly—
This existence of form leads all to shared suffering.
From this day forward, within my form,
I will extinguish all greed and anger, shatter all perilous peaks.
Holding equanimity in thought, I repay my original form,
So that my original form may attain great joy, free from all suffering.
Life after life, entrusted with complete form, untouched by decay,
Only then will I eliminate it.
When the original form is made no-form, attachment to form will follow,
And both will cease together.
Original form and my form—all original forms return.
When attachment to form is gone, no attachment is seen.
Non-being does not arise; non-action is unimpeded.
No obstacles, no barriers, no blockages—naturally free,
Departing from burdens, not falling into the sea of suffering.
May all faithful devotees daily uphold and practice this.

**The Dark Emperor’s Sacred Invocation for Repaying Kindness**

With sincere heart, I take refuge and bow,
To the Mysterious Origin’s responsive transformation,
The True Martial Star’s divided essence,
Who pities us sentient beings with form,
Entrusted to parents, carried for ten months,
Nursed for three years,
Enduring a thousand hardships, a hundred labors,
Each moment filled with care,
Causing our parents to gradually decay.
Now, holding equanimity in thought,
I extinguish all perilous peaks, greed, and anger,
Revere the Emperor as my teacher,
Pray for grace to repay my roots.
May my present parents enjoy increased fortune and longevity,
And my past parents swiftly attain liberation.

**Great Sage, Great Compassion, Great Benevolence, Great Filial Piety, Eighty-Second Transformation, Lord of Repaying Kindness, Protector of the Sacred, True Martial Sovereign of the World, Blessed Deity, Jade Void Preceptor, Most High Dark Heaven Emperor, Golden Palace Transformation, Heavenly Worthy.**

Formerly, the Great Emperor of Supreme Purity,
In his eighty-second transformation,
Was born as the prince to the Sacred Father, King of Pure Joy,
And the Sacred Mother, Wondrous Auspicious Heavenly Lord.
At seven years old, he left his parents and kingdom,
Entering Mount Taihe to cultivate the Dao.
After forty-two years, his merit complete, he ascended in transcendence,
Presiding over the northern realm as the Most High Dark Heaven Emperor.
Moved by the profound kindness of his parents’ birth,
He expounded this sutra.
If faithful men and women embody the Dark Emperor’s sacred teachings,
Abiding in filial devotion,
Fast for three years,
And recite the sacred invocation eighteen thousand times—
Matching the number of texts in the Daoist canon—
They repay the three years of parental nursing.
Those of determined will, who delve deeply into the sutra’s meaning
And advance diligently in Daoist practice,
Can repay the fourfold kindness even after countless kalpas,
And deliver beings from the sufferings of the Nine Dark Realms and Three Wretched Paths.
How could this merely repay parents’ kindness?

As the saying goes:
*Of ten thousand scrolls of immortal scriptures, loyalty and filial piety come first.*
And also:
*If one child cultivates the Dao, nine generations of ancestors ascend to heaven.*
This is its meaning.
