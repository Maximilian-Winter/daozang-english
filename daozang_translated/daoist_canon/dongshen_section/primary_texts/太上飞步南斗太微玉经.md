*The Supreme Jade Scripture of Soaring Steps to the Southern Dipper and Grand Tenuity*

When the Supreme Perfected King of the Great Void of the Southern Summit, the Red Lord of Mount Song (Pine Master), was studying the Dao, he arrived riding a dragon-drawn phoenix chariot to the Jade Chamber of Grand Tenuity within the Palace of Grand Tenuity. Reclining in the Vermilion Brilliance, seated in the shade of the *kumu* tree, he dissolved his *qi* into the void and concealed his spirit in non-being. The Mysterious Essence remained unopened by the Dao, and for me, he grasped the firmament with Heaven.

The Perfected Maiden of the Vermilion Radiance and Purple Numinosity of Highest Clarity cast the splendor of her gauze-like radiance beyond the luminous heavens. Soaring to the Jade Latitude, she circled the Vermilion Net, summoning the Perfected of Cavernous Yang and grasping the handle of the Southern Asterism. Roaming Grand Tenuity, her harmonious resonance echoed through the Nine Clarities. Clouds revolved and lightning filled the skies; her body merged with the profound obscurity as she gazed down upon the world.

The Red Lord possessed a golden countenance and refined endowments, his virtue square in action and round in completion. His heart was empty of dust, like the midnight moon; his thoughts severed from karmic deeds, like a lotus in water.

Hereafter, she taught the Red Lord the supreme Dao of the Highest Perfected, the *Jade Scripture of Soaring to the Southern Dipper and Treading the Stellar Path of Grand Tenuity*.

The Dao speaks of the Cavernous Void, its roots planted beyond being and non-being. The two luminaries suspend their essence in the Great Void, their luxuriant splendor spreading between the two poles. The radiant sun flows and evolves; the six stars adorn the heavens. Thus, the great image gives rise to things, and the primordial chaos issues forth its source—necessarily from the Southern Dipper, where the alchemy of refinement and tempering is accomplished.

Therefore, the six directions form the crucible’s frame, the six principles serve as the cauldron’s vessel, the Two Modes become water and fire, and expansion and contraction govern advance and retreat. The Great One presides over the furnace, the Thearch wields the tally, and the flying elixir endures for ninety million years. The Three Luminaries array their brilliance, and the host of stars order the cosmos.

Thus, Heaven is the canopy, Earth the chariot, the sun and moon the wheels, the four seasons the steeds. Girded with the Southern Asterism, adorned with the Northern Dipper, one establishes the Imperial Ultimate and creates the myriad things—such is the wondrous purport of Grand Tenuity, the esoteric words of the Highest Perfected.

The Vermilion Mound of Southern Prosperity holds the six stars in highest esteem. To tread them, one must first know their true names, then wear their true forms. One treads upon their *hun* souls, then steps upon their *po* spirits, and only then ascends the stars. After three circuits of return, the six asterisms reflect one’s form.

Practicing for five years, one becomes a Perfected of Highest Clarity. After nine years, one beholds the Six Perfected and reveals one’s utmost sincerity, becoming of the same rank as the omens. After fifteen years, one weaves the Vermilion Net with one’s hands, presiding over the myriad spirits, and rides the Six Flying Dragons to ascend to Jade Clarity.

**The Six True Stars of the Southern Dipper:**
Flowery Gate, Expansive Edge, Holding Brilliance, Exhausting Well

Six Star Talismans—First Star Talisman, Second Star Talisman, Third Star Talisman, Fourth Star Talisman, Fifth Star Talisman, Sixth Star Talisman—are inscribed in cinnabar on azure silk, each six inches square. On the third, sixth, sixteenth, twenty-third, and twenty-sixth days of the lunar month, face south, bow twice, and ingest them. The incantation reads:

*"Verdant Radiance of the Grand Tenuity, true qi opens in profound clarity. Crimson pearls and cinnabar fruits thread the jade steps’ stem, while vermilion light illumines the treasure palace. Dragon and tiger bear purple script; the Infant of Being and Nonbeing wears a brocade skirt of crimson embroidery, a jade bell girdle at the waist. Facing the Northern Clarity, you swallow awns and tread upon radiance, rising with the Emperor in shared ascent. Phoenix chariots and tiger banners escort the Perfected Ministers; I become the Master of the Dao, unshaken for a billion kalpas."*

Again, inscribe in cinnabar on azure silk, six inches in breadth, and place within a brocade pouch worn over the heart. For flying ascent or conducting affairs, all inauspicious matters dissolve—don fresh, pure garments.

**Names of the Five Stars’ *Hun* Souls:**
Jue, Zhen, Po, Lin, Ying

For the *hun* souls of the Five Stars, begin stepping from Jue, both feet advancing to Ying, traversing thrice in return. Visualize ascending the stars with five Perfected Ones, clad in vermilion robes and jade crowns, their forms like infants, accompanying you. Then let your hands hang down, pinch the tiger’s mouth with two fingers on each hand, and click the teeth five times. The ascent incantation reads:

*"Majestic and resplendent, Cavernous Clarity—Five Stars of the Southern *Hun*, revolving through the celestial pivots, descending upon the earth to receive the numinous. Crimson-robed and jade-visaged, they harmonize with me in ascent. Divine teachers and imperial companions, formless in separation or union, seated in marvel among the immortals—Great Ultimate, Great Clarity—my body flies swift as a cry, the Four Ones merging in luminosity."*

Step within a nine-foot circle of azure earth, marking the stars with green and the weft with yellow.

**Names of the Seven Stars’ *Po* Souls**

With chisel and mirror resounding like chinking metal—*Po* Souls of the Seven Stars—beginning from *Zhao* and stepping to *Pu*, traverse back and forth three times. Visualize yourself ascending the star, where seven jade maidens, clad in yellow robes and crowned with jeweled topknots, their forms like infants, accompany you. Then raise both hands, pressing the thumb to the base of the three fingers, and click the teeth seven times. The ascent incantation reads:

*"Spinning crimson, threading the rosy clouds, nurturing the radiance of cinnabar spirits—seven jade maidens of beauty, entwining the essence of heaven. Fine clouds disperse like silk; the Yellow-Robed Great Divinity sits in the sacred grass’s obscurity, inhaling and guiding the swirling mists. With me at the Dao’s pivot, the numinous transcends the dust of suffering. The golden chariot and grand carriage, dragon robes draped upon the body—sit upright in the Hall of Brightness, guarded by the myriad spirits. Ascend the Seven Luminaries, attuning to the Jade Clarity."*

Step within a nine-foot circle of azure earth, marking the stars with yellow and the weft with vermilion.

At each step of the *hun* and *po* souls, invoke one star’s name, visualizing one spirit; proceed likewise thereafter. Burn incense to the left and right.

The Way of the Flying Dipper and Six Celestial Stems measures the length of the steps, whether long or short. For every double step where the feet cannot reach the star, follow the weft as a guiding line to align with the star—this suffices for both feet. If the double step still falls short, let both feet trace the weft until one foot rests upon it. One foot treads, both feet step, treading the weft. Tread the star’s weft and void—this is the station of the Immortal King.

**Secret Names of the Six Stars**
*Vermilion Radiance, Emperor Yao, Flourishing Brilliance*—these six stars’ secret names grant immortality to those who know them. Recite them while facing the stars to unlock the radiance of the Cavernous Chambers and restrain the primordial *qi* of the myriad heavens.

**First: Precious Radiance, Jade Mystery, Supreme Perfected Dao Lord**, who governs the Elixir Jade and Rosy Flower Palace of Medicinal Alchemy.
When first ascending the first star, remove your shoes outside the mat. Step forward with the left foot, aligning the right heel with the front foot. With the right two fingers, press the base of the thumb, letting the left hand hang. Swallow the *qi* three times, visualizing the Jade Mystery Supreme Perfected Dao Lord, clad in a cinnabar brocade robe, his form like an infant, within the Celestial Star’s Medicinal Palace. His mouth emits purple *qi*, infusing your hundred bones, suffusing you with golden light, indistinguishable from the void. Forgetting your form, recite:
*"Resplendent Great Ultimate, divine radiance flowing like gold. Cinnabar splendor of the Purple Palace, supreme and exalted—transforming into a jade child, you open my golden gate. Purple clouds swirl in eddies, illuminating the Nine Clarities. In the vast and obscure, the empty vision, I forget my form in rapture. Master of life in the Emperor’s Palace, root of the supreme Dao."*
This is called *Yuexing Yuxuan* (Meeting the Star of Jade Mystery).

**Second: Cinnabar Essence, Mystic Brilliance, Precious Chamber Supreme Perfected Dao Lord**, who governs the Seven Treasures and Golden Flower Palace of Medicinal Alchemy.
When ascending the second star, press the *Shanyuan* with the right hand and the space between the brows with the left, thirty-six times. Hold the breath for seven cycles, visualizing the Precious Chamber Supreme Perfected Dao Lord, clad in a purple embroidered feathered robe, golden bells at his waist, his form like an infant, seated upon a cinnabar dais. The Dao Lord holds the Six Stars of the Southern Dipper in his hands, like a crimson thread stringing luminous pearls, their cinnabar radiance blazing through. He casts them into my *Niwan*, fixing their positions to illuminate me. My body’s spirits stand in array, like layers of pupils in the eye. Recite:
*"My body floats upon the cinnabar weft, treading the numinous essence. The Precious Chamber’s Perfected King breathes the wind and thunder, rolling pearls and kneading the ministers. Flying light enters the *Niwan*; purple and yellow revolve. The Golden Chamber’s *qi* proclaims—controlling the boundless void, my form rides the flying dragon."*
This is called *Dan Jing Lian Sheng* (Cinnabar Essence Refining Life).

**Third: Numinous Jade, Precious Radiance, Red Heaven Supreme Perfected Dao Lord**, who governs the Golden Cavern’s Rainbow City and Cinnabar Flower Radiance Palace.
When ascending the third star, cover both ears with your hands. Visualize beneath your feet a circumference of five hundred *li*, revolving like a wheel. Purple clouds churn like boiling water in a cauldron, their bubbling *qi* rumbling like thunder for hundreds of thousands of *li*. Within the starlight appears an infant, unclothed, six *fen* in length, leaping from the star into my mouth and descending to the Purple Chamber. Recite:
*"Vermilion mist merges in the cavern; starlight intertwines. Yellow mists pervade the high void, governing the Red Heaven. Connecting my heart and spirit, transforming into a jade immortal. Riding the *qi* and embracing the wind, my body enters the Jade Chamber. Laughing at the myriad beings’ humiliations, I don the imperial robes. Refining cinnabar and spreading yellow—true sovereign, true lord."*
This is called *Fei Zhen Hua Xing* (Flying Perfection Transforming Form).

**Fourth: Luminous Brilliance, Azure Void Perfected King, Heavenly Virtue Supreme Perfected Dao Lord**, who governs the Nine Spirits’ Essence, Purple Yang’s Bright Secrets, and Golden Brilliance Jade Palace.
When ascending the fourth star, let your hands hang and clasp them to the left and right, closing your eyes and holding your breath. Ascend the star, visualizing it opening like a lotus. Behold the Dao Lord, his form tender like an infant, clad in a green brocade robe, holding a golden battle-axe, seated upon a green jade lion throne. His mouth emits azure *qi*, entering my liver nine times. Envision the *qi* in my liver transforming into a precious pearl, its light flowing with majestic brilliance. Within it is a youth, wearing a black turban and azure cloak, playing a jade zither. Its sound flows smoothly, permeating my entire body, harmonious and serene. After a long while, recite:
*"Heavenly soul of the Nine Spirits, fire as younger brother, wood as elder. Radiance flourishes and flows, lush and verdant in essence and clarity. The Dao Lord wields the battle-axe; the youth plays the zither. Azure mist in subtle wonder perfumes my spirit’s window. Facing the Purple Emperor, he bestows upon me the Emperor’s Terrace. Tiger-script in the golden enclosure, establishing my rank in the Northern Clarity. My golden form flies through the void; the spirit’s way unites in obscurity."*
This is called *Ning Jing Hua Tong* (Congealing Essence and Flower Youth).

**Fifth: Supreme Perfection, Grand Mystery, Precious Immortal, Jade Emperor, Supreme Perfected Dao Lord**, who governs the Purple Radiance and Rosy Yang’s Cavernous Spirit Jade Palace.
When ascending the fifth star, cross your hands before the star and kneel, clicking the teeth seven times and holding your breath. Next, tap the *Naohu* with your hands, producing a rustling sound. Visualize wind, thunder, water, and fire erupting to the left and right. I then conceal the *qi* within the starlight’s heart, forgetting my form and abandoning life, unaware of my whereabouts. Recall my body suddenly transforming into an infant, clad in a crimson floral embroidered cloak, dissolving within. Recite:

"True Perfection transforms, and through transformation returns to the True; water, fire, wind, and thunder command the myriad spirits. Forgetting self and life-and-death, I penetrate the knowledge of the hidden and obscure. When thought fades and *qi* vanishes in slumber, heaven and earth reverse their phases. By recalling my destination, my body becomes profoundly serene—an embryonic form, fragrant and refined, its benevolent virtue returning to the origin. I transcend the divine and the kalpa’s beginning, merging with primordial chaos."
This is called *Shesheng Dunzhen* (Nurturing Life and Concealing the True).

**Sixth: Purple Imperial Crimson Chamber Mysterious Mystery Grand Emperor Jade Perfected Supreme Virtue Dao Lord**, who governs the Radiant Jade Mystery Terrace and Six-Flower Cloud Palace.
When ascending the sixth star, face the chart, bow twice, and hold your breath. Visualize the star emitting a dragon, the dragon assuming a pearl’s hue, its numinous light and purple radiance scattering boundlessly. The six stars’ hun-souls and spirit-body join hands in laughter, riding the dragon high into the azure heavens, traversing a path of myriad blossoming hues, ascending to unite with the True of the Empty Cavern’s Non-True.
Bow twice and recite:

Six *qi* vast and surging,
Become the Dao, become the Mystery.
Divine beings are without constancy,
Transforming and shifting as they act.
I enter Heavenly One,
Merging and refining the essence-wheel.
Ten thousand myriad partings and unions,
Ever seizing victory and precedence.
Ascending the Golden Palace in joy,
Following the Imperial Perfected’s simplicity.
Enveloping yin and yang,
Again radiant, again flourishing.
Sages and divine beings—
Are they emptiness, are they dust?

This is called *Shezhen Liulong* (Gathering the True and Six Dragons).

When the steps and recitations are complete, store the chart in its case, burn incense, and conclude.

The six stars of the Southern Asterism’s Vermilion Network are the supreme Dao, bestowed upon those perfected ones who attain the Way, soaring through the Jade Purity and the Jade Emperor’s lofty numen.

The Highest Clarity Cinnabar Flower Purple Spirit Perfected Woman, having first studied under the Red Lord, received this from me within the Vermilion Terrace’s Phoenix Pavilion, between the Cinnabar Jade Celestial Palace.
Those who practice this will be ranked as Immortal Ministers; those who practice this will become Supreme Perfected Ones.

The covenant requires six gold pearls and sixty feet of crimson silk to present as offerings to the Southern Asterism, honoring the Six Perfected.
Those who neglect this will not attain immortality; the Three Officials will examine their souls.

This is the essence of the supreme Dao, the mother of the true and mysterious.

The *Tai Shang Fei Bu Nan Dou Tai Wei Yu Jing* (Highest Lord’s Flying Steps of the Southern Dipper and Great Tenuity Jade Scripture) concludes.
