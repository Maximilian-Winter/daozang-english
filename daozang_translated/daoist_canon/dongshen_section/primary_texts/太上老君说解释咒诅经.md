**The Scripture on Resolving Curses and Hexes, Spoken by the Most High Lord Lao**

At that time, the Most High Lord Lao was in the immortal realm of Khotan, where he addressed Yin Xi, saying: "In the high antiquity, the people were simple and honest, their hearts upright, their natures gentle and harmonious, free from envy and malice. In this degenerate age, human hearts have grown cunning and deceitful. They no longer cultivate good conduct but indulge in wickedness, forsaking the Great Dao to rely on perverse spirits. They craft spells and curses, deliberately harming lives.

Thereupon, the Perfected One Yin Xi bowed deeply and prostrated himself, petitioning the Most High Lord Lao: 'Out of compassion for the suffering of sentient beings, who sink into the lower realms as hungry ghosts, their souls tormented and their spirits adrift, I beseech you to bestow the method of liberation, that all beings may be spared unjust suffering.'

Lord Lao said to Yin Xi: 'Listen carefully. What I am about to reveal concerns the people of the middle antiquity, who practiced malevolent invocations. They would go to the shrines of wayward spirits across the land, sketching images, inscribing names and cyclical signs, and secretly uttering oaths. They would sprinkle water, trample with their feet, glare fiercely, and contort their faces in various ways—all acts of lawlessness, wantonly harming the innocent. Whether they acted themselves or instructed others, they brought calamity upon themselves.

Good men and good women who fall victim to the curses and hexes of evil persons should bathe in fragrant water, establish a ritual arena, and invite Daoist masters of the Three Caverns to recite this scripture. The merit thus accrued is inconceivable, and their afflictions will be cured.

For men or women cursed by others, the curse may be resolved, sparing their lives. Invoke the armies of the Five Emperors of the Five Directions, each with nine million troops, to surround the disciple [Name] in the four quarters, the eight directions, above, below, and the center. Sever the malevolent spirits and banish all inauspicious ghosts, that the disciple may enjoy prolonged fortune and longevity.'

Then he spoke the incantation:

*Great is the dharma hall,*
*Heaven is round, earth is square.*
*Heaven has nine pillars,*
*Earth has nine beams.*
*Those who cast hexes*
*Bring ruin upon themselves.*
*Six pillars, three beams—*
*The hex and the curse vanish.*
*Three beams, six pillars—*
*They return to their sender.*
*Six Jia, six Yi—*
*The hex departs swiftly.*
*Six Bing, six Ding—*
*The hex cannot advance.*
*Six Wu, six Ji—*
*The hex does not arise.*
*Six Geng, six Xin—*
*The hex is not true.*
*Six Ren, six Gui—*
*The hex dies of itself.*
*May the curse be swiftly dissolved!*
*Hasten, as the law commands!*

Invoke the Generals of the Three and Five, the Envoys of the Eight Winds, the Earth Lords of the Nine Provinces, and the ancient generals with their countless troops. Seize the three souls and seven spirits of those who cast hexes with the Five Tones, and consign them to the Northern Prison of the Dark Heavens. Let the cursers’ essence-spirits scatter, their minds run wild, their heads shatter into seven pieces—*as the law commands!*

The methods for resolving curses, hexes, and malevolent spirits that I have now revealed—if good men and good women hear this scripture and recite it for others, healing their afflictions and delivering them from calamities, they will attain peace and joy, their bodies strong and light, their fortune and longevity prolonged. They will be forever free from misfortune, their karmic creditors swiftly appeased, malevolent spirits driven away, the Three Corpses cast down, and they will attain the Dao and achieve perfection."

Then Lord Lao spoke in verse:

*"Long ago, I wandered the Middle Kingdom,*
*Ascending to the highest heavens."*

"Now I come to the Land of Zhu, teaching and transforming all sentient beings.
Ninety-six kinds there are, each with its own karmic conditions.
Those who revere and believe shall transmit it to one another in turn.
With unwavering diligence, their hearts never retreat, and they shall be reborn in the Supreme Heaven.
Wherever this scripture is recited, the reciter’s lifespan shall be prolonged.
A hundred spirits come to guard and protect, and ten thousand illnesses all heal.
In this life, they attain peace and joy, their bodies firm as metal and stone.
The supreme and perfect Dao’s law dispels calamities and brings forth fortune naturally."

Then the Most High Lord Lao said: "Since the beginningless past, the hosts of immortals and sages have saved and delivered the multitudes, bringing them peace and tranquility, driving away demons and evil, resolving curses and hexes, scattering misfortune and doom, and upholding auspicious blessings."

At that time, the assembly of great sages and perfected beings rejoiced and leapt with joy, all wishing to receive and uphold it. They bowed their heads, prostrated in reverence, and withdrew.

Thus concludes the *Scripture on Resolving Curses and Hexes* spoken by the Most High Lord Lao.
