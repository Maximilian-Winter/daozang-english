---

The *Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Golden Gates Sovereign Lord’s Numinous Writ in Purple Text* was received by the Five Venerable Perfected Ones and the Lord of the Immortal Capital, who, by command of the Sagely Lord, transmitted it to the Azure Lad. The Azure Lad then passed it to Wang Yuanyou, instructing him to teach it to those whose bone structure and mystical names were inscribed in the registers of immortality—those destined to receive this text.

The Great Lord of the Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea in the Eastern Palace of Fangzhu, having purified himself in the Yellow Chamber of the Numinous Pavilion within the Cinnabar Tower for three years, then ascended in a cloud chariot of jade-green radiance, borne by the Three Numinous Ones and streaming auspicious clouds. Clad in a flying robe of kingfisher-green feathered dragon silk, he was accompanied by a thousand perfected ones from the Mulberry Grove as they ascended to the Golden Gates of Supreme Clarity to request the *Numinous Writ in Purple Text*.

Within the Golden Gates resided the Four Sovereign Lords, with the Sagely Lord seated to the left in the Palace of Vermilion Jade and Azure Space, attended by thirty thousand perfected maidens and divine women. Poisonous dragons, thunder tigers, and simurghs of the heavens stood guard at the gates, while serpents a thousand fathoms long coiled along the walls. Winged horses and great-beaked birds with outstretched talons gathered in the vast courtyard. The celestial majesty blazed resplendent, its radiance illuminating the eight directions. Mystic banners fluttered in the wind, canopies whirled in dance, jade trees chimed with resonant tones, and jasper grasses murmured like flutes. Cloud-borne songs rose in chorus, phoenixes sang upon the Azure Terrace, divine consorts harmonized in unison, and roc and simurgh danced in measured steps.

When the Azure Lad arrived, he prostrated himself and advanced, bowing his head to the north, and spoke: "Your humble servant, Fanmei, ventures to address the Sagely Emperor and August Sovereign before your throne. In former times, I governed the Great Void and presided over the flying perfected ones, overseeing the vast expanse of the Five Numinous Ones and the transcendent visions of the Mystic Masters. I ascended through the pure yang, ringing the bells of the White Fields, illuminating the Three Observances, and suffusing the wondrous awakening with misty radiance. I expanded the numinous gardens, bathed in the limpid streams of the Azure Valley. Thus, I roamed the boundless netherworlds, strode the heights of the Mystic Elders, aligned the Nine Luan with the cliffs of Lang’e, and released my flowing light above the dark splendor of the unseen. I traversed the twin mysteries, exhausted the limits of numinous vision, stilled the void in the Dragon’s Emptiness, and concealed the subtlest traces within the Cinnabar Chamber. I opened the divine portals to surrender to transformation, following the shifts of form to disperse all burdens.

At that time, my bonds were shattered, my spirit and qi subtly harmonized. I shed the Five Spirits, refined them through the empty and cavernous, leapt like a dragon into the azure ford, and roused myself with unbridled exultation. Though I was content within the Eight Observances, in truth, I remained unbound by the radiance of the heavens. Yet I reflected that true talent had not yet awakened, and the numinous uncut jade lay dormant, unpolished. I wished to scatter wind through the orchid groves, play flutes upon the cloudy shores, uplift the Seven Clarities, and cleave through the congealed darkness to reveal the obscure. I wondered: Might the *Numinous Writ in Purple Text* be granted for instruction below?"

At that moment, the Sagely Lord was embracing the transformations beyond the loom of creation, his lofty thoughts drifting afar. He was inscribing the *Great Cavern Scripture of the Mystic* to instruct the Left Ministers of the Perfected Ones and the several hundred jade maidens and numinous lads. He neither heeded the Azure Lad’s petition nor glanced up from his writing.

Thereupon, the Azure Lad prostrated himself again, advancing on his knees to renew his entreaty without cease. Then, after a long while, the Sagely Lord set aside his loom and reclined, suddenly sighing: "Your words reach the profound, your sincerity pierces the obscure—your devotion is truly utmost." Thereupon, he pointed to the empty realm, his countenance revealing compassion.

He then took up his cloud-hook zither, strummed it, and played. The pure and numinous tones resounded brilliantly, cascading into a hundred harmonies. The jade vibrations shook the Nine Voids, piercing the clarity of the Great Empyrean. He sang the *Chapter of the Divine Continent of the Great Cavern*, the *Melody of Congealed Spirits*, the *Mystic Poems and Numinous Verses*—celestial strains of the subtlest resonance, guiding the illumination of the central qi, their notes pure and luminous. The lyrics were as follows:

> The qi of the profound void and Supreme Clarity,
> The Three Primes ascend the radiant haze.
> The abyss turns to open the numinous portals,
> The Seven Gates unfurl for the feathered lads.
> The vast expanse reveals the Cinnabar Empyrean’s vision,
> The limpid solitude manifests the unseen workings.
> Awakening to the profound assembly,
> One dwells at the edge of the flying Great Void.
> The Terrace of the Intestines spans the wilds of the Great Cavern,
> The secluded and transcendent glow with the luster of divine mushrooms.
> The inherited realm veils the wheel of the void,
> The remote dwelling naturally communes with the unseen.
> The lofty assembly gathers at the Gate of the Mystic Constellation,
> The cold summit pays homage to the Jade Emperor.
> The divine radiance echoes with the crimson numinous sound,
> The empty drum resounds with the jade bell.
> The Nine Bridles guide the cloud chariot,
> Roaming freely upon the Purple Mist Peak.
> The Cinnabar Mound opens the Azure Chamber,
> The Green Court unfolds the Five Chambers.
> The Golden Gates gleam with towering majesty,
> The misty canopy shelters the Supreme Clarity Palace.
> Tasting the essence of sun and moon,
> Gazing toward the realm of the formless.
> The profound attainment awakens the Three Numinous Ones,
> Amidst the desolation of kalpas immeasurable.
> Why sit at the crossroads,
> The Five Difficulties weighing upon your breast?
> Why not ride the Red Infant,
> Mounting my Lord of the Mud-Pill Palace?
> Neither death nor life,
> Neither beginning nor end.

When the Sagely Lord finished his song, he turned to the Azure Lad, bade him sit, and served him the nectar of flowing clouds, fruits of adamantine hardness, red trees bearing white seeds, and crimson woods with azure fruits. He then commanded the Five Venerable Perfected Ones and the Left Minister of the Immortal Capital to open the cloud-brocade satchel of the Purple Calyx Jade Case and retrieve the *Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Golden Gates Sovereign Lord’s Numinous Writ in Purple Text*, bestowing it upon the Azure Lad to transmit below to those whose names were inscribed in the Jade Registers of the Mystic Palace and were destined to become perfected ones.

The Azure Lad withdrew, bowed deeply, and received the scripture, returning with it to the Eastern Palace of Fangzhu.

The *Numinous Writ in Purple Text* was the essential text for cultivation received by the Sagely Lord Li in his youth. It comprises the oral instructions of the Celestial Emperor of the Great Tenuity and the Jade Clarity Sovereign of the Purple Tenuity, the two Celestial Emperors, and the methods for attaining perfection. It encompasses the great and expansive affairs of the Supreme August One, all meticulously compiled, arranged, and applied in invocations and recitations, ordered sequentially into a single scroll. It was inscribed upon tablets of purple jade with azure-gold characters.

Thus, the Tortoise Mother wielded the brush, the Perfected Lads swept the mat, the Heavenly Consorts attended with incense, and the Jade Lads bound the pages. It was named the *Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Golden Gates Sovereign Lord’s Numinous Writ in Purple Text* and entrusted to the Five Venerable Perfected Ones and the Left Minister of the Immortal Capital, to be stored in the Purple Calyx Jade Case and encased in a satchel of cloud brocade.

Those attending the text were commanded to have ten Jade Maidens stand to its left and right, while those recording the sacred lord’s chronicles were commanded to have ten Jade Lads, who together oversaw the Daoist practitioners who had received the scripture, reporting their merits and transgressions to the Primordial Masters of the Supreme Clarity’s Mystic Realm. Major faults were to be examined by the Three Officials, minor faults would forfeit one’s life-record and shorten one’s years, grave sins would bring calamity upon one’s three generations of ancestors, while lesser sins would afflict only the offender. Disrespect would cause the spirits to depart, and defilement would cause the text to withdraw. Those who studied immortality and beheld the numinous writ were to rise and bow, washing their hands and burning incense. The celestial overseers were ever vigilant—how could one not be reverent and cautious?

None outside the lineage of transmission were permitted to recklessly disclose its passages, for to do so would violate the statutes against leaking celestial scripture.

The *Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Golden Gates’ Numinous Writ in Purple Text*, the method of "Gathering Flying Roots and Ingesting Solar Qi," was once received from the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity. It is also called *The Scripture of Cinnabar Elixir, Golden Essence, and the Radiant Water Mother*. At the time when the sun first emerges, one should face east toward the sun, click the teeth nine times, then silently intone the names of the solar soul and the five emperors within the sun:

*"Solar soul, Vermilion Radiance, Shining Veil, Green Reflections, Returning Rosy Clouds, Crimson Lad, Mystic Flame, Whirlwind Image."*

After silently reciting these sixteen characters, close the eyes and clench the fists, visualizing the five-colored streaming rosy clouds within the sun descending to envelop the entire body, down to the feet. Then visualize the five colors ascending to the crown of the head, whereupon the sunlight and streaming rosy clouds of five hues all enter the mouth. Within the sunlight and streaming rosy clouds, there further appears a purple qi, as large as the pupil of the eye, layering in dozens, resplendent amid the five lights—this is called the *Flying Root Water Mother*. Together with the five qi, it enters the mouth. Facing the sun, one swallows the rosy clouds, making forty-five gulps of qi. After swallowing the qi, swallow the saliva nine times, then click the teeth nine times and softly intone:

*"Crimson Hut, Cinnabar Qi, Round Heaven Nurtures Essence,
Receiving the yielding with firmness, the flame’s yin blossom,
Solar Orb’s Primordial Radiance, styled Great Brightness,
Nine Yangs harmonize as one, twin mists arise together,
Congealing the hun and harmonizing the po, the five qi’s essence,
Within them the Five Emperors are born, riding the light to govern form,
Gathering the flying in emptiness, the severed root attains fullness,
Head wrapped in Dragonflower, clad in vermilion and girded in azure,
Reining the Crow’s flowing mystery, rosy clouds reflect Supreme Clarity,
Bestowed the jade tablet of scripture, name engraved in the Golden Pavilion,
Feasting on morning blossoms, uniting with the Perfected in numinosity,
Soaring immortals of the Grand Tenuity, ascending to the Purple Court."*

Upon completion, bow twice toward the sun. Among the ranks of true immortals, not one in ten thousand knows the name of the solar soul. This Dao is profoundly mysterious—it is not for those who consume blood or foul flesh to hear.

On overcast days without sun, one may perform this within a purified chamber. Daoists of pure cultivation and profound resonance with the supreme may practice it without waiting to see the sun. If a Daoist abstains from grains in the mountains and forests, maintains perpetual fasting on the Five Peaks, severs ties with the dusty world, and dwells in distant contemplation of purity, by daily drinking the sun-root’s rosy clouds and ingesting the essence of the Great Yang, they will immediately feel their body suffused with jade-like luster and their face aglow with streaming light.

For those entangled in worldly affairs, unable to still their form, drifting through worldly paths with hearts ensnared by the web of glory, one should perform this on the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, thirteenth, fifteenth, seventeenth, nineteenth, and twenty-fifth days of the lunar month, following the above method ten times within a month. These days are when the solar soul descends to connect, the flying roots are full, and the water mother dispels dreams. Practicing this for eighteen years, the Supreme Clarity will refine one with golden perfection, polish one with jade radiance, and elevate one to the rank of Jade Emperor, soaring through the great void, riding the threefold splendor of the flowery canopy to illuminate the world below.

**Grand Tenuity’s Solar Qi Ingestion and Luminous Talisman**
If one cannot regularly inscribe the talisman on the night of the lunar month’s end at midnight, one must not miss the night of the odd-month’s end. On the night of the lunar month’s end at midnight, write the talisman in vermilion on blue paper, face east, and swallow it to first announce oneself to the solar soul. When ingesting the talisman, hold the breath, grasp the talisman in the left hand, and silently intone:

*"Grand Tenuity’s Cinnabar Measure Pavilion, styled Opening Brightness,
Summon the sun’s upper soul to transform my form,
At dawn I prepare in solemnity, departing from the Round Court,
Flying Flower Water Mother, Solar Root Golden Essence,
Purple reflections streaming light, styled the Five Numinosities."*

Upon completing the incantation, swallow the talisman.

The *Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Golden Gates’ Numinous Writ in Purple Text*, the method of "Gathering Yin Blossoms and Ingesting Lunar Essence," was once received from the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity. It is also called *The Scripture of Yellow Qi, Yang Essence, the Hidden Heaven, and the Concealed Moon*. When the moon first emerges, one should face west toward the moon, click the teeth ten times, then silently intone the names of the lunar soul and the five ladies within the moon:

*"Lunar soul, Warm Mist, Whispering Breeze, Fragrant Bloom, Veiled Luminance, Boundless Grace, Empty Mystery, Orchid’s Elegance, Luxuriant Splendor, Knotted Radiance, Soaring Purity, Pure Gold, Clear Luster, Steadfast Presence, Towering Standard."*

After silently reciting these twenty-four characters, close the eyes and clench the fists, visualizing the five-colored streaming essence within the moon descending to envelop the entire body, down to the feet. Then visualize the five qi ascending to the crown of the head, whereupon the moonlight and streaming essence of five hues all enter the mouth. Within the moonlight and streaming essence, there further appears a yellow qi, as large as the pupil of the eye, layering in dozens, following within the five-colored moonlight—this is called the *Flying Yellow Lunar Blossom Essence*. Together with the five qi, it enters the mouth. Facing the moon, one swallows the essence, making fifty gulps. After swallowing the qi, swallow the saliva ten times, then click the teeth ten times and softly intone:

*"Yellow Essence, Mystic Radiance, Primordial Yin’s Upper Qi,
Scattering the flourishing cold whirlwind, the numinous branches gather the stomach,
Empty waves and rippling brilliance, tempering the vessel of purity,
Lunar essence, night’s radiance, honored in the Mystic Palace,
Five Lords and Ladies, each guarding their maternal positions,
The Red Child flies in, the Infant follows in succession,
Revolving yin’s triple convergence, light and mystery pervade the ten thousand directions,
Harmonizing the hun and restraining the po, the five wombs flow in communion,
Riding the rosy clouds to fly the essence, soaring in emptiness to the east,
Head crowned with numinous clouds, radiant blossoms summon the wind,
Left girded with the Dragon Talisman, right adorned with the Tiger Insignia,
Phoenix plumes and vermilion sashes, jade pendants and golden earrings,
The soaring tree binds the slopes, styled the Wood King,
The divine foundation controls the root, waxing and waning,
Bright essence reflects within, mystic water spouts the bridge,
Bestowed the jade tablet of scripture, name engraved in the Cloud Chamber,
Feasting on lunar blossoms, uniting with the Perfected in harmony,
Soaring immortals of the Purple Tenuity, ascending to pay court to the Grand August."*

Upon completing the invocation, bow twice toward the moon. Visualize the sun and moon, whether sitting or standing as is convenient.

Among the immortals’ officials, none know the name of the Moon’s essence. Those Perfected Ones who did know it in their time—if the sky is overcast and the moon absent, the practice may be performed indoors. The essential method follows the same principles as the "Drinking Sunlight" technique. Practicing nightly, one will swiftly perceive the body radiating light, the eyes emitting flying essence.

The crucial days for this method are the second, fourth, sixth, eighth, tenth, fourteenth, sixteenth, eighteenth, twentieth, twenty-second, and twenty-fourth of the lunar month—eleven occasions in a month, sufficient to attain immortality. On these evenings, when yin and yang converge, the three *qi* overflow, the moon’s waters crystallize into blossoms, and the Yellow Spirit descends to receive them.

After eighteen years of practice, the Supreme Clarity will refine the hun-soul and replace the po-soul, illuminating them with jade light, so that one may ride the dark reins of radiance and soar through the great void.

**Purple Tenuity’s Method for Drinking Moon Essence and the Great Yin’s Generative Talisman**
If unable to inscribe the talisman at midnight on every lunar eclipse, one must not miss the eclipse of even-numbered months. The first month is odd; the second, even.

At midnight on the eclipse, write in yellow on blue paper, face east, and consume it after first invoking the Moon’s essence. At this time, one should first drink the "Luminous Spirit-Unlocking Talisman." While drinking the moon talisman, hold the breath, grasp the talisman in the right hand, and silently intone:

*"Purple Tenuity’s yellow script, named the Great Mystery,
Summons the moon’s blossom-waters to nourish the po and harmonize the hun.
In the midst of solemn rites, issuing from the Mystic Pass,
Concealing heaven and veiling the moon, the Five Numinous Ladies,
Ninefold flying radiance illumines the Mud-Pill Palace."*

Upon completing the invocation, consume the talisman.

**The Purple Text of the Great Mystery’s Scripture: Method for Restraining the Three Hun-Souls**
On the evenings of the third, thirteenth, and twenty-third days of the lunar month, at this time, the first and second hun-souls grow unsettled. The *Scintillant Spirit* drifts, the *Womb-Light* releases its form, and the *Dark Essence* stirs and calls. *Scintillant Spirit*, *Womb-Light*, and *Dark Essence* are the names of the three hun-soul deities. On these nights, they abandon the body to wander, swiftly returning to their original chamber—or else they may be detained by external spirits, captured by spectral entities, or fail to return in time, their forms scattered. If they encounter external spirits, the two *qi* will clash, agitating the *Red Child* and inducing wayward thoughts, their comings and goings formless, the heart sorrowful and the mind vexed.

Daoists must restrain and retain them to prevent their straying. The method of restraint: lie supine, remove the pillow, stretch the legs, cross the hands over the heart, close the eyes, and hold the breath for three cycles. Knock the teeth three times, then visualize a red *qi* the size of a chicken’s egg rising from within, ascending through the eyes, and emerging outward. The red *qi* expands to envelop the body, flowing downward to the feet and upward to the crown of the head, transforming into fire that encircles the body, suffusing it inside and out until it glows like burning charcoal.

Once complete, one will feel a slight warmth in the body. Knock the teeth three more times, then silently call the names of the three hun-souls—*Scintillant Spirit*, *Womb-Light*, *Dark Essence*—commanding them to halt. Softly intone:

*"Palace of the Great Mystery, Primordial Yellow and First Green,
Refine the three hun-souls within, let Womb-Light rest in peace.
The divine treasure of the Jade Chamber is born with me;
Do not move recklessly, for the Supreme Numinous watches.
If you wish to fly, you may only ascend to the Great Ultimate and Supreme Clarity.
If you hunger or thirst, you may only drink the jade essence of the returning waters."*

**The Purple Text of the Great Mystery’s Scripture: Method for Governing the Seven Po-Souls**
On the evenings of the new moon, full moon, and lunar eclipse, at this time, the seven po-souls wander and drift, roaming through filth and defilement. They may consort with blood offerings, mingle with ghosts and specters, or enter into dead corpses. They may seduce the *Red Child*, gather in licentiousness to assail dwellings, or report a person’s sins to the Three Officials and the River Earl. They may transform into *wangliang* spirits to afflict people with malevolence, or lead ghosts into the body to summon evil and slay the essence. All the ailments and afflictions of the living arise from the po-souls’ transgressions. Their nature delights in human death; their malady desires human ruin.

Daoists must govern, refine, command, and subdue them. The first po-soul is named *Corpse Dog*, the second *Crouching Arrow*, the third *Sparrow Yin*, the fourth *Swallowing Thief*, the fifth *Non-Poison*, the sixth *Expelling Filth*, and the seventh *Stinking Lung*—these are the yin names of the seven po-souls, the turbid spirits within the body.

The method of restraint: lie properly, remove the pillow, stretch the legs, and cover the ears with the palms so the fingertips meet at the nape. Hold the breath for seven cycles, knock the teeth seven times, and visualize a white *qi* the size of a small bean at the tip of the nose. Gradually, it expands to envelop the body in nine layers, descending to the feet and ascending to the crown of the head.

Once complete, the white *qi* suddenly transforms into celestial beasts: two Azure Dragons in the eyes, facing outward; two White Tigers in the nostrils, also facing outward; a Vermilion Phoenix above the heart, facing the mouth; a Dark Tortoise beneath the left foot; a Numinous Serpent beneath the right foot. In the ears stand Jade Maidens, clad in dark brocade, guarding the ear gates, each holding a flame in hand.

After a long while, when all is complete, swallow saliva seven times, knock the teeth seven times, and call the names of the seven po-souls. Then softly intone:

*"Ninefold white qi revolves, restraining the po-souls’ malevolence.
Celestial beasts guard the gates; maidens hold the passes.
Refine the po-souls to harmony, that they may dwell peacefully with me.
Do not move recklessly; observe and examine the source of form.
If you hunger or thirst, you may only drink the moon’s yellow and the sun’s cinnabar."*

Upon completing the invocation, the seven po-souls will be inwardly restrained, bound to obedience.

If practiced regularly, the turbid po-souls will gradually dissipate below, returning to harmonize with the body. They will ascend to unite with the Three Palaces, merging with the primordial to attain numinous union.

Within the human body reside the gods of the Three Primordial Palaces: the Great Lord of the Mysterious Pass at the Gate of Destiny, along with the gods of the three hun-souls, totaling seven deities, all dwelling within the form. These are the lords of great benevolence and supreme fortune, desiring to grant humans longevity. The seven po-souls, also born within the body, act as rebels that assail it, and thus must be restrained.

Daoists often seek the methods of immortality yet remain ignorant of the Way to restrain the po-souls, laboring in vain. The Three Primordial Palaces are located as follows: the Upper Primordial Palace resides within the Mud-Pill, its god the Red Child, named Three Primordials First, also called Imperial Minister; the Middle Primordial Palace lies at the center of the Crimson Chamber, its god the Perfected One, named Child Southern Cinnabar, also called Central Radiance Firm; the Lower Primordial Palace of the Cinnabar Field is three inches below the navel, its god the Infant, named Primordial Yang Prosperity, also called Mysterious Below the Valley. These are the Three Ones.

When seeking to restrain the hun and po-souls, first silently invoke their names, visualizing the three gods as jade-hued with golden radiance, bearing the appearance of infants. The Upper and Middle Primordial gods wear red, while the Lower Primordial god wears yellow, their heads resembling those of newborn babes. During Daoist practices and qi-absorption, likewise visualize and invoke their names.

The Gate of Destiny is the navel, and the Mysterious Pass is the pathway through which the umbilical cord once passed. Within it lies the Palace of Life, where the Great Lord resides, named Peach Prosperity, styled Union Prolonged. Clad in vermilion robes and crowned with a purple lotus coronet, he sits at the Gate of Destiny, attended by the gods of the three hun-souls. The Great Lord constantly holds the Heavenly August Symbol Talisman, which harmonizes and infuses primordial qi, replenishing the womb and reversing the placenta.

Before retiring at night, first hold the breath for twenty-four cycles, then silently invoke the Great Lord’s name three times. Swallow saliva fifty times, knock the teeth thrice, and softly intone:

*"Great Spirit of the Womb, Heavenly August Lord of the Imperial Net,
Holding the Womb Talisman, crowned with a purple coronet,
Yellow revolves, red transforms, ascending to refine the Gate of Destiny,
Transforming spirit to rebirth, the Six Harmonies intermingle,
The body gleams with radiance, jade maidens dwell within."*

After completing the invocation, if practiced regularly for eighteen years, the Great Lord will be able to stir the Three Fields on the left and guide the Three Qi on the right. The fields will transform into soaring flight, and the qi will metamorphose into a dark dragon. Above, he commands the twenty-four spirits; below, he directs the hun-souls. He summons the Six Jia of the Yang Bureau and the Six Ding of the Yin Bureau, leading a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders to ascend to heaven in broad daylight—all through the influence of Lord Peach.

**The Heavenly August Symbol Talisman of the Supreme Emperor Lord of the Golden Watchtower of Highest Clarity**
Also called the *Nine Revolutions of the Primordial Five Penetrations Eight Intervals Talisman of the Emperor Lord*.

If performing the ritual in a separate chamber, first inscribe this talisman, place it in a brocade pouch, and wear it before proceeding. The Heavenly August Symbol Talisman is bestowed upon the Great Lord of the Life Palace, Peach Prosperity Union Prolonged, to harmonize primordial qi and govern the womb’s essence.

Inscribe it in vermilion on blue paper. On the first day of the lunar month and the night of the full moon, face north, hold the talisman in the left hand, hold the breath, and silently intone:

*"Celestial Writ of the Heavenly Emperor, numinous talisman of the August Symbol,
Harmonizing primordial qi, governing essence to reverse the womb,
Eternal Infant of ten thousand years, soaring immortal at the Heavenly Pivot,
Great Lord of the Life Palace, clad in vermilion, crowned in purple,
Conspire with me in this endeavor."*

Upon completing the invocation, ingest the talisman, then rise and bow twice. Perform this ritual while lying in bed. If a Daoist practices the Way of Returning Essence, cycling yellow to red, infusing the morning’s essence to irrigate destiny, channeling fluids to nourish the elixir, causing both man and woman to share the cinnabar radiance and a jade-like complexion, they should know the essential name of the Great Lord and ingest the Symbol Talisman to attain agelessness.

If one merely performs the practices without knowing the gods’ names, returns essence without ingesting this talisman, remains ignorant of its invocations, or fails to discern the palaces where the gods reside, even if they attain a thousand years of life, they will ultimately return their corpse to the Great Yin, accumulating eons of existence only to surrender their bones to the Three Bureaus.

When Daoists retire at night, they should regularly visualize the Great Lord and perform the invocation. On the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month, ingest the talisman to circulate the womb’s essence—through this, they too may become immortals without the need for the arts of returning essence through male and female.

Yet governing women to seek flight or cycling qi to aspire to celestial immortality is more perilous than fire and water, swifter in destruction than axes and hatchets. Unless one possesses a heart of ashes and embraces the One, such pursuits may lead to ruin. For those of middling ability, this is like swallowing a sword and hoping the throat remains unharmed—how can success be assured?

**Taboos of the Great Spirit Lord of the Life Palace:**
Avoid consuming raw blood, burning the fur of the six livestock, or burning the skins, leaves, or any pungent vegetables, as these disrupt the womb’s qi and offend the infant spirit. Exercise caution.

Here ends the *Supreme Scripture of the Purple Texts and Numinous Writ of the Golden Watchtower of Highest Clarity, Emperor Lord of the August Heaven*.
