**The Supreme Lord Lao’s Sublime Scripture on Constant Purity and Tranquility**

The Lord Lao said:
The Great Dao is formless, yet it gives birth to heaven and earth;
The Great Dao is passionless, yet it sets the sun and moon in motion;
The Great Dao is nameless, yet it nurtures the myriad things.
I know not its true name, so I forcefully call it the *Dao*.

Now, the Dao has purity and turbidity, movement and stillness.
Heaven is pure, earth is turbid; heaven moves, earth is still.
Man is pure, woman is turbid; man moves, woman is still.
Descending from root to branch, it generates the myriad things.
Purity is the source of turbidity; stillness is the foundation of movement.

If one can constantly abide in purity and tranquility,
heaven and earth will all return to it.

The spirit of man delights in purity, yet the heart disturbs it;
The heart of man delights in stillness, yet desires entangle it.
If one can constantly dispel desires, the heart will naturally become still;
If one can settle the heart, the spirit will naturally become pure.
Then the six desires will not arise, and the three poisons will vanish.

The reason one cannot achieve this is that the heart is not yet settled and desires are not yet dispelled.
For those who can dispel them:
Inwardly observe the heart—there is no heart;
Outwardly observe the form—there is no form;
Remotely observe things—there are no things.
When these three are awakened to, only emptiness is seen.
Observe emptiness as empty—emptiness itself is empty.
When what is empty is no more, even "no-emptiness" is no more.
When "no-emptiness" is no more, profound stillness abides.
Stillness has nothing to still—how can desires arise?
When desires do not arise, this is true tranquility.
True tranquility responds to things, and true constancy attains its nature.
Constantly responding, constantly still, constantly pure and tranquil,
one gradually enters the true Dao.
Having entered the true Dao, it is called "attaining the Dao."
Though called "attaining the Dao," in truth there is nothing attained.
For the sake of transforming sentient beings, it is called "attaining the Dao."
Those who awaken to this may transmit the sagely Dao.

The Lord Lao said:
The superior person does not contend; the inferior person delights in contention.
The one of superior virtue does not act as if virtuous; the one of inferior virtue clings to virtue.
Those who cling are not called virtuous.

The reason sentient beings cannot attain the true Dao is because of deluded thoughts.
With deluded thoughts, the spirit is startled.
When the spirit is startled, one becomes attached to the myriad things.
When attached to the myriad things, greed and craving arise.
When greed and craving arise, this is affliction.
Affliction and delusion distress body and mind,
leading to defilement and disgrace, drifting through birth and death,
constantly sinking in the sea of suffering, forever losing the true Dao.
The Dao of true constancy is attained by those who awaken.
Those who awaken to the Dao abide in constant purity and tranquility.

**The Immortal Master Ge Xianweng said:**
I attained the true Dao after reciting this scripture ten thousand times.
This scripture is practiced by heavenly beings; it is not transmitted to the inferior person.
Formerly, I received it from the Lord of the Eastern Flower,
who received it from the Lord of the Golden Gate,
who received it from the Queen Mother of the West.
The Queen Mother transmitted it orally, without written record.
Now, in this world, I have written and recorded it.
The superior person who awakens to it ascends to the heavenly offices;
The middling person who attains it ranks among the immortals of the Southern Palace;
The inferior person who cultivates it enjoys long life in the world.
Roaming the three realms, they ascend through the Golden Gate.

**The Left Mysterious Perfected said:**
For those scholars of the Dao who uphold and recite this scripture,
the ten heavenly good spirits will protect them.
Then, the jade talisman guards the spirit, the golden elixir refines the form,
and both form and spirit attain subtlety, merging with the Dao in truth.

**The Orthodox Unity Perfected said:**
Where this scripture resides, those who awaken to and comprehend it
will be untouched by calamities and obstacles.
The multitude of sages guards their gate, and their spirit ascends to the upper realms to pay homage on high.
When merit is complete and virtue perfected, they resonate with the Imperial Lords.
With unwavering recitation and practice, their bodies ascend upon purple clouds.
