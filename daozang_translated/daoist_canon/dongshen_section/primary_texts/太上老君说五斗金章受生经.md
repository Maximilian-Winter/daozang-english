# 太上老君说五斗金章受生经

*The Scripture on the Five Celestial Talons and Golden Chapters for Receiving Life, as Spoken by the Most High Lord Lao*

At that time, the Most High Lord Lao resided in the Great Clarity Realm, within the Great Crimson Heaven, in the Hall of Golden Radiance. He summoned the Five Elder Thearchs, the Eastern Dipper Lord of Life-Allotment, the Southern Dipper Lord of Birth, the Western Dipper Lord of Name-Recording, the Northern Dipper Lord of Death, the Central Dipper Lord of Universal Oversight, the Nine Heavens Lords of Life-Generation, the Nine Heavens Lords of Life-Allotment, the Nine Heavens Lords of Fortune-Allotment, the Nine Heavens Lords of Registers and Calculations, the Nine Heavens Lords of Treasury and Fortune, the Nine Heavens Lords of Disaster-Dispelling and Misfortune-Scattering, the Nine Heavens Holy Mothers and the Nine Heavens Supreme Unity Primordial Lords, the Nine Heavens Great Gods of Life-Supervision, the Seven Luminaries of the Northern Dipper, the Six Controllers of the Southern Dipper, and the Lords of the Original Destiny and Life-Founding Stars of the Natal Constellations. Each was accompanied by their respective divine attendants, golden lads, jade maidens, and boundless sacred assemblies. Together they gathered, bowing in reverence, burning incense, scattering flowers, pacing the void in circumambulation, kneeling before the Dao, and attentively listening to the sacred teachings.

The Most High Lord Lao expounded the profound and wondrous, addressing the Five Elder Thearchs of the Five Directions and all the sacred assemblies, saying: "In the primordial chaos, before the division of Heaven and Earth, the primordial transformation was undifferentiated. I spread qi throughout the ten directions, completing the myriad forms, giving birth to Heaven and Earth. Embracing yin and embracing yang, the yang qi ascended to generate the various heavens, while the yin qi descended to generate the various earths. The surplus of yang qi transformed into men, and the surplus of yin qi transformed into women. The intermingling of yin and yang qi naturally gave rise to the generative transformations of humanity.

Once humanity existed, predestined karmic conditions brought forth good and evil, long life and short, nobility and lowliness, wealth and poverty. The retribution for good and evil follows as closely as a shadow follows form, as an echo responds to sound. Good deeds beget good rewards; evil deeds bring evil consequences. Planting orchids yields fragrance; sowing millet yields grain. Good conduct invites auspiciousness; evil conduct invites calamity. All karmic conditions arise from the merit of one’s deeds.

Moreover, when humans are born into the lower realm, their lives are tied to Heaven. At birth, they stand between Heaven and Earth, possessing both yin and yang, each endowed with the proper qi of the Five Phases and governed by the Five Dippers. Their original destiny and natal constellations correspond to the twelve zodiacal branches. Those born under *jia* and *yi* are allotted life by the Eastern Dipper; those born under *bing* and *ding* by the Southern Dipper; those born under *wu* and *ji* by the Central Dipper; those born under *geng* and *xin* by the Western Dipper; and those born under *ren* and *gui* by the Northern Dipper. At the moment of life-allotment, each receives the true qi of the Five Phases. The true qi intermingles, knitting the essence to form the embryo. After ten months in the womb, the embryo completes its cycle through the ten directions, absorbing the life-generating qi of the ten directions.

Encompassing the primordial beginning, it is profound and obscure. Within it lies essence—elusive and intangible. Within it lies substance—unseen by sight, unheard by sound. Detached from all extremes, it is called the Wondrous Dao. The Wondrous Dao resides within humans; it must not be lightly lost. Losing it is easy, preserving it is difficult. Many stray from the true Dao, pursuing false sources. Many indulge in lust and killing, in greed and wrath. Many sink into hell, losing their human form.

At the moment of receiving life, the Lords of the Five Dippers and the sacred assemblies of the Nine Heavens allot life, fortune, wealth, poverty, longevity, brevity, good fortune, and misfortune. All these are self-created and self-received by sentient beings.

If, during one’s time in the world, one reveres the Great Dao, makes offerings to the Heavenly Worthies, honors parents, harmonizes with the six relations, avoids jealousy and envy, greed and lust, observes fasts and precepts, performs good deeds, or receives the Three Precepts, Five Precepts, Ten Precepts, Twelve Precepts, Fourteen Precepts for Conduct, Twenty-Four Precepts, Thirty-Six Precepts, Seventy-Two Precepts, One Hundred Eight Precepts, or the Three Hundred Great Precepts; or if one cultivates the Upper Clarity Fast, the Golden Register Fast, the Three Primes Fast, the Three Sevens Fast, the *gengshen* Fast, the *jiazi* Fast, or the Natal Fast—such precepts and fasts, when upheld by good men and good women, bind them to the celestial beings. Life after life, they do not lose their human form, enjoying wealth, nobility, intelligence, and excellence among humanity. Their five limbs are complete, and their ten features are dignified.

Moreover, at birth, humans receive the true qi and golden talismanic chapters bestowed by the Five Elder Thearchs of the Five Directions. These intermingle naturally to give rise to human life.

Now I proclaim the true scripture and divine incantation of the **First Golden Talismanic Chapter of the Eastern Direction**:

*In the Eastern Direction, the Nine Qi of the Primordial Azure Heaven.*
*The Azure Numinous Primordial Elder, the Nine Qi Heavenly Lord.*
*The Perfected One holds the brush, inscribing it into the human body.*
*The virtue of Wood knits the essence, uniting with the Dao to merge with the true.*

This talismanic chapter resides in the human liver. If one suffers from liver disease, write it in cinnabar, burn it to ashes, and ingest it for an immediate cure.

The **Second Golden Talismanic Chapter of the Southern Direction**:

*In the Southern Direction, the Three Qi of the Vermilion Numinous Cinnabar Heaven.*
*The Cinnabar Numinous True Elder, the Three Qi Heavenly Lord.*
*The Lords of Life-Allotment and Record-Keeping, the revered deities of the Crimson Palace.*
*The virtue of Fire illumines the essence, uniting with the Dao to merge with the true.*

This talismanic chapter resides in the human heart. If one suffers from heart disease, write it in cinnabar, burn it to ashes, and ingest it for an immediate cure.

The **Third Golden Talismanic Chapter of the Central Direction**:

*The Universal Overseer of the Multitudes of Spirits, the Heaven of the Twelve.*
*The Primordial Numinous Primordial Elder, the Twelve Heavenly Lords.*
*The Registrar and Auditor of Records, the deity who governs the spleen.*
*The virtue of Earth stabilizes the essence, uniting with the Dao to merge with the true.*

This talismanic chapter resides in the human spleen. If one suffers from spleen disease, write it in cinnabar, burn it to ashes, and ingest it for an immediate cure.

**The Fourth Golden Talismanic Chapter of the Western Direction**:

*The Seven Qi of the West, the Heaven of Great White.*
*The August Numinous Primordial Elder, the Seven Qi Heavenly Lords.*
*The Recorder who Pacifies the Po, the deity who governs the lung.*
*The virtue of Metal fortifies the essence, uniting with the Dao to merge with the true.*

This talismanic chapter resides in the human lung. If one suffers from lung disease, write it in cinnabar, burn it to ashes, and ingest it for an immediate cure.

**The Fifth Golden Talismanic Chapter of the Northern Direction**:

*The Five Qi of the North, the Heaven of Profound Center.*
*The Five Numinous Primordial Elders, the Five Qi Heavenly Lords.*
*The Pursuer of Life and Releaser of Death, the deity who governs the kidney.*
*The virtue of Water harmonizes the essence, uniting with the Dao to merge with the true.*

This talismanic chapter resides in the human kidney. If one suffers from kidney disease, write it in cinnabar, burn it to ashes, and ingest it for an immediate cure.

At that time, Lord Lao spoke again of these Five Directional True Writings and Divine Incantations, summoning the Five Directional Dipper Star Lords to descend with these talismanic true writings and divine incantations. Each was bestowed upon the Five Dipper Star Lords, inscribed in golden script and jade seal characters, according to their respective directions. All received and upheld them, inscribing the lives of worldly people, with these sacred writings pacifying and guarding the five viscera, each residing within the human body.

All human lives are governed by the generative qi of the Nine Heavens and the life-determining spirits of the Five Dipper Star Lords. If there are those who know their root and origin, on the days beneath the Northern Dipper during the Three Origins, Five La, or their own life-bestowing birthdays, they should solemnly prepare an altar, perform rites according to their means, and offer sacrifices to the Five Directions and Five Elders—manifestations of my transformed body, the life-registering sagely hosts of the Five Dipper Star Lords and life-determining spirits. They should present offerings of money and goods to repay the assembled perfected ones, who will then inscribe their lives, allowing them to be born in the Central Kingdom and receive the sheltering grace of the Great Dao.

At the time of birth, the celestial and terrestrial bureaus permit the pledging of one’s life-bound money. Those born under *jia* or *yi* belong to the Eastern Dipper’s Nine Qi; at birth, they pledged nine myriad strings of cash. Those born under *bing* or *ding* belong to the Southern Dipper’s Three Qi; at birth, they pledged three myriad strings of cash. Those born under *wu* or *ji* belong to the Central Dipper’s Twelve Qi; at birth, they pledged twelve myriad strings of cash. Those born under *geng* or *xin* belong to the Western Dipper’s Seven Qi; at birth, they pledged seven myriad strings of cash. Those born under *ren* or *gui* belong to the Northern Dipper’s Five Qi; at birth, they pledged five myriad strings of cash.

If there are faithful men and women who cultivate myriad good roots, ensuring their goodness remains unbroken through successive lives, they must offer sacrifices to repay their life-bound money. The celestial and terrestrial bureaus each possess clear records: the Twelve Life-Bound Ones and the Twelve Treasury Spirits. Those born in the *zi* hour belong to the first treasury; those born in the *chen* hour, the second; those born in the *shen* hour, the third; those born in the *hai* hour, the fourth; those born in the *mao* hour, the fifth; those born in the *wei* hour, the sixth; those born in the *yin* hour, the seventh; those born in the *wu* hour, the eighth; those born in the *xu* hour, the ninth; those born in the *si* hour, the tenth; those born in the *you* hour, the eleventh; and those born in the *chou* hour, the twelfth. Each person possesses their own treasury of fate and fortune. If, on their life-bound day, they complete the sacrificial rites without omission, they will enjoy peace in this life, smooth passage in all endeavors, unobstructed good fortune, and the fulfillment of their wishes. Their life-bound stellar officials will constantly bestow shelter, ensuring longevity. At the time of death, they will not lose their human form but will be reborn into wealth, nobility, civil or martial prominence, with stars of fortune and emolument illuminating their destiny, womb palace, and life. They will enjoy peace, longevity, and avoid inauspicious conditions.

If there are men or women of meager fate and insufficient means to perform the rites, on their life-bound day, they may invite one or two, or three to five Orthodox Unity Daoist priests to their home or a temple. They may recite the *Precious Scripture of the Five Dipper Golden Chapters* or undertake the recitation themselves. For each recitation, they may deduct ten thousand strings of cash. Alternatively, with sincere devotion, they may invoke the Life-Receiving Heavenly Worthy, reciting a thousand or ten thousand times, ensuring rebirth among humans for three successive lives as a man, with all five limbs intact, tenfold majesty, and universal reverence, encountering the supreme and perfect Dao.

At that time, the Five Directional Five Elder Emperor Lords, the Five Dipper Star Lords, the Six Bureau Star Lords of the Southern Dipper, the Seven Origins Star Lords of the Northern Dipper, the Sagely Hosts of the Nine Heavens, the Life-Bound Star Officials, the Origin-Star Officials, the Merit Officers and Spirit Officials, the Golden Lads and Jade Maidens, and the assembled immortals, having heard Lord Lao expound this true scripture, rejoiced as one, bowed in gratitude to the Mysterious Origin, and each vowed to receive and uphold it.

Then, the Primordial Elder Emperor Lord stepped forward, knelt, and offered this verse in reverence, bowing in gratitude before withdrawing with solemnity:

*I bow to the True Origin, the Supreme Worthy,*
*With wholehearted faith in the inconceivable.*
*Such wondrous dharma I had never heard—*
*Today, at this moment, I have attained it all.*
*It illuminates darkness with radiant light,*
*And serves as a skilled physician for illness.*
*Wondrous indeed, the divine incantations and five sacred talismans!*
*I vow to take refuge and receive them all.*

Thus concludes *The Scripture of the Five Dipper Golden Chapters on Receiving Life*, as spoken by Lord Lao the Most High.
