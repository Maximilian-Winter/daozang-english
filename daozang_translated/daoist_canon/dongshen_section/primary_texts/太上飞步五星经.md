**The Supreme Scripture of Flying Steps Among the Five Stars**

When stepping among the Five Stars, before ascending the stellar *gang* and upon descending from it, first visualize the essences of the Five Stars within your five viscera. Once visualization is complete, click the teeth five times, swallow saliva five times, and softly intone the prayer:

> The Five Stars array their radiance, illuminating the five directions.
> The Water Star averts calamity; the virtue of Wood brings prosperity.
> Mars dispels misfortune; Venus repels warfare.
> Saturn stabilizes the four quarters, benefiting household and state.
> Names inscribed on jade tablets, recorded in the celestial chambers,
> Riding the whirlwind, scattering light, soaring through the Great Void,
> Emerging and vanishing into the unseen, roaming and feasting in the ten directions.
> Five-colored clouds cover and shield, summoning the staff and seizing the wind.
> Should the myriad spirits be commanded, one ascends as an immortal lord.

When finished, align the heart toward the *gang* and visualize while reciting at the moment of ascent and descent. Hold the breath while ascending the *gang*; first invoke the names of the Five Stars and their consorts, then step over the *gang* and tread upon the stars.

First, lift both feet onto Venus, from Venus ascend to Saturn, from Saturn ascend to Mars, from Mars ascend to Jupiter, from Jupiter ascend to Mercury, and from Mercury return to tread upon Venus. After three cycles, hold the breath again to ascend the *gang*, following the old method for fifteen cycles. Each time you reach a star, invoke the name of its Star Lord and consort, press the left hand to the heart, and pray: "Flying immortal."

The scripture states: When performing the ritual, always face north while holding the concealed text, for beginners of the true and wondrous have not yet ventured into subtleties, do not comprehend the orientation of stellar positions, nor recognize the directional shifts of the Mysterious Dipper. Thus, they must face north while holding the text to gradually seek understanding. Once the meaning of the text is grasped and the seasonal movements of the stars are recognized, one should follow the Dipper’s pointer and visualize the steps accordingly. In this way, there is no fixed direction, and one need not always face north. Facing north is merely for beginners. This principle can be extended by analogy; there is no need for further inquiry.

The Dao of the Supreme Perfected’s steps among the Five Stars governs the descent of the Five Stars into their chambers. Hold the breath while ascending the *gang*; first invoke the names of the Five Stars and their consorts, then step over the *gang* and tread upon the stars. This means that when first ascending the *gang*, one should firmly and resolutely proceed, invoke the names, and then step over the *gang* to tread upon the stars. Each time you reach a star, it is even better to focus the mind and invoke the name of the star’s position anew. If the repetition becomes burdensome, one may follow the old method. In ancient times, Yu Shegong, Beilian Zisheng, and the Old Man of Changling all ascended to heaven by this method, without shirking its complexity. This is like a merchant awaiting profit—how could they fear the rapids? Their goal is merely wealth. If seekers of the Dao were as single-minded as merchants, what could prevent them from attaining immortality? Yet, beginners often claim diligence but soon grow lax. They resemble a cart about to break apart, its hundred joints loosening, or an ox burdened with weight, its hooves faltering on a long journey. Such are the concerns of learners, and the amusement of those who have attained the Dao. If one can refine the inner mirror of the heart, this will resonate with the divine, and spiritual beings may dispel your ignorance, carrying you in the chariot of stellar radiance.

The Five Stars’ diagram is typically oriented toward the south, with Venus in the west and Jupiter in the east, arranged accordingly. The reason for this is that the Five Stars’ movements are hidden and unpredictable, unlike the Northern Dipper, which maintains a fixed position. Thus, their positions are determined by the five directions, not by the stars’ actual locations.

The Three Eights form twenty-four spirits; one may recite them in sequence or visualize all three Eights at once. Alternatively, one may visualize the Upper Radiance at dawn, the Middle Radiance at noon, and the Lower Radiance at midnight—this depends on the practitioner’s intention. If one retreats to a secluded mountain, free from worldly affairs, and inwardly focuses on the spirit’s gate, absorbing the true morning *qi*, then at dawn one may visualize all three Eights at once, and in each of the three periods, further visualize one Radiance—this is even better. However, worldly affairs often interfere, making this practice difficult to sustain. Yet, one should not diminish one’s efforts due to such challenges.

Of old, the Perfected Lords of Western Citadel and Paulownia Peak both followed this Dao. According to the *Precious Jade Register of the White Simplicity and Azure Scripture*: "One who does not visualize the twenty-four spirits nor knows the names of the Three Eights cannot be counted among the People of Great Peace, nor can they serve as ministers to the Later Sage."

The method for ascending to the Wood Star: constantly contemplate the sight of Jupiter. One should face the star with a rectified mind, place the right hand over the heart, and bow in reverence. Then, cover both eyes with the left hand, perform nine breath-holds, knock the teeth twenty-seven times, and swallow saliva nine times. With eyes closed, mentally invoke the Perfected Sovereign of Jupiter’s Central Palace and the Sovereign’s Lady, reciting their names and sobriquets thrice, and say: "May I, together with the True Lord of Primordial Yang and the Azure Sovereign, and the Sovereign’s Lady, ascend in the Eightfold Azure Chariot of Effulgent Scenery to the Palace of the Most High." Upon completion, with eyes still covered by the hand, face the star and recite the incantation:

"Celestial radiance intermingles in harmony,
Essence flows to the Eastern Direction.
I gaze upward toward the Nine Gates,
Where flying auroras scatter their brilliance.
Within the Azure Terrace of Primordial Yang,
Resides the Azure Sovereign.
Azure fangs cast their glow,
Illuminating the Nine Quarters.
The resplendent Lady,
Sobriquet ‘Flying Cloud,’
Dons sacred brocade,
Dragon mantle and tiger-skirt,
Girded with phoenix talismans,
Adorned with a floral crown.
Emerging from the formless, entering the void,
They roam the Great Non-Being.
Preceded by the Azure Thearch,
Followed by a thousand spirits,
They come to welcome and receive,
That I may become a Flying Perfected,
Ascending to the Jade Clarity,
The Lofty Chambers of the Highest."

After the incantation, remove the hand and no longer cover the eyes. Gaze at the star and absorb its light twenty-seven times, visualizing the nine rays entering the throat. When all is complete, knock the teeth three times to conclude.

The method for ascending to the Fire Star: contemplate the sight of Mars. One should face the star with a rectified mind, place the left hand over the heart, and bow in reverence. Then, cover the mouth with the right hand, perform three breath-holds, knock the teeth twenty-seven times, and swallow saliva nine times. With eyes closed, mentally invoke the Perfected Sovereign of Mars’ Central Palace and the Sovereign’s Lady, reciting their names and sobriquets thrice, and say: "May I, together with the Cinnabar Fire and Vermilion Sovereign and the Sovereign’s Lady, ascend in the Eightfold Cinnabar Chariot of Effulgent Scenery to the Palace of Jade Clarity." Upon completion, face the star and softly recite the incantation:

"Mysterious constellations flow and reflect,
Crimson light illumines the Southern Darkness.
I gaze upward toward the Three Gates,
Where vermilion clouds form a crimson city.
Within resides the Cinnabar Sovereign,
Named ‘Abiding Stillness.’
The Lady’s inner illumination,
Is called ‘Flowering Vase.’
Together they don cloud-frost,
Phoenix blossoms and dragon bells,
Girded with tiger-script talismans,
Adorned with flying azure headscarves.
Emerging from the formless, entering the profound,
They soar and roam the Five Cities.
Preceded by the Vermilion Thearch,
Followed by the Six Dings,
They come to summon and receive,
That I may attain the name of Perfected,
Ascending to the Mysterious Void,
Inscribed in gold upon Jade Clarity."

After the incantation, remove the hand and no longer cover the mouth. Gaze at the star and absorb its light twenty-seven times, visualizing the three rays entering the throat. When all is complete, knock the teeth three times to conclude.

The method for ascending to the Metal Star: contemplate the sight of Venus. One should face the star with a rectified mind, place the right hand over the heart, and bow in reverence. Then, cover both nostrils with the left hand, perform seven breath-holds, knock the teeth twenty-seven times, and swallow saliva nine times. With eyes closed, mentally invoke the Perfected Sovereign of Venus’ Central Palace and the Sovereign’s Lady, reciting their names and sobriquets thrice, and say: "May I, together with the Lord of Grand Simplicity and Lesser Yang and the Sovereign’s Lady, ascend in the Eightfold Pristine Brush of Effulgent Scenery to the Palace of Jade Clarity." Upon completion, face the star and softly recite the incantation:

"Seven *qi* soar resplendently,
Radiance illumines the Western Direction.
I gaze upward toward the Seven Gates,
Where numinous towers gleam with brilliance.
Pristine splendor shines forth,
Virtue marks the lineage of Metal.
Within resides the Lord of Lesser Yang,
Named ‘White Sovereign.’
The Lady’s numinous grace,
Governs the Jade Chamber.
Together they don gleaming brocade,
Tinkling bells and tiger talismans,
Adorned with a dawn-supporting crown,
Girded with golden pendants.
Emerging from the manifest, entering the void,
They wander the Jade Pole Star.
Preceded by the White Thearch,
Followed by the Six Gengs,
They descend to welcome and receive,
Ascending to the Rampart Palace.
Inscribed in gold upon the Upper Clarity,
One attains the title of Perfected Duke."

After the incantation, remove the hand and no longer cover the nostrils. Gaze at the star and absorb its light twenty-seven times as prescribed.

The method for ascending to the Water Star: contemplate the sight of Mercury. One should face the star with a rectified mind, place both hands over the heart, and bow in reverence. Then, raise both hands to cover the ears, perform five breath-holds, knock the teeth twenty-seven times, and swallow saliva nine times. With eyes closed, mentally invoke the Perfected Sovereign of Mercury’s Central Palace and the Sovereign’s Lady, reciting their names and sobriquets thrice, and say: "May I, together with the Sovereign of Mercury and the Sovereign’s Lady, ascend in the Eightfold Azure Chariot of Effulgent Scenery to the Upper Palace of the Upper Clarity." Upon completion, face the star and softly recite the incantation:

"Five *qi* soar mysteriously,
Radiance flows to the Northern Direction.
I gaze upward toward the Five Gates,
Where azure towers stand lush and dense.
Brilliant rays reach the vista,
Numinous reflections upon auroras.
Within resides the Dark Sovereign,
Sobriquet ‘Essence of the Source.’
Dragon maidens swirl in splendor,
Together governing the Mysterious Pass.
Together they don azure robes,
Purple brocade and flying skirts,
Girded with tiger talismans,
Adorned with lotus crowns.
Emerging to traverse the Nine Voids,
Entering toward the Jade Ford.
Preceded by the Dark Thearch,
Followed by the Six Rens,
They descend to welcome and receive,
Ascending to the Purple Chamber.
Inscribed upon the Most High,
One attains the title of Jade Perfected."

After the incantation, remove the hands and no longer cover the ears. Proceed as prescribed.

The method for ascending to the Earth Star: contemplate the sight of Saturn. One should face the star with a rectified mind, place both hands over the heart, and bow in reverence. Then, cover the upper chamber of the Grotto Palace with the left hand, perform four breath-holds, knock the teeth twenty-seven times, and swallow saliva nine times. With eyes closed, mentally invoke the Perfected Lord of Saturn and the Sovereign’s Lady, reciting their names and sobriquets thrice, and say: "May I, together with the Grand Dao Lord of the Central Palace and the Sovereign’s Lady, ascend in the Eightfold Yellow Chariot of Effulgent Scenery to the Palace of the Upper Clarity." Upon completion, face the star and softly recite the incantation:

"Four *qi* linger and converge,
Concentrating upon the Central Origin.
I gaze upward toward the Nine Poles,
Surveying the Four Gates on all sides.
The Yellow Terrace and Purple Chamber,
Scatter their rays and brilliance.
Numinous light swirls in splendor,
Celestial blossoms fall upon the portico.
Within resides the Yellow Sovereign,
Sobriquet ‘Profound Prolongation.’
The Lady’s hidden virtue,
Is called ‘Non-Excellence.’
Governing harmony and life-*qi*,
Guiding the mysterious and irrigating the origin.
Together they don yellow clouds,
Dragon mantles and brocade skirts,
Girded with golden talismans,
Adorned with purple crowns.
Emerging to traverse the Mysterious Void,
Unfurling light at the Golden Gate.
Preceded by the Yellow Thearch,
Followed by the Six Jis in chariots,
They descend to draw near and welcome,
Ascending to the Celestial Pass.
Inscribed in gold upon the Most High,
Jade tablets carve the name.
Soaring through the Great Emptiness,
One attains the title of Jade Minister."

When the incantation is complete, withdraw your hands and do not again cover the chamber of the Grotto, proceeding as in the method above.

**Mingtang Internal Scripture: Heart-Opening and Forgetfulness-Dispelling Talisman**
On the appointed day at dawn, face the royal direction and write in vermilion. Bow twice and ingest it, reciting:
"Five spirits open the heart,
Piercing hearing to sever sound.
Three *hun* gather essence,
All guard the cinnabar heart.
Let me not forget—
Five viscera seek afar."

After bowing twice and completing the incantation, ingest it. Upon finishing, swallow saliva five times and click the teeth five times. Let no one witness this.

If not using the appointed day, perform on the first, fifteenth, or twenty-seventh day of the month—three times monthly. Within a year, efficacy will manifest. This is a secret talisman.

**Oral Instructions of the Perfected of Great Emptiness:**
On the *yi-mao* day of spring, *bing-wu* day of summer, *geng-shen* day of autumn, or *ren-zi* day of winter, at the hour beyond dusk, first grind cinnabar and realgar in equal measure until fine. Wrap them in silk to the size of a jujube, and at the appointed hour, plug both ears with them.

This is the Dao of dissolving the Three Corpses and refining the Seven *po*—a secret method. Let no one know of it.

The next day at noon, bathe in east-flowing water. After bathing, arrange the bedding anew, change into fresh garments, wash the old ones, and replace worn sandals. Sweep and sprinkle water beneath the sleeping couch, ensuring the entire chamber is immaculate.

Then, lie down with the head raised, close the breath, and clench the fists for a long while. Softly recite:
"The Dao of Heaven is constant,
Renewing the old to make it new.
On this auspicious day of the Thearch,
Bathing makes one true.
Three *qi* dissolve the corpse,
Cinnabar and realgar pacify the *hun*.
Precious refinement of the Seven *po*
Draws them near to me."

This is the supreme method for dissolving corpse impurities and renewing the form—a crucial secret. Perform it once in each of the four seasons.

The Perfected of Great Emptiness said: My former master taught that on the five *da* days, when the sun has risen three or four *zhang*, stand upright and face it with the heart aligned. Visualize the three *hun* spirits entering the heart together with the sunlight. After a long while, hold the breath for three cycles, swallow saliva three times, and softly recite:
"Radiance of the Great Yang scatters,
Shedding purple and azure light.
Enter my *hun*,
Illumine my five forms.
Repel spectral trials of the heart,
Make the heart balanced and upright.
Within, penetrate the Nine *qi*;
Without, connect to the embryo’s destiny.
Ascend as a flying immortal to the Upper Clarity,
The Jade Register now fixed."

Afterward, wipe the eyes fourteen times and click the teeth fourteen times. When complete,
This method makes the three *hun* congeal in clarity, the cinnabar heart square and upright. All demonic arts and heart trials will cease—a true essential Dao. Practice it regularly.

On each of the five *da* days, face the sun and induce a sneeze. If no sneeze comes, use a soft object to gently stimulate the nose toward the sun, and a sneeze will follow. After sneezing, recite:
"Heavenly light advances,
Six embryos ascend and connect.
Three *hun* guard the spirit,
Seven *po* do not perish.
Receiving the sun’s sneeze,
I share its divine power.
Fly as an immortal to the Upper Clarity,
Attain the rank of Perfected Duke."

After reciting, wipe the eyes fourteen times. This causes inner essence to rise and merge with the sunlight, the three *hun* to shine within, opening the heart’s spirit, dissolving the hundred essences, and circulating them through the inner palace. If not on a *da* day, this need not be done.

On the five *da* days, face north and bow five times. Silently invoke the names of the Supreme Perfected Sovereign Lord and the Lady of the Dao three times. After clicking the teeth five times, remove your headscarf, kneel long, and reverently declare:
"Before the august presence of the Five Stars, Sun, Moon, Supreme Perfected, Highest Realized Lords, and the Lady of the Dao; before the Jade Clarity, Supreme Clarity, Supreme Thearch, and the Great Dao Sage Lord of the Most High—
I confess the myriad sins and transgressions of my seven generations of ancestors, parents, and myself since past lives. I beseech deliverance, that the Three Offices may issue decrees to all bureaus, releasing my guilt, erasing my name from the black registers. I pray to join the Perfected of the Five Stars, together ascending the radiant celestial array, entering the Jade Gate, ascending to the Upper Clarity, the chambers of the Highest, the halls of the Mysterious Void. Inscribed in gold as a Jade Clarity immortal, my name recorded in the Upper Clarity, I shall attain the rank of Perfected Duke. My name inscribed in the Most High, I shall become a Jade Perfected. Soaring through the Great Emptiness, I shall be a Jade Minister."

For Jupiter: cover the left eye with the left hand, and place the right hand over the heart.
For Mars: place the left hand over the heart, and cover the mouth with the right hand.

For Venus: place the right hand over the heart, and cover the nose with the left hand.
For Mercury: after placing both hands over the heart, cover both ears.
For Saturn: place both hands over the heart, and cover the upper chamber with the left hand.

Record the matters of the Eight Essentials:
At midday on the sixth day of the first month; at the *bu* hour on the first day of the second month;
At midnight on the seventh day of the third month; at the *shi* hour on the ninth day of the fourth month;
At midnight on the fifteenth day of the fifth month; at midday on the third day of the sixth month;
At midnight on the seventh day of the seventh month; at the *shen* hour on the fourth day of the eighth month;
At dawn on the second day of the ninth month; at dawn on the first day of the tenth month;
At midnight on the sixth day of the eleventh month; at midnight on the twelfth day of the twelfth month.

Record the Five Auspicious Days of the Dao.

Thus concludes the *Scripture of the Most High on Pacing the Five Stars*.
