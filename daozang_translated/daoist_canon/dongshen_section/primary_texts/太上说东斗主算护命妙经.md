The Most High Lord Lao addressed the Orthodox Unity Celestial Master, saying: The Dao of Heaven operates in profound motion, its patterns and responses mysterious and silent. The constant constellations, both inner and outer, each preside over their offices—altogether one hundred eighteen names, comprising seven hundred eighty-two stars. The twenty-eight lunar lodges, the two luminaries, and the five planets all reside within the celestial pivot, aligning the seven regulators. The five heavens bear great titles, and the Divine Dipper Emperor-Lords establish the markers of the north and south, balancing the east and west. Their radiance reaches the center, illuminating the four directions. I now reveal to you the arcane texts and cavernous chapters. When mortals recite them, calamities transform into blessings; those of attainment who receive them gain the numinous radiance of the profound.

I have already expounded for you the oral instructions of the Northern Dipper’s governance of destiny and the writings of the Southern Dipper’s Six Offices, delivering boundless beings and enduring through kalpas without end. Now, I further reveal to you the *Jade Numinosity and Jade Chapters* of the Eastern Dipper Emperor-Lords, who govern destiny and extend years. Let this be transmitted to the world below, for it can deliver beings from the three paths, the five sufferings, and the eight difficulties. It can erase death and raise the dead, its great command overseeing forms and souls. Profound, wondrous, and silent, it is without limit or end.

Lord Lao said: The gods of the east dwell beside the Dipper. The Great Sage of Longevity, Lord Han the Elder, grasps my handle; the Deathless Spirit assists at my left; the Lord of Longevity aids at my right; the Great Spirit Sima executes my governance. The Offices of Destiny and Records extend life and increase destiny’s span, delivering boundless beings. The Azure Emperor guards my soul, the Most High supports my body. Bayuan Choubo, the Perfected of the Demon Kings, follow my will to extend salvation to heavenly beings. Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!

**Incantation:**
The Great Dao shines brightly,
Serene and profoundly obscure.
The five Dippers revolve at the center,
The four seasons give birth and completion.
The Northern Capital’s myriad ghosts
Impede the years of mortals.
I possess cavernous chapters
To deliver the world and attain long life.
Honor and revere them,
And the master’s spirit will flourish.
Within the profound lies the profound,
The towering Jade Capital.
Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!

**The Five Eastern Dipper Perfected Lords:**
1. The First Eastern Dipper: Perfected Lord Cangling, Extender of Life
2. The Second Eastern Dipper: Perfected Lord Lingguang, Protector of Life
3. The Third Eastern Dipper: Perfected Lord Guantian, Great Guardian and Assembler of Blessings
4. The Fourth Eastern Dipper: Perfected Lord Daming, Harmonizer of Yang and Preserver of Peace
5. The Fifth Eastern Dipper: Perfected Lord Weiji, Supreme Overseer

Lord Lao said: All who recite this must do so with utmost sincerity, purifying their hearts. Face east, click your teeth, bow in reverence, kneel, and sit. Close your eyes and visualize the spirits, as if beholding the boundless realm of the east, where the Numinous Emperor-Lords, the Most Perfected Great Sages, and their innumerable hosts array themselves in a vast encirclement. If you are deemed worthy of their oversight and deliverance, on days of impending disaster, perform the rites on your destiny day, your birthday, the new and full moons, or the ninth day of the month. Within your home, temple, or abode, offer seasonal flowers and rare fruits, burn incense, and recite in stillness. Gaze toward the Eastern Dipper Emperor-Lords, present offerings to repent of transgressions, and pray for the increase of your years. The great numina will bestow boundless blessings; those of attainment who receive this transmission will roam freely in the Highest Clarity.

This scripture is profoundly arcane and cannot be fully expounded. When the Most High finished expounding the scripture, he addressed the Celestial Master from his Jade Bureau Seat, saying: These arcane texts and secret methods, if transmitted to the unworthy, will bring calamity upon nine generations. Therefore, I bestow them upon you to propagate the Orthodox Dao, to deliver and save heavenly beings, and to grant them long life.

The Celestial Master bowed twice, prostrated himself, and received the teachings, vowing to practice them in accordance with the method. From then on, they were transmitted throughout the world.
