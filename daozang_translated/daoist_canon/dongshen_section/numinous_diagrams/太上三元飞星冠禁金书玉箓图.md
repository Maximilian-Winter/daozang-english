*The Supreme Three Primordials Flying Star Coronation Prohibition Gold Writ Jade Register Diagram*

On Crane Call Mountain, the Supreme Lord Lao bestowed the Gold Writ and Jade Register upon Celestial Master Zhang Daoling. Daoling bowed deeply, knelt, and addressed him: "Your servant is base and lowly, a withered remnant of mortal life. Yet I have been specially favored by the Supreme One with the essential methods of the perfected. I see that demonic and vulgar forces intermingle, and now the great demons of the world defy prohibitions and precepts, moving with the baleful qi of tigers, wolves, and the Five Epidemics to harm mankind. The multitudes suffer hardship in their livelihoods. By good fortune, I have encountered the Sagely Venerable One—may you deign to show compassion."

The Supreme One addressed Daoling: "The human heart is the master of the myriad transformations. If one can preserve its spirit, the spirit will abide in the human heart as the master of the myriad transformations. If one can know its spirit, the spirit will guard the person. If you do not know its spirit, the spirit will depart from you. If you can preserve its words, the spirit will return to you. For this reason, the Three Palaces wail in sorrow, and the Five Spirits leave the body. This is how demons arise from within, and ghosts come from without. Ghosts and demons grow ever more exultant, while the spirit transforms into a thief. Your living name is cast into the left tally, and your death is recorded in the right palace. Weapons and illness come to harm you—how can you prolong your distant years? This is why I constantly pity you. Now you ask me, and I know your aspiration. I shall teach you the Way of the Three and Five, the Covenant of Might, and the Orthodox Unity. Receive it with sincerity and faith; do not show it to the unworthy. You may attain long life, repel the myriad calamities, remain unstained by the Three Disasters, and be unassailed by the Nine Adversities. Even the disasters of water and fire will not draw near.

[Missing characters] at the left shoulder, [missing] at the right elbow, [missing] at the right arm, [missing] at the left thigh, [missing] above the abdomen, [missing] above the heart, [missing] at the left breast.

When observed thus, the Five Dipper is complete.

The Yin Contemplation Incantation states:
The Four Spirits clash,
The Five Dipper comes to aid.
A thousand disasters scatter and vanish,
Ten thousand afflictions dissolve of themselves.
As I now act,
I turn my back on solitude and strike at emptiness.
What petty ghost
Dares approach my dwelling?
Heavenly Soldiers and Mightly Warriors,
Move and they shall be utterly destroyed.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance.

Coronate thus seven times, and the stars will coil around your form. The myriad ghosts will be subdued and crushed, and the hundred spirits will guard and protect you. Your name will be inscribed in the Jade Register, your years extended, your lifespan lengthened, your bones transformed into true gold, and you will ascend to the celestial clouds. With prolonged cultivation, there will be no lack of verification. Do not show this to the unworthy—be cautious, be cautious.

This method of coronating the stars is the highest teaching. Hold fast to its profound and wondrous essentials and practice them. What Way will not be accomplished? What ghost will not be subdued? None will fail to revere and submit—this is the secret text of the immortals. If a perfected one obtains it, do not transmit it recklessly. This is the dynamic of the stars and the moon, driving spirits and commanding ghosts, its efficacy unfathomable. If transmitted recklessly to the unworthy, calamity will befall oneself and extend to the seven generations of ancestors. Practice diligently, and you will soon attain the Dao of immortality.

For all who wish to cultivate immortality and study the Dao, on the first day of the first lunar month, stand in a pure and clean place, face north, and bow four times to the Primordial Sovereign. The Primordial Sovereign is the one who opened heaven at the beginning. Another name is the Sagely Mother—without paying homage to the Sagely Mother, the study of the Dao will not succeed.

You should declare:
"Your servant is a person of the lowest realm, born of the womb, base and vulgar, mingled with filth and stench, defiled by the clamor of dust, a remnant breath in a rotting husk, a life of blood and foulness. Yet I have been bathed in the mysterious shade and have returned to this remnant life. By good fortune, through generations of revering the true, blessings have been left to later descendants. How dare I, with my foul and filthy self, unafraid of heavenly might, delight in the Dao and rejoice in immortality, offering utmost sincerity to the profound and mysterious?"

Prostrate, I beseech the divine radiance to secretly illuminate me, that I may transcend the gate of deathlessness. May the Most Sagely bestow grace, grant me protection, ward off calamities, and harmonize with the Dao in perfect accord.

Next, tap the teeth three times and inwardly visualize the Five Stars.
First, envision Jupiter in the left hand, its hue like a blue jewel.
Next, envision Venus in the right hand, its hue like a white jewel.
Then, envision Mars above the crown, its hue like a fiery pearl.
Next, envision Saturn within the heart, its hue like yellow gold.
Finally, envision Mercury beneath the feet, its hue like black jade.
Let their divine radiance thoroughly illuminate the entire body.

Inwardly recite the incantation:
*"The Five Stars guard my form,
their light illumines the mysterious darkness.
A thousand spirits and ten thousand sages
shield my true spirit.
Fierce beasts of heaven,
subdue the five weapons.
Demons of the five heavens,
perish in body and vanish in form.
Wherever I dwell,
all spirits shall attend me."*
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law.

Once the Five Dippers are crowned, then visualize the Five Stars transforming upon my body.
Envision Jupiter in the left hand, transmuting into a wind wheel.
Mars above the crown, transforming into fierce fire encircling the body.
Saturn before the heart, changing into golden chainmail wrapped around the body.
Venus in the right hand, becoming a vajra divine sword, its blade and edge ablaze with flame.
Mercury beneath the feet, suddenly shifting into a river that in an instant becomes a sea, from which five dragons emerge.

After visualizing the spirits, inwardly recite the incantation:
*"The Five Stars guard my form,
their light illumines the fire spirit.
Preserve my five limbs,
guard my ten thousand spirits.
Demons of the six heavens,
move and be slain in form."*
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law.

Next, envision the Great Killing Star of the Celestial Stem, its qi descending from the stem—internally yellow, externally black—until it reaches before me. With the nose, inhale it for twelve breaths, then inwardly recite the incantation:
*"True qi of the Great Killing,
internally yin, externally yang.
Preserve my body and life,
dispel evil and avert misfortune.
Mountain spirits and goblins,
earth gods and strong demons □.
Crimson mouths and white tongues,
insects, snakes, tigers, and wolves.
Those who harm me shall die,
those who plot against me shall perish.
Those who cherish me shall prosper,
those who serve me shall flourish.
Ten thousand spirits shattered,
subdued beneath Heaven’s firmament."*
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law.

Place the left hand upon the heart and the right hand upon the crown.
Inwardly envision □ star in the right hand, □ star in the left hand, □ star before the chest.
Then inwardly recite the incantation:
*"The Great Killing Star of the Celestial Stem
guards the origin of my heart.
Externally repels the five weapons,
internally dispels the five pestilences.
Those who oppose me shall be deluded,
those who scheme against me shall meet misfortune.
Rebellious ghosts and wicked men,
what can they do to me?"*
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law.

Place the left hand upon the heart and the right hand pointing heavenward in concealment.
Envision the Celestial Stem Star in the right hand, □ star in the left hand, □ star above the head.
Recite the incantation:
*"True qi of Yang Brightness
crowns my vermilion yang.
Dispels ten thousand harms,
drives back rebellious □.
Thieves and wicked men,
insects, snakes, tigers, and wolves.
Those who plot against me shall die,
those who harm me shall perish.
Crimson mouths and white tongues,
subdued beneath the Celestial Stem."*
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law.

Turn the right hand to point backward toward the heart, the left hand pointing to the heart.
Inwardly envision the Celestial Stem Star in the right hand, □ above the head, □ star in the left hand.
Then inwardly recite the incantation:
*"Luminous and upright qi,
dwells in the Celestial Stem.
Guards the Crimson Palace,
dispels misfortune and calamity.
What spirit dares remain?
What ghost dares approach?
A thousand sages and ten thousand ghosts
submit to my Celestial Stem."*
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law.

With both hands, trace the Three Terraces as a canopy.
Inwardly envision the Upper Terrace Star Officer, Void Essence, in my left hand.
Next, envision the Middle Terrace Star Officer, Sixfold Purity, and the Lower Terrace Star Officer, Crooked Life, beneath the right hand and both knees.
My head wears the canopy, my feet tread the Celestial Stem.
The earth’s net spans the eight directions,
the heaven’s net stretches in four directions.
The Northern Dipper brings death—
dispels calamity and eradicates misfortune.
The Southern Dipper bestows life—
prolongs lifespan and extends years.
All wishes are fulfilled,
wherever I dwell brings prosperity.
Internal and external strong □,
move and be utterly destroyed.*
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law.

After crowning all the stars, each night before sleeping, inwardly recite this incantation. First, before the bed, perform the Void Yu Step or the Nine-Trace Step.
At the moment of retiring, before the grove, inwardly recite the incantation:
*"Step backward from the bed,
dispel evil and eradicate misfortune.
Heavenly Emperor’s prison wardens,
forbid ghosts from wandering at night.
For grave offenses, waist severance;
for minor offenses, preservation of life.
Neither grave nor minor,
sever the ghost’s two arms.
Moon to the right, sun to the left,
each two inches and five fen from my brow.
The Northern Dipper’s seven stars
encircle the chamber."*
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law.

The Lord Lao addressed Dao Ling, saying: "In conducting great affairs, you must cultivate the method of worshipping the stars. If you do not know this method, the celestial spirits will not protect you. Malevolent demons will come to harm you, and wicked people will plot against you. Heaven-sent pestilential qi will arise, and weapons and warfare will erupt in due time. Through these, you may fall ill and even meet your end. You should diligently refine this most wondrous method. Be steadfast in this, and do not transmit it to those who accumulate evil. To carelessly divulge the true scripture will bring calamity upon yourself, extending even to your seven generations of ancestors. Be cautious, be ever cautious."

The Lord Lao said: "This is the method of the host of immortals. If you can practice it, you shall attain longevity and enduring vision in the world. Those who cannot achieve longevity do so because heavenly demons have bound them with sin. If you refine my method, you will surely be free from all disasters and misfortunes, your lifespan will be prolonged, and blessings will flow endlessly to your descendants. If you reveal it to the unworthy, calamity will befall your seven generations, and your own body will fill the Yellow River."

Upon concluding, Dao Ling respectfully received the teachings and admonitions, bowing his head in reverence to put them into practice.

**The Nine-Palace Dipper Formula**

The Dipper’s essence is wondrous, the twelve spirits.
Riding the Celestial Stem, martial might arrays.
Qi drifts and shifts, like floating clouds.
Seven transformations move, ceasing only in accord with Heaven.
Know their changes, and the auspicious and inauspicious will be clear to your right.
Step through the Dipper’s lodges, before the Celestial Pass.
Enter the Six Pitches, uphold the Four Prohibitions.
Flank Heavenly Flower, tread Heavenly Task.
Embrace Heavenly Pillar, connect with Heavenly Heart.
From here, ascend to Heavenly Bird.
Lean on Heavenly Auxiliary, gaze toward Heavenly Surge.
Enter Heavenly Inner, exit Heavenly Peril.
The Dipper’s Dao flows, hard and soft harmonize.
Heaven bestows wealth and emolument, the clear and cold abyss.
Enter the profound darkness, for a thousand myriad years.
