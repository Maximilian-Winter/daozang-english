**Collected Annotations and Expanded Meanings of the *Illustrated Classic of Materia Medica*, Preface Volume One**

**Sequel to the Preface (Part One)**
**Supplementary Annotations: General Preface**

The traditional account holds that the *Shennong Bencao Jing* (*Divine Farmer’s Classic of Materia Medica*) was composed by Shennong, yet no early records confirm this. The *Han Shu: Yi Wen Zhi* (*Book of Han: Treatise on Arts and Letters*) also makes no mention of it. The *Annals of Emperor Ping* state: "In the fifth year of the Yuanshi era, those throughout the realm well-versed in arts, techniques, and *bencao* were to be conveyed to the capital by post carriage." The *Biography of Lou Hu* notes: "In his youth, Hu recited medical classics, *bencao*, and formulas amounting to several hundred thousand words." Thus, the term *bencao* first appears here. However, the commentary by Duke Ying (Li Shiji) and others cites Ban Gu’s *Huangdi Nei Wai Jing* (*Yellow Emperor’s Inner and Outer Classics*), which states: "The *bencao* records the cold and warmth of stones to gauge the depth of illnesses." This pertains to the discourse on classical formulas, not the *bencao* itself. Only the *Qi Lu* (*Seven Records*) of the Liang Dynasty lists the *Shennong Bencao* in three volumes, mistakenly regarding it as the earliest work.

Some speculate that the regions of production listed in the text include Later Han place names, suggesting authorship by figures like Zhang Zhongjing or Hua Tuo. This, too, is unfounded. The *Huainanzi* states: "Shennong tasted the flavors of a hundred herbs, encountering seventy poisons in a single day, whence medical formulas arose." In high antiquity, before the advent of writing, knowledge was transmitted orally from master to disciple, giving rise to the term *bencao*. From the Han Dynasty onward, renowned physicians proliferated. Zhang Ji, Hua Tuo, and others built upon ancient learning, appending new theories to compile comprehensive works, and the *bencao* thus appeared in bibliographic records.

The original classic comprised only three volumes, covering 365 medicinal substances. During the Liang Dynasty, Tao Hongjing expanded it with the *Ming Yi Bie Lu* (*Supplementary Records of Famous Physicians*), also listing 365 substances, and provided annotations, dividing the text into seven volumes. In the Xianqing era of the Tang Dynasty, Su Gong, Chief of the Gate Guards, petitioned to correct its errors. The throne then commanded Duke Li Shiji of Ying and others to review the text alongside Su Gong, adding 114 substances and reorganizing it into twenty volumes by category. This became known as the *Tang Bencao* (*Tang Materia Medica*).

During the Kaibao era of our dynasty, two imperial edicts were issued to the physician Liu Han and the Daoist Ma Zhi, who collaborated to compile the text, appending 133 effective remedies commonly used by physicians. The Hanlin Academicians Lu Duoxun, Li Fang, Wang You, and Hu Meng were then ordered to revise it, resulting in the *Xiang Ding* (*Detailed Revision*) and *Chong Ding* (*Revised Edition*), which were carved onto printing blocks and disseminated. Thereafter, physicians could prescribe medicines with clarity.

The Later Shu ruler Meng Shu also commanded his academician Han Baosheng to compare and expand the *Tang Ben Cao Tu Jing* (*Illustrated Tang Materia Medica*), producing a work known as the *Shu Bencao* (*Shu Materia Medica*), which also circulates today.

From the Han Dynasty to the present, barely a millennium has passed. During this time, three major editions have been compiled, with over six hundred additional medicinal substances recorded. The scope of collection has broadened, and the work may be deemed comprehensive. Yet physicians still find that, after prolonged circulation, later research has introduced many revisions. Contemporary practices reveal omissions, necessitating further compilation to serve the needs of nurturing life and dispelling illness.

In the eighth month of the second year of the Jiayou era, we, your subjects Yu Xi, Yi, Song, and Run, were ordered to undertake another collation. Having received this mandate, we have further examined the text. We observe that physicians of past generations, when diagnosing and prescribing, recorded remedies upon observing their effects, leading to gradual expansion. The vast array of works on the subject is difficult to exhaust. Though multiple revisions have been made, the criteria for inclusion and exclusion remain inconsistent.

Some entries in the *Divine Farmer’s Classic of Materia Medica* (*Shennong Bencao Jing*) are recorded yet described too briefly; others, though commonly used by folk practitioners, remain unknown to imperial physicians. Had we not documented these in detail, much would have been lost. We therefore petitioned to supplement and annotate the text based on its existing structure. All properties and functions of medicinal substances recorded in various medical works and pharmacopoeias have been gathered; only those with names overly obscure or resembling fantastical claims have been excluded. Beyond medical texts, even from classics, histories, and miscellaneous works—though not directly urgent for prescriptions—where relevant discussions or verifiable pharmacological evidence exist, these too have been included to ensure comprehensiveness and fulfill the imperial mandate.

Numerous works bear the title *Materia Medica*, but we have taken the *Revised Kaibao Edition* as the authoritative version. Its arrangement of volumes, interspersed annotations, and use of red and black ink follow the original format without alteration. All supplementary notes are based on accounts from other texts. Where their meanings overlap with existing entries, redundancies have been excised to avoid repetition; where earlier entries are incomplete and later texts expand upon them, both are retained for clarity. Each annotation begins in red ink with “Your subjects respectfully note, according to [source]...,” while separate entries conclude with “See [source].” Cited works are ordered with the Tang and Shu *Materia Medica* given precedence, followed by others in chronological sequence. Works originally titled *Materia Medica* are cited only by their authors’ names, except for the Tang and Shu editions, which are labeled “Tang edition” and “Shu edition,” respectively.

Red ink denotes entries from the *Divine Farmer’s Classic of Materia Medica*. Where later physicians expanded upon its original entries, these additions appear in black ink interspersed with the red. All other additions form separate entries, also in black. Contributions by Tao Hongjing are titled *Records of Famous Physicians* (*Mingyi Bielu*) and appended to the relevant entries. Additions from the Xianqing era are noted at the end as “First appended in the Tang edition.” Those from the Kaibao era are marked “Appended here.” Newly supplemented entries absent from the original text are listed after each entry as “Newly supplemented.” Medicinal substances were formerly classified into three grades (superior, middle, and inferior); newly added entries, however, are difficult to categorize precisely and are thus grouped by type—for example, green vitriol follows alum, *Alpinia japonica* flowers follow *Allium fistulosum*, and *Ficus foveolata* follows *Salix purpurea*.

Where a substance’s properties were unrecorded in the *Classic* but cited in prior annotations, and where new additions resemble existing entries, no separate entry is created; instead, they are appended to the original annotation as “Continued notes,” such as *Terricolous Lichen* under *Wall Moss*, *Yanfu* under *Tetrapanax*, and *Seaweed* under *Sargassum*. Annotations by Tao Hongjing are labeled “Tao Hongjing notes”; those from the Xianqing era, “Tang edition notes”; and those from the Kaibao era, “Present notes.” Kaibao-era citations from historical records are distinguished in red as “Present examination,” “Present discussion,” or “Further examination.” Where the *Classic* records a substance’s name but omits its properties, and later additions provide further details, these are appended to the original annotation.

For substances now in common use but unattested in existing texts—such as *Trigonella foenum-graecum* and *Laminaria japonica*—where no evidence exists for verification, we have consulted imperial physicians and collectively determined their inclusion as separate entries under “Newly established.” The original text contained 983 substances; 82 have been newly supplemented (excluding those appended to annotations), and 17 newly established. The total now stands at 1,082 entries, all roughly classified by category.

Guided by these fifteen principles, the intent of the supplementary annotations becomes clear. The prefaces from the *Kaibao*, *Yingong*, and Tao Hongjing editions—each with its own conventions—cannot be omitted and are thus retained at the beginning.

**Summary of New and Old Medicinal Substances (Total: 1,082)**
- 360 from the *Divine Farmer’s Classic of Materia Medica*
- 182 from the *Records of Famous Physicians*
- 114 first appended in the Tang edition
- 133 appended in the present edition
- 194 with names but unused
- 82 newly supplemented
- 17 newly established

*Preface to the Illustrated Pharmacopoeia*

In ancient times, the Divine Farmer tasted the flavors of a hundred herbs to relieve the suffering of the people, and from this, later generations took him as their founding master, giving rise to the study of materia medica. Since the Han and Wei dynasties, renowned physicians have followed in succession, and those who transmitted their works include Wu Pu and Li Dangzhi’s *Records of Medicinals*, as well as the commentaries of Tao Hongjing and Su Gong. At the beginning of our dynasty, two imperial edicts commissioned court officials to oversee the imperial physicians and compile the doctrines of various schools, resulting in the *Kaibao Revised Pharmacopoeia*. Its discussions of the efficacy and toxicity of medicinals, their warm or cold natures, and their sweet or bitter flavors may be called comprehensive and detailed.

Yet the products of different regions vary in their qi and suitability, and with the multitude of names and categories, counterfeits are difficult to distinguish. Mistaking *huichuang* for *lianwu*, or *jivei* for ginseng—even the ancients found this troubling. How much more so today, when physicians’ medicinals all come from merchants, and merchants’ supplies derive from mountain folk who gather them seasonally, without investigating their origins? To rely on these for treatment and expect to cure illness is surely far from the mark.

During the Yonghui era of the Tang, alongside the revised pharmacopoeia, a *Illustrated Pharmacopoeia* was also compiled to serve as a companion. The illustrations depicted their forms and colors, while the text explained their similarities and differences. Later, the imperial *Tianbao Single-Illustration Materia Medica* was also produced, both works intended to distinguish authentic from spurious substances, making them easily recognizable and providing a basis for diagnosis and prescription. These two books have long been lost, their contents nearly scattered and gone; even the Hongdu Secret Archives holds no copies. Of the *Tianbao* medical texts, only one volume remains, its categories roughly discernible and its origins traceable. It is fitting that sagacious rulers and wise ministers should take an interest in their recovery.

Previously, an edict commanded scholars to collate eight books, including the *Divine Farmer’s Classic of Materia Medica*. Lu Yuxi, Gentleman for Court Audiences and Academician of the Secret Pavilion; Zhang Yi, Gentleman of the Ministry of Rites and Academician of the Secret Pavilion; Su Song, Erudite of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices and Academician of the Jixian Institute; Shen Jian, Gentleman of the Palace; and Lu Baoheng, Gentleman of the Court of Imperial Entertainments, were successively selected for this task. They were also assisted by imperial physicians Qin Zonggu and Zhu Youzhang, and after years of compilation, the *Supplementary Annotations to the Pharmacopoeia* was completed and presented to the throne. An edict then commanded all prefectures and counties to submit illustrations of locally produced medicinals, following the precedent of the Yonghui era, and ordered a new compilation.

Minister Lu Yuxi observed: "To collate and correct many books by drawing on diverse perspectives makes the task easier to accomplish; but when writing and editing are entrusted to different hands, their styles become inconsistent. Today, the illustrations submitted from across the realm number in the thousands. Their explanations of medicinal substances are all based on what contemporary physicians have seen and heard, with varying degrees of detail and much vulgar language. Without a single hand to unify and refine them, the work would lack coherence, making it difficult to consult."

He noted that Minister Su Song had long devoted himself to this work, and thus proposed that he be entrusted with its compilation. Once the imperial decree was received, Minister Su gathered the various accounts, classified and arranged them, and established a rough outline. For the names of jades, stones, metals, and earths, as well as the distinctions among plants, insects, and fish, some substances appeared in multiple prefectures under the same name, while others shared a name but differed entirely in form. For these, he cross-referenced ancient and modern accounts to mutually elucidate them. Regarding the size of stalks and roots, or the flourishing and withering of flowers and fruits—even where these contradicted older accounts—he preserved both versions. Where descriptions were incomplete, he supplemented them with old annotations to complete the meaning. If annotations were still insufficient, he further cited classics, histories, medical texts, and miscellaneous records to trace their origins.

For example, to identify *luying* as *rufan* flower, he relied on the *Erya*; to confirm that various fragrant substances share a common origin, he used the *Lingbiao Luyi*. For the places of origin, he prioritized the *Divine Farmer’s Classic*, followed by contemporary sources. For instance, dodder was said to grow in Chaoxian, but now it comes from Juanju; *xidu* was said to grow on Shaoshi Mountain, but now it comes from the Three Shu regions. Where the seasons of collection differed, he preserved both accounts, as with *chijian*, for which the *Classic* only records harvesting the root, while today both stem and seedling are used.

For medicinals originating in foreign lands, he relied on contemporary hearsay or historical records, as with jade fragments and jade springs. Today, people only know that jade comes from Khotan, without investigating its origins, so he used Ping Juhui’s *Travel Records* as evidence. The three grades of medicinals—superior, middle, and inferior—followed the order of the *Divine Farmer’s Classic*. For substances with similar properties that were not well-known, or came from distant places and lacked clear descriptions, he appended them to related entries, such as *soushu* to *gouqi* and amber to *fuling*.

He also included concise and essential formulas from ancient medical texts that had been proven effective by past physicians and were still in common use, as well as efficacious remedies submitted by contemporary physicians from various prefectures, following the example of the *Tianbao* texts. For substances not recorded in any existing texts and beyond the understanding of modern physicians, he dared not fabricate explanations based on conjecture, so he left them unrecorded. For medicinals used by contemporary physicians but not listed in the old classics, he grouped them by category and placed them in the final volume under "Supplementary Categories." Among these, those with particularly notable effects or close affinities to existing entries were appended to the relevant sections, such as *tongtuo* to *mutong* and *shishe* to *shixie*.

The work comprises twenty scrolls, with one scroll of tables of contents. The compilation has now been completed and is ready for imperial review.

With utmost reverence, we reflect upon Your Majesty, whose boundless benevolence and profound virtue nurture all living things—should even a single creature lose its proper place, Your heart is moved to compassion. Moreover, recognizing that pestilence and epidemics recur with the four seasons, and that no concern is more urgent than safeguarding life through medicine, Your Majesty has from an early age repeatedly commanded close ministers to collate and revise the *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon* of the *Qi* and *Huang*, to redefine the loci of acupuncture and moxibustion, and to cast bronze or inscribe stone, or carve woodblocks for bound editions. Moved by the pernicious deceptions of southern sorcery, You composed the *Qingli Benevolent Remedies for Salvation* and bestowed it upon the people; contemplating the shortages endured by the common folk, You compiled the *Concise and Essential Recipes for Universal Relief* and disseminated it widely. Now, further expanding what was lacking in the pharmacopoeias and mapping the suitability of regional products—where myriad substances differ in form and nature, all may be grasped at a glance—You ensure that those who compound medicines achieve perfect efficacy, and those who consume them harbor no unresolved doubts. The *Three Eminent Classics* include one attributed to Shennong; once the hundred herbs were distinguished, the *Materia Medica* preserved their records. The old classic, in three scrolls, has circulated through the ages.

To extend the blessings of longevity and well-being to the people and to summon harmonious *qi* across heaven and earth is to advance the attainment of Great Peace, to which this work shall contribute. Though my learning is inadequate and my post among the compilers a humble one, I have, in obedience to Your imperial decree, ventured to undertake this task, humbled by my own meager knowledge. Respectfully submitted on a day in the ninth month of the sixth year of the *Jiayou* reign by the Court Gentleman for Favor, Erudite of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, and Academician of the Institute for the Advancement of Literature, newly appointed Prefect of Yingzhou, concurrently responsible for agricultural encouragement, irrigation, and waterway management within the prefecture, Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary, and Purple-robed Gentleman, your servant Su Song.

**Preface to the *Kaibao* Revised Edition**
The *Three Eminent Classics* include one attributed to Shennong; once the mineral drugs were distinguished, the *Materia Medica* preserved their records. The old classic, in three scrolls, has circulated through the ages. The *Supplementary Records of Eminent Physicians* were later interwoven with it. By the Liang dynasty, Master Tao Hongjing of Zhenbai took the *Supplementary Records* and integrated them with the *Shennong’s Materia Medica*, writing in red and black ink to distinguish them, a method then praised for its clarity. He further examined their functions and properties, adding annotations and organizing the work into seven scrolls, which circulated in the southern lands. By the Tang dynasty, further collation was undertaken, adding over eight hundred medicinals and expanding the annotations to twenty-one scrolls. Where the *Shennong’s Materia Medica* omitted functions, they were supplemented; where Tao’s explanations erred, they were corrected.

Yet as centuries passed—over four hundred years—the red and black characters became indistinguishable in surviving copies, and old entries mixed with new annotations, leaving the text incomplete and inconsistent. Without the sagely ruler’s embrace of great unity and boundless grace, how could these errors be rectified? Thus, Your Majesty commanded a thorough examination of all textual discrepancies to produce a definitive edition, reforming any misplaced categories. For instance, *brush-tip ash* (rabbit fur) was formerly listed under herbs but is now appended to *rabbit skull*; *half-sky river* and *earth broth*, both waters, were also under herbs but are now relocated to the soil and stone category. *Drum-skin leather* is moved to join *animal hides*; *poplar resin* is reclassified under trees. *Purple mineral* (a wood product) is transferred from the jade and stone section; *bat* (a winged creature) is moved from the insects and fish category. *Citrus* and *pomelo* are appended to fruits; *edible salt* is attached to *luminous salt*. *Fresh ginger* and *dried ginger* are unified under a single entry. *Chicken intestines*, *fumitory*, *elder*, and *goosefoot*, grouped by similarity, are likewise appended.

Additionally, Chen Cangqi’s *Supplements* and Li Hanguang’s *Pronunciations and Meanings* were consulted—some sources tracing origins to alternate texts, others verifying effects through physicians’ experience—compared, and evaluated to distinguish the sound from the flawed. For example, *tuku bai* was formerly described as a type of ash but is now identified as a root; *tianma* roots were once said to resemble *red arrows*, but this is no longer the case. Discarding the false and retaining the true, new entries were established. Other corrections are too numerous to list; consensus was sought, and the text was finalized for printing.

Thereafter, white characters denote the words of Shennong; black characters, the transmissions of eminent physicians. Tang and present-era additions are each clearly annotated. Detailed explanations, precise descriptions of forms and properties, and corrections of errors are marked as *modern annotations*; textual research and exposition are marked as *modern notes*. With the principles thus settled and the reasoning made clear, the new and old medicinals together number nine hundred eighty-three, compiled into twenty-one scrolls with a table of contents. This work is now widely promulgated throughout the realm for circulation and use.

**Preface to the Tang Edition**
Composed by Kong Zhiyue, Gentleman of the Ministry of Rites.

It is said that the great virtue of Heaven and Earth is to give life, moving yin and yang to propagate all things. That by which the endowed beings preserve themselves is called *ming* (life-destiny), relying on nurturance to fulfill their years. Those who dwell in burrows and nests have few desires in response to things; but when metal is cast and wood is bent, the pursuit of cravings begins to flourish. Yet the five flavors may go awry, disrupting the proper balance of sweet and pungent; the six qi may turn harmful, upsetting the harmony of cold and warmth. External and internal forces invade, and body and spirit wage war. Food and drink seize the moment of vulnerability, giving rise to afflictions of the intestines and stomach; wind and dampness exploit the slightest opening, bringing calamity to hands and feet. Diseases creep into the skin and interstices, with none knowing how to halt them; insidiously, they settle into the vital organs, leading to early death.

Then came the age when fire was used to refine and record things, and the merit of the *Youyu* in identifying medicinals was recognized; auspicious clouds and named offices perfected the arts of diagnosis. Plants and trees were all understood in their nature, and even spirits and demons could not conceal their true conditions. Musk was carved and rhinoceros horn sliced to expel evil and drain malign influences; cinnabar was sublimed and minerals refined to draw in and restore purity and harmony. Thus was the great shelter extended to the common people, and universal relief brought to the black-haired masses. This achievement was entrusted to the likes of Qi, He, Peng, and Huan, whose tracks soared beyond all precedent; Li, Hua, Zhang, and Wu carried forward their noble renown in later times.

In the past, the Qin regime burned books, yet this classic was spared; during the Yongjia upheavals, this Way still endured.

The Liang-dynasty scholar Tao Hongjing was deeply devoted to nurturing life and diligently studied the arts of pharmacy. He held that the *Divine Farmer’s Materia Medica* was a work of unalterable truth composed by Shennong. Yet lamenting that, with the passage of time, its bamboo slips had decayed and its silk threads had frayed, and that it had become riddled with discrepancies and contradictions alongside the various records of Tong and Lei, he set about compiling and editing it into a single, coherent work—thereby refining the classical formulas and enriching the medical tradition.

However, the age was marked by rival regimes, and knowledge of distant regions remained incomplete; matters were not deliberated collectively, and annotations were constrained by individual scholarship. Thus, for instance, he retained Fangji from Jianping but discarded Banxia from Huaili; he gathered Elm Seeds in autumn and Cloud Seeds in winter; he misjudged the yellow and white of millet grains and conflated the male and female vines of *Tribulus*; he distinguished *Stephania* from *Asarum* yet grouped *Aconitum* with *Iris*; he failed to distinguish between lead and tin or between bitter orange and pomelo. Such examples were all too numerous. From his time onward, though schools of medicine branched and renowned physicians followed in succession, each merely inherited the errors of their predecessors, rarely correcting them.

Later practitioners further compounded the confusion: they gathered *Asarum* alongside *Chloranthus*, sought *Lonicera* among *Trachelospermum*; they discarded *Cinnamomum* in favor of *Millettia*, replaced *Carduus* with *Cirsium*. They perpetuated doubts through reckless practice, and none perceived the errors. As a result, diseases often turned perilous, giving rise to profound lamentation.

Thereupon, the Gentleman-in-Attendance and Acting Chief of the Right Gate Guard, Cavalry Commander and Supervisor of the Guards, Minister Su Gong, gathered Tao’s contradictions and clarified the disorder in common usage. He memorialized the throne to request a revision, which deeply accorded with the emperor’s intent. An edict was then issued to the Grand Commandant, Governor of Yangzhou, Supervisor of the National Historiography, and Pillar of State, the Duke of Zhao, Minister Wuji, along with the Grand Master for Splendid Happiness and Acting Attendant of the Imperial Pharmacy, Minister Xu Xiaochong, and twenty others, to collaborate with Su Gong in a thorough revision.

We humbly observe that as living forms arise, the moon’s phases alter their natures; as the seasons shift, the qi they receive yields different effects. When plants are removed from their native soil, their properties may remain the same, yet their efficacy changes; when their harvesting deviates from the proper time, the substance may be correct, but the season is not. With names and realities thus discordant, their thermal properties are often misjudged. When such errors are applied to the common people, the deception is already grave; when administered to rulers and fathers, the transgression is all the greater.

Thus, receiving divine guidance from above and consulting the collective wisdom below, a decree was issued throughout the realm to procure medicinal substances. Feathers, fur, scales, and shells—none were too distant to be gathered; roots, stems, flowers, and fruits—all renowned varieties were assembled. Thereupon, secret essentials were thoroughly explored, and diverse arts of healing were broadly synthesized. Though the *Shennong’s Classic* was incomplete, verified entries were recorded without omission; though the *Miscellaneous Records* remained extant, unverified claims were corrected. Their similarities and differences were examined, and selections were made with discernment. Brush and ink illuminated the merits and flaws of myriad opinions; cinnabar and verdant hues vividly captured the forms of all things. The *Materia Medica*, together with the *Illustrated Canon* and *Catalogue*, were compiled into fifty-four fascicles in total.

Your servants Yu Xi and others respectfully note: The *Preface to the Shu Edition of the Materia Medica* records fifty-three fascicles, and Lord Ying of Tang’s *Memorial on the Presentation of the Materia Medica* states: twenty fascicles of *Materia Medica*, two fascicles of *Catalogue*, thirty-five fascicles of *Drug Illustrations*, and seven fascicles of *Illustrated Canon*, totaling fifty-three fascicles. Furthermore, Lord Ying’s preface states: the *Materia Medica*, together with the *Illustrated Canon* and *Catalogue*, were compiled into fifty-three fascicles in all. According to this, the three works combined amount to fifty-three fascicles. However, Li Hanguang’s *Pronunciations and Meanings of the Materia Medica* records: thirty fascicles of the main text, one fascicle of *Catalogue*, twenty-five fascicles of *Illustrations* separately established, one fascicle of *Catalogue*, and seven fascicles of *Illustrated Canon*, totaling fifty-four fascicles. As the two accounts differ, both are here annotated. May this work encompass the wisdom of past and present, clear the eyes and ears, exhaust the subtleties of medical arts, and preserve the lives of all beings. May it endure through ten thousand generations without obscurity and remain imperishable for a hundred kings.

**Preface by Tao Hongjing of Liang**
The Master of Secluded Dwelling, residing amidst the cliffs and peaks of Mount Mao, in moments of leisure from breath cultivation, turned his mind to the arts of healing. Perusing the properties of *materia medica*, he deemed them the fullest expression of the sage’s intent and thus composed this discourse. The old accounts all attribute the work to the *Divine Farmer’s Classic*, and I believe this to be true. In ancient times, when the Divine Farmer ruled all under Heaven, he drew the Eight Trigrams to communicate with the spirits; devised plowing and planting to mitigate the harm of killing; and proclaimed medicines to cure illness, thereby rescuing lives from premature death.

These three Ways have flourished and grown ever more luminous through the ages of sages. King Wen and Confucius expounded the images and appended the *Xici*, subtly aiding both humanity and Heaven. Hou Ji and Yi Yin sowed the hundred grains, their beneficence extending to all living beings. Qi Huang and Peng Bian disseminated their teachings and guidance, their grace flowing to all that bears qi. Together, they span more than three thousand years, and the people to this day rely upon them.

Yet before the Yellow Emperor, written records were not transmitted. Such as the six lines of the hexagrams pointing downward or the depictions of sowing and reaping—these were matters of immediate practice. As for the governing properties of medicines, they must have been passed down through recognition and memory in succession; otherwise, how could they have been known? By the time of Tonglei, they were inscribed on bamboo and wooden slips. This work should be of the same category as the *Plain Questions*, though later generations have largely revised and embellished it.

The First Emperor of Qin’s burning of books exempted medical formulas, divination, and arts, so it remained intact. Yet during the Han Emperor Xian’s relocation and the Jin Emperor Huai’s flight, texts were burned and scattered. As Minister Yuxi and others carefully examined the Shu edition, it was noted that "庆" is pronounced *mi*. Of a thousand, not even one survived. What remains today are these four scrolls, as Minister Yuxi and others carefully noted in the *Tang Edition*, which also records four scrolls.

Khan Baosheng further states: *The Divine Farmer’s Materia Medica* comprises four scrolls, including the preface and the general introduction. Now, upon examination: the character "four" should be "three," an error in transmission. Why? According to the *Seven Records* of the Liang Dynasty, *The Divine Farmer’s Materia Medica* consists of three scrolls. Moreover, the red-inked inscription following Tao [Hongjing]’s preface in the present *Canon of Materia Medica* reads: *Canon of Materia Medica*, Scroll One, Scroll Two, Scroll Three. Scroll One annotates: "On the fundamental origins of medicinal properties and the forms and names of illnesses"; Scroll Two: "Three ranks of jade, stone, herbs, and trees"; Scroll Three: "Three ranks of insects, beasts, fruits, vegetables, and grains." It does not mention a separate preface or general introduction apart from these three scrolls. Thus, Khan Baosheng’s claim evidently follows an erroneous edition, fabricating a convoluted argument. The correct version should adhere to three scrolls. This is the authentic *Canon of Materia Medica*. The commanderies and counties listed as places of origin reflect the administrative divisions of the Later Han, likely recorded by [Zhang] Zhongjing, [Hua] Tuo, and others.

Additionally, there exists the *Record of Herb-Gathering by Tongjun*, which describes the flowers, leaves, forms, and colors of medicinal substances.

The *Pharmacological Pairings* in four scrolls discusses their mutual reinforcement and assistance. From the Wei and Jin dynasties onward, Wu Pu (as Minister Yu Xi and others carefully noted in the *Shu Edition* annotations: "Pu was a native of Guangling and a disciple of Hua Tuo") compiled a *Materia Medica* in one scroll. Li Dangzhi (as Minister Yu Xi and others carefully noted in the *Shu Edition* annotations: "a disciple of Hua Tuo") revised the ancient *Divine Farmer’s Canon*, though it saw little use in the world, and further additions and omissions were made. Some versions list 595 entries, others 441 or 319; some intermingle the three ranks, confusing cold and heat, failing to distinguish herbs from stones or insects from beasts. Moreover, their therapeutic indications often err in efficacy, and physicians, unable to examine all texts, vary in knowledge and depth. Here, I have synthesized the various canons, refining and condensing their complexities. Taking the *Divine Farmer’s Canon*’s three ranks—totaling 365 entries—as the foundation, I have added 365 supplementary entries from eminent physicians, making 730 in all. Both refined and coarse substances are included, with nothing omitted. I have classified them into categories, arranged by type, and annotated their contemporary uses, places of origin, and Daoist techniques requiring them. Together with this preface, the work comprises seven scrolls. Though it may not rival the excellence of earlier masters, it represents one household’s compilation. After my passing, may it be bequeathed to those of discerning taste.

The *Divine Farmer’s Canon of Materia Medica*, Scroll One: "On the fundamental origins of medicinal properties and the forms and names of illnesses," records and classifies entries for detailed examination and application.
The *Divine Farmer’s Canon of Materia Medica*, Scroll Two: "Three ranks of jade, stone, herbs, and trees."
The *Divine Farmer’s Canon of Materia Medica*, Scroll Three: "Three ranks of insects, beasts, fruits, vegetables, and grains," along with "Three ranks of substances with names but no current use."

The above three scrolls—with the middle and lower scrolls containing a total of 730 medicinal entries—each have separate catalogues. Red and black inks are interspersed, with annotations in smaller script. Here, the text is divided into seven scrolls in large script.

The Tang edition’s annotations to the *Han shu · Yiwen zhi* mention the *Yellow Emperor’s Inner and Outer Canons*. Ban Gu’s discussion states: "The *jingfang* (classical formulas) are based on the cold and warmth of herbs and stones, tracing the depth of illnesses." This is Ban Gu’s discourse on classical formulas, yet it does not mention the term *materia medica*. Only the *Seven Records of the Liang* includes the *Divine Farmer’s Materia Medica* in three scrolls. Tao [Hongjing] expanded it with the *Separate Records* to form seven scrolls. The preface states: "The three ranks are intermingled, cold and heat confused, herbs and stones undifferentiated, insects and beasts unclassified. How could herbs and trees share the same rank, or insects and beasts the same category? Perusal is difficult, and illustration no easier." Now, I have made the preface one scroll, the general principles two scrolls, the three ranks of jade and stones three scrolls, the three ranks of herbs six scrolls, the three ranks of trees three scrolls, birds and beasts one scroll, insects and fish one scroll, fruits one scroll, vegetables one scroll, grains one scroll, and substances with names but no current use one scroll, totaling twenty scrolls. Within the eighteen scrolls, there are 850 medicinal entries: 361 from the *Divine Farmer’s Canon*, 181 from the *Separate Records*, 115 newly appended, and 192 with names but no current use.

The 120 upper-rank medicines serve as sovereigns, governing life-nurturance in accord with Heaven. They are non-toxic and may be taken in large doses over long periods without harm. Those seeking to lighten the body, augment qi, prevent aging, and prolong life should rely on the upper canon. The 120 middle-rank medicines serve as ministers, governing temperament-nurturance in accord with humanity. They may be non-toxic or toxic, and their use should be carefully measured. Those seeking to suppress illness and supplement deficiency should rely on the middle canon. The 125 lower-rank medicines serve as assistants and envoys, governing disease treatment in accord with Earth. They are often toxic and should not be taken for long. Those seeking to eliminate pathogenic cold and heat, break up accumulations, and cure illnesses should rely on the lower canon. The three ranks together comprise 365 entries, corresponding to the 365 degrees of the celestial cycle, each degree aligning with a day to complete a year. Doubling this number yields 730 names.

Minister Yu Xi and others, following the conventions of *materia medica* texts, wrote the *Divine Farmer’s Canon* in red ink and the *Separate Records of Eminent Physicians* in black ink. The *Divine Farmer’s Canon* contains 365 medicinal entries, and here it speaks of doubling this number to 730 names, which includes the supplementary entries from the *Separate Records*. Thus, this passage is from the *Separate Records* and should be written in black ink. Likely due to prolonged transmission and copying, red and black inks became confused, leading later readers to cull such passages and claim they were not part of the *Divine Farmer’s* text but were later additions. This is the general reason.

The original account is as above. Now, examining the properties of upper-rank medicines: though they can also dispel illness, their effects are gentle and gradual, lacking immediate efficacy. However, with prolonged use over months and years, great benefits are assured. Once illness is cured, life is also extended. The Dao of Heaven is benevolent and nurturing, hence it is said to accord with Heaven. The 120 varieties correspond to the months of yin, mao, chen, and si, aligning with the time when all things flourish. The properties of middle-rank medicines gradually deepen in their therapeutic effects, while their claims of lightening the body grow fainter. For those who take them, relief from suffering is swift, but life extension is slower. Humanity embraces temperament and nature, hence it is said to accord with humanity. The 120 varieties correspond to the months of wu, wei, shen, and you, aligning with the time when all things mature. The properties of lower-rank medicines focus solely on attacking illness. Their potent and fierce qi deplete the harmony of the center and should not be taken long-term; they are to be discontinued once illness is cured. Earth’s nature is to gather and restrain, hence it is said to accord with Earth.

The 125 varieties correspond to the months of xu, hai, zi, and chou, aligning with the time when all things wither and store away, with intercalary months included to complete the full count. In the composition of medicinal formulas, one need not use them exclusively, for they naturally adapt to the patient’s condition and act in concert. However, the hierarchy of sovereign, minister, assistant, and courier must follow the principles outlined below; this does not apply to single-ingredient remedies.

Medicines have sovereigns, ministers, assistants, and couriers to harmonize and regulate one another. A well-balanced formula should consist of one sovereign, two ministers, three assistants, and five couriers; alternatively, it may comprise one sovereign, three ministers, and nine assistants and couriers. The original text states as much.

Now, in practice, the use of medicines resembles the governance of men: if there are too many sovereigns and too few ministers, or too many ministers and too few assistants, the qi and efficacy will be uneven. Yet upon examining the immortal classics and secular prescriptions, one finds that not all adhere strictly to this rule. Generally, medicines for nourishing life emphasize sovereigns; those for cultivating nature emphasize ministers; and those for treating illness emphasize assistants. One should primarily follow the inherent nature of each medicine while also exercising careful judgment. Those who master this approach will achieve the greatest benefit.

Moreover, even among the sovereigns of the upper rank, there are distinctions of nobility and humility—like the feudal lords of various states, all of whom may govern independently yet still owe allegiance to the Zhou court. The same principle applies to ministers and assistants. Thus, asparagus root and polygala each have their own sovereigns and ministers; licorice is the "elder of the realm," while rhubarb is the "general." Their ranks and distinctions are clearly defined. Who but the most learned scholars could fully discern these gradations? One must grasp the relative weight of each to determine their proper proportions.

Medicines possess yin and yang correspondences. Minister Yu Shi et al., citing the *Shu Ben* annotations, state: All things under heaven and earth, whether great or small, possess yin and yang and belong to distinct categories of form and color. Investigating their principles reveals their inherent patterns. Thus, creatures with fur and feathers are born of yang yet belong to yin; those with scales and shells are born of yin yet belong to yang. For example, azurite corresponds to wood, hence its blue color and governance of the liver; cinnabar corresponds to fire, hence its red color and governance of the heart; mica corresponds to metal, hence its white color and governance of the lungs; orpiment corresponds to earth, hence its yellow color and governance of the spleen; and magnetite corresponds to water, hence its black color and governance of the kidneys. The rest may be deduced by analogy.

Medicines also have relationships of mother and child, elder and younger sibling. Minister Yu Shi et al., citing the *Shu Ben* annotations, provide the example of elm bark as the mother and magnolia bark as the child. They may be categorized by root, stem, flower, fruit, herb, mineral, bone, or flesh. Among them, some act alone, while others interact through mutual necessity, mutual reinforcement, mutual restraint, mutual aversion, mutual incompatibility, or mutual neutralization. These seven relationships must be considered when compounding formulas. One should employ those that are mutually necessary or reinforcing, and avoid those that are mutually averse or incompatible. If a toxic medicine requires moderation, one may use those that mutually restrain or neutralize it; otherwise, they should not be combined.

Minister Yu Shi et al., citing the *Shu Ben* annotations, further state: Among the 365 medicines, 71 act alone, 12 are mutually necessary, 90 are mutually reinforcing, 78 mutually restrain one another, 60 are mutually averse, 18 are mutually incompatible, and 36 mutually neutralize one another. These seven relationships must be carefully considered when compounding formulas. The original text states as much.

Here now follows the translation:

Though their therapeutic effects may be the same, their natures and principles do not harmonize, and their combination may instead give rise to harm. Upon examining old formulas, one finds that some employ medicines that are mutually averse or incompatible, yet their administration does not result in injury. This may be due to the presence of a restraining or moderating agent—just as Kou and Jia aided the Han, or Cheng and Zhou assisted the Wu—so long as the fundamental constitution remains sound, private inclinations cannot cause harm. Even so, it is still preferable not to use them. For instance, the immortal formula *Gancao Wan* contains *fangji* and *xixin*, while the common remedy *Yushi San* uses *guadi* and dried ginger. Such examples are too numerous to list in full; several dozen more are recorded separately below.

*Banxia* is toxic, and its use requires fresh ginger—this is to employ what it fears in order to restrain it. As for those that are mutually necessary or reinforcing, they need not belong to the same category, just as in preparing a stew or seasoning fish and meat, scallions and fermented beans each have their proper place, and their mutual enhancement is evident.

Medicines possess the five flavors—sour, salty, sweet, bitter, and acrid—and the four qi: cold, hot, warm, and cool. They may be toxic or non-toxic. Whether dried in the shade or sun, the season and month of harvest, whether used fresh or prepared, the land of their origin, their authenticity, age, and freshness—all follow their own principles.

The above follows the original text.

Additionally, the division of dosages and the weighing of amounts—whether light or heavy, more or less—must all be carefully discerned.

If used appropriately to match the illness, the medicine will bring recovery upon entering the mouth, restoring health and prolonging life. If cold and heat are misaligned, authenticity and category mistaken, dosages miscalculated, or decoctions and pills improperly prepared, the condition may worsen instead of improve, even leading to death. Medicine is a matter of intention—what the ancients called a "good physician" was one skilled at gauging the proper measure through discernment. As the saying goes: "Without good physicians, half the people die in vain; an inept doctor treating illness is worse than no treatment at all." It is like a cook preparing a stew of eels and turtles—eating it would only exacerbate the illness, how could one hope to satisfy hunger? Thus, Zhang Zhongjing said: "Those who die in such ways are killed by foolish physicians."

Medicines have their proper forms: some are suited for pills, some for powders, some for water decoctions, some for wine infusions, and some for ointments or simmered pastes. Some substances serve multiple purposes, while others cannot be used in decoctions or wine—all must follow the nature of the medicine without deviation.

The above follows the original text.

Furthermore, illnesses may require pills, powders, decoctions, wine infusions, or ointments, sometimes used in combination. One must examine the root of the disease to determine the appropriate preparation. To treat an illness, first investigate its origin, observe its mechanisms, and assess whether the five viscera are unweakened, the six bowels unexhausted, the blood and vessels unconfused, and the spirit undispersed—only then will the medicine surely bring recovery. If the disease is already fully developed, only partial recovery may be possible. If the disease has already progressed beyond its peak, life may be difficult to preserve.

The above follows the original text.

Now, unless one is a truly enlightened physician—able to listen to the voice, observe the complexion, and diagnose the pulse—who can recognize an illness before it manifests? Moreover, those who are not yet ill are unlikely to seek treatment. Thus, Lord Huan ignored the subtle signs in his skin, allowing the disease to penetrate to his bones and marrow. Today, not only is comprehension difficult, but even accepting and trusting the diagnosis is no easy matter. As Canggong said: "Refusing to take medicine is one path to death; trusting shamans over physicians is a second; and recklessly endangering one’s life without care is a third."

Though the causes of illness are manifold, they all relate to pathogenic factors. Pathogens are unorthodox influences—conditions contrary to the body’s normal principles. Wind, cold, summerheat, dampness, hunger, satiety, overwork, and indolence are all pathogenic, not merely demonic miasmas. Humans live within qi as fish live in water: when the water is turbid, the fish grow emaciated; when the qi is murky, people fall ill. The harm caused by pathogenic qi is profound and severe. Once the meridians receive this qi, it transmits to the viscera and bowels, which, depending on their conditions of deficiency or excess, cold or heat, bind together to form illness. Diseases then generate one another, leading to widespread transformations.

The spirit resides within the body as its master. When the body is afflicted by pathogens, the spirit becomes disordered. Once the spirit is disordered, demonic influences enter, their power gradually strengthening as the spirit’s defense weakens—how could death not follow? The ancients compared this to planting a willow, and the principle holds true.

However, some illnesses arise first from demonic or spiritual causes, in which case prayers and exorcisms are appropriate. Even so, such methods still benefit from medicinal treatment, as seen in Li Ziyu’s example of the "Red Pill." If medicine proves ineffective, then exorcism is futile, as in the case of Duke Jing of Jin’s affliction in the *gaohuang*. Generally, the harms caused by ghosts and spirits are manifold, while the sources of illness are essentially one—differing only in severity. As the *Zhen Gao* states: "Those who habitually fail to serve the Dao properly bring about the root of a hundred illnesses, yet they blame the spirits. Exposed to wind and external dampness, they fault others for failing to cover them—such are fools."

"Serving the Dao properly" refers to all actions being carefully considered. If one indulges in food and drink without restraint, disrupting the balance of yin and yang, this becomes the root of all illnesses. Internal depletion arises, while wind and dampness invade from without, together forming the harm. How can this be attributed to the divine? One should instead diligently pursue medicinal treatment.

When using toxic medicines to treat illness, begin with a dose the size of a millet grain. If the illness subsides, stop; if not, double the dose; if still ineffective, increase it tenfold, continuing until the illness is resolved.

The above follows the original text.

Now, among medicines, some contain one or two toxic substances, such as croton or kansui—these should not be administered in full doses immediately. As the classics state: For a single toxic substance, take one pill the size of a fine hemp seed; for two toxic substances, take two pills the size of a large hemp seed; for three toxic substances, take three pills the size of a *hudou*; for four toxic substances, take four pills the size of a small bean; for five toxic substances, take five pills the size of a large bean; for six toxic substances, take six pills the size of a *wuzi*. From seven to ten, all pills should be the size of a *wuzi*, with the number corresponding to the count. Moreover, toxicity varies in severity—how could wolfsbane or gelsemium be equated with aconite or genkwa? All such cases require careful measurement.

Minister Yu Xi and others respectfully note: The old Tang edition states: For three toxic substances, take three pills the size of a small bean; for four toxic substances, take four pills the size of a large bean; for five toxic substances, take five pills the size of a rabbit’s dropping. A note clarifies: "A rabbit’s dropping is the size of a *wuzi*, but the gradations are inconsistent. Here, *hudou* replaces small beans, small beans replace large beans, and large beans replace rabbit droppings, as a compromise."

Treat cold with hot medicines, heat with cold medicines, indigestion with emetic or purgative medicines, demonic afflictions and worm toxins with toxic medicines, abscesses and tumors with medicines for sores, and wind-dampness with wind-dampness medicines—each according to its proper application.

The above follows the original text.

Furthermore, some medicines, though single substances, can address over ten illnesses. One should identify their particular strengths as the foundation, while also considering the patient’s deficiency or excess, supplementation or drainage, gender, age, suffering or comfort, prosperity or hardship, and the customs of their region—all of which differ.

Chu Cheng treats widows and nuns differently from wives and concubines—this is because he understands the dispositions of their hearts. For illnesses above the diaphragm, eat first and then take medicine; for illnesses below the heart and abdomen, take medicine first and then eat. For ailments in the limbs and blood vessels, medicine should be taken on an empty stomach in the morning; for illnesses in the bone marrow, it should be taken after a full meal at night.

The above follows the original text.

Yet this is not merely about the multifaceted nature of medicinal properties—timing and regulation must also be adjusted. The terms "before meals" and "after meals" used by contemporary physicians derive from this principle. Some medicines must be taken with wine, some with water, some chilled, and some warmed. When taking decoctions, the frequency may be sparse or frequent, and when preparing them, some are boiled briefly while others require prolonged cooking—each has its proper method and should be carefully considered.

The major illnesses include wind-stroke, cold damage, alternating chills and fever, warm malaria, possession by evil spirits, cholera, abdominal distension, edema, intestinal obstruction, dysentery, urinary and fecal retention, running piglet qi, counterflow coughing and vomiting, jaundice, wasting-thirst, lingering fluids and food accumulations, hard masses and concretions, fright-induced disorders, epilepsy, demonic afflictions, throat impediment, toothache, deafness, blindness, metal wounds, fractures, abscesses, malignant sores, hemorrhoids, scrofula, and goiter. For men, the five taxations and seven injuries, depletion and emaciation; for women, vaginal discharge, flooding and spotting, blood block, and genital erosion. Injuries from worms, snakes, and gu toxins are also included. These are the broad categories of major illnesses, while their variations and branches should be addressed according to their specific patterns.

Examining the indications of contemporary medicinals, they address only a single name for each illness. For instance, "wind-stroke" encompasses dozens of varieties, while the patterns of cold damage number over twenty. Further refining these into categories and tracing their origins and outcomes, one must take the fundamental nature of the illness as the root, then match the various symptoms to formulate the appropriate remedy. The transformations of disease cannot be uniformly described—hence why medical texts span thousands of scrolls yet still fail to exhaust their principles.

Before the Spring and Autumn period, the writings of He and Huan are scarcely heard of, while the *Daoist Scriptures* briefly record a few methods of Bian Que, though their medicinal applications still follow the intentions of *materia medica* scholars. By the Han, the formulas of Chun Yuyi and Hua Tuo that survive today also systematically organize the properties of medicinals. Only Zhang Zhongjing’s work stands as the progenitor of all formulas, and even he relied entirely on the *materia medica*. Yet his excellence lay in pulse diagnosis, understanding qi and seasonal dynamics, and adjusting treatments accordingly.

As for methods like intestinal incision, chest dissection, bone scraping, and tendon reconnection, these belong to specialized military techniques, not the tradition of Shennong. From the Jin dynasty onward, there were eminent physicians such as Zhang Miao, Guan Tai, Liu De, Shi Tuo, Zhan Shao, Zhao Quan, and Li Ziyu. Among the nobility and scholars, figures like Ruan Deru, Zhang Maoxian, Pei [Yimin], Huangfu Shi’an, as well as the southerners Ge Hong, Cai Mo, and Shang Zhongkan, all delved deeply into the art of medicinals.

In the Song, there were Yang Xin, Yuan Hui, Hu Qia, and Qin Chengzu; in the Qi, the Minister Chu Cheng, Xu Wenbo, and the brothers of the Sibai lineage—all of whom cured eight or nine out of ten cases. Each of these physicians composed their own formulas, and upon examining their aims, do they not all derive from the *materia medica*? Even when they occasionally employed other medicinals, they still followed their inherent properties, never transgressing these bounds.

The *Fan Wang Formulas* in over a hundred scrolls, along with Ge Hong’s *Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergencies*, include minor single-ingredient remedies proven through use, as well as folk-tested methods and techniques from distant lands. For example, the blood-stanching effect of lotus root peel originated with kitchen workers, while the water-expelling use of morning glory was first discovered by rural elders.

The garlic from bakeries serves as a remedy to expel serpents; the *dishu* growing by the roadside is prized as a secret treatment for metal-inflicted wounds. This demonstrates that among the myriad things between heaven and earth, none exists without its use—yet their efficacy arises from fortuitous encounters, not from any inherent correspondence. Yan Guanglu also stated that in elucidating the properties of the three grades of medicinals, one must take the *materia medica* as the foundation.

Daoist scriptures, immortals’ formulas, dietary regimens, grain-abstention practices, methods for prolonging life and reversing aging—even the marvels of flying elixirs and alchemical transmutation, the wonders of cloud-soaring and feathered transcendence—all place the Dao of medicinals first. The principle of using medicinals remains identical to that of the *materia medica*; only the methods of preparation and administration differ slightly from worldly practices. Just as fine grains and meats sustain life, so too do the peoples of Hua and Yi, along with birds and beasts, all rely upon them for sustenance. Their fundamental principles are the same, though their natures and spiritual qualities differ.

Generally, the substances used are not numerous—rarely exceeding twenty or so. Even when employing just a few in isolation, great benefit may be achieved, for their effects accumulate over years of ingestion. This aligns with the *materia medica*’s assertion of the efficacy of long-term use. Unlike common folk, who cease at the slightest perception of effect, those who persist to the utmost may attain extraordinary longevity—how could it be merely a matter of nourishing the body or curing illness?

Yet today’s mediocre physicians, when treating patients, all consult the *materia medica* in a cursory manner. Some rely on old formulas, others on hearsay, or whatever comes to mind, hastily scribbling prescriptions. In an instant, they don masks of expertise, parading their supposed skill. They disregard contraindications and incompatibilities, remain oblivious to their own ignorance, and pay no heed to discrepancies in medicinal categories or dosages. If by chance a patient recovers, they credit the efficacy of their formula; if recovery does not come within ten days or a month, they claim the illness was deeply rooted. They never reflect on their own failings or ponder their successes and mistakes. Instead, they boast of their reputation, amass gold and silk, and—whether in life or after death—will surely face retribution.

For the Five Classics and Four Divisions, or matters of state and ritual attire, even if one’s application is flawed, the consequences are limited to practical inconvenience. But with decoctions and medicinals, a single error in substance can cost a life. How can rulers of a thousand chariots or lords worth a hundred gold not deeply reflect and exercise caution?

In ancient times, the Crown Prince of Xu, by failing to taste the medicine he presented, incurred the infamy of regicide. When Ji Sun prepared medicine, Confucius remarked that he did not yet understand it. Such is the gravity of treating medicinal properties lightly.

During the Jin dynasty, a learned man wished to revise the *Book of Changes* and various medical formulas. He first discussed the matter with Zu Nè, who said: “In interpreting the classics, even if there are discrepancies, they do not harm moral instruction. But with decoctions and medicinals, even minor misunderstandings can determine life and death, thereby inflicting great harm on later generations. How can one lightly presume to judge?” Zu’s words demonstrate profound insight and serve as a mirror for posterity.

As the *Analects* states: “A man without constancy cannot be a shaman or a physician.” This makes clear that these two arts cannot be practiced with arbitrary embellishments or reckless fabrication. Thus, one who has not studied medicine for three generations should not be entrusted with their remedies. Only one who has broken their arm nine times becomes a skilled physician—this is because profound mastery requires deep learning.

Yet another concern is that many of today’s practitioners rely on inherited reputation and high fees, failing to diligently study and refine their skills. It is truly lamentable. They cultivate empty reputations, and patients flock to them upon hearing their names. Meanwhile, those who are newly learned and truly enlightened, but whose names have not yet spread, are dismissed by the wealthy and powerful as mere beginners and left unused. They entrust their lives to hollow reputations—how regrettable!

In the capital, people all value fame and reputation, not practical results. Since the time of my ancestors, our family has been dedicated to the study and application of formulas. We possessed a copy of the *Fan Wang Formulas*, and through careful selection and use, we achieved many cures, protecting our household and aiding our relatives. For those who sincerely sought our help, regardless of status, we spared no effort, saving hundreds and thousands of lives.

Even after I left the capital to reside south of the Five Ridges, I did not forget this pursuit. Day and night, I studied and savored these texts, ever filled with joy. Now, I have compiled three scrolls of formulas, along with five scrolls of *Proven Remedies*, and have supplemented Ge Hong’s *Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergencies* with three additional scrolls. My aim is to continue this virtuous tradition, ensuring that my descendants do not lose it, so that it may aid both body and others.

The first scroll of the *Illustrated Classic with Expanded Exegesis of the Materia Medica* concludes here.

*Volume Two: General Principles*

**General Principles, Part One**

Now, considering the methods of gathering and preparing medicinal substances: since ready-made materials are universally employed and none are personally collected, I shall no longer expound upon these matters. However, the proper combination of medicines requires an understanding of their regulations, which I set forth as follows.

All medicinal substances originate from distinct regions. Before the Qin and Han dynasties, these were referred to by the names of the various states. The present designations of commanderies and counties were later alterations. Since the Jiangdong period, minor and miscellaneous drugs have largely been sourced from nearby regions, yet their *qi*, nature, and properties fall short of those from their native lands. If, for instance, communication between Jing and Yi were severed, and one were forced to rely solely on Dang-gui from Liyang or the "Three Builders" of Qiantang, how could they compare? Thus, the efficacy of modern treatments does not match that of the ancients, and this must be the reason.

Though Sichuanese and northern medicines circulate in the market, they are no longer of fine quality. Moreover, merchants, ignorant of medicinal properties, judge only by appearance. Ginseng from Shangdang is no longer esteemed, while Xixin from Huayin is discarded like refuse. Each region competes according to local custom, and few can stock a comprehensive inventory; thus, many varieties are inevitably omitted. Of those remaining, barely two hundred kinds persist.

Physicians today do not recognize medicinal substances and rely solely on merchants, while merchants themselves lack discernment and entrust matters to gatherers and suppliers. These suppliers, through inherited practices, manipulate the authenticity, quality, and condition of drugs, all beyond scrutiny. Thus, stalactites are boiled in vinegar to whiten them; Xixin is soaked to straighten it; Huangqi is steamed with honey to sweeten it; Dang-gui is moistened with wine for luster; mantis egg-cases are glued to mulberry branches; and centipedes are dyed red at the feet. Such practices, though contrary to fact, have become customary through long use and are now regarded as standard—yet what can be done?

Furthermore, when apportioning medicines according to formulas, no allowance is made for trimming and discarding. For example, with Yuanzhi and Mudan, barely half remains after preparation; with Dihuang and Maimendong, a third is lost. In all cases where skins are removed or hearts discarded, the weights no longer correspond. Patients, following these measures blindly, do not realize they must reweigh to obtain the proper amount.

When nobles and high officials prepare medicines, they delegate the task entirely to subordinates. Among these, precious stones and costly drugs are invariably pilfered and replaced. Even Cinnabar and Fluorite are retrieved after ingestion, washed, and resold—sometimes passing through a dozen hands. Such deceptions are manifold, and though overseers may be appointed, the fraud remains undetected. With such practices, how can treatments yield swift results? These are matters of excess and deficiency in the apothecary’s trade, not faults of the physician’s skill.

The timing for gathering medicines is traditionally reckoned from the first month of the year, following the calendar established after the Han *Tai Chu* era. Roots are often collected in the second and eighth months, for in early spring, when sap first rises and before it ascends to the branches and leaves, the *qi* and potency are most concentrated. By autumn, when branches and leaves wither, the sap returns to the roots. Observation confirms that spring harvests should be early and autumn harvests late, while flowers, fruits, stems, and leaves are gathered as they ripen. The seasons may vary in earliness or lateness, so one need not rigidly adhere to the texts.

The texts speak of "drying in the shade," which refers to drying during the *yin* phases of the *liu jia* cycle. According to the *Dun Jia* method, during the *jia-zi*旬, the *yin* phase occurs at *gui-you*, so medicines are placed in the *you* position. Yet this is unnecessary; "drying in the shade" simply means avoiding direct sun exposure and drying in a shaded area. Some texts also mention sun-drying, and if both methods are feasible, it is all the better.

Now, according to my observations, medicines dried in the shade are often inferior. For instance, deer antler, said to require shade-drying, invariably rots. Fire-drying yields better results. Herbs, roots, and shoots dried in the shade also fare poorly. Those gathered before the ninth month should be sun-dried, while those collected after the tenth month are best dried in the shade.

Ancient weights included only *zhu* and *liang*, with no *fen*. Today, ten millet grains equal one *zhu*, six *zhu* make one *fen*, four *fen* make one *liang*, and sixteen *liang* make one *jin*. Though the system of millet grains as a standard has long been established, we continue to use it as is.

Your servants Yu Xi and others respectfully note that the *Tang Ben* states: "Ancient weights were all double the present ones, as seen in the southern weights. The Jin weights, beginning in the late Han, halved the *jin* and *liang*." Gold, silver, silk, and brocade, however, remain unchanged in weight relative to medicines.

Of ancient formulas, only those of Zhang Zhongjing survive. If modern weights were applied to ancient formulas, the water in decoctions would be insufficient. Thus, it is clear that the weights used were not ancient but modern.

When modern formula compilers speak of "equal parts," they do not refer to *fen* and *liang* but mean that all ingredients share the same weight. The physician first assesses the severity of the illness and adjusts the quantities accordingly. Such practices apply only to pills and powders; decoctions and medicinal wines do not use equal parts.

For powders, a "knife-point" (*dao gui*) is one-tenth of a square-inch spoon (*fang cun bi*), roughly the size of a *wutong* seed. A *fang cun bi* is a spoon one inch square, filled with powder to the point of not spilling. A "five-coin spoon" (*qian wu bi*) uses a five-*zhu* coin with the edge characters "five" to scoop powder, also to the point of not spilling. A "pinch" (*cuo*) is four *dao gui*; ten pinches make one *shao*, and ten *shao* make one *ge*.

When medicines are measured by volume, it is because their density and weight vary, making weight impractical. The medicinal *sheng* is square, with an upper diameter of one *cun*, a lower diameter of six *fen*, and a depth of eight *fen*. The powder is placed inside without pressing; one merely shakes it gently to level it. Modern practitioners no longer use this method.

For pills, "fine hemp seed" refers to sesame seeds, not necessarily flat but of roughly uniform size.

As with millet and glutinous millet, so too here: sixteen grains of millet make one "large bean." "Like hemp seeds" refers to three times the size of fine sesame seeds. "Like *hu* beans" are the green-speckled beans of today, equivalent to two hemp seeds. "Like small beans" are today’s red adzuki beans, varying in size but roughly equal to three hemp seeds. "Like large beans" are equivalent to two small beans. "Like *wu* seeds" are equivalent to two large beans. One square-inch spoonful of powder, when mixed with honey, should form pills the size of *wu* seeds, with ten pills as the standard measure.

The *Tang Materia Medica* notes: one square-inch spoonful of powder, made into pills the size of *wu* seeds, yields sixteen pills; one pill the size of a pellet or a parrot’s egg yolk is equivalent to forty pills. Today, pellets are equated with goose egg yolks, though this is highly inconsistent.

For decoctions, wines, and ointments, old formulas often mention "blowing and chewing" (*chui ju*), meaning that after weighing, the ingredients are pounded to the size of large beans, then blown to remove fine powder. This method is impractical: some drugs crumble easily, others resist, producing uneven amounts of powder. Weighing thus becomes inconsistent. Today, all ingredients are finely chopped to approximate the size of "blown and chewed" pieces, ensuring no powder remains and that fragments are uniform.

The *Tang Materia Medica* annotates: "*Chui ju* properly means deliberation and adjustment; other interpretations are extraneous." Your servants Yu Xi et al. observe that *chui ju* aligns with the earlier meaning of fine chopping, not deliberation.

For pills and powders, ingredients are first chopped finely and dried in the sun before pounding. Some are pounded separately, others together, as the formula dictates. For moist drugs like *Asparagus cochinchinensis* (tianmen dong) or dried *Rehmannia* (gan dihuang), first chop, dry, and pound individually until roughly broken, then tear into smaller pieces and dry again. If rain prevents sun-drying, use gentle heat. Once dry, let cool slightly before pounding.

Moist drugs shrink significantly when dried; increase their initial weight to compensate, ensuring the final powdered weight is accurate. This does not apply to decoctions or wines.

For sifting pill ingredients, use tightly woven silk to ensure fineness, making honeyed pills easier to cook. For powdered herbal medicines, use loosely woven silk to prevent clumping when taken with wine. Stone drugs should also be sifted through fine silk to match pill consistency.

After sifting pills or powders, recombine them in a mortar and pound several hundred times until the color and texture are uniform.

For decoctions, wines, or ointments containing minerals, pound them finely to the size of millet grains, or sift through kudzu cloth for evenness, then wrap separately in new silk before adding. Realgar (*xiong huang*) and cinnabar (*zhu sha*) should be ground to a fine powder.

When preparing decoctions, use a gentle flame to maintain a slight boil. The water quantity follows the formula’s proportions: roughly twenty *liang* of ingredients require one *dou* of water, boiled down to four *sheng* as a standard. However, purgative decoctions should be prepared with less water to yield more liquid, while restorative decoctions require more water to produce less liquid. Carefully adjust water volume to avoid excess or insufficiency.

Strain through new cloth, wrung by two people using a wooden rod. Clarify by settling, then cover with paper to seal. Warm decoctions should not be placed in containers with residual moisture; heating over boiling water is also effective. When administering, ensure the decoction is slightly boiling—hot liquids are easier to swallow, while cold ones may induce vomiting.

Formulas specifying two or three doses should ensure the effects overlap. Adjust frequency and quantity based on the patient’s strength and the illness’s severity, rather than strictly adhering to the formula.

For medicinal wines, chop ingredients finely, place in a raw silk bag, and seal in wine. The duration depends on climate; once sufficiently potent, the wine may be decanted without waiting for full extraction. The lees can be dried, lightly pounded, and re-steeped for consumption or taken as powder.

For restorative decoctions like *Jianzhong* or *Shenli*, combine the lees of two doses, add water, and boil to exhaustion. This yields the potency of one fresh dose, a practical method for the poor. All lees should first be dried.

When preparing ointments, initially soak ingredients in vinegar until thoroughly moistened—avoid excess liquid—and seal tightly to prevent leakage. "A full day and night" (*zhou shi*) means from dawn to the next dawn, though some formulas specify only one night.

When cooking ointments, perform "three risings and three fallings" to dissipate heat and extract medicinal properties. Bring to a gentle boil, then lower to let the liquid settle before repeating. The mixture should remain slightly raw. For ingredients like lotus petals, lightly brown both ends. For *Angelica dahurica* (baizhi) or *Aconitum* (fuzi), a slight yellowing suffices.

Avoid exposing animal fats to water; those prepared in the twelfth lunar month are especially fine. Strain ointments through new cloth.

For edible ointments, the lees may be boiled in wine for consumption. For topical ointments, apply the lees directly to the affected area to fully utilize their medicinal power.

When ointments contain realgar or cinnabar, grind them separately into fine powder, then add to the strained ointment, stirring rapidly until thickened to prevent settling. For mercury, grind it into the congealed ointment until fully dispersed. Lead powder (*hu fen*) is treated similarly.

When using rhubarb (*dahuang*) in decoctions, do not chop finely. For decoctions, first soak in water until thoroughly moistened, seal overnight, then add to the boiling liquid just before completion, boiling two or three more times before straining. This enhances potency and facilitates purgation. For pills or powders, rhubarb was traditionally steamed, but this is no longer necessary.

For decoctions containing ephedra (*mahuang*), first boil it separately two or three times, skimming off the foam, then replenish the water to its original volume before adding the remaining ingredients. Otherwise, it may cause restlessness. Ephedra should have its nodes removed, its fibers opened, and be cut into inch-long segments. *Xiaocao* and *qumai* are cut into five-fen pieces; *xixin* and *baiqian* into three-fen pieces. For pills, powders, or ointments, they are finely chopped.

For decoctions, whole ingredients—such as dried jujubes, gardenia, and *gualou*—are split open. Small-seeded ingredients—like *shanzhuyu*, *wuweizi*, *luohe*, and *shimingzi*—are also crushed. Delicate flower seeds—such as *xuanfuhua*, chrysanthemum, *difuzi*, and *kuizi*—are used whole. Grains, beans, and wheat are likewise used whole.

All insects are first lightly roasted, except for *piaochong*, which is split open and roasted. Fresh ginger and *shegan* are thinly sliced. Mirabilite, malt sugar, and *ejiao* are added only after the decoction is strained, then heated two or three more times until fully dissolved before consumption.

When using *maidong*, lightly moisten and remove the core. Apricot and peach kernels are softened in hot water, then peeled. *Badou* is crushed, its skin removed, and the heart scraped away; otherwise, it may cause discomfort. *Shiwei* has its hairs scraped off. *Xinyi* has its hairs and core removed. *Guijian* has its feathers and bark trimmed. *Hualu* has its roots selected and lightly roasted. *Genshi* has its pulp removed and is also roasted. Sichuan peppercorns have their closed pods and stems removed, then are lightly roasted in a pan until they sweat, enhancing their potency. Alum is roasted on a tile or iron vessel until it stops bubbling. *Yushi* is wrapped in yellow clay, dried, and fired for half a day until softened and crumbled.

Rhinoceros horn and antelope horn are shaved into fine shreds. All teeth and bones are roasted and crushed. *Zaojia* has its skin and seeds removed before roasting.

For decoctions, pills, powders, or ointments, *tianxiong*, *fuzi*, *wutou*, *wuhui*, and *cezi* are roasted in hot ash until slightly cracked, then their black skins are peeled off before weighing. Only in *jiangfu* decoctions, ointments, or medicinal wines are they used raw, though still peeled and weighed, then split lengthwise into seven or eight pieces. Regardless of size, the outer blackened tips are trimmed away.

For all preparations, *banxia* is used whole. Wash it in hot water, rubbing by hand to remove its slippery coating, then peel. Replace the water and wash repeatedly until the slipperiness is gone; otherwise, it may irritate the throat. Older texts suggest washing twenty times, but six or seven suffice. Alternatively, boil it, changing the water after each boil for three or four cycles, then rub and wash before drying. Cut into fine pieces according to size before weighing for decoctions. For ointments, wines, pills, or powders, it must be thoroughly dried before weighing.

When using *ejiao* in pills or powders, first roast it until it bubbles throughout, then dry before pounding. If any part remains unpuffed, roast it further.

For pills containing beeswax, melt it and mix with a small amount of honey to blend with the other ingredients.

When using processed mugwort (*shu’ai*), first finely shred it, then pound with the other ingredients until evenly dispersed. If it cannot be sifted, pound it separately and mix it into the powder.

All honey is first heated, its foam skimmed off until it turns slightly yellow, ensuring the pills remain intact for a long time. The amount skimmed depends on the honey’s purity.

For pills or powders containing *badou*, remove its skin, heart, and membrane. Oily ingredients—such as apricot and peach kernels, *caoshuang*, and sesame—are first roasted until dark, then pounded separately into a paste. When the paste reaches a smooth consistency, gradually add the pre-pounded powder, grinding together until fully blended. Sift through fine silk, then return to the mortar and pound several hundred times as required.

For decoctions or ointments, some ingredients may also be roasted, though raw ones are simply crushed.

Ingredients like *guixin*, *houpo*, *duzhong*, *qinpi*, and *mulan* have their outer soft, rough layers scraped away, retaining only the flavorful inner parts for weighing. *Fuling* and *zhuling* have their black skins removed. *Mudan*, *bajitian*, *yuanzhi*, and *yege* have their cores pounded out. *Ziwan* is washed to remove dirt before weighing. *Xiebai* and *cong* have their green outer layers removed entirely. *Mangcao*, *shannan*, *yinyu*, and *zelan* have their leaves and tender stems selected, discarding the thick branches. *Guijiu* and *huanglian* have their root hairs removed. Sichuan peppercorns have their closed pods and stems removed, then are roasted.

*Langdu*, *genshi*, tangerine peel, *banxia*, and *wuzhuyu* are best when aged. All other ingredients should be fresh and of high quality.

When a formula specifies a certain number of *badou* seeds, account for size variation: first remove the heart and skin, then weigh, with one *fen* equaling sixteen seeds. For *fuzi* or *wutou*, remove the skin, then weigh, with half a *liang* equaling one piece. For *genshi*, remove the pulp, then weigh, with one *fen* equaling two pieces. Tangerine peel weighs one *fen* for three pieces. Jujubes vary in size, with three pieces equaling one *liang*. Dried ginger specified as "one cluster" (*lei*) weighs one *liang*. When a formula calls for one *sheng* of *banxia*, wash it and weigh five *liang*. One *sheng* of Sichuan peppercorns weighs three *liang*; one *sheng* of *wuzhuyu* weighs five *liang*; one *sheng* of *tusizi* weighs nine *liang*; one *sheng* of *anyouzi* weighs four *liang*; and one *sheng* of *shechuangzi* weighs three and a half *liang*.

One *sheng* of *difuzi* weighs four *liang* as standard. Such are their differences. When a formula specifies "one *sheng* of a certain seed," each seed varies in hollowness, solidity, lightness, and weight, making uniform weighing impossible; all are measured by level *sheng* as standard.

When a formula calls for "one *chi* of *gui*," remove the bark entirely, with half a *liang* as standard. For "one *chi* of *gancao*," the standard is two *liang*. When a formula specifies "one bundle of a certain herb," the standard weight is three *liang*. For "one handful," the standard is two *liang*. One *jin* of honey measures seven *ge*. One *jin* of lard measures one *sheng* and two *ge*.

The above outlines the methods for proportioning and preparing medicinal ingredients.

Your servants Yu Xi et al. respectfully note the prefaces to Xu Zhi’ai’s *Dui Yao*, Sun Simiao’s *Qianjin Fang*, and Chen Cangqi’s *Bencao Shiyi* as follows:

All accumulations and gatherings of diseases arise from deficiency. Deficiency gives rise to a hundred illnesses. "Accumulations" are what the five *zang* organs store; "gatherings" are what the six *fu* organs collect. For such ailments, one often relies on established formulas without need for modification. However, deficiency with taxation presents myriad complications, requiring adjustments according to the specific condition.

The skilled physicians of antiquity all gathered their own herbs, examining their properties and the seasons of harvest—whether early or late. Harvested too early, the medicinal potency is unformed; too late, its peak efficacy has waned. Today’s physicians neither gather their own herbs nor understand the timing of seasons, nor do they grasp the subtleties of cold and heat, or the precise measurements of weights. They bear only the name of healers, never achieving certain cures. This is truly delusion. Thus, we briefly examine their cold and heat properties and record the principles of augmentation and reduction:

For deficiency with taxation accompanied by headache and fever, add *gouqi* and *weirui*.
For deficiency with nausea, add *renshen*.
For deficiency with restlessness, also add *renshen*.
For deficiency with profuse, chaotic dreams, add *longgu*.
For deficiency with excessive heat, add *dihuang*, *muli*, *difuzi*, and *gancao*.
For deficiency with cold, add *danggui*, *shaoyao*, and *ganjiang*.
For deficiency with depletion, add *zhongru*, *jici*, *roucong*, and *bajitian*.
For deficiency with high fever, add *huangqin* and *tianmendong*.
For deficiency with forgetfulness, add *fushen* and *yuanzhi*.
For deficiency with fright palpitations and restlessness, add *longchi*, *shashen*, *zishiying*, and *xiaocao*.
If cold predominates, use *zishiying* and *xiaocao*; if external heat prevails, use *shashen* and *longchi*; if neither cold nor heat is present, use all.
For deficiency with dry mouth, add *maimendong* and *zhimu*.
For deficiency with shallow breathing, add *huma*, *fupenzi*, and *baiziren*.
For deficiency with qi deficiency and mild cough, add *wuweizi* and *dazao*.
For deficiency with body stiffness and lumbar discomfort, add *cishi* and *duzhong*.
For deficiency with excessive cold, add *guixin*, *wuzhuyu*, *fuzi*, and *wutou*.
For deficiency with taxation and dark urine, add *huangqin*.
For deficiency with external heat, add *digupi* and *baishuihuangqi*.
For deficiency with cold, use *Longxi huangqi*.
For deficiency with phlegm and qi stagnation, use *shengjiang*, *banxia*, and *zhishi*.
For deficiency with uninhibited urination, add *sangpiaoxiao*, *longgu*, and *haifengteng*.
For deficiency with inhibited urination, add *fuling* and *zexie*.
For deficiency with depletion and cloudy urine, add *houpo*.

Not all herbs are used exhaustively; one must select based on the body’s cold and heat properties, matching them precisely. This is but a glimpse of augmentation and reduction. Those who compose formulas should follow this principle.

For all seed-based herbs, remove the skin, tips, and any double kernels, then cut them. For *wumei*, remove the pits; when used in pills or powders, dry-fry them. For *dazao*, split and remove the pits. For *maiya*, *gou*, *dadouhuangjuan*, *zelan*, *wuyu*, *jiangcan*, *ganqi*, and *fengfang*, lightly stir-fry. For *shexiang*, *xijiao*, *lujiao*, *lingyangjiao*, *niuhuang*, *puhuang*, and *zhusha* in decoctions, grind into fine powder and add to the decoction just before consumption, stirring well to blend.

For *fuling* and *shaoyao*, use the white variety in tonics and the red variety in purgatives. For *shixie*, pound thoroughly until broken, then grind in a mortar; otherwise, they cannot be properly pulverized. For *niuxi* and *shihu* in decoctions or wines, crush before use.

For *tusizi*, rinse with warm water to remove sand and soil, dry, then soak in warm wine overnight. Remove and dry in the sun until slightly white, then pound. For any remaining uncrushed portions, soak again in wine for three to five days, then dry slightly and pound until fully broken, which should be effortless.

For *banmao* and other insects, remove legs and wings, then lightly dry-fry. For *muli*, dry-fry until yellow. For decoctions requiring wine, add it when the decoction is nearly done.

For *yin* filings, mix with mercury into a paste. For *zhongru* and other minerals, grind with a jade pestle in water for three days and nights, then wash and refine until extremely fine.

Medicines possess the properties of dispersion, unblocking, tonification, purgation, lightness, heaviness, astringency, slipperiness, dryness, and dampness—these ten categories form the fundamental nature of herbs, yet the *Bencao* does not discuss them, nor have later scholars elaborated. Thus, those who compound decoctions and pills may overlook these principles.

For example:
Dispersing herbs relieve stagnation, such as *jiang* and *ju*.
Unblocking herbs resolve stasis, such as *tongcao* and *fangji*.
Tonifying herbs remedy weakness, such as *renshen* and *yangrou*.
Purging herbs relieve obstruction, such as *baijiang* and *dahuang*.
Light herbs eliminate excess, such as *mahuang* and *gegen*.

Heavy herbs dispel timidity, such as *cishi* and *tiefen*.
Astringent herbs arrest collapse, such as *muli* and *longgu*.
Slippery herbs resolve adhesion, such as *dongkui* and *yupi*.
Drying herbs eliminate dampness, such as *sangbaipi* and *chixiaodou*.
Dampening herbs relieve rigidity, such as *zishiying* and *baishiying*.
Each of these properties belongs to its respective category.
Those who prescribe medicines must examine and deliberate carefully, so as to avoid errors.

The qi of the five directions all harm the body; dwelling among them, one inevitably contracts illness according to the prevailing qi.
Though one may grow accustomed to their nature, each region still relies on its own resources—
for Heaven generates all things to sustain humanity, just as humanity in dire need turns to them.

Now, in Lingnan, poisons abound, and herbs that resolve toxins include *jinshe* and *baiyao*.
In the Jianghu region, qi stagnation is common, and herbs that break qi include *jiang*, *ju*, and *wucaiyu*.
Where cold and warmth are unregulated, herbs that treat warmth include *chaihu* and *mahuang*.
Where frigid qi breeds wind, herbs that govern wind include *fangfeng* and *duhuo*.
Where damp qi causes impediment, herbs that treat impediment include fish, soft-shelled turtle, snails, and clams.
Where yin qi prevails, herbs that govern blood include *dijin* and *shixue*.
Where miasmic qi is rife, herbs that govern miasma include *changshan*, *yanfu*, and *fu vinegar*.
Where rocky qi is toxic, herbs that govern poison include *xijiao*, *shexiang*, and *lingyangjiao*.
Where watery qi causes dysentery, herbs that govern dysentery include *huanglian* and *huangbo*.
Where wild qi breeds *gu* toxins, herbs that govern *gu* include *dianhe* and *qiugen*.
Where sandy qi harbors short foxes, herbs that govern short foxes include *pengwu* and *hongguan*.

Such is the general pattern, each adapting to its native environment.
The central region, where qi intermingles, suffers from all manner of illnesses,
and thus physicians’ treatments must also vary according to the region’s capacities.
If one relocates to a different place, the results may prove discordant.

Thus, ancient formulas sometimes emphasize tonification, sometimes purgation;
some combine many ingredients, while others rely on a single herb.
Tonification dispels wind, purgation dispels qi;
complex formulas are prized by the elite, while single-herb remedies suit the poor.
How could the ancients have had preferences? Rather, they simply used what was appropriate.

*Preface to the Expanded and Annotated Divine Farmer’s Classic of Materia Medica with Illustrated Canon*

Just as a skilled general cannot triumph without troops,
a skilled physician cannot cure illness without medicines.
The nature of arms is easily discerned—those who wield them well can use what kills to save lives.
The nature of medicines is difficult to fathom—those who misuse them turn what should heal into instruments of death.
Alas! How fearsome indeed!

Cold, heat, warmth, and chill; pungent, sweet, slow, and swift—with myriad distinctions in their categories, how could one who has not tasted seventy poisons in a single day ever discern them? The transmitted works—*The Jade Case*, *The Golden Casket*, *The Handbook for the Elbow*, *The Satchel’s Treasury*, *The Thousand Gold Remedies*, and the secrets of *The Outer Terrace*—contain formulas beyond counting. Thus, it is not merely the difficulty of pulse examination or formula application, but the discernment of medicines that is most arduous.

The treasures of metals and stones, the marvels of plants and trees, the vast and numerous creatures of flight, swim, and growth—these vary with the winds and climates. North and south differ, some are not found within the Central Kingdom, others lie beyond human reach. To ensure that authenticity and forgery never escape one’s grasp, how could the *Materia Medica* and *Illustrated Canon* ever be set aside for even a moment?

The *Divine Farmer’s Classic of Materia Medica*, traditionally said to comprise three scrolls, was expanded by Tao Hongjing of the Liang into seven. Later, Su Gong, Li Ji, and others of the Tang further augmented it to twenty scrolls, appending illustrated drug forms as a separate canon—its contents nearly complete. During the Kaibao era, Emperor Taizu commanded Lu Duoxun and others to examine its strengths and flaws, adding many more drugs, and it was titled the *Kaibao Materia Medica*. At the beginning of the Jiayou era under Emperor Renzong, Zhang Yuxi, Lin Yi, Su Song, and Zhang Dong were tasked with supplementing and annotating it. Following the Tang *Illustrated Canon*, they produced new illustrations and increased the number of drugs to over a thousand. Thus, omissions were gathered, errors corrected, and the work was published by the authorities and disseminated throughout the realm, providing every method for nurturing life.

Yet physicians of the age cling to old ways, mired in ignorance, recklessly speculating and fabricating. They concoct a few decoctions, and if by chance they succeed a few times, they deem themselves capable of treating endless ailments. Ask them to expound, and they stare blankly, knowing nothing. To them, the *Materia Medica* and *Illustrated Canon* are but empty texts. Even in remote prefectures and humble towns, though some may wish to consult them, where could they obtain them?

Chen Cheng of the inner chambers, a young man of learning, was particularly fond of medicine and mastered the teachings of all schools. He lamented that the two books were not widely transmitted and that scholars did not possess both. Thus, he combined them into one, appending ancient and modern discourses along with his own observations and experiences, compiling them into twenty-three scrolls under the title *Expanded and Annotated Divine Farmer’s Classic of Materia Medica with Illustrated Canon*. The text elucidates its principles, the illustrations reveal their forms—opening the scroll, one gains both at once. No need to venture to distant lands or remote shores; the myriad distinctions of drugs stand vividly before one’s eyes. It is like a geographer surveying the *Map of Administrative Divisions* or a warrior entering the armory.

Chen Cheng’s ancestors were generals and ministers—what Ouyang Xiu called "four generations, six dukes"—and he was their great-grandson. Orphaned young, he served his mother in the Jiang-Huai region, living frugally on vegetables to care for her, earning the praise of gentlemen for his filial piety. Once, when his mother fell gravely ill, all the physicians were stunned, at a loss. Chen calmly examined her pulse and declared, "Administer this formula, and she will recover by this hour." And so it was. Thus, though his learning stemmed from books, his profound insight surpassed them—how could it be confined?

The ancients Gui Yuqu and Qi Bo are too distant to know, but how does he compare to Qin Yueren, Chunyu Chang, or Hua Tuo? Those with discernment will surely recognize this.

In the seventh year of the Yuanyou reign, on the first day of the fourth month, Lin Xi of Changle, Left Court Gentleman for Ceremonial Service, Academician of the Tianzhang Pavilion, Prefect of Hangzhou Prefecture and concurrent Military Commissioner, Agricultural Commissioner of the Circuit, Military Commander and Inspector of the Two Zhexi Circuit, conferred the title of Light Chariot General and granted the Purple Gold Fish Bag, composed this preface.

**Preface to *Lei Gong’s Treatise on Drug Processing***

When people use medicines, how would they know of the existence of sovereign and minister?
Having distinguished sovereign and minister, how could they fail to recognize their mutual restraint?
Take, for instance, autumn fur—now known as salt grass.
When moistened, it instantly dissolves the poison of *ban-zhong*;
Rhinoceros gall, when applied, reveals the strange dispositions of drugs.
If a salmon is inserted into a tree, the tree withers at once;
But if dog’s gall is applied to the wound, or the spot is irrigated with dog’s bile, the tree revives as before, flourishing anew.

*Wu-ming-yi*, the "nameless strange," resembles jade willow powder or lime, yet its taste is uniquely sharp. It severs a finger as if removing nail and hair.
The sacred stone restores sight to the blind, brightening the eyes as clouds part from the sun.

*Dang-gui* stanches bleeding or breaks up blood stasis—its head and tail yield opposite effects:
The head stanches bleeding, while the tail breaks up blood.
*Bo-zi*, when raw, induces sleep; when cooked, it dispels insomnia.

A worn-out mat soaked in brine, if used to wipe rice, can neutralize saltiness.
Like wine that mingles upon contact—
Now, honey roots entwine branches, and a hundred intertwined limbs emerge.

Iron meets the divine shatterer and turns soft as mud or powder;
Stone touched by crane’s droppings crumbles into flying dust.
Autumn’s citrus blossoms resemble marrow.

Broken strings and snapped swords, when anointed with *luan*-bird blood, mend as before;
If refined with blood into glue, the fractured iron never breaks again.
When seas run dry and rivers parch, cast in the *fang-bo* swallow—waves rise at once.

To make lead resist fire, one must rely on *xiu-tian*;
Now called "heaven-mending stone."
For unyielding form, how could one forget the purple-backed?

There is a purple-backed *tian-kui*, like the common edible mallow, but with a purple underside and green surface—it firms lead’s form.
To anchor the base and steady the crucible, all depends on *zong-xin*.

There is also *zong-xin* grass, now called *shi-zhu* (not the edible kind—beware of confusion).
This herb grows in Qinzhou, where beasts and insects abound.
When the female plant meets *qin*-flower, the herb is called *li-qi*, its form like peony, its blossoms green, growing up to three feet tall, with yellow-spotted leaves, bitter and astringent in taste—useful for boiling *ci-huang* to withstand fire.

Instantly it becomes *geng*;
When roasted with *chi-xu*—this herb is called *chi-xu*, now known as tiger-whisker grass—it boils *que-sha* to produce fire’s proof.

Water sustains the golden crucible.
Fire in water arises from none but *hua-sui*:
In the sea dwells a beast called *ri-jing*; its marrow, placed in oil, when the oil touches water, ignites an inextinguishable flame—only wine can quench it, and it must be stored beneath a roof.

To regrow lost teeth, rely on the powder of a male rat’s spine.
If teeth break and fail to regrow for years, take the spine of a male rat, grind it to powder, and rub it on the break—teeth regrow as before.

Such are the hundredfold virtues of medicinal remedies.
Though I have humbly encountered this enlightened age and presumptuously studied the principles of medicine,
though I have sought the sagely methods, their subtleties remain difficult to exhaust.
Here I briefly set forth the efficacies of medicinal foods—how could this encompass the essential safeguards of the immortals?
As for the methods of preparation—steaming, boiling, decocting, and roasting—how could one record them all by year and month?
To thoroughly examine their origins, one must consult the comprehensive compendia.

Undeterred by my limited insight, I have directly recorded the methods of steaming, boiling, decocting, and roasting,
compiled the preparations of medicinal remedies, and divided them into three scrolls—upper, middle, and lower—comprising three hundred entries, as presented below.

When a formula states "pills the size of fine sesame seeds," use the weight of four *liang* of carp eyes for comparison.
When it states "the size of large sesame seeds," use the weight of six *liang* of carp eyes.
When it states "the size of small beans," use the weight of eight *liang* of carp eyes.
When it states "the size of large beans," use the weight of ten *liang* of carp eyes.
When it states "the size of rabbit droppings (commonly called rabbit feces)," use the weight of twelve *liang* of carp eyes.
When it states "the size of *wu-tong* seeds," use the weight of fourteen *liang* of carp eyes.
When it states "the size of pellets," use the weight of sixteen *liang* of carp eyes.
Fifteen white pearls serve as the standard for one pellet.

When a formula states "one *yi* of water," up to "ten *yi*," each *yi* is weighed at twelve *liang*.

When a formula states "one *liang*, one *fen*, one *zhu*," use the modern silk-and-cotton scale.
Do not mistakenly take four *zhu* as one *fen*; errors will impair the remedy’s efficacy.

When a formula states "powder," prepare it only as a powder; when it states "pills," prepare them only as pills.
Whether decocted in wine, vinegar, or milk, the method must not be altered.

When refining honey for a formula, each *jin* should yield twelve and a half *liang* or slightly more.
If the fire is insufficient or excessive, the honey cannot be used.

When using fat in ointments, first refine it to remove membranes before use.

In preparing all medicinal substances, one must remain single-minded, avoiding admixture.
Whether first steaming then boiling or first boiling then steaming, the order must not be altered—follow the method precisely.

When compounding pills, if honey is specified, use only honey; if malt sugar is specified, use only malt sugar; if sugar is specified, use only sugar.
Do not mix them, lest they induce purgation.

The Imperial Medical Assistant Instructor of the Song Dynasty, Xu Hong, collated and corrected the text.

**General Preface to the Expanded Exegesis, Preface to the First Scroll**

Heaven and Earth regard generation and completion as their virtue, and among all that lives, nothing is more precious than the body. The body takes peace and joy as its foundation, and what brings joy is rooted in nurturing and preservation. If people truly attend to this root, it will surely be firm; once the root is firm, how could illness arise? How could premature death occur? Thus, the Way of nurturing life reaches no further than this.

Even plants and trees, though devoid of consciousness, still rely on irrigation and nourishment. How much more should humans, the most intelligent of all beings, depend on nurturing and preservation? Yet the principles of nurturing and preservation are manifold. To summarize, there are three methods: first, cultivating the spirit; second, cherishing qi; and third, preventing illness.

Let go of emotions and abandon cunning, embrace tranquility and emptiness, detach from worldly affairs to preserve authenticity, and remain unburdened within and without. In this way, the spirit will not be internally depleted, external circumstances will not cause confusion, and the true unity will remain unadulterated—thus, the spirit finds peace. This is cultivating the spirit.

Embrace the root of the primordial One, secure the true qi of essence and vitality, stabilize the three burners, forget the six thieves, empty the realm of perception, and harmonize with the Great Unity—thus, qi naturally stabilizes. This is cherishing qi.

Eat and drink at appropriate times, regulate warmth and cold with moderation, avoid the eight pathogenic factors in one’s conduct, and neither force wakefulness nor sleep—thus, the body naturally finds peace. This is preventing illness.

These three methods are easy to practice, yet people deem them difficult and refuse to follow them. Even with methods for longevity, few devote themselves to them, leading to eternal departure. As a result, illnesses assail, and the harmony of heaven is suddenly lost. The sages, moved by compassion, thus provided techniques for preservation and salvation, supplemented by medicines for healing, so that all beings—whether enlightened or not—may attain the realm of longevity.

Therefore, the state compiled the *Sagely Benevolence*, collated and corrected the *Plain Questions*, reissued the *Materia Medica*, and separately produced the *Illustrated Classic*. Works such as Zhang Zhongjing’s *Treatise on Cold Damage*, the *Thousand Gold Pieces*, the *Golden Cabinet*, and the *Outer Terrace* are all collected in the imperial archives. Now, the court has once more gathered physicians from across the land, appointed them to official positions, and assigned them to bureaus to universally relieve the suffering of the people. This is the perfect virtue of the sagely ruler, embodying the utmost benevolence of Heaven and Earth, shouldering the great responsibility of the world. Thus, no medicinal herbs are left uncultivated in the wild, and no diseases remain unrecognized in the world.

However, the two *Materia Medica* texts contain discrepancies among their compilers, some of whom adhered to personal biases, leading to inaccuracies in their assessments. This has left scholars perplexed when consulting them. Now, we have examined the theories of various schools, verified them against facts, and adopted those that fully realize their principles to perfect their reasoning—such as earth from the eastern wall, reversed-flow water, and winter ash. For ambiguous cases, we have clarified them to reveal their true nature—such as water passing beneath chrysanthemums becoming fragrant, or the urine of shadow rats falling to the ground and producing offspring. For textual errors or omissions, we have corrected them to elucidate their meaning—such as stone springs and stone honey. For names altered due to taboos, we have restored their original forms—such as *shanyao* (山药), which avoided the Song imperial taboo, and *ji* (岌), which avoided the taboo of Emperor Daizong of Tang.

Thus, right and wrong are unified, treatments have a source, and when consulting or applying them, all becomes clear and free of confusion. For over a decade, we have sought, inquired, and gathered, collecting the best methods, diagnosing and treating illnesses, and perfecting the arts of harmonizing and storing medicines. Illness is what the sages took most seriously; without constancy, one cannot be a physician—how could this be spoken of lightly?

I, Zongshi, have often said: what one relies on for illness is the physician; what the physician depends on is the formula; and what the formula relies on is the medicine. If one understands the deficiency or excess of an illness and the suitability of a formula but cannot grasp the properties of medicines—whether beneficial or toxic—nor discern the timing of their application, then truth and falsehood become entangled, the new and the old are confused. How, then, can one dispel the ancient *gu* poison from the Daoist of the Chen dynasty, as when Zhen Liyan of the Tang, serving as Attending Secretary, skillfully treated a Daoist suffering from abdominal fullness and vexation for two years? Upon diagnosis, he declared: "There is *gu* in your abdomen, caused by mistakenly ingesting hair." He prescribed a dose of realgar, and shortly after, the Daoist vomited a thumb-sized snake without eyes. When burned, it emitted the odor of hair, and he was cured. Or how can one restore the teeth of Zhang Guolao, which had fallen out in pairs? When Emperor Xuanzong of Tang summoned Zhang Guo and said to Gao Lishi: "I have heard that one who drinks aconite without suffering is an extraordinary person," the weather was cold. Zhang Guo was offered a drink, which he consumed three times before declaring with disdain: "This is not fine wine," and then retired.

---

When the teeth appeared scorched and shrunken, he turned to his attendants, took up an iron ruyi, and struck them out, concealing them in his sash. Then he produced a medicine and applied it to his gums. After a long while, his teeth regrew, lustrous and perfectly paired, leaving the emperor in greater awe. It was with this intent that this work was composed.

Now compiled into a book, it follows the categorical examples of the two *Jing* texts, dividing entries by section and elaborating on the prefaces and principles across three volumes. Those with unused names or exhausted meanings are omitted. The catalogues of *Shennong’s Classic of Materia Medica*, *Mingyi Bielu*, Tang-era supplements, recent additions, new supplements, and newly revised entries—though listed in the *Classic*’s table of contents—are not reiterated here. The work remains in twenty volumes, with one volume for the table of contents, titled *Amplified Materia Medica*.

Should scholars of broad compassion and health share this purpose, they may further refine it to reflect the sagely dynasty’s virtue of cherishing life. Recorded in the sixth year of the Zhenghe reign, the bingshen year.

The term *materia medica* originated with the Yellow Emperor and Qi Bo. The *Supplementary Annotations* states that the old account credits *Shennong’s Classic of Materia Medica* to Shennong, though it lacks evidential basis. The *Annals of Emperors* records that in the fifth year of the Yuanshi era, those across the land versed in formulas, medicine, and *materia medica* were summoned to the capital. Yet this only confirms the name *materia medica*, not its era of origin. The *Biography of Lou Hu* mentions that in his youth, Hu recited medical classics, *materia medica*, and formulas totaling hundreds of thousands of words—here, too, the term *materia medica* merely appears, without substantiation.

The *Genealogies of Clans* states: "Shennong tasted hundreds of herbs to harmonize medicines and aid people," yet it does not mention *materia medica*. None of these accounts fully clarify the matter. Upon reading the *Annals of Emperors and Kings*, one finds: "The Yellow Emperor commanded Qi Bo to taste herbs and plants, establish the *Classic of Materia Medica*, and devise medical formulas to treat the people’s illnesses." Thus, the term *materia medica* indeed began with the Yellow Emperor and Qi Bo. The *Huainanzi* likewise speaks of Shennong tasting the flavors of hundreds of herbs and encountering seventy poisons in a single day, yet makes no mention of *materia medica*.

From this, we know the work arose from the innate wisdom of ancient sages, who discerned the properties and flavors of all things under heaven and matched them to the illnesses of the age. Later wise scholars expanded its entries, reaching 1,812 names. The *Supplementary Annotated Materia Medica* lists 1,812 kinds, though some entries serve dual or triple purposes, and the term *kind* is aptly used. The work may be called comprehensive. Yet its annotations often fall short, and some stray from reason to pursue other ends.

Thus, I have gathered and expanded upon these residual meanings, striving for precision—not to fully elucidate the intentions of the sages, but in hope of remedying uncertainties.

When heaven and earth were sundered, the myriad things were born from the Five Qi alone. Once the Five Qi settled into their positions, the Five Flavors arose; from the Five Flavors, a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes emerge, reaching the inexhaustible. Hence it is said: that which gives life is qi; that which completes it is flavor. Born from the odd, it is perfected in the even; born from the even, it is perfected in the odd.

Cold qi hardens, so its flavor may be used to soften. Heat qi softens, so its flavor may be used to harden. Wind qi disperses, so its flavor may be used to astringe. Dry qi astringes, so its flavor may be used to disperse. Earth is where the harmonizing qi arises; harmonizing qi accords with all things, so its flavor may be used to moderate.

Qi that hardens strengthens, so bitterness can nourish qi. Vessels that soften harmonize, so saltiness can nourish the vessels. Bones that astringe grow strong, so sourness can nourish the bones. Sinews that disperse do not spasm, so acridity can nourish the sinews. Flesh that moderates does not congest, so sweetness can nourish the flesh.

To soften, first harden; to disperse, first astringe. When moderation is desired, use sweetness; when undesired, do not. Yet overuse brings illness. The ancients who cultivated life and treated illness necessarily first mastered this principle. Those who do not master it yet cure others’ illnesses are rare indeed.

The Dao of safe medicinal use lies in those who know how to preserve and nourish. Moreover, medicines that summon harmonious qi are few, while those that attack and deplete are many—this cannot be overlooked. Thus we know that human life must rely on preservation; without offending harmonious qi, one sustains life. The moment care is neglected, illness arises. If treatment is misapplied, collapse soon follows.

Preventing harm requires vigilance in times of ease, for "in peace, forget not danger; in existence, forget not perishing"—this is the sage’s prior warning. The Dao of nurturing life lies in nothing so much as guarding the center; guarding the center averts the harms of excess and deficiency.

The *Classic* states: "Spring, autumn, winter, summer—the yin and yang of the four seasons—give rise to illness through overuse." For to act contrary to one’s nature and force pursuit of desires is to invite illness. The five viscera receive qi in fixed measure; overuse and depletion breed disease.

Those skilled in nurturing life avoid the ills of depletion while preserving their true origin—what harm could external pathogens then inflict? Thus, skill in taking medicine is inferior to skill in preservation; lack of skill in preservation is inferior to skill in taking medicine.

Yet the world abounds with those unskilled in preservation and unskilled in medicine, who, when illness strikes suddenly, blame the heavens. Alas! They have not reflected—can they not be cautious?

Those who have not heard the Dao let their minds run wild, acting contrary to the joys of life. They exhaust their essence and spirit in pursuit of cunning and skill; they wear themselves out with anxieties and fears over gains and losses; they toil and suffer in adherence to rites and decorum; they sacrifice their lives and worldly affairs for wealth and profit. These four relentless pursuits sicken the heart.

Straining the body to its limits, stirring the qi into reckless disorder, exposing oneself to wind while indulging in wine, and craving pungent and salty flavors—these injure the liver. Consuming raw and cold foods, failing to regulate warmth and chill, sitting for long periods, staying outdoors too long, overeating or starving—these harm the spleen. Excessive shouting, quarreling, and forced conversation, reckless exposure to cold and heat, and overindulgence in salty and bitter tastes—these damage the lungs. Sitting on damp ground for too long, forcing oneself into water, indulging desires to the point of physical exhaustion, and draining the Three Fields—these afflict the kidneys.

Once the five illnesses arise, one grows frail before old age, falls ill before emaciation, and when illness strikes, it is severe; severe illness leads inevitably to death. Alas! These are all self-inflicted through thoughtlessness. Those who guard their health must carefully avoid these five pitfalls to live a life free from suffering. The *Classic* states: "Do not treat the already ill; treat the not yet ill." This is precisely its meaning.

Those skilled in nurturing life cultivate the internal; the unskilled nurture the external. Nurturing the external fills the outer self, seeking only to satisfy fleeting pleasures, lusts, and desires. Little do they know that filling the external empties the internal. Those who skillfully nurture the internal strengthen it, ensuring the viscera are at peace, the Three Burners each hold their place, and food and drink are always taken in proper measure.

Thus, Zhuang Zhou said: "What is most to be feared in human life lies in the matters of bed and board, and those who fail to guard against them err." If one could always remain so cautious, how could illness arise? How could longevity not be long? The wise awaken upon seeing the body’s form; the foolish remain ignorant even in illness. Truly, this is cause for fear.

Tender passions are hard to restrain and harder still to sever—one cannot but employ wisdom to curb them. Thus, one must distance oneself from seductive influences. These words are simple and near, yet their practice is most difficult, for human wisdom is shallow and cannot overcome greed. Thus, the Buddhist scriptures say: "All suffering arises from craving; if craving is extinguished, what suffering can remain?" Know this: if craving is not extinguished, suffering will not end; if craving ends, suffering ends. The words of the sages are near, yet their meaning is profound—one cannot but reflect and take heed.

Those who skillfully preserve life do not tax their spirit or weary their form. When spirit and form are at peace, how can misfortune arise? Human life is rooted in qi and blood; no illness arises without first damaging them.

In the world, there are young men and women who harbor obsessive thoughts, overindulging in worry and reflection, often leading to consumptive depletion. In men, the spirit and complexion scatter first; in women, the monthly flow ceases first. Why does this happen? Sorrow, worry, and overthinking injure the heart; when the heart is injured, the blood reverses and depletes. With blood reversed and depleted, the spirit and complexion scatter first, and the monthly flow ceases. Once fire is afflicted, it cannot nourish its child, so there is no appetite. With the spleen weakened, the metal qi declines, giving rise to coughing. Once coughing begins, the water qi is cut off, so the limbs wither. With the wood qi unfulfilled, there is much anger, the temples turn gray, and the sinews atrophy. When the five viscera have transmitted the illness in full, death does not come suddenly—yet it comes all the same.

This form of consumption is the most difficult to treat among all such ailments, for the illness arises within the five viscera with no end in sight, and medicine cannot reach it. If one can change one’s mindset and use medicine to support recovery, there may yet be a one-in-nine chance of survival. Taking this as an example, the other consumptive illnesses can be treated by examining the pulse and symptoms.

In treating illness, there are eight essentials. If these eight are not carefully considered, the illness cannot be cured—not because the illness cannot be cured, but because there is no proper means to cure it. Thus, one must scrutinize the eight essentials to avoid error:

1. **Deficiency**: The five deficiencies—fine pulse, cold skin, scant qi, diarrhea, and inability to eat.
2. **Excess**: The five excesses—full pulse, hot skin, abdominal distension, constipation or urinary blockage, and mental confusion.
3. **Cold**: Accumulated cold in the viscera.
4. **Heat**: Accumulated heat in the viscera.
5. **Evil**: Illness not originating in the viscera themselves.
6. **Proper**: Illness not caused by external evil.
7. **Internal**: Illness not located externally.
8. **External**: Illness not located internally.

Once these eight essentials are examined, cross-referenced with the six pulses, and the origin of the illness assessed, then applying observation, listening, inquiry, and palpation to the patient—what illness could not be treated?

There are six errors that render illness incurable:
1. Failure to examine carefully.
2. Lack of trust.
3. Delay in treatment.
4. Failure to choose a skilled physician.
5. Failure to recognize the illness.
6. Failure to understand the medicine.

If even one of these six errors occurs, the illness becomes difficult to treat—not solely the physician’s fault, but also the patient’s.

Moreover, if the physician lacks compassion and the patient is suspicious and contemptuous, with these two principles at odds, what benefit can there be for the illness? Thus, the physician must be compassionate; without compassion, misfortune follows. The patient must not be suspicious or contemptuous; suspicion and contempt invite misfortune. Only the wise understand the nature of things and each finds peace—this, too, is a principle of healing.

In the section on *Methods for Combining Medicines and Measuring Ingredients*, it states: "When a formula calls for one *chi* of cinnamon, peel it completely, and the proper weight is half an ounce." Once prepared, if the text is broad and does not specify narrow measures, how can half an ounce be taken as the standard? Moreover, cinnamon *is* the bark—if one peels it completely, there is no cinnamon left.

Here follows the translation:

---

Now, if we define a length of one *chi* and a width of one *cun*, and peel away the rough, hollow, and flavorless outer bark, the weight approximates half an ounce. Yet the original intent of using one *chi* of cinnamon remains unclear—this, too, is an oversight of earlier scholars.

In the *Preface and Examples*, it states that medicines possess the five flavors—sour, salty, sweet, bitter, and acrid—and the four *qi*: cold, hot, warm, and cool. Upon closer examination: when the term *qi* is used, it refers to the fragrance or odor of the substance; the cold, hot, warm, and cool qualities, however, pertain to the nature of the medicine. For instance, the *Goose Treatise* states: "White goose fat is of a cold nature," meaning its *qi* is cold. Moreover, medicines inherently possess their own natures. When discussing the four *qi*, these refer to fragrance, foulness, pungency, and fishiness—thus, they cannot be equated with cold, hot, warm, or cool. For example:
- Garlic, asafoetida, abalone, and sweaty saddles emit a foul *qi*;
- Parrot, fish, duck, and snake emit a fishy *qi*;
- Kidney, fox, white horse penis, the root near hidden parts, and *renzhongbai* emit a pungent *qi*;
- Aloeswood, sandalwood, dragon’s blood, and musk emit a fragrant *qi*.

Only in such cases can the term *qi* be appropriately applied. The character *qi* in the *Preface and Examples* was likely a later scribal error and should be amended to *nature* to accord with the meaning.

Today, when using croton seeds, all remove the oil and use them raw. This must be because the *Shennong’s Classic of Materia Medica* states they are warm when raw and cold when cooked, so one seeks to avoid coldness in favor of warmth. Yet the coldness is not what should be avoided—rather, one must avoid its great toxicity. Moreover, the *Classic* makes no mention of removing the oil. Tao Hongjing said: "Stir-fry until yellow-black, though this may be excessive." *Rihuazi* states: "Stir-frying is inferior to removing the heart and membrane; boiling five times, changing the water each time and boiling once per change, is best." As for apricot kernels, peach kernels, *caowu*, and sesame seeds, there is no need to stir-fry them until black—simply roast them over a slow fire until reddish-yellow, and that suffices.

Regarding the dosage of medicines, though there is a saying that for a single toxic substance, one should take a pill the size of a small hemp seed, this requires further consideration. For people’s *qi* varies in strength and weakness, ages differ between old and young, illnesses vary in duration, and medicines differ in toxicity—each case must be weighed individually, and this rule cannot be universally applied. All such examples set by the ancients are hypothetical; how can they be rigidly taken as fixed laws?

The first *Preface and Examples* of the *Materia Medica* states that rhinoceros horn, antelope horn, and deer antler should be ground into powder and added to the decoction just before consumption. Yet in past and present pharmaceutical methods, some grind them raw, while others decoct them to extract their juice. Furthermore, when using beeswax in pills, it serves to preserve the medicine’s aroma, flavor, and potency, ensuring it passes through the gates of the diaphragm to take effect. If one mixes it with honey instead, though the pills may form more easily, they will dissolve too quickly upon swallowing—how can they reach the viscera? If the medicine is toxic, it may then cause illness, not only failing to benefit but also harming the patient, entirely defeating the purpose of using wax.

As for *guixin* (cinnamon heart), does the superior grade have soft, flaky bark that can be scraped away? Such matters require further careful investigation.

Today, when using ephedra, people often pound it together with other medicines. In Zhang Zhongjing’s formulas, however, it is always instructed to remove the froth from the top. The *Preface and Examples* states: "First decoct it separately for three or two boils, skim off the froth, then add water to the original volume before adding the remaining ingredients—otherwise, it will cause vexation." This is the proper way to use ephedra, and physicians should adhere to this method. It also says: "Break off the nodes, ensure the grain is unobstructed, and cut into inch-long pieces." Yet cutting into inch-long pieces is inferior to crushing it to the size of soybeans, as this allows the medicinal properties to release more readily and fully.

Tao Hongjing said: "Medicines have the ten properties of dispersing, unblocking, supplementing, draining, lightness, heaviness, astringency, slipperiness, dryness, and dampness." Upon examination, only the two properties of cold and heat are missing. For example:
- Cold can dispel heat, as with rhubarb and mirabilite;
- Heat can dispel cold, as with aconite and cinnamon.

Here, I specifically add these two properties to complete the meaning.

---

Human life is but the convergence of yin and yang qi. If one cannot harmonize these, life is harmed. Thus, the *Baoming Quanxing Pian* states: "Humans are born of the qi of Heaven and Earth." It also says: "When Heaven and Earth unite their qi, this is called human." Therefore, yang transforms qi, while yin forms shape. The wandering soul undergoes change—this is yang transforming qi. Essence and qi become things—this is yin forming shape. When yin and yang qi unite, spirit resides within. Hence, the *Yinyang Yingxiang Dalun* states: "The movement and stillness of Heaven and Earth are governed by the luminous spirit." Thus, the luminous spirit cannot be subsumed under yin and yang. The *Book of Changes* speaks of "the unfathomable of yin and yang as the spirit" precisely for this reason. Therefore, it is said: "The spirit cannot be overused, for overuse leads to exhaustion; the body cannot be overtaxed, for overtaxation leads to ruin." From this, we know that essence, qi, and spirit are the great foundations of human life and must be carefully nurtured. The wise cultivate their spirit, cherish their qi, and thereby secure their foundation.

Yet in the world, there are those who do not carefully observe the principles of health preservation, and their every action violates them. Having transgressed the prohibitions of nurturing life, they must rely on external arts to preserve and rescue themselves—one cannot simply await death. Thus, the *Materia Medica* arose. Once the principles of preservation and rescue are understood, one cannot but exhaust their methods, and so the *Yanyi* is preserved. Though their names differ, their principles are nearly the same. The intent is to guide both the knowledgeable and the ignorant to the realm of longevity, leading all to the land of peace and happiness. Those who seek this intent may find it in the intent itself.

The Way of nurturing the heart must not be neglected. The six desires and seven emotions undergo a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, emerging and vanishing unpredictably. Their words are most simple, yet their meanings are boundless. To confront boundless affairs with a single heart—is this not laborious? If the heart is not clear, there has never been one who was not afflicted by external things. Thus, the enlightened and discerning ultimately forget the heart. Once the heart is forgotten, the six desires and seven emotions can do nothing. When the six desires and seven emotions can do nothing, internal affairs do not arise. When internal affairs do not arise, external calamities cannot enter. When external calamities cannot enter, the use of *materia medica* becomes as insignificant as straw dogs in a flourishing age.

If one has not yet attained this understanding and reached this state, there has never been one who did not stir the six desires and seven emotions to incite worry and suffering. Once worry and suffering arise, this book becomes indispensable for even a single day. Who am I to presume to eliminate the worries and sufferings of others through this text?

Tao Hongjing further states: After sifting and preparing pills and powders, one should combine them in a mortar and pound them several hundred times with a pestle. However, if the dry powder is too fine to be pounded, it is better to have a strong person grind it thoroughly. He also says: For decoctions, wines, and ointments using various stones, one should pound them finely like millet grains, or sift them through kudzu cloth to ensure even mixing, and wrap them in silk before placing them in the preparation. Minerals like realgar and cinnabar should be ground into fine powder.

Upon examination: Though stones are used in decoctions and wines, they must still be somewhat finely ground for the medicinal properties to fully release and the effects to manifest quickly. However, before consumption, the liquid should be strained and then reheated; otherwise, the medicinal potency may be lost and the effect diminished. This is somewhat acceptable for decoctions and wines, but for medicinal pastes, how could one leave them as coarse as millet grains? This example should not be rigidly applied—one must exercise careful judgment based on the circumstances.

He further discusses the terms *chuijǔ* (吹咀): The Tang *Bencao* annotates this as "deliberation and consideration," which is incorrect. The *Jiayou* edition follows Tao Hongjing’s interpretation of "fine cutting," which is also incorrect. Confucian scholars hold that it implies the blending of flavors, as when one chews with the mouth—though broken, it does not become dust, merely allowing the flavors to be contained. Many of Zhang Zhongjing’s formulas use *chuijǔ* in this sense.

There are patients who, though ignorant of medicine, insist on making their own conjectures, leading to a ninety percent mortality rate. Or there are physicians who fail to recognize the illness or are compelled by wealth and power to forcibly impose treatment—both physicians and patients must be wary of such cases. The key lies in having sagacious and discerning individuals oversee the matter, so that illnesses are invariably cured and medicine invariably effective.

Such instances are common in the world, and thus each must be comprehensively addressed to prevent potential errors.

People differ in status, age, and youth, and their illnesses must be treated accordingly. Illnesses vary in duration, deficiency, and excess, and the principles demand different remedies. Just as human hearts are like faces—each unique—so too are their viscera distinct. With such differences in the viscera, how can a single medicine treat the illnesses of many? Thus, Zhang Zhongjing says: "Moreover, the land varies in elevation, the nature of things differs in hardness and softness, and diets and dwellings are not the same." Therefore, the Yellow Emperor posed questions about the four directions, and Qi Bo expounded on the four methods of treatment. The efficacy of treating illness requires careful consideration of both. To rely on formulas and prepare medicines uniformly is indeed careless.

Take, for example, the wealthy and powerful: their bodies are at ease, but their minds are burdened. When clothing and food are abundant, the body is at ease, but excessive thought burdens the mind. Qi Bo says: "Illness arises in the vessels. When the body is at ease, the exterior is replete; when the mind is burdened, the interior is deficient—thus illness arises in the vessels." Their nurturing differs from that of the poor and lowly, and their worries, joys, and thoughts are not the same. Each must be treated according to their individual condition. Later physicians have entirely neglected this principle, and the losses are grave.

Once, during the summer, a medical official was drinking with a nobleman. The nobleman said: "Yesterday, I overindulged in food and drink, and today my digestion is impaired." The physician replied: "You should take a digestive remedy. Others would take ten pills, but you should reduce the dose by half." No sooner had the medicine been swallowed than the nobleman’s bowels loosened uncontrollably, nearly proving fatal.

Comparing these cases, deficiency and excess are vastly different—one cannot afford not to examine them carefully. Thus, illness must be treated according to its specific nature.

Another case: in summer, a man suffered from bloody dysentery. A physician recklessly prescribed cold-natured medicines in opposition to the condition, relying solely on coptis, donkey-hide gelatin, and costusroot. Such remedies might have been suitable at the onset of illness, but now, with the intestines weakened from prolonged disease, they were contraindicated. After more than ten days, the patient nearly collapsed from exhaustion. Thus, treatment must be tailored to the medicine’s appropriateness.

From these examples, it is clear that a physician’s adaptability is paramount. Experience, too, is essential—only then can one achieve infallibility. The cases cited serve as models; others may follow suit.

When prescribing medicines, one must select those suited to the local climate and terrain, for only then will their potency be fully realized and their use well-founded. Examples include ginseng from Shangdang, Chinese angelica from Sichuan, pinellia from Qizhou, and asarum from Huazhou. Even seemingly insignificant substances—such as earth from an eastern wall, winter ashes, water from a half-sky river, hot water, or fermented water—have extensive applications, each governed by its own principles. Without investigating these principles, treating illness becomes a futile endeavor, and lives cannot be saved.

The intentions of the sages and worthies are not easily fully grasped, yet what else can one seek if not principle?

People, whether young, mature, or elderly, pass through three stages in the vigor of their qi and blood: flourishing, robust, and declining. As the *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon* states: "The qi of lesser fire is vigorous; the qi of greater fire is enfeebled." For lesser fire generates qi, while greater fire dissipates it—how much more so with declining fire, which one must not fail to recognize.

Thus, treatment must also be divided into three corresponding methods. For the young, daily medicinal tonics may be administered, but during the robust and elderly stages, these must be adjusted accordingly. This distinction must never be overlooked. Those who neglect this principle often dismiss it, only to find themselves in dire straits. How lamentable!

Here is the translation:

Why do modern physicians often find *Li Zhong Tang* and *Li Zhong Wan* ineffective in emergencies? This stems from a failure to grasp Master Zhang Zhongjing’s intent—that such remedies are infallible only when applied correctly, for the skill of the prescriber varies. For instance, in treating chest impediment with heart oppression, firm glomus, qi binding the chest, and fullness with counterflow qi surging into the heart, *Zhi Zhong Yang* governs the case. Equal parts of ginseng, atractylodes, dried ginger, and licorice—twelve *liang* in total—are decocted in eight *sheng* of water to yield three *sheng*, taken in one-*sheng* doses thrice daily until improvement. Alternatively, the formula may be prepared as pills the size of a chicken’s egg yolk, both yielding remarkable efficacy. Yet today, physicians administer pills no larger than a bayberry, and when the illness persists, they dismiss the remedy as inefficacious. The fault lies not with the medicine but with its prescriber. This example serves as a model; others may follow suit. However, for the elderly or those constitutionally deficient and cold, licorice should be reduced as appropriate.

A skilled physician must stock remedies for emergencies, lest they prove unavailable when needed. Such medicines include *sangjisheng*, *sangpiaoxiao*, deerhorn glue, *tianlinggai*, tiger gall, toad venom, wild camel’s marrow, fireflies, *penglei*, *kongqing*, *posuo* stone, stone crabs, winter ash, preserved snow water, pine pollen, and many others too numerous to list.

During the Tang dynasty, Yuan Dan (styled Xingchong) once told Di Renjie: “The relationship of subordinates to superiors is like a wealthy household storing provisions for self-sufficiency. Cured meats, dried delicacies, fine grains, and rich broths nourish the body, while ginseng, atractylodes, *lingzhi*, and cinnamon ward off illness. Your household abounds in such luxuries—might I, a humble man, be counted among your remedies?” Renjie laughed and replied, “You are precisely the remedy in my medicine chest, one I cannot do without for a single day.” Though Liang Gong spoke in jest, his analogy of medicine underscores its indispensability among all things under heaven. Those who grasp the Dao understand this principle.

A physician must possess a broad knowledge of past and present, uphold benevolence and righteousness, abandon the pursuit of vainglory, and devote himself wholeheartedly to healing. Only then will his mind grow clear, and spiritual forces align to assist him. Why, then, should he fret over fame or profit? Without such virtues, how can he avoid the shame of Jiang Fu, who sought empty praise, or the fate of Hua Tuo, who was executed for his arrogance?

I once read in the *Tang Dynasty Biographies of Physicians and Technicians*: “The essence of medicine lies in pulse diagnosis, and the key is to attack the illness with a single remedy, for pure qi yields swift recovery. If one remedy is chosen by chance while others counteract it, the treatment cannot act with full force—this is why some illnesses are difficult to cure.” Upon reflection, however, diseases vary in severity, duration, deficiency, and excess. How can a single remedy suffice? For recent, minor ailments, it may suffice, but for long-standing, complex, or vacillating conditions, how can one forgo auxiliary medicines? Take sulfur, for example: though known for its intense heat, its mineral nature acts slowly, and it may not take effect immediately upon ingestion. Thus, the wise combine it with aconite, dried ginger, or cinnamon to enhance its potency, uniting their forces to attack the illness and achieve rapid results. Could sulfur alone achieve this? Hence, Xu Sisong’s claim cannot be fully trusted; the discerning must weigh it carefully.

Administering medicine is like administering punishment: an error in judgment may cost a life. A single misstep in treatment can mean the difference between life and death. Yet while the legal system employs investigators to examine evidence, deliberate, and record verdicts before execution—since a life, once lost, cannot be restored—physicians today often prescribe remedies upon first seeing a patient. If the physician is skilled, discerns the illness, and matches the medicine precisely, the treatment may succeed immediately. But if he is mediocre and prescribes recklessly, the patient may swiftly decline. Such negligence makes killing all too easy! Such cases abound in the world, largely because patients fail to choose their physicians wisely and have not studied medicine themselves. Is this not cause for alarm?

**Section on Women’s Medicine**
Though gynecology is a distinct specialty, even its practitioners cannot fully master the sagely methods. Today, wealthy households confine their women to inner chambers behind layered curtains, their arms bound in silk, preventing physicians from observing their complexion or palpating their pulses with precision. Thus, two of the four diagnostic methods are already compromised. The *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon* states: “In treating illness, observe the patient’s form, qi, and complexion. If form and qi are harmonious, recovery is possible; if the complexion is lustrous and floating, the illness is easily cured. If form and qi are discordant, the condition is difficult to treat; if the complexion is dull and lifeless, recovery is unlikely.” It further states: “The way of diagnosis lies in assessing a person’s courage or timidity, their bones, flesh, and skin, to discern their true condition.” If a patient’s pulse and symptoms do not align, and the physician cannot see their form, how can he prescribe based solely on the pulse? By this reasoning, how can medicine be fully practiced?

This is a universal challenge in medicine, yet the world has not rectified it. Physicians cannot avoid thorough questioning, but when patients find the inquiries excessive, they dismiss the physician as incompetent and often refuse the prescribed medicine. Bian Que, upon seeing the Marquis of Qi’s complexion, was still met with disbelief—how much more so for those he could not see? Alas, how difficult it is!

Moreover, there was a woman who had suffered from a warm disease for twelve days. Upon examination, her pulse arrived six or seven times per breath, rough and uneven, with the inch pulse slightly surging and the cubit pulse slightly diminished. She experienced alternating chills and fever, flushed cheeks, dry mouth, mental confusion, and deafness. Upon inquiry, it was learned that several days after the onset of her illness, her menstrual blood had flowed—this indicated heat from the Lesser Yang entering the blood chamber. If treated incorrectly, she would surely die. Thus, her symptoms were carefully assessed, and she was given Minor Bupleurum Decoction. After two days, she was administered Minor Bupleurum Decoction combined with Cinnamon Twig and Dried Ginger Decoction, and within a day, her chills and fever subsided.

She then reported, “I feel acute pain below my navel.” She was given Resistant Decoction Pill, which induced mild diarrhea, and the pain below her navel resolved. Her body gradually regained warmth, her pulse became more even, yet she remained mentally unclear. She was again given Minor Bupleurum Decoction. The next day, she said, “I only feel heat and dryness in my chest, with dry mouth and nose.” A small dose of Regulate the Stomach and Support Qi Decoction was administered, but no diarrhea occurred. The following day, she complained of pain below the heart. She was given half a dose of Major Sinking into the Chest Pill, which induced three bouts of diarrhea. The next day, she experienced restless vexation, occasional visual hallucinations, and intermittent delirious speech.

Though it was known that dry stool remained, given her extreme deficiency, purging was not dared. Instead, she was given Bamboo Leaf Decoction to clear her vexing heat. That night, her stool passed naturally twice by dawn, including several pieces of dry stool. Her delirious speech and restless vexation fully resolved, but she developed a cough with sputum—this was due to lung deficiency. If left untreated, it was feared that vacuity would take hold and lead to lung atrophy. Thus, she was given Minor Bupleurum Decoction with ginseng, jujube, and fresh ginger removed, and dried ginger and schisandra fruit added. After one day, her cough lessened, and by the second day, her illness was entirely cured. All the above treatments employed Zhang Zhongjing’s formulas.

There was a woman suffering from vomiting and counterflow, with neither stool nor urine passing, vexation and disorientation, cold limbs, and a gradually fading pulse. After a day and a half, she was given two doses of Major Qi-Coordinating Decoction. By midnight, her stool gradually passed, her pulse returned, and by the next day, she was at peace. This was a case of *guan-ge* (block and repulsion), an extremely difficult condition to treat. Physicians must examine it with utmost care. The *Classic* states: “When there is block, there is vomiting and counterflow; when there is repulsion, urine cannot pass.” Yet in such cases, stool may also fail to pass.

There was a child with vacuity and slippage, whose food was barely transformed, passing stool more than ten times a day. His limbs were emaciated, his abdomen swollen, and after eating, he was hungry again. This illness was precisely heat shifting from the large intestine to the stomach, causing voracious eating yet emaciation—also called “food transmission.” It occurred during the fifth or sixth month, with a pulse that was surging and large but vanished upon pressure. Now, with all six pulses singularly surging, the qi of summer alone prevailed; when pressed, they vanished, indicating the absence of stomach qi. The *Classic* states: “In summer, the pulse is surging. If surging with abundant stomach qi, it is normal; if surging with little stomach qi, it is illness; if surging without stomach qi, it is death.” In summer, stomach qi is fundamental. Treatment was delayed past the proper time, and within ten days, the child indeed died.

There was a person with a chronic cough. Lung vacuity gave rise to alternating chills and fever. Three *liang* of coltsfoot flowers were burned until smoke arose, which was inhaled through a brush handle. When the mouth was full, it was swallowed, and the process was repeated until fatigue set in. Over several days, this was done five to seven times, and the cough resolved.

There was a person who had suffered from malaria for over a month. After being treated with emetic and purgative medicines, their qi became weak, yet the illness persisted. Upon examining their symptoms and pulse, it was determined that they had been injured by summer heat and then further harmed by autumn wind. They were given one dose of Bupleurum Decoction, after which they stabilized. However, they later indulged in improper diet, and the alternating chills and fever returned. This was because the earlier injury from summer heat, compounded by dietary indiscretion, led to vomiting, counterflow, inability to eat, dragging pain below the ribs, and untimely chills and fever—this was called phlegm malaria. A single dose of Ten Jujubes Decoction was administered, which purged several *sheng* of phlegm-water. The next day, two *qian* of Center-Rectifying Powder were given, and the illness resolved.

There was a person afflicted with wind-phlegm, suffering from headache, tremors, vomiting, counterflow, and inability to eat. A physician believed it was due to cold damage and treated it with warming medicines, but it did not improve. Another physician administered a purgative pill, which induced reversal. After being given Golden Liquid Elixir, the patient became delirious, vomiting, trembling, unconscious, and raving as if seeing ghosts. They picked at their clothes and groped the bed, their hands and feet were cold, and their pulse was hidden. This was due to bound heat in the stomach, causing clouded spirit and loss of consciousness. As yang qi could not spread outward and yin qi could not sustain within, tremors and reversal ensued. They were given Major Qi-Coordinating Decoction, and after one dose, they recovered. The formula is found in Zhongjing’s works. Later, they were given Golden Leaf Pill, the formula for which is found in *Shan Fan*.

There was a sixty-one-year-old man with swollen feet and sores. Suddenly, after eating roasted meat, he became unwell. A physician treated him with purgative medicine, and he slightly improved. While going out, he was struck by wind and sweated, after which his head and face swelled violently, turning a purplish-black color. He slept excessively, and on his ears and cheeks, small blistering sores appeared, oozing yellow fluid. He was given Minor Continued Life Decoction with double the amount of notopterygium, and after taking it, he recovered.

There was a fifty-four-year-old man who was habitually weak and prone to cold damage. Recently, dodder seed had been effective for him. In his youth, he had regularly consumed several *jin* of raw sulfur. For five to seven years, his left upper two pulses and right lower two pulses had been wiry, tight, and forceful. He suffered from right-sided hand and foot spasms, cramps, and slightly slurred speech. He was given Zhongjing’s Minor Continued Life Decoction with one *liang* of astragalus added to treat the spasms. The amounts of scutellaria, ginseng, and peony were each halved to avoid cold damage, and only 150 apricot kernels were used. Later, he reported still feeling very cold, so ginseng, peony, and scutellaria were entirely removed, and one and a half *liang* of Chinese angelica were added instead, after which he stabilized.

Nowadays, Minor Continued Life Decoction is used frequently, but since physicians rarely adjust it according to the specific pattern, it often leads to danger, of which people remain unaware. Yet Minor Continued Life Decoction is indeed indispensable in the world.

Thus, let this serve as an example—how could one not be cautious!

The proper qi of the eight seasonal nodes sustains life, while their deficient evil slays it. What is not proper qi becomes evil; what is not true and replete becomes deficiency. The so-called proper qi refers to spring warmth, summer heat, autumn chill, and winter cold—these are the qi of Heaven. When spring qi resides in the channels and network vessels, summer qi in the muscles, autumn qi in the skin, and winter qi in the bones and marrow, these are the qi of man. Where it is present, there is repletion; where absent, deficiency.

Therefore, when the body’s deficiency encounters the seasonal deficiency-evil or improper qi, the two deficiencies interact: first affecting the skin and channels, then transmitting to the viscera and bowels. Once it reaches the bones and marrow, medicinal strength can scarcely reach it. In such cases, when physicians treat illness, they ought to employ medicinals to intercept, disperse, or supplement, preventing the condition from deepening and becoming irremediable. Moreover, one must always protect the stomach qi.

Let this example stand—all else may follow accordingly.

**Revised and Collated by Xu Hong, Imperial Medical Assistant and Drug Authenticator of the Song Dynasty**
*Sequel to the Preface*

We respectfully note that while a single medicinal substance may govern several diseases, its nature and principle inherently exhibit bias. When formulating prescriptions, doubts and confusion may arise. Moreover, in urgent cases where single-ingredient remedies are hastily transcribed for immediate use, thorough investigation is not always possible. It is thus fitting to compile the names of drugs corresponding to the sources of diseases, enabling treatment to be administered directly. Should one seek precise understanding, this arrangement also facilitates comprehension. The sweet and bitter flavors may be briefly noted, and whether a drug is toxic or non-toxic is readily discerned; only its thermal nature—whether cold or hot—must be clearly indicated. Following *The Divine Farmer’s Classic of Materia Medica* (*Shennong Bencao Jing*) and *The Supplemental Records of Famous Physicians* (*Mingyi Bielu*), we annotate these properties beneath each entry. Where certain drugs are unsuitable for decoctions or medicinal wines, or where they are appropriate for such preparations, we likewise categorize them accordingly.

All things in nature possess affinities and aversions. The tiger’s roar summons wind; the dragon’s call stirs clouds. The magnet draws the needle; amber attracts mustard seeds. Lacquer disperses with crab; hemp swells with lacquer. Cinnamon softens with scallions; trees wither with cinnamon. Halite crumbles eggs; otter gall divides cups. Their *qi* resonates in mutual influence—such instances abound, their principles beyond mere contemplation.

Among medicinal drugs, these interactions are especially potent in yielding benefit or harm. The sages of old have already expounded upon them; how can one fail to heed and avoid them? Yet modern formulators often overlook these details. If an old formula exists for a given ailment, it should be amended accordingly. When two substances are comparable, choose the one of lesser severity to omit.

For instance, in the *Red Powder for Cold Damage*, I consistently exclude *Veratrum*. In the *Coptis Pill for Diarrhea*, I likewise remove dried ginger—administered thus, it never fails. Why stubbornly insist on combining antagonistic drugs? Such pairings invite harm, far exceeding mere incompatibility.

Incompatibility (*xiang e*) implies that while one drug may antagonize another, the latter remains indifferent—like ox gall antagonizing dragon bone, yet dragon bone becomes more effective with ox gall, for it is subdued by the former. Contrariety (*xiang fan*), however, entails mutual destruction, rendering combination inadvisable.

Consider how painters place orpiment and lead white side by side, only to see them darken. White turns black with yellow; yellow alters with white—this is the proof of contrariety.

Since the principles of pharmacology remain obscure, treatments often prove ineffective, and people dismiss them lightly. Now, in prescribing and administering remedies, one may fear the sudden difficulty of consulting the *Materia Medica* in full. Thus, I have excerpted the relevant details here, that a glance may suffice for verification.

In the *Divine Farmer’s Classic*, some entries simply state "zhuyu" or "men Dong" without distinguishing between mountain zhuyu, Wu zhuyu, celestial winter melon, or ophiopogon—all should be separately annotated under their respective headings. There are also instances of confusion and error: for example, *haige* (sea clam) and *tuojia* (camel shell) share identical contraindications and aversions. Further, various *zhi* mushrooms are said to employ *shuyu* (dioscorea), while *shuyu* in turn employs purple *zhi*—a circular relationship that defies reason. Which is correct, and which is not? I have recorded these anomalies together, pending broader verification and correction.

In the *Divine Farmer’s Classic*, the "mutual employment" (*xiang shi*) of drugs is typically listed as one-to-one pairings. When cross-referenced with the *Drug Pairs*, however, some entries expand to two or three—yet this poses no issue. Where it is stated that certain drugs "combine to treat a particular illness," and no prohibitions or avoidances are specified, I have not elaborated further.
