**Record of the Divine Manifestation of the Dark Heavenly Emperor • Volume One**
**Transformation of the Golden Palace’s Avatar**

From the *Great Golden Book of the Three Treasures* it is said: One qi divides its form, giving rise to the Numinous Void, the origin of the Five Kalpas. The Three Clarities emerge, styled the Divine Radiance, the inception of the Nine Lights. In the Great Beginning’s primordial vastness, the Dark Ultimate was shrouded in obscurity. Within it dwelt the Void Sovereign, who apportioned the Five Kalpas—named Dragon Han, Crimson Brightness, Supreme August, Extended Peace, and Inaugural August. At that time, celestial light had yet to separate, purity and turbidity had yet to be distinguished; thus was it known that the Three Qi stand as the honor of Heaven and Earth, and the Nine Qi as the root of the Ten Thousand Perfected.

Therefore, the Primordial Commencement emulated the precelestial, unveiled the Three Luminaries, and established the root of Heaven. The Five Scripts expanded the expanse, universally planting the divine spirits. When the Supreme Ultimate first divided, Heaven and Earth began to clarify. The Azure Nine coalesced in the east, the Vermilion Three received in the south. The White Seven formed in the west, the Dark Five returned to the north. The Yellow One arose in the center, styled the Five Elders—the very root of the Dark and Yellow’s planted image. Each of the Five Elders dispersed the primordial qi, transforming it into the Four Numinous Beings to fix the four directions. Encircling the Six Harmonies, the Two Modes revolved within. Propelling the myriad things to completion, by this we trace the source: it is evident that the Dark Emperor indeed preceded the precelestial blackness, the Five Numinous Dark Elders, the transformation of the Great Yin Heavenly One.

According to the *Crimson Writ of the Chaotic Abyss*, the Dark Emperor is the primordial qi of the precelestial, the alternate embodiment of the Supreme Ultimate. During the era of the Upper Three August Ones, he descended as the Perfected of the Great Commencement. In the era of the Middle Three August Ones, he descended as the Perfected of the Great Beginning. In the era of the Lower Three August Ones, he descended as the Perfected of the Great Simplicity. In the time of the Yellow Emperor, he descended in accord with the essence of the Great Yang, incarnating in the womb of Queen Good Victory of the Pure Joy Kingdom. After fourteen months of pregnancy, this marked the eighty-second transformation of the Supreme. The Pure Joy Kingdom lay beneath the Astral Enclosure, a land beyond the seas, corresponding above to the Dragon Transformation Brahma-Passage Heaven.

When the royal palace gave birth to the Sage, it was precisely the Inaugural August Kalpa of the Upper Heaven, the first kalpa descending to the world. In the year marked *jiachen*, the third month, the third day of the *wuchen* cycle, at the hour of *jia-yin* and *geng-wu*, the Dark Emperor emerged from his mother’s left side. At the moment of his birth, auspicious clouds enshrouded the kingdom, heavenly blossoms scattered in profusion, and wondrous fragrance suffused the air. His body radiated precious light, filling the royal domain; the very earth transformed into gold and jade. The auspicious omens were too numerous to record in full.

As the scriptures silently attest, the Dark Emperor was born divine and numinous, his actions concealed and revealed in turn.

With wisdom he perceived the distant, with clarity he discerned the subtle. By the age of seven, he had mastered the scriptures at a glance. Gazing upward and downward, there was nothing he did not comprehend. His heart longed for the Dao, his aspiration aligned with the Great Void. He vowed to serve the Supreme Emperor, bestowing universal blessings upon all beings.

**Renouncing Kin to Pursue the Dao**
As the Dark Emperor matured, he grew fierce and valiant, yet he did not ascend the royal throne, devoting himself solely to cultivation. He pledged to assist the Jade Emperor, vowing to sever the world’s demons and save all beings. Day and night within the royal palace, he made this oath, and his father could not restrain his resolve. At fifteen, he bid farewell to his parents and sought the secluded valleys to refine his primordial essence within.

**The Primordial Lady Bestows the Dao**
The Dark Emperor’s devotion to the Dao was unwavering, and thus he moved the Jade Purity Sage Ancestor, the Purple Primordial Lady, to transmit to him the Supreme Dao of the Limitless. The Primordial Lady spoke to the Dark Emperor: “You must cross the sea and journey east. Beneath the *Wing* and *Axletree* constellations, there is a mountain whose traces rise from *Qian* and *Dui*, coiling for fifty thousand *li*, with waters flowing from the *Zhen* Palace. Since the birth of the Great Ultimate, this mountain has existed. Above, it corresponds to *Manifest Stability*, the *Ultimate Wind*, and *Supreme Peace*. Within the *August Cliff* and *Two Heavens*, there are seventy-two peaks and thirty-six cliffs. You must enter this mountain and dwell among its peaks, choosing the loftiest, the Purple Empyrean. When five hundred years have passed since attaining harmony and ascension, you shall ascend to Heaven. Amidst the *Dragon Han* and *Two Kalpas*, with unbound hair and bare feet, you shall tread the true essence of *Kan* and *Li*, returning to the root and regaining your position. Above, you shall become a minister of the Three Realms; below, a great sage of the Ten Directions. Only then shall your name be renowned for countless kalpas, equal to Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon—this is the fulfillment of your fruition.” Having spoken, the Primordial Lady ascended upon the clouds and departed.

**The Heavenly Emperor Bestows the Sword**
The Dark Emperor followed his master’s words, crossing the sea and journeying east. There, he moved the August Heavenly Emperor of Abundant *Qian* to bestow upon him a sacred sword. The Heavenly Emperor declared: “This sword is named the *Northern Black Galloping Horned Demon-Severing Heroic Sword*. It measures seven feet and two inches, corresponding to the seventy-two seasonal nodes. It governs the Three Assistants, aligning with the Three Terraces. It weighs twenty-four *jin*, corresponding to the twenty-four *qi*.”

The blade spans four *cun* and eight *fen*, corresponding to the four seasons and eight solar terms. “You may bear this sword, dwell in the mountains to cultivate and refine, subdue heterodox ways, and capture or slay demons and monsters.” Having spoken, the Heavenly Emperor ascended upon the clouds and departed.

The Dark Emperor received the sword in full, then passed beneath the constellations *Wing* and *Chariot*. There he beheld the mountain, its peaks veiled in mist, its streams submerged—all precisely as his master had foretold. He entered the mountain, crossed the ravine, chose a site, and concealed himself to cultivate within.

The mountain lies three *she* south of Junzhou. Formerly called Taihe, it was also known as Immortal’s Chamber or Great Peak. After the Dark Emperor ascended to perfected truth, it was said: “None but Xuanwu is worthy to bear this name.” Thus it was renamed Wudang.

As the lofty reserve of Mount Song, it ranks among the Five Peaks. It spans eight hundred *li* in circumference, with seventy-two summits, thirty-six cliffs, twenty-four grottoes, five terraces and five wells, three pools and three springs, four stone formations and three heavenly gates, three grotto-heavens and one blessed land. Wind caves and thunder caverns, medicinal gardens and cinnabar furnaces. Cloud-piercing pavilions and dragon palaces, auspicious clouds and iridescent mists. Fragrant orchids and verdant scallions, celestial vines and heavenly blossoms. Stones glisten with gold and silver stars, trees flourish with pine lichen’s grace. The leaves of the *qian* forest excel at curing illness, the staff of *ling* elderwood can sustain the frail. Divine beasts manifest omens, immortal birds perform celestial music. Imperial treasures and sacred calligraphy guard the teachings and protect the mountain. Black tigers patrol the corridors, crows herald the dawn. Mugwort, famed for a thousand years, extends boundless beneficence. Pines, named for ten thousand years, manifest virtue in gratitude. Lush forests and towering bamboo, where earth and man converge in brilliance. Perfected immortals who attained the Dao are beyond count. The sacred traces upon this mountain cannot be fully recounted. It gathers the mist and radiance of ten thousand ages, returning them to the singular origin of creation.

**The Ravine Bars the Ministers**
The king, longing for his son, could not bear to abandon him. He dispatched ministers leading five hundred soldiers to trace the prince’s path and bring him back to court. They pursued his trail, crossing the ravine into the mountains. There they encountered a sudden surge in the waters, halting their advance. Eight times they attempted to cross, each time met by rising waters. Only on the ninth attempt did they succeed. Arriving at Purple Cloud Cliff, they found the prince and conveyed the king’s decree. Yet as soon as they spoke, their feet stiffened, and they collapsed, unable to rise. Turning to one another, they said: “Such is the power of the prince’s vow.” The return to the kingdom was distant, so with one voice they declared: “We wish to follow the prince and learn the Dao.” As soon as the words were spoken, their steps returned to normal. Together, they concealed themselves within the mountain. After the emperor ascended to perfected truth, all attained the immortal way. Today, the five hundred spirit officials of Wudang trace their origin to this event. The ravine is named Ninefold Crossing Barrier, its meaning thus.

**Youthful Refinement Within**
The Dark Emperor ascended the mountain and first concealed himself at Prince’s Cliff. As he cultivated truth, a spirit crow heralded the dawn, and a black tiger guarded the crag. Each meal, he offered them food. To this day, these two beings, imbued with numinous power, have attained great divinity, appearing and vanishing at will. The crow’s beak is crimson; those who see it prosper. The black tiger expels wickedness; those who defy it invite calamity.

According to the *Compendium of Perfected Truth*, the Black Tiger Great Spirit of Wudang is a transformation of the Northern Celestial One. A numinous guardian of the teachings and the mountain, upright and majestic, its manifestations are boundless. At times it assumes human form, clad in golden armor and black robes, resembling a general. At others, it reveals its true aspect: a black-maned visage like a lion’s. It may appear as large as a *li* or as small as a leopard, leaving tracks in snow or traces in mud. Those who see it may meet misfortune, but those who dream of it receive blessings. It patrols the corridors at night, its divine traces enduring. The wicked are instantly repelled.

The *Canon of Cinnabar* states: “The tiger is born toward the water.” A secret method has been transmitted for its practice in the world. Today, beneath the Auspicious Pavilion of the Celestial One’s True Blessing Palace, there lies Black Tiger Cliff and the Spirit Crow—embodying the black essence of the north, they serve as Wudang’s numinous spirits, foretelling fortune and misfortune, their kindness and severity unfailingly proven. At dawn, their cries herald the morning. Yet in the forgetting of self and other, none startle or flee.

At dawn and dusk, the two offerings take flight, circling as they await food within. One, with a crimson beak, appears and vanishes—those who glimpse it receive auspicious omens.

**Awakening to the Pestle’s Needle**
The Mysterious Emperor cultivated the Dao yet had not grasped the Primal Origin. One day, wishing to leave the mountain, he came to a ravine. Suddenly, he saw an old woman grinding an iron pestle upon a stone. The Emperor bowed and asked, “Why grind the pestle?” She replied, “To make a needle.” The Emperor said, “Is this not difficult?” She answered, “With perseverance, it will be achieved.” The Emperor grasped her meaning, returned to the cliff, and devoted himself to refining the Supreme Dao. The old woman was none other than the Sacred Teacher, the Purple Prime Lord, who had manifested in response to his sincerity. The ravine was named *Mo Zhen* (Grinding Needle) after this event. The immortal *Lei Mai Lu* composed a poem at *Mo Zhen Ravine*:

*Through tempering, skill grows keen and sharp,*
*The Sacred Teacher beckons to the celestial capital.*
*My heart is not stone—firmer than stone,*
*Small tools perfected, the Great Dao is won.*

**Plucking the Plum to Send to the Camphor Tree**
After comprehending the lesson of the grinding needle, the Mysterious Emperor returned to his secluded abode. Along the way, he plucked a plum branch and hung it upon a camphor tree, vowing to the heavens: “If my Dao is fulfilled, let flowers bloom and fruit bear.” Later, as he foretold, the tree still stands today, known as *Peng Mei* (Camphor Plum). Its fruit resembles a plum in shape but has the pit of a peach, its taste tart yet sweet, capable of curing all ailments—though it is rarely found. Its yield foretells abundance or scarcity: in prosperous years, it bears fruit; in lean times, it does not. A transcendent elder presides over it; reverence may secure its blessings. The Jade Creek Perfected composed a poem:

*When the High Perfected learned the Dao in mountain seclusion,*
*He plucked a plum branch and hung it on a camphor tree.*
*With merit complete and work fulfilled, he ascended in flight,*
*Flowers bloomed and fruit bore witness to his foresight.*
*The immortal elder guards the realm, banishing all evil afar,*
*The sacred fruit’s renown endures through endless ages.*
*Consumed, it prolongs life and cures all maladies,*
*Sincere devotion brings blessings ever near.*

**The Immortals of Penglai**
During the Mysterious Emperor’s seclusion and cultivation, nine beauties of dignified and extraordinary bearing came and went from his dwelling, testing his resolve. The Emperor silently recognized them as sages and treated them with reverence. The immortal maidens then said to him, “We are the immortal singers of Penglai, sent to test you. Your merit and conduct are already renowned—redouble your efforts, and you shall ascend on an appointed day.” With these words, they mounted cranes and soared away. Today, they are known as the Nine Masters of Penglai. The cliff where they appeared is named after them.

**The Perfection of the Dao at Purple Clouds**
As the Mysterious Emperor wandered the mountain, he beheld among the seventy-two peaks one that soared into the purple clouds, its base a cliff facing the sun, empty and serene. Following his master’s admonitions, he named the mountain *Taihe Peak*, the summit *Zixiao Peak*, and the cliff *Zixiao Cliff*. He took residence there, and it became the site of his enlightenment—now the Palace of Celestial One’s True Blessing.

The Sacred Teachings declare:
*Our mountain is not as rich as others,*
*Yet others are not as pure as ours.*
*Our mountain is cold in winter but not bitter,*
*Hot in summer but not stifling.*
*Three lifetimes as a human are needed to reach our mountain,*
*Five to dwell upon our land,*
*Seven to be buried within our bounds.*
*Our mountain is still, its grasses lush,*
*Only the sound of bells and drums—no crowing of roosters.*
*If you are destined to dwell here,*
*I shall command the Six Jias to sever the Three Corpses.*
*Seventy-two peaks touch the azure heavens,*
*Twenty-four ravines murmur with flowing waters.*
*Thirty-six cliffs harbor recluses,*
*Those buried here find their bones purified.*

It is also said:
*To the south, the Demon-Subduer; to the north, the Golden Lock,*
*Courage must be steeled, obstacles overcome.*
*At the end and beginning of kalpas, demons are vanquished,*
*Leaving behind a noble name for ten thousand ages.*

The Perfected Lü Chunyang composed a poem:
*When the two primal chaos first divided, this cliff arose,*
*Its heights soaring upon Taihe Mountain.*
*Facing the Great Summit Peak, a thousand fathoms tall,*
*Its back cradles a sweet spring, a bay of water clear.*
*Stone threads form the stance of a soaring phoenix,*
*The grotto’s niche coils like a jade-green snail.*
*Three streams of numinous springs encircle it,*
*Ancient junipers and pines gird it round.*
*Rain scatters pearls that tap the stone walkways,*
*Wind plays jade flutes through the pine gates.*
*The cock crows at dawn in the eastern light,*
*Evening cranes return beneath the curved Dipper.*
*At the valley’s mouth, immortal birds converse,*
*On the mountain’s crest, divine beasts freely climb.*
*Within, the cosmos is vast,*
*Yet the sun and moon lie idle.*
*Since ancient times, this has been where the Mysterious Perfected cultivated the Dao,*
*To this day, traces remain among men.*
*How many immortal singers have come and gone,*
*Drawn by the love of this famed mountain?*
*A stele stands here still.*

**Five Dragons Bearing the Sage**
The Mysterious Emperor, dwelling in the cliff, embraced the Void and the Primal Oneness. In silent communion with the myriad Perfected, after forty-two years, he mastered the Supreme Dao. In the fifty-seventh year of the Yellow Emperor’s reign, the cyclical year *gengzi*, on the ninth day of the ninth month, at dawn on the day *bingyin*, auspicious clouds suddenly descended from the heavens, filling the valleys for three hundred *li* in every direction. The forests and peaks resounded with the celestial music of the *Bu Xu* hymn. At that moment, the Emperor stood nine *chi* tall, his face like the full moon, brows like dragons, eyes like phoenixes, hair and beard dark and lustrous, his complexion clear as ice. Upon his head rested a nine-*qi* jade crown; he wore a robe of pine and mistletoe, barefoot and hands clasped, standing upon Purple Cloud Peak. In an instant, the Five *Qi* Dragon Lords bore him aloft upon clouds, ascending until they reached the Heavenly Pillar Peak of the Great Summit. Five Perfected Ones, accompanied by a host of immortals, descended before the Emperor in a grand procession, beyond mortal comprehension.

**The Edict of the Three Heavens’ Luminous Mandate**
The Mysterious Emperor prostrated himself and received the decree with reverence. The Five Perfected said, “We bear the edict of the Three Pure Ones and the Jade Emperor: your merit is complete, your Dao perfected—ascend now to the Golden Palace. Your sacred father and mother have already ascended to the Nine Heavens.” The Emperor bowed in humble assent. The Five Perfected then proclaimed the edict:

*Divine Child of the Immortal’s Study, Prince of the Pure Joy Kingdom,*
*You embody the transformation of the Primal Origin, the honor of the Celestial One.*
*Teaching without words, none know your mystery.*

Amidst kalpas vast as immeasurable cliffs, it endures ceaselessly, subtle yet ever-present. With hollow heart and full belly, it harmonizes its radiance with the dust. Carving open the workings of creation, the uncarved block scatters its embryonic splendor. Six million years, eighty-two incarnations—bending to perfect the crooked, filling the hollow, mending the worn, renewing the old.

Born in the Dark Cave of Demon Subjugation, bestowed upon the mortal realm as the Mysterious Emperor, he let his hair loose and went barefoot, clad in golden armor and a black robe, his dark banners bristling in the dawn. The Emperor reverently received the kalpa’s decree, leading the Six Ding and Six Jia spirits, the Five Thunder divine soldiers, the Rainbow Lion, venomous dragons, and fierce beasts down to the mortal realm. There, he battled the Six Heavenly Demon Kings upon the wilds of the Dark Cave.

At that time, the Demon Kings transformed the qi of Kan and Li into a colossal black turtle and a giant serpent. No sooner had they taken form than the Emperor, by his divine might, subdued them beneath his feet. As recorded: in Zhongjiang County of Tongchuan Prefecture—once named Mysterious Warrior County—there stands a mountain called Martial Constellation Mountain. It was here that the Mysterious Emperor pursued the demons and subdued the True Ones of Water and Fire beneath his feet, hence its name, still called so by the locals today. On the mountain stands a temple, its plaque *True Numinous Temple* bestowed by Emperor Huizong of the Song during the *Da Guan* era, marking this blessed site where the Mysterious Emperor tamed the celestial pivot and earthly axis. The stones in the river before the temple and the trees upon the mountain all bear the shapes of turtle and serpent. When the sick drink water boiled with them, they are cured. Even now, Tortoise City in Yizhou and Serpent City in Zizhou preserve the relics of that time.

**The Division of Humans and Ghosts**
When the Mysterious Emperor descended to the mortal realm, within seven days, all the world’s demons and monsters were captured and slain. Humans and ghosts were separated, grievances untangled, and lost souls liberated. The hordes of ghosts were shackled within the Great Cavern of Fengdu, and the people at last knew peace. Yin and yang harmonized, and the land was purified.

**Triumphant Return to the Pure Capital**
The Mysterious Emperor, with his divine generals, returned in triumph to the Upper Prime Heavenly Palace of the Pure Capital. There, he prostrated before the Heavenly Worthy and declared: “Yesterday, I received your decree to descend to the mortal realm and eradicate the demonic. By the power of your compassion, within seven days, all the world’s evil spirits were swept away.” The Heavenly Worthy replied: “Have you and your divine hosts not wearied yourselves?”

“You, in the primordial before Heaven, were originally the Five Numinous Mysterious Elder of the North, the transformation of the Primordial Yin and the First Qi of Heaven, the root of all phenomena. Now, after fifteen hundred years, it is time to return to your original realm and restore your root.”

Thereupon, the Primordial Beginning commanded the Jade Emperor to proclaim and bestow a jade register, appointing the Mysterious Emperor as the *North Star Heavenly Guardian*, *True Warrior Roaming Marshal of the Three Realms*, and *Judge of the Victorious Protection Prefecture*. Thus, the Jade Emperor, reverently obeying the Primordial Beginning’s decree, issued a sacred edict to the Jade Flower Academy of the Golden Palace. The *Mysterious Scholar of the Divine Scripture Bureau* and *Great Elixir Perfected*, Wen, composed the jade register, which read:

*“You embody the auspicious qi of the Primal Chaos, your Dao perfected as the honor of the Nine Yangs. Your virtue exalts your immortal rank, your might commands the divine Perfected. For three thousand five hundred springs and autumns, your merit equals that of forty-two kalpas. Through cycles of jia and zi, not a hair’s breadth of the people’s welfare was lost. Now, as the great kalpa turns, good and evil intermingle, giving rise to the Six Heavenly Demon Kings, who harm the multitudes of the Nine Lands. Without true power, how could peace be restored? The Three Pure Ones rely on you; the Nine Sages find refuge in you. Once more, you uphold the flourishing of the Dao and rectify the demonic. You subdue the True Ones of Water and Fire within your grasp, and command the Generals Jia and Geng as your discipline. By this divine transformation, the ten thousand things all prosper. Your merit surpasses that of all the sages—how could it ever be fully praised? It is fitting that you return to your root and restore your origin. If not for such illustrious titles, how could your virtue be made manifest? This imperial seal is bestowed—do not decline in humility.”*

You are hereby specially appointed as the Great General Zhen Tian Xuan Wu, Supreme Commander of the Three Primordials, Envoy of the Nine Heavens’ Patrol, Left Celestial Guardian of the North Pole, Grand Marshal of the Three Realms, Overseer of Divine, Immortal, Ghost, and Spirit Affairs, and Judge of the Xuandu You Sheng Prefecture. As before, you shall retain your title of Supreme Marshal of Tai Xuan and serve as Judge of the Yuanhe Qianxiao Prefecture. Upon receipt of this decree, you are to comply and act accordingly.

Returning to the Kan Palace,
The Supreme Lord commanded the Dark Emperor, saying: “You shall now let your hair flow unbound, go barefoot, tread upon the Tortoise and Serpent, raise the early-forest-black banner, and don your mirror-armor. Stationed in the Kan Palace, you shall be hailed as Heaven’s Marshal and known in the world as the Fortune-Bringing Deity. Each month, you shall descend to uphold the altars of state, universally blessing all living beings. Through countless kalpas, you shall never falter, and your radiance shall renew each day.”

Upon receiving the decree, the Emperor sighed and said: “Long ago, when I was still mortal, I entered Mount Taihe to cultivate the Dao. My original master, the Purple Primordial Lord, admonished me, saying: ‘Five hundred years after your ascension, you shall let your hair flow unbound, go barefoot, and tread upon Kan and Li. Only then will your true essence return to its root and restore your position. Above, you shall serve as a minister to the heavens; below, you shall become a great sage. Only then will your name be renowned for countless kalpas, equal to heaven and earth, sun and moon.’ Today, these words have come to pass, and I have returned to the Kan Palace—how could this not be joyous?”

From that time onward, the Dark Emperor transformed endlessly, becoming the Master of Teachings and the Patriarch of Sects. Dividing his body to descend into the world, he saved beings and delivered people without limit. In grotto-heavens and blessed lands, his divine manifestations were everywhere. The records of his responsive deeds are too vast to be fully chronicled. Some took the surname Li as their lineage, others followed Guo, still others adopted Pei. Through successive generations, he has been revered to this day. All living beings under heaven who have felt his grace know its depth and height to be as boundless as heaven and earth—how could brush or tongue ever exhaust its measure?

The Emperor, enthroned in the noble Golden Gate, governs the pivot of all mechanisms and shapes the myriad kinds. Assisting the Great Sage and True Lord of the Celestial Pole, he regulates the four seasons, propels the movement of yin and yang, and brings forth the ten thousand things. His loftiness is beyond compare. Moreover, through the transformative power of his virtue, heaven and earth become serene, and success is silently achieved. Not a moment passes without his thoughts for all beings, not an instant without his compassion for the world below. Whenever he foresees the turning of kalpas, he first petitions the Golden Gate with utmost sincerity, beseeching mercy and the mitigation of fate. Even when barbarians disrupt the Middle Kingdom or teachings are altered and names changed, he still extends his transformative influence. Truly, he is the Great Compassionate and Great Merciful, the Universal Savior and Supreme Dharma King.

**Evaluating Merit in the Jade Capital**
Long ago in the Upper Heavens, on the fifth day of the fifth month in the third year of the True Transformation, the Primordial Supreme Lord, the Supreme Lord of Highest Clarity, and the Supreme Lord of Grand Clarity convened a grand assembly in the Jade Capital Mountain within the Nine Heavens’ Mystic Qi, in the Jade Clarity Sacred Realm of the Clear and Subtle Heaven, within the Jade Imperial Hall. The Nine Heavens’ Supreme Lords, the Ten Poles’ High Perfected, and the myriad spirits of the Three Realms all gathered in that hall to evaluate the merits and transgressions of all kalpas.

At that time, the Most High and Venerable Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven, together with the Celestial August Emperor of the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace, the Great Emperor of the North Pole in the Purple Tenuity’s Central Palace, the August Earthly Thearch, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperor Lords, the Three Officials and Four Saints, the Solar Emperor and Lunar Sovereign, the Five Planets and Four Luminaries, the myriad forms of the cosmos, and the hosts of earth and water, all arrayed in solemnity, ascended to pay homage to the Three Pure Ones and arrived at the Jade Imperial Hall.

Then, the Primordial Supreme Lord commanded the Nine Heavens’ Marshal and Jade Gentleman Attendant Immortal to open the great cinnabar casket of the Mystic Essence Jade Peak and retrieve the Jade Record of the Ten Thousand Heavens’ Solemn Merit and Transgression. Thereupon, the Grand Marshal of the Golden Gate’s Central Bureau, the Divine Lord Han the Venerable, the True Lord Han of the Controller of Destinies, the True Lord of the Jade Record of Fixed Names, the True Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Merit Investigator, and the True Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Blessing Accumulator opened the records to evaluate the merits and transgressions of all the true lords of heaven since their ascension and attainment of the Golden Gate.

The Five Elders, the Eleven Luminaries, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, and the Star Lords of the Five Directions and Five Dipper Stars, each governing the warp and weft of yin and yang, had, from the Most Ancient times to the present, accumulated merits surpassing a thousand myriad kalpas, thereby attaining the rank equal to the Most High Heavenly Worthy.

The Three Officials and Four Saints, since the opening of the Great Void and the spontaneous arising of the Spirit-One, had performed deeds of protecting heaven and aiding earth, accumulating merits worthy of fifty myriad kalpas, thus deserving the rank second only to the Heavenly Emperors.

Thereupon, the heavens recommended the revered one of the two realms who had no equal. The Primordial Supreme Lord issued the Jade Record, which was transmitted to the Three Ministries of the Golden Gate. Upon reviewing the sacred merits, it was found that they equaled the virtues of the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperor Lords. Thus, the Most High and Venerable Jade Emperor bestowed upon the Three Officials and Four Saints the title of Imperial True Lords.

On the first day of the first month in the fourth year of the True Transformation in the Upper Heavens, the Three Ministries of the Golden Gate issued a decree to the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Highest Clarity in the Central Heaven, summoning the Three Officials and Four Saints to assemble beneath the Three Heavenly Gates and lodge in the Jade Pavilion. Then, the Left Attendant of the Golden Gate’s Literary Academy, the True Lord of the Controller of Scriptures, and the Right Attendant of the Golden Gate’s Literary Academy, the True Lord of the Keeper of Scriptures, were commanded to seal the Jade Flower Court and compose the jade tablets.

On the fifteenth day of that month, the Shangyuan Festival, the Three Officials and Four Saints were enfeoffed with imperial titles. The tablets were inscribed on jade, written in gold, encased in a cloud-brocade treasure bag, sealed in a jade casket, and secured with a golden dragon lock.

The Jade Tablet of the Dark Emperor reads:
In the Great Luo Heaven Above, on the fifteenth day of the first month—the Shangyuan Festival—in the fourth year of the True Transformation, the Three Ministries of the Golden Gate and Jade Imperial Hall respectfully proclaim:
The august and majestic Dao, the illustrious and supreme Perfected.
When the Great Scene first unfolded, the Mystic Origin gave rise to transformation.

The Mystic Mechanism enfolds the pivot of all wonders, revered by the myriad heavens. As the sagely and luminous sovereign’s paramount duty, its glory and vastness are such that none dare fail to honor and revere.

Consider the Supreme Mystic Marshal, the Celestial Dark Warrior Grand General, the Three Primordials’ Chief Administrator, the Nine Heavens’ Patrol Envoy, the Left Celestial Attendant of the Northern Culmen, the Right Commander-in-Chief of the Three Realms, the Director of the Bureau of Primordial Harmony and Migration, the Judge of the Mystic Capital’s Protective Victory Bureau, the Supreme Purple Sovereign Heavenly One Perfected Lord—his numinous potency is supremely wondrous, opening the profound depths of primordial chaos above. His Dao is replete with radiant brilliance, governing the Void and Danger constellations below. He stabilizes the earth’s foundations and nurtures the celestial origins. He sustains the transformations of the four seasons and regulates the guiding principles of the eight solar terms. His emanations descend to bless the cosmos. His merits span fifty myriad kalpas; his virtue parallels the thirty-two heavens. The Nine Empyreans rely upon his true might; the Ten Poles look up to his divine transformations. He bestows great beneficence upon the people below, and his sacred virtue is inscribed in the Jade Chronicle. According to the records, he is second only to the Imperial Perfected. Without exalted honors, how could his virtue be made manifest?

We respectfully dispatch the Golden Perfected Purple Yang Grand Master, the Golden Gate Attendant-in-Ordinary and Grand Academician of the Plain Spirit Hall, Director of the Three Heavens’ Golden Gate Chancellery, the Daily Attendant for Memorials at the Repository of Numinous Treasures, the Radiant Upper Virtue Immortal Xuanyuan Zhiben, to fast and bear the jade tablets and golden script, offering the exalted title and specially appointing him as the Jade Void Preceptor and Supreme Dark Heavenly Thearch, concurrently the Nine Heavens’ Inspector.

The Dao generates the One Qi, its majesty transforming the Three Powers. He crystallizes perfection in the splendor of the Nine Poles and dawns resplendently in the beauty of the Six Heavens. Subtle and resplendent, profound and radiant, his merits are boundless—fitting that he be shown esteemed honor. We trust that upon perusal, he will not decline out of modesty. Henceforth, may he eternally assist the Great Dao above and bless the multitudes below with unending felicity. May dragon script descend in illumination, forever concealed in the Mystic Capital.

Respectfully proclaimed.

**Reception at the Jasper Terrace**
At that time, the Dark Thearch, together with the Heavenly Official of the Upper Primordial, the Earthly Official of the Middle Primordial, the Water Official of the Lower Primordial, the Marshal Tianpeng, the Marshal Tianyou, and the Guardian Perfected Lord, all received imperial titles on the Shangyuan Festival. Upon the Seven Treasures’ Jasper Terrace, the Supreme Heavenly Honored One personally conducted the rites, which closely resembled the ceremonies of mortal emperors appointing generals or establishing states and lineages. The Thearch was bestowed with a jasper standard and a nine-dragon jade chariot. His crown bore the twelve tassels of the *tongtian* diadem; his robes were the dark ceremonial *gun* adorned with sun, moon, mountains, and dragons—all emblems identical to those of the Son of Heaven in the mortal realm. His tablet was of mystic jade; his shoes, of red raven. From that time onward, when the host of perfected beings paid homage to the Supreme Heavenly Honored One, the Four Saints stood at the head of the assembly.

**Celestial Family Celebration**
After the Dark Thearch received the title of Jade Void Preceptor and Supreme Dark Heavenly Thearch, his sacred father was enfeoffed as the Pure Joy Heavenly Lord and Radiant Perfected Great Thearch, and his sacred mother as the Victorious Goodness Heavenly Consort and Jasper Perfected Upper Immortal. Below, the Heavenly Pass was graced by the Supreme Mystic Fire Essence, the Yin-Containing General, the Red Numinous Honored Deity; the Earthly Axis by the Supreme Mystic Water Essence, the Yang-Nurturing General, the Black Numinous Honored Deity. All dwelled in the Heavenly One’s True Felicity Palace. Thus, the Three Realms came to address him as the Dark Thearch.

**Purple Empyrean and Yu’s Traces**
According to the *Nine Mounds’ Canon of Heaven and Earth’s Warp and Weft*, after Yu pacified the waters and lands, he divided and governed the Nine Provinces, established the Five Peaks, defined the boundaries of the Four Seas, and entrusted the renowned mountains and great rivers to divine spirits. Upon examining the records of the *Yi Han*, there was a mountain named Taihe, with seventy-two peaks soaring into the Nine Empyreans, its qi overwhelming Mount Taihua, corresponding to the seventy-two seasonal markers. Ancient tradition held it to be the site where the Dark Warrior attained the Dao and ascended. Beholding this mountain—majestic, resplendent, and facing the sun, with all nine palaces complete—who but the Dark Warrior was worthy to preside over it? Thus, the name Taihe was changed to Wudang Mountain. The Purple Empyrean Palace was built there as the sacred site for venerating the Dark Thearch’s incense offerings. Thereafter, those who divined to dwell as immortals there were many.

**Sweet Rain in Answer to Prayer**
Records state that during the Zhenguan era of the Great Tang, a severe drought afflicted the land. The court issued an edict to all officials to pray at the renowned mountains and great rivers. At that time, the military commissioner of Wudang, Yao Jian, received the command and personally journeyed to the Purple Empyrean Palace on Wudang Mountain to perform the fast and offer prayers. On the evening of the altar’s construction, five scholars of extraordinary and distinguished appearance respectfully sought an audience with Jian. After seating them for some time, they spoke to Jian in a leisurely manner: “We five gentlemen are no ordinary scholars, but the Five Qi Dragon Lords. By the Dark Thearch’s mandate, we have guarded this mountain for no short time. Moved by your integrity and lack of desire, and your earnest prayers, we have come to visit.” Moments later, clouds obscured their vision, and a sweet rain poured down—whereupon the five gentlemen vanished.

**The Five Dragons and the Rise of Tang**
At that time, withered lands revived, and scarcity turned to abundance. The people enjoyed the joys of peace and escaped the calamity of famine. Yao Jian reported these numinous wonders, and Emperor Taizong issued an edict to build the Five Dragons Abbey on Wudang Mountain to commemorate the sacred traces. Thereafter, Yao Jian, ever devoted to the Dao and delighting in purity and emptiness, ceaselessly cultivated his resolve. He conceived the desire to retire, and so brought his family to dwell in seclusion on Wudang, reverently tending the Dark Thearch’s incense offerings. Later, he received a prophetic revelation and was appointed as the mountain’s spirit, receiving blood sacrifices in Jinyang. Today, he is known as the Mighty and Ardent King.

This minister, having perused the Jade Chronicle, has glimpsed the Dark Thearch’s origins. For long, I have held that the Dark Thearch’s deeds trace back to high antiquity, but the records are fragmented and transmissions erroneous, leaving his fundamental origins unexamined. I have long wished to compile a true account to correct the errors and transmit it to the renowned mountains. Yet, as the time was not yet ripe, my earnest efforts were somewhat hindered. Since the Dark Thearch’s advent in the Song dynasty’s rise, he has descended to bless and assist the state—now nearly four *jiazi* cycles have passed. His transformative influence extends across the land’s astrological divisions, where separate Purple Void Numinous Altars have been established to universally deliver all beings.

Having further been granted the honor of attending the numinous carriage and daily approaching the imperial steps, I have taken advantage of moments of leisure to examine and continue the Three Caverns’ Jade Books, collating them into a true record. I dared not embellish the sacred virtue with vulgar words or deceptive adornments, for I have gathered only verified facts.

With reverence, I present this to those of middle and higher attainment, that it may endure for ten thousand generations to come, ensuring the eternal transmission. Thus may all know that the Dark Celestial Thearch originates before the Void and Cavern, the primal ancestor of the Great Dao—how could he be spoken of in the same breath as other divine sages? This is also sufficient to illuminate the origins of Mount Wudang—surely a most splendid and glorious achievement.

The time was the seventh kalpa of the Heavenly Era of Extended Peace, the thirteenth year of the Transformative Opening of the Supreme Great Luo Heaven, corresponding to the *shangyuan* *jiazi* year of the Song dynasty below, the year of *jiachen* in the sexagenary cycle, the eleventh year of the Chunxi reign, the first month, the fifteenth day of the *xinchou* new moon, *yisi*.

The Supreme Perfection Left Minister of the Western Royal Mother, Supreme Clarity Celestial Mechanism Grand Attendant, Spirit-Responsive Primordial Benevolent Perfected, Soaring Rosy Clouds Numinous Radiance Perfected, Central Yellow Master, this minister Dong Suhuang respectfully composed.

**Vow of Mount Wudang**
On Mount Wudang in Nanyang, the Perfected Warrior first studied his practice. He encountered the August Heavenly Emperor of Abundant Heavenly Might, who bestowed upon him a sword named *Northern Black Galloping Horned Demon-Slaying Heroic Sword*, seven feet and two inches in length, corresponding to the seventy-two seasonal nodes. It governs the Three Auxiliaries, aligns with the Three Terraces, and subdues inauspicious affairs. Weighing twenty-four *jin*, it corresponds to the twenty-four qi, severing the perverse to restore the upright, never yielding to heterodox views.

Four inches and eight *fen* in breadth, corresponding to the four seasons and eight solar terms. It continually resides among humans to eliminate calamities and disasters, thereby gaining the service of the celestial asterisms *Tian’gang* and *Hekui*. On Mount E, it subdued the water and fire spirits of the world—the Azure Tortoise and the Vermilion Serpent—along with all malevolent demons that afflict the realm, forcing them into concealment.

Perfected Warrior then inquired of Lord Lao, saying: "I was entrusted with Mount Wudang. If I can subdue all the demons and malevolent spirits of the world, may I receive confirmation and attain the true and orthodox Dao?"

"I have now subdued the water and fire spirits, bringing them under your authority. All manner of demonic hordes have been forced into concealment. I beseech you, Master, to grant me confirmation."

Lord Lao replied: "Come to receive confirmation—what fruit have you cultivated?"

Lord Lao pointed one hand to heaven and one to earth, saying: "As long as heaven and earth endure, how can the demons of the human realm remain concealed? Wait until King Yama arrives, and only then may you receive confirmation. If King Yama comes to see me, it will mean there are no beings in hell—no good, no evil, no heaven, no earth. Only then may you receive confirmation together with him, attaining the supreme fruit of the true and orthodox Dao. For now, continue cultivating your fruit, severing heterodox paths for sentient beings and augmenting your meritorious practice."

From there, Perfected Warrior returned to Mount Wudang, where he lodged in the mortal realm to cultivate for twelve years. One day, he received the *Golden Register* from the Jade Emperor and was appointed to the Northern Pole Protector of Victory Court, where he was charged with adjudicating the good and evil of the human realm, overseeing the records of life and death, and serving as the divine general who dispels calamities and bestows blessings. On a fixed day each month, as well as on *gengshen* and *jiazi* days, he descends in like manner.

A vow states:
*The good and evil of sentient beings are as my own body.
When I ascend to the fruit of realization, their causes shall be as mine.*

**Cultivating the Fruit in Valley Crags**
During the reigning dynasty, in Nankang Prefecture, there was the Mount Lu Great Clarity Heavenly Celebration Abbey.

In the first year of the Guangde era, on the third day of the third month, Zhang Youzhi, Pacification Commissioner of Jiangxi Circuit, entered the mountains for an excursion. There was a cave named Valley Crags. Zhang Youzhi led his retinue into the cave, but after barely twenty paces, he felt his body and mind grow confused and so withdrew. According to reports from his attendants, a military officer named He Quan had entered the cave and vanished without trace. After about two hours, He Quan emerged from the cave, his manner dazed and disoriented.

When He Quan had entered the cave and walked twenty paces, he heard voices within tallying documents. Following the sound, he pressed forward half a *li* and saw a towering palace hall. Above sat three figures in solemn assembly, while below, several hundred officials and clerks were recording and calculating the good and evil deeds of the human realm. Observing closely, He Quan saw a tortoise and serpent playing before him and knew this to be the True Warrior of the North. The central seat was occupied by a figure in royal crown and robes, while the one opposite, a woman, wore a phoenix coronet and rosy slippers. The True Warrior stood to the side. He Quan slipped into the ranks of the attendants and inquired about the occasion.

A clerk replied: "This cave is Valley Crags; its celestial name is Jade Radiance. Today marks the True Warrior’s birthday. Each year on this day, he is granted leave by the Northern Pole to depart the northern quarter at the *chou* hour and arrive in the eastern quarter at the *yin* hour to pay homage to his original master, the Most High Lord Lao. At the Luo-Fu Celestial Palace, he invites his parents to attend. By the *mao* hour, he descends from the southwest to roam the mortal realm, inspecting good and evil, and cultivating the Daoist fruit of heaven and humanity alongside his parents. On this day, if those found guilty of grave offenses—whose sins weigh like Mount Sumeru—are recorded, they may yet receive the compassionate grace of the True Warrior and his parents, and all shall be absolved. If mortals understand the significance of this day and purify their hearts with precepts, offering prayers and supplications for blessings, the merit shall be immeasurable."

He Quan wished to observe more closely, but suddenly awoke as if from a dream, finding himself standing beneath the stone terrace at the entrance of Valley Crags. Zhang Youzhi recorded the account and submitted it to the throne. From then on, it became known that the third day of the third month was the True Warrior’s birthday, when he dispels calamities and bestows blessings upon the people. By imperial decree, officials were dispatched to Mount Lu’s Heavenly Celebration Abbey in Nankang Prefecture to construct the Hall of the True Warrior and His Parents’ Descent, and He Quan was officially exonerated and released.

*Record of the Divine Manifestation of the Dark Heavenly Sovereign, Scroll One (concluded)*
*Record of the Divine Manifestation of the Dark Heavenly Sovereign, Scroll Two*

In the reign of Empress Wu Zetian of the Tang, the Vice Director of the Chancellery, Pei Tao, submitted a memorial recounting the following: "I, Pei Tao, was once appointed magistrate of Xijiao County. One night, I dreamed that the Most High Lord Lao descended and entered my bedchamber, declaring: 'The Tang court shall soon face treacherous ministers and rebellious villains who will disrupt state governance, yet they cannot be eradicated—this will be a great calamity. There is a divine general of the northern quarter, named the True Warrior, who is destined to descend to the mortal realm to fulfill the fourth cycle of karmic deeds in the heavens. He shall be conceived in your household and born into the world.'

My wife then gave birth to a son, Zhongfang. Recently, the imperial court executed two thousand rebel bandits from the Western Regions, including Zhao Hong, and captured them alive. They also exposed and beheaded five hundred treacherous youths, led by the wicked minister He Quanlong, thereby eliminating great evils and saving countless lives. Now, my son Zhongfang has received the divine appointment as General of Spiritual Response.

This matter spread throughout the realm, inadvertently revealing heavenly secrets. One day, as my wife and I conversed, our son suddenly stretched out both hands before us, revealing red cinnabar-like flesh inscribed with characters. Upon inspection, his left palm bore the character *zhen* (True), and his right palm bore *wu* (Warrior). Then, clenching his fists tightly, he refused to open them again. He bathed in fragrant water, changed into clean robes, bid farewell to his parents, and departed. If we wished to see him, he would return but once each month.

When he descends, he will absolve the sins of all virtuous people under heaven. I asked Zhongfang, 'Now that you have left your father to return to heaven, how shall we know the days of your monthly descents, and where will you go?' He replied: 'I shall return to the Northern Palace. If you wish to know the days of my descents, they are: the seventh day of the first month, the eighth day of the second, the ninth day of the third, the fourth day of the fourth, the fifth day of the fifth, the seventh day of the sixth, the seventh day of the seventh, the thirteenth day of the eighth, the ninth day of the ninth, the twenty-first day of the tenth, the seventh day of the eleventh, and the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth. I depart through the earth and return from the heavens.'

With these words, he clasped his hands upon his knees, sat beneath the outer grove, and vanished."

Your Majesty’s humble servant respectfully submits this memorial, awaiting your decree. By imperial edict, a grand Daoist ritual of威仪 was bestowed, and an emissary was dispatched bearing incense to the home of Pei Tao. As the officiating priest arrived to offer prayers and libations, no mortal form of Zhongfang was seen—only an auspicious cloud descending from the heavens, bearing a bronze coffin suspended by a divine retinue. Celestial music resounded, flowers rained from the sky, and the procession drifted slowly toward the path leading to Mount Wudang.

Since the reign of Empress Wu Zetian of Tang, the dates of Zhongfang’s monthly descents have been observed, and offerings made in his honor. He was later venerated as the Perfected Lord of Dao-Transmission and Miraculous Response of Mount Wudang, the True Martial Sovereign. During a major festival honoring the sacred, Langzhou scholar Chen Yuyan—who had failed the imperial examinations three times in his youth—chanced upon Daoist Jiao Zhiwei of the Iron Pillar Abbey on Mount Qingcheng in Yizhou. The Daoist admonished him, saying, "You possess literary talent yet remain unrecognized, all due to karmic causes. Have you not heard that in this age, many revere the True Martial Sovereign? If you devote yourself to his worship, you will surely attain fortune and nobility."

Yuyan asked, "If I now resolve to make offerings, is it too late?"
Jiao Zhiwei replied, "If your devotion is sincere and your reverence unwavering, it matters not whether the years have been long or short."

From then on, whenever the day and month coincided (e.g., the fifth day of the fifth month), Yuyan performed the prescribed rites. He hastily commissioned a silk scroll depicting the sacred image of the True Martial Sovereign and enshrined it in his home, observing the precepts with a steadfast heart.

On the fifth day of the fifth month—the Heavenly Toxin Festival—Yuyan recalled Jiao Zhiwei’s instruction to make offerings whenever day and month aligned. Without delay, at the hour of *xu* (7–9 p.m.), he set up an incense table at his doorstep, facing north beneath the open sky. He bowed one hundred times, presented paper money, and made his devotions.

The next morning, Yuyan told his wife, Liu Shi, "Last night, I had a most extraordinary dream. I saw myself clad in a purple robe, a golden sash at my waist, holding a register of all the names under heaven. I believe this portends success in the upcoming imperial examinations."

Thereafter, Yuyan hastened to prepare for his journey west. A decade passed without word of him. His wife, Liu Shi, filed a petition with the prefecture, which was forwarded to the capital in search of him. Before any action could be taken, a courier suddenly arrived bearing a leather tube marked "Family Letter," addressed to the residence of Vice Registrar of Life and Death Chen in Pan-God Alley, Ban Prefecture. The moment the courier left the yamen, he vanished. When officials sent someone to deliver the tube to Pan-God Alley, they found only the home of Chen Yuyan, the scholar who had left for the capital a decade prior—no Vice Registrar Chen was known to reside there.

At the time, Qian Yannian, the prefect of Langzhou, reviewed Liu Shi’s petition regarding her husband, Chen Yuyan, who had gone to the capital for the examinations and never returned. He summoned Liu Shi and questioned her. Gathering all officials and Liu Shi’s relatives, they burned incense, opened the leather tube, and read its contents. The handwriting was unmistakably Chen Yuyan’s:

*"After leaving home for the capital, I suffered repeated failures in the examinations, as if bewitched. I wandered into the Celestial Longevity Grotto on Mount Wuliang in the Western Capital, where two youths in azure robes presented me with the Jade Emperor’s Golden Register and led me to the Northern Culmen Sovereign. I was appointed Vice Registrar of Life and Death, Good and Evil, and Longevity in the True Martial Sovereign’s Protective Victory Institute. I was granted a purple robe and golden sash and entrusted with the case files of all mortals under heaven. The True Martial Sovereign then revealed to me: ‘You still bear a mortal’s form, and your merits are incomplete.’ He reassigned me to the Seven Lords of Northern Primordial to temporarily oversee the assessment and dispatch of immortals across the celestial palaces. After one mission, I was to return to the Protective Victory Institute. Thus, I forgot to return home, and no word reached you.*

*During a descent with my lord, I noticed an aura of resentment rising from Langzhou. The True Martial Sovereign investigated and found it was my wife and children, grieving over my unknown fate. I pleaded for mercy, and the True Martial Sovereign, in his compassion, permitted me to send this personal letter. He dispatched a Wandering Day Spirit to deliver it to Langzhou, where it was to be presented to the authorities. I urge you to remain chaste, preserve our family estate, care for our children, and above all, honor the incense and offerings to the True Martial Sovereign in our home. Do not deceive your heart or betray the sacred.*

*Though I once aspired to serve the state, my repeated failures in the examinations led me to this celestial post. I now serve in the heavenly bureaucracy, ever mindful of protecting the dynasty, pacifying the people, and benefiting all beings—though my aid must remain unseen. Fearing you would worry, I send this letter in my own hand.*

*When this was reported to the throne, an edict was issued to Langzhou, stating: ‘Though Chen Yuyan was unsuited for earthly office, he has found a place in the celestial hierarchy, his heart set on serving the state and its people. Having been received into the True Martial Sovereign’s retinue—and given Our own reverence for the True Martial Sovereign, whose blessings extend across the realm—We decree that a seven-day-and-night ritual of *fajiao* be held in the Jade Ford Garden to offer thanks. Three hundred strings of cash shall be allocated to Chen’s wife and children for meritorious works and gratitude. A shrine to Vice Registrar Chen, Lord of the Protective Victory Institute, shall be established in a nearby abbey.’"*

The Secretariat-Chancellery, the Three Departments, and the Ministry of Rites jointly submitted a memorial, having thoroughly investigated the True Martial Sovereign’s past manifestations—whether through worship or spontaneous miracles—on behalf of the state and its people. In total, one hundred and four cases were compiled, each with distinct categories and causes.

Recently, as the inner palace halls were renovated and new gates erected in the five directions, each with unique names, the following designations were determined for the True Martial Sovereign’s precincts:
- The central and principal gate of the sovereign’s palace shall be named **Great Purgation of the Mystic Capital**.
- The upper gate of the left wing (eastern passage) shall be named **Fortune-Clearing Mystic Perfection**.
- The lower gate (southern passage) shall be named **Winged Victory Dragon’s Flight**.

The upper gate of the right wing (western passage) shall be named **Jade Compassion, Golden Longevity**. The lower gate (northern passage) shall be named **Everlasting Life, Vast Transformation**.

The central gate oversees thirty-one memorials of petitions, thanksgivings, and responsive manifestations for **Initiating Sagacity and Protecting the State**. The eastern gate oversees thirteen memorials of petitions and responsive manifestations for **Initiating Sagacity in Military Campaigns and Prayer for Divine Assistance in Battle**. The western gate oversees sixteen memorials of petitions for **Initiating Sagacity in Prayers for Clear or Rainy Weather and Manifestations of Transformation**. The southern gate oversees twenty-seven memorials of petitions for **Initiating Sagacity in Compassionate Salvation of the People and Responsive Manifestations in Healing Illnesses**. The northern gate oversees seventeen memorials of petitions for **Initiating Sagacity in Deliverance from Water, Fire, Disasters, and Epidemics, with Timely Responsive Manifestations**.

Records of the miraculous appearances of the tortoise and serpent are appended to the categories of the five gates. As the construction of the True Martial Sovereign’s halls remains incomplete, the compilation has not yet been formally submitted. It awaits completion, at which time it shall be presented on the day of the grand sacrifice, following imperial approval and bestowal. Henceforth, on every monthly descent day and the first day of each month, regular offerings and taboos shall be observed.

Any characters containing the components for "begging" or "bandit" are to be avoided in the records of this hall. In summer, plums are to be excluded from offerings, and in winter, pomegranates are to be avoided. Incense must not be mixed with musk.

Commoners who are not of official rank but wish to make offerings in accordance with the established rites may submit a written petition for imperial consideration, and upon receiving the sacred decree, they shall be permitted to proceed accordingly.

**Presented Ritual Protocol**

We humbly reflect that the True Martial Sovereign and Perfected Lord of the Upper Realm, in this present age of governance, aids the state and brings peace to the people. To repay this grace and virtue, a Precious Response Pavilion has been erected within the inner palace. One hundred and four cases of responsive manifestations, both past and present, have been compiled and shall accompany the records of meritorious deeds to be bestowed upon the pavilion. These shall be sequentially transmitted to the Historiography Office for compilation, revision, and transcription, with each case duly reported and its categories properly aligned.

For the monthly descent days and the first day of each month, the ritual protocol for offerings beneath the pavilion is as follows:

According to the submitted protocol by Zhang Zigao, Supreme Clarity Dharma Master and Abbot of the Jade Clarity Luminous Response Palace on Mount Tai and the Azure City Grotto, the True Martial Sovereign and Perfected Lord descends on the six Gengshen days, the six Jiazi days, the Three Primes, the Five La festivals, and the first day of each month. For those who seek protection and blessings through offerings on these days, the following shall be observed before dawn:

- Draw a bowl of well-flower water and immerse a willow branch in it.
- Light a lamp or a pure beeswax candle.
- Prepare a cup of jujube broth and a cup of pure tea.
- Burn a censer of fine incense—settle, clove, frankincense, or sandalwood—at one’s discretion. Do not use damp or mixed incense, nor any containing musk.
- Offer seasonal fruits and vegetarian foods. In summer, plums are forbidden, as they are taboo objects associated with the True Lord’s renunciation of his crown and sandals. In winter, pomegranates are to be avoided, for when the True Lord had yet to attain the Dao, he slew the demonic Ghost King who had wrought havoc across the world. In his haste, he fled to Mount Luofu, where he lost sight of his parents’ belongings.
- Offer a sprig of sweetgrass when the Perfected One enters meditation.
- Between the hours of Xu and Hai, burn a second censer of incense, along with a string of gold paper money, referred to as "five hundred strings."
- Present a black cloud-horse, without painted adornments, to avoid offending with ox-glue.
- Prepare a petition of intent, sealed in a round envelope. Commoners must not address themselves as "your subject."
- Scatter silk flowers within, and include a single leaf of gold paper money, referred to as "five strings."
- Present a talismanic horse, first burning it in the open air.

The attending spirit-officials of the day shall transmit these offerings—along with the paper money and horses—directly to the Heavenly Gate and thence to the presence of the True Martial Sovereign in his divine procession. The paper money must be burned without using oil-soaked paper to ignite the flames, lest it fail to be received by the celestial, terrestrial, or underworld bureaus. When transformed into wax money, it is collected by the authorities of Mount Tai as "useless accumulations," piled into a wax-money mountain, and recorded by the relevant officials for verification. This protocol is hereby approved for implementation.

After review by the Central Secretariat, it shall be presented to the Precious Response Pavilion. The protocol is also bestowed upon the imperial clan, devout followers of the True Martial Sovereign, and civil and military officials, who shall uphold and perform these rites accordingly.

**Cloud-Covered Grotto Heaven of the Dragon Diagram Pavilion**

Lü Dafang, Academician of the Dragon Diagram Pavilion, while on a mission to the Western Qiang, passed through Linzhong River. Suddenly, he encountered a violent storm of wind and thunder, with towering waves and darkening skies. Fearing for his safety, he inquired of the local households, who informed him that the rituals of two neighboring states’ sacred altars were held here. To the north lay a mountain called the Azure Net Grotto Heaven, within the borders of the Great Song. The mountain was often illuminated, and at times, storms of wind, mist, rain, and hail arose. When people from both sides of the border came to gather firewood, they could hear the voices of divine beings across the mountain.

Upon disembarking and gazing in all directions, Lü saw auspicious clouds veiling the peaks like a coiled topknot. Through the mist, he discerned a figure over thirty *zhang* tall, clad in golden armor and a crimson robe, with unbound hair, seated upon a great boulder. Before him were the tortoise and serpent, and behind him stood a battle standard. Arrayed before him were banners, canopies, and parasols—unmistakably the descent of the True Martial Sovereign.

Realizing that his mission had coincided with the Sovereign’s descent on the first day of the first lunar month, Lü attributed the storm to the divine presence. When the wind and rain subsided, he prepared incense and proceeded to Azure Net Mountain. From afar, he faced the True Martial’s descent site, burned incense, and prayed for a safe journey into the foreign land, an early return, and the resolution of conflicts for good fortune.

Upon arrival, he met the Qiang king Li Chengye, who governed the fertile lands along the Fan River. Initially, the Qiang general Husuzhai had contested this territory, leading to unrest despite previous agreements. Later, upon learning that a Song envoy was to cross the border, the Western Qiang sought to reclaim the two thousand *li* of land along the Fan River. The Song court, recognizing the strategic value of the region for its settled populace, dispatched Lü Dafang as envoy.

Li Chengye, having established peaceful relations with the Song, complied with the imperial decree and made no further demands.

As Zhang Yanzu and the various Qiang officials escorted Lü Dafang onward, after traveling some fifteen *li*, petals of five colors drifted down from the sky. Attempting to gather them in vessels, they all turned to sweet dew. When tasted, they were like fragrant butter or cream. After a long while, the red glow gradually dispersed.

Lü Dafang again reached Green Silk Mountain, where he paid homage to the True Martial. There, the mountain flowers, though withered and fallen, bloomed anew out of season upon the branches, spreading throughout the forests and fields. When he ordered them gathered, the blossoms withered at his touch. Upon Lü Dafang’s return to court, he reported these events in person. Regarding his journey to and from Green Silk Mountain, where he had encountered the True Martial’s hidden aid, an imperial decree was issued to the Left and Right Street Daoist Registries to select Daoist priests. Envoys were dispatched with them to Green Silk Mountain to offer thanks, casting gold dragons and jade tablets into the site, which was then established as the True Martial’s place of divine descent.

The palace’s golden-skirted halls—
In the fifth month, fifth day of the second year of the Zhihe era, an imperial vow was made to hold a solemn Daoist ritual offering. Slaughter was forbidden, penal sentences were mitigated, and for forty-nine days, the imperial carriage left the inner chambers as the emperor observed abstinence in attire. Day and night, the ritual assemblies continued. By the third day of the eighth month, a sudden wind and mist arose in the front hall, filling the space. The assembled officials, attending the emperor, witnessed a figure clad in golden armor appear throughout the great hall. As the clouds gradually receded, a single foot was revealed, vanishing toward the northwest. On the eighth day, the ritual assembly was dissolved.

Since the Divine Warrior manifested his foot and descended in spirit, the imperial will revered him deeply, desiring to establish his presence within the palace’s Hall of Mystic Truth. The Divine Warrior was thus moved from the inner chambers to a separate site for the creation of a Hall of Requital. The Ministry of Rites, overseeing the auxiliary hall, assessed the divine majesty, its height and breadth conforming to the late emperor’s special grant.

The position of the palace hall was such that no official temple in the realm could properly receive it. It was known that in Bozhou stood the Supreme Clarity Divine Capital Abbey, the very place where the Supreme Lord Lao descended and was born. As Laozi was the master from whom the Divine Warrior inherited the Dao, no other location was suitable. The Three Departments jointly memorialized, and by imperial decree, an auspicious day was chosen. Officials accompanied the emperor bearing incense to install the Hall of Mystic Truth. The Divine Warrior was moved from the inner palace, and officials were commissioned to escort him to the Supreme Clarity Divine Capital Abbey, where he would temporarily receive offerings. The throne further commanded the prefecture to survey the site and construct a separate hall.

Later, Bozhou memorialized that on the first day of the tenth month, the cypress and juniper before the abbey’s hall had withered—yet their branches suddenly sprouted leafy ears like spring shoots. Samples were gathered, sealed, and presented to the throne, then conveyed to the Three Halls of the Luminous Spirits Palace for offerings. Within ten days, the emperor’s health appeared to decline. That night, he dreamed of a warrior in yellow robes who said: *"I am the talismanic officer of the Divine Capital Abbey, sent by the Divine Warrior to report the portents of your imperial destiny. Why do you show no intent to extend it? I have already given you the omen of withered wood sprouting ears."* The following day, the officials Pang Ji and others jointly memorialized the matter.

Just as the emperor’s health faltered, it was fitting to intensify care and prayers to perpetuate his heavenly mandate, for this lay in the sincerity of exorcistic supplication. Decrees were issued to all circuits, prefectures, and commanderies, dispatching Daoist masters to the capital. Yet when Hao Zhengyan of the Eastern Peak performed his rites, no true efficacy was manifest. Then Wang Bochu of the Southern Peak was summoned, who memorialized the Supreme Emperor of the Purple Tenuity of the North Pole, beseeching his protection of the imperial throne.

Soon after, the Three Departments and the Ministry of Rites jointly presented a memorial. By imperial decree, it was ordered that, following the precedent of the fifth day of the fifth month in the sixth year of the Huangyou era under Emperor Renzong, the emperor proceed to the Luminous Spirits Palace to perform the rites. Suddenly, as the imperial carriage set forth on its return to the palace, the court officials were commanded to partake in the sacrifices. Upon the conclusion of the ceremony and the ensuing court congratulations, the emperor recounted the reason for his return: while at the Luminous Spirits Palace, he had raised his eyes and suddenly beheld the northern Celestial Gate open, revealing several crimson beams of light. Within them appeared a figure clad in golden armor, his skirt swaying as he dragged one foot, drifting leisurely across the sky before vanishing—recognized as the True Warrior of the North. Then a youth in azure robes gestured toward the emperor with an outstretched hand. No sooner had the imperial carriage returned to the palace than word arrived from the Huacheng Palace of a joyous birth: the emperor’s youngest daughter, the Princess of the State.

An order was given to establish a separate shrine to the True Warrior within the inner palace, to serve as a sanctuary for protective incense offerings. Three nights later, the same youth who had pointed during the emperor’s return appeared once more in the central courtyard, announcing: *"When Your Majesty departed the Luminous Spirits Palace, the Princess was born in the Huacheng Palace. At the moment of her birth, she stood in the position of a child facing the father’s palace—an ominous alignment. Heaven commanded that the hour be averted, and it was the True Warrior who specially shielded her, sparing her from all peril. Now, by the True Lord’s decree, I report to Your Majesty: this daughter’s sojourn in the world shall last but one cycle of twelve years, and she will indeed pass at thirteen."* Later, when Emperor Renzong learned of this foreknowledge, he drew upon the inner treasury’s wealth to erect a stele on the spot, commissioning the construction of the Welcoming the True Pavilion at the Luminous Spirits Palace. Within it, a full-body statue of the True Warrior was sculpted in vibrant colors, establishing a grand state ritual. The True Warrior was honored as one who descends to bestow blessings, aid the virtuous, and diffuse luminous grace. Each year, a young acolyte was appointed to tend the incense and lamps.

During the Zhihe era, the court official Fu Bi and others memorialized: *"In the time of our imperial ancestor, Emperor Taizong, the Abbey of the Four Saints of the North Pole was founded in the capital. One night, within his bedchamber, he beheld a divine messenger, crowned and robed in solemn dignity, bearing a tablet. The messenger declared: ‘I am the fourth marshal of the Supreme Emperor of the Purple Tenuity. In gratitude for the establishment of this abbey and the veneration of our incense offerings, I have come to express thanks.’ The emperor replied: ‘The Four Saints all receive my reverent devotion. Why do you alone come to offer thanks?’ The True Warrior answered: ‘Tianpeng, Tianyu, and Heisha have already paid their respects in the clouds, but their three divine marshals ride dragons and tigers, surrounded by legions of ghostly soldiers, which might startle Your Majesty. Thus, I alone appear.’ He then took his leave, and the emperor, upon waking, recorded the encounter. The following day, he proceeded to the Abbey of the Four Saints."*

Thereafter, within the inner palace, a shrine dedicated to the True Warrior’s household deities was constructed, named the Hall of Mystic Perfection. Over fifty years have since passed.

For the Heavenly Marshal, the True Warrior, descended into the mortal realm to assist General Di Qing in his campaigns. He vanquished two million troops under the Western Fan chieftains Li Jiqian and Zhao Yuanhao, and one hundred thousand mountain bandits led by the Southern Man chieftain Nong Zhigao. When Di Qing donned the divine mask bestowed upon him, his visage mirrored that of the True Warrior. In every battle, victory was attributed to the True Warrior’s possession and aid. Upon inquiry and verification of these accounts, the emperor pardoned Di Qing and his subordinates, permitting them to attend the Hall of Extensive Virtue and Broad Pacification.

When the True Warrior manifested, he appeared with twenty-eight attendants, each wearing bronze-yellow masks, their hair unbound, foreheads wrapped in red silk, bodies clad in armor, donning dark tunics, bare-legged, wielding ceremonial blades, and mounted on horses in formation. None among the ministers and officials could discern the true from the illusory, save for the Grand Councilor Han Qi, who observed from horseback alongside the emperor. One figure stood out—tall, majestic, and serene—before whom a black turtle and a crimson serpent frolicked upon the ground. After a moment, they vanished.

Later, Di Qing changed into court attire to offer his thanks. By imperial decree, he was asked to identify his position during the apparition. He dismounted and replied: “I stood in the tenth position of the right flank, which aligned with Your Majesty’s perception of the radiant manifestation.” Thus, a fast was observed, and a jiao ritual was commissioned to invite the True Warrior’s descent.

On the fifth day of the fifth month in the second year of the Zhihe era, an altar and ritual platform were erected. That day, within the household shrine, a crimson serpent, two feet and four inches in length, emerged from the hall, coiling and leaping. It was captured in a covered tray and presented to the emperor, who later returned it to the shrine. In that instant, lightning flashed, the hall resounded, and black mist swirled. A clap of thunder erupted, and the serpent disappeared.

The ground before the hall in the Eastern Capital’s Abbey of the Four Saints—originally the ancestral residence of the imperial clan—had been donated by Emperor Taizu after his suburban sacrifices. It was consecrated as the Abbey of Establishing Prosperity, dedicated to the Four Saints as protectors of the realm. During subsequent imperial visits to offer special rites to Tianpeng, Tianyu, Heisha, and the True Warrior, a turtle and serpent emerged from beneath a mural, coiling before the emperor. A small cavity was found in the earth, where the two creatures nested like a burrow. Thus, a jade-inlaid stone tray was bestowed to serve as their chamber, and a jade-lined passage was carved into the ground, forming the Jade Weir Gate.

During the reigns of Emperor Taizong and Emperor Zhenzong, the turtle and serpent also appeared within the Jade Weir Gate, each manifestation heralding auspicious events. In the third month of the twenty-seventh day of the Kangding era, as the emperor entered the Abbey of the Four Saints, the creatures emerged once more, leaping to greet the imperial procession. After receiving incense offerings and retreating, they remained for half an hour before departing.

Shortly thereafter, the military commissioner Xia Lian and others submitted a memorial reporting the subjugation of Zhao Yuanhao and his return to the frontier, crediting Di Qing’s leadership. As the creatures lingered, seemingly listening, the emperor reviewed the memorial. Upon its conclusion, they returned to the Jade Weir Gate and did not reemerge. An additional imperial edict was issued, granting further endowments to the shrine’s incense offerings.

**Vanguard of the Sacred Image**
During the Tianxi era, He Sui, an envoy from the western frontier, entered the capital, presenting tribute of elephants, horses, gold, and felt.

During the recent standoff between our two armies, when victory or submission remained undecided, a guardsman inadvertently entered the camp, peddling medicines for wounds, broken bones, and wind-induced ailments. For three days, he sold his remedies throughout the military encampments. Over thirty thousand men consumed them, only to find their limbs weakened, leaving them prostrate and unable to rise. Meanwhile, scouts reported that in Commander Cen Yuanyou’s forward camp, where provisions were scarce, a Daoist also sold medicine. Both men and horses partook of it, and for three days, none felt hunger.

Rumors spread among the frontier tribes: *"The Song dynasty enjoys the protection of the Perfected Lord Zhenwu of the Northern Culmen, summoned by their devotion."* Upon further inquiry into the *Biography of Zhenwu*, we learned that as the Perfected One of the Golden Portal of Grand Clarity, he had manifested as the Celestial General of the Northern Culmen, bestowing his grace universally. The Song have reaped his blessings, while we suffer calamity—for our lands have never received the sacred image of Zhenwu, nor the rites of veneration.

We humbly dispatch envoys to petition: grant us the sacred likeness of Zhenwu, along with his retinue and the proper forms of worship, that we may enshrine and honor them as prescribed. Henceforth, we vow to maintain peace and forswear all raids. Your ministers have deliberated: the celestial deities of the state and altars cannot be indiscriminately bestowed. Accordingly, the Hanlin Academy was instructed to paint a standing portrait of Zhenwu in the style of the ancestral temple, omitting the tortoise and serpent. The requisite rituals for offerings and descent were recorded and conveyed to the envoys.

The Li ruler of the frontier, unaware that the tortoise and serpent are Zhenwu’s vanguard generals, believed he had received the complete and authentic image. He proclaimed an edict to venerate it in strict accordance with Song ritual, renouncing warfare. Every three years, envoys are dispatched to present tribute—all by the grace of the Perfected One’s transformative power.

**Auspicious Marvels of the Sacred Pavilion**
Qian Yannian, Grand Scholar of the Hall of Enlightenment and Military Commissioner of Shanzhou, reported: The Tianqing Abbey in this prefecture houses a thousand Daoists, with daily provisions for nearly fifteen hundred. The funds for incense and divination slips from the Sacred Pavilion of Zhenwu are pooled for shared use. This pavilion was built during the Kaibao era, when Emperor Taizu dispatched Envoy Tao Jue to Tong Pass. Upon discovering the abbey’s sacred altar and celestial omens, he learned that the Hedong campaign had faltered. Yet, by the Yellow River’s banks, twenty thousand cavalry and infantry were miraculously guided into the prefecture at night. Recognizing Zhenwu’s intervention to save the imperial carriage, the emperor erected this pavilion in gratitude, naming it the *Pavilion of Repaying Grace and Protecting the Sacred*.

Of late, incense offerings have dwindled, kitchens lie barren, and no one tends to the halls or the Sacred Pavilion. Upon inquiry, the abbey’s custodian, Daoist Liu Yinzhen, stated: When Emperor Taizong returned from the Hedong campaign, he honored Taizu’s legacy by issuing an edict to augment the sacrifices on Zhenwu’s descent day, allocating 120 strings of cash from the military treasury for the ritual feast. Later, during Emperor Zhenzong’s reign, as the western frontier grew restless and border defenses required urgent funds, the additional grants ceased. Consequently, Daoists dispersed, and none came to draw divination slips, leaving the halls and kitchens unsupported.

Days ago, a tortoise and serpent appeared beneath the Sacred Pavilion, coiling around the altar’s base, emerging and retreating at intervals. Those versed in such matters declared it an auspicious sign, presaging an imperial decree for the abbey. Yannian, recalling Taizu’s devotion to the Dao, lamented that within three reigns, the abbey had fallen into ruin. Risking censure, he petitioned for its restoration.

Before the memorial could be submitted, an imperial rescript arrived, ordering the prefect to investigate Tianqing Abbey. Now designated as the Zhaoying Palace, it had recently celebrated a festival when a golden-crowned, purple-robed Perfected One appeared, declaring: *"I oversee the affairs of Shanzhou’s Tianqing Abbey. Seeing its Daoists destitute and unsupported, I marvel that Your Majesty has forgotten the foundations laid by former emperors. Restore its provisions swiftly."* With that, he vanished. The matter was to be verified and reported.

Yannian, already aware of the circumstances, submitted a detailed account to the throne. By imperial decree, the original grants of Taizu’s reign were reinstated. The abbey’s Daoists were recalled to resume their rituals, and a three-day feast was held to honor the Perfected One’s boundless grace and Zhenwu’s compassion as the merciful and mighty Teacher of the Dao.

**Five Manifested Forms**
Sun Hengfu of Yizhou, renowned for his ink paintings of Zhenwu and other deities, was approached by five wandering Daoists. They claimed to reside at the Yuntai Abbey on Mount Hua and, having heard of his fame, sought a scroll of Zhenwu—but insisted on providing their own model. Hengfu replied: *"My works, painted as acts of merit, are celebrated across the land. Why seek another model?"* The Daoists countered: *"Your skill is unmatched, yet you have never beheld the true original."*

Leaving money to purchase silk, they departed, promising to return on the seventh day of the following month with the authentic image. On the appointed day, the five reappeared—without a scroll. Instead, they requested brushes and ink, asking to view the model in seclusion. Hengfu invited them in, and as he prepared to paint, they instructed him to turn away. Suddenly, a radiance like fire swirled, illuminating the room. The five transformed within the clouds: one figure, wreathed in crimson light, appeared with unbound hair and bare feet, clad in golden armor and a dark robe, wielding a tasseled whip. He rode a white-maned black horse, his face refined, with long eyes, straight brows, a prominent nose, and a square jaw. Before him coiled the tortoise and serpent; behind him, a banner and a standard. This was Zhenwu in his true martial form.

Another held a banner, a third a sword—both wore armor, their faces stern and coarse, like celestial warriors. They were named *Tiancheng* and *Hekui*.

Another wore a blue-green robe with a sash, a serving maiden. One more, clad in crimson with a kerchief and sash, held registers as a recording official. Once the five revealed their true forms in the void, they suddenly vanished. Hengfu committed their likenesses to brush, completing but a single scroll. When mounted, a golden halo naturally shimmered upon it, its countenance ever-changing. Alarmed, Hengfu deemed it too sacred for private keeping and presented it to the prefecture.

At the time, Prefect Su Yijian recorded the account, sealed the painting, and dispatched Attendant Liu Tong with Hengfu to present it to the capital. Upon inspection by the court’s ministers, it was deemed a treasure. Beyond its retention as a revered imperial painting—*The True Form of Zhenwu, Protector of the Realm*—to grace the palace’s incense altar, Hengfu’s grandson was specially granted the rank of *Sanban Fengzhi*, eligible for official appointment.

**Two Transcendents Radiant with Light**
In Jingdong Circuit’s Qingzhou, under the jurisdiction of Zhenhai Commandery, though temples and abbeys had long existed, no hall had been dedicated to the Northern Culmen’s True Warrior. When Military Commissioner Zhang Cao set sail, Qingzhou summoned its inner Daoist officials, instructing them: “The Northern Culmen governs the span of human life, wealth, honor, poverty, and lowliness. Zhenwu, its divine general, descends monthly to scrutinize good and evil, determining reward or retribution. All who pray to him find their pleas answered. Yet the people have not built him a hall—why?”

Zhang Cao, moved by devotion, personally initiated the fundraising effort. He first selected the Tianqing Abbey as the site for constructing these two halls, beginning with his own donation of five hundred strings of cash. Officials, scholars, and commoners followed, contributing gladly. The construction and sculpting were swiftly completed. However, Qingzhou lacked artisans skilled in red sculpting. One day, Zhang Cao burned incense and prayed to heaven, vowing to find a master craftsman to perfect the merit of the halls. Within ten days, two men arrived, offering to sculpt the sacred images for the two halls, claiming to be from Wu. In little over a month, all was prepared. When Zhang Cao and the assembled officials came to pay their respects, they saw that while the divine retinue and attendants were complete, only Zhenwu’s image remained unopened in its radiance. The two artisans each wished to open one eye, dividing the task between left and right. As they filled in the pupils with their brushes, the divine countenance suddenly appeared awe-inspiring and stern, its expression unusually joyful. From the two opened eyes burst forth a single beam of golden light, and within that light, the two artisans vanished without a trace—thus revealing Zhenwu’s compassionate descent to the mortal realm to perfect the merit of the two halls. Zhang Cao led the officials, scholars, and commoners in holding a grand jiao offering and vegetarian feast at the Northern Culmen’s True Warrior Hall to repay the grace of the Perfected One’s descent. From then on, the incense and offerings flourished.

Later, an epidemic of eye ailments spread throughout Qingzhou. Zhang Cao ordered the Daoist official Tang Jian to consecrate water before the hall, which was then distributed for washing—all were cured. Zhang Cao reported the matter in a memorial, and an imperial envoy was dispatched to present incense and hold a jiao offering. The hall was also bestowed the name *Jiaying* ("Auspicious Response") as its plaque, and a stele was erected to record the event.

**The Tang Brothers’ Precious Image**
In Xuan Prefecture’s market district lived four brothers—Tang Zhong, Tang Yu, Tang Xian, and Tang Yuan—who dwelled together. Zhong served as a clerk in the prefectural office, Yu practiced medicine, and Xian remained at home in leisure. Since their grandfather’s time, the family had continuously enshrined and worshipped an image of Zhenwu. After their father’s death, the brothers grew negligent, except for Tang Xian, who remained devoted to the incense and offerings. He sold his wife’s dowry chest to purchase additional incense, paper horses, and other ritual supplies. His brothers, however, grew resentful, accusing Xian of idleness, living off their shared resources, and squandering money on the pretext of divine worship. Xian replied, “If you wish to divide the household, choose whatever possessions you desire. I ask only for our ancestors’ Zhenwu image to continue its veneration.” His brothers, having no interest in its upkeep, readily agreed.

Zhong, Yu, and Yuan privately amassed wealth, each growing prosperous, while Xian retained only the house. He sold the rest of their property, opening a small pawnshop to sustain himself. One snowy day, a poor man arrived carrying a cloth sack on his back and a bronze lamp in hand, atop which sat a small statue of Zhenwu trampling the tortoise and serpent, exquisitely crafted. He offered it for a pawn of one string of cash. Xian bargained to redeem it for three strings, and the man agreed. A monk named Yongxiang acted as witness, Xie Zhen as guarantor, and Liu Tan drafted the contract. After the money was exchanged, the poor man told Xian to keep two strings and seven hundred coins, saying he would return shortly to collect them. Xian placed the image in his family shrine. On the next descent day, he washed it with fragrant water, and it gradually grew heavier, its base too weighty to lift. When he wiped it with a clean cloth and examined it in the light, he saw its features faintly shimmering with a golden radiance. Realizing it was a solid gold statue, he estimated its weight at over fifty taels. The seller never returned for the remaining money.

Later, his three brothers, scheming to seize it, jointly filed a lawsuit with the prefecture, accusing Xian of concealing a fifty-tael gold Zhenwu statue from the family estate before the division and only producing it afterward for worship. The prefectural authorities summoned Tang Xian to surrender the hidden golden image. Xian explained that he had purchased it from a poor man. When the guarantor and witnesses were called, along with the original sales contract, it became clear that Tang Zhong and the others had fabricated the charges. They were each punished accordingly, and their fortunes declined. Thereafter, they daily came to Xian’s home to cause trouble. That night, Xian and his wife bid farewell to the golden image, and the next morning, they secretly deposited it in the prefectural treasury.

Later, when the surveillance commissioner reviewed the tribute funds, he noticed the golden Zhenwu statue in the official vault, its features faintly emanating an auspicious glow—a rare treasure. He reported it to the court. An imperial edict ordered Xuan Prefecture to dispatch it to the capital, where it was received into the inner palace as a *Protector of the Realm* treasure. The court also decreed that five hundred strings of cash be drawn from the prefecture’s summer tax funds and given to Tang Xian as compensation for the statue’s value. From then on, Xian grew wealthy, and his descendants prospered. As for Tang Zhong and the other two brothers, their households fell into poverty, and they died one after another, their descendants dwindling. All were later supported by Xian’s estate. The Taiji Abbey in Xuan Prefecture was built entirely through Tang Xian’s donations.

**Zhu’s Golden Brick**
In Xizhou, Lu Liang was addicted to wine and fond of killing, indulging in eels and loaches. His wife, née Zhu, repeatedly admonished him to no avail. She secretly entrusted her dowry to her parents’ home and commissioned an artisan to paint a scroll of Zhenwu. She invited the Daoist priest Qian Yingfang to perform scripture recitations and install the image, along with the rituals for the descent days. Yingfang instructed her: “In worshipping the福神, first, one must be sincerely devoted, not treating it lightly. On each descent day, burn and offer golden paper money and cloud horses; if possible, invite Daoists to recite scriptures. Second, do not return home drunk or raise your voice in disrespect. Third, strictly avoid consuming dog, soft-shelled turtle, eel, loach, garlic, or leeks. Fourth, show compassion to the poor, care for the elderly, honor your kin, and in all public and private matters, never deceive or flatter.”

Fifth, in speech and writing, strictly avoid taboo words and phrases, ever maintaining utmost sincerity without the slightest negligence. These five matters, observed with wholehearted devotion, ensure harmony and auspiciousness. Should doubts arise, seek and the response shall come. The gate is guarded by dragon spirits, the household flourishes with fortune and prosperity. But if one grows lax and disrespectful, lifespan and blessings diminish, undertakings falter, descendants dwindle, and official troubles multiply. Beware, beware.

Zhu-shi reverently upheld these precepts, but Lu Liang paid them no heed. Though he refrained from bringing eel home, he cooked and consumed it elsewhere, his mouth tainted with impure flesh. Though Zhu-shi faced demonic obstacles, her devotion only deepened. After fifteen years, Lu Liang fell gravely ill, bedridden for a full year. His livelihood crumbled, and as he lay on his mat, only a few writhing creatures—small as coiled serpents—were visible upon him. Then his skull festered, splitting open with putrid rot, oozing pus and blood in which three-inch segments of eel-like, glistening flesh writhed. They multiplied, swarming in and out, until one by one, all perished—his sons and daughters still unmarried. Meanwhile, Zhu-shi remained steadfast in her devotion at home, her reverence for Zhenwu’s incense and flame unwavering, never once faltering.

Though her livelihood had dwindled to mere daily sustenance, one day a single flower-patterned tile in the main hall of her home became exposed. Mistaking it for a stray street paver, Zhu-shi paid it no mind. That night, a radiance emanated from it, so she retrieved it—only to find it too heavy to lift alone. With her son’s help, she carried it home, scrubbed away the green moss, and discovered it was pure gold, gleaming with the deep luster of refined *zimo*.

Astonished, she dared not keep it, wrapping it instead in silk and brocade before presenting it to Prefectural Secretariat Censor Jiang Tingjian. She declared, “Since my husband’s death, I have been a destitute widow. I know not whence this gold came.” Tingjian, aware of her devotion to Zhenwu, understood it as a celestial gift. When weighed, it measured fourteen *jin*. Zhu-shi steadfastly refused to accept it, insisting it be turned over to the authorities. Citing the statute on found treasures, officials proposed dividing half for the state.

As goldsmiths were summoned to hammer and chisel the ingot, countless tiny crimson serpents and jade-green tortoises suddenly swarmed around the anvil. A larger serpent coiled upon the gold itself, lingering for some time before vanishing. Even as they lifted the gold to examine it, a thread-like serpent remained faintly visible within its surface. The prefectural officials, recognizing this as a divine sign, ruled the gold rightfully belonged to Zhu-shi. Yet she declined to keep it, leaving its disposition to the state. Prefect Jiang Tingjian and Vice Prefect Tian Kui jointly drafted a memorial, securing the gold in a casket and submitting it to the imperial court.

Upon review, it was noted that in Xizhou, Lu Liang had met his karmic retribution for reckless slaughter, serving as a warning to others. His wife, however, had devoted herself to virtue, and Zhenwu, moved by her sincerity, had bestowed this gold—a clear sign of heavenly favor, untainted by mortal alloy. The gold was then sent to the imperial workshops to be forged into a complete set of Zhenwu’s sacred images. These were entrusted to envoys and conveyed to the Jade Immortal Abbey atop Mount Wudang, where they were placed under the care of an imperial edict inscribed in gold. An annual endowment of ordination certificates was granted to sustain the abbey’s incense and rituals.

Zhu-shi herself was awarded an ordination certificate, along with two hundred *guan* of cash and bolts of silk from Xizhou as recompense. With the funds, she commissioned woodblock prints of Zhenwu’s *Illustrated Admonitions Against Killing*, distributing them to repay the nation’s grace and offer prayers for her late husband, Lu Liang. Her sons and daughters married, and she reopened her silk and cotton shop, restoring its former prosperity.

At the age of eighty-nine, Zhu-shi bathed one day, donned fresh garments, and intoned the sacred name of Zhenwu. Without illness, she passed away.

*Record of the Divine Manifestations of the Dark Heavenly Emperor, Scroll Two* concludes.
*Record of the Divine Manifestations of the Dark Heavenly Emperor, Scroll Three* begins.

**The Black-Backed Manifestation of the Sage**

In Baisha Village, Jiangdu County, Yangzhou, there lived a man named Wu Yuansi, whose family was wealthy and steadfast in accumulating good deeds. Each autumn and winter, they would employ spirit-mediums and shamans to burn offerings of *jiao* paper to the Three Realms, using the blood and flesh of living geese and ducks as sacrificial provisions. One day, Taoist Tang Qingyu of Tianqing Abbey in Taizhou arrived to register for alms-grain. Upon witnessing the family’s vow-fulfilling rites, he remarked: “How can the celestial courts of the heavens and the deities of the middle and lower realms be offered such mixed sacrifices of living beings? Would this not offend the gods of the heavens? How then could blessings be obtained?”

Yuansi asked: “How should the celestial courts be properly offered to? I humbly seek your instruction.”

Qingyu produced a ritual manual, prescribing only pure incense, lamps, candles, wine, fruit, clear tea, vegetarian dishes, willow branches, dharma-water, five-colored scattered flowers, golden paper *yunma* (cloud-horses), and neatly written memorial petitions. A single altar was to be prepared, round on the outside and square within, with no inclusion of the deities of the middle or lower realms. “If you perform these rites for seven years,” he said, “observe what signs may appear.”

The following year, Yuansi removed the deities of the middle and lower realms from his rites, continuing to rely on spirit-mediums for their festivals while inviting ordained Taoist priests to perform the *jiao* rites for the celestial courts. After several years, on the day of the *jiao* ceremony, over twenty wandering mendicants arrived seeking alms. Yuansi hosted them for a meal, then casually inquired where they had come from and what their livelihood was. One replied: “We dwell in the Boundless Heaven, come by the Boundless Path, engage in the Boundless Trade, and depart by the Boundless Way. Today, we learned of this celestial-prayer assembly here and have come to attend the *jiao* offerings.”

As they finished speaking, the twenty-odd men all transformed into clouds and mist, vanishing from sight. On one of the chairs, however, they left behind a short-sleeved, gold-threaded gauze vest with floral patterns—an object of extraordinary wonder. Realizing that celestial immortals had descended and left this heavenly garment as proof of their manifestation, Yuansi wrapped it in an embroidered silk cloth and stored it in a casket, preserving it as a family treasure for perpetual veneration. On the days when Zhenwu descended each month, the garment would emit a faint radiance. Yuansi’s descendants all enjoyed long lives.

Later, in accordance with imperial decree, Yangzhou conducted a census of venerable elders to invite them to the imperial birthday banquet. Among them, Yuansi’s family boasted descendants aged eighty, ninety, and even over a hundred. Of eight brothers, Wu Wan lived past one hundred, his steps still steady, his sight and hearing unimpaired. When the prefectural authorities inquired, they reported that in Wu Yuansi’s time, the family had lived in undivided harmony, faithfully observing the *jiao* rites. When the early vest of Zhenwu was presented as proof, Chen Shuping, the Grand Tutor and governor of Yangzhou, recorded the details and memorialized the throne. Subsequently, an imperial edict was issued, designating Wu Gui as the head of a “Righteous Household” and appointing him acting magistrate of the prefecture. Benevolence was bestowed upon the family’s main gate, where two “Righteous Compliance” earthen platforms were erected, along with ornamental pillars and crane-topped columns to honor their gate. The vest left by Zhenwu—a relic of the deity’s manifestation—was to be preserved as a household treasure, never to be damaged or discarded.

**The Pure Kerchief for Karmic Affinity**

At the Shanjian Chan Monastery in the Western Capital, there was a novice monk named Yunfang who, from a young age, had served the abbot with diligence. Due to various duties and circumstances, his tonsure had been repeatedly delayed. One day, someone offered Yunfang a divination, declaring: “Before you turn forty, you must take the tonsure.”

Later, while assigned to the monastery gate, Yunfang was tasked with soliciting donations of four hundred handkerchiefs for the monks’ summer baths. Passing by the foot of Qufu Mountain near the Western Ditch, he saw a youth in black robes washing his feet by the stream. As Yunfang approached, the youth fled in alarm. Yunfang pursued him until they reached a grove dense with blossoming trees, where countless demons of the Six Paths sat encircling the area. The youth stood where mortal offerings were laid, while the True Lord Zhenwu, incarnate, sat upon a rock, reviewing good and evil, resolving grievances, and dispatching souls to Dongyue for rebirth.

Unwilling to draw near, Yunfang was about to turn back when the youth he had seen earlier called out: “The True Lord summons Yunfang.” Approaching and bowing before the deity, Yunfang was asked about the handkerchiefs he had been collecting. The deity recorded the names in a memorial scroll, then said: “Lest you struggle to find my abode, I shall have this youth give you one of my personal pure kerchiefs as a token of karmic affinity. But you must not recklessly give it to just anyone, nor claim it was obtained from me here. If you reveal heavenly secrets, you will immediately be struck mute.”

Yunfang bowed in gratitude and took the kerchief back to the monastery, claiming it had been donated by an anonymous benefactor at Qufu Mountain. When he unfurled it, the kerchief measured eight *chi* in length, unlike any ordinary cloth. It felt as smooth as silk tassels, warm to the touch in cold places and cool in warmth. Its threads were seamless, its weave flawless, and when turned over, it shimmered with golden light and emitted a rare fragrance.

Yunfang carefully carried it to the Hall of Illustrious Literature to consult with Li Zhongfu, the University Scholar and overseer of the Western Capital’s administrative office, who advised him to memorialize the throne. Soon after, an imperial edict arrived, summoning Yunfang to the capital with the kerchief. Upon reaching the palace, he was questioned at the foot of the throne. The kerchief, he was told, was a treasure found nowhere else—neither in the celestial palaces, the dragon abodes, nor the oceanic vaults—save in the hands of heavenly maidens or the phoenix-crested dragons of the skies.

The ministers proposed: “If we wish to learn the full account from this man, we must first grant him tonsure as a monk; only then will he speak freely.” The emperor assented. Overcome with gratitude, Yunfang could no longer conceal the truth and began to recount the events. Before he could finish a single sentence, his voice faltered, his speech slurred, and he was struck mute—proof that the divine retribution had been immediate.

The original kerchief was retained for use in the inner palace’s ritual hall, while Yunfang was ordered to remain in the capital, where he was granted a monastery residence.

The Song dynasty unified the realm and established its supreme rule. Later, at Yingzhou’s Gaoyang Pass, the court received a divine gift of over fifty thousand strings of cash from Zhenwu, the Perfected Warrior of Profound Kindness, which were duly allocated as rewards for Emperor Taizu. Mindful of this, and learning that among the foreign merchants of Yingzhou was a man named Yishou Xian, one of seven brothers—Yishou being the name inscribed on the temple plaque at the frontier shrine—the emperor noted that the seven were celestial spirits descended from the Seven Luminaries, though the meaning of their shared surname, Yi, remained unknown. He promptly ordered Yingzhou to select a site and construct a temple hall dedicated to the Northern Culmen’s Seven Origins and Four Saints. Once the heavenly courts had been painted and adorned, he dispatched a high minister bearing imperial incense to offer sacrifices.

One day at the hour of chen, as the assembled officials accompanied the emperor to the Hall of Illuminating Virtue to deliberate on the submission of the various kings and marquises who had yet to yield their territories, a sudden storm of wind, hail, and swirling clouds arose. The ministers scattered in flight, leaving only Chancellor Zhao Pu at the emperor’s side. Two youths then appeared, guiding them into the Filial Accomplishment Hall. After Taizu had sat for some time, a divine figure materialized in the clouds before the hall: crowned with a starry diadem, robed in embroidered gold, and bearing a tablet, the deity bowed deeply and addressed the emperor:

*“A new era dawns for your august foundation,
Like Yao and Shun, you must rely on worthy men.
Beware the folly of later rulers who seize the throne,
Lest treacherous rebels stain and disrupt your reign.”*

“I am Zhenwu, the Numinous and Responsive Perfected Lord of the Northern Culmen in the Heavenly Capital. I have received your gracious gift of a temple hall in Yingzhou and your subsequent offerings of thanksgiving. Passing by on my celestial patrol, I have come to express my gratitude. I hear that some kings and marquises still cling to their domains, refusing submission. Recently, I witnessed the Supreme Emperor’s decree: all under heaven is fated to be unified under the Song, ensuring an eternal imperial legacy. Beyond the Huai and Han rivers, which have already been reclaimed, the remaining regions are destined to fall in sequence, each within its appointed time—no more than twelve years in all. The order shall begin with Hedong, followed by Southern Tang, Western Shu, Guangdong, Fujian, and finally the Two Zhe. Each must be brought under the realm in turn.”

With that, Zhenwu took his leave and returned to the celestial precincts. Taizu and Zhao Pu then rejoined their attendants, who had been guarding the Hall of Illuminating Virtue in anticipation. The emperor’s heart swelled with joy and reassurance. He selected an auspicious day to hold a grand offering within the inner palace, in humble gratitude for the divine favor. Thereafter, every event unfolded precisely as the sacred counsel had foretold. The imperial fortune was renewed in splendor.

The scholar-official Fu Hong of Yangzhou in Huaidong, a presented scholar, had observed the precepts all his life and had served Zhenwu for over thirty years. In all his conduct, he practiced convenience for others, earning universal praise. Eminent gentlemen and great officials all presented him with poems and calligraphy, and carriages and horses thronged his gate like a marketplace. Reflecting on this, Fu Hong thought that such worldly engagement greatly hindered his Daoist cultivation. He therefore abandoned his home and wandered as a cloud-rover until he reached the Supreme Clarity Great Peace Palace on Mount Zhongnan in Shaanxi, where he sought a monastic cell to take up the religious life. Zhang Shouzhen, the superintendent of the palace, seeing Fu Hong’s refined and ancient bearing, kept him at the abbey as a master of transcendental cultivation and prepared a separate chamber for him. For three years, Fu Hong reverently served the Highest Perfected Ones with incense and devotion. One night, after the Daoist assembly had retired to rest, Zhang Shouzhen secretly approached Fu Hong’s cell and heard him speaking in his sleep as if conversing with someone. Suddenly, a streak of firelight issued from within the cell, and Zhang Shouzhen marveled at the sight.

The next morning, he gathered the assembly and questioned Fu Hong about the firelight of the previous night. Fu Hong replied, “My allotted time has now come, and I cannot prolong it.” He then bathed, changed his robes, ascended the Daoist hall, and received the embodied descent and message of Zhenwu the Perfected Lord: “Now convey this to the Son of Heaven of the Song: *In the first, third, and second months, peach blossoms paint the sky in hue; / All at once, the true auspice shines bright and new. / The golden branch renews the mandate’s splendor grand; / The season calls to welcome the barefoot immortal’s hand.*” The true words declared, “Convey only these twenty-eight characters; I depart now.” Fu Hong awoke as if from sleep, unable to fathom their meaning.

The following day, Fu Hong secretly fled, his whereabouts unknown. Zhang Shouzhen, having received the Perfected Lord’s descended message, dared not conceal it. He traveled to Shaanxi and reported in person to the military commissioner and pacification envoy, Zhang Xigu, who then submitted a memorial to the throne. When the emperor beheld it, astonishment and joy mingled in his heart. Later, on the *gengxu* year, the *xinsi* month, and the *xinchou* day, the Crown Prince of Auspicious Descent was born in the Hall of Illuminating Virtue—this was Emperor Renzong. The barefoot immortal, Heavenly Lord of the Jade City, had descended, fulfilling Zhenwu’s prophecy. In anticipation of this blessed cause, an imperial edict was issued to Fengxiang Prefecture to search for Fu Hong, but he was nowhere to be found. A subsequent edict commanded the reconstruction of the Zhenwu Precious Pavilion at the Supreme Clarity Great Peace Palace and the establishment of a shrine to Fu Hong, who was posthumously enfeoffed as the Perfected One of Victorious Karma. One hundred bolts of silk and one hundred taels of silver were bestowed upon his family in recompense. The celestial spear bore its mark.

During the *Mingdao* era, Wang Ze rebelled in Beizhou. The Bureau of Military Affairs selected and commissioned Wen Yanbo, Minister of War and Pacification Commissioner of the Baoxin Army, to suppress the uprising. Upon his return, the Grand Preceptor reported: "The rebel Wang Ze and his band have been utterly exterminated—not by my own merit. Upon arriving in Meizhou, I saw to the east of the southern city gate a *huabiao* pillar inscribed with 'Perfection of Rounded Response.' The plaque above the hall read 'Hall of Zhenwu,' so I entered to offer prayers, beseeching divine aid. Upon reaching Beizhou, twenty *li* from the city, I first dispatched my generals to demand the surrender of three of Wang Ze’s lieutenants. During the battle, my fourth commander, Ling Song, led the vanguard to engage the enemy, driving Wang Ze back into Beizhou, where he shut the gates and refused to emerge. Though we prepared to besiege and storm the city, I hesitated to destroy it outright, as it was imperial territory, and so we waited. After twenty days, a sudden violent storm erupted over Beizhou, hurling sand and hail like arrows loosed from bows. The rebel forces were flung from the walls, some dead, some barely alive. Before we knew it, the city gates swung open, and our troops surged in. All who bore arms were slaughtered, sparing only the civilians. Wang Ze was captured before my horse, his head severed from his body. I then appointed an official to oversee the city’s governance before returning in triumph. I revisited the Hall of Perfection of Rounded Response to pay homage to Zhenwu and offer a grand *jiao* sacrifice in gratitude. Upon closer inspection, I saw to Zhenwu’s left a statue of an armored attendant, bound in fetters, named the Celestial Stem General. An arrow pierced his left arm to a depth of three *cun*, bearing Wang Ze’s military insignia. When I removed the arrow, pus and blood flowed forth. I mixed fragrant clay to dress the wound, then retrieved the arrow itself. Upon returning, I presented it to the court for examination by the Ministry of Rites under the Three Departments. An envoy was dispatched with imperial incense to offer sacrifices, and the hall was ordered to be repaired and expanded. After its completion, a separate imperial decree commanded a *jiao* rite of thanksgiving. In recognition of Beizhou’s deliverance by this profound grace, it was renamed Enzhou.

The *River Chariot* bore the scabbard.

At the Supreme Clarity Abbey on Mount Lu in Nankang Commandery, a petition by Zhang You of the Sui dynasty had established the Hall of Zhenwu and the Hall of the Divine Father and Holy Mother’s Descent. Since then, its numinous responses had been manifold. At that time, Emperor Liezu convened his ministers, seeking to secure the submission of Fujian."

The ministers memorialized: "Fujian’s terrain is rugged and its people cunning; only military force can subdue it." Thereupon, Emperor Liezu personally led the campaign. As the army neared its destination, a sudden gale arose, blackening the sky with fog, while venomous serpents and fierce beasts blocked the road, halting the advance of weapons and troops. Emperor Liezu then burned incense and prayed to the heavens. Suddenly, amidst the clouds and mist, a divine figure appeared, bowing deeply before him and saying: "Your servant is the local earth deity of Xianyuan Abbey on Mount Min in Fuzhou. By order of Zhenwu of this abbey, I have come to the frontier to receive you. I know that Your Majesty has raised an army to take Fujian. Yet Fujian’s allotted destiny is not yet exhausted—it is already decreed that in the *gengwu* year, it shall directly submit to the Supreme One. It is not for the Southern Tang to seize. I have come to admonish you: if Your Majesty’s troops cross mountains and rivers, countless lives will be lost beneath the blades of war." After a long while, the deity vanished, and the wind and fog instantly cleared. Emperor Liezu thus withdrew his forces and, upon reaching the Hall of Descent on Mount Lu, offered sacrifices. There, he saw a retainer standing to the right, holding a sword scabbard. Pointing, he inquired, and the Daoist assembly replied: "That is the *River Chariot*." Emperor Liezu sighed: "This must be the same divine figure who appeared on the road—their appearance was identical."

Later, upon returning to the Shangqing Palace in the capital, Emperor Liezu had halls built for Zhenwu, the Divine Father, and the Holy Mother, modeled after those of the Supreme Clarity Abbey on Mount Lu, and ordered officials to maintain their incense and offerings. When Fujian’s spies learned that the Southern Tang army had reached their border but then retreated, they suspected an ambush. They dispatched envoys to the Southern Tang to investigate. In his reply, Emperor Liezu detailed his encounter on the road with a divine figure who claimed to be the earth deity of Xianyuan Abbey, sent by Zhenwu to report that Fujian’s allotted destiny was not yet exhausted—it was fated to submit to the Supreme One in the *gengwu* year, not to the Southern Tang. Moved by these words, he had abandoned the campaign.

The Ma clan of Fujian, learning of Xianyuan Abbey’s manifest numinosity in protecting their borders, received the letter and grew doubtful. Though the *gengwu* year was still distant, they convened their ministers to deliberate: if the year had already been decreed for submission to the Supreme One, what omen foretold its allegiance? Unable to fathom the matter, they chose an auspicious day and assembled all officials to pray at Xianyuan Abbey before Zhenwu, beseeching a divine response regarding the meaning of submission in the *gengwu* year. By the grace of the deity, the answer came: the Supreme One was the rising fortune of the Zhou dynasty, of the Tian Shui surname, who would unify the realm, and all states would yield their lands. The Dragon Ascendancy Hall was thus named for the Supreme One. Thereupon, King Ma of Fujian made peace with the Southern Tang, and hostilities ceased.

**The King of Shu Submits**
At Chongming Abbey in Cizhou, Zhenwu’s divine manifestations had blessed Zhen Ding and over twenty other prefectures for more than twenty years, bestowing sacred gifts of grain totaling over 150,000 *hu*, which were distributed to relieve famine. After deducting the funds received by Cizhou for the abbey’s repairs, the remaining sums from other prefectures also amounted to tens of thousands. With no other expenditures, a memorial was submitted to the throne for approval. A subsequent imperial decree ordered the Hebei Transport Bureau to forward the grain and wheat payments to the capital to establish the Abbey of the Four Saints, bestowing upon it the name *Four Saints Purple Ultimate Abbey*. A grand *jiao* rite for all under heaven was held, and an amnesty was proclaimed, its blessings reaching the Four Saints and all divine observers.

At that time, the court was preparing to conquer Shu, when suddenly one night a fierce wind swept through the palace halls. By lamplight, Emperor Taizu saw a yellow-robed warrior, who declared himself a *fushi* attendant of the Four Saints of the Northern Ultimate. He said: "Were it not for the Four Saints’ divine intervention, the King of Shu would not yet have considered submission. He has now presented the *Revered Atlas of the Land* to Envoy Hou Yuanzhi and his party, who are returning to the capital to present it. Your Majesty need not worry." The warrior continued: "By Zhenwu’s command, I report that the Heavenly Marshals Tianpeng, Tianyou, and Heisha, having witnessed the King of Shu’s submission, have already returned to the heavens. Only Zhenwu remains, fearing further hesitation in the west. He now waits in the clouds; Your Majesty should swiftly dispatch officials and troops to receive him. Immediately order the relevant bureaus to take charge of Shu’s borders." With that, the *fushi* vanished.

The next morning at court, an urgent report arrived: the King of Shu had submitted.

Thus, the Grand Ancestor subsequently held a grand jiao offering at the Four Saints Temple to express gratitude. The feudatories made peace, and at Xiongzhou in Hebei—a critical pass at the Cui Barrier—beyond the garrison of two hundred thousand cavalry and infantry, there were two thousand *ganyong* brave commoners serving as personal aides. Among them was Zhang Qi, who regularly made offerings to Zhenwu and had gained insight into the arts of *dunjia* and military strategy.

During the Kangding era, the shallow tribes of the northern frontier, led by Hu Zhicong and others, invaded the Cui Barrier at Xiongzhou. At the time, Wang Nai served as Military Commissioner and Pacification Envoy. He ordered the *ganyong* to resist the enemy, and they indeed achieved victory. Zhang Qi divined that the barbarian troops would return that very night to invade, predicting that a *xun* wind would rise, following the *ren* and *gui* directions, and that this would be an omen, along with the threat of fire. The authorities dispatched troops to guard the area. As expected, at the second watch, tens of thousands of barbarian soldiers breached the border moat. Zhang Qi unfastened his *dunjia* secret texts, invoked the divine power of Zhenwu, and performed a ritual to conceal their forms. At the Cui Barrier, the barbarians were captured, and Hu Zhiyuan, having received mercy, was released.

Upon returning to the camp, Zhang Qi felt his head grow hot and his body cold, realizing he had been protected by the divine presence of Zhenwu, the Perfected Lord of the True Warrior, of the Song dynasty. The barbarians, too, had once made offerings to Zhenwu, but their transgressions had rendered the deity unresponsive. Now, with Xiliang City having submitted and made peace, they harbored no further intent to rebel, lest they again incur divine wrath. They presented their lands and requested that Zhenwu’s presence be bestowed upon them, to be enshrined and worshipped according to custom.

By imperial decree, the Four Saints Temple was ordered to compile records of Zhenwu’s descents and to establish all rites and offerings in response. The lands presented were to be registered in Xiongzhou, and Hu Zhicong and Hu Zhiyuan were to be detained. From then on, peace prevailed, and warfare ceased. As a result, the garrison at Xiongzhou was reduced by a third, and the troops were rewarded. The emperor commanded that golden registers and grand jiao offerings be held in the renowned grotto-heavens of the northwest to express his imperial devotion and seek the favor of the sagely gaze.

When Chen Zhaoyi of Xuzhou served as Vice Prefect of Mingzhou, he traveled to Tiantong Mountain and saw a statue of Zhenwu carved into the rock, painted in red and green, standing in a dusty and neglected spot along the mountain path. The tortoise at its base had all four feet broken, and passersby paid it no heed. Zhaoyi provided funds to hire craftsmen to restore the sacred image, repairing the tortoise’s feet and constructing a small hall to shelter it.

After Zhaoyi was relieved of his post, he was by the West Gate Lake when he saw a Daoist priest approaching across the water, knocking on his boat to request an audience. Zhaoyi was slow to emerge, and the priest turned away, saying, “I came only to express my gratitude for restoring my form.” Zhaoyi realized this was Zhenwu’s divine manifestation, a response to his restoration of the stone statue on Tiantong Mountain. He then painted a scroll of Zhenwu to enshrine and worship. Later, he rose to the rank of Vice Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices and was appointed Prefect of Xuzhou.

While suffering from a foot ailment and seeking medical treatment, he stayed in Teng County. Suddenly, the court sent an inspector, and upon his recovery, he was appointed Vice Transport Commissioner of the Qinfeng Circuit. Zhaoyi, aware of the critical importance of logistics in the western frontier, carried the image of Zhenwu with him for protection.

At the time, Military Commissioner Cen Yuanyou was short of provisions and intended to hold the Transport Bureau accountable. Suddenly, a Daoist priest appeared in the military camp selling medicinal food. The soldiers, suspecting him of being a Western barbarian spy, brought him before the camp authorities. After some time, someone shouted that a fire had broken out in the eastern granary, and it was quickly extinguished.

At dawn after the prolonged standoff, the Northern Barbarians had lost over ten thousand troops. Zhang Qi personally captured the barbarian general Hu Zhiyuan, who confessed that he was the lord of Xiliang in the Northern Barbarians’ territory and the younger brother of Hu Zhicong, the regional military governor. The two brothers divided a stretch of twelve hundred *li*, bordering Xiongzhou, with his elder brother now subject to the Northern Barbarians. Both had long resided in Xiongzhou’s border market, profiting from trade and tribute, but their allegiance had shifted to the Great Dynasty, inciting resentment. For two years, they had gathered troops to disrupt the market but found no opportunity. Zhiyuan then devised a plan to mobilize a hundred thousand soldiers for a nighttime raid. Yet when he entered the market to set fires, he felt as though his head were split by an axe and his body drenched in water. He saw ghostly spirits in the clouds seizing the flames, half-extinguishing them and scattering them into the air. Another divine general, disheveled and wielding a sword, shouted at him to halt. As Zhiyuan fled, a giant serpent blocked his path, and from behind, a tortoise clamped onto him, allowing Zhang Qi to seize him. Zhiyuan pleaded for his life, vowing that within a month, he and his brother Zhicong would present a sworn oath of surrender. Wang Mian convened the officials to deliberate, and they released Hu Zhiyuan to return to his territory. A memorial was submitted to the throne, and an imperial decree ordered a grand jiao ritual at the Four Saints Temple in the capital. A Hall of Gratitude to Zhenwu was also built at Xiongzhou’s border market, with Daoist priests appointed to conduct rituals, and a stele was commissioned to record Zhang Qi’s valor. Zhang Qi was specially appointed as *Youban Dianzhi*, while Xiongzhou remained a bulwark against the Northern Barbarians.

The military governor of Xiliang, Hu Zhicong, dispatched Zhao Jiming to the court with a memorial. Xiongzhou sent an official to the border to receive him, and after further deliberation, a messenger was dispatched posthaste to report to the Chancellery. Hu Zhicong, a minor chieftain ruling a frontier region, had recently launched an attack on the border market. Had it not been for Zhang Qi’s courage, mastery of *dunjia*, and invocation of Zhenwu’s divine aid—capturing Hu Zhiyuan before releasing him to secure his surrender—this outcome would not have been possible. Now, with another envoy arriving, he was to be received and interrogated in Xiongzhou before a memorial was submitted. Commissioner Wang Mian escorted Zhao Jiming into the city, where he offered to cede a hundred and forty *li* of millet-producing land with six hundred households, along with a formal memorial.

During the raid on the market, the leader of the raiding party turned out to be a former attendant of Chen Zhaoyi, surnamed Pei, who had learned this method and saved countless starving people. Fearing punishment from the military commissioner for his master’s actions and concerned about delays in grain provisions, he had come to sell miraculous elixirs, assuring them it would not disrupt operations. Cen Yuanyou tested the medicine on several critically wounded men, who reported feeling satiated. The Daoist took a gourd ladle and handed it to Yuanyou, saying, “I also have a bag of this medicine and intend to sell it to General Li of the Western Front.” Yuanyou, astonished, examined the ladle and found over thirty thousand doses—enough to sustain an entire army. At the bottom of the ladle was a slip of paper inscribed: *“This is the divine method of Pei the Perfected, from the household of Vice Minister of Rites Chen Zhaoyi. When consumed by soldiers and horses, it allows three days without food, sparing the need for grain provisions.”*

Later, General Li of the Western Barbarians sent word that a spy had sold him a “wind medicine for setting bones,” which, when taken by tens of thousands of his men, left them paralyzed and unable to fight. He pledged to withdraw his forces. Yuanyou, having secured victory without effort, wrote a report on the miraculous response. The Daoist, surnamed Pei, had been born in the household of Minister Pei during the reign of Empress Wu of Tang and had retained the surname. After several memorials from Yuanyou, the Three Departments deliberated and rewarded the officers in order of merit. Chen Zhaoyi was promoted to Vice Minister of Rites, and the gourd ladle and inscribed paper received by Yuanyou were deposited in the Tianzhang Pavilion, with an edict issued for their nationwide dissemination. A seven-day jiao ritual was held at Tianqing Temple, and funds were allocated for the renovation of Zhenwu temples. A memorial was presented to the court.

In the Eastern Capital’s Purple Ultimate Four Saints Temple, a young acolyte named Hong Zhibian had renounced the secular world. Daily, he swept the temple gates, halls, and corridors, and at night, he laid out his bedding to sleep in the corridor. The Four Saints were painted on the walls of the Purple Ultimate Hall, and beyond the temple’s regular offerings, Zhibian daily begged for alms to purchase sandalwood and incense for his devotions, though twenty years passed without recompense.

In the second year of the Zhihe era, the capital was blanketed in snow. Late one night, Zhibian saw a Daoist selling medicine outside the gate, resting his head on a rush bag on the damp ground. Fearing the wind and snow would harm him, Zhibian called him inside and shared his bedding. At dawn, the Daoist prepared to leave, and Zhibian said, “After eating, I grow drowsy—it must be a spleen ailment. Might I have a dose or two?” The Daoist shook his gourd, revealing several pills, and handed it to Zhibian, instructing him to wait until midnight, face north, recite the name of the Golden Portal Perfected Seven times, and swallow one pill, keeping the rest for emergencies. The Daoist vanished upon leaving.

That night, Zhibian took one dose and no longer craved food. Word spread through the capital that Zhibian had encountered an immortal and ceased eating. Princes, ministers, and officials verified the account, which reached the emperor’s ears. The Kaifeng Prefecture and the Censorate were ordered to investigate the circumstances, particularly the mention of the Golden Portal Perfected. Upon inquiry, it was revealed to be the title of Zhenwu’s original master, the Most High Lord Lao. At the time, the capital’s populace had long suffered from snow and pestilence. Zhibian distributed the pills from the gourd, intending to save a few, but the gourd’s contents never diminished, healing over forty thousand people. The medicine remained inexhaustible, and all who took it recovered.

The Censorate memorialized, requesting that Hong Zhibian be specially granted a monastic ordination certificate and permitted to wear the robes. Additionally, a grand Daoist ritual and vegetarian feast were to be held at his home temple to repay the grace of his encounter with the divine. **Clearing the Snow and Aiding the Journey**

The defense commissioner of Xiongzhou, Dai Kui—concurrently deputy commander of the Palace Armies—was dispatched to lead one hundred thousand troops to Annam. Upon reaching Yongzhou, they were met with heavy snow, forcing them to halt for half a month. Provisions ran short, and many froze to death. A military aide named Fang Zong reported: "In the depths of winter, the roads are buried under six feet of snow, and transport is cut off. To save the lives of men and horses, we must pray to the Perfected Warrior, the Blessed Divinity, for clear skies." Fang Zong had brought a painted image of the deity with him. Dai Kui prepared offerings and, facing the portrait of Zhenwu, made a sincere vow. No sooner had he burned the memorial paper than the skies cleared, clouds dispersed, and the sun shone, opening the roads. They reached Annam and achieved complete victory. By imperial decree, a seven-day ritual was held at the newly built Baoying Pavilion of Zhenwu to give thanks.

**Calming the Storm and Rescuing the Fleet**

In the twelfth month of the second year of Tiansheng, Long Mengxi, a patrol inspector of Meijiang in Laizhou, illegally carried weapons while suppressing smuggling. Conspiring with his soldiers, he extorted wealth from coastal residents for personal gain. When his crimes were exposed, officials were sent to investigate. Instead of submitting, he plotted rebellion with his troops, fled to sea with his family, and began pillaging merchant ships, killing and wounding many. He disrupted markets and gathered hundreds of pirates, making suppression nearly impossible. Local authorities reported the emergency, and the court dispatched Lu Feng, the chief patrol inspector of Dengzhou, with a thousand elite naval soldiers to quell the uprising. Later, Lu Feng was cornered by Gong Mengxi in the deep waters near Mount Jianshan. After five days without provisions, they found no escape. Recalling his family’s devotion to Zhenwu, whose prayers were always answered, Lu Feng, in desperation, cried out: "Zhenwu, come to our aid!" That night, as the soldiers sat in their boats, the tide suddenly surged, and winds whipped the waves into a frenzy. From Gong Mengxi’s fleet came shouts and the clamor of battle, but a thick fog obscured Lu Feng’s ships. By dawn, floating corpses lay before Lu Feng’s vessels, along with wrecked warships half-sunk in the shallows. Upon inspection, they were Gong Mengxi and his family, all dead. Twenty-odd survivors were captured and bound, their leader’s head severed by Lu Feng’s sailors. The prisoners were taken to the Qingzhou Pacification and Surveillance Commission for interrogation. That night, amidst dark clouds, divine generals, ghostly soldiers, venomous snakes, and fierce beasts filled the sky in indescribable chaos. The prefectural authorities, recognizing the descent of sacred power, reported the event to all relevant offices. Pacification Commissioner Liang Jia memorialized the throne, and by imperial decree, Lu Feng was promoted to *Chongyi* Envoy. Additionally, a decree ordered the construction of a temple at the Meijiang patrol station in Laizhou, where an image of Zhenwu and his divine generals and celestial soldiers would be enshrined, named the "Temple of Battle and Gratitude."

**Divine Arrows and Falling Dust**

During the Tianxi era, Fang Zicai, Vice Minister of War and concurrently Military Commissioner of Yingzhou and Gaoyang Pass, memorialized his arrival at his post three months prior. On the night of the sixteenth day of the eighth month of the first year, over two thousand men led by Lu Jicheng, chieftain of the Qiantan Pingwu Stockade, invaded the border and seized over four thousand *shi* of grain and fodder from Qingmu Fortress. The pass dispatched Commander Zou Shu and Aide Liu Yi with two thousand troops to demand an explanation. The next day, ten thousand tribal soldiers arrived, led by a general who declared: "I am Yan Lianxin, sent by the Northern Yan King Nie Huqi. Qingmu Fortress annually collects over ten million *shi* of military grain and fodder, so twenty thousand troops were dispatched to seize it. Upon reaching Pingwu Stockade, its chieftain Lu Jicheng proposed raiding Qingmu Fortress on the night of the sixteenth, when they would be unprepared." Zou Shu replied: "The Great Yan Emperor has made peace. How dare the Northern Yan King Nie Huqi act without authorization? We do not wish to report this to the court. Instead, send envoys to Yan to return the stolen grain and fodder to Qingmu Fortress." Yan Lianxin refused, leading to battle, in which the tribal forces were routed. Nie Huqi then led over two hundred thousand troops to encircle the northwest gates of Yingzhou, halting half a mile from the moat for six days. On the seventh day—the ninth day of the ninth month—a sudden ground-level gale arose, accompanied by swirling rain and mist. The tribal forces could be heard retreating in panic. Pursuing soldiers found Zou Shu and others in the grassy paths, along with several wounded tribesmen. Fang Zicai interrogated one, who said: "We do not know what deity resides in your city. At the northwest gates, a ground-shaking gale kicked up sand and dust, blinding us. We heard the sound of arrows raining down like a storm, and countless pythons chased and bit men and horses. Nie Huqi cried out once from his horse before ordering a retreat. We were bitten by snakes and struck by arrows, unable to flee, and were captured." Upon examining the wounds, they found only snakebites and arrow wounds, with no visible entry points—clear signs of divine intervention. Within ten days, a border patrol brought two tribal officers with a sealed leather tube addressed to "Fang, Vice Minister of War and Military Commissioner of Yingzhou and Gaoyang Pass." The message read: "Henceforth, we dare not dispatch troops without authorization."

Nie Huqi was struck by an arrow in his right eye. When the arrowhead was retrieved, it crumbled to ash in his hand. As if from a mural or amid the whirling dust, venomous serpents, divine spirits, and spectral beings manifested, routing over two hundred thousand tribal soldiers. We know not which deity this pass venerates, yet its efficacy is beyond doubt. We now seal and send one divine arrow, that your generals may verify the temple’s name and report back, beseeching protection for our eyes and well-being.

Fang Zhicai examined the arrow closely and found it indeed matched the mural’s depiction. He searched all palaces, Daoist abbeys, temples, and shrines, yet none bore such a painting. Later, at the newly built Shouxian Temple south of the prefecture, he found on the central wall a portrait of the North Star’s Purple Tenuity Emperor, flanked by the Four Saints—all clad in golden armor, standing erect, each bearing a quiver. In Zhenwu’s quiver, one arrow was missing. Comparing the arrow sent from the tribal lands with the mural’s hue, they matched perfectly. Fang Zhicai lit incense and personally fitted the mural’s arrow into the vacant slot in the quiver, where it settled seamlessly, leaving only the faintest seam as proof.

His office documented the circumstances and dispatched an envoy to the tribal lands to present the findings. The court sent imperial incense to Shouxian Temple in Yingzhou for a grand jiao offering. It further decreed that all abbeys nationwide lacking a Zhenwu Hall must construct one, and rewarded Gaoyang Pass accordingly.

**Divine Spears and Bamboo Blades**
Su Xian, Prefect of Binzhou, submitted a posthumous memorial accusing the Anfu Commissioner of Guizhou of failing to dispatch reinforcements against the southern barbarians, leading to the death of the garrison commander. After Su Xian’s death, the tax supervisor Wang Bao was assigned to patrol the city. At midnight, he scaled the walls and moat in a clandestine escape. Caught in a thunderstorm, he fled into the forest, where several divine figures seized him and demanded, “Who dares sneak away?” He replied, “Wang Bao, tax supervisor of Binzhou, fled in fear of his lord’s peril.” They rebuked him: “In times of peace, you coveted rank and emolument, recklessly accepting the state’s bounty. In its hour of crisis, you fled in cowardice. You deserve death.”

**Divine Spears and Bamboo Blades (continued)**

The city’s people could not bear to suffer unjust slaughter, yet no reinforcements had arrived. Thus, the gods lent Wang Bao a divine spear and fifty foot soldiers, commanding him to pursue the southern barbarians under the cover of the night’s thunderstorm. Wang Bao protested, “I have never trained in martial arts. How can fifty men withstand thousands of barefoot, ferocious savages?” Unsure which sage or deity addressed him, he begged for guidance. A voice from the clouds replied, “Take the spear, lead the fifty men, and act swiftly. Should you succeed, glory and honor await. If the state demands an account, say it was the Northern Three Yuan Patrol General who aided you.” Wang Bao accepted the spear in the dark, led the soldiers from the forest, and followed the lightning’s glow. Upon reaching the barbarian camp, a single thunderclap struck terror into the enemy, sending the entire encampment into chaotic infighting. By dawn, the barbarian forces had fled to the sea’s edge, two hundred and fifty *li* from Binzhou. When the celestial troops arrived that night, over half the barbarians had already escaped by raft across the sea, but the divine soldiers scattered the rest, leaving not a single foe behind. The city of Binzhou was spared from bloodshed.

The military commanders, learning of these events, reported them to the court. After reviewing Su Xian’s posthumous memorial, the throne granted Wang Bao an imperial reward. As he had been acting under the authority of Zhenwu, the Martial and Virtuous Deity, in his role as Protector of the State and Savior of the People, Wang was promoted to *Chongyi* Envoy. The divine spear he had wielded was examined and found to be identical to the bamboo blades used by the barbarians—proof of the福神 (*fúshén*, fortune deity) seizing victory through swift, decisive action. The court ordered the construction of the *Bao’en Huguo* Temple in Binzhou to honor Zhenwu, with annual rites performed by a Daoist priest in gratitude for the unseen aid.

**Divine Beasts and Lightning**

In the first year of *Tianyou*, Qian Yan, Acting Military Commissioner of Xingyuan Prefecture, submitted a memorial reporting that, by order of the Bureau of Military Affairs, he had been appointed Pacification and Campaign Commissioner of the Yong-Yan Circuit to repel the Western Tibetan forces of Zhao Tianyu. Upon assuming command of over forty thousand troops, he faced an enemy host of three hundred thousand. The disparity in strength filled him with dread, and though he had urgently petitioned the court, he feared the situation might yet take an unfavorable turn.

Among his officers was Yuan Zheng, a military inspector well-versed in the *Xuan’gang* method of the Northern Dipper. For over twenty years, Yuan had faithfully served the Northern Pole Patrol General Zhenwu, and now he requested permission to perform rites before the marshal’s tent. Qian Yan, devout in his own right, composed a memorial detailing the dire circumstances and his reliance on unseen aid. That night, Yuan Zheng hung the Zhenwu icon on his back, performed the ritual burning of petitions, and offered prayers to the Northern Pole’s Four Saints and the Stellar Deities of the Primordial Epoch.

The next day, Zhao Tianyu sent ten thousand troops to challenge them. Qian dispatched his envoy, Sun Yi, to engage the Tibetan general in single combat, followed by a full-scale battle. As the second watch approached, both sides saw ten thousand streaks of fire flashing across the field. The Tibetan ranks were thrown into disarray—spears and banners snapped, bowstrings slipped, drums and gongs clamored in confusion, and soldiers fled like startled deer. The imperial troops pressed their advantage. By what seemed like dawn, the sixth commander, Qian Congji, returned with the severed head of Zhao Tianyu.

The soldiers recounted that during the night battle, they had seen countless grotesque figures with fish-gill faces and black, tattered robes, their hair wild and feet bare. Some drove winds and lightning, others herded serpents and beasts, cutting down the Tibetan forces with relentless fury. Tens of thousands of enemy corpses littered the field. Only one streak of fire pursued a lone rider, whom Qian Congji recognized as Zhao Tianyu, thus claiming his head. With a mere forty thousand men, they had faced two hundred thousand. Had Yuan Zheng not offered his rituals with utmost sincerity, invoking Zhenwu’s descent upon the battlefield—manifesting as ten thousand streaks of fire and myriad divine beasts—they would never have crushed the Tibetan host and captured its leader.

In recognition of this miraculous intervention, the Three Departments and the Ministry of Rites issued Yuan Zheng an official certificate of merit and awarded him five hundred strings of cash. A month-long Daoist ritual was held at the *Shangqing Lingying* Palace in the capital, along with a grand universal *jiao* offering. Qian Yan was promoted to *Xuanhui* Envoy with a concurrent rank.

**Toxic Bees and Misty Clouds**

The *Chongfu* Abbey in the Western Capital housed the Purple Tenuity Pavilion of the Northern Pole. Built during the reign of Empress Wu of Tang to emulate the celestial palace, it contained the Hall of Two Victories and Four Generals, adorned with imperial calligraphy from successive dynasties. Each year, it was overseen by venerable elders and high-ranking officials, its stewardship far from ordinary. Recently, the right eave of the pavilion had collapsed, damaging the sacred image within. Upon receiving the report, Minister of the Bureau of Judicature Fu Bi inspected the site with other officials and found a beam askew, striking Zhenwu’s right shoulder. Unwilling to authorize repairs without imperial approval, they prepared a memorial to request the throne’s decree.

Soon after, the eunuch Cen Jing arrived bearing incense and an edict, instructing the abbey’s administrators and the ministerial officials to assess the condition of Zhenwu’s sacred image in the Purple Tenuity Pavilion. The emperor, while in his private chambers, had seen a divine figure in a purple sash and golden belt, holding a tablet, who identified himself as the *Chuanzao* Earth Deity of the Purple Tenuity Pavilion in the Western Capital’s *Chongfu* Abbey. The deity declared, “I am the Numinous and Responsive Perfected Lord of the Northern Pole. During the campaign against the Western Tibetan chieftain Zhao Yuanhao, I transformed into black bees that swarmed the battlefield, aiding Marshal Pang Ji in securing victory. In performing this divine service to protect the state, my right arm was wounded. Had I not reported this, Your Majesty would have remained unaware.”

Having spoken thus, the deity departed.

At that time, though the western expeditionary officer Ma had not yet returned to court, Prefect Fu Bi had previously dispatched Cen Jing to report back. By imperial decree, a palace attendant and artisans from the Eight Workshops were dispatched, along with a gold-lettered plaque, to rebuild the structure within a year.

Minister of War and Grand Councilor Pang Ji, having been personally commissioned to lead the campaign against Zhao Yuanhao in the west, recounted: as the main army advanced upon Sanfeng Plain and engaged Zhao Yuanhao in direct combat for three watches, a sudden swarm of black and yellow bees arose like clouds, blanketing the fields and rushing toward the Western troops. Upon inspection, tens of thousands of Tibetan soldiers were found wounded and fallen, yet none bore wounds from blades or arrows. Some had only three to five dark marks on their faces, though they cried out in agony as if their very marrow were aflame. It was clear that an unimpeded and omnipotent divine force of the Song had manifested as venomous bees, far deadlier than arrows or stones.

Earlier, Zhao Yuanhao had been stung so severely that his head swelled as if struck by a great axe, forcing him to retreat in pain. When he later sent a letter of surrender across the border, Marshal Pang Ji received it, along with a sealed memorial and a map of the ceded territories. He personally delivered these to the court, presenting them in celebration.

By imperial order, the documents were sent to the Secretariat for review, and an inquiry was made to the Earth Deity of Chongfu Abbey regarding the deity’s prior revelation of the victory. Apart from the separate honors bestowed upon Commander Pang Ji, a three-day-and-night Daoist ritual was held at the Four Sages Temple to protect the state and its people, in gratitude for the Perfected Lord of the Northern Pole’s divine aid in the western campaign.

**Divine Generals and Their Teachings**

In the second year of Qianxing, first month, Zhang Xiaoning, Loyalty Prefecture Militia Commander and Qianzhou Brigade Marshal, submitted a memorial stating: Recently, the southern Rong tribes of the Xidong Man, led by the Long clan, had amassed tens of thousands, all trained in javelin warfare, presenting a formidable challenge. The Bureau of Military Affairs had appointed him to this task, assigning five thousand troops from the Pacification Office along with three adjutants.

Xiaoning recalled that his late father, the former Director of Palace Administration, had enshrined a hall dedicated to the Perfected Lord of the Northern Pole at home, seeking divination before every undertaking, each time receiving miraculous responses. Following his father’s example, Xiaoning maintained unwavering devotion. Previously, when the court held military examinations, he dreamed one night of receiving instruction in spear techniques, archery, and horsemanship from the River Marshal, a divine general under the Perfected Lord, awakening with sudden divine insight. At the palace examination, among two hundred candidates, Xiaoning ranked first, earning the title of Third-Class Palace Attendant—all through the Perfected Lord’s protection.

After marching over a hundred *li* with his troops, they encountered nightfall near Huguo Abbey. In a small hall, the faint glow of incense and lamps revealed a shrine to the Perfected Lord. Xiaoning burned incense and drew a lot, which foretold great fortune. Silently, he vowed before the Perfected Lord: if he could annihilate the Man bandits in a single battle, he would dedicate his official salary and rewards to repay this divine favor.

At dawn, Xiaoning led his five thousand valiant infantry toward the Man border, where they encountered over ten thousand of the Long clan. Xiaoning lost three consecutive engagements. That night, they encamped at Qin Feng Mountain, near the temple of General Ma Yuan of the Han. As the Man forces pursued, around the second watch, when they were barely a hundred paces apart, a sudden storm arose, and the sounds of battle and slaughter filled the air. Xiaoning’s troops remained motionless at Ma Yuan’s temple, hearing the clamor gradually recede.

At daybreak, they advanced again and found the path strewn with the corpses of slain Man warriors. Pushing toward the Man territory at Jiuyang Creek, they learned that the Long clan’s twelve thousand barefoot raiders had been reduced to two thousand survivors, all wounded by spectral arrows. Long himself had lost his right arm and fled deep into the caves. The survivors declared that the great dynasty was protected by divine and ghostly soldiers, crying out: “We surrender and will never rebel again!”

Later, upon verifying the Long clan’s submission, Xiaoning reported the details to the court. It was decreed that the halls of the Perfected Lord at Huguo Abbey be renovated, with three years’ worth of ordination certificates granted for Daoist rites, and an annual stipend of two hundred strings of cash allocated for temple upkeep. Zhang Xiaoning was promoted to Defense Commissioner of Yingzhou.

**Borrowing Troops from the Spirit Officials**

Lu Shoucong, Palace Attendant of the Inner Court, was dispatched to the Three Passes along the northern frontier to scout Khitan movements. By the western bank of the Yellow River, he encountered two men, each carrying a sealed document. When questioned, they replied: “We are patrolling the mortal realm today. In Dingzhou, we encountered the divine procession of the Perfected Lord of the Northern Pole, the Miraculous and Responsive True Lord. He said: ‘The northern Khitan troops are growing by the tens of thousands. As the Song dynasty’s forces are insufficient to repel them, and since he descended without his celestial soldiers and warriors, he has dispatched us to deliver this message in an instant to the Lord of Bright Spirit at Mount Tai, urgently requesting the loan of ten thousand ghostly soldiers and divine generals. On the *wuz*i day of the *renzi* month, at the *bingzi* hour, they will array a formation to assist the southern court in slaughtering the Khitan and pacifying the frontier.’” The two spirit officials finished speaking and crossed the river.

Shoucong returned to the capital and reported this in person. The relevant authorities were ordered to record it orally. Later, Fu Bi, Vice Minister of Justice and Commander-in-Chief of the Three Passes, returned to court and reported: “The northern Khitan have all been annihilated, with no further intent to wage war. We captured Zhao Yin, Prince Li of Yan, who submitted a written confession before being released back to the Khitan.” Upon inquiry, the date of victory was the *bingzi* hour of the *wuz*i day in the *renzi* month of the *gengwu* year—matching the prior report by the eunuch Lu Shoucong. Apart from rewarding the soldiers and generals, an imperial amnesty was issued to pardon the realm’s crimes. A temple, Shengyou Abbey, was constructed in Dingzhou, and upon its completion, a separate imperial edict was issued to express gratitude.

**The Revelation of the Wei Family**

Wang Zhao, Vice Director of the Department of State Affairs, concurrently serving as Participant in Determining Governmental Matters, and Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Guards, Pacification Commissioner, and Military Commissioner of Dingzhou, submitted a memorandum for verification: In the seventh month of the third year of Yongxi, a million Khitan troops neared the border river. The military commissioner, Inspector-General Pan Renmei, and the veteran general Yang Jiye, who were at odds, jointly led the campaign. In a single engagement, they pursued over six hundred thousand Khitan troops deep into Lang Mountain in northern You. Pan Renmei secretly withdrew his forces, abandoning Jiye’s troops. The Khitan reinforced their position, trapping Jiye in Hukou Fortress, where he lost the battle and perished.

His second son, Yanlang, appealed to the court to clear his father’s name. After officials were dispatched to monitor Pan Renmei’s movements, Palace Attendant Yang Yanlang submitted a petition to the Drum Tower of Petitions, accusing Pan Renmei of colluding with treacherous ministers, exchanging secret correspondence, and instructing the northern Khitan to defy the late emperor’s commands, leading to his father’s murder.

By imperial decree, the Left and Right Surveillance Commissions were ordered to investigate within three days, ensuring full exposure of the truth, with the entire Censorate instructed to pursue the matter diligently. As the three-day deadline approached, civil and military officials all suspected that Wang Yuncong, Secretary of the Palace Library, a Khitan by birth, was involved in the conspiracy. However, no evidence emerged, making it difficult to apprehend him.

At that time, Surveillance Commissioner Wei Huaixin, fearing culpability, conferred with Prime Minister Wang Zongdan and others. As his family deeply revered the Northern Ultimate True Warrior, whose numinous efficacy was most profound, he proposed that all officials gather at his home to reveal the treasonous plot before the sacred presence of the True Warrior, that the truth might swiftly be brought to light. The assembled officials arrived at Wei Huaixin’s residence and reverently awaited the divine intercession of the True Saint.

Suddenly, a gray-haired servant appeared in the hall and abruptly bowed, declaring: “I am but a humble bondsman from the northern Yan household. I witnessed Wang Yuncong, originally a merchant trading among the Khitan, lodging in Buzhou under the guise of a candidate for office. Later, he took ten men like myself as household servants, entered the capital to sell books, and upon encountering the Golden Dragon Festival, passed the examination for the Brilliant Scholars cohort, now serving as Secretary of the Palace Library and Inner Instructor of the Academy. This man is in truth a Khitan spy, long embedded in the Song court, concealing his machinations and covert actions. I now present ten letters exchanged between him and the northern Yan, and humbly petition the emperor, hoping for imperial favor and reward in return.” With that, the gray-haired servant took a step and vanished without a trace.

Thereupon, Prime Minister Wang Zongdan and the others exposed Wang Yuncong’s treason, producing ten letters to submit to the throne. Envoys were immediately dispatched to seize Wang Yuncong, who was interrogated before the court. He confessed to all charges but denied that the gray-haired servant had stolen the Khitan correspondence. When the letters were examined, one bore the cryptic line: *“The imperial carriage must not leave the capital; the troops must not depart the frontier.”* The meaning of these words remained unclear. Wang Yuncong was remanded to the Censorate for further interrogation and subsequently executed. His head was preserved and sent back to the northern Khitan.

Palace Attendant Yang Yanlang was promoted to Inner Palace Venerable Rank and appointed Chief Patrol Inspector of Liangmen Fortress. Upon further investigation into Pan Renmei’s crimes, it was determined that he had been an old minister and maternal relative of the late emperor. By imperial decree, he was stripped of his mourning attire and demoted to Supervisor of Wine in Taiyuan.

As for Yang Jiye, he had been a loyal and heroic confidant of the late emperor, tragically ensnared by treacherous ministers. The court and the realm mourned his fate, and he was posthumously enfeoffed as *Minister of Loyal Assistance, Co-Governor, Pacifier of Rebellion, and Stabilizer of the State*. A temple, the Loyal Aid Monastery, was erected at Liangmen Fortress, where rituals were conducted in his honor. A general amnesty was declared throughout the realm.

The Ministry of Rites, upon reviewing the matter, reported in gratitude to the True Warrior. By imperial decree, a seven-day-and-night Daoist ritual was commissioned and conducted before the sacred presence of the True Warrior at Wei Huaixin’s residence. Wei Huaixin was promoted to Gentleman for Court Service and reassigned as Prefect of Yangzhou.

**The Divination at Wang’s Residence**

Prince’s Goodness Attendant Wang Chou, serving as a confidential secretary in the Jinglue Pacification Commission of Guizhou, had an officer named Liang Mu who forcibly distributed fruits and vegetables from the leper garden to soldiers, colluding with the Tiger Wing Battalion commander Yuan Sheng and others. Under the pretext of adjusting prices, they embezzled the soldiers’ bonuses, pocketing the funds for themselves, inciting widespread resentment. One night, the soldiers seized arms and fled into Lv’er Mountain.

Upon receiving the report, the court first instructed the Confidential Secretariat to investigate Liang Mu’s misconduct, then urgently relayed the findings to the Pacification Commission for further action and submission to the throne. Liang Mu evaded capture, and the rebels in Lv’er Mountain declared their sole grievance to be against the military officer Liang Mu.

The court dispatched an envoy bearing official patents, posthumous honors, brocade robes, and an amnesty edict. Fearing further unrest if Liang Mu remained at large, Wang Chou was troubled. That night, he heard a resonant clatter in his hall. Startled, he rose with a lamp and discovered a pair of divination blocks near the central gate, inscribed with the name of the Hanyang Abbey in his prefecture.

The next morning, Wang Chou visited the abbey and presented the blocks to the Daoist clergy, who confirmed: “How did these come to be in your residence? They are used in the True Warrior Hall of our abbey.” Reflecting deeply, Wang Chou realized the True Warrior had responded to his plight. He entered the hall, offered devout prayers, and used the blocks to petition the divine power, recounting the circumstances and beseeching swift resolution. Three casts yielded unobstructed omens.

As Wang Chou bowed in gratitude and exited the hall, word suddenly arrived that Liang Mu’s entire household was wailing in the leper quarters. Upon investigation, Liang Mu had been seized by a malevolent force, vomiting dark blood before collapsing, lifeless. Wang Chou, upon learning of the matter, ensured no one else was informed. He selected capable soldiers and rushed to Liang Mu’s residence, where they carried out the bloodied corpse.

Wang Chou then assumed the guise of an imperial emissary, falsely declaring that he had come to welcome the body by imperial decree. Over twenty soldiers hoisted Liang Mu’s corpse, summoning the troops to witness it. He announced: “By the emperor’s grace, I was sent with medicinal wine, though it was not meant for you. Do not forget the emperor’s profound benevolence. Now that the oppressive officer is dead, Yuan Zhen, leader of the rebel troops, follow my command.” The rest knelt to receive pardon, their crimes absolved.

They then accepted the amnesty edict, posthumous honors, and brocade robes, returning to Guizhou to resume their duties as before. The Jinglue Pacification Commissioner Shao Mi subsequently memorialized the throne, recommending that the Hanyang Abbey of Guizhou be granted funds for reconstruction and an inscribed plaque. In gratitude for the divine response, Wang Chou was promoted to Gentleman for Court Service and appointed Prefect of the prefecture.

**Ke Cheng’s Discernment of Treachery**

In the capital, Ke Cheng, a commander of the Divine Valiance Battalion, suffered from blindness and was deemed unfit for training duties, resigning his post. Once, by the Wei River, he attempted to drown himself at night but was unexpectedly saved at the brink of death by a divine figure who called to him from the water’s edge, applying medicine and washing his eyes, restoring his sight completely.

From then on, his eyes could discern all external deceit, treachery, and unrighteousness. Later, in a dream, he learned that the savior had been the True Warrior in disguise.

Subsequently, the Western Tibetan Li Keyuan dispatched a spy named Zhao Keda, who, under the pretense of selling day-market jujubes, expanded the axle carts to enter Qingzhou. Each day, he surveyed and memorized the city’s defenses and encampments, returning to his lodging to transcribe the details onto a map using alum-water. Ke Cheng, however, saw through the deception with his discerning eyes and apprehended him in Qingzhou. Zhao initially denied everything, but upon searching his belongings, the map was found—though it had been altered to appear as blank paper. Ke Cheng moistened it with water, revealing the hidden markings, and upon interrogation, Zhao confessed. He was executed accordingly. Ke Cheng was rewarded with a promotion to the rank of *Shijiang* and, upon completing his term, returned to the capital.

At that time, Qian Qumying was acting as the provisional director of the Southern Bureau, and he selected Ke Cheng to serve as a city-wide apprehension officer. During this period, someone at the residence of Prince Wei altered their appearance to impersonate a fire-prevention officer and infiltrated a Daoist ritual assembly. There, they surreptitiously introduced sulfur and fire implements, startling the imperial clan and royal consorts, and made off with six hundred taels of solid silver drinking vessels and approximately one hundred taels’ worth of imperial gold incense orbs. Upon discovery, a decree was issued offering a reward for information leading to the arrest, along with a commission as *Youban Dianzhi* and an official certificate. Ke Cheng, having received the imperial mandate, took up the pursuit. Returning home, he burned incense and prayed to the True Warrior and the Fortune God, vowing to capture the treacherous thief. No sooner had he finished his prayer than, upon stepping outside, he felt as though someone were guiding his path. He walked directly to the western bank of the Cai River, near the Zhenji Monastery, where several men were gambling. Approaching, he noticed one man with a sliver of silver protruding from his chest. Pointing him out, Ke Cheng searched him and recovered several silver vessels. The suspect was taken to the Southern Bureau for interrogation, where he was identified as Zhou Quan, a convict exiled from Fengzhou. After legal proceedings were carried out, the case was reported to the throne. By imperial decree, Ke Cheng was appointed *Youban Dianzhi*, granted the reward money, and ordered to oversee the construction of a grand thanksgiving ritual at Yujin Garden. Additionally, officials were dispatched to the Four Sages Temple to offer incense and perform rites of gratitude.

**Hong Zhen’s Detection of Malevolent Hexes**

At the Shangqing Yanfu Palace in the capital, during the *Tianxi* era, a wandering Daoist named Luo Hongzhen had resided for three years without speaking. When the palace’s Daoist registrar entered the inner court to perform divination for the ailing Empress Dowager Liu, who suffered from malarial fever, Hongzhen suddenly addressed the imperial presence, saying: “I perceive a crimson *qi* lingering over the palace, concentrated at the western side of the halls, facing east. This portends the activation of malevolent hexes, curses, or poisonous sorcery. If one examines this direction and finds a place where the crimson *qi* appears scorched or cracked, digging seven feet deep should reveal the hidden implements of a woman’s clandestine hexing ritual. It is due to this poison that the Empress Dowager suffers from alternating chills and fever.”

The emperor summoned his chief ministers to deliberate, then ordered Luo Hongzhen to enter the palace and investigate. Upon reaching the western side, they found the *Xisheng Pavilion*, once the chamber of Consort Huazu, beloved of the late Emperor Taizu, now long abandoned. Beneath the fourth curtain, Luo Hongzhen instructed laborers to dig seven feet deep. There, they uncovered a square stone tile, its reverse inscribed with a curse in cinnabar glue, bearing the date and hour of Emperor Taizu’s reign. Wrapped in silk was a bundle of inauspicious effigies. Luo Hongzhen took a peach-wood sword from the southeast, wielded it in his left hand, bound the objects with straw rope, and nailed them to the northern *Ghost Gate*—a desolate place—before burning them.

Thereafter, the Empress Dowager’s illness abated. One day, as she napped, she dreamed of seven disheveled, bare-chested figures draped in gold paper, who addressed her: “We seven were once earthbound spirits subjected to sorcery. Recently, the woman Huazu, seeking to undermine the imperial succession of Emperor Taizu, employed the *Sevenfold Reversion Corpse Technique*—a demonic art—and buried seven cursed objects beneath the imperial bed at a depth of seven feet. By chance, Emperor Taizu ascended the throne, his virtue moving heaven and earth, and the Five Peaks and myriad spirits came to his aid. Huazu was destroyed, but the hexing objects remained trapped underground, becoming shadowy specters. They afflicted Emperor Taizu, causing his prolonged illness. Today, thanks to the Daoist Luo Hongzhen, we have been unearthed and freed from the Empress Dowager’s sacred person. Yet we have nowhere to go. We beg the Daoist master to perform the *Lingying* ritual of the Northern Dipper’s True Warrior, allowing us to disperse and return to our origins, seeking rebirth.”

The Empress Dowager, following this dream, summoned Luo Hongzhen once more to perform the ritual. He petitioned the True Warrior to deliver the seven spectral forms. Three days later, the seven figures reappeared in her dream, announcing: “We have received the True Warrior’s decree and been granted rebirth in our original forms. We come now to bid farewell.” The Empress Dowager promptly reported this to the emperor. By imperial decree, a three-day, three-altar ritual was held at Yanfu Palace, and Luo Hongzhen was bestowed the title of *Ziyi Master*, permitted to reside at Yanfu Palace for continued cultivation, awaiting further summons.

**The Sacred Portrait’s Transformation**

In Xi’an County of Yingzhou, during an investigation into the robbery committed by Huang Gousan and his accomplices, it was discovered that the household of Zhu Shoucheng possessed vast quantities of gold, silver, and valuables. As the family was small, they had previously lodged with a local man named Lu Er. On the nights of the eleventh and twelfth of the fourth month in the seventh year of *Qingli*, Huang Gousan and his men, armed with fire pots and weapons, approached Zhu Shoucheng’s door. A fierce wind and torrential rain arose, and the howling of dogs deterred them, forcing their retreat. On the fourteenth night, they returned, scaled the wall, and entered Zhu’s compound. As they prepared to breach the second gate, it suddenly swung open, and over twenty armored men wielding blades and clubs emerged, giving chase. Huang Gousan and his gang hastily tossed their loot over the wall and fled. One pursuer gave chase, and in his panic, Huang Gousan, without looking back, reversed his grip on his spear and struck, killing the pursuer mid-path.

Upon arriving at Lu Er’s home, they discovered that Chen Banxiong was missing from their number—he had been mistakenly killed along the way. When the local elders reported the matter to the authorities and a reward was posted for the capture of the culprits, Chen Banxiong’s wife filed an official accusation, stating that her husband had joined Huang Gousan in banditry but had been singled out and killed by the gang. She revealed that Huang Gousan and his nine accomplices were now hiding in the concealed compartment of Lu Er’s home. The authorities dispatched constables to apprehend them in secret, but when they arrived, both the gang and Chen Banxiong’s wife had vanished without a trace.

According to Huang Gousan’s confession, he had indeed killed Chen Banxiong by mistake. Chen was originally from Qizhou in Shandong and had no family. Zhu Shoucheng, meanwhile, testified that on the nights of the eleventh through the thirteenth of the fourth month, there had been no wind or rain at his home, nor had any dogs barked. On the fourteenth night, though he had heard of a murder on the main road—now known to be Chen Banxiong—he had been unaware that Huang Gousan and his men had scaled the wall and entered his compound. Furthermore, he insisted that the second gate had no brothers, sons, servants, or hired hands, nor had he privately kept any armored men or weapons to pursue the intruders. His household consisted of only seven members in total.

Prefect Han Ji examined the case in detail but found the circumstances perplexing. He questioned Zhu Shoucheng further, asking if his home contained any sacred shrine that might have provided supernatural aid, or how the woman had come to report Huang Gousan’s gang. Zhu replied that his family had only a hall dedicated to Zhenwu the True Lord, where three generations had maintained unbroken incense offerings. Han Ji then ordered the sacred portrait to be brought forth and displayed to the assembled officials. The painting depicted sixteen divine generals in armor, bearing weapons, along with a woman identified as a former disciple of the temple.

Han Ji suddenly understood. After sentencing Huang Gousan and his men, he compiled a detailed report and submitted it to the imperial court. The Ministry of State reviewed the case and noted that Zhu Shoucheng, though a common villager, had maintained a virtuous heart and received divine protection, sparing his home from robbery. His family’s devotion to the Daoist rites of incense and worship was renowned throughout the empire. Moreover, the capture of the bandits had spared the authorities the trouble of pursuit—was this not a service to the state? The court dispatched an envoy to command that all Zhenwu temples in Yingzhou hold grand rituals and offer thanksgiving sacrifices.

**Divine Manifestation**
In Zizhou, there lived a spirit-medium named Lu Qian, whose family had served the deities for three generations, maintaining incense offerings to a hall dedicated to Zhenwu the True Lord. Whenever he divined fortunes or interpreted omens, his readings proved accurate. In the same prefecture lived three men, all prominent pawnshop owners: the first was Feng Chongda, the second Gao Shaolang, and the third You Xinger. Though they appeared to be traveling merchants, they were in truth thieves, their crimes never exposed nor suspected by anyone.

One day, Feng Chongda arrived at Lu Qian’s home with incense and paper offerings to pray before Zhenwu and seek a divination slip. He whispered his entreaties in secret, returning the next day and again on the third. When Lu Qian pressed him for his true purpose, Feng grew enraged, stomped on the incense table, smashed the ritual implements, and stormed off.

Half a year later, the three men returned from their travels. That night, several officials from Kuizhou, who claimed no prior acquaintance with Lu Qian, arrived at his home. They addressed him as if they had met before, saying he had once traveled to Kuizhou to report a robbery in his prefecture, identifying the culprits as Feng Chongda, Gao Shaolang, and You Xinger. Since Lu Qian had not been found in Kuizhou at the time, the officials had been specially dispatched to locate him and ascertain the whereabouts of the three men for arrest.

Lu Qian replied, “I serve only Zhenwu, divining fortunes at home. I have never traveled to Kuizhou to report any official matter. Moreover, these three men are all wealthy and respectable—how could they be thieves?” The officials, hearing this, withdrew to their lodgings.

The next morning, as they prepared to question Lu Qian again, he suddenly appeared before them. He led them to the front of Longxing Temple, where they spotted Feng Chongda and the other two men examining a horse’s hoof. Lu Qian seized their hands, and the officials promptly arrested them.

The officials then sent two men back to Lu Qian’s home, where they found him still asleep. They took him to Kuizhou for interrogation. Within ten days, another notice arrived from Zizhou: Lu Qian had claimed a reward posted in Fuzhou for the capture of the murderers of the tribal chief Guo Zhujiao—once again, the culprits were Feng Chongda and his accomplices, with the confession as evidence. When the authorities summoned Lu Qian, he had vanished without a trace.

Based on this evidence, Feng Chongda and his men confessed to all charges and were sentenced to death by *lingchi*. After the case concluded, the total reward money from various jurisdictions amounted to two thousand *guan*. As the informant, Lu Qian was entitled to seven-tenths of the sum. The authorities in Kuizhou issued a document to Zizhou, dispatching the funds for Lu Qian to claim, with a receipt to be returned as proof.

Lu Qian had never left his home before, nor did he know the circumstances of Feng Chongda’s robberies or the details of the officials’ previous inquiries. Prefect Zhang Shiming of Kuizhou carefully considered the matter and suspected that Lu Qian, or perhaps his family, had accumulated virtuous deeds, making him a vessel for divine intervention. The gods had manifested through him to aid the authorities in capturing these vicious criminals. Zhang proposed awarding the reward money to Lu Qian and submitted a detailed report to the imperial court. The court approved, ordering that the entire sum be given to Lu Qian, along with additional provisions of rice, salt, wine, and silk.

Lu Qian donated all the money and goods to the Yuansheng Temple in his prefecture to construct a Hall of the Four Saints of the Northern Dipper in gratitude for the divine favor. He lived to the age of ninety-nine and passed away without illness. The pirate ships dispersed and withdrew.

The Eastern Pavilion Gate Commissioner, Defense Commissioner of Meizhou, and newly appointed Military Commissioner of the Jingzhao Prefecture, Xie Rouli, was dispatched to the Western Regions during the Tianxi era to oversee matters along the Yellow River. There, he encountered the Perfected Warrior and True Lord flying across the river, who told him: "The Tubo envoy Li Ximeng is entering the country—you must apprehend any skilled painter, for that man is a traitor." Xie Rouli heeded the command and, upon reaching the Eastern Capital, captured a group transporting a portrait of the Empress Dowager from the Cixiao Temple. The Tubo envoy’s plot was exposed, and he was sent to the Supreme Court for sentencing. Xie Rouli was rewarded by the imperial court with a promotion. Thereafter, he daily offered incense and prayers at his family shrine in gratitude. Every night at the second watch, he prepared incense and knelt beneath the open sky, bowing to the north, continuing this for nearly a year.

Suddenly, the court issued an edict appointing him deputy envoy for the return mission to Jiaozhi, accompanying the chief envoy, Minister of Personnel Yan Su, to cross the sea. Before reaching the halfway point at Mount Bailin, at noon, they encountered over forty pirate ships. The pirates brandished spears and crossbows, shouting threats as they sought to plunder their cargo. Unprepared for defense, Xie Rouli stood by the water’s edge, pouring wine and scattering paper money into the air as he tearfully implored the True Warrior to descend. The pirate leader, a scholar named Chen Guang, raised his spear to strike Xie Rouli when suddenly an arrow struck Chen Guang in the chest, sending him into the sea. His body was hauled aboard, and his head was severed and displayed on a pole to the crew. Yet the remaining five hundred pirates, enraged, rallied their ships to exact revenge. As they rowed fiercely forward, a headwind drove them back. For three days and nights, they struggled in vain, until at last they sighted the shores of Jiaozhi not far ahead. As they neared the borders of the City of Female Immortals, officials arrived to welcome them, and the pirates scattered and fled. Yan Su and Xie Rouli, by the grace of the True Warrior, returned safely to the capital.

Upon reporting these divine responses to the throne, an imperial decree was issued to hold a seven-day Yellow Register Grand Offering at Wangjin Garden. On the final day, attendants were dispatched to renowned mountains and grotto-heavens to conduct further rituals, casting dragon tablets into the waters in solemn thanks for the divine favor.

At Baiyun Ziqing Chan Monastery on Xinshan in Dengzhou, the monastic officer Xiao Chu not only upheld the Buddhist teachings but also devoted himself to Daoist practices. In the quiet of his quarters, he reverently worshipped the True Warrior with unwavering devotion. The monastery stood near a coastal island where a band of over a hundred men, led by Zhou Ying of Shaowu Commandery, had been pillaging, murdering, and setting fires along the sea routes. The local authorities amassed a reward for their capture, but as time passed, the gang grew larger and more difficult to eradicate.

One day, Zhou Ying and his men planned to raid the monastery. That night, Xiao Chu dreamed that the monastery’s earth deity came to warn him of an impending attack. The True Warrior had commanded that a black wind be unleashed to repel the pirate ships before they could land, urging Xiao Chu to swiftly alert the authorities. Xiao Chu immediately dispatched a messenger to the patrol inspector, who arrived with armed soldiers and set up ambushes around the monastery.

The next day, Zhou Ying and his hundreds of followers, armed with spears and cudgels, stormed the monastery, claiming they only sought shelter for the night. The monastery’s abbot welcomed them, and they gathered in the Dharma Hall for tea. As the gates were being shut, Xiao Chu pleaded with them, offering money and goods if they would leave at dawn. Zhou Ying scoffed, demanding the valuables be handed over at once. Suddenly, he cried out in terror: "Why do my eyes see only chaos? My head burns like fire, and my limbs will not move!" Moments later, Inspector Qiu Gao of Xixinshan and his troops rushed in, capturing every last pirate without a single escape. They were taken to Dengzhou’s prison, and after sentencing, the reward was divided—seven parts to Monk Xiao Chu and three to the patrol inspector and his soldiers.

In his report, Xiao Chu stated that the capture of the pirates was not due to the monastery’s efforts but to the True Warrior’s intervention, which rendered the bandits helpless and ensured their capture. He petitioned the court to express gratitude to the True Warrior. The provincial authorities submitted the report, and an imperial decree soon followed: though Baiyun Ziqing was a Chan Buddhist monastery, it was granted a True Warrior Hall, along with an imperial copy of the *Scripture of the Supreme Perfected Warrior* for perpetual veneration. Xiao Chu was bestowed a purple robe and the title "Great Master of True Responses," tasked with overseeing the hall and safeguarding the imperial scripture. He was also granted the seven-part reward to expand the sacred hall.

In Anfeng County, Shouzhou, a man named Wang Wenqing had a daughter, nicknamed Zhaodi. From the age of thirteen, she abstained from meat and fish, devoting herself to virtue and the Dao. One day, a wandering Daoist nun knocked at her door, urging Zhaodi to venerate the Perfected Warrior and True Lord of Numinous Response of the Northern Dipper. Zhaodi replied, "I am but a humble girl and cannot afford to commission a sacred image. If I could only obtain a copy of the *Scripture of the True Warrior*, I would recite it day and night, keeping it close to my heart, meditating on the True Lord’s image, burning incense, and chanting his praises."

By twenty, Zhaodi’s beauty, intelligence, and skill had drawn the attention of wealthy families seeking her hand in marriage, all of whom she accepted in principle—yet she never ceased invoking her master, the True Warrior. One day, she overheard her father, uncles, and brothers lamenting: "Last year’s drought left the villages starving. Now, as the crops desperately need water, Heaven has not sent rain, and the people face despair once more. Though officials have come to our village’s Zhenfu Crag to draw water from the dragon pool, there has been no response."

Upon hearing this, Zhaodi cut off her hair in the open air and vowed that on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, she would burn incense and offer herself in sacrifice to pray for rain across the drought-stricken lands, beseeching a bountiful harvest.

Her family entreated her to abandon the vow, but she would not relent. She then erected a pyre before her home. At that moment, spectators from all directions gathered, encircling her with murmurs of admiration. Zhaodi’s countenance remained unchanged, as serene as ever. Taking leave of her parents and the assembled crowd, she left behind a verse:

*"I came seeking deliverance,
Departing by the old path.
Spring blossoms bloom in splendor,
Yet fade without attachment."*

The verse spoken, she laughed joyfully and stepped into the flames. As the fire consumed the pyre’s center, a single streak of azure light shot straight toward the heavens. After a long while, a sudden downpour descended, and though the flames burned as if drenched in oil or wax, their radiance only grew brighter. When the rain ceased and the fire had burned itself out, another heavy rain fell, lasting two days and a night, until every river, canal, and field was thoroughly saturated.

When the skies cleared, the Wang family and villagers came to gather her ashes, but not a single speck of dust remained. Instead, within the pyre’s ashes, they found a sash tied in a double knot and a scroll of the *True Warrior Sutra* she had held in life—both perfectly preserved. It became clear then that her body had dissolved in the fire, leaving only the sutra and her garments as testament to her sincerity.

In recognition of the miraculous rain and its life-giving bounty, local officials summoned Wang Wenqing to present the fire-resistant *True Warrior Sutra* for verification. The matter was duly reported, and the provincial authorities issued an edict to investigate all drought-stricken regions. It was confirmed that from the fifteenth to the sixteenth day of the seventh month, timely rains had fallen abundantly. Further inquiry revealed that within the state’s borders, a streak of azure light had pierced the heavens—a wondrous omen from an unknown source.

The prefectural authorities memorialized the event, and after deliberation by the Central Secretariat, an order was sent to Shouzhou: using government funds, a small pavilion was to be constructed at Tianqing Temple to enshrine the relics of Wang Zhaodi, along with the *True Warrior Sutra* in a painted casket for perpetual veneration. A stele was erected to commemorate the event, and Zhaodi was posthumously enfeoffed as the *Holy Maiden of Life-Giving Rain*, with a shrine established for offerings. The inscription also included a prayer for clear skies.

In Guozhou, a blind man named Chen Xi once encountered the True Warrior on Shaoguang Mountain, who transmitted a secret method to him. From then on, Chen devoted himself to its practice. Later, when he spoke, his words seemed imbued with divine presence, and whatever he prayed for on behalf of others—whether for their uncles or other matters—always came to pass. His reputation spread far and wide, and though people offered him gifts, he cared little for personal gain, dedicating all to meritorious deeds.

During the *Xianping* era, as summer gave way to autumn, prolonged rains damaged the crops. The prefecture and counties performed rituals to pray for relief, but none proved efficacious. The people collectively recommended Chen Xi, who venerated the True Warrior and whose prayers were known to be efficacious. Prefect Huang Fang thus summoned Chen Xi to the government hall. Chen Xi, however, informed Huang that he must personally compose the invocation, bring the True Warrior’s sacred seat from his home to the prefectural yamen, select seven Daoist priests, and establish a purified ritual space. Slaughter was forbidden, punishments were reduced, and the common people were permitted to burn incense and offer prayers for clear skies in the ritual space daily.

After three days, Chen Xi addressed the officials and assembled crowd, relaying the divine message: “By the True Warrior’s decree, Guozhou was fated by the Celestial Bureau to endure sixty days of rain, reducing the harvest by a full tenth. Twenty days remain, and the rains have yet to cease. Now that you have prayed for clear skies, by the August Emperor’s command, the celestial records shall be revised. By tomorrow’s *si* hour, the rain will gradually recede from the due north, and by the *wu* hour, the sky will clear, the crops will flourish, and the harvest will be secured.” When Chen Xi’s spirit returned, he recalled nothing of the divine pronouncement.

The next morning, heavy rain poured down, but by the *si* hour, the skies cleared, and the clouds dispersed from the north. The prefecture retained the True Warrior for three more days of ritual, preparing incense, flowers, and Daoist implements to escort the deity back to Chen Xi’s home. A separate ritual was then held in the hall to give thanks.

That winter, none of the five counties in Guozhou reported any shortfall in grain yields. The Transport Commission investigated the matter and memorialized the court. An imperial edict was subsequently issued to Guozhou, ordering that an official record be established in the prefectural yamen as permanent testimony. Beyond the provisions of wine, grain, silk, and brocade granted by the prefecture, Chen Xi was specially bestowed the title *Master of Tranquil Response*.

Sun Yin’s Memorial on Locust Plagues
*Remonstrance Gentleman, Minister of Justice, and Prefect of Jiazhou, Yang Hu’s memorial:*

I have observed that Sun Yin, magistrate of E County, has diligently administered his office, demonstrating remarkable efficacy in alleviating disasters and hardships. First, when locusts infested the early crops in the villages, though Emei County suffered from flying locusts, the grain remained unharmed. This was due to Sun Yin distributing enchanted water to the villagers, who sprinkled it with willow branches, causing the locusts to transform into flying ants and perish in the water. By autumn, not a single grain was lost.

Second, when tigers and wolves in Emei Mountain preyed upon people year after year, Sun Yin issued a talisman on yellow paper to the mountain’s spirit-officials, and the beasts vanished without a trace.

Third, when Transport Commissioner Tao Fen suffered an attack of wind-phlegm, Sun Yin administered a decoction of jujube and medicine, restoring him to health.

Fourth, when Prefect Yang Hu’s daughter-in-law, née Dou, faced a perilous childbirth, Sun Yin provided a vermilion birth talisman. Burned to ash and mixed with water, it ensured her safe delivery.

As Sun Yin’s term neared its end, the people of the prefecture wept and petitioned for his retention. Summoned for inquiry into his extraordinary abilities, Sun Yin explained: “My late father, Eunuch Sun Zongdao, once accompanied the late Emperor Taizong on a campaign to Hebei. One night in Jinbing Plain, he encountered the True Warrior Perfected Lord, who transmitted nine talismans, incantations, and methods for consecrating water. Though my father never employed them, I inherited the teachings and have venerated the True Warrior ever since, vowing to use the talismans and water to save others. All successes are due to the True Warrior’s aid—how could they be my doing alone?”

Yang Hu submitted a detailed memorial in support, and Transport Commissioner Tao Fen followed with his own report. The court, after review, determined that while other matters were unremarkable, the suppression of locusts in two towns and the taming of tigers and leopards demonstrated divine protection worthy of commendation. Though Sun Yin held office by hereditary privilege without formal credentials, he was specially promoted to *Attending Secretary of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices* and reappointed to Emei County for another term.

In Jiazhou, the *True Warrior Compassionate Salvation Abbey* was founded by Prefect Yang Hu, Transport Commissioner Tao Fen, and local merchants in gratitude. The abbey served to repel pests and pacify disasters.

**Lin Shouqing’s Veneration of the True Warrior**
During the *Baoyuan* era, a Fujian merchant named Lin Shouqing was sailing from Zhangzhou’s harbor when his ship was caught in a storm surge. As the vessel was about to sink, a divine figure suddenly appeared in the empty air above the prow, calling out: “Shouqing, cease your seafaring henceforth. Today, I shall save your ship from peril. In the future, come to the *Tianqing Abbey* on Min Mountain and seek Daoist Ren in the south corridor.” With these words, the figure vanished in a flash of white light. The wind and waves instantly calmed, and the ship glided smoothly back to Fuzhou.

Lin proceeded to the south corridor of *Tianqing Abbey* on Min Mountain but found no quarters for a Daoist named Ren. An elderly priest informed him: “The character *ren* means ‘person.’ In the south corridor, there is a shrine to the True Warrior Perfected Lord, originally the *King’s Protector of the State Hall*.” Lin then understood. He visited the hall to offer thanks and commissioned a statue of the True Warrior from the finest agarwood, gilded and intricately carved, for lifelong veneration.

When the craftsman selected a piece of agarwood measuring one foot and three inches in circumference, he prepared to carve it. Suddenly, several auspicious rays of light emanated from the wood, growing brighter and unceasing. Once the statue was completed, Lin, together with others, donated over ten thousand strings of cash to sponsor grand vegetarian feasts at temples and abbeys throughout the prefecture and on Min Mountain. The *Tianqing Abbey* and the *King’s Protector of the State True Warrior Hall* were extensively renovated, and repentance rituals were established. Lin vowed that neither he nor his descendants would ever again engage in maritime trade.

That year, Fuzhou suffered a severe drought from spring to summer, and locusts swarmed, ravaging the crops. Prayers for relief went unanswered, and the locusts persisted into the seventh and eighth months. The prefectural government, learning of Lin Shouqing’s devotion to the True Warrior, dispatched officials to invite the deity to the yamen. There, rituals were performed thrice daily with utmost reverence.

After just three days, the locusts wrapped themselves around tree branches and perished. Villagers from the four hamlets broke off the branches and presented them as proof. Sweet rains began to fall daily, and by winter, half of the damaged crops were salvaged. The prefectural government celebrated and gave thanks to the True Warrior, concluding the grand ritual feast. With the same solemnity as before, the deity was escorted back to Lin Shouqing’s household shrine.

Prefect Chen Ciqin, having witnessed Lin Shouqing’s deliverance at sea, the carving of the sacred image, the manifestation of crimson light, and the prayers for rain that dispelled the locust plague, reported these miracles across seven prefectures and nineteen counties, affirming their truth and efficacy in widespread relief. His memorial was duly approved, and an edict commanded that the True Warrior image enshrined by Lin Shouqing be purchased at its appraised value and conveyed to the capital.

Lin Shouqing thereafter presented the image at court. Upon inspection, the throne was found to be crafted of aloeswood, exquisitely wrought, and suffused with auspicious radiance—a marvel of divine favor and numinous response. By imperial decree, it was retained as a treasure to safeguard the realm and enshrined in the inner palace. Lin Shouqing was specially granted the honorary rank of *Sanjie Jiezhi* and later rose to the position of Right Attendant-in-Ordinary. He lived to ninety-six, passing without illness.

*Record of the Divine Manifestation of the Dark Heavenly Emperor*, Scroll Four, concludes.
*Dispelling Calamities and Invoking the Fire Virtue*

In the second year of Xianping, the Bureau of Astronomy memorialized that on the third day of the ninth month, Mars would conjoin the constellation Lou, directly illuminating the celestial division corresponding to Zhengzhou in the Qi region, foretelling a great conflagration. The imperial command was issued to the prefecture, ordering preparatory rites of expiation. As Zhengzhou served as a strategic garrison along the eastern route to the capital, from the fourth month onward, notices were posted at temples and Daoist abbeys to conduct rituals for averting fire, with grand jiao offerings and prayers.

At that time, Li Weixin of the southern market, a broker in the grain trade, would steal away each night at the third watch to burn incense and prostrate himself at a critical thoroughfare on the bridge. By chance, the garrison commander Ren Congyuan happened upon him during a night patrol, arrested him for violating curfew, and sent him under guard to Lizhou. When questioned, Li admitted to his misconduct, explaining that since the seventh night of the first month, he had been burning incense at night after learning of a matter. Asked what it was, he replied: "Last year, I vowed to devote my broker’s earnings for a full year to sponsor a jiao offering to the Heavenly Court, in gratitude for the source of my sustenance, and to host a vegetarian feast. Suddenly, a wandering Daoist—his robes disheveled, his bearing free and untrammeled—entered seeking alms, carrying a scroll painting. It was a silk portrait of the True Warrior. I wished to enshrine it, and the Daoist agreed, asking only for two strings of cash, then partook of the meal. Midway through, a gust of wind howled, and he vanished, leaving behind on the table a living tortoise no larger than a peach pit. I knew then I had encountered a divine manifestation, receiving sacred incense and this wondrous small tortoise, which I treasured and enshrined.

On the seventh night of the first month this year, I prepared paper offerings to burn in worship of the True Warrior. Then, the Daoist who had sold me the scroll years before reappeared, carrying the little tortoise. I bowed to him, asking his name, but he would not say, only declaring: ‘This poor Daoist is versed in calendrical calculations. When the celestial fire star arrives on the third day of the ninth month, it will directly illuminate Zhengzhou in the Qi region, bringing a great fire that will burn ten thousand households. If you find a household surnamed Wan, regardless of the size of their dwelling, do not move a single item or coin from their home. First, record an inventory of all their possessions. At dawn on the third day of the ninth month, have a boy with his hair tied in a topknot, clad in a coarse hemp robe, carry a torch and circle the house three times from the south, then set it ablaze. Afterward, there will be no further fire. Once done, gather the people to restore the house and all its contents to the Wan family, and the calamity will be averted.’

As he departed, he transformed into a streak of white light and vanished. Though I received this divine revelation, I dared not report it. Instead, each night, I secretly offered prayers to Mars at the market’s vital crossroads, beseeching deliverance from disaster. Here is the incense burner I carried as proof."

Upon reviewing the broker’s testimony, the prefectural authorities found it consistent with the recent imperial edict. They dispatched officials to investigate households surnamed Wan, recording an inventory of their property and possessions. The residents were ordered to await the fire’s passage before restoring everything, with the documents filed for the record. Li Weixin was released to return home, where he burned incense in vigilant protection.

When the appointed day arrived, a boy clad in a hemp robe was prepared. The household of Wan Ming west of the prefectural bridge was set ablaze. A southern wind fanned the flames, splitting them into two fierce tongues. The people were seized with terror—when suddenly, a sudden downpour extinguished the blaze. In less than an hour, the fire had passed through the Wan residence. Beneath the True Warrior’s image in Li Weixin’s home, the small tortoise was gone, having vanished with the wind and rain.

The prefecture of Zhengzhou, having witnessed this divine efficacy, had already acted accordingly. Subsequently, in accordance with a memorial from the Chancellery, the Bureau of Astronomy observed that on the third day of the ninth month, the Fire Virtue would descend upon Zhengzhou, striking at the hour of *yin* to burn away the Wan household. Upon inquiry, it was confirmed that no official storehouses, armories, or other public property would be affected.

At the time, Wu Min’gu, Vice Minister of War and Participant in Determining Governmental Matters, served as prefect of Zhengzhou. Upon opening and reviewing the memorial of protection, a subsequent imperial decree was issued for further deliberation. As Li Weixin had encountered the True Warrior and averted disaster, thereby manifesting his accumulated virtue, he was to be bestowed with one hundred bottles of ritual wine, one hundred bolts of silk, ten *shi* of rice, ten *shi* of wheat, and one hundred strings of cash, to be disbursed from the prefecture’s public treasury. Wan Ming, who had previously offered his entire household to be burned in substitution, thereby effecting timely expiation, was likewise granted wine, rice, and other provisions according to precedent. He was urgently ordered to rebuild his dwelling, with compensation for his property, and no delay was to be tolerated.

Moreover, in recognition of the True Warrior’s merciful deliverance and the Southern Fire Virtue’s august stellar benevolence, a seven-day and seven-night Daoist ritual was to be conducted in the Jade Grove Park of the capital, with an offering of one thousand two hundred altar stations in gratitude. To counteract the baleful influence of *Ketu*, in the third year of the Zhihe reign, on the first night of the eighth month, a yellow vapor emerged from the south and persisted for three nights before dissipating. According to a memorial from the Bureau of Astronomy by the Court Gentleman for Attendance Xia Xun and others, the yellow vapor had appeared in the due south, corresponding to the celestial division of the Wu state. This vapor was known by three names: the Yellow Path of Heaven’s Gate, *Tuyang*, and *Ketu*, manifesting in the Celestial Gate of the *Makara* constellation. The Yellow Path foretold internal strife in the state the following year, affecting one person of the *yin* palace. *Tuyang* signified the image of tombs, while *Ketu* was the stellar bridge of the nine heavens. Its untimely appearance outside its proper palace portended that, by the winter’s end, one quarter of the military and civilian population in a certain region would perish from pestilence. However, as this star resided in the *Makara* constellation and trespassed upon the *Kang* mansion, it also served as a stellar force capable of dissolving calamity and bestowing fortune. It was thus hoped that the court would promptly undertake rites of humility and expiation.

Upon deliberation by the court officials, as the matter pertained to the future, it was deemed necessary to take preventive measures. A month-long inner Daoist ritual was accordingly conducted in the Jade Grove Park. Imperial incense was dispatched to all renowned mountains and great rivers, where dragon tablets were cast into the waters, and seven-day and seven-night ritual offerings were established. A general amnesty was proclaimed, and prisoners were to have their sentences reduced or remitted. Additionally, within the imperial palace’s Hall of Flourishing Sagehood, a separate forty-nine-day and forty-nine-night Yellow Register Daoist ritual was held. Each day, the emperor personally attended to pray to the Star Lord *Ketu*, the Eastern *Kang* constellation, and the household True Warrior and Fortune Deity, seeking auspicious confirmation through the ritual.

As the allotted days neared their end, suddenly, at high noon, a fierce wind arose, stirring up swirling yellow sand that obscured the sky. Amidst the haze, a golden-armored divine warrior appeared in the courtyard, declaring, “Your subject is General Ge, Warden of the Western Gate of Heaven, who, together with the True Warrior of the North, oversees the reckoning of good and evil in the yang realm. Recently, the Southern Gate of Heaven’s Yellow Path has opened, revealing *Ketu* as it traverses the nine heavens. Once every seven hundred and twenty years, it completes a grand cycle, and now, encountering its destined phase, it clashes with *Tuyang* of the central region, producing a three-day yellow vapor that entwines the *Kang* mansion before retreating from *Makara*. This portends internal strife in the yang realm, arising from a person of the *yin* palace born in the year of the Boar, who holds sway as a national leader. Within half a year, in the circuits of Jinghu, Jiangzhe, Fujian, Guangnan, and Huaihan, one quarter of the populace will perish, and tombs will line the roads. Though the calamity has yet to arrive, the emperor’s virtue has already elicited a response. The rituals, offerings, and casting of dragon tablets, however, have not yet fully expiated the omen. Only the proclamation of virtue and the release of prisoners have accrued sufficient merit to move the heavens. Through the True Warrior’s intercession, a memorial was presented to the North Culmen, which in turn memorialized the Jade Emperor. By special decree, the Heavenly Emperor personally conducted an investigation, and *Ketu* was pacified on behalf of the imperial house. It was determined that a person of the *yin* palace, aged twenty-nine and born in the year of the Boar, would die in the first ten days of the new year. To avert internal strife and spare the southern circuits from the death of one quarter of their military and civilian population, a tomb should be erected twenty-seven *li* due south to counter the Yellow Path. At that time, no mourning should be observed, for this person’s allotted lifespan has reached its end. I have been entrusted by the True Warrior to report this to the imperial house before returning to the Heavenly Gate.”

In the following year, on the third day of the first month, the Noble Consort Zhang passed away. The Noble Consort was twenty-nine years old, born on the nineteenth day of the first month at the hour of *hai*, her fate palace belonging to the Boar. On an auspicious day for the Yellow Path, a tomb was erected twenty-seven *li* due south. Thereafter, no further disasters occurred, and this fulfillment of the omen was attributed to the True Warrior’s descent and protection of the realm.

Grateful for this divine mercy and the reports from the gods—including General Ge of the Western Heavenly Gate—it was decreed that the relevant authorities should bestow upon all the abbeys and temples within the capital the task of holding three-day-and-night *luotian* grand jiao rites to repay the sagely grace.

**Grain and Wheat Descend from Heaven**

In the two circuits of Hebei, from Zhen Ding and its subordinate prefectures and counties, following the establishment of the *Jianlong* garrison, two years of drought had left not a single grain of rice, wheat, millet, or bean to harvest. Soldiers and civilians suffered from famine and pestilence, with many fleeing or perishing.

At that time, in Cizhou, during the seventh month, guards stationed at the four city gates reported to one another that merchants had arrived with carts, camels, and horses, transporting mats and sacks of grain and wheat, all claiming to seek temporary storage in the official granaries. The prefect dispatched officials to guide these travelers through each gate. Soon after, Captain Zhang Jing and others submitted an official report stating that at the four gates, two thousand sacks of grain and wheat had appeared, with no owner in sight. Local residents keeping watch all testified that those at the western gate had unloaded the mats, stacked them neatly, then led their carts and horses through the right gate of Chongming Abbey and vanished. At the other three gates, no one knew their whereabouts, though yellow paper horses were found tied to the corners of the sacks.

Prefect Chen Yong of Cizhou, along with Vice Prefect Mo Qianzhi, proceeded to Chongming Abbey at the western gate and assembled the Daoist clergy to inquire about the merchants’ names. The clergy replied: “The abbey’s gates are dilapidated; no carts or followers have entered here.” Yong and his party asked: “When was this abbey established, and how many halls does it contain?” They were told: “It dates back to the Former Tang, when the Heavenly Court’s Gan the Perfected was banished to the mortal realm. Here, he instructed the Qingti Daoist in cultivation. Later, as Gan the Perfected ascended in broad daylight and Qingti also departed, the site was granted abbey status. Within, there are four halls: the Hall of the Three Purities, the Hall of the Northern Culmen and Seven Primes, the Hall of Gan the Perfected, and the Hall of the True Warrior’s Divine Response. Apart from the Hall of the True Warrior—which receives offerings from soldiers and civilians on the days of his descent and is thus maintained—the rest have fallen into ruin.”

Yong then ordered soldiers to transport the sacks to the prefectural granary. The grain and wheat from the four gates totaled ten thousand *hu*. As the people of Cizhou were in dire need of relief, this unexpected bounty seemed to descend from heaven. Yet, unwilling to presume, they first memorialized the imperial court through the Central Secretariat.

Reports from over twenty prefectures in the same circuit, including Zhen Ding, also confirmed the arrival of grain and wheat, identical to that in Cizhou, though all claimed it had been transported from Cizhou. Compiling the figures from each prefecture, the total amounted to over one hundred fifty thousand *shi* of grain and wheat. The court promptly ordered all prefectures to sell the grain at low prices without delay. Upon investigation, the gold coins and paper horses presented as offerings were clearly the result of worldly incense-burning rituals, with the True Warrior’s descent marked by the paper horses. Thus, imperial physicians were dispatched with incense and prayer tablets to Cizhou, where they joined the prefect and vice prefect in conducting a vegetarian feast and jiao rites at Chongming Abbey. Furthermore, a Hall of the True Warrior’s Imperial Portrait was established within the palace to offer thanks. The Hebei Transport Commission was instructed to use the proceeds from the sale of the heavenly-descended grain to renovate all True Warrior abbeys and temples across the circuit’s prefectures and commanderies. Chongming Abbey was renamed the Sagely Aid and State-Protecting Abbey, with its Hall of the True Warrior rededicated as the Hall of Divine Response, inscribed with imperial calligraphy in gold. Within the palace, a family shrine for the True Warrior’s imperial portrait was also constructed, and the Hall of the Mysterious Capital of the Northern Guardian was bestowed as a mark of sagely favor.

**Tian Sheng’s Steamed Cakes**

At the Supreme Purple Culmen Abbey atop Mount Zitong in Zizhou, the Western Jin Daoist Ye Hua cultivated the Dao. There, the Supreme Venerable Lord descended to instruct Prince Jinque of the King of Zhengle—later known as Master Jinque—who attained the Way. This Prince Jinque of Zhengle was none other than the True Warrior. Within the abbey stands the Hall of the Northern Culmen and Purple Tenuity, built by Ye Hua himself before his ascension to guide the True Warrior’s transformation.

In the first year of the *Huangyou* reign, Zizhou suffered from famine and pestilence, with seven or eight out of every ten people dead or dying. Suddenly, an old villager appeared, pushing a cart to sell steamed cakes. The locals rushed to buy them, and those who ate them felt no hunger all day.

The old villager continued his trade for over a month, seen only entering through the Gate of Good Gardens and departing by the same route. Zhang Sheng, Vice Minister of Personnel and Prefect of Zizhou, dispatched men to stealthily track his comings and goings. Upon their return, they reported seeing only a natural black mist descending near the Supreme Purple Culmen Abbey before Mount Zitong. The next day, the old man no longer appeared. Instead, word spread that fifteen *li* outside the Gate of Good Gardens, beside the fields near the Supreme Purple Culmen Abbey, *qici* had sprouted in abundance. Enough to feed all the starving people of the prefecture, the tubers sustained them for over sixty days until the new harvest of grain, millet, and beans reached the market. Then, the *qici* in the fields vanished without a trace.

Zhang Sheng prepared incense and silk offerings and personally visited the Supreme Purple Culmen Abbey to pay homage. Entering the right wing of the Hall of the Northern Culmen, he found the ground strewn with green grass entwining the True Warrior’s hall. He ordered his attendants to gather the grass from beside the altar platform. Upon inspection, they discovered it was the roots and shoots of *qici*. When they sent for more, it transformed into flying paper ash, leaving only two freshly gathered tubers with their shoots intact. These he sealed in an incense casket, recording the full account before dispatching it to the capital.

By decree of the Chancellery, the memorial concerning the True Warrior’s miraculous *qici* that saved the people was returned with approval. It ordered the tubers to be enshrined in the Abbey of the Four Saints and instructed Zizhou to assemble Daoist priests at a prominent crossroads for a seven-day-and-night *Tiancao* grand jiao ritual and universal vegetarian feast. Additionally, a separate jiao offering was to be held at the True Warrior’s hall in the Supreme Purple Culmen Abbey, which was also granted an inscribed plaque reading *"Rescue and Transformation, Salvation of the People."*

**Zheng’s Arrow Slays the Turtle**

In the second year of the *Tiansheng* reign, on the fourteenth day of the eighth month, the Yellow River’s dry-mouth dam at Beijing’s Daming Prefecture burst. The surging waters wreaked havoc, endangering soldiers and civilians alike. During the emergency repairs, the supervising officials—Vice Prefect Hua Dunchen and others—inspected the breach and found a massive black-shelled turtle with crimson eyes at the base of the dam’s rocky foundation. Whenever it surfaced, the currents raged, snapping the dam’s ropes. They reported the matter to the Capital Defense Command.

Later, when Chancellor Wei, Duke Han Qi, was stationed in Beijing, his attendant Zheng Gui was patrolling the area and encountered the turtle again, still causing trouble. Zheng Gui examined it and, recognizing it as a water demon, knew it could be easily vanquished. Donning his court robes and bow, he burned incense and prayed to the Heavenly Court. His arrow struck true, felling the turtle onto the rocks below, calming the waves. The soldiers swiftly completed the repairs.

On the third day of the first month of the third year of *Tiansheng*, Zheng Gui suddenly suffered a stroke and died in his quarters. Two days later, his soul revived and appeared before Duke Han, saying: "Two ghost messengers came for me, claiming King Yama urgently summoned Zheng Gui for wrongfully shooting the five-hundred-year-old turtle spirit of the Yellow River’s dry mouth. It has come to lodge a grievance and demands a confrontation." Upon checking the registers, they found Zheng Gui’s allotted lifespan was not yet exhausted, so the two ghosts escorted him away.

Passing a mountain, Zheng Gui saw a banner planted below and a bustling procession. He asked, "What place is this?" The ghost soldiers replied, "This is the Wind-Ravaged Mountain of the lower realm, where celestial perfected ones often come to review the affairs of the Three Realms." Gazing into the distance, Zheng Gui saw a figure seated on a rock—it was the True Warrior, revered in the mortal world. Zheng Gui hurried forward and bowed, and the True Warrior descended, saying, "How has a mortal like you come here?" The ghost messengers recounted the events.

The True Warrior said, "King Yama acted hastily, failing to discern the truth. That turtle was originally the earth god of Yuanzhou in the Dream Cloud City of the Western Qiang. When the imperial master Chen Zhongyuan conquered Yuanzhou in a previous dynasty, the city god was demoted by decree and reassigned to the Yellow River’s fourth dry-sand water deity, under the jurisdiction of Zhuozhou in the Northern Qiang. With no offerings there, it transformed into a demonic turtle and followed the current upstream to the seventh dry mouth of the Yellow River in the Song territory at Beijing. There, it breached the dam, harming over ten thousand soldiers and civilians. Heaven’s Way does not tolerate such deeds, so it was rightfully slain by Zheng Gui’s arrow. Moreover, the Earth Prison acted without celestial mandate. Have the talisman officer bring the small turtle from my presence, along with Zheng Gui and the two ghost soldiers, to confront King Yama. If the ghost demon disputes this, let the talisman officer release the small turtle. Then report to the Earth Prison: Zheng Gui’s lifespan is not yet over, and his master, Chancellor Han Qi, is a Perfected One of the Purple Palace currently governing Beijing. His future ascension would be inconvenient."

After speaking, the True Warrior dismissed Zheng Gui, who followed the talisman officer and ghost messengers to the netherworld. There, he saw the great turtle caged in iron, an arrow lodged in its left flank, groaning in grievance. The two ghost messengers relayed the True Warrior’s decree. Upon hearing this, King Yama descended from his throne and bowed to the heavens. He immediately ordered the celestial mandate reviewed, verifying the false accusations and the turtle’s crimes. The turtle was condemned to be cast into the rivers and seas, to serve as a tide-pushing, sand-shifting creature—a nameless water beast and formless hungry ghost. The demonic turtle still spoke, demanding a confrontation with Zheng Gui. The talisman officer drew the small turtle from his sleeve, releasing a golden light that struck the demonic turtle, reducing it to a motionless mass. The sacred turtle then scattered its remains into the void, turning them to dust. Zheng Gui thus revived.

To avoid the title of "Perfected One of the Purple Palace," Duke Han had the military commissioner Wang Cong, Vice Prefect Hua Dunchen, and others jointly submit a memorial. A subsequent imperial decree ordered the construction of the Protector-State True Warrior Hall at the Yellow River’s dam breach in Beijing, where a jiao ritual was held and a stele erected.

Zheng Gui was promoted one rank, and Duke Han was granted the honor of having his name inscribed on the hall plaque, with permission to stay at any official lodging along his travels.

**Pei the Sword-Wielder Drives Away Tigers**
In the Heng Mountains of Fenzhou, during the Jiayou era, a tiger suddenly appeared, preying on travelers at dawn and dusk. Whenever officials or hunters attempted to capture it, the beast would multiply into five or seven, resisting them in turn. As this was a vital route from Hedong to the capital, the harm grew severe. When Yang Zongdao, the newly appointed magistrate of Sanshui County, passed through Heng Mountain with his family en route to his post, one of his daughters was devoured. The prefectural and circuit authorities dispatched local patrol officers to guard the roads, increased the bounty for its capture, and called for hunters to slay the beast. At that time, a wandering Daoist named Pei arrived, claiming he could subdue the tiger. The prefecture granted his request, and after seven days, he returned, declaring that the tiger was no true beast but the vengeful spirits of seven members of the Zhang Yi household—a noble family of Zhao during the Han—massacred by Chu soldiers on this mountain. Woodcutters had once discovered their corpses, failing to recognize them, and buried them together behind the mountain’s spirit shrine in a secluded spot where no one trod. Thus, they became spectral beings. On a day of celestial amnesty, they had consumed dew from the Jade Pool of the Jasper Lake, transforming into ferocious tigers that craved human flesh and blood.

When the Daoist requested the prefectural officials to witness his exorcism, Prefect Li Xiangyun and Vice Censor Shao Tang, along with soldiers, proceeded to the slopes of Heng Mountain. The Daoist ventured alone into the wilderness. Suddenly, the sky darkened, and windswept mist rose. Through the clouds, Pei the Daoist appeared, hair unbound and sword in hand, calling out: "Li Xiangyun and the others, do not fear. I have already driven out the seven demonic tigers." The officials prostrated themselves, recognizing him as the True Warrior (Zhenwu), who had once descended into the Pei household during the reign of Empress Wu of Tang, leaving behind this surname. The seven tigers, as if bound by ropes, coiled on the ground, roaring several times before perishing. Then, seven figures appeared in the air, bowing and leaping to address the officials: "We are the Zhang Yi household of the Han, slaughtered by Chu soldiers and long transformed into malevolent beasts, harming countless lives. We deserved annihilation. Now, by the grace of the True Warrior, our sins of devouring lives as tigers have been absolved by celestial pardon. We leave these tiger pelts as offerings to the officials. By imperial mercy, we have been dispatched to the Eastern Peak to await judgment and rebirth." With that, Pei the Daoist vanished into the clouds.

The hunters were ordered to skin the tigers and present the pelts to the authorities. The Fenzhou prefectural and circuit offices memorialized the throne, and by imperial decree from the Chancellery, a True Warrior shrine was established on Heng Mountain. Three Daoist priests were selected to maintain the rites, with the prefecture providing monthly stipends of money and grain to ensure the site’s perpetual guardianship and unbroken incense offerings. A stele was also erected to record the event.

**Testing Magic Before the Court**
During the reign of Empress Wu of Tang, He Quanlong, the Palace Attendant and Military Observer of Nan’an, trained five hundred young boys in the heretical arts of the Fox Woman, claiming they were possessed by the Seven Celestial Spirits of the North and could be commanded at will. He repeatedly demonstrated their powers before the court, summoning clouds, hail, and gales through their incantations. Empress Wu favored him, and many officials fell from grace due to his slanderous accusations.

When the Western Rong tribes rebelled under Zhao Hong’s leadership, their armies clashed with imperial forces. Dark clouds would gather above the battlefield, unleashing fire and lightning, or manifesting dragons, tigers, and grotesque apparitions to scatter the troops. Officials petitioned Empress Wu to employ the celestial arts of the Heavenly Principle School to counter Zhao Hong. She granted He Quanlong a seal of command and dispatched him with two thousand soldiers. However, in the ensuing battle, all two thousand imperial troops and five hundred of He’s sorcerer-boys were wounded, many maimed.

He Quanlong returned to plead for clemency, which the Empress granted. Soon after, Zhao Hong’s forces advanced further. Deeply troubled, Empress Wu was approached by the Vice Director of the Chancellery, Pei Tao, who petitioned: "Your subject has a son, Zhongfang, aged sixteen. Since the age of three, he has spoken in perfect prose, and at nine, he was visited by a celestial being who taught him archery and horsemanship. I humbly offer my entire household as surety and request to lead five hundred foot soldiers to exterminate the rebel Zhao Hong." The Empress interrogated Zhongfang, then appointed him as a Sacrificial Official of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices and temporarily granted him the rank of Gentleman of the Palace Treasury. She entrusted him with command of the troops.

Zhongfang marched directly to Zhao Hong’s encampment. With a mere flash of his sword, he quelled thousands of enemy soldiers and captured Zhao Hong alive. Without slaughtering a single soul, he brought the rebel leader back to the capital and reported: "Zhao Hong’s demonic defenses have been broken by a minor display of my arts. The culprit now stands before Your Majesty."

Empress Wu dismissed her attendants and addressed Zhongfang: "It is revealed that you are the Northern Dipper’s True Warrior, incarnated in mortal form to manifest your divinity. I wonder, how effective were the Seven Celestial Arts employed by He Quanlong before the court?" Zhongfang replied: "He Quanlong trained his boys in the heterodox Fox Woman sorcery, inscribing their soles with vermilion talismans to enable them to ascend clouds and summon hail. Yet his powers pale beside Zhao Hong’s. His favor with the throne has led to the unjust demotion of loyal ministers. If left unchecked, this will fester into outright treason. I propose that He Quanlong and I demonstrate our arts before the court to dispel Your Majesty’s doubts."

The Empress promptly ordered He Quanlong and Pei Zhongfang to perform their magic on the palace steps. He Quanlong commanded his five hundred sorcerer-boys to charge forward in a frenzied display, leaving the assembled civil and military officials in awe.

Then Zhongfang sprayed a mist of pure water, and the five hundred sorcerer-boys vanished from the air, all drawn into the scabbard at his side. Quanlong, left helpless, cried out before the throne: "Spare me, that I may draw one last breath!" The Empress swiftly rose to burn incense and said to Zhongfang: "Out of consideration for Quanlong’s favor with the Queen Mother, spare his life." Zhongfang thereupon released He Quanlong, but the five hundred sorcerer-boys, trapped within the scabbard, were consumed by true fire and reduced to ashes. Zhongfang memorialized the throne, requesting that all officials previously demoted or punished be restored to their posts. He was specially appointed General of Divine Response, and those such as Zhao Hong whom he had captured were also petitioned for release and sent back to the Western Regions.

**Suppressing Sorcery in the Prefecture**
In the fourth year of Taiping Xingguo, Shi Guangsi, Military Commissioner of Wu’an and Left Vice Director of the Department of State Affairs, was transferred to Hongzhou. Having heard that the region was rife with heterodox arts and sorcery, which persisted despite repeated prohibitions, he learned of a master of the precepts and pure discipline at Xiadao Mountain’s Ancestral Sage Abbey. He invited Master Ling Jumiao of Luofu Grotto to consult on the matter and discovered that the worshippers along the Hong, Heng, Tan, Ding, and E river basins all venerated southern spirits. Officials were dispatched to arrest 116 practitioners of left-handed sorcery, including Ma Yongcheng, who were brought before the assembly for interrogation. Ma Yongcheng pleaded in his defense that he had not originally studied left-handed arts, but because the lands of Jiangnan, Jinghu, and the surrounding waters were plagued by the seventy-two seasonal spirits that harmed souls, spread febrile epidemics, and obstructed all undertakings, he had resorted to left-handed arts—performing rituals of blades, oil, fire, and *vajra* rites—to suppress the afflictions, which brought slight relief. Guangsi ordered that all implements—blades, staffs, oil cauldrons, and fire-woks—be confiscated and destroyed, and the offenders were reprimanded and released after submitting written confessions.

By the seventh month of that year, Hongzhou was indeed struck by a soul-harming calamity. The populace suffered from raging fevers, consuming shards of tile and porcelain, or climbing to hang from roof beams, clinging to trees, or plunging into water and ditches, all while uttering foul words. Guangsi summoned Master Ling Jumiao, who distributed talismanic water to heal the afflicted, and the suffering gradually abated. Fearing future outbreaks, he had over ten thousand plaques inscribed with the sacred title of Zhenwu, the Numinous and Responsive, and distributed them for veneration. On the days of the deity’s monthly descent, the *Mysterious Scripture of Zhenwu* was recited. Over time, the disaster was entirely eradicated, and the people turned from heresy to the true Way.

Stone Guangsi memorialized: "In Hongzhou, though Daoist temples and abbeys existed before the Southern Tang, no halls or incense offerings had yet been dedicated to Zhenwu. The Three Departments and the Ministry of Rites deliberated and determined that Hongzhou should be instructed to construct a proper hall at the former site of the Zhenwu shrine within Tianqing Abbey. The throne was further petitioned to bestow an imperial inscription for the hall’s plaque, to be titled *Protecting the State and Evoking Response*."

Later, Guangsi journeyed to Xiadao Mountain to pay homage to Master Ling Jumiao, receiving the ritual forms of Zhenwu’s Way. He then sought retirement from office and returned to his estate in Zhaozhou, where he lived in seclusion, far from worldly dust, reverently maintaining the incense offerings to the True Sage. He lived to ninety-nine years, passing without illness.

**The Bewitchment of Chai M

To this day, she would arrive at the second watch of the night and depart at the fifth. She wore upon her robe a fragrant pouch, its surface shimmering. When brought forth for examination, it proved to be no ordinary object, and the family kept it. Later, they returned to the Hall of King Liang Zhao at Shengshui Abbey, where upon the wall they found the painted figure of the flute-playing maiden—her beauty unmatched—with one corner of the railing smudged and the colors faded. When the fragrant pouch was held against it, the seams aligned perfectly.

Chai Xun laid out the circumstances in full, submitting his case through the Drum of Direct Appeal. It passed through the Secretariat and reached the imperial ear. By imperial decree, the matter was referred to the Kaifeng Prefecture for action. The prefectural authorities dispatched an official document to Shengshui Abbey, ordering the local earth god to burn the pouch and expel the malevolent spirit, yet the affliction persisted. Another petition was made, and the Daoist Registrar Qian Junping was summoned. He prepared talismans and ritual documents, along with paper money and horses of gold foil. Together with Bao Zheng, Academician of the Dragon Diagram Pavilion and Prefect of Kaifeng, they journeyed to Shengshui Abbey. There, they prayed to Zhenwu and burned the talismans and documents toward the north.

That very night, no laughter or voices were heard in Chai Miao’s chamber. Half a month later, at Shengshui Abbey, every night at the second watch, sounds of flogging and interrogation—like those of a prison—echoed from the western corner, along with the cries of a woman. Suddenly, one night, she wailed outside Chai Xun’s gate, calling out to Chai Miao: *"You have ruined me! Because Zhenwu accepted your complaint, I was seized and interrogated. Sent to the earth god of the capital, I endured half a month of brutal torture, suffering endless agony. Now, by Zhenwu’s mercy, I am spared the punishment of the iron rod and banished to Mount Yin, to serve as an innocent female ghost for three hundred kalpas before returning to the world of the living to be reborn among the spirits. I have come to tell you this."*

From then on, Chai Miao recovered. Prefect Bao Zheng reported the matter in full and presented it to the throne. Chai Miao was summoned and, upon audience, petitioned: *"I humbly request an assignment to accumulate my salary and hold a grand *luotian* ritual, offering it to the Supreme Divinity in repayment."* The emperor approved, granting the Jade Ford Garden for the construction of a ritual altar and the holding of a grand vegetarian feast to give thanks for Zhenwu’s protection of the state and salvation of the people.

**The Bewitchment of Anren**
Sun Jian, Observator of Fuzhou, had a son named Anren, aged seventeen. Granted the title of *Sanban Jiezhi* and appointed Tax Supervisor and Patrol Inspector of Longmen Town in Fengzhou, he took up his post. After half a year, his spirit waned, his speech became erratic, and his duties neglected, leading the prefecture to dispatch an official to replace him. Seeking medical treatment at home, his condition did not improve.

One night, Sun Jian heard women’s laughter and conversation in Anren’s chamber and realized he was bewitched by a malevolent spirit. The next morning, he pressed his son for answers, who at last confessed: *"The earth goddess Xianghua of Mount Hou in Longmen Town has been entangling me. She comes every night at the third watch and remains until sunrise, when she vanishes like dust."*

Sun Jian presented the matter at court. By imperial decree, a master of the Hanlin Academy’s Exorcism Bureau was dispatched to perform rituals, but after half a month, the spirit remained. Another memorial was submitted, and the matter was referred to the chief ministers. They deliberated that Sun Jian’s household had not properly worshipped the protective deities of the home, allowing a mountain spirit from another region to bring misfortune. He was advised to hasten to a Daoist abbey and earnestly beseech Zhenwu for protection.

Following the imperial suggestion, Sun Jian personally wrote a petition and journeyed to the Abbey of the Four Saints, where he made a vow and borrowed a sacred portrait of Zhenwu to enshrine at home. On the seventh night, as the first watch began, sounds of weeping were heard from Anren’s chamber. By dawn, Anren awoke as if from a deep intoxication, his speech no longer erratic.

Anren recounted: *"Upon arriving at my post in Longmen, I was patrolling the horse stations and spent a night at the post station on Mount Hou. At the third watch, I suddenly saw lanterns glowing before the outer woods. Before my tent appeared a beautiful woman, her attire and manner unlike any mortal. Lowering her sleeves, she spoke softly: ‘I am no ghost or demon—do not fear. Our bond was fated long ago, and here we were destined to meet. I am the daughter of the Dragon Lord of Xiangpu, but for my longing for the mortal world, the Eastern Peak demoted me to serve as the earth goddess of this mountain. People call me the Xianghua Goddess, for I possess the essence of a half-immortal. How could I bear to part from you?’

‘Now, because your parents have invited Zhenwu to descend upon your home, countless celestial soldiers and day-patrolling spirits have surrounded the house to search for me. If I am seized, I will be beaten with iron rods and condemned to the lowest ranks of ghosts, forever barred from the mortal world. Thus, I must take my leave and return to Mount Hou.’ With tears, she took a small jade comb from her hair and gave it to me, saying, ‘Hide this in your hair. When we meet again, it will serve as proof.’"*

When examined, the comb was no ordinary object. It was presented to the throne and placed in the Divine Instruments Bureau of the Inner Treasury. Sun Jian further petitioned to hold a grand *luotian* ritual and a grand vegetarian feast at the Abbey of the Four Saints to repay the debt of gratitude. The chief ministers said to him: *"At first, we did not believe, but now the truth is manifest. Truly, households that worship Zhenwu receive responses beyond all imagining."*

**The False Accusation of Lu Chuan**
Pei Zongyuan, Gentleman for Court Service and Vice Director of the Ministry of Merit, was dispatched as Judicial Commissioner of Guangdong. While passing through Mount Hualan in Shaozhou, he fell ill as if afflicted by a miasma. He could not sleep at night, and his speech became disordered. Despite medical treatment, the cause of his illness remained unknown.

An official remarked: *"I have heard that when Your Excellency arrived at Mount Hualan, it was known that this place is haunted by the lingering souls of those who died unjustly, their spirits bound to this mountain. The Fivefold Dao Magistrate of Iron Wind Cave oversees them in great numbers..."*

There was, however, a divine practitioner named Du Guli from the city below, skilled in ritual and healing. He was summoned without delay. No sooner had Du Guli entered the second gate of the Judicial Commissioner’s office than he declared: *“I see an official in green robes, his face twisted with grievance and injustice, clinging to the Commissioner’s life.”*

The assembled officials asked: *“What deity is this?”*

Du Guli explained: *“I was once a scholar, but the True Lord Zhenwu, taking pity on my humble station and my devotion to the Dao, transformed me into a wandering physician. He anointed my eyes with medicine and bestowed upon me a scroll of exorcistic arts. Since then, my remedies have never failed to heal. I set up an altar with fragrant flowers, pure water, and incense to honor Zhenwu, establishing a ritual precinct. I used a bolt of yellow silk twelve feet long, inscribed with cinnabar the talismans of Shangqing, and burned them facing north while reciting invocations. I arranged ritual swords, hung the talismans of the Five Directions and the Six Ding spirits, girded myself with the sash of the altar’s straightway, and prepared forty-nine earthen vessels and forty-nine lamps. I consecrated the brush and ink of the Judicial Commissioner’s scribe, recited the *Willow Sprig* and *Pure Water* incantations, and invoked Zhenwu to descend in spirit. I commanded the attendant talisman-spirits to bear my petition upward and report to Heaven.”*

Once the ritual was complete, he instructed the Commissioner’s household: *“If Zhenwu descends, do not be alarmed.”*

On the third invocation, the deity suddenly manifested. From within, a maidservant was seized and brought before Zhenwu’s altar. Through her, the spirit spoke: *“I am Lu Fu, Judicial Officer of Dezhou. Commissioner Pei Zongyuan was once the Prefectural Judge of my district. Due to a feud with my late father, the Assistant Minister, he conspired with his subordinates to exact vengeance. Under false pretenses, they accused me of administering improper medicine on an imperial mourning day, imprisoned me, and tortured me without cause until I confessed to treason. I died under duress, my grievance unredressed. As my allotted lifespan was not yet spent, I was consigned to Iron Wind Cave on Mount Hualan for custody. I had no means to plead my case—until Pei Zongyuan passed through this mountain and encountered my wronged soul, which has clung to him ever since. Only because his fortune and lifespan remain vigorous have I not yet taken his life. Now that Zhenwu, the Fortune God, has descended to your residence to expel this malevolent affliction, I beg you to take pity on my unjust death. Do not send me back to Iron Wind Cave. Let me be cleansed with ritual water and receive Zhenwu’s decree. I shall face east and pay homage to my original master, the Most High Lord Lao, the Celestial Master of the Golden Portal. Thereafter, I shall be reborn into a prosperous family as a son, and I shall also serve in office. A talisman-spirit will be dispatched to Iron Wind Cave on Mount Hualan to strike my name from the register of wrongful dead, so that no further confrontations may occur.”*

The moment the maidservant was released, Pei Zongyuan immediately recovered. He then took gold, silver, and other valuables from his household and traveled to Tianqing Abbey in Guangzhou, where he sponsored seven days and nights of repentance rites and thanksgiving offerings. He also provided for the abbey’s Daoist priests and rewarded Du Guli. A memorial was submitted to the throne, and an imperial edict soon followed, appointing Du Guli as Assistant Instructor of his home prefecture. Pei Zongyuan, from that time forward, maintained the worship of Zhenwu without fail for the rest of his life.

Wang Hu fell into the scheme.

The Court Gentleman for Summons, Bureau Director of the Ministry of War, and concurrently Military Commissioner of Dizhou, Qian Tingnian, respectfully submits: The Judicial Commissioner of Dizhou, Bureau Director of the Bureau of Operations, Yao Zi, has frequently been on leave due to illness, and at times, he falls into madness. When he quarrels with others, blood flows from his nose and mouth, and he cannot sleep day or night. Upon recovering and being questioned, he claims to have no recollection, only that he felt as though he were bound and seized in the wilds, with someone holding power over his life. This has persisted for three years, and no physician has been able to cure him. Later, when the Transport Commissioner Chen Yuan spoke of the Daoist priest Song Zhicai of the Five Marchmounts Abbey in the Eastern Capital, who treats such afflictions with talismanic water and incantations, Song Zhicai—currently serving as Daoist Registrar of the Right Street—was summoned to the palace for an audience. As he could not be privately requested, the matter of Yao Zi’s condition was duly recorded and submitted to the throne. By imperial grace, Song Zhicai the Dharma Master was dispatched to Yao Zi’s residence in Dizhou. There, an incense altar was set up within the household. First, a talismanic memorial was burned, and a spirit-officer was dispatched with a treasure-talisman to enter the Heavenly Gate and report to Zhenwu, beseeching the granting of divine radiance to descend upon the place of prayer. Then, the brought-along portrait of Zhenwu was displayed, and ritual implements for the water-contesting rite were arranged as offerings. It was the fifth day of the fifth month, and incense was burned in vigil, awaiting Zhenwu’s descent. A scribe was ordered to stand by with paper and brush, ready to transcribe the deity’s words as they were spoken.

At approximately the hour of *you* (5–7 p.m.), Yao Zi was seen with disheveled hair, bursting from his bedchamber with a great cry and rushing out. He knelt beneath the incense altar and transmitted in a spirit-possessed voice:

"I am Wang Hu, formerly Registrar of Tongcheng County in Shuzhou. In the early years of the Qingli reign, Yao Zi served as Magistrate of Taihu. While on official duty, we were both dispatched to Dayun Granary to supervise the weighing of tribute grain. Yao Zi, however, was solely responsible for overseeing the silver and gold. He colluded to falsify the records, shortchanging the official tally of wheat by eighty *shi*. At the time, unaware of his scheme, I merely followed procedure, countersigning the vermilion registers and submitting them to the prefectural and transport authorities.

Later, Yao Zi learned the matter had been exposed. He sent a messenger from Taihu bearing a letter and gifts—six black-lacquered, gilt-iron *chong* vessels. When I asked for the letter, the messenger claimed it had been ruined by waves while crossing the river. Upon inspecting the gifts, I saw they were indeed water-damaged and salt-encrusted. The letter was soaked beyond legibility. The messenger pleaded for me to keep the vessels temporarily while he hurried back to Taihu to fetch a replacement, promising to return with a reply. Unsuspecting, I agreed.

Afterward, no replacement messenger arrived. Suddenly, the Shouzhou Investigation Bureau issued a summons, and I was arrested, imprisoned, and interrogated alongside Yao Zi. We were both charged with colluding to embezzle gold and silver from Dayun Granary. Officials then went to my home and retrieved the six *chong* vessels Yao Zi had sent. After washing and examining them, they found one to be gold and five silver.

Only then did I realize I had been ensnared by Yao Zi’s scheme. With no means to defend myself, I was overwhelmed by rage, which struck my heart. I died in obscurity, and Yao Zi shifted the blame entirely onto me, escaping punishment in the mortal realm. They claimed I had died, leaving no evidence. Yet in the registers of the Eastern Peak’s netherworld, my lifespan was unmarked—I had died wrongfully and was not fated to be taken. Thus, I remained bound in the dusty kalpa, with no way to escape.

Three years ago, I encountered my enemy Yao Zi on the banks of the river in Shuzhou. We have been entangled ever since, and I demanded he accompany me to the Eastern Peak to confront the matter. Fortunately, Zhenwu has descended today. I have received his decree, which will liberate my wronged soul and sever my ties with Yao Zi. By his grace, I am granted documentary proof to register my rebirth in the netherworld. From now on, there will be no further disputes."

After a long while, Yao Zi regained consciousness. Yan Nian and others reported the matter to the throne. Yao Zi was subsequently dismissed from office and returned to Huzhou, where he donated two thousand strings of cash to Shuzhou’s Lingxian Abbey to expand the Zhenwu Pavilion.

**Chen’s Wife Attaches Her Spirit**
On the twenty-first day of the sixth month in the second year of the Chunhua reign, Qin Zhongli, a Court Gentleman for Ceremonial Service and Gatekeeper of the Watch, was dispatched to oversee military equipment in the Qin-Feng Circuit. Zhongli had served Zhenwu faithfully all his life, maintaining morning and evening incense offerings without fail.

Upon receiving his commission, he carried with him a silk scroll painting of Zhenwu. Arriving in Jingzhao Prefecture, he paid his respects to the prefect, Chen Yan, who said:

"I have a son, Jingren, now twenty-four years old. He was married to a woman of the Zhang clan, but after just one year, she died of consumption. Jingren contracted the same illness. At times, he seems deranged—laughing or weeping, singing or muttering to himself. Occasionally, he claims his wife is with him in the chamber, their voices mingling with ghostly wails and spectral speech, accompanied by eerie knocks and crashes. We have sought physicians and exorcists, but to no avail."

Zhongli replied, "For now, return to the post station. I shall purify my heart, and come to examine the case tomorrow morning."

That night, Zhongli took lodging at the post station. He lit incense and hung the silk scroll painting of Zhenwu he had brought with him, first offering sincere prayers. At dawn the next day, Zhongli personally carried the scroll, hastening on foot to the prefectural hall. He set up the painting of Zhenwu before Jingren’s chamber, arranging pure offerings, and instructed Prefect Chen and his entire household to devoutly hold incense and pray. Then, Zhongli entered the room with an incense burner in hand to observe Jingren. He asked about Jingren’s birth year and month, the duration of his illness, and recorded the details in a memorial. That same day, before the image of Zhenwu, he burned talismans, spirit-money, and paper horses as an offering.

On the fourth day, while Zhongli was in his quarters, at the fourth watch of the night, he heard someone knocking at the door. A voice said: "I am Niannu, the granddaughter of the late Vice Minister Zhang Sheng of the capital. I married Chen Jingren, but before a year had passed, I contracted consumption and grew gravely ill. The physician mistook my condition for blood stasis and prescribed the wrong medicine, which wrongfully took my life. Thus, my lonely soul remained ungathered, drifting in the mortal realm—day and night bearing this grievance. Three months ago, Jingren went hunting outside the city, and I was able to attach my spirit to his body, sparing myself from wandering the wilds and being driven away by the local earth deities. Now, with the arrival of Your Honor bearing Zhenwu into this residence and setting up offerings before Jingren’s chamber, I have been pressed by the divine might and have no place to hide. By the mercy and virtue of Zhenwu, his envoys seized my soul and brought me before the august deity. Moved by my grievance, he granted me willow-branch purifying water to cleanse my spirit and bestowed a prophecy, absolving my karmic debt so that I need not pass through the courts of the underworld. Now, I am to be reborn in the household of Marshal Luo Zongfu, once more as a woman. I have come to express my gratitude before departing."

Zhongli recorded every word and went to inform Prefect Chen. Jingren had already recovered as if nothing had ever ailed him. Chen, deeply moved, submitted a memorial detailing the events. He willingly relinquished three ranks of his official position, and both he and his son Jingren were granted imperial grace to retain their titles. Chen further recommended Zhongli for promotion, who was then appointed East Upper Gate Attendant and Defense Commissioner of Xiongzhou. Jingren, originally appointed as an attendant of the Imperial Ancestral Temple, was not demoted. Chen donated five thousand strings of cash to construct the Hall of Zhenwu’s Manifest Merit within the Supreme Clarity Purple Ultimate Palace. He petitioned for an inscribed plaque, and by imperial decree, it was bestowed the name "Hall of Universal Compassion and Divine Response."

**The Ghostly Fetus of the Wang Clan**

Wang Yaonian, Gold Department Staff Supervisor of Shuzhou, had a daughter aged thirty-one who had carried a ghostly fetus for two years. Despite seeking physicians, none could cure her. Not only were her parents deeply worried, but the daughter herself was constantly distressed, even attempting to hang herself in the rear garden. Suddenly, she heard a voice from the air calling out: "Do not recklessly cast away your life. This is your five-hundred-year-old karmic debt. Why not appeal to the household deity?"

The girl looked around, but saw no one. Returning home, she told her mother. The so-called household deity was Zhenwu, though the family had no sacred image of him. They then invited Master Chen Juxun, a Daoist priest from the Lingxian Abbey, to set up a ritual altar in their home. He dispatched talismanic envoys to the celestial courts, beseeching divine descent to absolve Wang’s past karma and relieve her of the ghostly fetus. The entire household waited devoutly for the priest’s response.

On the twenty-first day of the tenth month, at noon, a red glow the size of a rice bowl suddenly filled the house, swirling before the altar. It descended upon the daughter, who spoke: "In a past life, I sold poison to an old medicine woman, who used it to induce abortions. Among those harmed was a noble life, which I destroyed, leaving it with no hope of rebirth. For this sin, I was condemned to be endlessly reborn as a venomous serpent. This lifetime, you encountered this vengeful spirit in your womb, which fed on your blood and flesh, swelling your chest and threatening your life. When you sought death in the rear garden, you encountered my retinue. Now, moved by your family’s devotion, I have descended. I shall permanently remove this grievance, and there will be no further reckoning. Tonight, at the first quarter of the second watch, set out forty-nine lamps in a circle on the ground before the outer grove. Offer fine incense, purifying water, spirit-money, and paper horses as substitutes for your body. At the end of the fourth watch, call out your childhood name, birth year, month, day, and hour, and burn the substitute gold paper for the vengeful spirit of your past life. The fetus will naturally dissipate within days."

Master Chen bowed in gratitude. The red glow gradually dispersed, signaling Zhenwu’s departure. Yaonian burned memorial papers and drew up a vow: once his daughter’s affliction was resolved, he would donate their residence and rear garden to serve as a palace for Zhenwu’s divine descents. Indeed, his daughter’s condition improved within the promised time.

Word spread of how Wang’s daughter had been saved by Zhenwu, and it was said her destiny was now noble. Yaonian was appointed Vice Prefect of Xiangzhou and moved to a new residence. Soon after, Prefect Xie Fangping of Shuzhou, seeking a match for his second son Jingxiang, formally betrothed him to Wang’s daughter.

Yaonian then converted the donated house and garden into a temple complex. Coordinating with local officials and the provincial surveillance commission, he petitioned the court for an inscribed plaque. The Secretariat’s response instructed that as Yaonian’s personal donation was insufficient to complete the project, an imperial decree was issued to construct the Three Pure Ones’ Precious Hall and the Northern Culmen’s Seven Primes Hall. The temple was bestowed the name "Temple of Divine Mercy and Salvation."

*Records of the Divine Manifestations of the Dark Heavenly Emperor, Volume Five—End*
*Records of the Divine Manifestations of the Dark Heavenly Emperor, Volume Six*

In the second year of the Zhihe era, Emperor Renzong fell gravely ill. According to the Ministry of Rites’ verification, the memorial submitted by Master Wang Bochu of Songyang Abbey on Mount Song was to be presented to the Northern Culmen. To ascertain the emperor’s lifespan, the petition had to be offered on a *gengshen* day, with the emperor personally inscribing the memorial. That night at the hour of *xu*, the emperor knelt in earnest supplication beneath the stars. The following morning, Bochu would surely know the details of the memorial.

On the appointed *gengshen* day, the emperor ordered palace attendants to prepare paper and brush, transcribing the petition on his behalf. At the hour of *xu*, it was burned under the open sky. The next morning, when Bochu was summoned, he reported: "Last night, no memorial reached the celestial realm. I fear the emperor did not inscribe it himself, and the petition lacked devotion, thus failing to reach the heavenly court." The emperor then redoubled his sincerity, personally inscribing the memorial and burning it that night in solemn prayer.

The next morning, Bochu was summoned and immediately offered congratulations: "I witnessed the memorial from last night, delivered to the court of the Great Emperor of the Northern Culmen in the Central Heaven. Upon review, it was sent to the Divine Protector Zhenwu’s abbey for verification. After seven days, the outcome will be confirmed." Bochu personally saw the memorial—seven sheets in all—and recited it silently from memory, finding not a single discrepancy. The emperor rejoiced.

Seven days later, Bochu again appeared, dismissing all attendants to report: "Just now, at the Oxherd and Weaver constellation, I encountered the imperial procession. The Divine Protector Zhenwu has graciously extended Your Majesty’s lifespan by one *ji* (twelve years). Upon returning to the Western Gate of Heaven, I saw General Ge stretching his arms, reminding Your Majesty not to forget his merit."

Once the emperor’s health was restored, Wang Bochu was appointed Supervisor of the Two Streets in the capital, abbot of the Five Marchmounts Abbey, and bestowed the title "Purple-robed Master of the Divine Dharma of the Qianyuan Grotto." The emperor, deeply moved by Zhenwu’s manifest grace, ordered the supervising officials to swiftly renovate the ancestral halls and pavilions within the palace. He further instructed the Ministry of Rites to compile and disseminate records of Zhenwu’s protective interventions. In gratitude for the extension of his lifespan and General Ge’s intercession, a Hall of Repaying Grace was erected beside the Zhenwu Hall, where incense and prayers were offered.

**Relieving Disasters Through Scripture Distribution**
In the Southern Capital’s Yingtian Prefecture stood the Supreme Clarity Hongfu Abbey, originally established by Emperor Taizu to honor the first merit of heaven’s favor. During the Dazhong Xiangfu era, Emperor Zhenzong, while on a ritual progress, lodged there and witnessed the nocturnal descent of the Northern Zhenwu, who declared himself the emperor’s guardian. Zhenzong later bestowed upon the abbey a golden statue of Zhenwu and an inscribed plaque in his own calligraphy.

In the winter of the Zhihe era, as plague ravaged the military and populace, a ritual was held at Hongfu Abbey, yet no response was felt, causing widespread unease. One night, Zhenwu appeared in a dream to the abbot, Daoist Ren Kangzhi, saying: "I have observed the winter plague in the Southern Capital. Print and distribute the *Sutra of the Supreme’s Exalted Teachings on Zhenwu* to afflicted households, instructing them to venerate and recite it." Ren Kangzhi complied, and the sick recovered.

Coincidentally, the court was then mobilizing troops for a southern campaign, yet no soldiers were lacking. Shen Li, the capital’s Military Commissioner and Remonstrance Grand Master, memorialized the throne. The Secretariat reviewed the matter, noting that Hongfu Abbey’s Zhenwu Hall was built in response to a prior divine manifestation. Now, the winter plague’s resolution—through the dream-inspired distribution of scriptures—had averted a major disaster and supported the southern campaign. The emperor thus granted the abbey a three-year exemption of taxes and bestowed upon Daoist Ren Kangzhi the privilege of overseeing its incense and attendants. The Southern Capital’s inspector was further charged with repairing any damage to the abbey’s halls. Such was the efficacy of divine power.

Chen Gongchen, Judicial Officer of Huaiyang Commandery, had in his youth acquired a tortoise. Its shell was a lustrous green, overlaid with golden-green down, its eyes crimson, its tail long—about the size of a small cup. He kept it for five or seven years, and by the time he passed the imperial examinations, the tortoise had grown to the size of a basin. It favored jujubes and was kept in a bamboo basket. One bright moonlit night, a family member playfully lifted the tortoise, only for it to shrink its body into its shell, now no larger than a bowl, while a small crimson-spotted snake coiled around it in play. Chen pondered: the tortoise and snake were the celestial gate and earthly pivot, emblems of the True Martial Fortune Deity. The next day, the tortoise had resumed its former size, the snake nowhere to be seen. This occurred for several nights. Chen then commissioned an artisan to cast an image of the True Martial Sage, set a large vat of pure water, and placed the tortoise within as an offering.

Later, while overseeing the construction of earthen walls in Xinyang, Chen commanded two thousand laborers. During a winter of rain and snow, more than half the workers fell ill and collapsed. One day, Chen drifted into a dreamlike reverie and saw his tortoise address him: “For years, you have cared for and revered me. Now, summoned by the Son of Heaven, I am to ascend to heaven. Yet I know the Judicial Officer is burdened by the suffering of these laborers, so I come to express my gratitude. Prepare a bowl of pure water, take a willow branch, face north, and recite this incantation: *‘Celestial Stem, Celestial Pivot, dispel the storm and mist. Bestow your hidden merit—let wild calamity swiftly depart.’* Recite it three times in one breath, then sprinkle the water upon the afflicted. They will surely recover, and you shall receive imperial favor in time.” The tortoise then took its leave.

Chen followed the instructions, reciting the incantation over the water and sprinkling it upon the sick. In no time, they broke into sweat and revived. On the very day Chen received the dream, the great tortoise transformed into a gust of black wind and vanished. The Xinyang wall was completed without loss of life among the laborers, their deliverance attributed to the divine convergence of the True Martial’s tortoise and snake. Fiscal Commissioner Fei Qiang documented the event and memorialized the throne. An imperial rescript followed, permitting the erection of a stele in Xinyang and the construction of a True Martial Hall to maintain its incense and offerings. Chen Gongchen was specially appointed Vice Minister of the Court of the Imperial Regalia and promoted to Gentleman for Fostering Service. The true Dharma spread, and merit flowed like coin.

In Fengxiang Prefecture there lived a wealthy man named Zhong Shou’an, whose entire household was avaricious and bloodthirsty, perverting justice in all matters. Only his great-grandson Jinming lamented his inability to admonish them. On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, as monks held the Ullambana Festival, Jinming saw hell scrolls displayed in the monastery—depictions of karmic retribution in their hideous forms. Stricken with remorse, he began reciting sutras and donated his personal wealth to others. One day, a Daoist appeared, begging for "free-heart coins." His appearance was most peculiar, so Jinming invited him to a teahouse in the market and asked, "What is your surname and native place?" The Daoist replied, "I am Pei Guo of Wudang." He had come to Fengxiang but encountered no one receptive. Jinming said, "I wish to learn a formula to save those lost in delusion." The Daoist picked up a coin from the ground and handed it to Jinming, saying, "Guard it well, guard it well." Then he turned west and departed. Jinming examined the coin and saw it bore the inscription *qian zhong* ("weight of the firmament"). He kept it on his person.

Later, he met a man carrying a sandalwood-carved statue of the True Martial for sale. Jinming spent seven strings of cash to redeem it. Since his grandfather and father despised deities and Buddhas, he entrusted the statue to Daoist Lu Yuanzhi of Tianqing Abbey for safekeeping, visiting daily to tend its incense. After nearly a decade, he found his prayers increasingly efficacious.

One night, Jinming fell into a stupor and collapsed in his chamber. In a vision, the Daoist who had given him the coin called out: "You carry my coin—use it to save those who died unjustly. Soak it in water, and when you see me, administer it; there will be a response." Jinming awoke at dawn and sought out Daoist Sun Junzhi to inquire about the True Martial’s origins. Sun replied: "The True Martial was born into the Guo clan of Zhengle Kingdom, studied under the Most High Lord Lao, and cultivated the Dao on Mount Wudang. During Empress Wu Zetian’s reign in the Tang, he incarnated in the household of Minister Pei, vanquishing demonic youths." Hearing this, Jinming realized he had encountered the True Martial’s divine manifestation.

Thereafter, he patrolled the streets and alleys, seeking those afflicted with fever, thirst, or pestilence—those who raved and threw themselves into wells or rivers. He took the coin to Tianqing Abbey, immersed it in pure water, and burned incense before the True Martial, praying for the descent of sacred qi and true Dharma into the water to heal the suffering. As he prayed, the holy image suddenly radiated a halo of flame, filling the chamber with golden light. He then carried the consecrated water from door to door, administering it to the afflicted, who all recovered. Word spread throughout the prefecture, and the people flocked to pay homage to Jinming. Yet his uncles and cousins, consumed by envy, sought every means to harass him.

Jinming secretly attempted to remove the original True Martial statue entrusted to him, intending to wander elsewhere with it. Yet no matter how he tried, the statue would not budge. Even when more than a hundred men joined to lift it, the image remained fixed to its altar. Unexpectedly, an imperial envoy arrived at the prefecture bearing a decree from the Central Secretariat, based on a memorial from the Bureau of Astronomy: recently, a five-colored auspicious radiance had appeared, ascending to the Gate of Heaven, and was determined to have manifested within the borders of Fengxiang Prefecture—a sacred treasure of wondrous virtue and honor. The prefect, along with all officials down to the magistrates, was ordered to conduct a thorough search. After careful deliberation, the prefectural authorities concluded that only Zhong Jinming’s enshrined True Martial exhibited such divine marvels. Officers were dispatched to retrieve it, and with merely one or two men, the statue—along with its altar—was effortlessly lifted and carried away.

Jinming was then dispatched by the prefecture under official escort to present the offering to the imperial court. When the small sandalwood-carved True Martial statue was unveiled before the throne, several beams of light suddenly burst forth. The emperor rose from his seat, burned incense, and paid reverence, then temporarily enshrined the image in the Upper Clarity Palace of Extended Blessings. Awaiting the deliberation of the Three Departments on the matter’s details, further actions would be taken. Thus was the *Zhenhe Xingfu* [True Martial’s River-Stabilizing, Blessing-Bringing] statue established.

Rén Yuè, an Attendant of the Inner Palace of the Inner Court’s Esteemed Rank, was appointed as Pacification Commissioner of the Qinfeng Circuit’s Cavalry. While crossing the Yellow River at Dizhou, he encountered dense wind and fog at midstream. His attending officials remarked: "This is the first perilous pass of the Yellow River—the northern bank of the parched mouth at Yaomen Gorge. Here stands a hall of the Tianqing Abbey of Youzhou, allocated a share of its incense offerings, named the Protector-State True Martial Sanctuary. All who pass must first cast paper horses as tribute."

Rén Yuè prayed to the empty void, vowing to offer additional sacrifices upon crossing. No sooner had he finished than the clouds and wind abruptly stilled. He and his retinue all beheld a divine figure manifest in the sky, whose form they recognized as the True Martial of Blessing, the very image enshrined in the Four Saints Abbey of the capital. Rén Yuè prostrated himself upon the boat and, rising, received True Martial’s descent in speech akin to mortal conversation: "This hall was established by Emperor Taizong of Tang in honor of his meritorious minister Wei Zheng, who composed the *Pillar-Stabilizing Inscription* for its founding. To this day, this place remains the most treacherous frontier of the sanctuary’s domain. From henceforth, I have been stationed here to safeguard the mountains and rivers for the state. Yet the hall has long stood in disrepair, and my descents to subdue dragons and miasmic spirits find no refuge. Were I not here, the waters and droughts would surely wreak havoc, bringing no small harm to the realm. You must record this without fail, and reveal no secrets—report only to the imperial ear. Speak of this to others, and you shall suffer the karmic retribution of sores and boils." With that, the vision vanished.

Upon returning to court, Rén Yuè presented the matter to the throne, though the emperor remained skeptical. When Rén Yuè imprudently reiterated the account before the court, his voice failed him mid-speech, and he soon suffered the foretold affliction of sores and boils. Thus convinced, the court appointed him to oversee the capital’s palace affairs and ordered the relevant offices to consult the *Veritable Records of the Great Tang*, then dispatch a palace envoy to collaborate with Dizhou’s local officials in rebuilding the hall. The emperor bestowed the name *Pacifying Peace, Blessing-Bringing* as its plaque, establishing it as a permanent site for incense offerings and ritual observances.

At the Fusheng Taiyi Abbey of Longhushan in Xinzhou—a sacred precinct of the Fourth Grotto-Heaven, passed down through the lineage of Han-dynasty Celestial Master Zhang—a fire had ravaged its halls seven years prior. Though repairs had been made incrementally, the vast Northern Culmen Hall remained unfinished. One day, a merchant from Quanzhou arrived to sponsor a vegetarian feast. Calculating the timber and materials required for the Northern Culmen Hall, he pledged to fund its entire reconstruction. When the abbey inquired into his intent, he recounted: "Former Chief Minister Chen, while sailing home to Quanzhou from Guangzhou, was accompanied by his steward Gao Kui. As their ship neared their native shores, a contrary wind set them adrift. The minister burned incense and prayed to the void, vowing to seek deliverance. The storm instantly calmed, and ahead, suspended in the sky, appeared a top-knotted Daoist, who declared: 'Minister, your peril was grave. I have turned the wind to spare you from drowning. Now I shall ensure your family’s safe return to Quanzhou.' The minister burned incense in gratitude and asked which sage had manifested to save them, swearing to engrave the debt upon his heart and bones in perpetual reverence. The figure replied: 'At the Taiyi Abbey of Longhushan in Xinzhou, the Northern Culmen Hall has lain in ruins for seven years, uncompleted. I was dispatched by the Heavenly Marshal to seek one with karmic affinity. Today, having saved you, I need not rely on petitions—you may now fulfill this vow.' With that, he vanished into the clouds. Moments later, the ship reached Quanzhou’s shores. The household reflected that the top-knotted sage must have been the True Martial Sovereign, manifesting to deliver them. Thus, they sent Gao Kui to verify the abbey’s condition.'"

Gao Kui returned with the calculations, and over the next three years, the merchant funded the hall’s construction and its sculptural adornments. Former Chief Minister Chen Zhichun then submitted a memorial, requesting an imperial plaque to honor the deity’s miraculous deliverance. By imperial decree, the request was granted, and ten ordination certificates along with five hundred taels of silver were bestowed to aid the reconstruction, further endowing the abbey’s permanent endowment. The minister also sponsored a grand repentance ritual in the Precious Hall of Thanksgiving and a grand vegetarian feast to repay True Martial’s manifest grace.

During the Sui dynasty, Hé Quán, a garrison soldier of Qianzhou, accompanied Pacification Commissioner Zhāng Yòu to Nankang, where they visited the Grotto of the Great Clarity at Mount Lu’s Taiqing Abbey. There, on True Martial’s birthday, he encountered his parents in the Jasper Jade Heaven. Having received imperial permission to retire at his convenience, Hé Quán thereafter enshrined a silk painting of True Martial. He compounded medicines for sale, and over five to seven years, all who consumed them recovered. Thus, he amassed wealth exceeding two thousand strings of cash. One day, he told his wife: "My brother is young, and I, though lowly—a tattooed soldier—have served the state for thirty years without betraying its trust. By good fortune, I encountered True Martial’s birthday assembly and was granted imperial leave. Now, with ample means, I shall set aside one thousand strings for your daily needs and the sale of my medicines. The other thousand I shall take to the Tianqing Abbey of Mount Lu to construct a seven-bay Dharma Hall."

Upon its completion, an imperial envoy, Chén Bóhǔ, arrived to offer incense and present a golden dragon. Palace Censor Yàn Liángbì and the prefect of Nankang Commandery visited the grotto and, seeing Hé Quán’s donation, expressed admiration. Bóhǔ remarked to Liángbì: "Such deeds should be reported to the throne." Moments later, a white deer darted from behind the Dharma Hall into the mountain forest. Liángbì ordered men to pursue its tracks into the woods. They returned, reporting: "The white deer vanished, but within the forest stands a hermitage where a soldier was sleeping. Roused by our entry, he fled the woods."

The Daoist assembly remarked, "This must have been Hé Quán manifesting as the white deer." Later, the imperial envoy returned to court and reported the matter. By imperial decree, he was ordered to consult with the former Jiangxi Pacification Commissioner, Zhāng Yòu, regarding Hé Quán’s encounter with the True Warrior on his birthday. After review, Hé Quán was posthumously bestowed the Daoist title *Jūshì* (Lay Daoist). A shadow hall was established in his honor, a stele inscribed with his deeds, and the Gǔyán Grotto of Yáoyù Heaven was renamed Yáoyù Cavern Heaven.

Hé Quán lived to eighty-three and passed peacefully in the mountain hermitage behind the hall. The Daoist assembly cremated his remains on the mountain, gathered his ashes and bones as relics, and enshrined them in a sculpted likeness for veneration. Before half a year had passed, by imperial command, Hé Quán’s title was elevated to *Yìngmèng Xūjí Xiānshēng* (Master of Dream-Responding Emptiness). It remains unknown what divine sign from the court prompted this honor.

**The Wu Clan’s Karmic Affinity**
Dù Guī, magistrate of Wǔpíng County in Tíngzhōu, lost his sight and returned home for medical treatment, enduring six years of blindness. He had married the eldest daughter of Hào Yù, a minister from Jiànzhōu. During childbirth at twenty-seven, his wife received a talisman and scripture from the Daoist Zhōu Míngyàn, which preserved her safety. From then on, she vowed to venerate the True Warrior, uphold vegetarian precepts, and study Daoist scriptures. Seeing her husband’s blindness, she would, in the stillness of each night, prepare fine incense and pure water, face the northern sky in the open, and prostrate herself seventy times in seven cycles, praying for the True Warrior’s compassion to heal his eyes.

After two years, on the third day of the third month, at the third watch of the night, she dreamed of a Daoist in yellow robes who said: "Sincerity of heart is not as potent as bodily purity; weighty intent is not as profound as karmic affinity. Within seven days, someone will come to treat Dù Guī’s eyes. Once his sight is restored, seek me at Yúncāng to repay your master’s debt." With that, the Daoist vanished.

Seven days later, Hào’s wife saw a Daoist at her gate, his fan inscribed: *"Yúncāng Daoist, skilled in curing eye ailments."* She summoned him, and he examined her husband’s eyes, inserting two needles at the corners and leaving two medicines to be taken thrice daily with water. Once consumed, they would take effect. The Daoist accepted no payment and departed, vanishing without a trace. Following his instructions, she administered the medicine until it was exhausted.

One night, Dù Guī dreamed a small tortoise crawled onto his face and licked his eyes. He brushed it away, awakening to find his sight fully restored. Reflecting on the medicine and the tortoise, he realized the True Warrior had manifested his divine power to heal his blindness.

Later, hearing her father Hào Yù had been appointed prefect of Tàiyuán, she accompanied her husband there. One day, they ventured beyond the western city gates to Tiānzhù Abbey, located on a mountain called Yúncāng. Entering the mountain, they found a hall where a deity’s statue had been defaced—its eyes gouged out. Upon inquiry, they learned it was the sacred image of the True Warrior. Hào’s wife suddenly understood the Daoist’s earlier words: *"Meet me at Yúncāng to repay your master’s eye debt."*

She recounted the story to her father, who then funded the restoration himself. He memorialized the circumstances: how Dù Guī had resigned due to blindness, how the True Warrior’s divine intervention had healed him, and how he had been reinstated through official recommendation. An imperial edict followed, ordering Hào Yù to complete the restoration of the statue on Yúncāng Mountain before submitting a separate report. In recognition of his merit, Dù Guī was promoted to Judicial Officer of Yángzhōu.

**Manifestations of Divine Power**
The Central Secretariat, the Chancellery, the Three Departments, and the Ministry of Rites verified the case of Zhōng Jìnmíng of Fèngxiāng Prefecture. He had selected fine sandalwood to carve an image of the True Warrior, which he entrusted to the Daoist Lù Yuánzhì of Tiānqìng Abbey for veneration. Zhōng attended to the statue daily, ensuring incense and offerings were never lacking. The True Warrior appeared to him, teaching him to measure water for healing the sick. A radiant golden light blazed forth, aligning with the celestial river. The Bureau of Astronomy reported the phenomenon, noting its appearance in the region of Qín—present-day Fèngxiāng Prefecture—signifying the presence of an ancient, miraculous, and virtuous sacred image.

Officials were dispatched to investigate and retrieve the True Warrior’s pedestal. By imperial decree, it was sent to the Shàngqīng Yánfú Palace for veneration. Zhōng Jìnmíng was appointed to an honorary position in three ranks, and, while still at home, he performed the rites of gratitude to the court. Within three days, he fell ill and died.

Yet, as the local community attested, after Zhōng’s death, the saint’s miracles became even more manifest, with prayers answered and blessings granted. Later, Sūn Chéngzhī, Hanlin Academician and Vice Minister of Justice, was dispatched as an envoy to the Western Barbarian lands. While passing through Fèngxiāng Prefecture, he encountered a Daoist in hempen robes and straw sandals who approached him, saying: "Your fate, sir, does not align with this journey. When you turn back, you will face peril and distress, and upon returning, you will surely die."

Chéngzhī asked, "Who are you, and how do you foresee such things?"
The Daoist replied, "I was once Zhōng Jìnmíng, a commoner of Fèngxiāng. Now, I am the master of Qiónghú Cave on Sānluó Mountain, overseeing the Jade Peak Dragon Pool. I have attained the rank of a half-immortal. Just now, I saw a black aura above your head, countered by a white aura—an ominous sign. It foretells peril on your journey and death upon your return."

Chéngzhī pressed further: "If such disaster awaits, how may it be averted?"
Jìnmíng said, "In your hour of greatest danger, invoke the sacred title of my master, the True Warrior, the Spiritually Responsive Perfected Lord. You will surely receive his protection. Though you may escape the barbarians, I fear you will still face calamity upon returning home." With that, he vanished.

Chéngzhī entered the barbarian lands and was received by the barbarian king Lǐ Xījìng at a banquet. There, he was asked to compose a short verse on the theme of the seven characters "the sun and moon rise in the east and set in the west," but none could match his response, provoking Lǐ Xījìng’s wrath and threat of imprisonment. In his terror, Chéngzhī silently invoked the sacred title of the True Warrior, the Spiritually Responsive Perfected Lord several times. An official then pleaded on his behalf, gradually calming Xījìng’s anger, and he was released.

Upon Chéngzhī’s departure from the barbarian lands to return to the capital, before even crossing the border, a surveillance envoy traveling with him submitted a full report. Suddenly, an imperial commissioner arrived bearing orders to take charge of the matter. Chéngzhī’s entire retinue, along with the barbarian king’s return gifts and official correspondence, was confiscated. Charged with humiliating the nation during his mission abroad, he was specially granted poisoned wine to drink, with the command to accept his fate without protest. Moments later, another imperial commissioner arrived bearing a decree: Chéngzhī was spared execution but stripped of all previous ranks and reassigned to a remote, undesirable post as a supervisory official.

As the emperor reviewed the account of Zhōng Jìnmíng’s divine intervention, recognizing how the True Warrior’s compassionate virtue had manifested, he ordered the half-immortal to be entrusted with protecting the nation and saving its people. Acknowledging that the True Warrior’s protection had spared Chéngzhī from death, the emperor commuted his sentence. He commanded the construction of a shrine to Zhōng Jìnmíng in Fèngxiāng Prefecture, appointing him an honorary post in the Three Ranks with the title of Acting Officer. After Jìnmíng’s death, his spirit manifested, and he received a prophecy from the True Warrior, confirming him as a disciple of the master. Thus, his shrine was to be arranged with two halls in the front, and the True Warrior’s hall behind. The emperor permitted the original likeness of Jìnmíng to be sculpted, depicting him in the white robes of a commoner to signify his rank as a half-immortal. He further bestowed upon him the posthumous title of *Shàndǎo Ānjì Xiānjūn* ("Virtuous Guide, Serene and Tranquil Immortal Lord") and granted the two auxiliary temples the nameplate *Bàocí Miào* ("Temples of Repaying Compassion"). The prefecture was ordered to commission and erect a stele inscription to ensure his legacy endured forever.

On the fifth day of the third month in the second year of the *Lìqìng* era, the Chancellery and the Secretariat received a memorial from Zhengzhou Prefecture, reporting that Zōu Sù, the Wine-Monitor and Inner Palace Venerable Officer of the prefecture, had served with integrity in his post. He devoted himself solely to the worship of the True Warrior, his devotion sincere and reverent. He never resorted to flattery or deceit in his prayers, nor did he ever act against righteousness—greedy, cruel, or wantonly taking lives. Whenever the people of the prefecture suffered from floods, droughts, or epidemics, and their prayers to other deities went unanswered, if Zōu Sù fasted and prayed before the True Warrior in his own home, his supplications were always efficacious. The people said that Zōu Sù had awakened to the sacred teachings and secretly formed a bond with the divine, and thus Zhengzhou had received his hidden blessings.

One day, at noon, Zhengzhou was struck by a sudden storm of wind and hail, and dark clouds swirled on all sides. At the northern gate, a black mist coiled, and from it descended an uncovered bronze coffin. Ethereal music filled the air. From the magistrate down to the common folk, all changed into ceremonial robes and entered the coffin, yet none were permitted to remain within. Then the Wine-Monitor Zōu Sù arrived, clad in his official robes, and only when he stepped inside did the coffin lid suddenly close with a resounding clang. The coffin then rose lightly into the air, accompanied by the cries of cranes and the celestial decree, while auspicious vapors and heavenly incense lingered, refusing to disperse. The coffin drifted slowly toward the due north and vanished.

Later, the monks of the *Yánshòu* Monastery on White Lotus Mountain, led by the monk Zhìrén, submitted a report stating that the previous evening, the mountain had been enveloped in five-colored auspicious clouds, and celestial music had been heard, along with an extraordinary fragrance. Flowers rained from the sky, and after the mist cleared, sweet dew descended, persisting until the watches of the night had ended. The next morning, the monks gathered and ascended the mountain, where they found that a peak called *Péngcháo* ("Roc’s Nest") had two stone cliffs on either side, originally separated by over fifteen paces, now miraculously joined. At the seam where the northern cliff met, a small stone gate, four feet square, had appeared. Within, a bronze coffin was visible.

The withered trees on the mountain, both above and below, suddenly sprouted fragrant branches, transforming in an instant into a lush forest. Flowers bloomed in profusion, and birds and beasts flew and cried as if in protective vigil. The cause of these events remained unknown. The prefectural authorities deliberated and concluded that the bronze coffin that had descended from the heavens the previous night had indeed borne Zōu Sù away. They assembled the local officials, clerks, Daoist priests, and Buddhist monks to verify the matter, and it was confirmed as true.

The memorial continued, reporting that a subsequent divine decree had descended upon Zhengzhou, stating that Zōu Sù had recently departed in spirit to the Inner Palace to take his leave, saying: *"I have received the celestial mandate to serve as Vice-Judge of the Northern Culmen Longevity Bureau. Once each year, I shall accompany the True Warrior in descending to the mortal realm to tally the good and evil of the people, assess their lifespans, and receive the True Warrior’s protection and prophecies. Having enjoyed the emperor’s salary and favors, I have come to express my gratitude."*

The decree further ordered an investigation into whether Zōu Sù had any descendants to inherit his blessings and continue the line of his kin in service. If he had none, a generous stipend of money and silk was to be provided for their support. Additionally, a shrine was to be constructed for Zōu Sù on White Lotus Mountain, to be named *Shényìng Fǔjūn Miào* ("Temple of the Divinely Responsive Prefectural Lord"), to serve forever as a place for invoking his miraculous traces.

**Heaven-Bestowed Green Dates**
In Lèpíng County of Ráo Prefecture, there lived a certain Zhū Mù, a Judicial Officer of the Jiangzhou Regiment, who had no children. Before his father, Zhū Kàng, passed away, he had instructed him: *"Never forget the incense and offerings to the True Warrior’s sacred hall. On every occasion of his monthly descent, make sincere offerings. On the third day of the third month, the fifth day of the fifth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, and the ninth day of the ninth month—these four days—prepare offerings in triplicate and present them with utmost devotion."*

Zhū Mù had never once disobeyed his late father’s instructions. On one occasion, it happened to be the seventh day of the seventh month, the day of the True Warrior’s sacred descent. That night, after the offerings had been burned, around the third watch, his wife dreamed of a Daoist priest in yellow robes, who presented her with a stone dish bearing a single green date, urging her to eat it. After she did, her mouth was filled with an extraordinary fragrance. The Daoist said: *"This is a date bestowed by the immortals of heaven."* Thereafter, she conceived and gave birth to a son, whose bearing was elegant and whose memory and intelligence were exceptional. By the age of five, he was already remarkably quick-witted.

At the age of seven, his innate brilliance shone through, his name resounding across the four directions—truly a divine prodigy. In accordance with his mother’s dream, he was named Tianxi. When the imperial court investigated and learned of this, officials also put forth recommendations. He was promptly granted the provisional appointment of *Dali Pingshi* and, still in his youthful bonds, was brought by his father, Zhu Mu, to the palace. There, he expounded upon histories and classics without error, discoursing on the annals with such fluency that his responses to the emperor’s questions flowed like a river. The emperor bestowed upon Tianxi the provisional title of *Jia Chengwulang*, along with one hundred strings of cash for purchasing books, and instructed him to return home for further study. At sixteen, he was to present himself at court to await further orders. His father, Zhu Mu, was also granted an official post without the need for repayment, and both father and son received imperial commendations in the form of written edicts.

**The Divine Red Tassel**
In Yiyang County of Xinzhou, there lived a silk merchant named Lu Zhongdao, whose wife, Madam Zhang, had reached the age of forty-four without bearing a child. One day, Zhongdao suddenly said to her: *"I have heard that many people make offerings to the True Warrior of the North, and their prayers are never left unanswered."* Thereupon, he redeemed a Sichuanese painting of the True Warrior and brought it home to venerate. Day and night, Madam Zhang prayed with utmost devotion, never once forgetting, even in the bitterest cold or the most sweltering heat. Six years passed in this manner.

One night, Zhongdao and his wife shared the same dream: they were competing with immortal youths to toss a colored ball into the air. As they gazed upward, a red tassel suddenly flew into Madam Zhang’s mouth and was swallowed. From that moment, she conceived. After thirteen months, she gave birth to a daughter. By the age of thirteen, the girl was extraordinarily beautiful, yet she had never spoken, and people called her the "mute girl."

Yiyang County received an official dispatch from Xinzhou, relaying a letter from the central secretariat. The Bureau of Astronomy had reported that a bright star had recently appeared in the southeastern region, corresponding to the celestial domain of Chen, which governed Yiyang County. It was believed that an extraordinary immortal had descended in mortal guise. The county magistrate was instructed to investigate. Upon inquiry, it was discovered that only Lu Zhongdao’s thirteen-year-old mute daughter fit the description. Zhongdao was summoned and, after recounting the circumstances, the county memorialized the matter to the provincial authorities, who in turn petitioned the imperial court.

Upon hearing this, the mute girl suddenly spoke. She demanded fragrant water for bathing, changed into clean clothes, and sat upon a pure mat. To her parents, she said: *"I was originally a celestial maiden from the Palace of Heavenly Transformation, a disciple of the constellation of the Twin Maidens. As the foremost among the heavenly youths and maidens, I was known as the Jade Maiden of Green Mist. Every seven years, I descend in rotation to serve as the vice-director of the Northern Culmen’s Protective Victory Abbey, accompanying the True Warrior on his inspections. Recently, moved by your daily prayers to the heavenly court for an heir, the True Warrior reviewed the ledgers of karmic causes. Though my mother’s destiny did not originally include bearing a child, the True Warrior, considering your lifelong devotion to his altar, first petitioned the Three Heavens on your behalf. Then, he transformed me into a red tassel and sent me into my mother’s womb. For over a decade, I have remained as your daughter, fulfilling your earnest prayers. When I descended into the womb, the True Warrior instructed me never to speak while in the mortal realm. Though I have been by your side all this time, I have never uttered a word. Now that my term is complete and the imperial edict has revealed the celestial secret, I can no longer remain. I must take my leave."*

Zhongdao and his wife then had artisans seal her body in lacquered cloth, fashioning it into a statue, which they placed beside the True Warrior’s image. Daily, they offered incense and performed meritorious deeds, holding vegetarian feasts to repay the True Warrior’s benevolence.

Later, the imperial court bestowed silk and grain as tokens of auspicious omens accompanying the birth of a divine being. The county was instructed to record her words as they were spoken and to report the full account of her transformation. Another edict from the central secretariat was sent directly to Yiyang County, ordering that the intact body of the mute girl be buried in an official plot within the county town. A pavilion was to be built over the grave, and a separate shrine erected, where a statue of the mute girl in plain immortal robes would be enshrined. The shrine was to be named *"The Silent and Radiant Filial Maiden,"* and a stele was to be erected to commemorate the event.

**The Twin Blessings of Prince Jing**
During the Guangming era of the Tang, the Daoist temple of the Empress’s Meritorious Virtues in the Mysterious Capital had fallen into disrepair over the years. The Daoist community repeatedly petitioned for donations, but not a single contribution was received, leaving them at a loss.

A Daoist priest named Wang Zhenyuan remarked: *"This temple houses an image of the True Warrior. Why has he not yet bestowed his favor?"* That very night, Zhenyuan dreamed that someone delivered a pile of gold coins to the temple, stacking them before the True Warrior’s hall—five hundred strings in total—before loading them onto a horse and ascending to heaven.

Less than ten days later, officials from the household of Prince Yan, including the palace attendant Sun Weiyan, arrived at the True Warrior’s hall to make offerings. They presented a stack of paper money, funds to purchase a horse, a censer of aloeswood, and a memorial petition. The offerings were made on behalf of the Prince’s Consort, Lady Yiguo, who was in difficult labor. A Daoist priest had approached the prince with a petition to donate toward the reconstruction of the temple in Xiying Town. The prince had dismissed him, saying: *"My consort is in peril during childbirth."* The Daoist replied: *"There is a method to ensure a safe delivery and the well-being of both mother and child."* Overjoyed, the prince declared: *"If this proves efficacious, I shall rebuild the temple entirely at my own expense."*

The Daoist wrote a talisman on yellow paper with cinnabar, burned it to ashes, and mixed it with water for the consort to drink. Shortly thereafter, she gave birth to a son. The prince submitted a petition, and the Daoist took his leave, vanishing without a trace.

The consort recounted: *"As soon as I drank the talismanic water, I saw officials and attendants before me. In the darkness, a golden-armored, sword-wielding deity with disheveled hair shouted, and at that very moment, my son was born."* She also heard a report: *"This child comes from the Mysterious Capital Temple in Xiying Town. Hasten there to protect Prince Jing."*

Thus, the prince presented the money, horse, and other offerings, verifying the temple’s dilapidated state. He also inquired whether any Daoists had come to the capital to solicit donations.

The Daoist community replied: *"No one has come to the capital to solicit donations."*

Prince Jing then presented a memorial to the throne, dispatching gold, silver, coins, and silks to extensively renovate the temple. By imperial decree, one hundred ordination certificates were bestowed to aid in the reconstruction. Upon completion, a grand jiao ritual of celebration and repentance was held. The consort personally prepared her dowry goods, sold them, and used the proceeds to gild the temple’s Three Clarities sacred images and the True Warrior’s statue. She also commissioned a thousand scrolls of silk paintings depicting the True Warrior, which were distributed to the palaces of imperial kinsmen, the entire court, and the households of civil and military officials for reverent veneration. The temple, favored by imperial grace, was renamed the *Venerable Numinous Response Sage Temple*, and a stele was erected to record the event.

Lady Jiao—wife of Wang Zhi, Successor to the Military Commissioner of Wu’an Army and Grand Commandant of the Palace—had borne no children. By nature, she delighted in goodness and yearned for the Dao, devoutly maintaining incense offerings. One day, while strolling in the rear garden, she noticed a withered branch on a pomegranate tree spontaneously engulfed in smoke and flame. Alarmed, Lady Jiao rushed to extinguish it, and the fire vanished. Before the tree appeared a divine figure, radiant with a halo, disheveled-haired and sword in hand, treading upon tortoise and serpent—unmistakably the True Warrior Perfected Sovereign. Lady Jiao prostrated herself: *"Today, I am blessed to encounter the Supreme Perfected. I humbly beseech your compassion and deliverance."* The True Sovereign asked: *"You have seen me—what is your heart’s desire?"* Lady Jiao replied: *"I wish for an heir."* The True Sovereign said: *"On the third day of the third month, come to Zuozhen Temple outside the Xuanhua Gate. I shall grant you an heir, who will attain future nobility."*

As Lady Jiao bowed again, the deity vanished. She returned and recounted the encounter to Wang Zhi. On the third day of the third month, they journeyed to Zuozhen Temple. That day, a vegetarian feast was held to celebrate the True Warrior’s birthday, drawing throngs of men and women. Suddenly, a shaven-headed boy of six or seven tugged at Lady Jiao and Wang Zhi, begging for money. Upon closer inspection, his appearance was extraordinary, unlike ordinary folk. When questioned, he said: *"I have no parents, no kin. For years, I have wandered among temples, seeking shelter and food."* Lady Jiao took him home to raise, and he proved naturally intelligent.

At eight years old, Wang Zhi petitioned to recognize him as his own son. The emperor summoned him and asked: *"You once claimed to have no children—how now do you have a son of your own flesh?"* Wang Zhi could only recount the encounter with the True Warrior and the granting of the child. The emperor marveled in astonishment for a long while, then inquired about the boy’s birth date. Uncertain of his origins, they took the day he was found at Zuozhen Temple—the third day of the third month, at the *si* hour—as proof. By imperial order, he was sent to the Bureau of Astronomy to determine his fate.

The divination revealed that at eight years old, Wang Zhi’s destiny aligned with the five stars and the *Room* constellation, foretelling sixteen military achievements on the frontier. His fortune would arise from the *Deep Ditch* water star, flowing from due north, granting him authority and power. Thus, the emperor bestowed upon him the name *Wang Yuan* and appointed him as *Right Attendant Forbidding Guard* and *Inner Palace Venerable Rank*. He was further betrothed to the Third Princess of Yue, with the wedding to be solemnized at sixteen, upon the granting of separate betrothal gifts.

At fourteen, Wang Yuan was honored with the title *Gatekeeper of the Palace* and accompanied his father to court audiences. He underwent the palace examination, passed the military examination, and was awarded the *Rite of Accompaniment*. At sixteen, the betrothal gifts were presented, the marriage rites completed, and he was enfeoffed as *Defense Commissioner of Binzhou* and *Commandant-Escort to the Princess*. He petitioned the throne to use his salary and dowry funds to construct the *True Warrior’s Precious Pavilion* at Zuozhen Temple and requested an imperial plaque for its dedication.

**The Child Attendant’s Dream-Response**

East of Mount Kuaiji in Yuezhou lies the *Yangming Grotto-Heaven*. Since King Wenmu of the Qian lineage established the *Dragon Auspice Palace* there, it had fallen into deep ruin over the years. Within it stood the *True Warrior’s Hall*, most dilapidated of all.

On the first night of the second month in the first year of *Chunhua*, the *Wenyi Empress* dreamed in the *Jade Florescence Palace* of a young attendant with unbound hair, clad in a plain robe, who approached and said: *"I am a child attendant of the Dragon Auspice Palace in Yuezhou. Our temple has grown so impoverished that we have no clothes to wear, no shelter to dwell in, and suffer exposure to the elements. Only the Empress can save us—I shall repay this kindness in time."* Then he transformed into a radiance and vanished.

At dawn, she recounted the dream in full and memorialized the throne. An emissary was dispatched bearing incense to investigate the Dragon Auspice Palace. The eunuch in charge questioned the temple’s caretaker, who reported: *"This palace was built at the end of the Tang dynasty. Over the centuries, it has fallen into complete ruin. Only the True Warrior’s hall remains, its retinue of deities left exposed to rain and sun, toppled to the ground."*

The Empress then realized that the dream of the previous night was a divine manifestation of the True Warrior, who had come to beseech the imperial harem to restore the palace and revive its incense offerings. She memorialized the throne, and permission was granted for her to devote her dowry treasures to the cause. These were exchanged for ordination certificates, purple robes, gold, and silver, and an eunuch was dispatched to oversee the reconstruction in Yuezhou, with a year allotted for completion—rebuilding the halls and refurbishing the sacred images.

Once the work was finished, the Empress suddenly fell ill, afflicted with *counterflow stomach* for over forty days, resistant to all medical treatment. Then, one day, she slipped into a trance, her breath faint and shallow. As her qi gradually returned, the retching ceased, and she recovered naturally.

She recounted: *"Just now, I saw the True Warrior descend from the clouds to express his gratitude for the restoration of the Dragon Auspice Palace. Though my life was not yet forfeit, the illness had lingered long. He commanded a child attendant to bring a pure vase and a clean bowl, then poured the *Five Directions’ Sweet Dew Jade Nectar* from the vase into the bowl and urged me to drink. As I did, I felt a soothing warmth suffuse my heart, my chest and diaphragm cleared, and the malady vanished at once. When I opened my eyes, it was as if the dream had never ended—only the strange fragrance lingering in my mouth and the lightness in my limbs remained. I rose and moved as before, a clear sign of divine responsiveness."*

The court, in gratitude, twice offered grand sacrifices and augmented the rites, repaying the god’s favor. The *August Sage descended to the mortal realm*.

The Jade Flower Palace of Great Purity atop Great Luo Mountain in Qingcheng, Chengdu Prefecture of Yizhou, ranks as the fourth of the nation’s sacred mountains and cavern-heavens of august blessings. Each year, golden registers and jade talismans—scriptures left behind by the Perfected Lord of the True Realm upon his ascension—bestow twelve annual edicts of divine grace. During the *mingdao* era, on the fifth day of the fifth month, the medicinal market of Chengdu Prefecture convened, and by the sixth day, Daoist wanderers from the ten directions, clad in cloud-and-water robes, flocked to the palace to attend the seventh-day feast celebrating the Heavenly Ascent of Zhenwu. It was customary for immortals to descend and manifest transformations, ascending to heaven in broad daylight.

At that time, a certain Daoist, his robe hem trailing a turtle’s tail, was deemed a spectral aberration, and all shunned him. Suddenly, this man appeared with Kou Keming, son of Kou Tong, the prefecture’s commander of horse and foot, atop a high peak. The crowd suspected the youth had been bewitched by the uncanny figure and sent soldiers to seize him. The Daoist vanished in a flash of white light, and Keming, unaware, plummeted. From that moment, his heart ceased its beat, he refused all food and drink, and fell mute. His father, Kou Tong, was later transferred to serve as garrison commander of Yuanliang Stockade. For seven years, Keming lived with his family in Xingyuan Prefecture.

In the third year of the *qingli* era, on the fifth day of the fifth month, before dawn, Keming slipped away from home and vanished without a trace. Later, he was found at the Jade Flower Palace in Yizhou, walking alongside the same turtle-tailed Daoist from the previous year. The palace invited both to the feast. As the meal progressed, only Keming remained visible; the Daoist had disappeared, much to the astonishment of all. By the ninth course, a great turtle suddenly appeared beneath Keming’s seat. As he rose, the turtle bore him aloft into the empty sky, where auspicious clouds gathered, and Keming ascended seated upon its back.

Later, at Yuanliang Stockade, his father Tong saw his son Keming come to bid farewell: “I have now been appointed as the adjudicator of the Seven Primes’ Lifespan Bureau in the Lower Northern Culmen. By the grace of my master Zhenwu, I was carried to heaven upon this great turtle.” Subsequently, Chengdu Prefecture submitted a memorial reporting the name of the ascendant from this year’s medicinal market. In response, an imperial decree ordered an inquiry into Keming’s meritorious deeds. According to Kou Tong’s sworn statement, Keming was originally a boy purchased with money and silk from a passing Daoist. Daily, he cultivated his conduct, studied the *Daodejing* of Laozi, burned incense at night, paid homage to the Northern Culmen, and ceaselessly recited the sacred name of his master Zhenwu. He abstained from forbidden foods, observed frequent fasts, and never engaged in the slightest deceit or dishonesty.

Following a rescript from the Chancellery, it was decreed that in various regions, such manifestations of august sages descending to the mortal realm to deliver souls and enable their ascension were not uncommon. Chengdu Prefecture was thus ordered to construct a shrine and hall, appointing Daoists to conduct rites and erect a stele in commemoration. Keming was specially enfeoffed as *Lingxian Zhenjun* (“Perfected Lord of Numinous Manifestation”), and the shrine was named *Lingxian Ci* (“Shrine of Numinous Manifestation”). Upon verifying Keming’s ancestral origins in Qianhao Township of the Western Capital, a shrine was also established there.

Additionally, Chen Chou, concurrently serving as Vice Minister of Justice in the Ministry of Punishments, Prefect of Yingzhou, and Commander-in-Chief of the Gaoyang Pass, submitted a memorial: In the fourth year of the *xingyuan* era of the former dynasty, seven brothers from the Northern Barbarian lands, led by the barbarian official Yishouxian, arrived at the border with a cartload of credentials and goods—felt, silk, incense, and merchandise worth over fifty thousand strings of cash—to be sold at the government’s trade office. They requested that the proceeds be temporarily deposited in the official treasury, with the understanding that upon their return to the barbarian lands, they would arrange for the remaining goods to be transported and the money retrieved. Fifteen years passed with no word.

Later, when the Great Ancestor ascended the throne and performed the suburban sacrifice to Heaven, Yingzhou lacked the funds—over fifty thousand strings—to reward the troops. Unexpectedly, Yishouxian and his brothers reappeared, submitting a petition offering their deposited money to the government for the troop rewards. Thus, Yingzhou drew upon these funds, and the distribution was completed without deficit. Zheng Du, the prefect of Gaoyang Pass, summoned Yishouxian and his brothers to inquire into the matter. The money they had deposited was not their own property but had originated in the *xingyuan* era, when the Great Ancestor, then serving as a commander under Emperor Shizong, was stationed in Yingzhou. One day, the Star of Venus descended and transformed into a white-robed Daoist, who admonished the Great Ancestor to accumulate virtue and benevolence, foretelling that his future eminence would be extraordinary.

The Great Ancestor asked, “What numinous efficacy does Heaven possess to aid my rise to eminence?” The Daoist replied, “Along the frontier, there are rebellious barbarians and treacherous ministers whom the court has entrusted you to suppress. The present pacification of these rebels is due to the unseen protection of Zhenwu of the Northern Culmen.” With these words, the Daoist vanished in a flash of white light.

Thereupon, the Great Ancestor held a grand seven-day-and-night jiao offering in Yingzhou, burning paper money to the celestial bureaus and over fifty thousand strings’ worth of gold paper. However, the celestial ledgers revealed that this sum of gold paper was not to be accepted and was instead forwarded to the Northern Culmen for disposition. The Office of Zhenwu of You Sheng Monastery issued a memorandum to the Seven Primes of the Northern Dipper, who oversee accounts. The seven brothers—Yishouxian and his kin—were in fact the seven attendants of the Seven Primes.

At the founding of the Great Song, with the establishment of the imperial enterprise, Zhenwu memorialized the Three Heavens, detailing how the unclaimed jiao money from the former dynasty was to be returned to the new Song for frontier troop rewards. The Seven Primes were dispatched, assuming the guise of barbarian officials under the name Yishouxian, to convert the money into felt, treasures, and other goods worth approximately fifty thousand strings, which were then deposited in the prefectural treasury. A hundred li beyond the barbarian frontier stands a temple named Shouxian Temple, a shrine to the Four Saints, where the seven attendants of Zhenwu’s retinue are depicted. Each wears a headband, a yellow robe, holds a green fish, girds a white silk sash, and wears boots. Representing the five directions and five colors, the Seven Primes and Seven Celestial Bodies, they assist Zhenwu in overseeing the karmic affairs of good and evil throughout the world—such is the true form of Yishouxian and his six brothers.

Upon questioning, Yishouxian and his companions vanished before the hall like a sudden gust of wind. At that time, Prefect Tong and others submitted a joint memorial to mitigate their offense, and a subsequent imperial decree ordered that the money first be allocated for frontier troop rewards, with further investigation to follow.

**The Manifestations of the Two Perfected Ones**
Shi Guangzu, Grand Master for Assisting the State and newly appointed Prefect of Zhen Ding Prefecture, concurrently serving as Military Commissioner and Pacification Commissioner of the Hebei West Circuit, was en route to assume his post when he stopped for the night at Yuantong Temple in the prefecture of Chan. There, he heard of a Daoist in the temple, originally from Wudang County in Dengzhou, surnamed Guo. For fifteen years since his arrival, he had never spoken to anyone, tending only to rare and novel vegetables each season to supply the temple’s vegetarian kitchen. Guangzu, accompanied by the temple’s supervising monk, visited his hut that night, where the Daoist emerged to greet them. Once seated in his quarters, the Daoist suddenly spoke, addressing Guangzu: “Grand Master, do not proceed to Zhen Ding. The appointed time has come, and your facial qi portends only a few days remain.” The temple monks, overhearing this, were astonished and doubtful. By the following morning, the Daoist had vanished without a trace, and all his vegetable seeds had reverted to common varieties.

Thereupon, Guangzu declined the appointment to Zhen Ding and submitted a memorial requesting retirement to return to Zhaozhou. That very day, at the hour of *chen*, he suddenly called for hot water to bathe, changed into his court robes, and passed away in a purified chamber. Before the prefect of Chan’s memorial could reach the capital, Guangzu’s form dissolved into emptiness and appeared first before the Hall of Sagacious Governance, where he addressed the emperor: “Your servant, upon reaching Yuantong Temple in Chan, encountered the Perfected Guo, an old companion who had concealed himself as a vegetable-tending Daoist for fifteen years to await me. Now he departs. Your servant Guangzu is in truth the Deputy Strategist, Perfected of the Middle Prime, under the True Lord Zhenwu of the Northern Culmen. The Perfected Guo is the Northern Culmen’s Inspector-General, though he was fated to fall at the age of fourteen. I myself was banished for sixty years and, upon the return of the *jiazi* cycle, restored to my original rank. Had I not come to bid farewell to Your Majesty for over thirty years of generous favor, I might never have faced the throne again. Moreover, I have a son, Shi Tingzhi, who, though holding office, fears his foolishness renders him unfit for duty. I humbly implore Your Majesty’s compassion.” With that, he bowed and vanished.

Shortly after, the Secretariat presented the memorial from Chan, which aligned precisely with the recent manifestation, its details clear and unambiguous. Guangzu was posthumously honored as Grand Preceptor to the Heir Apparent, and a hall dedicated to the two Perfected Ones, Shi and Guo, was erected at Yuantong Temple in Chan. By imperial decree, Yuantong Temple was renamed the Imperially Bestowed Hidden Perfection and Heaven-Receiving Abbey, and a stele was commissioned to record the event.

**The Sum of Twenty Thousand Strings**
At Songyang Abbey on Mount Heng in Hengzhou, a True Warrior hall and pavilion—built with funds donated by the Tang scholar Liu Zongyuan—stood as the most exquisite and towering structure in the region. Since the tenure of Abbot Hao Jun, the hall’s daily offerings and alms had accumulated over twenty thousand strings of cash. The former Vice Fiscal Commissioner, Qian Cao, devised a plan and memorialized the throne to temporarily borrow twenty thousand strings from the True Warrior hall’s alms funds, allocating them to Tanzhou, Lizhou, and other prefectures as capital for tribute silk. Five years later, as Qian resumed his duties as Fiscal Commissioner, a Daoist submitted a petition claiming to be a disciple of Songyang Abbey and requesting the return of the twenty thousand strings to repair the leaking True Warrior hall. Qian replied, “This money was borrowed by the state—how could it be reclaimed with a mere petition? Moreover, the True Warrior hall at Songyang Abbey remains grand and sturdy. Though it has recently tilted of its own accord, no disciple has come to the Fiscal Commission to petition for the funds.” Soon after, Qian fell ill, his body covered in white scabs, wracked with pain and groaning. Half a year into his retirement, he dreamed one night of Abbot Hao Jun, accompanied by divine attendants, demanding the return of the twenty thousand strings. Only then did Qian awaken to his error. He sold his property to repay the full sum, vowing to secure his well-being. No sooner had he formed this resolve than his scabs began to heal, and the dreams of debt collectors ceased. Within a month, he fully recovered. He personally journeyed to Songyang Abbey to pay homage to the True Warrior. Before the money was delivered to the abbey, the hall remained tilted, but once the funds were returned, a night of wind and rain culminated in a great thunderclap, and the hall stood straight once more.

Qian Cao was reinstated as a Hanlin Academician and presented the above account of divine response to the throne. By imperial decree, Songyang Abbey’s True Warrior hall was granted an honorary plaque, and a miraculous golden inscription was bestowed. Henceforth, any accumulated funds were forbidden from being borrowed by officials. **Four Thousand Strings of Paper Money**...

In Raozhou’s Poyang County, the Daoist of Minghua Abbey, Huang Zonggu, had once accompanied his master Zhu Shiyuan to Mount Xiadao in Hongzhou. There, he awakened to the Dao and secretly departed for the western lands of Shu, wandering for eight years. In the tenth month of the fifth year of the Dazhong Xiangfu era, Minghua Abbey was struck by a devastating fire, reducing all to ashes—save for a single corridor and a small hall, the True Warrior Hall, untouched by smoke or flame.

Suddenly, an official dispatch arrived from the prefecture, ordering the collection of four thousand strings of official money to compensate Minghua Abbey. Huang Zonggu, who had previously deposited paper money in the capital’s treasury for the abbey’s construction, was summoned upon receipt of the decree. The Daoists of Minghua Abbey, including Zhu Shiyuan, were questioned, and they testified: *"Though we have a disciple named Huang Zonggu, he has been wandering for eight years, and we know not whether he lives or has perished. How could he have foreseen the abbey’s fire? And how could he possess money in the treasury? We cannot readily accept this."*

Within ten days, Huang Zonggu returned in person, bearing the official receipt for the exchanged money from Raozhou. He also brought over a thousand strings’ worth of gold, silver, and ritual vessels from the Bureau of Sacrifices. Addressing his master, he recounted: *"After abandoning you to wander, I entered Ziyan Mountain, where I encountered a Daoist who invited me to his thatched hut for conversation. He said, ‘I have long held a vow, yet it remains unfulfilled. Hear my instructions: I know that in the tenth month of the fifth year of Xiangfu, the Star Lord of Fire Virtue will traverse the celestial division of Chen, casting its light upon Raozhou’s prefecture and counties. All are fated to suffer fire. But the True Warrior petitioned the Northern Emperor and the Fire Star, saying, "The land of Raozhou is kind, its people merciful. Now, as the fire tribulation approaches, I beseech your compassion to mitigate its severity." Gazing upon the map of Raozhou’s counties painted on the rear wall of Minghua Abbey’s Three Clarities Hall, I saw that if the abbey’s Daoist community were spared destruction, the prefecture’s fire disaster might be averted through prayer and supplication. The Fire Star, hearing this, dared not refuse. He asked the True Warrior, "Does this place have a hall dedicated to your worship?" The True Warrior replied, "It does." Thereupon, the Fire Star sighed and declared, "The True Warrior is a disciple of the Most High Lord of the Golden Tower in the Upper Clarity, and thus subject to the Heavenly Lord of the Forest of Suffering. On the day Minghua Abbey is to be consumed by fire, I shall spare its hall." At that time, flee to avoid the flames. Yet I fear no one will remain to restore the abbey. I bid you journey to the Bian River region to raise funds. Once in the Eastern Capital, gather wealth and return to rebuild. I am an old acquaintance from Poyang. When you return to Minghua Abbey, we shall meet again.’ With that, he sent me from the hut. After a few steps, I turned back—only to find the hut vanished, with no trace of the Daoist. Emerging from Ziyan Mountain as if from a mist, I made my way to the Biankou in Sizhou.*

*From then on, I carried the one hundred and twenty divination slips of the Twelve Perfected Lords of the Western Mountains and a portrait of the True Warrior. Resolving to sell divinations, I charged four coins per slip. My arts flourished, and after daily expenses, I often earned five to seven hundred in gold. With the proceeds, I purchased gold and silver wherever I went, entrusting them to others. Over six years, I amassed over five thousand strings of cash, depositing them at the Five Marchmounts Abbey. One day, I met a merchant from Raozhou who informed me of Minghua Abbey’s destruction by fire. Thus, I delivered the money to the capital’s treasury, obtaining an official receipt to reclaim it upon returning to Poyang County. When I arrived home, the abbey had indeed burned—only the True Warrior Hall remained. Examining the statue’s face closely, I saw it was identical to the Daoist I had met on Ziyan Mountain."*

Daoist Zhu Shiyuan and the others then traveled to Poyang County to claim the deposited money and sell the ritual vessels from the Bureau of Sacrifices. Within five years, they had fully restored Minghua Abbey. Huang Zonggu’s account, from beginning to end, was recorded at Raozhou’s request. At the time, Prefect Xie Mao and others submitted a memorial to the throne, attesting to the truth of the matter. Later, an imperial rescript renamed Minghua Abbey as Ning’an Abbey. Daoist Huang Zonggu was honored as Master Tongxiang, granted the purple robe, and the surviving True Warrior Hall was bestowed the additional title *"Guardian of the State."*

---

At Shuiyunhubo, a beggar woman from Shanzhou named Yang Suzhen had frequented the home of Yuan Qing, a minor official in the Ministry of Revenue. Observing that she had no family but possessed a dowry, he lured her away from her hometown. They boarded a boat on Mengyang Lake and spent the night along the reed-lined shore. Yuan Qing plied Suzhen with drink, then pushed her into the deep waters, assuming she had drowned. He hastily summoned the boatmen, claiming, *"The lady, drunk and thirsty, leaned over to fetch water and fell in."* He ordered them to search, feigning grief with hollow wails. Then, he hastened back to the prefecture to arrange a memorial service for her.

Upon arriving in Puzhou, Yuan Qing pawned and sold Suzhen’s dowry items, valued at over a thousand strings of cash, and spent the proceeds, residing there for half a year. One day, in the marketplace, he suddenly saw a plain-clothed woman reciting scriptures and begging for alms. Yuan Qing, believing her to be the ghost of Yang Suzhen, was struck dumb and unable to speak. At that moment, Suzhen cried out to the patrol officers, who escorted her to the prefectural court for investigation. Based on Yuan Qing’s confession, the authorities questioned Suzhen about how she had survived and come to Puzhou. She recounted that her ancestors had served in the imperial bureaucracy, but after the deaths of her parents, she had lived in Shanzhou, drifting into destitution. Though her body had fallen into prostitution, her heart longed for goodness, and she had always venerated the True Warrior, daily reciting Daoist scriptures. At Tianqing Abbey, she had received a donation of a small, gold-lettered copy of the *True Warrior’s Wondrous Sutra*, which she kept in a silk pouch tied within her hair, never parting with it. That night, when Yuan Qing pushed her into the deep waters, she felt as though she were enveloped in mist, her body floating in empty space, while above her head, a wheel of divine light spun, and a voice cried, *"Protect the precious topknot!"* By dawn, the spirits had dispersed, and she found herself on a grassy path by the lake, her body drenched but the sutra and talisman in her hair untouched by water. A nearby household took pity on her, brought her home, and revived her. When she asked where she was, she learned it was Mengzhou territory. From then on, she sold her clothes, exchanged them for plain garments, and recited Daoist scriptures to sustain herself. Passing through Heyang and Puzhou, she unexpectedly encountered her enemy. Had it not been for the sutra in her hair at that moment, she would have sunk to the water’s depths, becoming a wronged and homeless spirit with no hope of deliverance.

The Puzhou authorities, having reviewed the case and found Yuan Qing guilty on both legal and moral grounds, memorialized the throne. By decree of the Central Secretariat, Yuan Qing was denied official pardon and executed according to the law. Suzhen was granted the remaining items from her dowry, which she used to purchase ordination credentials from the Bureau of Sacrifices. She changed her name to Zhongyan and took refuge under the Daoist nun Tang Jintong at Ciqing Abbey, where she took vows and donned the religious habit. Thereafter, she dedicated herself to begging for alms in the streets, raising funds to construct the Three Clarities and Seven Primes Halls, as well as the True Warrior’s Precious Pavilion. Through the celestial mercy of the *Dharma Treasury* as revealed in the gold-lettered scripture, she had saved herself. She printed and distributed five thousand copies of the *True Warrior Sutra*. Later, by memorial of the chief minister Xiang, an imperial edict was issued, bestowing upon Yang Zhongyan the purple robe and the title *"Grand Master of Compassionate Blessings,"* while the abbey’s name was changed to *"Abbey of the Guardian Sage."*

*Wind and Mist Lay Down the Letter*
Wang Yibiao, Director of the Bureau of Imperial Carriages, retired to Suzhou. Reflecting on the taking of life, he resolved to copy a complete canon of scriptures.

Having recruited fourteen individuals, including Chen Fang, they were each tasked with transcribing the scriptures daily before the image of the True Warrior, ensuring meticulous neatness and accuracy without a single character amiss. Among them, Zhou Weiji was notably swift, outpacing the others. Suddenly, however, Weiji’s right hand was afflicted with a wind-borne malady—his sinews stiffened, his fingers clenched, and his brush could no longer move. Though his scrolls remained unfinished, the others pressed on. The thirteen, including Chen Fang, completed their transcriptions, each carefully proofread, while Zhou Weiji’s seventeen volumes were entrusted to Wang Yibiao without further review. All were uniformly bound and prepared for donation to the Abbey of Great Clarity and Extended Blessings.

As this was an inner abbey sanctuary, the matter was first memorialized to the throne. By imperial decree, the eunuch Ren Qi and others were dispatched to oversee the transfer of the scriptures to the Abbey of Extended Blessings. Since no proper canon repository yet existed, the scrolls were temporarily housed in the True Warrior Hall. The moment the hall doors opened, a black mist swirled forth, and a violent wind howled in spirals. Though the storm eventually subsided, when the scriptures were arranged upon the altar, an entire volume slipped free, repeatedly resisting all attempts to stack it. Wang Yibiao examined the fallen scrolls and found them all to be Zhou Weiji’s work. Suddenly, he heard a voice beside him declare, *"All was done in deceit, hastened for gain—errors abound, and the merit is incomplete."* Yet no one stood near, save the clay statue of the *Zhifu* spirit, its back turned. Realizing the impropriety, Wang borrowed an authentic copy to compare and found numerous omissions. He then sought a scribe to fill in the gaps before rearranging the scrolls in the hall.

Zhou Weiji’s affliction worsened—his right hand festered, oozing pus and maggots. Begging in the marketplace, he cried, *"I deceived Master Wang while transcribing the canon, cheating the karmic cause. Now I reap the retribution."* When the eunuch Ren Qi learned of this, he reported it to the throne. By imperial decree, a repository was constructed at the Abbey of Extended Blessings to house the scriptures Wang Yibiao had presented.

**The Fulfilled Divination**
During the Yongxi era, Yang Fang, the diviner-official of the Great Yu Temple in Yuezhou, had devoted his life to venerating the True Warrior. He regularly burned incense and paper offerings on behalf of the townsfolk, and his prayers were never unanswered. When Chen Chou, Vice Minister of Revenue, was unexpectedly summoned to court while governing Yuezhou, he grew anxious, uncertain of fortune or misfortune. Summoning a diviner, his attendants recommended Yang Fang, who served the True Warrior and was most reliable in interpreting divinations. They proceeded to the True Warrior Shrine at Qianming Abbey, where Yang drew the fourth yellow slip of the Perfected Lord Huang. His interpretation was thus: *"This divination foretells a violent death within one hundred and twenty days. Beware the Ghost Gate in the northeast—do not accept authority or lead troops in that direction."*

Chen Chou flew into a rage. He had Yang Fang imprisoned, vowing that if even the slightest misfortune befell him within the allotted time, he would petition to transfer his own office to Yang as a favor. If nothing occurred, Yang would be charged with fraud, spreading panic, and embezzlement, then exiled by law. Yet as the days passed uneventfully, Yuezhou officials released Yang, appointing him as an assistant instructor and reinstating him as the temple diviner.

Meanwhile, Chen Chou arrived at court and was appointed Pacification Commissioner of Zouzhou, concurrently serving as Military Commissioner of the circuit. His mission was to suppress the rebels led by He Qing of Hutou Mountain. As he prepared to depart, he recalled Yang Fang’s divination—though not entirely fulfilled, it seemed ominously accurate. Zhengzhou lay precisely in the Ghost Gate of the northeast, and his new role as Military Commissioner entailed commanding troops. At his audience before departure, he recounted these events to the emperor, then set out for Hutou Mountain to apprehend He Qing. En route, he was ambushed at night. His forces scattered, and in the darkness, Chen fled on horseback—until the beast stumbled, casting him into a deep moat. As he awaited his end, he felt as though a long-haired spirit had seized both him and his horse, lifting them to the bank. Regaining his bearings, he rejoined his troops.

The next day, they regrouped and advanced, slaying He Qing and his rebels. Chen returned to the capital, declining his post in Yezhou. From that day forth, he was stricken with terror, his mind unhinged, and he fell gravely ill. Later, he submitted a memorial, acknowledging Yang Fang’s divination and crediting the True Warrior’s protection for his deliverance. Thereupon, the emperor granted Yang Fang the promised favor and ordered Yuezhou to construct a True Warrior Hall outside the city. Chen Chou, at his own expense, sponsored a grand ritual feast at Qianming Abbey to repay the sagely favor.

**The Soothsayer’s Warning**
Wang Zhong, retired Director of the Bureau of Imperial Carriages in Suzhou, was recalled to serve as Vice Minister of the Directorate of Education. Before departing, he sought a divination before the True Warrior in his family shrine and, receiving an auspicious sign, set forth. Along the Bian River embankment, he encountered a Daoist who merely bowed and introduced himself as a master of physiognomy. Wang invited him aboard his boat and offered tea.

*"Where does the reverend master reside?"* Wang asked.
*"I am a disciple of the Cloud Terrace Abbey on Mount Hua,"* the Daoist replied. *"My surname is Pei."*

Wang offered one hundred and twenty taels of silver for a reading. The Daoist observed, *"Your complexion is radiant—you will soon be promoted to a compilation post."*

*"I already serve as Vice Minister, which involves state compilation,"* Wang replied.

He then inquired about his future rank and longevity. The Daoist rose to leave, turning back to say, *"Remember this: in the future, do not accept any post in the Historiographer’s Pavilion, nor undertake matters in the *geng-xin* direction. If you do, you will die in hunger and snow, your bones left unburied."* With that, he departed eastward, refusing the silver.

Wang Yibiao dismissed the warning. Later, when unrest arose in the Western Regions, the entire court recommended Wang for a diplomatic mission. Though he had been appointed Vice Minister of the Directorate of Education, he was now temporarily elevated to Grand Master of the Palace with Purple Robe and concurrently appointed *Hanlin* Academician of the Celestial Chapters Pavilion. Overjoyed, he had forgotten the Daoist’s words.

Proceeding to the western frontier, he was feasted and questioned by the barbarian lord Li Wanquan, whose words carried veiled mockery, subjecting him to repeated humiliation. As he neared the border on his return, fearing the shame of reproach, he deceived his retinue and fled on horseback into Sheep Mountain, where he was buried by snow in a rocky cave, going ten days without food. Suddenly, the Daoist Pei reappeared, saying, *"I am no ordinary man—I am the Perfected Warrior whom you have long venerated. Had you heeded my instruction and refused the post of Grand Master of the Palace and Academician of the Celestial Chapters Pavilion, this fate might yet have been averted. The *geng-xin* direction is the western barbarian quarter, where you were destined to die of hunger in the snow—today, no less. What can be done now? I shall depart."* Wang, his regret too late, perished in Sheep Mountain, his bones left abandoned. His attendants, fleeing for their lives, returned to the capital, where the authorities interrogated them. Upon investigation and verification, it was confirmed that Wang Yibiao had not been officially dispatched as an envoy, and his failure was thus deemed predestined. Though the Perfected Warrior had protected him and clearly pointed out the path of delusion, he had obstinately refused to avoid it, and so forfeited his life. As for his prior temporary appointment as Grand Master of the Palace and concurrent Academician of the Celestial Chapters Pavilion, no posthumous revocation was issued. Instead, he was granted posthumous rank and emoluments in accordance with the standard protocol for officials of his grade, and his soul was summoned and interred with funeral rites.

Hu Qing of Xianping County in the Eastern Capital abandoned his trade. Hu Qing of Xianping County in the Eastern Capital had made his living selling prepared foods.

Upon the fifth day of the fifth month, as Hu Qing bound and slaughtered a parrot and a goose, his knife suddenly snapped in his hand. The creatures’ lives were spared, but the blade recoiled and gashed his palm, causing blood to gush forth. Recognizing that the wanton killing of fowl and beasts was unjust, Hu Qing abandoned his trade and set out for the capital to seek another livelihood.

Along the way, night fell, and a heavy rain began to pour. Seeking shelter, he took refuge in an ancient temple. Around the third watch, a divine figure clad in golden armor, brandishing a sword and with unbound hair, appeared and roused Hu Qing, saying: *"Know that countless wronged spirits of creatures follow at your side, and dare not enter this gate. You still have thirty years of celestial favor ahead—guard it well."* With these words, the figure trod upon a tortoise and serpent and ascended into the void.

Hu Qing awoke in alarm to find the sky clear and the moon bright. Turning back to the temple, he saw neither statues nor painted images—only a stele bearing the name *Shrine of the Perfected Warrior Who Guards the Realm*.

After more than a month in the capital, his meager funds were exhausted. Reflecting on the Perfected Warrior’s warning of thirty years of celestial favor, he reasoned that military service must be his destined path. He thus devoted himself to mastering martial arts. Within two years, when the imperial court held its grand military examination, he demonstrated unparalleled skill in archery, horsemanship, and the wielding of spear and staff. Among a thousand competitors, he was chosen by the emperor’s brush as first in rank. He was first granted the rank of Palace Attendant of the Third Class, then summoned before the throne. The emperor inquired as to what extraordinary guard he served and where he had honed his martial prowess to such excellence. Hu Qing truthfully recounted his encounter with the divine manifestation and the fulfillment of its prophecy.

Thereafter, he was promoted to Attendant of the Third Class with Duties, later serving long tours on the frontier. He rose to the rank of Workshop Commissioner and once held the post of Chief Military Inspector of Runzhou. For the remainder of his life, Hu Qing reverently tended the incense and flame of the Perfected Warrior.

Zhonghe Resigns Office.

In the eighth year of Tiansheng, Yang Zhonghe, a clerk from Xuzhou in Jingxi, was dispatched to Caizhou to investigate and adjudicate a case of judicial corruption. He sentenced Zhu Xijie to thirteen strokes of the cane. Later, when the supervising official, Vice Prefect Xu Yi, reviewed the case for performance evaluation and promotion, Zhonghe’s merits were deemed insufficient for reward. While in Xuzhou, he arranged a Daoist jiao ritual at Tianqing Abbey to secure divine assistance for his promotion. He invited the Daoist priest Pei Junsou to present a "blue-green memorial" to the Celestial Emperor. Junsou held the memorial in hand, prostrating to the left of the altar for nearly two hours before rising. He then told Xu Yi: "I have reverently delivered your petition to the Jade Emperor’s golden palace. Upon reaching the Gate of the Three Heavens, I encountered the North Pole Purple Tenuity Great Emperor, who was accompanied by the Perfected Warrior, Divine Marshal of the You-sheng Institute, Vice Judge of Good and Evil. The Perfected Warrior, upon seeing your memorial, deigned to speak: 'Xu Yi, while investigating the case of Qian Ju and others in Caizhou, concealed over two hundred thousand in family wealth, colluded with officials to pervert justice, and coerced a blood relative into adopting an alien surname. Yang Zhonghe, for this, falsely implicated the witness Zhu Xijie and unjustly subjected her to corporal punishment. Such grievous wrongs have barred his promotion. Now, his crimes and those of others have been determined, and I shall report them to the Jade Emperor. You are to deliver this memorial at once and return immediately.'"

Thereafter, when Xu Yi’s term ended and he departed, Yang Zhonghe resigned from officialdom and returned home, vowing to atone for his sins through virtuous deeds. He redeemed a sacred portrait of the Perfected Warrior, maintaining perpetual incense and vegetarian offerings, and daily invoked the Perfected Warrior’s sacred name. He welcomed monks and Daoists, as well as the destitute, into his home. When families lacked the means to bury their dead, Zhonghe would sell his possessions to provide funeral funds. Over time, his household declined; his wife fell ill and died. He then sold his youngest son to the household of Squire Li for six thousand coins, which he also distributed to others. Within the prefecture, he earned the reputation of a lay devotee. For twenty years, relying on the support of relatives and friends, he lived in a secluded alley, wholeheartedly devoted to the Perfected Warrior.

One day, a destitute Daoist priest visited and said: "You were once an official, and your sins remain unexpiated. Why have you repented, abandoned your home, and embraced poverty to serve the Perfected One without respite? Yet, your remorse has moved Heaven’s mercy. I possess a text that I entrust to you; propagate its teachings, and it may sustain you." With that, the priest vanished. Zhonghe opened the scroll to find the *Divine Stems of the Twelve Perfected Lords of Mount Xi*. He then prepared one hundred and twenty bamboo lots, storing them in a bamboo tube before the image of the Perfected Warrior. Within ten days, the local populace flocked to consult the oracle, whose responses proved divinely accurate. Each divination commanded a fee of thirty to fifty strings of cash, or at least one hundred coins. Even prefectural officials sought his counsel.

One day, Li Chengdao, the newly appointed Registrar of the Prefecture, sought out Yang Zhonghe, claiming to be his son, sold at the age of seven or eight to a neighbor, Li Fu. At thirteen, he had received an official appointment through the grace of his adoptive grandfather, Assistant Minister Li Zhongli. At nineteen, he passed the selection examination and was assigned to his current post. Learning that his birth family had perished, save for his father Yang Zhonghe, he sent men to search, only to be told that Zhonghe had recently died. All his belongings, aside from funeral expenses, had been confiscated by the authorities. Li Chengdao wept upon hearing this and commissioned rituals at temples and abbeys to offer prayers for his father’s soul.

One evening, as Li Chengdao sat alone in his study, an elderly Daoist appeared in midair and said: "I am your birth father, Yang Zhonghe. You have risen to honor; remain loyal and upright. I repented my sins and took refuge in the Perfected One, receiving the transmission of the *Divine Stems of the Twelve Perfected Lords of Mount Xi* to aid the suffering. My life has now ended. The Eastern Peak recorded my merits, declaring my heart and conduct upright, and appointed me Registrar of Lu Records at Maxi. The Perfected Warrior has further ordained that, upon fulfilling this duty, I shall be granted the office of the Seven Primes. Only one matter remains unresolved: the sacred portrait of the Perfected Warrior I once venerated, along with the divination tools and other items, were confiscated and now lie neglected in the military provisions depot. Retrieve them, enshrine them in your home, and honor them with sincerity; they will assist your virtuous endeavors." With that, he vanished.

Later, when the authorities auctioned the confiscated items, Chengdao redeemed them and enshrined them in his private chapel, offering daily devotion. One day, an imperial emissary, Yuan Liangbi, was dispatched by the court to present a golden dragon and jade tablet at Mount Xiantu in Wu-sheng Commandery as part of a grand jiao ritual for the Empress, who had long suffered from a heart ailment. Passing through Xuzhou, he and Prefectural Vice Governor Luo Zongmeng noticed a crimson glow enveloping a building in the southwest of the yamen. Upon inquiry, they were told that in the Registrar’s office, officials and commoners were burning incense before an old portrait of the Perfected Warrior and a tube of divination lots, the glow lingering unceasingly. Luo Zongmeng and Yuan Liangbi went to observe. Liangbi, testing the oracle’s intent, drew a lot and received the Tenth Auspicious Stem of Perfected Lord Zhong. He personally transcribed the response and memorialized the throne. The Empress Dowager, who had already dreamed of this, gradually recovered. The transcribed lot’s message aligned perfectly with her dream.

An imperial edict was issued to Xuzhou for verification. Li Chengdao was then pressured by Yu Fu, the Regional Judicial Commissioner, who used his authority to demand the Perfected Warrior’s portrait and associated items. Upon arrival at Fu’s residence, the painted silk crumbled into fragments, transforming into butterflies that fluttered into the sky. The bamboo lots, previously claimed by the court, now reside in the Baoying Pavilion of the imperial palace. Chengdao was granted imperial permission to resume his birth surname, Yang, and was promoted to Registrar of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices.

Still, Yang Zhonghe was posthumously enfeoffed as Lord Wuben of the Prefecture. No sooner had Yang Chengdao been promoted than he, too, passed away. Today, in Xuzhou, the ancestral shrine of Lord Yang and his son remains, where prayers are answered with signs.

**Auspicious Responses to a Pious Descendant**
Sun Liangsi, Left Attendant Gentleman of Jingnan Prefecture, devoted his life to the worship of the Perfected Warrior, his reverence profound and sincere, and often received the god’s favor. Observing the mundane world, he saw how many took lives, and each time he reflected: all are bound in the wheel of rebirth—how could one bear to do such a thing? Whenever he went to the market and saw creatures for sale, he would buy them, whether birds to be kept in cages or fish and turtles to be gathered in water vessels, and at dawn, before others had risen, he would release them. For fifteen years, Liangsi naturally attained understanding and awakened to principle; all his deeds were met with wondrous responses, and people called him Master Sun.

One day, he died without illness. His burial was divined to be on the southern slope of Mount Ji. When the grave was opened, a flock of crows carried mud in their beaks. As the earth was piled, a pool of water welled up from the pit, and fish and turtles emerged within it; lingzhi mushrooms grew like canopies upon the ground. As the inner coffin was lowered, five-colored auspicious clouds enveloped the site in all directions. Monks, Daoist priests, and officials of Jingnan Prefecture gathered at the grave, offering incense, flowers, food, and performing conch-and-cymbal rituals.

At the ancestral offering, Prefectural Remonstrance Grand Master Zhang Tinglao, himself a devotee of the Dao and the Perfected Warrior, walked to the graveside. There, a small opening appeared, from which a tortoise and serpent emerged, coiling and leaping in joy. Thus it was known that Master Sun had ultimately become an attendant of the Perfected Warrior of the Northern Culmen. The numinous creatures lingered for a time before vanishing of their own accord.

Since the prefecture had witnessed such a remarkable person and manifold auspicious signs, it was fitting to memorialize the throne. Subsequently, an edict from the Secretariat ordered that a temple be built at Master Sun’s grave, a stele erected to record his holy responses and deeds, and the temple bestowed the name "Shrine of Lord Sun." Thus concludes *Record of the Divine Manifestations of the Dark Heaven Thearch*, Scroll Seven.

*Record of the Divine Manifestations of the Dark Heaven Thearch*, Scroll Eight.

In Yuan’s era of awakened transformation, the annual custom of Tanzhou required households to contribute funds for the establishment of release-life societies on the third day of the third month, the eighth day of the fourth month, the sixth day of the sixth month, and the eighteenth day of the eighth month. On the third day of the third month in the first year of Kangding, coinciding with the birthday of the Perfected Warrior, living creatures—fowl and aquatic life—were purchased in advance and kept in cages and vessels. On the appointed day at Xiangfu Abbey, they were paraded through the markets and brought to the great river, where hymns were chanted as the creatures, both winged and finned, were set free. Some, once released, plummeted from the sky, while others floated belly-up on the water. The society members, with the help of attendants, retrieved them one by one for inspection. The birds bore wounds—some ensnared in glue nets or withered traps, others struck by arrows or slingshots. The aquatic creatures, caught by hooks, seines, or woven baskets, had their scales, heads, or tails broken and torn. The crowd was filled with sorrow. After the rites concluded, the creatures were dispersed to quiet, secluded outskirts, where they would no longer be seen by the eyes of city-dwellers.

The society members returned to the abbey for the feast, where the presiding Daoist, Zhou Yuanyan, ascended the hall and expounded the *Scripture of True Warrior* once through. During the assembly, a wandering Daoist suddenly arose and addressed Zhou Yuanyan: "Fortunate to address this gathering of the four seas, I humbly request your instruction on the karmic causes of this rite, that all may attain understanding and awakening."

Yuanyan replied: "In Tanzhou, there are four such assemblies each year. Today’s is held in honor of the birthday of the Divine Responsive True Lord of True Warrior. The others are: the eighth day of the fourth month, the birthday of Śākyamuni Buddha; the sixth day of the sixth month, the birthday of the Lord of Destiny of Mount Tai of the Eastern Peak; and the eighteenth day of the eighth month, the festival of the Dragon Lords and Divine Mother of the Four Seas and Nine Rivers, when the aquatic creatures are tallied. On each occasion, birds and fish are purchased alive, released from cages into the water—this is called a *fangsheng* assembly."

The wandering Daoist pressed: "It is not *fangsheng*—it is deliberate killing, deceitful killing, ignorant killing, and greedy killing."

Yuanyan asked: "What do you mean?"

The Daoist answered: "If it were not killing, why do those released today neither fly nor leap? Birds are born in forests and wilds, while fish, turtles, clams, and mussels thrive in rivers and lakes. These creatures of land and water share the same nature as humans. Those destined to die repay their debts in kitchens and cauldrons—such is their fate. But because of these assemblies, countless lives are wrongfully taken. The ignorant, heedless of sin, pursue profit by any means, trapping day and night. Starving and desperate, ten thousand perish for every ten spared, and ten die for every one that lives. Those that survive are all wounded—this is deliberate, deceitful, greedy, and ignorant killing. Year after year, this is nothing but the accumulation of karma. How can it be called *transforming life*? Moreover, True Warrior is the upright and impartial celestial deity of the Northern Culmen, governing the world’s blessings. Would he accept offerings of private slaughter?"

Yuanyan had no reply. He descended from his seat, bowed to detain the Daoist, and sought his name, but the figure had vanished without a trace. Then, before their eyes, the creatures that had failed to flee transformed within their cages and vessels, each emitting a white light that ascended into the sky. The assembly witnessed this and knew it was True Warrior, moved by compassion for living beings, manifesting to teach and admonish them against killing. From that day, Tanzhou abolished the *fangsheng* assemblies and replaced them with almsgiving to the poor. Prefect Chen Xiang memorialized the court, and by imperial decree, the matter was verified and submitted to the authorities. An edict was issued, condemning *fangsheng* as harmful and futile, and printed copies were distributed to officials, abbeys, and monasteries for observance.

**Wang Gun Burns Turtles**
In Suzhou, there was a Vice Director of the Ministry of Justice named Wang Gun, who was appointed magistrate of Wuhu County in Taiping Prefecture. Stubborn and gluttonous, he relished rare delicacies. He would burn live turtles with fire to extract their flesh, then cook it in porcelain vessels. His eldest son, Wang Changxiu, repeatedly pleaded with his mother to admonish his father against this, but Gun remained obstinate.

One day, it happened to be the third day of the third month, when the *fangsheng* society gathered in the county to parade and present paper offerings at Zhaoyuan Abbey. Changxiu went to observe and asked the abbey’s presiding Daoist, Cheng Zijian: "I often see *fangsheng* societies gather at temples on the eighth day of the fourth month. Why do they come to a Daoist abbey on the third day of the third month?"

Zijian replied: "The third day of the third month is the birthday of True Warrior. The devout gather on this day to make proper offerings and release carp, turtles, and freshwater clams—these are the very creatures True Warrior most abhors. Carp belong to the northern *gui* transformation; at night, they face north and bear seven spots on their heads. Turtles resemble divine tortoises, and clams are akin to sacred serpents. Releasing these three creatures signifies a heart free of harm, repenting sins, dispelling calamities, and seeking blessings and protection."

Changxiu returned home and recounted this to his mother, who relayed it to his father. But Gun, ever obstinate, refused to heed their counsel.

Longxiu secretly sought from Daoist Master Cheng a portrait of True Warrior, along with transmitted taboos and prohibitions for his veneration, and returned home to set aside a separate chamber with his mother and wife’s elder brother to make offerings. As the years passed, Wang Gun was promoted to Director of the Bureau of Carriages and appointed to oversee Xingzhou, departing alone for his post.

Nearing the halfway point of his journey, a Daoist appeared before his horse and said: "Are you not Director Wang Gun, bound for Xingzhou? That place is precisely where you will forfeit your life." Before Gun could question further, the Daoist vanished without a trace.

Upon arriving in Xingzhou, Gun longed for turtle and fish in his kitchen. But as Xingzhou did not produce such creatures, he grew furious with his attendants, beating them mercilessly. Soon after, he fell ill, his condition worsening until no medicine could cure him. One night, he cried out in agony, claiming countless shelled water spirits, bearing grievances, had surrounded him to demand his life. His throat burned, his breath grew ragged, his limbs ached, and he could neither sit nor lie down, with no escape between life and death.

In his anguish, he suddenly felt something bite the fingers of his right hand, the pain unbearable. He cried out "True Warrior, Perfected Lord!" and felt his choked breath ease, his chest clear, and his breathing slowly return. After a long while, his qi settled, and he said: "Gun’s nature has always been stubborn and unyielding. From childhood, I relished the taste of roasted turtle meat, ignoring my wife’s elder brother’s warnings and failing to honor True Warrior. Later, I received this appointment, and midway, a Daoist told me my destination was where I would lose my life. Foolish and obstinate, I did not heed the warning and now suffer this torment. In my delirium, I called out repeatedly to the Perfected Lord for salvation."

Suddenly, he found himself on a mountain, standing before True Warrior. Rows of wronged creatures—those he had roasted and eaten—lined up, bearing grievances and demanding his life. True Warrior pointed at Gun and said: "You recklessly took lives to satisfy your appetite. Your accusers, the karmic ghosts, will never release you. The Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water have investigated and found you guilty, reducing your lifespan by twenty years. You were fated to die in Xingzhou. However, your wife and children have practiced austerities, maintained devotion, and made offerings to me. Morning and night, they have vowed repentance, all for your sake—because of the lives you took and consumed. I have petitioned the Three Officials on your behalf, allowing your accusers to be reborn in the water realm, freeing you from their claims. I have also memorialized to restore your lifespan as before."

The moment True Warrior granted this revelation, Gun’s suffering vanished. He later reported these events to the court and requested retirement. He vowed to abstain from killing, to uphold the香火, to recite the *Wondrous Sutra of True Warrior* one hundred thousand times, and to copy and donate the Daoist Canon to the Taiqing Yanfu Abbey in the Eastern Capital.

**Hua’s Slaughter of Fish**

Cheng Sichang of Xinghua Prefecture began as a merchant in his youth. Proud and hot-tempered, he scorned the "Two Treasures" (the pestle and mortar, symbolizing labor) and distanced himself from his hometown friends, earning their disdain. In his business dealings, he never cheated on weights or measures, nor did he shortchange others. He paid no mind to bargaining or assessing goods, nor did he delight in fine cooking, and he rarely ate living creatures.

Once, while staying in the western outskirts of Banqiao in Mizhou, he noticed that the locals consumed vast numbers of pigeons, turtledoves, magpies, and other birds daily, slaughtered in the streets. During a walk in the countryside, he saw people carrying hawks, wielding bows and slingshots, or setting nets—sights he could not bear to witness. Returning to the city, on a quiet night under the stars, he resolved to adopt a vegetarian diet. He commissioned artisans to carve woodblocks and printed a thousand copies of the *Illustrated Precepts Against Killing*, distributing them widely.

On the seventh day of the tenth month, True Warrior descended, and through his sacred power, he inspired a universal change of heart. A tax collector named Peng Jing, known for his love of meat and wine, received a copy. Upon returning home, he read it to his wife, Hua Sanniang, who grew furious, tore the booklet apart, and cast it into filth.

The next day, Hua bought a black fish. As she raised the cleaver, her hands were suddenly restrained as if held by an unseen force. The fish leapt up, its tail stabbing her eye like a blade. Blood dripped onto the ground, transforming into ants that swarmed up the table and bit her face. The incident spread through the market, and all knew it was retribution for her disrespect of the *Illustrated Precepts Against Killing*.

One day, Peng Jing, drunk, encountered Sichang in the marketplace and hurled abuse at him: "Banqiao has always lived in peace without your meddling. You, an outsider from Xinghua, spread these texts and ruined my wife’s eye!" He lunged at Sichang, intending to cause a scene. Sichang fled and, upon returning to his room, reflected on his remorse.

At that time, the garrison commander Xiang Shu and the patrol inspector Xuan Dan were gathered in the hall when they saw Sichang’s feet hovering three inches above the ground as he floated through the air. He stood before the hall, speaking in a possessed voice: *"I am the Perfected Warrior Lord. Xiang Shu and the others swiftly prepared incense and prostrated themselves, whereupon they received this revelation: ‘I see that the people of this land have for kalpas delighted in consuming winged creatures, their karmic obstructions profound. There is one, Cheng Sichang of Xinghua, who prints and distributes the* Illustrated Precepts Against Killing—*this is the highest good deed. Yet Hua Sanniang refused to believe and accept it; for killing a black fish, she instead harmed her own eye. Not only she but all who take life without awakening to their karmic bonds shall not escape calamity.’*

Sichang then vanished in a daze, his form and shadow gone. As they were investigating the matter, a report suddenly arrived from the town: the traveler Cheng Sichang had died without illness. The garrison commander and others heard this and sighed in astonishment. Hua Sanniang’s eye affliction lingered for half a year before she finally perished. Xiang Shu and Xuan Dan, upon returning to the capital after their terms ended, had the account of these events carved onto printing blocks and distributed to exhort people against killing. For the rest of their lives, they revered the incense offerings to the Perfected Warrior, ensuring the tale reached the sagely ears of the emperor. By imperial decree, the matter was entrusted to the relevant authorities, and it was recorded in *The Miraculous Efficacy of the Perfected Warrior*:

*Three Origins, one divine spirit,*
*Responsive through ten gates.*
*Majestic, radiant, and auspicious,*
*All true, all banishing harm.*

**The Śarīra of the Zhu Clan**

In Yuanzhou, there was a palace attendant of the left guard, Zhu Lianggong, who served as a tax supervisor in Junzhou. After a year in office, he died, leaving behind a poor household with no sons—only a daughter who, with her mother, escorted his coffin home. Before a year had passed, the mother also died. The family had long worshipped the Perfected Warrior, and the daughter, Zhu, paid no heed when neighbors sought matches for her. The neighbors, however, slandered her with accusations of impropriety. Zhu then swore before the Perfected Warrior that she would never marry, vowing to suffer a disability to sever all external pursuits. At forty, she suddenly went blind in both eyes and refused to seek medical treatment, after which no one proposed marriage. She died on the ninth day of the ninth month in the sixth year of Tiansheng.

With no surviving kin, the authorities were obliged to inspect the body. In Yuanzhou, Judicial Officer Zhao Ping was assigned to verify the case. When they attempted to examine Zhu’s corpse, it was shielded from view—before it lay a black tortoise, and behind it coiled a crimson serpent, both guarding her remains. Prefect He Jue and Vice-Prefect Wang Yaochen, who witnessed this marvel in person, summoned Buddhist monks and Daoist priests to pray and beseech the creatures to withdraw, so that the body might be properly encoffined. The tortoise and serpent vanished at once. The officials then ordered the neighbors to purchase a coffin and prepare her for burial.

Upon questioning the servant girl Chen Juxiang, they learned that Zhu had been pressured by suitors and, when she refused, slandered with accusations of impropriety. This had driven her to swear before the Perfected Warrior that she would never marry, vowing to bear a disability to sever all worldly ties. Daily she had prayed, and the Perfected Warrior had descended in spirit to watch over her. After losing her sight, she soon died without illness, her flesh and complexion unchanged from life. At her final hour, she had only said, “Cremate my body in the north, toward the *ren-gui* direction.”

Prefect He, upon careful consideration, noted that the ninth day of the ninth month was precisely the day the Perfected Warrior descended. Zhu’s sudden death, the tortoise and serpent guarding her, and her request for cremation in the *ren-gui* direction—all were to be obeyed. As soon as the fire was lit, her form ascended into the clouds, where she addressed the crowd: “I shall not enter the Six Paths but will be reborn in the household of Liu Ji in Yizhou. Before twenty years have passed, remember: there will be a Liu son whose name will spread across the land. If anyone still slanders me as unchaste, let them burn my remains in fire—only then will the truth be known.” With that, she departed.

After the fire had consumed her bones, five-colored, indestructible *śarīra* relics appeared, radiant with light. The crowd all sought to receive and venerate them. Those who had previously spread slander and defamation now suffered from mouth ulcers, hemorrhoids, and festering sores, their bodies reeking with pus and filth. Each came to the Perfected Warrior’s hall to repent and confess their sins, gradually finding relief and healing. Households in Yuanzhou warned one another against careless speech and false accusations, and they took up the practice of burning incense before the Perfected Warrior. The prefect memorialized the court, which in turn decreed an investigation in Yizhou. It was confirmed that on the ninth day of the ninth month at the hour of *chou*, the wife of Liu Ji, *yuanwailang* of the Bureau of Military Fields, had indeed given birth to a son—no falsehood was found. Following the imperial secretariat’s directive, the prefecture allocated official funds to hold a grand *jiao* ritual at the Perfected Warrior’s hall in Tianqing Abbey. A temporary shrine was also erected at the original site of her cremation in the north, to be preserved for future verification and further action.

**Lord Liang’s Hairpin**

In Cizhou, there was a female Daoist priest of the Qingquan Abbey, which stood within the city walls. Her precepts were pure, and her cultivation sincere. The people of Cizhou held her in deep reverence, and her abbey maintained ties with Tianqing Abbey. Whenever the people of Cizhou held *jiao* feasts, scripture recitations, or other ritual affairs, they would invite the female priests of Qingquan Abbey. However, the Daoist priests of Tianqing Abbey grew envious. They bribed a gang of ruffians to blockade the abbey gates daily, disrupting and harassing anyone who came to request their services, while also spreading slanderous rumors. As a result, fewer and fewer people came to invite them.

Among the female priests was Liang Jizhen, aged seventeen, who had received the Register of the Northern Dipper and maintained a devout practice that yielded spiritual responses. Day and night, she burned incense before the image of the Perfected Warrior, weeping as she pleaded for swift karmic retribution.

Soon after, Huang Mian, newly appointed *yuanwailang* of the Ministry of Justice and magistrate of Cizhou, was traveling to assume his post. As he neared the city, he spent the night at the post station in Pingyuan Town. In a dream, he saw a man clad in a purple robe with a golden belt, who declared, “I am the Record-Keeper of the Northern Dipper Hall at Qingquan Abbey. I have observed that the officials assisting the magistrate of Cizhou are inexperienced and only seek to deceive and distort. For instance, the female priests of Qingquan Abbey are being slandered and obstructed by the Daoist priests of Tianqing Abbey, cutting them off from their patrons. When you take office, you must rectify this injustice.”

Huang Mian awoke with a start and recorded the dream. Over two months into his tenure, he happened to pass by Qingquan Abbey and entered the Northern Dipper Hall. There, he recognized the face of the purple-robed official as the man from his dream. Returning to his yamen, he ordered the military patrol to investigate the matter involving Qingquan Abbey, setting a deadline of half a month to produce a report.

As the deadline approached, a group of over sixty villagers, following their annual custom, came to Qingquan Abbey to hold a *jiao* ritual for safeguarding fields and silkworms. That night, a mob of vagabonds gathered, driving the villagers away. The military patrol apprehended fourteen of them, including Zhuang Huasan and others, and brought them in for interrogation. After summoning twenty-six Daoist priests from Tianqing Abbey, including Chen Youzhang, for questioning, the prefectural authorities meted out appropriate punishments. The ringleaders, Chen Youzhang and Zhuang Huasan, were to be exiled pending imperial review.

That night, Huang Mian dreamed again of the Record-Keeper, who told him, “Tianqing Abbey also venerates the incense of the Four Saints of the Northern Dipper. If Youzhang is exiled, it will bring disgrace upon our teaching. There is no need to memorialize the court.” Huang Mian then ordered the case closed, releasing Chen Youzhang, while Zhuang Huasan was exiled to another prefecture.

Not long after, Liang Jizhen fell ill with festering sores and died, her body reeking of decay. She was buried in an official plot outside the eastern gate. Half a year later, as Vice-Magistrate Su Yingzhi left the city to inspect saltworks, he was assailed by a foul stench. The locals informed him that Liang Jizhen of Qingquan Abbey was buried there. Su Yingzhi immediately summoned the abbess of Qingquan Abbey, Yao Jichong, and others to relocate the remains to a secluded spot. When they opened the grave, they found the coffin lid floating above the ground, with no body inside—only a hairpin and a red serpent and green turtle. The stench had transformed into an extraordinary fragrance. Su Yingzhi burned incense and bowed in reverence, then took the serpent and turtle to present to Huang Mian.

Upon investigation, it was revealed that during her life, Liang had reverently cultivated the incense of the Perfected Warrior, thus attaining the Dao of *shijie* and manifesting the wondrous signs of the serpent and turtle. It was deemed fitting to enshrine them in the Perfected Warrior’s hall at Qingquan Abbey. However, three times they were placed inside the hall, and three times they coiled their way back out, their mouths agape as if threatening harm. Huang Mian then burned incense and prayed, asking if they required additional incense offerings or a separate hall, to be established upon memorializing the court. The serpent and turtle then circled back into the hall, and with a gust of wind, they vanished.

The prefecture submitted a memorial, and the court subsequently issued a decree ordering the local officials to allocate funds from the tribute tax to construct a proper hall for the Perfected Warrior. A shrine was also built for Liang Jizhen, who was posthumously honored as the Perfected Master of Wondrous Transformation. Thereafter, the abbey flourished, and its teachings spread widely, as heaven and earth bore witness.

In the Guangnan Binzhou government offices, a malevolent spirit of a hidden corpse had long lingered, causing successive officials to refuse their appointments—either falling ill themselves or seeing their children die. During the Yongxi era, the Assistant Director of Ceremonial Affairs, Yang Congxin, had devoted his life to the Dao, inscribing talismans and registers to heal the sick and plague-stricken. He diligently tended the incense offerings to the Four Saints of the Northern Dipper, and each act bore spiritual response.

Just three days after assuming his post, his subordinates approached him, asking whether he would take his meals and lodging at Yanfu Monastery, for the prefectural offices were often inauspicious, and they feared some nocturnal disturbance might alarm his attendants. Confident in the protection of the Perfected Spirits, Yang instead chose to reside in the prefectural offices. He prepared fresh fruits, tea, wine, and pure water, and set up his personal icon of the Perfected Warrior for veneration.

When night fell, between the hours of *xu* and *hai*, he took a bolt of yellow silk twelve feet in length and, with cinnabar, inscribed upon it the *Talisman of the Six Ding Spirit Generals for Summoning the Soul*. He presented this before the Perfected Warrior in prayer. Once the rites were complete, he burned the talisman along with paper money as offerings. For seven days and nights, the prefectural offices remained undisturbed, and no one experienced fear or alarm.

By the tenth day, Yang still received no response. He earnestly beseeched the Perfected Warrior once more, praying for swift retribution. That night, at the second watch, he heard the windows and walls tremble as though buffeted by wind and rain. The lamps and candles all snuffed out, and flashes of lightning flickered before the scene finally stilled.

At the fifth watch, two *ke* past midnight, Yang heard someone knocking at his chamber door. He rose and peered cautiously, only to find the lamp before the Perfected Warrior’s icon burning as before. Before the altar stood a gaunt, disheveled woman, who rapped at the window and cried: *"Have pity on your sister—I am the daughter of Minister Zhang Chen of the Zhou dynasty, betrothed to Prefect Yao Wenji of Binzhou. This man favored his concubine, Fan Xiangchun, and together they strangled me with a silk sash, then buried my body beneath the floor of this very chamber. Soon after, Yao Wenji and his accomplices were sent to oversee repairs at Tong Pass. For their misdeeds, they were trampled to pieces by a herd of horses on the mountainside, their bones scattered beyond recovery. My soul has languished here, bound to my corpse, unable to escape. But now, thanks to your prayers to the Perfected Warrior, the Six Ding Spirit Generals, along with the City God and Earth Deity, have seized me and dragged me to Fengpiluo Mountain, where I am condemned to wander as a lowly ghost. I have come to plead my grievance, and through the Perfected Warrior’s compassion, I have been granted a prediction of rebirth among gods and men. Yet my remains still lie beneath the southern wall of this chamber, buried six feet deep. If they are exhumed, I may finally attain liberation. I beg you—be my advocate!"*

At daybreak, Yang ordered men to dig with shovels. Sure enough, they unearthed a complete skeleton, which they placed in a wooden coffin and interred at Yanfu Monastery. From that day forth, the prefectural offices knew peace.

Yang thereafter exhorted the people, urging them to reverently tend the incense fires of the Perfected Spirits to seek their protective blessings. He declared: *"Good and evil have no fixed gate—they are summoned by one’s own deeds. If one acts with impartiality and without deceit, Heaven and Earth bear witness. How then could demons dare to bring harm? For those who aspire to the Great Dao and honor Heaven and Earth, divine guardians attend their every step. What fear is there of malevolent spirits? Through devotion to the Perfected Warrior, one attains the true Dao, forever subduing all demons, welcoming auspicious omens, and ensuring peace within the household."*

The people of Binzhou all heeded his words with utmost reverence. Later, when Yang returned to the capital, he was appointed Inspector of the Imperial City and concurrently served as Commissioner of the Treasury. Once, while accompanying the emperor in sacrifices to the household deities, he presented this account. By imperial decree, the matter was referred to the relevant authorities for investigation. As Binzhou had no Daoist abbeys, the emperor ordered the Bureau of Transport to assess the site and, within five years, construct two abbeys, selecting Daoist priests to conduct rituals while the state provided funds for their upkeep. The abbeys were bestowed the names *Fusheng* and *Qianxi*, in honor of the divine favor thus acknowledged.

In the capital’s Xiangan County, there lived the Vice Minister of Revenue, Pei Zongmin, who had three sons: Yanxian, Yanxiu, and Yanhe, all of whom had received official rank through their father’s influence. Yanxian was cautious and reverent, diligently upholding the Daoist teachings, while Yanxiu and Yanhe were deceitful and crooked, showing no regard for Heaven and Earth. When the time came for them to register for official appointments and sit for the imperial examinations, only Yanxian visited the Zhenwu Hall of Chongfu Abbey, where he burned incense and prayed, beseeching protection for his brothers so that all might succeed in the examinations. He drew the fourth divination slip of the Yellow Perfected Lord, and upon interpreting its meaning, found it foretold misfortune and sorrow among brothers. He thus warned his brothers to conduct themselves with care, but Yanxiu and Yanhe instead reproached him, saying, “Why should we place our trust in clay statues and painted images?”

Later, when they sat for the examinations, Yanxiu and Yanhe failed, while Yanxian alone passed and was appointed Evaluator of the Supreme Court, serving as Assistant Magistrate of Mingzhou. Yanxiu was assigned to Binzhou and later promoted to the post of County Constable in Jiang County, while Yanhe was appointed Supervisor of Wine in Jinzhou. From then on, Yanxiu and Yanhe grew envious. Seeing their brother attain high rank, they railed against Heaven and Earth for their lack of impartiality, complaining that the examiners had not judged their abilities fairly, their hearts filled with resentment.

After Yanxian departed for his post in Mingzhou, not only did he cease his devotions, but when his two brothers set out for their own appointments, they took the family altar’s icons of the Three Pure Ones and the stellar deities and burned them before leaving. Yanxiu, upon arriving in Jiang County as Constable, had been in office for only two months when, while patrolling to suppress the pirate Meng Junsan and his band, he was captured. They spared his life but cut out the tip of his tongue before releasing him. Yanhe, upon taking up his post as Supervisor of Wine in Jinzhou, after two years was found to have embezzled four-tenths of the tax revenue. When the Surveillance Commission impeached him, an official was dispatched to investigate, but Yanhe feigned illness and death.

Yanxian, in Mingzhou, submitted a memorial to the throne, offering to resign his post and forfeit his salary to atone for his brothers’ transgressions. The court replied that he should await further instructions upon completing his term. Yanxian conducted himself with integrity, earning the praise of officials and commoners alike, and was unanimously recommended for promotion by the local authorities. Later, the Secretariat issued an order that upon Yanxian’s return to the capital after his term ended, he was to be presented to the emperor for an audience, though the imperial intention remained unclear.

When Yanxian was received at court, the emperor inquired about his background and whether he had any esoteric learning. Yanxian replied, “My ancestors have always revered the gods and the heavens, maintaining unbroken incense offerings, but I possess no esoteric learning.” The emperor then said, “Last year, on the ninth day of the ninth month, I dreamed that the Perfected Lord of Domestic Felicity from the Hall of Household Governance appeared to assist me, commending your name. He said you had rendered service to the state and always upheld loyalty and filial piety. He also mentioned that though your two brothers held official rank, they were men who would bring ruin to the state and their family. They were unworthy of their celestial appointments, and it was decreed that their names be stricken from the registers, cutting short their lives and emoluments. This was to demonstrate that Yanxian’s conduct aligned with the Dao, answering to the divine above and earning the unanimous recommendation of court officials below. As for Yanxiu and Yanhe, their recent misdeeds have provoked the gods to send down calamity. Whether one does good or evil, retribution is always manifest, serving as both warning and admonition.”

Yanxian was then promoted to Gentleman of the Palace and granted an imperial robe before being appointed Magistrate of Yuzhang County in Hongzhou.

**The Divine Well Discerns the Strange**

In Huaizhou, there were two brothers, Xie Jingyuan and Xie Jingxiu, who ran a tallow shop in Kaisheng. The elder brother was fond of gambling and dissipation, while the younger revered the family’s ancestral altar to Zhenwu. In all matters, he prayed for divine aid, and his prayers were never unanswered. Jingyuan, however, was addicted to drink and gambling, and his household gradually fell into ruin. Recalling his brother’s claims of the altar’s efficacy, he entreated Zhenwu, saying, “If I am to gamble with others and win their money, I must receive a favorable omen.” After several such invocations, he won one or two hundred strings of cash. Later, he sought another sign and departed with an auspicious omen, only to lose over a hundred thousand coins. Enraged, he returned home and tore down the entire Zhenwu Hall. Jingxiu later restored it.

As Jingyuan continued to lose at gambling, suffering one misfortune after another, his resentment grew. One day, while Jingxiu was in the capital on business, his brother destroyed the sacred hall, hacking the statue of Zhenwu to pieces with a knife and casting the fragments into a well. Three days later, Jingyuan suddenly broke out in sores and scabs, his body oozing pus and blood, leaving him neither dead nor alive. Meanwhile, in the capital, Jingxiu dreamed of a barefoot boy with disheveled hair, his entire body yellow, wearing a stone tray on his head. The boy wept and cried out, “My limbs are wounded, the pain unbearable!” Upon closer inspection, Jingxiu saw that the boy was made of several broken pieces of blackened wood. Startled awake, he realized that the family’s Zhenwu altar must have been desecrated.

Upon returning to Huaizhou, Jingxiu saw that the family hall had indeed been destroyed, and his brother lay gravely ill with festering sores. He hired craftsmen to rebuild the hall and retrieved the wooden fragments of Zhenwu from the well, piecing them back together into a whole. Unexpectedly, the water drawn from this well was amber in hue, exuding an extraordinary fragrance unlike any other, and word of its wonder spread throughout the prefecture.

At the time, Magistrate Ma Xun of the Historiography Bureau heard of this marvel. That very day, he led his officials to Jingxiu’s home, where they had the water drawn and examined its unusual scent. After hearing the full account of Jingyuan’s karmic retribution and his affliction with foul sores, Ma Xun ordered a cup of the well water to be drawn for Jingxiu to drink. As soon as he finished, clouds and mist gathered on all sides. Jingxiu was seen standing in midair, enveloped in auspicious clouds, with cranes leading the way. He bowed in gratitude to Ma Xun and bid farewell to the crowd, declaring, “Today I behold the Golden Gates and ascend in broad daylight.”

Ma Xun submitted a detailed memorial, and by imperial decree, Huaizhou was ordered to construct an official residence to exchange for Jingxiu’s property, including the well and its foundation. The funds saved were used to build a temple in honor of Jingxiu’s ascension, named the *Temple of the Ascended Perfected One*, complete with halls to enshrine the sacred well. Drawing water was henceforth forbidden, except for healing the sick when requested by the people. The temple was granted the imperial plaque *Temple of the Sacred Well*, and annual allocations of imperial grace were bestowed for its upkeep.

Two novice Daoist acolytes were assigned to tend the temple, and imperial grants of farmland, housing, and funds were bestowed to serve as its permanent endowment. Jingxiu’s sole surviving elder brother and sister-in-law were entrusted to Jing Yuan for lifelong care. Thereafter, the family prospered, with one son passing the imperial examinations—later generations would witness even more extraordinary events.

**The Retribution of Jiao Lake**

Among the people of Chaozhou in Huaixi, regardless of wealth or poverty, all indulged in devouring giant turtles, heedless of the foul stench, thereby offending the celestial courts. The sun and moon grew dim, and the stars lost their luster. The Nine Heavens’ Investigative Envoys conducted their inspection and submitted a memorial, moving the Jade Emperor to command the North Polar Purple Tenuity Emperor, along with the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water and the Sacred Mountain Deities, to interrogate the people of Chaozhou regarding their accumulated sins and the retribution they were to receive.

The North Polar Emperor memorialized: “This land has long indulged in wanton slaughter, and the wronged spirits of aquatic creatures cling to their grievances. Since repayment is due, the entire region must be eradicated to resolve their grievances.”

The Jade Emperor declared to the North Polar Emperor: “The evil amassed by these beings is truly intolerable. Only by submerging the entire city and transforming it into a vast lake can purity be restored.”

Thereupon, the North Emperor issued a decree to Zhenwu: “As the roving inspector of the Three Realms, recording the good and evil of mortals and determining their blessings or punishments, you must be aware that the people of Chaozhou, for kalpas uncounted, have delighted in slaughtering dragons and giant turtles, thereby offending the Jade Emperor’s sacred excursions. Their crimes are unforgivable. Command this entire prefecture to be drowned and turned into a watery expanse. You shall carry this out with all haste.”

Zhenwu memorialized the North Emperor: “Though the people of Chaozhou bear grave sins, not all have partaken in the slaughter of aquatic life. If the land is summarily submerged, many innocent souls will suffer unjustly. Allow me to investigate and proceed in due order.”

Zhenwu then dispatched his celestial officers and divine generals, who transformed into a colossal turtle and floated upon the waters of Chao Creek, blocking the city’s bridges and markets. The prefectural magistrate sent officials to butcher the beast, distributing its meat to the local administrators. Soon after, the people of Chaozhou all partook of the flesh.

The Celestial Stalwarts reported back to Zhenwu: “The very earth of Chaozhou is fated to be transformed into a vast lake.” Even as the people were turned into great fish, their corpses floated in the shallows, yet none rejected the foulness—all devoured the flesh without discrimination.

Zhenwu sighed: “The sins of these beings run too deep; they cannot be saved.” He then transformed into a wandering Daoist priest and descended to Chaozhou, seeking pure water for alms. For seven days, he traversed the city, but every household’s bowls and vessels reeked of filth, leaving not a single clean place. At last, in a narrow alley, he came upon an old woman and once more begged for water. The crone filled a bowl and offered it to him.

He then asked the crone her surname and livelihood. The woman replied: “My surname is Jiao. Originally from the land of Wu, I have lived here for over twenty years, making my living by selling rice-flour foods. My household consists of a son, his wife, and myself—three in all.”

The Daoist priest inquired: “Why is the water in your bowl not foul?” The crone answered: “Since arriving in Chaozhou, I have witnessed the people’s cruelty and this land’s malevolence—every household slaughters aquatic creatures, heedless of sin or blessing. I have forbidden killing and partaken only of vegetarian fare, so my water and bowl remain pure.”

The Daoist declared: “I am no ordinary man, but a celestial deity. Moved by your virtuous deeds, I have come to deliver you. Soon, Chaozhou will be engulfed by a great flood. Take your son and flee at once. As you have not yet reaped the fruits of your actions, I grant you one of three boons: first, that your descendants may hold office and enjoy stipends; second, that you may instantly attain wealth and glory; third, that you may forever receive offerings and reverence. Choose as you will.”

The crone bowed and said: “How dare I seek excessive wealth or rank? If only the incense at my hearth may burn without end, that alone is my wish.”

The Perfected Lord replied: “From this day forward, go each morning and evening to the side of the prefectural yamen and observe the stone tortoise beneath the stele. When you see both its eyes turn red, take your son and daughter-in-law and flee through the southern gate. When you reach Mount Sacred Maiden, stop there.” With these words, the Perfected Lord transformed into a beam of white light and vanished.

From then on, Madam Jiao went daily to the prefectural yamen to inspect the stone tortoise’s eyes. After nearly a month, people began to call her mad, and in jest, some daubed the tortoise’s eyes with red pigment. Seeing the eyes crimson, Madam Jiao gathered her son and daughter-in-law and rushed out the southern gate. After ten *li*, they came to a mountain called Sacred Maiden. Ascending the slope, she turned to look back—Chaozhou was already swallowed by surging floodwaters, vast and boundless.

Suddenly, amidst the clouds, she beheld a divine figure—hair unbound, feet bare, clad in a dusky robe—his form identical to the Daoist who had begged for water. He called out: “Madam Jiao, these waters shall be under your care, that the incense smoke may never cease.” With these parting words, he vanished from sight.

Madam Jiao then bade her son gather thatch to build a shelter, and she forgot all about sleep and food.

During the Jin dynasty, upon hearing of the inundation of Chaozhou, officials were dispatched to investigate, but none in the surrounding regions could ascertain the cause. Gazing toward Sacred Maiden Mountain, they saw but a single household. The officials ascended the slope and came before Madam Jiao, inquiring into the matter, which they then reported in full. First, they provided Madam Jiao with provisions for sustenance, ordering neighboring prefectures to deliver supplies without delay. Before long, Madam Jiao, along with her son and daughter-in-law, passed away in succession.

The imperial court erected a temple in her honor, bestowing upon her the title *Lingxian Shengmu* ("Numinous and Manifest Holy Mother"), and decreed that the waters henceforth bear her surname, calling them Jiaohu ("Jiao Lake"). With waterways now traversed by boats and barges, offerings and prayers to her have never ceased, and none have failed to receive her efficacious response. Today, the lake falls under the jurisdiction of Wuwei Commandery in Huaixi Circuit, Chao County, its waters connecting the transport routes of Lu, Shou, Shu, and He prefectures.

Upon careful examination, the retribution for good and evil is starkly evident. Chaozhou, once spanning over two hundred *li* in circumference, was engulfed by the floodwaters, its former name *Chaoyuan* now replaced by *Jiaohu*, with only Sacred Maiden Mountain remaining at its center. Madam Jiao was specially enfeoffed as *Lingxian Shengmu*. Later, when winds and waves arose, capsizing boats and drowning travelers, officials and common folk could only beseech the Holy Mother’s grace, yet the storms grew ever more fierce.

An elderly female physician in Xijin City submitted a memorial, claiming to be a descendant of Jiaohu’s original settlers. Witnessing the lake’s winds and waves claim lives and vessels, she lamented that the authorities sought only the Holy Mother’s intercession, unaware that the Holy Mother herself had once been an ordinary mortal. Having observed the precepts, abstained from killing, and eaten only vegetables, she encountered Zhenwu, to whom she offered pure water, and was thus elevated as the local earth deity of Chaozhou’s waters. Though the state renamed the lake *Jiaohu* and honored her as *Lingxian Shengmu*, bestowing upon her the grace of Heaven and Earth, she had yet to repay this debt—how then could she stir up winds and waves to harm others? The truth was that the drowned souls of Chaozhou’s former inhabitants, along with the vengeful spirits of aquatic creatures, remained bound in unresolved grievance, perpetuating their enmity. Thus, they conjured malevolent winds and vicious waves, capsizing boats and exacting retribution in turn. To quell this, only Zhenwu could intervene.

As she finished speaking, she vanished from sight.

Upon reviewing the petition submitted during the Jin dynasty, it was revealed that the elderly woman was none other than the local earth deity of Jiaohu, the incarnate form of Lingxian Shengmu. The court was urged to act swiftly: dispatch envoys and Daoist priests to the Lingxian Temple to establish a ritual altar, offer imperial incense, and implore Zhenwu to beseech the cessation of winds and waves, ensuring safe passage for all. After a month-long ritual, the storms on Jiaohu abruptly subsided. As the envoys prepared to depart, a talismanic messenger suddenly appeared amidst the clouds and mist, declaring: *"I am the Direct Talisman Officer of the Middle Realm, sent by General Zhenwu to report to the court. The waves of Jiaohu arose from the unresolved vengeance of Chaozhou’s slain inhabitants and the grievances of the aquatic creatures, their enmity unbroken, thus spawning calamity. Now that the court has prayed for peace, Zhenwu has petitioned the North Pole Star Lord, and through the audience with the Three Clarities, the Jade Emperor has issued his decree. Auspicious sweet dew has descended, dissolving the knots of the vengeful spirits and aquatic beings of Jiaohu. They have been sent to the Eastern Peak’s Tai Mountain Prefecture and the underworld’s nether bureaus, where their names are recorded, their deeds weighed, and their debts repaid before rebirth. Jiaohu is now at peace."* The talismanic messenger then withdrew.

The Jin court once more dispatched envoys to offer incense and conduct rituals on Sacred Maiden Mountain, giving thanks to Heaven and Earth. There, they erected a Zhenwu Hall, bestowing upon it an imperial plaque, and further honored Lingxian with the title *Shunsheng* ("Obedient and Sagely"). *Vain wealth turned to gravel...*

At the Mingyang Palace in Shaozhou, there lay a grotto heaven known as the Azure Net Blessed Land, where the immortal Zhang Yue once cultivated the Dao. Each year on the fifth day of the fifth month at noon, multicolored birds would gather before the grotto, dancing and clamoring in flight—people claimed they were avian attendants accompanying the phoenix’s arrival. Thus, a "Scattered Birds Vegetarian Feast" was held, where offerings of money and paper horses were prepared in this name to repent before the stellar deities of the heavens. The burned paper offerings accumulated in the celestial treasury, unclaimed and unrecorded, until the North Pole Purple Tenuity Great Emperor questioned the Four Sacred Generals before his hall.

Zhenwu stepped forward and reported: *"These are not offerings the celestial treasury should accept. They are fraudulent claims from the Mingyang Palace in Shaozhou, who falsely assert the arrival of phoenixes to deceive the celestial court."* The Emperor then asked: *"If the Mingyang Palace’s offerings on the fifth day of the fifth month are false, why do the birds gather there on that day?"* Zhenwu replied: *"At noon on that day, I descend to that place, and the birds flock to receive my qi of the Dao, dissolving their karmic burdens of past lives in feathered form. Thus, they dance and cry out in joy before departing."*

The Emperor inquired: *"What use does the celestial treasury have for these unclaimed paper horses?"* Zhenwu proposed: *"A decree may be issued to the Eastern Peak, where they can be stored for future use. By next year, no one will burn such offerings."* The following year, the Mingyang Palace held the feast again, and people from afar gathered before the grotto. Yet as the hours passed beyond *shen* and *you*, not a single wing stirred.

Suddenly, a Daoist with unbound hair stood motionless, pointing at the palace gate. When summoned, he declared: *"This year, the birds will not gather for the assembly—it shall be abolished forever."* He further instructed the previous matters be heeded: the palace should, on the fifth day of the fifth month at noon, burn incense before the grotto and pray to the Perfected Lord Zhenwu to dissolve the accumulated sins of past years—vain offerings, wasted wealth, and the offense of deceiving the celestial treasury. *"If you doubt this,"* he said, *"wait three years for retribution."* The Daoist then rose and entered the Azure Nether Grotto, never to emerge from the palace gates.

The following year, the assembly was held again, yet no birds arrived. By the third year, as paper offerings were being burned, a fierce wind whipped the flames into a blaze that spread from the storehouse, consuming the palace in roughly two hours, reducing the halls to rubble. The prefecture recorded the case, and Abbot Daoist Zhang Anxiang was interrogated. He confessed to defying the imperial decree, bringing divine fire upon the palace. The matter was reported for judgment.

By imperial edict, on the fifth day of the fifth month at dawn court, the Bureau of Astronomy reported observing celestial fire destined to burn the heretical palace in Shaozhou. Meanwhile, the eunuch Ling Zhaoqing, possessed by a spirit, declared: *"Zhenwu has also decreed the burning of Mingyang Palace for leading the people astray, squandering wealth on useless offerings, and repeatedly offending the celestial treasury despite warnings. The retribution now comes to pass."*

Thus, Mingyang Palace was stripped of its name. Only a Zhenwu Hall and a small Daoist abbey were rebuilt, with ten ordained Daoists selected for cultivation. Zhang Anxiang was spared punishment but defrocked and released. A proclamation was issued to all Daoist and lay communities across the land, commanding them to revere Heaven and Earth and never stray from the true and upright Dao.

---

In the Kaiyuan Abbey of Nan’an Prefecture, originally the ancestral estate of the Celestial Lord of the Supreme Non-Ultimate Pure Void, the local people venerated Zhenwu above all. Whenever he descended, they flocked to burn incense, paper money, and candles in offering. Before the abbey stood a general goods shop where the abbey purchased supplies for its assemblies, particularly candles. The shop sold foul-smelling tallow and dyed rags disguised as pure beeswax candles, polluting the sacred rites and defiling the prayers for blessings.

The stellar deities and mountain spirits reported this to the Three Pure Ones, the Jade Emperor, and the Celestial August, prompting the Northern Dipper to order the celestial bureaus to investigate. One day, a novice tending the incense in Zhenwu Hall dreamed of a divine messenger who said: *"The candle-seller before the abbey has committed evil for three lifetimes. Now named Huang Yu, he still sells filthy tallow as fake candles, offending the celestial treasury. His sins are boundless; he shall lose the Six Paths and be reduced to dust. As Zhenwu of the Protector Saint Abbey oversees good and evil, I have received the celestial mandate to punish Huang Yu. Tomorrow, he will know his fate."*

The novice awoke in alarm and told the Daoist community. Before he finished speaking, an old man appeared at Huang Yu’s shop, asking to buy ten candles to offer to the celestial treasury, insisting they be genuine. Huang Yu grew furious: *"I’ve sold these candles for over twenty years, all offered to the celestial treasury. Why do you call them fake?"* He demanded the old man buy one first and test it with fire. Suddenly, a gust of wind fanned the flame, igniting the house. The old man vanished. Huang Yu, desperate to save his goods, was trapped by the fire and burned to ashes. Within an hour, only his shop was consumed, leaving not a single coin. When the fire died, a pillar in the shop remained untouched, its surface split as if by an axe, revealing hidden celestial script.

Scholars and Daoists gathered to examine it, recognizing the hand of the Perfected Lord Zhenwu. Officials had the script copied, but as soon as the transcription was complete, fire erupted from within the pillar and consumed it. The event mirrored the novice’s dream, exposing Huang Yu’s sins and hastening his karmic retribution.

The prefect of Nan’an, unwilling to conceal the matter, recorded the incident and submitted two memorials to the throne. The imperial response read: *"In this world, good and evil arise from the heart. Good deeds are like the waves of rivers and seas—coming without trace, leaving without root. Evil brings swift retribution, like the products of Heaven and Earth, manifesting everywhere. How can one not be cautious?"* It ordered a stele to be erected at the abbey gate, proclaiming Zhenwu’s unerring retribution, and a proclamation issued throughout the realm as a perpetual warning.

*Recorded by [Shu] Gong, with conferred titles.*

The Pavilion of Responding Treasures was favored by the deity’s unseen aid. In manifesting such evident numinosity, [Shu] Gong is deemed worthy.

All aforementioned titles are conferred as before. By imperial edict, a eulogy is composed for the pavilion’s dedication, its text inscribed upon the treasure. *"Of all things the origin, its盛 virtue may be entrusted. Its essence pierces the Dark Heaven, its numinous radiance resplendent. The wellspring of flourishing benefit, it safeguards the Great Harmony. With incense and reverence offered, the Five Fortunes follow in its wake."*
