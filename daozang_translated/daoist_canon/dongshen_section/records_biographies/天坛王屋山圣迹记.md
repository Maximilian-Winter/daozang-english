**Preface to the Sacred Traces of Tiantan and Wangwu Mountain**
By Du Guangting, Master of Broad Completion of the Tang

To safeguard the state and secure the ancestral altars, the imperial court, by divine decree, established the *Luotian* grand offering and cast golden dragons and jade tablets into the renowned mountains and grotto-heavens of the realm. According to the *White Jade Scripture of Guishan in the Daoist Canon*, these sites are enumerated in detail. Among them, within the Ten Great Grotto-Heavens, lies the Grotto of Lesser Existence and Pure Emptiness of Wangwu Mountain, spanning ten thousand *li* in circumference, situated in Wangwu County northwest of the Eastern Capital. It is governed by the Perfected King, the Divine Immortal.

Tradition holds that in the first year of his reign, on the *jiazi* day of the first lunar month, the Yellow Emperor arrayed his mats upon Wangwu Mountain. After purifying himself for three days, he ascended to the summit and, at the Jasper Grove Terrace, offered prayers to the Supreme Emperor, seeking to vanquish Chiyou. Thereupon, the Queen Mother of the West descended upon the Heavenly Altar. Once she had alighted, the Yellow Emperor personally attended her. The Queen Mother then summoned the Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea and the Mysterious Maiden of the Nine Heavens, bestowing upon the emperor the strategy to defeat Chiyou. Following her command, the Yellow Emperor slew Chiyou in Ji, and the realm was thereafter unopposed, the land at peace.

The Queen Mother dispatched the White Tiger Spirit of the West to present the Yellow Emperor with a robe of dark feathers. She then commanded him to convene at the wilds of Guzhu. The emperor reverently accepted her decree, fasting and purifying himself before setting forth with a solemn retinue. Upon arriving at Guzhu, he beheld in the void a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders—some with youths in azure robes and topknots, others clad in five-colored feathered garments, some riding flying dragons, others flying tigers, still others phoenixes and cranes. Some bore pearl banners, brocade parasols, rainbow standards, and crimson staffs; others held ruyi scepters, nine-curved tables, or led processions of singing and dancing performers—all beyond description.

Presently, a jeweled carriage appeared, drawn by five-colored mottled dragons with nine heads, its nine-tiered canopy adorned with feathers. Within sat a female immortal, robed in yellow, crowned in gold, approaching in radiant splendor. To her left and right, a divine youth addressed the emperor: "This is the Queen Mother of the West." The emperor went forth to receive her, and the Queen Mother commanded two divine lads to bid him sit. She congratulated him, saying: "May the sacred body be at peace, and the realm at rest. Yet long have you toiled in warfare—are you not weary?" The emperor replied: "By the boundless grace of the Supreme Emperor and the sagely instruction of the Divine Mother, the realm is now at peace. How dare I claim merit?"

The Queen Mother then ordered a feast prepared. Flowers, fruits, and celestial delicacies were served upon vessels of dazzling brilliance, each of varying size, none of which could be identified. She further dispatched the immortal maiden Song Miaoying to sing the hymn of *Ten Thousand Years of Longevity*. After the song, the Queen Mother bestowed upon the emperor several stalks of *lingzhi*, which, upon consumption, banished hunger and thirst. She also presented him with the *Scripture of the Seven Flavors of Cultivating the True*. Having bestowed these gifts, she ascended into the heavens.

Three years later, on the first day of the eighth month, the Queen Mother sent the White Tiger Spirit of the West as her messenger. At that time, the Yellow Emperor was at Dayuan Mountain to receive her command. He immediately purified himself and journeyed to Luoyang. From Baipo Ford, he crossed the river and arrived at Wangwu Mountain, where he fasted for three days before ascending the peak on the fifteenth day of the eighth month. At the summit, he offered incense and prayers. Suddenly, a fragrant celestial aroma wafted from the west, descending from the heavens and permeating the valleys. A black crow arrived first, and the emperor declared: "The Divine Mother descends!" Soon after, he beheld in the void a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, arrayed as they had been at Guzhu.

Upon descending at the Heavenly Altar, the emperor arranged his mats below. He saw the immortal assembly clad in feathered robes and crowned with bamboo circlets, their pendants and sandals adorned with black ravens. The emperor glanced about repeatedly, and the Queen Mother asked: "Why do you do so?" The emperor replied: "I fear my attendants are not vigilant." The Queen Mother said: "Why do you not speak truthfully?" The emperor then answered candidly, and the Queen Mother said: "The raiment of heaven is not for the mortal world. These garments may not be worn except when paying homage to the stars, the king, or one’s parents." The emperor said: "I, facing south as sovereign, dare not bestow feathered robes upon my ministers." The Queen Mother replied: "Well said. From this day forth, feathered robes shall not bow to emperors."

The emperor wished to prepare a feast, but the Queen Mother stopped him, saying: "My immortal assembly knows neither hunger nor thirst. How could we desire the fare of the mortal world?" She then admonished the emperor: "If you wish to make offerings to the divine immortals, the celestial bodies of the upper realms, the sun, or the moon, simply choose an auspicious day, construct an altar, arrange the ritual mats, and present incense, lamps, flowers, and fruits. If these are unavailable, pure water and medicinal herbs may suffice. Nothing more is required." Having spoken, the Queen Mother bestowed upon the emperor the azure mist nectar and the crimson essence fruit before ascending into the heavens.

From that time onward, on the fifteenth day of the eighth month each year, virtuous scholars from all directions gather upon this mountain. On this day, the register of immortal merits is also examined and recorded at the Pure Emptiness Palace. Furthermore, the *True Records* state: During the reign of the Mysterious Origin Emperor, the dragon spirits of the four seas were commanded to construct the Ten Great Grotto-Heavens of the world. They used *qianggu* stones, stacked layer upon layer, which remain here to this day.

The Upper Inquiry Abbey is also known as the Upper Inquiry Court. In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor sought counsel from the four mountains, hence its name. Later, Sima Chengzhen renamed it the Upper Abbey. During the reign of Emperor Ruizong of the Tang, Princess Yuzhen cultivated the Dao at the Golden Immortal Abbey, which is now the Divine Capital Abbey. The emperor visited the True Origin and Golden Immortal Abbeys, which face the Western Capital. Departing from the Dark Warrior Gate, he crossed the great river and arrived at Dongzhang Village, where he established the Dongzhang Post Station. The mountain spans the jurisdictions of four counties: east to Jiyuan, south to Heqing, west to Shaosun, and north to Shangcheng, each responsible for patrolling and protecting the Golden Immortal and True Origin Abbeys.

Since the time of the Yellow Emperor, down to the Jin dynasty, when the Lady Wei of the Southern Peak was ennobled by the Supreme Emperor, the Perfected Wang Zideng, Lord of the Grotto of Lesser Existence, descended to instruct Wei Huacun at the Pure Emptiness Abbey. After the forty-seven Perfected Ones completed their Daoist studies, the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Southern Peak welcomed Lady Wei to assume her post as Director of Destinies at Mount Heng of the Southern Peak.

The heavens and earth do not speak, so we must rely upon collected writings to reveal ancient traditions and record present affairs. The sacred realm of True Origin existed before the division of primordial chaos, when the qi of the Dao enveloped its wondrous essence. Once yin and yang separated, the true forms emerged, appearing in the mysterious classics and inscribed in illustrated scriptures, that later generations might know their origins.

It is said that the Dark Mystery of Heaven established its symbols, setting the sun and moon to traverse the celestial balance, while the Way of Earth wove its net, arraying mountains and rivers to order governance. There is Wangwu Mountain, located over a hundred *li* north of Luoyang Capital, beyond the Yellow River. Its grandeur is mighty, its qi robust, its ridges and hills linked in succession, towering into the great void and leaning against the constellations. To the west, it joins the Kunlun Range; to the east, it stretches to the Eastern Sea.

According to the *Tortoise Mountain White Jade Upper Scripture*, "The grotto-heaven encircles ten thousand *li*, the source of mountains and waters." The *Illustrated Scripture* states: "Above, it connects to the Kunlun; below, it presses upon Penglai Isle. Its highest peak is called Altar of Heaven Mountain." The *Inner Transmission of the Yellow Emperor* records: "It is named the Jasper Grove Terrace." The *True Records* states: "The Jasper Grove is none other than the alternate heaven of Pure Emptiness and Lesser Existence." Below it arises the bubbling waters of the Ji River, wherein grow water lotuses; those who consume them attain longevity.

In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor ascended the altar and saw a single step, nearly two *zhang* in height, with two lower stone steps, each about seventy *chi* tall. The four sides stood sheer, formed by the fusion of creation. Here, the Yellow Emperor made his address to Heaven, and in response, the Nine Heavens’ Dark Maiden and the Queen Mother of the West descended to bestow the *Scripture of the Nine Cauldrons Divine Elixir*, the *Yin Talismans*, and the *Stratagems*. Thereby, he overcame the faction of Chiyou, and thus began the Altar of Heaven.

Its summit abounds in stones where grasses and trees grow, serving as the gathering place for the Five Peaks, Four Sacred Mountains, Ten Great Grotto-Heavens, and Thirty-Six Lesser Grotto-Heavens, where immortals and transcendents convene. On the eighteenth day of the third month and other grand assembly days, at the first light of dawn when the sky is clear, one may hear the distant, resonant toll of immortal bells echoing from the far grottoes, pure and sweet to the ear. As the sun rises, a radiant crimson qi shines forth, revealing the conditions of life and death and the transformations of heaven and earth. At the break of dawn, immortal parrots announce the morning, often descending in flight, smaller than domestic parrots, their feathers white as snow.

At the heart of the altar stands a stone lampstand, over a *zhang* tall at its four gates, wondrously crafted to guard the grotto-heaven. On grand assembly days, the numinous mountains’ true sages and immortals gather at the altar to examine those who study the Dao and review the records of good and evil in the world. On such days, dark clouds often shroud the summit, dispersing only at dusk. Daoist adepts and those cultivating immortality submit petitions and offer prayers of thanksgiving.

At the altar’s base, an inscription on a small stele, *Record of the Stone Lampstand*, states: "In the eighth year of the Tianbao era, the Prefect of Xin’an, acting on imperial command, had the eunuch official Tu Lingfu Yan Xi construct this stele for the altar, praying for the state and the people." The names Lu Quan, Gao Chang, and Yan Gu were carved in intaglio, but by the fifth year of the Dahe era, the characters had worn away.

The altar’s heart rises prominently, towering above the surrounding peaks. At sunrise, its shadow stretches westward, obscuring the western mountain ridges for over a thousand *li*. No birds fly above it; the wind sounds like the sighing of pines. In the great void, it stands solitary and perilous, yet unobstructed on all sides. One who stands upon it feels the harmony of qi and blood, as if emboldened, standing straight and gazing clearly, able to discern one’s own form and shadow. It is as if one leans from a height, gazing into the distance, soaring over cliffs and valleys. Before dawn breaks, the body seems like floating duckweed, as if borne by refined qi, drifting yet unable to fall—truly a place where true immortals wander. Yet if the heart lacks resolve, one’s essence and spirit may dissipate, and fear may arise.

For those of the Dao, when the body feels weightless and the sky is bright, one may hear at night the sounds of laughter and conversation, or the music of flutes and drums above. To the west of the altar lies a hanging spring called the Supreme Unity Spring. Its waters are sweet as nectar, flowing in a thread-like stream into a stone basin several *chi* deep. A thousand people may drink from it without depletion, and it remains unchanged year after year.

Further west is a stone cliff named Black Dragon Grotto. Midway up the cliff, tens of *zhang* high, lies a cave over two *zhang* deep, directly facing the northwestern Heavenly Gate. It is called the Cloud-Pressing Hermitage, once accessible by a kudzu ladder. Here, the Supreme Unity Primordial Sovereign cultivated the Dao. The waters of the Supreme Unity Spring flow beneath it, converging to form the Ji River. To the south of the spring is a cliff called Purple Gold Hall, where the Yellow Emperor once rested beneath a pine pavilion. The path is treacherous, leading to a stone gate where one must turn sideways to ascend to the altar’s summit. This gate is called the Eastern Heavenly Gate, and to its east stands the Robing Pavilion.

Atop the altar is the Hall of the Three Purities, with eastern and western cloisters. Beside the altar stands a four-cornered pavilion, perched a hundred *chi* above the cliff. Leaning on its railings and gazing in all directions, one sees to the south the Shaoshi Peak of Mount Song and the Yellow River like a sash. To the west lies Wangfu Mountain, and to the northeast, the Three Grottoes Altar of the Queen Mother. There, a stone over a *zhang* long and a *chi* wide juts from the cliff’s edge, plunging a hundred *zhang* below. Those who ascend the altar tend its incense and pay homage to the Queen Mother’s Three Grottoes, though the fearful dare not step upon the stone, called the Mind-Stabilizing Stone.

To the north, one sees Mount Xicheng; to the northeast, the Taihang Range. To the east, the sun rises like a living thing over the Eastern Sea. Gazing in all directions, the surrounding mountains appear low as mounds, revealing the grotto-heaven’s unique supremacy and the exalted traces of the immortals. To the east of the altar rises a graceful peak called Sun Essence Peak; to the west, another named Moon Radiance Peak.

To the south of the peak lies a level ridge called Cloud-Treading Ridge, beneath which flows a ravine named Refuge-from-Qin Gully. Descending southwest along the Eighteen Turns, one next reaches the White Immortal’s Bridge. To the east stands Crouching Dragon Ridge, and to the south, a small peak named Stork’s Pestle Peak. Further down lies the Upturned-Heaven Pool, and beyond it, a resting pavilion stands along the path.

From the altar’s summit to the Upper Cloister spans eight *li*, also called Central Rock Terrace, where Sima Ziwei once cultivated, wandered, and rested. Below it flows the Purple Tenuity Stream, leading to the Terrace of Yang eight *li* away. Within its precincts lie the Immortal Cat Grotto and the Fountain of Agelessness. To the east of the terrace stands the Well of Alchemist Yan’s Elixir-Washing, still extant. A hundred paces northeast of the Terrace of Yang, the place is commonly called Yan’s Spring.

Before the terrace, eight ridges branch out, named the Corpse-Transcended Immortal Ridges. The Master Celestial Officer Sima Chengzhen, a native of Wen City in Henei, was a descendant of Sima Xuanwang of the Western Jin. The site of his ancestral home, Zhao Xian City, lies twenty *li* west of present-day Wen County, where the tombs of three Jin emperors remain. During the reign of Emperor Ruizong of the Tang, his daughter, the Princess of Jade Perfection, favored the Dao and became Sima’s disciple. The Master resided on Purple Cloud Peak behind Mount Tiantai, and Emperor Ruizong summoned him to dwell at the Upper Cloister.

Sima’s first teacher was Pan Shizheng of Mount Song, whose own master was Wang Shengzhen of Mount Mao, who in turn studied under Tao Hongjing, the Recluse of Huayang. Thus, the transmission remained unbroken through four generations. When Emperor Minghuang ascended the throne, he ordered the restoration of the Terrace of Yang in the twelfth year of the Kaiyuan era. The emperor personally inscribed the plaque for the Liao Yang Hall, within which were enshrined statues of the Five Elder Immortals.

At the Terrace of Yang hangs a bell inscribed with the sixty-four hexagrams, called the Bell of Myriad Forms. There is an altar named the Altar of Dharma Forms, and a bell tower called the Tower of Qi Manifestations. To the northwest of the hall stands a Daoist abbey named White Cloud Abbey—Sima’s sobriquet was Master White Cloud. Within it stands Pine Pavilion and a shrine to the Master. He composed a work titled *Records of the White Cloud*, written in a distinctive seal script known as Golden Scissors, which circulated widely.

Before his ascension, the Master annotated the *Supreme Mystery Scripture of Ascent* and the *Treatise on Sitting in Forgetfulness*, both of which also spread through the world. On the fifteenth day of the eighth month in the fifteenth year of the Kaiyuan era, a pair of cranes circled the altar’s northwest before departing. At that moment, White Cloud emerged from the hall, and the music of the *Xiao Shao* was heard—this was the sign of the Master’s divine transformation. Cui Riyong, the magistrate of Wangwu County, reported the event to the emperor, who marveled at it.

When the Master ascended, he was eighty-nine years old. He was posthumously enfeoffed as Grand Master for Splendid Happiness with Silver and Cyan, and his posthumous title was Master White Cloud. On the western wall of the hall, a mural depicts the Master traveling in a carriage drawn by a yellow calf, with white clouds following step by step.

To the west of the terrace stands the Temple of the Mountain Spirit, the deity of Mount Wangwu. During the Tianbao era, this spirit aided Guo Ziyi with spectral troops to defeat An Lushan. Later, Emperor Minghuang enfeoffed the deity as the Heavenly King of the Supreme Numinous Spirit and ordered the temple’s restoration.

To the south of the terrace lies the Temple of Mount Tai. Eight *li* west of Wangwu County stands the Flower-Hiding Grotto, whose waters turn green in spring, red in summer, white in autumn, and purple in winter, yet remain sweet and refreshing. Adjoining the altar to the southeast is a mountain called Green Gauze Peak, beneath which lies the Abbey of the Immortal in Green Gauze, its stele still standing.

To the north of the altar rises Five Bushels Peak, connecting to the two mountains of Hemp Basket and Medicine Chest. Within Mount Wangwu lies a grotto too deep to explore, its interior resembling a royal palace—hence the name Wangwu, or "Royal Chamber." East of Medicine Chest Mountain stands Zhao’s Hermitage, where the Perfected Zhao once cultivated, and where four Perfected Ones refined elixirs. There are over twenty stone chambers, where the Immortal Huo practiced his arts, now called Master Huo’s Hall.

To the southeast of the altar lies a mountain called Qi Ridge, beneath which stands Hairpin Peak. Nearby lies the Grotto of Lesser Existence in Pristine Emptiness. Within its bounds, one may wander ten thousand *li*. In the Tang dynasty, the Three Clarities Hall and the Abbey of Pristine Emptiness were built there. Later, during wartime, villagers took refuge inside, and the grotto’s qi was defiled. After they departed, rocks fell and sealed the entrance.

The *Declarations of the Perfected* states: Within this grotto, the sun and moon shine day and night, their radiance illuminating the vast emptiness just as they do in the outer world—this is where the roots of the sun and moon lie concealed. The sun is the essence of yang, the moon the essence of yin, their brilliance shining within the grotto-heaven. The sky is vast, the stars and clouds visible, yet no grasses or trees grow, nor any of the myriad beings.

Within the grotto’s palaces stand towers and halls of gold and jade, filled with treasures beyond description—gold, mother-of-pearl, chalcedony, and jasper. There are five gates and five mountains, surpassing the Five Peaks. Above grow purple forests, square blossoms, star marrow, golden nectar, azure down, and vermilion numina. At night, they bear delicate fruits, all born of the grotto-heavens within the pot. Those who partake of them become long-lived immortals.

The grotto’s lord, Lord Wang, oversees the registers of immortals and the records of good and evil, administering affairs therein. The Supreme Dao Lord of the Three Primes of Primordial Simplicity dispatched the Left Lady of Azure Perfection, Guo Linggai, and the Right Lady of Jade Radiance, Yang Yuhua, bearing a divine tally and jade seal to confer upon Lord Wang the title of Perfected One of Pristine Emptiness in Primordial Simplicity, entrusting him with governance of the Grotto-Heaven of Lesser Existence in Pristine Emptiness.

Lord Wang divides his rule among four bureaus. The Left Guardian Duke administers the grotto-heaven of Mount Wangwu, attended by three hundred golden lads and jade maidens. He oversees the *Supreme Clarity Jade Chapters of the Treasure Mystery of Primordial Simplicity*, the *Divine Writ of the Nine Transcendents of the Upper Rank*, and the *Wondrous Scripture of Mountains and Seas*. He also presides over the *Bright Radiance Precious Register of the Three Heavens* within the grotto. Empowered to ride dragons and tigers, and to ascend in golden chariots, jasper wheels, and the Eight Radiance Flying Carriage, he enters the Supreme Clarity, serves in the Primordial Simplicity, and reposes in the Great Ultimate.

The Grotto-Heaven of Lesser Existence in Pristine Emptiness is the foremost among the Ten Great Grotto-Heavens, the Thirty-Six Lesser Grotto-Heavens, and the Seventy-Two Blessed Lands.

The immortal capital reveres him as its patriarch, and the Most High safeguards him, thus his office is held in solemn trust and entrusted to the host of perfected beings.

The Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning declared: "This Grotto-Heaven of Lesser Existence is the foremost of the Ten Great Grotto-Heavens and the supreme head of the Thirty-Six Lesser Grotto-Heavens. To the east of Qi Ridge lies a mountain named Jade Yang Mountain. To its southeast, a waterfall cascades like a bolt of silk, a hundred feet in length, plunging into a ravine halfway down the cliff, where a deep pool named Resonant Bell Abyss lies. The mountain is also called Western Jade Yang Mountain. To the northeast of Lingling’s capital stands another mountain, Eastern Jade Yang Mountain, within which a cave extends a hundred feet deep. The imperial court periodically casts golden dragons into this cave. Beside the cave rests a Crane-Resting Terrace, several *zhang* in height, where crane footprints remain. Long ago, Prince Jin of Zhou King Ling’s court, accompanied by his master Fuqiu Gong, returned from roaming the Heavenly Altar and rested his crane here.

The Heavenly Altar is encircled by peaks, ridges, ravines, and springs—all scenic wonders—catalogued as follows.

*Eulogy:*
The Heavenly Altar of Mount Wangwu, a blessed land divine,
Where the Grotto-Heaven of Lesser Existence in Pristine Emptiness holds sway.
Its boundless marvels transcend mortal ken,
Yet tales of its numinous power echo through time.

*Edict of Emperor Ruizong of Tang Granting the Daoist Master Sima the Title "Master of White Clouds," Along with a Poem and a Stele Prohibiting Entry to the Sacred Mountain*

*Inscription by Emperor Ruizong the Great Sage:*
I respectfully inquire of Master Refiner Sima of Mount Tiantai: That mountain soars above the earth’s axis, rivaling the Four Bright Peaks in eclipsing the sun and equaling the Eight Grottoes in veiling the clouds. Its pearl palaces gleam, its jade trees shimmer, nine sacred mushrooms bear their luster, eight cassia trees unfurl their fragrance. Within the realm of Red City it endures, while the people of Blue Stream dwell therein.

Master Refiner Sima’s virtue surpasses that of the River Master, his Dao outstrips that of Fuqiu. He roams the courts of the Azure Vault and strides alone through the realms of the Blue Prime. Since ascending the throne, I have long relied upon his sagely guidance. Though Emperor Yao pored over maps with yearning heart and the Yellow Emperor, ruling his realm, cherished thoughts of Mount Kongtong, my longing for him surpasses even theirs. As summer’s heat grows, may your transcendent steps tread in cool harmony. I long to hear your true words, to dispel my ignorance. Morning and evening, my thoughts linger, my heart soars to distant borders.

I wished to dispatch envoys to welcome you, but feared you might be startled. Thus, I send your elder brother instead, hoping you will come together. Though the journey is not far, I first inquire after your well-being. Thus, I write.

*The Second Day*
Master Refiner, your Dao is attested by truth, your virtue resides in emptiness and stillness. You follow the distant path of Guye, kindling the supreme winds of Juci. Since dedicating yourself to refining elixirs in renowned mountains and seeking the perfected in grotto-valleys, you have scaled the crimson cliffs of the Earth’s Lung and sat amidst the white clouds of Mount Tiantai. Since Guangchengzi, there has been none like you. You are fully capable of unfolding the mysteries of the immortal gardens, adorning the jade portals of the Dao. The seas and mountains gain luster from you, while wind and clouds shift hue at your presence.

Your disciple, longing for the River Master, gazes toward your secluded peaks. When the crane-drawn carriage arrives and the phoenix descends upon the capital, you will meet the crow of Anqi and hear the zither of Jiqiu. Following the wind to seek the Dao, I trust this day is nigh. I present a luminous mirror, its craftsmanship wondrous and subtle, embodying the essence of the profound Dao and the image of the Great One’s *Yi*. It is stored in a precious casket, inscribed for your contemplation. Thus, I write.

*The Twenty-Eighth Day*
Master, your Daoist wind stands alone in its loftiness, your true *qi* is peerless in its distinction. You dine on rosy clouds beyond Red City and ride the winds above the Purple Empyrean. You withdraw from the world without vexation, encountering the times with patience. You pay homage at the palace of Penglai and soon shall return to the cliffs of Tongxiang. The phoenix’s raiment and the rare treasures of the immortals are difficult to detain. Though you have dwelled in leisure for three months, savoring the nourishment of Guangcheng, and though a thousand miles separate us, my thoughts turn to the sentiments of Ziling. Yet, as the paths of action and reclusion differ, and as gathering and parting are but natural principles, this farewell bears no regret.

White clouds drift, distant as the horizon. As you depart, my heart labors with longing. With respect, I send this to express my thoughts. My words are few, thus I write.

*The Nineteenth Day*
*Edict of Emperor Xuanzong the Divine Martial:*
In his leisure from breath cultivation, Master Refiner Sima delights in zither and books, roaming freely amidst white clouds, hastening to the mystic gardens. His lofty virtue is worthy of reverence, yet my longing for the creeping vines and mosses is hard to forsake. His refined aspirations are difficult to match, but I respectfully comply with the wishes of Master Red Pine and Wangzi Qiao. Though we exchange but a single word, you soon return to the celestial realm of Ge’s Tiantai. The Dao’s defense is thus complete, and the earth’s veins shrink back like those of Changfang.

Take care to nurture yourself, preserving your youthful countenance. Follow your aspirations wherever they lead. I briefly convey these humble words.

Having honored the former master’s intent and set aside the weight of future partings, I dispatch this missive—little more is said.

*Fifteenth Day*
*Five-Character Verse Composed by Emperor Ruizong to Send Master Refiner Sima Back to Mount Tiantai*

From the Purple Palace seek the worthy knight,
From Clear Stream trace the reclusive sage.
River and lake, palace and city—
Different paths, distinct in kind.
Yet some who dwell in hidden seclusion
Clearly weary of the world’s dust.
Forests and springs first know their nature,
Lingzhi and cassia refine their spirit.
The earth’s Dao crosses Mount Jiling,
Tiantai meets the sea’s edge.
From this moment on, your fame and virtue—
Through ten thousand ages, one fragrant spring.

*Five-Character Verse*
*By Du Zimei*

Through all time, the immortal altar’s scene,
A harbor links the Lesser Realm of Heaven.
The famed mountain truly praises its people,
Waves roar where true bricks are laid.
Its qi and form stand above heaven and earth,
Its root and origin precede the cosmos.
Each dawn, it honors the sacred,
The Dao’s law universally complete.

*Five-Character Extended Verse*
*Immortal of the Golden Gate, Hermit of the Forest*

This realm is most towering,
Ascending near the Dipper’s handle.
Heaven’s origin gathers all sages,
Earth’s veins bow ten thousand peaks.
Westward it clasps the lofty Kunlun,
Eastward it stretches to Penglai’s distant sea.
Sweet springs rise from jade summits,
Stable altars press upon golden slopes.
Taihua’s three peaks stand tall,
The Yellow River flows in a single band.
At fifth watch, watch the sun rise over the sea,
At midnight, hear the *Xiao Shao* melody.
Moonlit, wander low along Dragon Ridge,
Cold mist seals Rainbow Bridge.
Snow pheasants cry *wo-wo*,
Wind through bamboo hums *xiao-xiao*.
Cloud chambers waft incense smoke,
Mushroom lamps dissolve auspicious hues.
Hemp baskets brim with vital qi,
Medicine cabinets reveal sacred sprouts.
The cinnabar well remains clear and shallow,
The divine bell again falls silent.
Eight ridges rise steeply,
Twin cranes drift in pairs.
Waterfalls hang like silver threads,
Rosy clouds mark the city’s towers.
Pools run so clear they show the depths,
Cypresses soar, green against the sky.
The Daoist abbey’s new halls stand grand,
The Perfected Lord’s old affairs stretch far.
Often gazing toward the blue peaks,
White clouds drift by from time to time.
The stone chamber lies empty, unanswering,
The terrace pines stay old yet undying.
Rock flowers spread like brocade,
Stream currents rinse like jade.
Valleys and ravines shun worldly pleasures,
Forests and peaks block the clamor of the age.
The Yellow Emperor unfurled his colored banners,
The Queen Mother rode her phoenix carriage.
Dawn and dusk shift yin and yang,
Heat and cold follow the seasons’ turn.
Dusk apes cry and fall silent,
Clear mists gather and disperse.
Songs and verses may record these scenes,
But skill cannot easily depict them.
In youth, I hoped to pluck osmanthus,
In later years, I delight in a gourd bowl.
With resolve, I would follow Yi and Huo,
Without talent, I cannot aid Shun and Yao.
Unrolling the scroll, I ever revere this place,
Wielding the brush, my admiration deepens.
Sensual pleasures and passions all fade,
The interest in mystery and stillness already transcends.
When may I return to choose reclusion?
High-stepping, I would seek Red Pine and Wang Qiao.

*Three Seven-Character Verses*

A thousand valleys’ pine and mistletoe brush purple mist,
On the cinnabar terrace, secrets run deep where immortals gather.
Heaven and earth weave their essence into this sacred peak,
Sun and moon’s flying roots illuminate the grotto-heaven.
The dusty world shifts darkly—how many ages have passed?
The peach trees, just ripened, mark no years.
Let worldly folk not fathom these subtle matters—
Five-colored clouds seal the fields of the King.

In the Lesser Realm of Heaven within the Clear Void Grotto,
Silver seats, golden slopes, jade summits stand firm.
Lingzhi sprouts from the Dragon Han kalpa,
Cinnabar forms since the Red Bright era.
The well of Xican records Yan Luo’s son,
White Water Immortals gather on the plain.
I send word to those who fled Qin in the ravine:
First build a thatched hut with two or three rafters.

White stones gleam, reaching toward heaven,
Green pines flourish, overlooking the stream.
Grasses born in blessed lands all become medicine,
Those who dwell on famed mountains are all immortals.
To welcome guests, seek ferns deep in the crags,
Boil tea, fill cups with spring water from the grotto.
In a past life, I must have been a child of white clouds—
In this world, I return to lie atop emerald peaks.

*Thirty Rhymes in Seven Characters*
*By Master Tongzhen*

Shaking off worldly ties, desireless and serene,
I idly peruse maps and scriptures, seeking peaks and streams.
Where among forests and springs does my heart find ease?
Gathering zither and books, I will choose a site to build.
Though the path is rugged, I dare not refuse a thousand miles,
Binding myself to Taihang, entering Wangwu.
First I explore the hidden flower dell—when
Will the coiled peaches ever ripen?
Yan Luo’s old dwelling, the Terrace of Yang,
Nine dragons play with pearls amid painted curtains.
The cinnabar well lies deep, steeped in moonlight,
Twin-bunned immortal lads hold ginseng and eagles.
Craning my neck, I greedily gaze at Flower Canopy Peak,
Suddenly I find myself in the Purple Tenuity Valley.
Above, pavilions and towers idle among clouds,
Gold and azure glow mingling in the forest’s depths.
In the Ravine of Fleeing Qin, its Fleeing Qin folk—
At midnight, I hear songs of gathering lingzhi.
Leaning on my staff, I climb the gaunt Dragon Ridge,
My face like a sword turned west toward Shu.
Groping past *Shen* and *Jing*, I ascend toward truth,
A thousand-fathom cliff hangs a single log.
From dawn to dusk, my legs give out—
Just as I reach the Purple Gold Hall to lodge.
Bowing again, I taste the Supreme One’s spring,
Suddenly feeling refreshed, my ailing bones dissolve.
Vaguely, dimly, between the nine skies,
Ten thousand acres of misty light sober my drunken eyes.
Reverently I knock at the immortal altar, praying to the true realm,
The altar linked to heaven, cut off from worldly dust.
Silver seats, golden slopes, jade summits run cold,
The Emperor sends immortal officials to divide their posts.
Within the Lesser Realm lies a land of ten thousand miles,
Pressing down all thirty-six grotto-heavens.
Sun essence and moon radiance, wonders left and right,
Dark hues lean against the sky like carved jade.
Eastward, I watch the sea’s sun spill crimson,
Westward, I gaze toward the far edge where the altar’s shadow stays green.
Beneath the elixir furnace, the earth still holds fragrance—
How many *hu* of divine cinnabar have been produced?
The mountain’s envoys wield the *Tai’e* sword,
Guarding the sacred body—who would dare profane it?
The Queen Mother’s grotto runs deep, unfathomable,
Thunder often shakes the dragons’ den.
Pointing afar to the Three Officials’ Proofreading Terrace,
Woodcutters several times hear strings and flutes.
Before the Unadorned Rock, herb-gathering lads,
Fingering golden lingzhi, clad in *bili* vines.
The Northern Dipper stretches level with the Dipper’s stars,
Naturally, the heavenly pass connects to the earth’s axis.
Hemp baskets and medicine cabinets link in emerald,
Auspicious grasses and sacred sprouts fragrantly lush.
Now I hear immortal hounds barking at immortal lamps,
Now I see immortals riding immortal deer.
Strange traces and wondrous signs are hard to recount—
I would inscribe a poem, but my brush’s tip is worn.
A short song I hum to those bound by fame and profit:
Who would come to share this secluded solitude?
A long whistle from a lone stone,
Purple clouds drift by, bearing a yellow magpie.

Within these scenes, one suspects the immortal Ma Gu,
Her tinkling laughter at the world’s fleeting light.

**Five-Character Poem**
A cliff stands three thousand *ren* tall,
Its altar’s height brushes the Tail of the Winnowing Basket.
At its summit lies the marrow of green jade,
Around its waist hides the purple-gold *lingzhi*.
The moon hangs over the Palace of the Void Sovereign,
Clouds seal the Pool of the Great One.
A grotto-heaven where human traces are few,
Cranes nest on branches of ten thousand years.

**Three-Character Lines**
What Earth bears,
What Heaven covers.
Form and image—
who first discerned their signs?
The Five Phases weave,
the Two Luminaries wheel.
Flowing as rivers—
how vast their expanse!
The Four Seas calm,
the Nine Rivers channeled.
Rising as mountains—
how many their names!
Divine are the peaks,
lofty the ranges.
Behold the Heavenly Altar,
the ultimate subtlety of the Dao.
Precipitous, solitary, towering—
not easily reached.
Sunrise and sunset
reveal its lingering glow.
East and west it spans,
cutting through the distant sea.
Sudden marvels of light
strike awe and dread.
Great dragon candles,
tiny fireflies’ glow.
Not always seen,
they appear at the call of resonance.
Clear and bright the reed pipes,
graceful the cranes’ dance.
The path of feathered immortals—
here lies its crux.
Mounds like green conches,
cliffs like jade hairpins.
To the left, Orion’s Well,
to the right, the Cinnabar Turtle.
Lifting the veil of Clear Void,
the peerless aperture.
Long ago, imperial envoys
came to proclaim its glory.
Since the days of the Yellow Emperor,
before the temples of Tang and Yu.
Linking the rites of firewood and prospect,
all offered personal sacrifices.
When the ashes of *mang* and *jie* were exhausted,
heavenly flames arose.
Halls and eaves collapsed,
crimson and azure hues lost.
Herds of deer and boars
mingled with reeds and brambles.
Why did I come?
To mourn this desolation.
Only when ruin is profound
does great creation begin.
The sage’s works,
the worthy’s continuations.
Delving into the profound mysteries of the Primordial,
their words arcane and abstruse.
The deeper the exploration,
the more radiant the principle.
Though the pattern is subtle,
it is no mere plagiarism.
May it endure henceforth,
a perpetual decree.

Now, the Heavenly Altar—since the Yellow Emperor’s time to the present, its lofty eminence has been unparalleled. Today, as the August Empress assumes the dragon throne, unifying the realm under shared script and harmonious winds and rains, with heaven and humanity in perfect accord, feudal lords come as guests, and all lands call her "Father." Thus, she commands the Grand Master of Court Audiences, Zhen Yongjian, to oversee the rites, bearing precious incense to the Heavenly Altar. With the ritual of triple libations, he invokes the deities, praying for the peace of the imperial house.

Moreover, this sacred mountain stands at the heart of Hua and Yi, crowning the grotto-heavens. Its peaks layer in emerald, its sheer cliffs towering, while dawn and dusk invert the light, and the two stars of Shen pierce the clearing sky. Auspicious creatures and divine beings seem scarcely within reach.

Yet as time flows and transformations shift, creation alters its course. Divine beings fade, mountains crumble—whereupon the official reports to the Empress Dowager. Her sagely decree declares: "This is the land of the dragon’s rise, the spirit of our nation. It is our duty; it must not be abandoned." She orders artisans to carve a jade image, honoring the sacred, and commands the Grand Master of Instruction, Wu Tianyou, to bear the jade likeness and sacred relics, enshrining them in the grotto-heaven to eternally safeguard the imperial domain, as steadfast as Mount Tai’s foundation, as boundless as the Bohai’s expanse.

The director of this temple, Ning Zhu, entrusted me, Wan Jisen, to record this grandeur. Thus, I extol and inscribe: the jade soars, resplendent as the Emperor of the Primordial; the imperial grace uniquely bestows its blessing upon the mountains and rivers. The sagely court’s abundance is near at hand—may our sovereign’s reign endure for a hundred million years.
