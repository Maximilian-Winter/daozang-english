**Record of the Great Tang’s Zongsheng Abbey**
The ultimate principle is void and quiescent; the Dao is not the ordinary Dao. The wondrous gate is profound and distant; no name can name it. Since the Great Beginning unfolded its chart and the Primal Origin established its pole, the Three Powers took their places, and the myriad beings assumed their forms. Yet none knew the abode of the Lord of Images, nor had they glimpsed the realm of the Valley Spirit. The subtle and the imperceptible were sealed away, and the turbid and the marvelous were hidden, until the sudden rise of the Dark Bird and the revelation of the hidden scriptures unlocked their mysteries. Thereby, the transformative power of the supreme teaching blew through the ten thousand things, and the profound teaching thus took the lead.

Sage after sage inherited its illumination, and the transmission of the Dao and virtue passed from one to another. Thus, the teaching of the Primal Origin stirred the world like wind, flowing through the earth like water. The Zongsheng Abbey, originally named Louguan, was the former residence of Master Wen Shi, the Grand Master of Duke Kang of Zhou. He built a thatched hut into a tower, and thus it took its name. The Master embodied the virtue of spontaneity and was born in accord with the mysterious workings of the cosmos. His nature embraced the spirit, concealing his brilliance and hiding his radiance. He observed the stars and awaited the qi, discerning the signs of the perfected ones. When he encountered the immortal’s carriage, he faced north to receive the Dao. The Two Scriptures were expounded, and the Eight Directions turned toward its transformation. The rise of the great teaching began here.

This abbey stands in the heart of the Qin lands, facing the Zhongnan Mountains. To the east, it gazes upon the Li Peak, where misty vapors gather in abundance; to the west, it overlooks Mount Taibai, where the accumulated snow gleams white. The ancient hall where scriptures were transmitted remains secluded and pure; the sacred ox of the path still stands. Though dynasties have changed, the immortals endure forever. The land is old, and the earth is numinous, ever manifesting its auspicious responses. Auspicious clouds daily cover it, and longevity cranes arrive in season. No birds nest in its trees, and the wilds harbor protective beasts. The medicinal well of Wen Shi remains unfallen, like Han Fan’s; the carriage of Lord Lao stands indestructible.

As for those who trespassed or stole, they were restrained as if bound, all surrendering with their hands tied. In ancient times, King Mu of Zhou journeyed west, and King Wen of Qin hunted east, both turning their chariots to personally receive the teaching. The First Emperor of Qin built a temple south of the tower, and Emperor Wu of Han established an office north of the abbey. Lofty terraces stood empty and bright, beckoning the cloud-and-water immortals; secluded halls were scattered about, hosting the songs of Master Red Pine and Wang Qiao. From Qin and Han onward, the temple households continued without interruption. The visiting tablets of the Jin and Song dynasties remain to this day. Truly, this is the sacred precinct of the divine and the assembly hall of the perfected.

Emperor Wen of the Later Wei transformed barbarian customs into refined ones, establishing benevolence and righteousness as the guiding principles. He revered and believed in the teaching, expanding its followers and disciples. There was Master Chen Baochi of Yingchuan, who from youth possessed a secluded and reclusive disposition, harboring a love for forests and valleys. The wind in the pines delighted him, and famous mountains detained him. The Dao of the Jade Emperor flourished, and the cloud-built palaces of the Silver Terrace were erected.

Later, there was Master Wang Zixuan, whose words exhausted names and images, and whose thoughts penetrated the hidden and subtle. His mind dwelled in the mysterious void, untroubled by external things. Embracing the spirit, he remained naturally still. As a teacher to emperors and sages, his virtuous reputation shone brightly, becoming a model for the school. When Emperor Taizu of Zhou established his rule in Guannei, he personally received the Five Talismans. Emperor Wen of Sui, having bathed in fragrant waters and performed rites of reverence, heard of auspicious omens.

As the virtue of Sui declined, governance and teaching fell into decay. The Six Dragons lost their reins, and the Four Supports collapsed. The Yi and Yang roamed the pastures, and the streets and alleys were filled with the dead. Families practiced the ways of war, and the people fell into suffering. The Emperor, born to the age and answering its call, brought order to the realm. He quelled disorder and pacified chaos, nurturing all within the boundless expanse. His vastness matched heaven and earth, and his brilliance equaled the sun and moon. He swept away the wormwood from the palace steps and listened to the harmonious songs of the phoenix. He beheld the auspicious stars amidst the dark clouds and saw the unicorn in the wilds. He regulated rites and refined music, transforming customs and shifting mores. Farmers were encouraged by timely rains, and the fields yielded abundant grain; weaving women labored diligently at their looms, and their shuttles never stilled. The Nine Provinces sheathed their weapons, and the Three Frontiers were at peace. The western Rong reformed their ways, and the eastern Yi offered dances. From the northern deserts to the southern shores, all came to pay homage. His virtuous transformation reached far, and no place was untouched by its flow. The Three Goodnesses flourished, not by relying on the Two Shu. With one sagely heir, the myriad states stood firm.

Radiant and vast, his Dao matched the heavens; his understanding of the Way was innate. He revered the roots of the mysterious, honoring the footsteps of the sages. In the third year of Wude, he bestowed an auspicious name by imperial decree, changing Louguan to Zongsheng Abbey. The imperial mind was stirred, and the ancestral legacy took precedence. From the founding of the clan to the inheritance of the household, it traced back to the Pillar Historian. Attaining the One, he became numinous; treading the Five, he was called sagely. Weakness served the Dao, and softness became ultimate strength. Diminishing again and again, he reached augmentation. Like a melon vine, his blessings stretched long, and the source of his prosperity flowed deep.

At the beginning of his reign, he established a sacred altar for offerings. A natural fragrance arose, like mist filling the air; five-colored clouds floated, like a feathered canopy unfurled. In the seventh year, the year *zuo’e*, the month of the Yellow Bell, with the Six Dragons in harmony and the Hundred Officials in attendance, he personally visited the abbey to pay homage to the revered image. Like the Yellow Emperor’s journey to Kongtong or the Divine Farmer’s ascent to the Stone Chamber, he followed the rites of the law, though the eras differed, the pattern remained the same.

The abbey’s director, Ding of Qi Ping, studied the scriptures of refined gold and plumbed the texts of jade tablets. He foresaw the future and concealed the past, exhausting transformations and penetrating the spirit. He discerned heaven’s blessings in advance and aided in the propagation of auspicious fortune. The Dharma Master Lü Daoji and the Fast Supervisor Zhao Daolong—one’s jade vessels were lustrous and moist, the other’s crane-like spirit soared afar. Their eloquence unraveled linked rings, and their words were like roasted cicadas. They expounded the celestial intent, profoundly nourishing the imperial mind. They said: even a single word of small goodness deserves to be inscribed on iron and stone. How much more so when the imperial carriage deigns to visit, bearing libations for the subtle and the minute? The great Dao is the origin of all things, forging the myriad beings in its furnace. Without carving and engraving, how could it cease?

The Minister of State, Duke Chen Shuda of Jiang, was a paragon of the court, his literary talent unmatched. Wielding his mighty brush, he composed an elegant inscription, which read:

*"Vast is the numinous transformation,
Profound is the wondrous gate."*

The form soars through the Nine Palaces, refining qi through the Three Origins. The *Yellow Court’s* secret records and the *Golden Register’s* subtle words remain. Jade Capital preserves its chronicles, the Golden Turtle restores its soul. Dust stirs at the Eastern Sea’s edge, the Dao is sought in the Western Kunlun. The landscape mirrors the Han Pass, its demeanor befits the Pure Temple. At the founding of the standard, layered altars rise like clouded peaks. The brocade well stretches like a rainbow, the wind-window laughs like lightning. The Dark Metropolis holds the true pitch, the Emperor’s Terrace summons immortals. Embracing marrow, they grasp the stars; feeding on dawn’s glow, they draw forth illumination. Vast emptiness dissolves formless shadows, namelessness is the ultimate essential. The high hall has long stood suspended, its pure springs still heal. The heart dwells in noble song, roaming and resting amid all wonders. Verdant cliffs fade into mist, cinnabar orifices drift in the current. The bound grass forms knots, the Zhou plain swells abruptly.

The sagely Dao shall flourish anew, its radiance resplendent. Bright is our sovereign, accumulating virtue and piling up merit. Like clay shaped in the potter’s kiln, like thunder and wind roused by a shout. How can we not measure against the Great Chamber? The rites at Deng Palace were grand indeed. Now, seated in the rightful position, the Dao matches the dark heavens. The four directions look up in reverence, a hundred generations shall exalt this. Boundaries are shown outwardly, yet without thought, restraint comes naturally. Auspicious omens permeate far and wide, propitious signs clarify the sky. A hundred spirits are all in order, a thousand ages shall honor this. The majestic sight of the ancestral Dao, the imperial procession travels the grand thoroughfare. Clouds move along the chariot path, winds sweep the mountain beams. Flying texts harmonize as one, rites connect to the divine sovereign. Five banners turn their heads, six reins move in unison. The imperial ceremony unfolds with reverence, boundless blessings are enjoyed. Towering and high, this stele broadcasts this enduring fragrance.

**Stele of the Venerable Master Yin of Tianshui, Abbot of the Great Tang’s Zongsheng Abbey**

It is said that the Perfected One emerges from the great shell, traverses the leaning pestle, rides the sharp-edged chariot, follows the round enclosure, serves the Thunder Duke, and takes the Secret Consort as his concubine. At dawn, he plucks hair from the scalding springs; by dusk, he dries his head in the sunlit valley. Still, he howls long upon the cinnabar mounds, roams high beneath the jade-green canopy. If one has not planted roots through vast kalpas, reverently serving the Great Vastness before the Golden Chamber, carving the heart upon the Jade Dawn, or leading the Azure Youth to respond to the Yellow Register—how could one achieve the wondrous form of later ages?

To continue the fading light and inherit the rare echo, this is the Venerable Master. The Master’s tabooed name was Wen Cao, his courtesy name Jingxian, a man of Tianshui in Longxi. He was a descendant of Wei, Vice Director of the Chancellery during the Later Qin. As Wei served in Chang’an, the family became residents of Hu. When one considers how he flourished as an imperial preceptor, descending in proximity to the Tang’s meritorious age, or shone as a king’s aide, answering the mandate in the Zhou Wu’s court—his family’s legacy through the generations may be briefly recounted.

His great-grandfather, Hong, served as Prefect of Shangzhou during the Yuwen dynasty. His grandfather, Shu, was Vice Governor of Wenzhou under the Sui. His late father, Zhen, was a Gentleman of the Palace in our imperial court, granted rank for his foresight.

The Venerable Master was uniquely endowed with extraordinary qi, bearing both hidden and manifest splendor. At his impending birth, his mother, Lady Yuan, dreamed of a darkly wondrous jade maiden presenting the talisman of the Nine Elderly Lords. Upon waking, she remembered it and often meditated upon it. Months later, she heard the sound of scripture recitation within her womb, and at times, strange lights encircled her body. When he was first held, his eyes shone brightly, his pupils darting as if perceiving something unseen. Lady Yuan, recalling her dream, saw its signs in his heart and mind but did not speak of it.

When he was old enough to wear proper clothes, he recognized characters on his own, reciting only the *Laozi* and the *Classic of Filial Piety*. He declared: "These two scriptures are the heart of heaven and earth." Thereafter, upon seeing characters related to killing, he recoiled as if stepping into fire or water; upon reading texts lacking propriety, he felt as though plunging into an abyss. As he grew, hearing of the Yin Perfected One’s temple, he devoted himself to its service, distancing himself from worldly affairs. Through reading the *Western Ascension* and *Numinous Treasure* scriptures, he gradually grasped the true teachings. Having tasted their profound flavor, he harmonized with the Yellow Center.

He heard that masters are the parents of those who transmit the Dao, the divine luminaries of those who practice it. Through countless kalpas, wondrous scriptures have emerged. Without learning from a master, one remains in eternal darkness—thus, he was ceaselessly anxious, seeking a teacher without rest. At that time, there was Zhou Fa, the first voice of the inner sound, a high disciple of the Supreme Sovereign. The Master wished to follow his carriage, accompany his shadow, and soar through the void, hastening to pay homage and fulfill his long-held aspiration. Zhou Fa, seeing him, said: "In the kalpa’s assembly, you have already received the register of Tortoise Mountain." He then instructed him in the wondrous principles of the Purple Clouds and transmitted the hidden methods of the Azure Feather. Once these entered his heart, he felt as though he could join Red Pine and Prince Qiao in playing with mist and moonlight.

At fifteen, his Daoist practice was complete, and his name was known far and wide. When Empress Wende followed the supreme radiance and relinquished the central palace, the court sought out Daoist groves and broadly gathered true adepts. The Venerable Master responded to the dark radiance, his conduct joining the green clouds. By imperial decree, he left the household and was assigned to reside at Zongsheng Abbey. Though he trimmed orchids in the jade garden and gathered numinous herbs on the dark peaks, his mind often wandered far beyond, never drawing near to retirement.

He wished to bathe in the Eastern Well, linger in Nanchang, protect Kunlun, and explore the wonders of primordial chaos. Thus, he turned his thoughts to cinnabar mists, roamed his heart through the Purple Capital, traversed the Five Peaks, and fully crossed the Nine Origins. He sought the ancestral qi of the Three Lords and perfected the wisdom eye of the Seven Dawns. Returning to pay homage to Zhou Fa, he settled in Zhongnan. He meditated in silence by the warm springs, concentrated his essence in the cold valleys—years and days passed thus.

Having penetrated the Eight Effulgences and mastered the Nine Heavens, he foresaw the future and concealed the past, gaining many insights. One day, a spirit said: "Zhou Fa has ascended." When he visited his former dwelling, it was already empty. At the end of the Zhenguan era, after completing the mourning rites, in the third year of Yonghui, he traveled to Mount Taibai, entering the Double Mystery. He saw what he had never seen, heard what he had never heard. Thereafter, he mastered the cinnabar characters and purple writings, the methods of the Three and Five in harmonious progression, and the techniques of the Nine and Six in reverse attainment—all their essentials he grasped.

The Venerable Master’s travels to sacred mountains, his prayers and offerings, and the numinous responses he received are recorded elsewhere; they are not included here.

Since the Xianqing era, the state has relied upon him, summoning him to serve within and without the court. He was consulted on virtue and deliberated on matters of governance, saving the world and delivering its people. He turned the sutras and practiced the Dao, presiding over the numinous altars and imperial sanctums, where the Son of Heaven’s words were as those of Heaven itself. From the eastern capital to the western capital, from Shaoyang to Taiyi, across the nine cities and the two Huas, he displayed reverence and extended sincerity for over thirty years. Day after day, month after month, his devotion never ceased, and every resonance was met with response. All his efficacies were known equally to ruler and minister, their exchanges of memorials and replies flowing like the turning of sun and moon. The numinous Dao shone forth, and the accumulated blessings of the years cannot be fully recorded. These are all preserved in the imperial archives; here, only a few essentials are briefly noted.

At first, the Venerable Master ascended the lofty summit of Mount Taibai, where clouds and mist swirled on all sides, and the echoes shook ten thousand ravines. Here, six characters are missing: *#1 rising a thousand fathoms*, there appeared an image suffused with ninefold radiance, its height reaching ten fathoms. Those who joyfully departed for it did so with unwavering resolve.

When Emperor Gaozong was at the Jiucheng Palace, a comet streaked across the heavens, its tail spanning several *zhang*. He asked the Venerable Master about it, who replied: "This is Heaven’s warning to you. If you, as a son, honor your father, and as a ruler, follow Heaven; if you heed remonstrance and summon the worthy, cast aside the perverse and distance the flattering; if you cease corvée and halt military campaigns, take responsibility and strive in conduct to align with Heaven’s will—then it shall vanish in no time." The emperor followed his counsel, and the comet disappeared as predicted.

Thus, Gaozong repurposed the former residence of the Prince of Jin to build the Haotian Abbey for Emperor Taizong, appointing the Venerable Master as its abbot and overseer of its affairs. In the fourth year of the Yifeng era, while the emperor was in the eastern capital, he first invited the Venerable Master to perform meritorious deeds at the Temple of the Venerable Lord. When the emperor himself paid homage, all the officials accompanied him. The emperor, the empress, the princes, and the princesses all witnessed the Venerable Lord riding a white horse, flanked by divine beings beyond description, descending from the sky to the altar. Inside and outside the temple, the people cried out in joy, dancing and prostrating themselves, personally receiving the sacred words. Could this not be the response to the Venerable Master’s sincerity?

Thereupon, by imperial decree, he composed *The Sacred Record of the August Emperor of the Mysterious Origin*, in ten volumes, comprising one hundred and ten chapters, each with its own eulogy. At the time, Yuan Banqian wrote it on the Venerable Master’s behalf. The record and eulogies were transcribed and presented to the throne. Gaozong was greatly pleased, spending entire days poring over it, never setting it aside from his jade table. He then bestowed upon the Venerable Master the title of Grand Master for Splendid Happiness with Silver and Cyan, acting as Minor Director of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices. The Venerable Master firmly declined but, unable to refuse, relinquished his official post and accepted the honorary title.

In the second year of the Yongchun era, as the celestial observances neared completion and the day of the great offering approached, ten thousand chariots rumbled like thunder, and a thousand riders galloped like the wind. The Son of Heaven ascended the elevated passage to mount the imperial carriage, while the officials of the court accompanied the six rites and followed the seven luminaries. They were to pay homage at the Celestial Pivot and visit the Central Marchmount. Yet before the golden cords were raised or the jade seals unveiled, the six dragons halted their reins, and the three luminaries dimmed their light. The emperor’s health faltered, and he returned to the imperial palace.

At that time, the Purple Tenuity was vacant, and the White Clouds ascended on high. The myriad states wailed in lament, and the four directions fell silent. Empress Wu consulted the Venerable Master, who said: "The immortal realms and sacred precincts, too, are subject to the cycles of rise and decline. All things have their flourishing and withering, and *qi* has its beginning and end. This is the constant of the Great Dao. May Your Majesty cherish the divine regalia, dwell in thoughtful seclusion, and contemplate with reverence. Govern the hundred spirits in secret, and nurture the myriad people in hidden ways. Though the civil arts are practiced among men and the affairs of state lie within the heavens, all numinous and luminous responses depend on a hundredfold sincerity in prayer. It is hoped that the twenty-four knots of worry will be burned away by fire, and the seventy-two teachings refined by water, so that all may witness the portents of the past and understand the affairs of the future." Thereupon, he composed *On Dispelling Delusion* in four volumes, *On Dissolving Demons* in thirty volumes, and *The Transmission of the Former Master* in one volume.

In the fourth year of the Chuigong era, as the court prepared to welcome the Jade Emperor, his foremost disciple, Shi Daocheng, wished to submit memorials to extend blessings. The Venerable Master stopped him, saying: "What is in accord should be followed; what is forbidden must not be transgressed." With these words, he passed away, his countenance unchanged.

On the fourteenth day of the fourth month in the fourth year of the Changshou era, he was laid to rest in the Valley of the Literary Immortals on Mount Zhongnan. His disciples, led by Hou Shaowei, longed for the distant past of the Dragon Han era and yearned for the tortoise crags of old. They hoped that his virtuous teachings would endure as long as Heaven and Earth, and that his numinous Dao would transform in harmony with *yin* and *yang*. Thus, they erected this stele of unyielding stone, its inscriptions shining like the three luminaries. The inscription reads:

Gone, O Great Immortal, soaring to the distant Mysterious!
Seated upon the white mushrooms of the Jade Valley, before the purple orchids of the Golden Towers.
Having whistled to the sun upon jade tablets, you now rejoice in the azure springs.
Emerging from the thirty-six thousand *li* of the profound earth,
you enter the thirty-six thousand *li* of the distant heavens.
You chew the emerald chrysanthemums of the ninefold radiance,
and sit upon the five-colored red lotuses.
Ever chanting the *Outer Radiance*, ever grasping the *Inner Chapters*.
Spring’s rosy clouds take flight, autumn’s purple mists arise.
You wander the lofty Yellow Ridge, gaze back upon the peaks of Mount Taibai.
The imperial land of the Three Qins and Four Passes, the Dragon and Phoenix Rivers of Chang’an in Jingzhao.
Resplendent, the path of the Four Clarities!
Vast, the years of the Eight Effulgences!
Now you ascend to inherit the fruits of former ages—
when will you descend to bestow blessings upon the mortal world?
When the *qi* of the Dao prevails, and the flavor of the Dao is transmitted,
it must fill the six directions with misty vapors,
naturally flourishing and enduring through ten thousand kalpas.
I bow my head and sing, stepping through the void,
wishing to ride the ninefold purity.
The world shares this heart—
not only the grove of the soaring one.

Composed by Yuan Banqian, Grand Master for Splendid Happiness with Silver and Cyan, acting as Junior Tutor to the Crown Prince, Academician of the Institute for the Veneration of Literature, Grand Pillar of the State, and Duke of Pingdong County. Erected on the second day of the tenth month in the fifth year of the Kaiyuan era by the disciple Hou Shaowei.

**Stele of the Numinous Response of the Sacred Ancestor, the August Emperor of the Mysterious Origin**

How sublime! The imperial law follows Heaven, and Heaven follows the Dao. Those who occupy the great treasure must honor the ancestors to match Heaven, and all living things dwell in life through the mothering Dao. Thus, the four pillars uphold the state, and the distant teachings of the Mysterious are revered. The Three Sovereigns in Heaven succeed one another in manifesting virtue, and only then do they encompass the realm, illuminating and connecting with the divine. Who could unite the twofold excellence of such mighty deeds and inaugurate the grand transformation of a thousand ages? How brilliantly, how resplendently, it returns to our Tang house!

His Imperial Majesty has received the celestial mandate and ruled the realm for nearly thirty years, his achievements matching Heaven and Earth, his filial piety and sincerity honoring his ancestors. In his loftiness and clarity, he orders the stars and constellations with perfect coherence; in his vastness and depth, he stirs the rivers and seas without spilling a drop. That he should defer to the ancient sages, rectify the rites of the Three Dynasties, mold and shape the ways of Yao and Shun, and refine the cramped customs of Xuan and Yu—these are but incidental accomplishments of His Majesty.

Once, in quietude within the Hall of Manifest Prosperity, he pondered the supreme Dao, for only virtue moves Heaven. In a dream, numinous response was revealed: in a state of indistinct reverie, he perceived something wondrous, subtle yet profoundly connected, truly the bright mandate of the Primordial Ancestor, bestowing an everlasting imperial legacy. Thereupon, he secretly studied the celestial patterns, followed the ancient decrees, and sought far and wide. To the west, his search extended to Mount Taibai; to the east, it reached the lands of E and Du. This place was once called the "Scripture Terrace of the Zhou Historian," nestled in the secluded valleys of Mount Tai. Here, Master Yin first dwelled, gathering the Dharma and establishing the Daoist gate. Later, under the august Tang, the Louguan Abbey was transformed into the Sacred Ancestral Temple. The medicinal well still bubbles, the immortal’s chariot remains—divination confirmed this as the most auspicious site for venerating the Mysterious.

A flying spring sprays from the rocks, dense forests filter the light, moss carpets the secluded ground, and perpetual mist lingers. When clouds disperse in the clear sky, a towering form emerges, radiant with brilliance, casting a white rainbow upon the jade throne and suffusing the immortal realm with purple qi. Upon the emperor’s wise gaze, it appeared just as in his dream.

Ah! The sage perceives the traces of all under Heaven and models them in form; the sage discerns the movements of all under Heaven and observes their convergence—this may be taken as one corner of the truth.

At first, the approach was humble: burning fragrant woods, abstaining from meat and strong flavors, silence reigned, and every gesture followed ritual. Initially, there were no reed mats, only the ascent to the sacred altar. Then came the slow procession on painted litters, a brief rest in the ornate pavilion. The pure breeze whispered through the grasses and trees, and celestial incense wafted through the cliffs and valleys. As the path wound through the verdant wilderness and the wind favored the peaks of Kongtong, cloud-cranes led the imperial carriage, while immortal attendants formed ranks. Nearing the celestial gardens and the gates of the capital, rainbow banners and phoenix flutes heralded the swift journey, as if wind and sea merged. Crimson tassels and feathered canopies stretched like waves and mist. The myriad people craned their necks toward the western city; the hundred officials awaited the imperial procession at the northern gate—how resplendent it was!

His Majesty then ascended the Dew Chamber, honoring his ancestors with filial devotion. He gathered at the Immortal Palace to perform the fast, offering prayers to the Perfect One in the farthest reaches. Before the morning had passed, the Eight Sceneries were traversed; within ten days, the Six Directions were embraced. Thus, the feudal lords danced in celebration of the numinous, raising cups to offer longevity. Banners stood like forests, drums resounded—how magnificent it was!

Alas! The Dao of the Primordial Ancestor pervades and sustains the myriad things, subtly preceding all transformations. The Lord of the Red Pine grasped it and thereby lifted Heaven and Earth; Fuxi attained it and thereby inherited the Mother of Qi. As for the Queen Mother of the West in her jade mountains—compared to this, she is like the ephemeral morning mushroom. The Lady Maigu by the Eastern Sea—compared to this, she is like the summer insect in a drop of water. Liezi riding the wind—his skill is but a speck in the chaff. Wang Qiao controlling the crane—his purity is but a stalk in the weeds. Truly, is this not the supreme Way? Truly, is this not the primordial qi?

Moreover, Heaven has ordained the Tang, storing boundless potential in the northern vault. The more divine the achievement, the greater the response; the more numinous the source, the longer its flow. In the past, when the royal house was on the verge of collapse, we struck like lightning to preserve the state. When the emperor gazed toward the sacred mound, we rode the clouds to announce success. At the Feng and Xu sacrifices by the Fen and Sui rivers, we honored the Son of Heaven as the supreme lord. When the imperial tombs were solemnly adorned, we expounded the scriptures to illuminate filial piety. This may be called reinforcing the pillars of Earth, retying the Mysterious Net, and extending the imperial influence through the ages—all great creations of the imperial ultimate.

In repairing deficient rites, completing musical compositions, preserving simplicity to restrain excess, and training troops to instruct in martial arts; in guiding the four barbarians to return to civilization and appointing the hundred spirits to their offices—how can one exhaustively recount these deeds? Of old, a single benevolent word brought blessings, and a single good deed elicited a response. How much more so when encompassing vast institutions and embracing grand virtues, when the luminous pages of spiritual transformation align with the hidden assistance of the numinous mandate? It is fitting that such boundless blessings should be received.

Princess Yuzhen, the Jade Perfection, endowed with virtue as a celestial descendant and honored as the emperor’s sister, has devoted her heart to this place, transcending worldly attachments. She upholds the Yellow Register with ritual purity and gazes at the white clouds with lofty aspirations. The abbey’s master, Li Xuanze, oversees the fast with Yan Wudai, while the senior disciple transmits the teachings. In learning, they daily increase; in the Dao, they daily diminish. They wander beneath the mountains and forests, roaming beyond the dust and grime. Gathering together, they discussed: "Now, the Dao assists the lord, and the lord assists the people. Below, it extends to the Six Obscurities; above, it harmonizes with the Three Ultimates. Like the ministers Feng and Li, it aids in governing the court; like the *Guanju* and *Lin Zhi*, it permeates the national customs. Auspicious omens accumulate, while inauspicious portents do not arise. This is sufficient to guide ten thousand generations and instruct posterity—how resplendent and majestic, how it manifests the numinous response! Yet, to neglect the duty of praising Lu like Xi Si or inscribing the tripods like Mu and Man—this would obscure Heaven’s blessings above and diminish the minister’s duty below. The thread of ritual would be severed, and we would be remiss in our shame."

Thereupon, the assistant minister Li Silin, equally bearing profound favor and possessing great ability, consulted with scholars to glorify the imperial Dao. At that time, Liu Tongsheng, Director of the Ministry of Revenue from Pei, whose talent was pure and whose drafts were refined, was renowned among the gentlemen of the imperial secretariat. His writings aspired to the grandeur of the Shanglin Park, capable of extolling the emperor’s deeds. Together, they followed the *Greater Ya* and composed these words, offering them as a hymn:

North of Zhongnan lies the Grotto of True Reality,
Where Lord Yin of the Pass once dwelled upon this ridge.
Dark and dense, the pines and cypresses crown the radiant peak,
Grasses weave a flowery tower, dragons guard the well—
The cavern of immortals, solemn and still.

Only the emperor dreamed at night of the True One’s coming,
Divine light blazing, golden and silver terraces.
Jade countenance, graceful as melting ice and snow,
Rainbow robes and feathered chariots swirling in attendance—
The former sage and the latter sage moved in resonance!

The imperial heart reverently sought the Jade Capital,
Princes and ministers all offered their sincerity.
Cloud banners and painted staffs stood in majestic welcome,
Sun and moon shone bright, the luminous qi gleamed—
The True Form came to receive Heaven’s blessings.

The True Form came, and the sage’s longevity was assured,
A thousand springs without end, a hundred fortunes abounding.
The True Form came, and the imperial legacy flourished.

In the distant outskirts, horses were reined in as the realm stood mighty in all directions,
The purple hall spread its seats, fragrant with mist and clouds.

With hands clasped in reverence, heads bowed to the enduring heavens and earth,
The profound and primordial blessing of the Mysterious Origin stretched boundless through the Tang.

Composed by Dai You, Court Gentleman for Scattering and Guardian of the Granary Bureau, and Grand Pillar of the State,
The ode composed by Liu Tongsheng, Court Gentleman for Scattering and Guardian of the Revenue Bureau.
Erected on the fifteenth day of the seventh month in the first year of Tianbao, the year *renwu*.

**Record of the Great Yuan’s Restoration of the Ancient Louguan, the Ancestral Sage Palace**

The Zhongnan Mountains stand as the great bastion of the Central Kingdom. Consulting the ancient classics—the *Book of Documents* of Great Yu and the *Odes* of the *Lesser Elegantiae*—they are all praised therein. They are also called Zhongnan, for they lie at the "mouth of heaven" and stand south of the capital.

Moreover, as the earth’s axis and the heavens’ pillar, they cradle the wandering immortals, embrace the profound and mysterious blessings, where the numinous *qi* stirs, and grasses and trees shimmer with eerie radiance—thus they crown the world’s grotto-heavens. Hence, the grand and expansive Perfected Ones of antiquity roamed and dwelled here, calling it the "Immortal Capital."

The ancient Louguan was the former residence of the Perfected Master Yin, the foremost of Zhongnan’s renowned sites. According to the *Records of the Historian*, during the reign of the Zhou dynasty, the Perfected One built a hut to cultivate the Dao, observing the *qi* and awaiting the true. Soon after, he indeed encountered the Most High Lord Lao, who was invited to this abode. Bowing as a disciple, he purified himself, burned incense, and inquired of the Dao, thereby receiving the *Five Thousand Words* of the *Dao* and *Virtue*. Once the True Scripture was transmitted, the Great Teaching arose therefrom.

Tracing its essence, it is centered on the Great Unity, established upon the Eternal Non-Being. Within, one nurtures with emptiness and tranquility; without, one aids with softness and humility. It guides one to fathom the origins of heaven and earth, to comprehend the end of all things, to abandon cunning and artifice, and to act in harmony with nature. Through it, cultivating the body brings longevity and health; ordering the household brings fortune and prosperity; governing the state and pacifying the world brings peace to the people and enduring blessings. Its principles are simple, its practices easily followed—thus, rulers and lords of every age have revered this Dao and honored this virtue.

King Mu of Zhou personally sought its sacred traces and built a shrine, ordaining seven Daoists, naming it Louguan—marking the beginning of ordaining people and establishing abbeys. The First Emperor, fond of immortals, constructed a Pure Temple here; Emperor Wen of Han, admiring the Yellow and the Old, established a Hall of Abstinence. From the Wei, Jin, Zhou, and Sui dynasties onward, imperial carriages visited in person, or edicts ordered repairs, households were assigned for sweeping, and fields were granted for the sustenance of the Dao.

When the Tang arose, in the third year of Wude, Emperor Gaozu issued an edict renaming Louguan the "Ancestral Sage Abbey." When the Song dynasty flourished, in the first year of Duangong, the abbey’s plaque was bestowed anew as "Following Heaven and Prospering the State." Such is the outline of its veneration through the ages.

As for the descendants of the Mysterious Lineage: some gather as form and disperse as *qi*, sitting yet vanishing; some attain communion with the true and transcendence, ascending or achieving liberation in death; some aided the world with the Dao, serving as imperial teachers; some wielded talismans to subdue demons and relieve the people’s suffering; some established teachings and transformed beings across heaven and earth; some reclined by streams and rinsed with stones, disdaining worldly affairs, holding their conduct in lofty esteem. Perusing the biographies of the former masters, from the patriarchs to the profound and wondrous, such figures have appeared in every generation—thus one knows the source runs deep and the flow long, the immortal lineage unbroken and flourishing.

Since the White Deer ascended to the void and the hills shifted with the ages, though the sacred traces have not faded, their remnants remain discernible. Like a tortoise hastening to the valley, like an overturned bowl upon a table, the ancient hall faintly emerges above the treetops—this is the Terrace of Scripture Transmission. Deep and secluded, vast and open, winding inward and upward—this is the Valley of the Literary Immortal. Gazing upon it, towering and majestic, mist and verdure rise, morning and evening lingering above, where numinous light and precious *qi* flourish—this is the Peak of Elixir Refinement. Holding the water of Heaven’s One, containing inner radiance, exhaling jade nectar, serving the great return of golden liquid—this is the Elixir Well. Encompassing the nine bends, displaying a thousand-year-old visage, unchanging through heat and cold—this is the Cow-Tethering Cypress.

Tradition holds that after Lord Lao ascended, the humble carriage he rode and the mortar he used for medicine were treasured and passed down for over a thousand years. During the Kaiyuan era of the Tang, an edict ordered them brought into the imperial palace, whereupon they vanished. The *Nine Chapters of Guan Yin* were also renowned in antiquity, yet the text was lost to the world. During the Tang and Song, eras of Daoist veneration, edicts repeatedly sought lost texts, but they were never recovered.

In the year *guisi* of the Great Yuan, when governance was pure and canonical teachings flourished, there was Zhang Zhongcai, a feathered guest from Yishui. He obtained this text in Zhejiang and, presenting himself at the master’s seat, offered it—all were astonished and marveled. Alas! The writings of Yin from a thousand years prior returned to the Yin lineage a thousand years later—perhaps heaven prospered this Dao, and this text emerged in accord with the times. If not, how could the convergence be so wondrously precise?

Recently, the Jin heavens lost their reins, and warfare raged; the grand designs of successive dynasties fell to ashes in the kalpa’s fire. When the imperial court pacified and settled the realm, restoring order, the Great Master Qinghe, of true immortal lineage, oversaw the teachings of the world. Ever mindful of the ancestral palace’s ruins, his heart was filled with sorrow. In the year *bingshen*, he journeyed from Yan to Qin, personally performing the sacrificial rites. Elders of virtue from all directions gathered unbidden. Surveying the ruins, only the Three Gates, the Bell Tower, and two pavilions remained. Thus, they resolved to restore it.

At that time, the former Daoist Zhang Zhijian presented a record of its former state. The Great Master deeply pondered the hidden numerology, discerning men’s hearts beyond their words and expressions. Turning to the True Man of Shared Dust, Lord Li, he said: "The ancestral Dao revives, and the mysterious work endures. To continue and restore it, you should not lag behind."

Thus, he entrusted the affairs of the abbey to Lord Li, who declined for lack of ability but, unable to refuse the command, accepted. He then invited Minister Tian Xiangjun of the Provincial Administration and Magistrate Liu Deshan of Qian Prefecture to serve as patrons of merit. Following the documents of the former General Office, they reclaimed the abbey’s original lands, clearly demarcating its four boundaries to establish permanent endowments for the sustenance of the community.

Thereupon, Lord Li led a thousand disciples. Entrusted by the Great Master with the oversight of the project were Senior Masters Han Zhiyuan and Zhang Zhipu. Together, they cleared brambles and thorns, removed broken tiles and beams, transported timber and planted pillars. Those who cut, those who molded clay, those who designed and constructed, and those who tilled the soil to provide sustenance—all exerted themselves with unwavering devotion. Months passed into years, yet their zeal remained unflagging. By the year *renyin*, the work was gradually brought into order.

Three halls were built: the Golden Portico of the Vast Yang, the Hall of Primordial Beginning, and the Hall of the Lineage Ancestors of the Mysterious Gate. Three towers were erected: the Tower of Purple Clouds Spreading Blessings, the Tower of Radiant Yang, and the Tower of Treasured Scriptures. Two halls were constructed: the Hall of the True Officials and the Hall of Purified Hearts. There were guest lodgings, quarters for the community, chambers for chanting and scripture recitation, as well as mountain gates, scripture repositories, kitchens, storehouses, vegetable gardens, and water channels. Even the subordinate cloisters and separate estates were completed in due order. Adorned with cinnabar, whitewash, and painted decorations, the abbey shone anew. Its scale was vast, its completion swift—turning the celestial pivot, revolving the earth’s axis, outshining sun and moon, and leveling the Northern Dipper. Truly, its power was great!

From this, we see that without the Pure Harmony Master, the Shared Dust True Man could not have been known; without the Shared Dust True Man, this task could not have been accomplished. Thus, the saying arose in that era: "Yin and Li—an immortal bond across past and present." This was no mere coincidence.

In the summer of the sixth month of the first year of the *Zhongtong* era, by imperial decree, the abbey was elevated to the status of a palace, retaining its ancient name of *Zongsheng*. A grand purification rite was held to consecrate it.

Lord Li’s disciples, Director Cheng Zhiyuan and Abbey Steward Shi Zhi’an, among others, remarked: "Since the Zhou dynasty, this palace has been revered and rebuilt by successive dynasties. Some of its history is recorded in annals, others inscribed on steles—its legacy has already been passed down endlessly. Yet the magnificent achievement of our master’s restoration remains unrecorded for posterity. We, his disciples numbering nearly three thousand, would fail in our duty to his virtue if we did not act." Thus, they documented the entire affair and journeyed to the Changchun Palace in Yan to request a record from the Master of Teachings, the Perfected One of Sincerity and Illumination.

As I was commanded to refine the text, and considering my advanced age and long disuse of brush and ink, I deemed it impossible to refuse. Therefore, I examined the submitted account, collated it with the steles of past dynasties, and compiled this record accordingly.

Lord Li’s name was Zhirou, styled Qian Shu. His family had long been stewards of waterways. His father, Zhiwei, had always favored tranquility and had once served the Perfected One Li of Kai Xuan, studying the Complete Perfection teachings. When Lord Li came of age, he too joined the ranks of disciples. The Perfected One of Kai Xuan, recognizing his exceptional perceptiveness of *qi*, often instructed him in the foundational and profound aspects of the Dao. Lord Li, in turn, grasped these teachings with heart and spirit. One day, his temperament transformed, and his progress became as swift as a thousand *li* in a single day. His elder brother Zhi Yi and younger brothers Zhi Zang and Zhi Yong all followed him in study. Initially, he secluded himself for a decade in the mountains of Xian Weng and Guang Yang. Upon hearing that the Great Master Changchun had received an imperial summons to journey south, he traveled to Yan Mountain to pay homage. The secret locks of the Mysterious Pass yielded effortlessly before him. Thereafter, his reputation in the Dao grew ever greater, his name reaching the imperial court. He was bestowed the title *Hong Miao Zhen Ren of Shared Dust* and granted a golden crown and brocade robes. Across the land, he established nearly three hundred sites—palaces, abbeys, and hermitages—yet all took this palace as their guiding north star. Thus, on the day construction began, disciples from thousands of *li* away hastened to serve, laboring diligently lest they fall behind. It was for this reason that the work was completed with such speed.

Although the restoration of this palace may seem the work of celestial timing and the cyclical return of the Dao, let us reflect on its deeper significance. Here, the Primordial Lord of the Mysterious and the Perfected One of Primordial Beginning once met, unlocking the mechanism of precelestial truth and opening the gate of myriad wonders. The transmission of the Two Scriptures gave rise to the flourishing of the teachings. Yet as the ages declined, those who transmitted the Dao diverged. First, it transformed into the elixirs and medicines of Qin and Han; then, into the empty mysteries of Wei and Jin; and later, into the exorcisms and talismans of Sui and Tang. Countless minor arts and fragmented doctrines emerged, relegating the five-thousand-word *Xuan* teachings to dusty shelves as useless relics.

At the beginning of the *Dading* era of the Jin, the Patriarch Chong Yang emerged, proclaiming the teachings of virtue, nature, and destiny as the Complete Perfection tradition. He swept away the corruptions of a hundred schools and revived the lost learning of a thousand years, and the world turned to him in unison. At the dawn of our sagely dynasty, his eminent disciple Qiu Changchun was summoned to the imperial court. In the manner of the dialogue at Guangcheng, his responses aligned perfectly with the imperial will, and he was received with the highest honors. Entrusted with the governance of the Daoist teachings, he was revered as a master even by kings, nobles, and high officials. Thus, the teachings of the Primordial Lord spread like thunder and lightning, illuminating the seas and lands. From the three eastern provinces to the relay stations of the ten thousand *li*, there was nowhere the Mysterious Learning did not flourish, with master and disciple transmitting the teachings. The prosperity of the Dao in this era was unmatched since the beginning of time.

Now, the old has been renewed, and the cauldron reforged. Is this merely the restoration of one ancient abbey? No—for the people have returned to their homes, and palaces of jade gleam in every direction. It is as if the myriad abbeys of the world have been made anew! Ah, could this have been achieved without the return of celestial timing and the Dao?

I have thus recounted these events in detail, that future scholars may observe, reflect, and take heed. Here ends the record.

**Preface to the Postscript of *Guan Yinzi* in the Ancient Abbey of Mount Zhongnan**

The teachings of the Primordial Unity (混元) spread their profound virtue and transformative power across the world. Tracing their sacred origins, the transmission of the Two Scriptures (二经) began upon this mountain, as radiant as the sun rising over the isles. Their light illumined all nations, just as the Yangtze flows from Kunlun to swallow a hundred rivers.

Yet the *Daodejing* (道德) distilled its essence into five thousand characters, while *Wenshi* (文始) expanded its scope with nine chapters. Was this not the fulfillment of teachings received in person but never before committed to writing? Thus, the text was divided into chapters, its breadth and depth perfected to achieve its grand synthesis.

Viewed today, it encompasses the learning of the Three Teachings (三氏)—reason, nature, and destiny—without omission. Yet later generations, monopolizing sectarian traditions, found it difficult to master in full. Some strained over commentaries, losing sight of the whole, for nothing compares to studying the original text itself.

Though the chapters bear titles, the sections within do not. Here, I have extracted key phrases as headings to guide readers, though some may criticize this as a departure from antiquity. The *Dragon Classic* (龙经) consists of only two scrolls, yet Lord He (河公) annotated it with eighty-one divisions, each given a name. Later generations followed this practice without abandon, for it brought convenience without harm—adapting the Way to modern needs.

Now, with chapters titled, pronunciations glossed, and punctuation added, the text is carved into wood to preserve its transmission. For students, there is no need to leave their seats; by diligent study, they will find more than enough guidance. How does this differ from receiving the teachings face-to-face from the sacred Perfected Ones upon this mountain? Those with aspiration, take heed.

**Postscript to the *Map of the Ancestral Abbey of the Ancient Abbey of Mount Zhongnan***

Of all the majestic landscapes under heaven, the grandest in command is Chang’an. Within Chang’an, the most imposing terrain is Mount Zhongnan. And among Zhongnan’s renowned sites, none surpasses the Abbey of the Towering View (楼观).

This abbey was the former residence of the Perfected One, Master Yin (尹氏), where the Most High Lord Lao (太上老君) expounded the *Daodejing*. From its beginnings as a thatched tower for observing the stars and qi, the encounter of the sacred and the Perfected, and the propagation of scriptural teachings, the learning of the Daoist school spread like wind across the world, flowing like water through the earth.

Since the Zhou dynasty, it has endured countless upheavals, yet as the very root of the teaching, it has repeatedly declined and revived. Recently, it fell into ruin during the late Jin era. At the founding of our dynasty, the Venerable Master Tongchen (同尘真人), by command of the Great Patriarch Qinghe (清和大宗师), devoted himself to its restoration. Before long, towers and halls soared into the sky, their gold and azure dazzling the eye. The ancient abbey, a thousand years old, was restored in a single stroke. The grasses and trees seemed to glow, the mists and clouds took on new hues, and Mount Zhongnan grew more resplendent while the Wei River shone brighter.

Of all the grand abbeys and magnificent vistas in the world, this is where the foundation was laid. Of all the sacred traces and immortal footprints across the land, this is where the Most High inaugurated the teaching. In time, it has no predecessor; in dignity, none surpasses it. Thus, emperors have paid homage countless times, and imperial edicts have repeatedly ordered its repair—all for good reason.

Examining the biographies of past masters, those who ascended as immortals or attained the Dao have emerged from this place in every age. This abbey is the source of the Dao, the ancestor of immortality, the root of the teaching. When its influence waned, it was revitalized; when its light dimmed, it shone anew. As the ancients said, *"The primordial qi of Zhongnan never dies"*—a most earnest truth.

Now that the reconstruction is complete, I have compared the old and new maps of the abbey from former dynasties, revised and re-engraved them in stone, so that Daoist scholars from all directions may study antiquity and know their origins.

**Stele Inscription on the Daoist Conduct of the Perfected One Yin, Great Patriarch Qinghe**

In the twenty-seventh year of *Zhiyuan*, the Perfected One Zhang Yuanyi (张玄逸真人), who oversees the Daoist teachings of the Mysterious Gate (玄门), was dispatched by imperial command to perform rites at the sacred mountains and rivers. Traveling by post-horse to Qin, he offered incense at the Ancestral Abbey of the Ancient Abbey of Mount Zhongnan to honor the ancestral Dao.

After the rites, he surveyed the mountain’s numinous landscapes, the towering halls and lofty pavilions, and reflected on the transmission of the teachings by the Primordial Lord Wenshi (玄元文始) from the time of their inception to the present—over two thousand four hundred years. Though the abbey has known rise and fall, the forest of the Dao has flourished without end, and the lineage of immortals has been unbroken. Now, it has been revived once more by the two Perfected Ones, Qinghe and Tongchen, giving rise to the saying, *"The ancient and modern immortal bond of Yin and Li"*—a truly flourishing affair.

The conduct of these two masters is well known, yet without inscription in metal and stone, their legacy cannot endure. For Tongchen, there is already the inscription by the Perfected One Tianle (天乐真人), engraved in stone. As for Qinghe’s stele, its text has been lost to time, leaving a regrettable void—an oversight of those who succeeded him in the teaching.

Thus, he commanded the Supervisors Nie Zhizhen and Zhao Zhixuan to compile the master’s biography and collect the ancient and modern stele inscriptions of the Abbey of the Towering View, commissioning Jia Yu of Luxi to compose the text. Though Jia declined, he was unable to refuse and proceeded to arrange the events in order.

The master’s personal name was *Zhiping* (志平), his courtesy name *Dahe* (大和), and his surname *Yin* (尹). He was the patriarch of the Quanzhen lineage. His family had long resided in Cangzhou, and during the former Song, one ancestor served in Laizhou, settling there. His great-grandfather and forebears, seven in total, were Confucian scholars who passed the imperial examinations and served as prefectural governors.

The master’s grandfather, Gongzhi, and his father, Hongyi, both concealed their brilliance and did not enter official service.

Born in the ninth year of the Dading era of the Jin dynasty (1169), on the twentieth day of the first month, the master possessed innate wisdom from a past life. At just three years of age, he could recall ancient matters. By five, he entered school and recited a thousand words daily. At fourteen, he encountered the Perfected One of Danyang and immediately wished to abandon his family to enter the Dao. His parents resisted, and after three rounds of persuasion, they finally permitted him to follow his aspiration.

Initially, he resided in a hut in Changyi, where he dreamed of the Perfected One Liu of Longevity, who severed his head and hollowed his heart, granting him profound understanding. Later, he established an abbey at Qixia and attended the Perfected One Qiu of Everlasting Spring, who whispered esoteric teachings into his ear, entrusting him with subtle words. He further studied the *Book of Changes* under the Great Ancient One and received the *Discourses* from the Perfected One of Jade Yang. The true principles merged within him, and the radiance of his heart shone brightly. From then on, his reputation in the Dao grew daily, and he became a model for scholars.

In the year *jimao* (1219), the August Emperor Taizu specially issued an edict summoning the Perfected One of Everlasting Spring from the seaside. Selecting eighteen virtuous masters to assist him, the master was foremost among them. When he met the Emperor on the sunny side of the Snow Mountains in the Western Regions, the throne was left vacant for him to expound the supreme Dao. He responded with the essentials of cultivating the self through few desires, the methods of cherishing the people and perpetuating the state, and the Heavenly intent of loving life and detesting killing. The Emperor praised and accepted his words, bestowing upon him the highest favor and entrusting him with oversight of the teachings throughout the realm. Thus, the mystic wind spread widely, and the entire world revered him.

In the year *yiyou* (1225), he returned to Yan and was ordered by imperial decree to reside at the Palace of the Supreme Ultimate—now known as the Palace of Everlasting Spring. Beneath his seat, those who came to pay homage from all directions gathered like clouds. The master said, "I have no merit or virtue; how dare I accept such offerings?" He then retreated to the Abbey of Dragon Yang in Dexing, where he remained for two years. The Perfected One of Everlasting Spring sent six personal letters, expressing his reliance on the master.

After the Perfected One of Everlasting Spring ascended to immortality, the community urgently requested the master to assume leadership of the teachings. He fled to the Eastern Mountains but, pressed by his colleagues, could not refuse and eventually consented. In his governance of the teachings, he was solemn and harmonious, his Dao-transformations pure and unforced. Without decrees or laws, people naturally encouraged one another. Those who assisted him in the teaching seat were eminent scholars, linked like pearls. The abbeys and palaces of the Dao stood like stars across the land, and even in the mountains, forests, and valleys, hundreds and thousands of dwellings arose. Living on wild plants and drinking from streams, they embodied the spirit of the ancient hermits Chao and Xu. Even the young woodcutters and water-drawers advanced in virtue and discussed the nature of the Dao, never speaking falsely. The flourishing of the teaching’s influence was unmatched since the Three Dynasties.

The master attributed the success of his Dao-transformations to Chongyang and continued the legacy of his predecessors, his heart ever devoted to the Abbey of the Towering View. He was deeply committed to both. When Tian Xiangjun, the provincial administrator of Jingzhao, sent an urgent petition, it aligned with the master’s own wishes. In the spring of *bingshen* (1236), he traveled from Yan to Qin, performing rites at the ancestral palace. Yet the sacred halls and secret chambers had been reduced to ashes by the upheavals of the Tianxing era. All around was desolation, save for the lingering spirit of the mountains and rivers.

Daoist companions from all directions came bearing provisions to follow him. A former Daoist, Zhang Zhijian, described the abbey’s former state and requested the master to take charge, also entreating him to undertake its reconstruction. The master selected from among the worthy and chose the Perfected One Li of Shared Dust, whose earnestness and aspiration were universally acknowledged. He entrusted Li with the affairs of the abbey and the responsibility of its restoration. Thus, plans were laid, and construction commenced on a grand scale. Soon, halls and pavilions gleamed resplendently, vast and towering, drawing admiration from all who beheld them.

When the imperial court, through the Minister Yang, summoned the master’s divine carriage back to Yan, by the spring of *wuxu* (1238), the master calmly addressed his followers: "I am old and should withdraw from labor to seek ease, gathering with the venerable elders." He personally wrote a letter entrusting the Perfected One Li of True Constancy to succeed him in the teaching and built the Abbey of Pure Harmony on Mount Dafang as his retreat.

In the year *gengzi* (1240), he was invited to oversee the burial rites at the ancestral court of Chongyang. He went gladly. Along the roads he traveled, those who set out incense and flowers to welcome and bow to him numbered in the thousands daily. Offerings piled up like mountains, yet he paid them no heed.

As the year suffered drought and the prayers of the people went unanswered, all declared: "When the master arrives, the harmonious qi will surely respond." No sooner had he alighted from his carriage than rain fell.

At that time, the western regions of Shaan had just been pacified, and the assembly of mourners—both clergy and laity—numbered in the tens of thousands. Rumors swirled tumultuously, but by the master’s stabilizing presence, the rites were completed without incident. Once the affairs were concluded, he returned to the Louguan Abbey, where he dwelt in carefree leisure, his spirit wandering in serene detachment. He would ascend the terrace to contemplate antiquity, occasionally composing verses in song. One such poem read:

*"In Zhou’s rise, recluses flourished;
In Tang’s age, masters were revered.
The ancestral temple stood in ancient Louguan—
Now Pure Harmony inherits its Way."*

From this verse, one may glimpse the weight of his self-imposed duty.

The following year, he returned to Yan. Before long, he instructed his attendants to sweep and purify the meditation chamber of Pure Harmony. The next day, upon arriving at the abbey and completing the rites to the sages, he kindled incense, brewed tea, and sat upright to discourse on the Dao. At midnight, he adjusted his robes and cap, bent his arm as a pillow, and passed away—this on the sixth day of the second lunar month in the year *xinhai* (1251).

At that moment, an extraordinary fragrance filled the courtyard, lingering for days without dissipating. When the news spread, those nearby wailed in grief, while those from afar hastened to arrive, mourning as though for their own parents. Initially, he had left instructions to be buried on Mount Dafang, but at the people’s request, he was interred at Mount Wuhua instead. He was eighty-three years of age.

His writings include the *Baoguang Collection* of teachings, and his discourses are recorded in the *Northern Travel Record*. In the year *xinyou* (1261), an imperial edict posthumously bestowed upon him the title "Perfected One of Pure Harmony, Wondrous Dao, and Vast Transformation." His lifelong conduct and virtues are fully documented in the *Golden Lotus Record*, as well as in the steles erected at the Chongyang and Wuhua abbeys. Here, we have merely chronicled the essentials of his renovation of the ancestral temple, his illumination of the ancestral Dao, and the arc of his life’s work.

Alas! The master’s supreme virtue is too profound for words—we have but touched upon one or two of its most manifest wonders.

In ancient times, when the Mysterious Origin (Laozi) journeyed westward, he bequeathed two scriptures to awaken all generations—thus, the one who transmitted his Dao and inaugurated his lineage was Yin Wenshi. When Changchun (Qiu Chuji) later journeyed north to meet the emperor, he offered subtle teachings to revive the Six Directions; yet the one who inherited his virtue and expanded his teachings was Yin Qinghe.

Alas! The former sage and the later perfected one both emerged from the same clan, their Dao aligned and their virtue harmonized—how could this resemblance be mere coincidence?

I have heard that the *Nine Chapters of Guan Yin* were composed by Wenshi, a text known in the world yet no longer seen. Though Bi Xu’s scholarship was vast, he mistakenly identified the *Western Ascension* and the two *Zhenghe* edicts as the lost work. Despite exhaustive searches through Daoist texts, it remained unobtainable.

In the year *guisi* (1253), a traveler arrived from Zhe, presenting a copy of the *Guan Yinzi*. Its words resonated with the imperial will, and all who read it were astonished. Upon inquiry, he explained: "At first, the scholar Sun Ding discovered it in the mountains of Yongjia—much like Li Quan finding the *Classic of the Hidden Talisman* on Mount Song."

Alas! That the writings of Yin from a thousand years past should be entrusted to a descendant of Yin a thousand years later—suddenly appearing in perfect accord, as if a mustard seed alighting upon a needle’s point. From this, we may see how conspicuously Heaven has favored the Yin clan!

Moreover, since Master Wen’s time at Louguan, among the Yin clan’s descendants, those who ascended as immortals have appeared in every generation. In the Zhou dynasty, there was Gui; in the Qin, Cheng; in the Wei, Lingjian; in the Tang, Wencao; and in the present age, Qinghe. The wellspring of transcendence flows ever deeper, the lineage of immortals ever longer. Judging by these three signs, how abundantly Heaven has blessed the Yin clan!

Ah, how extraordinary!

In the year *dunzang* (1258), during the month of *Dayu*, on the full moon, Jia Yu, Professor of Confucian Studies in the Anxi Circuit, composed this.

**Rhapsody on Master Guan Yin, Presented to the Grand Master Qinghe Upon His Return to Louguan**

The rumble of chariots echoes, the green ox pants,
Having surmounted the ten thousand perils of Xiaohan.
The radiant sun ascends between purple and emerald peaks,
Frost seals the pass gates, yet dawn’s bars remain unopened.
The gatekeeper, Lord Yin, bears a spirit of crystalline purity,
His crimson robes and towering cap like sun and stars.
At midnight, the tortoise-shell divination reveals an omen—
He knows an extraordinary man shall pass this way.

Within the chariot, the Old Master sits stiffly bound,
His golden voice and jade-like countenance, hair like yellowed silk.
He expounds for me on the heart of Heaven,
Discarding the body’s form, casting off honor and disgrace.
Fierce as seven tigers devouring one another,
Blood and flesh spill, sun and stars dim.
The Flowing Sands drift westward, the Weak Waters weaken,
Turning into the Congling range, crossing beyond Kunlun.
Withered stumps howl in the wind as evening mist rises,
His body, light as a flying swan, traverses ten thousand miles.
With a single gesture, he rights the Nine Cauldrons of Heaven,
The cosmos restored to clarity and peace by his singular power.
The old immortal’s transformations are like the dragon’s—
Mending the great earth, reclaiming primordial merit.
Once he departs into the azure void, he never returns,
While Lord Yin, too, ages, bound to the eastern slopes of Zhongnan.
Zhongnan looms high, brushing the Milky Way’s course,
As he ascends, the radiant heavens part at a wave of his hand.
The sky is empty, the moon pale, wind and dew crystalline,
He weaves grass into a tower near the Oxherd and Dipper stars.
How grand, the distant descendant of the Earl of the East!
Ever fearful he might take flight and become a star.
The purple-sealed carriage, drawn by the green-eared steed,
The Longchun Palace’s spring endures as long as spring itself.
Rainbow banners and leopard-trimmed regalia gleam in profusion,
The Old Man sings and shouts with joy as he turns the chariot’s pole.

Who could know that the present-day Elder Qinghe
Is none other than the former Gatekeeper of the Pass?

Composed by Zhao Fu, styled Renfu, of Yunmeng.

**Stele Inscription for the Virtuous Conduct of Master Li, Director of the Great Yuan’s Zongsheng Palace**

The Master’s surname was Li, his given name Zhirou, and his courtesy name Qianshu. His ancestor was the Great Yu, who tamed the floods.

The family’s livelihood was rooted in farming and sericulture, renowned in their village for their pure and honorable lineage. Among four brothers, the Master was the second-born. From birth, he possessed innate wisdom, and as he grew, he developed a profound love for forests and springs, his spirit untouched by worldly dust. His father, Zhiwei, had long been devoted to the study of the mysterious, having first followed Master Li, a senior disciple of the Great Ancient under Zhao Prefecture’s Lincheng County and an Initiate of the Mysterious (Kaixuan Zhenren), to receive the teachings of the Quanzhen tradition. After mastering the Way, Zhiwei’s conduct was revered, and his poems and songs deeply resonated with the profound principles of the Dao. In the year Taihe Xinyou (1201), the Master also served under Kaixuan, observing the rites of a disciple, diligently attending to his duties over many years. Kaixuan recognized him as a vessel worthy of the Dao, entrusting him with esoteric truths and secret instructions without reservation. Once the Master received this guidance, his cultivation and refinement grew ever more rigorous. While begging for alms in Xing Prefecture, though he might go days without food, his resolve never wavered. Later, he retreated to the mountains of Xianweng and Guangyang, severing all worldly ties for twelve years. His mind and surroundings became empty and luminous, and the myriad principles shone through with perfect clarity.

Thereafter, both Kaixuan and Zhiwei transcended the mortal realm. His elder brother, Zhiduan, and younger brothers, Zhizang and Zhiyong, all followed the Master’s path, for they esteemed the Dao above all. When bandits arose in the Western Mountains, he relocated to Xingtai, where he built the Tongzhen Abbey as his residence. His reputation in the Dao flourished day by day, and those near and far who admired him, wishing to become his disciples, filled the courtyard with their shoes. In the spring of Gengchen (1220), hearing that the Venerable Changchun had risen to prominence in the coastal regions and was passing through Yan and Zhao on his journey, the Master prepared gifts to see him off. By the eighth month of Guiwei (1223), when Changchun received the imperial summons to travel south, the Master again drew near to him at the Chaoyuan Abbey in Xuande. Changchun, a paragon of virtue and a revered elder, bestowed upon him the title *Tongchenzi* ("One Who Moves with the Dust") and charged him with establishing abbeys, guiding disciples, receiving and escorting visitors, and spreading the teachings as his primary duties. The Master reverently adhered to these sacred instructions. Thus, he first built the Changchun Abbey in Zhangchuan, and later established the Fengtian and Qizhen Abbeys in Daming.

In Bingxu (1226), he journeyed to Yan to pay respects at the Baoxuan Hall. The following autumn, when Changchun returned to the True, the Master took up his staff and sandals to return south. Those drawn to his teachings multiplied, and abbeys arose in succession: Shenxiao in Cizhou, Qingxu in Xiang, Tianping in Linlü, Datong in Guangzong, and Dongzhen in Yan. His disciples across the land built nearly three hundred large and small hermitages, and the number of Daoists he transformed and guided was commensurate. In Bingshen (1236), the Great Master Qinghe traveled from Yan to Qin, paying homage at the ancestral abbey. The Master accompanied him on this journey, whereupon the Zongsheng Daoist Zhang Zhijian, noting that the ruins of the site—where the Dao Ancestor Laozi expounded the sacred traces of the *Dao* and *Virtue*—had been ravaged by the Tianxing rebellion and nearly destroyed, submitted a petition to the Great Master, beseeching him to devise a plan for reconstruction. The Great Master reflected, *"Without the cinnabar mountain, how can the colorful phoenix perch? Only with a capable man can the great fish be sated."* He then entrusted the petition to the Master, charging him with the responsibility. The Master accepted the command and led his disciples to clear the brambles, mold tiles and bricks, and oversee the construction day by day, gradually restoring order.

In the winter of Dingyou (1237), the True Constant Master appointed the Master as *Tidian* (Supervisor) of the Teachings in the Daming, Xing, and Luo regions, and conferred upon him the title *Qingzhen Dashi* ("Pure and True Great Master"), dispatching him to travel between Qin, Wei, and Zhao to manage the affairs. Within a decade, towering pavilions and magnificent abbeys stood anew. In Gengxu (1250), Shi Demu, the governor of Luozhou, admired the Master’s name and virtue, and submitted a memorial to the throne, resulting in the bestowal of a golden crown and robes, along with the elevated title *Tongchen Hongmiao Zhenren* ("Perfected One of Vast Mystery Who Moves with the Dust").

In the spring of Jiayin (1254), an imperial edict commanded the Great Changchun Abbey in Yan to conduct a grand universal offering. The Master was selected among the eminent Daoists to participate. Upon the completion of the rites, he lingered among the abbeys of Xing and Gu, repairing those that remained unfinished. In the year Guihai of the Zhongtong era (1263), the Illuminated and True Master ordered him to oversee the restoration of the Louguan Abbey. Whatever was lacking or incomplete, he ensured was fully adorned. Though it did not yet match the grandeur of former times, the halls and pavilions that were completed surpassed them in splendor and magnificence.

At the beginning of the Zhiyuan era (1264), an imperial decree forbade commoners from encroaching upon the abbey and prohibited officials, soldiers, and travelers from lodging there, to facilitate undisturbed recitation and ritual. In the summer of the third year, Bingyin (1266), on the second day of the sixth month, the Master bathed and composed himself as if in ordinary times. Gathering his disciples before him, he exhorted them to keep the cultivation of the self and the benefit of others as their constant aspiration, and designated his successor, the disciple Shi Zhijian, to take charge of future affairs. The following day, he peacefully transcended, having lived seventy-eight years. At the moment of his passing, residents of Beijiao Lane in the northern district witnessed five-colored clouds floating in the empty sky, accompanied by the clear resonance of celestial music. Rushing to the scene, they beheld the Master ascending. Though the summer heat was scorching, his complexion remained as if alive.

The ritual offerings continued for three days. His remains were temporarily interred in the meditation chamber where he had resided. After the rites concluded, messengers were dispatched to announce his passing to the disciples at the Eastern Gate of the mountain. Suddenly, one day, at the Fengtian Palace in Daming, the keeper of the sacred cranes saw one of the birds take flight with a resonant cry, descending from the altar hall. All eyes turned upward, and in an instant, the news of his death arrived. Those who understood took this as a sign of the Master’s spiritual journey.

Four years later, in the year Gengwu (1270), the elder disciples of his lineage chose the Clear and Bright Festival to inter him at the Immortal’s Abode Hall within the Huiling Temple southeast of the official precincts.

The Master was of pure and unblemished nature, sitting in solemn stillness throughout the day. His presence was imposing, as if untouchable. Yet when he engaged with others, he taught tirelessly, imparting the secrets of conserving qi and treasuring the spirit. In his teachings, he always placed others before himself, guiding them according to their capacity with the principles of sin and blessing. Wherever he went, the powerful and the common folk alike bowed in reverence, facing north to honor him. If not for the profound sincerity that resonated with the ancient teachings of the Louguan and the Purple Clouds, how could such virtue have taken root?

As one who once enjoyed the Master’s favor, when his disciple Shi Zhijian later recounted the broad outlines of his life and earnestly requested an inscription for the stele, I could not refuse out of respect for the Master’s Dao. Thus, I record these facts as they were.

**Inscription:**
The subtle and wondrous Dao of the Recluse is beyond words,
Yet where sincerity moves, the Way is made clear.
There was a man whose innate wisdom overflowed,
A true heir of the Mystery, kin to Master Tongchen.
In youth, his brilliance broke free from the cage,
Compassionate, pure, frugal, and ever humble.
Tiger and dragon met in his Complete Perfection practice,
Refining body and flesh until all merged as one.
His name spread across Ji, Tai, and Song,
Wherever he went, seekers came to learn.
Westward to the tide, eastward to the dawn, he revived the lineage’s wind,
Adapting to each, he opened the eyes of the blind.
At the thatched hut, ashes flew—his divine work,
Jade altars and sacred halls rose in splendor.
Retiring in leisure, his virtue only grew,
A century’s weariness, and he soared to the void.
His radiance endures, though his form is gone,
I carve this inscription to grace the jade hall.
High heaven and deep earth share its beginning and end.

**Composed by Li Daoqian, Preceptor of Daoism for the Five Routes of Shaanxi and the Four Circuits of Xishu, the Illuminated, Cultivated, and Tranquil Celestial Music Perfected One.**
**Recorded by the Ancient Louguan’s Ox-Slaughtering Cypress.**

Amidst the great transformation, humans and things alike abide,
Their nature one and the same.
Yet when observed through form and qi,
Differences arise—some upright, some slanted, some free, some obstructed.
As for their nature of talent or lack thereof,
And their fate of encounter or solitude,
Whether moving or still,
They are never truly distinct.

Consider the life of trees:
Some wither as saplings, some perish in youth,
Some grow ten spans thick yet serve no purpose.
One may become a sacred vessel,
Another a broken stump in a ditch.
Their fates—longevity or early death, nobility or lowliness—vary so widely,
Could this not be the decree of Heaven?

Now, at Louguan, there stands an ox-tethering cypress.
Beholding it, one’s faith in such truths only deepens.
In the age of the Zhou, when our Mysterious Origin Dao Ancestor
Prepared to cross the pass and journey afar,
The Perfected Elder Wen Shi, having purified himself in fasting,
Welcomed him to this abode to inquire of the Dao.
He once harnessed his cart-ox to this very cypress.
Now, two thousand four hundred years have passed,
Yet its verdant form remains unharmed.
Ah, how extraordinary!

I have heard that the Great Potter shapes all things,
Neither favoring the grain nor scorning the chaff.
The sage’s boundless love makes no distinction
Between the noble and the base, the wise and the foolish.
With impartial gaze and shared principle,
All are treated as one.
Yet here, while others wither and fade,
This tree alone remains evergreen.
Is its singular fate due to Heaven’s special favor?
Or does it harbor pure qi, store primordial essence,
And possess roots so deep?
Is it guarded by numinous spirits?
Or does it thrive beneath the presence of the sacred,
Bathed in the radiance of virtue and the Dao,
Reaping benefits beyond measure?
All this lies beyond mortal comprehension.

Yet I have sought to describe its form:
Lofty as an unfurled canopy,
Lush as clouds overhead,
Sinuous as a dragon’s ascent,
Swift as a galloping steed.
Sharp as a horn,
Curved as an elbow.
Now scaled like a dragon,
Now maned like a lion,
Now coiled, now stretched,
Now gone, now returned,
Now towering, now overturned.
Its ancient bones resist decay, hard as iron and stone,
While pure winds arrive, and the zither and flute resound of their own accord.
No white cranes alight—who then shares its secluded integrity?
Frost’s cruelty and snow’s tyranny—what can they do?

Alas!
The pines of other mountains have withered through countless lives,
Yet this lone root stands firm, unyielding.
The vermilion and gold of halls and eaves have turned to ash through kalpas,
Yet its verdant shade endures.
The people of that time—children begot children, generations uncounted—
Have all passed,
While this verdant sentinel stands unchanged.
Markets and courts have shifted countless times,
Mountains and rivers, peaks and valleys have transformed,
Yet its noble integrity remains unaltered.
Though ages may be tallied,
Who can fathom the limit of its longevity?
Since the White Deer ascended to the void,
All that remains of the past are mere names—
This alone is the old family’s heirloom, the green felt of antiquity.
Thus, it has been treasured through the ages as a divine relic.

In the spring of the *wuyin* year of the Zhiyuan era (1278),
The Imperial Prince, the Prince of Anxi, issued a special decree,
Commanding Administrator Duan Demao to carve an ox from stone
And place it beneath the tree, evoking the scene of old.
The palace stewards Nie Zhizhen and Zhao Zhixuan,
Receiving the mandate with joy,
Deemed it an encounter of a thousand lifetimes.
They inscribed the stone with earnest devotion,
Ensuring its glory would endure forever.

I have often reflected upon this:
In ancient times, people cherished the sweet pear tree in memory of the Duke of Shao,
Never forgetting his virtue.
Zhou Maoshu left the grass in his courtyard uncut,
His boundless benevolence extending even to plants.
Now, the virtuous prince, revering the sacred footsteps
Of the Supreme Master who transmitted the teachings,
Has awakened the same longing as for the sweet pear,
And, consulting antiquity, has fashioned this likeness,
Adorning this numinous tree.
Here, we see the perfection of boundless love—
One act, two virtues, what benevolence could be greater?

Only through benevolence can all things be embraced.
Thus, Master Guan Yin said:
"One who is good at my Dao
Perceives Heaven and exhausts the divine within a single thing,
Fulfills destiny, and reaches the mysterious."
This is not merely knowing that all things bear Heaven’s mandate,
But that the free and obstructed, self and other,
Can be fused into one, all returning to the transformation of perfect benevolence.
How could this be excluded from a single tree?

Composed by Zhu Xiangxian, the Empty Elder of Sanmao Mountain.

**Record of the Reconstruction of Huiling Abbey on Mount Zhongnan**

As for the workings of creation toward humanity—whether it is without intent or with intent—I cannot presume to know. Across the boundless ages and the vast expanse of heaven, how could one ever fathom it? Yet the stonecutter seizes the moment when the jade is pure, and the hunter follows the trail of the deer. Witness the descent of the divine at Shen, and one knows creation is not without action; witness the speaking stone of Jin, and one knows creation is not without intent. Behold the clouds parting at Mount Heng, the spring borrowed from the sea’s depths, and one knows the sincerity of humanity can commune with the numinous. Behold the well yielding water at a prayer, the sun halted by a sweep of the spear, and one knows the earnestness of humanity can move heaven and earth. Behold the thunder in winter, the ice formed in summer, and one knows the wisdom and strength of humanity can wrest the power of creation from heaven and earth. From this, we see that though the azure vault may seem distant and remote, its responsiveness arises from the sincerity of the heart.

The heart’s virtue is boundless and vast, like the great void—clear, expansive, unobstructed by worldly desires, luminous and all-pervading, merging seamlessly with heaven. Every impulse of the mind finds its echo in the workings of creation. How much more so for one who ascends the ninefold throne, occupies the great treasure, wields the power of ten thousand chariots, and rules the four seas—yet still immerses the heart in the mysterious and directs every thought toward the true? The resonance between heaven and humanity in such a one is beyond comparison with the common folk.

This Huiling Abbey was the very place where, during the Kaiyuan era of the Tang, Emperor Minghuang dreamed of the jade image of the Mysterious Ancestor appearing. The abbey was established on this account. According to the *Stele of the Numinous Responses of Louguan*, its summary states: “Having received the mandate and reigned for thirty years, the August Emperor’s achievements equaled heaven and earth, and his filial piety moved his ancestors. Once, in quietude within the palace, he longed for the supreme Dao. His virtue stirred heaven, and in a dream, the numinous response was revealed—truly the luminous command of the Primordial Ancestor, manifesting the most wondrous model. Thereupon, he secretly sought the mysterious image, following the edicts in his search. He named the platform of the Zhou historian, nestled in the secluded valleys of Mount Tai, and there, a radiant countenance emerged, resplendent with light. When the sagacious emperor beheld it, it matched his dream in every detail.” It further states: “The more divine the merit, the greater the response; the more numinous the source, the longer its flow.” Given this, how could the principle of mysterious resonance be otherwise?

Some may doubt this, so I have verified it thus: *The Doctrine of the Mean* states, “Sincerity takes form, and form becomes manifest.” Dreams are but the manifestation of sincerity. When King Gaozong of Shang meditated in reverent silence, he dreamed the Lord charged him to find a worthy minister—and indeed, he sought and found Fu Yue. Minghuang, in his frequent reverence before the true image, was moved to dream of its appearance. This is sincerity taking form and becoming manifest. I have read in *The Old Tang History* that during Minghuang’s reign, the Mysterious Ancestor’s manifestations were numerous. At times, he appeared as an old man selling divinations outside the Spring Brightness Gate; at others, he descended at the Vermilion Phoenix Gate, instructing Tian Tongxiu to retrieve the talisman from Hangu Pass. He also appeared in the Zhaoyuan Pavilion of the Huaqing Palace, in the Baoxian Grotto of Mount Taibai, and by the Blackwater Stream in Hanzhong Prefecture. All these events are recorded in credible histories, their words and traces verifiable—one may seek them but cannot dismiss them as false.

Some argue: In the Kaiyuan era, Minghuang’s governance nearly rivaled the Three Dynasties, and auspicious omens abounded. Yet after Tianbao, indulgence led to chaos, and the nation’s course grew perilous. Why such a stark contrast? I maintain that the mechanism of resonance is rooted in the human heart—how much more so for the Son of Heaven? As the ancients said, “Where there is sincerity, there is the numinous.” His governance embraced tranquility, he personally studied the *Laozi*, and his profound contemplation yielded extraordinary responses. It is also said, “Without sincerity, there is no numinous.” When sincerity wanes, negligence arises, and thus calamities and disorder follow—an inevitable principle.

Yet consider his forty-five years on the throne, his seventy-eight years of life, the auspicious signs and grand achievements of his early reign, the illustrious governance of his middle years, and in his later years, his retreat to leisure and cultivation, his abstention from grain—when he was about to depart this world, jade flutes summoned a pair of cranes to the courtyard. The Supreme Emperor named him the Perfected One of Primordial Commencement and Vast Ascent. By this, we know he was a sage, divine, and sagacious ruler. The abbey preserves the *Stele of the Mysterious Ancestor’s Manifestation*, inscribed by Su Lingzhi of the Tang, which details these events. When Zhao Lüxin of the Song re-erected it, counting backward, a full cycle of sixty years had passed. Dynasties and markets changed repeatedly, with rises and falls uncounted. In recent times, the upheaval of Luo Tianxing brought ruin, and the sacred halls and secret chambers alike were reduced to ashes.

When our august dynasty pacified the land and restored order, in the bing-shen year, Master Lǚ Tongchen, a Perfected One, received the command of the Great Patriarch of the Pure Harmony Sect to revive the ancestral abbey. At a time when celestial omens and auspicious signs abounded, and the Daoist teachings flourished, the two Perfected Masters’ virtue and power were so exalted that both humans and gods revered them. Their disciples, bearing provisions, traveled from afar to answer the call. With united sincerity and concerted effort, every craft was employed, and beyond the construction of the ancestral abbey, each subsidiary estate was restored according to its needs. Thus, the revival of this abbey was made possible by the collective efforts of masters and friends from all directions.

Once the halls were erected, discord among the stewards arose, and the Patriarch issued teachings and admonitions to establish the monastic regulations. Tongchen then appointed the abbey’s officer, Wang Zhian, to oversee the rituals. Thereafter, the abbots changed frequently, and the abbey’s fortunes declined. Tongchen embodied the Dao in his conduct, focusing on substance over appearance. Every action and stillness was a teaching, yet the disciples failed to grasp this, and many busied themselves with superficialities. Thus, the root weakened while the branches flourished.

In the geng-wu year of the Zhiyuan era, the abbey’s elders, recognizing He Zhiyuan’s steadfastness and capability, entrusted him with the administration of the abbey.

Once He Zhiyuan arrived, he devoted himself wholeheartedly to restoration. In summer, he did not pause for a fan; in winter, he did not approach the hearth. Unceasing through the months and years, he transformed the abbey until it shone anew. He rebuilt the Secret Hall, constructed the grand gate, established the Cloud Chamber, opened the fields, and gathered both the tonsured and the robed. He ordered the ritual feasts and offerings, ensuring no seasonal observance passed unmarked. As the abbey’s strength steadily grew, distant pilgrims came to pay reverence. Yet as the sun set on the western mountains and his ascent drew near, on the eighteenth day of the twelfth lunar month in the jia-wu year, he returned to the True, entrusting the abbey’s affairs to his disciple Pan Daozhi.

The following winter, in the first month, the Patriarch Zhao Zhixuan brought Daozhi to the Scripture Terrace and, presenting the abbey’s recent achievements, requested an inscription from me for the stele. Unable to refuse, I traced the origins of the abbey’s founding in the Kaiyuan era, recounting the principle of celestial and human sincerity as its record, and appended this inscription:

Vast and boundless, the great design leans on the pestle,
Within it, the true essence—how could an office compare?
Distant, it is not estranged; near, none dare claim it.
Of myriad forms, fair or foul—who bestows them?

I reflect on the Primordial Dao’s Ancestor,
Who opened heaven and fittingly became Master of Creation.
Not a single thing was left unnurtured, warmed and cherished,
Its wondrous likeness to moon on water—how universally it responds!

The Kaiyuan Emperor ruled with upright virtue,
Enraptured by the *Scripture of the Dragon*, revering the Teachings’ Father.
Delighted, the spirits assented as if with a glance,
Suddenly, the mysterious image manifested in this land.

Sixty cycles of jia-zi, yet its traces remain unrotted,
The ancient stele still gleams, the *Lingzhi* records shine.
Tongchen returned to revive its gates,
The faintest echoes restored the old family’s legacy.

Ancient tunes do not harmonize with the world’s scales,
Dim and distant, how could one speak of them?
Hear the profound chant resounding like bells and drums,
Hear the golden cauldron where dragons and tigers leap.

Hear the demons subdued by the thunderous axe,
Hear the celestial patterns meticulously explored.
Only hope to return to simplicity, forgetting self and other,
Only hope to contemplate the wondrous, joining the many origins.

Only hope for sudden joy in seeing the true and plain,
Only hope to inherit the luminous, continuing the mysterious lineage.
Beside the Scripture Terrace, through a thousand ages,
The abbey stands firm, a pillar in the Dao’s vast sea.

**Record of the Yanhua Hermitage of Pure Yang Cave in Wenxian Valley**

North of the Southern Mountains, south of the Scripture Terrace, there lies a stone chamber. Smooth and rounded like Kongtong, it is naturally formed, recorded in maps and gazetteers as the Pure Yang Cave, and colloquially called Wenxian Valley. In former times, Daoist adepts, drawn by the immortal traces of Pure Yang, built halls and installed images to tend the incense and flame. During the Zhengda era, war left it in ruins.

After the dynasty pacified the land, in the bing-shen year, the Perfected Li Tongchen, by the command of the Grand Patriarch Qinghe, restored the Louguan Abbey. The immortal traces and sacred relics were all renewed. At that time, two Daoist friends, Zhou and Wang, built a hall by the cave and practiced their austerities there. In the southwest corner of the cave, two stalks of extraordinary bamboo suddenly sprouted, their side branches numbering sixty-four in perfect array, resembling the milfoil of Cai. All who saw it marveled, deeming it an auspicious omen for the Daoist grove, and named it the Divine Marvel Bamboo. After the two friends passed away, Zhou Zhiquan, the Dweller in Truth, succeeded them. The abbey’s structures were incomplete, so he further expanded and repaired them.

In the xin-si year, Xiranzi Wang Zhihe arrived with his disciples from Liu and Jiang, constructing a hermitage to the left of the cave for their dwelling. The qi of water and clouds merged, the fragrance of orchids and angelica harmonized. Together, they distanced themselves from the clamor of the world, delighting in seclusion and silence. Beyond self-sufficient farming and planting, they sought nothing else, passing the years in ease, attaining the joy of reclusion without ennui.

One day, the abbey’s overseer Guan Daoxuan addressed the assembly: “Now that the disciples have gathered and the incense and rituals are in order—surpassing even the past—it is fitting to inscribe a record to enlighten future generations.” He then petitioned the Supervisor of Daoist Affairs for Qin and Shu, the Master of the Mysteries Sun Zunshi, who, in accordance with the imperial decree of the Zhiyuan era bestowing the title “True Lord,” adopted the characters *yanhua* (evolution) for the grand inscription, naming it the Hermitage. He then requested me to compose this record.

I reflect that the immortal’s wanderings left traces everywhere—from dawn at Mount Hao to dusk at Mount Chu—each place bearing his presence. Thus, his name spread across the realm, and regardless of rank or age, all revered and venerated him. Yet among the many immortals, why was he uniquely esteemed? It was because his vow was vast, his transformative power boundless, his mysterious capacity great, and his karmic connections equally profound.

In recent times, the Quanzhen teachings arose, and the mystic wind spread widely. From the eastern seas to the western reaches of Shu, south beyond the Yangtze and Han rivers, and north to the great deserts, none failed to honor and follow, swept up in its current. Never before had the Dao’s influence spread so swiftly and universally. Tracing its origins, the encounter at Gan River by Chongyang, the transmission of the *Five Secret Poems*—all stemmed from this immortal. Thus, the imperial decree bestowed the august title “True Lord of Six Characters,” surely because his virtuous Dao benefited the world and aided governance and teaching!

The immortal’s vast vows found their response here. This sacred site, where the Primordial Dao first transmitted the teachings, was fittingly a place where the great Perfected came and went. All who don the feathered robe and dwell here should rejoice and cherish it, aligning their hearts with the environment to attain the Dao, lest they forsake themselves.

Yet how can one strive for the Dao without the *Five Thousand Precious Teachings*? Thus, immortals and sages take the *Dao and Virtue* as their foundation, while the *Dao and Virtue* rely on immortals and sages for transmission. To depart from the *Dao and Virtue* is to fail in attaining immortality; to aspire to immortality, one must firmly uphold the *Dao and Virtue*. Formerly, the prefect of Chenjiang met the immortal and asked what he practiced. The immortal replied: “I practice the teachings of Laozi, delving into their meaning, exploring their subtleties, hoping to wander boundlessly and endure as long as heaven and earth.” Ah! Could the immortal have deceived me?

“The valley spirit does not die—this is called the Mysterious Female,”
The heart of heaven and earth—this, too, is the immortal’s heart.
Those who attain this will not disgrace their lineage.

I have also composed a *Chu Ci* ode to offer with chrysanthemums by the spring.

The ode reads:
Clouds shroud in gloom where verdant mountains bend,
Waters flow cold by jasper terraces’ trend.
I gaze for the yellow crane—yet it ne’er appears,
Behold the immortal’s visage—my heart lingers there.
I yearn for the immortal’s wind, boundless in roam,
Riding the azure serpent, waving the jade dragon’s plume.
At dawn I traverse the hundred Yue, by dusk the ten isles,
Do I recall old wanderings—shall I return once more?
Boiling white stones in limpid springs,
Listening to pines while pillowing on stone in sleep.
Are these days and months but fleeting years?
My heart, vast and empty, regains its true nature.
Unfurling a scripture, its radiance dazzles like jade and pearl,
Awakening the ages, illuminating the nine realms.
The gates of immortality swing wide, myriad wonders unfold,
Snow crowns my brow—yet none can call me back.

The Stele of Yuhua Abbey
Before the Supreme Ultimate divided, the Dao abided in primordial chaos. When the Two Modes first parted, the Dao dwelled in heaven and earth. Having taken its place at the center, the Dao resided in the sage. The sage, in turn, aided heaven and earth in nurturing transformation, rectified the nature and destiny of the people, unlocked the profound learning of past sages, and inaugurated eternal peace for all generations.

In the age of King Zhao of Zhou, our Dao Ancestor of the Mysterious Origin bestowed the scriptures upon Wen Shi, whence all teachings arose. King Mu visited the thatched hut, and his former dwelling was transformed into the Louguan Abbey—thus began the institution of abbeys. He named it "Secluded Retreat" and ordained seven Daoist priests—thus arose the lineage of Daoist clergy. Hence, Louguan Abbey may well be the cradle of the Mysterious Teachings!

Thereafter, the First Emperor of Qin established a temple here, Emperor Wu of Han erected a palace, the Jin and Song dynasties issued edicts for its expansion, and the Sui and Tang granted households for its upkeep. The veneration of successive dynasties has been long-standing indeed.

In recent times, the founder of the Quanzhen School emerged from Shanyin, reviving the true wind of the Mysterious Sage and continuing the ancient teachings of non-action. The Dao flourished beyond the world, while its teachings spread within it. From high-ranking nobles to white-haired elders and yellow-haired children, none failed to revere and uphold its Way. At that time, mountains and forests, cities and towns—abbeys stood in sight of one another, with tens or hundreds of dwellings, disciples receiving transmission in orderly succession. All were spontaneously inspired without need for exhortation. The propagation of the Dao’s transformative power, since the Three Dynasties, had never been so flourishing.

This Yuhua Abbey is an affiliated cloister of the ancient Louguan Abbey. In the year *yiwei* of our dynasty, the Perfected Li Tongxian, entrusted by the Great Patriarch Qinghe, undertook the restoration of the ancestral abbey. At that time, his disciple, the Great Master of Enlightenment Li Shoukuan, arrived from Mingshui to pay homage at his teacher’s seat. At the foot of the mountain, he discovered the former site of Princess Yuzhen’s palace and there established a hermitage as his dwelling, naming it Yuhua Hermitage. After a decade of residence, just as he planned to expand and renovate, he suddenly departed this world. Tongxian then commanded his disciple, the Unadorned Perfected Guo Shouchong, to relocate to this site, overseeing construction and erecting the abbey. Work began in the spring of the *guiyou* year of the Zhiyuan era and was completed in the winter of the *bingxu* year. The sacred hall, the Perfected’s shrine, the cloud chambers, and the kitchens—all were arranged in proper order. Later, a double wall was built, trees were planted, and the layout was made spacious. The hermitage was elevated to an abbey and retained the name Yuhua, as commanded by the Heavenly Music Perfected of the Ancestral Court.

The following year, Shouchong was appointed to supervise the abbey’s affairs. In his devotion to the Dao, his teacher’s transmission had a clear source; in his conduct, he was pure and frugal, his integrity renowned near and far. Now, at ninety-five, his countenance remains youthful, his spirit clear and unburdened. From dawn to dusk, he never ceases his recitations, showing no sign of weariness. How could he have reached such a state without abundant cultivation?

One day, the abbey’s supervisors, Wang Shouxuan and He Shouzhen, compiled the abbey’s history and sought an inscription to carve into stone for posterity. As I could not refuse, I have arranged these events in order, though words fail to convey their full meaning. Thus, I append this ode:

The Great Dao, though forcibly named, ever dwells in profound obscurity.
Without color, it manifests all hues; without form, it shapes all forms.
When the myriad things disperse, boundaries and stagnation dissolve.
The five phases revolve—none surpasses humanity in spirit.
Guard well your steps, for principle divides the paths of the Wei and Jing.
Those mired in turbidity and desire shall fall; those pure shall ascend to the imperial court.
Lofty stands Louguan Abbey, its auspicious vapors lush and green.
The Dao’s lineage from Wen Shi shines bright as sun and stars.
Yuhua Abbey’s founding casts its light afar, mirrored in the forest’s edge.
Waters encircle it like green ribbons, mountains unfold like emerald screens.
The moon gleams on jasper steps, the wind threads through lattice panes.
Ah, Shouchong! Your fame and virtue are fragrant indeed.
You exalt the incense and flame, expound the teachings, and discourse on scriptures.
A model for later learners, your demeanor is a canonical example.
In morning audiences with the Perfected, you earnestly pray for the sage’s longevity.
Supreme joy is no joy; true emptiness is great tranquility.
While the world’s hearts are intoxicated, I alone remain sober.
A dream in the locust court—swift as thunder’s crack.
The immortal cassia never ages, yet the hibiscus fades at dusk.
To reveal the fleeting and enduring, I carve this stele and inscribe this ode.

Composed by Wang Shoudao of Guhe.
Erected on the Clear and Bright Festival of the *yimao* year of the Yanlu era by the abbey’s supervisors, Wang Shouxuan and He Shouzhen, with the assistance of Xian Huizong.

**Record of the Reconstruction of the Wen Shi Hall at the Great Ancestral Abbey**
Whence did it begin? In the age of the Ji Zhou, there was a Perfected One who, gazing upon the purple clouds here, encountered the Mysterious Sage. Transmitting scriptures and receiving the Dao, he cleaved the primordial chaos, opened the vast expanse, revealed the natural order, and illuminated the luminous—thus did the teachings arise. Later, he appeared in the market of the Green Sheep, where he was bestowed the title "Master Wen Shi." Herein lies the profound essence.

The ancient Louguan Abbey stands on the very site of the thatched hut. Traces of its legacy—the Terrace of Scripture Transmission and the Ox-Striking Cypress—remain unharmed. Though ages have passed and vicissitudes endured, each time the abbey fell into ruin, it was soon restored. This is because it is the very cradle of the Mysterious Teachings!

In recent times, it reached its nadir during the Jin dynasty’s decline. After the imperial court pacified the realm, Master Hongmiao Zhenren Li Zhiniu, awaiting the dust to settle, received the mandate of the Great Master Qinghe. Leading his disciples, he restored the abbey, and directly north of the Liaoyang Hall, upon the old foundation, he rebuilt the Hall of Wen Shi, enshrining alongside him the Perfected Ones Taihe and Taiji. Towering and magnificent, it inspires awe in all who behold it. With the hall newly erected, yet the steles and records of former dynasties fragmented and incomplete, the origins of the lineage became obscure, offering no enlightenment to later scholars. Thus, he chronicled its beginnings and end, recording the recent emergence of the *Book of Master Guan Yin* into the world, and sought me to inscribe it in stone. Though my literary skill is wanting, I dared not refuse, and so seized the opportunity to set down this account.

According to the *Records of the Grand Historian*, as the Zhou dynasty declined, Laozi journeyed west and passed through the pass. The Keeper of the Pass, Yin Xi, said: "You are about to withdraw from the world—compel yourself to write a book for me." Thereupon, he composed the *Dao and Virtue* in two scrolls, over five thousand characters, and departed, his ultimate fate unknown. Observing the encounter between the Sage and the Perfected One, one sees how earnestly he was entreated to write, revealing his profound concern for the world and his desire to restore the governance of high antiquity—his intent was most earnest. As for revealing the mechanism of the precelestial *you-wu* and inaugurating the inexhaustible transmission of the postcelestial, without Wen Shi, who could have brought these to light? Having received the book and grasped its essence, he then undertook a thousand days of pure fasting, mastered numerology, and penetrated the permutations of change. Thus, he composed nine scrolls, titled the *Book of Master Guan Yin*, which aligns precisely with the records in the *Inner Biography* and the *Han Dynasty’s Treatise on Arts and Letters*.

For over a thousand years since, though many have sought the nine-scroll *Book of Master Guan Yin*, none in the world had seen it, nor was it found in any repository. In the Song dynasty, Bi Xuzhi, well-versed in antiquity, once collated the classics of the Dao and encountered this text. He dismissed the *Scripture of Western Ascension* as a product of the Zhenghe era’s canon compilation, when two imperial edicts were issued to command the prefectures and states to seek lost Daoist scriptures. Though many were recovered, this book remained unheard of. Thus, one realizes that the books of transcendent immortals beyond the world are severed by the Creator—such is the natural order—yet they are never truly lost, merely awaiting their time to circulate.

At the founding of the Yuan dynasty, the Quanzhen teachings arose. In the fifth year of Qinghe’s succession, the *Book of Master Guan Yin* was discovered in the mountains of Yongjia and presented to the teaching seat. Its language was archaic and profound, forming a school of its own. All who saw or heard of it rejoiced, declaring that the teachings of Master Yin had reappeared. If not for the alignment of heaven’s timing and the Dao’s fortune, how could this have come to pass? Upon examining the book, its opening states: "Without the Dao, one cannot speak; what cannot be spoken is the Dao. Without the Dao, one cannot contemplate; what cannot be contemplated is the Dao"—an inversion of Laozi’s words. If one claims the Dao cannot be spoken or contemplated, then what cannot be spoken or contemplated *is* the Dao. Its method is incisive and precise, truly the offspring of Laozi’s thought.

In its time, it is no wonder that Zhuangzi, hearing of its influence, delighted in it, hailing its author as "the vast and true man of antiquity" and claiming his own learning derived from Master Guan Yin. Liezi, upon encountering it, took him as his teacher, hence the many passages recording his inquiries. That these two masters of lofty attainment submitted so humbly—how could it have been mere happenstance? Yet Laozi’s book exalts the Dao and honors virtue, saying little else, while this book establishes its grand principles and unfolds its myriad details, thereby synthesizing the great tradition. Thus, it roams the Great Beginning, unites with the single breath, encompasses the ten thousand things, and merges with the darkness of heaven and earth. For those who directly point to the Dao of the Dao, how could mere words suffice? Even when discussing the affairs of the Dao, as when it speaks of "the maiden and the infant, the dragon and the tiger"—this is today’s alchemical Dao; or "questions and answers among reeds, beans, tiles, and stones"—this is today’s School of Emptiness; or "water yielding to fire, south dying and north living"—this is today’s learning of investigating things and extending knowledge. Such mutual resonance and comprehensive illumination abound. The later teachings of the Three Schools of *li* (principle), *xing* (nature), and *ming* (destiny) had not yet arisen, yet this book had already elucidated them all. From this, one sees how it expounds the profound mystery and opens the gates of manifold wonders—its role as a gateway to the teachings is indeed vast.

Yet those who tread its path differ in their depth of attainment. As the world declined and the source grew distant, each school, based on its own emphases, established its own sectarian gate. Scholars, even from youth to old age, often cannot fully grasp their own tradition, let alone find one who embodies its entirety. In recent years, those devoted to the mysteries have produced commentaries and annotations, yet they illuminate one aspect while obscuring another, inviting the reproach of "viewing the sky through a tube."

Now, upon verifying the book, its preface bears Liu Xiang’s memorial, and its end contains Ge Hong’s postscript. According to their accounts, during the Han dynasty, Master Gai transmitted it to Chancellor Cao Can. After Cao Can’s death, the book was buried with him. Emperor Wu later obtained it from a fangshi, and the Prince of Huainan subsequently concealed it. In the Jin dynasty, Ge Zhichuan encountered Zheng Siyuan, heard of it, cherished and recited it, and knelt in gratitude for the privilege of receiving it directly. Examining these accounts, one sees that in former times, its recipients treasured and guarded it for themselves, not sharing it with the world. After Zhichuan, it was lost without a trace.

Now, as the august Yuan dynasty inaugurates its destiny, uniting Hua and Yi, unifying script and governance, the book has emerged. Scholars throughout the realm, devoted to this Way, need not search afar or endure hardship to obtain it. Transmitted from person to person and household to household, all may receive and uphold it, sparing them the lament of the white-haired gazing at the ocean. How fortunate! Yet I have reflected: in ancient times, when lingzhi mushrooms sprouted or auspicious clouds appeared, the official historians still recorded them as omens in the annals. Now, a book conveying the Dao has emerged in an age unparalleled—its significance for discerning rise and decline, reviving teachings, and transforming customs is extraordinary. It is fitting to record this at the very source of its lineage, awaiting the Grand Historian’s compilation, and to enable scholars to know the origin of their good fortune.

Alas! If not bestowed by heaven, who could have partaken in this?

This palace has endured since the Zhou dynasty, its rises and falls, its falls and rises—who can count their number? The formation and decay of things are bound by fate. Gazing from the mountain, one sees Qin’s Epang, Han’s Weiyang, Sui’s Renshou, Tang’s Jiucheng: each, in its time, reached unparalleled splendor. Yet after but a few generations, they crumbled into fields of millet and mounds of ruins. Yet this palace, since King Mu built the Louguan, has passed through twenty-one dynasties and spanned two thousand four hundred years. Though it has known the ashes of kalpas, it has risen again after each collapse, expanded after each lapse—neither swayed by the flux of things nor perishing with the ages. Its dark lineage has been guarded from generation to generation. Observing the past, one may know the future: it may endure as long as the mountains.

Ah! Is this not what is called the foundation of the Dao and the site of virtue, the ageless realm of longevity? The immortal capital beyond the dust and beyond the world? Now, its temple halls stand renewed, its sacrifices offered daily with reverence, to awaken the innate goodness of those to come. Yet scholars from the four corners of the earth, ten thousand *li* away, who recite its texts and grasp their meaning, feel as though they receive its teachings face to face. Here, amidst the everlasting peaks of Zhongnan, its voice and presence endure. Those who tread upon its sacred grounds, ascend its hidden halls, and gaze upon its images—overflowing as though present above, present beside—what barrier of time or distinction between immortal and mortal could stand between them? What power has wrought this?

As the classic says: *"Joyous!—suddenly, within it there is something. Profound!—darkly, within it there is essence. Its essence is most true; within it there is sincerity."* Here, one may perceive this—and turning inward, find it within oneself.

Ah, how earnest it is!

**Inscriptions by Eminent Scholars**

*Poems Left at Louguan*
**Su Zizhan**

Crows caw and apes cry—doors shut at noon,
Who in this stillness knows the ancient sovereign’s grace?
The blue ox long since cast off its yoke,
While white cranes now and then visit his heirs.

The mountain near, the north wind blows piled snow,
The sky cold, the setting sun pales a lone village.
The Daoist must wonder at the crowds of visitors,
Who’ve drawn the well dry, muddying its waters.

Before the gate, an ancient stele in slanting sun,
Time flows like a river—what sorrow it brings!
Ever are travelers moved by Duke Hui of Jin,
Forcing repairs to this temple, emulating Qin’s First Emperor.

Cinnabar long buried turns the wellspring red,
Who now burns fragrant aloes in the kitchen’s cauldron?
I hear immortals too pass through here—
Yet I suspect the old farmer is none other than Geng Sang.

**Preaching Platform**

Sword dances reveal divine skill, calligraphy born of grass,
The sea and mountains at peace, the zither’s art refined.
From this terrace, the Qin plain shrinks to nothing—
No need to preach the scriptures; the intent is already void.

*Poem Sent to Louguan*
**Su Ziyou**

Old Laozi, weary of the world, entered the shifting sands,
Drifting like clouds, beyond all restraint.
His disciples, pitying their master’s exile,
Watched the passes for omens and brought him home.

The high terrace still holds the place where scriptures were taught,
The ruined walls alone bear the ox-cart’s traces.
Once the sacred texts were received, one never aged—
Why then did he suffer the bitter taste of sesame?

**Louguan**
**Shi Manqing**

Early he rode the blue ox, expounding the two scrolls,
Later it’s said he mounted a white deer to ascend the three heavens.
He hoped emperors would practice the Dao,
Not that men would merely learn to be immortals.

The deer’s approach was no mere chance,
The cypress’s form, like a gaze, stood firm.
I lingered the whole day, yet left the sacred site behind—
Pavilions and towers, tiered, fade into the evening mist.

**The Resurrected Cypress**

The ancient cypress died long ago,
Yet revived in its time of flourishing.
Years had withered its old trunk,
But spring brought forth new branches.

Confucius’ bones had long decayed,
Yet Xu Jia’s corpse was reanimated.
How unfathomable the intent of creation—
Why here alone is it so hard to know?

**Poems Left at Louguan**
**Wang Shen**

Boyang wandered into the Zhou,
The Keeper of the Pass invited him to build a thatched hut.
First he discerned the purple qi rising in the east,
Then indeed rode west upon a blue ox.

He built a terrace to expound the five thousand characters,
Dug a well and refined cinnabar for hundreds of autumns.
Opening the hall to burn incense, he pondered the profound teachings—
Southern mountains layered in twilight, mist floating.

**Another Poem**
**Wang Yuchuan**

The Keeper of the Pass retired, preserving this old abode,
The feathered chariot of the Perfected One rests on its ancient mound.
Water and stone naturally house the immortal’s refreshing qi,
Mists and clouds ever allow the world’s people to wander.

The Dao of Heaven, vast, turns through beginning and end,
The dusty world’s bonds entangle departure and stay.
See how easily one abandons an official post—
In old age, he occupies a mountain’s corner.

**Inscribed at the Wuyun Manor Daoist Abbey**
**Su Zizhan**

The ancient abbey leans where forest and foothills part,
Villagers come for the sweet wellspring’s water.
A rushing stream joins the Wei, hastening north,
Flying birds greet the mountain, no longer heading south.

Feathered guests in robes and caps pay homage to the stars,
Country folk burn incense to bless the spring silkworms.
Does your master truly understand the mandate of fate?
What does a mountain spirit know of Laozi’s wisdom?

On the eighteenth day of the second month of the *Renyin* year, I toured Louguan and again visited the shrine of Princess Yuzhen, leaving a poem in the hall.
At the time, my younger brother Zhe (Ziyou) was in the capital; I sent him this poem to match its rhyme.

The following year, on the third day of the eleventh month, I returned and inscribed both poems on the back of the stele.

**Su Zizhan**

The streams and mountains grow ever more lovely, my desire unwearied,
I climb to the jagged peaks—how many have I scaled?
Deep valleys, wild birds with strange plumage,
High above, immortal maidens with delicate brows.

Unashamed to ride the red phoenix like Nongyu,
I should follow Chang’e, driving the old toad.
Valley grasses and cliff blossoms have no master—
At dusk, butterflies drift through the sparse curtains.

**Matching Rhyme**
**Su Ziyou**

Master Xie’s wanderlust remains unquenched,
He wears his climbing clogs to the mountain’s sharpest peaks.
The ancient hall’s immortals dwell in profound depths,
Incense smoke and emerald mist rise in delicate wisps.

Courtyard flowers, silent, scatter jade-like petals,
Cliffside cypresses, sparse, reveal the jade toad.
The princess returns at dusk, unseen by men—
A slanting wind, fine rain, the curtains part on their own.

**Princess Yuzhen of the Tang**, styled *Chiying*, was Emperor Ruizong’s ninth daughter, initially enfeoffed as *Chongchang*. In the first year of *Jingyun*, she entered the Dao alongside Princess Jinxian, receiving the title *Supreme Clarity, Mystic Capital, Great Cavern of the Three Luminaries*. Today, at the southern foothills of Louguan, the shrine of Princess Yuzhen remains. Local legend calls the place *Langong*, claiming it as a detached palace of the princess’s family. Yet stele inscriptions have faded, gazetteers are lost or corrupted, and the details of its rise and decline cannot be verified. Only the stele erected by Dai Zong at Louguan during the *Kaiyuan* era mentions Princess Yuzhen studying here. Wang Wei and Chu Guangxi both wrote poems about Princess Yuzhen’s mountain villa and mountain retreat, confirming that the princess’s shrine was indeed a detached abbey of Louguan. Thus, all Tang poems inscribed here were recorded. In the second year of *Yuanyou*, the cyclical year *Dingmao*, on the full moon of the seventh month, Xue Shaopeng of Hedong inscribed this.

**Following the Imperial Composition on Visiting Princess Yuzhen’s Mountain Villa and Inscribing the Stone Wall**
**Wang Wei**

Beyond the azure firmament’s winds and clouds,
The jade terrace’s path stretches far.
How is it that beside the imperial gardens,
There exists another home of immortals?

Here the imperial carriage turned,
Following the stream, the emerald banners wound.
Within the grotto, sun and moon unfold,
From the windows, clouds and mist arise.

In the courtyard, cranes soar to the heavens,
By the stream, the Han’s celestial rafts linger.
Fields yield white jade,
Mud transforms into cinnabar.

The valley still, the springs ring clearer,
The mountains deep, the sun sets early.
The imperial broth blends with stone marrow,
Fragrant rice is offered with sesame.

**The Great Dao Now Knows No Bounds**
**The Way of Long Life Has Its Limits**

Still gazing toward the ninefold heavens above,
Coming and going in the five-cloud chariot.

**Residence of Princess Yuzhen**
**Chu Guangxi**

North of the mountain lies the Heavenly Spring Park,
West of the mountain, the Phoenix Maiden’s home.
Not a word of Qin Garden’s beauty,
Only the hidden blossoms of Wuling.

**Visiting the Scenic Hall of Princess Yuzhen**
**Lu Lun**

Evening light by the window stirs dark dust,
Blue pines encircle the hall, unaware of spring.
Behold the white-haired sutra-chanters—
Half were once palace singers and dancers.

**Jade Perfection Abbey**
**Li Shen**

The emperor’s daughter, moved by lofty sentiment, yearned to ride the simurgh,
First pinning her hair with a jade-leaf crown.
Autumn moon, cloudless, rises in the azure vault,
White herbs, dew-drenched, emerge in limpid waves.

The layered city’s mists and haze drift far away,
The floating world’s dust makes long dwelling hard.
Ever since the flute’s notes soared away,
The grotto palace has sealed its jasper altar deep.

**Seeking Master Zhao the Daoist, Not Found**
**Yao Hu**

The feathered adept attends the morning audience, doors shut at noon,
A single path in the woods, faint in the snow.
Pine shadows encircle the courtyard, cranes face each other,
Mountain hues fill the tower, yet the master has not returned.

All day I ponder the wind-chariot’s return,
Gazing into the vast sky, watching wild clouds drift.
From on high, no news meets my straining eyes—
Turning back, can the mist and rosy clouds be met again?

**Inscribed on the Wall of Qixiu Pavilion**
**Tang Qiu**

For miles, green mountains offer no weariness,
Seeking the true formula, I question the yellow-crowned master.
Moss carpets the jade-dotted immortal bridge, slick,
Pines weave fragrant tips, the ancient path chills.

By day, beside green ridges, tender jade sways,
By night, red crucibles yield fresh cinnabar.
The lone bell has ceased, yet the spring’s voice remains,
Wind stirs jasper blossoms, the moon fills the altar.

**Inscribed at Louguan**
**Xue Zhou**

Beneath Zhongnan’s peaks, I built a thatched hut,
Cloud-wreathed vines trace a single deep path.
Man’s limits reach the edge of *Wenshi*,
Who has attained the heart of *Boyang*?

Ancient trees embody Heaven’s principle,
Pure winds quicken the traveler’s robe.
My carriage’s journey presses on—
In vain I regret neglecting the long chant.

**Also Inscribed at Louguan**
**Zhang Yunshi**

Tiered towers and pavilions brush the layered heavens,
Still recalling the grandeur of its *qi*-reading days.
White deer leave traces, the immortal’s chariot far,
The blue ox nears not, the night altar lies empty.

Rainbow banners’ shadows dampen the moon over Spirit Stream,
Twisted cypresses chill the jade palace’s winds.
Revering the imperial house’s devotion to the Yellow and the Old,
The jade-green carriage once honored this abode of sacred jade.

**Inscribed on the South Tower of Louguan**
The day’s dusty affairs coil round my heart,
A glimpse of South Mountain briefly opens my eyes.
Best when evening clouds disperse completely—
Midair, emerald verdure rushes into view.

**The Sutra-Explaining Terrace**
**Zhang Shanyuan**

Ten acres of garden mounds, verdant depths cast,
The Sage’s legacy remains, still worth seeking.
Heavenly winds stir the courtyard pines—
As if the Dao and virtue’s voice of old.

**Louguan**
**Zhang Zihou**

First entering the mountain gate, the atmosphere is secluded,
Spring winds reach the Purple Cloud Tower first.
Snow melts from the azure tiles, six-petaled flowers vanish,
Mist coils round cinnabar pillars, five hues float.

The Great Dao’s path and courtyard are ever easy to see,
The grotto-dwelling of immortals is not hard to seek.
If the pure ones truly intend to summon me,
By the Dao-Conferring Terrace, grant me a mound.

**Presented to Adept Pang**
**Zhang Shangying**

Doing away with court robes and caps,
Worldly cares entrusted to dreams.
Seeking the Supreme One’s formula for long life,
I chanced upon Zhongnan’s foremost peak.

Earth and wood shape his form, rich as cinnabar,
Water and clouds temper his nature, leisurely as clouds.
The fire-date within his body—none understand—
This elixir, once more attained, will fix the countenance.

**Presented to the Abbot of Jade Spring Hermitage**
**Hu Shuwen**

Dwelling in the mountains is not yet leaving the red dust,
There is another single formula for ascending Jade Capital.
To recognize the true visage of the Primal Chaos,
Press your ear to the green window and listen to the stream’s voice.

**Visiting Louguan**
**Sima Kang**

Hoary hair, thinning, bitterly encroaches,
Filthy thoughts shun the light, longing to retreat into shade.
Unable to escape the world, I know my regret,
Only fear that entering the mountains now is not deep enough.

Pavilions and halls, lofty, surpass all beauty,
Dust, reaching here, wholly settles.
Where my staff plants, all is mine—
Why seek a thousand crags and ten thousand gorges?

**Ascending the Sutra Terrace**
**Shi Kan**

Bamboo staff, straw sandals climb the emerald haze,
Soaring towers and grand views rival the sky.
Riding clouds, I would ascend straight into the void,
Yet my homeland’s mountains, glimpsed from afar, daze my eyes.

Perched on the first peak of the towering terrace,
Precarious railings lie amid white clouds.
Gazing at the mountains all day, my heart is never sated—
Purple and emerald stretch in layers, how many?

**Reflections on the Five Prefectures’ Villa**
**Zhang Jingxian**

North and south, east and west,
Meeting as if by fate.
A single word births righteousness,
Four seas become connected branches.

The prefectures arrayed like brocade,
The whole family nourished by purple mushrooms.
A solitary heart asks no questions,
Yet sorrow lingers for those not of our time.

**Inscribed in the Small Chamber of the Sutra Terrace**
**Sunset over distant peaks, autumn air clear,**
**Ancient terrace, old trees, cicadas clamor.**
The immortal departed, the crane never returned,
The swordsman came again, the elixir was complete.

Silent, facing the bamboo stove, smoke rises straight,
Carefully observing the moon’s grotto, osmanthus blooms.
This heart once had a Penglai tryst—
I would ask upon returning: what is your name?

**Autumn Excursion to Louguan, Wuzi Year**
**Yang Huanran**

Penglai lies beyond the blue sea,
Tigers and leopards guard Heaven’s gate.
White hair—who escapes it?
The blue ox, after all, did not return.

Tea drawn from the cinnabar well’s waters,
Poetry enters the Grass Pavilion Mountain.
What have I to show for myself?
Trivial matters of saddle and horse.

**Reflections on Louguan’s Past**
**Wang Liangchen**

Purple-cloud towers face the mountain spirits,
Frost leaves and autumn winds blanket green moss.
The dwarf cypress where the ox was struck—no one sees,
The staff-flower seeker traces the narrow path to the Sutra Terrace.

**Ten Poems on the Sutra Terrace**
**Qinghe Perfected Master Yin**

On the Sutra Terrace, turning eastward,
Eyes strain toward Yan Mountain, no bounds in sight.
The returning light reveals the original realm of purity—
I know not where my true home lies.

**On the Sutra Terrace**

On the Sutra Terrace, ten thousand greens fade from mind,
Only the Nine Chapters linger in passing sight.
Gazing back—my life’s heart is already full,
All day I face east to thank Chongyang.

On the Sutra Terrace, thoughts linger in silent musing,
A single idle heart mirrors past and present.
Seeing through the hundred schools—all effort in vain,
Beyond the Five Thousand Words, what more is there to seek?

On the Sutra Terrace, what is the meaning?
Far beyond the dust, worldly affairs and demons fade.
The Three Isles’ immortal realm remains unvisited,
The Five Thousand Words at last belong to Qinghe.

On the Sutra Terrace, incense of the heart burns,
I witnessed the patriarch receive the Dao’s teachings.
Since the Mysterious Origin departed,
The meaning of the Five Thousand Words grows ever clearer.

On the Sutra Terrace, thoughts drift endlessly,
Looking back on forty years of wandering.
From sea’s edge to heaven’s end—all traversed,
Yet I know not if this place will hold my heart.

On the Sutra Terrace, meeting kindred spirits,
The profound flavor of virtue and thought runs deep.
Do not idle in empty talk, passing words in vain—
The heart of Dao shines bright as the heart of sutra recitation.

On the Sutra Terrace, the Five Blossoms stretch afar,
Eastward, clouded mountains layer upon layer.
The path ahead—who governs its fate?
Heaven and earth belong to the masters of the great Way.

By the Sutra Terrace, water flows with murmuring sound,
Clear and resonant, like the sutra’s verses.
The Dao abides in the breast, its voice enters the ear,
Illuminating the heart’s ground ever more distinctly.

On the Sutra Terrace, delving into the sutra’s depths,
Each word is worth a measure of gold.
A heart blind to the mysterious words sinks to the underworld,
A nature attuned to wondrous speech aligns with heaven’s heart.

**Ten Poems Harmonizing with Perfected Master Qinghe of the Sutra Terrace**
**Qin Yanrong**

The Forest of Virtue blooms with virtue’s flowers,
The blue ox has gone west, beyond heaven’s bounds.
On the Sutra Terrace, all things merge as one,
Still passed down through the House of the Magistrate.

The world forgotten—I too forget,
Incense drifts lightly through the Valley Spirit’s chapter.
The crane on the pine branch is a wanderer of distant skies,
Its midnight cry startles the first stirrings of yang.

Youthful readings of *Guicang*, youthful chanting of *Ling*,
Originally there was no past, no present.
Transcendent, lodged within the pearl of a millet grain,
The dragon’s eye of heaven—nowhere to be found.

Ghosts cannot, spirits dare not—what can they do to me?
Raising high the three-foot blade to slay demons.
Within the shadow of the green pine, nothing else matters,
Alone I lean on the cold clouds, drinking the Great Harmony.

A mat of pure wind, a stove of incense,
The master sits in silence, no words spoken.
Since the Keeper of the Pass and Magistrate ascended,
Who says the principle of long life remains unmanifest?

Beneath the Sutra Terrace, waters flow endlessly,
The forest of axle-trees lies desolate, autumn unremembered.
I ask the thousand-year crane on the pine branch—
For whom, in truth, was the cinnabar furnace left?

The nameless, the great simplicity—few know its sound,
Mountains stand tall, waters run deep.
Until one treads the path beneath the Sutra Terrace,
When will the heart of the sage be glimpsed?

The roads to Mount Taihua and Zhongnan stretch far,
Autumn mists and evening clouds veil them further.
Who knows there is another gateway to heaven?
Within the Mysterious Female’s gate lies my true home.

At midnight, the wind carries the sound of a jade flute,
The path of the wandering immortal is distant, the dreaming soul clear.
The Five Thousand Characters were never spoken,
Yet the moon hangs in the ice-pure vase, radiant within.

Awakening to the two chapters—profound, ever profound,
Understanding transforms the earth into gold.
I wish to share the waters of the river’s purest source,
To wash clean the unended hearts of humankind.

**Ten Poems Harmonizing with Perfected Master Qinghe of the Sutra Terrace**
**Huang Daopu**

On the Sutra Terrace, scorning mist and rosy clouds,
At last I believe this floating life has its limits.
The white crane does not come—generations pass,
The green mountains must laugh at my homelessness.

In recent years, self and world—both forgotten,
Sitting before South Mountain, reading old chapters.
Turning back, the reciter of sutras is gone,
The ancient terrace overgrown with grass, half in slanting sunlight.

I wish to forget words—why chant at all?
The Dao has no end, no beginning—ancient as now.
To know the ceaseless principle of the Mysterious Female,
Seek only in the stillness of my own home.

The world is brief, people are fickle—what can be done?
The single truth is besieged by the six senses’ demons.
How much better to grasp the principle of prior heaven,
Silent and dim, preserving the Great Harmony.

Pine flowers fall on the cliffs, the crane’s dream fragrant,
In stillness deeply embodying the Valley Spirit’s chapter.
To this day, where the Keeper of the Pass transmitted the sutra,
The sun and moon bear his lofty name through ten thousand ages.

The terrace stands empty, people gone—events drift into the past,
Wind and moon serene, spring returns after autumn.
Today, climbing to seek the nearness of immortals,
My returning heart is detained by the white clouds.

The waters and mountains of Zhongnan possess a pure sound,
Green bamboo and verdant pines—years deepen.
To know the wondrous marvels of the grotto-heaven,
Even the wild apes and stream birds are without intent.

Unwearied by the true journey, the path stretches far,
Deep within the Grass Pavilion, azure clouds veil all.
Where, after all, is the blue ox?
The dwarf cypress still stands in the Magistrate’s house.

On the Sutra Terrace, listening to the spring’s voice,
In the quiet of night, the spring’s voice rings especially clear.
Who comprehends the inexhaustible wondrous principle?
A cold moon’s wheel illumines the heart of Dao.

Thrice reciting the mysterious words, their flavor deepens,
Each chapter divided above and below—worth a thousand gold.
Best to uphold the ever-abiding Dao of great antiquity,
To transform the unended hearts of the living.

**The Sutra Terrace**
**Perfected Master Song of the Cloud-Dispelling**

On the Sutra Terrace, grasses stretch boundlessly,
The sacred ancestor’s Mysterious Origin—ancient Dao site.
Purple qi imprinted the Zhou and Luo cities,
The blue ox trampled the Magistrate’s village.

Five Thousand secret words—wind stirs the desk,
Ninety thousand immortals—moon fills the hall.
Do not say wildflowers lack the nature of hearing,
To this day they still listen to the Valley Spirit’s chapter.

**Louguan**
**Guo Zhouqing**

At treetop’s edge, azure mist opens toward the sun,
Midair, gold and jade gleam upon towering peaks.
The cinnabar fire has cooled, the well remains,
The purple qi’s shadow has faded—none return.

Through ten thousand ages, wind and mist settle into history’s brush,
A single turn of cranes and apes beside the Sutra Terrace.
Pity I lack the art of flying immortals,
Vainly facing the west wind, composing seven laments.

**The Sutra Terrace**
*After years of stilling the jade dust,*

People gone, the terrace remains—all the more desolate.
Had the blue ox not halted its chariot,
How would the yellow dog have ascended as an immortal?

First, I set aside the horses of that time,
Next, I stewed the delicacies of a great state.
The Five Thousand Characters endure to this day,
Within the mysterious, the profoundly mysterious is seen anew.

**Louguan**
**Li Xianqing**

The path winds through the vaulted forest, a painted scroll unfurls,
The towering Louguan, propped against the sky, stands lofty and grand.

The purple qi from the east seems still visible,
The blue ox to the west vanishes, never to return.
Beyond the bamboo, light mist floats over steaming tea,
From pine boughs, the frozen moon illuminates the zither terrace.
Clams and ants live and die in the human world—
In distant thoughts of immortals, only self-pity remains.

**The Sutra Terrace**
The preacher of sutras departed a thousand years ago,
Yet the treetop terrace lingers, enduring still.
Across the seas, the wondrous teachings spread to this day,
But the dragon-like sage is seen no more.
Wind howls, earth’s breath harmonizes like reed pipes,
Sunlight gilds mountain blossoms in vibrant brocade.
One must believe the Valley Spirit never dies—
At dusk, hidden birds take up the discourse on the Dao.

**Inscribed After Traveling with the Great Master to Louguan and Ascending the Sutra Terrace**
*True Man Zhang of Chengming*

The dragon-like sage departed a thousand years ago, never to return,
Yet those who drew near the sacred realm all gained passage.
Gazing for qi, one finds only the old abode,
Who now builds lofty towers to transmit the sutras?
Ancient pines coil along the path where green lizards rest,
Waters encircle the long forest, flowing like jade.
At dusk, I ascend the southern peak to gaze afar—
Where wild mist clears, lush greenery grows thick.

**Matching the Rhyme of Master Yiqing’s Poem on Traveling to Louguan**
*Guo Zeshan*

The sagely learning of the Dao crowns the nine provinces,
Imperial envoys and noble steeds gather the finest minds.
With purified heart, I dream of entering the land of Huaxu,
Wielding my brush to inscribe poems on the White Jade Tower.
The thatched pavilion shelters the true, exuding purple qi,
The Sutra Terrace leans on bamboo, overlooking the Yellow River’s flow.
Lingering, I grasp the delight of the invitation—
The Silver River’s fragrant winds rustle the dense osmanthus groves.

**Again**
*Wei Zhiyi*

Once I followed the immortal’s retinue to seek the sacred realm,
Delighted to enter the Pure Capital for a triumphant journey.
Wind carries the sound of springs to my midday pillow,
After rain, mountain hues fill the sunny tower.
Through the ages, sages and worthies revere the transformation of the Dao,
When will mist and rosy clouds belong to the feathered ones?
At dusk, I turn from the high terrace to look back—
Emerald clouds deeply lock the dense, tangled peaks.

**Again**
*Li Daoqian*

How many times have I come to the alchemical palace, my enthusiasm unspent,
Leaning on my staff, I return for another visit.
White clouds deeply seal the furnace for refining cinnabar,
Verdant mists rise high before the Qi-Gazing Tower.
Mountain birds cry as they fly through wild bamboo,
Rock flowers scatter, drifting with the stream’s flow.
Since the blue ox departed, where has it gone?
Only the lush green grass remains before the gate.

**Ascending the Sutra Terrace**
*Xie Xiyi*

From on high, I survey the diminished land of Qin,
Rain-washed rivers and mountains renew like a painted scroll.
Purple qi once obscured the moon over Hangu Pass,
The pure wind ever admires the man of the thatched tower.
The blue ox’s divine elixir—where did it gallop away?
Ancient cypresses pierce the clouds, heedless of spring.
Alone in the western pavilion, I ponder the past—
Fallen blossoms lie scattered, bird calls come frequently.

**Again**
*The Mountain Man of Juqu*

A thousand years since the sutras were preached, the terrace remains,
The white deer ascended to the void, never to return.
Only the green mountains endure as before,
Facing the gate like an unfolding painted screen.

**Revisiting the Sutra Terrace**
*Kou Yuande*

A thousand-year site for discoursing on the Dao,
Mist and rosy clouds veil the jade shoulders.
Returning, I feel as if across lifetimes,
A single glance dissolves all form.
Ancient cypresses bristle with fresh verdure,
Stalwart steles gather old scriptures.
Gazing blankly at the dusty world,
I am but a drifting duckweed.

**The Sutra Terrace**
*Wen Daoguang*

Mountain flowers and birds thrive through all seasons,
From the terrace, mist and rosy clouds shine for a thousand miles.
This is the meaning beyond the words of the Primordial One—
Who can perceive it with their eyes and listen without sound?

**Again**
*Sun Dehuo*

The Daoist teachings grandly open the gates of myriad wonders,
The fundamental principles reside in the Five Thousand Characters.
How fortunate this body to wander the sacred precincts,
Often ascending the Sutra Terrace to pay homage to the Dao Lord.

**Louguan**
*Li Tongyin*

Towering ancient cypresses shade the star altar,
The spacious hall’s beams and pillars nestle amid purple and green.
My ears have never heard worldly affairs,
Raising my head, I always see clouds and mountains.
The Sutra Terrace stands amid ancient, intertwined woods,
The alchemical furnace lies empty in the idle glow of sunset.
Since the blue ox’s western departure,
No more purple qi has entered Hangu Pass.

**Again**
*Liu Yuanding*

Purple qi from the east once illuminated Qin,
Tall and proud, the thatched eaves rise above the grass.
By chance, the transmission of the Dao met the Keeper of the Pass,
Ever do I recall the Dragon-like Master of Guang Sang.
A single hairpin of gray marks the beginning of the primordial,
The blue ox of a myriad miles separates the world’s chaos.
No common weeds grow on the terrace’s soil,
At night, I hear mountain spirits reciting the mysterious texts.

**Again**

The profound discourse secretly imparted to the Keeper of Hangu,
For ten thousand ages, a thatched tower on Zhongnan.
Hills and valleys remain, though the world has changed,
Beyond the misty pines, the blue ox lingers.

**The Cypress Tied to the Ox**
*Zhao Renju*

The Primordial One seized a single gray dragon,
Transforming it into a cypress through the Sage’s power.
Old branches, twisted like an aged ox, still sprawl,
Dense leaves, veiled in mist, hang thick and hazy.
Ever verdant, it holds the virtue of enduring cold,
Lush and flourishing, as if steeped in the wind of virtue’s teaching.
I only fear that when observed, a fierce storm may arise,
Its wrath following thunderbolts into the distant sky.

**Inscribed in the Qixiu Pavilion**
*Ma Shaoting*

The ancient Louguan on Zhongnan,
Gilded and azure, stands towering and grand.
At dusk, cinnabar furnaces darken in the mist,
From the Sutra Terrace, the autumn moon shines bright.
Mountains and rivers bear no worldly air,
Pines and bamboos possess a pure sound.
The guest of Qixiu Pavilion,
Wanders through this life, content.

**Ascending the Sutra Terrace**
*Wang Zan*

A single path emerges from the verdant green,
Suddenly, I stand far beyond the dust.
Birds cry, the mountain grows still,
Moss is slippery, the mist begins to lift.
The elixir is ripe, the furnace holds no fire,
The sutras endure, the terrace stands near.
Hesitating, I turn my steps,
Taking up my brush to record this return.

**Ascending the Sutra Terrace, Matching the Rhyme of Master Yuju**
*Lu Chudao*

The refined Wang and Xie clans listen to such as these,
How could the great craftsman ever discard the unskilled?
Four hundred meritorious officials, two historians—
Xiao and Cao seemed to understand the discourse on emptiness.

**Again**

For whom do the rivers and mountains, twice as strong, stand mighty?

**For the Earth Spirit, Studying the Day’s Work**
To the Sutra Terrace I turn my gaze—
Han’s cultural legacy lies in overgrown grass, stretching into the void.

**The Towering Abodes**
*Jia Wenyu*

A jeweled hall coils round the Purple Ultimate Palace,
Before its gates, waters murmur past bronze dragons.
On the ruined terrace, ancient seals preserve lost decrees,
While aged cypress and towering brambles trace the Way’s footprints.
For ten *li*, grotto chambers roof themselves in cloud,
On all sides, stone walls bristle like sword blades.
Deep in the night, my couch settles into stillness—
Then the bell of the Court of Morning Ascent tolls once more.

**The Sutra Terrace**
The Dao’s ocean has collapsed; who can stem the raging tide?
This terrace alone may yet dam the flood.
Since the Unsullied King departed, culture has perished—
Where in this world can one find another Apricot Altar?

**Revisiting the Towering Abodes**
*Ma Shaoting*

Why did the Blue Ox suddenly turn west?
Yet the Qi-Watching Tower on Zhongnan stood first.
A thousand years of sacred truth met in perfect accord,
Two scrolls of *Dao* and *Virtue* left as legacy.
Before the terrace, emerald jades gleam, old and new,
Within the grotto, cinnabar sands cycle through spring and autumn.
Today, climbing again, I clear my heart and mind—
Thickets fall away, revealing the seclusion of cypress and pine.

**Inscribed at the Towering Abodes**
*Gao Shu*

The scripture-transmitting sage has vanished into the void,
Yet the old cypress still stands, defiant against the frost.
How many times has the world changed, surviving the fires of kalpas?
The furnace lies cold—no elixir remains to be found.
Here, the land shrinks the northeast’s Qin plain,
While the mountains link westward to Shu’s perilous paths.
I should tell the master, though he may only laugh—
Another in a long line of gray-haired scholars, no different from Deng.

**Again**
*Sun Zhai*

Cinnabar turtles merge with moss,
The Sutra Terrace drowns in grass and trees.
South Mountain has witnessed a thousand ages,
Yet still it rises, lush and verdant.

**The Towering Abodes**
*Zhang Haogu*

The secret hall looms, veiled in emerald mist,
Seeking truth, I chance upon a grotto-heaven.
Where is the Blue Ox now, so silent?
The Elixir Well remains, though how many ages have passed?
Gazing at qi is futile—how can one recapture the past?
Yet the transmission of scriptures still evokes those years.
Who now inherits the Dragon’s heart-teachings?
Only the Quanzhen school holds the true transmission.

**The Sutra Terrace**
*Purple qi arrives from the east, expounding two scriptures,*
*The true wind spreads through the ages, reaching the ends of the earth.*
*Though its roots run deep and its stem stands firm, the text is spare,*
*Its meaning most profound—governing the state, cultivating the self.*
*The sacred realm remains unchanged by the dust of the world,*
*The holy scriptures rejoice, their jade keys still gleaming green.*
*Beyond the lofty pavilion lies a grotto of mist and clouds—*
*Yet even this must yield to the old immortal of Huayang, exiled to earth.*

**Inscribed at the Louguan Temple**
*Zhang Lidào*

*Grand seal-script steles dappled with green moss,*
*Towering pavilions rise like the Three Terraces.*
*The ancient cypress where the ox was struck still stands with gnarled branches,*
*The cold spring for elixir-smelting flows from the Kan trigram’s well.*
*Mist veils Yin Xi’s Hall of the Primordial Beginning,*
*Clouds shroud Laozi’s Sutra Terrace.*
*How rare for mortal flesh to encounter such a sacred site—*
*I wonder if I’ve wandered here in a dream of immortals.*

**The Aspiring Pavilion**
*The Aspiring Pavilion opens, stirring many emotions,*
*Green and towering, the hues of Mount Zhongnan.*
*Weary thoughts dissolve in a pillow of millet dreams,*
*Only to be disturbed again by the demon of poetry.*

**Inscribed at the Sutra Terrace**
*Lin Junyi*

*How splendid is the flourishing of Mount Zhongnan!*
*Divine herbs guard the ascent to the Heavenly Terrace.*
*In those days, beholding the purple qi manifest,*
*The Blue Ox indeed came from the eastern lands.*
*Mist and clouds drift, halting the immortal’s chariot,*
*Jade scrolls gleam, leaving behind treasures of jade.*
*Suddenly riding a cinnabar phoenix back to the azure void,*
*How often does one see the seas turn to flying dust?*

*The ancient cypress revives, living a thousand years anew,*
*Its dense shade shelters the opening of the Mysterious Gate.*
*The Poet of the Slope inscribed his praise on emerald stone—*
*I come to brush away the moss, awakening its verdant glow.*
*The transmission of scriptures need not wait for intent to fade,*
*Why then do later generations doubt and speculate?*
*Gazing upon these unmatched rivers and mountains,*
*My breast swells at once with towering thoughts.*

*Autumn mist lingers as the day darkens,*
*I smile in vain, pacing to and fro.*

**On the "Laozi Crossing the Pass" Painting**
*Tradition holds that the depiction in the "Laozi Crossing the Pass" painting is inaccurate. After consulting ancient records to correct it, I commissioned Yao Anren to paint it anew. The jade-like brilliance of his work was shared with all quarters, and for his precise and vigorous brushwork, I composed "Mountain Repose" as a gift.*

*Zhu Xiangxian*

*The Blue Ox departs westward through the pass,*
*A thousand years mark this numinous omen.*
*Yet how did this image come to be transmitted,*
*Its forms and rites straying from the original intent?*
*It has long been a source of disdain for the discerning,*
*And a weight of shame for those who follow.*
*Lofty stands the terrace of Mount Zhongnan,*
*Where the transmission of the Dao left its traces.*
*All quarters call it the compass of guidance—*
*The true tune must lie here.*

*I sought to have the portrait redrawn,*
*And by chance encountered the hermit Yao.*
*For three days he pondered in stillness,*
*Then with a single stroke, all was perfected.*
*The mountains and rivers recall the Xiao and Han passes,*
*The robes and caps evoke the Zhou dynasty.*
*The sage and the true one rejoice in their meeting,*
*The qi of the Dao fills heaven and earth.*
*To open the gate of purity and stillness,*
*To sober the world from its drunken stupor.*
*Again he declined, then advanced once more,*
*Revealing the rites of that time in full clarity.*
*The painted folds seem not mere depiction—*
*I suspect I stand beside him in person.*

*How profound is your grasp of the celestial mechanism!*
*The wondrous peaks and valleys within your breast*
*Flow as hidden beauty from your brush’s tip.*
*Should Zhang [Zao] and Wu [Daozi] alone claim*
*The beauty of the painter’s art?*
*Let this treasure be scattered across the seas,*
*To rival the splendor of three thousand years.*
*Its name will endure like metal and stone,*
*And this shall be its beginning.*

**Inscribed at the Hall of Silent Harmony**
*Zhang Guangwei*

*The Great Dao is not transmitted through speech or silence,*
*Why then does purple cloud reveal the profound mystery?*
*In that time, it relied on wordless teaching—*
*Yet five thousand words were plucked from the page.*

**Farewell to Master Yixu**
*Du Nangu*

*The immortal of Hailing, Master Yixu,*
*With square pupils and dark temples, remains thus ageless.*
*In his breast, a single point of heaven and earth’s truth,*
*His pure qi overwhelms, surpassing autumn waters.*

*Long ago, I was your guest at Yanran,*
*Hanging my sword at Changchun, we chanced to meet.*
*Parting, you laughed and pointed to the Terrace of Gold,*
*Then turned west, crossing beyond the Han Pass.*
*Purple qi floated above Mount Zhongnan,*
*As you rode the Blue Ox, resting on the earth’s breast.*
*Mist and clouds, gibbons and cranes vied to welcome you—*
*I wondered if the Primordial One had met Wen Shi.*

*The cinnabar peaks and the Louguan Temple still stand,*
*I stroke the ancient cypress, drunk with age.*
*From now on, I resolve the unresolved,*
*But speak not of past matters to the men of this age.*

*Now is as ancient, ancient as now—*
*What difference is there between heaven and the human realm?*
*No need to hasten to ascend Kunlun,*
*Dwell carefree in the world of mortals for now.*

*One day, I too shall journey west,*
*To share a seat at the Sutra Terrace and collate the profound teachings.*

*The Purple Clouds of the Ancient Louguan Temple: Volume Two, Concluded.*
