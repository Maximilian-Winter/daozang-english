# 唐嵩高山启母庙碑铭

**Inscription on the Stele of the Qimu Temple at Mount Songgao in the Tang Dynasty**

*Composed by Cui Rong, Gentleman for Court Service and Academician of the Hongwen Pavilion*

I have heard that the generation and completion of Heaven and Earth follow the principle of spontaneity, which is called the Dao; the interplay of yin and yang, whose workings are unfathomable, is called the divine. Thus, when things resonate by kind, and affairs transform through correspondence, the celestial pillar may tilt and the Three Luminaries flee northward; the earthly chariot may fracture, and the hundred rivers rush eastward. The Yellow River submerged Yuejun, turning its towns into fish; the waters engulfed Liyang, transforming its officials into turtles. Inquiring after traces in the Gorge of Women, one finds only desolation in wind and rain; seeking past events at the Spring of the Aunt, one hears the bright strains of zither and song. Fullness and emptiness are never fixed; union and dispersal are ever constant.

Who can fathom how Laozi, though aged, was moved by emotion and suddenly became human? Or how Jia Yi, though eloquent, gazed up and down, discerning only the causes of the hidden and manifest, tracing origins to ends, yet never exhausting the discourse on life and death? To gain the Dao and lose it—this is the inevitable pattern; to emerge from the mechanism and return to it—this is the unceasing principle. He who understands transformation—does he not know the workings of the divine?

I have carefully examined the Qimu Temple: it is dedicated to the mother of Xia Hou Qi. During the Han Dynasty, to avoid the taboo of Emperor Jing’s name, the character *qi* (启) was replaced with *kai* (开), and later generations transmitted it as *Kaimu* (开母). Yet Gu Yewang’s *Records of Geography* and Lu Yuanming’s *Annals of Mount Songgao* failed to observe this taboo, instead regarding her as a woman of Yangdi, an account so unorthodox that a single reading offers no merit.

Consider the jade dipper and the moving stars—Li Mu’s dwelling lay near the North Pole; the golden terrace and stone chamber—Wang Mu’s abode stood in the Western Mountains. Qi becomes mother, and all things sprout; the sun becomes mother, and its radiance illuminates all; the earth becomes mother, and above and below harmonize; the sovereign becomes mother, and the state achieves completion. Thus, Huaxu trod near and the Fuxi clan was conceived; Nü Deng perceived the divine, and the Yan dynasty arose; stars streamed over Hua Isle, and the White Emperor was born; the moon pierced the dark chamber, and the Black Essence descended.

How illustrious was the Xia dynasty! How reverent was Mount Kun! I wed at the hour of the earth’s division; the woman married at the land of Tai Sang. Searching the *Imperial Annals* for marvels and gleaning wonders from the *Guicang*, I bound reeds to dispel ignorance and found enlightenment, while Han Zi extolled virtue that never perished. The brush of Han ministers flowed like rivers and seas, recording her illustrious name; the single word of the Qin minister was worth a thousand gold, praising her auspicious response.

Songs of the southern lands tell only of Hou Yu’s verses; the stone of the north finally revealed the omen of Sheng Yu. Thus, Guo Pu spoke of the Qimu Stone west of Yangcheng, and Li Tong of the Qimu Shrine south of Mount Song. The words of Suichao were verified, and the promises of *Huainanzi* proved unerring.

Of old, on the banks of the Luanshui, a mother transformed into an empty mulberry; by the waters of Tun, a boy was born from split bamboo. The rainbow of the beauty was named *lalian*; the moon of the immortal woman became a toad. Jingwei carried twigs to avenge her grievance; the corpse of the woman turned to grass and became alluring. The mountains collapsed on the Shu Road, and the terrace awaited a wife who never returned; the stone stood in Wuchang, and the pavilion watched for a husband who never came.

In matters of birth and succession, none among the masses surpasses the emperors and kings; in matters of change and transformation, none among the common folk is renowned for such marvels. How splendid! Yet words fail to describe it.

The Great Tang cast off the old and embraced the new, arising with the mandate and continuing Heaven’s work. Grasping the primal force of Qian, it shaped all things, and the realm knew spring; cleaving the chaos to forge a domain, it left nothing beyond its bounds. The Heavenly Emperor received the calendar, his reign harmonizing with the pivot of time. Golden tablets and jade slabs recorded the achievements of Wen and Wu; thoroughfares and temples inherited the glorious deeds of ancestors. Clad in robes, he became the supreme sovereign, facing north in solemn dignity; bearing the auspicious tortoise, he received the feudal lords, turning southward in majesty.

The Zhou state flourished, its Dao harmonizing with Cheng and Kang; the Han house stood grand, its culture resonating with Wen and Jing. From the eastern shores to the western reaches, distant lands were pacified and near ones were awed. For three years, the seas remained calm; for months on end, clouds lingered undispersed. Heavenly omens descended; earthly portents ascended. The numinous phoenix, adorned with five patterns, came to the parks and gardens in due season; the divine dragon, marked with the eight trigrams, played in the ponds and marshes at dawn and dusk.

What need was there for the courtesies of bowing and yielding? This was the true meaning of music—transforming customs and mores. The Controller of Fortune increased wealth, and households and states abounded; the Controller of Lifespans extended years, and subjects and people were spared early death. The enlightened king, ever mindful of three fears, never neglected caution; the Son of Heaven, surrounded by four neighbors, could not fully employ their harmonious counsel.

Households thrived in their occupations, heeding only the crowing of neighboring roosters; people lived in harmony, becoming like deer in the wild. Prognostications were inscribed, and the *Hetu* was presented—forty-six events were made manifest; how could one desire more? He ascended Mount Tai and performed the feng sacrifice on Liangfu—seventy-two seals were recognizable; what could surpass this?

Moreover, to exhaust the divine and sagely, to perfect virtue and power, to nurture the primordial qi, and to inaugurate the Great Beginning—this was how the Heavenly Sovereign responded to Heaven. To honor the land and manifest the divine, to mount six feathers and ascend, to traverse the nine provinces and descend—this was how the Human Sovereign followed humanity. To create writing and teach hunting and fishing, to harmonize the five planets and regulate the four seasons, to ascend the nine heavens and categorize the myriad things—this was how the Sovereign Fuxi established human laws. To devote himself to cultivation and embrace change, to taste herbs to save the multitudes, to gather goods and exchange them across the realm—this was how the Sovereign Shennong promoted human benefit. To beat the Kui drum and raise the dragon banner, to receive the talisman from the Dark Maiden of Heaven and the Dipper from the Yellow Spirit—this was how the Sovereign Xuanyuan eradicated human harm.

Equalizing measures and standardizing weights, rectifying capitals and cities—summoning autumn’s mandate under the Metal Heaven, apportioning auspicious offices through the Phoenix’s cycles—this was how Emperor Haoshi established the human standard.

Purifying sacrifices and honoring the spirits, treading the seasons to emulate Heaven, nurturing wealth to employ Earth—this was how Emperor Zhuanxu instituted human teachings.

Autumn riding horses, spring riding dragons, aligning with the Three Luminaries to balance Heaven’s Dao, establishing the Five Norms to order human affairs—this was how Emperor Xinshi governed humanity.

Radiant as the sun, obscure as the shade, with no one knowing his name, the people asking, “What power has the emperor over us?”—this was how Emperor Yao illuminated sovereign virtue.

Hearing one good deed, elevating eight talents, the emperor’s song stirring the stars to brilliance, Heaven’s melody moving the tracks of birds and beasts—this was how Emperor Shun displayed the sovereign’s merit.

The Three Sequences are the greatness of the Dao, the Five Phases the origin of life. The Three Sovereigns modeled them to array the world, the Five Emperors followed them to bring order. The Dao arose through the Three, virtue stood through the Five—who but the utmost sage of the world could master both?

Yet even then, though blessed, they did not rest, diminishing further and further, issuing bright edicts, proclaiming virtuous decrees, revering Heaven and valuing humanity, inspecting the regions and conducting imperial tours. They summoned the stars in their courses, trailed the tips of clouds, called the Wind Earl to clear the dust, commanded the mountain spirits to guard the fields. Racing to Luoyi, galloping to Xiangcheng, Heaven turned and Earth wandered, clouds gathered and mists vanished. When King Mu of Zhou came to roam Mount Tai, he first visited the dwelling of Xia Qi; when Emperor Wu of Han performed rites at Songgao, he inquired after the stone of Sì Kāi.

One sees only that the cinnabar and azure of the years have grown ancient, frost and dew have eroded the passing years. The sagely heart stirs, and words arise to renovate. This mountain is the outer square of ancient script, this land the central realm of the new capital. The inscribed altar winds sinuously, obliquely dividing the Terrace of the Jade Maidens; stele towers and gate-turrets stand in mutual gaze, facing the shrine of the Stone Men.

Golden grasses grow in five colors, cowrie trees bear triple blossoms. Purple clouds merge in the ravines, white mists swirl upon the peaks. Consulting the *Forest of Changes*, one confirms this is where the divine abide; seeking the *Divine Strategies*, one finds awe-inspiring numen undiminished.

Thus, the emperor commanded his officials to seize the moment, leveraging heights and lowlands, examining the remnants of crumbling foundations, surveying the sun and stars to assess the ruins of collapsed structures. The *Zhou Officials* set the plumb lines, the master craftsmen wielded their axes—with divine skill and wondrous motion, they preserved the mold of creation. Crimson blossoms outshone the sun, flying terraces soared between the mountains; iron chains braved the wind, winding galleries perched at the treetops. Immortals dwelled in the rafters, divine maidens leaned from the windows. The eaves were inlaid with tortoiseshell, the roofs covered with glass tiles. Vermilion jade paved the paths, yellow gold formed the gates and towers.

The mountains resembled white banks, the trees like green streams. Delicacies and herbs adorned the front courts, fresh hay lined the rear paths. Orchids’ fragrance flanked the waters, serving as ablution’s resource; bamboo brooms faced the wind, naturally warding off the harshness of dust and clamor. The Terrace of Dreams and Clouds and Rain—Song Yu gazed and was first startled; the Chu Jade Mountain—Qu Yuan wrote and nearly wearied.

The eaves of the Longevity Palace remained undisturbed, the symbolic figures stood even more solemn. Frost-silk trailed gracefully, lotus-patterned brocade draped loosely. Mandarin-duck mattresses, kingfisher quilts, white-feather fans, green-silk slippers. Jade orioles hung from their belts, seeming to move yet still; gold sparrows adorned their hairpins, neither long nor short.

In their dwellings, dim and dusky, yin closed and yang opened. In their attire, resplendent and luminous, clouds and dawn mingled in radiance. Tripods and platters held unicorn fetuses and phoenix eggs, black orchids burned fragrantly. Their feasts offered wood honey and golden paste, jade nectar and crystal wine.

At such times, the Five Peaks were united, the Nine Chiefs questioned, the Great Yin selected, the Dark Pass commanded. Feng Yi beat the drums, Nü Wa sang clearly. On the left, the Azure Dragon blew the curtain; on the right, the White Tiger strummed the zither. Golden immortals brushed the seats, jade maidens burned incense. With solemn rustling, the Heavenly Maidens brought wind and rain; in swirling snow and mist, divine ladies descended with frost and snow.

Peacocks flew and phoenixes danced—Yong Yu sought joy; chariots met and silks were spread—Zhi Qiong attended the banquet. Ma Gu embraced the Dao, transforming the sea to come and roam; Shi Fu admired the wind, filling the river ford to descend and pay homage. The Luo Consort was graceful, the Jiang Consort ethereal. The Dark Maiden used the bright moon as her pearl, the Plain Maiden piled clouds into her hair. The True Mother of the Nine Heavens, the Ladies of the Eight Poles—all gathered here.

Clad in azure mist-garments and kingfisher-feather robes, the spirits coiled and lingered. Chariots turned with the wind, horses raced like lightning—glimpsed in an instant, then gone from sight.

Long ago, at the foot of Mount Jiyin, the essence of Yao’s mother descended; by the bend of the Xiang River, the echo of Shun’s consort remained. Though the altar of Sui may still exist, one hears only the name of its divided blessings; though the halls may not have decayed, who can distinguish the place of the *An Song*? Yet who knew that this land of the Three Immortals’ blessed realm, this shrine revered by the hundred clans, nestled within the imperial capital’s domain, aligned with the sagely movements of the world? Sacrificial animals, jades, and silks could harmonize qi and unite with the spirits; young women and grandsons could unfold texts and engage in discourse. Reverently upholding the imperial decree, they displayed the grand spectacle. Though the people of Zhou composed poems extolling the beauty of their queens, and the ministers of Wei presented rhapsodies, they ultimately paled before the craft of the divine maidens.

Thus, I dare to inscribe this eulogy:

The Nine Provinces’ terrain is perilous,
The Five Peaks stand at Heaven’s center.
Dragons’ caves and grottoes,
Sun and moon’s immortal palaces.
Storing and releasing clouds and mist,
Shaking and stirring thunder and wind.
Pipes and songs draw near,
Bells and drums echo afar.

Long ago, under the mother of Gaoxin,
Hongquan’s spring had not yet been sealed.
The drowning people below,
Flooded the Central Kingdom.
How glorious was Great Yu,
Manifesting Heaven’s true virtue!
Dragons’ designs branched forth,
Conch scripts were carved in haste.
Adorning his robes, he tamed the seas,
Surveying the lands to the south.
Returning past Jieshi,
He descended again at Tai Sang.

I took a wife with propriety, and our capital flourished.
For eight years I turned away, for four I let matters lie fallow.
Then ascending Wanwei, I halted the work on the axle-pin.
My household, mistakenly setting forth, found the bear’s den already stirring.
The Dao of Heaven is dark and hidden, life’s course tangled and rough.
Yet transformation shifts, and numinous spirits find their abode.
In the palace of the Mysterious Consort, on the terrace of the Divine Maidens,
All things commune in resonance, and essences come and go.
The shrine on Mount Wu stands, the temple on the Han River opens.
Ancient altars endure through the years, while halls and roofs crumble with time.

How august is Great Tang, how radiant its divine sageliness!
Responding to the chart and receiving the mandate, it embodies the origin and occupies the center.
Resplendent was Gaozu, for Heaven had decreed its charge.
Illustrious was Taizong, whose glory reached its zenith here.
Successive brilliance and repeated blessings, the martial line inherits culture.
Bearing the imperial regalia, it transforms; draped in robes, it rules.
The Three Spirits harmonize in sweetness, the Six Qi blend in mist.
Fish and turtles all submit, phoenixes and hounds call to one another.
Distant envoys seek audience, foreign lands receive the calendar.
Transformation extends through sincerity, and the great simplicity’s winds shift.
Heaven ordains the hundred rites—people harmonize, the myriad joys arise.
The Fen River may be traversed, but Kunlun’s peaks remain remote.
The old tales of Suiren, the former dwellings of Xia Qi—
Their great virtue never fades, their fine renown lives on in the bamboo annals.
The Zhou king turned his chariot, the Han emperor returned his carriage.
Ever mindful of descending to inspect, their sacrifices remained as before.
Forestry officials oversaw the timber, craftsmen repaired the halls.
Rainbows spanned the plum-wood beams, dragons coiled round the cassia pillars.
Grasses overgrew the courtyards, waters encircled the hall’s steps.
The stone chambers were peerless, the pavilions and palaces stood in support.
Pearl curtains rolled open like caves, the jade throne held purity within.
Gold and kingfisher gleamed, silk and valleys shimmered lightly.
Forms seemed to stir, attendants and guards appeared to come to life.
Something lingered in the glow, while prayers and invocations fell silent.

The Emperor’s daughter by the Xiang River, the Celestial Granddaughter by the Han’s banks—
Flitting and floating, hesitating and lingering.
The Divine Maiden plays with pearls, the Numinous Consort opens jade.
Suddenly they come, suddenly they go, swift as shooting stars or lightning’s flash.
How magnificent, how splendid—may the spirits heed this!
Wisdom and clarity are entrusted to them, and glorious blessings never deceive.

The lady established the hall, the young woman inscribed the words.
Majestic is the imperial house, its foundations ten thousand times ten thousand.
Here ends the brick inscription of Tang’s Songgao Mountain Qimu Temple.
