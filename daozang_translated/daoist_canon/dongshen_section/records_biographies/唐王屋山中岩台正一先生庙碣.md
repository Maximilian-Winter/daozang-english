**Stele Inscription for Master Zhengyi of Zhongyan Terrace on Wangwu Mountain of the Tang Dynasty**
*Composed by Wei Yantan, Recorder of the Left Guard of the Imperial Insignia*

The so-called "immortals of the ranks" in antiquity grasped the Great Completion to govern the natural, roamed the boundless to attain deathlessness, traversed the myriad wonders to ascend to the Great Origin. Their traces emerged from the Mysterious Origin, were perfected by the Celestial Master, and fully expounded in the Simplicity and Tranquility, detailed in the *Zhenbai*.

Those who attained the Dao of *Zhenbai* ascended daily into the Mystery; the Mystery was transmitted to the Embodiment of the Mystery. Since the Three Perfected dwelled in heaven, the multitude of teachings lacked a master. The handle of the Dao’s governance must fall to someone.

Did Heaven appoint Perfected Master Sima as its wooden clapper? If not, how could the numinous tally of the Mystery so swiftly align? The revered master’s clan bore the surname Sima, dwelling for generations in Wen and Jin of Pengcheng. Descended from the royal house of Wang, he was the grandson of the attendant to the military governor of Chen, and the son of Ren Zui, the two successive prefects of Xiang and Hua in our imperial dynasty.

The illustrious lineage of the Yellow Emperor and Elijah spans generations—this is called a noble succession. When loyal worthies emerge in succession, extraordinary individuals must arise. Thus, Master Zi’a’s kindness and wisdom, like that of Xu the Perfected in his descent, and his early cultivation of compassion, akin to Lord Mao’s ascent to the Dao, were not without cause.

The master’s religious name was *Daoyin*, his courtesy name *Ziwei*, and his Dharma name *Dao Yin*. Born speaking, he understood the Dao in childhood. Heaven bestowed upon him an extraordinary countenance and the true nature of an immortal—this was the great essence of age and vigor. Drawing it forth, it became the inner learning of Yang and Xu; silently preserving it, he purified his conduct, elevated his virtue, and his understanding penetrated the subtlest mysteries. His thoughts entered the utmost emptiness, and critics said his unseen wings could not be bent to worldly ends.

At twenty-one, he first donned the hempen cap and robe to enter the Dao, becoming a disciple of Master *Tixuan*, a recluse of the Central Marchmount. The revered master’s spirit was concentrated and his use serene; his emotions were sifted and affairs discarded. His integrity was unassailable, his diligence tireless. Master *Tixuan* thus regarded him with profound esteem.

One day, he transmitted to our revered master the *Golden Root Upper Scripture*, the *Secret Records of the Three Caverns*, the deeds of Xu the Perfected, and the subtle principles of Master Tao. With lofty comprehension and unique attainment, the master’s emptiness merged with the great penetration. He elucidated the true Dao, moving in and out of the profound mysteries.

Once, he dreamed of a phoenix and crow bearing a seal, placing it upon his Dharma table. The inscription read: *"Conferred upon you as the Perfected of the Upper Clarity of Eastern Florescence."* Thereafter, he treasured his longevity, refined his conduct, listened to the *qi*, and rested in the heels. After seven days, he transcended external things; after three months, he forgot his form; after a year, he roamed in non-being.

Moreover, he chiseled paths to conceal his hidden traces—not to respond to things; he sang wildly to cultivate his inner practice—not to teach others; he displayed wondrous arts to dazzle the foolish—not to preserve the true.

He reclined in lowly positions to conceal his bearing—not to transcend the world. Thus, the Venerable Master devoted himself to propagating the Dao without hindering its function, ever excelling in salvation without settling in one place. He entered the imperial court to pay homage to the sagely sovereign, where the nine-fold gates received him with the reverence due to Guangcheng; he emerged to respond to the worthy of the age, as the assembled lords vied to seek his counsel. Therefore, his conduct knew no bounds, his deeds left no trace; he received with emptiness to achieve all obliquely, illumined widely to animate the ten thousand things.

At times, external omens stirred his movements; at others, inner discipline sealed his gates. Sometimes he dwelt in seclusion, secretly consorting with the host of Perfected; sometimes he ascended in darkness, stealthily traversing the upper realms—such was his unfathomable depth. Later, he wandered Mount Juqu, pacing the heavens of Huayang; he roosted in the paulownia and wutong groves, entering the cavern of Lingxu. He sought the great Mount Huo, gathering the fruit of the Golden Vase; he ascended Mount Heng, peering into the mysteries of Stone Rub. There, mountain spirits offered herbs, Heavenly Perfected bestowed scriptures, fierce beasts guarded the gates, and wild birds circled his seat—such wonders defy full recounting.

In the twelfth year of the Kaiyuan era, the Son of Heaven, in his enlightened court, sought to commune with the myriad spirits. He set forth his carriage upon the Fen River, summoning the Four Masters, and thus invited the Venerable Master into the inner palace to receive the scriptures and methods of the Upper Clarity. Moreover, he established the Yangtai Abbey on Mount Wangwu as his residence. The Master, deeming Wangwu the heaven of Xiaoyou, the palace of the assembled Perfected, a place of secluded majesty where gods and spirits gathered in splendor, thought: *"If the Dao is to be practiced, where could it not thrive?"* With a turn of flight and a step taken, he resolved to make it his final abode.

Further, at the northwest height of the abbey, where the terrain reached its utmost extremity, he discovered the Central Rock Terrace. Above, it aligned with the Great Altar; below, it encircled the great mound. Mighty trees embraced it in a ring, while the murmuring streams of the Luo and the central valleys resounded. There, he nurtured dragons in the great ravines and reared cranes upon the central peaks. He burned the myriad incenses of the Golden Grotto and inhaled the fresh *qi* of the Stone Window—thus did he pass his days.

Earlier, while dwelling in seclusion, he had transcribed and compiled Daoist texts, producing the *Hidden Instructions for Ascending Perfection*. Yet many methods of cultivation therein remained fragmentary. The Venerable Master thus composed the *Secret Essentials of Cultivating Perfection* in twelve scrolls, which circulated in the world. As for his acts—unfolding the morning’s mysteries to present petitions, pacing the nocturnal altar to send forth memorials, averting the hidden might of the Three Officials, dispelling stale *qi* from the hundred ghosts—all served to exalt the imperial standard, dispelling the threats of war, flood, and drought; all purified the mortal realm, eradicating the scourges of mediocrity and pestilence. Such were the fruits of the Venerable Master’s power.

Having embraced the One and guarded stillness, he detailed the return of the Dao to its root; having refined his essence and reverted to the origin, he perfected the defense of riding the wind and treading *qi*. Thus could he roam at ease through creation, preserving the great harmony; observing transformations, he kept his heart in perfect equilibrium; governing yin and yang, he expanded his spirit into vastness. How could he, like the two primal forces, be bound to their turbid substance, or like the ten thousand transformations, be confined by their profusion and lose his pure spirit?

In the year *yihai*, on the eighteenth day of the sixth month, he turned to his attendants and said: *"I have received my appointment in the Dark Capital and may no longer remain."* Thereupon, he arranged his seals and prepared as if for a distant journey. As dusk fell, a crimson cloud coiled about him, brushing the earth as it approached. The sound of flutes rang clear, and he ascended into the void. All who witnessed it were astonished, certain he had attained transcendence. Rushing to his chamber, they found only his discarded form.

Twenty-one days later, his disciples gathered to mourn him upon the Pine Terrace in the northwest. They posthumously conferred upon him the title of Grand Master for Closing Court with Silver and Azure, bestowing the posthumous name *Zhenyi* ("True Unity"). They also erected a stele of his own composition to honor his legacy.

His disciples said: *"In this life, the Venerable Master had lived five hundred cycles of sixty years. His body was ever like a frost-laden pine, his heart like a bright mirror. He dwelt beyond sorrow and joy, lived without craving or desire. When he resided on Mount Song, pines sprouted upon the rear mound; when he moved to Terrace Ridge, a spring gushed from the eastern wall."*

When he dwelt in reclusion upon Mount Nanyue, black cranes blanketed the wilds; when he sat in forgetfulness upon this mountain, colored clouds filled his chamber. As for his lofty bearing and transcendent conduct, he closely resembled the Hua-yang Immortal; his sudden awakening to the great revival far equaled the embrace of simplicity. His skill in instruction and guidance he ever took as his own duty. Yet as for his nature and the Heavenly Dao, these could not be heard.

Rightly did he gallop through the wondrous gate and wield his blade within the true sovereign’s realm, surpassing profound virtue to share the world’s cares, proclaiming the ultimate principle to shield against the multitudes of falsehood. When he soared to the heights of ten thousand fathoms and roamed the four voids, those who congealed ice found their patterns aligned, and those who chased shadows found their hearts subdued. Alas! Was he not one of those ancients who ascended to heaven, wandered through mist, and never died?

Sima Gang, Registrar of Baoding County in Hedong Commandery and the Master’s nephew in spirit, savored the flavor of his secret teachings and wandered within the pure chamber. He defended the Daoist gate from insult and yearned for immortal affairs with upturned feet. Thus he expanded the old sleeping quarters and constructed a new temple, declaring that the numinous immortals were not false, and that his reverent offering had found its proper dwelling.

Yet when they erected the spirit tablet and performed the ancestral rites, they saw only the upturned eaves. The linked lotus towers and the towering pines stood emerald in the distance; ethereal echoes responded to the void. A halo of light illuminated the night—truly a divine marvel.

Now, those who attained the Dao in former times possessed wisdom as deep as rivers and seas, yet our Master was present everywhere. Their virtue stood as high as hills and mounds, yet our Master’s could not be measured. Thus he ascended to the Isles of the Blessed and left his fragrance in the annals of history. How could those who entered his gate capture his essence or embellish his glory?

In truth, the erection of a shrine manifests the way of the numinous, and the carving of stone initiates the propagation of the teaching. We cherish the legacy of the Master’s homeland and emulate the precedents of those who inscribed his deeds. As for the marvels of his writings, they are gathered in his collected works; the subtleties of his spiritual responses are preserved in his esoteric biography.

Thus I compose this eulogy:

Of the Great Primal’s chaos,
The upper realms stretch boundless.
The subtle and the responsive,
The soaring and the entrusted.
The Dao—how profound and mysterious!
Who could fathom or measure it?
Without a true artisan,
Who could craft its system?

O mighty true artisan,
Born to ride the turning of the ages,
Surpassing all that endures,
Concealed in namelessness.
First to emerge from the dark retreat,
The Dao’s re-enactment complete.
Adorning the great image,
Refining the essence of the mysterious.

What is this essence?
The ability to cultivate the wondrous body.
What is this great image?
The ability to diligently illuminate all.
Guiding later scholars,
Embellishing and bequeathing his teaching.
The lost find their way home,
The dawn’s light is universally reflected.
Following the Dao within,
Thus attaining the great Dao.
Ultimately abiding in its profundity,
Suddenly vanishing into nothingness.
The seven realms shine resplendent,
The hundred spirits hasten to serve.
Life depends on fate,
How long can this body endure?
Yet day by day, without waiting,
He inscribed his name among the immortals.
Succeeding the steps of Zhenbai,
Equal to Ming of Zhichuan.
Where did he untie his jade seal?
For how many years did his banner stand aloft?
Beneath the numinous temple,
We gaze emptily upon the grotto-heaven.

Here ends the stele inscription for the Temple of Master Kui of the Central Rock of Mount Wangwu, Orthodox Unity.
