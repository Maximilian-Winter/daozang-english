*The Supreme Perfection of the Primordial Chaos: A True Record*

During the Yin and Zhou dynasties, Lord Lao appeared and withdrew for over one or two hundred years. He regarded the heart as no-heart, the body as no-body, the Great Void as supreme, and preserving the true as treasure. He pondered the mysteries of the Gate of Heavenly Oneness and roamed beyond the Eight Wastelands. Inhaling and exhaling vital qi, he preserved unity with the One Spirit—neither small nor great, neither ugly nor fair—treating glory and rank as transient as straw. Thus, with the heart of no-heart and the body of no-body, he embraced heaven and earth and nurtured the myriad things.

The heart that is not a heart is vast. The body that is not a body is boundless. These principles are inexhaustible. Drawing from non-action, he enriched the state with the Dao and harmonized the people. Hence, during the reigns of Kings Cheng and Kang, the realm knew peace, and punishments fell into disuse.

When King Kang passed, his son Xia ascended as King Zhao. At that time, the Supreme Lord again commanded Lord Lao to enlighten the western lands—India, Yuezhi, Da Qin, Anxi, and Jibin. He bestowed upon King Zhao the esoteric script of the Eight Heavens, yet the king, believing himself to dwell in the course of nature and succeed the qi of the Five Emperors, mastered the workings of yin and yang but did not revere celestial patterns. Knowing the decline of Zhou, Lord Lao withdrew the celestial texts and retired to his homeland, intending to journey toward the Flowing Sands.

At that time, the western heavens concealed themselves in seclusion. To the north lay a land of extinction, ninety thousand li from Mount Kunlun, called the Land of Endless Extension. Its people stood forty feet tall, lived eight thousand years, and all possessed virtue and power. Lord Lao wished to follow them, speaking of returning to Kunlun.

In the first year of the Wuji era, on the *renwu* day of the fifth month in the *guichou* year, he harnessed a blue ox to a resplendent chariot and departed westward from Zhou. By then, the royal Way had waned, and governance and instruction had ceased. Thus, Qian Chengshu composed *The Hymn to Lord Lao*, saying:

Profound indeed was the Li clan, to bring forth such a sagely countenance. He delved into the mysteries of the abstruse, uniquely illuminating the subtle and divine. Embracing purity and holding fast to simplicity, he harbored treasures and concealed radiance. Expounding the One and revering antiquity, he served as the model for sages and the teacher of kings. Yet when Zhou declined and the Dao waned, his grand designs could no longer be proclaimed. Like the dragon in the first *nine*, he held aloft his resolve with boundless aspiration. In distant, remote winds, his illustrious reputation was forever transmitted.

Xue Daoheng likewise said:
*"Though these five peaks be small,
This realm of nine provinces is yet too narrow.
I shall ascend in lofty flight,
Transcending all in distant wandering.
The blue ox is already harnessed,
The purple qi arises first.
The gates of the Mysterious swing open,
The divine transformation flows in secret."*

**Discussion:**
Upon examining the classics and histories, it is found that before the Zhou and Qin dynasties, emperors and feudal lords used no reign titles, referring only to the first year, second year, and so on. Only in the time of Emperor Wen of Han were the titles *Zhongyuan* and *Houyuan* established, and it was during Emperor Wu’s reign that *Yuan Guang* and *Yuan Shuo* were first used. Yet according to the *Great Mystery Classic*, the *Explanations of the Knots*, the *Inner Explanations*, the *Inner Transmission of the Primordial*, and the *Preface to the Dao and Its Virtue*, Lord Lao descended in the first year of *Shanghuang* (a *dingmao* year) to serve as the Zhou’s teacher, and departed westward from Zhou in the first year of *Wuji* (a *guichou* year). This is one instance where Guiguzi, Master Guo, Celestial Master Zhang, and Lord Ge Xuan cited celestial reign titles to correspond with mortal eras. Had they not been true immortals who had attained the Dao, who could have thoroughly investigated such matters? The same applies to reign titles like *Kaihuang*, *Chiming*, *Zhuling*, and *Shanghe*—these are certainly not known to the common world.

Some say that "departing westward from Zhou" simply means resigning from office and returning home, after which he secretly crossed the Hangu Pass—it does not mean that while still serving Zhou, he openly journeyed west. At that time, Zhou’s capital was at Feng and Hao, with the pass to its east. Thus, the *Inner Transmission of the Primordial* states: *"When a sage passes through the capital, the roads are swept and incense burned to await the arrival of the celestial perfected."* If Zhou lay east of the pass, then the celestial perfected would be exiting the realm—how could it be called "entering"? From this, it becomes even clearer that Lord Lao set forth from Lai Xiang; this is certain.

Some say that "seeing Zhou’s decline" refers to the time of King Zhao, when governance and instruction had grown deficient. Yet various scriptures and treatises claim he crossed west during the reigns of Kings You, Li, Ping, or Jing—these are all forced interpretations, deeply mistaken. At that time, Lord Lao, riding in a chariot drawn by a blue ox and crowned with a thin wooden canopy, set forth westward with Master Wuji, Master Guigu, and Master Beiguo. Their path took them through the Hangu Pass, which lay twelve *li* south of Taolin County in Shanzhou, where the ruins of the old pass remain.

The pass prefect was named Yin Xi, courtesy name Gongwen. His father had fled the tyranny of King Zhou of Shang and secretly traveled to Qinzhou in Tianshui, where he eventually settled. Their ancestors had accumulated virtue and amassed goodness, and their blessings converged upon him, leading to his birth. His mother once dreamed in broad daylight of lightning encircling her body, and a tall figure instructed her to swallow it. Upon waking, her mouth was filled with a lingering sweetness. When he was born, twin beams of light like the sun flew about his side, illuminating the room, then vanished after some time. In his family’s courtyard, lotuses spontaneously bloomed from the earth, their colors vivid and bright. At birth, his eyes held the essence of the sun, his form tall and refined, his arms hanging past his knees, his bearing majestic with the countenance of a celestial being.

From youth, he loved studying the ancient classics and the *Book of Changes*, excelling in astronomy and esoteric apocrypha. Gazing upward and peering downward, nothing escaped his penetrating insight—even spirits and gods could not conceal their true forms from him. His magnanimity was extraordinary, and he paid no heed to conventional rites, his joy or sorrow never showing on his face. Embracing the Dao, he wandered freely, harboring the aspiration for distant travel. Later, he indeed traversed mountains and rivers, examining valleys and streams in detail. Wherever he spoke of a place, he knew it would become a site of transcendence. Thus, he built a thatched hut to cultivate the utmost Dao.

When King Kang heard of this, he appointed him a grandee. Because he observed the heavens from his thatched hut, his residence was named *Louguan* ("Lookout Tower"). Today, on the northern slopes of Mount Zhongnan in Yongzhou, within the boundaries of Zhengzuo County in Wenshan Village, stand the remnants of the thatched hut, the altar of benevolence, and the sacred halls—venerated and protected through the ages, they remain to this day.

At the time, the pass prefect practiced hidden virtue and sought no fame or recognition. Yet his reputation spread far, and the capital praised him, so he entered the Eastern Palace as a companion to the crown prince. By the time of King Zhao, he saw purple qi advancing westward from the east and knew a sage would soon pass through. Thus, he requested to be appointed prefect of the Hangu Pass. Using astrological signs, he intercepted travelers, saying: *"The yang numbers are exhausted, the nine stars are aligned, and this year and month together govern ninety days beyond their term. By the law, a sage should pass through the capital."* When the time came, he purified himself and meditated on the perfected, ordering the roads to be swept for forty *li* and incense burned along both sides to await the celestial perfected’s entry.

He had previously instructed the pass guard, Sun Jingyun: *"If anyone appears in unusual attire, resembling an ancient figure, riding a blue ox and a thin-planked chariot, do not allow them to pass."* On the *jiazi* day of the twelfth day of the seventh month in the *guichou* year, Lord Lao indeed arrived at the pass, riding in a white carriage drawn by a blue ox. The guard said: *"The prefect has given orders—may the venerable one kindly tarry a moment."* The guard then entered to report: *"Just now, an old man of venerable appearance, riding a blue ox and chariot, has come from the east seeking to cross the western pass."*

Yin Xi said: *"Good! The Dao has come now—I shall meet the sage!"* Immediately donning his official seal and sash, he went out to welcome him, offering the rites of a disciple and entreating him: *"May the venerable one deign to grace us with your presence."* Lord Lao declined, saying: *"I am but a poor, lowly old man, dwelling east of the pass with my fields to the west. I merely wish to gather firewood—why detain me? Pray, allow me to cross. I possess no virtue or power—why do you show such excessive respect? This is most mistaken."* Lord Lao spoke thus in humility, testing him further, unwilling to reveal himself at first—this was one trial.

Yin Xi bowed again and said: *"How could the venerable one be gathering firewood? I beg you, deign to stay a while."*

Lord Lao spoke again: *"I have heard that in Jambudvīpa there dwells an ancient master, skilled in entering non-action, without end or beginning, eternally abiding in continuity. Thus, I ascended to seek the Dao and passed through this pass. Some say: ‘I have heard that in Da Qin there is an ancient master whose Dao is non-action—hence I go to observe him.’ My path lies beyond here—why falsely detain me?"* This was the second trial.

Yin Xi replied: *"Now beholding the venerable one’s countenance, your sagely bearing transcends all, for you are the supreme honor of heaven. How could there be any borderland barbarian worth observing? I pray you do not be misled by such words and deign to bestow a measure of compassion."* Lord Lao asked again: *"By what auspicious signs do you recognize me?"* This was the third trial.

Yin Xi answered: *"Last winter, in the tenth month, the star of Heavenly Reason moved westward past Xu. Now, at the new moon, the harmonious wind has blown thrice, and the true qi of the southeast—shaped like dragons and serpents—has crossed the Han River westward. These are the portents of a true person. From my youth, I have delighted in studying the ancient texts and the *Book of Changes*, gazing upward to observe celestial patterns and downward to examine earthly principles. The responses of wind and clouds have never failed to prove true. Previously, I saw purple qi advancing westward. Since the yang number reaches its utmost at nine, after ninety days, a sage would arrive in humble attire, riding a blue ox and a plain-planked cart from the east to cross the pass. From that time onward, I have longed day and night, dreaming of the true person for so long. Now, beholding the venerable one’s majestic countenance, your sagely bearing surpasses all others—I have never seen the like from youth to age. By what I know, could you not be the true person of highest antiquity?"*

Lord Lao, having passed all three trials, then smiled and said: *"I knew you cherished the Dao, so I came to test you. You possess the clarity of divine insight—you shall attain deliverance for the age."* Some say Lord Lao then gaped in astonishment, his tongue protruding, and exclaimed: *"Excellent! You know me, and I know you as well."* Thus, after three exchanges, he at last advanced toward Yin Xi. Hence the Four Hoary Ones said: *"Beholding Laozi and Yin Xi, how could one not revere and awaken to the foreknowledge of the Dao? Yet his persistent humble words were meant to instruct the age."*

The Pass Prefect then prepared seating in the official residence, performed the rites of a disciple, and served him facing north. He ordered a grand feast to be prepared and offered to Lord Lao. Lord Lao tested his heart of compassionate giving once more. At that time, there was a debtor named Xu Jia, who was hired for one hundred coins a day. Previously, they had agreed that once Lord Lao reached the Western Sea, Da Qin, or Parthia, he would repay the debt in gold upon his return. When Xu Jia saw Lord Lao about to embark on a distant journey, he doubted he would ever return and withheld his wages. Seduced by a beautiful woman, he then brought a complaint to the Pass Prefect, suing Lord Lao for the money.

Lord Lao said to Xu Jia: *"You have followed me for over two hundred years and owe seven million two hundred thousand coins. Your life should have ended long ago—you have lived until now only because of the Great Mystery Life Talisman I placed within you."* As he spoke, the Great Mystery Life Talisman flew from Xu Jia’s mouth and returned before Lord Lao, its script fresh and bright. Xu Jia instantly became a pile of white bones.

Seeing Xu Jia die for his deceitful heart, Yin Xi pitied him and wished to observe whether Lord Lao could revive the dead. He said: *"I shall repay this debt on his behalf."* He then prepared the money and said: *"I humbly beseech the venerable one to pardon Xu Jia’s past transgressions and grant him new life."* Lord Lao, moved by Yin Xi’s compassionate giving, said: *"Very well."* He cast the talisman onto the dry bones, and Xu Jia was restored to life as before.

Lord Lao said: *"I do not blame you. You violated our original agreement, and the Dao naturally departed from you—hence your death. Now I return your money to you."* He then dismissed him with courtesy.

After two or three trials, Lord Lao saw that the Pass Prefect had passed them all and knew he was certain to attain the Dao. Thus, he stayed at the pass for over a hundred days. The Pass Prefect bowed and said: *"This latecomer’s knowledge is shallow, my senses dull and obstructed. I have been deluded by the customs of the age, sunk in the allure of sounds and sights. Now, beholding the sage, it is as if the deaf have gained hearing, the blind have gained sight. I offer my body and life—pray, let me hear the great Dao."*

Lord Lao said: *"Subtle indeed is your question. The great Dao preserves the true in three grades. Its rule takes oneness as its measure, rectitude as its virtue."*

Yin Xi asked again: *"The Dao has three grades—what practice must one follow to ascend as an immortal?"*

Lord Lao said: *"Take oneness as the number. If you can know the One, all affairs are complete. Seal off passions and desires, enter the inner chamber to refine gold, and ingest qi—this is foremost. If you can know this, guard it and do not lose it."*

Yin Xi then leapt up, bowed, and asked: *"How does one refine gold?"*

Lord Lao said: *"It is the divine method. From the primordial origin of pure emptiness, none fail to attain the Dao through the golden talisman, treading the nine depths to enter the boundless. Above and below, in utter vacuity, they ascend together with the divine luminaries."*

Yin Xi bowed again and said: *"I wish to hear it."*

Lord Lao then transmitted to him the *Taiqing Eight Talismans Classic*, the *Taiqing Observing Heaven Classic*, the *Nine Capitals Classic*, the *Divine Elixir Classic*, the *Golden Liquid Classic*, and the *Formulas for Entering the Nine Cycles of Reverted Elixir and Subduing Fire*. The method stated:

*"The golden liquid, reverted elixir, flows with immortal radiance,
Soaring high on clouds, ascending to the celestial mounds.
The red and yellow substances form in an instant,
And you shall obtain the intermingled pearls of yin and yang.
You may transform and summon the traveling kitchen,
With spirit persons and jade maidens as your companions.
Entering and exiting without question, your tally matches heaven’s.
Its essence congeals like frost, adept at sinking and floating—
You must be startled and awed, for they shall surely come to roam."*

The nine elixirs are:
First, Elixir Radiance;
Second, Divine Talisman;
Third, Divine Elixir;
Fourth, Reverted Elixir;
Fifth, Ingested Elixir;
Sixth, Refined Elixir;
Seventh, Malleable Elixir;
Eighth, Subdued Elixir;
Ninth, Cold Elixir.

Another song said:
*"Round as three-five, a tenth of an inch.
Mouth four-eight, lips two inches.
Two feet long, thickness even.
Belly threefold aligned, seated warmth enduring."*

Yin resides above, yang rushes below.
Head and tail in martial stance, the center in civil grace.
Beginning at seventy, ending at thirty days.
Within, two hundred—skillfully harmonized.
Yin fire is white, yellow sprouts are lead.
When the two gather, they assist and uphold the practitioner.
Dwell in the palace as a child, and you shall abide in peace.
Coming and going in roaming, yet never leaving the gate.
Gradually growing great, your nature becomes pure and refined.
Then return to the One, reverting to the original source.
Upon completing one cycle, be most diligent,
Guard it closely, lest you fall into confusion and darkness.
The path is distant, profoundly subtle and mysterious.
Should you attain this, you shall comprehend heaven and earth.
At midnight and noon, govern and purify the po and hun.
Attain longevity and enter the immortal village.
Those who delight in the Dao, seek its texts.
Contemplate them deeply—no need for further discourse.

Now, mercury, sal ammoniac, and liquid pearls,
When wrought into divine elixir,
If you ingest a single *daogui*,
You shall ascend to the celestial palace.
With a body made firm by consuming qi,
You may attain the rank of immortal.
If you desire to become an immortal,
First ingest the Reverted Elixir and Golden Liquid.
Preserve your spirit, and you shall ascend as an immortal,
Becoming a perfected one.
If you do not ingest the Reverted Elixir and Golden Liquid,
Your suffering will be in vain.
Struck by cold and heat, wind and dampness, or demonic qi,
Even the Controller of Fate cannot save you.
The Dao is thus—how can you not strive?
Temper your clothing, eat sparingly,
Accord with the body, and guard emptiness.
In emptiness and nothingness, you are naturally so—
Even demons cannot harm you.
When your years and lifespan are exhausted,
You shall simply die.
Why say this?
Because without firmness and spirit, it is so.
It is like the growth of the myriad things—
Not that they seek death,
But they naturally wither, decay, and perish.
Humans are the same.
I use this to illustrate for you—
Exert yourself to preserve your spirit and refine the elixir,
And take early precautions.
Those who attain this Dao shall live forever,
Commanding ghosts and spirits.
If one is not the right person,
Even ten thousand gold pieces shall not be transmitted.
Do not show it to fools,
Or those who speak with forked tongues and do not believe,
Lest they slander the divine Dao,
And compound your transgressions.
Deliverance from the world lies within yourself—
There are no ghosts or gods.

Alas!
Though a walking corpse may be rich and possess all things,
Even if one is as noble as heaven and king,
Indulging in desires without restraint,
One’s years shall not exceed a hundred—
Reduced to a vessel of clay,
How lamentable!
Yet to compound the divine elixir takes but an instant.
Once achieved, you become an immortal,
And your fate is bound to heaven.
Indulge your heart’s desires—
What limit is there to joy?

The Pass Keeper bowed his head and asked again:
“How does one consume qi?”
The Old Lord replied:
“Consuming qi consolidates essence,
Receiving the luminous mystery of the *Xuanjing* and the essential wonders of the Dao.
Emerging from darkness into light,
Above, secure the Cloud Gate;
Below, fortify the numinous root.
Like clouds without feet,
Like water without roots.
The primordial qi is chaotic,
Transforming into the Great Clarity.
Grasp and hold it—
Over time, you shall naturally become numinous.
Knowing it is easy,
Practicing it is difficult.
For those who cultivate life,
Virtue is the chariot of form,
The Dao is the horse of qi,
The hun is rooted in essence,
The po is the gate of the eyes.
When form moves, virtue scatters;
When qi strays, the Dao rebels.
When essence dissipates, the hun is harmed;
When the eyes stir, the po is disordered.
Thus, the sage stills the form and seals the breath,
Accumulates essence and cherishes vision,
Empties virtue and the Dao,
Firmly guards the hun and po.
When form is one, spirit is myriad—
The Dao is then accomplished.
With the Dao accomplished, transformations occur,
And one faces peril without fear.
If you can cultivate this,
You shall grasp the great essentials of the Dao.

Life does not come again,
Thus it is guided by qi.
Treasure qi, and you attain the Dao;
Attain the Dao, and you endure long.
Spirit is essence—
Treasure essence, and spirit becomes luminous;
Spirit luminous, and you attain long life.
Qi in motion is the Dao,
Essence preserved is the treasure.
The practice of qi is also called refining qi,
Or the method of long breath.
Lie flat, clench your fists externally,
Rinse the mouth and swallow.
After three swallows, circulate the qi:
Inhale only through the nose,
Exhale only through the mouth.
Gently contract the nose to draw it in,
Do not fill to the utmost—
Overfilling makes return difficult.
When first practicing,
After five breaths, one breath may be exhaled.
With each exhalation,
When you wish to stop, exhale once.
Calm the body,
Harmonize the qi,
Do not interfere with breathing.
If not harmonized, cease;
When harmonized, proceed.
Guard it without weariness.
When qi arrives and form is at ease,
The nose’s breath harmonized,
Pure qi comes.
When you feel the body grow warm,
And warmth brings forth sweat,
Do not rise—rest and nurture it.
Strive for longevity,
And the Three Worms shall depart of themselves,
With clear intent and vivid imagination.

At midnight, when the magpie cries,
Pray thus:
‘In the east, the Azure Sprout—
Consume the Azure Sprout.
Drink from the morning blossom,
Three swallows, then cease.’
‘In the south, the Vermilion Cinnabar—
Consume the Vermilion Cinnabar.
Drink from the Cinnabar Pool,
Three swallows, then cease.’
‘In the central wilds,
Gaze upon Mount Tai,
Consume the primordial qi.
Drink from the sweet spring,
Three swallows, then cease.’
‘In the west, the Bright Stone—
Consume the Bright Stone.
Drink from the numinous liquid,
Three swallows, then cease.’
‘In the north, the Mysterious Nourishment—
Consume the Mysterious Nourishment.
Drink from the Jade Syrup,
Three swallows, then cease.’
After thirty days of this,
The Three Worms shall die,
The true spirit and true qi shall naturally settle,
The corpse-worm shall no longer return to the heart,
And you shall become an immortal.

Thus, I have composed for you the *Jade Record Central Scripture* in three scrolls and fifty-five chapters,
Originally stored in the Golden Coffer and Jade Record Bamboo Case of the Supreme Sovereign.
Now I entrust it to you—
Guard it well, and do not transmit it recklessly.

Its essentials state:
The art of nurturing life lies in severing worldly affairs and simplifying.
Return to purity and tranquility,
Nurture the primordial qi.
Harmonize and accumulate spirit,
Return and reflect upon life’s mysteries.
If you wish to cultivate the Dao, guard the natural.
Beware of guiding and pulling, lest you weary your form.
Avoiding grains and fasting starves your essence.
The six jia and yin-yang—do not disturb their balance.
When the heart is wild and the mind chaotic,
Spirit departs from the body.
A withered skeleton stands alone,
Returning to the Yellow Springs.
Dwell in stillness within a dark chamber,
Nurture your spirit.
Refine your thoughts—
The Dao is natural.

Thus, according to the *Divine Records*,
Its discourse states:
These three scrolls are the ancestors of primordial qi.
They draw from the harmony of the natural—
Their essential lies in embracing the One without departure.”

One Day’s Dao: sated at dawn, hungry at dusk.
One Month’s Dao: never lose its waxing and waning.
One Year’s Dao: lean in summer, plump in winter.
A Century’s Dao: moderate grains, eat jujubes.
A Millennium’s Dao: only sons, no daughters.
This is called long life and enduring vision—
The Dao has no fixed number.

Next were bestowed the *Scripture of the Natural*, the *Canon of Cyclical Treasuries*, and the *Yellow Court Scripture*,
Containing the esoteric methods of swallowing qi, ingesting essence, preserving the true, and securing longevity.
When the Keeper of the Pass had received them, he secretly practiced their inner cultivation.

The Keeper of the Pass again bowed deeply and asked, “May I inquire: what is the Great Dao?”
The Old Master said, “Your bones align with the true, your eyes hold the light of the sun, your nape bears a radiant halo,
Your five viscera bear patterns, your face the seven stars.
Above, you mirror the celestial patterns; below, you accord with earthly principles—nothing is lacking.
Thus, you are destined to refine spirit with wisdom, to emerge in the final kalpa,
And become the foremost of the perfected.
This is due to the good deeds of your past lives.
I now transmit to you the Great Dao:
Above, it enables you to ascend bodily, transcend the world, become deathless and unborn, attain the supreme truth,
And teach and transform at will, liberating countless generations.
In the middle, it allows you to become the teacher of kings;
Below, it secures your body, protects your family, and delivers salvation.
When the lives of heavenly beings end, they are transformed and reborn,
Their blessings and fortune enduring, all guided into the Dao, returning to the natural.
Do you not wish to uphold it?”

Xi bowed joyfully and said, “Now that I have heard the supreme Dao, I am suddenly enlightened,
Having passed through ten thousand kalpas to be reborn—this is truly a destined encounter from past lives.
I beseech the Heavenly Worthy and Great One to compose a book expounding the meaning of the Great Dao,
That I may receive and cultivate it.”
The Old Master said, “You are destined to benefit the world, abandon the mundane realm, and propagate the Great Dao.
You shall become a divine immortal.”

Thereupon, Xi resigned from office, feigning illness,
And on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month of that year, he returned to his estate.
By the twenty-eighth day, he received the *Five Thousand Characters* at this place.
The present Louguan is the former residence of the Grand Master and Keeper of the Pass, Yin.
The *Pavilion of Auspicious Qi* and the chariot once ridden by the Old Master remain visible to this day.

The Old Master said, “The main text of the *Dao De Jing* consists of five thousand words,
Yet within it, the paired eulogies and勢 amount to two scrolls, totaling over five thousand words.
Thus, the *Records of the Grand Historian* states: ‘Laozi expounded over five thousand words to the Keeper of the Pass, elucidating the meaning of Dao and virtue.’
The Dao is made manifest through words, yet it transcends words;
It is observed through form, yet it transcends form.
Thus, writings cannot exhaust words, nor words exhaust meaning.
The intent of the sage is profoundly aligned with the heart of the Great Dao—
What heart does the Great Dao possess? It takes the heart of heaven and humanity as its own.
This scripture is pure and true, its exterior and interior pervaded by emptiness and all-encompassing.
Vast and boundless, it embraces the ten directions, heaven and earth, and all things born within it.
Scattered, it is formless; revealed, it bears patterns.
Thus, the sage embodies and models it—its meaning is evident,
And the transformations of the Great Dao are observable.
Through images, the imageless is seen; through forms, the formless is perceived.
By this scripture, the beginnings of high antiquity may be known.

This scripture is attended by thirty-six thousand mighty spirits,
Who guard its celestial and terrestrial symbols—these two scrolls encompass heaven and earth,
Penetrating even the finest hair’s tip.
Its eighty-one chapters correspond to the numbers of the nine provinces, the four seas, and heaven and earth,
Thus it can conceal Kunlun within a millet grain.
This scripture can still prayers in times of peril and resolve disputes with words.”

Xi bowed, received the teachings, and said,
“Though I am not clever, I shall devote myself to these words.
The *Five Thousand Characters* proclaim the origin of Dao and virtue.
Diligently studying it, one’s voice resonates with the supreme ultimate.
Chanting it afar delights the heavens, and one carries the mystery of the Dao.
In tranquil contemplation, one invokes the true, and all wonders converge.
Inwardly observing form and shadow, spirit and qi endure.
Embodying Dao and virtue, the myriad spirits submit,
Disasters vanish in the nine depths, blessings arise in the ten directions,
Nations are pacified, and families secured—who can fathom this?
The text of non-action is not defiled by filth, nor adorned by glory,
Not disturbed by chaos, nor clarified by stillness—it is natural.
Manifesting the Dao, it is transmitted endlessly—this is its constancy.
People of later ages regard the *Dao De Jing* as a Confucian discourse,
Utterly lacking reverence and devotion—this is a grave error.
This scripture originally issued from the Palace of Supreme Emptiness,
The ancestor of all scriptures.
Above, it illumines the Great Dao; below, it propagates teachings for the age.
It cannot be conceived or debated, nor analyzed or explicated.
The Supreme Perfected and all immortals recite it ceaselessly—
How much more should ordinary people and Daoists?”

The Keeper of the Pass again bowed deeply and asked,
“The two scrolls of Dao and virtue mirror heaven and earth.
If one wishes to cultivate them inwardly, what is the principle?”
The Old Master said, “The Dao is emptiness and the natural.
Virtue does not dwell on achievements.
Those who cultivate it ascend to heaven, become perfected ones,
Attain long life without death—this was prized in high antiquity.”

The Keeper of the Pass kowtowed and said, “I am guilty, guilty.
Though I am humble and lowly, I yearn for divine immortality.
I beg for a single teaching to attain life.”
The Old Master said, “Excellent. I shall annotate the *Five Thousand Characters*,
Providing a sequential and sectioned explanation to transmit to you.
Its essentials are these:
The Dao refers to the *Niwan* (Mud-Pill Palace).
The Name refers to the spleen.
The Mother refers to the *Dantian* (Cinnabar Field).
The *Niwan* is the virtue of heaven, located within the human head.
Purple qi descends from above to the *Dantian*.
The spleen is the Central Yellow Supreme Unity.
Yellow qi lingers there, governing the central palace—its spirit is guarded by the Great White.
Within it dwells a single spirit—do not neglect it.
The *Dantian* is the Mysterious Female,
Nestled against the spine, residing in the lower origin.
At midnight, a single qi descends.”

Circling through the Three Palaces is wondrously called "guarding emptiness and non-being"—its alternate names refer to essence.
First is essence, second is sweat, third is fluid, fourth is blood, fifth is mucus, sixth is spittle; thus they are called alternate names.
"Mysterious and again mysterious" refers to the left and right kidneys.
The "gate of all wonders" means that when a person dies, their qi ceases at the mouth—hence it is called the gate of all wonders.
In the morning, one eats fine food; by evening, it becomes excrement—thus it is called foul.
When a person practices the Dao to prepare for death, it is called "not good."
In the morning, one performs good deeds; by evening, they turn to evil—thus it is said, "this is not good."
"Being and non-being give rise to each other" refers to the mouth and the belly.
"Difficulty and ease complete each other" refers to essence and qi.
"Long and short define each other" refers to the liver and the lungs.
"High and low incline toward each other" refers to the heart and the kidneys.
"Sounds and voices harmonize" refers to the mouth and ears, the intestines and the stomach.
"Before and after follow each other" refers to the two feet.
"Non-action" means guarding naturalness.
"All things arise" refers to the Six Jia spirits intertwining with the body.
"Not departing" means the Dao moves as one within the body; if it does not move, the body dies—next, it means the mind moves as one.
The heart-spirit glows red; qi generates the five colors.
Passing the Dark Pass, entering the Bright Hall,
Ascending to the Crimson Palace, veiled by the Flowery Canopy,
Descending toward the Pass of Ultimate Mystery to enter the Purple Palace—thus it is called "honoring the worthy."
In youth, qi and vessels are full and abundant, spirit and essence complete—one believes they will live forever.
Yet when the body ages, spirit and brightness all depart—thus it is called "a treasure hard to obtain."
"Empty the mind" means having no thoughts.
"Fill the belly" means constantly closing the breath.
"Strengthen the bones" means not leaking essence.
Then the upper and lower qi will flow freely, and within the body, all will be ordered.
Such are the general principles.

The Old Master said: “My Dao is profoundly deep and must not be recklessly transmitted.
The Dao of life enters and returns; spirit and brightness are all preserved.
The hundred joints and orifices, the Six Jia spirits linked,
Wander within the body, interweaving without end.
Embryonic breathing guards the center, ascending to connect with heaven—this is called the Great Dao.
Practice it and become an immortal, ascending to the Great Clarity, honored as a Perfected One.”

The Pass Keeper bowed his head and said: “Joyfully, I receive your command.
The Dao of heaven is weighty; I dare not leak its words.
I contemplate the Dao Lord, for a moment pitying the common people.”

The Old Master added: “If you wish to transmit my *Dao and Virtue Classic* and its sectional explanations, you must do so on a *jiazi* day, offering nine thousand gold coins and one bolt each of the five colors of silk. Divide these into four portions, present them at the Yellow Altar, and measure out a *mu* of cinnabar as a covenant. Report to the august spirits above, taking heaven and earth as witness, the sun and moon as pledge. You shall transmit my text, but do not recklessly show it to others.”

“Transmission must not fall to the unworthy—calamity will strike the transgressor, body perishing and name extinguished. Even his descendants will sink into ignominy. Can they not be cautious?

My Dao is emptiness and spontaneity, mystery and stillness, the guarding of the One. It is not meant for the mediocre. If you seek long life, you must enter deeply and emerge purely. Reduce your food, ingest qi, preserve the Dao, and fix your thoughts on nothingness. Thus your form will never die and endure through ten thousand generations.”

The Pass Keeper knelt to receive the teaching and thereby attained the Dao of long life.

Some texts speak of slaying a white horse as an oath, but these are spurious interpolations; they are not to be followed.

The Pass Keeper again bowed his head and said: “The Great Dao is subtle and wondrous, naturally profound and distant. I only hope for enlightenment.”

Thereupon, on the Qi-Watching Terrace south of the Pass Keeper’s residence, the Old Lord expounded the *Dao and Virtue Classic*. Its essentials were these:

“I tell you the essentials of the Dao: the Dao is spontaneous. The practitioner can attain it; the hearer can speak of it. The knower does not speak; the speaker does not know. Speech exists to convey sound. Thus we discourse, affirming one another with words. Those who do not know the Dao use words to confuse. Without hearing or speaking, one does not know the source of things. It is like a connoisseur of music who recognizes tones by the strings: his heart knows the sound, but his mouth cannot transmit it. The Dao is profound and subtle; the knower does not speak. Recognizing the sorrow of sound, he turns inward to reflect. Though his heart prompts his mouth to speak, the speaker does not know.

The Dao’s image has no form or origin; it is evanescent, as if absent yet present. It is like planting a tree: before it sprouts, no branches or leaves are seen. The root unites with earth, water, fire, and wind. The four qi move in their seasons, and the green qi gives life. Earth gathers and congeals, gradually solidifying. It spreads forth in luxuriant growth, its flavors and properties diverse—sweet, bitter, sour, salty, pungent. The qi’s movement varies in strength and weakness, and the fruits are uneven. Though they share a common origin, their names and colors differ, each possessing its own vital principle. From this arise distinct natures and behaviors, and thus they receive form and spirit.

Nurturing the Dao of yin and yang, they incline toward what they rely upon as kin. The Dao of life is not of one kind; all beings, human and otherwise, emerge from emptiness and nothingness, stirred to generate spirit. It is like playing music: the hand moves the strings, transmitting gong, shang, jue, zhi, and yu. The breath of qi and the origin of sound arise from body, mouth, and intent. The Dao emerges first from above, its root resting in emptiness and purity. Thus it is said: the Dao is spontaneous.

All things arise from the Great Simplicity, the primal origin of emptiness and nothingness, the radiant essence of the highest mystery. It is like a ten-thousand-fathom abyss with a gentle spring at its depths. Though faint and murky to the eye, seeing to the bottom is difficult. Dark and obscure, one does not know its source. It is like the departure of the dead: their spirits are not seen. Pure yin harmonizes and unites; yang cannot distinguish its parts. Past and future, what has gone and what is to come—even if one could see ahead, one could not fully comprehend the principle. How then can one know what is lost or preserved?

It is like one healed of a wound who cannot describe it to others. Playing gong and shang for the deaf, how can they hear? Only those with discernment and wisdom can receive instruction as if spoken directly. Though they claim to grasp the words, their coarse nature cannot express the truth. Thus they lose the root of life and cannot know the origin of the Dao.

I tell you the root of the Dao of life and show you its spontaneity. When all things are born, their natures and behaviors intertwine. Like destruction followed by creation, like death followed by rebirth, they form the five phases. Yin and yang unite, transforming and changing, becoming the essence of things.

I reflect on this Dao, which originates in obscurity. The foolish do not distinguish or understand; they believe themselves born by chance. Without the eye of the Dao, how can you know the spirit of life? False Dao nurtures the form; true Dao nurtures the spirit. When the spirit truly connects with the Dao, it can vanish or endure. The spirit can make the form fly or move mountains. When the form becomes ashes and dust, how can it be recognized?

Ears and eyes, sounds and colors—these are your lingering faults. The nose and mouth delight in fragrances and flavors, but these are your foes. The body is the root of affliction: pain, itching, cold, warmth, thoughts, and anxieties—sorrow, poison, worry, and vexation. My attachment to the body is my greatest calamity. Looking to the past and present, who preserves their form intact? Should I still seek to journey afar?”

The Pass Keeper bowed his head and said: “To ascend to heaven or descend to earth, to climb mountains or cross seas—I will follow you, Master, without fear or taboo.”

The Old Lord said: “Your Dao is not yet complete. How can you journey afar? You possess accumulated virtue, and thus the Dao is transmitted to you. If you can follow me, simply recite these two chapters. Delve deeply into their myriad subtleties, and your body will enter spontaneity. Only then can I travel with you, ascending to the Nine Heavens to pay homage to my teacher, descending to transform the nations and subdue the malevolent. Now I tell you the essentials of the Dao and reveal its profound words. Diligently cultivate them, and the true Dao will naturally be achieved.

After the Dao is achieved, your seven generations of ancestors will be born in lotus blossoms. Heavenly kitchens will provide daily sustenance, and you will naturally fly. Your ears will hear clearly, your eyes will see deeply. You will enter water without drowning, fire without burning. The six penetrations and four attainments will be yours; the true Dao will be complete. Nothing will be beyond your reach—nothing unknown, nothing unattainable. Then you may follow me on distant journeys, observing the transformations of the ten directions, assessing the myriad things. Is this not excellent?

When your Dao is about to be achieved, I will come to welcome you. For now, you may not depart. All the Perfected Ones of past kalpas attained the six penetrations through this scripture.”

The Pass Keeper again bowed his head to receive the command.

On the eighth day of the fourth month in the *jiayin* year, at the mountain lodge south of his residence, the Old Lord was about to ascend to heaven. He again addressed the Pass Keeper: “You must purify yourself for a thousand days and study my scripture. After three years, go to the Green Sheep Market in Chengdu to seek me, and you will find me.”

Having spoken, he bowed his head in gratitude. Suddenly, the Old Lord vanished.

In an instant, the radiant flames coiled and receded, revealing five hues of mysterious yellow. Overjoyed, he rushed into the central courtyard, kowtowing and saying: “I pray the Divine One grant me one more essential teaching, that I may preserve my primordial essence.”

Then, gazing upward, he beheld the Old Lord suspended in midair, seated above the clouds, tens of yards above the earth. His form was like a golden figure, his face radiating the five luminosities. Existence and extinction flickered, youth and age shifted without constancy.

Thereupon, nine transcendent immortals of the highest mystery, the five emperors’ direct messengers, and the envoys of the Orthodox Unity, all bearing tablets, came to welcome him. Each emanated a brilliance that illuminated the four directions. Spontaneously transformed, divine kings, mighty warriors, azure dragons, white tigers, qilin, and lions arrayed themselves before and behind, to his left and right.

Witnessing the majesty of heaven, Xi so overwhelmed that he wept in awe, kowtowing as he stood. The Old Lord admonished him: “I have repeatedly exhorted you—guard this well. Dispel defilements, still your thoughts, and with a mind free of contention, preserve the One. When all impurities are removed, all affairs are complete. This is the essential teaching of my Dao.”

Having spoken, he ascended with the immortals into the Supreme Subtlety. That day, rivers, springs, and pools suddenly surged, well waters overflowed, and mountains and streams trembled. A five-colored light pierced through, and the Supreme Subtlety in the west was suffused with hues of azure and crimson. The grand historian Su You declared: “A great sage has departed; a thousand years hence, his teachings will reach this land.” King Zhao then ordered a stone inscription carved and buried before the southern suburban temple of heaven. This was the omen preceding the Old Lord’s journey west to transform the Hu.

At that time, the Pass Keeper, deeply moved by the words he had received, wept in longing and remembrance. Claiming illness, he relinquished his post and secluded himself in a quiet chamber.

He embraced tranquility to contemplate the Dao, his resolve fixed on guarding the One, delving into the root of fundamental nothingness. He dissected the subtle and intricate words of the *Yimi* with meticulous care, yet their inner meaning remained elusive. Then, his mind opened and his intent became clear, and he treasured and practiced them.

On the first day, in his sleep, he dreamed of flying to the summit of Mount Tai. On the second day, he dreamed of immortals attending him. On the third day, he dreamed of divine radiance. On the fourth day, he dreamed of the world coming to take him as their master and serve him. Through these inner visions and dreams, he understood that the *Five Thousand Characters* contained the Dao, and so he practiced it with purity and clarity.

The commentary states: According to the *Scripture of Western Ascension*, when the Dao was first revealed in Jambudvīpa, there was an "Ancient Master" one might ascend to join—this refers to the admonitions given to the Pass Keeper. The subsequent line, "The Ancient Master is my own self," is precisely the earlier allegory. The essential method for seeking immortality lies in pursuing the true, hence the fictitious reference to an "Ancient Master" to whom one might ascend. Yet once the transmission of the Dao was complete, there was no need for further inquiry. Fearing that those who clung to the teachings might fail to grasp the distinction between provisional and ultimate truth, the text thus clarifies in the following passage that it is "my own self." Some say the "Ancient Master" is my teacher—this, too, is an allegory. To take it as a factual record is a grave error. For if such a person had truly existed in antiquity, why would he now, in his ascent, appear exactly as he did when first seen there? How could this be called the extinction of the self and the cessation of being? Upon careful consideration, the allegorical reference to a "teacher" is evident. Moreover, the "Nameless" and the "Ancient" are both titles of the Old Lord. Thus, the earlier statement that it is "my own self" is confirmed.

Some say he transformed Jambudvīpa and, having long since returned his spirit, now departs. This return to the original source makes clear that his transformations there and here are both the work of a single being, for this return and that origin are not two. Yet fearing that the Dao might remain obscure and that faith and awakening might not run deep, he manifested his numinous power to illuminate the world. By demonstrating his freedom in coming and going and the unparalleled sagely virtue, he sought to awaken true persons and prevent them from growing weary.

Yin Zhen said: "Today, beholding the sagely countenance so transcendent, I see the supreme honor of heaven—how could there be any frontier barbarians?" These words are subtle indeed.

On this mountain height, the Pass Keeper had previously built a terrace and lodge to observe the stars and await the qi. When the Old Lord ascended from its midst, later generations called it the "Tomb of Laozi," though it was no tomb at all. As the *Erya* states: "A great mound is called a *ling*—this is what is meant."

The Old Lord said: "In practicing the method of preserving the Three Ones, first visualize them between your eyebrows. One inch inward is the Hall of Light, two inches inward is the Cavern Chamber, and three inches inward is the Muddy Pellet—this is the palace of the Upper Cinnabar Field. Within the Upper Cinnabar Field resides a child named Yuanxian, also called the Imperial Minister, three inches in height, clad in red robes and red shoes.

Next, focus on the heart, called the Crimson Palace—this is the Middle Cinnabar Field. Within it dwells a true person named Zidan, also called the Radiant and Firm One, three inches in height, dressed in the same colors as before.

Next, focus three inches below the navel, called the Gate of Destiny—this is the Lower Cinnabar Field. Within it resides an infant named Yuanyang, also called the Valley of Mystery, three inches in height, dressed in the same colors as before.

Visualize them seated beneath a golden forest and jade table, with a golden censer and jade spoon. After stirring the essence, imagine it rising once to the middle, then descending to the left. One hand holds the golden censer and jade spoon at the center, while the other first descends to the right. Feed the essence to the upper infant once, then to the middle infant once, allowing each to drink about ten mouthfuls. Then imagine the upper infant returning to its place, followed by the lower infant, and then cease.

Next, visualize a white qi, vast as a chariot wheel, covering you. Then imagine a red qi covering the white qi, and then you may lie down.

Within the Cavern Chamber, there is a white qi, large as a chicken’s egg, its light like the moon illuminating all around. These methods should be constantly maintained day and night, for it is said: 'If you desire long life, the Three Ones must be clear. If you can guard the One, the One will guard you.' Whether sitting, moving, walking, entering mountain forests, joining the army, eating, drinking, falling ill, or facing sorrow—guard the One in all things, and no wish will go unfulfilled."

The Old Lord said: "Essence is the river that flows through the blood and veins, the numinous spirit that guards the bones. When essence departs, the bones wither, and when the bones wither, death follows. Thus, it must be treasured.

The body is a kingdom, the spirit its ruler, essence its minister, and qi its people. Qi transforms into essence, essence into spirit, and spirit into the infant. The infant ascends to become a true person, and the true person then becomes the child—this is the true One.

Heaven has three luminaries: the sun, moon, and stars. Humans have three treasures: the three Cinnabar Fields. By constantly circulating qi and cherishing essence, the three fields’ treasures and the child are preserved—this is the essential Dao.

If one can focus solely on the One without forgetfulness, all affairs will be accomplished. He who guards the One may wander heaven and earth without fear. Over time, he will see the thirty-six thousand spirits within his body collectively lift him, ascending to heaven in broad daylight—this is the path of the superior adept. The next level grants extended years and repels evil—this is the path of the middling adept. In times of urgency, if one does not forget the One, one will surely escape disaster—this is the path of the lesser adept.

In guarding the One, if one encounters nightmares or strange apparitions, one must not speak of them to others. Simply rectify the mind and focus on the One, and no harm will come.

The One is the sovereign lord of the body. If one can guard the One, the One will guard the person. Entering an army, weapons cannot slay them. Entering mountain forests, no harm will dare approach. Entering rivers and seas, dragons and serpents will avoid them. Entering plague-stricken lands, demonic qi will dissipate. Even when moving, constructing, or traveling, one need not avoid the Tai Sui, the Great General, the eight spirit taboos, or other prohibitions—no misfortune will befall.

The Old Lord said: 'For those who wish to cultivate the body and nurture nature, practice the Dao and transform form, seek blessings and fulfill wishes, refine qi into spirit, extend years and prolong life, and attain endless beginnings and ends—the essential path is purity and stillness.'"

Thus, heaven governs through stillness, earth stabilizes through stillness, spirits transform through stillness, and humans live through stillness. Therefore, purity enables resonance, and stillness enables response. When about to enter stillness, reverse hearing to listen inward, return vision to observe within the form. The heart does not entertain reckless thoughts, the mouth does not utter reckless words, the body does not make reckless movements. Only then will the color of no-color be seen, the sound of no-sound be heard, the sweetness of no-flavor be tasted, and the reverence of wordless speech be honored. The divine radiance descends, blessings and virtue draw near, and harmonious qi responds. The heart becomes sagely, the mind becomes luminous. Good dreams and auspicious omens appear; by observing signs in dreams, one perceives what has not yet come to pass. If one does not perceive, it is because sincerity has not yet reached its peak—when it does, communion is achieved.

The Old Lord said: "If you wish to enter the stillness chamber, always choose an auspicious day. First bathe, fast, and purify yourself for twenty-five days, then you may enter the chamber to refine your body. Only when the hun and po souls within are harmonized may you enter. If the spirits are not in harmony, one becomes restless, agitated within and without, unable to find peace."

Thus, for the sake of later worthies, I explain these transformations. The Old Lord said: "When entering the chamber, a cinnabar serpent may come to rest upon your heart. If you are not startled or afraid, it will speak with you as a perfected one. Or you may see the Queen Mother of the West riding a phoenix chariot, followed by six chariots drawn by red dragons, with three vermilion birds preceding her. Do not be alarmed upon seeing her; if she speaks to you, be cautious and do not reply. Should afflictions appear, do not fear them—if they persist, the perfected one will speak on your behalf.

After the Queen Mother of the West departs, the Great Dao will come to meet you. When it appears, sun, moon, and stars may be above, or the Heavenly Master and perfected ones may arrive with myriad forms of music—do not look. Immortal maidens and jade women may appear—take care not to gaze upon them. Dragons, serpents, birds, and beasts may approach you—do not be startled. These are all manifestations of the spirits within your form, not real. Simply calm your heart and steady your mind, and these apparitions will depart of their own accord. If an old woman or beings of strange form appear, do not speak with them or engage with them, and all will be auspicious.

After twenty-five days in the chamber, two women may come wishing to speak with you—do not converse with them. On the forty-fifth day, a scholar may come wishing to speak with you—do not engage with him. On the sixtieth day, two bright stars will appear above the chamber, lingering for three days—do not be alarmed. On the eighty-fifth day, a white-haired elder riding a white deer will call to you; reply, 'I bear the sins of my ancestors and have not yet attained worthiness.' On the one hundred and fifth day, the Heavenly Master will come to examine the merits of your ancestors; respond, 'Since my forebears, sins have not been exhausted, which is why I refine myself in this chamber.'

On the one hundred and twenty-fifth day, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders will appear three hundred paces from the chamber—do not be alarmed. On the one hundred and fiftieth day, evil spirits may impersonate your parents, wife, or children to test you—they are not your true kin. Simply rectify your body, steady your mind, and focus your spirit. After one hundred and eighty days, the chamber will naturally illuminate the safety or peril, survival or demise of the state. Thereafter, the offices and palaces within your body will become fully visible. After two hundred and eighty days, all illnesses and malevolent qi within your form will be expelled, and no evil will afflict you. You will have become a person of the Dao.

The nine chambers are as follows: The first chamber dispels perverse thoughts, with the Three Spirits guarding it. The Greater Yang resides on the left to instruct, the Greater Yin on the right to assist, and the Supreme Harmony within to benefit. The second chamber rectifies the body’s thoughts, uniting essence and qi to govern. Ghosts and spirits remain outside, observing whether one’s dwelling is upright or not, while the dwelling spirit resides within to assess whether success is possible. The third chamber attains correct thoughts, with essence, qi, ghosts, and spirits all uniting as one. If one dwells amidst the bustle of the world, the spirit resides without—do not be alarmed. The fourth chamber embodies great correctness of thought, where human essence achieves minor union with the spirit. The fifth chamber embodies ultimate correctness of thought, where the true spirit enters within, essence and qi follow, and ghosts and spirits remain outside—only then is departure possible.

The sixth chamber embodies profound correctness of thought, where spirit and essence are rectified, qi flows correctly, and its place is attained. Thus, qi, ghosts, spirits, and malevolent forces are all expelled. The seventh chamber embodies true correctness of thought, where the Great True Spirit arrives, all evil fears and departs, leaving only the true spirit. The eighth chamber embodies mysterious cavern thought, where body and true spirit unite as one. Day and night, one does not entertain a single worldly thought. The ninth chamber embodies great cavern thought—one has become a perfected person, lying down in the great cavern with the qi, the Dao complete. One presides over the affairs of spirit immortals and no longer comprehends human matters. Be cautious.

Thereafter, firmly close the door and take care not to meet with worldly people. Place food outside the door and let it be taken of its own accord. If it is no longer taken, do not let anyone disturb it. One’s appearance will naturally change, and there will be a time to depart.

In summary: Those who enter the chamber do so with the intent to purify themselves, recite scriptures, ingest medicines, circulate qi, contemplate the true, and refine the spirit—solely to seek the Dao. The more earnest and single-minded one is, the more one can profoundly resonate, transform form, alter countenance, and ascend as an immortal. Those who fail do so because their sincerity is insufficient or cannot be sustained—how could it merely be a matter of secluding the body in a dark chamber?

The Pass Keeper followed the teachings and cultivated for three years. When his practice was complete, his complexion grew youthful, and his face took on a golden hue—such was the depth of his refinement. After attaining the Dao, he went to Chengdu. By 'Chengdu,' it is meant that his learning of the Dao was complete—this is a metaphorical reference. *The Supreme Record of the Primordial Chaos and the True One* concludes.
