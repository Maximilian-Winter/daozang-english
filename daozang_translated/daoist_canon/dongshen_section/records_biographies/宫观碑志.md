### **Inscription on the Restoration of the Queen Mother’s Abbey at Huishan in Jingzhou**
**Composed by:** Tao Gu, Hanlin Academician and Director of the Bureau of Appointments within the Ministry of Rites

The *Rites of Sacrifice* states: *"That which establishes the Dao among the people shall be venerated."* How vast is the system of rites that distinguishes the four directions! For spirits whose duties offer enduring instruction, how could their worship be neglected?

According to the *Erya*: *"The lands of the Ji and Zhu tribes, the northern gate, the Queen Mother of the West, and the regions beneath the sun are called the Four Wastes."* The deeds of the Queen Mother have long been recorded. Her name appears in official annals; her story is no mere strange tale.

In the fourth generation of the Western Zhou’s mandate, there was a ruler named King Man, who reigned for fifty years. He rode eight steeds to the Jasper Pool, raised a goblet offered by the Queen Mother, and sang the *"Yellow Bamboo"* ode. In the fourth generation of the Western Han’s mandate, there was an emperor named Liu Che, who also reigned for fifty years. On the seventh night of the seventh month, he met the Queen Mother at Sweet Springs Palace, where her chariot descended, and he was presented with immortal peaches.

When King Mu of Zhou journeyed to the western limits, he watered his horses at the Tong River, drank the blood of magpies, and traversed the land of the Giant Sou. He then ascended Mount Yi, as recorded in the *"Biography of King Mu"* from the Ji Tombs. When Emperor Wu of Han prayed at the sacred precincts, he sacrificed at Yong, visited the court of Zhou, and erected the Pavilion of Feilian to gaze upon the Dark Garden. Thus, the *"Shangzhi"* hymn of the *Music Bureau* includes the *"Turning Melody."*

Alas! The spirit of the Xiang River plays the zither—these were the two consorts of Emperor Shun. The star of Huang Gu is the Weaver Girl of the Milky Way. Though they appear in the *Songs of Chu*, they are still enshrined in the classics, paired with solemn temples. With flutes and drums, sacrificial vessels and canopies, they receive offerings in the four seasons. With sacrificial animals, jade, and silk, they partake in the worship of the hundred spirits.

How could the Queen Mother compare? She is the Ninefold Radiant Saintly Maiden, governing the Supreme Perfected of the Three Pure Realms. She wears a jade sword that divides the light and rides a phoenix that sheds its feathers. The Eight Lang Immortals regulate her music, and nine-colored striped unicorns draw her chariot. At her whistling and singing, the sea gods dance; at her glance and gesture, the mountain spirits hasten. She assists the Five Emperors in the Golden Towers and adjudicates the Three Officials by the Crimson River. Her rank crowns the Upper Palace, and her blessings flow to the lower earth. Thus, the Abbey of the Queen Mother at Huishan is no unorthodox establishment.

Yet as the years of worship receded, the beams and eaves decayed. The altar songs faded, and brambles overgrew the desolate courtyard. The wells fell into ruin, and birds vanished; only crows and kites screeched over ancient steles. Yet misfortune does not last forever—its remedy lies in human effort.

The Grand Preceptor, the Duke of Qinghe, received the sacrificial meat and raised his banner, thrice governing Anding. His military achievements and governance are recorded in the annals. This land presses upon the upper reaches of the Jing River and controls the right flank of the Western Rong. Its soil suits millet and wheat, and its people are skilled in archery and horsemanship. Govern it with the Dao, and the wind will lay the grass flat; rule it without principle, and even water will capsize the boat. The loss of central authority cannot be tolerated for a single day—how much more so for the three garrisons!

In the spring of the *wuchen* year, the second month, the Duke entered the court bearing the jade tablet. He hastened to the capital, where the Son of Heaven lit courtyard torches to receive him, performed the *"Grand Xia"* music to honor him, sat by the palace window to soothe his heart, and bestowed upon him a grand ax and ornate reins. After the rites were completed, he received three edicts and returned to his former post.

Upon resuming his duties, he came to pay homage at the sacred abbey. Moved by solemn reverence, he felt as though his gaze met a response. He commanded the overseers to gather workers and undertake repairs. They cleared the creeping vines and weeds from the courtyard, planting fine trees. They replaced the crumbling eaves of the corridors, constructing grand beams. The vermilion and azure adorned her celestial form; the kingfisher-feather curtains enhanced the elegance of her canopy. The painted rafters seemed to sigh at the distance of the western lands, while the water pavilion overlooked the long river, as if marveling at the shallowness of the eastern sea.

With the attendants now solemn and the sincerity complete, what need was there for the Jade Maidens to cast arrows into the pot, gazing at the Bright Star on Mount Taihua? Or for the Maiden of the Jasper Terrace to appear in dreams, scattering evening rain on the Terrace of the Sun? By combining the words of the young woman and the youth, may the beauty of the Supreme Perfected be fully expressed.

As for myself, my learning does not reach antiquity, and my talent falls short of the times. Though I have long served among the literary ministers, drafting edicts without merit, and have forced myself to peer through the Vermilion Phoenix Window, stealing peaches leaves me ashamed.

Thus, I respectfully offer this eulogy:

*At the ruins of Kunlun,*
*Beneath its towering peaks,*
*With disheveled hair and a crown of feathers,*
*Tigers and leopards attend her.*
*Is it she? Is it not?*
*Marvelous, the Queen Mother!*
*Her chariot summoned at the Red Terrace,*
*The seventh night her appointed time.*
*Phoenix carriages and radiant swords,*
*Her gaze so bright, her bearing so fair.*
*Dwelling in the Dark Capital—thus it was,*
*Descending to the Han Palace—thus it was.*
*How manifold her numinous powers,*
*How wondrous her transformations!*
*Consult the* Mountain Classic *and* Bamboo Annals—
*Both preserve her ancient deeds.*
*At the mountain’s summit, by the water’s edge,*
*Jade libations and golden zithers offered.*
*Where have the drifting white clouds gone?*
*The* Yellow Bamboo *lies broken, not a branch remains.*
*I caress the old stone of Huibi Mountain,*
*Recording the immortal shrine by the Jing River.*

### **Inscription on the Abbey of Perfected Dao Attainment of Chongyang**
West of the capital Jingzhao, in the Zhongnan Mountains, lies a village called Nanshi. Within it stands the Abbey of Perfected Dao Attainment of Chongyang.

In the early years of the *Dading* era, the Patriarch of the Quanzhen School, the Perfected Chongyang, first awakened to the Dao. He dug a pit for himself, piling the earth a few feet high in the shape of a horse’s mane, naming it the *"Tomb of the Living Dead."* He planted four pear trees and eight crabapple trees around it. When asked the reason, he replied: *"When the true wind of my Dao spreads widely in the future, reaching the four directions and eight boundaries without exception, I want people to know that it all began from this one tomb."*

After two years, he moved to Liujiang. Later, three to five disciples built a thatched hut to guard the site. In the early years of the *Zhengda* era, the Perfected Chongyang, Zhou Quandao, came from Youzhou to offer sacrifices at the tomb of the Patriarch in Liujiang. Suddenly recalling the place where the Patriarch had cultivated, transformed, and attained the Dao, he felt it could not be left to decay. A sense of indignation arose in his heart to restore it, which he could not suppress—it was as if a spirit had moved him.

One day, a man invited him to a vegetarian feast. Upon inquiry, Zhou learned that the man was a Daoist from this very hermitage, so he accompanied him back. The Daoist community begged to borrow his influence to promote their cause. Struck by how closely their aspirations aligned with his own, Zhou gladly agreed and added, *"In the future, I shall reside here."*

After the Great Dynasty’s revolution, Daoists from all directions, wishing to repay their origins and return to their beginnings, planned to transport timber and reclaim the land. In the year *Yiwei*, by decree of the Supreme Master of the Pure Harmony, Perfected Yin, and the Teaching Master, Perfected Li of True Constancy, along with a memorial from Prefectural Governor Lord Tian, Master Li Zhiyuan of Profound Emptiness was commissioned to lead the Daoist community in grand reconstruction efforts. All labored diligently, measuring, building, and carving, their fervor unmatched by drumbeats. Three halls were erected: the Hall of the Boundless, the Hall of Radiant Dawn, and the Hall of Enlightenment. Five chambers were built: the Hall of the Three Masters, the Hall of the Divine Officials, the Hall of Gazing Light, the Hall of Morning Clarity, and the Hall of Empty Whiteness. Kitchens, storehouses, stables, abbot’s quarters, guest rooms, eaves, doors, windows—all were adorned in gold and azure, gleaming with fresh splendor. The subordinate cloisters, the Quanyang Temple at Sheliu and the Cultivation Temple at Wangguo Village, along with the monastery’s properties, were recorded separately on stone.

Yet some tasks remained incomplete. Zhang Zhigu and other disciples of Perfected Quanyang Zhou recalled their master’s words from the *Zhengda* era, when he had accepted the feast: *"In the future, I shall reside here."* They deemed this a silent decree of Heaven, not to be defied. Thus, they raised over a thousand strings of cash, pooling their sincerity and strength to expand the site day by day, month by month, intending it as a place to pray for the nation’s longevity and blessings. Its future growth seemed boundless.

In the first year of *Xinhai*, the year Emperor Xianzong ascended the throne, an imperial edict summoned the Teaching Master, Perfected Li of True Constancy. The Emperor personally bestowed upon him a golden incense casket, five thousand taels of silver, and a golden talisman, commanding him to perform the imperial rites of sacrifice at the sacred mountains and rivers. All ceremonies prescribed in the ritual canon were meticulously observed. The following spring, on an auspicious day in the second month, imperial incense was presented to fulfill the Emperor’s mandate. Upon completion of the rites, the monastery was elevated to official status by imperial grace—a designation that began in the year *Renzi*.

Master Li of Profound Emptiness was a disciple of Quanyang and a great-grandnephew of Perfected Ma of Cinnabar Yang. Among Quanyang’s five foremost disciples, he was the eldest. The second was Master Zhang Zhiyuan of Cave Emptiness, who presided over the White Cloud Temple in Zoucheng, Dongping, and ordained over a thousand disciples, with hermitages and temples to match. The third was Master Liang Shouyi of Illuminating Origin, who oversaw the Jade Peak Temple in ancient Bin, the very monastery where Quanyang had once resided. The fourth was Master Jia Shouzhen of Beyond Clouds, and the fifth was Master Zhang Zhigu of Pure Harmony, who now succeeded Master Li in administering the main temple.

This spring, in the second month, the temple’s overseer, Wang Zhiyuan, traveled to the Great Everlasting Spring Temple in Yanjing to report to the Teaching Master, Perfected Li of True Constancy, seeking to record the full history of the site and inscribe it on stone. The Master commanded me to refine the text. At nearly eighty years old, I had long grown weary of brush and ink, but sensing the request could not be refused, I arranged the facts in order.

As for the visible traces of the Patriarch, Hu Zijin of Jade Peak had already composed a eulogy, Mao Shouda of Pingshui had written a preface, and Wang Zizheng of Beiping had penned a biography. The four characters *"Tomb of the Living Dead"* were in the hand of Academician Zhao Xian of Leisure, and the Teaching Master, Perfected Li of True Constancy, had added a colophon—all of which were carved on stone. The deeds of Perfected Quanyang Zhou and Masters Li of Profound Emptiness and Zhang of Cave Emptiness in life were also recorded in Qin Lili’s *Records of the Golden Lotus* and *Records of Mist and Rosy Clouds*, while the Patriarch and subsequent masters were documented in the *Precious Treasury of the Mysterious Capital*. Thus, there is no need for repetition here.

Though in my youth I pursued advancement, I was distracted by the pursuit of merit and profit, leaving no time for foundational studies. Now, over thirty years later, my heart has found peace in simplicity and stillness, unbound by worldly teachings. Turning my gaze inward and listening to the silence, I have glimpsed the wondrous Dao of utmost emptiness, understanding the flow and blockage of its currents—such insights arise from the interplay of fate. The Dao has no beginning before time nor end after it. Though heaven and earth are vast, they do not lie beyond its bounds; though an autumn hair is small, it relies on the Dao to take form. How could fate be confined by numbers? It is merely a matter of whether the Dao is practiced or abandoned in the world.

As the *Book of Changes* states: *"If it is not the right person, the Dao will not manifest in vain."* And again: *"To make it spiritually luminous depends on the person."* Thus, when Heaven intends to bestow this Dao upon humanity, within the great transformation, it first sends forth a figure of unyielding integrity, upright and steadfast, unmoved by human desires—one who can serve as a model for others. Such was the advent of our Patriarch. His talents were unmatched, surpassing all others. Upon encountering a perfected being who enlightened him, his mind expanded, becoming vast and penetrating, roaming beyond the material world. Yet he could also withdraw into seclusion, using this place as the *"Tomb of the Living Dead"* to nurture himself for two years. His divine marvels, his interactions with people, his salvation of the world—each radiance connected seamlessly, unparalleled since the opening of heaven and earth. If he had not been in harmony with the hidden principles of the cosmos, how could he have achieved this?

Consider the case of Immortal Everlasting Spring. Long ago, when Yan Yuan was about to transform the ruler of Wei, Confucius feared that though his virtue was profound and his trustworthiness evident, the ruler’s *qi* might not be receptive, and though his reputation was unchallenged, the ruler’s heart might not be moved. Thus, he taught Yan Yuan the *"fasting of the mind,"* so that wherever he passed, none would remain unchanged. Wei was but a small feudal state in the Spring and Autumn period. According to the *Royal Regulations*, a duke or marquis governed a hundred *li* square. Calculating upward, a thousand *li* square would encompass a hundred such domains, and ten thousand *li* would encompass a hundred of those. The empire’s territory spans ten thousand *li*—the disparity in grandeur and scale between it and Wei is evident.

The Emperor, moreover, resided beyond the deserts of the tens of thousands of *li* to the north. Yet once the imperial edict arrived, the National Preceptor Changchun rose at once to answer the summons—like water flowing toward the moist, like fire inclining toward the dry, a spontaneous resonance devoid of even the slightest trace of self-serving calculation. When he arrived, their exchanges were marked by joyous accord, wholly satisfying the Emperor’s intent. Thereupon, from the very ground where his virtuous inclinations first manifested, he guided the Emperor in practicing benevolence and filial piety, in curbing desires and cultivating the self, in employing the worthy and cherishing the people, in spreading virtue and bestowing kindness, in treasuring life and abhorring killing, and in aligning with the will of Heaven. The Emperor, in turn, received his counsel without doubt.

One may well imagine: over the course of forty or fifty years, how countless were the lives preserved and the captives freed through his influence? The great flourishing of the Vajra-True Wind was witnessed by all. Yet our immortal, dwelling in tranquil seclusion where no merit seemed apparent, has nonetheless been credited by the world with true achievement—this could only be the work of one who roams beyond the realm of things, whose every movement harmonizes with Heaven.

Here, the profound intent of the ancestral master’s planting of the four pear and eight crabapple trees finds its confirmation. Now, in celebration of the construction of this temple and entrusted with the task of recording it, I set forth these words, that those who study the Dao may know: from the ancestral master onward, all who have received the transmission—whether in motion or stillness—act in accord with Heaven, not man. Should one adulterate it with the human, not only will no accomplishment arise, but the losses incurred will be great indeed.

What, then, is Heaven?

"Simply sincerity—nothing more. Sincerity is the fasting of the mind. The ancients cultivated the sincerity within their breasts to respond to the sentiments of Heaven and Earth, and thus Heaven, Earth, humans, and spirits never opposed them—was this not because they had grasped the pivot of response?

*Stele Inscription for the Grand Yellow Register Offering of All Under Heaven*
Composed by Feng Zhiheng, Grand Master of the Teaching, Administrator of the Daoist Clergy, and Imperial Commissioner for the Propagation of the Mysterious and Tranquil

The profound divine mechanism latent within Emperor Xianzong’s inner being—how vast its application! Manifested as martial prowess, he has become invincible throughout the realm; expressed as civil governance, he orders the lofty and profound with mastery. The operation of this mechanism takes non-action as its essence, the Dao as its gateway, and benevolence, sageliness, centrality, uprightness, and luminosity as its ultimate return. In times of no event, it seals the myriad transformations and retreats into concealment—even if named the mirror of Heaven and Earth or the looking-glass of the ten thousand existences, its depths remain unfathomable. Yet when it responds to the world, it pours forth like a boundless spring, timely and inexhaustible. Vast as Heaven, deep as the sea, when transformed into virtue, it becomes an immeasurable expanse of depth and generosity, so that not a single being remains untouched by its moistening grace.

In harmonizing virtue with the Two Modes and aligning sequence with the Four Seasons, in the affairs of serving Heaven by preceding it—such manifestations emerge in layered succession, too numerous to recount in full. Let us take but one instance from among the myriad affairs of a single day.

On the seventeenth day of the tenth month in the winter of *guichou*, an edict arrived summoning Daoist Master Wang Zhitan, Director of the Bureau for the Cultivation of Perfection, to inquire about the methods for ensuring bodily health and longevity. Zhitan responded with a few words on nurturing life, then, seizing upon the moment when the emperor’s benevolent intent became apparent, he spoke at length in accord with his sovereign’s inclinations, saying: "The concerns of these withered recluses of the mountains and forests pertain only to their own affairs—they are not the urgent matters of the Son of Heaven. Heaven and Earth are the parents of the ten thousand things, and humans are the most spiritually endowed among them. Yet the ruler cannot govern alone, so he establishes a sovereign. The emperor, acting on Heaven’s behalf to govern the people, should promote the greatest benefits and eliminate the greatest harms to fulfill Heaven’s will. Then the blessings and longevity bestowed by Heaven will follow as surely as an echo answers a sound or a shadow follows a form.

In past years, you swept away corrupt policies and gave the people a fresh beginning, and they have already received your bounty. Yet since the founding of our dynasty, through warfare, famine, and the uneven application of punishments, countless souls have suffered violent deaths, their spirits trapped in the dark prisons of the underworld, unable to escape. How can their number be reckoned? I humbly beseech Your Majesty’s sagely compassion to select masters of the Dao, follow the Mysterious Rites of the Yellow Register, and conduct a universal deliverance, so that the suffering souls in the nether realms may depart from their dark paths and all attain liberation and ascent. This would be the greatest of all benefactions."

The emperor praised and accepted his words. That very day, he dispatched dozens of imperial envoys to all regions by post-horse, each charged with conducting rites of deliverance in their respective domains. The academician Zhahuer, the *boyi chi* Alian, and Director Wang Zhitan traveled by relay carriage bearing secret instructions to the Great Everlasting Spring Abbey in Yanjing. There, the emperor specially commanded Li Zhichang, Perfected of True Constancy and Supreme Virtue, Mysterious and Profound, to preside over the offering and serve as the Great Master of Deliverance. The *duan shi* official Yalawaichi Buzhier oversaw the preparations, while the academician Zhahuer and three other envoys served as ritual officers. Along the way, they selected pure and lofty masters of the Dao to establish the Grand Yellow Register Offering of All Under Heaven, with three thousand six hundred altar stations.

From the ninth to the sixteenth day of the third month in the spring of *jiayin*, for seven days and nights, the authorities suspended all legal proceedings, the markets and wells forbade slaughter, and the imperial treasury provided five hundred eighty taels of gold, three thousand eight hundred taels of silver, and a thousand bolts of colored silk for the requisite ritual gold and silk offerings. Incense, oil, candles, plum blossoms, sandalwood, aloeswood, dragon’s brain, and *jiangzhen* were prepared for the sacrificial rites. All other expenses were drawn from the imperial storehouses, without troubling the people. An additional fifty taels of silver notes were issued to cover any shortfalls.

Nine secret memorials and three jade tablets were inscribed in the emperor’s own hand. Ritual officers and envoys oversaw the proceedings, while Daoist clergy and commoners, with banners and ceremonial guards, welcomed the offerings from the Gate of Communing with the Mysterious to the altar site.

The emperor, as a ruler who upholds and preserves the Dao, first offered prayers for his imperial ancestors, the sagely departed, and the spirits of his kin—those who have already returned to the Purple Palace, ever gazing upon the sun of wisdom, and those who stand ranked upon the immortal steps, eternally protecting the imperial domain. Extending to those who died in battle, perished as captives, or suffered unjust execution, whether their spirits had claimants or not, all were regarded with equal benevolence, none abandoned.

Some were loyal ministers and righteous knights who gave their lives for their lords, while others were rulers of small states who, unaware of Heaven’s mandate, violated the five prohibitions and brought upon themselves the punitive expeditions of rebellion. By ordinary standards, these two groups would be deemed irreconcilable enemies. Yet the emperor declared: "Amid the turmoil of warring factions, how many were wronged in death? In the vastness of a sage’s governance, who is not my subject? I cherish them as deeply as a father cherishes his children, mourning those who perished unjustly. How could I, having gained the realm, bear grudges against my fellow hunters?" Thus, all who had sunk into darkness were gathered into the deliverance.

This is an undertaking no emperor of antiquity ever attempted—indeed, not only did they never attempt it, but the power of their spiritual resonance falls far short of this. How can this be demonstrated? In ancient times, Yu convened the feudal lords at Mount Tu, where ten thousand states presented jade and silk. By the standards of the *Royal Regulations*, a lord’s domain spanned a hundred *li*, and a royal domain a thousand *li*—thus, a thousand-*li* domain would encompass a hundred hundred-*li* domains. Yet the gathering at Mount Tu represented only a ten-thousand-*li* realm. Our dynasty commands a territory of a million *li*, its power a hundredfold greater than that of the ancient Son of Heaven. Now, in performing this deed unparalleled in imperial history, the blessings for the living are self-evident. Even among the living, within each person’s circle of kin, teachers, and friends, those who suffered unjustly during four or five decades of warfare and remain trapped in the dark prisons—who among them has not received this grace?"

How could mortal hearts, unlike wood or stone, remain unmoved within? Once stirred within, these sentiments took form in speech, and all proclaimed: "Great is the Emperor’s virtue—it is the virtue of Heaven and Earth! His heart is the heart of Heaven and Earth! This marvel of divine mechanism, in harmony with the concordant qi, operates in perfect exchange. Through it, the Supreme Lord reaches the Three Clarities, pervades the Six Directions, and unites the spirits within and without. In the realm of the soundless and scentless, all flows and merges, naturally summoning one another, coalescing into oneness—what could remain unfulfilled?

The Great Master of the Lineage, Perpetual Perfection Realized Man Li, led five thousand gold-crowned and cloud-robed, star-crowned and purple-vested practitioners who ascended the altar in reverence. All were pure, lofty, and unsullied, deeply versed in esoteric scriptures, strictly observing the fasts and rituals of the Dao. Beneath the altar, the officiating ritual masters and the dynasty’s senior ministers witnessed their essence as utterly authentic, free from the slightest trace of human artifice. Augmented by the Dao’s compassionate workings, which conceal its use to manifest benevolence, since the eras of Dragon Han and Crimson Clarity, these deeds have been recorded in the Three Registers. They excel in saving people without abandoning a single one, in saving things without discarding a single thing. Thus, the true wind and wisdom-sun inspire and illuminate, dispelling darkness in the deepest chambers and reviving spring in frozen valleys. Every corner flows unimpeded, allowing those long mired in obscurity to bathe in hidden blessings. At the root and in their very nature, radiance reflects radiance, each illuminating itself. Should any remain unenlightened, the awakened guide the yet-to-awaken, passing clarity from one to another, emerging from one state to enter another, together beholding the manifold wonders—none sighing as if left behind.

The merit is towering, spanning from the depths below to the heights above—how could brush or tongue ever capture it? On the day of the welcoming rites, the Great Master presiding over the ritual, along with the officiating officials and all those who prepared the ceremony, commanded that this event be recorded to glorify the Emperor’s unparalleled virtue.

I reflect: among the Four Great of the world, the King occupies one—this is the subtle teaching of the Daoist scriptures. Looking up and down, we discern the causes of the hidden and the manifest, life and death. Heaven and Earth establish their positions, and the Sage fulfills their potential—this aligns with the words of the *Appended Judgments* of the *Book of Changes*. The Sage’s Dao, vast and overflowing, nurtures the myriad things and ascends to the heights of Heaven—this is the language of the *Doctrine of the Mean*. All these draw upon the marvel of divine mechanism, expanding it to its fullest, progressing from the subtle to the manifest, until virtue and grace fill Heaven and Earth, and numinous radiance extends across the Four Seas.

Now, this act of universal salvation—encompassing both the living and the dead, embracing all without distinction—surpasses the utmost benevolence of former kings a hundredfold. It originated from heeding a single word from the Daoist monk Zhi Tan, and was executed without hesitation, surging forth like the boundless Yangtze and Yellow River, irresistible in its force. Could this have been achieved without a foundation of utmost sincerity, a principle of unceasing cultivation in the art of shaping and aiding all things?

The imperial foundation stands firm, the Sage’s longevity boundless. With Heaven’s protection and the people’s support, the prayers of the ritual officials for blessings are already fulfilled. Bowing deeply, I compose these words:

Among the Four Great of the world, the Emperor occupies one.
The marvelous workings of divine mechanism, though hidden in secrecy,
Emerge as pure and unyielding, manifesting as the virtue of loving the people.
Some are rescued from drowning,
Others are raised to the realm of longevity.
Overflowing and all-pervading,
It fills the Four Seas.
Beyond such assistance,
Unceasing sincerity remains.
Ever mindful of the lost souls,
Whose grace has not yet reached them,
He pondered this day and night,
Unable to rest or eat.
He inquired of the feathered ones,
Who replied: "Rely on the power of the Dao."
Delighted by this counsel,
His countenance brightened.
He dispatched chariots in all four directions,
Each to their respective regions.
A great ritual for all under Heaven,
To urgently deliver and save.
In the Jade Palace of Yan,
Imperial decrees flowed in secret.
Spirits converged in hidden communion,
Like wind and tiger, cloud and dragon.
All provisions and expenses
Were granted with exceptional generosity.
The lineage masters and Daoist practitioners,
Sincere and reverent,
Conducted the rites and offerings,
The altar rites lofty and solemn.
The ritual officials and senior ministers
Maintained solemn demeanor.
Their qi and will were as if divine,
Their persons clear and bright.
Vital essence radiated outward,
Harmonious qi accumulated within.
Through this, the Sage’s grace was proclaimed,
And the netherworld merged with the True Void.
The awakened and the yet-to-awaken,
Once enlightened, follow in turn.
If one can turn their light inward for but a moment,
They may behold the boundless wonders.
For the dead, this is a stroke of fortune finer than a needle’s point,
Truly a once-in-ten-thousand-kalpas opportunity.
These verses record the Emperor’s marvelous workings of divine mechanism.

This stele commemorates the reconstruction of the Hall of the Supreme Ultimate at the Palace of Great Clarity in Bozhou.

Composed by Minister Wang Que, Hanlin Academician, Drafter of Edicts, and Compiler of the National History, by imperial command.

When the present Emperor was still a prince in his fiefdom, he revered and honored the Mysterious Teachings, intending to restore the Palace of Great Clarity. In the year *jisi* (1259), he issued an edict forbidding the people from gathering firewood and ordered that military envoys not be allowed to stay overnight, lest they hinder the construction. In the second year of his reign, he specially issued an imperial rescript, reaffirming the earlier decree. In the fourth year, he dispatched Perpetual Perfection Realized Man Xiao Jushou and the attendant Helasi, commanding the Academy of Scholarly Worthies to compose a prayer text and prepare the ritual offerings for the sacrifice. In the fifth year, with the Hall of the Supreme Ultimate completed, Zhang Zhijing, the Successor of the Ever-Spring Teaching and Perfected One of Sincerity and Clarity, along with Left Minister Zhang Wenqian and Chamberlain Liu Chengli, memorialized the throne, requesting that a stele be erected to record the event. The Emperor assented and ordered the court scholar Wang Que to compose the inscription.

I, having received this command, dare to bow deeply and speak thus: The Most High Lord Lao never fails to appear in any age, nor is he ever unvenerated in any era. In the *gengchen* year of King Wu Ding of Yin, he was born in Lai Xiang of Ku County, having gestated for eighty-one years. Endowed with seventy-two marks of perfection, he was called "Laozi" for his hoary hair and took the surname Li from the plum tree. His transformations of name and title, his numinous traces and sagely deeds, have been recounted in detail by earlier worthies—I dare not clutter this inscription with redundant words. Yet the reverence shown by former dynasties and the transmission by later generations may still be worth recounting.

The Qin burned the *Odes* and *Documents*, while the Han mingled hegemonic rule with the Dao. Though the numinous palace revered and honored him, the origins of its founding remained unrecorded. Not until the eighth year of *Yanxi* in the reign of Emperor Huan of Han did the emperor dream of Lord Lao descending into the palace courtyard. He twice dispatched the Palace Attendant Zuo Guan to the shrine to offer sacrifices, setting up an ornate canopy and employing the music of the suburban rites to heaven. He then ordered Bian Zhao, the Chancellor of Chen, to compose and inscribe an account.

In the sixth year of *Kaihuang* under Emperor Wen of Sui, an edict commanded Yang Yuanjiu, the Prefect of Bozhou, to investigate the ancient site and construct palace halls. He urged the Palace Secretary Xue Daoheng to compose the *Ode to the Shrine Courtyard*. The Tang, tracing their lineage, honored him as the Sagely Ancestor. In the first year of *Zhenguan* under Emperor Taizong, the palace was vigorously repaired, and fifty households were assigned to maintain its cleanliness. During the *Qianfeng* era of Emperor Gaozong, the emperor personally visited the Daoist palace, posthumously bestowing the august title of *Supreme Virtue Emperor of the Mysterious Origin*. The halls, altars, and structures were all ordered to be renovated, with a prefect and vice-prefect appointed to oversee seasonal offerings.

In the third year of *Kaiyuan* under Emperor Xuanzong, after the eastern pilgrimage to Mount Tai, the emperor returned to pay homage at the old residence. He personally inscribed the *Dao* and *Virtue* classics and had them carved into stone. In the twentieth year, the emperor composed the *Rainbow Skirt and Feathered Robe Dance* and the *Purple Tenuity and Eight Trigrams Dance* as offerings. In the second year of *Tianbao*, an edict renamed the Purple Ultimate Palace of Qiao Commandery as the Supreme Clarity Palace. In the fourth year, the emperor personally visited and composed the *Descending Perfection and Summoning Immortals* and *Purple Tenuity and Sending Forth Immortals* melodies for welcoming and sending off the deities. He replaced the prayer tablets with blue-green petitions, signing them as "the succeeding emperor, your subject so-and-so," and ordered the officials to establish this as a fixed ritual.

In the seventh year of *Taihe* under Emperor Wenzong, the palace suffered damage from floods, and the emperor urgently appointed Li Cheng, the Military Commissioner of Xuanwu, to serve concurrently as the Superintendent of the Supreme Clarity Palace. Gradually, repairs were made, and the palace was restored to its former beauty. In the first year of *Jianlong* under Emperor Taizu of Song, envoys were dispatched to the shrine. In the fourth year of *Chunhua* under Emperor Taizong, construction of the palace halls began, and by the first year of *Zhiming*, the work was completed. An edict ordered He Meng, the Vice Director of the Bureau of Waterways, to compose an inscription. Thereafter, eunuchs were exclusively appointed to oversee the site.

In the fifth year of *Xianping* under Emperor Zhenzong, palace attendants were sent to undertake major renovations, and additional guards were assigned. In the second year of *Jingde*, gathering firewood in the four directions was prohibited. In the fifth year of *Dazhong Xiangfu*, the Minister of Revenue Ding Wei was sent to offer reverence on the emperor’s behalf. In the sixth year, the emperor personally visited, and in the seventh year, he returned to present the imperial charter and seal, bestowing the august title of *Supreme Origin and Perfect Virtue Emperor*. In the fifth year of *Shaosheng* under Emperor Zhezong, Yu Lu, the Prefect of Bozhou, reported various auspicious signs. Envoys were dispatched to offer thanksgiving sacrifices, and an edict commanded the Circuit Transport Commissioner to repair any dilapidated palace structures as needed.

In the first year of *Chongning* under Emperor Huizong, an edict ordered the Hanlin Academician Zhang Shangying to compose a record to fulfill the intentions of Emperor Zhezong. Through successive reigns of the Jin dynasty, extraordinary honors were repeatedly bestowed. Tens of thousands of *mu* of fertile land were granted to Daoist priests, exempting them from taxes and corvée. Even today, farmers and villagers still speak of it. These are but outlines of how former dynasties revered him, providing later generations who turn to the Dao with material for reflection.

As for those who transmitted his teachings: after the Blue Ox journeyed west, Yin Xi earnestly entreated him, compelling him to compose the five thousand words. He spoke of "pure contention and non-action," of "not contending and not shining," declaring that "fine weapons are inauspicious." He likened governing a state to cooking a small fish, warned that galloping and hunting drive men mad, and taught that kings and dukes should style themselves as "solitary" and "unworthy." By applying these principles to pacify the realm, no resources would remain untapped. As for rectifying the mind and cultivating the self, the two classics contain all that is needed—those who seek will find more than enough.

The patriarchs transmitted the *Dao and Virtue*, with four auxiliary texts following in succession, all adhering to the ancient path. Thus emerged the books *Cavernous Numinosity*, *Penetrating the Mysterious*, *Embracing the Void*, and *Southern Florescence*. As the age declined and customs grew shallow, heterodox doctrines arose alongside them. Some distorted them into illusions, while others let them drift into strange and uncanny practices.

Yet Heaven had not yet abandoned this Dao. In recent times, the Quanzhen school emerged, its adherents serene and steadfast, moving in accordance with the old tracks. Wang Chongyang received the transmission from Perfect Yang and Pure Yang, nurturing its roots and entrusting it to six disciples. Wherever they went, fragrance spread, and branches and leaves flourished. When the present dynasty was founded, it summoned Changchun to expound the mysteries of the Mysterious Origin. Having personally received the sagely teachings, the realm turned as one toward the Dao. Even in the humblest hamlets and the most remote postal stations, all knew to revere and honor it. Their moral conduct and virtuous deeds, their hidden merits, aligned with those of the Supreme Lord—this is why the Supreme Clarity Palace was rebuilt.

The Supreme Clarity Palace had recently suffered from war and fire, and the confluence of the Yellow and Wo Rivers had swept away what remained of the immortal halls. Only the Nine Dragon Well from thousands of years past survived. After Changchun’s ascension, the Dharma was transmitted to Zhenchang. At that time, the present Duke of Ansuxiang, Zhang Rou, was stationed in Bozhou. He ordered an official to present a memorial, urging the restoration of the palace. Zhenchang first entrusted the Hidden Perfection Master and Superintendent Shi Zhiyu and the Penetrating the Mysterious Master and Palace Director Li Zhimi to commence the work. The duke also devoted himself wholeheartedly, providing support and protection. His officers and soldiers all willingly contributed, and land extending forty *li* around the palace was granted as an endowment.

Before long, the work began, but Zhenchang passed away. When I succeeded to the teaching, I received the command of Prince Haidu to earnestly invite the Venerable Daoist Zhang Zhisu and the Cloud-Dwelling Daoist Wang Zhijin to jointly oversee the project. Cloud-Dwelling passed away shortly after, but his disciples redoubled their efforts. Venerable Daoist labored day and night without respite. The old foundations were raised by over a *zhang*, and nine bays were constructed, far surpassing the former structure in grandeur. Within, an image of the Supreme Lord was enshrined, with Shu Hua and Wen Shi arrayed to his left and right, followed by *Cavernous Numinosity*, *Penetrating the Mysterious*, *Embracing the Void*, and *Southern Florescence*. The immortal visages stood solemnly, inspiring reverence in all who beheld them.

Though some details remain unfinished, the palace is already sufficient to offer incense and maintain the sacred flame, serving as a place for the dynasty to pray for blessings through ten thousand generations. Is this not magnificent?

His Imperial Majesty’s sagely virtue renews itself daily, his divine martial prowess strikes like lightning. He pacified the great western frontier, subdued the Three Han to submission, swiftly eradicated the southern rebels, and summoned all the northern khans to court. With governance distributed among his ministers and arms laid aside in favor of culture, this is an era of radiant prosperity—a thousand-year opportunity.

Yet he still reveres the Supreme Mystery and diligently maintains solemn sacrifices. The construction of this palace may thus be anticipated with the certainty of sun and moon.

I, unworthy though I am, serve in the Hanlin Academy and have been graced with the imperial command. With due reverence, I bow twice and inscribe this record. Its words are as follows:

The sage does not act with partiality,
And the people flourish in simplicity.
Once cunning and wit arise,
A hundred deceptions eclipse truth.
Heaven speaks not—
Yet from it springs the Perfected One.
Where did he first appear?
By the waters of the Guo River.
Born with numinous distinction,
He spurned sagacity and renounced cleverness.
Dwelling in substance, abiding in depth,
He untangled knots and blunted sharpness.
He refused office under a corrupt lord,
Content to remain in lowly station.
With a blue ox he rode west,
Shunning fame and fleeing the world.
The two scrolls, *Dao* and *Virtue*,
Set forth five thousand words.
Acting through non-action,
Profound beyond profundity.
In governing the people and ordering the state,
His legacy endures through ten thousand generations.
Whose descendant is he?
The Primordial Ancestor of the August Lord.
Ever mindful of the imperial model,
The Supreme Virtue of the Undifferentiated Origin.
A shrine was raised by the river,
A single pheasant’s wing soaring.
The palace was named Supreme Clarity,
Its hall the Supreme Ultimate.
The immortal worthies’ names were inscribed,
Enhancing the splendor of Qiao Prefecture.
The surging Yellow River
Assaulted our Valley of Yang.
The towering palaces—
Now vanished.
Rising and falling follow fate,
Awaiting the flourishing of our time.
With sincerity and illumination, the teaching is perpetuated,
The true and constant will is carried forward.
Zhi Mi and Zhi Yu
First divined the site and laid the foundations.
Chong Dao and Qi Yun,
Responding with alacrity, took up the task.
One hall now complete,
Its majesty inspires awe.
For ten thousand years to come,
It shall serve as the realm’s altar of blessing.
The merit is not another’s—
Chong Dao’s contribution is greatest.
I dare not claim credit,
For how could I repay the sovereign’s grace?
From the nine wells of Qingyuan,
Fortune flows to both rivers.
This humble minister inscribes this record,
A hymn in place of strings and song.

*Stele for the Reconstruction of the Ten Directions Great Heavenly Eternal Abbey in the Central Capital*
Composed by Minister Zheng Ziping, Hanlin Academician, Expositor-in-Waiting, Participant in the Drafting of Edicts, and Compiler of the National History, by imperial command.

In the third month of the fourteenth year of the Dading era, Minister Zhong Yu of the Ministry of Revenue and Minister Yi Yan, Director of Agricultural Affairs, memorialized: “The imperial lodgings at the Ten Directions Great Heavenly Eternal Abbey are now secure, and the images are solemnly arrayed. We humbly report this.” On the full moon of that month, the Son of Heaven and the Crown Prince, accompanied by the hundred officials, paid reverent homage. Three days and nights of Daoist rites were then ordered to celebrate the completion.

Previously, Master Yan Deyuan, Abbot of the Precept Platform of the Western Capital Circuit, had been summoned to reside as abbot and was appointed Supervisor of Abbey Affairs. In the autumn of the nineteenth year, in the ninth month, an edict was issued to a scholar-official to compose an inscription for the stele. I, Ziping, unworthy though I stand at the northern gate, have been charged with this task. I dare to examine the abbey’s rise and fall, its flourishing and decay, and set it forth here.

According to my humble study of *Illustrated Classics* and old steles, the abbey was first established in the Kaiyuan era of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, named Heavenly Eternity. Its grandeur was unmatched. Over time, it fell into disrepair, its ruin growing ever more severe. In the seventh year of the Xiantong era, Zhang Yunshen, Military Commissioner of Lulong, renovated and restored it.

In the Five Dynasties and under the Liao, it was revered and honored alike. During the final years of the Zhenglong era of our dynasty, with government corvée and administrative burdens proliferating, the abbey’s halls were filled with registers and records stored within. Some malcontents, seeking to extort or scheme, set fire to it, and in a single night, centuries of construction were reduced to ashes.

Yet things do not remain forever in decline; the time seemed to await a turning point. When the Sagely Son of Heaven received the Mandate and ascended the throne, five years had scarcely passed before his achievements were complete and governance settled. From the seas within to the lands beyond, all became subjects and sovereigns in harmony. Officials perfected their duties, the people pursued their livelihoods, and artisans honed their skills. Virtue and grace overflowed, auspicious omens arrived in abundance, and all that had fallen into neglect was restored.

In the autumn of the seventh year of the Dading era, on the twenty-third day of the seventh month, an imperial edict was issued to revive the abbey. The current Minister of Revenue, Zhang Zhongyu, and the Commissioner for Agriculture, Zhang Jinyan, were appointed to oversee the project, with orders not to rush. From its commencement to completion, the work spanned eight years.

The front triple gate was inscribed *Ten Directions Great Heavenly Eternity Abbey*; the central triple gate was named *Gate of Jade Purity*. A three-tiered altar for the *Xu Huang* Offering was established. The central main hall, *Jade Purity*, was dedicated to the Three Clarities. Next stood the pavilion *Illuminating Brightness*, enshrining the August Heavenly Emperor. Beyond it was the hall *Extending Felicity*, housing the images of the Celestial Bodies. To its east stood the hall *Clarifying the Spirit*, and to its west, the hall *Engendering Perfection*, both dedicated to the Six Positions of the Celestial Bodies.

In the east was the bell tower *Numinous Sound*, also enshrining the Jade Emperor and the Emperor of Primordial Void. Next stood the pavilion *Great Brilliance*, dedicated to the Lord of the Sun. Beyond it was the hall *Five Marchmounts*, housing the emperors of the sacred peaks and the Spirit King of Changbai Mountain, *Flourishing State and Numinous Response*. To the west was the pavilion *Soaring Mystery*, housing the *Daoist Canon* and enshrining the Three Heavenly Treasure Lords. Next stood the pavilion *Luminous Purity*, dedicated to the Lady of the Moon. Beyond it was the hall *Four Watercourses*, enshrining the spirits of the Yangzi, Yellow, Huai, and Ji Rivers.

The abbey comprised grotto chambers, meditation halls, and the abbot’s quarters, totaling over one hundred and sixty bays. As for the timber of its beams and pillars, the adornment of its cinnabar and lacquer, and the craftsmanship of its painted and sculpted images—though it were wrought of dragon pines and brocade, carved from starry catalpa and fragrant nanmu, inlaid with seashell and jade, or gilded with cinnabar and vermilion, the skill of Lu Ban and the artistry of Wu Daozi would not surpass it.

The expenditure amounted to tens of millions, all drawn from the imperial wardrobe and personal effects, which were sold to the people at fair prices. Thus, the project was accomplished with such ease.

Wandering through its jade halls, one marvels at the work of divine craftsmanship. Wind-borne steeds and cloud chariots seem to convey the perfected immortals. Jade cases and alabaster scrolls reveal the profound mysteries of the Dao. Daoist adepts in feathered robes gather to invoke the true ones. Secluded chambers and winding rooms offer refuge to the reclusive.

Alas! Not a single coin was drawn from the national treasury, nor a single laborer conscripted from the registers, nor a single soldier levied from the rosters. Yet here stands a palace of a thousand pillars, an abbey of a hundred fathoms, an altar of three tiers—majestic and resplendent, as if fashioned by heaven and earth. Without the Sagely Virtue’s resonance, the loyal ministers’ concerted efforts, how could this have been achieved?

I humbly submit that the subtle and wondrous Dao, profound and beyond comprehension, is forcibly named the *Way*. The Sage attains it to govern the myriad beginnings and rule the world, matching the yielding virtue of the sage-kings of old. Next is the Great Elixir and Cloudy Liquor, enabling transcendence and light ascent, the essence of longevity and enduring vision. Then come the practices of bear-hanging and bird-stretching, exhaling the old and inhaling the new, arts of prolonging life and preserving destiny. Further still are the rites of summoning spirits and subduing disasters, averting calamities and curing illnesses, proven methods to delay aging and heal afflictions. How could the Dao’s contribution to the world be small? Yet its spiritual illumination depends on the person.

In former times, the Li-Tang dynasty traced its ancestry to the Mysterious Origin and flourished through the achievements of the Kaiyuan era. The reason for its supreme veneration lay in its prioritization of self-cultivation. Now, the Son of Heaven, recognizing the Dao’s merit in the world, has revived this abbey to bestow blessings upon the people. Prioritizing self-cultivation is a matter of seizing the moment; bestowing blessings upon the people is a matter of utmost sincerity. Can seizing the moment and utmost sincerity be spoken of in the same breath?

I bow my head and knock my forehead to the ground, daring to offer this eulogy:

The *Book of Changes* speaks of the Supreme Ultimate, the radiance of heaven’s treasure—
Who presides over this but the true and essential?
The gate of the myriad wonders, dark and ever darker,
Nurturing the ten thousand beings as the earth and heavens turn.

Vast and boundless, it spans kalpas unchanging,
From the *Yan Kang* and *Long Han* eras, the first years.
Yet its spiritual illumination depends on humanity’s precedence—
The names of Jade Purity and Grand Purity were first transmitted.

Some say it existed before the womb,
And emperors and kings since time immemorial have revered it.
When the Perfected Lord Kong ascended in the Kaiyuan era,
He honored the ancestors and devoted himself to the Dao.

He built temples to bless the realm of Yan,
And over five hundred years have since passed.
Yet in an instant, human fire lamentably consumed it—
The time seemed to await its revival, how profound the providence!

The Sagely Emperor received the Mandate and ruled the nine regions,
His virtue and grace shining like the heavens’ springs.
The seas were calm, the beacons cold,
All that had fallen was restored to completion.

Moved by this ancient foundation standing alone in ruin,
Unlike the Han and Tang, his intent was not mere transcendence.
Rather, he sought to bestow abundant blessings upon the people,
And entrusted this task to a trusted minister, who personally oversaw it.

The work began without haste, adapting to circumstances,
And in eight years, it was completed without delay.
The cloud-palace of the Pure Capital shelters a thousand rafters,
Its vast courtyards and soaring pavilions stretch endlessly.

Golden and azure, radiant and resplendent,
How magnificent the sight, overlooking the long avenue!
No labor was exacted from the people, no wealth depleted—
The Sagely Virtue’s achievement, proclaimed by his ministers’ efforts.

This humble servant offers an inscription to be carved in stone,
As blessings and fortune now flow like a river.
*Stele Inscription for the Ten Directions Great Heavenly Eternity Abbey and the Precious Canon of the Mysterious Capital*

Composed by Wei Boxiao, Gentleman for Attendance, Hanlin Academician for Texts, Drafter of Edicts, and Compiler of the National History

The newly completed *Precious Canon of the Mysterious Capital* at the Ten Directions Great Heavenly Eternity Abbey was overseen by the Supervisor of Abbey Affairs, the *Chong He* Great Master Sun Mingdao, who said to the renowned scholar Wei Boxiao:

"Since the Primordial Heavenly Worthy opened the *Long Han* and *Yan Kang* kalpas, commanding the Heavenly Perfected and August Person to expound the secret Dao and transmit it to the ranks of immortals for posterity, the scriptures first came into being."

Since the Queen Mother of the West bestowed the jade image of the Primordial upon the Yellow Emperor, Xuanyuan, and placed it atop a lofty abbey to receive incense and offerings, the abbey first came into being. Thus, without abbeys, there would be no place to house the supreme scriptures; without scriptures, there would be no means to perceive the supreme Dao. Can scriptures and abbeys exist independently?

The imperial capital was established at Yong’an over forty years ago. The Heavenly Eternity Abbey has since maintained its royal incense offerings, yet its stored canon remained incomplete. Successive abbots followed one another, each content with mere continuity, none taking it upon themselves to repair or complete it. In the *bingwu* year of the Great Rectification era, Mingdao was first entrusted with the imperial decree to supervise the abbey’s affairs. During his leisure from myriad duties, the late Emperor Shizong turned his attention to the inner canon. When the abbey’s halls were consumed by fire, he drew from the imperial treasury tens of thousands in gold to raze the old and rebuild anew. Thus, the august sages found their abode, the host of perfected found their place. Long corridors and secret halls spread like wings; scripture pavilions and ritual altars, vast courtyards and present-day chambers—all were arranged with order, their grandeur deep and serene, a spectacle for the realm.

Moreover, he bestowed twenty million in cash, managed by the Ministry of Revenue, with annual surpluses allocated to support the Daoist clergy. On Five-Flower Mountain, he established a cinnabar-refining cloister and erected the Jade Splendor Hall, subordinating it to the abbey as a place for alchemists to refine and ascend. Yet the supreme scriptures alone remained incomplete. Though I am dull-witted, I swore to devote all my strength to accomplishing this noble task.

Two years later, an imperial edict arrived from the Southern Capital, entrusting the *Daoist Canon* printing blocks to the abbey. The jade scriptures of the Jade Void Abbey were relocated to the Flying Mystery Pavilion for display, while the old scriptures of the Heavenly Eternity Abbey were returned to the Jade Void. Those listed in the old registry but absent from the Jade Void’s collection were permitted to remain, to be dispatched only when replacements were found. Subsequently, for the grand universal ritual, the solemn protocols were observed, and ten individuals, including Xiao Daoji, were granted the honor of wearing the purple sash. Fifteen thousand in cash were further bestowed to procure vestments, with an additional three thousand given to the remaining clergy.

Mingdao, ever more inspired, believed that with the sagely Son of Heaven above, the Daoist teachings flourished. It was fitting to propagate the dharma, enlighten the deluded, and open the path to salvation. He submitted a memorial to the throne, and the imperial assent was granted. He was further encouraged to invite eminent Daoists and conduct rites with utmost purity. The following year, in the first month, the tripod was cast and the dragon departed, yet the imperial decree remained in force.

Upon ascending the throne, the present emperor revered Daoist learning all the more, for its teachings originated in China. Emphasizing purity and frugality, the court officials petitioned to uphold the previous edict. With the imperial approval, on the first day of the third month, the altar was opened to receive the registers. Once the solemn rites were prepared and the master’s name was invoked, three cranes suddenly arrived from the northwest, circling the ritual altar. As the invocation concluded, they departed toward the southwest. At noon, as the sun stood at its zenith and the master ascended the altar, four more cranes hovered above. As the divine officials were summoned, a sudden yellow mist enveloped the sky, sweeping in from the northwest like a tempest. Yet when the mats were rolled away, the heavens cleared, and the cranes soared into the vast emptiness. The clergy and laity, awestruck, bowed in reverence.

On the first day of the inaugural year of the *Mingchang* era, an imperial envoy was urgently dispatched to instruct the Ministry of Revenue to expand the abbey’s left vacant land by a thousand paces. There, the *Dingmao* Auspicious Sage Hall was erected to enshrine the natal deity of the August Mother, its design matching the Hall of Extended Celebration. The northern palace’s first precinct was also granted to the abbey, where halls were constructed in rows to house the printing blocks. Two scholar-officials were appointed to collaborate with Mingdao in proofreading and collating, completing the repairs and printing a full canon. Further, a diligent Daoist was selected to serve as abbot, with the stipulation that after five years of exemplary service, he would be granted the purple robe and an honorific title. Two diligent novices were also to be tonsured annually as a permanent arrangement.

Mingdao, ever dutiful, spared no effort in his residence. He dispatched yellow-capped Daoists to seek lost scriptures throughout the realm and recruited artisans to gather materials. A certain Zhao Daozhen volunteered to oversee the procurement of printing blocks, soliciting donations far and wide. Within two years, all was prepared: rare timbers assembled, skilled craftsmen gathered, pillars erected, and carvings completed. In total, 1,074 lost scriptures were recovered, 21,800 printing blocks were supplemented, and 83,198 volumes were amassed, filling four storehouses with thirty-five bays and 140 shelves.

Mingdao then rallied the clergy to organize the canon according to the Three Caverns and Four Supplements, meticulously classifying and collating each text, resolving discrepancies, and arranging them in order. Thus, a complete canon was compiled, totaling 6,455 scrolls in 602 sections, titled *The Precious Canon of the Mysterious Capital of the Great Jin*. With the task accomplished, a stele was needed to ensure its enduring legacy. You, who have long been devoted to our teachings, have requested this inscription. I dare not refuse.

I, Boxiao, respectfully note: The Daoist tradition traces its origins to the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. Its Dao takes clarity, tranquility, and non-action as its essence, and compassion, frugality, and non-contention as its practice—all harmonizing with the subtleties of the Six Classics, indispensable even to rulers. As for its claims of immortality and the preservation of life’s essence, these are the concerns of recluses in the mountains. Thus, those who truly master the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi must grasp both root and branch. The effortless governance of Yu Shun, the compassion and frugality of Emperor Wen of Han, the gentle Dao of Emperor Guangwu, and the purity of Gai Gong—all stem from the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, exemplifying true mastery.

Now, our master has been entrusted with the imperial mandate to restore the old canon and recover lost texts from across the realm, amassing a great treasury of teachings. This endeavor, both in root and branch, is not without merit. Such an achievement is worthy of inscription. Thus, I respectfully comply and inscribe these words:

*(Here follows the inscription, to be translated as a separate section.)*

The Primordial of the Vast Void,
the Self-So of Emptiness and Nothingness.
From Nonbeing comes Being,
accumulating to form earth and heaven.
Once the Two Modes were established,
the Seven Luminaries began their dance.
Creation nurtures and poisons,
life and death shift through kalpas.
As human or thing,
as ghost or immortal.
Above the Three Realms,
before the kalpas vast.
Above, no further color;
below, no deeper abyss.
Within lies the Great Brahmā,
all-pervading, subtle, and boundless.
The Jade Tone gathers qi,
the numinous wind assembles mist.
Thus the scripture takes form,
radiant and resplendent.
In the boundless Dragon Han era,
its transmission began.
Celestial Perfected analyzed and expounded,
the ranks of immortals offered reverence.
Bestowed upon the world,
the Five Thousand Words of Mystery.
The Three Caverns and Four Supplements,
in sequence they followed.
After Guan Yin,
schools branched and spread.
The Han histories recorded
two hundred and five chapters.
By the rise of Jin and Xingning,
its light further extended.
Through Tang to Song,
its warp and weft were complete.
Lost texts were sought,
gathered from mountains and rivers.
Stored in the secret palace,
adorned with brocade and jade.
When Heaven’s Mandate changed,
the scriptures followed the master’s return.
Bound and shelved for long,
they nearly became fragmented scrolls.
In the Great Revival,
the Perfected ruled the heavens.
The celestial roll unfurled,
auspicious rites were performed.
Renewed and resplendent,
gold and coin were bestowed.
The sagely grace vast as the ocean,
illuminating the celestial springs.
The scriptures were carved on tablets,
to be sought and gathered.
From Wei and Liang,
they were brought to Han and Yan.
The scriptures had their gaps,
to be supplemented and engraved.
With that Jade Void,
this Flying Mystery was exchanged.
How was the tripod cast?
The dragon-chariot soared high.
Clutching its scales in vain,
clasping the bow, tears streamed.
The Emperor of Mingchang,
devoted to serving the immortals,
granted halls and constructed chambers,
appointing officials to oversee the work.
With reverent harmony,
diligence was utmost.
Before a year had passed,
auspicious conditions converged.
A thousand treasures gathered,
ten thousand craftsmen assembled.
The Luhu Mountain stood tall,
carved moats and walls linked in splendor.
When the work was complete,
the numinous revealed itself.

At the august feast of Emperor Shizong,
joining the imperial banquet,
who would await the chariot?
The distant Shao music echoed.
Descending to witness the success,
great blessings were bestowed.
May the Son of Heaven live long,
for a hundred million years.
The Daoist teachings spread,
flowing to the eight directions.

*Record of Auspicious Responses at the Great Heavenly Offering of the Celestial-Long Everlasting Abbey*
In the first year of Mingchang, the second month, on the day *guimao*, the Empress Dowager’s spirit was serene and her virtue proclaimed.
On the following day *jiachen*, the Emperor paid court at Longqing Palace, inquired after her health at the Cixun Hall, and upon departing the sleeping chambers, could barely walk straight. Morning and evening, he attended to her meals, consulted on medicines, and never loosened his sash, believing that prayers to the gods above and below were recorded in the classics.
On the day *renzhi*, a seven-day Great Heavenly Offering was held at the Celestial-Long Everlasting Abbey, praying for the Empress Dowager’s boundless longevity. Five million coins were granted, along with 280 catties of plum sandalwood, aloeswood, and *jiangzhen* incense, five taels of borneol, and the following were appointed as officiants: General of Manifest Valor, Commander of the Palace Guard and Hostelry, Grand Master Yin, Western Upper Chamber Attendant Zhang Ruyou, and Left Rectifier Wanyan Aluhan. An edict was issued to the Abbot of the Celestial-Long Abbey, Master of Harmonious Pervasion Sun Mingdao: "The Daoist teachings of Lord Lao are China’s own, unlike the Western Hu of Buddhism who clamor with cymbals. From this day forward, no ritual instruments shall be used in offerings."

On that day, a memorial of blue-green words was presented for the Great Heavenly Offering:
*"The heir and Son of Heaven, your subject, humbly addresses the Three Pure Ones, the Four Emperors, and the Two August Sovereigns. Reverently considering the great continuity of divine response, we look up to the compassionate court. Daily, we serve with devotion. Having prepared the nine provinces’ offerings, we rely on Heaven’s blessing to unfold the auspices of ten thousand years. Yet, by chance, the seasons fell out of harmony, and a slight illness arose. Thus, we knock at the profound gates of the divine, solemnly preparing this secret offering. We hope that filial piety will move the true chariot, that the divine will peer down and perceive, bestowing the extension of bright destiny. May all beings forever depend on this great shelter. Your subject, with utmost sincerity, offers this prayer."*

On the day *xinyou*, the Emperor visited the Celestial-Long Abbey, performed the incense offering, and returned to the palace. The officiants and High Master of Rituals reported the opening of the memorial. The Emperor observed a seven-day fast.
On the day *guihai*, nine memorials of blue-green words were bestowed from within the palace, along with four catties of aloeswood and ten taels of borneol.
On the day *yichou*, during the midday ritual, nine white cranes came from the northwest, followed by ten more, all gliding and soaring above the altar. In an instant, thousands arrived, filling the sky on all sides, circling and lingering from noon until late afternoon before slowly departing. At that time, the clouds and sky were bright and clear. From the southwest, a red light descended, illuminating the altar hall. The people of the capital gazed in worship, their voices united in praise, all attributing it to the Emperor’s filial devotion.
On the day *bingyin*, the Empress Dowager sent the Supervisor of Longqing Palace, Gao Gaoshou, to bestow fifty taels of silver and four bolts of silk, instructing the Daoist assembly to perform repentance rites.
On that same day, at midday during the ritual, four cranes came from the northwest, soon followed by over fifty, circling above the altar for a long while.
On the day *dingmao*, the Left Chamberlain for Ceremonials, Lu Ji, was appointed as substitute officiant. At noon during the ritual, five cranes came from the northwest, circling above the halls and pavilions. The Daoist assembly presented incense at the Ten Directions Altar. A great crane descended, skimming the eaves of the Jade Void Hall before dancing above the altar pavilions and departing.
At midnight, as the memorial was burned, a gentle wind arose from the northwest, swirling the paper ashes upward in spirals for hundreds of thousands of feet, straight into the heavens. Soon, a red light illuminated the jade halls, and the crowd gasped in awe, gazing in worship.

On the day *wuchen*, the rites were concluded.

Not yet half a month later, the Empress Dowager’s health was restored as before. There was at this temple’s Jade Void Hall a Daoist acolyte charged with tending incense, Xu Wuzhen by name, who had witnessed all these events. He commissioned artisans to carve a wooden *Illustrated Record of the Celestial Responses to the Universal Grand Offering at the Great Temple of Heaven’s Eternity*, detailing the entire sequence from beginning to end, and entreated the Court Historian’s Compiler, Minister Zhu Lan, to inscribe the account for the annals of the realm.

I reflect that in the Han dynasties, when yellow cranes descended upon the Taiye Pond and thirty white cranes passed over the Feng and Shan altars on Mount Tai, their arrival was purely fortuitous, devoid of any deliberate intent. Yet the historians of the time still deemed it an auspicious omen, recording it in the *Book of the Western Capital* and the *Records of the Eastern Observatory*, pairing it with the sagely Son of Heaven’s filial virtue—a virtue so profound that it moved Heaven and Earth and forged a communion with the divine, resplendent and luminous indeed!

Now, as I too serve in the Office of the Grand Historian, it is my duty to faithfully record these events. Internally, they shall be inscribed in the imperial archives for future historians to select and preserve; externally, they shall broadcast the sovereign’s virtue to aid in governing the teachings of the Four Seas. Thus, I dared not firmly refuse Xu Wuzhen’s request. Taking his records as my source, I have compiled this *Record of Auspicious Responses to the Universal Grand Offering at the Temple of Heaven’s Eternity*.

As the *Book of Documents* states: “The foundation of love lies in one’s parents; the foundation of reverence lies in one’s elders. Begin within the family and state, and extend it to the Four Seas.” It is to be hoped that all subjects of the realm, upon hearing of this, will be moved by the Emperor’s virtue and emulate his example. May every person cultivate the conduct of Zeng and Min, and may the customs of the Tang and Yu eras—where every household was worthy of enfeoffment—be witnessed once more in our time.

On the day *wuwu* of the fifth month, the Court Gentleman for Miscellaneous Affairs, Hanlin Academician for Textual Composition and Concurrent Compiler of the Court Historians, Acting Minister Zhu Lan, bows and kneels to respectfully inscribe this.

**Stele Inscription for the Universal Grand Offering at the Great Temple of Heaven’s Eternity in the Central Capital**

Composed by Jue Huaiying, Director of the Directorate of Education and Concurrent Hanlin Academician, Participating Compiler of the Court Historians, and Drafter of Imperial Edicts

Since antiquity, the sages have revered Heaven and Earth and honored the spirits, and the rites of prayer, sacrifice, and offering are extolled in the *Book of Songs* and the *Book of Documents*. They established altars to mark positions, presented sacrificial animals and silk as offerings, burned incense to convey fragrance, and employed invocators to deliver prayers—seeking to avert calamity, prolong life, and invoke blessings, all with specific entreaties.

In later ages, these rites were sometimes observed and sometimes abandoned, and their details could no longer be thoroughly examined. Yet the practices of expiation and supplication were preserved solely among the Daoist tradition. Purification rites followed strict methods, and offerings adhered to prescribed forms: purification to atone for transgressions, offerings to transcend calamity—thus entreating blessings from the gods of Heaven and Earth. Since the Han and Tang dynasties, these methods have become increasingly refined. Though they differ from ancient practices, the essence remains the same: purity in approaching the rites and reverence in conveying sincerity.

In the second month of the first year of the *Mingchang* era, the Empress Dowager fell gravely ill. The Emperor attended her day and night in her chambers, consulting physicians and examining remedies. All that could be done to care for her as the mother of the realm was done to its utmost, yet her condition showed no improvement. The Son of Heaven was deeply alarmed, his anxiety etched upon his face. He dispatched attendants to summon all those skilled in prayer and supplication, declaring: “Among all methods of prayer, none is more solemn than that of the Daoists. Their so-called Universal Grand Offering surpasses all others in its comprehensiveness.” He then ordered the disbursement of five million coins from the imperial treasury to the Temple of Heaven’s Eternity, commanding that a grand offering be held. Additionally, he bestowed upon the temple quantities of plumeria, aloeswood, and borneol incense—over four hundred *jin* in total—specifically appointing the Commander of the Palace Guards and Concurrent Director of the Guest Office, Da Zhongyin; the West Upper Palace Gate Attendant, Zhang Ruyou; and the Left Rectifier, Wanyan Aluhan, to oversee the rites. He further instructed the Supervisor of the Temple, the Master of Harmonious Emptiness, Sun Mingdao: “The Dao of Lord Lao originated in China and emphasizes purity and tranquility, unlike the Western barbarian teachings of the Buddhists, which concern themselves with clashing cymbals. Henceforth, such practices shall no longer be employed in offering ceremonies.”

Thereupon, the Emperor observed a vigil of purification. The following day, he personally visited the altar site to present incense and offerings. Upon his return, nine secret memorials were sent from the palace, all inscribed in his own hand. The Empress Dowager also dispatched palace envoys to present silver, silks, and other gifts as offerings of repentance and gratitude. On the day the altar was opened, the meals of both palaces were vegetarian for seven days, aligning with the duration of the offering. The meticulousness of the preparations and the sincerity of the devotion were truly unparalleled.

Three days into the offering, as the rites were in full progress, a crimson mist arose in the southwest, its radiance illuminating the altar and halls. Nine white cranes came from the northwest, soaring above the altar. Soon after, over ten more arrived, followed by cranes converging from all directions—so numerous they could not be counted, likely numbering in the thousands. They circled above and below from noon until dusk before gradually dispersing.

At that moment, the officiating officials and Daoist masters, moved by the spectacle, prostrated themselves in reverence before the altar. The elders and common folk of the capital, their eyes fixed upon the scene, raised their hands to their foreheads in awe, attributing it to the Emperor’s filial piety.

From then on, cranes arrived in groups of five or four, sometimes numbering in the dozens, appearing day after day. Finally, a great crane descended in a leisurely glide, brushing against the eaves and pillars before circling above the halls and pavilions. After some time, it vanished from sight.

On the evening the memorials were burned, the sky was clear and bright, a gentle wind arose, and the smoke and ashes ascended without limit. Suddenly, a red light illuminated the altar halls, and the assembled crowd, enraptured, knew that the immortals and sages were not far from mortal kind.

Soon after the offering concluded, the Empress Dowager’s health was swiftly restored, and the court and the realm rejoiced together in celebration. The Court Historian’s Compiler, Zhu Lan, recorded these events, and many scholar-officials composed songs and eulogies. Master Sun further requested this humble text to be inscribed and engraved.

Huaiying remarks: The Dao of Heaven is profound and distant, and the principles of its interaction with the mortal realm cannot be fully known. What *can* be known is this: when one cultivates virtue below, responses manifest above—this is the inevitable principle.

The crane is a transcendent bird, nesting in deep forests and roaming marshes. When humans approach, it spreads its wings and departs—who compels it to come? I have heard Daoists regard it as the steed of immortals. If this is so, then the resonance between them is manifest indeed.

Confucius said: "Serve one’s father with filial piety, and one serves Heaven with clarity; serve one’s mother with filial piety, and one serves Earth with discernment—extending this, there is nothing that cannot be penetrated." The *Book of Documents* states: "Spirits and deities have no fixed abode; they respond only to utmost sincerity." When the teachings of the Dao’s subtle essence are practiced with purity and reverence, and when they convey the sagely Son of Heaven’s devotion to his kin, how could the response not be swift?

Having recorded what I have witnessed, I append this eulogy:

Above reigns the Emperor,
Whom all spirits revere.
Though their hearing is keen,
Without sincerity, no communion is clear.

O august and divine,
He inherits Heaven’s Way.
No petition he made,
Yet for his kin he did pray.

He embraced Daoist learning,
Whose roots lie in mystery.
Through pure reverence alone,
He sought to reach Heaven’s decree.

The altar stood solemn,
Its rites profound and concealed.
The spirits above took heed,
And blessings swiftly revealed.

Then came auspicious vapors,
Neither cloud nor smoke,
Descending to the altar halls,
Their radiance bright and woke.

And cranes, by the hundreds,
Appeared in flight,
Tame as if led,
Skimming eaves in delight.

On that day, the Emperor’s devotion
Brought blessings to his mother’s abode.
The Son of Heaven declared,
"Praise to the Daoist master!"

The master bowed deeply,
"All thanks to the Emperor’s filial heart."
For ten thousand myriad years,
May the Dao’s teachings impart.

The Most High is the ancestor of primordial chaos. At first, the Three Pure Ones were born—from the Jade Pure to the Grand Pure—then the Nine Qi emerged, from the Boundless to the Unconditioned. With pure yang, the Thirty-Six Heavens were divided—from the Great Yellow to the Great Veil; with pure yin, the Thirty-Six Earths were formed—from Moist Brilliance to the Abyssal Depths—all within the realm of dominion.

Though dwelling upon cinnabar terraces and within purple palaces, the Three Great Immortals, Nine Great Emperors, Twenty-Seven Heavenly Lords, Eighty-One Great Ministers, One Thousand Two Hundred Celestial Officers, Twenty-Four Thousand Spirit Bureaus, Seventy Thousand Immortal Youths and Jade Maidens, Five Hundred Million Heavenly Soldiers, and Divine Kings—all attend upon them in service.

The Ten Great Grotto-Heavens, Thirty-Six Grotto-Realms, Seventy-Two Blessed Lands, Thirty-Six Pure Retreats, and Twenty-Four Transformative Governances all look up in submission.

Free from the calamities of the Ninefold Yang and the Sixfold Yin, they transcend the cycles of the Stone and Mustard Seed Cities. Some attend the Primordial Beginning, reviewing the registers of the Nine Palaces’ ascent and descent; some visit the Jade Dawn, perusing the ledgers of the Three Realms’ life and death. Some tread upon cloud-brocade and their bodies gleam like gold; some sit upon lotus leaves, their faces radiating sunlight. They don crowns of sevenfold radiance and cloud-silk, draped in ninefold splendor. Some ride eightfold jade chariots; some harness five-colored divine dragons. They raise cinnabar standards of streaming clouds and unfurl crane canopies of ninefold light. Some recline behind jeweled curtains; some wave dusters adorned with pearl banners. Some, in dark caps and plain robes, ride white horses with crimson scales; some, with jade forms and golden countenances, spur azure rainbows and white beasts.

Some address the August Emperor of the Golden Gate as the Lord of the Empty Firmament; some, in the Grand Tenuity, are called the Heavenly Sovereign. Some emerged in the Dragon Han era as the Master of the Mystic Center; some appeared in the Red Brightness epoch as the Ancient Teacher. Some are called Yu Hua Zi, who drew the Eight Trigrams for Fu Xi; some are called Da Cheng Zi, who sowed the hundred grains for Yan Di. Some are called Guang Cheng Zi, who withdrew to Kongtong; some are called Wu Cheng Zi, who dwelled on Guye. Some bestowed upon the Perfected of Pure Emptiness the Twenty-Four Diagrams; some granted the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign the Thirty-Six Scriptures. Secret elixir texts were sealed in jade caskets and precious chests; purple characters were stored in jasper halls and gem chambers. The *Numinous Chapters* were transmitted to the Azure Lad; the Dharma’s inception began. True images were left with the Queen Mother of the West; the first Daoist temples were built.

Thereupon, they descended as spirits during the Shang, in the reign of Yang Jia. They were incarnated in suffering in the Gengshen year, riding a nine-dragon carriage with light streaming from five-colored pearls. Entrusting their transcendent remains to soaring flight, they split open the left side of their wondrous body. After eighty-one years of gestation, they displayed seventy-two auspicious signs. Their appearance—pointing to a tree, they took the surname Li; with white hair, they were called the Old Master, or Bo Yang. Some called them the Grand Historian Dan, or named them Yuan, De, Ya, Shi, or styled them Sheng, Guang, Wen, Shi—no fewer than thirty-six titles.

Their eyes were like rivers, their mouths like seas; their brows like the sun, their temples like the moon. Their noses bore twin pillars; their foreheads, three ridges. Their cheeks resembled transverse ridges; their jaws, level mounds. Nine feet tall, their hands grasped ten lines. With square pupils and broad faces, their white skin bore brocade patterns—how could they possess only seventy-two marks?

Since the time of Kings Wen and Wu, they held the offices of Archivist and Chronicler. Perceiving the decline of Zhou’s virtue and lamenting the unenlightened customs of the Hu, they passed through Hangu Pass, intending to cross the Flowing Sands. A purple aura stretched across the sky; a blue ox bore their carriage. Finally, they inscribed the book requested by the Pass Keeper and revived the bones of Xu Jia, who had already died. This occurred in the twenty-fifth year of King Zhao, on the jiazi day of the seventh month.

Today, near the ruins of the Upper Clear Palace in Luoyang, ancient trees coil like dragons and serpents. Above one hollow lies the very spot where the Most High tethered his carriage.

In our dynasty, the Hebei Circuit was elevated to the Central Capital. The Prefectural Governor, Wanyan Echu, invited the Gatekeeper Daoist Wu Dashun to oversee this Ten Directions Palace. He summoned scholars from all quarters, enabling them to sweep and tend its halls—a great and noble endeavor.

Wu Dashun requested an inscription from me to be carved in stone. Fearing that the world might not understand how the Most High came to this, I have recorded these details in full.

As for the transmission of the Dao to Gengsang, there was the analogy of the crouching swan; the discourse on ritual with Confucius drew the sigh of "like a dragon." Later, he was born in the market of the Green Ram, and in distant times ascended the palace of the White Deer—all matters of subsequent record. These accounts lie within the *Daoist Canon*; here, they are but briefly noted.

Thus respectfully recorded by Sun Chunfu.

The stele inscription for the palace and abbey is hereby concluded.
