**Preface to the Hymn and Commentary on the Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness Spoken by the Most High Lord Lao**

When the source is pure, the stream is still, and the waves of the Dharma-sea settle;
When the stem is firm and the root deep, it embraces the circulation of pure yang *qi*.
Waxing and waning, ebb and flow—all under Heaven revolve in ceaseless motion.
Tracing the origins of Heaven and Earth’s portents, exploring the pivotal essence of yin and yang,
Man entrusts his form to Heaven and Earth, returning to purity and stillness as his natural end;
He blends his *qi* with yin and yang, possessing the transformations of true constancy and change.
Purity, though stirred, does not turn turbid;
Stillness, though disturbed, does not move.
Heaven attains the One and is pure; Earth attains the One and is tranquil; Man attains the One and is numinous—this One is the Spirit.
When the numinous source is profound and clear, the sagely Dao flows unimpeded;
Abiding in quiescence, it responds and transforms without limit.
Stirred, it communicates without hindrance, endlessly generating and completing.
Heaven and Earth possess this constant nature, pure and still without remainder;
Yet men and women lack this constant mind, lost in delusion and bound to attachments.
Who can halt the turbid and gradually restore clarity? Only then may one attain it.

Thus, our Most High Lord, in his great compassion, expounded the *Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness*,
Establishing teachings to guide the vulgar, aiding the upright and upholding the ancestral,
Striving to transform the people and return them to the Root, enabling them to embrace the True and hold fast to the One.
By embodying the Mysterious Origin, refining the spirit to merge with the Dao,
They ascend as feathered immortals, soaring without error.
Those who faithfully receive and practice its essential principles shall all attain resonance,
For none fail to achieve purity and stillness as the norm for all under Heaven—
Even the myriad Perfected and Sages emerge from this alone.

**Hymn and Commentary on the Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness Spoken by the Most High Lord Lao**

The Five Primes stand as the origin, the Void and Non-being the Dao’s spontaneity.
The Primordial Chaos wields the ancestral authority, its wondrous body aligning with the Mysterious Ancestor.
Expounding the Teachings to illuminate the Supreme, knowing constancy through metaphorical elucidation.
By this pure and still virtue, the transformative teachings establish the scriptural canon.

Lord Lao said:
The Great Dao is formless, giving birth to Heaven and Earth;
The Great Dao conceals itself in form, its true essence merging in profound obscurity.
The Two Modes divide at the first sign, the One *qi* operates without cease.
Its covering and bearing are truly unfathomable, nurturing and completing in perfect tranquility.
Like a potter shaping vessels, all creatures, though dull, contain the numinous.
The Great Dao is without emotion, yet it moves the sun and moon;
The sun and moon traverse the void, shining brightly and impartially.
Those who attain Heaven endure in illumination, adorning all things to universal communion.
With form, they bask in radiant warmth; without emotion, they merge with the fusion of images.
Yin and yang constantly embody the Dao, ceaselessly abiding in the Great Void.

The Great Dao is nameless, eternally nurturing the myriad things.
The wondrous Dao is truly hard to name, yet it encompasses the birth of all things.
In due time, it fills the earth’s veins; in trust, it endows Heaven’s clarity.
Breathing forth the true ebb and flow, the harmonious Great Transformation is accomplished.
Circular and penetrating, it returns to unity; high and low lie level and even.
I know not its name, so I forcefully call it the Dao.
Without form, it is distant and traceless, beyond names within the primordial chaos.
Before the sprouting of Heaven, Earth, sun, or moon, how could there be rain, clouds, or wind?
Breaking open the signs of the embryo, piercing through the obscurity of phenomena,
By this, creation is divided, and the authority of the boundless Dao is established.

Now, the Dao possesses purity and turbidity, movement and stillness.
Purity and turbidity are the *qi* of yin and yang, surging and flowing above and below.
Spontaneously, they form transformations, ultimately aligning with perfect communion.
The myriad kinds contain nurturance, the Three Primes harmoniously unite.
Heaven and Earth conjoin in supreme harmony, all converging in the One True Emptiness.
Heaven is pure, Earth is turbid; Heaven moves, Earth is still.
Man is pure, woman is turbid; man moves, woman is still.
At the inception, the Two Modes divide, and humanity, most numinous and noble, is honored.
The Three Powers stabilize the cosmos; the Two Things determine Heaven and Earth.
All kinds contain the true *qi*; the primordial is the gate of true reality.
Hard and soft complement each other in function—who can abide in embodying the Dao?

Descending from the Root to the branches, it gives birth to the myriad things.
From the Root, the true body is communicated; returning to the Origin, the causes of the branches are seen.
Spring’s yang spreads luxuriant flourishing; autumn’s season governs withering decline.
The Supreme Ultimate generates form and transformation; pure harmony creates things anew.
The pivot of the Great Mechanism propels the great movement, entrusted to the workings of the divine.
Purity is the source of turbidity; stillness is the foundation of movement.
The principle of purity and stillness is profound—who can fathom its depths?
Observing emptiness, all realms are dispelled; severing appearances, all minds are enlightened.
The moon of wisdom flows through the cinnabar river; the clouds of compassion cover the emerald peaks.
Abiding in quiescence, the spirit does not move; responding to things, it manifests as a knowing companion.

When man can constantly abide in purity and stillness, Heaven and Earth all return to him.
When man awakens to constant purity and stillness, he knows the wondrous sagely mechanism of the Source.
In the Great Beginning, there is no defilement or stagnation; in perfect quiescence, radiance is concealed.
Silently, it enfolds the sand-realm; dimly, it penetrates the Purple Tenuity.
After the Three Primes ascend and descend, Heaven and Earth all return to it.

Now, man’s spirit delights in purity, yet his mind disturbs it; man’s mind delights in stillness, yet his desires drag it away.
The mind is the abode of the numinous—when the spirit dwells in stillness, it may rest.
Gluttony, anger, and delusion arise easily; discipline, concentration, and wisdom are hard to behold.
The profound essential lies in perfect correctness; steadfastly maintain inner leisure within leisure.
Constantly free from the six desires, the Dharma-realm naturally expands.

One can constantly dispel desires, and the mind becomes still of itself; clarify the mind, and the spirit becomes pure of itself.
If one dispels all passions and desires, clarifying the mind, the wondrous insight of profound vision arises.
United with the True, it is not objectified; returning to quiescence, it abandons all multiplicity.
Waters stretch afar, merging with the stillness of Heaven; mountains stand tall, bearing the coldness of the moon.
Circular and fused, wisdom is communicated; within the pot, the golden pellet revolves.

Naturally, the six desires do not arise, and the three poisons are extinguished.
Right mindfulness is without partiality, harmonizing with the Void and spontaneity.
The six sense-dusts instantly cease; the three poisons’ afflictions must be cured.
The wondrous Dao transcends kalpas of emptiness; the whole spirit ascends to the heavens above.
In these subtle and secret places, the Mysterious Female perpetuates itself.

Those who cannot do so fail because the mind is not yet clarified and desires are not yet dispelled.
Lost on the path, they forsake their homeland, all due to obscuring their own radiance.
The mind, floating, is truly easily moved; familiar realms are hard to forget.

When desire’s taint arises, how can it be dispelled?
Perverse and cunning thoughts only lead one further astray.
Yet turning the head, one may awaken—
In self-reflection, the Empty King is seen.

Those who can dispel it look inward at the mind,
And find the mind is not the mind.
Awakened to all sensory leaks,
The eye of Dao opens clearly.

Form and sound are not obstacles;
Knowledge and perception must be buried deep.
When spirit is still, a thousand disasters vanish;
When the heart is empty, ten thousand cares turn to ash.

A pure breeze passes through jade doors,
And of itself, sweet music comes.

Look outward at form,
And find form is not form.
All appearances are seen as non-appearance—
Form is but a seed of nothingness.

Inwardly containing the true Dharma-realm,
The body merges with the great Void.
Clouds grow still, and the toad’s light emerges;
The pool settles, and silk-white hues spread.

Such clear revelation—
Where else would one seek a special path?

Observe things from afar,
And find things are not things.
When these three are awakened,
Only emptiness is seen.

In tranquil illumination, observe all things—
How could the host of spirits differ?
The same truth is not to be seen;
Traces vanish, and none can imitate.

The elder in the hall, clear and bright,
Rests beyond all dharmas.
Mysterious, mysterious—mystery dissolves,
And the eight directions stretch boundless.

Observe emptiness, and emptiness too is empty—
Emptiness has no emptiness.
The vast expanse of true emptiness opens;
Looking back, not one thing remains.

Fused with the great desert,
Profoundly still, the essence is void.
Illuminating through, sound is ever silent;
Perfectly penetrating, nature is spontaneous.

Within and without are as one,
Not returning to the primordial origin.
What is emptied is already nothing—
Nothingness, too, is nothing.

When the heart is seen as no-thing,
Nothingness itself is truly nothing.
Why labor to remove delusion?
What need to distinguish fine from coarse?

In stillness and emptiness, skill arises;
Returning to truth, remain unwavering.
Such subtle and secret workings—
Who would dare impose a name?

When nothingness itself is nothing,
Profoundly still, ever at rest.
All dharmas are originally empty;
Nothingness unites with sagely achievement.

Profound stillness is neither within nor without,
Silent, east and west dissolve.
Where heart and realm are both forgotten,
Square and round become as one.

Vast and obscure, beyond creation,
All things are pervaded and free.
Silence has no silence—
How could desire arise?

Desire not arising,
This is true stillness.
Provisional stillness is but a temporary body;
One must still remove the cause of desire.

When false conditions cease thus,
True stillness renews itself.
Accord with the unborn Dharma,
And know the spring of endless day.

Alone, beyond heaven and earth,
At ease, one roams freely.
Responding to things with true constancy,
One attains the true nature.

Constant in response, constant in stillness,
Ever pure and still.
Once settled, one reaches true constancy—
The spirit’s light cannot be measured.

It illuminates the chamber of the three poisons,
Pierces the hall of the five luminaries.
The jewel moon appears in the clear sky;
Deluded clouds vanish without trace.

A pure breeze spreads the message,
Responding to things as they unfold.
In such purity and stillness,
One gradually enters the true Dao.

Having entered the true Dao,
This is called attaining the Dao.
Through kalpas vast, it remains perfectly complete,
Without darkness, without light.

The Valley Spirit is ever still;
The Dharma-sea is serene and clear.
Right mindfulness follows the true path;
A settled heart reaches the wondrous course.

Forever freed from the bonds of birth and death,
One roams the three realms at will.
Though called attaining the Dao,
In truth, there is nothing attained.

Having sunk into silence, advance through sound;
Deeply penetrate the subtle principle.
True emptiness—could there be attainment?
True form originally requires no cultivation.

Eating and drinking pass as they will;
Dignity and conduct are free.
Suddenly, all deliberation ceases—
In tranquility, wholeness is preserved.

To transform sentient beings,
This is called attaining the Dao.
Those who awaken to it
May transmit the sagely Dao.

To enlighten sentient beings,
All manner of seeking is forgotten.
Instantly transcending the fruit of no-leakage,
How could there be any root or cause?

Grasping and rejecting cannot move it;
Causal conditions too are cut off.
Suddenly, all is let go—
The sagely Dao may be transmitted and preserved.

Laozi said:
The superior person does not contend;
The inferior person loves to contend.
Why does the superior person not contend?
Diligently, they hold fast to their resolve.

Dwelling in truth, ever serene,
Cultivating simplicity, hidden in mystery.
Looking up and down, they observe heaven’s principle,
Whether in poverty or success, they reach the Dao’s depths.

Alas for those who have not yet awakened—
They vie for dharmas, obscuring their heart-fields.

Superior virtue does not act as virtue;
Inferior virtue clings to virtue.
Those who cling
Cannot be called virtuous.

Virtue’s transformation seeks no reward;
Broad in kindness, they refuse to boast.
Veiling their light, they conceal great capacity;
Their bright nature shines like solid ice.

Silently, they accord with the distant heavens;
Deeply, they penetrate the vast Dao.
How could they be like foolish scholars,
Who cling to distinctions and boast of their abilities?

Sentient beings do not attain the true Dao
Because they have deluded minds.
Most turn their backs on the Dao,
Seeking outwardly in confusion.

Delusion arises from this;
The true spirit dims and fades.
Originally, nothing is lacking—
Why forcefully persist in cultivation?

Suddenly, the clouds of delusion are swept away,
And the silver toad shines upon the jade tower.

Once there is a deluded mind,
It startles the spirit.
Once the spirit is startled,
It clings to the myriad things.
Once it clings to the myriad things,
Greed and seeking arise.
Once greed and seeking arise,
This is affliction.

Planning affairs gives rise to delusion;
Departing from truth agitates the spirit.
All stems from the heart’s attachment to desire,
Clinging to things, stirring anger and blame.

Constantly harboring the fire of ignorance,
It adds to the dust of affliction.
From this, one receives karmic retribution,
Revolving through the six paths in suffering.

Affliction and delusion,
Worry and torment body and mind,
Bringing defilement and disgrace.
From delusion arise anger and desire;
From attachment and ignorance, obstacles form.

Sorrow and worry bind one endlessly;
Affliction coils ceaselessly.
Thus, one strays from the true Dao,
And from this, falls into karmic transgressions.

Turning the light inward in reflection,
One awakens to the wondrous mystery within.
Drifting through birth and death,
Constantly sinking in the sea of suffering,
Forever losing the true Dao.

Affliction arises from thoughts—
When has one ever awakened to one’s own heart?
Vast and boundless, suffering and disgrace;
Restless and troubled, how could one pause to reflect?

Dying in vain without respite,
Living emptily until now.
Thus, the true Dao is lost,
And dream-thoughts invade ever more.

The true and constant Dao
Is attained by those who awaken.
Those who awaken to the Dao
Are ever pure and still.

If one penetrates heaven and earth,
Both are sustained by the Dao’s qi.
Hiding the root, deepening the stem,
Extinguishing the po, the hun is at peace.

Having awakened to the path of long life,
One must open the gate of enduring vision.
The whole spirit transforms itself—
Supreme Dharma King, revered.

The Most High Lord Lao said *The Eulogy and Annotation of the Classic of Constant Purity and Stillness*, thus concluded.
