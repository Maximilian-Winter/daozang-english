# 太上洞神五星赞

**Hymn of the Supreme Cavern-Spirit Five Stars**
*Composed by Zhang Pingzi*

The Eastern Star of the Year, also called the Wood Star or Waḍauma, belongs to the East and governs Qi and Wu.

The Eastern Star of the Year is in truth the essence of Wood, the son of the Azure Emperor. Vast and luminous, wherever it resides brings fortune—none can rival its grandeur. When the ruler’s virtue is perfect and the Dao and righteousness prevail, winds and rains arrive in harmony, the hundred grains ripen, the sovereign enjoys longevity and prosperity, the people grow wealthy and upright, the Central Kingdom knows peace, and the Four Barbarians submit at court.

If the ruler’s governance is cruel and oppressive, forsaking benevolence and harmony, the star bristles with wrath, and the realm plunges into strife. Should he reject remonstrance and heed slander, violating the standards of reverence and solemnity, calamity fills the earth, inferiors usurp their superiors, and younger brothers plot against their elder brothers.

When its hue is reddish-yellow, winds and droughts multiply. When white or black, floods and warfare arise. If it conjoins with Metal, great generals perish. If obscured by the Moon, consorts and empresses fall from favor. Entering the Supreme Subtlety, the ruler faces sorrow, but amnesties follow, and the lands of Qin in the Eastern Well know peace.

Should it guard the Ghosts, the state employs axes and drills. Encircling the Void and Danger, Qi suffers disasters. Dwelling in the Chamber, ruler and ministers rejoice together. Lingering in the Heart, millet and grain flourish. Guarding the Horn, loyal and worthy men are promoted. Abiding in the Tail, the altars of soil and grain exult. Passing through the Clan, many joys arise within. Traversing the Neck, Han and Zheng dispatch armies. Entering the Winnowing Basket, the palace brims with strife. Crossing the Dipper, Wu and Yue know peace. Mounting the Void, ancestral ranks fall into disorder. Trespassing the Woman, the palace women revel in delight. Guarding the Ox, famine, cold, and tiger attacks afflict the land. Circling the Rooftop, sacrifices to the gods lose their fragrance. Trespassing the House, yin and yang hasten their course. Guarding the Wall, the voices of Yao and Shun resound as one. Entering the Straddler, the virtuous are cast aside. Passing through the Bond, envoys bearing decrees depart. Guarding the Stomach, the people suffer hunger and sickness. Dwelling in the Mane, the king enforces harsh punishments. Moving in reverse, it brings disaster and banditry. Appearing by day, the ruler grows weak while ministers overstep their bounds.

Should the Net guard the Bond, disaster befalls men and oxen. Mounting the Stomach to enter the Well, prisons overflow with lawsuits and soldiers grieve. Circling Heaven, the dead exceed half. Trespassing the Willow, the five grains grow dense. Lingering in the Spread, ruler and ministers live in harmony. Entering the Wings, grain withers and people flee. Circling the Axle, the wilds teem with mourning and sickness. Trespassing the Chamber, generals and ministers share in sorrow.

O rulers of the land, take heed and cultivate solitude! Pacify and nurture the people, ever increasing your cultivation of luminous blessings. The divine principle aids the good and punishes the wicked, curbing desires. Reverently serve the Three Luminaries and diligently cultivate eternal felicity.

Wherever the Wood Star travels, the corresponding regions follow its course. When its color is azure, it brings fortune and celebration, augmenting offices and emoluments. If it moves in reverse and its hue changes, it brings disaster, and where it meets Earth, the lives of men and their destinies mirror its effects.

To avert its baleful influences, one should plant the five fruit trees and display azure banners; wearing azure robes brings good fortune.

The Southern Sparkling Deluder Star, also called the Fire Star, the Cloud River, or the Punishment Star, belongs to the South and governs Chu and Yue.

The essence of the South is also called the Punishment Star, the son of the Vermilion Emperor, who oversees scrutiny and illumination. Each year, in the tenth and eleventh months, it enters the first palace of the Supreme Subtlety to receive its mandate. It does not tarry in the lands of the virtuous but moves in and out of the domains of the unrighteous.

When it lingers or trespasses, it brings calamity; when it encircles, it brings disaster. When it emerges, war stirs; when it withdraws, war subsides. Its circling and halting bring illness and mourning. This arises from the ruler’s negligence and arrogance, causing ministers and subjects to suffer harm. Whether advancing or retreating, its movements are unpredictable in scale—now bringing floods, now drought, prosperity and scarcity alternating in turn. It appears swiftly at dawn and ascends gradually at dusk. Its comings and goings defy measure: now present, now absent; now enraged, now seething; now horned, now radiant.

When it enters the Palace of Supreme Subtlety, the elder sister of Marquis Wen of Wei perishes; when it trespasses the Purple Forbidden precincts, a king dies. If it lingers over the Celestial River, floods surge; if it resides in the Stomach constellation, the realm’s granaries stand empty. Should it pierce the Feathered Forest, forbidden troops muster; if it tarries in the Spread constellation, the year is bountiful and the people prosper. Entering the Southern Dipper brings disaster to the chief minister; trespassing the Eastern Well brings water and fire omens. Dwelling in the Lesser Subtlety, recluses face peril; encircling the Celestial Orchard, the myriad households suffer famine. Circling the Ghost constellation, war and mourning arise together; entering the Pleiades, the northern barbarians lie in ambush. Residing in the Heart constellation, the ruler detests it; trespassing the Yellow Dragon, the empress and consorts grow anxious. Trespassing the House constellation, rice becomes tenfold in price; ascending the Rooftop, war erupts in the southern lands. Dwelling in the Tail, ministers grow disobedient; entering the Horn, generals are executed or wounded. Trespassing the Neck and the Throat, cities are submerged; trespassing the Ghost, the dead lie in sight of one another. Lingering in the Straddler, fathers disown sons; trespassing the Chariot, ministers rebel against the king. Ascending the Void, the ruler must go forth himself; dwelling in the Net, borderlands face surrendering troops. Entering the Wall, worthy scholars remain obscure; lingering in the Three Stars, war rages on all sides. Touching the Woman, cloth and silk become exorbitantly dear; dwelling in the Ox, the six livestock perish. Trespassing the Willow, famine and drought cost lands; trespassing the Horn, war erupts within the palace walls. Entering the Chariot-spokes, all people are conscripted; trespassing the Bond, troops march forth in strength. When it moves in reverse through the Dipper or encircles the Chamber, ministers flee, fathers and sons are torn apart. Traversing the heavens, the realm seethes like a boiling cauldron; lingering in the Winnowing Basket, people eat chaff and bran.

For rulers of lands, how can they not be vigilant? By restraining the self and returning to ritual, their posterity shall surely flourish. Let the ruler and father on high cultivate great blessings; let ministers and sons stand as if before an abyss. Thus, malevolent disasters shall vanish of themselves, and the celestial emolument shall endure forever.

When the Fire Star lingers over a land’s celestial division, it often brings fires, sores and swellings, disputes and slander, upheaval and change, as well as subordinates plotting against superiors and sudden terrors. If it reaches one’s natal constellation, it induces madness, feverish illnesses, and cautions against bows, arrows, blades, and staves—lest wounds and bloodshed occur—and against eerie, portentous speech. To avert its baleful influences, one should receive talismans upon red garments, distribute red adzuki beans to the poor, hang crimson banners, perform lamp-lighting meritorious deeds, recite scriptures inscribed on golden tablets and jade slips, light star lamps, and offer earth from one’s home—all bring good fortune.

The Central Quelling Star, also called the Earth Sentinel or the Rooster Exchange, governs Zhou and Liang. Here is the Quelling Star, the essence of Earth in the center, the son of the Yellow Emperor, also named the Earth Sentinel. The land where it resides must not be invaded. Its division suffers no disasters, and the five grains ripen in abundance. The ruler enjoys prosperity and joy, for his virtue is steadfast. If the ruler lacks inner benevolence and righteousness yet adorns himself with outward splendor, the star strays from its course, becoming ominous and perverse. Above, chaos reigns; below, strife erupts; east and west rebel. Heaven sends down disasters—hail and ceaseless rain, mountains collapsing, earth splitting, ghosts wailing in lament.

When it trespasses Wood, the empress and consorts fall; when it conjoins Water, armies suffer defeat after defeat. Touching the Horn, the rear palace rejoices; entering the Throat, the myriad things fail to thrive. Trespassing the Chamber, war erupts and the earth quakes; passing through the Root, the heir apparent rejoices. Dwelling in the Heart, the sagely ruler enjoys virtue; in the Tail, bandits roam openly. Circling the Winnowing Basket, floods scatter the people; entering the Dipper, ascension to the throne faces no contention. Encircling the Ox, treacherous ministers plot against the ruler; trespassing the Woman, the violent and powerful run rampant. Ascending the Void, wind and cold bring dear rice; entering the Rooftop, public corvée brings disaster. Trespassing the House, palaces and halls are extensively renovated; circling the Wall, the arts of Dao flourish. Ascending the Straddler, noblewomen grow powerful and floods surge; dwelling in the Bond, deceitful ministers arise. Trespassing the Stomach, floods, famine, and war bring chaos; trespassing the Pleiades, generals march west. Trespassing the Net, dukes and marquises are deposed; ascending the Chariot, cities fall and people panic. Circling the Three Stars, great ministers are dispatched; entering the Well, scorching droughts and disasters converge. In the Ghost, ministers and aides hatch treacherous schemes; trespassing the Willow, the realm enjoys peace. When the star lingers, all directions are governed; dwelling in the Spread, the five grains never cease. Entering the Chariot-spokes, harvests suffer and war erupts; dwelling in the Wings, the world is purged and cleared. Obscuring the Battle-axe, great ministers are executed; trespassing the Law, chief ministers face the cauldron.

For all who hold office, know the subtle and the minute. Be diligent in upholding the law, revering Heaven’s majesty and blessings, and extending the foundations of state and family.

The Earth Star has an iron body. Wherever it resides, if virtue and governance are not cultivated, that land suffers disaster. If the constellation it occupies is vast and distant, the calamity may last a decade; or it may bring the deaths of feudal lords and the hunger and want of the common people. If the land does not heed the celestial mandate, war and strife shall arise. If the Earth Star’s virtue is not cultivated, floods and droughts shall not be regulated, and insects shall damage the grains and wheat. If blessings are cultivated, one gains office and emolument.

If it reaches one’s natal constellation, great disaster strikes: parents may die, siblings may scatter, one may lose office and rank, old disputes may resurface, and one may become orphaned and alone. To avert its baleful influences, one should recite scriptures inscribed on golden tablets and jade slips, wear black garments, ride a black horse, burn benzoin incense, offer fish and turtle as food, establish a water shrine, and perform meritorious rites—all bring good fortune.

The Western Venus Star, also called the Metal Star, the Long-Lived, or the Radiant One, governs the western barbarians and the Hu people. The Venus Star is the essence of Lesser Yin, the son of the White Emperor, also called the Long-Lived. It governs righteousness. When large and bright, it resembles a general, renowned for executing punishments. When enraged, its rays blaze and it roars in fury; when pleased, its horns retract and it hides its form. Passing Fire brings successive funerals; conjoining Water brings war near and far. Trespassing the Horn, the realm wages war; entering the Throat, water bandits arise together. Dwelling in the Root, generals receive enfeoffment; residing in the Heart, insects and fires run rampant.

When it resides in Room, earthworks drain the state; trespassing Tail, governance falters and people contend. Dwelling in Winnowing Basket brings wind and drought, yet amnesty follows; entering Dipper, calamities remain unresolved. Encircling Ox, earth’s qi dissipates; reaching Girl, treasuries empty entirely. Mounting Danger, generals lay down armor; trespassing Chamber, warriors cease campaigns. Entering Stride, rivers overflow their sources; guarding Wall, the state enforces harsh punishments. Mounting Bond, white-robed assemblies convene; entering Stomach, the inner realm finds peace. Trespassing Mane, Hu armies surge greatly; guarding Net, amnesties accompany military marches. Mounting Turtle, the wilds see political change; passing Well and Ghost, ministers and generals share anxieties. Entering Willow, the primary general gains enfeoffment; lingering in Star, death in battle spreads through encampments. Hook and Wing—feudal lords greatly mobilize troops; entering Imperial Chariot, the sovereign raises sieves and hangs banners. Guarding Heavenly Field, recipients receive ranks and emoluments; at high noon, earthly barbarians run rampant with unchecked ferocity. Losing lodging, evil perishes and armies break; unseen, generals are slain and cities razed. Should mountains collapse on all sides, corvée labor encroaches upon the noble. When the lord is yielding and ministers strong, the blade of war turns in battle. When power is seized by rival factions, omens of disorder repeatedly appear. When ministers’ integrity falters, the lord’s heart turns to perversity.

Alas! Lords who hold land and ministers who serve as pillars of state—let them neither overstep nor exceed, but revere Heaven and stand in awe of the gods. Govern the state through the Dao, and rectify the self through virtue. Then blessings will endure for descendants, and transformation extend to the people.

The Venus Star, the Great General, governs righteousness, punitive expeditions, and warfare. It completes one celestial circuit every eight years; wherever it transits among the lodgings, warfare often follows. When it passes over one’s natal star, one indulges in depravity, music, and licentiousness. The method of averting its influence lies in promoting martial teachings and auspicious banners.

The Northern Chronographic Star, also called the Water Star or *Di*, belongs to the north and governs the lands of Yan and Zhao. The Chronographic Star, also known as the essence of Water, is the son of the Black Emperor, taking the form of a deputy general, and governs hearing. It scrutinizes the sentiments of lord and ministers; wherever it resides, there is anxiety and unease. If the lord examines his laws and decrees, clarifies his teachings, distances slanderers, and embraces the loyal and upright, curbing indulgence and excess, then the state and family will prosper. But if the lord neglects city walls, fails to employ worthy ministers, follows his own whims, and befriends petty men, then Heaven’s portents descend, disasters strike his domain, the five grains fail to ripen, wind and rain fall unseasonably, yin and yang fall into disorder, and famine and cold press upon one another. When it conjoins Metal, weapons stir; when trespassed by Earth, the primary general faces calamity. By observing its rays and horns, one discerns the scale of disasters; by carefully noting its concealments and appearances, one examines the reproaches of lord and ministers. When violent waters rise and its color turns green, great mourning follows. When it appears pale and hollow, this is auspicious. Rising at dawn in spring and setting at dusk in autumn, it fulfills its course. When winter grows warm and summer cold, it encroaches upon Greater Yang and obscures its light, or approaches Lesser Yin and exchanges embraces. Guarding Horn hastens punishments and brings water disasters; lingering in Throat causes grain prices to soar. Residing in Heart, the realm enjoys great peace; guarding Room, treacherous ministers plot. Dwelling in Tail, rivers and seas overflow; entering Winnowing Basket, great men grow anxious. Trespassing Void, the land turns red for a thousand miles; mounting Ox and Cow, a hundred rivers dam and flood. Encroaching upon Girl, cloth and silk double in price; guarding Danger, rebellious ministers rise in succession. Entwining Stride, ministers below are imprisoned; guarding Stomach, warfare and floods bring people sorrow. Circling Net, border armies are swiftly alarmed; residing in Mane, the administration’s punishments run rampant. Hooking Beak brings calamitous warfare; entering Well, water and earth become adversaries. Mounting Turtle and entering Ghost bring water disasters and war, with epidemics and many worries. Lingering in Willow, high ministers incur guilt; guarding Wings, ancestral temples require repair. Encroaching upon the Supreme Palace, ministers harm one another; guarding Imperial Chariot, the empress’s clan harbors many feuds. Entering Wall, the court trembles in fear; trespassing Chamber, lawsuits stall in prison. Residing in Spread, high ministers monopolize the state; trespassing Room, the empress’s faction is seized. Guarding Bond, water ruins all things; in Establishment, the prime minister’s praise is ceaseless.

Only through reverence for Earth, careful observance of ritual, trembling with caution, dwelling in peace yet mindful of peril, and diligently cultivating commanding virtue may one secure blessings and peace.

The Water Star is the pivot of the ministers, governing the Son of Heaven’s secret essentials, the conferral and reception of marquisates and earldoms, and the affairs of the year. It completes one celestial circuit annually; wherever it transits in the field divisions, it often brings water disasters, warfare, ominous rumors, or unsettles people’s hearts, inclining them toward sour and pungent flavors. The method of averting its influence lies in constructing city walls and moats, and digging channels to divert water—then fortune follows.
