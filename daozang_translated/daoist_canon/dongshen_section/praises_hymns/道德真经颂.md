**Ode to the Dao/Way of the *Zhenjing* of *De*
Composed by Jiang Rong’an of Mount Mao.

**Preliminary Ode on the Entire Scripture:**
Within the violet mist, truths flow unbound,
I leisurely play with golden leaves, a child at heart.
If one clings to words and seeks the doctrine’s core,
One wrongs the aged sage of yore.

**Chapter 1:**
Tender and dense beyond all origin,
Stirring dust yet never can be parted.
Today I open one thread for you—
Let all the qi blow through this door.

**Chapter 2:**
The root essence differs not from delusion’s guise,
Yet other teachings twist it endlessly.
When effort comes, muster bold resolve,
For the Dao itself never stains the pure tide.

**Chapter 3:**
Discernment sharp yet applied with grace,
Not letting wealth spoil the child’s pride.
Through winter’s chill and summer’s heat no strife,
The Four Seas rejoice in this holy age.

**Chapter 4:**
Pity the labor over fame and rank,
The bitterest torment the world doth know.
Cast aside, reclaim—no fixed intent,
Lest the land sink beneath the weight you bear.

**Chapter 5:**
One thing, ever luminous and ancient,
Refined in eight facets, all-pervasive.
Seemingly vanished, yet never spent—
When plucked, its use knows no end.

**Chapter 6:**
Heaven and Earth, from the start, are natural,
No contrivance ever marked their frame.
If one gains even a spark of its power,
Sitting alone on a peak, they rule the myriad.

**Chapter 7:**
I, without intent, have no strife,
Beyond kalpas, free in boundless flight.
Since one phrase named me, form and face,
To this day, the truth remains unclear.

**Chapter 8:**
Before Heaven’s birth, the Dao abides,
Eight myriad dusts of toil from its gates.
Seize the root—unmoved, unshaken—
Wherever it stands, it is ever honored.

**Chapter 9:**
With intent, how unlike the Dao’s own?
Its own essence is ever true.
Do not turn nectar into venom,
Only then shall you see the truly wise.

**Chapter 10:**
All conditioned things are suffering’s mark,
Seeking branches and leaves—when shall it cease?
Though one cuts off a thousand paths,
They’ve already fallen into another’s scheme.

**Chapter 11:**
Its marvel lies in its natural flow,
Each moment’s use demands no deviation.
Only fear this truth no one can grasp—
Then call for the ferry at the river’s edge.

**Chapter 12:**
Outside the gate, a myriad winds,
How many wanderers never turn back.
Without the strength to lift the cauldron or shift the mountain,
Who dares to gaze upon the cold path home?

**Chapter 13:**
Honor and insult, no self remains,
Yet self-grasping spawns endless strife.
If one sees self-grasping is not self,
Why cling to another’s fleeting dust?

**Chapter 14:**
Free of all names, yet not true,
Explain it clearly—yet still it flees.
Only in present joys and sorrows’ weight,
Does one know what law can ease the heart.

**Chapter 15:**
The Six Eyes of the inverted mountain defy measure,
In vain one compares its form to mortal speech.
Not a single particle is ever the same—
Each pluck reveals a fresh new face.

**Chapter 16:**
Cold paths alone deserve the whip,
At home, all things return to their nature.
Borrowing the old woman’s robe to worship her,
Still, one must return to her very presence.

**Chapter 17:**
Knowing the Dao too soon brings ill,
How can one bear the world’s sharp blades?
When deeds are done and virtue stands,
To forsake the Sage is to break one’s heart.

**Chapter 18:**
The true hero seeks no medicine for illness,
The fool mistakes the flower for his own gaze.
Better the boundless blue of ten thousand miles,
Than a single moonbeam shared with none.

**Chapter 19:**
Good deeds need not be sought in vain,
Yet turning them brings sorrow again.
Clinging to trifles—what purpose serves?
In the end, one must return to home.

**Chapter 20:**
The great round mirror holds no distinction,
A hundred feet of pole—yet one must turn.
When breath is cut, the path is found,
As ever, the Dao is the original man.

**Chapter 21:**
All sights are revealed without concealment,
Within them, the finest grace is seen.
Through ages clear, yet never dimmed—
Gazing at green hills, autumn comes again.

**Chapter 22:**
Cast aside, reclaim—many ways,
Yet its use lies in the slightest thread.

**Chapter 23:**
Mountains are mountains, waters are waters,
Yet waters are not waters, mountains are not mountains.
Each man has his own path to the heavens—
Yet why do men make things so difficult?

**Chapter 24:**
The footwork must be firm and grounded,
Yet boasting of one’s own shame becomes a demon.
If even the slightest thread is not grasped,
Then gazing upon it already brings excess.

**Chapter 25:**
In the midst of all things, no separation—
Yet the transcendent stands at the pinnacle, like the Emperor’s image.
Seeking fame by force, fame cannot be attained,
Only when the moon sets does one see it never leaves the sky.

**Chapter 26:**
Once the slightest thread is touched, change arises—
The whole roof is a board, not so light.
At the moment, discerning guest from host,
One sits in judgment at the southern gate, declaring peace.

**Chapter 27:**
The marvel lies not in contrivance,
But in its warmth, like a loving heart.
Who understands the teacher’s hidden intent?
Alone before the bound winds, it vexes the mind.

**Chapter 28:**
In smallness, deceit thrives on the pair,
Yet poverty and vexation bring early age—how so?
At the end, one must establish his household,
Yet men are troubled by the world’s endless turns.

**Chapter 29:**
To shape the heart as if returning—
This too must be mistaken.
What fear of the world’s myriad affairs?
One should guard against them in leisure’s embrace.

**Chapter 30:**
Victory through force is but a fleeting condition,
When delight is thick, it’s best to rest.
It’s not the general’s bold heart,
But the thought that even flat ground brings sorrow.

**Chapter 31:**
Poison cures poison, as the saying goes—
Once the sickness is gone, no further need for medicine.
Do not boast that poison can cure the ailment,
For one must consider the time before the fever’s peak.

**Chapter 32:**
The signs precede all names—
Yet within them lies the finest crown.
Without cause, names are specially bestowed,
And the grand procession flows eastward day and night.

**Chapter 33:**
All means are employed with ease,
Yet all is swept away by one law.
Even if black winds overturn the sea,
No tale tells of capsizing the fishing boat.

**Chapter 34:**
Its glory is ever revealed without concealment,
Yet it shines fully where it should.
Born of all things, it is not their master—
Alone, it sits majestic—who can measure it?

**Chapter 35:**
Though its form lacks grandeur or imposing presence,
All who come are encompassed within its embrace.
The six uses cannot deplete its flow,
Each moment’s application knows no end.

**Chapter 36:**
Its workings are profound and far-reaching—
Truly difficult to fathom.
Its transformations vast and boundless—
No logic can encompass them.
Do not bring your judgments to it,
For in the end, it will not align with you.

**Chapter 37:**
The Dao stands idle, yet encompasses all wonders,
All phenomena are clearly divided within it.
Beyond ten thousand miles, the dust settles—
Endless days of quiet, rejoicing in the peace.

**Chapter 38:**
In the great round mirror, no distinctions exist,
Yet distinctions of beauty and ugliness harm not the mirror.
Pity those who follow as examples,
For they shorten the path and stretch the measure.

**Chapter 39:**
The marvel lies not in multiplicity,
For excess only breeds confusion and error.
Even if distinctions of right and wrong are set aside,
Jade and stone remain as they always were.

**Chapter 40:**
At the cliff’s edge, one must turn back,
For effort lies not in strength, but in restraint.
The world is ever in tumult—
Yet who knows what we toil for all day?

**Chapter 41:**
True gold has its own true worth,
Other treasures must be returned to their owner.
At the end, no need to break it with weighty words,
Yet to this day, none truly understands the connoisseur.

**Chapter 42:**
One must overturn the brambles’ nest,
Yet avoid entangling oneself in nets.
Only when they rest must we wait,
For many are misled by many misleaders.

**Chapter 43:**
The crimson flame burns like fire in men,
Yet a stone man in fire cannot smoke.
Between them, little good remains,
Yet one buys the wind’s light without cost.

**Chapter 44:**
Light and heavy have their constant measure—
At the time, avoid miscalculating.
Do not treat good things as strange or rare,
For good things turn the heart to sorrow.

**Chapter 45:**
Clear discernment brings true use,
Within it, distinctions of shallow and deep.
Twofold judgment without reliance,
After rain, a thousand peaks remain green.

**Chapter 46:**
When the world is in turmoil, I am in turmoil,
Yet when I am at ease, the world is at ease.
Brightly recognizing the idle law,
A single laugh makes heaven and earth vast.

**Chapter 47:**
Its wind arises where it should not leave,
Yet the slightest movement brings it no clarity.
Sitting and watching the trifling guests outside,
How many chariots and horses pass at will?

**Chapter 48:**
For the Dao, do not mistake it for study,
Beyond ten thousand miles, the skulls lie dry.
Majestic, it sits in judgment over the land of no birth,
And gazes further toward the shores of no birth.

**Chapter 49:**
The Dao is level, yet no faction tilts it,
Wherever spring flowers bloom, they are fresh and fair.
The fool sits opposite, unable to speak of dreams,
So he ties the crane’s glue to mend the broken string.

**Chapter 50:**
The belly is split, the entrails spilled—
All is revealed, no need for further doubt.
When doubt arises, the path to clarity is found,
Yet men are forbidden from peering with their eyes.

**Chapter 51:**
Without stirring a hair, all things respond,
Yet who knows gratitude after it is given?
When affairs are met without attachment,
One asks: *What was the original heart?*

**Chapter 52:**
From the thread’s beginning, the root of life is pondered,
Yet knowing its source is still not enough.
Even sealed like water, it is not yet the full measure—
Only at home does one truly grasp its advantage.

**Chapter 53:**
The Dao lies within, yet is hard to know,
The distant path is clear, yet foes cannot cross it.
The fool does not understand establishing his household,
Chasing youthful splendor ever outward.

**Chapter 54:**
The effort is steady where no wind passes,
Thick and endless, yet never exhausted.
What is this? The hair’s end contains the Dharma-realm,
All green recognizes its master.

**Chapter 55:**
All day, the child plays freely,
Yet the body remains still, unaware.
Once touched by contrivance, it becomes artificial—
Returning it, the leaves fall, and the branches sprout anew.

**Chapter 56:**
Seated firm at the fortress gate, one thread connects—
Naturally, wherever one goes, grace flows unbound.
Morning rain washes a thousand peaks to emerald,
A lone seagull skims the waves, its flight so light.

**Chapter 57:**
Within all dharmas, constancy abides unseen,
Yet stir a speck of dust, and all is undone.
Autumn winds scatter rain in vain—
No malice in the cold, yet all grow chilled.

**Chapter 58:**
Neither wise nor foolish, yet boundless in intent,
Clouds shift, rain falls—how many times?
Few grasp this fleeting thought,
Alone in borrowed robes, he turns to go.

**Chapter 59:**
Cold, unadorned effort—truly plain and true,
At home, its work defies all measure.
When virtue is complete and practice fulfilled,
Across kalpas and lives, its fragrance lingers.

**Chapter 60:**
A thought or impulse brings lack and want,
Yet with candle held, all doubt is cut.
Heaven and earth stretch wide in perfect peace—
This grace must be known by all alike.

**Chapter 61:**
When trees fall and mountains stand bare in autumn’s wealth,
Yin and yang’s craft demands deep pursuit.
But hide the water of *kan*, suppress the fire of *li*,
And spirit soars to crown the land.

**Chapter 62:**
One bright point, round and clear, is everywhere the same—
High or low, rich or poor, none compare to this.
What’s gained is borrowed, lacking from the start,
Even sages bow before its might.

**Chapter 63:**
The Dao in emptiness—early or late, it fails not,
No need for schemes when effort is complete.
Do not think this easy—here, even needles clash.

**Chapter 64:**
Cut off the paths of a thousand contrivances first,
For every move of the iron brush brings harm.
Pity those who lack patience for others’ affairs,
Their idle worries twist the heart.

**Chapter 65:**
Awake to the Dao, yet not like the foolish—
Awake to schemes, yet more entangled still.
If one knows this true foundation,
Mystery’s play is beyond all knowing.

**Chapter 66:**
All streams converge where the great river flows,
Because his home’s message reaches far.
To force the heartless into intent,
Stirs chaos—spring’s flowers scatter in vain.

**Chapter 67:**
Strike at the core, and heaven and earth shift—
Even Wang Wei’s brush could not capture this.
Too bad the muddy path is left undisturbed,
Few dare tread where the depths lie hidden.

**Chapter 68:**
Understanding the family’s wind, it serves with ease,
Know that water shapes itself as it flows.
This truth is boundless—how to measure it?
Tides recede, yet the moon rises anew.

**Chapter 69:**
Like a general with fortified walls, bending foes,
No harm done, yet peace is won.
When all is done and nothing remains,
The hall of old is still born anew.

**Chapter 70:**
This question is clear, yet none dare answer truly—
Why do people shrink from what’s plain?
If all could see this, they’d scorn a single bowl of soup.

**Chapter 71:**
Gained or lost, it’s the same as before,
Yet not a hair’s breadth escapes its reach.
Before the body leaves the critical stage,
A thousand wounds—what cure could there be?

**Chapter 72:**
Born bold in spirit, unbounded in mind,
Vastness itself is no constraint.
Who could gather this as he has done?
On coral branches, the sunbird dances.

**Chapter 73:**
To kill or spare at the decisive moment—how profound!
Light or heavy, only the master knows.
Let me speak plainly to you now,
For winter’s chill pierces bone and marrow.

**Chapter 74:**
Fear the law, yet know those who grasp it well—
From first to last, the law knows no kin.
To see where law’s impartiality lies,
Observe the moon’s reflection—no trace remains.

**Chapter 75:**
In this peaceful world, no deceit remains,
Yet the master’s helplessness is the key.
Only in action does the original goodness show—
Barefoot, he laughs, his toes dangling free.

**Chapter 76:**
This origin is no different in kind,
Yet who would forcefully divide strong and weak?
Once life and death are split asunder,
No scales could weigh the worth of a grain.

**Chapter 77:**
Heaven and man differ by not a hair’s breadth,
Yet stray a hair’s breadth, and all is undone.
Fearful of night’s advance, they rise too soon—
Who knows they’ll only catch the dew on their clothes?

**Chapter 78:**
Facing each other, no words are false,
Yet why does no one truly understand?
Here, deep meaning is offered plainly—
The sun rises in the east, yet sets in the west.

**Chapter 79:**
To see through clearly is no wrong,
Yet to recognize, one must first reach the source.
When the source is known in truth,
The Way of Heaven stands without deviation.

**Chapter 80:**
Rich or poor, the family’s ease is sure,
Within all dharmas, all is green and bright.
Eating, dressing—no greater task,
All share the wind and moon as one with Heaven.

**Chapter 81:**
Choose the law with eyes wide open,
For truth’s use lies beyond dust and root.
At the end, a turn without private intent—
No separation from this very place, this master.

*The Ode to the Classic of the Way and Its Virtue concludes.*
