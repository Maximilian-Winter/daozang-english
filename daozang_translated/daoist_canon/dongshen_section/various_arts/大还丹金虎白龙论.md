**The Great Return Elixir: On the Golden Tiger and White Dragon**
*Composed by the Recluse of Mount Sumen, Master Huanyang*

To refine the elixir and concoct the medicine, one must stew the yin and yang of the dragon and tiger;
To preserve life and sustain form, one relies on nurturing the spirit-qi’s hun and po.

When the dragon congeals and the tiger thickens, yin reverses to become yang;
When the tiger dims and the dragon glows, yang transforms into treasure.
When spirit fuses and qi is mastered, po reverts to hun;
When qi flourishes and spirit harmonizes, hun unites to become sacred.

Dragon and tiger mutually congeal into liquid; spirit and qi intermingle to become the true.
The divine water is none other than the Flowery Pond; forgetting the heart is called embracing the One.
To ascend heaven riding a crane, one must swallow the numinous elixir of the true po;
To transcend the world and attain longevity, one relies on nurturing the essence-hun’s numen.

By this means, the secret of the golden elixir and the wondrous gate of immortality
can alter the spirit, transform the sinews and bones,
withdraw and enfold the body, so that one may enter and exit as if existing or not,
manifest the true numen, coming and going while able to abide or vanish.
Fields of mulberry shift and change; heaven and earth overturn in emptiness.
One ascends to the Purple Court, roaming the Jade Clarity through the azure heavens and golden palaces.

This is the verification of the divine elixir, the efficacy of return and reversion.
Yet世人 vainly smelt the five metals, blend the eight minerals,
call lead the tiger, name mercury the dragon,
recklessly pair yin and yang, misalign water and fire.
They boast of the Three Yellows as sacred, gallop the Five Alums as divine,
deviating from the Dao, losing all sagely intent.
Studying scriptures and probing meanings, seeking origins and delving into mysteries,
they chaotically establish rules, passing down methods in succession.
Without receiving transmission from a master, they forcefully claim their own ability,
measuring drug names, calculating fire times,
furnaces plastered on eight sides, altars built in three tiers,
invoking deities, offering sacrifices to heaven and earth—
all is groundless fabrication, not principled cultivation.
Unawares, the body decays and form withers, the complexion fades and temples whiten.
Wasting years in vain toil, squandering the heart’s spirit,
they yet hope for the returning elixir—ten thousand times, not one succeeds.

I have long indulged in cloud and water, early abandoning worldly vanities,
dwelling in mountains and forests, exhaustively investigating the phenomena of things.
Cultivating spirit and refining qi, returning to the root and reverting to the origin,
calming thoughts and clarifying the true, forgetting thoughts and stilling the One,
I examined the orifices of lead and mercury, wove the warp and weft of elixir scriptures,
penetrated the golden writings of the Mysterious Cavern,
and awakened to the jade formulas of the Three Clarities.
Thus, I dared to grasp the dragon and tiger, master yin and yang,
pair metal and wood to bind east and west, fix Kan and Li to north and south,
smelt and refine sun and moon, tempering the five-colored mysterious frost,
gestate and nurture heaven and earth, transforming the flowing light of pristine snow.
The immortal method is not false; the sagely principle is manifestly clear.
Having glimpsed the subtle mystery and understood its wondrous purport,
I therefore composed this preface, dividing it into two chapters,
entitled *On the Golden Tiger and White Dragon*,
to display my humble insights and share them with like-minded seekers.
Should there be gentlemen beyond the mundane, may they kindly attend to this!

**Chapter One: Identifying the Yellow Sprout**

The Yellow Sprout arises from the union of Qian and Kun, formed by the workings of creation.
Yang embraces the yin-po; yin cradles the yang-hun.
Yang’s numen shines with blood’s radiant clarity; yin’s truth gleams with jade’s luminous transparency.
Compared to the moon, its pristine light vies in brilliance;
facing the sun, rosy clouds scatter in profusion.
Its whole body heals the mane; its entire form bristles with scales.
It grows in the yang position, secretly intimate with yin.
It presides over the five metals, rules the eight minerals as sovereign.
Those who understand it swiftly soar to the empyrean;
those who ignore it remain long in the dust of the world.
Used daily yet unknown to people, they rush about until their hair turns white without achievement.

*Qian and Kun unite to first form its shape,*
*Creation’s origin dwells in the northern chamber’s birth.*
*Sun and moon cycle, hun and po fill;*
*Yin and yang copulate, dragon and tiger take form.*
*Clearly it grows from metal—*
*Who realizes it can also merge with water?*
*Countless are those confined within the dust of the world,*
*Daily using it yet unaware of its name.*

**Chapter Two: Identifying Lead and Mercury**

In cultivating the great medicine, first clarify the true source of lead and mercury;
In compounding the divine elixir, one must grasp the correct principle of Kan and Li.

Lead encloses yin marrow and is called the tiger, occupying the Kan position;
Mercury arises from yang essence and is named the dragon, residing in the Li position.
Moon and sun meet, serving as the ladder and mediator of coming and going;
Li maiden and Kan youth are the warp and weft of reunion and return.
Lead receives the pungent and nurtures, thus clad in coarse cloth yet harboring gold;
Mercury bears the wood-born, naturally adorned in splendor yet containing wood.
Lead is not common tin; mercury is not ordinary silver.
Lead is the root and foundation of heaven and earth; mercury is the numinous qi of yin and yang.
Lead contains the sun’s po; mercury drinks the moon’s hun.
Lead is true lead; mercury is no common mercury.
Drawing the marrow from the five phases, they bind to form gold;
Combining the essence of the two images, they clarify and congeal into liquid.

When the sun wanes and the moon waxes, hun sinks and yin-hun perishes;
When the moon wanes and the sun waxes, hun dissipates and yang-po ends.
Yin and yang unite, pairing as the husband and wife of dragon and tiger;
Water and fire reverse their intercourse, forging the elixir of Qian and Kun.
Yang can restrain po, circulating to naturally form a golden body;
Yin has become yang, reversing to begin the divine substance.
When yin and yang are full, one obtains the cinnabar of transcendence;
When the numbers of water and fire are complete, one attains the liquid of cloud-soaring.
On the red-frosted tripod, morning clouds exhale in dazzling brilliance;
Within the white-powdered furnace, auspicious snow sprays in glowing radiance.
Blood-red clarity—dawn’s sun rises over Fusang;
Ice-like splendor—autumn’s moon immerses in the cold shore.
A lone crane perches on the fragrant osmanthus of a clear peak;
A rainbow arcs across the bright river, clustering the emerald beauty of lotuses.
At the moment of grinding, fragrant aromas scatter;
Upon pulverizing, luminous brilliance flows through.
Refined into treasure, ingested to ascend heaven—
a single dose instantly enables soaring flight, feathered transformation to roam the Phoenix Tower.

Worldly affairs rush endlessly, without conclusion;
A hundred years pass like a fleeting dream’s glory.
Not knowing there are cloud-path travelers,
they merely vie for fame in the dust of the world.

Seeking to halt the fleeting years and drift upon the Great Clarity,
know that the numinous elixir alone ensures everlasting life.
Refine purely the marrow of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang,
forge wholly the essence of Qian and Kun’s sun and moon.

Marriage of yin and yang forms the union,
as dragon and tiger mutually consume each other.
Subduing the Crimson Emperor’s essence from the Li Palace,
one draws the White Dragon’s fluid from the Kan Gate.

The Yellow Sprout is rooted in this very source—
all else is vain toil, wasted effort.
If one has not met a true perfected being,
how can one attain the profound and mysterious art?

The firing must complete nine revolutions,
the elixir’s completion awaits a full thousand days.
Above the furnace, smoke rises in five-colored radiance;
within the crucible, the medicine stirs as the Vast Red Lord.

A single grain of the knife’s measure soars to the celestial Han,
freely treading the Three Clarities in an instant.
Riding cranes and mounting dragons, commanding ghosts and spirits,
one laughs in return at the mulberry fields’ many transformations.

Henceforth dwelling forever in the Azure Vault Palace,
eternally feasting with the immortals in the Golden Hall.
Sun’s brilliance and moon’s essence,
Wu and Ji serve as the sovereign.

Metal and wood, east and west conjoined,
yin and yang, above and below divided.
Storage and addition follow in sequence,
advance and retreat accord with ancient texts.
After ten months, the gestation is complete—
lightly, lightly one drifts upon white clouds.

Seeking the master, together we aspire to endure for ten thousand ages in the cinnabar clouds;
the heart’s resolve beyond the dust has long been our earnest discourse.
Now, do not weary of frequent visits—
already it seems a solitary cloud-crane has arrived at the gate.

The master exhorts:
Early, amidst busyness, recognize what is leisure;
do not expend heart and strength in the service of schemes.
Flowers, by their season, may bloom again,
but water, once eastward gone, never returns.

Spring’s hues stealthily steal the black from temples,
the wind’s splendor silently exchanges youth for age.
Know that worldly affairs are ever lamentable—
all lies within Zhuang Zhou’s single dream.

The master bestows:
I now reveal each true gate of the mystery;
all ancient sages emerged thereby.
Yesterday, within the Penglai immortal assembly,
the register of long life has gained yet another name.

The master instructs and sees him off:
The pine stands firm and steadfast,
the ravine’s waters flow clear again.
Do not linger long in the world of dust,
where right and wrong sully the ear’s hearing.

In the mid-decade of winter’s beginning, the second year of the Shiguang era, there was the Seventh Transverse Peak Master, Yongyangzi Du Xidun, styled Wangji. In an autumn of many affairs, he evaded calamity in the outskirts of Wen, and whenever he reached Yan, he only met with great recluses. Among them was the Duke of Nanyang, who deeply revered the Dao, immersed in profound mysteries, and nurtured his heart in tranquil elegance. As for making one’s mark and spreading fame, he awaited only a true confidant.

In friendship, there is that which seeks fame, and that which seeks profit—
my bond with the Duke is neither for fame nor gain.
With each meeting, we spoke of the Dao from dawn till dusk;
beyond the mystery upon mystery of the profound, I had nothing to say.
Thus, I inscribe the alchemical formulas of my late master and present them to you.
I earnestly hope you will treasure them a thousandfold, ten thousandfold—
do not transmit them to the unworthy.

How could matters beyond the mundane be made known to ordinary men?
If ordinary men knew of them, they would only bring upon themselves condemnation.

The Immortal Master said: Those who reverently receive these teachings shall have their names recorded in the Registers of the Mysterious; those who leak or treat them with negligence shall be punished, their souls condemned to become lowly ghosts.

He further said: Misfortune or blessing extends to nine generations; ascent or descent rests within this single form.

Now, I swear by the green mountains and white clouds—do not betray these words, a thousandfold, ten thousandfold!

Here ends the *Discourse on the Great Return Elixir, the Golden Tiger, and the White Dragon*.
