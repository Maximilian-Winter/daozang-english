**The Palm-Record of Mysterious Frost**

Mysterious Frost is also called by six other names: Maiden’s Mysterious Frost, Jade Nectar, Milk of the Earth Mother, Sweet Dew Nectar, Nine-Turned Yin Elixir, and Fermented Butter. Though immortals of old consumed the Golden Elixir, none failed to cultivate this Yin Elixir.

Consider black lead, which belongs to Water and bears the number one. From one comes two, from two comes three, and from three all things are born—how could this not arise from the interplay of Yin and Yang? The Great Elixir is the Dragon and Tiger of Yin and Yang, born as such in their primal state. Yet once refined, it is called True Yang, and thus becomes solitary Yang. Since solitary Yang cannot sustain itself, it must rely on the Yin Elixir to bear it upward, serving as a bridge to transcendence. Its quantity follows the numerical pattern of Yin and Yang, employing nine.

As for its effects—moistening the five viscera, irrigating the Flowery Canopy, replenishing the Mud Pill above, and restoring the radiance of essence below—without Mysterious Frost, even the greatest medicine will yield scant results after prolonged use. The Great Elixir emerges from the *Canon of Unity*, while the Primordial Yin Mysterious Frost originates from the *Secret Record*, which is why adepts rarely comprehend it.

Herein is set forth the method for refining the Yin Elixir, White Snow Mysterious Frost:

Take two *jin* of the finest raw black lead and half a *jin* of mercury. First, melt the lead in a crucible until it is free of impurities. Then add the mercury and stir thoroughly until it forms globules the size of jujubes. Prepare a porcelain jar, its exterior coated with oil, and pour five *sheng* of fine vinegar into it. Conduct the work in a secluded chamber facing the sun, commencing at the height of Yang to align with the Dao’s qi.

Bury the jar in a pit so its mouth is level with the ground. Place the lead crucible over the jar’s opening, cover it with three or four layers of paper, and seal it with a porcelain bowl. At the peak of Yang, remove it once every seven days. The globules will hang like inverted snow. Expose them to the wind until they harden, then scrape them off. If the vinegar in the jar diminishes, replenish it. Repeat this process until you obtain one *jin* of frost.

Next, place the frost in a porcelain mortar, add sweet rice water, and grind it with a willow-wood pestle until it resembles a fine paste. Transfer it to a bowl and steam it in a rice steamer. After steaming, grind it again, rinse with clear water, and let it settle. Repeat the grinding, rinsing, and steaming process: five times in the rice steamer and four times in a steamer lined with earth. When steaming in the earth-lined steamer, cover the bowl with another bowl. After nine full cycles, strain the mixture through a silk bag into a silver vessel filled with clean water. Let it rest for a day and night, then moisten a piece of silk and cover the vessel’s mouth. Dry it in the sun, scrape off the frost, and grind it again with the willow-wood pestle.

The resulting substance will be as white as spring snow, as fine as flour, with a sweet, subtle, and refreshing taste. When placed in the mouth, it melts like spring ice. Those who refine it should form it into pills the size of *wutong* seeds with honey. Take five pills daily, and after a year, no illness will afflict you, and you will not thirst even in summer. To wash the hair, mix it with raw oil and apply it to the crown; soon, a cooling sensation will reach the soles of the feet—its divine efficacy is beyond description. When used to guide the Great Elixir in reversing aging, it is the circulation of vital fluids that restores youth.

**Song by Master Sun:**
*Mysterious White Frost, Mysterious White Frost,*
*Dragon and Tiger stand as sovereigns within.*
*If all things do not arise from Yin,*
*Then where does solitary Yang find its nurture?*
