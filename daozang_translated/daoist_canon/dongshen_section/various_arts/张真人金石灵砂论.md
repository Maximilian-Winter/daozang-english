### *The Venerable Master Zhang’s Treatise on Alchemical Minerals and Cinnabar*
**By Zhang Yinju of Mengshan**

#### **The Yellow Gold Chapter**
Yellow gold is the essence of the sun and serves as the sovereign. Ingesting it enables communion with spirits, lightens the body, benefits the five viscera, expels pathogenic qi, and slays demonic influences. Prolonged consumption turns the skin golden.

Gold forms within mountain stones, accumulating the qi of the great yang, refined by steaming until its nature is fixed. It is intensely hot and highly toxic, such that stones several feet around it are transformed into a golden hue—how much more so for those who refine and ingest it?

Gold that grows near its source is called *Golden Bloom*; that which follows is *Golden Splendor*; that which grows farther is *Golden Bandit*; and that which emerges a hundred paces away is *Golden Sprout*. If this gold is ground into powder and consumed, it will corrode the bones and marrow, causing withering and death.

Yellow gold is the true qi of the great yang, the soul of the sun, symbolizing the three hun-souls. White mercury is the true qi of the great yin, the spirit of the moon, symbolizing the seven po-souls. Consuming them together confers immortality.

Yellow gold corresponds to the west, the metal of *geng* and *xin*; white mercury corresponds to the north, the water of *ren* and *gui*. Water is the child of metal.

The ancients said: *"To consume gold is to become like gold; to consume jade is to become like jade."* Gold’s nature is unyielding—boiling does not soften it, burial does not rot it, burning does not char it—thus it can sustain life. When medicinal gold is ingested, the flesh does not decay, the hair does not wither, yin and yang remain unaltered, and ghosts and spirits cannot invade; hence, longevity is boundless.

The finest golds include *Old Sage’s Meteor Gold*, *Yellow Emperor’s Cauldron Gold*, *Master Ma’s Crimson Gold*, *Lord Yin’s Horseshoe Gold*, *Fox Venerable’s River Chariot Gold*, *Master Anqi’s Vermilion Gold*, *Master Jinlou’s Returned Elixir Gold*, *Liu An’s Horseshoe Gold*, *Lord Mao’s Purple Lead Gold*, *Eastern Garden Elder’s Upper Field Azure Dragon Gold*, *Li Shaojun’s Smelted Mud Gold*, *Fan Li’s Purple Elixir Gold*, and *Master Xu’s Transmuted Gold*—all divine alchemical transformations rivaling the great work of creation, embodying the mysteries of the Dao and the marvels of the yellow and white. They must not be used lightly, lest one incur divine censure.

Gold that forms in mountains, rivers, and streams is of inferior grade.

#### **The White Gold Formula**
Silver is white gold, the essence of lesser yang born of yin, serving as the minister. Ingesting it enables communion with spirits and confers deathlessness, strengthens the sinews and bones, and is mildly hot with slight toxicity. It is produced within lead.

Its position corresponds to the west, the essence of Venus. *The Dragon-Tiger Classic* states: *"The lofty maiden is the sun; the abyssal youth is the moon."* The Lord of the Nine Heavens says: *"The water of the south, the fire of the north—yin dwells within yang, yang within yin. Their movements follow principle, now floating, now sinking. As husband and wife, their intentions are as one. When the year ends, their natures dissolve, and they share the same pillow and mat."*

This is the position of *zi* and *wu*, where the dragon and tiger reside. It must not be consumed alone. *The Dragon-Tiger Classic* says: *"The White Tiger is the pivot; the Azure Dragon accompanies it. Yellow gold is the sovereign, white silver the minister, malachite the messenger, and realgar the general."* When refined together, they form the golden elixir.

The scriptures say: *"When the golden elixir enters the five viscera, its mist scatters like wind and rain. Steaming through the four limbs, it reverses aging and restores youth."* It is also said: *"Jade liquid blackens the hair; golden elixir preserves the complexion."* When white gold is transmuted into yellow or red gold, this is the great principle of the returned elixir.

#### **The Black Lead Chapter**
Lead is black, a metal and water, belonging to the north. Its completion number is one, and it serves as the minister. Ingesting it enables communion with spirits, treats the three barriers, blackens the beard and hair, restores youthful complexion, regulates the blood vessels, heals sores and paralysis, kills the nine worms, and benefits the five viscera—yet it is born of yang.

White silver is its mother. Its nature is slightly cold and toxic; it can be made into *yellow lead*, *lead powder*, *white lead*, and *litharge*.

*The Scripture of the Nine Capitals* states: *"In refining the Nine Radiance Divine Elixir, lead is drawn out, undergoing a thousand transformations without losing its constant nature—only lead and mercury are thus."*

*The Dragon-Tiger Classic* says: *"Nine returns, seven reversions, eight reunions, six residences—male white, female red, gold and fire together."* The male white is lead. Extracting the essence of lead nine times mirrors the nine blacks, for nine is the extreme of yang numbers. The female red is mercury. The seven reversions mirror the seven blacks, for seven is the extreme of yin numbers. Refining the essence of lead and combining it into medicinal gold yields a deep yellow hue; ingesting it confers deathlessness.

#### **The Realgar Chapter**
Realgar serves as the sovereign. Ingesting it enables communion with spirits. That which grows facing the sun is called *male realgar*; that which grows in shadow is called *female realgar*. Born as one body, they intermingle within mountain stones.

It is intensely hot and toxic, the essence of lesser yang. When used in elixirs, it supplements the mud pill, solidifies the brain chamber, and nourishes the three palaces. Taking two ounces each of male and female realgar, mixing with one catty of mercury and four ounces of lead essence, and subduing with fire yields gold. When liquefied and ingested, it enables ascension to heaven.

*The Dragon-Tiger Classic* states: *"That from Wudu is finest; other stones are unusable."* Only realgar can repel all evil influences, hence its name, *the General*.

#### **The Cinnabar Chapter**
There are *Radiant Cinnabar* and *Purple Cinnabar*. Many sages of old consumed them, yet none attained transcendence or longevity. I clarify the principle here.

When *Radiant Cinnabar* and *Purple Cinnabar* are ingested with fire, they expel pathogenic qi and treat febrile diseases, but they cannot restore youthful complexion or blacken the hair. Why? From one catty of *Radiant Cinnabar*, sublimation yields twelve ounces of mercury, and firing yields one pinch of black ash. This black ash is the original substance of cinnabar, which, when placed in the furnace, releases its essence as mercury. Ingesting it prolongs life.

Black ash cannot be taken as an elixir to achieve transcendence. Thus, those who ingest *Radiant Cinnabar* or *Purple Cinnabar* without proper refinement and firing retain its residual ash, which is why they fail to attain longevity.

In ancient times, Lord Lao served as the Archivist of Zhou. Foreseeing the dynasty’s decline, he journeyed west to cross the pass, fearing the Way of the Golden Elixir would be lost. He entrusted the method of cinnabar to Yin Xi. Later generations, however, distorted the teachings, producing what they called *Spiritual Cinnabar*—also named *Radiant Cinnabar*—and compounding it for ingestion. Only then could one transcend mortality, avoid death, and transmute base metals into gold. It is also called *Medicinal Cinnabar*, *Cinnabar*, *Spiritual Cinnabar*, or *Returned Elixir*.

If one consumes *Radiant Cinnabar* or *Purple Cinnabar* alone, without proper compounding or method, the pursuit of immortality strays ever farther from the Dao. The *Spiritual Cinnabar* of nine transformations is not passed from father to son; it naturally transmutes into yellow and white. Why, then, does ingesting *Radiant Cinnabar* or *Purple Cinnabar* fail to grant transcendence?

The *Returned Elixir* gathers the essence of yin and yang, emulating the creative power of Heaven and Earth. Water and fire harmonize, transforming the insubstantial into substance to form its body. How can mere cinnabar and mercury—embodying only yin, lacking yang’s generative pairing—unite the Four Symbols or circulate the Five Phases? Solitary yin cannot nurture, and solitary yang cannot generate. Only when yin and yang unite is the *Returned Elixir* achieved.

For over twenty years since the Kaiyuan era, I have devoted myself to the golden crucible, gaining some insight into its mysteries. I have witnessed how people consume these two cinnabars, mistaking them for the *Seven-Returned Spiritual Elixir*, only to meet untimely deaths.

#### **The True Mercury Chapter**
Mercury is the essence of the moon, born of yang, and serves as minister. Ingesting it lightens the body to avoid death, repels spectral influences, connects with divine clarity, slays the Three Corpses, purifies the Five Viscera, expels the Nine Worms, and severs pathogenic qi—yet it originates from cinnabar.

Cinnabar belongs to the southern fire, and fire, as wood’s child, gives birth to mercury. Mercury is the grandson of the Azure Dragon and the mother of water. Its nature is cold, with slight toxicity, and it arises from earth and stone as the soul and spirit of cinnabar. It is averse to red ochre and the nine leads, and fears elm and licorice. If women consume it raw, it harms the fetus; if men do so, it depletes yang.

The *Classic of the Dragon and Tiger* states: *"Cinnabar is the essence of wood; only when united with metal does it coalesce."* The Perfected One said: *"Not prizing yellow and white, but valuing the Returned Elixir."* Thus, to transcend mortality and avoid death, one must begin with mercury, compounding and refining it with yellow and white to sublimate and subdue it into an elixir. The transformations of divine immortals all rely on cinnabar and mercury, enriched by the Three Metals and harmonized with the Four Stones.

The *Secret Transmission* states: *"Mercury generates the myriad things; only the sage comprehends it."* The virtue of water is most revered. Mercury, as water’s mother, becomes mist and dew in the heavens and springs upon the earth. It adapts to all shapes without contending with things, skillfully governing the myriad forms and giving life to all beings.

Water’s nature is supremely still, never vying with other things. Thus, mercury is another name for liquid silver. It is also called *Luminous Pearl of the Great Yang*, *Eldest Son*, *Riverbank’s Marvelous Maiden*, or *Flying Light Powder* when refined, and is used as *Matured Pearl*.

#### **The Orpiment Chapter**
Orpiment arises among mountain stones. Ingesting it connects with the divine. It is the essence of lesser yang, intensely hot, and highly toxic. People refine it into pills to treat cold diseases, but its effects are fierce, and it must not be taken with hot foods. If one consumes one or two pills, frost-like qi emerges, causing facial swelling and bodily weakness. The common folk, unaware, mistake it for an elixir—this is a grave error. It is also called *Frost* due to its white color and is used in the art of transmuting yellow and white.

#### **The Gold-Forming Chapter**
One catty of mercury, eight ounces of *White Tiger*, and eight ounces of *Male-Female White Snow*, fired for sixty days, form an elixir. Ingesting it ensures immortality, and this gold can be liquified. Consuming it turns the body golden. Stored in a jar buried underground for two hundred days, then warmed with fire for a hundred days, it becomes a liquid. Ingesting it ascends one to the Great Clarity.

Master Yin states: *"The Golden Liquid and Returned Elixir give rise to feathered robes; their thousand transformations and myriad changes are without limit."* The Dao is the interplay of one yin and one yang. The sage models yin and yang, seizing the power of creation.

Thus, yang medicines number seven: two metals and five stones—gold, silver, male and female [mercury], orpiment, azurite, and sulfur—all belong to yang medicines. Yin medicines also number seven: three metals and four stones—mercury, black lead, saltpeter, and mirabilite—all belong to yin medicines. Each yin and yang medicine embodies its nature, and ingesting them holds the promise of transcendence and the principle of immortality.

#### **The Purple Powder Chapter**
Mercury and sulfur, burned into the *Lesser Returned Elixir* and subdued by fire, are called *Purple Powder of the Lesser Returned Elixir*. Ingesting it relieves deficiency heat and suppresses fright and itching. It cannot grant transcendence or transmute metals.

When mercury and orpiment are burned, they vanish—hence, they are called *nonbeing*. Gold and silver, when burned, retain their substance—hence, they are called *being*. This is like the human body’s three hun souls and seven po souls: the divine luminosity comes and goes unseen, but when manifested in the five qi, bodily form, and nine orifices, it is called *being*. Thus, being and nonbeing give rise to one another and are established within the body.

The *True Classic* states: *"Sounds harmonize, things resonate, being and nonbeing interweave, yin and yang embrace—and the Dao resides therein."* Thus, yellow gold becomes red gold, and red gold becomes purple powder. When yin and yang harmonize and the two qi generate one another, the Golden Elixir is achieved.

The Golden Elixir governs nonbeing to restrain being and uses nonbeing to generate being. The *Secret Transmission* states: *"Two nonbeings are the origin of one being; the numinous transformation is wondrous and difficult to fathom."*

This is the meaning of it.

**Explaining the Returned Elixir**

To speak of the Returned Elixir: cinnabar generates mercury, and mercury reverts to cinnabar; cinnabar in turn produces mercury. It is also said that white gold and yellow stone combine to form gold, and when this gold turns crimson, it returns to the likeness of true gold—hence the name *Returned Elixir*. The *Scripture of the Dragon and Tiger* states: *"When gold returns to its original state, it may then be called the Returned Elixir."* Mercury, evenly blended with metal and stone, forms crimson gold—this is the proper name for the Returned Elixir. Transformed from yellow gold into purple gold, it is called the *Purple Gold Returned Elixir*, and therein the Dao is complete. When stone and mercury flow into one another, producing gold of a true crimson hue, it is also named the *Golden Liquid Returned Elixir*. There are also scattered fragments, refined and called *Golden Elixir*; ground into powder, they are named *Gold Powder*. The scripture says: *"When gold powder is cast in, yellow and white may be sought."*

Yet世 people, not understanding the principle of the Returned Elixir, some claim that a single grain can transmute ten pounds, or that one *zhū* can transform into a hundred *liǎng*—exaggerating quantities without grasping the essence, spreading false methods, and propping up deceit with flattery. They disparage the subtle Way of Yellow and White, expounding grandly on the Great Elixir, swaying intentions with dazzling words, and deluding the unwary with fragile, baseless claims. Pointing to emptiness as substance, they turn falsehood into truth, abandoning the true lineage of Yellow and White, unaware of how the Great Elixir could ever arise.

An ancient appraisal states: *"If yellow gold is achieved, the world may be delivered. If yellow gold is not achieved, one only misleads oneself."* This Yellow and White is the marrow of the Returned Elixir, the true origin of the Great Medicine. Without understanding Yellow and White, one labors in vain. Some gather wealth to undertake the work, following the text but misjudging the timing, uncertain in measurements—such errors lead to failure. Thus, the sages kept it secret, unable to speak plainly, often resorting to veiled language. From this, false and contradictory methods arose, with practitioners mocking one another, neglecting the true principle and letting the method fall into ruin.

The ancients sometimes concealed names within symbolic forms, or entrusted them to yin and yang, subtly conveying secret teachings—yet their subtlety made them difficult to grasp, and confusion naturally arose. Hence the saying:
*"Atop the purple clouds it is born,
The White Tiger holds true qi.
Beyond these idle texts,
None compare to the *Triple Concordance Canon*."*

Another verse marvels:
*"The White Tiger embraces the Crimson Dragon,
One soars, one sinks.
A single thing threads five hues,
Forever the immortal’s bounty."*

The *Tortoise Shell Scripture* states: *"My life is in my hands, not in Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth possess gold—I can make it. Two yellows and one red, swiftly accomplished without doubt."* The Perfected One said: *"Within the Return there is gold; within gold, there is Return."* Thus it is said: *"See gold and regard it as earth and stone."* It is also called *Heaven-Bearing Dragon and Tiger* and *Taiyi’s Yin Talisman*. The *Scripture of the Dragon and Tiger* says: *"Lest the Heavenly One’s talisman be revealed."* The *Secret Transmission* states: *"Three Lights and Six Sinks."* The Three Lights are water, earth, and metal. The Three and Five: the Dao generates yin, yin generates yang, and yin and yang generate the Five Phases. Through refinement and sublimation, the Returned Elixir is achieved, becoming one.

The Three Honored Ones of the Returned Elixir are water, earth, and metal. Heaven’s Three Honored Ones are the sun, moon, and stars. Earth’s Three Honored Ones are mountains, seas, and rivers. Man’s Three Honored Ones are ruler, father, and teacher. The body’s Three Honored Ones are the Three Elixir Fields. The Perfected One Zhang Daoling said: *"Within your body lies the Way of yellow and red, the methods of yin and yang, Three, Five, Seven, and Nine. If you attain this, you may receive the teaching of immortality."* The Three pertain to the three *hun* souls, belonging to the left. The Seven pertain to the seven *po* souls, belonging to the right. The Azure Rainbow is Heaven’s *hun* soul, appearing in the east. The White Rainbow is Heaven’s *po* soul, appearing in the west. The head has nine palaces; the Hall of Light has one—whoever perceives it becomes a divine immortal. Man mirrors Heaven and Earth, hence the method of Three, Five, Seven, and Nine.

The *Scripture of the Dragon and Tiger* states: *"Three, Five, and One—the essence of Heaven and Earth."* The three substances—water, earth, and metal—through transformation, sublimation, and refinement, become the Great Returned Elixir. Beyond these three, auxiliary ingredients are not the primary agents and need not be discussed.

**Explaining the Golden Liquid**

To refine the Golden Liquid, one must first achieve Yellow and White. Only when Yellow and White are accomplished does one grasp the principle of metal and stone. If Yellow and White are not achieved, how can one refine the Golden Liquid? Stone gold is hard and hot, toxic—difficult to liquefy. If by chance it is achieved, it resembles glue and is unfit for ingestion, corroding the bones and marrow. When medicinal gold is achieved, it may then be made into Golden Liquid—yellow and crimson as water. Ingesting it, one soars to Heaven. Like a man drinking wine, it permeates the body, dispersing like wind and rain. All these are the essences of various medicines, gathered and transformed. Thus, when the divine liquid is achieved, metal and stone are transmuted.

To ingest the Golden Liquid: on a *jiǎzǐ* day, sit like a crane, facing the sun, and meditate on the Heavenly Perfection. Upon ingestion, the body turns golden. Feathered banners and dragon chariots coil down to welcome one’s ascent—one ascends lightly in broad daylight.

**Explaining Yin and Yang**

The Great Dao is empty and harmonious, embracing Heaven and Earth, driving yin and yang to form the cosmos. Heaven’s form is yang, revolving leftward; Earth’s substance is yin, turning rightward. The sun is the essence of yang, moving by day; the moon is the spirit of yin, flowing by night. Sun and moon hang their radiance, and man is born between them, embracing yang and carrying yin. The sage models Heaven and Earth, discerning yin and yang, externally harmonizing with creation to achieve the Returned Elixir, and internally nurturing essence and qi to secure the body. Then the intestines are free of residue, the nine orifices open and close, and one practices stillness. Not partaking of the five flavors, the five viscera remain pure. Not listening to the five sounds, the spirit can transform. Wearing plain robes and simple sashes, one tempers the body; dwelling alone, one seals the essence. Thus, qi transforms into blood, and blood is yin.

Blood transforms into essence, and essence is yang. Essence is the numinous spirit that guards the bones; when essence is exhausted, the bones wither, and when the bones wither, the spirit grieves—grief of the spirit leads to death. Refining the spirit and guarding essence is the principle of longevity.

The *Changsheng cheng* states:
*"I urge you to study the Dao and hold fast to integrity,
First sever the five grains and forsake the six passions.
Ingest primordial qi to fill the five forms,
Roam freely and follow the wind’s path."*

The *Neijing Jing* says: *"Those who seek immortality must be most cautious in the chamber of desire—why court death and make the spirit weep?"* The spirit is yang, and the body is yin; the living are yang, while ghosts are yin. When yang is exhausted, it vanishes; yang shines while yin conceals. Thus, the Great Medicine transcends the world, summoning yang by calling yin, with azure lads in attendance and spirits at command.

When cold, contemplate the Great Yang to grow warm; when hot, contemplate the Great Yin to grow cool. Whistling, one summons wind and clouds; treading, one crosses seas and mountains. Sitting or standing, one appears and vanishes, moving between yin and yang—being yet not being, neither existing nor non-existing.
