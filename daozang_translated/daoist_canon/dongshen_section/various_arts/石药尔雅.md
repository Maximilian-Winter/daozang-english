*The Er’ya of Alchemical Minerals*

**Title:** *The Er’ya of Alchemical Minerals*. Compiled by Mei Biao of the Tang. One fascicle. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, "Wondrous Arts" category of the *Dongshen* section.

**Preface to *The Er’ya of Alchemical Minerals***
The *Er’ya* was composed by the ancients to explicate and resolve what was difficult to seek. I have always marveled at its ingenious and unparalleled mechanism. Thus, it has been employed by the court and endured through many ages. I am from Jiangyuan in western Shu. From youth, I was fond of the Dao and its arts, my nature inclined toward elixir techniques. From my tender years to the age of knowing fate, I exhaustively studied the classics and formulas, having perused the works of hundreds of masters—all as clear as the lines on my palm. Yet the ingredients they used were all concealed by hidden names. Within these hidden names, moreover, there were many variants. Without comprehensive knowledge, one might as well chase painted cakes or dreamt peaches; encountering their formulas would be no different from never having encountered them at all. I have often sighed in frustration over this matter, lamenting the absence of a teacher—what recourse is there?

I once read in the *Cantong Qi*: "If one cannot fully investigate, one should provide straightforward explanations—thus is the principle exhausted." The classic states: "I wished to seal my tongue and speak not, fearing the crime of execution; yet to inscribe my thoughts on bamboo and silk would risk leaking the celestial tally." Thus do we know that the sagely and perfect Dao, the mysterious and wondrous method, is not meant for the vulgar—only by chance might it be heard and understood. Therefore, the matter is presented in a roundabout manner, so that superior scholars may diligently study it, while inferior scholars may discard and ridicule it—such is the evident principle.

Yet I fear that later learners may share my hardships. Thus, I have appended the oral instructions of six schools and the alternative names of various minerals, modeling the phrasing after the *Er’ya*. In six sections, I have compiled them into one fascicle, so that those lost in confusion may find it somewhat easier to seek, and those practicing the art may recite it without difficulty. I have also included all the alternative names for ingredients used in various elixirs, listing the designations of extraordinary formulas and rare safeguards that possess methods for preparation at the forefront, while those without methods or difficult to produce are recorded afterward.

Written in the *bingxu* year of the Yuanhe era of the Tang by Mei Biao.

The above-listed formulas, all extant in the world’s written records, may serve to secure wealth and profit or to nurture one’s nature and preserve life. Should one encounter even a single method, it may be put to use. Yet if one attends to them all, the paths are indeed manifold. Among these many, only the Dao admits of superiority and inferiority—each follows the vessel’s capacity and pursues what it favors. Thus, water is unfit for riding swift steeds, and land is unsuited to sailing light boats. Though rice, millet, pickled greens, and meat all alike satisfy hunger, and hemp, ramie, fine silk, and coarse cloth all alike provide warmth, hunger and warmth may be the same, yet refinement and coarseness differ. Those who chase sweet profit prize the Lesser Elixir as gold; those who cherish longevity revere the Greater Elixir as treasure. The value of gold and treasure is equal to one’s allotted share—hence they are all recorded above.

Ingesting them, one ascends to heaven in broad daylight, sprouts feathered wings, and moves with unfettered transformation, sitting where one wills yet leaving no trace. Their ingredients and methods lie beyond the ken of mundane folk, and none may fathom their essential subtleties. Unless one bears innate immortal bones, has accumulated merit over generations, or receives the method in a dream from the gods, their formulas cannot be obtained.
