*The Esoteric Essentials of the Five Correspondences of the Cantong qi*
Presented by the Imperial Academy Supervisor of Huainan West Circuit, Gentleman for Manifesting Virtue, Bearer of the Silver Fish-Tally, Your Servant Lu Tianji, on behalf of the Perfected of Great Simplicity, Wei Boyang.

Yang: one, two, three, four, five.
Water, fire, wood, metal, earth.
Yin: six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

Formerly, the Perfected Wei Boyang, together with Chunyu Shutong, transmitted the *Cantong qi* and ancient songs to Xu, the Attendant Officer of Qingzhou. After Master Wei attained the elixir, he composed these *Five Correspondences*. Later, he ascended on clouds and departed, commanding his disciple to inscribe them in large seal script. No other versions exist; all claim this to be the middle fascicle of the *Cantong qi*, though such views are shallow indeed.

Now, the *Five Correspondences* discusses the mutual resonance of all things, the subjugation of the Three Yellows and Two Treasures—hence the name "Five." The treatise states:

What Heaven engenders as the Primordial Maiden is mercury.
What Earth engenders as the Yellow Lad is gold.
Both receive the nature of the Great Harmony’s subtle reversal: left as yang, right as yin, taking their positions to interpenetrate. Thus, mercury and gold are the true essence of Heaven and Earth’s harmonious union, born from the primal darkness.

Initially, it is cinnabar, belonging to the left and dwelling in the East. Later, it transforms into mercury, dwelling in the West as the right—this is the borrowing of position. *Zhang* and *Yi* soar to *Xu* and *Wei*: this is the first transformation. *Zhang* and *Yi* are the southern constellations, cinnabar; *Xu* and *Wei* are the northern lodgings, mercury. Emerging from cinnabar, it flies from south to north—this is the first transformation.

By the nature of its received life, it undergoes one transmutation into the elixir. Reversing cinnabar into mercury, reversing mercury into the elixir—thus the elixir is once transformed. Once stabilized, it ascends to the Upper Palace. The Palace is the Vermilion Palace of the South, where mercury’s transformations are fixed. Then, it is no longer subject to the myriad things, for mercury governs the transformations of the ten thousand beings.

The Great Yang’s white mercury—mercury is quicksilver, the essence of yin. It originally contains the Crimson Waters, for mercury is born from cinnabar, hence it is said to contain the Crimson Waters. "Returning my elixir-fluid": reversing mercury into cinnabar is the union of husband and wife, for mercury is originally cinnabar. Its pure black essence contains the Azure.

Black lead is mercury’s azure hue, its position belonging to the East as vermilion—this is the essence of wood, hence it is called azure. Now, the Four Images establish their roots, each with its own explanation, then follow their natures to harmonize them. For the awakened, it is easy; for the deluded, it is difficult.

For the awakened, it is exceedingly easy; for the deluded, exceedingly difficult.

The primordial essence follows the Dipper’s handle in spring—this primordial essence is the Zi-mercury. In the eleventh month, when Zi is established, the spring yang’s blackness arises. Thus, in the eleventh month, it receives the yang by the inch, for the eleventh month is when the Dipper’s handle begins at Zi. Moreover, east and west mutually devour one another: the east is vermilion, the west is silver, and these two substances consume each other. Yin’s encroachment resides in You, coming and going through the Central Palace. The Central Palace is realgar. Yin-mercury, the You-metal, and the eleven substances contend, initially subduing the realgar’s blackness to dominate the mercury. The two natures harmonize, using metal to harmonize mercury—some say using mercury to harmonize cinnabar. It serves as wife and child, as mother and lord, as minister and assistant. When mercury employs lead as its wife, it is like the relationship of child and mother, lord and minister. Now, by obtaining the nodal tally to govern and restrain it, it is like water extinguishing fire, and the fire must submit. If one follows the seasonal nodes and the timing of the fire’s advance and retreat, the Five Phases transform and restrain, and metal and mercury will naturally submit. With the tally upright and the task direct, ascent and descent are determined, and success is assured.

Now, the *Cantong Qi* aligns with the Five Phases, the inner and outer Six Pitches, all establishing their weights and measures to discern their kind. If the Great Elixir does not follow the yin-yang and Five Phases, precisely determining its kind, it will certainly not succeed. The Five Phases spoken of here are of the same marrow and kind. The Great Yang’s mercury is the Great Yang’s red marrow—cinnabar-mercury. It is also called Great Yang mercury. Great Yang is the alternate name for cinnabar. Great Yang realgar contains the essence it receives; Great Yin orpiment congeals its fluids with its kind—this is the great Way of the Returned Elixir. The essence is realgar, the yin-fluid is orpiment; these are alternate names for the Great Returned Elixir.

Moreover, the male kind pertains to roasted cinnabar: when the male obtains roasted cinnabar and enters the crucible, it swiftly becomes a water like blood. Day and night, the fire burns, sealing it until it submits—thus, one knows it is not in error. If the male does not obtain roasted cinnabar, its color will not manifest. The female kind pertains to honey-water and fritillaria: when placed in a small crucible, the orpiment is dissolved and killed with fritillaria powder, then rapidly stirred and poured into honey-water. Neither loses its original nature. Other methods are difficult to align with their kind and should not be trusted.

When yellow arsenic obtains halloysite, it immediately congeals and does not fly. When ground into a ceramic powder and packed into a tube, fired for twenty days, it submits without losing its original form. When sulfur enters magnetite, it is simmered with brine to become of the same kind. *Shu* is bittern. Simmer it in a ceramic vessel, ensuring no flame or fire that does not boil. Do not use the sulfur of Emperor Wu of Wei, which flows through the Five Transformations and Five Metals. After a hundred days of simmering, it is complete.

Mercury resembles rouge: when it obtains fire, it swiftly becomes water. The rouge is sulfur. Retrieve it quickly, for if delayed, fire will emerge and burn it spontaneously. After seven cycles, it becomes the Returned Elixir within the crucible. Ingesting it grants longevity and the power of transmutation. The rouge is sulfur, which transforms mercury into cinnabar. When mercury obtains sulfur, it no longer moves, for it is restrained by earth. Sulfur belongs to earth, and mercury, thus restrained, becomes like mud. When placed in the furnace and fired, it becomes cinnabar.

The Great Yin’s mountain soul resembles cinnabar and immediately becomes white mud. The cinnabar is mercury; the mountain soul is orpiment. Harmonize it with silver and nurture it for fifteen days. Xin-You is the position of metal. The Great Yang’s cinnabar-soul resembles unstrained wine. *Niang* is strong spring wine. From the third month, it enters the floating vessel, and by the fifth month’s longest day, it is placed in the sun. Naturally, it returns to frost—how can this not be trusted? This is the spontaneous transformation of yin and yang into the Returned Elixir, differing from the common, for it is the natural principle of heaven and earth. How can one claim that human effort can refine and transform it to achieve success?

Lead resembles the dead soul of mulberry ash. After nine cycles of refining in the ash, it enters the frost of the Red Crow’s foot, becoming the nine-cycle immortal elixir. It governs the Eight Stones and Five Metals, and those who ingest it attain longevity. Tin resembles litharge combined with the five-colored mountain soul. The mountain soul is the five kinds of halloysite. It becomes five-colored frost, which is then placed in the mercury-ox ford, applied to the elixir cauldron. Cover it with a wooden basin and fly it from Yin to Xu. The frost in the basin submits after twenty days of martial fire, burning day and night. The golden crucible and Five Metals do not begrudge this great secret, and the frost’s five colors are unparalleled.

Copper resembles the essence of heavy cinnabar. The essence is coagulated cinnabar. When cinnabar enters the leaking furnace and undergoes fifty cycles, copper in three to five measures becomes white metal, which can immediately relieve poverty. Persian *shesu* (five catties) enters plain white frost to become of the same kind. The five catties of Persian *shesu* stone and the white frost are silver mixed in an earthen crucible. Cover it with *daoxing* divine bone to a thickness of five inches. Perform one cycle per hour, and add yin-beast juice to drip and collect the solidified substance. Gradually apply fire over three seasons to form the *shesu* powder’s beast juice. The black ox’s urine and *daoxing* divine bone are the salt of the Rong. Kunlun resembles sheep: Kunlun is azurite, like sheep’s fluid, which is sheep’s fat. When azurite is refined into a powdery fluid and mixed with sheep’s fat, then steamed with cinnabar rice for fifteen cycles, it submits within a small chamber. Regardless of the Five Metals, all can follow this method of submission. Do not let the essence’s blackness escape. After ten cycles of flying, it becomes the Green Dragon, standing erect to restrain vermilion.

The primordial essence is mercury. Mercury can also restrain cinnabar-red copper. Void resembles *daidan*: the void is malachite, and *daidan* is hematite. Grind them together in a bowl until powdery. Mix them with the primordial essence, steam them with cinnabar rice, then place them in a yellow earth crucible and seal it tightly. Burn it with Zi charcoal for twenty days, and it will immediately transform the Five Metals. Dry mercury swiftly becomes white metal.

This, too, is a method to save the world. The primordial essence is brine, also called the primordial yin essence. When yin subdues the Metal Duke, it swiftly becomes flying frost; when yang governs, it immediately requires pavilion fat. Pavilion fat is sulfur. The Metal Duke’s flying frost—mercury—momentarily turns to black mud. Placed in a Fengcheng porcelain vessel, it yields crimson frost and returns to essence: a great secret indeed. The child receives the mother, clad in coarse cloth to retain it. The child is mercury; the mother is silver. When the mother transforms the child, there is *geng* and the cycle is fixed. *Geng* is metal. Mercury, the child, is fixed by the cinnabar of silver. Thus transformed into a substance, it may be used. The root and subtle are fully subdued; the green vigor does not allow flight or coagulation, truly relying on the Great Yang, for yang unites with mercury. They contend as equals, mutually transforming and employing one another. Mercury and silver contend equally, each restraining the other. They can also hollow out and penetrate the eternal, ascending and descending with metal as their sign. This is the void of great hardness. If one wishes to fly the soul, to the ninth it returns to life; the seven talismans do not revert—nine is cinnabar, seven is mercury. Returning to metal to form the elixir, consuming it grants the spirit and soul longevity, equal to the sun, moon, heaven, and earth. Reverted, it becomes the five phases’ parents, sovereign and ministers—how could one set aside the great elixir? Mercury, belonging to one of the five phases, as parent, sovereign, or minister, can restrain and revert to become the great elixir. I have seen many schools’ teachings, all claiming their own ability without discerning yin and yang, ignorant of kindred types. Some great sages conceal their secrets in hidden sayings, yet fail to comprehend them upon reading, applying their own interpretations and straying far from the sages’ intent. To know the furnace and fire, to restrain and govern mineral medicines, one must seek prescriptions and commentaries, cultivate a tranquil mind in the classics, thoroughly understand the ancients’ texts, and devote careful thought—this is the great Dao. Now, the famous caves of various mountains yield different teachings from masters. Most alchemical schools discuss meanings and interpretations, each capable of practical work. All claim one must examine prescriptions and subtle principles, infer the ultimate truths of yin and yang, and thus know what is akin. The dragon and horse receive the harness—the dragon is *qian*, the horse is *kun*; these are vessels. Dragon and tiger devour each other—dragon is mercury, tiger is silver; the two substances harmonize, mutually consuming one another. Male and female unite—male and female conjoin, the male as yang, the female as yin; the two yellows harmonize their metal and mercury. Father and son share reverence—the father is cinnabar, the son is mercury. The mother transforms and contains the kind—the mother, metal, contains the mercury child. White and red float together—white alum and red salt. Black and green are both restrained—black silver and malachite. The six spirits revolve leftward, from *zi* to *si*, passing through my palace. This means starting with mercury as cinnabar, from *zi* (mercury) to *si* and *wu*, reverting mercury to red cinnabar. From the beginning, a brief rightward turn accords with heaven and earth—mercury turns left to right, forming the body of metal. Circulating through the eight nodes, fixing the four seasons, alternating captives contend for precedence, relying on the two solstices to determine days and hours, nurturing the fire. This verifies the position of the five—five is earth, referring to the union of yang and yin in blackness.

In praise:
The utmost sages and great worthies inscribed these three transformations.

Cinnabar resides in the south, yet also pertains to the east’s mercury, and likewise to the north. Each knows its position—dragon and tiger contend for precedence. Red marrow gradually turns purple; the tiger is silver, the dragon mercury. Red is cinnabar, and cinnabar is the name for that crimson hue. White alum connects to the primordial. Specifically born of alumstone, within lies bright alum, capable of restraining mercury. Bearing my eight stones—three yellows and five metals—these are called the eight stones. All settle in *qianqian*. In the north, mercury becomes gold.

Arranging the five directions: the five directions mean cinnabar is set forth among the five phases to enable their union. Miscellaneous categories are hard to speak of. Fix upon the Red Emperor—the Red Emperor is another name for mercury. Throughout the land, the five are relinquished. The principle of discarding the mother is that the child alone enacts it. Remove the stone, employing one to restrain nine—one part silver to nine parts mercury. Gold restrains mercury, thereby subduing it.

Establish the five and determine the seven. Seven is metal; five is orpiment. One black spans three nodes—one black for fifteen days, one node every five days. Seven and eight combine. The Way of seven and eight: seven parts mercury, seven taels; eight parts silver, eight taels. Another saying: seven and eight form an image in fifteen days. Here the reverted elixir appears.

Use alumstone—namely, the three envoy medicines: the three envoys are chalcanthite, yellow alum, and white alum. Employ the two greens—*zeng* and *kong*. Yet one must not use *taiyin* primordial water stone, which is brine. Male and female unite with yellow—the three *bian* frosts, that is, sulfur. Refine with fire. Treat with water stone and salt, boiling for a month to subdue the fire. This is the preparation of the four yellows, where the five alums and the like are not used.

The two alums hold firm: the method of using fire—long with civil, short with martial—ensures the restraint is not lost. The great elixir medicine must not be placed upon raw charcoal; it requires matured fire.

In verse:
Depth and length unite to grasp yin and yang.
The crucible’s form resembles an upturned moon,
or like a sphere, its lower edges meeting the upper,
requiring careful crafting to avoid the slightest discrepancy.
A thick base preserves the medicine forever—
meaning to fashion it from lead or silver,
like the form of *hundun*,
nurturing the divine medicine to attain everlasting prosperity.
The sun’s flowing pearl enters the flower pond—
the flowing pearl is mercury.
The black pond’s left flavor:
use it to boil mercury and silver,
then bind the cinnabar grains,
grind them together, and place them in the vessel.
Red salt and white snow form male and female—
alum and brine are conjoined and refined
to produce the crimson hue, hence called red salt.
Use it to fly and create the elixir’s frost and snow.
White snow and the two snows, male and female,
are all names for these.
The Way is not distant, yet people do not know—
the method lies before their eyes, yet they remain unaware.

Red dragon transforms into powder, mercury turns to red powder.
White tiger sharp as frost.
Lead and mercury together transform all at once,
like frost and snow.
Within it, cast the stone liquid—
stone liquid refers to sulfur.
Then use the imperial flowing broth.
To subdue and refine the stone liquid,
one must employ the Dark Emperor’s flowing broth,
which is the liquid of magnet mother.

Harmonize the spirits of the five viscera to clarity,
regulating and sustaining the fire’s movement,
nurturing the five phases’ black spirits within the elixir chamber,
as one preserves the five viscera in purity and solemnity.

To refine the Three Yellows:
lead and mercury must be subdued by the Three Yellows’ fire
to return to pure yang essence.
The Three Yellows belong to earth,
and earth generates metal, hence their use.
Their nature is excessively hot,
for they are the essence of the Great Yang—
mercury and lead thus employ them.
The Three Yellows are: one realgar, one orpiment, and one sulfur.

Azurite can communicate with the divine luminants,
being the sprout of metal and its messenger—
realgar, orpiment, sulfur, and gold thus become its blossoms.

In the Great Return Elixir,
lead serves as the host,
quicksilver as the sovereign,
sulfur as the minister,
realgar as the general,
orpiment as the assistant,
and azurite as the envoy.
Thus sovereign and minister pair,
host and general bind and subdue,
assistant and envoy circulate and convey.
Though initially borrowed as auxiliary aids,
over time they become subdued fire ashes.

Not yet discerning firm nature—
raw mercury and hardened silver—
refers to the undifferentiated nature of mother and child.
How to employ yin and yang?
Yin and yang are Qian and Kun.
This means first determining the two medicines,
the crucible’s subjugation,
the fire’s cyclical application,
and the mutual restraint of Qian and Kun’s two trigrams.

From *zi* to *chen-si* is the direct tally,
from *wu* to *xu-hai* is the direct affair—
modeling the hexagrams’ forms to fix the fire’s numbers.

*Can Tong Qi’s* Five Categories of Secret Essentials concludes.
