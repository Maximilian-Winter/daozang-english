**The Great Elixir Scroll**

*Title:* The Great Elixir Scroll. Author unknown, likely compiled between the late Five Dynasties and early Song period. A collection of elixir scriptures and verses from various Tang and Five Dynasties alchemical traditions, with brief annotations. One fascicle.

*Source:* From the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, under the *Dongshen* Division, *Zhongshu* Category.

Master Yuanyangzi said: The Golden Tiger is the root of the Returned Elixir. The Golden Tiger is not the name of two separate substances but refers to lead and mercury. Lead, black in color, belongs to the north and water, numbered one—knowing the One, all things are complete. As the *Canticle* states: "Lead contains the five colors, corresponding to the five directions." It also says: "Three yellows and one black—even in seeking death, one cannot perish." Three yellows and one black is the name of the numinous elixir. By cultivating the Three-in-One, one is certain to attain transcendence as a flying immortal.

Water is one; wood is three. The mercury of lead ore is green. It is further said: Once the Golden Elixir is achieved, the fire-toxin must be expelled. If the fire-toxin is not expelled, consuming it will cause sores in the mouth and nose, with a constant burning sensation in the cheeks as if scorched by fire—this must be purged. First, take paper mulberry juice and form pills the size of sesame seeds. Then, use jujube pulp to bind them, storing them in a raw silk pouch.

Dig a pit one foot and five inches deep, line it with layers of fine paper, then mound damp soil around it for seven days. Uncover it and suspend it in a well, three to five feet above the water, for three days. This is called "summoning the cold spring to dispel the toxin." Retrieve it from the vessel and expose it to the clear night dew for seven nights. This is called "summoning the Celestial River to expel the toxin." If the elixir becomes active, decoct licorice into a thick liquid, strain off the dregs, and sip it day and night to gradually resolve the fire-toxin.

The Supreme Yin Lady states: "The Golden Liquid Flower Elixir gives rise to feathered robes; a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes leave no room for doubt." This is the essential Dao of the highest immortals.

The *Dragon-and-Tiger Upper Scripture* says:
"Cinnabar is the essence of wood, and only when it meets metal do they merge.
If one seeks longevity, mercury must die; if mercury does not die, one labors in vain.
The child of cinnabar-wood is carved by metal; water serves as its mother, and earth dams it.
The Dao of flying immortals does not wait for time—the achievement of the Returned Elixir is complete herein.
If one comprehends the principle of the Great Dao and awaits the harmony of the two qi of the bell and pitch-pipe, the yellow and white will surely be accomplished."

The *Golden and Azure Song* of Yellow Ox Mountain says:
"Water and fire alone pair together, lingering to generate auspicious clouds."
Seven reversions refer to cinnabar.
Mercury is the true qi of yin, capable of nurturing the myriad things. Thus, yang is restless while yin is tranquil—tranquility is the Dao of non-death.

The Scripture says: "Heaven is mysterious, earth is yellow; obtain and consume them, and you have the formula of non-death."
The Scripture says:
"The White Tiger contains the Red Dragon; one flies, one hides.
A single thing permeates the five colors, forever serving as the immortal’s emolument."

The gate of metals and stones holds many secrets. Yet the world’s people lack wisdom and do not understand this Dao, so the marvel of the great elixir of lead and mercury remains obscure. Thus, the ignorant are many, the greedy are numerous, and those who achieve success are few. One must not lightly divulge the hidden texts of the celestial Dao. Noble gentlemen who love the Dao and seek worthy perfected ones should reflect further.

The mother of cinnabar is mercury, the essence of the moon, born of yang. It responds to heaven as a minister and assists the human body to attain non-death. Cinnabar belongs to the fire of the southern direction. Fire is the child of wood, the grandchild of water, and the mother of earth. Thus, earth and stone are the soul and spirit of cinnabar.

Yang medicines include seven metals, two stones, and five yellows—white male and female, arsenic yellow, and malachite. Yin medicines include seven metals, three stones, and four waters—gold, silver, lead, tin, saltpeter, mirabilite, and the like.

The *Song of the Yellow Sprout in the Three Hidden Phases of Dragon and Tiger* says:
"The Black Dragon transforms, and the Red Dragon is born;
The Yellow Spirit coagulates, and the water becomes limpid.
Immortals call it the established restraining stone—
After a hundred refinements, it finally assumes the form of a serpent.
Its yin power gleams with a radiant hue,
Striking and resonating with a deep, bell-like sound.
Within the golden crucible, observe the image of Qian;
Water and earth constrain each other, blending Jia and Geng.
The dragon hides, the tiger is restrained, yet neither dares submit;
The two qi drift leisurely in Bing and Ding.
When the three yangs of Jiazi take form,
After a thousand washings and ten thousand refinements, the flowing yellow becomes light."

Master Liu’s Song:
"Above the three mountains’ crucible lie ninefold barriers;
The maiden unveils her countenance to gaze within.
If the Dark Warrior can capture the White Tiger,
In three nights and five dawns, it will naturally congeal and return."
Boiling with divine water restores its original color.

Another Song:
"When one can employ water and fire,
Mother and child sit facing each other.
Once the sixty-four hexagrams are complete,
Yellow gold fills the load.
The ancients did not desire a load of gold—
They only sought the elixir to consume."

The Seven Songs of the Great Elixir by the Nine Heavens Perfected Lord:

1.
"Heaven is mysterious, earth is yellow;
Lead is white, forming the frame.
The divine chamber above and below
Never strays from its native land.
Those who awaken attain the Dao;
Those who lose it fall into madness.
What kind of crucible is this crucible?
What kind of medicine is this medicine?
Is it formed by the four images,
Or created by the five spirits?
Of different kinds and not of the same lineage,
Mother and child rely on each other.
The Yellow Sprout does not use lead,
Yet it is made within lead.
The wise ponder this—
How can one know the Dao is learnable?
Without obtaining the Yellow Sprout sand,
Even if one proceeds, one will surely err."

2.
"Metal Duke becomes marrow and sinew,
The seven treasures serve as the finest matchmakers.
The Crone’s Daughter lures the cinnabar in,
And the mysterious yellow stabilizes the po soul’s return.
Why trouble those who inquire of the Dao?
One naturally attains Penglai."

3.
"Sun and moon naturally conjoin,
Qian and Kun unite in two lines.
The Central Palace serves as a cover,
The white liquid envelops itself again.
Gold and mercury become husband and wife,
Water and fire beckon each other.
If one alters the nature of yin and yang,
First civil, then martial, they harmonize.
If one can only know the firm and the one,
One rides the crane into the clouds."

4.
"The essence of the Dark and Obscure is nurtured by heaven;
The white stone, when refined, sheds its sand and wrinkles.
Refining the obscure essence yields a purple radiance;
After the white stone is cast into the sand, it endures overnight.
Two parts water enter the mother as the foundation;
The mercury in the chamber cannot be grasped by others.
Bing and Ding apply the northern moon’s lodging—
One hundred fifty, plus three sixes.
After three sixes are removed, the medicine becomes even more efficacious;
The Yellow Sprout responds, becoming golden essence.
If this substance is combined with the River Chariot,
It will join the River Chariot in the north.
The immortal medicine is most wondrous and difficult to obtain;
It cures ten thousand illnesses and restores black hair.
Avoid consuming fish and turtles;
Only the dewy bramble most strongly counteracts it."

5.
"The flowing pearl, when met with fire, naturally flies;
Only the Yellow Sprout can restrain it.
Gold, when placed in fierce fire, does not change color—
This is the natural Dao, ever constant in its cycle.
The vermilion child, resplendent and unadorned,
Aspires to share a chamber with the lead flower.
The Dao of yin and yang lies in oneness—
Ponder this carefully, and do not let it slip away."

6.
"First enter water, then enter fire;
The mysterious yellow liquid transforms into the elixir.
The body grows feathered wings, becoming one of the nine immortals;
The five-colored radiance transforms into a thousand forms.
At this time, one should rejoice."

7.
"Thirty catties of the Yellow Dragon and black lead,
When met with fire, do not fly—the stone is most divine.
The white stone of the northern direction must be finely ground;
It can be transformed without blemish or dust.
The River Crone must be genuine—
When she sees fire, she does not flee, like a loyal minister.
If one cannot become a great vessel, one remains a petty person;
After ninety-one days, it barks forth yellow silver.
When realgar is subdued by fire,
Black water naturally becomes gold."

Lord Li of Jingnan’s *Great Elixir Scripture of Golden Liquor*

Lord Li’s personal name was Tuo, a disciple of the Perfected Lord Sima of Jiannan. Master Zhang, whose given name was Tao, was by nature fond of esoteric texts. From childhood he yearned for the Dao, lived in the world for over four hundred years, and later ascended in transformation.

The Perfected Lord said:
*"The good has no head, the cauldron has a base—
When the two things meet, they naturally unite as one."*

"The good has no head" refers to *gen* (艮), the mountain trigram. The mountain’s form is that of a mountain, and what is of the mountain is its substance. "The cauldron has a base" refers to metal. Metal not yet separated from its mother is true lead. Lead contains the five colors and belongs to the metal within the water of the northern direction. Metal is the defense of yang; with prolonged refinement, lead itself becomes gold.

"When the two things meet, they naturally unite as one." The character for "unite" (*jiu*, 就) here means "silver"—this silver is the silver of the northern direction’s liquid metal, not the silver of the western direction’s metal. The silver of the western direction is refined silver, located in the White Tiger’s position, also called "rotted silver" in the marketplace. The *Scripture of Hidden Communication* forbids its use. It is only fit for making vessels, not for alchemical work.

One must take the naturally occurring silver from the mountains and use it in its raw state—this is the field of the great elixir. Thus the *Scripture of Hidden Communication* states: "The ancients did not smelt silver in furnaces; they took the ore in its raw state and used it." This means that within it lies true lead, and true lead is silver. It also says: "True lead is cinnabar-formed red silver. It may be used as the head of the elixir, transforming yin into yang. Without refining mercury, take the two substances—vermilion lead—and place them in the crucible. Refine them with cow-dung fire, and they will naturally unite within to form the returning elixir."

The *Cantong Qi* states: *"Red and black penetrate inner and outer—this is the foremost method."* The meaning is: simply take raw silver from mountain caves and use it as the seed of the fire medicine—this is the correct and true method, the "heaven-born sprout."

A song says:
*"Do not break my chariot, do not abandon my homeward path.
If you burn away the lead, you ruin the chariot."*

To ruin the chariot’s body is to fail to retain the medicine. It also loses the meaning of the Kan male of the northern direction and cannot be completed. But if one takes silver and uses it, this is the true "one water" number. It is also the essence of the moon and the soul of the earth. It is also called "lead-containing silver," for silver belongs to water. Naturally, the surplus of whetstone is cinnabar—daily whetting produces cinnabar. It is also a heaven-born, natural substance, the chief of the seventy-two stones and the lord of the medicines of longevity. It is also called "essence of the sun," for it transforms and generates life.

The southern direction belongs to fire, whose number is two; within it lies one yin, the female. Take cinnabar from Chenzhou and Jinzhou as the highest grade, using it in its raw state. It is the treasure of heaven and earth, sun and moon, the root of immortals’ feathered transformation. Those who aspire to the Dao must rely on it—without it, one cannot awaken to the Way.

A song says:
*"Do not ruin me, and my life will be preserved."*

Another song says:
*"Sun and moon urge each other on;
Vermilion and lead unite in the lead furnace."*

Sun and moon are Kan and Li. The true body of the medicine is yin and yang urging each other to unite—vermilion is the child of wood, with mercury-water within. Turning toward the southeast, it becomes the dragon, corresponding to the Zhen trigram. Do not add other medicines; simply apply control directly. Water and fire *are* the medicine—no other substances are needed. Thus it is said: "Do not use other medicines; apply control directly." Control means yin controlling yang, with yin above and yang below. Water and fire rush together—these are the essence and soul of Kan and Li, sun and moon. Their mutual seeking is the sign of water and fire. Water and fire act as matchmakers, uniting as servants: yin uses water as its matchmaker, yang uses fire. When mercury becomes yang, the flowing pearl is complete—one must be vigilant. If moved by fire, it circulates through the six voids, employing the six trigrams.

After three days, the Zhen trigram stirs. At three times five, virtue is perfected, and the Qian body is formed—three yangs are fully beautiful. After sixteen transformations, it becomes the Xun trigram, with one yin born. At twenty-three, the lower crescent appears, and two yins form the Gen trigram. At thirty days, it ends in Kun, with three yins born, returning to earth. The returning elixir’s beginning and end unite the two bodies. In the northeast, one loses a companion; in the southwest, one gains a companion—yin and yang are paired from beginning to end.

When refinement reaches the Purple Palace, the person transcends the world. The Purple Palace is the ninth palace of the southern direction. Mercury comes from the south and arrives in the north as purple. Refining liquid silver in the west and moving fire, it returns to the west’s original position. Passing through the purple color is called the returning elixir. Ingesting it, one soars to heaven—thus it is said the person transcends the world.

The *Scripture of Hidden Communication* states: *"Golden powder, vermilion mercury-water, placed in a silver vessel—after a set number of transformations, it is done."* If one does not recognize fire-lead and water, even if one understands myriad methods, it will be of no avail. "Fire aids" means fire containing liquid silver, for water conceals its treasure. If one does not recognize lead, mercury, water, and fire, though one may produce many elixirs, none will be a treasure for the body.

Metal overcomes wood to generate fire; fire overcomes metal to generate water; water generates metal. In refining the great elixir, the five phases mutually generate and overcome, employing the five agents. The *Scripture of the Numinous Terrace of Metals and Stones* states: "This is the Dao of heaven and earth in its natural state. Moreover, yin and yang, Kan and Li, sun and moon, hardness and softness, day and night, temperament and nature—soul and spirit oppose and restrain each other. Thus, with the balance of weights and measures, hardness and softness alternate, yin and yang generate each other, and transformations are inexhaustible. Above, they correspond to the sun, moon, and stars; below, to water, fire, and metal. Therefore, the sage responds to the celestial tally, comprehends the principles of change and communication, and through them, the myriad things are born. Those who earnestly seek the Dao and explore the truth of its arts may observe the nature of metals and stones. But those of shallow learning, limited vision, and impure hearts should not pursue it."

Master Peng’s song says:
*"Water flows downward, moistening;
Fire’s nature flames upward.
Water and fire, husband and wife—
Sometimes waning, sometimes waxing.
Like the stars Shen and Shang,
One bows, one rises—
Without building dikes and defenses,
Over time, it becomes difficult to nurture."*

The *Scripture of the Arts* states: "Mercury is another name for the River Crone."

The cinnabar is the most precious essence within lead. To produce cinnabar-mercury is this true secret. That lead contains cinnabar-mercury is like a person possessing temperament and nature. Mercury is not an external thing to humanity. When cinnabar-mercury becomes lead, it is not a mixed category. The Dao of the Three-in-One refines temperament to unite with nature, and only then can one return to authenticity and restore the hexagrams.

The art of golden liquid nurtures water with metal, and only afterward can one revert to the origin and return to the primordial. If other substances are used, temperament and nature cannot unite. Thus, the *Cantong Qi* states: *"Names are used to stabilize temperament; words express the discourse of nature. When metal returns to its original state, it may be called the Returned Elixir."* It also says: *"Temperament governs the internal, establishing barriers and defenses. Nature manages the external, constantly fortifying the city walls."* From this, we know that mercury is the temperament and nature of lead. Primordial qi is the root of humanity. Metal governs the external, thus it is called nature. Mercury governs the internal, thus it is called temperament. Using metal to restrain mercury embodies the principle of uniting temperament with nature. This is the Dao of nurturing essence and spirit, refining nature to unite with the authentic.

It further states: *"The dragon exhales while the tiger inhales its essence; the two consume each other and both flourish."* This refers to the east, the Wood of Jia and Yi, called the Azure Dragon; and the west, the Metal of Geng and Xin, called the White Tiger. The dragon represents temperament, the tiger nature; temperament and nature depend on each other, embodying the principle of return. Another song says: *"Bind the body, gather the soul to sate the tiger’s hunger; the tiger comes to gaze and feed on the marrow of life."* Here, the marrow refers to the meridians. Thus, the meaning of exhalation and inhalation is clear.

Another song says: *"The flowing pearl of the Great Yang ever seeks to leave humanity. Suddenly, it obtains the golden flower, turns and intermingles, transforming into a white liquid, congealing into true hardness. The golden flower sings first; after a moment, it scatters and dissolves into water, like horse-teeth latticework. The Yang then proceeds in sequence, and temperament and nature become natural."* From this, we know that establishing Qian and Kun, circulating water and fire, responding to the celestial tally, and harmonizing the Three Powers—only then can cinnabar be formed.

Profound words reach far, yet the great Dao is most simple. Silver is the mother of teeth and the foundation of lead. If one knows the lineage and branches, its use will not err. Cinnabar becomes gold, and water-mercury becomes silver; once refined, they become authentic. Those who cultivate the elixir but do not comprehend the Three, the Five, and the One—only those who awaken will emerge from within Kan. A single life gives birth to male and female, both interdependent; transforming the Green Elder into golden essence, with no locks or barriers, the internal and external become one’s own divine chamber. Those who ingest it attain longevity and relieve poverty; transcendence is achieved within a thousand days.

Another song says:
*"White Horse Teeth, fine cinnabar,
Pair the two eights, harmonize the two families,
Know above and below, fiercely refine the Three Flowers—
Myriad lives are eternally preserved; do not boast, sir."*

Master Guigu’s *Song of the Nine Cycles of the Great Returned Elixir of Golden Liquid* states:
*"The immortal refines the elixir without herbs,
Only the divine chamber is made of metal.
Worldly people seek the Dao but know not its source,
Wasting gold and silver to build city walls.
For worldly people know not the elixir’s secret,"*
says Master Qingxia:
*"Do not squander wealth, do not impoverish your household.
Without the true oral transmission, the elixir cannot be completed.
Gold and silver are but dead matter in his hands,
Yet once dead, they can transform into living medicine.
Creation does not depart from mercury;
Essence and spirit congeal into the golden-flower medicine.
The medicine’s transformation does not leave the source of creation;
The Returned Elixir must be wrought by Yin and Yang.
Four liang and one jin unite as one body,
One Yin and one Yang paired in service.
Seventy-two days make one celestial cycle;
Once matured, it begins anew from Jia and Yi.
Ingest it to preserve years and attain longevity—
The true immortal’s wondrous secret is thus perfected."*

Another song says:
*"In my house are five things,
Three of which few know.
Originally one body,
Divided into five realms apart.
East: Jia and Yi, the Azure Dragon, elder brother;
West: Geng and Xin, the Metal Maiden, as his consort.
South: Bing and Ding, Fire, twin-born to unite the Two Modes.
North: Ren and Gui, Water, attaining the One and self-sustaining.
Center: Wu and Ji, Earth, cultivating the city to plant the treasure’s foundation.
Use fire with fire, let none know.
Water and fire do not obstruct each other—
All ruin stems from this.
One turn, two turns: the soul and spirit settle;
Three turns, four turns: half the term is fixed.
Five turns, six turns: the divine light flourishes;
Seven turns, eight turns: the immortal is pursued.
Nine turns: transcendence ascends to the Milky Way—
The work of creation is profound; doubt not."*

Minister Pei’s *Great Elixir Song*:
*"The great Dao leaves the elixir’s turtle,
Pure heart yearns for mist and clouds.
Yin and Yang complete creation,
Water and fire bind the river chariot.
Lead and mercury must return to Wu;
The furnace opens, the purple golden flower blooms.
The Flowery Pond is further refined,
Each divine water becomes a home.
The aspirant who obtains it must cherish it—
It stabilizes my nature and life, nurturing the divine chamber.
The inferior scholar hears and often scoffs in darkness;
The true person, upon hearing, calms soul and spirit.
Burning incense and paying homage, all affairs are complete—
All feel heaven and earth to become an immortal’s essence."*

Master Rong says: *"If one encounters the profound texts and secret transmissions of the supreme medicine, they must not be lightly transmitted. Light transmission brings calamity upon seven generations—all must be cautious."*

The *Great Elixir* concludes.
