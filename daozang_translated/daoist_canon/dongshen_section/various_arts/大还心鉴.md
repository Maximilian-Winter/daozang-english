**The Great Return: A Mirror of the Heart**

*Scripture Title:* *The Great Return: A Mirror of the Heart*. Composed by Han Shanzi, likely dating to the late Tang or Five Dynasties period. One fascicle.

**The Great Return: A Mirror of the Heart**

The *Ultimate Formula of Han Shanzi* states: If one awakens to the true lead, the medicine will naturally be divine; if one remembers the correct mercury, the medicine will surely be sacred. Cultivating this to perfection aligns with the sagely, and heaven and earth rejoice together. Attaining this depends on transmission from a master—this is the path of the Dao.

Thus, the sages of antiquity did not speak of it directly. Fearing that the foolish would take it lightly, they entrusted it to the *Book of Changes*, lodged it in the Five Phases, and aligned it with talismanic correspondences. Among the wondrous methods of harmonizing with the true, none surpasses the divine efficacy of the Great Elixir!

Generally, when foolish people hear of the Great Elixir, they harbor endless doubts. The wise, however, comprehend it and employ it with singular devotion. Thus, what is inherently secret becomes difficult, and the precious Dao must not be taken lightly.

In ancient times, the Three Sages bequeathed their words, inscribing them on golden tablets under the title *The Kinship of the Three*. Though the world transmits and copies it, scarcely one or two in a hundred awaken to its meaning. Those who grasp its principle dare not act rashly; those who clarify its practice still hesitate and procrastinate. Doubts arise in an instant and pass swiftly, while glory and splendor dazzle the eyes, gold and jade entangle the heart, wealth and sensuality occupy the mind—thus a hundred years are squandered in vain.

The Way of longevity rarely receives true attention. People do not realize that worldly desires exhaust the spirit and time erodes the years. For this reason, doubts multiply. Some perfected beings describe elixirs of varying degrees, yet fools immediately cite Qin Shihuang and Han Wudi. Qin Shihuang was insincere in word and deed, drowning in the sea of passions; Han Wudi, though he admired the mysterious realm, remained entangled in sensuality. How could they attain immortality and escape death? Why do they not speak of the Yellow Emperor and the ancients?

The Yellow Emperor transmitted the *Defense of the Mysterious Woman’s Returning Elixir*, teaching how to replenish gold and mercury in the cinnabar field. Later generations, failing to grasp the true essence, regrettably turned to the arts of bedroom practices. Yet the immortal maidens of Mount Tai surely had no intention of expounding on licentiousness—fools have been deluded by this for ten thousand generations. The songs and formulas are recorded in the *Discourse on the Golden Elixir*; those who obtain them may attain clarity.

In my early years, I admired the Dao and was fortunate to receive the true transmission. I reverently followed my immortal teacher and personally received his teachings. We spoke only of the wonders of lead and mercury, dragon and tiger, and how the true person avoids the grave errors of the Four Yellows and the adulterations of the Eight Stones. For lead and mercury embody the primordial order of heaven and earth, encapsulate the essence of the sun and moon, crown the Qian trigram above, and submit to the Kun trigram below. They govern the seventy-two minerals and command the radiant essence of heaven and earth. When refined into the elixir and ingested, they prolong life—how can this not be trusted?

Moreover, since the five grains can sustain life, how can one not revere the divine elixir? Even yellow essence, when consumed, bestows longevity, while *Gelsemium* leads to certain death—these truths are evident to the eye, and the true sages uphold them. Yet the divine elixir stands supreme among all methods. All this depends on a long-standing affinity with the wonders of the Dao and sustained devotion—not something achieved in a single day.

However, the numinous power of the returning elixir cannot avert calamities brought by self-inflicted harm. The compassionate methods of the sages cannot rescue one from the misfortunes of past karma. This also depends on one’s resolve to propagate the Dao’s principles. One must not lightly believe reckless claims, lest one be deluded by false arts!

Now, in *The Great Return: A Mirror of the Heart*, I illuminate the realm of the mind. When the mind is clear, the elixir becomes the supreme medicine. Do not be misled by other substances, for if they are not of the same kind, the elixir will not be efficacious. If the mind strays from the Dao, even if the elixir is formed, it will bring disaster. This is deeply worthy of caution and self-reflection in one’s cultivation.

The Great Elixir is none other than the Dao of the One Yin and One Yang—this is the mechanism of heaven and earth. One metal and one mineral together are called the elixir, for they unite heaven and earth. The first, true lead, is the White Tiger; the second, mercury, is the cinnabar-born quicksilver.

Master Tao Tan said: "If one uses worldly mercury, the quicksilver will turn to white smoke." This is a profound truth. The divine talisman and the wondrous White Snow—Master Ma said: "Mercury differs from quicksilver; the deluded use it clumsily." Understanding these words, one transforms from the mundane to the sacred. The sacred does not depart from the mundane; one enters the sacred through the mundane. Within the mundane lies the sacred, and from the sacred emerges the mundane. Thus, one knows that quicksilver originally resides in cinnabar, and life unites lead and mercury. When mercury becomes the supreme treasure, its color returns to the original elixir. If the elixir fails to form, it reverts to quicksilver—this is true mercury. Once true mercury is attained, one ascends from the mundane to the sacred, capable of commanding the myriad spirits. This is what Master Ma meant when he said, "Mercury differs from quicksilver." Yet since then, scholars have been few and ignorant, unable to reach this understanding!

Master Tao Tan also said that this is not the quicksilver of the world, and further stated that cinnabar is born of metal, and mercury arises from lead. This is not of the world—how can one not carefully examine its wondrous principles?

Since ancient times, true persons have all ascended from the mundane to the sacred, aligning with the Great Elixir to attain transcendence. Yet the deluded remain confused. The elixir consists of the One Yin and One Yang, the two substances of dragon and tiger. Lead is the name of the Water Phase, the Northern River Chariot. Metal is born of water; the number of metal is four, and the number of water is one—together they make five. Mercury is the Azure Dragon, the Wood Phase of the East. The number of wood is three; wood generates fire. Cinnabar is the essence of fire. Two and three together also make five. Five is earth, which has no fixed position but is named in the four seasons. Water and metal together make five; wood and fire together make five. Thus, it is said that the Way of the Three and Five returns the elixir. The mystery of the Dao and the wonder of the elixir are rarely understood by those with profound insight. Those who understand—are they not sages? Truly, with this, the workings of creation lie in one’s hands, and transformation becomes free and effortless.

Without the true oral transmission, even if one recites the authentic verses, lacking a master’s lineage, the wondrous principle remains forever elusive. I recall my past years of delusion—wandering mountains and rivers in vain, accomplishing nothing, squandering wealth and resources—until sudden awakening came like sobering from drunkenness.

The Way is near at hand, as close as the misty heavens; the great Dao is not distant. Yet people guard secrets, making the easy difficult, for they fear that if fools obtain them too readily, celestial reckoning will be disrupted and divine retribution will shorten their lives. Thus, the *True One’s Sincere Scripture* states: "Though all in the world seek long life, man’s fate is meager; gradually, the yin realm encroaches, until yin and yang bring death. How can the spirit of yang’s birth be guarded?"

If one does not cultivate in spring to nurture life, but instead harms others and seizes their possessions, how can one attain longevity? Even if one encounters a perfected being, if the Dao does not resonate between them, how could it be transmitted to the unworthy?

The *Ritual Codes* say: "Those who seek the returning elixir of long life and the completion of the great elixir cannot be ignorant of the crucible and furnace. Yet knowing the crucible and furnace, if one does not understand the firing times, one still does not know the heart-mind. Knowing the heart-mind, one must still guard against manifold obstacles and past karmic misfortunes. Even if one attains self-knowledge, one must not recklessly transmit it to others. If the Dao is not transmitted, it decays; if transmitted to the wrong person, calamity follows."

Thus, all wondrous mysteries do not depart from the heart-mind. The heart-mind is the origin of transcending the world; the elixir is the medicine of extended years. Ingesting it, one returns to the Yang Palace, and the registers of the Yin Bureau are struck from one’s name. Thereafter, even if one departs, one will achieve divine liberation and ascend as an immortal.

These are the words of true sages—unmistakable!

I have perused the true intentions of ancient worthies, from the *Can Tong Qi*, the *Golden Green Scripture*, and the *Ancient Text of the Dragon and Tiger*, which transmit the legacy of the Three Sages, along with the verses and oral instructions of the many perfected—none depart from the wondrous truth of lead and mercury. Fearing that later seekers may harbor unresolved doubts, I have further expounded upon them in this *Heart-Mirror*, desiring to illuminate the great Dao, radiate the true origin, and dispel the doubts of learners, that all may understand.

Fools, bewildered by the ramblings of madmen, awaken and receive the teaching—then the azure clouds become attainable, and the bright moon shines perpetually. Having set this forth, may those who are not deluded grow in number!

*The Great Returning Heart-Mirror* concludes.
