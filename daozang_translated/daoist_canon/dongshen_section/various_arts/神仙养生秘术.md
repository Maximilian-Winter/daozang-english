### **The Esoteric Arts of Immortal Nurturing and Longevity**
*Transmitted by the Mount Taibai Adept to Liu Jingxian, Yellow Gate Attendant of the Later Zhao; Collated by Baoyizi of the Song*

#### **1. Numinous Cinnabar (Lingsha)**
**Ingredients:**
- Seven *jin* of alumstone
- One *jin* of mercury
- Four *liang* of sulfur

**Method:**
First, melt the sulfur, then add the mercury and stir-fry until sandy. Cease firing.
Use either a Xiangyin jar, a Jiading jar from Western Shu, or an old wine jar of unglazed pottery. Seal with sweet clay to a thickness of three *cun* and dry in the shade. Place the mixture inside.
Take an iron lamp dish and set it over the jar’s mouth, ensuring the water within never dries. Seal the rim with sweet clay, leaving one vent hole. Thread an iron wire through the lamp dish and jar handles, then place in the furnace.
Use 120 *jin* of charcoal. Begin firing at dawn and cease the next dawn. Remove at midday, break the jar, and retrieve the product. To refine it into *Heart Red*, grind to a fine powder. For *Numinous Cinnabar*, further methods apply.

#### **2. Heart Red (Xinhong)**
**Ingredients:**
- One *jin* of mercury
- Four *liang* of sulfur

**Method:**
First, melt the sulfur, then add the mercury. Use either a Xiangyin jar, a Jiading jar from Western Shu, or an old wine jar of unglazed pottery. Seal with sweet clay to a thickness of three *cun* and dry in the shade. Place the mixture inside.
Set an iron lamp dish over the jar’s mouth, ensuring the water within never dries. Seal the rim with sweet clay, leaving one vent hole. Thread an iron wire through the lamp dish and jar handles, then place in the furnace.
Use 120 *jin* of charcoal. Begin firing at dawn and cease the next dawn. Remove at midday, allow to cool, then break the jar. Discard the kernels, grind to a fine powder, and mix with five buckets of water in a vat or basin. Grind again.
At the *you* hour, let the mixture settle in the vat. The top layer is *Board Red*, the middle *Secondary Red*, and the bottom *Heart Red*. Cut with a knife, dry in sunlight, wrap in silver paper, and further encase in paper.

#### **3. Dead Mercury (Sigong)**
**Ingredients:**
- One *jin* of mercury
- One *jin* of black tin
- One *jin* of *shanze* (realgar or orpiment)

**Method:**
Fashion two boxes: one from black tin, the other from *shanze*. First, place the mercury in the *shanze* box and seal it airtight.
Place the *shanze* box inside the tin box, then set both in an iron cauldron. Seal the cauldron’s mouth firmly with red halloysite and raw honey. Bind top and bottom with iron wire, then place in a quiet chamber within the elixir workshop.
Use 250 *jin* of charcoal. Begin firing at the *xu* hour (7–9 PM) and cease at the *mao* hour (5–7 AM) the next day. Open the cauldron to find neither black tin nor mercury remaining. The two *jin* of *shanze* may be used freely—this is a secret transmission.

#### **4. Whitening (Dianbai)**
**Ingredients (each processed separately):**
- Four *liang* of roasted cinnabar
- Four *liang* of chalcanthite
- Four *liang* of realgar
- Four *liang* of orpiment
- Four *liang* of nitre
- Four *liang* of calcined alum
- Four *liang* of *shanze*
- Four *liang* of green salt

**Method:**
Grind all into fine powders and store in a sealed container. Mix one *sheng* of the powders with camphorwood root, salt, wine, and vinegar.
Take a crucible and place four *liang* of Yunnan copper inside. Heat in the furnace with a bellows, covering with a tile until molten. Add two *qian* of *xiusha* (purified cinnabar) and stir evenly. Then add two *liang* of the prepared medicine and one *liang* of *shanze*. Stir thoroughly, cease firing, and pour into a smooth pool to cool. The result is a supreme treasure, malleable for any use.

#### **5. Hair Removal (Bamao)**
**Ingredients (each processed separately):**
- One *liang* of *shanze*
- One *liang* of white alum
- One *liang* of roasted cinnabar
- One *liang* of mercury
- One *liang* of white iron
- One *liang* of chalcanthite
- One *liang* of nitre

**Method:**
Grind all into fine powders. Take a crucible and place half a *jin* of copper inside. Refine three times until it turns peach-blossom red.
In another crucible, place two *liang* of copper. Heat in the furnace with charcoal and a bellows, covering with a tile. Add five *qian* of *shanze* and half a *qian* of *xiusha*, then mix in two and a half *qian* of the prepared medicine. Cease firing, pour into a smooth pool, and repeat the process three times. Return to the crucible to melt into a supreme treasure, usable for fine softness or crafting vessels—this is a secret formula.

#### **6. Shrinking (Suohe)**
**Method:**
Cast ten *jin* of white tin into plaques, each one *cun* wide and three *cun* long, with a hole at the top. Thread an iron rod through the plaques and suspend them in a pool without touching the bottom.
After twenty-one days (three seven-day cycles), remove the plaques and melt them in an iron pot. Recast into plaques.
After eighty-one days, remove, melt, and recast.
After one hundred fifty days, remove, melt, and recast.
After three hundred days, remove, melt, and recast.
After six hundred days, the fire-taming is complete. Further hammering refines the metal into vessels.
For fine softness, extend to twelve hundred days to achieve a supreme treasure that remains unchanged for a thousand years—this is a secret transmission.

#### **7. Constructing the Pool (Zuochi)**
**Method:**
Dig a pool two *zhang* square and seven *chi* deep. Line with bricks, sealing the seams with hemp and lime mortar. Cover the pool with a latrine, filling it with five *chi* of human waste. Exercise utmost care during construction.
Offer paper money and horses as sacrifices, ensuring no one learns of the work. Revealing this celestial mechanism to the unworthy is forbidden.

#### **8. Producing Verdigris (Poliutonglü)**
**Method:**
Cast ten *jin* of copper into plates. Prepare an iron pot, one *tan* of pure vinegar, and one *jin* of *xiushā* (sal ammoniac). Mix the *xiushā* with the vinegar, then heat and simmer over a constant flame. Continuously pour the medicated vinegar over the plates. After two *shichen* (four hours), cease and scrape off the verdigris before pouring again. If the plate thins to three-tenths of its original thickness, discard it. Settle the verdigris, dry it thoroughly, and use as desired.

#### **9. Crafting Thread Tips (Zuoxiantou)**
**Method:**
Take one kneecap bone from a yellow ox and carve it into beads the size of peas. Drill holes through them. Prepare over one hundred sheets of silver foil and one *qian* of *jinjiaoxin* (gold-based alum). Grind these finely in a mortar, then hold glue water in the mouth and gradually spit it into a bowl. Grind the mixture once, then rinse with clear water—repeat this process seven times. Take a thread, tie a knot at one end, and thread a bead onto it. Use a new brush to apply the foil onto the bead, then press it firmly with cold cotton. If a radiant sheen appears, the process is complete. If the color is too pale, repeat the application. The bead must not fade when tested. Use as desired. This is a secret transmission—do not reveal it to the unworthy. Regardless of size, craft as needed.

Use four *liang* of litharge and two *liang* of saltpeter to make a crucible. In spring and summer, wait three days; in autumn and winter, seven days. Mix the sand with the crucible ingredients, then spread the mixture on a large iron plate. Cover with a clay basin, seal the edges with honey-mixed red halloysite, and heat with charcoal fire (moderate intensity). Start the fire in the morning and stop at noon. Once cooled, open the basin—the medicine will be on the inner surface. Scrape it off and store in a wooden box, four *liang* per container, for use as desired. The residue at the bottom is *frost powder*, and the upper layer is *light powder*—this is a profound and secret method.

Grind into powder. Next, melt the silver, add *quesha* and *pengsha*, and grind into fine powder while hot. Grind the dried alum, chalcanthite, and deer antler ash into fine powder. Combine all eight ingredients and grind again into a fine powder. To use, first wash the copper vessel three times with gleditsia water, then rub it with leaves. Seal with paper for seven days per application, repeating three times for best results—this is a wondrous and secret method. Do not reveal to others.

**Sacred Wax Candle Method**

**Sacred Wax Candle Method**
Four *liang* each of *baijiaoxiang* (resin), sulfur, and sophora fruit (collected in the eighth month). First, pound the sophora fruit into a paste. Melt the *baijiaoxiang* and sulfur together, then pour the mixture into a bamboo tube seven *cun* in length. One candle will burn for a full month—divinely wondrous.

**Oil-Saving Formula**
Collect duckweed in the sixth month, and *wasong* (houseleek) in the sixth month. One *liang* each of *yuanzhi* (polygala root), *huangdan* (lead oxide), and clam powder. Grind all into a fine powder. For every *liang* of oil, use one *qian* of the powder—it will last a month.

**Sacred Wax Candle Method (Alternate)**

Melt the *baijiaoxiang* in a sand pot, then add the sophora fruit and simmer until thick. Next, add the sulfur and stir evenly with a sophora twig. Pour into a bamboo tube seven *cun* long and as thick as a thumb. Dry in the shade, then remove the tube. Each candle will burn for sixty days—marvelous.

**Ink-Making Method**
Ten *liang* of pine soot, four *liang* of *ejiao* (ass hide glue). Simmer *leihua* (thunderbolt flower), *gansong* (spikenard), ginger juice, and gleditsia (for tooth-cleaning) briefly in water, then strain. Dissolve four *liang* of *ejiao* in the liquid. Add three gold foils and two silver foils, then mix with the pine soot. Pound with a pestle ten thousand times, then mold into ink sticks. Place in an ash pit: five days in spring, three in summer, seven in autumn, and ten in winter. Remove when ready for use.

**Dead Honey Method**
Take one *jin* of white rock honey and an iron pot with original oil residue. Place the honey in the pot, then stir with ten stalks of aged scallions until cooked. Remove the scallions, add ten fresh stalks, and stir evenly over gentle heat. Test by dripping into water—if it holds shape, does not stick to teeth or hands, it is perfected, a treasure for transforming body and bone. After refining, blend with fine medicinal powders to achieve a golden hue. Use the inner white layer of horsehide (one and a half *liang*), mulberry flowers, gleditsia flowers, sophora flowers, *baimendong* (asparagus root), scallion flowers, *tusizi* (dodder seeds), winter-sweet flowers, *mimeng* (buddleia flowers), and chrysanthemum flowers (one and a half *liang* each). Grind into a fine powder and mix evenly. For every *jin* of honey, use one and a half *liang* of the powder. Stir well, then pour into cold water to form blocks. This is the secret method for dead honey—a divine formula for any use.

**Hundred-Flower Paste**
*Mimeng* (buddleia), licorice, trichosanthes root, *xuanhu* (corydalis), mulberry yellow, and white lime (in equal parts). For one *jin* of flowers, use two *liang* of the powder—superior to burning gold or silver. Grind all into a fine powder and mix. Melt the flowers in a copper pan, then add the powder and stir evenly. Strain through raw silk into water, then shape into blocks for use.

**Wondrous Spirit Elixir**
Eat the leaves of the *qiao* tree to remain full and hunger-free, evading hardship and fasting. One *jin* of *duzhong* (eucommia bark), remove the coarse skin, soak in vinegar overnight, dry, stir-fry, and grind into fine powder. One *jin* of *jingjiesui* (schizonepeta spikes), grind into fine powder. One *jin* of *baifuling* (white poria), remove the skin. One *jin* of licorice, remove the skin. Half a *jin* of mint. Grind all into fine powder, then form into pills with refined honey, each the size of a little finger. Wash *qiao* leaves clean, chew with the pills for best effect.

**Life-Preserving Elixir for Fasting and Evading Hardship**
*Muxiang* (costus root), *baifuling* (white poria), *chishizhi* (halloysite), frankincense, mercury. Combine black tin with mercury to form pellets, then grind finely in a ceramic vessel. One *qian* each of cinnabar, realgar, and *mituoseng* (litharge). Six *qian* of yellow wax, three *qian* of pine resin. Grind all nine ingredients into fine powder, then melt the pine resin and yellow wax to form pills, each weighing one *qian*. When taking the elixir, first eat a full meal of glutinous rice porridge, then swallow one pill with frankincense tea. After five to seven days, take another pill. After two doses, eat seven jujubes on the first day, then consume them daily until finished—hunger will vanish, and thirst may be quenched with water.

**Water-Sipping Method**
The Thunderbolt Fire Lord advises: Focus on the sun, draw in black qi, and blow it into water before drinking. After fasting, the mind becomes clear and thoughts still—no distractions enter or leave. Once, the imperial physician Yan Zhongshan, fleeing danger in Tangzhou on the third day of the seventh month in the *guisi* year, survived without food until death seemed certain. After taking the elixir, his entire family fasted for forty-nine days, yet remained safe and restored to health.

**Immortal Wine Formula**
Use one *sheng* and eleven *ge* of glutinous rice (or other suitable grain), four *liang* of fine yeast, one and a half *liang* of malted barley, and two *liang* of leaven. Grind into fine powder, then cook five *sheng* of water into porridge. Add the powdered ingredients, stir evenly, and let the wine ferment—its fragrance will be divine, and the method infallible.

**Dry Wine Formula**
One *liang* each of cinnamon and black aconite, one *liang* of fine honey, one *liang* of Sichuan pepper, two *liang* of fresh ginger, two *liang* of apricot kernels (peeled and mashed), and one *jin* of divine yeast. Grind into fine powder. Wash two *sheng* of millet, steam until cooked, then mix with the powdered medicine. Place in a jar for three nights, then pound into pills the size of chicken heads. Store in a jar, seal with paper to prevent air exposure. After seven days, expose to wind for one *shichen* (two hours), then return to the jar and reseal. This wine may be stored indefinitely. To drink, steep one pill in five *sheng* of hot water, seal with damp paper, and soon the fragrance of wine will arise—fit for offering to the gods.

**Daoist Immortal’s Method for Consuming Fresh Rehmannia to Prolong Life**
Take an unspecified quantity of fresh rehmannia, selecting plump roots. Dry in the shade, grind into fine powder, and blend with refined honey to form pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take thirty pills each time, washed down with hot water or wine. After thirty-nine days of taking three doses daily, the complexion will bloom like peach blossoms. After three years, one attains longevity.

**Daoist Immortal’s Method for Consuming *Xianhua* for Longevity**
Gather one *dan* of *xianhua* when ripe in the seventh or eighth month. Dry in the sun, then pound in a mortar to remove thorns before grinding into fine powder. Take two spoonfuls each time, mixed with fresh water, three times daily without interruption. This grants immortality.
After one year of consumption, one will no longer feel cold in winter or heat in summer.
After two years, the old revert to youth, white hair turns black again, and fallen teeth regrow.
After three years, the body becomes light, and life is prolonged.

**Grain-Abstention Formula**
Stir-fry four *sheng* of black soybeans to remove their skins. Boil four *sheng* of hemp seeds, then pound into powder. Take one *ge* each time, mixed with water, three times daily. After ten days, one may cease eating grains, and neither cold nor heat will affect the body in winter or summer.

**Daoist Immortal’s Method for Consuming Sophora Seeds to Prolong Life and Prevent Aging**
On the *shangsi* day of the tenth month, gather sophora seeds and store them in a new earthenware vessel. Cover with a basin, seal tightly with mud to prevent qi from escaping, and open after twenty-one days. Remove the skins, then begin consumption on the first day of the lunar month with one seed, taken with water. Increase by one seed each day until the fifteenth, then decrease by one seed daily. Repeat this cycle without end. This enables one to read by night and, with prolonged use, multiplies strength a hundredfold.

**Grain-Abstention and Fasting Formula (First Calm the Mind)**
Stir-fry one *dou* of glutinous millet with six *liang* of sesame oil until cool. Add equal parts—ten *liang* each—of salt, Sichuan ginger, and Sichuan pepper, along with three *sheng* of turnip seeds and five *sheng* of dried jujubes. Grind all into fine powder. Take one large spoonful each time, mixed with fresh water, three times daily. As hunger and thirst subside, strength will gradually return. One may freely consume fruits, nuts, teas, and broths as desired, but meat is strictly forbidden. Avoid:
- Horses that died from exhaustion,
- Donkeys killed by drowning,
- Cattle that died from bloating,
- Sheep with red eyes,
- Pigs that died of illness,
- Soft-shelled turtles with pellets,
- Pregnant hares,
- Fish without scales.
As the ancient texts warn, consuming these will invite a hundred ailments.

**Grain-Avoidance Formula**

Presented on the seventeenth day of the second month of the second year of Yongning, by the Gentleman-in-Attendance at the Yellow Gate, Liu Jingxian:

*"I encountered a recluse of Mount Taibai, from whom I obtained this formula. Hearing that grain prices in the capital have soared, I submit this to provide relief, for it allows one to go without hunger, sharpens the senses, and imparts a radiant complexion. Should this prove false, my entire household willingly accepts execution."*

**Ingredients and Preparation:**
For all seasons, take five *sheng* of black soybeans. Wash thoroughly, steam three times, sun-dry, and remove the skins. Additionally, take three *sheng* of hemp seeds. Soak overnight in hot water, drain, sun-dry, then coat with sticky water, dry again, remove the skins, wash clean, and steam three times. Pound firmly.

Next, combine with the soybean powder and grind into a fine flour. Mix with glutinous rice porridge to form balls the size of a fist. Place in a steamer with rice, cook from nightfall until midnight, then cease heating. Remove at dawn and store in a ceramic vessel, sealed to prevent drying from wind.

**Dosage:**
Consume three balls at a time, until sated. Refrain from all other food.
- After the first dose: seven days without hunger.
- After the second dose: forty-nine days without hunger.
- After the third dose: three hundred days without hunger.
One’s appearance will grow more refined, never wan or haggard.

For thirst, grind hemp seeds into a pulp and drink. This further nourishes the viscera.

Should one wish to resume eating, crush three *ge* of mallow seeds, decoct in water, and drink to open and guide the stomach, awaiting the return of harmonious qi without harm.

This formula was engraved in stone at Taiping Xingguo Temple in Bieshan, Hanyang Prefecture.

**Here ends the secret Daoist art of nourishing life.**
