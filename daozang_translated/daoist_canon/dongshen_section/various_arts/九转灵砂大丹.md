**Nine-Turned Numinous Cinnabar Grand Elixir**

**Method for Stir-Frying Numinous Cinnabar**
Take one *jin* of mercury and four *liang* of sulfur. Use a new iron wok, washed clean with water. Prepare a brazier with three small bricks to support the wok. Heat the wok’s base with a small charcoal fire, then rub it with yellow wax to lubricate. Heat an iron spatula and rub it with wax as well. First melt the sulfur into a liquid, then add the mercury. Two people should sit facing each other, gripping the wok’s edges, and stir continuously with the iron spatula. If yellow smoke rises, sprinkle rice vinegar to suppress it, then resume stirring. Once congealed, remove and pound with a willow-wood mallet, or grind in a mill until fine. Return to the wok and stir-fry until it turns the color of green brick. Stir-fry for approximately three *shi* (six hours) until thoroughly cooked and the cinnabar becomes firm. Remove, grind finely, and sift through a sieve—this is called "Verdant Gold Head Powder."

**Method for Constructing the Furnace**
On an auspicious *yang* day, use over ten clay bricks to build a furnace, two *chi* high, round above and square below, with a wooden base. The furnace should hold about five *jin* of charcoal. The interior height should be one *chi* and five *cun*, with seven iron rods placed below as a grate. The grate should be five *cun* above the wind door, which is sealed with mud and left to dry before use.

**Method for Casting the Cauldron**
Use raw iron to forge a Water-Fire Cauldron, with a total height of one *chi* and two *cun*. The Fire Cauldron should be eight *cun* high, with an inner mouth diameter of five *cun* and an outer rim spanning one *chi*. The base of the Fire Cauldron should be five *fen* thick. The Water Cauldron should be four *cun* high, with a base two *fen* thick. Cast the Water-Fire Cauldron in a smelting furnace, ensuring the joint of the inner mouth fits tightly.

**Method for Ascending the Cinnabar**
First, place a large pot with yellow clay and water, then set the Water-Fire Cauldron inside and boil for approximately three *shi*. Remove, wash clean, and dry. Grind ink with rice vinegar and use a brush to coat the interior of the Fire Cauldron and the base of the Water Cauldron. Then, burn *shi hu* (dendrobium) and mugwort leaves to fumigate, dispelling the iron’s *qi*. Once cool, place the cauldron steadily. Gently scoop the previously prepared Verdant Gold Head Powder into the Fire Cauldron, leaving space—about three fingers’ width from the base of the Water Cauldron. Seal the inner mouth with red halloysite mixed with vinegar, place the Water Cauldron on top, and press firmly. Thread iron wire through the upper and lower holes of the Water-Fire Cauldron and bind tightly. Seal the outer joint with Six-*Yi* Salt Mud, one *cun* thick. Fashion a hook from sturdy iron wire, one *chi* and five *cun* long, and attach it to the hole in the Fire Cauldron’s rim. Secure with a hemp rope and suspend the cauldron over the furnace. Arrange five *jin* of hard charcoal blocks inside the furnace, with four *liang* of kindling below. On an auspicious morning, light the fire and fan the wind door. Begin with gentle heat, then increase to strong. If the charcoal softens, add one or two *jin*. Fill the Water Cauldron eight-tenths with warm water, and as it boils, frequently replenish with cool water to prevent overflow. Gradually lower the cauldron closer to the fire until the charcoal is fully consumed—this takes about half a day. After cooling overnight, remove the cauldron, scrape off the mud, and open it. The numinous cinnabar will have ascended to the base of the Water Cauldron; remove and wrap it.

**Method for Steeping the Cinnabar**
Take one or two *jin* of numinous cinnabar and break it into pieces the size of large soybeans. Sew a long bag from fine, clean hemp cloth. Place the cinnabar inside, tie the bag’s mouth securely, and do not disturb it. Use a large porcelain jar capable of holding five *sheng* of liquid. Burn an unspecified amount of mulberry wood in a clean place to make ash, and let it cool. Measure one *dou* of ash, line the bottom of a sieve with a layer of summer cloth, and place the ash on top. First, pour boiling water to moisten the ash. For every *dou* of ash, use two *dou* of cold water, gradually pouring it into the sieve to leach the liquid. It is better for the liquid to be slightly scant and thick. Pour the liquid into the jar, place it in a brazier, and simmer with charcoal fire. Suspend the bag of cinnabar in the center of the jar—this is called "suspended gestation." Simmer gently until the liquid bubbles like crab eyes, and steep for seven full *fu* days. Bring to a boil two or three more times, then remove and dry in the sun. This is called the "confinement method."

**Method for Making Silver Beads**
Take approximately twenty *liang* of refined silver and further refine it with black lead ash until completely pure. Place it in a crucible and melt into a liquid. Bundle fresh bamboo tips with leaves into a mat and lay it horizontally in a large porcelain vat. Carefully pour the silver liquid onto the mat, stirring rapidly—the silver will form millet-sized beads. If any are too large, remelt and pour again, selecting only the finest beads.

**First-Turn Primary Elixir Method**
Cast a box from raw iron, or forge one from wrought iron. Each box should hold about twenty *liang* of silver beads. First, mix white kaolin with rice vinegar and coat the inside of the box to a thickness of one *fen*. Let it dry in the sun. Then, take one *jin* of the previously prepared beads and four *liang* of steeped numinous cinnabar, using a ratio of four to one. Layer them like planting lotus seeds until the box is full. Cover with Kunlun paper. If the box’s top is not full, fill it with dry, crushed yellow earth. Seal the inner mouth with red halloysite mixed with vinegar, and bind it crosswise with iron wire. Coat the outside of the box with paper fiber and numinous mud to a thickness of half a finger. Let it dry in the sun, then place it in an ash jar to nurture the fire. Use a small-mouthed jar capable of holding nine *dou* of ash.

First, line the bottom of the jar with yellow earth to a thickness of three *cun*. Place a small three-legged iron stand, five *cun* in height, with its legs facing upward. Position the elixir box atop the stand, ensuring it does not tilt, and bury it in paper-money ash. Then, use a larger iron stand to enclose the smaller one, weaving an iron-wire mesh above it to create a grid. This grid should be one finger’s width above the elixir box. Place the fire above the grid, then cover it with five *cun* of ash. Adjust the fire at *mao* and *you* hours, nurturing it for two seven-day periods. The fire grades—two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight—should all use paired measures. Once the time is complete, let it cool thoroughly before opening the box. The cinnabar will resemble newly forged iron in color. Split a piece with a knife; if no red hue remains within, the elixir is ripe. If any redness persists, the fire was unevenly applied—do not disturb it. Reseal and nurture it again for three seven-day periods, increasing the fire slightly beyond the previous intensity. It will surely succeed. Separate the silver beads.

To refine this cinnabar into treasure, take one *liang* of cinnabar and one *liang* of black lead, and smelt them together in an ash crucible. Each *liang* of cinnabar will yield eight *qian* of pure silver. Treasure it for further transmutation.

**Second Transmutation: True Yang Elixir Method**
Use sixteen *liang* of the initial true elixir as the matrix. Prepare one *jin* of numinous cinnabar by boiling it in mulberry sap, then take four *liang* of it. Layer it with the elixir matrix in the box, following the lotus-seeding method, in a four-to-one ratio. Seal as before, dry in the sun, and place it atop the three-legged stand in the ash jar. Enclose it as previously described, apply fire, and adjust at *mao* and *you* hours for one seven-day period. The fire grades—two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight—should all use paired measures. Once the time is complete, let it cool, then open the box. The new cinnabar will match the elixir matrix. Separate the new cinnabar and set it aside. Take another four *liang* of the boiled cinnabar, layer it with the matrix as before, seal, and nurture it in the jar. Repeat this four times to obtain one *jin* of new cinnabar. To test its maturity, smelt it with black lead as before; each *liang* of cinnabar will yield eight *qian* of silver. If not smelted, reserve it as a matrix for further transmutations, or use the old matrix as desired.

**Third Transmutation: Absolute True Elixir Method**
Use sixteen *liang* of the True Yang Elixir as the matrix. Take twelve *liang* of unboiled numinous cinnabar and four *liang* of transparent cinnabar, place them together in a hemp cloth bag, and boil them in a jar of mulberry-ash sap for seven seven-day periods. Once the time is complete, remove and bring to a boil, then dry in the sun. Grind them finely and sift through a silk sieve. Mix with Jade Maiden’s nectar (the sap of the paper mulberry) to form a paste. Press firmly, dry in the sun, and chisel into pieces the size of large soybeans. First, take four *qian* of chalcanthite and one *qian* of sulfur, grind them finely, and stir-fry in a pan until they turn purple. Grind into a fine powder, then dip each piece of cinnabar in matured rice vinegar and roll it in the chalcanthite-sulfur powder—this is called the "body-adhering medicine." Layer it with the elixir matrix in a four-to-one ratio, seal the box, and place it atop the three-legged stand in the ash jar. Enclose as before, apply fire, and adjust at *mao* and *you* hours for two seven-day periods. The fire grades—two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight—should all use paired measures. Once the time is complete, let it cool, then open the box. The cinnabar will again resemble newly forged iron. Separate the mother and child elixirs alike. Repeat this four times to gather one *jin* of new cinnabar. To refine it into treasure, test it as before with the old mother elixir, and use it as desired.

**Fourth Transmutation: Wondrous Numinous Elixir Method**
Take sixteen *liang* of the Absolute True Elixir and crush it. Clean a porcelain box and spread the crushed cinnabar inside. Add one *liang* of closed-mouth Sichuan peppercorns and three bowls of water to a porcelain vessel, boiling until two bowls remain. Strain thoroughly, then pour in four *liang* of mercury and boil for about one hour. Remove and quickly pour off the pepper-infused water, letting it dry. While the mercury is still hot, pour it into the cinnabar in the box. Seal the box’s opening with vinegar-mixed red halloysite, bind it with iron wire, and reinforce the exterior with paper fiber and numinous mud. Dry in the sun, then place a water-boiling jar beneath the box, filled with five *sheng* of water, its mouth level with the box’s base. Fill the jar seven-tenths with boiling water, place the elixir box atop it, and seal the joint with salt mud. Do not use the three-legged stand. Bury it in the ash jar, enclose it, and nurture for three seven-day periods, adjusting the fire at *mao* and *you* hours with five or six paired measures. Once the time is complete, let the furnace cool, open the box, and observe that the mercury has vanished. Weigh the cinnabar—it will retain its original weight. Do not disturb it; instead, boil another four *liang* of mercury as before and pour it into the cinnabar in the box. Seal the opening, reinforce as before, dry in the sun, and refill the water jar seven-tenths with boiling water. Place the elixir box atop it, seal the joint, and return it to the ash jar. Apply fire as before, adjusting at *mao* and *you* hours for three seven-day periods. Once cooled, open the box to find faint crystalline peaks. Weigh the cinnabar—it will still retain its weight. Repeat this four times, adding a total of one *jin* of mercury. Then, cease further additions. Seal as before, fill the water jar to the brim, place the elixir box atop it, and seal the opening without adding more mercury. Nurture it for five seven-day periods, adjusting the fire at *mao* and *you* hours with four, five, six, seven, or eight paired measures. Once the time is complete, let it cool, open the box, and behold the elixir surging upward like a forest of jade trees. Only then may you harvest the white sprouts—this process of pouring and harvesting is inexhaustible.

**Fifth Transmutation: Water Immortal Elixir Method**
Take one *jin* of elixir sprouts from the Wondrous Numinous Elixir, ensuring they are pure and free of impurities. Spread them in a clean porcelain box, then pour in half a *jin* of fine mercury pearls directly into the sprouts.

Seal the opening as before, bind it securely, and place a water jar beneath the box, sealing it likewise. Set it in an ash jar without a cover, with fire on all four sides. Nurture it for five seven-day periods, adjusting the fire at *mao* and *you* hours with two, three, four, five, six, seven, or eight paired measures. Once the time is complete, let it cool, open the box, and behold the elixir surging upward like peaks and ridges. Do not disturb it; pour mercury as before and nurture it again in the sealed manner. When the box is full, trim the excess and divide it.

If you wish to refine it into treasure, boil it with river water and a small amount of frankincense for one seven-day period, then place it in a crucible to melt into a supreme treasure, ready for use. From this point onward, lead smelting is no longer required, for the elixir transforms into treasure of its own essence.

**Sixth Transmutation: Penetrating the Mysterious Elixir Method**
Take four *liang* of Water Immortal Elixir. Boil it as before with river water and frankincense, then melt it into treasure. Forge a chamber, using three *liang* for the base and one *liang* for the lid. Seal the seams tightly, ensuring it is just large enough to hold the ingredients. Use one *liang* each of refined *cizhu* (female cinnabar) and *xiongwei* (male cinnabar), along with one *liang* each of high-quality yellow and purple *pao* (processed minerals). Grind them finely together and place them in the chamber. Seal the opening with vinegar-mixed red halloysite, then set the chamber in the center of a porcelain box. Spread Water Immortal Elixir sprouts over it, seal the porcelain box’s opening, and bind it securely without external sealing. Place it on a tripod in an ash jar, bury it in ash, and cover it. Apply fire from above, adjusting at *mao* and *you* hours for three seven-day periods, using two, three, four, five, six, seven, or eight paired measures. Once the time is complete, let it cool, open the box, and remove the covering. The chamber and its contents will be uniformly purple-red, like the Three Yellows. Test a small piece of the yellow elixir on silver until it turns pure red. If the top is red but the bottom pale, the elixir is not yet ripe. Only when it is red through to the bottom is it ready for transmutation; reserve some for further refinement.

**Seventh Transmutation: Treasure Spirit Elixir Method**
Take six *liang* of unboiled cinnabar and two *liang* of raw realgar. Use four *liang* of the previously nurtured Three Yellows, reserving one *liang* for the surface. Grind them together and place them in a porcelain box, leaving one *liang* of elixir to grind finely and spread on top. Seal the opening with vinegar-mixed red halloysite, bind the box with iron wire in a cross pattern, and further secure it with paper fiber and numinous clay. Let it dry in the sun, then place it on a tripod in an ash jar, bury it in ash, and cover it. Apply fire from above for five seven-day periods, adjusting at *mao* and *you* hours with two, three, four, five, six, seven, or eight paired measures. Once the time is complete, add three *jin* of fire on all four sides to refine it. Let it cool, then test it: place five *liang* of mercury in a *jian* bowl, sprinkle one *qian* of elixir powder over it, and apply gentle heat to the mercury. Cover the bowl tightly, seal the opening with vinegar-soaked paper, and wait until the sound ceases. Remove the cover to find the mercury transformed into a purple treasure. Melt it in a crucible to form golden treasure. Reserve some for further refinement; the rest may be used as before.

**Eighth Transmutation: Spirit Treasure Elixir Method**
Take seven *liang* of Treasure Spirit Elixir, reserving two *liang* to coat the surface. Use five *liang* of cinnabar refined from balanced sulfur and mercury, along with one *liang* each of female and male sulfur pearls. Grind them finely and place them in the box, reserving two *liang* of elixir to grind finely and spread on top. Seal it, let it dry in the sun, and place it on a tripod in an ash jar. Adjust the fire at *mao* and *you* hours for seven seven-day periods, using two, three, four, five, six, seven, or eight paired measures. Once the time is complete, let it cool and open the box to find the elixir fused into a single mass, its purple hue dazzling to the eye and radiant with beauty. It may be used to cultivate golden sprouts or for further transmutation; reserve some for the great elixir.

**Ninth Transmutation: Ascending to Perfection Elixir Method**
Take sixty *liang* of Spirit Treasure Elixir and thirty *liang* of Two-Eight Cinnabar. Grind them together and mix with donkey’s milk to form a paste. Then take two *jin* of golden sprouts, melt them into treasure, and forge a golden spirit chamber. Fill it completely with the elixir mixture. Seal the opening with vinegar-mixed red halloysite. Cast a copper box slightly larger than the chamber, leaving a finger’s width of space on all sides. Use lead dan and alum, each prepared separately in a vessel with five *jin* of charcoal fire, then grind them into fine powder. Spread this evenly over the chamber to seal it. Next, seal the copper box without external binding and place it in an ash pit.

Choose an auspicious altar site according to the proper directions, and select an auspicious day and hour to begin the firing. Adjust the fire at *mao* and *you* hours for seven seven-day periods, using the same fire measures as before. Once the time is complete, add three *jin* of fire on all four sides to refine it. When the fire has fully subsided, remove the box, discard the copper outer layer, and place the golden sprout elixir chamber in the center of the altar. Dig a pit five *chi* deep and bury it for fifty days. Retrieve it, wrap it in three to five layers of oiled paper, then three to five layers of cloth, and bind it with hemp rope. Suspend it in a well for fifty days until it reaches the bottom. Remove it, grind it into fine powder, and mix it with the natural juice of Solomon’s seal or Jade Maiden’s essence to form pills the size of chicken’s heads. Let them dry, then place them back in the golden chamber, seal the opening, and set it on a tripod in an ash jar. Apply fire for one seven-day period, adjusting at *mao* and *you* hours with two, three, four, five, six, seven, or eight paired measures. Once the time is complete, let it cool and test a pill by dropping it into cold water—the water should roil like boiling liquid. Place one *jin* of mercury in a *jian* bowl, add one pill, and cover the bowl tightly. Seal the opening with vinegar-soaked paper, apply gentle heat to the mercury, and wait until the sound ceases like autumn cicadas. Remove the cover to find the mercury transformed into a superior purple treasure. When melted, its purple luster will dazzle the eyes—this is the sign of elixir completion.

Prepare an offering of the elixir and present it to the Supreme Emperor. Await a response, then take three pills with well water. First, place a water jar nearby, then enter the jar. Have fellow Daoists guard you from outside until the water grows warm, then emerge.

Enter a second water jar, then a third, and you will feel your body grow light and your spirit transformed. The next day, proceed as before. Repeat this three times, through nine jars of water, swallowing nine pills in total. Naturally, your body will radiate light, and you will see cloud chariots descend to welcome you, as if ascending in a carriage of clouds and rosy dawn.

**The Pouring and Drenching Method**
Prepare a well-fitted ceramic box. Take one *jin* of the initial true elixir, and first use flowing water in a ceramic vessel to bathe it over a slow fire for one hour, allowing it to simmer gently before removing and drying in the sun. Spread it in the box. Then take one *liang* of Sichuan peppercorns—selecting only the tightly closed ones—and place them in a ceramic bottle with three bowls of pure water. Boil down to two bowls, then strain out the dregs. Add four *liang* of mercury, boil again for one hour, then quickly remove the pepper-infused water and wipe the mercury dry with paper. While still hot, pour the mercury into the box with the elixir, cover tightly with Kunlun paper, and fill the remaining space with clay lumps. Seal as before and dry in the sun.

Prepare a water-boiling bottle with an opening that fits snugly against the bottom of the box, filling it with three *sheng* of water. First, pour seven parts of boiling water into the bottle. Seal the rim with a ring of mud, place the box on top, and secure the edges. Set it in an ash jar without a tripod, simply covering it. Nurture with top-fire for three *fu* periods, adjusting the fire at dawn and dusk, using four, five, or six *liang* of fuel as needed. Once the time is complete, let it cool, remove the box, and open it—no mercury should be visible, as it will have fully entered the elixir sand. Weigh it to confirm the original weight, then leave it undisturbed. Seal and drench again as before. Repeat this four times, each time adding seven parts of boiling water to the bottle, placing the box on top while hot for best results.

After four repetitions, perform one "empty nurturing." During empty nurturing, fill the water bottle to the brim, seal as before, and place the box on top without covering it. Surround it with fire on all sides, nurturing for five *fu* periods, adjusting the fire at dawn and dusk with four, five, six, seven, or eight *liang* of fuel as needed. Once the time is complete, let it cool, open the box, and carefully remove some sprouts. Test them on charcoal fire—if they melt into perfect pearls without cracking, they are ready. If they scatter or crack, perform another empty nurturing.

To refine into treasure, do not use lead smelting; instead, melt in a crucible to form the treasure. If further pouring is needed, divide the full box according to the four-to-one ratio and nurture as before. After every four pourings, perform one empty nurturing. Test until it forms treasure, then proceed with further pouring. If the sprouts are too tender, do not drench—nurture again until they form perfect pearls before continuing. Thus is the Great Elixir of Ninefold Transmuted Cinnabar completed.
