**On the Precelestial**
All things endowed with precelestial *qi* occupy the positions of *geng* and *xin*, corresponding above to the Great White Star of Metal (Venus). This is called the Queen Mother of the West. It produces the marrow of the Red Phoenix of the South—this is the postcelestial, named *Metal Lead*, also called *Radiant Golden Essence*, *Lead White Frost*, or *Golden Liquor*.

Refined with the fire of ten thousand *jun*, it can never be exhausted. When it encounters earth, it dries; therein lies the sage’s work. United with its mother, it takes form; therein the embryo is born, and flesh and bone arise. This is the fixed principle of creation: from nothing, something arises. Metal subdues Wood, and Wood flourishes—such is its meaning.

When the Four Symbols are complete, the Center presides as master. When the Three Families gather, the Central Palace becomes the treasure. The meaning of "treasure and master" is not the subtlety of the Great Elixir, yet it is not easily understood.

This is what the Prince of Huainan refined as *Autumn Stone*, yielding inexhaustible treasure. Thus the Lord of Heaven cherishes it, and in compassion for sentient beings, transmits it but once in ten thousand kalpas. Those who receive it must possess the innate bone of immortals; if transmitted to the unworthy, calamity befalls nine generations.

The *Mysterious Statutes* state: "To reveal the Dao of Heaven or divulge the Great Treasure is a crime beyond absolution."

**True Oral Instructions**
Within the male lies the essence of the female,
Bearing yin yet embracing yang’s purity.
The Four Symbols depend on harmonious blending;
Earth and Metal yield forth yellow gold.

**Testimony of the Great Medicine**
Refine powder into lead,
Transform stone into dust.
By natural fire, transmute;
Remove the lead to obtain the cinnabar.
Then enter the *Flowery Pond*,
Returning to the source, restoring its hue.
Re-enter the *Spirit Chamber*,
Nurtured again by fire.
After sixty days,
The *Golden Liquor Elixir* is complete.
Consumed, it bestows immortality.

**Secret Writings**
The cultivation of the Great Elixir follows the same path as Heaven and Earth’s creation. Thus, *Taiyi* exists before *Taisu*; though it contains the most subtle emptiness, it gives rise to the first signs of manifestation. *Taiji* precedes *Taiyi*, and so there is *Kun* and *Cheng*—this is primordial chaos. Within it lies the essence of *Taiyi*, mother of Heaven and Earth, origin of the myriad things.

Once the One *qi* divides, the Two Modes separate. Then arise Qian and Kun, yin and yang, the Three Powers and Five Phases, the Five Metals and Eight Stones. The alchemist takes Qian and Kun as the crucible and vessel, and human beings as the medicinal ingredients. They steal the mechanism of yin-yang transformation, refining water and fire with precision, following the principles of *Kan*, *Li*, *Pi*, and *Tai*. Through bitter years of toil, in motion they rise with the Nine Yangs, in stillness they arise with the Six Yins—such is the great purport of elixir cultivation.

**Ode to the Spirit Chamber by Immortal Ge**
Shallow or deep, the Spirit Chamber is newly forged,
Within and without, its arrangements bear secret names.

The White Tiger is paired only with the Dragon,
The Green Dragon still walks alongside the Tiger.
The Two Modes are originally the union of Metal,
All phenomena arise from Earth’s generation.

Mysterious beyond mystery, truly luminous and clear—
Who in the nine-fold city could contest this?
Secret teachings trace their source:
True Lead is born in *geng*,
True Mercury in *hai*.
Their method rests on two principles:
Mercury is governed by yang,
*Geng* is restrained by yin,
Together they unite in the Central Palace.
Above and below, the fire blazes,
Transforming the foundation of the elixir—
On the seventeenth day.

An anonymous master transmitted this to three disciples,
Reaching Master Cui the Daoist.
Named the *Golden Mercury Elixir Method*,
He practiced it for over ninety years,
Then vanished without trace.

Its method undergoes four transformations:
First, *Borrowing the Womb’s Darkness to Settle the Embryo*;
Second, *Yin Substance with a Yang Embryo*;
Third, *The Six Spirits Subduing the Corpse*;
Fourth, *Cinnabar Marrow Replacing the Form*.

**Song of the Golden Mercury Cinnabar Method**
Bury the mysterious crucible in warm ashes,
By nightfall the yellow sprout stands ready.
Ninefold-refined cinnabar fills the five viscera—
Split open, and your lifespan equals Heaven and Earth.

**Xifang Zhongcheng Receives the Dao**
Xifang Zhongcheng followed Master Cui the Daoist for many years,
Reverent and meticulous, enduring hardships,
Undergoing repeated trials without the slightest respite.
The Daoist said: “You may now receive the Dao.”
A day was chosen for ascending the altar.
Zhongcheng lit incense at the furnace, swore an oath to Heaven,
Bowed twice, prostrated himself, and knelt to receive the teaching.
Master Cui addressed him:
“In former times, the essence of immortality was transmitted to only one person.
Yet you possess the wind and bones of a transcendent—
Though dwelling among the crowd, you stand apart, uniquely refined.
Now I shall pass on the secrets entrusted by my immortal teacher:
The weights of medicinal ingredients, the guiding principles of fire timing,
All that I have heard, I transmit to you in full.
If you later encounter a man of flawless virtue and unwavering devotion to the Dao,
You may transmit it to him—
Just as I have done for you, without concealment.”
Thereupon he bestowed the scripture of the *Four Transformations and Nine Revolutions*.

**First Transformation: Settling the Embryo by Borrowing Darkness**
Mercury is the essence of Wood,
Originally the marrow of cinnabar.
Just as it is about to emerge from the womb,
It requires the power of true yang.
Without the essence of correct yang,
Even the true mother cannot restrain it.
The first transformation meets true yang—
This is called *Borrowing the Womb’s Darkness*.

**Second Transformation: Yin Substance with a Yang Embryo**
The embryo harbors latent yang,
Yin lies hidden—do not forget for a moment.
Further relying on the congealed darkness of *geng*,
Pure yang guards the chamber.
Scholars must be meticulous,
Lest they idly boast of their own understanding.
The second transformation yields yang’s radiance,
Yet the face and form remain yin’s substance.

**Third Transformation: The Six Spirits Subduing the Corpse**
The method of the Six Spirits of immortals,
Ever concealed by the perfected.
For three periods, nurtured by civil fire,
Inside and out—
With pure yang.
Fools forget to ponder,
Dying with vain regrets.
The third transformation refines the slippery nature,
Yang’s slaying completes the corpse.

**Fourth Transformation: Cinnabar Marrow Replacing the Form**
One must recognize the two fundamental principles,
Then true lead’s darkness flows freely.
Nurtured by gentle, wafting civil fire,
Intermingling occurs in the Central Palace.
After seven days, the Dao is fulfilled,
Golden grains form naturally.
The treasure is completed through four transformations,
Cinnabar marrow replaces the form.

**Song of Fire Timing**
Day and night, *Tun* and *Meng* alternate as the two hexagrams—
Then use the true mother to restrain true lead.
Immortals fall silent at this point,
Forbidding ordinary minds from seeking with intent.

The blazing red golden elixir—mercury congeals into gold,
To return to true earth is to return to the real.
For three periods, the fire timing must be sealed tightly,
Lest glory lead to ruin and the loss of one’s self.

The secret transmission’s divine method is self-verified—
Only then does one trust that within the mysterious, another master exists.
Seizing the Tiger and Dragon to return to the correct earth,
Naturally, the transformations give birth to the infant.

**The True Mystery**
Great indeed is the wondrous method,
Coming from self-verification.

Not departing from the two flavors—one male, one female.
The male is called true lead, the female true mercury.
Paired in the Central Palace, they naturally resonate and respond.
When *Jiji* is achieved, even *Weiji* may suffice.
Without losing the three periods, cease the fire after seven days.
Within the crucible, gold increases—all depends on the Dao-mind.

The Azure Dragon soars and leaps, the White Tiger is restrained and captured.
One restrains, one subdues, alternating as mother and child.
When the nine cycles are complete, the yellow sprout emerges of itself.
Once the yellow sprout is obtained, the immortal has a home.
Again it is born, again it is produced—the Azure Dragon returns to cinnabar.
A single grain of cinnabar—first offer it to heaven and earth,
Then take it for oneself, forever escaping the register of death.
The fowl feeds and becomes a phoenix, the serpent transforms into a dragon.

All this I transmit face-to-face, the work of eighty-one days.
In the past, I received it from my teacher—all depends on fire timing.
If the fire timing is not off, one immediately becomes golden radiance.
If the fire timing is amiss, one drifts endlessly without bound.
The fire timing has its secrets—now I tell them to you,
But once obtained, do not reveal them to others.
If I did not speak, I would fear severing heaven’s root.
In the West, Zhongcheng completed it—profound indeed is this text.

**Song of the Treasure**
People of the world treasure gold and jade,
Yet know not what truly sustains them.
Some delight in fine food and coarse fare,
Others in splendid palaces—
A thousand clever schemes they devise,
Yet all are but empty deceit.
Why not refine the returning elixir,
That life may be endless?

**Song of Elixir-Refining**
The great medicine is none other than *jia* and *geng*;
When refined, brother and sister become intimate.
I bid you observe: when the elixir is complete,
A crane cries across ten thousand *li* of heaven and earth.

**Secret Formula for Elixir-Refining**
The good has no head, the cauldron has no ears.
*Geng* is the outer, *xin* the inner.
The vermilion-clad child, the red marrow—
No other substance is needed for direct refinement,
Only water and fire matched in harmony.

Mercury alone, nothing else—
First it becomes bone, then flesh.
Bone and flesh depend on each other, transforming into kinship.
From this, the river chariot may freely come and go.
Gold transforms into gold, silver into silver—
How could there be any other divine immortals?
Beyond three degrees of refinement and division,
Even the ancestral lineage is but dust and noise.

Sparrows do not hatch phoenixes, foxes and hares do not nurse horses.
Without true father and mother, all that is born is false.

**Method of Piercing the Heart and Establishing Restraint**
Heaven pierces the heart, earth establishes restraint.
The eight minerals vanish, the five metals become kin.
To dry cinnabar mercury, one must borrow ancestral *qi*.
Nurture the fire for seven days—*Jiji* is reversed.
Nurture it again for seven days—pouring, soaking, and refining.

**Transmission Formula**
Long ago, my late teacher warned me:
“The wonder of this art can ascend to golden elixir.
But if one’s fortune is meager, it may only become the supreme treasure.”
He also said: “For the noble, obtaining it is good fortune;
For the petty, obtaining it is misfortune.”
*The Classic of Yin Conformity* states:
“The noble one who obtains it endures hardship;
The petty one who obtains it treats life lightly.”
Indeed, when a Daoist obtains it, the heart is enriched—
Even if the body is poor, it is still good.
The petty person, however, says:
“Life and death are the common lot of humanity.
How could insensate metal and stone transform sentient flesh and blood?”
They only seek wealth for their household, glory for their person,
Grand dwellings and fine chambers,
Powdered faces and painted brows,
Feasts spread before them,
Song and dance on embroidered mats,
Wine to satiety, meat to repletion,
Indulging their appetites without restraint.
One day, heaven’s retribution arrives—
The teacher who transmitted it before is also implicated.
How can one not be cautious?

If you abandon the noble’s conduct and adopt the petty person’s views,
Not only will you bring calamity upon yourself—
How could I face my late teacher in the heavens above?
The immortal masters of past generations never failed to issue solemn warnings.
How dare I not stand in awe?

After transmission, you must take heed and be vigilant,
That fortune and emolument may endure without fail.

Xi Fang Zhongcheng transmitted it to Dai Daoheng.
On the night of the *jiazi* day, the seventh of the Shangyuan festival,
Facing south toward the Western Direction, toward the Northern Dipper,
Daoheng knelt and sought the transmission of the immortal’s art.
He was told:
“Long ago, Immortal Ge transmitted it to Zheng Siyuan,
Who transmitted it to Ge Zhichuan—Zhichuan was the immortal’s descendant.
The immortal did not transmit it to his son but to Siyuan.
What was his intent?
Among those who refine the elixir themselves,
There is no principle of transmission to father, son, or brother.
Zhichuan’s devotion to his father’s will,
Siyuan’s repayment of his teacher’s virtue—
This was truly a perfect fulfillment of both.
Yet how fitting were the transmissions of the various immortal masters,
Who refined the elixir, cultivated, and attained the Dao!”

Now I transmit the oral formulas of my late teacher,
The lineage of all the preceding texts,
The method of transmission and reception,
And the secrets of the *Piercing the Heart and Establishing Restraint* technique.
I also say: First, one may refine this;
Next, refine the nine-cycled golden liquid returning elixir.
But one must await the guidance of a sage teacher before the great medicine can be completed.

Daoheng bowed twice, prostrated himself, and expressed his gratitude:
“Now that I have received your teachings, how dare I not reverently obey?”
He was deeply indebted to his teacher’s kindness,
Hoping that one day, having completed the nine-cycled cinnabar,
He might fully inherit it.

Dai Daoheng transmitted the *Art of the Vermilion Marrow Exchanging Form* to Yang Xu.
Daoheng was of a solitary and pure nature, never conforming to the world.
From his youth, he yearned for immortality, and his resolve only grew stronger.
Later, he encountered a perfected one,
Who transmitted to him the arts of golden mercury and cinnabar elixirs.
Suddenly, it was as if he had found a shortcut to completion—
Piercing the heart and establishing restraint,
He grasped the principle of true correctness.
One could say he had deep insight and profound virtue.
At first, he did not wish others to know.
Later, two brothers from the same prefecture, Yang Xu and his sibling,
Studied the Dao and their merit and virtue grew daily more evident.
They knew Dai was no ordinary man,
And so devoted themselves wholeheartedly to serving him, unwavering for years.
Dai also knew that the Yang brothers were extraordinary,
Destined by fate for immortality.
Thus, he chose a day to transmit all the elixir formulas,
Along with what he had personally realized—
One could say he had found the right person to transmit to.
The Dao was now complete, its wonders beyond compare.

**Song of the Golden Elixir by Zhenyi Zi**
The great Dao gave birth to my body,
Yin and Yang lodged within my form.
Entrusted to the space between heaven and earth,
Life and death alternate in their course.

The gate lies within life and death,
Each path diverges in its course.
One gate dwells in yin’s stillness,
Within it, the numinous is quiescent.
Cultivating the spirit within yin—
This is the Western method.
Another Way exists within yang,
Its wondrous secrets held in immortal texts.
It points directly to the root of heaven and earth,
This root is called the True One.
Born before heaven and earth,
By which heaven and earth then opened.
Bid men to gather and accumulate it,
Refine it within the chamber of geng and xin.
Summon the dragon within wood,
Seal its mouth to ensure harmony.
Suddenly they become husband and wife,
Gradually giving birth to boy and girl.
After ten months, the elder and younger are complete,
All transforming into golden liquid.
The golden liquid becomes the divine elixir,
Consuming it, heaven and earth are fulfilled.
I speak this fully to my fellow practitioners—
Where shall you turn your intent to seek it?
The sun and moon speed like the wind,
Thirty-six thousand days pass in haste.

Master Cui the Yellow-Crowned’s Eulogy:
Great indeed is the supreme Dao,
The root of heaven and earth.
Moving through the True One,
It opens the wondrous gate.
The divine elixir’s transformations,
Its firing times are not complex.
Draw forth the true mercury,
Pair it with true lead.
Above heaven, below earth,
The sun and moon traverse their paths.
Cold and heat drive the divisions,
Forming south and north.
East and west converge,
Mercury white, lead red.
Consuming the cinnabar elixir,
The immortals have their abode.
