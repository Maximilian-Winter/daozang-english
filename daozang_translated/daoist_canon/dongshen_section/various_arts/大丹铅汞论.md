**The Discourse on the Great Elixir of Lead and Mercury**

**Title:** *The Discourse on the Great Elixir of Lead and Mercury*. Composed by Jin Fupo of the Tang dynasty. One scroll. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* section, *Zhongshu* category.

**Chapter One**
The art of the Great Elixir arises from lead and mercury. These two substances are the foundation of the Great Elixir. Observe their mutual transformation and activation, their exquisite interplay of restraint and subjugation—all emerge from the natural workings of Heaven and Earth, unattainable by human effort alone.

Lead pertains to yin, black in color, and corresponds to the Dark Warrior (Xuanwu). Its trigram is *Kan* (☵), residing in the north, governed by the *ren* and *gui* waters, for water generates metal. Within water lies metal, white in hue, corresponding to the White Tiger (Baihu). Its trigram is *Dui* (☱), associated with the west and the *geng* and *xin* metals.

Mercury pertains to yang, green in color, and corresponds to the Azure Dragon (Qinglong). Its trigram is *Zhen* (☳), residing in the east, governed by the *jia* and *yi* woods, for wood generates fire. Thus, within cinnabar lies mercury, red in color, corresponding to the Vermilion Bird (Zhuque). Its trigram is *Li* (☲), associated with the south and the *bing* and *ding* fires.

From this, we deduce: *Kan* is water, the moon, and lead; *Li* is fire, the sun, and mercury. There must not be the slightest deviation.

I often faltered midway, abandoning the path, until I consulted another adept, who declared: "Heaven is born from *Kan*; Earth is born from *Li*." *Kan* pertains to water, the moon, and lead; *Li* pertains to fire, the sun, and mercury. When *Kan* and *Li* interact, when the sun and moon conjoin, when lead and mercury engage, when the tiger and dragon reverse their courses—only then do they achieve completion.

Thus, I first employed water-lead to refine fire-mercury, then transformed fire-mercury into true lead. With true lead, I subdued the mercury spirit, producing true mercury. Through external alchemy, I attained the fullness of creation’s workings. Only then did I comprehend the inverted art of the Five Phases: the dragon emerges from within fire, and the Five Phases do not follow their usual sequence—the tiger is born from within water. The words of the elixir classics are not spoken in vain.

Ah! By refining mercury with lead, one obtains the treasure within mercury; when mercury is subdued by lead, one gains the metal within water, and lead is revealed. Refining mercury with lead, refining the elixir with mercury—whether called lead or mercury, neither is used exclusively. Whether termed mercury or lead, neither is employed singularly. When lead and mercury restrain one another, when the Yellow Dame (Huangpo) facilitates their union, how distant can the external elixir be?

**Chapter Two: Extracting True Lead and True Mercury**
Take eight ounces of refined lead and four ounces of mountain silver, melt them together, and collect the flowers to obtain eight ounces, called "lead yellow flowers." Grind eight ounces of cinnabar finely, place them in the divine crucible, and subject them to three cycles of water and fire. Naturally, true death occurs, forming the foundation of the Great Elixir—a mercury-free treasure of boundless value.

**Chapter Three: The Method of Conjunction**
Extract the flowers from black lead in the mountains, known as "lead yellow flowers," the White Tiger, which the elixir classics call "metal within water." Extract mercury from cinnabar through water and fire, known as "jade liquid," residing in the Azure Dragon, which the elixir classics call "mercury within cinnabar."

Combine the metal within water and the mercury within cinnabar, each weighing eight ounces, to embody the marvel of Qian and Kun. Harmonize and pair them, sealing them together in the divine crucible. Bury it in the divine furnace, balance water and fire, and apply the techniques of withdrawal and addition. Lead descends when united with mercury; mercury is subdued when united with lead—thus forming the Great Elixir of Dragon and Tiger.

Return it to the earthen cauldron, nurture the cinnabar, and augment it endlessly. In three sevens and four sixes, black, white, snow, and yellow sprouts all emerge from within lead and mercury.

Master Zhang said: "Without recognizing the true lead as the primal ancestor, all efforts are in vain." Master Zhongli declared: "Embracing the blackness of the Great One, cinnabar stands foremost among the eight stones. Within cinnabar lies mercury, mercury being the child of cinnabar. Embracing the brilliance of the Great One, lead stands foremost among the five metals. Within lead lies silver, silver being the child of lead. The silver within lead is difficult to extract; the mercury within cinnabar is easy to obtain. When lead and mercury unite and are refined, they become the supreme treasure. This is the wondrous secret of the immortals—those who attain it must not neglect it."

**Chapter Four**

**Chapter Five**
The Three Lineages Converge in the Primordial Palace: Mother Cinnabar, Spirit Cinnabar, and Vermilion Cinnabar are called the Three Lineages. Encase Spirit Cinnabar within Mother Cinnabar, then place it into the Lead-Yellow Great One’s Chamber to nurture until death. Next, encase Vermilion Cinnabar within Spirit Cinnabar, and again wrap Spirit Cinnabar with Mother Cinnabar, placing it into the Lead-Yellow Great One’s Chamber for seven days. With Mother present, Spirit present, and Vermilion present—this is called the Three Presences—blending into one is called the Four Images. This is the immortals’ secret method, the world’s supreme treasure.

**Chapter Six**
The Three Lineages Converge Again: Encase Vermilion Cinnabar within Raw Spirit Cinnabar, then wrap it externally with Mother Cinnabar. Place it into the Four Images’ Chamber for seven days, causing the Three Lineages to die again. Grind them finely, and their augmentation becomes boundless.

**Chapter Seven**
White Snow Transforms and Lives: Take four ounces of powdery frost, place raw male mercury close to the body, and set it into the Great Chamber’s base. After seven days, the powder truly dies, becoming snow-white and lovely. This powder possesses great efficacy; when used to dry mercury for transmutation, there is nothing it cannot accomplish.

**Chapter Eight**
White Snow Transforms into Yellow Powder: Take the dried true treasure of White Snow, crush it into white flakes, and refine it with fire above and water below—both in harmony and disharmony. Its color changes to yellow powder. When exposed to fire, it melts into liquid; when poured out, it forms a paste. Its taste is sweet, and it possesses the power to restore yang and revive the dead, a wondrous achievement in tempering and refinement.

**Chapter Nine**
Lead-Yellow Transforms into the Great Treasure: Take one jin of pure lead and half a jin of silver, melt them together into liquid, then add half a jin of *xin*. After a long while, remove and place it in a cold pot, then shatter it. This *xin* is one lump; separate the embryo to remove the lead and silver, then grind the *xin* into powder. Mix it evenly with cinnabar, place it into the fire crucible, and refine until death. The *xin* remains on top, cinnabar at the bottom. This cinnabar is the foundation of the great elixir; it must be decocted until half is lost, after which the medicine becomes potent and may serve as a covering.

**Chapter Ten**
Refining and Nurturing the Great Elixir of Lead and Mercury: Take eight ounces of the supreme treasure from the lead mine, shaped like woven threads—this is the Old Man’s Beard. Crush it into flakes, store it with cinnabar, and add eight ounces of mercury. Refine and nurture it for forty-nine cycles, and it will naturally transform into elixir powder. Once the furnace yields the elixir, it no longer reverts to treasure. This may serve as the Great Chamber to nurture cinnabar.

**Transforming and Refining the Four Spirits into the Great Elixir**

**First Secret:** Employ the immortals’ three elixir wondrous method. Take sixteen ounces of the mountain-marsh supreme treasure and twelve ounces of the mountain-marsh primordial Great One. Melt them together in a sweet crucible, using half a jin of lead-yellow powder as a base. Gradually add five ounces of cinnabar into it, refining until death and grinding into powder. Form five ounces of Spirit Cinnabar into a lump, then coat it with five ounces of dead cinnabar. Externally, wrap it tightly with one jin of four-six Mother Cinnabar, then refine it with lead-white frost until death. For all external wrappings, seal them firmly in an oil jar. After seven days of nurturing and one firing, open it when cold. Grind the cinnabar, Spirit Cinnabar, and Mother Cinnabar into powder to form the Great Chamber. This is the first secret.

**Second Secret:** Decoct mountain-marsh lead and silver to obtain half a jin of yellow blossom. First, wrap Vermilion Cinnabar piece by piece with one jin of Mother Cinnabar, nurturing until death, then peel away the Mother Cinnabar. Next, wrap equal parts of Vermilion Cinnabar and Spirit Cinnabar together, gradually nurturing them to death within the yellow blossom chamber’s base. Remove and grind them into one mass to form the Great Chamber. This is the second secret.

**Third Secret:** Using half a jin of yellow blossom as before, gradually nurture four ounces of Spirit Cinnabar within it until death. Then, mix equal parts of dead Spirit Cinnabar and cinnabar into powder and refine them into lumps. Externally, wrap them with a piece of four-six Mother Cinnabar, nurture them in the yellow blossom chamber until truly dead, and blend them with Mother Cinnabar to form the Great Chamber. This is the third secret.

These three secrets are the great cavernous true methods. All use common lead to kill mercury into true lead, and true lead to kill cinnabar into true mercury. When lead and mercury are combined and refined, they nurture the infant—spirit within spirit, sage within sage.

**Nurturing the Infant**
Though the infant and the maiden share the same source, their forms are indeed different.

The Maiden is yet to coalesce into embryo, while the Infant has already taken refined form. Once the Infant is born, it possesses divine and sagely powers, the ability to penetrate and transform, operating without constraint, its changes unfathomable. In heaven, it is white snow; in the world, a leaden vessel; in man, powdery frost. Immortals liken it to the Maiden—nothing more than mercury. Yet it is born from the womb of cinnabar, the essence of mercury, the darkness of cinnabar. Stir it, and it does not cloud; let it settle, and it does not clear. Though lodged high in the mountains, splitting stone cannot reveal its form. Gentle and luminous, chaff cannot sully its nature. This is the elixir of longevity, the treasure of transmutation, the world’s supreme jewel, beyond compare.

Yet the impure masses, blind to the root of creation, never having encountered the immortals’ secrets, dare to seek the perfection of this supreme treasure of dry mercury for their own use, to indulge their selfish desires—how utterly deluded. If one wishes to obtain the method, one must first seek a teacher. To acquire the formula, one must first cultivate conduct. Observe the movement and stillness of yin and yang, verify the cycles of heaven and earth, discern medicinal materials, inquire into the methods of water and fire, cross-reference and examine, peruse the alchemical classics, and seek out enlightened masters. Only then can one align with the tracks of heaven and earth, share the same mechanism as the inner elixir—how could this not be kept secret? To reveal it to the unworthy is to invite retribution upon seven generations.

**Refining Powdery Frost into the Great Elixir**
Take four ounces of powdery frost, mix with one ounce of silver powder, and grind evenly. Place in an oil jar, press the previous Three Cavern Elixir powder on top, then seal with yellow earth powder, ensuring a firm closure. Refine with four ounces of fire for five days and nights. Next, remove the powdery frost, grind it finely, and roll it into a thin silver tube. Insert the powder inside, seal tightly, and nurture it within the Three Cavern Elixir head for twenty-one days. This powder possesses great efficacy and serves as the method for transmuting the Great Elixir.

**The Mahāyāna of the Outer Elixir: Benefiting Others, Nourishing the Body, and Cultivating the Dao**
I have heard extraordinary individuals say: Heaven steals from earth, earth steals from man, man steals from the myriad things—the Dao of mutual theft among the Three Powers. The defense of the outer elixir arises from this principle. The outer elixir takes lead as its ancestor, silver as its mother, and mercury as its consort. Lead steals heaven’s darkness, silver steals lead’s darkness, mercury steals silver’s darkness—each pilfering from the other, yet the principle remains one.

The outer elixir, in its transformations, generates without end. Without grasping this principle of mutual theft and harmonious exchange among the Three Powers, how could one comprehend the wonders of the outer elixir’s mutual generation, nurturance, consumption, and union? Moreover, the defense of the outer elixir differs not in the slightest from the creative workings of heaven and earth. The Great Elixir takes lead as its ancestor, silver as its mother, and mercury as its consort. Using lead with silver draws forth the primordial unity of darkness. Discarding lead to use silver, and nurturing mercury with silver, evokes the darkness of the postnatal silver mother. Once mercury is killed into lead, it is called true lead. From this, we know that mercury’s theft of silver is the child’s theft of its mother—does this not resonate with the mutual theft of heaven and earth, and earth’s theft of man, giving rise to their interconnected theories?

Once true lead is dead, what then is the so-called true mercury? Little does one realize that mercury arises from the darkness of the postnatal. Unrefined, it is called true mercury. Grind true lead into fine powder, blend it with true mercury, then seek cinnabar to nurture them. When lead and mercury unite, yin and yang pair, refining and nurturing each other—only then can it be called the medicine of truly dead lead and mercury. Once mercury is dead, the mother’s darkness scatters and dissipates—this goes without saying.

At this stage, one must understand the wondrous union of form and spirit, aligning with the Dao in truth, to mirror the creative workings of heaven and earth, differing in manifestation yet sharing the same source. Thus, silver is the mother of mercury. Form is the abode of spirit. When spirit returns to its abode, form and spirit unite as one. Lead merges with mercury, mercury dies into lead. Silver and lead combine, child and mother meet, inseparable and unobstructed—this is the harmonious union of the Four Symbols, fulfilling the great function of the outer elixir.

Yet the Four Symbols and Five Phases cannot lack even one. What is this one? Earth. And what is earth? It is sulphur, the Yellow Dame, the Yellow Sprout. The alchemical classics state: *"Though the Yellow Dame serves as matchmaker."* They also say: *"Return lead to the Yellow Sprout."* And: *"Mercury is true mercury."* Further: *"In the ash pool, with scorching flames, lead and mercury become silver. Pure white, the treasure appears—gold can be made."* If two ounces of truly dead lead and mercury are smelted to produce sacred silver, this is precisely what the alchemical classics call *"returning mercury to the Yellow Sprout."* Following the previous method to nurture and extract cinnabar is precisely *"returning mercury to true mercury."* The marvel of this reversal is not to be disclosed to the uninitiated.

Yet why do Daoists say, *"Following the sequence, one becomes human; reversing it, one attains the Dao"*? Nurturing cinnabar with silver depletes the silver—its preservation lies in close contact. Nurturing cinnabar with cinnabar leads to loss; pouring cinnabar over mercury revives the cinnabar. Even after a thousand years, no success is achieved. For solitary yin cannot generate on its own, nor can solitary yang achieve completion. In the world, using silver depletes it—fortunately, mercury enhances it. Using cinnabar causes it to dissipate—fortunately, sulphur stabilizes it. With no loss of silver and no flight of mercury’s essence, nurturing mercury with silver allows for rebirth and possession of the body, returning to the origin. Refining the Yellow Dame anew as the matchmaker—how could this fail to yield success?

The ancients wisely said: *"Without cinnabar and sulphur, mercury does not dry; lead, without cinnabar, sulphur, and mercury, does not endure."* Is this not precisely the case?

For lead and mercury are the essence of the sun and moon, emerging from heaven to illuminate the four directions. The radiance of the sun and moon, alighting upon mountains and marshes, gives rise to the five metals, produces the eight minerals, and forms pearls and jade. What is this radiance? It is the manifestation of spirit and essence. What is the elixir? It is the true essence of lead and mercury, transformed through resonance into the returning elixir. When the elixir endures, it radiates; when it radiates, it shines—thus gold and silver are born, and all treasures emerge. The terms "drying mercury" and "transmutation" all derive from this elixir. All the world’s methods of refining cinnabar through steam and drips originate from this elixir’s generation.

Yet while the arts of gold and silver are but secondary pursuits of the immortals, one who can ingest and refine it, focusing the mind within the inner court and ascending further, will establish this heart in the realm of untroubled longevity, attaining the land of life-prolonging medicine. This is why I earnestly hold fast to it for the sake of fellow practitioners of the Dao.

*On the Great Elixir of Lead and Mercury* concludes.
