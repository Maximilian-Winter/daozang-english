### **Fascicle One: Essential Secrets of the Outer Elixir**

**Mountain and marsh substances**—two and eight make the *yuan*.
**Mountain-translated substances**—four and six form the *tuan*.
With *tuan* entering *yuan*, *bing* and *ding* unite with *qian*.

Mountain and marsh substances, hardened by roasting with sulfur,
Use *yuan* as the vessel, nurturing the dead to become lead.
Once true lead is obtained, mercury is then complete.
Cinnabar is ground together, then nurtured again with *yuan*.
When the cinnabar is dead, this is called the Great Completion.
Taking *yuan* to merge with the body, one may endure as long as Heaven.
Extending by analogy, true death achieves the Nine Returns.
When the five are prepared, how can this be recklessly transmitted?

I look up to observe Heaven and Earth, stealing from the Great Void to aid humanity.
Lead and mercury steal from the Great One to benefit all things.
For what steals from me steals my essence and *qi*, refining my hun and po.
If I cannot achieve the perfection of the tenfold work, how can I aid humanity and benefit all things?

The principle of mutual theft between Heaven and Earth cannot be lightly transmitted.
Yet how can the Dao of lead and mercury’s reciprocal gestation be left unexamined, failing to advance the work of benefiting humanity and aiding all things?

Its defense lies in lead as the root and mercury as the *yuan*.
Though people know lead and mercury as the foundation of the Great Elixir,
Most do not understand the principles of true lead and true mercury,
Nor the Dao of their mutual devouring—thus they fail to grasp the wondrousness of endless generation.

Moreover, when lead and mercury steal from the Great One,
They must be sustained by the Great One.
When lead and mercury devour one another,
One must know their origin, recognize their storehouse,
Understand their use, and discern their return—
Only then can one grasp the mechanism of creation and transformation.

Furthermore, the cloud-dragon and wind-tiger pertain to the Dao of spirit and *qi*.
Spirit arises from the mother, *qi* from the child.
Summoning *qi* with spirit, calling the child with the mother—
What would not come? Yet there is the peril of mutual devouring.
Thus, without success in lead and mercury, the defense of the outer elixir
Lies entirely in form and *qi*—this too must not be overlooked.

When the movement of the single *qi* is severed, one may know whether it is numinous.
Who does not know that the numinous is:
Form not numinous but *qi* numinous,
Life not numinous but death numinous?
Water, though utterly clear, congeals into ice that is not clear;
Spirit, though utterly luminous, congeals into form that is not bright.
When ice floats, its water returns to clarity;
When form is fixed, spirit returns to luminosity.
Knowing the principle of true death, one may cultivate the Great Elixir.

### **Fire-Dragon Dark Pearl: Symbolism of the Elixir Crucible**

**Great Elixir of the Fire-Dragon Dark Pearl**
Take one *jin* of dragon-tiger, weigh four *liang*, and grind finely.
Wrap in two layers of boiled silk, binding it into the shape of a chicken’s egg.
Trim away the excess to make it smooth.
Roast yellow earth and white sand into powder, weigh one *jin* and four *liang*,
Bind into the shape of a goose egg.
Cut skin paper into strips, mix glue with egg white, and brush onto the goose egg,
Leaving one end open to form a mouth the size of a chicken’s egg.
Allow the shell to dry until it is half a finger thick.
When dry, use a knife to crack open the sand-earth packet,
Remove the inner sand-earth, and wipe the silk clean—only then is it ready for use.

First, place the large shell with its mouth upward.
At the bottom, add eight *liang* of Green Dragon powder,
Then place the Dark Pearl ball inside.
Cut Kunlun paper into rings, resting them on the Green Dragon powder,
Leaving half exposed, not touching the shell.
Next, add eight *liang* of White Tiger powder.
Line the White Tiger powder with skin paper strips,
Then dip paper strips in egg-white glue to seal the shell’s mouth,
Matching the shell’s thickness, and let it dry.

Take a large coin, fill a pot with two *sheng* of raw roasted earth,
Place the large goose-egg shell inside.
Add three *sheng* of roasted sand-earth, packing it tightly around and above,
Seal with mud from the medicine container—only then may it enter the furnace.

For firing and adding water, begin the fire on the first day of the month,
Leaving one vent open for gas to escape, while sealing the other nine.
Cover the top with a wooden basin, also leaving one door,
Aligned with the lower vent.
Each month, rotate the door’s position.
For a four-*liang* fire, use the four times of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*,
Replacing the old fire with new.
After forty-nine days, remove and clear away the sand-earth,
Revealing a jade-like ball.
Carefully carve open the center with a knife, splitting it into two halves,
Marking the upper and lower crescents—do not record them carelessly.

Remove the Dark Pearl, clear away the silk ash,
Seal with yellow wax, place in an oil jar,
Bury in earth for three days, then take out and grind finely.
Mix with pinellia paste to form pills the size of *menglan* seeds.
Take three pills at first, gradually increasing to nine,
Swallowed with warm water, three times daily on an empty stomach.
Collect the numinous liquid produced, and refine it again as before,
Until four *liang* are exhausted.

Weigh again; if deficient, add previous Dark Pearl to make up four *liang*,
Grind, bind into a chicken’s egg, place within the upper and lower crescents,
Seal, and return to the furnace for another forty-nine days.
Retrieve the elixir, grind finely, form pills with pinellia paste as before,
And take as previously directed.
Refine the collected numinous liquid again until the medicine is exhausted.
Weigh to four *liang*, grind, wrap, seal within the upper and lower crescents,
And return to the furnace for another forty-nine days.
Thus, the fifth transformation of the Dark Pearl emerges.

At this time, bore a hole and insert one *liang* of mercury,
Seal with the upper and lower crescents, and nurture with fire.
For *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*, use a six-*liang* fire,
Nurturing for thirty-one days to produce silver.

The ninth transformation: test with mercury, and it becomes *geng*.
The tenth transformation: weigh out four *liang*, place within the upper and lower crescents,
Nurture with fire for one full year, then form pills with pinellia paste, each the size of a millet grain.
Take one pill each time, with freshly drawn water,
Consuming one *liang* makes one an earthly immortal.
Use one pill to transmute one *liang* of mercury into treasure,
Three pills can revive the dead instantly.
Ordinary people who consume one *liang* will enjoy longevity without aging.
Cultivators who consume one *liang* will attain immortality.
Guard this secret closely, do not reveal it to the unworthy—heaven’s decree is most severe.

**Method for the Golden Elixir**
Take four *liang* or half a *jin* of cinnabar,
Steep in grass juice combined with forty-eight bodily fluids, repeatedly straining the liquid,
Add half a *liang* of sulfur, and boil together for one *fu* period—longer is better.
If no grass is available, use vinegar for decoction.
Then, do not use four *liang* of *geng*; instead, take four *qian* of the elixir head,
Place in a crucible to melt into liquid, lift with an iron fire rod,
Stir into yellow powder, then pour into a clean jar until fully powdered.
Wash with water? Sift it, and if the original weight remains unchanged, it is most excellent.
Set aside one *liang* of the powder, then grind the remaining three *liang* with the boiled cinnabar until even.
Once the *geng* and cinnabar have exchanged *qi*, place them into the crucible.
Cover the surface with seven *qian* of the reserved gold powder, separated by paper.
Then, top with four *liang* of mountain marsh silver powder, tamp firmly with earth,
Place in an ash pit, seal tightly, and nurture with a four-*liang* fire for seven *fu* periods.
Open the seal, intensify the fire until the crucible glows red,
Leave overnight until dawn, then remove the silver powder—the true gold and cinnabar are now dead.
Grind finely, place in an oil vat, nurture with a five-*liang* fire for two *fu* periods.
Cover with borax, then apply a fierce fire to forge—when smoke forms, the supreme treasure is complete.
This is the sacred crucible: when blood and *qi* circulate freely,
Gold attains the sacred body, the firm resides in the yielding position, and transformation can occur.

Once the sacred union is consummated,
Remelt into liquid, add one *qian* of elixir head per *liang* of *geng*, stir as before into yellow powder, then grind again.
Add two *liang* of the boiled cinnabar, place into the crucible,
Cover with the previous seven *fen* of gold powder to isolate from silver *qi*.
Top with four *liang* of fresh mother silver cinnabar, seal the crucible’s mouth,
Place in an ash pit, nurture with a four-*liang* fire for two *fu* periods.
Use half a *jin* of charcoal to heat until glowing red, leave overnight until dawn, then remove from the furnace—
All gold and cinnabar are now truly dead, ground finely.
Since the gold *qi* is abundant, the cinnabar has fully transformed into gold powder.
Again, use this crucible with silver powder on top—this is the method of the immortals.
Spirit conjoins while form does not intermingle; gold and wood do not interact or obstruct,
Thus forming the great treasury of longevity. Water refines cinnabar into the treasure vault,
Nurturing the Three Yellows to transmute the Five Metals.

**Discourse on the Golden Elixir**
I have extensively studied the immortals of ancient and modern times,
And the great elixir is universally called the Golden Elixir—never have I heard of a Silver Elixir.
The Golden Elixir is named for its "indestructible, unchanging, firm, and unyielding" nature,
Which can eternally preserve longevity.
As a treasure, the Three Yellows cannot tarnish its essence,
Nor can cinnabar consume its form.
It can share the eternal duration of heaven and earth, and the radiance of the sun and moon—
No other substance can compare.
Moreover, the elixir is called the Golden Elixir, and the vessel the Golden Crucible—
Both take gold as their name, for they must be crafted from gold’s precious nature.
Once created, it relies on gold’s primordial *qi* to transmute worldly treasures like the Three Yellows,
Ascending together to the jade palace.
This clarifies the mechanism of creation and transformation:
First, it is forged from gold’s treasure, then transmuted—
Yet why do other alchemical texts fill libraries,
Yet when discussing the elixir’s mother, they speak only of true lead?
When distinguishing yin and yang, harmonizing the Four Symbols,
They mention white gold and cinnabar, black lead and mercury.
For transmutation, they speak of yellow sprouts and white snow, the dual essences of male and female.
Yet among all alchemical texts, not one uses gold as the elixir’s mother.
Some take fine gold to nurture cinnabar, wasting effort and fire in vain.
Others borrow white gold to aid cultivation—
Though it preserves color, it is not perfect.
Within ten years, observing creation,
Some use white gold to build chambers, others to make lids,
Or as outer walls—
Above, embodying the Dao of yin-yang union;
Below, modeling the method of butterflies and snails bearing offspring.
Examining the nature of things in detail,
They transmit essence, exchange *jing*, blend *qi*, harmonize spirit,
Adapting to the object, aligning with creation,
Testing through practice—
Though gradual progress is made, none achieve the state of instantaneous completion,
The realm of simplicity and clarity, the wonder of purity and singularity.

I have pondered this:
If cinnabar is deeply imbued with silver *qi* but lightly with gold *qi*,
What was once gold becomes silver.
If lightly imbued with silver *qi* but deeply with gold *qi*,
What was once silver becomes gold.
If the silver *qi* is faint and the gold *qi* not yet profound,
It may be gold or silver, but its consumable color remains indistinct—
One must clearly understand the Dao of nurturing, transformation, and change.
Once a decision is made and it becomes silver,
Can it not be reverted to gold?
Generally, forms created by the gathering of *qi* can be altered by *qi*,
But forms created by the blending of substances cannot be transformed by *qi*.
My method has many shortcomings.

If the gold *qi* is too faint and the silver *qi* too profound, attempting to transmute silver into gold would be futile. Though the efforts of the "Smoke Hermitage" may restore its gold-like nature, there will inevitably be loss and imperfection. Having recognized this flaw, one should henceforth refine and nurture with gold, transforming *qi* with *qi*—thus, what lacks enduring color may naturally revert. Alas, the substances of the yellow and white arts, though born of heaven and earth’s wondrous creation, also serve the Dao of human sustenance and the work of transformation. The depth or shallowness of their hues truly cannot escape the function of a single *qi*. It is like grafting: when a pear is grafted onto a peach, its fruit is sweet; when a plum is grafted onto an apricot, its fruit is sour. Each retains its inherent nature, yet through long accumulation, steeping, and gradual infusion, they may transform together, until their original nature is no longer discernible.

Day and night, I burned incense and prayed, studying and verifying the essential diagrams of past and present. Early on, I encountered a true immortal who transmitted the great method—the elixir of transcendence, the supreme vehicle beyond emptiness. Though I kept it secret for myself, I dared not conceal it entirely. Here now are the essential formulas:

**Formula for Crafting Spirit-Cinnabar as a Body-Adhering Elixir**
Take one tael of powdery frost in solid form, boil it in triple-filtered lotus ash liquid for one *fu* period. Mix male and female mercury powder with vinegar and apply it to the powdered body. First place it in a silver-mother cinnabar vessel, nurture it for three days, and it may truly die. Take one tael of cinnabar and one tael of sulfur, boil them together in the forty-eight-fold triple-filtered liquid for one *fu* period, then remove. Place in a sweet crucible, press dead powdery frost on top, then sprinkle silver cinnabar over the powder, and refine for seven days—it will truly die. Remove it, first apply the dead powder to the body, then the dead cinnabar, and finally the sublimated and fired preparation. These three body-adhering substances are not of this world, nor do they require ingestion of the mother. For each tael, use half a *qian* in weight, evenly applied to the body—guard this secret closely.

**Formula for Nurturing White Snow: The Five Agents Method**
Once the four images have truly died, take six taels of powdery frost, boil it in ginger’s natural juice for one *fu* period, and for best results, boil it again with lotus ash liquid. Remove it and place it in a silver vessel, pressing the four-image powder on top. Seal the exterior with a mixture of buckwheat, Sichuan pepper, cyperus, willow root, and *harītakī*, then nurture and refine. Remove it again, place it in the image powder, and nurture with fire for fourteen days—it will truly die. Grind it and combine it with the four-image powder to form the vessel of the great elixir of the five agents. Then take solid powdery frost, boil it with the three yellows, and place it in a solitary powder vessel to nurture until it truly dies—this is called the "White Snow Solitary Spirit Vessel."

**Formula for Nurturing White Snow: The Solitary Spirit’s Powder Nurturing**
For hardened powdery frost, use equal parts ginger juice and lotus root juice, boil for three *fu* periods, maintaining a gentle simmer like fish eyes. Add the three yellows to the liquid and boil together, borrowing slightly the function of their *qi*. Next, apply raw male mercury to the powdered body, place it in the White Snow vessel, and nurture with fire for twenty-one days. When the powder truly dies, it may be ground into powder to form a solitary nurturing powder vessel. Then nurture powdery frost within this solitary powder vessel—its wonders are inexhaustible. Without entering the lead pool, it becomes the treasure of mountains and marshes. Again, use dead powder as a vessel, then take raw powder, boil it with the two juices and raw sulfur-male mercury for three *fu* periods, and remove. Apply raw male mercury to the powder and place it in the former dead powder vessel to extract powdery frost, which may then nurture the two yellows to transform substances.

**Essential Formula for Powder Refinement**
From youth, I refined and nurtured spirit-cinnabar, knowing well the method of nurturing the child with the mother and making the child the mother, cycling through three transformations to achieve the nine returns, nurturing the yellow sprout, and refining it into red powder. Yet after nearly twenty years, I failed to succeed, enduring shame and humiliation, begging at others’ doors, poring over alchemical classics, seeking and verifying—all to no avail. Later, I received guidance from an extraordinary person, harmonizing the four images and assembling the five agents, aligning with the creation of heaven and earth. Though I could transmute the base into objects and turn goods into the genuine, I had not yet reached the realm of securing life and destiny, benefiting things and aiding people. Reflecting on the extraordinary person’s words, I realized that mother and child have the peril of mutual consumption, while refining red powder holds the power of longevity. Pursuing this principle, though I refined three times, it was not fully achieved; though I nurtured seven times, it was not fully completed. Later, nurturing red powder and following the formula’s refinement, I sought another vessel method and finally obtained great efficacy. Now I record the fire-nurturing formula for powder in these scrolls. Those who come after must not lightly disclose it.

Generally, red powder as a medicine, when attached to metal and water, grows silver sprouts. The *qi* of the mother coalesces to form its body, which differs greatly from cinnabar attached to yang. Without the divine chamber’s refinement, it will not succeed; without the divine talisman’s vessel nurturing, it will not form; without boiling in triple-filtered lotus leaf liquid, it will not be subdued. The nurturing method always uses gentle fire, first steaming, then refining, retaining without loss. If one hastily applies great fire, refining once will cause loss, nurturing once will cause dissipation. It is like nurturing an infant or playing with a maiden—only by carefully regulating the fire’s timing can true death be achieved. When red powder dies, mercury dries; when mercury dries, the refined powder becomes treasure. If this matter is leaked, disaster will follow swiftly.

The formula states:
Boil like crab eyes, refine without pure yang,
Nurture with warmth, so it does not scatter.
For one to three days, one tael each morning and evening.
On the fourth day, one and a half taels each morning and evening.
Reverse the positions of the vessel’s top and bottom.
On the fifth and sixth days, one and a half taels.
**Formula for Cinnabar Spirit**
All cinnabar spirits have the peril of mutual consumption. Only when powder meets the mother is there no fear of such loss.

Cinnabar depends on sulfur to form its body, yet sulfur can deplete the mother—thus, when it encounters sulfur, its qi is lost. Even if one exhausts all the metals and minerals under heaven or seeks the rarest numinous sprouts, this peril cannot be avoided. Cinnabar, numinous essence, and powder—only when these three mutually restrain and subdue one another can the work of transmutation be achieved.

Once numinous cinnabar is formed, probe it with a knife and scrape away the sulfuric qi. Shift it beneath the mirror’s surface, invert it into the crucible, and support it so the mouth of the crucible is buried. Seal the edges with mud to prevent fire from damaging the cinnabar’s body. Refine it slowly with charcoal, ensuring the mirror’s surface and skin do not crack. Mix the medicine with vinegar and apply it to the body, first placing it in the mother’s chamber. Use a yin furnace—fire above, water below—and nurture it for seven days. Then employ a yang crucible—water above, fire below—and refine and nurture it for another seven days. If the method is kept secret, sulfuric qi will not escape, mercuric qi will not fly, and both mother and child will be preserved, yielding their full benefit.

I have grasped the subtle essence of nurturing numinous cinnabar and received the transmitted method from my teacher. Its efficacy lies in the marvel of transmutation, culminating in *danyang*. The *danyang* method transforms the bones, rivaling the world’s treasures—how could this be an easy task?

Among all medicinal substances, none surpasses *white snow*. The medicine of *white snow* is none other than *powdery frost*. This substance is exceedingly difficult to nurture and refine. Though one may scald it with boiling water and simmer it in juice for a full day and night, it must then be placed in a chamber with red powder. Alternatively, use a divine vessel, covering its top with the *Four Symbols* powder. Seal the exterior with a paste of *huangyaozi*, *chuanlangdu*, *ziheche*, *bajiaojing*, *wasong*, *xixin*, *fengwei*, and *shiwei*, mixed with honey. Refine it with fire, then remove it from the cold furnace. Peel away the external medicine, place the divine vessel’s powder into the *Four Symbols* powder, and nurture it until it achieves true death. There is no fixed duration; follow the teacher’s instructions, and profound efficacy will be verified.

First, take three *qian* of white metal and mix it with seven *qian* of red metal. Add two *qian* of feminine powder and half a *liang* of dead numinous essence. The numinous essence, now divided, rests atop the red—though it was once white and dead, it will no longer be stained by the red. Then melt one *liang* of red metal, add another half *liang* of dead numinous essence along with the previous portion, and two *qian* of *pi* powder. First transmute the numinous essence, then divide it so the red substance rests atop, transforming it into a treasure of pure yang. Combining two portions of dead numinous essence—one *liang* in total—yields only eight *qian*. Add two *qian* of dead *xin* powder, melt it into liquid, then introduce half a *liang* of raw iron and three *qian* of raw saltpeter. Seal the mouth with mud and fan it with a great fire. Break the crucible and retrieve the dross. Replace the crucible, refine it with five *qian* of lead until pure, yielding two *liang* and seven *qian*—this is the method of bone-transformation.

The efficacy of *white snow* is the supreme method of elixir refinement. Later, there is the *Divine Talisman* elixir, also refined from *powdery frost*, whose potency far surpasses that of *white snow*. In this *Divine Talisman*, I have truly attained the utmost subtlety.

**Essential Formula for the Divine Talisman**
Pour mercury from the *white snow* and wait for it to dry into sprouts. Take eight *liang* or one *jin* of sacred sprouts, refine and nurture them into powder, then place them within *lotus powdery frost*. It can be boiled or destroyed; nurture it for fourteen days. Every two *qian* can transmute red substances into the superior *danyang* of bone-transformation. This elixir, following the teacher’s method of transformation, is also called *Divine Talisman White Snow*. One *qian* can transmute one *liang* of red substance into treasure or dry one *qian* of mercury into one *liang* of treasure.

In the *dinghai* year, I completed *white snow* and derived the *Divine Talisman*, further transforming it into *Jade Divine Talisman White Snow*, which dries mercury into treasure and transmutes *danyang*. When using the previous *Four Symbols* furnace, each *liang* yields only three *qian* or more of treasure. I could neither sleep at night nor eat by day, and after consulting a wise teacher, I realized: the sulfuric qi in numinous cinnabar is never exhausted; the powder contains mercury, and mercury can revive sulfur. As days and months pass, what was dead revives. Every three *liang* yields only three *qian* of treasure, while the rest becomes a viscous, sugary substance and is lost.

I again sought my teacher’s guidance and obtained the secret of preserving mercury while removing sulfur, finally achieving complete efficacy.

**First Method for Refining Cinnabar to Remove Sulfur**
First nurture numinous cinnabar into treasure and remove sulfur. Then refine cinnabar to remove sulfur; the *Four Symbols* method removes sulfur, but the *Five Phases* method does not.

**Poem:**
With sulfur binding mercury, numinous cinnabar is cut off,
Using the mother’s lotus to nurture my family.
Preserving mercury and removing sulfur yields the great treasure,
Three returns and subdued fire reveal the yellow sprout.
Dead mercury alone is finest,
Yet with cinnabar mercury, cinnabar is formed.
Refined through water and fire for twenty-eight days,
The celestial fire’s timing yields the sacred yellow sprout.
Nurture cinnabar with the yellow sprout,
The *Four Stars* chamber is the source of life.
With fire’s timing perfected in forty-nine days,
Dry mercury becomes true treasure—worthy of praise.

**Treatise on Refining Numinous Cinnabar to Remove Sulfur, Preserve Mercury, and Form Treasure**
For numinous cinnabar and cinnabar to become treasure and dry mercury into silver is the rarest learning in the world. The refining of numinous cinnabar has been transmitted for ages, and countless have attempted it, yet few have succeeded in forming treasure.

Numinous cinnabar, if refined with herbs and minerals or nurtured with the eight stones without the mother, cannot achieve its purpose. If the mother is used but not restrained with herbs, it will be excessively consumed and fail to achieve numinous communion. If the mother is scarce and the child abundant, it cannot achieve true death. While it is said that with the mother it is not numinous and without the mother it cannot form, if the mother is abundant and the child scarce, the best method is to borrow the body to restore the soul. If the mother is scarce and the child abundant, the finest is that which is not brittle but firm. Without the mother, it is brittle and cannot be firm. If it feeds solely on the mother, the mercury departs—this is borrowing the mother’s body.

With or without the mother, whether the mother is abundant or scarce—both lead to death, burning with greenish smoke and brittle residue. Why is there no treasure? Generally, the principle of having or lacking the mother is unknown to learners. All is constrained by sulfur: initially, without sulfur, mercury alone cannot achieve the marvel of the two qi. If numinous cinnabar forms and then dies, sulfur does not depart, and the treasure cannot be completed. In this process, mother and mercury are as one, both seized by the qi of sulfur, burning to a brittle green, melting into a lustrous liquid. With the mother, there is a white outer layer, but within, it is brittle and green. Without the mother, it is merely dark green, turning to liquid. In both cases, ghostly flames and yellow smoke persist. If one hastily refines it in a furnace, sulfur corrodes the mother and mercury; the more it burns, the more it cracks, and mother and mercury become difficult to preserve. All is consumed by sulfur’s fire, transforming entirely into an oily syrup—how lamentable! Efforts are wasted, labor in vain.

The ancient immortals said: "Among metals and stones, sulfur is the general, devising strategies. It is also the Yellow Matron, able to capture and subdue mercury, and to mediate the union of silver-mother to form its substance. Yet it cannot separate the embryo from the body to become silver." It is also said: "Great peace is only permitted to be secured by the general, not to be witnessed by the general." Once mercury is subdued, sulfur does not depart, and its malevolence remains—this is the very principle.

Now that this enterprise is in hand, I reveal these hidden mechanisms, not fearing offense against heaven, but hoping to aid future generations. Those of sincere aspiration who obtain this, take heed not to dismiss it lightly. Reflect on the arduous toil of learning—beware, beware!

The formula states:
"Take four ounces of *xiaoyu* (saltpeter), and boil it with flowing water."

Take one catty of *dushen* (iron bloom) and process it for one day. For dead *zhuling* (cinnabar), use four ounces of *du* (iron bloom) to nurture one ounce, seal it tightly, and place it in a chamber filled with ash. Pile ash high around it, then apply a cluster of fire for one *duan*. The next day, retrieve it—if the *lingsha* (spirit sand) appears snow-white, it is ready. If not yet white, take the *lingsha* and boil it briefly with *xiaoyu* (saltpeter), then return it to the chamber. Nurture it with cluster fire for one night, and it will assuredly become a white-bodied substance. Place it in the furnace, add a small amount of dead *pengxiao* (borax) to refine it, and introduce a little raw lead below—this substance will then become a peerless worldly treasure.

**Divine Snow and Dan Yang’s Four Elders Elixir**
- Two ounces of *fen shuang* (calomel)
- One ounce of *shuijing pi* (rock crystal fragments)
- Two *qian* of *pengsha* (borax)
- One *qian* of *pao* (processed mineral)
- Three *qian* of *ruxiang* (frankincense)
- One *qian* of *yanxiao* (saltpeter)

Grind these six ingredients finely and mix them. Add four ounces of silver powder and place them together in a water-and-fire crucible. Apply eight catties of fire, measured precisely, following the same fire regimen as for *lingsha*. When the cold furnace is opened, the medicine will have sublimated to the crucible’s rim on all sides, appearing black—collect it. The silver matrix will have settled at the bottom; discard the matrix and retain the medicine, calling it the *Four Elders Elixir*.

**Transforming the Four Elders Elixir into the Four Treasures Divine Snow Elixir**
- Three ounces of *Four Elders Elixir* powder
- Five *qian* of *fen shuang*
- Two and a half *qian* of *pi* (rock crystal fragments)
- Half a *qian* of *peng* (borax)
- One *qian* of *xiao* (saltpeter)
- One *zi* of *ruxiang*
- Half a *zi* of *pao* (all the above to be used raw)

Mix these with two and a half ounces of silver powder, grinding them finely and evenly. Blend with ginger juice to form a paste, then roll it into tubes using silver foil. Place the medicine inside, securing it with fine iron wire. Use *shuizhongjin* (water-borne gold) as the chamber, covering it above and below, and seal it tightly. Place it in an ash pit, leaving one *cun* of space, and nurture it with fire for sixteen days—applying one tael of fire at *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*, replacing the fire each time. When the time is complete, cool it and peel away the silver foil to collect it; this can be transmuted into *Dan Yang*. Alternatively, grind the medicine in an iron mortar into fine powder to serve as a mother-and-child chamber.

**Transforming the Four Treasures Divine Snow Elixir into the Divine Talisman White Snow Elixir**
Take four ounces, half a catty, or one catty of the previous *Four Treasures Elixir* to form a chamber. Within it, nurture *fen shuang* to produce the *White Snow Elixir*, following the oral instructions.

**Transforming the Divine Talisman White Snow Elixir into the Light Crimson Powder Elixir**
Take four ounces of *daguangming zhusha* (great luminous cinnabar), boil it with forty-eight *jin* of water for one *fu* period. Wrap it in half an ounce of silver foil and place it in the *White Snow Elixir*, nurturing it with fire for seven days—applying one tael of fire at *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*, replacing it to form the treasure. This can also be used as a *zhangzi* (rod) for *Dan Yang* or to refine *geng* (lead) into yellow. Alternatively, combine this substance with the *Divine Talisman* and nurture it with fire for three seven-day periods to prepare it for *san* (sprinkling). One *qian* of *hongfen* (crimson powder) can dry five ounces of mercury. Once the treasure is formed atop the *tangping* (decoction vessel), pass it through the *qilu* (qi furnace), and the smoke will yield an upper-grade supreme treasure, also transmuting into *geng*.

**Nurturing Lingsha with the Divine Talisman White Snow Elixir to Form the Purple River Chariot Elixir**
Within the *White Snow Elixir* chamber, nurture *lingsha* for seven days to produce silver. The *lingsha* combined with *White Snow* can also be used to refine *zhang* (rods) into full-strength *Dan Yang*—three *qian* per tael yields top-grade silver. In the *Purple River Chariot* chamber, nurture *sanqi musha* (three-seven mother cinnabar) with *erba* (two-eight) qi infusion, applying one tael of fire for two hours at *mao* and *you*. After one seven-day period, the mother cinnabar will transform in the white furnace into a treasure, which can also be refined with *chongzhang* (opposing rods) to produce top-grade *Dan Yang*. The mother cinnabar extracted from the *Purple River Chariot* can be used in a *yinchan* (silver toad) chamber to nurture *fen shuang*, refining gold.

**Nurturing Divine Powder to Transform Orpiment into the Golden Blossom Elixir**
Take four ounces of *yezicihuang* (leaf orpiment), boil it with forty-eight *jin* of water for one *fu* period. Wash and strain it, then wrap it in one tael of fine *geng* foil, securing it with iron wire in a cross. Place it in the *Divine Powder* chamber and nurture it for sixteen days. Upon removal, peel away the gold foil—one *qian* can refine one tael of *huayin* (flower silver) into *caihuajin* (rape-blossom gold).

**Nurturing Divine Powder with Realgar to Form the Golden Male Elixir**
Take four ounces of *xionghuang* (realgar), boil it with forty-eight *jin* of water for one *fu* period. Wash and strain it clean, then wrap it in one tael of full-strength *geng* (lead). Place it in the *Divine Powder* chamber and nurture it for sixteen days. Upon removal, one *qian* of gold foil can refine one tael of *huayin* into *guanjin* (official gold).

**Miscellaneous Methods of the Elixir Chamber**
Grind one catty of medicinal stone finely and place it in a clay pot. Use *fengweicao* (also called *eqingcao*, or goose-green grass), *shancigu* (Chinese tulip), *machixian* (purslane), *zhizhu* (rhododendron), or *bajiaogen* (banana root)—any dead *pi* grass will suffice. Gather four or five *dan* (picul) of it, pound and crush it, then press out its natural juice. Alternatively, add clear water and place it in a large vat. After settling for two or three days, take the clear liquid from the top and boil the medicinal stone in it for seven days until it resembles congee. Add more juice and boil for another three to five days. Then, place the medicinal stone over a charcoal fire and heat it until the smoke dissipates—when it reduces to half a *dan*, it can be used to decoct the medicine until it is eight or nine parts dry. Place good-quality paper on a bed of furnace ash in a pot, then set the medicine on top to wick away moisture. Dry it thoroughly, seal it in a container, and nurture it with four taels of fire for over a month. Seal it in a crucible, then calcine it in a kiln. Seal it again in a container and nurture it until it is truly dead—when it becomes snow-white, light, and smoke-free, it is ready. Then, pass it through the mother qi to form a chamber. For every eight ounces of medicine, take eight ounces of fine silver, melt it with fire, and pour it into a Hangzhou pot. Divide the medicine into six small packets and place them one by one onto the silver, allowing the medicine to melt slightly and stir. Add another packet, repeating until all six are incorporated and fully stirred. Lift the pot, let it cool, then break it open—the silver below will remain white, while the medicine above will take on a yellow hue, indicating it is ready for use as a chamber. The silver will not lose a single fraction. Add three ounces of lead to the silver, melt it, and remove the lead—only then can the silver be worked. It can also be used to nurture cinnabar.

**Method for Refining Divine Sand (Lingsha)**
Take eight ounces of mercury and two ounces of fine sulfur, grind finely, and stir-fry until it turns into a blue-gold hue. Add half an ounce of *cixiong* (male-female alchemical pair), place in a water-and-fire crucible, and seal tightly. Begin with a low fire beneath the crucible until it glows red, then wait until the medicinal qi rises fully. Brush with salt-clay, and after half an hour, increase the fire to seventy percent. When the medicine in the crucible begins to ascend, the water will naturally boil. Once the boiling subsides, apply a strong fire for one full cycle (twelve hours), and the substance will harden like iron.

**Method for Refining Vermilion Divine Sand (Zhu Ling)**
Take five ounces of the previously stir-fried blue-gold mixture and five ounces of cinnabar, grind together finely, then add two *qian* of raw sulfur. Stir-fry again for half an hour, then place in the crucible and apply fire as before.

**Method for Refining Cinnabar (Zhusha)**
Take ten ounces of cinnabar and six ounces of fine sulfur, add two *qian* of *ci* (female alchemical agent), grind finely, and stir-fry in a Yao-style fire for half an hour. Seal in the crucible and apply fire as before. For every ounce of cinnabar, only eight *qian* will remain after refining.

**Method for Boiling Cinnabar**
Divide each ounce of cinnabar into ten pieces, place in a silk pouch, and boil in medicinal liquid for three days before pressing it into the chamber.

**Medicinal Boiling Agents**
Use *diyu* (burnet), *wujia* (acanthopanax), orange leaves, *hanjiao* (Sichuan pepper), *guanzhong* (dryopteris), or lotus leaf ash.

**Pressing Method**
For each ounce of cinnabar, divide into ten pieces. Use one *qian* of thin silver foil (Hangzhou "Manzi" foil, approximately twenty sheets per ounce), pressing each piece firmly onto the cinnabar.

Then, line the *pi* chamber with lotus leaves, nurturing six ounces of cinnabar with half a catty of medicine. Arrange in two layers, seal tightly, and nurture with three ounces of fire for six days, then four ounces of fire for three days. When removed, the cinnabar will appear dark greenish-black on the surface but red within—only then is it ready for the mother chamber.

**Method for Entering the Mother Chamber**
Take eight ounces of *shanze* silver (or use charcoal powder as a substitute). Alternatively, spread rice husks in a large basin, mix with water, then melt the silver into a liquid. Hold a bamboo tube in the left hand, lift the crucible with the right, and pour the silver through the tube into the husks, where it will naturally form round beads.

For every half-catty of mother cinnabar, mix two ounces of *pi* chamber medicine into the mother as a coating. For every catty of mother, nurture four ounces of cinnabar, dividing into two sealed vessels. Nurture with three ounces of fire for five days, then four ounces of fire for four days. When opened, the divine embryo will have transformed into treasure, ready for projection.

**Projection**
When the nurtured divine cinnabar is truly dead, with mother and child both complete, take one ounce of divine cinnabar and place it at the bottom of a crucible. Cover with one ounce of bone powder, then top with lead powder or *huangdan* (red lead). Ignite from above, applying strong fire until it melts into a liquid. Once cooled, break the crucible to retrieve it, then refine with lead to obtain one ounce and five *qian* of ninety-percent pure silver.

**Method for Smelting Divine Cinnabar**
Take one ounce of dead cinnabar and one ounce of lead, melt the lead first, then add the cinnabar. Fan to remove the lead, and the cinnabar will naturally turn snow-white.

**Smelting the Mother Chamber**
Take the nurtured mother silver, mix with two ounces of *huangdan*, and stir evenly. Apply fire for one full cycle, then refine with lead. If the divine sand does not invert, further refine it to kill it. Once cinnabar enters the mother chamber, it will be eighty percent dead.

Use *cigu* (arrowhead) pounded into paste, or large golden crabs, or any sulfur-subduing herbs for short-term refinement. Place straw beneath the crucible, divine cinnabar in the middle, and cover thickly with straw. Seal the top with a tile, without needing to seal tightly. Build a brick furnace, place the medicinal crucible inside, surround with charcoal, and cover the top with charcoal as well. Ignite from above until the bottom glows red and the crucible itself turns red. Prepare a *dou* of furnace ash nearby, mix with water to dampen, and when the medicinal crucible is fully red and the straw smoke nearly exhausted, transfer the crucible into the damp ash and cover with more damp ash. Once cooled, remove it—the cinnabar will be truly dead.

**Replenishing Divine Sand**
Take two ounces of cinnabar and boil dry with the previous medicine. Grind four ounces of mother into powder, then add one ounce of raw *pi* as powder. First stir-fry the mother until hot, then add the *pi* and stir-fry together. Use this mother to nurture the cinnabar for two seven-day periods: two ounces of fire for the first seven days, two and a half ounces for five days, and three ounces for two days, then six ounces of fire. After one night, remove it—the cinnabar will weigh one ounce and eight *qian*. Refine with lead to form treasure. One ounce of cinnabar yields eight *qian* of silver.

For the mother silver, mix evenly with two ounces of *huangdan*, wrap in paper, then in cloth, and bury in the ground for three days. Remove and dry by heating. First melt four ounces of lead in a crucible, then add the mother and melt together—this is the replenishing method.

**Method for Binding Mother and Sand**
Take one ounce of mother and hammer into two or three pieces. Place with five ounces of mercury in a Jian bowl, add one ounce of yellow wax and three to four ounces of clear oil, and boil until the oil and wax fully melt. After half an hour, remove and let cool. Use a knife to cut around the edges—the oil and wax will form a single block, with the silver and mercury united beneath. Remove the silver and extract the sand, then repeat the process with the silver until it is fully consumed. This method can only bind two to eight parts of mother sand.

**Extracting Mercury from Cinnabar**
Take ten ounces of cinnabar, grind finely, and mix with pine charcoal powder. Fill a large crucible to sixty percent, then cover with more pine charcoal powder. Place a small tile on top, securing it with iron wire to form a lid, and bind it to the crucible mouth. Dig a pit in the earth, place a small jar inside, fill the jar with water, and invert the crucible over the jar’s mouth, sealing with clay. Surround with bricks and apply a strong fire for one cycle, then add half a furnace of fire.

For every ounce of cinnabar, seven *qian* of pure mercury may be obtained. Remove the water from the jar and wash to purify.

**Separating Silver from Refined Gold**
For every ounce of pale gold, use one ounce of raw sulfur—or seven *qian* of half-tamed sulfur. Steep the sulfur in a decoction of honeysuckle vine (also called egret vine) or dodder vine, or with rhododendron flowers or lotus leaves, for four to five days until it naturally tames. Mix two and a half *qian* of saltpeter with soapberry powder, gradually adding it to the crucible to form a liquid. Add two and a half *qian* of alum and two and a half *qian* of borax; grind all ingredients finely together.

Melt the pale gold into a liquid, first adding a small amount of sulfur to stabilize it. Lift the crucible and allow it to cool. Then sprinkle the prepared medicine over the surface, covering it with a mixture of aged wall clay and borax. Place a small crucible lid on top, bind it with iron wire, and seal tightly. Coat the entire vessel with clay. Apply a strong fire until fully refined, then allow it to cool. Break the crucible to retrieve the contents: the gold will form a single mass within, encased in silver. Remove the outer silver, then repeat the process with the gold, using half the previous amount of medicine, and refine again as before to remove the silver. For the third iteration, reduce the medicine by half once more and proceed in the same manner; only then will the gold be pure.

Melt the silver and residual medicine in lead. If copper is present in the gold or silver, first refine it with saltpeter to purify, then separate the gold, silver, and copper.

For silver separation: cover the molten metal with a mixture of wall clay and salt, allowing the two *qi* to interact naturally without stirring. Break the crucible to retrieve the contents, then remelt. Use saltpeter with a higher proportion of saltpeter to alum, refining repeatedly. Stir until the saltpeter and alum adhere to the crucible’s edges, then pour out the silver. Re-melt the alum to extract any remaining silver, repeating until none remains. If the silver is seventy percent pure, only seventy percent will be recovered.

**The Shrinking Method**
The *Qinglü Pian* states: Use a clay vessel weighing forty-nine *liang*, half a *jin* of mercury, half a *jin* of tin, one sprig of thousand-year grass, and one sprig of centipede grass, and refine them together.

**The Immortal Lü’s Prescription**
Beyond the bright window, place mulberry firewood;
A single drop then nurtures the sacred embryo.

Within the seventy-two transformations, casually crafting a golden hairpin with a mere smile.
Take four *liang* of cinnabar, two *jin* of mulberry ash infusion, and boil them suspended until purified.
Next, use four *qian* of chalcanthite, four *qian* of alum, four *liang* of coal, and leek juice to boil the alum; then boil the alum with black fish gall. Place in a *Six-Yi* chamber, and fix with *xuanjing* stone—this applies only to well-prepared ingredients.

The elixir is endowed with the qi of Heaven and Earth, seizing the radiance of the sun and moon. It possesses both yin and yang, which must be harmonized in proper sequence. First, discern the mother and child; then examine the details. Without knowing the ingredients, one labors in vain, and nothing will be achieved.

Those who obtain this method are blessed by past merits, their names inscribed in the immortal registers. Through accumulated deeds and accumulated merit, they aid others and benefit all things. Should one misuse it, they shall willingly face celestial judgment.

Written by the Immortal Ancestor Lü, Pure Yang, in his grotto and bestowed as a prescription.

**Another Prescription**
For the bright window, only mulberry firewood is required for refinement.
Take four *liang* of *gouzi* root, four *liang* of sour ginger grass, four *qian* of red [ingredient], one *sheng* of firewood, and one *dou* of vinegar. Boil in a cauldron overnight, then simmer into a paste until dry. Grind into powder, form into pills with yellow wax, each weighing one *qian*, with one pill per four *liang*. This is indeed a divine prescription. The two ingredients, ginger grass and *gouzi* root, can serve as a swift method for mercury.

**Another Prescription**
In a *Six-Yi* chamber, for seven days, use two *liang* of charcoal for fire.
Take four *qian* of cinnabar, one *sheng* of mulberry ash, four *qian* of mercury, and four *qian* of cinnabar.

**Mercury Dominating Cinnabar**
Grind mercury and cinnabar together, then boil in the juice of leek roots. When the roots of *jinyin hua* are added, it becomes "toad-head nitre-borax." For boiling *xin*, if one wishes to reduce it to liquid, only the use of multiple stones as borax—one part nitre to one part—will suffice. Litharge can transmute gold.

**Another Prescription**
One *qian* of medicinal head, four *liang* of tin, two *liang* of mercury, and two *qian* of protective *xin*. Treat with vinegar as before, then apply in accordance with the previous method.

**Agricultural and Alchemical Practices**

**Hunyuan Elixir**
Take half a *jin* of visible cinnabar and place it in a vessel. Pour two *liang* of mercury, then seal the opening with red halloysite and clam powder mixed with vinegar. Do not further reinforce the seal. Nurture with two *liang* of fire for three days. On the fourth day, add two more *liang* of fire, continuing for a total of seven days and nights, alternating the fire at *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* hours.

When the time is complete, open and inspect—the mercury will have fully dried. If any trace of oily mercury remains, reseal the vessel and nurture with fire for another three days until the mercury is dry. Then open the vessel and pour in two more *liang*. Repeat this process four times to obtain half a *jin* of dry mercury.

For a "Longevity Chamber," pour four *liang* each time, firing for seven days and nights, transmuting mercury up to a hundred *liang*. Collect the finest smoke to form an incomparable treasure.

**Nine Cycles of Divine Cinnabar**
For every two *liang* of mercury poured, use five *liang* of fire. Place in the fire at the *shen* hour, and by the next day, the mercury will be "dead."

Laozi said: *"Sown at dawn, reaped by dusk; poured in the morning, dried by evening."*

Take three *liang* of "green-sprout cinnabar" and pour three *liang* of mercury. At the *yin*, *wu*, and *xu* hours, use four *liang* of fire each. After three days and nights, open and inspect. If no sprout has formed, pour another four *liang* and nurture for three more days and nights—yellow sprouts must emerge. Once sprouts appear, do not disturb them. Pour another four *liang* and nurture for five days and nights, then pour again and nurture for another five days. Over the course of a month, pour four *liang* six times, totaling twenty-four *liang*.

When the time is complete, remove the yellow sprouts that have ascended and flown upward. Weigh them—whether half a *jin*, ten *liang*, or a full *jin*—and collect them. Then place them back into the fire to nurture, where they will transform like a surging spring.

The residue at the bottom of the vessel that does not ascend is useless as sprouts. However, when combined with the original cinnabar and refined in a "grass chamber," it will become a treasure in a single firing.

Crush the yellow sprouts, then levigate and wash them in water. The portion that follows the water may be nurtured in a crucible to become the Great Medicine. The portion that does not follow the water becomes "white nitre-sand" and is a treasure, though not a medicine.

Alternatively, use five *jin* of sprouts as the mother. Every five days, pour five *liang* of mercury, harvesting the raw to refine the cooked—thus, the mercury will never be exhausted.

For four *liang* of cinnabar, pour one *liang* of mercury and use three *liang* of fire, nurturing for three days. When cool, remove and pour another *liang*, nurturing for another three days. Open when cool—the "cold-forest sprouts" will have formed, but they must not be disturbed. Pour another *liang* and repeat four times, totaling four *liang* of mercury. When the sprouts become firm enough to resist the hand, they may be plucked. If they reach two or three *cun* in height, it is most wondrous.

Collect them gradually, and they may be transformed at will, capable of sixteen transformations. This is the ultimate method for pouring mercury in the "Longevity Chamber."

**Nine Cycles of Divine Cinnabar**
Take five *liang* of nurtured mercury, ensuring no impurities are mixed in, and place it in a separate vessel. Each day, pour five *liang* of mercury into the vessel and place it in an ash jar. Use five *liang* of crucible fire, pouring once every three days. The mercury will surge upward like a jade forest in a jeweled grove, forming pearls with red-tipped heads and coral-like shapes—this treasure is truly delightful.

*Essentials of Refining the Great Elixir, Volume Two*

**Cinnabar Crucible Formula**

For true cinnabar resembling arrowheads, lustrous and bright, sourced from Chenzhou, use three *jin* as the standard. Place it in a silk pouch and steep it in hot water infused with mulberry ash lye. Once the lye is fully strained, pour it into a sand pot. Suspend the cinnabar pouch within the lye, ensuring it neither touches the surface nor the bottom. Cover with another sand pot, sealing the rim with ash residue. Heat with a gentle mulberry fire, neither too fierce nor too slow, maintaining a simmer like fish-eye bubbles. Boil for three seven-day cycles. If the cinnabar does not turn black and translucent by the end, continue boiling for another three days and nights. Check the lye level nightly—if shallow, replenish and reseal. Once the cinnabar is black and lustrous, remove and let cool.

Next, take raw native silver, chop and file it into fragments, and place it in a sand box. Line the box first with black paper, then layer silver and cinnabar alternately until full. Secure with iron wire in a cross pattern. Seal the lid with red halloysite powder mixed with paper fiber to prevent any leakage—this is called "mother and child generating one another." Dig a pit two *chi* and four *cun* deep, bury the box for three seven-day cycles, then retrieve it. Melt the contents in a sweet-clay pot, and it will naturally form a liquid—this is refined silver, equal in quality.

When burying the cinnabar, first craft a yellow wax crucible mold. Once dry, remove the wax to hollow the mold. Heat the mold before casting to ensure even distribution. Before pouring, place powdered *tie shan* grass inside the mold to hasten the crucible’s formation. Later, fashion a lid from patterned silver based on the crucible’s size, leaving a small aperture. When mercury is placed inside, add *tie shan* grass powder through the aperture and gently heat with ash fire—soon, it will dry into a treasure. For every *jin* of mercury, use three *liang* of red fur as the core, five *qian* of "Golden Duke" as the intercalary agent, stir evenly with dry willow twigs, and add a pinch of borax and saltpeter to remove impurities. Pour, and true treasure will form. If *tie shan* grass is unavailable, substitute with powdered *mu lü* grass root—this also suffices.

*Its poem reads:*
*A leaf, a branch, a flower,*
*Deep mountains are my home.*
*Cinnabar glows at my sight,*
*Mercury crystallizes into sand.*

This grass resembles *tiannanxing*: one leaf, like hemp, with seven lobes; its flower, like a hanging bell, purple with a yellow center. There are two types of *tie shan* grass: one with green leaves and purple undersides, hairy beneath, white flowers with hollow yellow centers, unmoved by wind yet swaying without it; the other, *mu lü*, has white roots, green leaves, yellow seeds, and a red stem.

**Crucible-Casting Method**
Use equal parts realgar, sulfur, orpiment, *wujia* bark, *dusao*, human placenta, purslane, and *renyan*. Grind each into fine powder, mix with red halloysite, and apply to the inner and outer surfaces of the wax mold. Reinforce with well-kneaded paper fiber and yellow sand-clay, then bake until dry. Melt the wax to cast the crucible.

**Sand pot | Native silver | Sand box | Sweet-clay pot | Mercury in crucible | Three *liang* red fur | Five *fen* Golden Duke | Borax and saltpeter (small amounts)**

**Cinnabar Elixir**
Take four *liang* of high-quality *renyan*, grind into powder, and combine with half a *qian* each of roasted cinnabar, borax, and frankincense. Place in a fire-and-water crucible and sublimate onto the lid. When ready, mix with calomel and yellow wax oil to form pills—each two *liang* can transmute ten *liang*. Red fur may be added to the true treasure in ratios of three-seven or four-six. Then, boil repeatedly in a plum pot to complete the treasure. *(Note: The proportions of calomel and yellow wax oil are unspecified.)*

**Divine Elixir**
Take eight *liang* of mercury and two *liang* of sulfur. Stir-fry in a new iron pot until sand forms; if flames arise, sprinkle with vinegar. Once ground fine, place in a fire-and-water crucible, seal the mouth with vinegar-mixed red halloysite, and bind with iron wire. Dry in the sun, then coat with mud for reinforcement. Use twenty *jin* of charcoal for firing—if the crucible cracks, repeatedly apply halloysite to the breach until the fire subsides. After a night, retrieve, grind fine, and repeat the process seven times. Avoid corpse vapors, women, dogs, and other impurities; perform the work in a purified chamber after fasting and selecting an auspicious day and hour.

**True Treasure Formula**
Five *qian* mercury | Five *qian* cinnabar | Three *qian* realgar

**Method for the Wax Seal Pill**
Take one *liang* of yellow wax and form it into a pellet. Then boil ten *liang* of purslane to extract its juice, mixing it with five *liang* of white lime powder and paper fiber. Add powdered calamine, needle ironstone, magnetite, hematite, white sulfur, red lead, *jīnjīngshí*, and *yùjīn*, grinding them into a paste. Divide the mixture into two equal portions. First, wrap half around the wax pellet, ensuring no seams remain, and let it dry. Then place the mercury, cinnabar, and other ingredients inside before sealing. Coat the pellet with the remaining half of the paste, smoothing it evenly, and let it dry again. Place it in a silver-melting pot, cover with a grinding tile, and seal tightly to prevent any leakage of qi. Once dry, reinforce the entire surface with *liuyi* mud, bind it with iron wire, and ensure it is thoroughly dry. Then use twenty-four *liang* of charcoal to slowly heat it for one week until the entire surface turns red. Remove from the fire and let it cool before opening. Discard the outer layer, retaining only the inner coating. Mix burned paper ash with rice water, apply it, and bake again. Place the pellet in a silk pouch and wear it against the body for forty-nine days. Then grind it into powder, hollow out an apricot pit, remove the kernel, fill it with the powder, and bind it with copper or iron wire. Seal with mud and place it in an incense burner’s fire for one full day and night. Retrieve it, and it will become a true treasure. Consume no more than one *qian* per day; do not overindulge in wealth or luxury, nor violate the ancestral vow. Never recklessly transmit this to unworthy persons—such an offense is unforgivable. Beware, beware. Those who encounter the green glow should take care to protect themselves.

**Illustration of the Ninefold Reversion and Completion Furnace**
Place the furnace in the central chamber. To the south of the furnace, arrange a circular platform. The furnace itself is round on the outside and square within. Its circular diameter is one *chi* and four *cun*, while the inner square measures one *chi* and two *cun*, with a depth of seven *cun*. A iron grate divides the interior. The total height is one *chi* and five *cun*, with three tiers on the exterior, each four *cun* high and three *cun* wide, except the lowest tier, which is twice as wide. Excavate the ground beneath the southern side to the grate to allow for ash removal. On the uppermost tier, inscribe the Five Phases: Fire to the south, Water to the north, Wood to the east, Metal to the west, and Earth at the center. On the second tier, inscribe the Eight Trigrams in the Later Heaven arrangement: *Zhèn* (east), *Xùn* (southeast), *Lí* (south), *Kūn* (southwest), *Duì* (west), *Qián* (northwest), *Kǎn* (north), and *Gèn* (northeast). The lowest tier serves as the fire path, where one paces three circuits during firing. To the south of the furnace, set up a circular incense table. Behind it, place a couch where the master sits daily in vigil. Arrange all utensils for frying and decocting on either side. Store all medicinal ingredients and crucibles in cases, treating them with reverence. Assistants must remain outside the chamber unless summoned; unauthorized entry is forbidden. Should the master leave the chamber, the door must be locked.

**Secret of the Ninefold Cyclic Golden Elixir**

**First Cycle: Nurturing Cinnabar into the Elixir Treasure**
*Poem:*
From white, seek within white;
From red, seek within red.
Let it be prized as gold and purple—
Who could rival its worth over kings and lords?

Master Yin the True says: "Good lead has no head; the cauldron has no ears. No medicine is needed—simply refine it directly."
Laozi says: "Red lead and black mercury are the great heads of the elixir; mercury alone is supreme."
Red lead is cinnabar; black mercury is mercury. First refine red lead into white cinnabar, then combine it with mercury to form the treasure, establishing the foundation of transformation and the principle of boundless nourishment.

Take twelve *liang* of headless good lead and spread it at the bottom of an iron vessel. Place half a *jin* of fine cinnabar on top, then cover with four *liang* of good lead powder. Fill the remaining space with raw yellow earth, and seal the seams with red halloysite and clam powder mixed with vinegar and honey. Reinforce with *liuyi* mud and let it dry. Place it in the immortal’s furnace and apply four *liang* of fire for seven full days. Once cooled, retrieve the cinnabar, now transformed into treasure, and crush it into pellets.

*Song:*
Do not use lead as lead—
You must work within lead.
If you use lead as lead,
You err in using lead.

Another verse:
Swallows do not hatch phoenixes;
Foxes and hares do not nurse horses.
Without true parents,
All offspring are false.

**Second Cycle: The Treasure Appears as Frosted Jade Trees**
Take half a *jin* of the treasure cinnabar and place it in a vessel. Pour two *liang* of mercury over it, then seal the seams with red halloysite and clam powder mixed with vinegar and honey. Let it dry without further reinforcement. Place it in the furnace and apply two *liang* of fire for three days. On the fourth day, add two more *liang* of fire and nurture it for seven days, changing the fire at the hours of *zǐ*, *wǔ*, *mǎo*, and *yǒu*. Once the time is complete, open the vessel to find the mercury dried. If any trace of oily mercury remains, reseal and nurture with fire for three more days, following the previous method. Once the mercury is fully dry, open the vessel again. Pour another two *liang* of mercury and nurture with fire for seven days as before. Repeat this process four times to obtain eight *liang* of dead, dry mercury, totaling one *jin* with the treasure cinnabar. Without adding more mercury, nurture it for seven more days. The mercury and cinnabar will transform into frosted jade trees, their transformations endless.

If making *shēngyǒngquán* pellets, pour four *liang* of mercury each time and nurture with fire as before, cycling through seven days and nights. Increase the mercury to one hundred *liang* before stopping. Select the finest dried portion, refine it in the furnace, and it will become an incomparable treasure. When placed in a chamber, it emits light at night, and ghosts and spirits hide from its radiance. If forged into vessels, flying insects dare not approach. Using one *liang* of the unburned substance can transmute ten *liang* of low-grade silver into the finest, as if freshly mined from mountains and marshes.

**Third Cycle: Frosted Trees Transform into Jade Laughter**

Take sixteen *liang* of the previously prepared cinnabar-mercury mixture, grind it to powder, and place twelve *liang* into the vessel, filling it halfway. Pierce several holes with a stick, adjusting their size to allow the pouring of four *liang* of mercury, resembling lotus seeds in form. Cover the top with the remaining four *liang* of powder, then seal the seams with red halloysite and clam powder mixed with vinegar and honey. Let it dry without further sealing. Place it in the furnace and nurture with fire for seven full cycles of seven days. Upon opening, the mercury will naturally form into ingots, resembling jade shoots. If further refined in the furnace, it becomes the finest treasure. Its uses are boundless for those who cultivate the Dao, though practitioners must still exercise careful judgment.

**Fourth Cycle: Nurturing the Minor Elixir**
*A song says:*
The red and white two substances must first be subdued,
Only then can the fiery dragon be captured.
When metal and wood submit to the great refinement,
Their essence coalesces, dissolving the crimson chamber.
A single bright star gleams within the crucible,
Half a wheel of the red sun flies forth from the furnace.
Once the elixir transforms all things under heaven,
You will truly grasp the power to shift creation’s mechanisms.

Take four *liang* of the previous mercury-silver and cast it into a vessel shaped like a chicken’s egg. Place one *liang* of fine cinnabar inside, seal the seams with red halloysite mixed with honey, and let it dry without further sealing. Cover it with the vessel containing the nurtured jade shoots, and tend the fire in four seasonal cycles for seven days. Upon opening, the cinnabar—weighing exactly one *liang*, neither diminished nor increased—will have formed a fire-resistant embryo of unchanging hue. Grind it into a fine powder, mix with paper mulberry juice, and form into eighty-one pills. Suspend them in a crimson silk bag within a well for seven cycles of seven days to dispel fire toxins. Choose an auspicious day—such as the Three Origins, the first *jiazi* or *gengshen* day, or the first or fifteenth day of the month—and draw fresh well water at dawn, facing the sun. Ingesting one pill extends life by a twelve-year cycle.

To test the elixir’s efficacy, take four *liang* of mercury and place it in an oil-free crucible. Add one pill of the elixir, cover with a dish, and seal the seams with damp paper. Heat it over charcoal fire until the mercury emits sounds like an infant’s laughter or weeping. When the sound ceases, examine it to find refined silver of the highest grade—proof of the elixir’s power. Store the remaining elixir in a secluded chamber, sealed in a crimson silk bag and kept in a hidden place. Cultivators must accumulate virtue and aid the poor; greed and indulgence will invite disaster.

**Fifth Cycle: Nurturing the Yellow Sprout from the Minor Elixir**
*A song says:*
The Minor Elixir’s efficacy is best when early,
No need to boast of its transformative power.
After nurturing it through four cycles of seven days,
Opening the furnace reveals the Yellow Sprout.

Take eight *liang* of the Minor Elixir and nurture it for seven cycles of seven days without a vessel, following the previous fire-tending method. The medicine will transform into the Yellow Sprout.

**Sixth Cycle: Nurturing Vermilion Cinnabar with the Yellow Sprout**
*A song says:*
When the golden cinnabar is nurtured to perfection,
Do not lightly share its secrets abroad.
Seek the purest essence after refining the dregs,
Harvest the sprout before it divides.
Three dragons unite under *geng* and *xin*,
Five tigers circle through *chen* and *si*.
Once the red maiden sheds her form,
A heap of golden bones will astonish all.

Grind the Yellow Sprout into powder to prepare a vessel. Take four *liang* of cinnabar lumps, coat each with real gold leaf using honey, and wrap them completely. Place them in the vessel, seal the seams with red halloysite and clam powder mixed with vinegar and honey, and let it dry. Then apply a layer of the finest tea buds and *huazi* (refined dregs) as a six-one sealant, half a finger thick, and let it dry. Place it in the furnace and tend the fire as before for seven full days. The cinnabar lumps will transform into *zimo* gold, also called the Golden Silkworm.

**Seventh Cycle: Nurturing the Yellow Sprout with the Golden Silkworm Vessel**
Place four *liang* of the Golden Silkworm into a vessel and pour one *liang* of mercury over it. Seal the seams with red halloysite and clam powder mixed with vinegar and honey, and let it dry without further sealing. Then place it into the Yellow Sprout vessel, reseal the seams with the same mixture, and let it dry. Tend the fire as before for seven days and nights. Upon opening, the mercury will have embraced the Golden Silkworm, forming golden sprouts—true treasures of the immortals. Repeat the process, adding one *liang* of mercury each time and sealing as before. After four cycles, the mercury will total four *liang*. On the fifth cycle, add two *liang* of mercury, and continue the fire-tending as before. On the next cycle, add sixteen *liang* of mercury, then cease further additions and simply nurture it for seven cycles of seven days. This yields sixteen *liang* of *geng* treasure, which can then be used to cast the crucible.

**Eighth Cycle: Casting the Golden Crucible**
On the first day of the year, the Three Origins, the first *jiazi* day, or the first *yin* day of the month, select a purified chamber and set up a furnace. Erect a three-tiered altar: arrange the nine stars on the top tier, the eight trigrams on the middle, and open eight gates on the bottom. Place swords at the four cardinal directions, hang mirrors, and offer sacrifices to the Three Pure Ones. Then cast the sixteen *liang* of *geng* treasure into a crucible shaped like a chicken’s egg, which can be used to nurture the Great Elixir into an incomparable treasure.

**Ninth Cycle: The Great Elixir of Gold**
*A song says:*
When the work of creation reaches its limit,
The fiery dragon rests—this is the cinnabar elixir.
It transforms mortal bones into immortal bones,
Turning poor households into wealthy ones.
The secret method comes from the enlightened,
Do not boast of its marvels to the unworthy.
Those who cultivate hidden virtues align with heaven and earth;
Deviating from this path invites certain disaster.

Follow the crucible method and offer thanksgiving sacrifices. Then place four *liang* of fine cinnabar into the golden crucible and seal the seams with red halloysite and clam powder mixed with vinegar and honey. Tend the fire as before for nine cycles of nine days. Upon completion, remove the elixir, grind it into an extremely fine powder, and mix it with the natural juice of paper mulberry to form eighty-one pills. Store them in a crimson silk bag and suspend it in a well for seven cycles of seven days. Choose an auspicious day to offer sacrifices to heaven and earth, the Three Pure Ones, the sun, moon, stars, all spirits and ghosts, dragon deities, local earth gods, and the household’s original destiny. Sincerely swear an oath. First, offer a portion to the famous mountains and great rivers, as well as to accomplished masters and fellow cultivators.

A song says:
A scroll of immortal formulae, rarely heard in the world—
Do not speak of this gate to the foolish and ignorant.
Leaking heaven’s mechanism invites calamity;
Secretly guarding the divine instructions enters the immortal source.
When refining, let no common man witness;
Once nurtured, do not discuss it with the vulgar.
Three parts, one part must aid the world—
When the elixir is complete, the household accumulates Kunlun’s splendor.

**Supreme Treasure Formula**
Take *qianli root* in any quantity, fresh and moist; those from Jiaozhi and Guang are best. The older and larger, the finer—this is the root.

To the right: Use a newly forged iron pan, never before used. Place mercury within, boil it in sesame oil, then pare the medicinal root into pieces the size of fingernails and add them. When the yellow-black impurities are removed, pare again, and strain through silk cloth. Then take the cinnabar and store it in a separate container.

The method for the container is ordinary, yet its name has been kept secret through the ages. It is called *Four Qi Powder*; mixed with water to form a container, wrapped and fired—from *chen* to *si*, it becomes pure gold.

The *Four Qi* herb is known to all, found everywhere, relied upon by people as indispensable as the sun. A eulogy praises it:
Born in autumn, dies in summer,
Nurturing human life.
Its powder like jade flakes,
Mixed with water, slightly firm.
Enveloping that divine cinnabar,
Placed in the *wu* crucible.
From *chen* to *si*,
Emerges golden splendor.

When sealing externally, use *gan kan*; when calcining, use *hundun*.

The treasure’s master, the Yellow Emperor, realized it only after three years—later, the formula was recorded here. This substance is one of the five grains, endowed with the qi of Metal. It flourishes in autumn and winter, blooms in spring, and withers in summer. Its seeds are powdered like jade dust—what people commonly eat.

If one takes its finest, whitest part, mixes it with water to form a container, places it in ashes, and fires it fiercely from *chen* to *si*, it becomes gold. Those of steadfast resolve will receive divine revelation. Those who comprehend must not lightly disclose it, lest misfortune befall.

In ancient times, knowledge was not lightly transmitted or received. The wife of Cheng Wei, a Han dynasty *Qimen* Gentleman of the Household, was adept in divine transformations and could refine mercury into silver. When Wei sought the formula from her, she declared that his bone structure was unsuited to receive it. Despite his relentless insistence, she departed through *shijie*. He Zhizhang once visited an old medicine-selling king to inquire about the art of the Yellow and White. He presented the old man with a large pearl, who then exchanged it for a cake to give to He. He thought to himself, "How could such a precious pearl be traded for a mere cake?" The old king said, "Your attachment to rarity remains unremoved—how then can the art be mastered?" Here ends the essentials of refining the Great Elixir, *juan* the lower.
