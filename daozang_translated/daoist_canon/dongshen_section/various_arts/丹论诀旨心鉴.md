### **Preface and Essential Formulas (Chapter One)**

The *Cantong Qi* states: "The arts are vast and numerous, numbering in the thousands." Yet the marvel of the Great Elixir lies solely in the two substances—lead and mercury—as the supreme medicines, not in the four yellows or eight minerals. If the qi of mineral drugs enters these two, it becomes highly toxic, and all who consume it perish.

Mercury, though naturally occurring in humans, requires the qi of yin and yang, refined through water and fire, to form the Great Elixir. Ingesting it grants longevity. But if one uses alum, sulfur, or cinnabar—calcined and sublimated into medicine—it becomes highly toxic, gradually harming the body. Such substances may dissolve copper and corrode iron, yet how could they be fit for consumption? Even alum alone can slay tigers—a dire warning indeed.

Generally, those who learn even a minor alchemical method claim few in the world possess such knowledge. If they administer the elixir to others, sudden and unnatural deaths may occur, a tragedy most lamentable! Thereafter, skeptics arise, decrying that "mineral elixirs provoke sores, ulcers, and swellings." Such misguided individuals slander the efficacy of the Golden Elixir, declaring it unfit for consumption.

As for stalactites and the like, it is best not to ingest them. One must not indulge in sensual pleasures and force their consumption, for such recklessness has led to countless premature deaths. One should carefully examine purgative medicines, employing them to induce elimination. Consuming *fangji* (stephania root), mallow, and licorice decoctions will gradually expel toxins, allowing the Great Medicine to be safely ingested.

The Great Elixir is the primordial, authentic qi of Heaven and Earth, the sustenance of the Supreme Sovereign and the host of immortals. It encompasses the Four Symbols to take form, relying on Qian and Kun to transform itself. When condensed into crimson and violet hues, it becomes the Elixir—known as *Zhengyang* (True Yang), *Zhuanyang* (Exclusive Yang), and *Yuanyang* (Primordial Yang)—the One-Return Elixir. How could such a process be easily grasped?

Devoted Daoist adepts must carefully preserve this knowledge, transmitting it only to the worthy, that the Way may not perish.

Heaven’s generative transformations align with the Three Powers, following the *Yijing*’s symbolic hexagrams and the cyclical rhythms of yin and yang. The Great Elixir is achieved through the grand completion of a year, the measured movements of the sun and moon. Thus it is attainable, and the ancient immortals all ascended by this means.

Longevity and eternal vision—when the common folk hear of this, they clap their hands in mocking laughter. But the wise, upon hearing it once, comprehend and align with the true origin. Fearing my own inadequacy, I cite the *Song of the Three Sages* as proof and clarify it through the *Discourse on the Golden Elixir*, sparing further redundant explanations.

The Return Elixir is refined by the revolutions of the sun and moon, returning to its original essence and reverting to the color of cinnabar. Thus it is called the *Return Elixir*.

There are three grades of elixirs:
1. *Zhengyang Dan* (True Yang Elixir), the Upper Return;
2. *Zhuanyang Dan* (Exclusive Yang Elixir), the Middle Return;
3. *Yuanyang Dan* (Primordial Yang Elixir).

Though three in name, they are one in essence, all belonging to the lineage of the Great Return. Without knowing this mystery, one cannot speak of the methods for cultivating the Elixir.

Furthermore, merely boiling cinnabar in brine to subdue mercury alone is insufficient. Why? Because it is solitary yin without yang, gradually harming the body and failing to attain the position of True Yang. Some use *cengci* (a mineral preparation) to kill mercury and combine male and female forms, yet this is also unfit for consumption. Such methods are passed down through mutual transmission, but they are not the true, sagely medicines. Why? Because all eight minerals are toxic.

The *Jinbi Jing* states: "Discard the five alums and do not use the eight minerals." The formula declares: "Do not use medicines; use the Five Phases." This is the ultimate principle!

### **On Clarifying Distinctions (Chapter Two)**

Three *liang* of sulfur can control one *jin* of mercury, proving mercury’s power is inferior to sulfur’s. The strength of one *liang* of mercury is like that of an ox; thus, one *liang* of sulfur can control five *liang* of mercury, again showing mercury’s weakness before sulfur.

By this logic, the Great Elixir does not use sulfur but true lead. Five *liang* of true lead can control two *jin* of mercury, demonstrating mercury’s inferiority to true lead. Thus, yin is subdued by yang, not the reverse—this is the true principle.

The supreme Way seeks longevity and the cultivation of the true mind. Without the Great Elixir, one cannot attain the Dao. If one suddenly encounters this formula, it is only through the accumulation of great merit that such secret texts are revealed. If transmitted to the unworthy, seven generations of ancestors will suffer calamity, and descendants will be harmed.

In refining the Great Elixir, the key does not lie in the flavors of the medicines but in the precise mastery of the Five Phases, the clarity of *Yijing* symbolism, the discernment of seasonal transitions, the knowledge of the sun and moon’s movements, and the interplay of yin and yang. These are the essentials of immortality and the foundation of the Dao. One must not trust the eight minerals or four yellows, for they are not the wondrous medicines of longevity.

Lead and mercury are the root of the Great Elixir, the origin of the Five Phases, and the sovereign of the eight minerals. Gold’s nature is cold, residing in yang—it is the single yang within Kan. Mercury is born within cinnabar. Stone’s nature is hot, residing in yin—it is the double yin within Li. The gold within lead is true lead.

Thus, yin and yang unite. Yang is the ruler, yin the minister—the principle of stone floating and metal sinking is evident. When ruler and minister harmonize, floating and sinking attain balance, and the medicines combine. This is the wondrous essence of immortality.

Without knowing the ruler and minister, or distinguishing their true natures, one may waste a thousand gold pieces and still fail to attain the Dao. Only by understanding the ruler and minister, aligning with the essentials of Qian and Kun, will the art of the Great Elixir become clear.

Moreover, lead serves as the ruler, guiding the five viscera; mercury serves as the minister, slaying the Three Thieves, communicating with the divine, and illuminating the Four Seas. Thus, the *Xuanren Jue* states: "Use lead without using lead, for the five metals are born within lead."

"Use lead without using lead, for the five metals emerge from within lead." This is the most profound of sayings. The wise examine and understand it, then know the Dao may be accomplished.

"Use lead without using lead"—lead is the essence of the five metals, the fine catalyst of the seven treasures. Now, the Great Elixir is coeval with heaven and earth, yet the five metals are strictly forbidden in lead. With what, then, shall they be refined?

The *Song of the Five Metals* states: "Take Yellow Sprout as the root." What is Yellow Sprout? And what vessel should be used? Yellow Sprout is not lead, yet it is not apart from lead.

Hu Gangzi asked: "With what is it made?" And again: "If not the five metals and eight stones, what gives rise to it?"

Master Wei answered: "To sow grain, one must use millet. Without like kind, nothing can be achieved. If one uses the five metals and eight stones, it is like a fox or hare giving birth to a horse, or a sparrow hatching a phoenix—what difference is there from mending a cauldron with glue or treating illness with wild aconite? Different kinds do not share the same nature; how can they unite as one body? To transmute metal, one must use metal; to refine silver, one must use silver. Only when Yellow Sprout is obtained within lead does one know this Dao as intimate.

If the lead is true, it does not lose its minister; if the lead is not true, its mercury will not be intimate. The White Tiger serves as the brain, Yellow Sprout as the root, the Green-Waisted Messenger, and the Red-Blooded General—this is cinnabar within blue-green mercury, not the use of azurite.

If one attains this art, guard it well. Should it be leaked, one’s lifespan will be cut short, and calamity will befall one’s descendants." The *Yin Fu Jing* states: "The master says: Do not share it with those who walk a different path. Keep it secret, lest misfortune be invited."

Those who aspire to the Dao, moved by utmost sincerity, may comprehend its meaning and know the Great Dao is difficult to seek, rarely grasped by the world. The world’s people are foolish and deluded, blind to its principles. Though they pore over alchemical texts, none succeed. Why? First, they have not met a true master; second, they rely on vague imaginings and proceed on their own—many are of this sort.

I once saw Sima Xiyi on Mount Song refining the Great Elixir. Delighted, I sought him out and asked, but the firing had already lasted five months. When I questioned him, he remained secretive. How could I clarify this Dao? I feared this man’s emptiness would waste days, and after long observation, saw no success.

He claimed: "The Great Dao has three aspects, two internal and one external to observe." Thus, he used realgar within lead and mercury. This was not the wondrous subtlety of the Great Medicine, merely chasing shadows and following texts on his own.

I also saw Master Li Zixu add sulfur to the two ingredients, likewise claiming one aspect was internal to observe. Neither of these two had the correct understanding; their transmissions were flawed.

I pitied and lamented them: their natures were impure, their edges unrefined, and they strayed from the path, isolating themselves, ultimately gaining no longevity. That "one internal to observe" refers to the Wuji crucible. These men did not comprehend it, yet proceeded in vain, their hair turning white in futility. Had they not met me, it would not have been my fault—it was simply that their Dao did not align.

The *Song of the Five Metals* states: "It is not that the medicine lacks sanctity, but that the medicine may not be correct. Do not fear the medicine lacks numinosity, but that the medicine may not be true."

If the wise comprehend this principle, they are true, spiritually attuned immortals. What worry is there that the Dragon-Tiger Great Elixir will not be achieved? Truly, one may hold the sun and moon in hand, and creation follows the heart—this is no empty saying.

As for the Elixir, the *True Writ of Dragon and Tiger* states: "The Tiger is true lead; the Dragon is true mercury. Reverse lead to become Yellow Sprout; reverse mercury to become true mercury. True lead does not wither; true mercury does not fly." This is not the mercury of the mundane world, having transcended all worldly dust.

The *Song of Ma Ziran* says:
"Mercury lives, cinnabar dies;
Lead, through the numinous sprout, is.
Emerging as the Returned Elixir,
The deluded cannot grasp it.
Mercury and cinnabar differ—
The deluded use them clumsily.
If one understands this true source,
One may transcend the vulgar world."

Later scholars, if they do not meet a true master, will not receive the transmission!

The oral formula states: Take eight ounces of lead as yang, as Qian, as the Tiger; and eight ounces of mercury as yin, as Kun, as the Green Dragon. These two substances are capable of transformation.

Lead is also yin, originally black—water is one yin. Yet it contains one yang line. Mercury is wood, three; cinnabar is fire, two. Fire contains yin. Thus, the medicine inherently possesses yin and yang, mutually restraining and subduing, becoming the supreme medicine. These two numinous substances are the true images of heaven and earth’s yin and yang. How could the eight stones and four yellows serve as the Elixir?

The wise should consider this carefully. This is the true mother of all ancient immortals and transcendents. Thus, Qian and Kun, firm and yielding, unite Dragon and Tiger. Eight ounces belong to Qian, eight ounces to Kun. One ounce has four parts, each part six *zhu*. One part corresponds to one hexagram, one ounce to four hexagrams, and eight ounces to thirty-two hexagrams. Qian’s eight ounces correspond to thirty-two hexagrams, as do Kun’s eight ounces, together forming sixty-four hexagrams—the root of the Dao.

Two eights make one *jin*, corresponding to sixty-four hexagrams. There are three hundred eighty-four *zhu*, symbolizing a year’s three hundred sixty days. The ancient immortals observed the *Yi*’s images, uniting Qian and Kun, aligning with the solar terms. A year’s great cycle completes the celestial revolution. How could the four yellows and eight stones correspond to Qian’s image?

The oral formula states: "Yellow Sprout one, mercury two, wood three, fire two, water one, metal four, earth five—modeling heaven and earth." Herein lies the principle: neither solitary yin nor solitary yang will suffice.

Another formula states: "White metal as ruler is the essence of black metal, the position of the west, the essence of the great yang." The *Jinbi Jing* says: "Refine silver from lead, and numinous substances arise of themselves. In the ash pool’s blazing heat, lead sinks and silver floats."

"When purity reveals the treasure, the Yellow Sprout may be wrought. It is also cryptically called *Yellow Light*, or *Yellow Sprout*, or *Autumn Stone*. Autumn is the position of the west, and *Stone* is the name of the trigram *Dui*; its nature is yin, yet within yin lies yang—this is the supreme medicinal sprout of long life, the origin of the ten thousand things, hence called *sprout*. When green, through the action of fire, turns white and then yellow, it is named *Yellow Sprout*. The Prince of Huainan called it *Autumn Stone*; Wang Yang obtained it and named it *Yellow Sprout*; the Perfected One Mu Gu called it *Returned Elixir*.

From *The Essence of the Supreme Elixir’s Discourse, Chapter on the Heart-Mirror of Joyful Unity*:
'What numinous power do these two substances possess that they may serve as the Great Elixir?'
The Perfected One replied: 'Gold, refined nine times from lead, receives its full measure of water and fire qi. Mercury, in the midst of the Great Yang, receives its full measure of qi. These two substances, each having received qi in full from yin and yang, are gathered by the sage as the Great Medicine. Harmonized and placed in an earthen vessel, with water and fire ascending and descending above and below, the work is completed—through a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes, they must not encounter their like nor follow their kind. When the dragon hums, clouds arise; when the tiger roars, winds are born. The Dao’s mutual resonance cannot occur without proper pairing. If one mixes in miscellaneous minerals, hoping to transmute them into treasure, even after eons it will not succeed. This is the method of the Perfected Ones of the Great Antiquity, not to be transmitted even for a thousand gold. Thus is the Golden Elixir proven!'

*Discourse on the Golden Elixir, Chapter Three*"

The cinnabar is the essence of the Great Yang, having originally received the true qi of the Great Yang. Through fire, it turns white, standing at the head of the Azure Emperor’s domain, taking the name of mercury—this is wood born of fire, containing inherent virtue that attains numinosity. Lead, transformed from black essence, holds the proper position of west and bedrock-metal, for metal gives rise to water, and water to wood. These two substances naturally match each other—without the utmost numinosity and sageliness, how could the elixir be formed?

Common fools often ask: how can consuming the Golden Elixir grant longevity and enduring vision? I have long pitied and lamented them. Since ancient times, all Perfected Ones and sages cultivated the elixir for long life—though hundreds of thousands knew of it, could they truly disbelieve? They point to Qin Shihuang and Han Wudi, yet the numinous power of the Great Elixir cannot save those who bring ruin upon themselves. Long ago, Liu Xuanmu served Master Wei, tending the fire for a year, but his reckless doubts led him to miss the Way and die young. Xu Jingxiu, diligent in heart and accumulating virtue, never resting from dawn to dusk, received the elixir from his teacher and attained immortality on Mount Taibai, where he has lived for over a thousand years. These two men—one doubted what should not be doubted—separated by a foot, yet worlds apart in attainment. Gain and loss, success and failure, are as distant as cloud and mud. This analogy should suffice to inspire belief.

When yang spring emerges and the seasonal decree unfolds, the myriad things receive the qi of spring—flowers fall, seeds form, and through this qi, they bear fruit fit for human consumption. Is this not visible to the eye and natural in its workings? Even the five grains sustain human life, yet how can one witness their effects and still deny them? How much more so the supreme elixir and numinous cinnabar—consuming them transforms mortal bones into those of a Perfected One!

Yet世人 remain deluded, forgetting their purpose, disbelieving and neglecting cultivation, failing to encounter the Way and thus failing to act. They squander a hundred lifetimes, sinking through countless kalpas—how tragic! Coveting glory and fame, pursuing sensual desires, bound by the snares of reputation and profit, their forms wither and their essences decay. The Three Officials seize their lives, and the courts of the underworld impose punishment—how then can they attain longevity? Those who scheme deceitfully, harming others to build their own fortunes, or who seize another’s merit to advance their own ends—how could they ever encounter a Perfected One to transmit the teachings?

Only by refining the heart, calming the mind, and gathering the passions to return to the Dao can one meet such a teacher. Those who slander the virtuous, disturb the innocent—how could they ever hear of these truths? Even the five grains, though decaying matter, nourish spirit and qi to sustain life—how much more so the divine elixir, with its primal and mysterious virtue, which exchanges mortal flesh for the immortal, sheds sickly form, preserves youth, and extends life? To you I speak of these things—what is seen is known! I need not expound at length, for such details would only burden the discourse. The remaining subtleties and mysteries of the void are all inscribed upon the golden tablets.

Xu Jun, Master Wei, and Lord Chungan—these three each mastered the supreme arts and were disciples of the immortals. Xie Xuanchong and Su Tang, the two youths, were likewise adepts of feather-transformation and golden elixirs, known to all—what need is there to speak further of them? Moreover, in famous mountains and bustling markets, there are often those who dwell beyond the mundane, concealing their names and identities amidst the worldly crowd. Unless one shares the same Dao, how could one recognize them? Be cautious—do not lightly disclose or slight these matters, lest you incur fault and bring slander upon the golden elixir and the sages, plunging yourself into the prison of a thousand kalpas!

Have you not heard what the *Cantong qi* says: "Gold and cinnabar serve as the foundation, harmonized with mercury." These two substances are inherently numinous! And again: "If one does not use medicinal herbs but the Five Phases, these are none other than Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth." Have you not also heard: "White Horse Tooth is fine cinnabar; at *mao* and *you*, the two eights unite as one." Or that Huainan refined *qiushi*, and the Yellow Emperor praised *jinhua*? And further: "Lead is not the sprout, the sprout is not lead; true lead and true cinnabar, when subdued and refined, become one family." As the fire cycles near nine revolutions, the Yellow Sprout is thus formed. Or that "fire flowers into white medicine, red flowers flow as mercury," and the stones naturally correspond? "Flowing pearls enter the body, the tiger devours them—who knows where to find the Golden Lord?"

Since ancient times, those who refine the elixir have struggled to fathom the nature of lead and mercury. Yet if one grasps this principle, the work of refinement becomes spontaneously numinous. "A solitary yang cannot transform alone; a solitary yin cannot achieve completion. Originally, these two substances were one—naturally, they transform the body and reveal its brightness." When dragon and tiger meet, how could they not attend to one another? "White liquid and the other mutually consume, consuming each other as husband and wife." Following their transformation, the Yellow Sprout is born, ever dependent on the Later Earth. If one obtains the Purple River Chariot, one becomes the herald of immortals.

Once the divine elixir’s secret is mastered, its numinous use lies within one’s power. "Life and death rest in my hands"—ponder this, and you will know it to be true. Without the proper method, refining the elixir will only exhaust the heart and spirit year after year. Do not waste effort on dead lead and mercury, casting your labor to the dust. "Within the heavens, earth, sun, and moon, the divine medicine is called the Golden Lord. The Golden Lord is none other than lead, originally concealed within it." Clearly I tell you this, yet the deluded remain heedless. "To fix mercury within lead, the golden flowers roughly correspond—yet these flowers are not the medicine, and to pursue them is to squander effort in vain."

These are the arts of immortals—how could they not be profoundly efficacious? Study the *Cantong qi* closely, and follow the ancient categories in harmony. Once you grasp the principle of true lead, your practice will surely reach its culmination. "Lead and mercury unite with heaven and earth to refine the Great Return Elixir. When the elixir is complete, the sprout appears of itself—without this, success is truly difficult." The True One of Great Antiquity spoke thus; now, having witnessed it, I rejoice. Only then does one know the spirits do not deceive, and one must trust that the Dao will bring peace. "Within it lies the five-colored numen, its transformations subduing all patterns. After ten months, the embryo emerges—whoever beholds it is awestruck."

I report to you, child of glory: a hundred years wither and decay. Why idly abandon the world, listlessly letting the Dao slip away? Who says your words are empty, your principles mere rambling? I see the dust of Mount Nan, piled over the years into a mountain. Amidst the vast苦 sea, birth and death churn as waves. Since ancient times, even the dwellings of emperors and kings—what remains of them today?

"In the crucible, the white liquid transforms; the Yellow Sprout gradually takes form." Recall the day they first met—how difficult it was to discern the shape of mercury! "When yang reaches its extreme, yin fire is born; when fire wanes, yang qi merges. Of itself, it becomes the Purple River Chariot—consuming it grants longevity."

In the first month, the white liquid congeals like snow; in the second, it resembles milk curdling into butter, slowly solidifying. By the third month, the medicine is half-contained, buds unfurling like dangling pearls. In the fourth, the two substances embrace, like blood being infused. By the fifth, they soar and cling to their mother, their cries mournful. In the sixth, they reach the womb, yin qi severed—its color distinct, like that of a gosling. In the seventh, yin descends, receiving qi, hands and feet stiffening. By the eighth, the organs and viscera form, blood congealing like gold. In the ninth, residual pearls grow hair; by the tenth, mother and child are poised to part. At this time, the mother is weary, but the child’s body is whole—its complexion still as snow.

After the lead sheds its placenta, its surface is white as snow. Further temper it in the crucible, a process called "nursing with milk," which delights the skin and flesh. Expel the child’s toxic qi according to the method. When the medicine is complete, it turns crimson—after sixty days, the toxins are purged, and it may be consumed. This medicine, like a child in the womb, sharpens the spirit and clarifies the bones and flesh.

I urge you, seeker: you must be meticulous. Do not idly squander your days and months. The subtleties herein cannot be fully expressed; there is an order—do not neglect or transgress it. If you can refine the Yellow Sprout to completion, its transformative power will never cease. Consuming it grants longevity, turns white hair black, produces silver, aids the lonely and inept. The virtuous who obtain it never falter in their practice. In harmony with the Dao, they delve into past causes, transmitting it only to the worthy, whose hearts are true.

Those who lack the Dao—if they incur fault, they will sink into calamity, even if they gain it, misfortune will assail them. To grasp the workings of creation is no easy task; it cannot be casually transmitted. Have you not heard the ancients’ words? To recklessly transmit it brings disaster upon seven generations. You must believe, not doubt. Only those whose kidneys are luminous and unobstructed will attain it.

Today, I charge you with a thousand cautions—remember them clearly, as if bound by a solemn pact. "Yang begins its return in the eleventh month, when the fire is first applied. Yin arises in the fifth month, after yang reaches its peak from the eleventh to the fourth month. The crucible is entrusted to the central *wu* and *ji* (Earth). Within the earthen cauldron, above and below interact—guard it diligently, secure it to prevent escape. Observe the seasons and nodes without fail."

"Dragon and tiger race together; the infant is tranquil, its countenance youthful. The mother’s nurturing determines her own plumpness or emaciation, and the child’s completion depends on the mother’s aid." When yang reaches *qian*, yin reaches *kun*; *qian* embodies the four images, the gate of the *Yi*. The sixty-four hexagrams are revered in the midst of practice.

Dragon and tiger spray each other, mutually devouring; in this fixed position they arise and abide. Water and fire serve as mediators, gathering my soul; yin and yang nurture me through dawn and dusk. The eight solar terms shift between cold and warmth—watch closely as the yellow sprout’s root gradually takes form. Day by day, the mother’s gratitude quickens; through this, the fruit solidifies and the true gate is established. For a thousand autumns and ten thousand years, it begets descendants—guard it in secrecy, take care, and speak no further of it.

This Dao is profound and subtle, beyond words. The people of this age mock it as turbid and confused. Better to dwell in seclusion among markets and villages than to reveal the wondrous elixir to the vulgar, who upon seeing it would slander it with reckless speech. You must remember: conceal it well, as if sealing it in a golden casket. The art of longevity is passed only to those who walk the Way, for heaven’s officials have already recorded their names.

**Chapter Four: The Essence of the Great Return Elixir**
To speak of the Return Elixir is to speak of an elixir that, when ingested, grants transcendence. Since ancient times, the immortals of heaven have preserved this treasure, bestowing it upon the human realm. It was transmitted to the Yellow Emperor, who, having attained it, ascended to heaven in broad daylight at Mount Dinghu. The ancient immortals who achieved this are too numerous to name individually.

The Return Elixir is forged from the most potent medicines: the mysterious pearl of cinnabar, the numinous marvels of golden lead and mercurial tiger. There exists a celestial Return Elixir, naturally formed in the mountains where the sun’s back faces yin and its front faces yang. Cinnabar is born only in the south, never in the northern lands. The natural Return Elixir arises when flowing mercury embraces the Golden Elder and conceives. Where cinnabar is found, lead and silver also exist. After four thousand three hundred and twenty years, the elixir matures—male on the left, female on the right—with cinnabar above and malachite below, cradling the qi of the sun and moon, yin and yang. After another four thousand three hundred and twenty years, its base turns black, and the celestial Return Elixir of the immortals is complete.

For earthbound immortals, refining lead and mercury takes but a year. Fire is applied in the eleventh month, when yang first revives, and the elixir is completed by the following eleventh month—a cycle mirroring the celestial immortals, heavenly beings, and sages who partake of the natural Return Elixir. Thus, the natural Return Elixir is consumed by immortals, heavenly beings, and sages, while modern practitioners emulate this process to achieve the same end. Ingesting it grants longevity and transformation, equaling the heavens in merit.

**Question:** Why does a single year mirror the celestial cycle of the Return Elixir’s formation?
**Answer:** In the heavens, one day and night equals five years among humans. Here below, one year consists of twelve months, three hundred sixty days, one month of thirty days, and one day of twelve hours—totaling three hundred sixty hours per month. Thus, a year comprises four thousand three hundred twenty hours, mirroring the celestial formation of the natural Return Elixir. This method, passed down by the true immortals of the heavens, allows those on earth who follow the proper discipline to refine the essence of the sun and moon, the qi of the four seasons, and achieve longevity through ingestion. The superior practitioner aligns with truth, transforming and ascending; the middling practitioner becomes an earthbound immortal; the inferior practitioner attains extended life without death. The gateway of ingestion has its own distinct methods.

**Chapter Five: The Mysterious Record**

Chisongzi said: The essence of cinnabar contains both white and vermilion. When it embraces fire and turns white, it is the White Tiger; when it is called vermilion, it is the Fire Elixir. Mercury is born within cinnabar—these three share a single body. The White Tiger is metal, symbolizing the *gen* of the western direction, containing the auspiciousness of the five colors and encompassing the marvels of the eight minerals. Lead is the White Tiger, matched as an equal to mercury. These two substances serve as sovereign and minister; heaven and earth as husband and wife, as mother and child. Refined with divine subtlety, they do not belong to the Three Yellows nor to the category of the eight minerals. Distinctly shaped by creation and cultivated through refinement, they become the Return Elixir.

In the past, I encountered a Daoist who transmitted this teaching to me. After practicing it in accordance with the method, I attained transformation and ascension. I dare to sing its secrets in verse:

A divine art, wondrous and hard to fathom,
Lead and mercury—unknown to men.
Lead and mercury are the essence of heaven and earth,
The power of yin and yang, the strength of heaven and earth.
Their merit returns to *wu* and *ji*,
Able to generate all sustenance.
All things rely on the work of earth,
For earth is the ultimate mother,
Nurturing all her children,
And children, too, are rooted in their mother.
The Three Substances naturally attain numinosity,
The two *qi* flow directly from the mysterious origin.
Their efficacy lies in fortifying the city walls,
Their task in discerning firmness and softness.
Success depends on human achievement,
Derived from what the heart recalls.
When the heart is numinous, the elixir becomes numinous;
When the heart is deluded, the elixir remains unfathomable.
The supreme Dao resides in an empty heart,
Within the mysterious, its wonders never cease.
Those of wisdom who grasp its source
Shall one day ascend on cloud-borne wings.

The verse of the Four Noble Sons of the Liang Dynasty states:
Lead and mercury unite in divine work,
Their union returns to the supreme mystery.
Wholly within the Five Phases,
Fully encompassed by the wisdom of the Three Powers.
The immortals leave this gateway of perfection,
Ingestion makes one extraordinary.
If one attains the true lead’s gate,
One’s spirit becomes one with nature.

Here ends *The Heart-Mirror of Elixir Discourse and Secret Essentials*.
