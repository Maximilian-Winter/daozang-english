### **First Transmutation: Refining Cinnabar into Mercury**
Take sixteen taels of luminous cinnabar (that from Chenjinzhou is best) and twelve taels of yellow alum (that from Guazhou is preferred).

**Method:**
Grind the two ingredients separately. First, stir-fry the yellow alum, then pulverize it into powder and spread it across the bottom of the furnace. Next, grind the cinnabar into powder and place it atop the alum, leveling it evenly with a silver spatula. Cover it with another layer of yellow alum powder, two fen thick. Seal the furnace with a small crucible, then apply *liuyi* mud to seal it securely, ensuring no leakage of qi. Once the mud is dry, select an auspicious day and, at the hour of *zi*, place three iron nails atop the crucible before applying fire.

Begin with gentle fire (*wenhuo*) and nurture it for one day and night. Gradually increase to fierce fire (*wuhuo*) and burn for two days and nights. When the furnace glows red throughout, cease the fire and allow it to cool. Open the furnace carefully: the cinnabar will have entirely transformed into mercury. Sweep and collect it. If any residue remains unrefined, repeat the process—cover with yellow alum powder, seal as before, and apply fierce fire for another one or two days until all mercury is extracted. This is called the *Riverbank Crone*.

The *Cantong Qi* states:
*"The Riverbank Crone, numinous and most divine,
Encounters fire and flees, unstained by dust or grime.
Like ghosts concealed, like dragons hidden deep,
None know her whereabouts—until the yellow sprout takes root.*
This speaks of mercury receiving the essence of metal, its sprouts gradually taking form."

### **Second Transmutation: Reverting Mercury to Cinnabar**
For every ten taels of mercury refined above, take three taels of sulfur (stone pavilion fat).

**Method:**
First, grind the sulfur in a new agate vessel until fine as powder. Place it in a crucible and melt it over charcoal fire. Once the sulfur liquefies, slowly add the mercury while stirring vigorously with an iron rod, ensuring the mercury and sulfur fully combine into greenish cinnabar grains. Remove and place in the furnace, cover as before, and seal with *liuyi* mud to prevent leakage. Once the mud is dry, set the crucible atop three nails. Begin with gentle fire for one *fushi* (twelve hours), then gradually increase to fierce fire and burn for two days and nights. When the furnace cools, open it: the mercury will have transformed into luminous, radiant cinnabar.

The *Cantong Qi* states:
*"Cinnabar, the essence of wood, unites with metal’s embrace.
For cinnabar is of metal’s body—nurtured by it, form takes place."*
Some say this means it gradually hardens.

### **Third Transmutation: Refining Cinnabar Back into Mercury**
Take the previously refined cinnabar, grind it to a fine powder, and follow the prior method precisely. Cover it above and below with yellow alum powder, seal with *liuyi* mud, and dry. As in the first transmutation, begin with gentle fire for one day and night, then increase to fierce fire for two days and nights. When the furnace cools, open it: the cinnabar will have reverted to mercury. Collect it carefully in a separate agate vessel and grind. If any residue remains, repeat the process—cover with yellow alum powder, seal, and refine for another one or two days until all mercury is extracted. This is called *Sun’s Flowing Pearl*.

The *Cantong Qi* states:
*"The Sun’s Flowing Pearl ever seeks to flee,
Yet with golden blossoms, it turns to affinity.
Transformed to white liquid, congealed and firm it stands—*
This speaks of thrice-refined mercury. This substance has no fixed nature and readily escapes, but when imbued with the qi of golden blossoms, it gradually assumes form and substance.

### **Fourth Transmutation: Refining Sun’s Flowing Pearl into Cinnabar**
**Method for Boiling Gold and Silver Water:**
Take a silver pot capable of holding one *dou* of water. Add fifty thin sheets of high-grade gold and silver, then boil with eight or nine *sheng* of water for seven days and nights without extinguishing the fire. Once the allotted time passes, reduce the water to three *sheng* and simmer for five days, replenishing as needed until the time is complete. Collect the refined gold-silver water and store it in an agate bottle.

**Method for Preparing the Elixir with Water:**
Take three *sheng* of refined gold-silver water, one small spoon of brine, one *fen* each of *dapeng* sand, malachite, azurite, and chalcanthite, two *fen* each of alum and yellow alum, and one *fen* of saltpeter. Grind all ingredients to a fine powder and combine with the gold-silver water. Simmer at a temperature producing fish-eye bubbles, day and night, for twenty-one days. When the flowing pearls congeal like millet, cease the fire and evaporate all the gold-silver water. If it dries, replenish with water and continue boiling until the time is complete. Scoop out the cinnabar with an iron spoon, strain through silk to collect the congealed portions, and store separately. Any remaining liquid residue should be boiled again until all flowing pearls are fully congealed.

The *Cantong Qi* states:
*"Plant millet with millet’s seed; hatch chicks from their eggs."*

It also states:
*"Like attracts like; discordant matters yield no treasure.
Swallows and sparrows do not hatch phoenixes;
foxes and hares do not nurse colts."*

Annotation: This means that cinnabar and mercury, being of the same essence as gold, must draw upon the essential *qi* of gold and silver to assume their proper form and substance.

**Fifth Transformation: Hardening the Medicinal Sand in the Yin-Yang Crucible**
First, prepare a yin crucible, coating its exterior with refractory clay in strict accordance with the method, and allow it to dry completely. Take the previously prepared medicinal sand, grind it finely, and add the following ingredients: two *fen* of realgar, three *fen* of *hutonglü*, three *fen* of *dapeng* sand, one *fen* of malachite, and one *fen* of saltpeter. Grind all six ingredients to a fine powder and combine them within. Then mix with gold-silver water and brine, replenishing as needed, and simmer with gentle and strong fire, maintaining a temperature producing fish-eye bubbles. Boil continuously for seven full days and nights, then cease the fire and strain out the sand. The process is complete when the sand achieves absolute hardness. Next, place it in the divine chamber and nurture it until it has absorbed 360 breaths of *qi*, at which point it will naturally subdue fire, resisting fragmentation upon melting.

The *Cantong Qi* states:
*"Things devoid of yin and yang defy heaven and forsake their source.
Chicks hatched from eggs alone will never be whole."*

Annotation: This means that without the harmonious interaction of yin and yang *qi*, no thing can come to fruition; form arises only through the union of yin and yang.

**Sixth Transformation: Converting Hardened Sand into Fire-Subduing Yellow Silver**
Take the aforementioned medicinal sand, pound it finely in an iron mortar, and place it in a silver cauldron. Add two *fen* of orpiment, one *sheng* of salt-bitter liquid, and five *sheng* of *xuanming* water. Boil the mixture for fourteen days, replenishing the water as it evaporates. Simmer with a slow fire, maintaining fish-eye bubbles, and vigilantly monitor day and night. The process is complete when the mercury sand takes on a pale yellow hue—avoid allowing it to deepen in color. Though the yellow silver sand may be firm and congealed, it has not yet fully subdued fire. Seal it properly in the divine chamber, then nurture it in an ash pit for seven days. When melted in a crucible, it should not fragment in the slightest, and may be hammered like silver.

The *Cantong Qi* states:
*"Grind and blend them together, lest their red hue be too bright.
Seal them tightly to ensure their union, striving for whiteness and utmost hardness."*

Annotation: Though the yellow silver has hardened, it has not yet subdued fire. Seal it properly in the divine chamber, then nurture it in an ash pit for seven days. When melted in a crucible, it should not fragment in the slightest, and may be hammered like silver.

**Seventh Transformation: Converting Yellow Silver into Red Lead-Gold**
Take the pale yellow silver from the previous step, melt it in a crucible, and cast it into ingots. Hammer these into thin sheets, approximately half a *fen* in thickness. Then take two *liang* of *paosha* and one *sheng* of white salt, dissolve them in two *dou* of water, and soak the yellow silver sheets for fourteen days. Remove them and test their malleability on an anvil; if they exhibit slight brittleness, proceed to the next step. To refine further, first heat the silver sheets until red-hot, then polish them with a piece of antelope horn, moving it back and forth across the surface. If the sheets cool during the process, reheat them briefly and repeat the polishing until they can withstand hammering. Hammer the sheets into thin leaves, as fine as paper, matching the quantity to the amount of gold leaf required.

Next, take two *liang* of *paosha*, one *sheng* of white salt, five *sheng* of red earth, and one *liang* of *hutonglü*. Grind these four ingredients into a fine powder, mix with water-buffalo dung to form a mud-like paste, and layer it repeatedly with the gold leaves until all are used. Cover the arrangement properly and heat it evenly on all sides for over ten days, until the gold turns a pure, deep red, yielding lead-gold.

The *Cantong Qi* states:
*"When gold returns to its original nature, it may be called the Elixir of Return."*

Annotation: This refers to the transmutation of red gold, which, when refined to resemble cinnabar in hue, is termed the Elixir of Return.

**Eighth Transformation: Converting Red Lead-Gold into Gold Powder**
Take one *liang* of the previously prepared gold leaves and combine it with one *liang* of cinnabar-mercury (adjust other ingredients proportionally). Amalgamate the mercury until it consumes the gold leaves, forming a paste-like consistency, and knead it to the thickness of a fingertip. Place each piece in a furnace. First, spread two *liang* of *guanhua* and two *liang* of saltpeter, along with one *liang* of *hutonglü*, all finely ground, in layers within the furnace, separating the gold leaves. Seal the arrangement securely and ensure it is airtight. Once the furnace is dry, apply a gentle fire and sublime the mixture for three days and nights. Allow the furnace to cool completely before proceeding.

**Ninth Transformation** *(Text missing)*

**Method for Preparing Refined Mirabilite Powder**
Take two *liang* of unrefined mirabilite and one *liang* of white *guan*. Combine the two ingredients and decoct them until they resemble *guanhua*; this is called refined mirabilite powder. When ready for use, soak and decoct it in water, for this substance cannot be stored long. After fourteen days or more, its *qi* dissipates, rendering it unusable.

For the boiled cinnabar-mercury amalgam, continue decocting it in refined mirabilite water for a full fourteen days, until the cinnabar-mercury’s body becomes as hard as stone. If it hardens before fourteen days, this indicates the *qi* of saltpeter has been fully expelled. There is no need to adhere strictly to fourteen days and nights—sometimes, after three or two days and nights, it hardens like stone. This occurs when the fire is too intense, exhausting the saltpeter’s *qi*, and even without decocting in refined mirabilite water, it will suffice. In some cases, after decocting for nearly fourteen days, the saltpeter’s *qi* is only then fully expelled, and it begins to harden. The saltpeter is difficult to expel because its *qi* can dissolve metal and stone into water, making complete expulsion challenging. If not applied, other stones will also be difficult to expel fully. Adding a small amount of mercury, though it hardens, requires careful observation.
