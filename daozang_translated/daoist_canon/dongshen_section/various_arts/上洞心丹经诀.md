# 上洞心丹经诀

The present text emerged during the Tang and Song dynasties, compiled from excerpts of the *Baopuzi Neipian* and *Huangdi Jiuding Shendan Jingjue*, among others, and falsely attributed to the hand of the Primordial Perfected One’s descendant. It comprises three scrolls. The source text is from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, under the "Miscellaneous Arts" category of the *Dongshen* section.

**Upper Scroll of the *Upper Cavern Heart Elixir Manual***
*Transcribed by the Descendant of the Primordial Perfected One*

The Immortal Elder said: To seek transcendence, one must grasp the essentials. The essentials lie in treasuring essence, circulating qi, and ingesting the great elixir. Though it is said to circulate qi, there are dozens of methods for doing so, but the crux lies in returning essence to replenish the brain. Though it is said to ingest qi, there are over a hundred techniques for doing so, but the crux lies in embryonic respiration. Though it is said to ingest elixirs, there are over a thousand formulas, but the crux lies in the Golden Fluid Returned Elixir.

The manual states: The dozens of methods for treasuring essence and circulating qi are not recorded here in full. Their essential principle lies in returning essence to replenish the brain. The method requires practice during the six yang hours after midnight and before noon, or between midnight and the hour of the ox, or when the qi in one’s body is nascent—this is most effective. At such times, enter stillness, and it may be practiced regardless of whether one is walking, standing, sitting, or lying down. One must maintain inner and outer purity, concentrating the qi to achieve the suppleness of an infant. Then, starting from the Jade Hall and the Tail Gate, kindle the fire and circulate qi, passing directly through the Double Pass of the Spine, ascending into the Three Peaks, and reaching the Jade Capital Mountain. With prolonged practice, the brain will naturally become full. The wondrous Way of the Three Ones and Nine Chambers truly lies herein.

The manual states: There are over a hundred methods for ingesting qi, such as "Marrying the Azure Mist," "Central Yellow and Mysterious Yellow," "Vast and Flowing Han," "Purple Radiance and Green Sprout," "Revering the Numinous Moon," "Spiritual Brilliance and Respectful Flame," "Nine Manifestations and Five Essences"—all techniques of qi ingestion, which cannot be easily expounded in detail. Yet embryonic respiration is the essential method among them. At the outset, one must enter stillness during the time of the *Zhen* trigram, or practice regardless of whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, but always maintaining inner and outer purity, concentrating the qi to achieve the suppleness of an infant. Then, as if dwelling in the mother’s womb, breathe at the root of the Mysterious Female, continuously and subtly. With prolonged practice, one will achieve 13,500 breaths, each breath entering the embryo. Each of the twelve double-hours and hundred quarters of the day must be harmonized. In lesser attainment, the bones become upright, the sinews supple, the skin smooth as congealed fat, all illnesses are repelled, and one’s years are prolonged without death. In greater attainment, one enters water without drowning, enters fire without burning, sheds the mortal frame and changes the bones, conceals or reveals the form at will, manifests a body beyond the body, and unites with the Dao as a true being. This Way lies within human capacity.

These two essential manuals summarize the essentials of the inner elixir.

The manual states: The Immortal Elder said that though there are a thousand formulas for ingesting elixirs, how could a novice comprehend them all? The essential principle lies in the Golden Fluid Returned Elixir. Since ancient times, none who have attained perfection and realized the Dao to become immortals have succeeded without the Golden Fluid Returned Elixir. This Golden Fluid Returned Elixir is an external elixir. The supreme method of the ancient sages involves generating existence from non-existence to create the Golden Fluid Returned Elixir. This was transmitted heart-to-heart by the sages of antiquity, leaving no written record, and remains most secret. It is not something the common or unlearned can know or achieve. The methods of the furnace, crucible, cauldron, and vessel, as well as the techniques for gathering ingredients and advancing the fire, truly cannot be lightly disclosed in speech or writing. Once this elixir is accomplished, one may ascend with their entire household, and their transformations are beyond measure.

The next method is the Nine Cauldrons’ Flying and Concealing Golden Fluid Returned Elixir. This, too, is transmitted orally by sages and worthies, for how could it be fully expressed in writing? It involves extracting the Mysterious Yellow Essence, preparing the Six-and-One Clay, sealing the earthen crucible, securing the divine furnace, creating the Flower Pool, generating divine water, brewing the Spring Wine, fermenting the Left Flavor, gathering medicinal materials, advancing the fire phases, and all the methods of flying, concealing, and returning the Golden Fluid. This is not something the ignorant or common can achieve.

Now, the Immortal Elder’s treasured *Heart Elixir Formula* from the Jade Peak is recorded in the *Supreme Upper Cavern Scripture of the Immortals* and is a secondary formula for the Golden Fluid Returned Elixir. Its ingredients are the foremost in nature and flavor among the Nine Cauldrons and the finest among the Eight Stones. With proper preparation and refinement, and without admixture, using only this single treasure, after nine cycles of refinement, the Golden Fluid Returned Elixir is achieved. From bone-transformation to ascension, the process is orderly, guiding true immortals to ascend into the Great Clarity. Though distinct in method from the Golden Fluid Returned Elixir generated from non-existence, it converges in effect and function, embodying the wondrous subtlety of the unburdensome supreme Way. Truly, it is a rare immortal formula in the world.

The Immortal Elder said: The method of transmission requires selecting an auspicious day of flourishing vitality. First, purify oneself through fasting and bathing, establish an altar, and set up a seat for the Supreme One above water in a secluded place. Burn incense and make an offering, declaring the intention to transmit the Way of longevity to so-and-so, along with the elixir scripture and tokens of oath, placing them on the altar. Have the recipient face north and prostrate for one double-hour. If the sky is clear and windless, the transmission may proceed. Drink the blood of a white rooster as an oath, and cast the tokens into the water. Those without immortal bones will never behold the Way of the inner and outer Golden Fluid Returned Elixir. Thus, my master said that in each generation, no more than two or three may receive it. It was also said that within the Eight Directions, how few have seen or known these secret manuals. Few indeed hear of them, and transmission requires a solemn oath. The medicine of longevity and transcendence is most sacred and weighty, not to be exchanged for ten thousand gold, and must be entrusted only to the worthy. If transmitted, it may be passed to one person within a hundred years, with an oath sworn in blood, before the transmission is made.

Should any initiate betray or leak these secrets, Heaven’s Emperor shall punish them, forever barring their ascent upon the Mysterious Path. The Envoys of the Great Mystery Celestial Capital shall strike the oath-breaker with confusion and madness. Ruin and death shall follow, for the Immortal Lords shall cloud their spirit and dull their mind, rendering all their studies vain. The Grand Recorder of the Three Heavens and the Deities of Fate shall erase their allotted years and cut short their lifespan; all their works shall fail, and they shall suffer punishment in the Great Mystery Capital.

The Immortal Elder said: To compound the divine elixir, one must do so in the depths of mountains and marshes, or in remote wilderness where no one dwells. If working among men, it must be within high walls and thick enclosures, so that neither inside nor outside may witness it—this too is permissible. Companions should number no more than two or three. First, observe a seven-day fast, bathe in the five fragrant waters, and maintain utmost purity. Avoid all contact with the defiled—those in mourning, the newly dead, or households of marriage. Do not come or go among them.

The Immortal Elder said: To procure the divine medicines, first observe a seven-day fast. Bathe on a *zi* or *chou* day, and purchase them on the day of the ruling stem. Sit in a place of lunar virtue, and do not haggle over price.

The Mysterious Woman said: The fifth day of the fifth month is most auspicious for compounding the elixir. Begin on the seventh day of the seventh month. The best days are *jiazi*, *dingsi*, and *kai* or *chu* days; *jiashen*, *yisi*, and *yimao* are next. Avoid the following inauspicious days for elixir-making: in spring, *wuchen* and *jisi*; in summer, *dingsi*, *wushen*, *renchen*, and *weiwei*; in autumn, *wuxu*, *xinhai*, and *gengzi*; in winter, *wuyin*, *jiwei*, *guimao*, and *guiyou*. Also avoid the monthly executioner, the seasonal divisions of heaven, the four *meng* and *zhong* months, the *ji* month’s harvest, *renwu*, *bingxu*, *guihai*, *xinsi*, the monthly establishment, and all new and full moons. These are all ill-omened and must not be used to kindle the fire or compound the divine elixir.

Take care not to associate with the vulgar and foolish, nor with those of jealous disposition or loose tongues. Do not let unbelievers in the Dao hear of it, lest the divine elixir fail to form. Once the divine elixir is complete, you shall become a Perfected One—able to ascend to heaven or plunge into the abyss, transforming at will. Your entire household may attain transcendence, not merely yourself.

The common folk cling to wealth and reject the elixir, placing their faith in herbal medicines. Yet herbs rot when buried, soften when boiled, and char when burned—they cannot even preserve themselves, how then can they preserve man? They may cure illness and replenish *qi*, but death remains inevitable. The essentials of the Returned Elixir’s Way are beyond the ken of ordinary men.

Man, shaped in heaven and earth, is the noblest of beings. Bound to age swiftly and die, yet if well-nurtured, may live. Life is precious; death is to be feared. Thus, the most secret and weighty of Daoist teachings is none other than the method of longevity. And of all methods for longevity, none surpasses the Way of the Divine Elixir. If this Way does not grant long life, then no long life has ever existed.

Life is one’s own greatest boon. In terms of true worth, even a dukedom cannot compare. Weighing its value, even a kingdom’s bounty cannot match a century of life. Thirty thousand days—yet in youth, one knows nothing; in old age, joy loses its savor. Between infancy and senility, scarcely a few decades remain for peace and laughter—eight or nine thousand days at most. Life flashes by like lightning. Of those who reach a hundred years, barely one in ten thousand does so. Even if one attains it, a single day’s sorrow may overshadow all.

Thus, the superior person’s first duty is to secure the matter of long life. Once settled, one may act freely—whether to ascend as an immortal or to enjoy the world, matching Peng Zu’s years or Lord Shao’s distant longevity. One may keep a wife and children, hold office, uphold propriety above and below, and not lose the joys of human relations—truly a grand endeavor.

The human body is easily harmed and difficult to nurture. Countless forces assail it: excessive depletion, violent uprooting, the spirit worn by agitation, *ying* and *wei* consumed by overuse. The body’s vessels are scorched and eroded, harmony is lost. Improper diet, overindulgence in *ying* and *wei*, sleeping in drafts or dampness—these breed illness in the vital organs. Then one entrusts their life to herbal physicians or seeks aid in sacrifices, like digging a well when thirsty on a hilltop, or setting a trap when starving in barren fields. What can herbs repair? What can ghosts and spirits remedy? If life could be extended by herbs, all physicians would live forever. If illness could be cured by sacrifices, no shaman would ever fall sick.

Thus, the scriptures say: Long life does not lie in sacrifices or prayers, nor in solemn vows and empty words. The Way of nurturing life lies solely in the divine elixir. To know it is not easy; to practice it is truly difficult. Many who study the Dao advance little and retreat much. Those who begin are many; those who persevere are few. Like a well that never reaches the spring, it remains a forsaken well.

Thus, it is not that long life is hard to hear of—once heard, the difficulty lies in practice. Yet the true challenge is not in practicing, but in persisting to the end. Without utmost clarity, one cannot discern it; without utmost diligence, one cannot learn it. If it were easily obtained, Emperor Wu of Han would have succeeded with Lord Shao. If it were easily understood, Liu Xiang would have mastered it from the *Pillow Book*. Thus, the Yellow Emperor ascended Mount Kongtong to seek the Dao; Yu the Great sealed golden tablets in a jade casket. Some achieved merit and ascended; others perfected the Way and departed as immortals. These are the proven methods of the ancients—the Way of long life. Without devoted effort, merely dabbling in peripheral arts is futile.

The time must not be lost; delay not even a day. Among all worldly pursuits, only long life is truly weighty. Once the divine elixir is complete, it endures with heaven and earth.

The Immortal Elder said: Those who refine *lingsha* in the world extract mercury from cinnabar and combine it with sulfur in an eight-to-two ratio to form *lingsha*. Even a single transmutation allows the adept to attain spiritual communion—hence its name, *lingsha*.

The foolish who consume it find all ailments cured. When refined to nine transmutations, it is called the Returned Elixir. Prepared and ingested according to the method, it enables transformation and ascension. Sulfur, being the fire’s essence, merges with the solar qi to generate this elixir. Cinnabar embodies the true color of the south, embodying the sun’s pure essence, containing the supreme spirit of heaven and earth, and ranking as the highest grade among immortal medicines. Within it lies the sulfur’s body and contained mercury; when refined through nine transmutations according to the immortal formula, it becomes true *lingsha*. The adept who consumes it ascends to immortality in days, soaring to the Great Clarity—its merit defies description.

*Upper Cavern Supreme Heart Elixir Secret Formula*
According to the *Materia Medica*, cinnabar is sweet in taste, slightly cold, and non-toxic. It governs the treatment of all diseases of the five viscera and the body, nourishes the spirit, calms the hun and po souls, augments qi, brightens the eyes, unblocks the blood vessels, relieves vexation and fullness, quenches thirst, replenishes essence, beautifies the complexion, expels malevolent spirits and evil ghosts, eliminates acute abdominal pain, toxic qi, scabies, ulcers, and sores. Long-term consumption connects one to the divine, prevents aging, lightens the body, and leads to immortality. When refined into the Returned Elixir or Golden Liquid according to immortal formulas, it kills the Three Corpses and Nine Worms within the abdomen, eradicates all diseases, restores white hair to black, regrows fallen teeth, reverses aging, and extends life without death. The immortal sheds their mortal form and transforms their bones; at noon, their shadow vanishes. Those who first consume it live a hundred years; after three transmutations, three hundred years; after five, five hundred years; after seven, a thousand years. When the ninefold elixir is complete and one’s merit is perfected, they ascend in flight. In ancient times, Li Shaojun lived for several hundred years among men, while Yin Changsheng reached four hundred, traveling with his wife and children across prefectures and commanderies. Of old, over eighty households ascended with their dwellings, and those who ascended in broad daylight are too numerous to record—such proofs have long been evident.

The Immortal Inquiry states: For all elixir-making and firing, offer a sacrifice beside the furnace. Use five *sheng* of fine white wine, three *jin* each of beef and mutton jerky, three *sheng* of millet rice, three *sheng* of jujubes, one *dou* of pears, thirty hard-boiled chicken eggs, and three carp, each weighing three *jin*. Arrange these on three trays, with two bowls per tray. Bow twice and pray: *"This humble servant [Name] reverently invokes the Great Dao Lord, Lord Lao, and the Lord of Supreme Harmony. This humble servant, coveting life and delighting in the Dao, refines the divine elixir. May it be granted that the medicine neither flies away nor perishes, that all is subdued by fire, that the elixir becomes excellent, transforming at hand, with gold and silver fully subdued. By consuming the elixir, may I ascend as an immortal, attend the Purple Palace, enjoy boundless longevity, and attain the rank of Perfected One."* After offering the wine and bowing twice again, present all red and orange fruits, citrus, and pomelos. Once done, proceed with elixir-making and firing as prescribed.

*Heart Elixir*
Select the finest cinnabar, bright red and the size of a small bean, in any quantity. Some say a *jin* and a half, divided by weight, suffices. Boil it with rootless grass—purple-backed duckweed. The amount of grass should match the cinnabar’s weight; decoct it into a thick liquid, enough to soak the cinnabar for fourteen days. Each morning, warm the grass decoction and soak the cinnabar for another fourteen days, keeping it warm throughout. Use only the original decoction, adding no more. When the days are complete, discard the liquid, dry the cinnabar in the sun, and place it into the divine chamber.

*Method for Making the Divine Chamber*
Take eight good chicken eggs, soak them in vinegar, lightly remove the shell’s membrane, and open a small hole at the top, about the size of a little finger. Gently pour out the yolk and white, wash and dry them thoroughly. Then grind fine Beijing ink into a thick ink solution, pour it into the eggs, and swirl to coat the interior completely. Dry them slightly over a fire until fully black. If not black enough, repeat the ink coating three times for best results—this is the *kunqian* paper method. Select four of the best for holding the medicine; use the rest as lids. With a shoe-maker’s needle, pierce seven evenly spaced holes around each of the four eggs to symbolize the seven orifices of the heart. Coat the four lids with ink as before. Since raw eggshells are white and unsuitable for divine residence, the black ink allows the spirit to dwell securely—hence the name *divine chamber*.

Place the divine chambers over incense, using fine, true incense to fumigate them. Offer prayers, moving heaven and earth, and bow twice as before. When the chambers are filled with incense smoke, fill them with cinnabar, ensuring they are completely full. Any shortfall weakens the fire’s power. Once filled, apply egg white to the outer rim of the chamber’s opening and the inner rim of the lid. Seal the lid, then secure it with the following medicine.

*Method for the Jade Lung Medicine to Seal the Divine Chamber*
The formula states: *"Beneath the cinnabar’s birth lies white, and atop this white lies a jade halo."* This medicine for sealing the divine chamber and the earthen vessel symbolizes the jade halo of cinnabar, akin to the heart’s pericardium. Pound lime into a fine powder, soak it in extremely sour fermented water for seven days, then dry and pound it again into fine powder. Take half a *jin* of purified lime and half a *jin* of raw arsenic, and grind both into fine powder. Mix these two ingredients with alum decoction to seal the chamber. Once sealed, place it into the Five Phases Jade Vessel.

*Method for the Five Phases Jade Vessel*
This jade vessel symbolizes the jade halo. Take five *jin* of arsenic, break it into small pieces, and wrap them in paper, silk, or cloth. Add half a *jin* of dead nitre, a small amount of salt, and one *liang* of unrefined nitre.

Combine the three ingredients in strong vinegar, then take the aforementioned silk-wrapped arsenic and suspend it within the vinegar to boil as an embryo. It must be boiled for seven days, requiring approximately five or six bottles of vinegar. After seven days of boiling, remove the arsenic and dry it in the sun. Take two *liang* of dead nitre, which must be subdued with soap beans—each *jin* of nitre requires two *jin* of soap beans, refined over a fierce fire. Add two *liang* of refined cinnabar and two *liang* of blasted cinnabar.

For the Jade Vessel’s medicine, the total weight is five *jin* and six *liang*. Pound it into fine cinnabar powder. Use a sand crucible of appropriate size to hold the medicine—this is called the Earthen Cauldron. Place one scoop of dark essence stone at the bottom of the cauldron, then layer the four Jade Vessels evenly within. Position the Four Spirit Chambers at the center, and cover them with the Jade Vessel medicine. Once done, fill the remaining space with dark essence stone, seal the cauldron’s mouth with clay, and tightly cover it with a porcelain dish, ensuring no gaps to avoid disrupting the firing process. Bind it with eight strands of iron wire, twisting the excess into knots about two fingers high. Then apply a thin layer of clay, roughly one *fen* thick, to protect the iron wire and porcelain dish.

Place the assembly into an ash furnace and nurture the fire.

*Method for the Five-Five Celestial Cycle of Fire*
The formula states: Take ten months as the measure, symbolizing the gestation of an embryo. The latter five months correspond to the number of Earth. Thus, five times five makes twenty-five, fulfilling the qi of Earth. For the first ten months of firing, use one *liang* and four *qian*. For the next ten months, use one *liang* and six *qian*. For the final five months, use two *liang* and one *qian*. Once the celestial cycle of fire is complete, proceed with the supplementary fire, adjusting only for the shorter months—this follows the celestial cycle of the moon.

*Method for Supplementary Fire*
Place a flat-bottomed ash furnace and replace the iron stand, positioning the crucible so its legs are four *cun* high. For the morning fire, use three braziers, each with seven *qian*, totaling two *liang* and one *qian*, with the fire three *cun* below the legs. For the evening fire, use three braziers, each with eight *qian*, totaling two *liang* and four *qian*, with the flying fire level with the iron wire atop the crucible.

*Method for Fire Braziers*
Fashion six iron-wire braziers, divided for morning and evening use. Each brazier should be one *cun* wide and one and a half *cun* long, with a lid. When lighting a new brazier, transfer the fire from the old one, ensuring no residual fire remains. Once the supplementary fire for the shorter months is complete, open the furnace, remove the cinnabar cauldron, cut the iron wire, lift the porcelain dish, and take out the four Spirit Chambers. Saw open the chambers—their bodies will be as hard as porcelain or tile, making sawing difficult. First, carve a hemispherical hollow in a wooden block to hold half of the Spirit Chamber, then place the chamber on it and saw gently back and forth to open it. Remove the cinnabar and bathe it in medicinal water to revive the cinnabar’s fire and restore its original qi.

*Method for Bathing the Cinnabar and Restoring Qi*
Use one *liang* of dried mountain grape seeds (or four *liang* of fresh, squeezed for juice). Add four *liang* each of petroleum and camphor oil, mixing them evenly into roughly half a bowl of water. Bring the water to a boil, then pour it into the cinnabar—let it boil until the sound ceases, then wait for it to cool before removing the cinnabar for testing.

*Method for Testing the Cinnabar*
Take one *liang* of red copper and melt it into liquid. Add half a *qian* of the cinnabar to transmute it. Then place a piece of raw nitre the size of a green plum into the molten mixture. If sulfur is present, its fumes will darken the transmuted copper. Use a piece of wall clay to absorb the sulfur fumes, stirring with tongs until the liquid becomes clear as water. Pour it out. If impurities remain, add more raw nitre and wall clay, repeating the process until the liquid is perfectly clear. Pour it out to obtain eight pieces of true-color treasure, requiring no additional matrix. If the cinnabar transmutes thus, its spirit is awakened—this is the Mother of the Nine-Cycled Cinnabar.

Though the cinnabar’s body is now potent, it is still not fit for consumption. It may only serve as a vessel to ascend into the Nine-Cycled Cinnabar. Do not waste the Mother Cinnabar by using it excessively for transmutation, lest it hinder the Nine Cycles.

*Discourse on Testing the Cinnabar*
According to medical texts, copper has the property of mending broken bones. When one ingests copper medicine, it travels directly to the site of the fracture, reinforcing it like lacquered sinew, making the bone as hard as metal or stone. Testing the cinnabar by transmuting copper into treasure reveals the Dao of bone-transformation in immortal formulas. If one refines and consumes it through nine cycles, one’s bones will assuredly transform into cold jade.

*The Supreme Ultimate Realized One Speaks*
Among the three hundred and sixty kinds of jade and stone, cinnabar is the foremost treasure. The ancients regarded it as the great medicine for nurturing life, attaining immortality, and achieving longevity. The methods for refining and consuming it are not uniform—some use wine, others vinegar, lacquer, or honey. When properly prepared, all can nurture life and lead to immortality. However, subduing the fire to create liquid gold and cycling it nine times to produce the Returned Cinnabar is the supreme method. This cinnabar can grant one the status of an Earth Immortal, with a lifespan of ten thousand years. To become a Spirit Immortal, one may pay homage to the Golden Mother and the Wood Lord, receive sacred texts, ascend the numinous terrace, and transform one’s bones to become a flying immortal. To become a Heavenly Immortal, one may roam freely among the Purple Canopy and Verdant Terrace, serving as a minister in the Three Pure Realms.

Only those with the bones of an immortal will encounter this method. Only those of virtue will meet a perfected being. If you encounter it, do not treat it lightly or with disrespect, nor fail to master its oral instructions, lest you waste the furnace and cauldron or incur heavenly punishment, cutting short your journey on the mysterious path. Such misfortune is self-inflicted—who else could be blamed?

The grasses and trees number thirty-six tens of species, yet yellow essence ranks as the supreme treasure among them. This is also a numinous herb for nurturing life and destiny, attaining longevity and immortality, and becoming a spirit immortal. Examining the natures of the world’s grasses, trees, metals, and stones—all things under heaven—those imbued with yin qi invariably contain toxins and bring death to man. Those imbued with yang qi invariably bestow life.

Yellow essence grows on the southern slopes of mountains, receiving the essence of the Great Yang. Hookvine grows on the northern slopes, receiving the essence of the Great Yin’s qi to flourish, and thus swiftly causes death. Its poison can sever the intestines and stomach, for yin toxins are most fearsome. Cinnabar receives the true essence of the Great Yang, the upright qi of fire’s transformation, sharing the same color as the sun and the same function as yellow essence. As the essence of yang, what doubt could there be?

Within the sun dwells the crow, harboring yin. Within cinnabar dwells mercury, harboring yin. Refined through nine cycles to become golden liquid and returning elixir, it is pure yang. The growth of cinnabar, crowned above by jade radiance and sheltered below by jade groves, reveals its noble place in creation. Thus may its worth be known.

*Upper Scroll of the Upper Cavern Heart Elixir Canon and Oral Instructions*
*Middle Scroll of the Upper Cavern Heart Elixir Canon and Oral Instructions*

The Patriarchal Heir of the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One records the words of the Immortal Elder: As the *Cantong Qi* states, "To plant grain, use millet; to hatch a chick, use its egg. Swallows and sparrows do not give birth to phoenixes, nor do foxes and hares nurse horses." These words exhaust the principle. For humans, the Five Phases in sequence give rise to form, while in reversal they perfect the true. Only by examining the qi of yin-yang and the Five Phases does this body come to be. Yet the treasure within the body is the spirit. In heaven, spirit is heat; on earth, it is fire; in humans, it is the heart-spirit. The heart is the ancestor of the Dao, the proper method of immortal cultivation.

Now, taking cinnabar alone and refining it through nine cycles to become golden liquid and returning elixir—this is the very principle. If one awakens to this principle, cultivating the external refinement of the returning elixir and ingesting it according to the method, while internally seeking the mysterious pearl within the Crimson Waters and congealing the returning elixir within the Yellow Court, one causes both inner and outer elixirs to form. Through ninefold transformation, in an instant one merges with the Dao and attains truth. For inner cultivation yields the yin elixir, while outer cultivation yields the yang elixir. When the yin elixir is achieved, life is prolonged; when the yang elixir is achieved, one ascends in flight. Thus, those who cultivate the Dao—those who attain the inner elixir may extend their years, while those who obtain the outer elixir may ascend to heaven. If the inner elixir is complete but the outer elixir does not respond, or if the outer elixir is perfected but the inner elixir remains unmastered, neither can achieve ascension.

What I transmit as the Three Ones and Nine Chambers is the essential method of inner cultivation. The golden liquid returning elixir is the ultimate achievement of external refinement. Strive to cultivate it, and success may be yours.

The disciple then bowed twice to receive the teaching, vowing to keep it secret for life.

The Immortal Elder said: Those who seek longevity yet fail to obtain the divine elixir of golden liquid merely torment themselves in vain. For breath control, guiding and pulling, exhaling the old and inhaling the new, or ingesting herbal medicines—these may extend life, but death remains inevitable. Only by ingesting the divine elixir can one become a transcendent, traversing the world, enduring as long as heaven and earth, shining as brightly as the sun. One may sit and perceive a thousand miles, command ghosts and spirits, ascend with one’s entire household to the void, fly without wings, ride clouds and mount dragons, ascending and descending the Great Clarity. In the span of a single watch, one may roam the eight extremities, unbound by rivers and seas, unafraid of the hundred poisons.

Herbal medicines may cure illnesses, but they cannot confer longevity. Mineral medicines may extend years and also dispel the hundred evils. Yet herbs, being insubstantial, brittle, and soft, cannot endure long—they rot when boiled, decay when buried, turn to ash when burned, and wither when stored. If they cannot firm themselves, how can they firm others? If they cannot sustain their own life, how can they sustain others?

Cinnabar, however, is called a marvelous stone and the supreme medicine. Its fine texture is red and lustrous, its substance firm and enduring. The longer it is refined and stored, the more wondrous its transformations become. It can fly, turn to powder, become refined as snow, transform into true mercury, or become the returning elixir. It resists fire, transmutes water, and when dissolved, does not diminish. Buried, it does not decay. Its numinous marvels and mysteries are beyond description.

Yet when rightly applied, it preserves life; when misused, it harms longevity. Some see in the *Materia Medica* that cinnabar is non-toxic and assume it cannot harm. They do not know that mercury, born of cinnabar, is highly poisonous. Thus it is said: mercury is the soul of cinnabar, and mercury emerges from cinnabar. If the derivative is toxic, how could the source be without poison? Those of shallow understanding and narrow vision, failing to consider the far-reaching power of life and destiny, stumble and do not recover. This is why the ancients were deeply cautious, eradicating evil at its root. They first boiled and refined cinnabar before incorporating it into the great elixir. Though paths differ, all aim to subdue fire. Neither days nor human effort should be limited—patience is required, and haste is unwise.

Some see cinnabar as a stone and claim that all stones turn to ash when burned, so why should cinnabar alone remain unchanged? They do not realize that cinnabar, though red, can generate the white substance of mercury—a transformation that serves as proof. Refining cinnabar into golden liquid is like soil mixed with water becoming mud. Beneath mountains where gold is found, cinnabar often abounds. Through ceaseless transformation, it reverts to gold, returning to its original nature—nothing is strange in this.

Thus, in the Han dynasty, there was Li Shaojun, a man of several hundred years. His only skill was refining cinnabar into the returning elixir, or transmuting the elixir into gold, fashioning vessels from the gold, using them to hold food, and consuming it to nourish the body. Gradually, his intestines and stomach were permeated, his meridians and protective qi suffused, and by virtue of its firmness and purity, his years were prolonged. Yet when he served Emperor Wu of Han, he did not fully reveal the truth, instead presenting it as sacrificial techniques and heterodox arts. He did not disclose the proper method of the golden liquid returning elixir. Summoned to court, he eventually departed in transformation, and the emperor longed for him.

Thus we know that only the method of refining cinnabar and the wonder of the golden liquid returning elixir can make one ageless and deathless—this is the greatest good.

The Immortal Elder said: This method of refining cinnabar is not only for ingesting to attain longevity. Used to bathe the body, mundane illnesses cannot invade, and the hundred calamities cannot harm. This method originally derives from the Jade Emperor’s secret hidden texts, not something the worldly possess. Without receiving the immortal tally, one can never see it. I leave this written method to enlighten future sages. Whoever obtains it must follow the transmission rites to receive it. Do not lightly disclose my teachings to the unworthy, for if transmitted to the wrong person, the elixir will not form. Even after ten thousand kalpas of cultivating the Dao, one will never succeed.

It is also said: Do not lightly disclose the received method. On the day of transmission, choose an auspicious day, establish a purification fast, and set up an altar. Master and disciple shall stand before the altar, burning precious incense day and night, presenting offerings and praying to the emperor for the fulfillment of their wish—the recording of the name in the register of longevity medicines.

The disciple [Name] has from youth cherished the supreme Dao of longevity. Through ten thousand kalpas, I have constantly received the blessings of the Dao. Now, by the grace of the sagely decree, I have been deemed worthy by my merciful master to receive these secret writings. Yet I dare not presume to accept them without first submitting each detail to the August Sovereign. My master has declared before the throne that this disciple [Name] seeks the Dao with unwavering diligence, day and night. Should I now transmit these secret writings, I dare not grant them without first presenting every particular to the August Sovereign.

With reverent devotion, we shall maintain this practice for seven full days and nights. Then, burning incense, we shall ascend the altar, drink the blood oath, and cast the divided gold ring into flowing water. Only then may the master transmit the divine golden elixir, along with its oral instructions and illustrated manuals—all to be conveyed in accordance with this same ritual. Should the transmission rites not be strictly observed, neither master nor disciple shall achieve success, for these are the secret writings of the Golden Liquid Returned Elixir.

Master Huxiu addressed Lord Ge the Immortal: "Your fate is bound to the star of immortality, and your name is recorded to succeed me. Today, I transmit to you the secret of the golden elixir and the methods of cultivating immortality. Follow them faithfully. Should you ever transmit them, choose only those who dwell in mountain seclusion, free from worldly desires. They must swear the blood oath, divide the ring, and establish the altar vow. Never transmit recklessly, for if given to the unworthy, your name shall be stricken from the register of blessings, and calamity shall extend through generations. Guard this well—do not transmit it carelessly. These are the divine elixir’s priceless secrets."

**Nine Cycles of the Divine Elixir: Secret Formula**

The instructions state: For every cycle of the elixir, an offering must be made before the furnace. The method of offering, as previously described, applies uniformly to the preparation of the medicine, the kindling of the fire, and all nine cycles.

**First Cycle Method**
The instructions state: For each tael of raw cinnabar, use four taels of pre-fired cinnabar to encase and nurture it. In this first cycle, for every four taels of cinnabar, one *jin* of pre-fired cinnabar must be used as the encasement. When raw cinnabar encounters pre-fired cinnabar, it submits as a cat before a rat or a sheep before a tiger, yielding to the nature of the fire and ceasing all resistance.

Select three taels of bright red cinnabar, the size of yellow beans, and soak it in *chongshan putao* water for seven days. Each day, replace the water with warm liquid, then dry it in the sun. Prepare a talc box, about the thickness of a three-coin stack, large enough to hold over twenty taels. Make it slightly larger, then fill it to the brim.

First, lay a layer of fired cinnabar at the bottom, then add raw cinnabar, arranging them like lotus petals. Cover with another layer of fired cinnabar, then alternate between raw and fired layers. Once filled, top with fired cinnabar, trimming any excess to level with the cinnabar. Seal with the box’s lid, ensuring the cinnabar adheres to it. After sealing, secure it with mud—ancient methods used gypsum, which is harder to open, but mud is easier. Though the pre-fired cinnabar encasement prevents escape, mud is still used. However, following the ancient method with gypsum is preferable, allowing for gradual opening. Bind the box with eight iron wires, twisting the excess into a knot two fingers high. This applies to all nine cycles.

**Furnace Construction for Elixir Cycling**
Construct the furnace base from planks, with bamboo skewers forming the frame. Weave a bamboo furnace, straight and cylindrical, about a foot wide, coated with a one-inch layer of mud. The mouth should be nine inches wide, and the height eleven inches. Inside, place an iron stand three inches high, upon which the medicine box rests, covered with ash for heat regulation. This furnace serves all nine cycles, following the same method.

**Fire Regulation for the First Cycle**
One tael and four *qian* of fire regulation. No supplemental firing is needed for any of the nine cycles. Each cycle lasts twelve months. Upon completion, extract four taels of cinnabar, discarding the remaining *jin* of encasement. This can be used for transmutation. The elixir of the first cycle is to be ingested according to the prescribed method.

**Method of Ingesting the First-Cycle Elixir**
Grind one *qian* of pre-fired cinnabar into an extremely fine powder. Mix with half a *ge* of a firstborn son’s milk in a silver dish. Gently simmer in a double boiler until cooked, then add a pinch of white flour to form small pills the size of yellow beans. Place them in a paper steamer suspended over a slow fire, and stir-fry with a silver spoon for one *shi* (two hours), ensuring the paper does not burn. If it chars, replace the paper steamer and continue frying until dry, ensuring thorough heat penetration.

Ingest with ginseng decoction at the fifth watch, facing east. Soon after, the body will grow intensely hot and the mouth dry. Prepare nine large vats of water in advance. Immediately sit in one; if the heat persists, move to another vat of cold water. Continue until all nine vats are warmed, waiting until the heat subsides and the body cools. Afterward, the skin will shed entirely, including hair, eyebrows, and beard, which will regrow. The elderly will revert to youth, like a cicada shedding its shell. Each cycle’s elixir, when ingested, yields distinct benefits as described in the scriptures. Those who have cultivated internal elixirs need not use water.

However, this method of ingesting the first-cycle elixir must not be undertaken lightly. Only those resolutely devoted to longevity, free from doubt and with a full internal elixir, may proceed. Those of restless temperament or prone to suspicion risk harm. Why? Ordinary people who have not cultivated internal elixirs suffer from depleted brain marrow. Ingesting this elixir may damage their essence, leading to desiccation. If doubt arises, the heart’s fire will ignite, engulfing the body in flames—beyond salvation. Thus, when the nine-cycle elixir is completed, ordinary people who ingest it will dissolve into fresh blood. How can this not be believed? Even this first-cycle elixir demands caution.

After ingesting the elixir, one must cultivate the internal elixir, practicing seated meditation to refine both internal and external. When the internal and external elixirs align, the spirit will emerge—all methods are contained herein.

**Secret Method of Cultivating the Internal Elixir**
The instructions of the True Person of the Great Ultimate state: The elixir chamber must be pure and clean, with precious incense constantly burning. It should be a secluded room, free from drafts, neither too bright nor too dark, with moderate height. All taboos must be strictly observed, forbidding the presence of impure or inauspicious individuals—those who are elderly, ill, in mourning, postpartum, pregnant, foul-bodied, disabled, or infirm. Monks, Daoists, idlers, women, cats, dogs, and other animals must also be excluded. It is best to prevent outsiders from entering. Select two intelligent, sincere, and upright young boys as attendants, ensuring no one learns of the elixir chamber’s existence. The Dao of immortality values secrecy above all.

**Further Secrets of Cultivating the Internal Elixir**

One must never speak of the practice of refining the internal or external elixir, nor reveal its methods to others. If杂 persons or those who lack faith learn of this cultivation, or if one discusses it in their presence or allows them to witness it, the Dao of immortality cannot be attained. Once the elixir chamber is prepared, arrange a seat within it—whether a bench, a couch, or a meditation platform—ensuring the knees are level, neither too high nor too low. The pillow should be four fingers in height. The chamber’s humidity and dryness must be balanced, and all must be kept pure and clean. The bedding, clothing, and quilts should be thick and soft, while food, drink, decoctions, tea, and wine must be prepared with care, ensuring purity and moderation. Strictly avoid sexual defilement, excessive drunkenness, overindulgence, hunger, joy, anger, sorrow, or anxious thoughts. All perverse intentions and delusive imaginings must be absent, and the five pungent vegetables, along with foul impurities, should also be avoided. If one violates the taboo of sexual defilement or encounters foul impurities, the elixir will be harmed, and the practitioner’s progress will be hindered—failure will be imminent.

Thereafter, sit in joyful stillness each day, free from all attachments, with no wandering thoughts. The inner realm must not be disturbed, nor should external distractions intrude. The heart should be as bright and clear as a mirror, without a speck of dust; as pure and limpid as water, without a trace of sediment. Then, clench the fists as an infant does, press the lips and teeth together, and rest the tongue against the upper palate. Breathe softly and continuously, directing the gaze from the eyes to the nose, and from the nose to the navel. One will feel a thrilling sensation throughout the body’s pores, akin to the bliss of intimate union. This serves as verification.

Whether sitting cross-legged, stretching the legs, standing, walking, or lying down, the ascent and descent of qi remain the same—profound principles reside within these practices. When lying down, one must not sleep, for sleep scatters the qi. If one can remain sleepless day and night, it is most excellent. If not, sleep should be minimized, gradually reducing it over time.

The practice of fetal breathing should be performed from the *zi* hour (11 PM–1 AM) to the *wu* hour (11 AM–1 PM), never from *wu* to *zi*. The period from *zi* to *wu* is called the Six Yang, during which qi is generated. From *wu* to *zi* is the Six Yin, when qi declines—this is of no benefit to the practitioner.

In practicing fetal breathing, embrace simplicity and profound stillness: close the nose, shut the eyes, and refrain from exhaling through the mouth, as if dwelling within the womb. Beginners should draw in qi through the nose and mouth, then hold it while silently counting to one hundred and twenty before exhaling through the mouth. The breath should be so subtle that the ears cannot detect its entry or exit, with inhalation exceeding exhalation. A method to test this is to place a goose feather before the nostrils—if the feather remains unmoved during exhalation, the technique is correct. Gradually increase the count of held breaths; with time, one may reach a thousand. Then, the aged will regain youth, the dead may be revived, plagues can be averted, tigers and snakes subdued, water and fire traversed, metal and stone penetrated, hunger and thirst dispelled, and life prolonged to defy death. One may even reverse the flow of water and fire. However, while practicing this method, avoid consuming excessive meat, raw vegetables, or rich, fatty foods, as these strengthen the qi, making it difficult to restrain. Guard against anger, for anger disrupts the qi.

The efficacy of fetal breathing is thus—this method must be kept secret. It is a teaching passed mouth-to-mouth, not an ordinary worldly text. Do not reveal it to the unworthy; guard it closely.

Next, circulate the essence and qi from the *weilu* (tailbone) through the *jiaji* (spine) into the brain, entering at the *naohui* point (the nineteenth vertebra). The *jiaji* point lies below the twelfth vertebra. The method for replenishing the brain begins by tilting the head back and tightly sealing the third vertebra of the *dazhui* point to prevent qi from passing. First, close the *jiaji* to block the qi. The *dazhui* point is called the Upper Pass, and the *jiaji* point the Middle Pass. Gradually raise the qi until it fills the brain. Once the brain is full, the elixir will naturally descend from the *xuanying* (mysterious throat), its taste sweet and its fragrance pure—at this point, the internal elixir is complete.

With time, signs will manifest: the body may feel as though seated in a steaming rice pot, unbearably hot, or the limbs and entire body may grow cold as ice, both inside and out, before harmonizing. At this stage, do not be alarmed or fixated—further methods exist, transmitted orally and through direct instruction.

The method of fetal breathing, combined with the practice of returning wind and merging qi, unites essence with spirit, spirit with qi, and qi with the true. When the divine elixir merges, the elixir will form in a hundred days.

When the internal elixir fills the brain, proceed with the method of silently paying homage to the Emperor in the Three-One and Nine Chambers. Upon completion of this merit, a celestial summons will arrive, and the time for ascension will draw near.

**Second Cycle Method**
The instructions state: The methods of bathing, preparing the medicine, sealing, and the elixir furnace are the same as in the first cycle; they will not be repeated here. Take one *liang* of cinnabar and four *liang* of first-cycle refined cinnabar, combining them for a total of five *liang* of raw and prepared cinnabar. Use a mica box large enough to hold slightly more than five *liang*, fill it to the brim, seal it, and apply fire. The fire regulation for the second cycle is one *liang* and six *qian*. Each cycle’s firing lasts three hundred and sixty days; this applies to all nine cycles and will not be repeated.

The second cycle, being an even number, is not consumed. The fourth, sixth, and eighth cycles follow the same principle.

**Third Cycle Method**
Take one *liang*, one *qian*, and a half of cinnabar, and five *liang* of third-cycle refined cinnabar. Process them according to the method, yielding a total of six *liang* and two *qian* of raw and prepared cinnabar. Use a talc box large enough to hold slightly more than six *liang* and two and a half *qian*, fill it to the brim, and seal it. The fire regulation for the third cycle is two *liang* and one *qian*.

The divine elixir of the third cycle is consumed as follows: knead it with the milk of a firstborn son and form it into pills the size of black beans. Take them with ginseng decoction, and one may attain a lifespan of three hundred years, project the yang spirit, roam the four seas, commune with divine beings, and have jade maidens attend to them, commanding ghosts and spirits. If used for transmutation, it can refine cinnabar into yang elixir, allowing one to shed the mortal body and exchange bones. It can also transmute mercury.

**Method for the Fourth Cycle**
Take one *liang* and five *qian* of cinnabar and six *liang* and two and a half *qian* of third-cycle fire-tamed cinnabar, and fill the vessel. The total weight of raw and prepared cinnabar is seven *liang* and seven *qian*. Use a talc box large enough to hold seven *liang* and seven *qian*, fill it to the brim, seal it, and apply fire. The fire regulation for the fourth cycle is two *liang* and eight *qian*. The elixir of the fourth cycle is not for consumption but may be used for transmutation.

**Method for the Fifth Cycle**
Take one *liang* and nine *qian* of cinnabar and seven *liang* and seven *qian* of fourth-cycle fire-tamed cinnabar, and enclose them. The total weight of raw and prepared cinnabar is nine *liang* and six *qian*. Use a talc box large enough to hold slightly more than nine *liang* and six *qian*, fill it to the brim, seal it, and apply fire. The fire regulation for the fifth cycle is one *liang* and eight *qian*. The divine elixir of the fifth cycle is consumed as follows: knead it with refined butter into pills the size of small beans, and take them with frankincense decoction. One may attain a lifespan of five hundred years, enter water without drowning, enter fire without burning, and achieve perfection of both form and spirit, thereby being ranked among the immortals. If used for transmutation, one *jin* of fire-tamed cinnabar can refine four *liang* of mercury, producing *Qionglin Yushu* ("Jade Trees of the Celestial Grove"). This refined mercury may then be divided and used as a vessel to nurture cinnabar, a process called *Yudeng* ("Jade Equivalent"). However, it may only be used to refine mercury once or twice; otherwise, the elixir will be damaged.

**Method for the Sixth Cycle**
Take two *liang* and four *qian* of cinnabar and nine *liang* and six *qian* of fifth-cycle fire-tamed cinnabar, and fill the vessel according to the method. The total weight of raw and prepared cinnabar is twelve *liang*. Use a talc box large enough to hold slightly more than twelve *liang*, fill it to the brim, seal it, and apply fire. The fire regulation for the sixth cycle is two *liang* and eight *qian*. The details of the sixth cycle are as described above.

**Method for the Seventh Cycle**
Take three *liang* of cinnabar and twelve *liang* of sixth-cycle fire-tamed cinnabar, and fill the vessel. Use a talc box large enough to hold slightly more than fifteen *liang*, fill it to the brim, seal it, and apply fire. The fire regulation for the seventh cycle is two *liang* and one *qian*. Upon reaching the seventh cycle, the elixir is consumed by forming it into pills with fermented wine, the size of *meng* beans, and taking them with costus root decoction. One may attain a lifespan of a thousand years; its efficacies need not be fully enumerated. If copper coins, lead, or tin are placed in the vessel, they will all be transmuted into high-grade silver. If realgar, sulfur, *fenghuang*, *pishi*, or *lingsha* are placed in the vessel, they will be tamed by fire and prevented from volatilizing; they may then be divided and placed in separate vessels for further cycles. If the elixir is formed into pills the size of *meng* beans, it can refine one *liang* of mercury into silver. When added to the Three Yellows, it will transmute them into red gold. However, it should not be used wastefully but only to verify its efficacy.

**Method for the Eighth Cycle**
Take three *liang* and seven *qian* of cinnabar and fifteen *liang* of seventh-cycle fire-tamed cinnabar, and fill the vessel according to the method. The total weight of raw and prepared cinnabar is eighteen *liang* and seven *qian*. Use a talc box large enough to hold slightly more than eighteen *liang* and seven *qian*, fill it to the brim, seal it, and apply fire. The fire regulation for the eighth cycle is two *liang* and two *qian*. The method for the eighth cycle is the same as above.

**Method for the Ninth Cycle**
Take four *liang* and six *qian* of cinnabar and eighteen *liang* and seven *qian* of eighth-cycle fire-tamed cinnabar, and fill the vessel according to the method. Use a talc box large enough to hold slightly more than twenty-three *liang* and three *qian*, alternating one portion of raw and one portion of prepared cinnabar, fill it to the brim, seal it, and apply fire. The fire regulation for the ninth cycle is one *liang* and six *qian*. Upon completion of the ninth cycle, the elixir is also called *Zijin Ya* ("Purple Gold Sprout"). It is consumed by forming it into pills with *longgao*, the size of millet grains. *Longgao* refers to dew collected from mulberry leaves. Take one pill at a time, immerse it in well water for three days, and then consume it with the first draw of well water.

For the ninefold transmutation, place the elixir upon the recipient’s life-destiny and the astrological signs of regal ascendancy. According to the scripture, establish an altar, perform the libation rites, and maintain purity through fasting. Position the talismans of the Numinous Treasure at the five directions, the twelve spirit talismans at their respective celestial stems, and the eight numinous talismans at the eight directions. Seal the Gate of Heaven, seal the Door of Earth, pass beneath the canopy of flowers, enter the Yin realm, and seize the celestial heart at the hour of the Celestial Heart. Arrange the nine palaces, with the alchemist attending the furnace at the Central Palace. First inquire whether the day’s cyclical signs align; if so, proceed to exit the palace—this is most auspicious. Once the elixir is completed, consume a grain the size of millet, and ascend as a perfected one. Guard this secret; do not transmit it lightly.

Should someone be on the verge of death, place one grain in their mouth and pour water to swallow it, and they shall revive. If a creature dies in the sixth month and the elixir is placed within its abdomen—whether human or beast—it will not decay through the summer; this is the proof. If the ninefold divine elixir is used to refine and sublimate the Three Yellows, it becomes equivalent to the Yellow Emperor’s Nine Cauldrons of Flying Elixir. The method follows the above: establish an altar in purity, then construct a nine-palace, eight-trigram furnace in the shape of a tortoise, aligning above with celestial patterns and below with terrestrial principles. Place the Three Yellows atop the cinnabar and cover it with the celestial plate. Then apply fire above and water below to sublimate it, sweeping up the dark frost. Consume a grain the size of millet, and purple clouds will arrive instantly, bearing one aloft in flight. For transmutation, a single grain can convert five *liang* of mercury into yellow gold. At this stage, how could one be constrained by worldly profit? It lies in the transformative power of the spoken word.

For the method of conjoining the Golden Liquid and Returning Elixir, once compounded, consume one *liang* to ascend as an immortal. If one does not yet wish to depart and instead desires to remain in the world as an earthbound immortal, fast for one hundred days and consume half a *liang*; thus, one attains longevity without death, immune to all harms and poisons, able to keep a family, hold office, or pursue desires without restriction. If later one wishes to ascend to heaven, fast and consume the full *liang*, and one shall immediately take flight. For those intending to ascend, one must abstain from grains for a full year before consumption.

In general, for those who consume divine elixirs and great medicines, following the scriptural prescribed days ensures effortless ascent to heaven. Consuming half the dose grants longevity without death, becoming an earthbound immortal without doubt.

Here ends the *Middle Scroll of the Scripture and Oral Instructions on the Elixir of the Cavernous Heart*.
Here begins the *Lower Scroll of the Scripture and Oral Instructions on the Elixir of the Cavernous Heart*.

The Venerable Heir of the Supreme Ultimate Realized One personally transmitted *The Sage Annals of the Yellow Emperor*, which states: In the first year of the Yellow Emperor’s reign, on the first *yin* day of the *yin* month, he fasted at Mount Shou. Fang Ming and Mu Li followed the Yellow Emperor above, where they visited the Great Court Lord at Mount Juci and received from him *The Divine Mushroom Spirit Charts* in twelve scrolls and *The Gold and Silver Formulas* in nineteen sections. The Yellow Emperor then ascended Mount Wangwu, opened the stone casket, and uncovered the jade lid, obtaining the Way of the Nine Cauldrons’ Divine Elixir and the Flying Snow Furnace Fire. On Mount Emei, the Yellow Emperor met the August Person and respectfully sought the Dao of divine transcendence. The August Person said: “Do you not know that Heaven possesses the Dark One, born of the right yang, named Flowing Pearl, the gate of all mysteries? If you obtain and cultivate it, you may attain longevity, ascend the clouds and soar through the skies, and ascend to pay homage to the Jade Emperor.” The Yellow Emperor bowed and received the teaching. On Mount Jing, he cast a golden crucible and compounded the Great Return Divine Elixir of Flowing Pearl, transmitting it to later generations. At Dingshu Pond, he consumed the elixir and ascended. At that time, seventy-two great ministers who had also consumed the elixir ascended with the Yellow Emperor. Previously, the Yellow Emperor, fearing the Way of the Golden Elixir would be lost, entrusted it to his eldest son, commanding him to transmit it to later generations. He admonished that this Way is most weighty and must be transmitted only to the worthy. If entrusted to the unworthy, they bring calamity upon themselves. Later, the eldest son transmitted it to Master Shushan, and from then on, the sagely transmitted to the sagely, the worthy to the worthy, and the benevolent to the benevolent. Those who attained the Dao were beyond count. Heaven’s love for humanity is profound, yet people, if their hearts do not align with the Dao, inherently make success difficult.

**Song of the Internal Elixir of the Supreme**
The essence of true lead lies within primordial chaos,
Born before Heaven and Earth.
When chaos divided, the four images took form,
And the five phases were established.
Grasping the root of Heaven and Earth, the embryo of nature and life is founded,
Harmonizing with the cycles of cold and heat.
Roaming leisurely in the cinnabar terrace,
After ten months, like a child emerging from the womb,
One obtains this mysterious pearl,
And spiritual illumination naturally arrives.

**Excerpts from the External Elixir Scripture of the Supreme**
The Great Dao preserves the true; the three grades serve as its rule.
One is its measure, rectitude its virtue.
Thus, refining the golden liquid is the divine method.
Subtle mystery and pure emptiness—none attain the Dao without the golden tally.
Treading the nine depths and entering the dark,
Ascending and descending through the void,
One attains ascent through spiritual illumination.
Thereupon, he transmitted with joy *The Supreme Clarity Eight Talismans Scripture*, *The Supreme Clarity Scripture on Observing Heaven*, *The Nine Capitals Scripture*, *The Divine Elixir Scripture*, *The Golden Liquid Scripture*, and the oral instructions on the eight refinements, nine revolutions, returning elixir, and fire-taming.

Its formula states:
Golden liquid returning elixir, immortal blossom flowing pearl.
Soaring high through clouds and mist, ascending to the celestial mounds.
Yellow and red substances, obtained in an instant.
Male and female scattered pearls, enabling transformation and transcendence,
Summoning the traveling kitchen.
Divine persons and jade maidens accompany me in roaming,
Entering and exiting without question, in harmony with Heaven.
Its essence congeals like frost, skillfully achieving sinking and floating.
If you reverently heed this, you shall surely wander the immortal capital.
The oral instructions on the golden liquid are complete herein.

Its essence: cinnabar, mercury, and saltpeter liquid flowing pearls,
Used to compound the divine elixir.
Consuming one *daogui* allows ascent to the celestial palace.
When the elixir is complete and made into gold,
It may be used as dining vessels, thereby attaining divine transcendence.
If you truly desire divine transcendence,
First consume the returning elixir and golden liquid,
Thereby preserving your spirit, and you shall ascend to Heaven,
Becoming a perfected person above.
If you do not consume the returning elixir and golden liquid,
You shall suffer cold, dampness, and wind spirits striking you,
And the Controller of Destinies will be unable to save you.
The Dao is thus—how can you not exert yourself?
You should wear warm clothing, eat sparingly,
Adapt to the body, and preserve emptiness.
In emptiness and naturalness, even ghosts cannot kill you.
When your years and lifespan reach their end, you shall simply die.
Why say this? Because without firmness and spirit, one perishes.
It is like the myriad things that grow—not desiring death,
But naturally aging, withering, decaying, and dying.
People are the same.
If I bring misfortune upon myself,
Demonic beings test people, fierce beasts harm people,
Snakes and centipedes sting them.
Formerly, Zuo Yuanfang, through concentrated meditation at Mount Tianzhu,
Attracted divine persons, who transmitted to him the *Divine Elixir Immortal Scripture*.
During the great chaos at the end of the Han,
He had no leisure to compound the elixir and fled to the lands east of the Yangtze,
Resolving to visit famous mountains to cultivate this Way.
He transmitted the *Divine Elixir Scripture* and other texts to his disciple, Immortal Master Ge,
Who in turn transmitted them to his disciple, Master Zheng.
Master Zheng, being poor and unable to purchase ingredients,
Had his disciple Ge Hong, who served him diligently and assiduously,
Establish an altar at Mount Maji and transmit to Hong the elixir scriptures and various oral instructions.
He said to Hong: “I received the admonition of my former master, Master Zuo, that one must not reside and compound the divine elixir in small mountains.
Moreover, in small mountains, there are no true spirits,
Only the essences of trees, thousand-year-old creatures, and blood-consuming ghosts.
These beings are of perverse qi, not wishing people to cultivate the Dao and perform good deeds,
But only desiring to bring calamity upon them.
Even if a person of purity and refinement uses arts and numbers to protect themselves,
Ghosts and demons may still spoil their medicine.
Now, when physicians compound fine medicines and good ointments,
They still do not wish chickens, dogs, women, or children to see them.
If the medicine is seen, its efficacy is lost.
Moreover, dyed and colored objects, when seen by ill-intentioned eyes, lose their luster.
How much more so for the great medicine of divine transcendence and longevity?
Ancient Daoists compounding divine medicines
Inevitably entered famous mountains in uninhabited lands,
Never stopping in small, ordinary mountains—precisely for this reason.
Furthermore, according to the immortal scriptures,
Mountains where one may concentrate and compound immortal medicines include:
Mount Tai, Mount Hua, Mount Huo, Mount Dai,
Mount Song, Mount Shaoshi, Mount Taibai, and Mount Zhongnan.
These mountains all possess true spirits,
Within them reside earthbound immortals,
And they produce *zhi* herbs that can avert great calamities.
Not only are they suitable for compounding medicines,
But if a person of the Dao ascends them,
The mountain spirits will surely assist them in attaining good fortune,
And their medicines will certainly be completed.”

Great mountains possess great spirits; small mountains possess small spirits. Without methods of avoidance, one will inevitably encounter harm. This may manifest as illness, sudden fright, injuries from thorns or blades, hearing strange sounds, encountering anomalies, witnessing apparitions, or seeing great trees topple without wind, or cliffs and boulders crumble without cause. One may become disoriented, run wildly, and fall into ravines, or be harmed by fierce beasts and venomous snakes—thus, one must not enter lightly.

When entering mountains, one should choose days of seasonal vigor, when the heavenly stems and earthly branches mutually engender, for these are auspicious. Mount Tai forbids entry in *jia-yi* (甲乙) years and *yin-mao* (寅卯) months; Mount Heng in the south forbids entry in *bing-ding* (丙丁) years and *si-wu* (巳午) months; the Central Peak forbids entry in *wu-ji* (戊己) years and *chen-xu-chou-wei* (辰戌丑未) months; Mount Hua in the west forbids entry in *geng-xin* (庚辛) years and *shen-you* (申酉) months; and Mount Heng in the north forbids entry in *ren-gui* (壬癸) years and *hai-zi* (亥子) months. Wherever one goes among these mountains, if the region belongs to a particular peak’s domain, all such years and months are forbidden.

The *Lingbao Scripture* states: When entering mountains, one should choose *bao* days, *yi* days, or *zhuan* days—all greatly auspicious. If one enters on *zhi* days or *fa* days, death is certain.
- *Bao* days are when the heavenly stem engenders the earthly branch, such as *jia-wu* (甲午) or *yi-si* (乙巳).
- *Yi* days are when the earthly branch engenders the heavenly stem, such as *ren-shen* (壬申) or *gui-you* (癸酉).
- *Zhi* days are when the earthly branch restricts the heavenly stem, such as *wu-zi* (戊子) or *ji-hai* (己亥).
- *Fa* days are when the heavenly stem restricts the earthly branch, such as *jia-shen* (甲申) or *yi-you* (乙酉).
- *Zhuan* days are when the heavenly stem and earthly branch are in harmony, such as *jia-yin* (甲寅) or *yi-mao* (乙卯).

When entering famous mountains, one should choose the *jia-zi* day of the opening or removal phase, and hang five-inch strips of five-colored silk on stones—whatever is sought will surely be obtained. Entering famous mountains during the *gui* hour is called the "Day of Heaven’s Heart," and one will certainly attain the Dao and transcend the world.

Auspicious days for entering mountains include *jia-zi*, *jia-wu*, *jia-yin*, *yi-hai*, *yi-mao*, *yi-si*, *bing-xu*, *bing-wu*, and *bing-chen*—all greatly auspicious, ensuring safety and the attainment of the Dao.

Days to avoid in a long month: the 3rd, 11th, 15th, 18th, 24th, 26th, and 30th.
Days to avoid in a short month: the 1st, 5th, 13th, 16th, and 28th.
If one enters mountains on these days, the mountain spirits will test them, and whatever is sought will not be obtained, nor will any endeavor succeed. Not only Daoists must avoid these days—ordinary people entering mountains on such days will meet with misfortune, encountering tigers, wolves, and venomous creatures.

When entering mountains, one should know the secret art of the Six *Jia*: recite the incantation, *"Lin bing dou zhe jie zhen lie qian xing."* Silently recite these nine characters, and nothing evil will be unaverted—this is an essential method, not to be neglected.

Additionally, avoid entering mountains on the following monthly taboo days:
- First month: *wu* (午) day
- Second month: *hai* (亥) day
- Third month: *jia* (甲) day
- Fourth month: *wu* (戊) day
- Fifth month: *xu* (戌) day

In ancient times, when entering mountains to compound the elixir and seek the Dao, one would purify oneself and carry the *Writings of the Three Sovereigns* and the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*. By summoning the mountain spirits and consulting the *Register of Ghosts* to invoke the local deities and mountain marshals, one would learn of the anomalies among trees and stones, and the spirits of mountains and rivers, so they would not dare to test the practitioner. All malevolent entities would naturally flee far away. When the Yellow Emperor journeyed east to Green Mound and met the Master of the Purple Palace, he received the *Writings of the Three Sovereigns*—this was to summon the myriad spirits.

When entering mountains to compound the elixir, the method to repel the hundred spirits and ghosts of mountain shrines relies most critically on talismans. The great medicines of immortals also depend on the power of talismans for protection. The art of talismans was transmitted by Laozi to divine beings. That people today use them with little efficacy is due to errors in transmission and copying, as well as a lack of sincere faith, rendering their application futile.

Yet while the attainment of longevity fundamentally depends on the elixir rather than talismanic power, talismans cannot be abandoned, for they repel ghosts and evil, aiding the gradual refinement of the elixir.

**Talisman for Summoning the Lord of Lofty Mountains**
This talisman, when purified for ten days, summons the Lord of Lofty Mountains to dispel harm from tigers and wolves. The talisman is inscribed in cinnabar on silk, twelve inches in length. While writing, one must not pause to speak. Upon completion, burn incense and, in the purification chamber at night, align with the monthly branch, don new garments, and perform the summoning.

When using talismans, place large characters on the left and right before the heart, constantly visualizing their proper form. Summon the *liu jia* attendant talismans and the names of the Jade Maidens, reciting the invocation while gazing upward and envisioning the spirits—each five feet tall, clad as described in the *Scripture of the Six Jia*. This is the mountain-climbing talisman.

When Immortal Chen Anshi entered the mountains, he inscribed this talisman on white silk on a *jia-yin* day, faced the Northern Dipper at night, and offered wine and dried meat. Stating his name, he placed the talisman in his collar to repel evil spirits, hundred ghosts, old creatures, tigers, wolves, and venomous insects. When placed on a table, it should face the Northern Dipper.

This talisman’s strokes differ slightly from the previous one, but its method of use and efficacy remain the same—thus, both are preserved. Inscribe it in cinnabar on silk, wear it on the left arm (right for women), or write it on white silk to wear. It may also be placed at the four corners of one’s dwelling. When moving, have someone retrieve it first.

This is a great talisman of the gods—do not transmit it carelessly.

This talisman, too, is for mountain entry, with identical efficacy. It is one of the thirty-nine secret talismans of the *Yellow Court*, repelling hundred ghosts. Wherever one compounds immortal medicines or resides in the deepest recesses of famous mountains, no one must be present.

Wherever one keeps traces of livestock, there must be a stream confined by water, within a great stone cavern. If no such cavern exists, one may construct a chamber deep in the forest where no human tracks are found—always near water. Without such a place, do not attempt to compound divine medicines. In great mountains lacking a confined stream, a westward-flowing one will suffice.

Once a mountain dwelling is secured, inscribe cinnabar on cypress boards, filling them with large talismanic script. Place these above the door, at the four corners and four directions of the dwelling, and along the paths one frequents, every fifty paces, to repel all spirits. This talisman wards off wolves and tigers, and when moving, the boards may be carried to dispel mountain spirits.

Most Dao practitioners dwell in mountains and forests—dens of tigers, wolves, venomous snakes, and spectral creatures. Without deep precautions, harm will befall one’s medicines.

The talisman for repelling a hundred snakes also serves as a charm against tigers and wolves. These two divine seals are carved from jujube wood, two inches square. After setting up an offering and bowing twice to invoke them, wearing them proves highly effective. This is the seal of the Jade Maiden of the Vermilion Palace, taught by the Yellow-Headed Instructress, which keeps tigers and wolves at bay. It may also be written in cinnabar as a talisman and swallowed before entering mountains to repel such beasts, or used as a seal, as recorded in the *Scripture of the Jade Embryo*.

This talisman repels ghosts. When compounding medicines, hang it on all four sides to subdue all spirits—greatly efficacious. One version has seven curves at its center; the rest remains the same, though some may be mistaken.

This mountain-residence talisman, inscribed on cypress boards and placed at the four corners of a door, prevents tigers and wolves from approaching. The three talismans above are all written in cinnabar.

The *Tun* talisman has one version with a *tun* character at its base.

This is the *Mountain-Opening Talisman*. Write it in cinnabar on a petition made from thousand-year-old *lei* vine, twelve inches long, and press it onto the great stones of a famous mountain—the mountain gate will open, revealing treasured scriptures, and gold and jade will appear. The thousand-year-old *lei* vine, also called *tianci*, resembles a mouse’s ear and repels ghosts and demons.

When constructing a cinnabar chamber deep in the mountains, hang bells at the four corners and place ghost-repelling medicines and talismans on all sides before compounding medicines. Otherwise, spirits will drain the essence of the medicines or alter them—thus, talismans must be used to suppress and ward them off.

The method for ghost-repelling medicine: combine equal parts luminous cinnabar, realgar, orpiment, musk, aconite, white rice, *ghost’s umbrella*, and *ghost’s arrow*, forming honeyed pills to carry.

Of old, the Yellow Emperor received the *Elixir Scripture* from the Dark Maiden and sought the True Unity from the August Person. Thus it is said: the immortal formula for longevity lies solely in the Golden Elixir; the sole method for preserving form and repelling evil is the True Unity—ancient sages held it in the highest regard.

The immortal scriptures state: the *Nine-Transformations Golden Elixir Scripture* and the *Guardian Unity Formula* are both concealed within the Five Cities of Kunlun, stored in jade cases bound with gold straps, sealed with purple mushrooms, and stamped with the Central Seal—this is the most sacred and secret method of the highest sages.

If bodily ailments are not yet cured, the divine elixir not yet completed, one’s lifespan not yet fixed, and myriad evils not yet dispelled, the Way of Guarding Unity must not be unknown. Entering mountains while guarding unity ensures no poisons dare approach, and without need for other methods, all evils depart of their own accord.

**Method for Constructing a Cinnabar Chamber**
First, select a secluded place deep in the mountains, near water and beneath a hanging cliff, where traces of humans and livestock are absent. Apply talismans and seals to the chamber and its courtyard. The chamber should be twelve paces square and fourteen feet high, with a southern-facing door. Ensure a stream flows eastward before the door, with the sun to the east and the moon to the west. Plaster the interior and exterior with fragrant mud, and inscribe the main cinnabar talismans on the four walls.

Within the chamber, erect the Five Peaks and Three Terraces. Against the western wall, construct a layered altar to arrange medicinal herbs, the *Divine Elixir Scripture*, and its formulas and catalogues. Then, the spirits of living medicines will guard it, and no spirits will dare interfere.

**Method for Protection and Warding When Compounding Elixirs**
Before compounding an elixir in the mountains, first secure a dwelling, then summon the mountain spirit to inquire whether it is permissible—only then may one proceed safely, with certainty of success. The method is as follows; these subsequent methods are the talismans used by the Immortal Elder.

Fast for ten days, then write on a one-foot yellow silk in cinnabar, amidst mountain grasses, to summon the Lord of the Central Peak. Before compounding the divine elixir, first inquire about the proper procedures using this talismanic script.

On the day the Old Master compounds the divine elixir, write in cinnabar on an eight-inch white silk, place it in a crimson pouch, and tie it before the heart. One who wishes to ingest the elixir should fast for seven days before consuming it, whereupon they will attain spiritual communication and command spirits—this is called the *Eight-Inch Silk Talisman of the Great Unity*. This talisman, when ingested by one compounding the elixir, opens the heart—do not defile it.

The *Treasure Scripture of the Divine Elixir of Great Clarity* refines the eight stones, the five luminaries and seven radiances, the treasure of the Dark Palace, controlling the spirits of fire. After nine transformations, it ascends as blossoms to the Great Clarity. Upon completing the incantation, place the talisman in a blue-green brocade pouch and wear it around the neck. This talisman restrains the essence of stones, preventing them from flying away, filling the crucible with mist and frost, and causing the divine blossoms to congeal.

The *Harm-Repelling Talisman*, written in cinnabar on white paper, three inches wide and four inches long, is cast into the furnace to subdue the essence. One should constantly perceive divine light intensifying, with all spirits arriving and immortals and jade maidens appearing. Then the divine elixir is complete, and no ghosts or demons of heaven and earth can harm it.

The method states: Those who wish to create the divine elixir, transforming the five stones and producing the five metals, must first pay homage to the Heavenly August Lord of the Dao and receive the five divine talismans—then the five stones and five metals will transform at will, their essences competing to emerge.

**Method for the Talisman of the Green Emperor**
On *jia-yi* days, use white cogon grass as a mat, three feet long. Spread a twelve-foot length of green silk over the mat, with two cups of wine and two strips of dried meat. Use the silk as a base, write the talisman in ink, two inches wide and seven inches long, and place it on the mat.

The incantation states: On an auspicious day and hour, this humble servant [Name] bows twice and reverently receives the Green Emperor’s divine talisman from the Heavenly August Lord of the Dao. Again bowing twice, he burns the talisman and ingests it.

Here follows one talisman diagram—any discrepancies in transcription must be carefully examined.

**Method for the Talisman of the Red Emperor**
On *bing-ding* days, use white cogon grass as a mat, three feet long. Spread a thirteen-foot length of crimson silk over the mat, with two cups of wine and two strips of dried meat. Write the talisman in cinnabar, two inches wide, and place it on the mat.

The incantation states: On an auspicious day and hour, this humble servant [Name] bows twice and receives the Red Emperor’s divine talisman from the Heavenly August Lord of the Dao. Again bowing twice, he burns the talisman and swallows it.

**Method for the Talisman of the Yellow Emperor**
On *wu-ji* days, use white cogon grass as a mat, three feet long. Spread an eleven-foot length of yellow silk over the mat, with two cups of wine and two strips of dried meat. Use vermilion as the base and write the talisman in purple, three inches wide and seven inches long, then place it on the mat.

The incantation states: On an auspicious day and hour, this humble servant [Name] bows twice and receives the Yellow Emperor’s divine talisman from the Heavenly August Lord of the Dao. Again bowing twice, he burns the talisman and ingests it.

The above talismans, though distinct, are not to be placed near one another—each is a separate talisman, and care must be taken in their use.

**Method for the Talisman of the White Emperor**
On *geng-xin* days, use white cogon grass as a mat, three feet long. Spread an eleven-foot length of white silk over the mat, with [two cups of wine] and two strips of dried meat. Use green as the base and write the talisman in cinnabar, [two inches wide] and seven inches long, then place it on the mat.

The incantation states: On an auspicious day and hour, this humble servant [Name] bows twice and receives the White Emperor’s divine talisman from the Heavenly August Lord of the Dao. Again bowing twice, he burns the talisman and ingests it.

**Method for the Talisman of the Black Emperor**
On *ren-gui* days, use white cogon grass as a mat, three feet long. Spread an eleven-foot length of black silk over the mat, with two cups of wine and two strips of dried meat. Use black as the base and write the talisman in cinnabar, two inches wide and seven inches long, then place it on the mat.

The incantation states: On an auspicious day and hour...

At this auspicious day and hour, the humble servant [Name] bows twice and receives the Black Emperor’s divine talisman from the Heavenly August Lord of the Dao. Again bowing twice, he burns the talisman and ingests it.

The preceding five divine talismans of the Emperors, and the subsequent four talismans where each mentions "Xuan," refer to the taboo name used by the immortal elder when receiving them. Write two copies of each: burn and ingest one, and wear the other on the head. These are especially effective for alchemical transformations and should be prepared ten days prior to the desired time of elixir refinement.

The Great Elixir is the essence of metal and fire, treasured by perfected beings. Those who ingest it attain divine transformation, longevity, and eternal vision, command the hundred spirits, and ascend to the Great Clarity. Yet common folk merely know the titles of elixir scriptures but remain ignorant of the taboos in elixir refinement. Though they obtain the formula, they fail to succeed—this is the reason.

For those who wish to refine the divine elixir, there are five prohibitions, three taboos, four defeats, and six fears. If violated, the elixir’s essence scatters, its numinous radiance dissipates, its divine light sinks, and its frost-like brilliance is lost. Ingesting it brings no benefit—one cannot be too cautious.

Thus, the perfected one inquired about these details. The Dark Master replied:

**The Five Prohibitions:**
1. When compounding the medicine or kindling the fire, avoid the "dead days" of the Five Stones: *ren-chen* in spring, *gui-si* in summer, *bing-xu* in autumn, and *ding-chou* in winter. Using these days causes the stone essence to perish, forming toxic compounds—utterly useless.
2. When purchasing ingredients or discussing elixir matters, avoid the "inauspicious birth days" of the Five Evils: *ren-yin* in spring, *gui-si* in summer, *ren-shen* in autumn, and *gui-hai* in winter. Entering mountains to refine the divine elixir on these days yields no success; spirits offer no protection, and demonic forces ruin the work.
3. When refining the divine elixir in renowned mountains, avoid the "injurious and severed days" of the Five Peaks: *geng-yin* in spring, *gui-wei* in summer, *bing-shen* in autumn, and *ding-chou* in winter. Entering mountains to refine the elixir or gather magical herbs on these days results in spirits recording one’s soul, elixirs spoiling, and illness or bodily harm.
4. When preparing the crucible, furnace, or sealing the elixir with clay, avoid the "heaven-opening and earth-splitting days": *bing-xu* and *bing-chen* in spring; *xin-wei* and *xin-chou* in summer; *ren-chen* and *ren-xu* in autumn; *gui-wei* and *gui-chou* in winter. Refining the elixir on these days causes the chamber to open spontaneously, stone essence to scatter and dissipate, and the elixir’s radiance to fail.
5. For men refining the elixir, avoid the third day of the seventh month and *jia-yin* in the seventh month. For women refining the elixir, avoid the seventh day of the first month and *geng-shen* in the first month. These four days are when stone essences battle and ghosts assemble. Kindling the fire on these days prevents the elixir’s essence from manifesting, numinous forces from responding, and malevolent spirits from intruding—all leading to calamitous failure.

**The Three Taboos:**
1. Weeping or grieving while refining the elixir.
2. Uttering the names of elixir-destroying demons.
3. Encountering inauspicious defilements such as death, childbirth, or impurity.
Violating these taboos causes the stone essence to mourn and congeal, the fivefold radiance to dim, and the elixir to become poisonous—ingesting it kills. All who are sorrowful, weeping, or near corpses and defilements must not approach the elixir furnace or related tasks. Additionally, the elixir has slaying demons and malevolent ghosts—one named *Bu-zi* (character unclear), styled *Hunni Xi*. On the day of kindling the fire, avoid speaking these names. If violated, ghostly soldiers intrude, the divine furnace shatters, and the essence scatters.

**The Four Defeats:**
1. The land lacks elixir *qi*—meaning it is not a numinous site.
2. Envious or resentful people—meaning those with evil eyes who see the divine medicine bring demonic misfortune.
3. Unsuitable companions.
4. The five pungent foods, foul substances, and burning chicken or dog hair.
These four defeats are the greatest prohibitions for the Eight Stones—none may be violated.

**The Six Fears:**
1. On the day of sealing the medicine or kindling the fire, fear encountering wind, rain, or thunder.
2. While refining the elixir, fear hearing calls for souls.
3. *(Omitted in text.)*
4. *(Omitted in text.)*
5. Fear hearing sounds of lamentation.
6. Fear encountering blood, filth, or defilement.
These six fears are all forbidden for the divine elixir. Hearing or violating them startles the divine essence, disturbs the numinous *qi*, and causes harm.

The Immortal Inquiry states: To ingest the first elixir, the Flowing Pearl of Nine Cycles, or the Elixir Radiance—on a *jia-zi* day at dawn, face the sun, bow twice, kneel, and ingest a grain the size of millet. Immediately, one becomes an immortal and ascends to the Nine Heavens. Ingesting half a millet grain makes one an earthbound immortal, unburned by fire, undrowned by water, untouched by myriad evils, unharmed by blades, freely transforming, moving without hindrance, commanding ghosts and spirits, and living as long as heaven and earth. To depart this world, ingest another half-grain of millet to ascend to heaven. To deliver a mortal, ingest a grain the size of a small bean to ascend as an immortal that very day. Ingesting half a small bean makes one an earthbound immortal. For beasts, ingesting a grain the size of a large bean causes immediate ascent to heaven. Thus, birds become phoenixes, beasts become unicorns, snakes become dragons, ghosts become spirits, women become jade maidens, and men become immortals.

Mix snake fat into four pills, each the size of a crossbow pellet, and bury them at the four corners of one’s dwelling. The house transforms into a red dragon, lifting the entire residence seven thousand feet into the air, turning it to gold and jade, and traveling wherever desired. Burying one pill the size of a chicken’s yolk—whether near or far, within a thousand *li*—penetrates nine springs below, causing all rivers, mountains, and forests within to ascend to heaven.

Take one *jin* of fine, firm yellow earth with tight grain, grind it finely, sift it, and boil it in bubbling water three times. Add one *zhu* of the substance, cook thoroughly, and stir until the water evaporates—it transforms into gold.

The Immortal Elder said: When various elixirs are completed and consumed, they are often classified by men into three grades—upper, middle, and lower. The superior adept ascends to transcendence in seven days; the lesser adept, after seventy days, attains immortality. The foolish man, consuming it, becomes immortal only after a year. Should one dare to ingest a full *daogui* measure with utmost sincerity, they will briefly die for half a day before reviving, as if awakening from sleep. This is the utmost limit of elixir refinement; one must adhere to the formula, using half a millet grain as the measure.

I have heard that failure in Daoist cultivation arises from eight causes:
First, one may know a single thing and claim it sufficient, toiling over the crucible and flame yet achieving nothing by white-haired old age.
Second, though encountering a wondrous formula, one doubts its authenticity, seeking endlessly until death seals the coffin.
Third, unable to distinguish truth from falsehood and lacking a master’s guidance, the mind remains unsettled, squandering time in vain.
Fourth, relying on one’s own cleverness, one neglects the teachings, boasting of attainment while failing to exhaust the master’s wisdom.
Fifth, true formulas and secret instructions are not easily found; believing them hidden in perilous mountains, one risks life in pursuit.
Sixth, lacking the means to cultivate, pressed by hunger and cold, one gains as if not gaining, knows as if not knowing.
Seventh, lacking single-minded devotion and no reserves of resources, when a true master appears, one hesitates and does not act.
Eighth, the master one encounters is base and inferior, hoarding shallow knowledge, unwilling to teach fully. Claiming "the Dao is not in abundance," they falsely treasure secrecy, leading disciples to cling to worthless methods like the man waiting by the stump.

The Immortal Elder said: In compounding elixirs, one should seek the Dao and nurture the true, not covet worldly profit or glory. Those who craft *huangbai* (transmutative gold) will find no favor with the numinous spirits; ghosts will disturb their resolve, bringing misfortune, premature death, and untimely harm. Exercise utmost caution and do not recklessly transmit to the unworthy. Those not of like mind must not be lightly entrusted with these secrets, lest calamity and divine retribution follow.

The Immortal Scriptures say: Those recorded in the registers of immortality—those who scheme against them die, those who violate them suffer annihilation of their lineage, and those who hate them perish.
