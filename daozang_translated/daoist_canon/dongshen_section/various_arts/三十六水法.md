The above thirty-six water methods are abridged from ancient essential texts and are easily followed. Among the various stones, some are not commonly known, and not all elixirs require them.

In secluded places, if these methods are followed, they will never fail.
Gao Qi says: First, pour five *dan* of wine into flowing water at the chosen site. If there is no flowing water, dig a well. Pour the wine into the well to stabilize the earth’s *qi*, so that all practitioners may drink and eat of this water. The fire used should be a *winning fire*. For *sudden fire*, let the chaff fire reach within one *cun* of the vessel.

The transmission of divine scriptures requires a solemn vow, using one *liang* of gold fish, a jade dragon, and a silver ring as tokens, replacing the ancient oath of cutting hair and smearing blood. Since such items are no longer available in this age and cannot be omitted without violating ritual propriety, reverently prepare forty *chi* of blue cloth as a substitute for the gold fish pledge, and forty *chi* of silk as a token for the silver ring and jade dragon. Present these to a master who possesses the scriptures. The master shall distribute them to wandering scholars in the mountains, not keeping them for personal use. This clarifies the celestial covenant, ensuring no selfishness. Violating the oath will invoke punishment from the four directions.

**Inauspicious Days for Elixir-Making**
Spring: *Wu-chen*
Summer: *Ding-si*, *Wu-shen*, *Ji-si*, *Chou-wei*, *Chen*
Autumn: *Wu-xu*, *Ji-hai*, *Xin-hai*, *Geng-zi*
Winter: *Wu-yin*, *Ji-mao*, *Gui-you*, *Wei-xu*
Also avoid days of *Ren-bing*, *Wu-ding*, *Hai-earth*, *Wu-gui*, *Xin-si*, the day’s *Jian*, *Ri-sha*, *Fan-zhi*, *Yuan-ji*, the first, middle, and last months of the season, *Shou-bi*, the last day of the month, the first day of the month, the *Shang-shuo*, *Ba-kui*, *Wang-wang*, *Liu-hou*—all are inauspicious. Elixirs made on these days will not succeed.

For making *Six-One Mud*, one must also choose an auspicious day.
