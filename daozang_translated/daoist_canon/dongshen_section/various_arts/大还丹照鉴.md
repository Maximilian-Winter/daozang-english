**The Illuminating Mirror of the Great Return Elixir**

*Scripture Title:* *The Illuminating Mirror of the Great Return Elixir*. One scroll, originating from the Five Dynasties and early Song period. Base text from *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, category of Miscellaneous Arts in the *Dongshen* section.

**The Illuminating Mirror of the Great Return Elixir**

The Great Return Elixir is bound to the realm of emptiness and nothingness, encompassing the transformations of creation with primordial qi as its foundation. It splits the Two Modes to manifest images, through which Heaven displays its auspicious signs and all beings receive their numinous endowment. It unites the Four Symbols to form shapes and distinguishes the Five Phases to determine bodies. Within the profound and obscure, this Dao cannot be fathomed; amid the indistinct and vague, only sentiment fails to comprehend it.

From remote antiquity to the present, its teachings have proliferated in elaborate texts and intricate discourses, leaving later learners bewildered as to its essence. Yet the mechanisms by which former sages attained mastery remain concealed in arcane words—how then can one delve into its secret methods?

I was born in Zizhou, my family originally from the imperial capital. From childhood, I yearned for the Dao of divine transcendents. My heart was set on abandoning officialdom, scorning glory and fame. Recognizing that death is the inevitable end, I sought to prolong life. Among all things in the world, humans alone are most endowed with spirit; the myriad methods for attaining truth all depend on oneself. Thus, I wandered through sublime realms, sometimes treading the dust of the mundane, seeking like-minded companions for discussion and hoping to meet an enlightened master for transmission.

By Heaven’s grace, my wish was not in vain—I encountered an extraordinary person who revealed the forms of the Dragon and Tiger, clarifying the great principles of the Tortoise and Serpent. Thereafter, I diligently sought immortal formulas and extensively studied elixir scriptures, aiming to illuminate the eternal origin and verify the principle of returning to purity. To transcend the mortal and become sagely is no easy feat without accumulating merit; to transform the corporeal soul and return to yang depends on sincerity and natural resonance.

Moreover, the Great Elixir gleams like the sun and moon, its radiance suffusing clouds and mist. It refines the essence of the Moon’s Toad and blends the flowing reflections of the Dragon’s Embryo. Its numinous traces rarely appear, and its dust-borne marks are seldom known. Those who pursue it may wander in vain, while those who dismiss it hasten toward death.

Some covet wealth and chase profit, enriching themselves while impoverishing others. They fill their halls with wives and concubines—yet who can die in their stead? Even if gold and jade fill their houses, can these prolong life? The myriad things of the world, piled like earth in the wilderness—how many endure a hundred years? Only indulgence and dissipation prevail.

Those who uphold the Dao do so not out of greed, yet some learners boast of deep understanding. By the time their temples gray and their complexions fade, they only then lament how fleeting time slips away, sighing that the rushing waves never return. Such people—how pitiful they are!

There are also those among recent learners who cling rigidly to their teachers’ works. When discussing the Return Elixir, they fail to grasp yin and yang; when speaking of destiny, they harm their spirit through restless exertion. They misidentify mercury and lead, vainly seeking red and white transformations. Some claim the Five Viscera undergo internal alchemy while the Five Metals transform externally, insisting that transmuting gold requires *geng* (庚) and refining silver requires *gen* (艮). Others say, “Gold becomes gold, silver becomes silver—there are no other divine or sagely methods beyond this.” This is a grave error! They mistake the words of celestial transcendents, recklessly using herbs and minerals to forge gold and silver—truly a vast divergence from Heaven and Earth, a profound delusion!

I have long lamented such ignorance, unaware that within yang there is yin and within yin there is yang. Hidden mercury is mercury that congeals the River Chariot; the one that attracts iron must recognize the lodestone. Only by harmonizing the Way of husband and wife and naturally following the cyclic patterns, clarifying nature and emotion, can all be accomplished. If the world possessed some other marvel of yellow and white (gold and silver), then the Dao of divine transcendence would be entirely false. From ancient times to the present, it has been one path—there is no second doctrine.

During moments of leisure, I gathered and compiled the scriptures of immortals, carefully editing the maxims of former sages to serve as a model for later generations, entitling it *Illuminated Mirror: Anthology of Ascension to Immortality*. Comprising a single scroll, it is divided into thirty-three chapters, truly intended to reflect flaws and blemishes, thereby earning its name *Ascension to Immortality*—so that beauty and ugliness may be readily distinguished, and subtle mysteries easily grasped. All within are sacred texts and esoteric instructions, alchemical secrets and profound mechanisms. May they be fully revealed to past worthies and broadly illuminated for future learners.

I humbly pray that the perfected immortals may grant their protection, that the August Emperor may bestow his mercy, that the enlightened transformation may awaken a heart of correction and safeguarding, and that the Great Clarity may provide the Way of deliverance and ascent. Thus shared with like-minded seekers, it may cleanse and expand the vastness of their aspirations. Those who glance upon it may treat it as a treasure of pearls; those who obtain a copy may cherish it as a rare jewel. Should one follow its precepts and formulas, one will surely attain transcendence beyond the mundane. But if one practices according to personal whim, one will surely squander wealth and exhaust one’s estate. Do not show this to the unworthy; reckless disclosure invites heavenly retribution.

Composed in the first month of the first full moon of the twenty-fifth year of Guangzheng, the renxu year.

A northern song says:

The Northern Song says:

The Dark Warrior of the North is black in form,
His homeland rests within the Kunlun realm.
With steadfast will he seeks eternal life,
In any shape or way he may be born.
Adrift upon the currents, fate’s guest he roams,
Who knows his nature bears no trace of white?
Not only does he hold the essence of the Five Phases,
But within him, yin and yang’s souls deeply stir.
Harmonized, Dui and Zhen become husband and wife,
The Four Symbols arrayed on high.
Clearly I point this out to later generations—
Lest they stray, bewildered, from the celestial path.

Male or female, it is also Metal.
Long standing in the Zi Palace, born at Wu,
Its form complete in Dui, its heart one with Kan.
Fair as jade, its beauty surpasses ice and snow,
Its pure essence holds light, scattering pale radiance.
Though called White Langgan,
Who knows my true self is the Bright Moon?
Without a matchmaker, it weds the Yellow Sprout,
In life and death, it must return to Wu and Ji’s home.
When scorching heat descends, cold realms rise,
Yin and yang urge on, all becomes cinnabar.
If one grasps the meaning of these words,
The path to the Three Clarities lies before your eyes.
Riding a crane to soar heavenward will come in time—

The Southern Song says:
The Vermilion Bird of the South,
Its body fierce and red,
Mighty and unyielding, hard to rival,
Its nature one with Heaven and Earth,
Its transformations equal to Creation,
Even yin and yang cannot fathom its workings.
Water is its wife, Earth its mother, Wood its child,
The White Emperor’s Metal form receives this womb.
The Four Symbols arise from my qi,
All things live or die by my qi’s command.
Its nature linked to Jia and Yi, its qi flows freely,
It fans the union of Metal Maiden and Wood Elder.
Returning to Wu and Ji in the Central Palace,
Watch as all turns red in transformation.
If you fail to grasp this song’s earnest words,
Ponder each line carefully to dispel confusion.
Do not say learning alone suffices—only through hidden merit
Can you begin to fathom my intent and secrets.

The Eastern Song says:
In the East there is a Wood, originally named Sand,
Male or female, it is also a sprout.
Receiving qi at Wu, it must stand at Zi,
Nurturing essence, fostering substance, growing in Metal’s house.
Since its growth over many years and months,
Each dawn it faces the ends of the earth.
Do not scorn its blackened, wrinkled form—
Its entire body is the sun’s radiant essence.
If by chance it meets a child of yin’s house,
Without need of a matchmaker, they pledge themselves.
Welcomed into the treasure chamber of the Central Palace,
Yin and yang’s qi unite, their hearts in accord.
For this purpose, the womb is remade,
Kan and Li move through the Eight Trigrams.
After ten months’ gestation, mother and child part—
Then you shall know the soaring phoenix and simurgh’s chariot.

The Central Song says:
The Central Palace’s Wu and Ji belong to the Black Tortoise,
Its body aligned with emptiness and the Dao’s neighbor.
Purely embracing primordial harmony and refined qi,
Through ten thousand refinements, the body is wholly perfected.
Wood is its wife, Fire its child, Water its ghost,
Water and Earth restrain it, preventing its rise.
Yet it causes the birth of Western Metal,
Passing on its strength and essence in succession.
Though my form lacks a fixed shape,
My will and affairs depend on the Four Symbols’ life.
Without the Four Symbols’ connection to my qi,
How could Water, Metal, Wood, and Fire take form?
Intimately familiar with Metal and Wood’s bonds,
It remains to nurture them tenderly in the womb.
When the two substances harmonize and their qi merges,
One must rely on Bing Fire to refine and compress.
Bing Fire is originally my life,
Its seasons and cycles arranged by the law’s decree.
Naturally aligning with heaven and humanity’s workings,
Who has seen the immortals’ true path?

True Earth’s alternate names:
Yellow Earth, True Earth,
Purple Earth, Chrysanthemum Flower,
Great Simplicity, True Yellow Sprout,
True Dragon and Tiger, Dual Qi Spirit Sand,
Great Return Elixir.

On the First Production of the Yellow Sprout from the Two Qi:
The Yellow Sprout arises when Qian and Kun unite in resonance,
Creation shapes its form.
Yin embraces yang’s soul,
Yang embraces yin’s spirit.
Yang’s numen shines with blood’s radiant clarity,
Yin’s truth gleams with jade’s luminous glow.
Seizing the moon, its pure light bursts forth,
Contending with the sun, red clouds scatter in chaos.
Its golden body heals all ailments,
Its skin grows on the yang’s position,
Secretly sharing yin’s essence.
It acts as matchmaker for the Five Metals,
Governing all stones as their master.
Those who understand it swiftly ascend to the celestial realms,
Those who remain ignorant dwell long in the dust.
In daily use, none recognize it,
Wandering blindly until their hair turns white.

Song says:
Qian and Kun’s resonance begins the form,
Creation’s origin lies in the Northern Gate’s completion.
Sun and moon revolve, souls and spirits unite,
Yin and yang mate, congealing as essence.
Clearly, a single qi grows from Metal,
Recognize the Yellow Sprout born from Water.
Countless are the fools in the world of dust,
Who use it daily yet know not its name.

**Discerning Lead and Mercury (Chapter Two)**

To refine the Great Elixir, first clarify the true origin of lead and mercury;
To conjoin and smelt the cinnabar, one must grasp the proper principle of Kan and Li.
Lead enfolds the marrow of yin—this is the Tiger, the Kan direction;
Mercury engenders the essence of yang—thus called the Dragon, the Li position.
Kan’s moon and Li’s sun serve as the ladder and mediator for their meeting;
Li’s maiden and Kan’s youth respond to the guiding principle of return and restoration.
Lead, nurtured by the pungent (辛), enables the Great Return Elixir to illumine even the coarse-clad who yet harbor gold within;
Mercury, gestating in the wood (甲), naturally dons its hue while containing the essence of wood.
Is lead mere worldly tin? Is mercury common silver?
Lead is the root and foundation of Heaven and Earth; mercury is the numinous qi of yin and yang.
Lead contains the solar essence (魄), mercury drinks the lunar spirit (魂).
Lead is true lead; mercury is no ordinary mercury.
Extracting the marrow of the Five Phases, they coalesce into gold;
Uniting the essence of the Two Images, they transform and congeal into liquid.
As the sun wanes and the moon waxes, the essence (魄) sinks and perishes;
As the yang spirit (魂) wanes and the moon’s fullness recedes, the yin essence (魄) ultimately dissipates.
Yin and yang unite in resonance, forming the Dragon and Tiger as husband and wife;
Water and fire reverse their intercourse, forging the Elixir of Qian and Kun.
Yang can restrain the essence (魄), circulating to spontaneously become gold;
Yin in form draws forth yang, revolving to begin as divine substance.
When yin and yang reach fulfillment, await the cinnabar that transcends the world;
When the cycles of water and fire conclude, behold the flowing liquid that ascends in rosy clouds.
Upon the crimson frost of the crucible, suddenly blazes the radiance of dawn’s glow;
Within the alabaster powder of the furnace, dazzles the luminous brilliance of auspicious snow.
Limpid as blood-red hues, the morning sun spills from Fusang;
Serene as water’s gleam, the autumn moon bathes the cold isle.
Swift as the crane of emerald peaks, solitary as the osmanthus of the jade tower’s bloom;
Fragrant as the Milky Way’s traverse, resplendent as the lotus’s verdant splendor in the distant sky.
At the moment of grinding, it scatters a fragrance of rich perfume;
At the ninth twist, its subtle radiance begins to shimmer.
Refined into treasure, ingested to restore youth,
A mere grain transforms one to soar in emptiness, feathered and roaming Heaven and Earth.

**Oral Instructions of Master Guangcheng (Chapter Three)**

The world bustles in vain, its course unending,
A hundred years pass like a fleeting dream’s glory.
Unknowing of the cloud-lane’s traveler,
They strive only to vie for fame in the dust.
If you wish to preserve your years, follow the Great One,
Swallow the numinous medicine to attain longevity.
Purely refine the marrow of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang,
Smelt the essence of Qian and Kun’s sun and moon.

**Transmitting the Two Flavors**

To subdue the Li Palace is effortless,
Seek and refine the essence from the Kan Gate.
Only when husband and wife unite in resonance
Will the Yellow Sprout be conceived, revealing its origin.
Without direct transmission from a master’s guidance,
All else is futile labor, wasted coin.
The fire-tending must persist through nine nines,
The Elixir’s completion awaits three years.

**Oral Instructions of Master Yang the Perfected (Chapter Four)**

The King of Huai refined autumn stone,
The Yellow Emperor prized golden flowers.
Let not the world’s people sigh in ignorance—
The immortals’ medicine pervades the Middle Kingdom.
No need for lead, no need for cinnabar,
Yet the deluded are as numerous as hemp.
Refine lead, smelt cinnabar,
And in an instant, the Yellow Sprout appears.
Once you obtain the Yellow Sprout, boast not,
Match this Yellow Sprout with the maiden’s house.
Husband and wife harmonize over years,
Clad in purple robes, riding clouds and rosy mists.
Test it with the grain—it is the River Chariot.

**Another Song**

Within yin lies yang, within yang lies yin.
Having recognized mercury within cinnabar,
One must seek gold within lead.
These two flavors are Heaven and Earth’s great treasure,
The utmost essence of sun and moon.
Whoever refines this shall not be deceived by lesser spirits.

**Oral Instructions of Master Liangqiu (Chapter Five)**

Lead in water, lead in fire—
The two leads of water and fire share a single origin.
Unknowing that the immortal lies within a foot’s reach,
One reverently simmers cinnabar in wine and vinegar,
Only for thousands upon thousands to vanish as smoke.
If, when subduing fire, it merely hardens,
And you wish to become an earthbound immortal,
Refine the Five Phases and complete the Four Images,
Cultivate virtue to aid the world, and truly ascend to Heaven.

**Oral Instructions of Perfected Lord Peng (Chapter Six)**

The creation of yin and yang needs no transmission—
Use only mercury as black lead.
Neither harming mercury nor lead,
This substance in the Dao is profound beyond profundity.
If the world recognizes the true Dragon and Tiger,
Attaining the Way lies but a moment away.

**Oral Instructions of Master Cheng (Chapter Seven)**

The White Tiger is the essence within lead;
The Green Dragon is the primordial qi within cinnabar.
Essence and qi unite to transform into the Yellow Sprout.
Lead, receiving mercury, becomes intimate,
Passing from nonbeing into being;
Mercury, receiving lead, transmutes its form,
Passing from being into nonbeing.
The two qi generate one another,
Returning to the True One.
Transforming the Four Images without losing the Five Phases,
Internally and externally, Kan and Li,
Yin and yang emerge and submerge.
Refining wu and ji, their radiant brilliance shines forth,
Gathering into azure peaks,
Dispersing back to the Purple Palace.
Metal and Water pair, numbers align with hexagrams,
Heaven and Earth open to merge in primordial chaos,
Sun and moon conjoin to complete the Three Powers.
The crucible is no different,
The fetal breath indistinguishable.
The heart resides in the abdomen, giving rise to a thousand wisdoms;
The medicine dwells in the vessel, transmuting myriad forms.
From *Zhun*’s inception at the zi hour,
To *Meng*’s cultivation at the wu hour,
Upon the furnace, rosy clouds ascend,
Their radiance outshining the sun.
Ingesting it prolongs life,
Rendering one immune to cold and heat.
Transmuting the Five Metals,
It becomes an eternal treasure for the world.

**Oral Instructions of Master Luofu (Chapter Eight)**

The world clamors with carriages and horses,
Youthful faces and raven locks do not endure.
Alchemical arts have been transmitted for ten thousand ages,
Yet seekers wander in confusion, unable to find the truth.
Finding no truth, harbor no regrets—
It is because the Yellow Sprout is not genuine.
Lead is lead, mercury is mercury,
Yet the world’s people all misuse them.
Herbal Yellow Sprouts, wooden Yellow Sprouts,
The world hears of them and vainly boasts.
Since ancient times, oral transmission leaves no trace on paper,
Those who burn them labor in vain, ruining their households.
Worthy of transmission, pass it on in succession,
Secure the original gate of this Dao.
Falsely transmitting to the unworthy invites calamity.
Father and son, Pang and Shu, must not speak of it—
Black-robed sulfur that does not smoke,
Ingesting it grants a lifespan of several thousand years.
Further, within the golden chamber of Heaven and Earth,
One sheds the mortal world, floating in emptiness to become a flying immortal.

**Oral Instructions of Yin Changsheng, Ninth**

Gold forms the bones, lead forms the body,
Yin and Yang unite as Dragon and Tiger in kinship.
At sixteen, the Three Powers harmonize,
The Eight Trigrams spread wide as the Dipper points to *yin*.

From *zi* to *wu*, no need to shift,
The seventy-two seasonal nodes must not err.
The old woman, through matchmaking, returns to the Great One,
Within the Purple Tenuity Palace, male and female arise.

The treasure within lead, the rarity within cinnabar,
This substance embraces the five spirits in its vastness.
Seven months of gestation, divided by the six *jia*,
A full year’s turning refines it into truth.

The Huainan method refines autumn stone,
The Yellow Emperor’s golden flower burns amber.
A cup of white wine, infused with ninefold fragrance,
Its crystalline radiance, sweet and pure, is called Dragon’s Nectar.

One may have it, another may not,
Three families under one roof, yet two sons share it.
Foxes and hares do not herd with horses to nurse,
Different kinds by nature bear distinct essences.

Darkness upon darkness, mystery upon mystery,
This method must not be passed to the unworthy.
The world knows not the medicine of the world,
Yet he who knows me returns life beyond Heaven’s decree.

**Oral Instructions of Chunyu Shutong, Tenth**

Now, the essence of the Great Yang
Is called the Azure Dragon.
The Azure Dragon belongs to Wood,
And Wood’s color is azure.

Within azure, fire is again concealed,
Fire’s color is red, returning to the south as cinnabar.
Wood is the mother of Fire, paired in the east,
Thus earning the name Azure Dragon—
Not the common wood of mortal inquiry!

The Azure Dragon is mercury, the maiden.
The scripture says: *"The maid by the river, numinous and most divine,
When fire is applied, she takes flight, unstained by dust or filth.
Ghosts hide, dragons vanish—none know where she dwells.
To master her, the Yellow Sprout is the root."*

The instruction states: The Yellow Sprout is lead, black,
Its color drawn from the north, the essence of the Great Yin.
It delights in stillness, excelling at restraining Yang.
Yang’s nature loves to fly, yet can be subdued by Yin.

Moreover, cinnabar belongs to Fire, Yang,
Harboring wondrous spirit within.
Lead belongs to Water, Yin,
Its nature restrains spirit—
Water extinguishes Fire, is this not clear?

The discourse says: Wood’s nature is upright, yet harmed by Metal;
Water’s nature is yielding, yet overcome by Earth.
Earth’s virtue is deep, yet harmed by Wood;
Metal’s nature is firm, yet melted by Fire.
This is the mutual conquest of the Five Phases,
The eternal principle of the Great Dao.

Thus, when people fail to grasp Yin and Yang,
The depths of lead and mercury remain obscure.
Mistaking their harmony for elixir,
They ingest it, and poison surges through the five viscera—
For they have not fathomed the floating and sinking.

Those who consume such things,
How can they meet a good end or long life?
Most die young—truly pitiable.
The world lacks discernment, drowning in confusion,
And thus brings ruin upon itself!

**Oral Instructions of Xuanhuangzi, Eleventh**

Seek immortality and the Yellow Sprout,
Yet first obtain the True Lead’s Flower—
Only that which forms of itself
May be wrought into Golden Sand.
Refine it once more, ingest a single grain,
And soar through space into the azure clouds,
Roaming beyond heaven and earth,
Where every place is home to immortals.

**Oral Instructions of Master Yinxizhen, Twelfth**

The supreme medicine must employ lead,
Gathered in a cup toward the dark.
If you would know the Yellow Sprout,
First inquire of the Yin Earth.
True Lead matches the Kan Man,
With Wu and Ji attending—
This alone is called Yellow Alum,
The very ancestor of Returned Elixir.

**Oral Instructions of Master Taozhizhen, Thirteenth**

True Mercury is not quicksilver,
Yet from this it is obtained.
If you seek true quicksilver,
First seek the power within Kan.
Another instruction says:
Within the errant, one true Yang resides,
The child of Water, belonging to the West.

**Oral Instructions of Master Xuanguang, Fourteenth**

The art of nurturing life
Is neither difficult nor easy.
The world uses lead,
Yet fails to cultivate the will of lead.
Scarcely has it shed its black robe
When its pure essence is revealed.
Upon the ash pool’s blazing fire,
The knife’s edge follows the law.
Lead’s hundredfold return is the same—
When drawn, take care not to lose it.
Hold it through the Crimson Gate,
And at the touch, it hardens like stone.
The medicine employs True Water Essence,
Eight as the foremost number.
Wondrous essence, too, is eight ounces,
Issuing from the Yang person’s body.
When the two blend in harmony,
The Rice Mountain must be kept secret.
Upon the Black Dragon’s curve,
When the count reaches one ounce of True Dragon Brain,
It must be rich and unctuous.
White is the True Dragon Brain,
Gray is not.
Used at the appointed time,
The two substances unite as one.
The Great Returned Elixir’s reflection
Requires discernment in its preparation—
Take care to use a vessel of true gold.
Should one grasp these words,
Earthly immortality is but this.
If misapplied,
Calamity will descend in an instant.
Ten years of obscured sunlight,
Five years without seeing light—
Yet if a single grain is transmuted,
In an instant, one attains sagehood.

**Song:**
*The Cantong Qi* and *Jinbi* conceal their secrets,
Yet the Yin Lord’s preface clarifies the steps.
Should the adept encounter the Pure Clouds’ instructions,
From this, Dragon and Tiger recognize their true form.

Heaven’s primordial qi arises from emptiness,
The rosy-cheeked elder’s body like suet.
Within fire, the body transforms—still within fire,
The immortal, content, is called the Mystic Pearl.

The world knows softness but not hardness,
Claiming the Yellow Sprout bears a yellow hue.
Only when one reaches the realm of Cup and Lead
Do they realize the Yellow Sprout is not yellow.

**Oral Instructions of Master Erzhu Ao, Fifteenth**

Heaven set, earth established, the primordial chaos divided,
Creation’s blossoms burn everywhere.
One Yin, one Yang—thus the Dao is formed,
Autumn Stone, pale, begets descendants.
Xuanwu and Zhuque illuminate the path ahead,
The True Mercury of Yongquan guards the cosmos.
In the crucible, lead is refined into treasure,
The Old Woman hides her head and refuses to emerge.
Within the twelve gourds, the Purple River Cart,
The forty-two breaths blaze in the immortal’s cave.
Complexion like jade, visage like frost,
The date leaf’s crimson, polished to perfection.
Seizing sun and moon, they enter the furnace,
Flaming, radiant—yet the soul remains unlost.
If not to relieve the world’s hunger, cold, and sickness,
Better to hasten and depart to study the Dao.

Boil the White Tiger’s form in dark waters,
The Beast’s furnace, above and below, unfathomable.
The Great Image does not wander in the rabbit’s burrow,
Great awakening is not bound by petty details.
The deluded, their hearts astray, all lose the way—
Not passed down to the blind of the lower realm,
Lest they bring ruin to clan and self.

Six praises, six laments—
Erzhu Ao has departed for Penglai,
Ascending as an immortal in broad daylight, an ancient secret.
The crane calls ahead at Dongting Lake,
I pay homage to my sacred ancestor, who preserved the art.
Departing, the primal sound sweet as honey,
One seven, two sevens, seventy thousand complete.
Opening the furnace, suddenly a ball of fire appears,
Radiant, blazing, resplendent.
Though not to relieve the world’s hunger, cold, and sickness,
Better to seek the Dao and dwell in the Golden Chamber.

**Oral Instructions of Master Chongxu, Sixteenth**

I sigh in envy of the mighty river’s moonlit shadow,
The lord of gold arises, revealing the heart of lead.
One must strive to seek the immortal’s formula,
Lest the years and months slip by in vain.

**Another Song:**
Ninefold refinement of lead’s essence completes the Great Dao,
Why should my family fear not attaining long life?
At dawn, I seek Nongyu to pass through the immortal’s palace,
At dusk, I visit Magu to enter the Great Clarity.
The divine illumination originally stems from the numinous qi,
Yet Emperor Wu of Han knew only worldly passions.
All things now are but emptiness and silence,
A lifetime adrift, leaving only a floating name.

**Oral Instructions of Master Dong the Immortal, Seventeenth**

The sun’s soul and moon’s spirit, formless,
Gathered in their natural, pristine state.
Their union with immortals is truly beyond discourse,
Rising to the clouds above the Yellow Sprout.
Dragon soars, Tiger leaps—transforming the Golden Field,
From beginning to end, one must obtain the lead of transcendence.
To build a home, to dwell naturally,
At the moment of pairing, it is instantly known.
Recognizing the parting from the womb, one longs to speak,
Yet it lies not in written texts or oral instructions.

**Oral Instructions of Master Yuanyang, Eighteenth**

*The Returned Elixir Chapter*, *The Returned Elixir Chapter*—
To obtain the Yellow Sprout, first ignite the lead.
Yang Ren does not flee in fire,
How can Yin Bing be wrought?
The hen incubates the egg until the days are complete,
The mother bears the child after ten months.
If only Kun comes to serve as dwelling,
Why fear Kun will not act?
My method lies before your eyes—
Defy it, and you’ll wander for ten thousand kalpas.
The Eight Stones must flee in fire,
Do not play with water and waste your efforts.
The Returned Elixir is not difficult for the world to learn,
It is only that people of this age lack the will.
Should you understand Master Wei’s ten laments,
A thousand turns of seawater will transform into mulberry fields.

**Oral Instructions of Master Luo Gongyuan, Nineteenth**

The world does not know the elixir possesses spirit,
Yet if one tests wolfsbane, it will surely harm.
Knowing the world holds both good and evil,
Why not draw near to good neighbors?
Nüwa refined the Five Constants’ qi,
Transforming and shaping it to mend heaven and earth.
Thirty-six strategies the world knows,
Seventy-two stones arrayed in their places.
Heaven attains the One and thus endures,
Earth attains the One and thus abides.
Metal, refined by fire, becomes essence,
Wood, turned to charcoal, does not decay.

Thus know: only through refinement and essence,
How could the Great Return not be attained?
Condense my spirit, settle my heart,
With focused intent, one may transmute to gold.
The River Chariot is drawn from lead,
The Crone’s Daughter must be sought within mercury.

Adjunct substances circulate widely,
The Great One emerges from water into the public measure.
Huainan stirred the cauldron, Pengzu’s mountain market altered the nature of sacrificial beasts,
Records of departed fragrance and secret-tasted salt.
Attaining the Dao, they converge in the land of no death.

Civil and martial arts must not be neglected,
Beneath the crucible, only spread the green sea,
Within the furnace, use less of the mulberry’s sun.

Resplendent as fish scales piercing the eye’s light,
One must follow Wei Bo in the clouds,
Not learn from Chang’e’s concealment in the moon.

Dengdu’s name falls to the celestial treasury, the earthly underworld’s yin officials greatly fear,
Blades, water, and fire cannot harm,
How much less insects, snakes, tigers, and rhinos?
Towering, the golden bones all harden,
Lush, the green body with its verdant fur.
Once observed the Eastern Sea’s many turns,
Several times stolen the Queen Mother’s peaches,
Commanding the Thunder Duke, dispatching spirits and ghosts,
A thousand years but a brief parting from Liaodong’s waters.

Firmly seal and refine, must bind with purple smoke and jade-green flames that spout upon men.

Riding dragons, mounting cranes, captivating cities,
In seven days, one should return to the Way of the Viscount of Wei.
This is easy yet profoundly difficult.
Green Dragon and White Tiger coil of themselves,
The yin chariot is damp, the yang chariot dry.
Husband and wife face each other, settled within the hexagram,
The four directions’ ends stain with color,
Five kings and marquises all resign their offices.

**Oral Instructions of Master Baopuzi, Twentieth**

Cinnabar and mercury enter the Flowery Pool,
The Yellow Sprout is gathered, yet none know.
This is the oral instruction left by immortals,
The world clamors with confused words.
For seventy years, entrusted to one person,
Bestowed only upon those with immortal bones.
Each matter must be transmitted hand to eye,
Gathering occurs in but a moment’s time.
The River Chariot rests within the Cinnabar Field,
Subdued only at the Yellow Sprout’s side.

**Oral Instructions of Master Zhiguzi, Twenty-First**

If lead is true,
It does not lose its household minister.
If lead is not true,
Its mercury will be hard to approach.

**Oral Instructions of Master Yang Xuan, Twenty-Second**

In the world, everyone seeks the medicine,
Yet each originally fails to find it.
Some say use lead, some say do not,
But when it comes to using lead, it is still wrong.
Use lead, do not use lead,
Not using it grants long years.
Use lead, must use lead,
Using lead, reside in the Cinnabar Field.
Without lead, the elixir does not form,
The Returned Elixir is born in lead.
The Metal Duke can restrain water.
Black lead contains the Yellow Sprout,
The Yellow Sprout enters mercury’s house,
Covered and borne by the River Chariot.

**Song:**
Lead emerges from within lead,
Lead of the same color yet not the same.
If one can distinguish black and white,
Each day is a celestial elder.

**Oral Instructions of Monk Ruonè, Twenty-Third**

The Yellow Sprout, cinnabar, and mercury concoct,
The yin husk contains the yang flower.
Without grasping the Yellow Sprout’s principle,
The Returned Elixir’s path remains distant.
People of the world refine the medicine to its utmost,
All recognize lead’s yellow flower.
The yellow flower is a dead thing,
How can it reach the immortals’ realm?
The Yellow Sprout is not an external medicine,
The inner image extracts its essence.
When reaching the Yellow Sprout’s ground,
Gold and silver are but vain boasts.

**Song:**
If the sprout is lead,
Depart from lead by ten thousand miles.
If the sprout is not lead,
Begin from lead.
Lead is the sprout’s mother,
The sprout is lead’s child.
Having obtained the golden flower,
Abandon lead and do not employ it.

**Zhang Hua the Perfected’s Song of Lead and Mercury, Twenty-Fourth**

The Red Dragon transforms into powder,
The White Tiger sharp as frost.
Within, cast the stone’s liquid,
Still requiring the Emperor’s Flowing Sauce.
Regulate the spirit, purify the five viscera,
Desiring to refine the Three Lights.
Firmly guard the nature of solid ice,
How can yin employ yang?

**Oral Instructions on the Two Flavors**

The tiger crouches, the dragon also hides,
The dragon first lurks, then subdues the tiger.
Simply complete the River Chariot’s work,
No need for embankments or defensive concerns.
The Yellow Elder studied flying immortality,
Madly deluded, unable to find the path.
Turning back, he pointed to the female phoenix,
Unfathomable are yin and yang’s numbers.
Yet sitting in the Great One’s palace,
Only then do Shen and Shang meet.
Left and right, drawing near the spirits,
The four phases all support and protect.
Heaven and earth’s model is complete,
Naturally, immortals will attend.

**Oral Instructions of the Prefectural Judge of Jianzhou, Twenty-Fifth**

Within the nine nines, the Qian body opens,
The Flowery Pool’s golden liquid naturally lingers.
Upon the yin-yang crucible, first appears radiance,
Within the lead-flower furnace, the Three Powers are tested.
Then know creation lies in human hands,
With proper technique and true medicine, spirits come of themselves.
At this stage of cultivation, one should transcend the world,
The four seasons need not bitterly urge.

**Critique:**
Its color shines brilliantly, illuminating sun and moon,
Endless transformations, beyond thought.
But once lead and cinnabar become treasure,
Cease the firing, freely let bing and ding blow.

**Laozi’s Song of Lead and Mercury from Hangu Pass, Twenty-Sixth**

Red lead, black lead, the Great Elixir’s head,
Red lead, black lead, their bodies the same.
Black metal extracts essence, red extracts marrow,
Understanding the use of red and black: medicine without red enters black to preserve long life,
Using black to enter red, celestial immortals achieve the Great Returned Elixir, its reflection clear.
The two inverted methods are both called lead,
Black can transform into red celestial immortals.
Those of the utmost Dao must not be careless,
Greed for wealth and lust for beauty need not be transmitted.
At the head of Hangu Pass, Liangshi Mountain,
Laozi carved these words into stone.

**Oral Instructions of Master Cen Zhenren, Twenty-Seventh**

Heaven generates the Great Simplicity,
Earth produces numinous essence.
Able to subdue, able to fly,
Transforming like spirits.
Yin and yang’s ancestral founder,
The Dao accords with ruler and minister.
The sage’s secret treasure,
Not heard by the unworthy.
Moreover, the Great Simplicity is the ruler,
Numinous essence the minister.
Harmonizing the two natures,
Inhaling and exhaling, they swallow each other.
As husband and wife,
Male and female in marital kinship,
Transforming, hooking, and pulling,
Love transmits the truth.

**Song:**
Eastern Green Dragon,
Bing, ding, jia, yi.
Western White Tiger,
Ren and gui congeal the liquid.
The two qi contain the true,
Hard for the world to find.
Grasping this treasure,
One water, one stone.
The ash pool’s flames blaze,
Removing names from death’s register.

**Transmitted Heart Instructions, Another Song**

The water spirit casts into golden jade,
Heaven and earth’s sun and moon essence.
Kan and Li achieve completion,
The Three Powers display their names.
Yang numbers reside in yin’s execution,
Yin numbers return to yang’s punishment.
Desiring to know the inverted technique,
Mutual overcoming is mutual generation.

If one refines the various Eight Minerals,
A thousand, ten thousand—none will succeed.
Those who seek the true Dao
Must seek *geng* upon *ren* and *gui*.

**Cui Xuanzhen’s Minshanzi Oral Instructions, Twenty-Eighth**

The Minshan treasure-chamber, abode of the Nine Immortals,
Sun and moon coil within its hollow depths.
For true persons ever guard this place,
Jade remains coiled, *qi* endlessly at ease.

Once a traveler to Haijiao and Kunqiu,
Far controlling dragon teams, he traced their tracks.
Refining, he achieved the Ninefold Transformation of *hua*,
Within, white silver amassed in recompense.

The jade hare of the moon, the yang within *kan*,
Outwardly yielding in form, inwardly firm.
The two images—male and female—share one body,
Just as gold hides within water.

Gold and water unite as *hun* and *po*,
The Three Powers transform, truly unfathomable.
Suddenly, dragon and tiger intertwine,
Giving birth to the dragon-child in the unseen.

Its form resembles congealed butter, the yellow sprout of snow,
Or the jade blossoms of Xuanpu.
Not born of worldly scheming,
But the secret instructions left by true persons.

Leave no flaw in these secret instructions,
For in the crystal mountain’s stone chamber lies cinnabar.
Those who attain the supreme Dao follow this method,
And fly to take the Green Dragon as their kin.

*Ji-hun* completes the celestial circuit, forming *qi*-substance,
Once more conjoined with mercury, firmly sealed.
Like a son returning to wed the young maiden,
Or Su Qin and Zhang Yi’s persuasions—love cannot be lost.

This thing passed down is the yellow sprout,
Layer upon layer, the golden crucible holds golden blossoms.
Refined into realgar, the reclining elixir-sand,
Sealed with the Six-One method, it must be kept secret.
Let no flaw mar the divine chamber.

The fire-timing begins with the first yang,
*Qian* and *kun* form its beginning and end.
Civil warp and martial weft awaken the numinous mechanism,
One method—the secret decree of the former kings.

Heavenly toads and spiders all revive,
When the elixir crucible opens, the Dao’s nature is revealed.
Each cycle brings wondrous transformations, new forms arise,
Their radiance—crimson, purple—defies description.

Then take the golden vessel, use mercury as the repository,
When the world’s light is exhausted, the Red Dragon flies.
Burning gold, the Minshan adept learns the Dao,
Receiving the true person’s mysterious decree.

The mysterious decree speaks only of mercury and lead,
Refining the yellow sprout, the body does not die.
Refine the elixir, refine the will, refine the spirit,
Do not pursue fame or profit—manifest pure fragrance.

Flee fame, withdraw beyond the dust,
Dwell in quietude, attune to the highest.
Do not imitate the world’s clamorous, shallow men,
Who toil their whole lives for renown.
Though they yearn for long life,
They cannot escape the marketplace.

**Dou Zhenjun’s "Seven-Returned Sand" Song, Twenty-Ninth**

The Metal Duke is sixty,
At sixty, the Metal Duke is old.
The Maiden is sixty,
At sixty, the young maiden is young.

The Metal Duke is thirty,
The Maiden grows ever younger.
The old man gains a young wife,
The withered willow sprouts fresh shoots.

Husband and wife in one place,
Complete the Dao in harmonious union.

The root is the yellow sprout,
The Metal Duke’s primal family.
The Maiden enters the lead chamber,
In an instant, the earth transforms to cinnabar.

The inverted moon joins the upright moon,
The upright moon must be swiftly secured.
Seal firmly, seal again,
Sealing like the elixir family.

*Bing* and *ding* spread below,
Chaos itself turns sweet and fragrant.
Seven and eight—yang numbers reach their peak,
Nine and six must be added again.

The four shells—yang now full,
Five colors like the dawn’s glow.
Remove the yang, discard the inverted moon,
Above, the finest yellow sprout.
Yellow is the color of gold,
White is the white horse’s tooth.
Transforming, it becomes the conveyance,
Thus called the River Chariot.

Mysterious brightness and hidden submission,
Husband and wife share one home.
This is the King Yang’s technique,
The Yellow Emperor’s golden blossom.

The wise conceal it,
Fools boast of it to others.
Those who grasp this Dao
Ride cranes to the white clouds’ edge.

**Han Zu’s Celestial Master Oral Instructions, Thirtieth**

Lead draws out marrow, marrow draws out essence,
Essence and marrow unite—the elixir must form.
One catty of mercury, seventeen taels,
One tael transforms into lead’s essence.

Use this lead-essence to make the great elixir,
Laozi’s Ninefold Refinement enters life’s mortar.
One tael of mercury has an ox’s strength,
Consuming it, one’s appearance becomes immortal.

An immortal’s appearance—sinews and bones firm,
Sinews and bones strong, reversing withering.
Cut out the tongue if asked—no need to speak,
Unable to conceal or reveal, appear or hide.

Guard your words, do not act madly,
Lest the celestial gods above grow angry,
And bring misfortune or the blade’s gleam.

**Guo Zixian of Guozhou’s Oral Instructions, Thirty-First**

The White Maiden, just sixteen,
Boasts a delicate frame, a jade-like face.
Ever sighing at the months without a good matchmaker,
Day and night alone, she sleeps by herself.

Her parents do not understand her heart,
Casually speaking of Zhang San or Li Si.
Several times the talks come to nothing,
Making her ashamed to heaven, ashamed to earth.

Suddenly, the Yellow Crone comes knocking,
Saying the Metal Duke’s nature is gentle.
She takes their two fates to consult Junping,
Junping declares this a fine match.

Neither biased nor crooked, it accords with heaven and earth,
Examining the cause, it is most fitting.
To this day, their descendants fill the imperial realm.
Were it not for the Yellow Crone’s efforts,
How could yin and yang have united?

**Cao Zhenren’s Oral Instructions, Thirty-Second**

Seize the Eastern Green Dragon,
Pair it with the Western White Tiger.
Then take the Southern Vermilion Bird,
Match it with the Northern Dark Warrior.

Trace these four to their root,
Originally of the same ancestral clan.
Yet people do not know to explore this,
Mistaking many stones for the marquis.
They do not understand how to unfold yin and yang,
To pair them as husband and wife.

Yin and yang’s *qi* are inherently dual,
Only then can they unite.
Of these, the most wondrous
Is the Central Earth.

The clay furnace needs no artifice,
But the fire’s management requires diligence.
Each day, two hexagrams’ timing,
Advance and retreat follow the measure.
Exhaustively study the moon’s waxing,
Lest wind and rain be lost.

After ten months, the returned elixir is complete,
The body freed from poverty and suffering.
When the blue sea turns mulberry fields,
You will witness the change.

Whoever obtains my Dao,
Must not lightly pass it on.
To casually reveal heaven’s mechanism
Brings calamity upon seven generations.

**Han Yunzhong, Recluse of Mount Taibai, Oral Instructions, Thirty-Third**

The great Dao is vast and distant,
Yin and yang are hard to fathom.
Creation and transformation arise,
Yet people cannot comprehend them.

Vainly discussing emptiness, they white their hair by the thousands,
Wasting wealth to prolong life,
Yet preserving their complexion brings injury and ruin, shortening their years.

Those of past and present who pursue this Way have met ruin in droves, their eyes straying from true teaching, their minds unclear on the essential aim. They call mercury yin and the Four Yellows yang, cast crude lead into the mix, and gather flowers as earth—herbs and trees they name dragon and tiger. Common gold and silver they pair as mother and child, refining elixirs and consuming them, only to court impermanence. Such errors fill the world, gross and deluded.

In my own past inquiries, I too traversed this path, yet how could I have known the subtle art holds a wondrous method, uniquely revealing the utmost truth? Water is lead, it is mercury—the male within Kan, its virtue residing in Ren and Gui. Refine yin to dissolve and subdue; after nine cycles of sinking and rising, the count is complete and Qian is formed, matched with metal in the western position. Though the world also employs these, they fail to grasp their origin.

Dragon and tiger possess form, hardness and softness distinguish themselves. The Metal Lord extinguishes fire; true white snow is required. The Five Movements transform and generate; fire is naturally subdued—this alone is real.

Mercury dwells within Li, obtaining the female; Li is fire, cinnabar. Attaining Ren, Gui, Bing, and Ding, it returns qi to the eastern blue yang. White concealment emerges from the center, present before one’s eyes yet difficult to perceive, obscure and indistinct, truly veiled in mist.

**Oral Instructions of Yan Junping, Thirty-Fourth**

Lead is lead, mercury is mercury—only these two are lead and mercury.
Dragon is dragon, tiger is tiger—only these two share a common ancestor.
If you can recognize this Kan and Li palace,
Beneath the Li palace, yellow earth emerges.
Yellow earth yields the yellow sprout,
Beneath the yellow sprout, golden flowers form.
When golden flowers form,
Beneath the golden flowers, purple essence congeals.
When purple essence congeals,
Beneath the purple essence, white gold appears.
White gold sinks while yellow gold floats;
The world gathers the sinking as the elixir’s head,
Seeking the red marrow to blend and sow.
There is a time for sowing, a day for harvesting,
Exchanging sinew and bone to extend lifespan—
Celestial immortals and earthly immortals beyond imagination,
Transmuting lead, iron, even tiles and shards.

One, two, three, four, five—
Water, fire, wood, metal, earth.
Simply understand this secret,
And you tread the path of longevity.

The Great Returned Elixir shines in the mirror, complete.
