**The *Tai Bai Jing***

**Title:** *Tai Bai Jing* (*Scripture of the Great White*). The original text does not specify an author, but it likely dates to the late Tang or Five Dynasties period. The *Daoist Canon Index* attributes it to Shi Jianwu. One scroll. Source text: *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongshen* Section, *Zhongshu* Category.

### *Tai Bai Jing*

The *Sacred Records of the Yellow Emperor* states: In the first year of the Yellow Emperor’s reign, on the first *yin* day of the *yin* month, he fasted at Mount Shou. Fang Ming and Li Mu accompanied him to the summit of Mount Juci, where they paid homage to the Great Lord Chen. There, he was bestowed with the *Twelve Scrolls of the Divine Mushroom and Numinous Charts* and nineteen formulas for gold and silver.

The Yellow Emperor then ascended Mount Wangwu, where he opened a stone casket and uncovered a jade tablet, obtaining the Way of the Nine Cauldrons’ divine elixir and the flying snow furnace fire. Later, he traveled to Mount Emei, where he encountered the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign. He bowed in reverence and entreated the Way of the Immortals.

The Sovereign said: "Do you not know that Heaven possesses the Mysterious One, born of the Great Yang, named Flowing Pearl? It is the gate of all wonders. If you cultivate it, you may attain longevity, ascend on clouds, and pay homage to the Jade Emperor."

The Yellow Emperor received this teaching with gratitude. At Mount Ke, he cast a golden crucible and compounded the Great Return Elixir of Flowing Pearl. He commanded that it be transmitted to later generations. At Lake of the Crucible, he ingested the elixir and ascended to Heaven. At that time, seventy-two of his ministers who had also consumed the elixir ascended with him.

Previously, the Yellow Emperor, fearing that the Way of the Golden Elixir might be lost, entrusted the Nine Cauldrons’ divine elixir to his eldest son, charging him to transmit it to posterity. He admonished him, saying: "This Way is most weighty. It must be passed only to the worthy. If given to the unfit, it will bring disaster upon them."

The eldest son then fasted on Mount Dongming, casting a golden fish into the eastern flowing waters and swearing a blood oath. Later, he transmitted the Way to the Master of Mount Shu. From then on, it was passed from sage to sage, from worthy to worthy, from the benevolent to the benevolent. Those who attained the Dao were beyond count. Heaven’s love for humanity is profound, yet if one’s heart does not align with the Dao, success remains elusive. Among ten thousand, nine thousand fail to believe, and when they hear the Way, they clap in mockery—this is all too clear.

Thus, the celestial mechanism must not be lightly disclosed, nor the crucible and vessels carelessly handled. The foolish, cunning, greedy, deceitful, and false must never be allowed to see it or speak of it. Yet, in the transmission and refinement of the Way, there are ten prohibitions and ten permissions, forming the Ten Admonitions.

### The Ten Prohibitions

1. **Those who flatter with clever words and ingratiating manners, urgently seeking to obtain the Way while scorning others as fools and themselves as cunning.** They claim that if the Dao does not oppose them, their hearts will harbor no resentment. If a single word aligns with the Way, they demand it be transmitted to them. They speak of other matters while alluding to this one, or point to others to imply themselves, employing deceit in myriad forms and uttering honeyed words. Such persons must never be spoken to.

2. **Those who boast of their mastery of the Great Elixir’s methods, the gates of metal and stone, the refinement of cinnabar and mercury, or claim to have personally handled crucibles yet remain indifferent to the deeper meaning.** They first proclaim their own superiority, then barter knowledge for other matters. They boast of their schemes, claiming to encompass Heaven and Earth, repeatedly visiting and probing with questions. Such persons must never be spoken to.

3. **Those who, clad in tattered robes and worn shoes, claim poverty and beg for salvation, swearing gratitude in life and remembrance in death, invoking Heaven and Earth as witnesses and the gods as guarantors.** Such persons must never be spoken to.

4. **Those who, upon first acquaintance, speak with excessive familiarity and cunning words, probing shallowly into the Way.** If their questions are answered, they praise themselves and extol the other as a divine immortal. If their questions are difficult, they grow angry, slander the other, and dismiss them as frauds. They claim their own learning surpasses others’, yet their knowledge is shallow and fleeting. Such persons must never be spoken to.

5. **Those whose nature is avaricious, who covet gold yet refuse to spend even a single coin, scheming only for personal gain.** They bow low, flatter, and claim, "You are so kind—you surely won’t demand payment from me!" Yet they clench their fists, stubbornly demanding the highest arts. Such persons must never be spoken to.

6. **Those lacking discernment, who disregard the formulas and act arbitrarily, refusing to learn from a master.** Some claim a thousand coins suffice for one firing, others five hundred for one calcination. Gold vanishes with the smoke, stones scatter with the flames. When their desires are unmet, they slander the truly worthy, declaring that alchemy never succeeds and that such things do not exist in the world. They revile immortals when they see them and scowl at recluses, assuming all others are as ignorant as themselves. Such persons must never be spoken to.

7. **Those who, observing others, declare them unworthy, or seeing a man of integrity, call him evil-hearted.** They think, "If even I cannot succeed, how can you fulfill my desires?" Though they have lived many years, they are not yet old. They dismiss the elderly as narrow-minded and the widely experienced as mere meddlers. They presume to command the wise and question the learned, grasping a brush to measure the sky or tossing bricks to attract jade. Such persons must never be spoken to.

8. **Those of shallow and inferior nature, ignorant of the source of creation, their understanding dim and unable to comprehend the Dao of Heaven and Earth.** They seek only minor arts, fixated on profit. They care only for wealth, neglecting their spirit. They refine cinnabar and mercury, using silver, lead, copper, and malachite to boil mercury. When discussing such matters, they listen with delight, but upon hearing of the supreme medicine, they sneer in silence. They mistake the false for the true, claiming to progress from small to great. Such persons must never be spoken to.

9. **Those who, though they know the arts of transcending the world and seek those who have attained the Dao, remain haughty and unwilling to humble themselves.** They scrutinize others’ expressions and demeanor, scheming through the night and pursuing their aims at dawn.

Those who harbor only the thought of offering jade disks, yet lack the resolve to cede cities. They display petty cunning, seeking to deceive great sages. They dare to pose simple questions, only to provoke extraordinary matters. As the saying goes: *"One who does not quicken their pace downhill will seldom encounter opportunity."* Yet when the moment passes and is never met again, they may boast of frugality, claim loyalty, while cowardice rules their own hearts. They urge others to act in secret, startling them, feigning kindness and mercy, recklessly expounding esoteric texts, deceiving the foolish, and brazenly misleading the wise—all to curry favor, offering obsequious deference. Another saying warns: *"Those who transmit the Way to me do so only to repay human sentiment, not for wealth or treasure."* Such persons must never be spoken to.

10. **Those who, having chanced upon a master and grasped a fragment of the teaching, grow arrogant and fail to discern yin and yang.** They may grasp the head but not the tail, or the tail but not the head. How petty and easily sated! They boast to others of their knowledge. If they meet one who truly knows, they fawn and flatter, bowing and pleading, *"O Immortal Brother!"* They offer wives and concubines, vowing to live and die together, to serve as slaves and servants, forever awaiting commands, hoping for eternal union, even willing to be ground to dust. Later, when they learn a little of the path and deem themselves secure, they turn on their *"Immortal Brother,"* their bodies withering, their faces growing cold, their feasts dwindling day by day. Like one who catches a fish and forgets the trap, or reaches the shore and discards the raft, they declare, *"I have now attained the great matter and no longer need my former master. Remove the gate and threshold—I shall refine lead and mercury on my own!"*

Little do they know that the perfected see through people and things, foreseeing past and future. They discern from the outset that such a person is no vessel of greatness. How could they transmit the great affair of immortality, the supreme mechanism of Heaven and Earth, merely for pleasant words, a smiling face, or a cup of wine and a home-cooked meal? At first, such persons believe their work is done and betray their *"Immortal Brother."* Later, when they gradually realize their error, they slander the lofty adept, bringing misfortune upon themselves—who can blame them for their regret?

Alas! From ancient times to the present, such persons abound in the world. They, too, must never be spoken to.

These ten types of persons must not be spoken to—those who have attained the Dao should carefully heed this. To reveal the mysteries to them is to invite one’s own remorse. Yet to withhold the teaching entirely, calling it the *"hidden treasury of Heaven’s Way,"* is also improper. To transmit it to the unworthy is to squander the Dao, recklessly meddling with yin and yang—a grave error.

**The Ten Worthy of Transmission**

1. Regardless of poverty or wealth, high or low status—whether emperor, minister, lord, scholar, warrior, commoner, farmer, artisan, or merchant—any who possess the Dao may be taught. Yet one must first examine their character, weigh their worthiness, and only then transmit the teaching.

2. Those who do not seek alchemical gold or silver, nor rely on power or influence; who remain humble in wealth and unassuming in office; who seek the great Dao and long only for longevity; whose words are free of flattery and whose conduct is without deceit; who do not act on impulse but carefully consider their lifelong aspirations—if such a person is found, they may be entrusted with the teaching.

3. First, engage them in discourse to assess their foundation. If they are not ignorant of yin and yang, can comprehend the trigrams, understand the principles of creation, recognize the benevolence of Heaven and Earth, penetrate obscurity and clarity, deeply grasp advance and retreat, the Five Phases and Four Images, the Seven Returns and Nine Revolutions; if their conduct aligns with their practice, their body with their heart, yet they fear misfortune despite lacking virtue, or possess keen perception but lack true insight—if their beginnings are auspicious but their ends inauspicious, their gains followed by losses, with no chance for regret—then, if they can guard secrets, feigning foolishness while holding wisdom, carefully examine them. Such a person may be taught.

4. Those who toil endlessly over family affairs, obsess over reputation and status, pursue pride and elegance—these must not be spoken to. But those who uphold truth and integrity, are content with little, unburdened by worldly affairs, free from family entanglements, indifferent to fame and profit, unfeeling toward kin, and guileless toward others—these may be taught.

5. Those with a heart of kindness and mercy, without partiality; who wish to give generously but lack the means; who revere the lofty yet live in poverty—carefully observe their conduct and concealment. These may be taught.

6. Those who serve their lord with loyalty, remain humble in high office, endure meager salaries and poverty with patience, uphold truth without restlessness, cultivate tranquility, avoid frivolity, dwell in emptiness, and do not covet fame or rank—these may be taught.

7. Those who serve their parents at home with filial piety, known throughout the neighborhood; whose benevolence and virtue shine forth; who maintain purity and simplicity, and aspire to longevity—these may be taught.

8. Those who do not contend with others, whose hearts are free of enmity; who take the Dao of Heaven as their mind, not fixating on the elixir; who merge with the Dao without intent, finding the Dao naturally before them—these may be taught.

9. Those without family or burdens, like wild cranes and solitary clouds; unconstrained by worldly affairs, unbound by social conventions; unknown to others and knowing no one; who long for longevity but have not met the supreme Dao—these may be taught.

10. Those who, when the Dao flourishes, dwell in mountain caves, alone in clouded forests, their years and virtues high, their worldly ties severed. Then, observing their words and deeds, if they do not deceive the weak or the guileless—these may be taught.

These ten types of persons are worthy of transmission. Those who have attained the Dao may, within a hundred years, transmit the teaching to three such individuals. As for the ten unworthy types mentioned earlier—take care never to transmit to them.

When transmitting the teaching, one must possess the **Ten Perfections** to achieve the great elixir. Without them, do not act recklessly.

**The Ten Perfections**

1. A place for cultivation and refinement. Carefully select a famous mountain or great peak, with auspicious terrain—mountains that gather and waters that flow—where the Five Phases generate one another, avoiding inauspicious mountains or malevolent waters that deplete and harm. Do not choose a place defiled by the eyes of the vulgar, where the impure and the sacred mingle. This is unacceptable.

2. Sufficient resources. If resources are ample, nothing will be lacking, and no delays will arise. The cultivator’s heart must be naturally at ease, not fabricating what does not exist or hesitating in doubt, lest regret follow.

3. A steadfast youth, who must be an extraordinary person. If not of lofty and numinous nature, they cannot be employed; merely having them attend to the talismans is insufficient, for they must not be privy to the Way. Beware lest they, being of small capacity, lightly divulge it to others.

4. The construction of the furnace and crucible, their height and depth, width and thickness, must all adhere to the established method. The direction from which the earth is taken, the clay’s orientation, the time and day of kindling the fire, the opening and closing of doors, the quantity of space, the number of layers—each must attain its proper Dao.

5. The crucible’s method must follow the Way, including its height and size, weight and breadth, thickness and depth. All must be meticulously examined to fathom its profound subtleties, aligning with the true text. Do not act recklessly. One who recognizes the true crucible is already a person of wisdom.

6. One must recognize the true medicine. Having recognized the true medicine, one must know the time of its gathering. Thus, the Prince of Huainan said: *"Gather it before the silkworms feed, use it after the fire’s transformation."* From this, we know it is neither metal nor stone, but a plant. The plant flourishes in the second month, decays in the eighth, and lies dormant in the tenth—this is clearly evident. In the eighth month, autumn stirs, frost descends, and withered branches and fallen leaves return to the earth.

7. [Missing]

Eighth Perfection: Gathering, harvesting, and preserving must be done with cleansing—this is called "bathing." Once bathed, strip away the roots and leaves, remove the bones and retain the essence, then welcome it into the chamber and assemble it. Thus, the union begins.

Ninth Perfection: When placing it into the crucible, arrange it according to the method, clearly distinguishing the Four Symbols, matching the Five Phases, aligning with the Two Modes, and uniting the Two Luminaries. The Creator is I—who then brings forth generation?

Tenth Perfection: Water and fire. Presence and absence unite at *zi* and *wu*, waxing and waning with the hour, all within the moon’s cycle. Flight and concealment are fully determined by the hexagrams. Only when cultivation reaches this point may one apply true focus—this is called the Tenth Perfection, and one who attains it is called a *zhi-shi* (perfected person). Yet if even one of the Ten Perfections is lacking, one cannot speak of the Dao. If the Ten Perfections are complete but one is flawed, the Dao remains incomplete. Thus, the *zhi-shi* examines and acts accordingly—is this not so?

The *Biography of the Master of Siming* states: "Four" refers to the Four Symbols—east, west, south, and north. "Bright" refers to the sun and moon. "Prior" means before heaven and earth, the first of all things. "Life" is the Dao. The Dao gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two, the Two give birth to the Three, and the Three give birth to the myriad things. It also says: The One is water; the Two is fire; the Three is wood. These three can complete the myriad things, and the myriad things are earth. Thus, the Three revolve and ultimately return to earth, and earth is Five. Five is the father of Four, and Four is the son of Five. Therefore, Five is the emperor and king, and Four is the eldest son. Thus, the emperor and king possess the virtue of nurturing, while the eldest son holds the power of execution. Together, the emperor and the eldest son form the number Nine—is this not so?

Some ask: The Three governs *Zhen* (Thunder), and *Zhen* governs the eastern palace. Four belongs to *Dui* (Lake), the western palace—why then is it called the eldest son? The answer: The eldest son begins in the *Zhen* palace and ends in the *Dui* palace, thus sharing the same name and color. Stillness is the root of movement. The *Book of Changes* says: "Like sounds resonate; like qi seeks its kind." This is its meaning. It also says: The Five Phases generate one another; the Four Symbols restrain one another, ultimately returning to earth. The myriad things are born from earth and die returning to earth. The Five Phases have different names but share the same essence—this shared essence is called the Mysterious. The Mysterious is water. Water can generate wood, wood can generate fire, fire can generate earth, and earth can generate metal. Metal is the White Tiger; wood is the Azure Dragon; fire is the Vermilion Bird; water is the Dark Warrior. The Dark Warrior restrains the Vermilion Bird; the White Tiger restrains the Azure Dragon. Thus, the ancients said: To stabilize the four directions, first observe the colors. Therefore, these matters are discussed together.

For example, silver, lead, cinnabar, and mercury naturally determine the four directions. In this way, one readily discerns water and fire and simultaneously knows the Dragon and Tiger. How could one not understand that water can extinguish fire and metal can overcome wood? How then could one remain deluded about the Great Dao? From this perspective, the thousands of classics and myriad books, the various masters and their discourses—all expounding the Five Phases, Eight Trigrams, Four Symbols, and Six Positions—would have long since lost their coherence without this foundation. For they do not speak of the divine water and flowery pond, nor do they discuss the mutual arousal of Dragon and Tiger.

Li Quan’s commentary on the *Yin Fu Jing*, citing the Yellow Emperor, states: Among the hundred methods of golden elixir, the essential lies in the divine water and flowery pond. Though the texts have existed from ancient times to the present, their principles remain obscure. The divine water and flowery pond are the mother of the myriad things, possessing a singular virtue, the first of the Five Phases. Seated facing south, it exists prior to heaven, prior to earth, and possesses substance—it is the mother of heaven and earth. Knowing the white and guarding the black, neither hard nor soft, like stone yet like water, it competes with nothing and is the most revered among the five metals and eight minerals. When settled, its color is like the Great Void, containing the five hues. The ancients said: "One thing contains five colors, eternally serving as the immortal’s emolument." How could the worthy and the gentlemen not understand this?

Once the divine water is clarified and transformed into the flowery pond, the Dragon and Tiger may then arouse each other within it. After the Dragon and Tiger have aroused each other, the flowery pond is discarded as useless. Thus, the ancients said: "Use lead yet do not use lead—you must work within the lead. If you seek within the lead, you will still err as before." It also says: "Use lead yet do not use lead—you must take from within the lead. To refine the Great Return Elixir, you must know that lead is the mother." And again: "Having recognized mercury within cinnabar, you must seek gold within lead." And: "Lead is the mother of sprouts; sprouts are the children of lead. Once the golden essence is obtained, discard the lead." And: "If sprouts are lead, abandon lead by ten thousand *li*. If sprouts are not lead, begin with lead." And again: "The original elixir is fundamentally lead; within lead also lies the original elixir. To make the elixir, do not use lead—lead is the Great Elixir Field. The field is earth. The myriad things are born from earth."

Qingxiazi said: The Dao of immortality encompasses a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes, but none surpass the Dao of lead, mercury, divine water, and the flowery pond—particularly the single method of the mutual arousal of Dragon and Tiger. Since the time of the Yellow Emperor, this has never been committed to writing; only oral transmission of secret formulas and heart-to-heart transmission of spiritual talismans have preserved it. Now, I directly point to the divine water and flowery pond for the world, though I have not yet discussed the mutual arousal of Dragon and Tiger within the text. As for the refinement of the crucible, the regulation of fire times, and the advance and retreat of the firing process—these are the same as in other schools, and I will not elaborate further here.

As for the Eight Trigrams, Five Phases, seven returns and nine revolutions, the forms of crucibles and furnaces, the *jiji* and *weiji* hexagrams—these are all distinct matters. The alchemical school values only the practical methods of operation. If one can comprehend the divine water, flowery pond, and the mutual arousal of Dragon and Tiger, one has already grasped the essential secret of the Great Return Elixir.

Shi Jianwu’s verse says:
The divine water and flowery pond are the elixir itself,
East and west, high and low, observe each other.
I urge you: do not play with common lead—
Your livelihood and career would be better abandoned.

Lead—why fear it when it is fundamentally lead?
Yet where within lead can one seek immortality?

The Return Elixir is perfected in all directions—east, west, south, and north—
Yet how can one fault the immortals for refusing to transmit it?
Of the same color and name, harmonizing in fine resonance,
It may gleam brightly or sink deeply.
Heaven and Earth inverted, driving thunder and rain,
How could the Dragon’s leap ever escape the Supreme Yin?
The *Tai Bai Jing* concludes.
