**The Five-Nine Numerical Key for Gold and Stone**

He who seeks the Dao to obtain the elixir must first discern metals and stones, determining their forms and substances, and knowing the laws by which their virtues and flaws manifest.

**Cinnabar (朱砂):**
From Chen Prefecture (辰州), as large as peaches or dates, luminous and translucent like a pomegranate—this is the finest. If such is unavailable, use the best from *Maoya* (马牙). Next, take the deepest purple; the rest are unfit.

**Realgar (雄黄):**
From Wudu (武都), the color of a rooster’s comb, fine and moist with a reddish luster—this is superior. The crimson variety from Persia is inferior.

**Jade (玉):**
From Luantian (蓝田), its forms and hues vary, with white being the finest. Seek clarity, luster, and flawlessness; when struck, it should emit a clear chime—this is the best.

**Sulfur (石硫黄):**
From the forests of Lingnan (岭南), known as *Kunlun Yellow* (昆仑黄), the finest glows like amber. Persian sulfur is also usable but inferior in origin.

**Pumice (诱石):**
Found in crane and stork nests, its forms and sources vary. Only that from Liang and Han (梁汉), Jingzhou (并州), Songshan (嵩山), and Yongzhou (雍州) valleys—when split, resembling a twisted rope or *muzi* (暮子) fruit, large as a bowl or small as a fist, white as jade—is superior. All other sources are unfit.

**Red Stone Pitch (赤石脂):**
From Hao Prefecture (昊郡) and Ze Prefecture (泽州), smooth and glossy like rendered fat—this is the finest.

**White Stone Pitch (白石脂):**
From Hao Prefecture, sharing its source with red stone pitch, its form like congealed fat—this is the finest.

**Rock Crystal (白石英):**
From Shouyang (寿阳) and Ze Prefecture, its varieties are many. Seek transparency without blemish, and when submerged, it should blend with water—this is the best, regardless of size.

**Mica (云母):**
From Langya (琅琊), Pengcheng (彭城), Qingqi (青齐), and Luyou (庐州), it appears in six forms. When viewed in sunlight, it reveals:
- Yellow-white with green tints: *Yunying* (云英).
- Green-yellow with crystalline brilliance: *Yunyè* (云液).
- Pure white without admixture: *Yunjing* (云精).
- Green-white with black streaks: *Yumu* (云母).
The finest shimmers with five colors, dazzling the eye.

**Stone Calcite (石锺乳):**
From Sha Prefecture (邵州), it need not be the finest in refinement, but if its color is lustrous, its bulk substantial and thick—it is usable.

**Lodestone (磁石):**
From Ci Prefecture (磁州), if it attracts six or seven *jian* (缣, a silk measure) of iron, it is superior and usable.

**Borax (石脑):**
Though native to Maoshan (茅山) and Siping (四平), the finest comes from Puchou (蒲州), its color like fresh snow. Persian borax is superior.

**Sunrise Stone (阳起石):**
The root of mica, its hues vary. Only the yellow-white from Taishan (太山) is superior; the pure white from Xingyi (邢益) and Que Mountain (鹊山) is the best.

**Gold Ore (金精):**
Take unrefined, raw ore, its color like turquoise, marked with abundant golden specks—this is the finest.

**Yellow Alum (黄矾):**
From Guazhou (瓜州), it appears in five forms. In Daoist refining, yellow-white is most used; others are rarely employed. Its shape resembles gold, and when broken, reveals golden veins. When rubbed on silver, it turns yellow, capable of binding mercury so it adheres without falling. If it resembles *Maoya* (马牙) in form but crumbles when burned, it is unfit.

**White Alum (白矾):**
From Hao Prefecture is superior; from Zhao Prefecture, secondary. Others are unfit.

**Crimson Alum (绛矾):**
From Persia, resembling turquoise glass, the clearest is finest. All other sources are unfit.

**Chicken Droppings Alum (鸡屎矾):**
From Persia, its form resembles chicken droppings, its color a mix of green, yellow, and white. In this Dao, it is deeply secret and essential.

**Teaching Alum (诲矾):**
From Annan (安南) and Heling (呵陵), its color is red, yellow, or black. Among the five alums, this is indispensable. When broken, true specimens bear golden specks.

**Azurite (空青):**
From Liu Prefecture (柳州) and Yue Prefecture (越州), its color is deep blue-green, resembling spiral patterns, hollow within with a central void like a *Kunlun* peak. When fitted with a tree’s seedling, it aligns perfectly. If it bears golden specks like a *kǎokǎo* (拷拷) pattern, it is the finest. Also found in Guangzhou. This substance is often counterfeited; true specimens are rare and deeply secret in this Dao. Small spherical granules are also called *kongqing* (空青). *Zengqing* (曾青) differs not at all—false distinctions have been made. All green granules and their "mother" ore are likewise called *zengqing*, not merely the granular form. Today, each medicine has its distinct name; one must not dismiss the ancients’ classifications. I have listed them separately accordingly.

**Malachite (曾青):**
From Shushan (蜀山) and Yue Prefecture is finest, its color like turquoise or yellow gentian, or the green-purple of earthworm droppings—this is superior.

**Stone Rose (石桂英):**
From lactating sources, its color is pure white, staining the hand like snow when held—this is the finest.

**Flint (理石):**
From Liang Prefecture (梁州), Qingning (青宁), and Sanzhou (三州), it is excellent. When drawn like a needle, its yellow-white luster is most prized.

**Niter (朴硝):**
From Yizhou (益州), unexposed to wind is finest. Its color should not be dry or green-tinged—this is the best.

**Saltpeter (磋硝):**
From Yizhou, accumulated like frost in shaded earth. Some say it also comes from fire mountains, and snow-white, moist specimens are superior.

**Stone Gall (石胆):**
From Liang Prefecture and Xindu (信都), the finest is processed with *qiangli* (羌理), its color green with blue tints. Some from Laoshan (唠山) resembles a crescent moon, yellow-green in hue—this is good. Of these, Laoshan is slightly superior, but none surpass the quality of Puchou’s.

**Saltpeter (硝石):**
Natively from Liang Prefecture (梁州), Qiang Prefecture (羌武都), and Longxi (陇西), but that from Wuzhang (乌长国) is superior. During the Tang dynasty’s *Lín Dé* (麟德) era, in the year *Jiǎzǐ* (甲子), there was a Central Asian monk named *Fǎlín* (法林), a disciple of the *Bóluómén* (婆罗门) sect, who carried a *Fànjiǎ* (梵甲)—likely a Buddhist scripture or talisman—here to translate. He was instructed to make pilgrimage to Wutai Mountain (五台山), and upon reaching Fenzhou (汾州), Lingshi County (灵石县), he inquired: *"This place has abundant saltpeter—why not collect and use it?"*

At that time, there were twelve men, including *Zhào Rúguī* (赵如珪) and *Dù Fǎliàng* (杜法亮), who accompanied the monk in gathering it. After testing, they found it entirely unfit—far inferior to that of Wuzhang (乌长). Then, journeying to Zezhou (泽州), they saw its mountains lush and refined. Again, they were told: *"This place also has saltpeter—how could it be unfit for use?"* So, they took the monk *Língwù* (灵悟) along to collect it. Upon refining, it emitted a purple *qīnyīn* (紫姻) glow like a beacon. They said: *"This is a sacred medicine, capable of transforming the five metals—when all stones are exposed to it, they dissolve into water."* Comparing it with Wuzhang’s, they realized that Zezhou’s saltpeter was indeed usable. Repeated tests with metal confirmed its potency. Though slightly softer than Wuzhang’s, it was still effective.

**Heavenly-Clear Sand (天明砂):**
From the country of *Bōsī* (波斯), it is capable of tempering the five metal tools. This medicine is particularly prone to counterfeiting, so one must test it personally to distinguish true from false. When held in the mouth, it leaves no bitter, sour, or salty taste. The finest specimens are greenish-white in color. When refined, it does not boil, and its juice flows like water, drying to a consistency akin to *jiāogū* (胶枯)—a resinous substance. This is the true article. If it emits a purple *qīnyīn* (紫姻) vapor upon refining or has a lacquer-like residue on its surface, it is also genuine. One may then select and use it accordingly.

**Yellow Flower Stone (黄花石):**
Though once renowned yet useless, the true *Huánghuā Shí* originates from *Bōsī*—its finest. That from *Jiāngshù*’s *Běitíng* in *Qiánzhōu* ranks second, while inferior specimens abound wherever copper ore is found, rendering them unusable. Its form resembles copper ore, marked by golden specks and a crimson hue. When heated strongly, it emits a pungent *qīnyīn* blackness; when ground with mercury, it rises to the surface—this is the genuine article from *Bōsī*.

Some claim it resembles *zǐkuàngyù* (紫矿欲) or *qílínjié* (麒麟竭), but this is false. The true stone simply gleams with a lustrous sheen.

**Ashless Wood (不灰木):**
Hailing from *Bōsī*, it is the root of silver ore, resembling rotted wood. Even after prolonged heating, it does not ash; when burned, it remains greenish like wood and can refine mercury. Inferior specimens from other regions are unfit for use—*Bōsī*’s is supreme.

**Steppe Salt (戎盐):**
Found thirty *lǐ* beyond the city walls on high cliffs, it flows naturally, not crafted by man. Tasting it reveals no saltiness or throat-searing bite. True specimens are discerned by stacking eggs—good or poor becomes evident. Some say it comes from *Róngzhōu*, with greenish-white hues being finest. Its origin remains unclear, but when tested against *Hédōng*’s *Guānnèi* grain salt, *Róngyán* surpasses all others. Thus, it must be treasured.

**Great Yin Mystic Essence (太阴玄精):**
Extracted from the salt pools of *Jiěxiàn* in *Hébù*, it is the root of salt. Collected near water, it resembles jade or tortoiseshell. Black, dense specimens are worthless, while yellow-white, pure ones are finest. This too refines mercury into powder. Compared to *Yánzhōu* salt, it is slightly superior—hence, *Yánzhōu*’s is the best.

**Bitter Brine (卤咸):**
From the marshes seventeen to eighteen *lǐ* northeast of *Tóngzhōu*, it is another salt root, resembling fine *Hédōng* grain salt but tasting bitter, not salty. No region in this text matches it. Commonly misused is the soft, black, white-veined earth from flatlands, mistaken for brine—this is gravely erroneous.

**Slipstone (滑石):**
Finest specimens come from *Càizhōu* and *Qīngzhōu*, yet many mistakenly use that from *Kūnlún*, which, when mixed with *liùyīní* (六一泥), proves entirely unsuitable. For medicinal use, *Kūnlún*’s slipstone excels—its soft, white body, wax-like when shaved, is supreme.

**Cold Water Stone (寒水石):**
The best is pure white, resembling water—this is the true article.

**Barite (胡同律):**
Originally derived from the sap of a Western Domain tree, where its resin flows and congeals into this medicine. Also called *Hútóng Lèi* (胡同泪). The common folk, unaware of its true name, mistakenly call it *Hútóng Lǜ* (胡同律). Since "律" and "泪" sound alike, those unfamiliar with its proper name often miswrite it as *lǜ*, leading to widespread error. Its form resembles underground saltstone; goldsmiths use it for casting, and it excels in refining gold and silver—especially for gilding.

**Pomegranate Cinnabar (石榴丹):**
Sourced from *Tàihé Shān*, it resembles a pomegranate in shape, with a reddish exterior and seeds within like those of a pomegranate. Ancient lore claims that one *Yǔ Yóu* ingested it and attained immortality, though its veracity remains unverified. Within this Dao, it holds profound secrecy.

**Yu Remnant Grain (禹余粮):**
Mined from the mountains of *Shùhǎi Shùyáng Zǒuzhōu*, it appears in five hues—blue, yellow, red, white, and black. Recently, people have favored the yellow variety, but the best resembles *púhuáng* (蒲黄), with red also being fine; only the white, pure form is supreme.

**Calcined Sand (炮砂):**
Only the luminous, translucent variety is usable. It is said that while fire-mountain sand exists, none surpasses that from *Běitíng* in quality.

**Orpiment (雌黄):**
From *Wǔdū*, its color is bright yellow like gold foil, with a luster like mica when broken; the purest, unadulterated form is best.

**Gold Vein (金芽):**
Primarily from *Shǔ Jùn*, also found in *Jīngxiāng Dào*. It is black and smooth, with shattered veins resembling gold thread when fractured. Those afflicted with darkened limbs often brew it into wine for consumption, and it effectively alleviates the condition—known as *Jīnyá Jiǔ* (金牙酒).

**Red Earth (代赭):**
Sourced from the mountains of *Yànmén Jiè*. The red variety is superior; yellow is inferior.

**Further stated:**
The *Wèizhōu* border’s *Dàwáng Chéng* produces it, with those bearing red veins being the finest.

**Rock Salt (石盐):**
From *Píngzhōu*’s northern *Xī* borderlands, resembling black mica in form. Those with luster and smoothness are superior. *Yánzhōu* also yields it, though its black, softer variety is inferior—Persian rock salt is the best.

**Amethyst (紫石英):**
From *Tàihé Shān*, shaped like a pounded hemp head, luminous and translucent. Those wrapped in purple with clarity are supreme. The *Chénzhōu* border also produces it, and within this Dao, it is of great importance. Those with a purple, glossy exterior are the finest.

**Yellow Rock Seed (石中黄子):**
From the *Qìnshuǐ* source, shaped like a goose egg. When fractured, yellow juice flows within, like egg yolk. If consumed in measures of three to five *shēng*, it grants immortality and eternal life.
