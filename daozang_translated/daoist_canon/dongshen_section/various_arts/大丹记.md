**Record of the Great Elixir**

*Scripture Title:* *Record of the Great Elixir*. Originally attributed to Wei Boyang. The oral instructions are suspected to be a forgery from the Sui or Tang dynasties. One scroll. Base text from: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* Section, *Zhongjie* Category.

**Oral Instructions of the Great Elixir by the Primordial True Man Wei Boyang**

The dragon is mercury, the tiger is silver.
Mercury, within cinnabar, assumes blackness; silver, within lead, assumes blackness. These two blacks each receive the primordial blackness of Heaven and Earth.

Discourse: The nature of metal is cold; it is produced in the waters of the southern direction—mercury born from cinnabar is an example. Thus, it is said to be the position of yang containing yin.
The nature of stone is hot; it is produced within the black base of the northern direction—silver born from lead is an example. Thus, it is said to be the position of yin containing yang.

Discourse: The ruler of the five metals resides within the *Kan* trigram of the northern direction, where the mysterious conceals the yellow sprout.
It is also said: The child hides in the mother’s womb; the mother conceals the child’s embryo. Knowing the white, guarding the black, the numinous brightness comes of itself.
Mercury emerges from cinnabar, departing the mother’s womb of the southern direction, returning to the *Zhen* trigram of the eastern direction—*jia* and *yi* wood—to become the dragon.
Silver emerges from lead, departing the mother’s womb of the northern direction, returning to the *Dui* trigram of the western direction—*geng* and *xin* metal—to be called the white tiger.
Reversing cinnabar into mercury, reversing silver into gold—this is called the female and male.
Song:
The dragon calls to the tiger,
The tiger inhales its essence.
The two consume each other,
Meeting metal, they merge as one.
Thus, the record states: This is the Elixir of Dragon and Tiger.
It is necessary to reverse cinnabar into mercury, to reverse silver into gold.
Thus it is said: Lead is not lead, but mercury.
The Yellow Emperor saw its color like the bloom of gold, hence calling it *Beautiful Metal Bloom*.
The King of Huai refined *autumn stone*: the eighth month is the proper position of metal, its color greenish-white, thus called *autumn stone*.
Seeing its color yellow-white, like the first sprout of the myriad things, it is called *yellow sprout*.
Four names differ, yet their origin is one and the same.
Song:
Refining silver from lead,
The divine work is natural.
In the ash pool, flames blaze,
Lead sinks, silver floats—
This is called *yellow sprout*.
The sprout’s nature is slightly warm, its flavor especially sweet. Though it is the supreme medicine for longevity, as a solitary yang it is the sprout and cannot be taken in excess.
It must be combined with mercury to become the female-male *yellow sprout*.
Song:
Use lead yet not lead,
Return to act within lead.
The five metals strictly avoid lead and tin; they must not be mistakenly used.

Master Hu Gangzi asked Wei Boyang: “Since lead and tin are strictly avoided, what substance should be used for the crucible to refine them?”
Boyang replied: “The crucible—there is fundamentally no crucible; the medicine—there is fundamentally no medicine.
The *yellow sprout* is not lead,
Yet it is not apart from acting within lead.”
Hu Gangzi said: “If there is no crucible or medicine, and it is not lead, then what is refined to be called *yellow sprout*?”
The Venerable Wei said:
To plant grain, one must use millet;
To hatch a chicken, one must use its egg.
Swallows do not give birth to phoenixes,
Foxes and hares do not nurse horses.
Different kinds do not share the same species,
How can they dwell together as one?
To refine gold, one must obtain gold;
To refine silver, one must obtain silver.
Things transform through mutual dependence,
The false and true naturally require each other.
Do not fear the medicine is not sacred,
Only fear the medicine is not true.
If one understands the true and correct,
Comprehends the principles and meanings,
What worry is there that the medicine will not form?”

The scripture says: The myriad things flourish,
Each returning to its root.
Gold is born from earth,
The gate of the supremely subtle.
**Oral Instructions on the Weight of Ingredients**
Take eight ounces of *yellow sprout*, belonging to *Qian* (the Creative), hardness, yang, the tiger.
Take eight ounces of mercury, belonging to *Kun* (the Receptive), softness, yin, the dragon.
Thus it is said: *Qian* hardness, *Kun* softness, yin and yang, dragon and tiger.
Each ounce has four great parts; one catty has sixty-four parts. Each part has six *zhu*, corresponding to the number of lines in the hexagrams.
Water is one, fire is two, weight is three, medicine is four, earth is five—corresponding to the numbers of the Five Phases.
Begin firing from the *Fu* hexagram, to *Lin*, to *Tai*, to *Dazhuang*, to *Guai*, to *Qian*—this is the extreme of yang.
To *Gou*, to *Dun*, to *Pi*, to *Guan*, to *Bo*, to the end of *Kun*—this is the extreme of yin.
Counting twelve hexagrams, corresponding to the seasons of one year.
The medicine in the crucible is like the child in the womb; above is water, below is fire, following the order of yin and yang.
Water’s blackness descends, fire’s blackness ascends; the two blacks intermingle in harmony. Cold and heat do not err, and transformation occurs naturally.
Though sages and worthies may be present, they cannot fathom the changes within the furnace.
The twelve hexagrams, the firing process complete, the twenty-four blacks circulate fully.
Fire’s flavor is bitter, wood’s flavor is sour, water’s flavor is salty, metal’s flavor is acrid, earth’s flavor is sweet.
From the southern direction, circling the heavens, returning to the center.
The flavors of *wu* and *ji* (earth) are called *Returning Elixir*. *Dan* (elixir) means red.
The name *Returning Elixir* means returning to its original essence, hence called *Returning Elixir*.

**Oral Instructions on the Firing Process**
First month: half a catty, ten days.
Second month: one catty, increasing to twenty days.
Third month: one and a half catties, to thirty days.
Fourth month: two catties, increasing to forty days.
Fifth month: two and a half catties, increasing to the extreme of fifty days.
Sixth month: two catties, yin born, sixty days.
Seventh month: one and a half catties, seventy days.
Eighth month: one catty, eighty days.
Ninth month: half a catty, ninety days.
Tenth month: one hundred days of cold stabilization—then open the crucible to avoid losing essence.
Begin at *yin*, prosper at *wu*, rest in *xu*.
If observing the dawn, it is completed in one hundred days.
It is also said: One day has twelve hours; ninety days total one thousand eighty hours, corresponding to three full cycles.

**Oral Instructions on the Crucible and Ingredients for the Posterior Use of True Lead and True Mercury**
What crucible should be used for the crucible?
One must use the *earth dragon child*.
The true instructions do not permit using iron or porcelain as the crucible; one must use a *wu*-earth vessel.
The so-called *earth dragon child* is the yellow-earth crucible.
Like husband and wife in the bedchamber,
Naturally cherishing each other,
Overflowing and dying of themselves.

The *Father-Mother Womb Crucible* also takes the image of the Central Palace.
The medicinal ingredients—yin and yang essences—both return to *wu-ji* earth.
The essence of yin and yang is true mercury.
True lead is born within black lead, true mercury produced within cinnabar.
Moreover, these two substances transform through Heaven and Earth,
Drawing and circulating the qi of movement—
This is the essence of sun and moon,
Also called *Dragon and Tiger*,
Also called *Kan and Li*,
Also called yin and yang,
Also called husband and wife.
*Wu-ji* earth is the mother of the Five Phases;
Through the mother’s nurturing embrace, the Great Medicine is formed.
When ingested by humans, it grants longevity;
The five metals, earth, wood, tiles, and stones—
All are transmuted into treasure.
*Wu-ji* does not act alone but arises from yellow lead.
*Wu-ji* is the child of the earth dragon,
Yellow lead is the *Yellow Sprout*,
Its outer hue faintly yellow—
Hence the name *Yellow Sprout*, also called *Yellow Silver*.
Its powers are unfathomable,
Undergoing a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes,
Able to subdue cinnabar mercury,
Able to deaden the Eight Stones and the five metals—
It is the ancestor of the Great Elixir.
The *Supreme Unity Yin* is the son of the yin household,
The *Li Nine Yang* is the daughter of the yang household.
*Supreme Unity Yin* is the name of the moon,
*Li Nine Yang* is the name of the sun.
These two substances are the essence of sun and moon;
When the method of their union is obtained,
They are matched as husband and wife.
Their appearances perfectly correspond,
Yet they cannot unite on their own.
Both substances are white—
Thus it is said their appearances perfectly correspond.
They cannot unite on their own because the two substances do not naturally meet,
One in the east, one in the west.
They must be matched,
Brought together for a moment,
Fire and qi set in motion,
Placed within the earth crucible—
Then their affections grow intimate,
And the Supreme Medicine forms of itself.
The firing times need not be many,
Only as when a hen broods her eggs.
Use fire to warm and nurture,
Always as when a hen sits upon her eggs—
Too much will harm the qi and cause leakage.
The *Yellow Sprout* serves as a felt blanket,
Thick and warm, preventing light escape.
Mercury’s nature is inherently volatile and restless,
But when subdued by the *Yellow Sprout*,
Warmed by fire and nurtured,
It cannot flee—
Naturally, the Supreme Medicine forms and dies of itself.
The sage grasps the celestial mechanism,
Merely by recognizing the true Dragon and Tiger.
The sage penetrates the celestial mechanism,
His marvel lies in knowing the true Dragon.
The true Tiger, when warmed and nurtured, becomes the Elixir.
It saves the dying and prolongs life,
Rescues the orphaned and aids the imperiled.
When appearance has withered and aged,
It is reformed and moved to another vessel.
The *Yellow Sprout* subdues mercury,
Mercury gradually ages and dies,
Then is transferred and nurtured in a separate crucible—
Thus it is called *reforming and moving to another vessel*.
It is further transmitted as spirit,
Each phase restraining and subduing the next.
Therefore it is said: *reforming and moving to another vessel*.
If the three do not enter,
Mother and child return to the same place.
When mercury sees the *Yellow Sprout* die,
It will not enter the *Yellow Sprout*.
Transferred and nurtured separately,
Mother and child feign death together.
Mercury is the mother,
And the *Yellow Sprout* is temporarily placed with it—
Entering watery silver, it is consumed and dies,
Thus it is said: *mother and child return to the same place*.

An ancient song says:
The King of Huainan refined *Autumn Stone*,
The Yellow Emperor praised *Golden Flower*.
*Autumn Stone* is true lead,
*Golden Flower* lead is the *Yellow Sprout*—
These are not common lead,
But the essence drawn from within lead.
Mother and child dwell in one place,
As if in the home of immortals.
All the children grow to maturity,
Their complexions radiant and lustrous.
The mother, the *Yellow Sprout*, subdues mercury,
And the Supreme Medicine is formed—
Their hues grow ever more vivid,
Called *all the children grown to maturity, their complexions bright and lustrous*.

The *Supreme Unity Song* says:
When cloudy things resemble the *Yellow Sprout*,
Red chrysanthemums bear purple blossoms.
Ingesting it grants longevity and flight through clouds and mist,
Using it as wealth and treasure enriches your household.
Wash and refine with the *Flowery Pond*,
Removing impurities and dispelling vexation.
When the Supreme Medicine is formed,
It is further nurtured with the mercury mother—luminous cinnabar—
Then watery silver is added,
Flying above the cinnabar—
This is called *washing and refining with the Flowery Pond to remove impurities*.
This is the nourishment of the Five Phases in inverted sequence.
When the numbers of yin and yang are complete,
They unite in a single body to form *Golden Sand*.
When the Supreme Medicine ripens,
It is called *Golden Sand*.
Then it is transferred into the *Ninefold Yellow*,
Suddenly becoming the *River Chariot*.
The medicine ripens and is transferred into a golden vessel,
Nurtured for sixty days—
Three taels become the *Purple Radiance River Chariot*,
Able to transmute earth, wood, tiles, stones, lead, tin, copper, and iron,
All into *Purple Polishing Gold*.
The firing times are as before:
Metal governs four, earth governs five—
Within, the golden vessel is used; without, the earth crucible—
Thus it is called the *Ninefold Yellow*.
If you encounter this true formula,
Your karmic fortune is boundless.
To encounter this true formula,
One must have been destined for the immortal register in a past life.
Do not recklessly transmit it to the unworthy,
Lest calamities arise like hemp.
If transmitted indiscriminately,
The Three Officials will punish you.
Here ends the *Record of the Great Elixir*.
