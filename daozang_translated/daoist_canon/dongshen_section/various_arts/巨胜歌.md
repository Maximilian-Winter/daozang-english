**The Song of Great Victory**
By Liu Chongyong, Supreme Clarity Daoist of the Great Cavern, styled Xuanningzi

Master Tao [Hongjing]’s *Three Treatises* states: "To transmute mercury into golden elixir is the talk of fools; to claim cinnabar can prolong life is the folly of those ignorant of the Dao. Mercury does not occupy the proper position within the Five Phases, nor does cinnabar embody the union of Dragon and Tiger. To regard mercury as the essence of the Returned Elixir is as absurd as plowing stone to plant rice."

The *Master Embracing Simplicity* clings to the secrets of the Two Mountains and the origins of lead and mercury, expounding them with earnest clarity, yet the deluded persist in their ignorance until death. The *Scripture of the Primordial Origin* invokes the mutual conquest of the Five Phases, which become father and mother—this illuminates the Dao of Heaven and Earth. The *Scripture of the Golden and Azure* states that metal and earth are paired, as does the *Can Tong Qi*, offering irrefutable evidence and guidance free from obscurity.

Now, Dragon and Tiger are the axle and pivot of yin and yang, the hinge of creation. Though called Kan and Li, they are in truth Heaven and Earth. Through hardness subduing softness, from non-being entering being, the Five Phases follow their sequence, each attaining its proper place. In their pairing, east and west unite; once the singular qi divides, the Three Powers stand arrayed, the Six Lines unfold in succession, and the Four Images are fully manifested. Thus may cinnabar be refined—yet this Dao is profound and subtle, rarely fathomed by the world.

As the *Can Tong Qi* says:
*"Use metal as a dike to contain the waters, which then flow with ease.
Fifteen parts of metal, fifteen of water—
Weigh them precisely at the furnace, with water slightly in excess.
Three parts remain unabsorbed, two parts merge with it."*

These lines are the guiding principles of the Great Medicine, the pivot of metal and water. Yet people fail to grasp their meaning, instead pursuing cunning artifices, following their own whims, clinging to texts without a teacher, and thus never attaining the truth. How lamentable!

An ancient song declares:
*"Beneath the First Green, moon and sun,
Two halves ascend and merge as one."*

The world does not understand this principle. Some refine mercury with cinnabar, or extract mercury from cinnabar, subjecting it to countless cycles of heating and sublimation, reducing it to ash and smoke—how then can it return to its original state? Is this not folly?

The *Great Simplicity* states: *"Two maidens dwell together, yet their aspirations differ."* This refers to their positions. The north, Kan, is yin, which returns to become yang; the south, Li, is yang, which submits to become yin. Within the sun is the crow; within the moon, the toad. The crow is the essence of yin, wholly returning to yang—thus it is said, *"It gives birth to boys, not girls,"* which is self-evident.

All fruits arise from the tiniest beginnings, growing and ripening until they bear their essence. The tree knows not its own fruit—this is the work of nature. The *Diagram of the Great Simplicity* states: *"Wherever yin and yang exist, there arise people, beasts, grasses, and trees."* If mercury and cinnabar are said to originate in Ba and Shu, then in places where they do not appear, there should be no people, beasts, grasses, or trees. By this comparison, is this not foolish?

Mercury and cinnabar possess a natural origin, incomprehensible to ordinary minds, endlessly transforming in ways beyond human reason. The sages often borrow the names of metals and minerals to describe them. Kan (Water) presides over the seventy-two minerals—how could this be? A song says: *"Without the male, the female arises of itself"*—does this not convey the truth? If one uses mercury and cinnabar, they vanish at the first touch of fire—how can they be contained? Even if refined into a solid form, their essence is lost, devoid of the path of growth and return—how could they achieve immortality? Like mist scattering in wind and rain, or rivers flowing through a hundred channels, they stray from the Way.

The scriptures say: *"Master one, and ten thousand affairs are complete,"* and *"Having attained the One, do not cling to it."* In the profound and obscure, there is essence; in the indistinct and vague, there is substance. *"Mysterious and yet more mysterious"*—this is the foundation of embodying the Dao.

Each is one or two, interwoven with the Five Phases, the work of wu and ji. The beauty of lead is praised, yet its meaning is difficult to fathom. The *Can Tong Qi* says: *"Like the Milky Way’s stars, a hundred rivers flow to the sea"*—the world cannot comprehend this. The *Song of the Primordial Lord* declares:
*"Five internal measures, patterns hidden in vines,
Red salt and white snow form male and female—
The true return lies here, yet none perceive it."*

Thus, one need not seek cinnabar or mercury. Know that the myriad things arise from a single qi, and the Three Powers are nurtured by the myriad things.

Another song says: *"The loss of the One Black is like shards of tile."* This speaks of the affairs within the crucible, not external matters.

In my youth, I studied the Confucian and Mohist teachings; in maturity, I pursued the mysteries of the Dao. By chance, in seeking remedies for illness, I came near the path of longevity. Though I fulfilled my duties in the vermilion halls and briefly enjoyed the honor of the crimson sash, I abandoned these to devote myself to study and expound upon the Great Medicine. I delved into its essence and explored its profound subtleties. Having encountered an enlightened teacher, I received the transmission of its essential wonders—this is no falsehood. Thus, I composed *The Song of Great Victory* in ten stanzas, which sing of the marvels of lead, mercury, and the Five Phases. May later scholars use it to dispel their delusions.

**I.**
From whence do the Nine Cauldrons arise?
All from the One Black’s birth.
When silver and lead find their place,
Dragon and Tiger naturally merge.
Weigh them in scruples and grains,
Discern the River Chariot’s nature.
Follow the seasons in sequence,
And the Returned Elixir may be achieved.

**II.**
Tortoise and snake differ in form,
Yet lead and mercury share a common ancestor.
Though the two maidens dwell together,
A good matchmaker distinguishes mother and child.
Their union depends on the Three Flowers—
The Azure Dragon and White Tiger in verse.
Once the Four Images are established,
The Five Spirits find their master.

**III.**
Majestic and towering, yet lofty,
Drifting and turning, why glance aside?
The world merely refines elixirs,
Unknowing of the immortal’s path.

**IV.**
All stones belong to the Kan Palace,
Yet under borrowed names, none awaken.
Black and white unknown,
The passing years drift in vain.

**V.**
All speak of water, earth, and metal—
These three become the great medicine.
Borrowed qi gives rise in succession,
Rising and fusing in turn.
The Yellow Sprout is not lead,
Yet arises within lead itself.
Once gathered, it unites with the West,
While Wu and Ji are cast aside as husks.

**VI.**
Two eights form two households,
The mid-crescent counters the two eights.
Thus we know within Heaven and Earth,
Yin and yang govern the pivot.
The child is born of the mother,
The mother is slain by the child.
Nurture the essence of the infant,
Temper its warmth to guard against excess.
Each full moon takes form,
Yet withdrawal and replenishment must pause.
When Ren and Zi give birth to the mighty Yang,
Following the cycle, it perishes at Hai.
Should you know the time of transcendence,
Divine talismans and white snow await.

**VII.**
To refine the true and temper the form, hold fast to the One.
A single misstep, and the furnace is lost.
First use Ren and Zi to restrain the hooves,
Lest you cling instead to the Fusang sun.
Only when flavor yields to formlessness
Can you preserve the primal harmony of Heaven’s nature.
Seek no matchmaker elsewhere—
Husband and wife are ever paired.
From this, horse-teeth surpass langgan,
Waxing and waning, dark and bright—mark their swiftness or slowness.
Thus we know East and West define the round and square,
Yet mortals idly boast of wondrous arts.

**VIII.**
The Water Mother and Metal Father are not easily known,
Transforming into flowing pearls, their radiance shifts to ochre.
If borrowed qi reaches the White Snow Palace,
The Yellow Sprout from hence becomes hard to fathom.
Guard firmly against half-submerged perils,
Lest the grieving maiden’s lament linger in vain.

**IX.**
Ancient poems and songs make all plain,
Yet deluded men force their own interpretations.
The supreme Dao is not so very complex,
Yet they recklessly entwine cinnabar and mercury.
Unknowing of crimson blood and azure waist,
All day they labor within lead.
What lies within lead is not easily cultivated—
Lose it, and the primal qi severs without end.

**X.**
The Yellow Sprout is not lead,
The two substances birth the cinnabar field.
Should you seek the mighty Yang’s method,
Lead and mercury must arise naturally.
None of this exists in the world’s domain,
Nor does it distinguish fool from sage.
Sun’s essence and moon’s radiance—
Those who recognize them are all immortals.

**XI.**
The Daoist of Great Origin was once a divine immortal,
Who shifted his name to the Central Metropolis to study spontaneity.
Worldly men refine elixirs, deluded by metal and water,
Burning through the Yellow Sprout yet failing to know lead.
In Western Shu, men vie to gather mercury,
Yet with fire, it vanishes in an instant as smoke.
If you can grasp the One without clinging to it,
The wondrous method is profound, ever more profound.
