### **Method for Ingesting Cinnabar**
Take one *jin* of cinnabar and grind it finely without pounding. Mix it thoroughly with three *sheng* of pure bitter wine, then simmer over a gentle flame until it can be formed into pills the size of hemp seeds. Take twice daily. After forty days, the hundred diseases of the abdomen will be entirely cured, and the Three Corpses will be expelled. After one hundred days of ingestion, the skin and flesh will become firm and strong. After one thousand days, the Director of Destinies will remove one’s name from the register of death, ensuring preservation alongside Heaven and Earth, gazing upon the sun and moon as equals. One’s form and countenance will be transformed.

By ingesting and refining cinnabar, one may sink into the depths or ascend in transformation, attaining long life and enduring vision. White hair will darken anew, and fallen teeth will regrow. One may peer eastward from a wall and see what lies to the west, or gaze into the Yellow Springs below.

**Formula:** Take three *jin* of cinnabar and grind it finely with swift, heavy strokes of silk. Place it in a copper vessel or basin, then soak it in nine *sheng* of pure bitter wine until it becomes a paste. Set it in a high place to dry. Repeat the soaking as before, using three *sheng* of bitter wine for each *jin* of cinnabar. Continuously dry it, and after thirty days, it will turn purple. When it no longer soils the hands and can be drawn out like malt sugar, it may be formed into pills the size of hemp seeds. Take three pills daily, swallowing them at dawn.

Before ingesting the medicine, observe thirty days of purification and abstinence, bathing in the Five Fragrances. On the first day of ingestion, the Three Worms will descend. After six days, accumulations and ailments beneath the heart, as well as all abdominal afflictions, will be expelled. After sixty days, visions will appear. After one year, white hair will darken, and fallen teeth will regrow. After two years, one’s complexion will resemble that of a fifteen-year-old. A divine being will present a purple tray bearing food, upon which grows purple lingzhi. When asked, one may eat the lingzhi without fear or alarm, remaining composed and at ease. All things will come of their own accord. Even the hundred ghosts may be summoned.

The first spirit is named *Shang*, the second *Qing*, and the third *Qing*. By calling the names of the myriad things, one may command them: entering water, they become waves; entering metal, they become molten liquid. One may see ten thousand *li* away, perceiving the Five Viscera with clarity. Thus may one become a Perfected, known to all spirits. One may come and go without hindrance, and the Dao will be established and attained. When ingesting the medicine, merely reduce the consumption of wine.

Even an eighty-year-old woman who takes it may bear children. Both men and women may ingest it.

Take it regularly with well-flower water. When preparing the medicine, one must fast and purify oneself. Begin by making the "medicine mother" before the Summer Solstice, then prepare the ingestible medicine after the Summer Solstice. Avoid raw fish, wine, dog meat, raw vegetables, the five pungent herbs, and rich or greasy foods. If transmitted to an unworthy person, misfortune will befall their descendants. Only when the right person is found should the medicine be made for them—only then will it enable one to command others.

Another method: Grind one *jin* of cinnabar into powder, then pound it. Add two *sheng* of pure lacquer and three *sheng* of strong bitter wine. Combine these three ingredients thoroughly, then simmer over a low flame until the mixture can be formed into pills the size of sesame seeds. Take three times daily.

When compounding the medicine:
- In the first month, avoid the *hai* day;
- In the second month, avoid the *yin* day;
- In the third month, avoid the *si* day;
- In the fourth month, avoid the *shen* day;
- In the fifth and ninth months, return to avoiding the *hai* day.

One should select days of "wang" (prosperity) and "xiang" (mutual generation) and avoid the *wei* day. Also avoid days of self-punishment and the four seasons:
- In spring, avoid *wu-chen* and *ji-si*;
- In summer, avoid *wu-shen* and *ji-you*;
- In autumn, avoid *wu-xu* and *ji-hai*;
- In winter, avoid *wu-yin* and *ji-mao*.

Do not compound or take the medicine on these days. All medicine preparation should be done on auspicious days following celestial timing.

**The Rite of Offering to the Great One (Taiyi)**
For those who consume cinnabar, the eight minerals, mica, or pills and powders made from the hundred herbs—seeking to nurture life, pursue the Dao of immortality, and attain transcendence—must first offer sacrifice to the Lord of the Great One. Without this offering, the medicine will not succeed; even if it does, taking it will bring no benefit. It will not enable one to attain immortality, prolong life, or achieve longevity and deathlessness.

Thus, when offering to the Great One, the deity descends to oversee, sometimes sending Jade Maidens. With the divine qi bestowed, the medicine will be efficacious upon consumption. One must fast and purify oneself. When forming pills, declare oneself a servant; when preparing the medicine, offer sacrifice before igniting the flame; when making powders, offer sacrifice only after completion. First, arrange all herbs before the seat of the Great One, then perform the offering.

For the offering to the Great One, use a table; if none is available, a tray will suffice. Face south, and present five cups of wine, five strips of dried meat, and two plates of dates. The amount of wine may vary as one wishes, but the heart must be sincere and the intent whole—only then will the divine spirits descend.

For a grand offering, use five *dou* of wine, five *jin* of dried meat, two *sheng* of dates, or dried venison. Only use vessels free of dust. Once arranged, burn incense. The host kneels and bows, reverently inviting:
- The Nine Heavens’ Two Perfected Ones,
- The Supreme Emperor of the Highest Sovereign,
- The Nine Heavens’ Three Venerable Lords,
- The Supreme Perfected One,
- The Supreme Jade Maiden,
- The Nine Elders of the Immortals’ Capital,
- The King of Grand Clarity,
- The Heavenly Perfected Lord of the Great One,
- The Earthly Perfected Lord of the Great One,
- The Jade Youth of the Great One,
- The Jade Maiden of the Great One,
- The Yellow and Purple Canopies,
- The Bright Immortal Second Lord,
- The Flame-Covered Firelight Messenger,

to descend to the seat. The host kneels, bows, and kowtows, declaring:
*"Today, I humbly beseech for so-and-so (one’s name) to be absolved of the myriad sins and transgressions accumulated over seven generations, down to my own person. May disasters be averted and calamities shifted, all misfortunes dissolved, and longevity and enduring vision granted. Now, as I prepare this medicine of various ingredients, I offer it to the Supreme Lord of the Great One. May the Lord of the Great One oversee its consumption beneath the Yellow Palace and Purple Canopy. May the medicine be without flaw or excess, without scattering or dispersing, harmonizing divine qi and aligning with the radiant essence of the Yellow Flower. I reverently present this to the celestial spirits, that the divine medicine may shine brightly. As the enlightened master ignites the flame, may the Jade Maiden attend beside. By the division of Heaven’s qi, may the Great One descend."*

The host, so-and-so, kneels and bows, then offers three libations. Upon completion, the host sends off the spirits, presenting a final cup of wine with earnest devotion. Though the offering is modest, the deities have deigned to attend. May all above and below rejoice, satiated and content. The host and the hundred spirits now turn their chariots to depart. May the descendant so-and-so be shielded and protected, blessed by Heaven and aided by the spirits. May disasters be dispelled, sins absolved, all as spoken. May wealth, honor, and longevity be bestowed, and blessings endure. All who receive this bow in gratitude, and all prayers be fulfilled.

**The Rite of Invoking the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior with Talismans**
Invoke the Lord of the Great Dao and the Great One, the Direct Talisman Messenger, the Talisman-Attending Jade Maiden, and the Perfected Lord within the Dipper. On this *jiazi* day coinciding with Pure Brightness, the male so-and-so (one’s name) receives the talismans for transcending the nine calamities and other protections. Beneath the stellar lodges, with clear wine, dates, dried meat, and fragrant offerings, descend to the seat. May so-and-so, upon wearing these talismans, repel all misfortunes, the five weapons, and the hundred insects, preventing harm. May official disasters be dispelled, all malevolent spirits vanish, and no suffering befall. May fierce beasts and wolves keep their distance, halting at the sight of the talisman and daring not rise. So-and-so kneels and bows.

The *Jujube-Cake Rite*

To perform this in a pure, secluded chamber, avoid exposure to the open air. With the Plain Girl, pace in tandem, each taking three steps and nine footprints. The disciple stands at *wu* (south), the master at *zi* (north), each knocking teeth three times. The disciple moves to the right, the master to the left, then both return to their original positions. The Plain Girl remains in place; the master at *zi* moves to *wu*, while the jujube-cake is placed at the center. Clasping hands, they three times receive the Upper Prime’s *qi*.

The master intones:
*"Radiant jujube-cake,
Taiyi’s surplus grain.
Steamed nine times in nine days,
consumed to refine the golden wheel.
The jujube-cake unfolds,
jade-moist with golden nectar.
Ascend as immortals, transcend the world,
your rank equal to the Perfected Kings."*

The Plain Girl exhales and says:
*"Jujube-cake, jujube-cake,
the Dao of Heaven responds.
I tread the dark net,
immortals come to serve.
Consume it to ascend,
your rank equal to Anqi."*

**Method for Steaming Sesame with the Plain Girl**

To brighten the eyes and brows, purify the breath, beautify lips and teeth, and adorn one’s garments, bathe in orchid-scented water. Do not allow pregnant women, those with baleful eyes, or those harboring malice to touch it—if they do, the medicine will fail, and consumption will be in vain.

Perform three *qi*-cycles, circulating and swallowing five times; then seven *qi*-cycles, swallowing seven times; then nine *qi*-cycles, swallowing nine times. Thereafter, nine *qi*-cycles with nine swallows each, continuing until the *qi* flows unimpeded. This aligns with the method for harmonizing the *qi* of celestial dew and yang essence.

Master Li transmitted this orally; it was not recorded on paper, lest the celestial patterns be divulged. Guard this secret—do not recklessly teach those unworthy, or calamity will befall you, and the Dao of immortality will remain unattainable.
