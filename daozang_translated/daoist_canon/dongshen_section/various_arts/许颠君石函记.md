**Preface to *The Stone Casket Record of Perfected Lord Xu***
The Perfected Lord’s surname was Xu, his given name Xun, and his courtesy name Jingzhi. A native of Runan, his ancestors for generations revered the supreme Dao. In the first year of Taikang of Emperor Wu of the Western Jin (280 CE), he was recommended as a *xiaolian* (filial and incorrupt), but declined the post. The imperial court then extended a formal summons with honors, and the Perfected Lord, unable to refuse, accepted the position of magistrate of Jingyang County in Shu Commandery. Due to the chaos of the age, he resigned his office to enter the Dao, dedicating himself to cultivation. Following the teachings of the Perfected King of Illuminated Filial Dao and the lineage of transcendents who ascend through flight, his merits and conduct were perfected. He captured and slew serpents and miasmic creatures, healed the sick with incantations and talismanic waters, and restored the dead to life—countless were his deeds.

Later, in the second year of Ningkang of Emperor Xiaowu of the Eastern Jin (374 CE), on the first day of the eighth month (jiaxu), at West Mountain in Hongzhou, he received a jade edict from the August Emperor. Together with his household of forty-two souls and all their possessions, he ascended bodily into the heavens, leaving behind a stone casket. He declared: "As the world changes and the times shift, let this serve as a record for the age." Later, Zhang Shou opened the casket and discovered nine secret texts within—these were the Perfected Lord’s supreme methods for refining the golden elixir, titled *The Stone Casket Record*.

Xie Guanfu, the Jade Eminence of West Mountain’s Yulong, along with his eminent disciple, the Transcendent-Clad-in-Void Zhu Mingshu, and Zheng Daoquan of Dongjia, transmitted these teachings in succession, passing them down to the present day. This text embodies the mechanism of highest-grade ascent, not some minor path of peripheral elixir arts. Only those with the bones of immortals, who encounter this writing, should treasure and conceal it—do not show it to the unworthy. The vows within these pages are weighty; read with utmost caution!

**The Stone Casket Record of Perfected Lord Xu, Fascicle One**
*On the Primordial Essence of the Great Yang*

The Great Dao of the Mysterious Origin is without image or form, yet responsive to nature, manifesting in movement and stillness. Movement is the primordial Yang; primordial Yang is primordial essence, and primordial essence gives birth to true fire. This fire arises in the depths of the Mysterious-Mysterious, separating and uniting to form the hun-soul—thus begins the division of the sun. Its radiance emerges from Fusang, the nine qi congealing into luminous clarity, its ascending light suffusing all beneath heaven. This is the brilliance of Yang illumination, the crimson *li* penetrating the landscape.

Its crystalline splendor shines forth, welling up with dragon-light, coalescing into golden mist. Jade qi and pearlescent hues, auspicious vapors and propitious radiance fill the void. Clouds veil the nine heavens: the sagely conceal their cloud-light, the worthy conceal their cloud-light; gold conceals its cloud-light, jade conceals its cloud-light, pearls conceal their cloud-light, fragrance conceals its cloud-light, blossoms conceal their cloud-light, water conceals its cloud-light, fire conceals its cloud-light. They emit manifold rays, illuminating heaven and earth, scattering mist and trailing hues, dispersing qi to engender the myriad beings.

The myriad beings begin with the One; the One gives rise to the Two, the Two to the Three, and the Three to the ten thousand things. Both land and water teem with life, beyond all reckoning. Even in the dark yin of filth and muck, within the hardest and most stubborn stones, among mountain crags and grasses, wherever earth takes form—whether creatures fleet of foot or swift of wing, whether fierce demons or malevolent spirits—none is untouched, none is unpervaded.

Among those that fly are birds that hunt spirits and chase monsters; among those that run are beasts so fierce that ten men cannot withstand them. The largest include camels, oxen, elephants, and horses; the smallest, mustard seeds and tiny insects. Whether rotting and decaying, born from wombs or eggs, moist or dry, all that bears spirit and stirs with life arises from this, proceeds from this. Each receives its nature and assumes its form, its substance shaped by its aspect, its color determined by its place. What is red becomes red, what is black becomes black, what is blue becomes blue, what is white becomes white, what is yellow becomes yellow—such are the transformations of the Five Phases, responsive to their positions, not artificially dyed!

As for those that bear transformation and nurture hues: "Bearing transformation" refers to stones that, sensing qi, transform and give birth to life; "nurturing hues" refers to colors ranging from pale white and light yellow to faint red and delicate green, from deep blue and dark black to exotic greens and rare reds, wondrous tints and peerless shades—each attains its own beauty. All are the workings of spirit and the transformations of qi, forming natural essences. Beings receive qi in varying depths, so their colors and appearances are not fixed. They follow the Great Dao, self-transforming—thus it is said: "form without form," "transformation without transformation." This is what is meant by the Dao.

As the saying goes: in heaven, it hangs as celestial images; on earth, it takes form; in stone, it becomes treasure. When essence gathers, it becomes a jewel, and jewels are radiance. How marvelous! Such is the Great Dao—who can condense the golden blossom?

When fire flourishes, it melts metal; when metal is felled, wood flourishes. Wood’s flourishing is the outward display of Yang, its branches spreading, while within it harbors Yin, its blossoms unfolding. The Perfected Lord of Yin says: "The golden blossom is born—the treasure of heaven and earth. Those who grasp this speak the true and ultimate Dao."

In but a moment, the Dipper turns, celestial images wax and wane. When full, wood thrives and grows deep green; when waning, its blossoms are felled and wither. Why? Because what is first formed by the mutual conquest of Yin and Yang is the culmination of the Dao. When conquered, blossoms scatter and fall like drifting rouge and powder—this is the hun-soul leaping and toying with spirit, the light red flying with the soul’s numen.

Red varies in depth, powder in weight. Where color is deep and essence light, it flies upward in flames, like purple frost beneath a dark canopy, congealing in the crucible as earthly yellow-gold powder. Where color is pale and essence heavy, nurtured, it transforms into golden yellow—this is the fire-nurtured *jiaoshao*, the cinnabar Yang’s bone-transformation.

The hun-soul follows where the po-soul abides; the po-soul follows where the hun-soul arises. The hun-soul shines with purple blossoms; the po-soul gathers Yang. Gathering Yang, the hun-qi enters the po-soul’s belly, concealing the hun within the po’s abdomen. The qi of sun and moon unite; the dragon exhales, the tiger displays its hues; the tiger inhales the dragon’s light. The two qi swallow and merge, enveloping the four directions, harmonizing the four images, their qi converging at the center.

Thus, with the first transformation, qi becomes water; with the second, water becomes cinnabar; with the third, cinnabar becomes mercury; with the fourth, mercury becomes gold; with the fifth, gold becomes the elixir. This elixir gathers the numinous essence of heaven and earth, seizes the radiance of sun and moon, captures the water and fire of Kan and Li, pursues the earth’s po-soul, and unites with the heaven’s hun-soul. Dragon and tiger become cinnabar; the flying bird and running hare become blossoms. Harmonizing their light, they enter the chamber together—only the noble house of the Nine and Five is revered. Whether the medicine is right or wrong in principle, the white tiger and green dragon yield their marrow. From the root and stem sprouts the yellow sprout; gold and silver fill my house.

If used to save human lives, human lives shall enjoy eternal blossoming. Those who ingest it may soar through the skies and traverse the waters, riding dragons and cranes. There is no other reason—all is the transformation of the Dao.

The transmutation of the medicine arises when fire attains its numinous function, and the medicine gains spiritual penetration. The Dao harmonizes with nature, and the work achieves its marvel! Someone may ask: in harmonizing the tripod and furnace, one inhales the fat and marrow of the Nine Dragons and the Red Sun—what is the meaning of this? The answer is: lead is the sacred vessel, and vessel and spirit interpenetrate. The vessel is transformed by the spirit, and spirit and vessel unite as one body. Naturally, breath and response correspond—then the spirit follows the inhalation to arrive, radiance pursues the spirit’s brilliance, rosy clouds descend like jade, and crimson drops swiftly fall. The numinous essence ascends and descends, gathered into the Water Palace and Dragon Court, where it is nurtured into purple longevity.

The true qi of the golden embryo transforms into golden liquid, subtly following creation’s course, and mercury naturally arises. Through the twelve hours, it circulates through *wu* and *ji*, fire divides into the four cardinal directions—thus the two solstices and two equinoxes. The two solstices are *zi*, *wu*, and *chen*; when discussed, they encompass a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, entering and exiting the void, opening the gate of all wonders, and revealing the primordial medicine of ascension. If one obtains and cultivates it, how could one not achieve longevity, ascend through the clouds, and fly to pay court to the Jade Emperor as a spirit of pure, numinous subtlety? How could this be sought with ease!

This Dao is truly secret; few alchemists hear of it, and so they drift through the cycles of life and death, far from the Way of immortality. Now, the radiance of the dragon is the essence within fire, clarity emerging from the essence, light arising from clarity, and flame born from light. The fiery flame communicates with the numinous, and its radiance blazes brilliantly. Within it lies golden azure, hollow azure’s round light, vast and boundless, shimmering without end. The radiance of Yu Yi shines forth, the Great Yang’s southern brightness, the Great Yin’s northern darkness—south and north unite, the two spirits meet, male and female harmonize, water and fire aid each other. Water gains fire and generates radiance.

Now, the Great Abyss of Mysterious Splendor is pure blackness, its form hidden and its luster submerged—how could it manifest the mysterious splendor of the black moon? Only by embracing the qi of yang can it generate brightness. As yang accumulates and yin transforms, the years and months take shape. Yang resides in their number, ceaselessly advancing and retreating, thus giving rise to the waxing and waning of fullness and deficiency, ever between the dark and new moons. Darkness arises at the dark moon, brightness at the new moon. Thus, on the third day, yang is born, stirring in the east. The radiance of the Great Yang’s Yu Yi coalesces into brilliance, dwelling in the western position, likened to the formation of splendor. Befriending east and west, the Dao lies in gaining and losing companions—this is called the union of Yu Yi and splendor.

Great indeed is the radiance of the Great Yang’s Yu Yi! Its luminosity illumines the four corners, returning its light to the center—this is called the Five Virtues. The Five Virtues are the five planets, their light dividing into myriad forms, each gaining subtle brightness. They illuminate the moonlit night, hiding their brilliance at dawn, exchanging radiance between day and night—this is the union of Qian and Kun. The moon contains its light, which is the essence of the sun—this is called the exchange of radiance. Dawn emerges in the east, dusk sets in the west—thus it is called the union of rest.

If the great elixir does not rely on the exchange of radiance between sun and moon, the union of Qian and Kun, what else could serve as its foundation? It is not the cinnabar and mercury of the human world, nor the five metals and eight minerals—it is the wondrous subtlety of the Great Yang’s mysterious origin. When the flying soul soars and transforms, it becomes the most refined and numinous; when it responds and communicates, it becomes the most divine and sagely. Without the shimmering radiance of Yu Yi, what else could achieve this?

Yet the sun and moon circulate above, advancing and retreating, completing the year’s work below. The sun comes and the moon goes, moving south and then north, north and then south—thus the Dao of life and death arises. Death refers to the time after the summer solstice, when the sun reaches the southern limit, yin qi flourishes, and yang qi gradually wanes. The Dao reaches its end and returns to Kun’s origin—this is why the myriad things die, culminating in *hai*. Life refers to the time after the winter solstice, when the sun reaches the northern limit, yang qi gradually grows, and it returns to Qian’s origin, penetrating and achieving benefit and integrity—this is why the myriad things live, culminating in *si*. The sun’s movement between south and north gives rise to the Dao of life and death.

Moreover, the two solstices of winter and summer and the two equinoxes of spring and autumn are the four cardinal directions of heaven and earth. Spring gives birth, summer grows, autumn kills, and winter stores—this is following the yin and yang of heaven and earth to generate the myriad things. Such is the wondrous function of the great returning elixir, which forms a single body.

This is called modeling heaven and imaging earth, casting the tripod and sealing the furnace. One must choose an auspicious land on a famous mountain to establish the altar and hall. The mountain should be extraordinary and elegant, the land prized for facing the sun. With the tiger’s posture and dragon’s peak, facing mountains and flowing waters, it should often harbor rare birds and strange beasts, conceal treasures and jewels, be far from graves, and have few human traces—naturally attracting fortune and welcoming auspiciousness. Only when born of worthiness and nobility can it serve as a place for refining the elixir.

The sage embodies heaven’s Dao and models earth’s generation, grasping the sun and seizing the moon, enveloping Qian and Kun. To obtain the essence of the crow, one must first seek the marrow of the hare—this is the symbolic taking of Fu Xi. First civil, then martial, proceeding in accordance with the Dao of the *Yi*! The withdrawal and addition of water and fire depend on numinous skill; wondrous function arises naturally, and yang is born within the golden chamber.

Now, the birth of yang is *fu*; at the *zi* hour, it stirs, and the Yellow Bell responds to the pitch. Yang qi circulates, gradually passing through *lin* and *tai*, until at *si*, Qian’s hardness is exhausted and Kun’s softness arrives. Yin is born at *gou*; at *wu*, it gradually passes through *pi* and *bo*, until Kun’s *hai* nears its end. As the years and months shift, the elixir’s Dao nears completion. The child emerges from the mother’s womb, shedding its fetal form and transforming spiritually.

*Gou* at *wu* is the fire of *Li* giving birth to mercury; *fu* at *zi* is the water of *Kan* giving birth to lead. Mercury congeals because of lead, and lead is subdued because of mercury—this is the longing of mother and child forming the elixir. From the union with nature arises the most refined and wondrous, which cannot be left unconsidered. The key lies in carefully seeking the true oral instructions, awakening to the mysterious penetration, and distinguishing falsehood from truth—only then can it be seen.

Having grasped the celestial image of the sun and moon suspended in brilliance, the mechanism of myriad transformations, the boundless and inexhaustible flux of generation—those who attain this, how could their longevity not equal heaven and earth? How then could one lightly discuss it with the unworthy!

Thus, I have set forth these brief discourses on the Dao, not as a complete treatise, but to distill the essence of these words into a secret register of cinnabar, akin to oral instructions. Hear my admonition: to recklessly transmit this to the unworthy invites swift calamity. Beware! Beware!

**On the Sun and Moon as Female and Male**

The Southern Florescence reaches its utmost; the golden palace and divine chamber are vast and luminous, enduring through infinite kalpas. The wheel of Mount Sumeru turns without distinction of dawn or dusk; rosy clouds scatter, illuminating both darkness and light. Cycling through ninety myriad millions, it moves with unceasing vigor, spreading qi to enliven all beings. The solar essence is the celestial treasure; dragon radiance shines forth, fiery clouds blaze, and flames flicker with numinous power.

Through numinous penetration, one attains sageliness—suddenly, the soul soars, luminous and crystalline, suffusing the body with light. The light, ninety thousand leagues in circumference, encircles the golden city. Within the yang cavern, amid the verdant forest of empty azure, the divine dragon transforms; at its heart dwells the golden spirit. The adamantine traces are veiled in dense purple haze; from the purple longevity and purple spirit, radiant clouds arise. Purple longevity gives birth to purple essence, and radiant clouds yield purple numen, emerging in response to the hidden true purple.

The azure yang and purple pole are supremely true and numinous, perpetuating generation in unbroken succession. The Primordial Beginning and Primordial Crystal—crystal is the unique essence of numinous penetration, while the Primordial Beginning is the origin of all treasures. It transmits the ancestor of the ten thousand qi, the qi that harbors the origin of all things. Qi itself is formless; spirit moves and qi transforms. Above, it weaves through the heavens; below, it interlaces the earth. Their paths intersect like measured degrees, their conjunctions like a shuttle, moving back and forth—southward, then returning north.

The sun’s path runs south, and the forms of the ten thousand things wane. When its course reaches its limit, the sun turns back to the northern realm, and the ten thousand things respond in concealment. All arise from the black and red paths, intersecting the yellow path as they traverse south and north.

One who can observe the Dao of heaven and grasp the movements of heaven may summon and gather dragon crystal and tiger essence, feeding on rosy clouds. This requires the craft of the mysterious gate and the skill to refine the golden crucible. In harmonizing, one steals from the void of yin and yang, naturally forming substance. What exists in the void? What image follows its generation?

In the hidden yin, lead virtue is concealed within; when fire stirs, external yang dances in the emptiness. The radiance of victory spans eighty thousand leagues, descending upon the divine chamber. Endless flowing clouds linger, their light penetrating deeply into the courtyard of utmost emptiness. They replenish the eastern river, enter the Hall of Light, and the true virtue’s precious splendor fills the five hues.

Clouds arise and transform into verdant earth; fire stirs and changes into blazing red lotuses. When grim yin prevails, true lead sinks into darkness; when expansive yang appears, true mercury floats in whiteness. When purity reveals the treasure, yellow gold may be wrought. As the soul stabilizes and the spirit congeals, fresh rosy clouds emerge in fragments. Horse teeth turn frosty, and mercury becomes powder. It can revive the dead, restoring their wandering souls to wakefulness.

Its efficacy is unfathomable—even ghosts and spirits cannot fathom its mysteries. The fire numbers are obscure; even the sagest cannot know its applications. The wondrous transformations of the mysterious origin seem both present and absent. When present, true lead bears form; when absent, fire arises from the void.

The fire of *Li* transforms emptily, and flowers transmute into fire. The transmutation of flowers relies entirely on the fire’s work. Who can employ fire that arises from nothing? When cinnabar is achieved, fire dissolves into nothingness. Within it, fire follows the changes of the lines, yet fire itself is unborn.

The qi of *bing* and *xin* transforms into true water, nourishing the true gold of *yi* and *geng*. The qi of *ding* and *ren* transforms into true wood. It can nourish the true fire of *wu* and *gui*. The qi of *jia* and *ji* transforms into true earth. Earth, the mother of the ten thousand things, is the cinnabar’s parent. Father and mother transmit the embryo, arraying the nine names.

The first year of the nine paths is the great ancestor. Sons and grandsons follow their fathers in succession. The *Qian* Dao produces the male; the *Kun* Dao, the female. The azure path’s qi emerges east of the yellow path. Suddenly, thunder roars, ascending to the azure sky. The thunder of *Zhen* in the east at *mao*—four yang signs respond to the season. Elm flowers wither, leaves scatter in disarray. The Dipper turns, its handle pointing to *mao*.

The white path’s qi emerges west of the yellow path. Luxuriant golden flowers give birth to the golden rooster. Metal is born in the west, flourishing in *dui* at *you*. How could shepherd’s purse and wheat not wither? Four yin winds blow across the earth at *guan*, the setting sun. The Dipper turns, its handle pointing to *you*.

The red path’s qi emerges south of the yellow path. Flickering and blazing, it burns eternally. True yang fire flourishes in *Li* at *wu*; from *si* to *wu* to *ding*, the first yin arises. Heavenly winds stir, and fire glitters. At its zenith, decline begins—decay resides in *wu*.

The black path’s qi emerges north of the yellow path. The divine pool’s water is profoundly dark. Within the darkness, a yang gradually grows. The *Fu* hexagram, by this, reveals its sprouting signs. The *Huangzhong* tone establishes *zi*, gradually unfolding principle. Heaven and earth’s warp and weft renew their beginning.

The sun moves along the yellow path within its course; the moon traverses the nine paths as the Great Unity. The nine paths and nine crucibles reach the divine chamber—of old, the Yellow Emperor once mastered them. The Yellow Emperor rode a dragon to ascend the Purple Tenuity, his seventy-two ministers all feathered transcendents. Ascending the cloudy heavens, treading the void, they flew into the golden city of the cinnabar clouds. From then on, they reclined and rose as true immortals.

Once, he encountered a divine lord who bestowed the great elixir. Following the phoenix’s carriage, they journeyed through Mount Emei. Not in vain did they endure toil and hardship: thatched huts untrimmed, paths impassable, thorns piercing the sky, obscuring distant mountains. The peaks of Emei were perilous to climb.

He entreated the august personage to return at dusk. He rejected heterodox gates and minor arts: no mere swallowing of saliva to form golden liquid, no refining of urine into autumn stone, no claims of fasting or abstaining from grain, no methods of shoulder-shaking or breath-counting, no closing of eyes to manipulate essence and spirit, no clenching of fists to seize demonic thieves, no reliance on yin shadows to nourish numinous things, no practices of the Three Peaks or sexual rites.

When the art is perfected and the Dao is achieved, one ascends the highest mechanism of immortality. Yet worldly scholars cannot adhere to it. Telling it to the vulgar, they disbelieve—let them read the *Annals of Master Jingyang* to understand.

**On the Mother of Medicines**

The Dao of the Elixir is not the work of mundane five metals or eight minerals, nor cinnabar or mercury. It is formless union with the void, vast completion of emptiness—this is called true emptiness. The substance of true emptiness is the foundation of the Returned Elixir, the mother of the Great Medicine.

What is the form of the mother of the Great Medicine? What is the appearance of her body, and from what essence does she arise? The essence is a thing formed within primordial chaos, a thing that dwells before the image of the Emperor. The image precedes true emptiness, which merges with the natural. True emptiness and the natural unite with form and image; the movement of spirit turns the image, and the turning of true emptiness is not empty. The marvel of non-emptiness is the power of spirit. The spirit communicates, transforms, and assumes a black color. Black is the profound origin where virtue and power are concealed. The Dao conceals profound virtue in a vast abyss—its broad and fathomless source is called the Northern Ocean.

The Northern Ocean is vast and great, giving birth to the boundless. Boundless and without limit is the Dao. The limitless Dao gives birth to the One. The One attains the highest clarity, first in heaven. Being first in heaven, it is the primordial beginning, six million years of Dao-generated completion. Completion perfects the Dao, the green ancestor of the lineage, which can generate all images and thus is the mother of the Elixir.

Mother lead is black—why is mother lead black? When it achieves the water of the six origins and resides in the north, it aligns with the stars. It governs transformation and nurtures life below. The essence of lead contains five colors, which transform into green, yellow, white, red, and black. Black is the profound origin, the foundation of water. Water is the pivot of the Dao, and its number is One. The One is the true qi of the Center within Kan, harmonizing with the indistinct and the obscure. They mutually require each other, joining like dragon and tiger. At the inception of dragon and tiger, what was there? Yin and yang stir and excite each other; the formless unites with the void. The void arises from being, and being arises from non-being.

Non-being is the beginning of non-action; being is the mother of action. It is the first of the four images, the origin of the five phases, and the pivot of cinnabar. The pivot is the intercourse of the two qi of water and fire. Water and fire refine each other; yin and yang overcome each other. How is this made clear? Briefly test it: the sun and moon within the crucible are the qi of water and fire. The qi of water moistens downward, and the qi of fire flames upward. Descending and ascending, they meet and welcome each other, joining and uniting. Water excites fire and extinguishes it; extinguished fire becomes earth. Earth can generate metal, and metal can generate water. Metal and water generate each other, mutually containing and nurturing. They nourish metal and augment water, augmenting water to nourish metal. When metal and water correspond, they moisten and enrich the flesh. The flesh becomes like jade cream, pure and true as white jade blossoms. It extends longevity beyond price, a priceless true pearl, the cinnabar-formed body.

What was there before? Formless being arises from being; water and fire nourish each other. The two qi mutually require each other; the formless unites with the void. The substance of united void has the function of one *jin* in number. The number divides into two weights, covering and revealing two circles. Before their union, first determine above and below. The number of the upper arc is eight, and the number of the lower arc is also eight. Combining the two eights above and below yields the substance of Qian and Kun. The substance of Qian and Kun is one *jin*; the Dao of the Elixir is thus upright and unwavering.

Firmness and softness have outer and inner aspects; metal and water divide into balanced weights. Yin and yang have lightness and heaviness. They dance and mutually employ each other, unfolding the three powers. Qian and Kun unite in substance! The Qian trigram images heaven and covers; its three lines are connected. The Kun trigram images earth and reveals; its six lines are broken yet interconnected. The qi flows through the six breaks, and the three connections open. The Qian trigram undergoes three changes, and the Kun trigram undergoes three changes. Qian connects, Kun breaks; breaking and connecting alternate, opening and closing. Black and white come and go.

Great indeed are black and white! Yang is the seed, yin the planting. Cultivating and nurturing the seed yields the yellow sprout. The yellow sprout generates mercury; mercury emits three blossoms. Mercury coagulates into cinnabar, like grains of gold. One grain taken daily for a hundred days transforms the form and changes the bones. The bones become like metal and stone; form and spirit attain each other. Form and spirit are both wondrous, and longevity knows no limit. The sacred virtue of golden cinnabar arises from formless being, and being arises from non-being. The trigrams and lines correspond, harmonizing with the intercourse of Zhen, Dui, Kan, and Li. The four images are emptiness and formlessness, impossible to depict. The primordial essence is difficult to perceive; the formless unites with the void.

The form of the formless is the transformation of emptiness. The transformation of cinnabar is natural; cinnabar transforms and arises from the natural—this is the wondrous function. The wondrous is the maiden; the maiden belongs to the Dui direction. The metal mother resides in the position of the metal father, nurturing and safeguarding. "Nurturing" is the One; "safeguarding" is the Four. They nurture and safeguard metal and water—metal and water are thus Four and One. Three days correspond to Geng; Geng gives birth to the Dui gate. Dui gives birth to the Qian father; Qian is the father of metal. The body of metal takes water and fire as its foundation. When fire flourishes, it melts metal, and metal transforms into water. Harmonizing and circulating, this water turns north and flows east, nourishing the verdant wood of Zhen and generating the dragon’s light of Jiao and Kang. The eastern constellations bear the southern fire star, refining the qi of Kui and Lou, rectifying the positions of Geng and Xin. The position corresponds to the western Great White Metal Hall.

The Metal Hall is the tiger’s chamber. Adjusting and descending, the earth follows and transforms the substance. Luxuriant and numinous, myriad auspices and spirits—supremely virtuous and honorable, their transformations are inexhaustible and cannot be surpassed. Once, a single grain transformed the ends of the earth. It can both save lives and harmonize families. If one hears of this early and diligently cultivates, the Emperor will invite you to ascend the Great Luo.

**On the Right and Wrong of Medicinal Substances**

When Qian and Kun unite in intercourse, the ten thousand things transform and arise. If Qian is not originary, or originary but not prosperous, or prosperous but not beneficial, or beneficial but not upright, it violates heaven and turns away from the source. Yang has nothing to bestow, and yin has nothing from which to sprout. Thus, the above does not descend, and the below does not ascend; heaven does not mist, and earth does not steam. Having lost the harmonious creation, how can the ten thousand things arise? This is called medicine that is not upright and violates heaven, fire that does not harmonize and turns away from the source. Though fire moves, the celestial tally does not respond. If the numinous does not descend, the hun soul flies away. If the medicine is not upright, wind and clouds do not aid the tiger. Without form, the dragon’s light is utterly cut off—how then can cinnabar arise?

Thus we know that cinnabar must be transformed by medicine, and medicine arises from cinnabar. As the *Scripture of the Golden and Azure* states: "Mercury is the essence of metal; when water returns as yellow liquid, this is the transformation of medicine." When medicine transforms, fire stirs and blossoms float—distinct and singular. The mother abandons that which it generates, welling forth as yellow liquid. This is the essence of the Great Yang, whose qi is called the Flowing Pearl. The Flowing Pearl is flowing mercury. The solar soul descends like dewdrops scattering pearls, gathering as water, flowing as liquid, congealing into solid ice, crystallizing as frost’s delicate lattice, coral’s sinuous curves, or the blossoms of cassia trees. Borrowing the name of the crescent-moon spirit fungus, it coalesces into the Great Precious Pearl. Fire moves the Three Luminaries, and numinous radiance illumines the night. This is the mutual aid of yin and yang, with Xun and Gen returning to Kun, yang departing and yin arriving, brightness waning and darkness arising.

Brightness and darkness are the exhaustion of the nine; when the nine are exhausted, yang’s light gradually brightens. The divine palace conceals its brilliance, luminosity hides its glow, and numinous cinnabar submits to the body. The arising of darkness is the birth of the six; the six are the beginning of the yin tally. Six in the second place is the end of obscurity; six in the third is ren and gui, which roundly return to the black body. This is the beginning and end of Qian and Kun, images following the generation of lines, numinous transformation and spiritual communion—the transformation of medicine.

Naturally summoning rosy clouds and gathering radiance, it engenders the numinous, drawing the blazing sun’s sprouts and nurturing the round and luminous divine medicine. Summoning tally and creating transformation, tiger omens and dragon auspices arise; the five tones harmonize, and luminous light crystallizes into amber-golden paste. The six pitch-standards shift, and cinnabar dots red agate. Fire’s emptiness shines through yin and yang; exiting and entering the two divisions, metal flourishes and wood prospers, unfolding the transformation of medicine.

The transformation of medicine is the Vermilion Bird’s regulation and movement, transmuting into jia and yi, nourishing bing and ding, fostering the Vermilion Fowl. The fowl belongs to the western position, transforming into the dui direction and becoming metal. Metal is born of water, pairing with ren and gui; water is born of metal, its qi endowed by geng and xin. Metal and water generate each other, mutually containing and conceiving. Within the mother’s womb, it is called the metal embryo and water mother. Water and fire melt and refine, now sinking, now floating. The floating is white cinnabar-mercury; the sinking is black water-lead. Floating and sinking without constancy, it is profound and difficult to fathom.

The Most High said: "Seen but not visible, heard but not audible, it latently creates transformation, bound to the seasons and divisions." The seasons and divisions refer to zi, wu, mao, and you. At *fu-zi*, fish scales cluster; at *gou-wu*, horse teeth frost; at *zhuang-mao*, stalactites form; at *guan-you*, feathers and wings break; at *bo-xu*, it resembles canine teeth; at *kun-xuan*, yin generates and yang transforms.

Kun generates Zhen and Dui, Qian; Qian generates Xun and Kun. Moreover, Qian receives ren and jia; Kan embraces the six wu; Gen unites with the six bing; Zhen illuminates the six geng; Xun completes the six xin; Li contains the six ji; Kun envelops yi and gui; Dui senses the six ding. The eight trigrams transform from Qian into the ten stems, uniting with the celestial origin.

The east’s jia and yi wood is the Azure Dragon, positioned among the seven lodges of Jiao, Kang, Di, Fang, Xin, Wei, and Ji. Its form is like a dragon, dwelling in the east—hence it is called the Azure Dragon. The south’s bing and ding fire is the Vermilion Bird, positioned among the seven lodges of Jing, Gui, Liu, Xing, Zhang, Yi, and Zhen. Its form is like a quail or crow, dwelling in the south—hence it is called the Vermilion Bird. The west’s geng and xin metal is the White Tiger, positioned among the seven lodges of Kui, Lou, Wei, Mao, Bi, Zui, and Shen. Its form is like a tiger, dwelling in the west—hence it is called the White Tiger. The north’s ren and gui water is the Dark Warrior, positioned among the seven lodges of Dou, Niu, Nü, Xu, Wei, Shi, and Bi. It has the body of a tortoise and snake, dwelling in the north—hence it is called the Dark Warrior.

The eight trigrams form images from Qian; the four and seven move the spirit’s work. Examining the sun’s path from south to north, the moon’s course from west to east, movement follows the Dipper’s turning, and transformation lies within. Within is the numinous cinnabar tripod; Qian completes mercury powder, which dots mercury into gold—how could it be merely thousands or tens of thousands? Though it aids the world, it is not excessive; it is not yet sufficient to be called divine or sagely. Ingesting it, one becomes a flying immortal, ascending to the azure heavens by day. Transcending the Three Realms, unbound by the Five Phases, my life rests in myself, forever escaping the suffering of the dark underworld.

Without the Great Return Elixir, who can avoid the path to the Yellow Springs? I dare not speak falsely; the scholar must realize this for themselves. Fully expounding the principles of the Three Powers, Qian and Kun complete their beginning and end. Cinnabar-mercury and lead-silver share the same root in nature and disposition. Grasping the sages’ intent, one creates a golden coffer. It produces night-shining sand, cinnabar called "as-you-wish," refining into a priceless pearl. Lifespan becomes equal to heaven and earth.

Those who attain this principle must revere it; those who peruse this text will verify their nature with you. Scholars, savor and ponder it—make it the bright mirror of the elixir chamber. Comprehending yin and yang, yin contains the yang chamber; the sun’s brilliance is manifest, the divine formula blazing. Purple blossoms lush, radiance resplendent, the sun’s glory illumines the dark void. Light interpenetrates, ascending and descending in communion.

The Three Powers’ water and fire manifest as cold and heat; fire ascends and water descends, like the sun and moon’s coming and going. Water and fire follow the sun and moon without diminishing their brightness. Cinnabar-mercury and lead-silver are of one kind. One kind of numinous sprout, a divine and wondrous medicine: the yellow sprout in one tripod divides into two and eight; twenty-four tripods begin in the flowering pond. In the end, the numinous gives birth to white snow. The divine tally and white snow can return the hun soul. When lesser scholars hear of this, they slander and rage.

Why, when one has already died, can the hun soul return? Once dead, the hun and po forever disperse—where can they be sought? Xu Fu spent years searching for herbs, yet the immortal grasses and numinous fungi were nowhere to be found. Since the Penglai immortal grasses have no form, on what basis can the returning hun soul rely?

I now tell you of the medicine that returns the hun soul: to return the hun soul, one must have the celestial hun and po. This is the true ancestor of the human hun soul. Returning the hun revives the dead form, restoring the body to its former state. Reborn into the world, what method is there?

The method is this: when *fu-zi* arrives, fish scales cluster; at *gou-wu*, horse teeth frost; at *zhuang-mao*, stalactites form; at *guan-you*, feathers and wings break. The body revives and lives again as before. How can one be reborn into the world?

The method by which it arises is the primordial womb—father and mother of the hun soul.
The father-mother primordial womb cannot be discoursed upon;
In its vastness, it gives birth to the ten thousand kinds of hun.
Sown in the fields of cultivation, they gestate and form the embryo—
Within the transformations of womb, egg, moisture, and metamorphosis,
Some become human, some beast, some fowl, some insect.
Human, beast, fowl, and insect all receive their nature;
Nature and life are bound together, the hun striking life.
The hun is the essence of metal, forming the foundation of life;
The foundation of life nurtures nature, the hun following alongside.
Nature and life are bound together, striking the hun and po.

The po belongs to the dim and obscure hun,
To the indistinct and the profound—
The essence of these two qi
Can generate the ten thousand images, uniting Heaven and Earth.
Great indeed is the union of Heaven and Earth, the gate of convergence!
The *Yi* contains Heaven and Earth, uniting the Raven and Hare;
The essence of the Raven and the marrow of the Hare join with the po and hun,
Root and stem bound together, belonging to nature and life.
Refine the hun and forge the po to create the divine elixir.
By summoning and calling forth the hun spirit, it can be returned—
Not through talismans or white snow alone;
Even a single cauldron of cinnabar would prove difficult in effect.

A single cauldron of cinnabar may be ingested,
And with prolonged use, it can restore yang and transform the bones,
Restoring yang and transforming the bones to become a true immortal—
Yet this requires the divine talisman and true white snow.
Great indeed is the divine talisman and true white snow!
It revives the hun and restores life, as with Xu Jia.
This is the most wondrous gate of the mysterious origin;
Lesser methods and side doors surely cannot achieve this.
Though the lesser methods of side doors have many adherents,
They cannot surpass the true lead and mercury.

True lead and true mercury—true Dragon and Tiger—
Dragon and Tiger radiate with light like Pangu.
Beneath the first green, the Tiger contends for brightness;
Seizing the divine light, they divide into yellow and green.
The essence-light of Dragon and Tiger shoot toward each other,
Gathered into the golden world of Penglai.
Within it stands the Terrace of Gathered Light, the Treasury of Treasures,
Where the jewel-flower blooms in perfect roundness, its radiance unfolding.

The light is resplendent,
Five-colored red glass encasing the moon of treasures.
Suddenly, the moon of treasures veils the red glass,
Mutually enclosing, their lights intertwining.
Water and fire entwine, blending sun and moon;
Sun and moon unite like linked rings,
The five stars strung as pearls, threading the five phases.
Threading the five phases without dissipation,
Naturally, water and fire generate the divine substance.

The divine substance is wondrous—
The Star of the Old Man of the Southern Pole appears as an auspice.
The star appears as an auspice,
Divine aid causes the purple qi of the Great Yang to arise.
The purple qi, like mist, ascends straight upward,
Piercing the canopy at the center of the cauldron.
Within the cauldron, it coils like frost and snow,
Rising and descending, intertwining.
Intertwined and bound together, they form branching pillars,
Delicate and intricate as a coral tree.

The coral scatters its strands, its branches falling away;
Yang’s hardness gradually grows as yin’s weakness is stripped away.
When all yin is exhausted, yang qi flourishes,
And after nine revolutions, the elixir forms, crystallizing into purple blossoms.
The purple blossoms enwrap the gathered golden essence,
Drawing forth the quintessence of the Five Emperors’ splendor.

The essence of rosy clouds divides into five names:
Dawn’s rosy clouds are bright,
Dusk’s rosy clouds are divine,
Falling rosy clouds are numinous,
Flying rosy clouds descend,
Fire’s rosy clouds welcome.
Welcoming the rosy clouds, they return home in splendor,
Generating the five fortunes of true noble rosy clouds—
Auspicious and infinitely propitious, the great flourishing rosy clouds of numinous cinnabar.
The myriad auspices gather in reverence to the Dragon’s rosy clouds of purple numinous cinnabar,
Universally aiding the immortals of the grassy realms for ten thousand years—
The rosy clouds of ten thousand numinous cinnabars that transmute stone into gold,
The rosy clouds of wish-fulfilling treasures,
The numinous cinnabar of the five rosy clouds, five stones, and five spirits.
The Most High Mysterious Origin Sage Ancestor adds to them,
Forming five cauldrons of purple divine cinnabar.
Twenty-four cauldrons divided into five,
With added water and fire, the cinnabar is refined.
Years and months link endlessly,
Twelve divine talismans and nine white snows,
Revolving and augmenting,
Adding sun and moon,
Sun and moon augmenting water and fire,
Adding yin talismans and yang talismans—
No deviation, no error, no misfortune, no alteration.
The nine-year white snow re-enters, turning into cinnabar,
Its divine power enhanced by the divine talisman.
The divine medicine transforms,
Belonging to yin and yang;
Yin and yang belong to the hexagrams,
The hexagrams’ fire mutually supporting.
Yin and yang drive each other,
Yin and yang push and shift, perfectly continuous without flaw.
The lines continue the hexagrams, following their changes,
Shifting and moving without fixed abode—
Above, middle, and below,
Eight thousand six hundred and forty hexagrams.
*Qian* and *Kun*, *Kan* and *Li* account for four hexagrams:
*Li*’s fire ascends above, *Kan*’s water moistens below.
*Kan* and *Li*—water and fire—drive each other,
Mutually propelling, fire following the hexagrams.
When the hexagrams’ fire wanes or waxes, it returns to the source,
Returning to the origin, origin after year after year,
Month after month, day after day,
Matching the primordial talisman’s fire record,
Uniting with the primordial talisman’s record without error.
The fire’s splendor accumulates, layer upon layer,
Refining the essence to the divine, the sagely, the numinous, the ultimate—
No addition can increase its boundless fortune,
Its vast and great divine transformations,
Its ultimate numinous changes—
Three things that cannot be added.
This is the cinnabar of the Mysterious Origin Sage Ancestor:
Three cauldrons of cinnabar,
Six years for purple numinous cinnabar,
Seven years for purple longevity cinnabar,
Eight years for purple golden cinnabar—
The highest grade, the supreme medicine,
The numinous purple talisman of divine medicine,
The divine talisman descending from Heaven.

**Cinnabar’s Verification of the Dao Song**
Teach the child these wondrous words,
That the child may know the origin of the Dao.

At the beginning of Heaven and Earth, there was the Nameless—
I grasped the primal before Heaven and Earth.
With names, it became the Mother of the Myriad Things,
And the myriad things return to the vast origin.

Gathering yin to form the Earth,
Accumulating yang to shape the Heavens—
Stealing the principle of the Three Powers,
Cinnabar aligns with Nature.

The true and upright virtue of Qian and Kun,
Radiant and bright, gives birth to the essence of life.
Dim and distant, then dark and profound,
Its reflected light embraces the Great One.

Gold takes cinnabar as its master,
Receiving harmony from the mother of mercury.
The essence of the sun’s departing fire,
Pierces the abode of the formless and unseen.
Spiritual brilliance penetrates the luminous,
Its radiant splendor blazing forth and abiding.

The White Tiger inhales the red glass,
Golden blossoms give rise to jade mushrooms.
To congeal the supreme medicine,
Myriad transformations follow the hexagrams’ strategies.

The cinnabar’s image follows the hexagrams’ grains,
Its numinous efficacy defies depiction.
The treasure coalesces in azure skies,
Its rosy glow dividing into five hues:
First called Crimson Golden Red,
Second named Flying White Snow,
Third termed Celestial Valley Green,
Fourth known as Black Lead Liquid,
Fifth named Central Yellow Essence—
Once solidified, it endures for ten thousand springs.

Searching the hundred bones and nine orifices,
All illness is eradicated.
It restores the aged and infirm,
Lightens the body, and darkens the hair.
Teeth regrow like silver and jade,
Dim eyes shine like lamps.
Concealing one’s traces among men,
One accumulates deeds of hidden virtue.

Not clinging to worldly splendor,
One may yet ascend to the Jade Clarity.
Heal the sick when they seek aid,
Bestow gold upon the poor,
Impart the alchemical canon to the earnest—
Thus concludes the first scroll of *Master Xu’s Stone Casket Record*.

**Oral Instructions of Master Chen**
When merit and practice reach fulfillment in a single morning,
Heavenly scriptures arrive at the Supreme Ultimate.

True medicine is lead,
True mercury follows the fire’s arising.
Water and fire respond to Heaven’s tally,
Timing must not err.
If the four seasons fall out of balance,
Cold and warmth no longer follow the rhythm.
Midwinter like scorching summer,
Midsummer thick with frost and snow—
Often the clepsydra falters,
Dawn and dusk grow indistinct.

When Kun’s fire wanes toward extinction,
Yin’s encroachment stirs yet unmanifest.
Water surges, Kan consumes yang,
Fire multiplies, poised to fell the wood.
Mutual conquest, not mutual generation,
Yin and yang defy the proper order.
Fire and metal fail to return,
The Dipper strays south and north.
The four sevens plunge into chaos,
The celestial pivot is lost.

Refining adepts, ponder deeply,
Apply your mind with meticulous care.
Knowing it need not be spoken,
It lies in diligent practice.
Read this text ten thousand times—
It is called the Ladder to Heaven.

Thus concludes the second scroll of *Master Xu’s Stone Casket Record*.

**The Sage Stone’s Pointer to the Mysterious**
From what constraint do the myriad forms arise in emptiness?
Wondrous transformation stems from cinnabar and mercury.

From Fusang’s east, the golden crow’s essence emerges,
Its flaming feathers ablaze with radiance.
Soaring and coursing, the yang fire is called the Sun’s Soul,
Setting at dusk, flourishing at dawn—waning returns to waxing.
The red wheel harnesses the chariot of dawn’s light,
Circling the lost and returning, roaming the bounded realm.
The true essence manifests as cinnabar through the body,
Melting stone and flowing gold—who can discern its depth?

Its light sustains Heaven and Earth, receiving the sun’s glow,
All things live through the cinnabar’s transformation.
Yet cinnabar is no fabricated thing,
Not smelted from the five metals nor the eight stones.
Within the Great Void lies the grain of Returned Cinnabar,
Transforming into a night-shining pearl unknown to men.
The pearl’s glow, dense and resplendent, appears in the cinnabar skies,
The jade hare’s limpid radiance follows the hexagrams’ lines.
Kun gives rise to Zhen, Dui to Qian, then Xun,
Gen and Kun begin and end, returning to the yang lines.
Yang departs, yin arrives—the sacred medicine,
Immortal perfected ones call it Purple Golden Ointment.

One drop restores sight to the blind,
Two drops regrow flesh on withered bones,
Three drops transmute stubborn stone into gold,
Four drops turn long rivers to curds,
Five drops keep spring blossoms from falling,
Sun and moon bloom eternally, never fading.
Common pottery and rubble all turn to gold,
Decayed things touched by it renew their hue.
For those afflicted by consumptive corpse-transmission,
Ingesting it brings instant efficacy and bodily lightness.

The foolish claim it is a thing within the body,
Seeking matches in the bedchamber.
Yet it is not the body’s qi and essence—
When essence departs and qi dissipates, what enters?
The hundred spirits scatter and flee,
Leaving the aged, withered, and infirm with chronic ailments.
The sage declares all such notions false—
How can they compare to refining the golden liquid?

The master explains the golden liquid’s ancient origin:
At Pan Gu’s initial division, the Dao’s root.
It was the dragon’s essence giving birth to the tiger’s marrow,
Jia and Yi, Geng and Xin transforming into Ren and Gui.
Bing and Ding, the Vermilion Bird’s fiery spirit soars,
Descending to the Dark Heaven to unite with Wu and Ji.
Thirty-six cycles of ascent and descent,
Scarlet intertwining in north and south.
Subtly inverting the essence of Heaven and Earth,
Wondrous creation arises from the Three, the Five, and the One.

What do the Three, the Five, and the One signify?
They give birth to Heaven, Earth, and Man.
Birth to Heaven grants the power to reverse Heaven,
Birth to Earth ensures firmness and the flourishing of all things.
Birth to Man divides high and low—
Those of shallow fortune cannot refine cinnabar.
The earnest adept must first recognize lead,
For without discerning true lead, cultivation is in vain.

Heaven has five thieves—those who see them prosper.
Lead harbors five hues, each an auspicious sign.
Born from the Nameless at Heaven and Earth’s beginning,
The Mother of the Myriad Things is no ordinary being.
Beyond the ordinary, it eludes even sages,
Hidden within the Mysterious Origin’s indistinct depths.
Dim and distant, dark and profound—awaiting the utmost essence,
Stirring yang into lightning, generating light.

The light spirals, dividing into five colors,
Beneath it lies lead’s essence, unknown to men.
In spring, plants and trees; in summer, like ice;
In autumn, no gathering frost; in winter, no snow.
Embracing harmony, nurturing gradually to numinous attainment,
The yellow sprout does not mingle with worldly lead.

The yellow sprout, nurtured for eight hundred years,
Transforms into azure mercury, elusive to find.
Azure mercury, quicksilver hard to seek,
It courses through the Four Great without end.
Azure mercury, aged another eight hundred years,
Transforms into azure gold, even harder to obtain.
Azure gold is the azure dragon’s bone,
Its generating number three, its completing number eight.
When three and eight’s count ends, mercury’s qi turns azure,
Transforming into azure dust that ascends.

Ascending forever as the immortal’s emolument,
Through eons of primal brightness, it becomes the Five Blessings.
Emerald clouds and luminous azure dust,
Rising to the Clear Capital, returning to its domain.
Entering the Palace of Purple Yang,
The Hall of Bright Sun blazes with dragon’s red glow.
Its radiance shines boundlessly,
Utmost yang extinguishes all yin’s shadows.

Lead divides into five hues, flames soaring into the void—
Azure, crimson, white, black, with yellow at the center.

Glowing bright and radiant, hues blend in warmth,
Purple spirits and auspicious qi shroud in cinnabar clouds.
The myriad spirits breathe, lead’s qi flows through,
Jade lads and jade maidens feast upon the vast sky,
Feeding on its radiance, the Heavenly Elder,
All immortals partake, their lives boundless.

Once the Jade Emperor appeared in the dark vault,
Proclaiming this the ancestral lineage of returning elixir.
This lead differs from worldly lead—
Suspended in space, luminous and resplendent,
Its sunset glow pierces the Crystal Palace,
Concealed brilliance reveals the Golden Rooster’s form.

Breathing winds and clouds, tiger and dragon convene,
Dragon calls to tiger, tiger calls to dragon,
Vast qi congeals into the true supreme medicine,
Swift as lightning, one ascends into the clouds.
Transforming form and bone, the body soars through space,
Its visage like the Primordial Heavenly Honored One,
Sharing one qi with heaven and earth,
Returning to the root, reverting to the source—this is the ancestor.

Though myriad divergent methods are expounded,
None compare to the affairs of golden cinnabar.
Abiding in the world, lead essence rules the five metals,
Parent of the seventy-two stones.
When the adept’s spirit gathers it,
First cast out the yin earth.
Knead lead and cinnabar into clods of soil,
Sealed with the six-one method, cherished and guarded.
Refine with fire for a day and night,
Fire extinguished, smoke dispersed, earth turns to ash.
Rising lead inverts and enters the ash pool,
Fire ignites, lead melts into divine water.
This divine water originally issues from white gold—
First take white gold to fashion the crucible,
White gold is the womb of mercury,
Reverting to the source, mercury is refined.
Mercury is the elixir of immortality,
Not the common mercury of the vulgar world.

Azure Phoenix descends from the flaming sky,
Shedding feathers, head, and talons.
Mercury, thus subdued, cannot take flight,
Refined into golden elixir, the great medicine.

Yet I fear revealing heaven’s secrets,
Such words are rare in the mortal realm.
If not for repeated exhortations,
Those lustful and greedy would be no better than beasts.
Should one violate these precepts, the gods know—
Drawn into Dengdu, the punishment is no light matter.
Beyond lie the nine springs, endless suffering,
Not to be spoken of lightly or carelessly.
Careless speech betrays the unworthy,
Dooming them to ten thousand kalpas of hellish torment.

**On the Luminous Perfection of the Spirit Chamber**

Among all worldly affairs, only one is extraordinary—
That extraordinary thing is the matter of the True One,
The Way of the Returning Elixir.
Many scholars pursue it,
Yet few glimpse its root or fathom its end,
Thus a thousand attempts yield ten thousand failures,
And true success remains rare.

For the great elixir’s refinement,
One must build an altar in an auspicious direction,
Select the land, choose an auspicious day—
No reckless action, lest misfortune be invited.
The altar has three tiers, each eight feet square,
Unequal in height, each with its own guiding line.
The topmost tier stands two by six in height,
Aligned with the Nine Palaces, the nine luminaries, nine positions—
Its upper breadth one zhang and six feet, the number of two eights.
The middle tier stands two by five in height,
Divided by the Eight Trigrams, the heart and viscera of the altar—
Its breadth one zhang and four feet, corresponding to the twenty-four qi.
The lowest tier stands two by six in height,
Arranged with the eight gates, opening and closing by measure—
Its breadth two zhang and eight feet, aligned with the twenty-eight constellations.
Four sides wield swords to suppress the four directions,
Eight mirrors hang to dispel inauspicious influences,
Five-colored silks drape according to position and direction.
Upon the altar rests a sacred furnace named the Spirit Crucible,
The Spirit Crucible appears and vanishes, gathering fire’s qi,
Gathering fire’s qi to nurture the cauldron,
The cauldron receives fire’s qi to nourish the Spirit Chamber.
The Spirit Chamber, luminous and perfect—
Not round, yet like a parrot’s form,
Not bright, yet waxing with the moon.

The golden cauldron, crescent like a pot,
The Spirit Chamber, its child, tapers at both ends.
Entering the cauldron, the cauldron resists settling,
Entering the cauldron, the embryo lies transverse, the cauldron tilts.
An inverted cauldron loses the Hall of Brightness’ true virtue,
A transverse embryo disrupts yin and yang.
Sun and moon fail to unite, metal and water exhaust,
Passion and nature part, never to meet.
Man’s cap and woman’s hairpin miss their timely years,
Qi fails to merge, bodies fail to unite—
All because the ritual image is askew,
Causing Qian and Kun to remain unjoined.
Kan and Li, north and south, in chaos,
East and west, Mao and You, indistinguishable.
Water and fire lose their positions,
Metal and wood stray from their directions.
The dragon hides, vanishing from the celestial path,
Killing qi scatters with the wind—
The tiger, formless, for the golden embryo fails to take shape.
Hare and rooster part, heaven and earth overturn without reason,
Divine water spills and is lost.

If one seeks the crow and obtains the hare,
One must rely on the craftsman’s hand to establish Qian and Kun,
Enter the cauldron to harmonize, reorder yin and yang,
Revolve the sun and moon—
Only then can one follow positions and directions,
Metal and wood unite.
Revolving fire’s qi to engender the solar essence,
Subduing metal and water to nourish the lunar spirit.
The qi of east, west, south, and north,
All descend into the golden cauldron,
Auspicious tiger and dragon signs congeal within the profound darkness.
Chaos and light intermingle, radiance vast and boundless,
The boundless true void—
The true void refines the wondrous,
Refining the wondrous true void,
The true void conceals the profound.
Concealed void refines the wondrous, refining bedrock metal—
The wondrous divides the maiden,
Dui’s body engenders Ren.
This speaks of refining the wondrous to perfect the Spirit Chamber,
The Spirit Chamber’s brilliance opens, the spirit emerges and vanishes.
Emergence is brightness—
This speaks of refining the wondrous to unite as numen,
The numinous essence, crystalline, the spirit as qi.
Qi has no form,
Qi enters the profound darkness, traversing the indistinct.
Within the indistinct, at the center, dwells the numinous—
The numinous speaks of wondrous qi uniting as spirit.
Spirit moves qi, qi engenders the numinous,
The numinous is the child, qi the mother.
How could the Mysterious Origin’s Sacred Ancestor speak falsely?

It further speaks of refining the spirit to unite with the Dao,
Refining spirit to unite with the Dao—this is no ordinary Dao.
One should seek it diligently in the *Yin Fu Jing*,
Observe the heavens’ Way—what is the sky?
The sky has the Silver River, the chamber has what?
The chamber has the stellar river, constellations arrayed—
Zhang and Yi fly, Xu and Wei pursue.
The twenty-eight constellations revolve,
Water and fire tread in north and south.
Zi and Shen command, He and Fang unite,
White Tiger and Azure Dragon stand on either side.
The tiger roars, wind arises; the dragon spouts mist,
Mist and rosy clouds redden, outshining chaotic flames.

Scarlet fragments shatter into beads,
Bead upon bead—true pearls of crimson,
Crimson blossoms with purple veins birth the Golden Duke.
Golden Duke joins with water and earth,
Refined into yellow sprouts that turn to white snow,
Purple sand and rouge swirl in disarray,
Swirling—Azure Dragon’s ointment.

The rouge, young; the White Tiger, aged,
Refined into dragon’s ointment and tiger’s marrow,
In the Hall of Longevity, the wish-fulfilling jewel is born,
What are ten thousand taels of gold to this?

What are ten thousand taels?
It can touch the withered elder, granting eternal youth,
The Hall of Longevity’s elixir brings myriad springs,
The radiant sun nourishes, the Pillar of Heaven gleams.

When the Pillar of Heaven gleams, soul and spirit unite,
Toad’s marrow and hare’s essence—mercury floats white,
Spirit responds to soul’s radiance, birthing jade mushrooms,
The Divine Mansion of Broad Cold, the palace of Chang’e.

Cinnabar’s flying light rises, shaking Li’s restraint,
The Golden Crow flies into the Palace of Broad Cold,
Flaming mists and rosy clouds—dragon’s exhaled vapor,
Vermilion cinnabar descends, purple-gold crimson.

Crimson blossoms of purple-gold, golden blossoms of purple,
Golden blossoms trace purple clouds in purple haze,
Haze threads golden light through purple mist,
Crimson and purple blend, concealing golden hue.

Purple radiance shines sunward, ascending golden-green,
Golden-green void-blue births purple radiance,
Verdant haze clears to azure, merging with blue mist,
Mist’s blossoms—numinous essence, numinous cinnabar sap.

Cinnabar sheds its crimson, turning azure-green,
In form, it manifests in the unseen,
Scattered, the dragon hides like a ghost in concealment.
Like a ghost in concealment, it flees—water and fire cannot trace it,
Yet when cinnabar and mercury cling to form, water and fire arise,
Without true lead, it truly cannot be.

Truly cannot be—
Cinnabar hides within lead, stone conceals fire,
Strike stone to see fire, fire births mist,
Without striking, the mist’s essence remains natural,
Cinnabar hidden in lead is also natural.

Water nurtures, fire nourishes—only then is there resonance,
Resonating, it penetrates, birthing golden liquid,
Golden liquid unites with spirit, eternally numinous,
Flaming, it connects spirit with qi.

Spirit rushes, qi moves—wind and thunder drum,
Drumming wind and thunder, fire gives birth to earth,
Kan’s wu, the mysterious earth—metal is the father,
Li’s ji, the receptive earth—mercury is the mother.

Mercury as mother—the Supreme’s words:
“The world has a beginning, which is the mother of all under heaven.”
Heaven above, vast and azure,
Crystal numinosity, flying light,
True numinosity summons—cinnabar and mercury take flight,
Flying light of cinnabar,
Fiery flames press close in pursuit,
Boiling, the sound is mournful,
Its voice echoes over rivers, responding to emptiness,
What does emptiness give birth to?
Water’s surge, fire’s seething.

Fire seethes—the Weaver Girl’s qi wanes,
Water surges—the Infant Boy sheds blackness,
Shedding black, purity reveals the treasure,
Qi wanes—red departs from its hue.

The Great Yang shines,
The Great Yang unfurls its light, renewing daily,
The sun’s renewal—mercury’s first coagulation,
Lead and mercury’s first coagulation—what form does the elixir take?

The elixir’s form in heaven
Emerges as sun and moon,
The sun as a flowing pearl,
Primal qi’s emptiness and nothingness,
Piercing metal, entering stone,
Spirit emerges, ghost vanishes.

Spirit emerges—spirit ascends to Heaven’s Gate,
At once the celestial soul;
Ghost vanishes—ghost enters Earth’s Door,
At once the terrestrial spirit.
Celestial soul and terrestrial spirit encircle the ancestral origin,
Mutually serving as chambers, dividing at zi and wu,
Water and fire intersect, fire gives birth to earth,
Two earths form the gui, silver transforms into gold,
Li’s fire chamber holds Kan’s essence.

Li’s essence-light,
Heaven’s One lies hidden,
Heaven conceals its light,
Brightness does not emerge,
Hidden brightness shines within,
Externally, it connects with radiance.

Radiance fills the void,
Light and brightness interpenetrate,
This is the sacred day and sacred month where metal and fire meet,
Numinous movement subtly connects,
The purple numinous elixir,
The elixir possesses numinous power,
Uniting with yang fire,
Flaming, it burns the void.

Flying light spreads qi,
Resonating, it penetrates,
Jade mushroom’s elixir essence,
Pierces mist, enters crimson.

Entering crimson—fire’s blossom-light,
Clearly illuminating.
The illuminator is Li’s feminine,
The illuminator is Kan’s masculine,
Li’s feminine and Kan’s masculine,
Light and brightness interpenetrate.

Penetrating the feminine into the masculine,
Transformations are boundless.
Layer upon layer, piercing mist—blossoms upon blossoms,
Blossoms arise from the two luminaries,
True Wood, true Metal.
True Wood binds the east—Zhen’s thunder arises,
Zhen is the eldest son—Zhen’s Wood gives birth to fire.
Zhen is also the dragon,
The dragon follows fire’s path—fire is true.

Its west—Dui conceals Metal and Water,
Water can harmonize with geng,
Dui is the youngest daughter.
Tiger’s roar births wind,
Wind and rain take form and sound,
Swift and ceaseless,
Form and sound leave no trace,
Metal and Wood intersect,
The two qi descend with numinosity,
Forge into golden essence.

Golden essence, the great elixir,
Within it, the Five Phases,
The Five Phases’ numinous water,
Numinous water’s golden nectar,
Numinous water, numinous fire.
The two are intimate,
Water within fire,
Gold contained in water.

True yang mercury receives metal’s qi,
Zhen unites with geng and xin, entering the you position,
Zhen receives the yang tally, gradually forming the ninefold brilliance of radiant light.
Zhen’s initial presence,
From the beginning, entering the turning Zhen, giving birth to numinous Kun,
The initial six transforms into Zhen’s initial nine.
Illuminating the six geng—geng belongs to you,
Zhen governs five days as one pentad,
Zhen arrives to receive the tally for sixty hours.

The upper yang cycle ends and begins anew,
Ending at Zhen, beginning at Dui,
Dui pursues the yin tally, Kun’s six-two,
Exchanging lines, the image’s transformation cannot be fathomed.
Six-two changes to yang, becoming nine-two,
This is metal entering the realm of fire,
The moon traverses the ding position, half-wheel light,
Why does metal serve fire?
How does Dui resonate with six ding?

Ding belongs to ji, Dui to metal,
Ding belongs to fire,
Metal and fire intersect, fire gives birth to earth,
Earth gives birth to metal,
Metal and fire begin at Dui,
Governing five days as one pentad.
Dui arrives to receive the tally for sixty hours,
The middle yang cycle,
Ending and beginning anew.
Ending at Dui, beginning at Qian,
Yang departs, yin arrives—naturally so.

Yang’s extremity is Qian, yin’s extremity is Kun,
Qian ends at nine, yin ends at six,
Six-two and six-three—three changes form nine,
Nine-three, vigilant at dusk—forming Qian’s body,
In full brilliance, it roundly illuminates the east’s jia.
The six jia belong—Qian governs three and five,
Qian governs five days as one pentad,
Qian arrives to receive the tally for sixty hours,
The lower yang cycle—thirty-five preceding,
Accumulating one hundred eighty hours—symbolizing half a year,
Virtue completes Qian’s body, uniting the two eights,
Yang’s extremity gives birth to yin—Qian’s body is full,
Retreating yang, approaching yin—turning to receive at Xun,
Xun governs the yin tally, Kun’s initial six,
Six xin forms Xun, forming from sixteen,
Sixteen to twenty-six,
Xun is about to give birth to Gen.

Xun governs five days as one pentad,
Xun arrives to receive the tally for sixty hours,
The upper yin cycle—ending then beginning.

Ending at Xun’s hexagram, beginning to form Gen,
Xun and Gen exchange lines—images now fixed.
Images now fixed, Gen unites with six bing to receive Xun,
Six-one Xun, six-two Gen,
Six-three presses near—yin flourishes in full.

Yin flourishes, water waxes as fire wanes,
The twenty-third day belongs to the last quarter.
Last quarter—Gen’s fire naturally wanes,
Gen governs five days as one pentad,
Ceasing at Gen, it arrives to receive the tally for sixty hours,
The middle yin cycle—ending then beginning.

Ending at Gen’s hexagram, beginning to form Kun,
Kun’s image is black,
Yi and gui’s six-three—Kun’s yi,
Six-one belongs to Kun—thirty days,
Kun governs five days as one pentad complete.

Kun arrives to receive the tally for sixty hours,
The lower yin cycle—ending then beginning,
Beginning at the prior three-five,
Ending at the latter three-five.
Six pentads—dusk and dawn receive cold and heat,
Dusk and dawn, darkness and new moon—shifting in turn,
Darkness accumulates one hundred eighty hours—symbolizing half a year,
After the prior quarter, before the latter quarter,
Six pentads, three decades—symbolizing one year,
One year fully employs twelve nodes,
Hexagram fire wanes and waxes through each month.

One month, six pentads—one celestial cycle,
First the prior heaven, then the succeeding heaven,
Time tallies ten thousand three hundred.
Ten thousand three thousand—fire tally complete,
Standard for three years.

Three years—fire refines the flowing-pearl tripod,
The tripod resembles summoning yang to gather the celestial mirror,
Within the tripod, light reflects the sun’s rosy glow,
Glow reflects the sun’s essence to unite with the tripod.

Uniting the tripod, the sun’s red transmits the gnomon’s shadow,
The gnomon’s shadow moves south to the sun’s bing,
The sun reaches bing-noon—lines merge with mercury,
Striking the spirit chamber.
Spirit drinks the shadow,
Drinking the shadow, deeply drunk—drunk then sober,
Spirit and qi harmonize—spirit mellows.

Spirit mellows,
Trailing flames, flickering,
Circulating numinous light in a circle.
Light—mirror’s surface, fire’s crystal plate,
The crystal plate scatters like golden grains.
Golden grains—fire’s radiance, Mars’ glow,
Drunk like willow and wheat—color deep yellow,
The Grand Granary’s spirit abode—plate brimming.
Brimming, glinting—crystal radiance,
Night belongs to the moon’s essence—tripod’s image white.

Tripod’s image white—this is the moon’s fullness,
Tripod connects to heaven,
In heaven, the moon is full—so too the tripod.
In heaven, within the tripod—hexagram belongs to Qian,
Qian’s substance,
Tripod’s round brightness moves with the moon’s fullness,
Light like a mirror’s surface, a crystal plate,
Refining silver toad—moon-round.
Moon full, waxing at Xun—waning at its side,
Darkness belongs to yin tally—tripod’s image black,
New moon’s image white, darkness’ image black,
Black and white, waning and waxing—round and crescent,
Within round and crescent,
Moon bright at midnight—listen to the watchman’s clepsydra.

As the clepsydra ends, the day gazes at the gnomon’s plate,
Long gazing at the shadow—forgetting the prior day’s sunset,
Sunset at you—rosy glow,
Image responds to cinnabar.
Within the tripod, together reflecting—knotting red glow.

Tripod—exquisite, resonant,
Resonant fire transforms into lotus,
Fire tally knots—gathering the sun’s primordial chaos,
Primordial chaos—not the ordinary sweetness of honey on the tongue.
Feeding, unaware—body follows the wind,
Lightly rising, soaring—riding the great void.
Riding the great void—revealing the immortal lineage,
Do not speak of meeting again in the next life,
Too foolish and ignorant,
Cease discussing wondrous being—speak of true emptiness.

Right and wrong the same,
Emptiness is precisely form, form is emptiness,
Its color—verdant, shining red.
I reveal to you my family’s tradition,
The great yang moves within the moon’s brightness,
Moon’s brightness—great yang, heaven’s medicine,
When one ingests it—riding simurgh and crane.
Ten thousand methods, a thousand gates—all are mistaken,
Learn this one move of my family,
This one move—leaping beyond the five phases, truly joyous.

The golden tripod—empty, without discussion.
I have heard that in high antiquity, refining the elixir
Must rely on method,
Wondrously meeting across many lives,
Predestined affinity—encountering to become true,
This is called mutual attainment,
Gaining the numen of heaven and earth.

Someone asks: The numen of heaven and earth,
Born from where?
Answer: Chiseling open primordial chaos,
Earth divides into yellow and black,
Giving birth to heaven and earth’s golden essence,
Deeply hidden in the murky depths,
As the Dao’s root,
When feathered guests obtain it, they can create the golden tripod.

Moreover, the golden tripod—
From what is it born?
From what does it arise?
Answer: Born from formless,
The beginning of the nameless,
The mother of the ten thousand things—what is it?
The child obtains golden essence to establish the foundation of life,
The foundation of life is merely the golden flower’s pool,
The flower pool’s spirit water—great abyss’ crystal,
The great abyss’ golden crystal—surpassing the ten thousand numina,
The ten thousand numina are called the mother of the ten thousand things,
Former sages took it to make the tripod’s gold.

Tripod’s gold—originally sought within medicine,
Sought—it is not the world’s gold,
The world’s gold—what is extraordinary?
Golden tripod, tripod’s gold—connecting heaven and earth,
Connecting the three luminaries, the tripod receives the tally,
Mercury invades the golden tripod—qi generates emptiness,
Empty qi generates emptiness—nothing generates being,
Being generates nothing,
Originally having nothing—nothing.
Nothing transforms the pivot,
The pivot’s natural true kind,
Why worry water and fire will not nurture?

Water moistens downward—water above,
Po absorbs mercury—hun sways the pattern,
Fire below—fire flames upward,
Fire nurtures water—generating according to line images.
Yang image—flowing pearl, water makes the elixir,
Yin image—following metal, water grows,
Metal, water, fire—named three-five,
Metal three-five,
Metal governs the exterior—mercury dwells alongside,
Zhen’s green dragon, Dui’s white tiger,
Qian’s body—round brightness, metal three-five.

Metal gradually darkens, water gradually rises,
White tiger wanes and waxes—transforming into black tiger,
Xuanwu—yin born, entering gui’s realm,
Xun, Gen return to Kun—water three-five.
Metal as child, water as mother,
Yin tally, yang fire—dividing zi and wu,
Hard and soft, civil and martial—shifting in turn,
Fire born, fire extinguished—transforming into earth.

This is fire three-five,
Water and fire intersect the four directions,
Metal acts as fire—about to wane,
Once as water—about to generate fire then ending, fire then beginning,
Waning then ending, generating then beginning,
Fixed floating and sinking—metal transforms into water,
Dividing the clepsydra—white transforms into black,
Black then ending, white then beginning,
Black and white come and go—following the moon!

Knowing white, come to guard black—depart,
Three hundred sixty-five degrees.

Opening the Gate of Life and sealing the Door of Death,
water and fire roam leisurely within the crucible and cauldron.
Water and fire without error—yet the medicine holds numinous power.
Why numinous?
Water dissolves, fire steams and seethes,
water and fire act as matchmakers to summon the solar soul.
The soul expands, the spirit shatters—yang’s radiance takes flight,
the po devours the soul’s bloom and feeds on azure sand.

Feeding on azure sand, feeding on horse-tooth spar,
horse-tooth spar’s numinous marvel unmatched in the world—
earning the name "flowing soul."
Soul crosses water, water crosses soul,
thunder shakes yang brightness—heavenly tally descends in obeisance.
Daybreak aligns with the sun’s end—
*hasten, hasten, as in the statutes and ordinances!*

Urge the soul to pursue and tame the tiger’s den,
breathing in wind and clouds, drawing in water and fire.
Water and fire boil and roar—the tiger’s roar resounds.

Water’s numinous essence gleams, fire’s numinous essence gleams,
water’s numinous spirit, fire’s numinous spirit—po and hun.
The po’s numen can absorb the hun’s luminous essence.
Hun absorbs po, po absorbs hun—
hun absorbs po, then hun settles the crucible;
po absorbs hun, then po crucibles the hun.

Now, the hun-crucible:
it subdues and restrains mercury, preventing it from flying,
soaring and playing within the crucible’s light.
Scattered rosy clouds dissolve in searing brilliance—
purple gold and rouge powder—thus called "hun settled."
Settled, it does not move; moved, fire rises straight.
Fire’s straight ascent and descent—
neither going nor coming—
when applied, it becomes treasure.

Now, the po-crucible:
Xuanwu’s tranquility—
tranquil, then metal generates water.
Metal can generate water—
water then clarifies and brightens.
Brightness gives rise to gathered radiance—thus called "po,"
the crucible is indeed this.

Metal nurtures water, fire nurtures metal,
hun longs for po, po longs for hun—
naturally, the golden crucible governs spirit and brightness,
producing cinnabar whose nature aligns with essence—
not mere cinnabar or mercury.

The great medicine, the golden elixir—three times eight grades,
myriad images and hexagrams arrayed within the golden crucible.
Water and fire applied with depth and precision,
the twenty-four qi mutually advance and align.

Seen yet unseen, heard yet unheard,
long life and wondrous years refine the golden crucible.
Fired into priceless treasure—
reversing yang, transmuting bones into purple dissolution and gold.

Purple dissolution and gold commune with spirit and numen,
the golden crow enters yang—light advances.
Azure rosy clouds dance, crimson rosy clouds move,
azure and crimson together return to the golden crucible.
Refined into the alchemical furnace—
nine returns, seven reversions smelt the void.

Seven reversions smelt into red jade powder,
nine returns smelt into purple gold nectar.
Purple gold nectar, red jade powder—
hun harmonizes with po, po harmonizes with hun.
Originally possessing void, void transforms into spirit.

Spirit transforms into qi, qi transforms into water,
water transforms into wood, wood transforms into fire,
fire transforms into earth, earth transforms into metal,
metal transforms into water.
Drill, cluster the five phases within the golden crucible—
the two luminaries ascend in radiant splendor.

Water flies, fire flies—
Li transforms into fire, Kan transforms into water.
Water excites fire, fire excites water—
Li chews Kan, Kan chews Li,
mutually chewing, grinding like rainbow-shedding, rainbow-shedding qi,
condensing into saltpeter-like fragments.
Horse-tooth spar’s teeth gleam with luminous purity.

Light pursues the living into tiger’s amber,
on the purple gold terrace, frost and snow congeal.
Its hue like jade, ethereally drifting—
yang qi, light and pure, gently wafting.

Light and pure yang sand gleams like the sun,
glittering, vying in brilliance—sand outshines color.
Flickering, resplendent—yellow chariot’s numen,
the chariot’s numen can transmute and quicken life.
The chariot’s numen originally emerges from Fusang,
its essence found within lead, derived from sand.
Its ascending light scatters like grain, stars fly in disarray.
Stars ground fine—azure dragon’s bones—
the most divine, most sagely flying substance.
If it does not fly, how can one know?
Test by tossing a bit into the void—
surely it possesses the power to return to heaven.

Cinnabar soars high, ascending into the sky,
vermilion seen rushing into the golden crow’s den.
Light and pure yang nurtures the yang medicine—
radiance shoots toward yang, light illuminates the medicine.
Mutually shining, mutually searing—merging their light,
breath by breath, purple radiance ascends to the Great Yang.

Great Yin and Great Yang—true water and fire.
Water overcomes fire, fire extinguishes—greatly transforming into earth.
Hidden brightness, subdued fire—earth’s latent radiance,
latent radiance conceals void, void transforms into qi.
Void qi connects, linking above and below.

Linking above and below—fire follows the hexagrams.
Hexagram fire waxes and wanes—when full, it prospers.
Illuminating yang’s light, fire ignites brilliance—
countless thousands of miles.
Light generates fire’s prosperity—
yang’s essence pursues fire, fire summons yang.
Yang’s burning mirror sears the sun—
illuminating yang without end or limit.
Fire triumphs, light surges—qi’s light circulates.
Light penetrates the earth, earth connects with primordial qi.
Fire follows light, fire’s qi circulates—generating the ten thousand things.
Before one’s eyes, fire transforms, shining with yang’s light.

Yang’s burning mirror gathers yang’s light, stirring and resonating.
Stirred, it then connects—generating the indistinct.
Flourishing, blazing flames—yang’s essence.
Light pierces mist, giving birth to fire’s dazzling splendor.

Yang’s light follows into the golden abode,
illuminating the Qian and Kun’s cinnabar world.
Golden sand sprays fire, scattering yang’s light—
the great earth’s yang light generates the world.

Light pursues spirit, spirit pursues light—
the great thousand-worlds of sand lie hidden within.
When kalpas exhaust the Ganges’ sands of worlds,
one grain of sand, one kalpa—yang’s light is lost.

Yang’s light lost—what name remains?
From Dragon Han to Yan Kang, to Crimson Brightness—
these speak of kalpas already sunken and drowned,
kalpa’s power inescapable, unheard of.

Black winds drift, losing the Three Powers,
toppling peaks, collapsing mountains—all reduced to dust.
Earth, water, fire, wind—all swept away,
houses and towers, all utterly submerged.

All creatures, all life lose sustenance,
no distinction between south, north, east, or west.
The forest of myriad images—no trace remains,
the five phases, four images—where to seek?

Sound, resonance, form—inescapable.
Chaotic primordial light all darkens—
profoundly still, returning to profound profundity,
unilluminated depths reaching the utmost extreme.

At the utmost extreme, it returns to the origin,
reverting to the root, returning to the origin—before heaven and earth.
Before heaven and earth—
one qi can divide heaven and earth’s origin.
Primordial yellow’s upright qi—true unity’s ancestor,
able to generate the myriad images as the elixir’s mother.
By the mother, omens are established—forming the elixir’s foundation.
Omens summon the Azure Waist messenger to return.

The Azure Waist is summoned into the Hall of Lingering Light,
refined into window dust—light no longer appears.
Window dust is also called "sun’s yellow haze."

The Great Yang transforms—
when the Great Yang transforms, what occurs?
Water and fire flow through the twelve hours,
within the twelve hours, zi and wu exist in the center.
Mao and you divide the four nines—
four nines, fire drills thirty-six.
Zi and wu, mao and you divide north and south.

Wu belongs to yang—yin fire arises.
Chen, xu, chou, wei divide the four eights,
four eights, fire drills thirty-two,
water and fire simmer and boil to achieve completion.

Zi belongs to yin—yang fire arises.
Yin, shen, si, hai divide the four eights,
four eights, fire drills thirty-two,
a hundred marks of time divide day and night.
Day is heat, night is cold,
cold and heat clearly follow yin and yang.
Yin and yang divide like a chicken’s egg,
life and death ever cycle in seven at beginning and end.

On the third day, geng arises in Zhen, received by Dui in the west—
this is the soul born in Kun, dwelling in the northeast.
The po perishes in yi—this is the soul’s death.
Death and life connect without cease.
Wood three, metal four combine to make seven,
yin and yang divide into two crescents.
When metal womb and Kun unite with Qian,
envelop Qian and Kun—must be firmly sealed.

Hand-capture sun and moon to form the spirit chamber,
Kan’s palace radiates with Zhang Lihua’s brilliance.
The spirit chamber is round and bright—three, five, one.
Three, five: geng, Zhen, Dui, Qian.
Kun envelops yi and gui as yin yi,
hiding crescent, full, waning, and new moons’ palaces.
Black and white, waxing and waning—fortune or misfortune.
Fortune should be full, misfortune deficient.
When spirit and qi transform, losing rhythm,
the metal womb and spirit chamber resemble the Great Yin.
If you doubt, just observe the moon above.

Yellow and white within establish essence and soul,
po white, hun yellow—hun enters po.
Yellow becomes white, white returns to yellow,
essence black turns back, yellow turns black,
blend essence and hun to refine po’s blackness.

Scattered light reveals yellow and white,
yellow and white coalesce, their lights connecting.
Heaven’s Great Yang is born, earth’s moon is born.
The tiger inhales the dragon’s light—body becomes luminous.
Within the white metal womb, yellow gold is produced.
Yellow gold and white gold divide two and eight,
passed down through ages—dare not leak.
Tell the common folk, yet they will not believe.
If they doubt, just let them observe like Hua.

Above, there is originally one move—
recognize the medicine that births heaven, earth, and man.
Heaven-born, earth-born—also man-born.
You must ponder and seek carefully.
When found, ascend to Jade Capital,
riding phoenix and crane, you ascend.

*On the Hall of Luminous Virtue*
The Hall of Luminous Virtue has three names:
in Xia, it is called the Generational Chamber;
in Shang, the Double Chamber;
in Zhou, the Hall of Luminous Virtue.
It is the palace where the Son of Heaven enacts upright virtue,
where ministers and officials arrange hierarchy.

The Hall of Luminous Virtue venerates the Gate of the Solar Door,
establishing the Upright Yang.
From ancient times to now, those who honor true spirits
are called the Hall of Luminous Virtue.
The Yellow Emperor, on Jing Mountain,
refined the golden liquid divine elixir,
built the Chamber of Primordial Unity.
Its chamber, kindled by fire, generated yang light.
Accumulated yang becomes luminous—
also called the Hall of Luminous Virtue,
or the Azure Spirit Abode.

Responding to the images of sun and moon,
it becomes the dwelling of spirit and brightness.
Its dimensions vast, great luminosity in four directions,
spirits and gods communicate with the numinous.
Spirits are water, fire, wind, and clouds.
Water and fire return to storage—
fire stores in the abode of Li,
water returns to the land of Kan.
Wind and clouds, dragon and tiger,
west rises to meet east,
completing Xu and Wei, Tail and Winnowing Basket—
the twenty-eight constellations.
The crow falls in geng and xin,
stimulating transformation and birth.
Qi levels in the west,
water, fire, metal, wood—
mutually overcoming, mutually generating,
the five phases reverse and repeat.
Reversed, they invite misfortune;
aligned, they bring fortune.
Joy may bring great peace,
anger may spawn weapons and war, inauspicious omens,
disasters appearing instantly.

Mountains and hills,
halberds and spears—
killing qi invades the heavens,
sand flies, stones roll,
comets wander,
Venus startles the skies.
The state faces collapse and peril,
fire’s harmony is disrupted.
Thus metal and water circulate in brilliance,
dragon and tiger simmer and roar.
Such is the image of yin and yang overcoming,
mutually generating and killing.

Moreover, weapons and war
are the image of metal and fire’s stirring.
Joy stirs thunder’s roar,
thunder roars with shaking resonance.
Shaking resonance is yang brightness’s fiery dryness—
fire’s dryness harms metal,
scattering marriage and loss.
What seeks the metal liquid?
Blazing fire spreads wildly,
vainly setting below—
the dark pearl burns, fire worms hunger,
po weakens, hun flies—
then the divine elixir is far indeed!

Water must not be too abundant—
abundance lets yin invade its viscera.
Yin stands, then yang is not full.
Yang cannot overcome yin—
Jueyin drums wind,
pushing to harm and damage wood.
Damaged wood is spirit,
dragon and tiger embrace illness.
Within illness lies bing—
thus it is called disease.
Disease means sun and moon do not exchange bing,
not exchanging bing means numbers diverge from their pairs.
Yang loses its contract,
yin invades its brightness—
this is the image of yin and yang not uniting.

If yin and yang are unsettled,
then the four images do not stand,
the eight trigrams are not divided.
Moreover, whence does cinnabar arise?
Fire’s body is yin and yang,
attaining the mean of water and fire.
The two deplete the vessel, relying on victory or defeat,
on the elixir foundation’s firmness.
Thus, facing and turning avoid negligence,
embodying the two crescents,
uniting metal and water’s transformations,
giving birth to emptiness,
entrusting the medicine’s transformation.
The medicine’s transformation has returning light—
within no-thing, there is something.
Returning something is returning nothing—
nothing is nothing’s firm necessity,
something is firmness’s essence.
The two ends of being and non-being—
listen as I briefly expound.

Moreover, non-being is the qi of water, wood, metal, and earth,
the four directions concealed in emptiness.
Moreover, the Dao is stored within it!
This speaks of formless form taking shape—
where does shaped form arise?
Not grasping the principle of non-being,
dare not rashly evaluate.
Heaven and earth’s essence and spirit
must not be lightly raised.
Alas, not obtaining refinement—
can one take it? Not obtaining distinction—
how can one plan?

Moreover, being is the vessel of earth, metal, and primordial yellow.
Its vessel, receiving fire, expands—
then sets forth to summon responses.
At first, as if present, as if absent,
if present, then misty and faint,
the Dao hidden in the subtle and obscure.
Subtle, then stirred by misty vapors;
obscure, then moved by swirling clouds.
Subtle and obscure stir and move,
misty vapors and swirling clouds—bellows and pistons.
At the beginning, the foundation is laid,
omens already sprout—
the Great Yin transforms and gives birth.
Transformation is spirit’s movement,
spirit’s movement is qi’s transformation.
Congealing and accumulating form substance.
Substance, deep blue—
rosy fire flows with light.
Light’s essence condenses,
essence’s redness penetrates the po.
Red shadow arrives at dawn,
condensing into jade’s rosy clouds—
called Li’s red flakes.
Li’s red flies,
light red soars,
divine beings take flight,
five colors soaring—
soaring five colors,
the Great Yang’s azure light.

Yellow, white, black, and yellow—
yellow resides at the center,
the sovereign father, the Great Yang.
The Great Yang’s yellow Dao,
the yellow Dao turns north,
the black Dao returns in cycle,
the yellow Dao returns in cycle,
the returning yellow aligns with the pitch-pipes,
pitch and pipe mutually engender.

At winter solstice, the one Yang—
why is the day so short?
Why is the night so long?
For four nights,
the nine Yins overpower its Yang.
The Yang, though born, has not yet recovered;
the shadow’s length grows with the hour,
the time measured by the moon’s passage,
the day’s birth at winter solstice’s extreme.
Within nine days of winter solstice’s extreme,
the shadow advances by one *ke*;
five nines, five *ke* advanced, then complete—
forty-five days mark the onset of spring.

After the onset of spring, nine days pass,
within those nine days, the shadow advances by one *ke*;
five nines, five *ke* advanced, then complete—
forty-five days align with the spring equinox.
After the spring equinox, nine days pass,
within those nine days, the shadow advances by one *ke*;
five nines, five *ke* advanced, then complete—
forty-five days mark the onset of summer.

After the onset of summer, another nine days,
within those ninety days, the shadow advances by one *ke*;
five nines, five *ke* advanced, then complete—
forty-five days mark the four seasonal nodes alike.
From the onset of summer to the day’s center, sixty *ke*—
each *ke* sees the day’s shadow gradually lengthen.
The sun reaches its southern extreme;
after the summer solstice, nine days retreat,
within those nine days, the shadow retreats by one *ke*;
five nines, five *ke* retreated, then complete—
forty-five days mark the onset of autumn.

After the onset of autumn, nine days pass,
within those nine days, the shadow retreats by one *ke*;
five nines, five *ke* retreated, then complete—
forty-five days align with the autumn equinox.
After the autumn equinox, nine days pass,
within those nine days, the shadow retreats by one *ke*;
five nines, five *ke* retreated, then complete—
forty-five days mark the onset of winter.
After the onset of winter, nine days pass,
within those nine days, the shadow retreats by one *ke*;
five nines, five *ke* retreated, then complete—
the eight nodes conclude in forty-five days.

The eight nodes span three hundred sixty days,
day and night total thirty-six thousand *ke*,
thirty-six thousand *ke* of hourly reckoning.
At the hour’s reckoning, the *ke*—
at winter solstice’s midday, forty *ke*,
the day’s shadow swift as lightning’s flash,
the Great Yang’s rapid speed, its light unceasing.
Naturally, the Yang’s qi seeks concealment and storage.
Yang concealed, Yin employed without rest;
Yin born, Yang grown—sixty *ke*.
Yang’s end, qi ascends, Yang’s light emerges.

Ninefold radiance bright,
ninefold light enfolds jade-green radiance,
jade-green radiance—the divine’s revered luminosity.
Revered luminous divine yellow,
the divine ascends the Hall of Light,
the divine is called emperor-king.
The emperor-king transmits the red,
the Red Emperor bestows color,
the Azure Emperor receives virtue,
the White Emperor engenders light,
the Black Emperor’s profound yellow.
The Five Emperors blend as one,
blended divine light,
divine light lush and luxuriant,
divine power boundless.

The divine’s extremity receives rectitude,
rectifies its divine color.
The divine conceals within its chamber,
divine yellow, divine black—
yellow-black divine essence.
Yellow is the Metal Spirit,
black is the Northern Numen.
Black is water’s foundation,
inwardly cherishing its essence.
Its essence most numinous,
its essence most steadfast.

The Supreme declares:
Its essence most true,
within it lies trust—
trust that responds without fail.
That which responds to trust
is Heaven’s tally.
Heaven’s tally shines bright,
flying tally wondrously numinous.
Numinous movement subtly responds,
responding to the divine’s purple numen.
Purple numinous divine medicine,
medicine possessed of divine numinosity.
Divine medicine, numinous and spirited,
the flower of the primordial origin.

Spirit with qi and essence,
spirit ascends purple clouds,
its qi circulates and turns—
*Jia*, *Bing*, *Geng*, *Ren*.
*Geng* and *Ren* are Metal and Water in mutual fullness,
*Jia* and *Bing* are Water and Fire in flourishing abundance.
Two Fires form flame,
two Woods form forest.
Fire and Wood, bound in kinship,
sisters and brothers.
*Kan* and *Li*, *Zhen* and *Dui*—
male and female in mutual intimacy.
The male crowned with Lesser Yang,
the female coiffed with Lesser Yin.
Yin and Yang harmonize in measure,
the numbers seven and eight.

Seven and eight’s numbers complete,
nine and six mutually attain.
New moon, full moon, first quarter, last quarter—
these four span thirty days.
The numbers nine and six—
old Yang, the *Qian* father,
old Yin, the *Kun* mother,
through the mother, kinship is achieved.
Comparable to human relations,
the father governs the son,
the son governs the grandson,
generation upon generation,
kinship ever deepening.
Lead and mercury in mutual intimacy,
no different from human relations.
Yin and Yang in union,
the essence of purity.

The numinous continues its radiance,
radiance continues the numinous.
Within the radiance-numinous palace,
the tiger’s roar, the dragon’s song,
the five tones harmonize,
the six pitch-pipes’ Yang brightness.
Yang-bright divine light
illumines the Hall of Light.
The Hall of Light’s rectified virtue,
ruler and minister in harmony,
enacting benevolence, establishing righteousness,
practicing martial arts, cultivating letters.
Loyalty, trust, ritual, wisdom—
the five constants in peace.
The imperial transformation spreads beneath heaven,
enriching the state, pacifying the people.

The various celestial bodies traverse their courses,
divine qi fills the chamber.
The five qi intermingle,
the divine descends in a rushing torrent.
Qi like mist and haze,
intertwining with the divine’s governance.
The Dao of intertwining
follows the sequence of qi.
The sequence of qi without error—
dusk and dawn, cold and heat,
day’s heat, night’s cold,
Yang’s flow, Yin’s infusion.

The Palace of Vast Cold congeals water’s flourishing cinnabar,
cinnabar crystallizes, delicate as horse’s teeth.
Horse’s teeth are originally the Golden Crow’s bones,
the sun’s resplendent essence returns to the moon’s grotto.
The moon’s grotto, sunlit, becomes the white Hall of Light—
the Hall of Light is the chamber of Metal and Water.
Metal and Water mutually engender,
Metal’s moisture engenders yellow liquid.
Liquid boils in the crucible,
mercury flows as divine water,
cascading in threes,
layer upon layer,
congealing firm as solid ice.

The dragon coils, the tiger gazes,
the tiger’s nature, the dragon’s sentiment,
pursuing light, chasing brightness.
Within light, indistinct and vague;
within brightness, deep and obscure.
Cinnabar’s numinous flower,
the flower’s essence—
born of divine luminosity.
Yin’s spirit, Yang’s brightness,
accumulating Yang with Yin,
Yin with the spirit’s governance,
Yang with brightness’s governance.
Yin and Yang harmonize in measure—
the foundation of transformation and nurturance.

Transformation refers to the sun’s triple illumination,
nurturance refers to the moon’s triple movement.
Sun and moon unite their qi,
the two qi mutually propel.
Water as one, Fire as two—
united, they form three.
Three gives birth to the myriad things,
three’s transformations reach their extremity.

Three is mercury,
mercury’s transformation engenders the numinous.
The numinous flower stands alone,
a rare treasure, wondrous gem,
the five phases’ divine substance—
the medicine completed in the subtle and obscure.
If one questions the adept,
they surely cannot glimpse it.
Only those with resolve,
cherishing it, await the hour.
Attaining the true five phases’ wondrous use,
borrowing the ordinary five phases’ Water and Fire.
The five phases’ mutual generation and conquest—
such is the principle of nature.

The sage, numinous and enlightened, comprehends the transformations of Heaven and Earth—nothing more than the bending to complete the myriad things, penetrating the Dao of day and night. By day, he observes the sundial’s degrees, aligning with the celestial tally; by night, he listens to the water clock’s chimes, overseeing the *River Chart*. The moon’s phases trace their course, stars sparse in north and south; the void’s expanse below responds within the crucible. The spirit-turtle chases the fire’s pursuit, the Black Tiger floats to the White Tiger’s den, the Red Dragon leaps into the Green Dragon’s cave. The two medicines return to their origin, merging once more; cinnabar unites with Metal Elder. Mercury joins with lead, cinnabar befriends gold. Gold becomes the spirit-chamber, the Hall of Light’s true virtue; radiant and vast, the Mysterious Palace, where Qian and Kun unite as one.

Kun gives birth to Zhen’s Dragon, the Yang tally resumes its course; the Li soul enters the Po, revolving with Heaven’s display. Water spurs fire, the crucible and cauldron both resound; yin and yang revolve, Zhen receives geng and xin. Metal inherently conquers Wood—how then does it engender? The moon moves to ding’s position, Metal enters the Fire’s realm. Fire’s exuberance melts Metal, Metal supplants Wood’s flourishing; Fire extinguished becomes Earth, Earth can generate Metal, Metal can generate Water, Water can generate Wood. Conquering and engendering, they become each other’s parents. Parents beget the child, the child succeeds the parents. Kun gives birth to Zhen and Dui, Dui gives birth to Kun’s body. When the three and five qi are full, the Three Luminaries align. The Hare’s spirit generates light, the moon waxes in the east; the moon waxes then wanes, before the Yin Terrace. Sixteen govern the tally, the Yin tally resumes its course. Gen points to bing in the south; on the twenty-third day, when the three and five periods are complete, Metal enters the Water’s realm. Kun’s tally flows vast, Water returns to the north, congealing into Metal, transforming into Water.

Fire follows the moving lines, images follow man’s life—emerging and vanishing in the spirit-furnace, hidden in the recumbent moon. Nurturing the Metal embryo, transforming to generate Metal liquid, congealing like yellow butter, crumbling like golden grains. The Metal’s hue becomes translucent, shifting from yellow to red; illuminating the silk-wrapped fire, it becomes the Reverted Elixir. Opening the furnace, overturning the crucible, radiant clouds pour forth. Golden cinnabar like powder, ground fine as frost, blended and kneaded, molding yin and yang. Ninefold refined millet grains—offerings to Heaven complete—a myriad bushels of luminous pearls cannot exchange for a single grain. One grain ingested, the body sprouts wings; summoning wind and calling thunder, the ten thousand spirits attend at one’s side. Altering the four seasons, lingering with sun and moon, winter transforms to scorching summer, summer flies with frost and snow; autumn blooms with spring’s blossoms, spring scatters yellow leaves.

This is what is meant by "the cosmos in the palm of one’s hand, the ten thousand transformations born from one’s body." The Long River turns to curds, transmuting gold beyond the Northern Dipper. I dare not speak falsely—discern the existence within nothingness. From nothingness, Heaven and Earth are born; I endure as long as Heaven and Earth. This Dao is most forbidden; its secrets lie in the mouth. Revealed recklessly to the vulgar, calamity and blame will surely follow. Practice with utmost care and secrecy, and the divine spirits will protect and bless you. Cultivate abundant hidden virtue, and immortality will surely be yours.
