**Ingredients:**
Ten *liang* of pure lead, two *liang* of refined sulfur—ground together, then roasted with sand and ground again into powder. Refine with water and fire in a sealed crucible to form the elixir embryo (*dan pei*) for internal alchemy.

Two *jin* of mountain and marsh herbs, combined with two *jin* of high-quality black lead, gradually added to an ash pit for decoction until fully reduced, then pounded into fine beads.

**Divine Chamber Method:**
Eight *liang* of true gold, cast into a *Hun Dun* primordial embryo—one piece, shaped like an egg or a sphere, either form acceptable.

Additionally, one *liang* of true gold, hammered into a hollow tube (*gānzi*), its center the size of a coin’s hole, extending beyond the embryo by half an inch at each end. The tube must fit the embryo snugly—neither too wide nor too narrow.

Once the embryo is inserted and sealed, wrap the gold in red stone pitch (*chi shi zhi*), seal the seams with vinegar, and let dry.

Eight *liang* of white gold hammered into a water-sea base, embedded into the crucible’s mouth for two inches. The base aligns with the top, forming a sealed chamber, with the hollow gold tube inserted through the bottom to connect with the central chamber. Seal the mouth with pitch-clay, let dry, then introduce water.

**External Crucible:**
Made of ceramic, large enough to contain the divine chamber and two *jin* of white gold—neither too wide nor too narrow. If the interior is too spacious, line it with vinegar-mixed yellow clay and let dry.

Next, place half a handful of white gold at the base, level it, then position the gold crucible. Add more white gold, spreading it evenly to cover. Use a sheet of paper as a ring to secure the gold crucible in place, then fill the gaps with coarse white gold. Insert the silver water-sea, press the ring into place, and shake to compact. Seal tightly and suspend within the elixir furnace.

**Water-Fire Correspondence and Timing:**
Eight *liang* of water, half a *jin* of fire—adjust according to the *zi-wu* (child-midday) cycle or *mao-you* (morning-evening) shifts. After half a month, open the crucible and examine the embryo. If it glows emerald-green and luminous, it is perfected.

If it remains purple or red, continue refining with fire for seven days until it achieves the emerald-green radiance. This surpasses the exchange of *qi*—it is the true seed.

The white gold remains untouched, its weight unchanged, even if slightly diminished—this is the attainment of true *qi*.

**Further Water-Fire Soul-Stealing Method:**
One *jin* of silver, plunged into celestial-fallen water, quenched fifty times. In the water, mix three *liang* of the Three Yellows (*san huang*) into powder, absorbing the silver’s refined essence.

Use paper to filter the water until clear, then pour into a gold basin and boil to nurture the embryo. After half a day, dry the residue, roast it, and avoid copper or iron vessels—this is the purification bath.

Next, use a ceramic water-fire crucible, refining with alternating gentle and fierce flames until a liquid forms. Shape the residue into pea-sized pellets, wrap each in thick gold foil, and seal tightly.

Place two *jin* of white gold beads into the water-fire crucible, layering water above and below, and refine with circular *Kan-Li* (water-fire) movements for a month. The resulting powder is deep emerald-crimson, luminous like the moon—this is the *jin ye* (golden liquid), the essence of the Returning Elixir.

This is called *Lian Dan True Lead*.

**Alternative Method:**
First, boil the Three Yellows in water for a day, then remove them and pour in molten silver.

**Poetic Reflections:**

**Mantra of the Full Court:**
*"Jade nectar, golden salve,
Returning the embryonic essence—
All depends on *Kan-Li* alchemy.
Heaven’s soul, Earth’s shadow,
Within the golden chamber, mutually refining—
With Central Yellow divine water,
Cyclically revolving,
All phenomena converge at the Pool of Flowers.*

*Piercing Heaven, traversing Earth,
Five *qi* harmonized at the foundation.
The Mystic Pass sealed shut,
Both orifices closed—
Wood and Metal intermingle,
Refined into *Wu-Ji* (Five-Six),
Yielding the purple gold herb.*

*Nine transformations congeal—
Pure and turbid mercury-lead,
Following the twin waters’ celestial mechanism,
The elixir is born.
Lightly ascending with fire-powder,
The elixir’s gem radiates."*

**Spring in the Secret Garden:**
*"To become a transcendent,
Refine the golden liquid,
Seven returns, nine restorations.
Yet marvel at the Female returning to the Male—
The Golden Sage resides in *Kan*.
The jade furnace blazes,
The golden crucible’s smoke chills.
Lead wraps silver,
Sand refines mercury.
Divine fire questions the Pool of Flowers above and below—
The central chamber holds a single path,
Piercing straight to the Celestial Pass.*

*Dike the golden waters in cyclic exchange,
Operate the yin-fire and yang-symbols—
Not trivial.
Observe the white snow illuminating Heaven,
Yellow buds covering Earth,
Tortoise and serpent entwined,
Black Hare and White Rabbit ascending.
Since ancient times, *Kan* and *Li* in the mortal realm—
Nine transformations of simmering must expose deceit.
The omissions lie within humanity."*

**Steamer Diagram:**
*(Diagram omitted per instructions.)*

The **Steamer’s Construction and Refining Process**

Place a firepan below, its surface fully paved with flat bricks.
Craft a steamer: fifteen *cun* high, twelve *cun* in diameter.
Within, mark the four cardinal gates—*zi*, *wu*, *mao*, *you*—
and pierce five apertures at the rim to vent *qi*-fire.
Seal the steamer’s mouth with a thick brick, carving a five-*cun* round hole.
Place a furnace frame atop, twelve *cun* wide, to secure the lid—
for the passage of water and fire.
Suspend the elixir cauldron within.

**From the *Golden Flower’s Secret Essence of the Spitting Phoenix*—
White Crane Grotto’s Nurturer of the Pure, Lan Yuanbai, transmitted to
Disciple Xiyin Weng Chenyang Mengxu.
The Scripture states:

The *Taiji* is the root; the Five Phases, its function.
*Kan* and *Li* are the tortoise and hare’s elixir chambers,
while the two *qing* (passions) form the soul and spirit.
The Dragon and Tiger serve as the alchemical agents—
uniting the Three Natures as husband and wife,
birthing the *Lao* infant, forming male and female.
The sixty-four hexagrams interweave as direct symbols,
with *Lún* and *Méng* marking rebirth.
The Three Talents harmonize; the Four Symbols are the furnace,
aligned with the Five Phases, completing at *Jìwèi*.
When balanced, the Six Seasons interdepend;
when opposing, the Nine Returns cycle.
Yin and yang adhere; water and fire interpose.
Weighments must not falter; the foundation lies in myriad calculations,
yet all converges in one substance.
Transforming the myriad, it aligns with the Great Work—
uniting with the ancestral Dao, the golden elixir and spirit丹 thus perfected.

The *Hua Chi* Secret Key states:
When lead’s essence returns to mercury’s marrow, it is called *Hua Chi*.
When mercury’s waters return to the Golden Pool, it is called *Shen Shui*.
When the seven returns are complete and the nine restorations fulfilled,
and the planetary cycles nurtured, the spirit embryo sheds—
this is the secret of the Immortals, the sacred texts of antiquity.
Later scholars must not treat it lightly.

**Method of Refining Lead and Mercury**

Select bright vermilion cinnabar—ten *liang*, free of veining or impurities.
Add two *liang* of sulfur, grind to powder, and toast until they intermingle.
Smelt in a water-fire cauldron, then regrind into eight *liang*.

Take pure gold—eight *liang*—and cast into a *Hun Dun* "Chaotic Egg" cauldron.
Take one *liang* of gold, forge into a *Shuiqingzi* (water-reed) tube—
sealed at the base, four *cun* long—
and insert into the *Hun Dun*, sealing the junction.
Submerge in eight *liang* of silver *Shuihai* (water-sea),
then seal the seams with pitch and alum, drying thoroughly.
Ensure the water channel reaches the cauldron’s interior.

Next, take pure mountain ores, refine into flower-silver—two *jin*—
and mold into beads. Spread over the gold *Hun Dun*’s exterior,
then reseal the seams. Secure the vessel in a crucible,
ensuring no gaps remain. Place the silver *Shuihai* beneath,
sealing the entire structure with thick, dense clay.
After half a day of drying, place within the *Dan’ao* (elixir furnace),
igniting fires at the base and sides—five *jin* of raw charcoal—
until half the substance is consumed.
Add three *jin* of charcoal for two or three further firings.
After a day and night, the elixir’s *qi* will have passed through.

Ancient methods dictate three *jin* of charcoal—one and a half *jin* at *mao* and *you*—
without smothering the flames. Seven days are the limit,
lest the *qi* be insufficient—hence the name *Duànhún* (Severing Soul) Fire.
The silver requires no further water; only warm broths may be added,
never left parched.

---
**Severing Soul Method**

Remove the eight *liang* of elixir seed, grind finely,
and bathe in *Hua Chi* water, boiling briefly before drying.
Return to the gold cauldron, spreading as before,
resealing as prior. Boil until a paste forms.
Wrap thickly in gold foil, then take one *jin* of silver,
refined into flower-silver, ground to powder.
Spread the beads, place in the crucible,
and submerge in eight *liang* of silver *Shuihai*,
with three *Shuiqingzi* tubes inserted to the base.
Seal with pitch and alum, drying thoroughly.
Add warm broths frequently, then reseal the vessel.
Rehang in the *Dan’ao*, igniting two *jin* of charcoal.
Rotate the fires in three cycles, nurturing for seven days.
Only then does the elixir seed awaken—
now called *True Lead*.

The silver is not reused.
Next, suspend the vessel in an earthen pit,
igniting three *jin* of charcoal. When removed,
its hue is verdant green—*True Death* has been attained.

**Crucible Diagram**
**Lead and Mercury Returning to the Unfinished Diagram**

Take ten *liang* of pure cinnabar, grinding to powder.
Use only silver or gold ore; others are impure.
Take eight *liang* of pure gold, two *liang* of lotus ash,
and two *liang* of male and female substances (雄雌),
ground uniformly.
First, melt the gold into a liquid, then add the ash and substances,
stirring continuously until a yellow powder forms.
Wash with boiling water until fully purified, then dry.

Combine with the cinnabar powder, mixing thoroughly.
Place in a small, sealed stone pomegranate jar—
nine-tenths full—then seal with rice husk ash,
piercing with copper coins and binding with silk in a cross.
Invert into a wide-mouthed, deep water jar,
aligning the mouths and securing them.
Suspend in the *Dan’ao*, igniting one *jin* of charcoal above,
two *liang* within the furnace.
Repeat three times, then ignite three *jin* above,
allowing the lead and mercury to fully transmute.
The water below collects as *Hua Chi* water.
Boil and dry the gold, stirring once per cycle.
Repeat with ten *liang* of cinnabar and mercury,
then combine with the gold and dry the mercury—
awaiting the *True Lead* seed for elixir fusion.

**Method of Mating the Embryo with Mercury**

**Method of Mating the Embryo with Mercury**

For each *True Lead* seed of eight *liang* as powder,
take eight *liang* of purified *True Mercury*,
and place them together in a **mortar** (*rǔbēi*)
while seated upon a **steaming vessel** (*tāngguàn*) of boiling water,
settling firmly.
The two substances—*True Lead* and *True Mercury*—
must be repeatedly ground with force until finely pulverized.

Drip a few drops of *Hua Chi* water
into the white powder daily,
one day as the measure,
this called **Embryo Formation** (*jié tāi*).

Test with fire—if it does not move,
place it into a **inverted crescent-moon furnace** (*yǎn yuè fǎ xiàng dǐng*)
and apply **water-fire** (*yǔnhuǒ*) for half a month.

Increase the grinding as before,
adding purified *True Mercury* until reaching three *jin* of mercury.

Afterward, take only *Red Mercury* (*Zhū Gōng*),
boiled with *Hua Chi* water,
and add it in.

Later, when the process is prolonged,
it is unnecessary to boil the mercury—
it will naturally become true.

**First Phase of Great Return: Refining the Yellow Embryo and Furnace**
The sequence is: four *liang*, five *liang*,
six *liang*, seven *liang* and a half,
nine *liang* and a half—
totaling three *jin*.

Take eight *liang* of **refined gold** (*Zhú sè zhēnjīn*),
condense into a liquid,
and add two *liang* of **clear sulfur** (*Míng liú*),
half *liang* of **male sulfur** (*xióng*),
and half *liang* of **female sulfur** (*cí*).
Stir-fry into a powder,
then refine in the **water-fire furnace** (*shuǐhuǒ dǐngzào*)
until uniformly colored.
Shape into a **hollow, double-layered basin** (*jiākōng xīn wǎnzi*)
like the form of an **inverted moon** (*yǎngyuè*).

Within the basin’s hollow center,
leave an opening of about one *cùn*,
ensuring the layers do not touch.

Pierce the upper basin’s center,
and insert a **goldwater tube** (*jīnshuǐ wànzi*).
Place it upright,
then immerse into eight *liang* of **silverwater sea** (*yínshuǐ hǎi*).

Again, use **ash-glauberite** (*zhīfàn*)
to seal it dry,
then immerse directly into the **inverted moon** (*yǎn yuè*).
Return the previously processed *True Lead* and *True Mercury* of one *jin*
into the **inverted moon furnace** (*yǎn yuè lú*).

Outside, use a **fixed outer vessel** (*wǎnguàn*) of one *jin*,
seal the mouth with **outer fixed cement** (*wàigù kǒufèng*),
and bind with iron wire.
Suspend it into the **elixir furnace** (*dāntāng*).
Apply fire on all four sides,
and at the base,
from eight *liang* to one *jin*.
Adjust the fire at **cox** (*mǎo*) and **yáng** (*yǒu*) times,
then reduce after half a month,
maintaining five *liang* of fire for three days.
Open and close the furnace three times—
the *True Lead* and *True Mercury* will truly transmute.

Remove it,
then boil again with *Hua Chi* water.
Refine in the **water-fire furnace** once more,
forming a liquid,
and repeat as the **husband**.

Again, take five *liang* of purified *True Mercury*,
and grind as initially upon boiling water.
Place it back into the **inverted moon furnace** (*yǎn yuè lú dǐng*),
applying **water-fire** (*yǔnhuǒ*) for half a month,
until completion.
Boil it again as before,
pouring the liquid repeatedly.
Add until three *jin* of mercury are refined—
all will become the **precious treasure**.

If the **Yellow Embryo** (*Huáng Yá*)
has not yet been subdued by fire,
continue applying **water-fire** (*yǔnhuǒ*)
until it is fully refined.
Nurture until it reaches a **golden-yellow soil color** (*Huángtǔ sè jīnróng*),
the true **steel meridian** (*Zhēn xī*).

**Great Return Phase Begins Here—**
take much of the **Yellow Embryo** (*Huáng Yá*),
replacing the **inverted moon furnace’s** (*yǎn yuè*) **basin** (*hézi*).

This method should be kept secret.

---

**Second Phase of Great Return: Refining the Primordial Spirit (Mixed-Essence) Godlike Elixir and Furnace**

Take ten *liang* of **cinnabar** (*Chénshā*),
five *liang* of **male and female sulfur** (*xióngcí yīng*),
and one *liang* of **clear sulfur** (*Míng liú*),
as powder.
Refine in the **water-fire furnace** (*shuǐhuǒ dǐng*) until forming **six elixirs** (*liùzǐ*).
Measure about one *jin* of **elixir residue** (*liùzǐ*).

First, boil with *Hua Chi* water for one day.
Next, use ten *liang* of **refined gold** (*Zhú sè huángjīn*)
to shape a **basin** (*bǎnhézi*),
containing the previous **fifty *liang* of elixir embryo** (*dāngāo*).
Within, place one *jin* of **cinnabar elixir residue** (*Zhū Dān liùzǐ*).
Outside, use **golden-yellow soil** (*Huángtǔ*)
to seal the basin,
and embed it into the **golden basin** (*jīnhézi*).

Next, use six *liang* of gold
to craft a **water ring** (*shuǐhuán*),
or use the **Yellow Embryo** material for this as well.
Measure the **height of the cinnabar elixir residue** (*liùzǐ*)
and the **depth of the basin** (*hézi*)
to determine the size of the **water ring**.

Arrange the **elixir embryo** (*yázi*)
above and below,
covering the **water ring**’s surface evenly.
Insert a **silverwater tube** (*yínshuǐ wǎn*)
into the center,
reaching the **ash layer** (*huīzhōng*).
Pierce through the **basin’s surface** (*hé gài zhī miàn*),
and place a **water bucket** (*shuǐdǒu*) above.
Seal the mouth with **ash-glauberite** (*zhīfàn*)
until it is dry,
ensuring no leakage of water.

Once fully sealed and dry,
suspend it into the **elixir furnace** (*dāntāng*).
Apply fire above at eight *liang* for five days.
Apply fire below at five *liang* for five days.
Increase fire above to ten *liang* for five days.
Reduce fire below to eight *liang* for five days.
Increase fire above to twelve *liang* for five days.
Reduce fire below to ten *liang* for five days.

Remove it—
the elixir will be **water-worn** (*shuǐhào*).
Add **boiling water** (*tāng*)
frequently without letting it dry out.
For every **two *qiǎn* and a half** (*liǎng*),
boil five *liang* of mercury refined with *Hua Chi* water,
until it becomes **superior yellow gold** (*shàng sè huángjīn*).

An alternative method:
After equalizing the fire above and below,
remove it into a **ground pit** (*dìkēng*).
Apply fire at ten *jin* in one **burning cycle** (*yīhuǐ*),
allowing the fire to naturally consume itself.
Frequently add **warm water** (*wēntāng*),
and take the elixir as before.
Use this for two months,
with fire adjustments the same.

---

**Third Phase of Great Return: Refining the Elixir that Pierces Heaven and Earth and Its Furnace**

Take the previous **eight *liang* of cinnabar elixir** (*Zhū Dān*),
add eight *liang* of **sulfur-refined stone cinnabar** (*liú shéng guò shídānshā*),
and half *liang* of **male sulfur** (*xióng yīng*),
grinding them evenly together.

Use ten *liang* of **mercury-gold** (*Gōngjīn*)
to form a **double-layered well ring** (*jiājǐng kuàng*),
with four sides and a base,
hollow like a well,
and a single hole at the top.
Insert a **goldwater tube** (*jīnshuǐ wàn*)
into the well,
reaching the **water sea** (*shuǐ hǎi*).

Within the **water sea**,
also use a **hollow water tube** (*xūshuǐ zān*),
piercing into the **central well** (*zhōnggōng jǐng*)
until it reaches the **basin’s bottom** (*hé dǐ*).

The **golden basin** (*jīnhé*)
is five *cùn* high,
with a diameter of four *cùn*,
and must be **wide** (*kuàngrù*).
The **well** (*jǐng*) is four *cùn* high,
with a diameter of three *cùn*,
and use **golden-yellow soil** (*Huángtǔ*)
and **Yellow Embryo** (*Huáng Yá*) powder
to cover the well’s interior.

One *jin* of **cinnabar elixir** (*Zhū Dān*)
is pounded into pieces the size of **chessmen** (*qízǐ*).

Outside, use a **furnace vessel** (*wèng dǐng qì*)
of ten *liang* of gold,
or craft an **outer furnace** (*wàidǐng*) from **golden-yellow soil** (*Huángtǔ*).

Embed the **golden basin** (*jīnhé*) into the hollow space,
filling it with one *jin* of **golden-yellow soil** (*Huángtǔ*) and **Yellow Embryo** (*Huáng Yá*) powder.
Seal below with two **silverwater tubes** (*yínshuǐ wǎn*),
then tightly seal and suspend into the **elixir furnace** (*dāntāng*).

Apply **three-directional fire** (*sānfāng huǒ*),
shifting between **cox** (*mǎo*) and **yáng** (*yǒu*) times,
each at eight *liang*,
until reaching ten *liang*,
then increase to one *jin* as the final measure.
Cease the fire.

Apply this **water-fire** (*yǔnhuǒ*) process
for three months,
with daily adjustments,
adding ten *jin* of fire twice.

In the **ground pit** (*dìkēng*),
apply fire on all four sides
and at the base,
until it glows **deep red** (*tōnghóng*).
Frequently add **boiling water** (*tāng*),

Remove the furnace’s **Jūdān** in cold,
weighing half a *liang*—**dry mercury** (*gāngóng*) five *jin*—
both refined as **purple powder** (*zǐmó*).

Again use **Three Yellows** and **silverwater** (*yínshuǐ*),
boiling the mercury to form its essence.

**Fourth Return of the Elixir: Three Talents Transformation Elixir and Furnace Diagram**
To the right: **Third Return’s Vermilion Male Elixir** (*Jūxióng Dān*), one *jin*,
ground into a paste.

Take **vermilion-mercury** (*zhūgōng*) four *jin*,
add **Male Essence** (*Xióngyīng*) four *liang*,
grind uniformly, then refine with gentle fire
until it turns **purple**—**dead mercury** (*sǐgōng*).

Now cast **three *jin* of golden sand and Yellow Embryo** (*Huáng Yá*)
into a furnace (*dǐng*), one *shì* two *cùn* high,
four *cùn* in diameter.
Inside, place **ten *liang* of mercury-gold** (*jīngōng*)
in two rings.

The **water pool** (*shuǐchí*) uses five *liang*,
with matching dimensions.
The lower ring is one *cùn* two *fēn* high,
three *cùn* five *fēn* in diameter,
flat-bottomed with no holes,
but a central aperture at the top
where a **golden water tube** (*jīnshuǐwǎn*) is inserted and sealed.
The tube extends five or six *cùn* downward.

The upper ring’s aperture aligns with the lower ring’s top.
Its central hole connects to the **silverwater basin** (*yínshuǐhǎi*)
via a water tube, sealing the base.
Water flows into the lower ring’s bottom
without leaking outward.
The upper ring sits one *cùn* five *fēn* above the basin.

Between the two rings, place the **five *jin* of prior elixir**,
then wrap the **golden furnace** (*Yá Dǐng*) in **silver foil**,
and finally encase it in **Yellow Embryo clay** (*Huáng Yá* method),
thickening to two *zhǐ* for firmness.

A **one-*jin* silverwater basin** is shaped deep and wide,
embedded around the furnace’s mouth,
secured with iron wire,
and suspended in the **elixir furnace** (*Dāntāng*).
Fire is applied on all sides—**three *jin* total**—
with **cox** (*mǎo*) and **yǒu** (*yǒu*) adjustments.
Refine thus for three months.

Remove and hang in the **ground pit** (*dìkēng*),
applying **thirty *jin* of fire** in three stages,
letting it consume freely,
while frequently replenishing with **boiling water** (*tāng*).

When cold, the elixir glows like **vermilion tangerine**,
its **purple powder** (*zǐmó*) luminous and gathered—
mix with **five *liang* of mercury**,
forming the **Great Medicine** (*Dàyào*), radiant as **purple gold**.

**Method for Ingesting the Elixir:**
In seclusion, draw water from a quiet well,
seal the elixir in a **golden basin** (*jīnhé*),
wrap in cotton, and suspend it in the well for three months.
Steam in **mung bean broth** for five days and nights,
then boil in **licorice decoction** for one day,
and refine for three days and nights into **light, fine powder** (*qīngchén*).

Roll into pills with **reed rhizome jelly** (*Huángjīng gāozi*),
three hundred sixty pills per *liang*.
Morning and evening, swallow one pill
with fresh-drawn well water or **ginseng decoction**.
Avoid **five pungent spices**, **mutton blood**, and impure substances.
Do not reveal this to others.

After completion, one’s vision spans ten thousand *lǐ*,
hearing reaches the **Nine Heavens** (*Jiǔxiāo*),
the body grows light, youth preserved—
thus attaining **Earthly Immortality** (*Dìxiān*).

**Fifth Return of the Elixir: Three Pure Supreme Treasure Elixir and Furnace Diagram**
Take the **nine *jin* of dry mercury-gold** (*gāngóngjīn*)
from the Fourth Return,
cast into an **Outer Divine Chamber Furnace** (*Shénshì Wàidǐng*), one *shì* five *cùn* high,
five *cùn* in diameter.

Cast a **water basin** (*shuǐhǎi*) atop, one *jin* in weight,
also of mercury-gold, five *cùn* deep,
matching the furnace’s width,
and embed it.

Fashion an **Inner Divine Chamber** (*Shénshì Nèishì*)
from **golden sand and Yellow Embryo**,
shaped like an egg, with three legs,
each one *cùn* five *fēn* high.
The chamber is nine *cùn* tall,
three *cùn* five *fēn* wide.

Replicate the **water conduction method** (*tōngshuǐ fǎ*)
to form the **Yellow Embryo** (*Huáng Yá*), three *jin* in weight,
and refine this chamber.

The chamber’s top has a hollow lid
with a water tube piercing through.

The **Divine Chamber** holds up to five *jin* of medicine.
The **elixir** uses **five *jin* of True Mercury** (*Chén Gōng*),
first mixed with **Male Essence** (*Xióngyīng*) eight *liang*,
**sulfur** (*liúhuáng*) eight *liang*,
and refined uniformly.
Boil with **Divine Water** (*Shén Shuǐ*) half a day,
dry, and pound into **six blocks** (*lùkuài*) in a **water-fire furnace** (*shuǐhuǒ dǐng*).
Crush into powder.

Fill the **Yellow Embryo Divine Chamber** with the elixir,
insert the water tube, and seal with the **hollow water lid**.
The lid’s tube connects to the **golden water basin**,
all sealed with **fat alum** (*zhīfàn*).
Fill with **most refined clear water** (*ruìqīngshuǐ*) in the basin.

Encase the **Outer Furnace** in **Six-to-One clay** (*liùyī ní*),
thickening to two *zhǐ* around its entire body,
secure with iron wire,
and suspend in the **elixir furnace**.

Open the **three directional gates** (*sānfāng mén*)—**Leac, Midday, and Dog** (*yínwǔxū*)—
applying fire according to time and direction:
three *jin* per direction, two gates for exhausting *qi*.
Apply fire three times daily, replenishing three *jin* each,
shifting through **Leac, Midday, and Dog** for sixty days.

Remove and hang in the **ground pit**,
sitting on ashes, with **forty-five *jin* of fire** in three stages,
letting it consume freely,
while frequently adding **warm water** (*wēntāng*).

When cold, the elixir shimmers with **purple cloud radiance** (*zǐxiá guāngsè*),
its divine luster like the **sun and moon**.
Each **character-point** (*yīzì diǎn*) yields five *liang* of **purple gold**—
one *zì* thus produces five *liang* of **Upper World Celestial Treasure** (*Shàngshì Tiānbǎo*).
It can further transmute **five *liang* of silver** into gold.

Above the **Inner Chamber**, a **purple powder fine dust** (*zǐfěn qīngchén*)
settles on the lid—collect this in a **golden basin**,
for it is the **body of the Great Elixir** (*Dà Dān zhītǐ*).
Do not use lightly; reserve for the **Nine Returns Elixir** (*Jiǔzhuàn Huándān*).

**Sixth Return of the Elixir: Yin-Yang Harmony Elixir and Furnace Diagram**
Take the **nine *jin* of condensed, water-fire-refined essence** from the Fifth Return,
cast into an **Outer Furnace** one *shì* two *cùn* high—
as before—four *cùn* in diameter.

Wrap the furnace in **golden foil** (*jīnpí*) as an outer lining.

Next, cast **two *jin* of dry mercury-purple gold** (*gāngóng zǐjīn*)
into a **Divine Chamber** (*Shénshì*), egg-shaped,
seven *cùn* tall, three *cùn* five *fēn* wide.

Inside, place the **accumulated fine dust** (*jīxià qīngchén*) eight *liang*,
mixed with **refined vermilion-mercury** (*bīguò zhūgōng*) one *jin*,
and **flying Male Essence** (*fēiyīng*) four *liang*,
ground until no stars remain—
then place it into the **Divine Chamber** and seal.

**Sixth Return: Yin-Yang Harmony Elixir and Furnace Diagram (continued)**

Seal the **Divine Chamber** with **golden sand and sulfur powder**, filling it level and smooth. At its base, forge a **golden disk** eight *liang* in weight, three *cùn* five *fēn* in diameter, and place it within the **Divine Chamber’s foundation**, rising three *cùn* five *fēn* high. On either side, drill holes to insert **golden water tubes** (*jīnshuǐguàn*) up to the **Divine Chamber’s** apex, sealing the surface as one. These tubes connect directly to the **golden water sea** beneath, which holds one *jin* of gold. The tubes encase the **Divine Chamber**, then fill the exterior with **golden sand and sulfur powder**, leveling it solid so no trace of the chamber remains visible.

Wrap the **Outer Furnace** in **refined yellow earth**, two *fēn* thick, and dry it thoroughly. Then place the **water sea** inside, reseal, and suspend it in the **Elixir Tortoise** (*Dānyuán*). Apply **water-fire talismans**, waiting two months. At the **coxial hours (coxial)** and **acid hours (acid)**, replenish the fire in three directions, three *jin* each, until the day’s quota is complete. Extract the elixir and place it in an earthen pit, applying fifty *jin* of fire in three stages, replenishing with warm water as the water evaporates.

When the furnace cools, the **dry mercury** will have transformed into **purple-gold liquid snow**. For every ten *liang* of **dry mercury**, produce **celestial treasure of the highest antiquity**. Each *liang* of gold can transmute two or three *liang* of worldly silver into gold. Beneath the **water sea** and **Divine Chamber**, **purple qi-liquid snow** ascends—collect this in a **golden vessel**; it is the **Great Elixir**.

**Seventh Return: Five Peaks Communing with the Mysterious Elixir and Furnace Diagram**
Take the **condensed essence** from the **Sixth Return’s Divine Chamber**, along with the **previously refined furnace essence**, and refine them together into a liquid with **purple divine radiance**.

Add **sulfur essence** (*huángyīng*) dropwise—nine *jin* to sixteen *jin*—to form the furnace. Pour this into an **earthen mold**, shaping it into the **highlands and lowlands of the Five Peaks**.

Boil five *jin* of **refined cinnabar-mercury** in **divine water**, then pour it onto the **Elixir Foundation**, placing it within a **three-*jin* golden chaos vessel**. Cover with **powder from the Sixth Return’s elixir**, seal with **pharmaceutical clay**, embed in a **golden vessel**, and reseal. Apply **water above, fire below**, suspend in the **Elixir Tortoise**, and burn five *jin* of fire daily, allowing it to consume freely. When the water evaporates, replenish with warm broth. The next day, repeat with five *jin* of fire—neither increasing nor decreasing—until two months have passed.

Remove the **golden yang cover**, replacing it with the **golden water sea** from within, sealing the seams and reinforcing the exterior with iron wire. Suspend it again in the **Elixir Furnace** for another month, burning one *jin* in each of the three directions, alternating at **coxial and acid hours**.

When the day’s quota is complete, remove it and hang it in an earthen pit, immersing it in water above and below. Apply thirty *jin* of fire in one stage, then twenty *jin* in another, allowing the fire to consume freely. Upon removal, the **golden vessel** will contain **golden silkworms and jade shoots**, or forms resembling **lions, elephants, oxen, horses**, or **valiant generals**—each shaped by the **celestial influences of the day, hour, and star**, the **heroic qi of Heaven and Earth**, and the **refined essence of yin-yang**. For every ten *liang* of **dry mercury**, produce **celestial treasure of the highest antiquity**. Each *liang* of gold can transmute five *liang* of worldly silver into **great elixir gold**.

Beneath the **water sea**, **five-colored auspicious clouds** ascend—this is the **light, refined essence of the elixir’s spiritual qi**, collected in the **golden chamber** and nurtured by **water-fire tempering**, awaiting use in the **Great Elixir**.

**Eighth Return: Supreme Ultimate Return Elixir and Furnace Diagram**
Take five *jin* of **cinnabar-mercury**, add one *jin* of **flying sulfur essence** (*sānhuáng fēiyīng*), and refine it in a **water-fire furnace** into **elixir cinnabar**. Boil this in **divine water**, then grind it with five *jin* of **powder from the Seventh Return’s jade shoots and golden silkworms**.

Add five *jin* of **cinnabar elixir**. Then, take the **golden sand and sulfur essence elixir**—sixteen *jin*—from the **Seventh Return’s Divine Chamber**, and mix it evenly. Cast this in a **great fire** into a **furnace vessel** shaped like **Chaos**, two *shì* high, with a diameter of eight *cùn*.

Wrap the exterior with five *jin* of **pharmaceutical gold**, ensuring a tight seal. Forge an **empty golden sphere** eight *liang* in weight, three *cùn* in height and diameter, with two **water tubes** (*shuǐguàn*), two *liang* each, at either end. The tubes have a base below and an opening above, piercing through the **elixir furnace**. On the furnace’s surface, arrange **water buckets** to circulate warm water into the hollow space, filling the sides with the previous ten *jin* of medicine until half-full. Seal with a **medicine cover**, secure with iron wire, and wrap the exterior in **refined yellow earth**, two *fēn* thick, drying it thoroughly. Bind with iron wire and suspend it in the **Divine Tortoise**.

First, apply one *jin* of **furnace fire**, alternating at **coxial and acid hours** for five days. Then, add ten *liang* of **base fire** for another five days. Return to one *jin* of **furnace fire** for five days, then add ten *liang* of **base fire** again for five days. Replenish evaporated water with warm broth, ensuring none spills outward—use the **water buckets** for this. Continue this cycle—one *jin* of **furnace fire**, ten *liang* of **base fire**—for three months. When complete, remove it to an earthen pit, apply fifty *jin* of fire in three stages, and replenish with warm water as the fire consumes.

When the furnace cools, the elixir will be a **golden paste**, emitting a **purple radiance** that dazzles the eyes, with a taste **sweet as honey**. The **great medicine is now ripe**. One *liang* can transmute one *jin* of **dry mercury** into **purple great gold**. One *liang* of this elixir can also transmute ten *liang* of silver into **great elixir gold**, or ten *liang* of **dry mercury** into gold. Additionally, **flying golden frost-liquid snow** will appear—this is the **Great Return Elixir**.

**Ninth Return: Golden Liquid Great Return Elixir and Furnace Diagram**
Take fifty *liang* of the **purple-gold elixir** from the previous return, casting it into a **Divine Chamber** seven *cùn* high, five *cùn* in diameter, with a sealed top. Wrap the exterior with twenty-four *jin* of **refined sulfur-gold essence**, forging a furnace one *shì* five *cùn* high, nine *cùn* in diameter.

Take fifty *liang* of the **purple-gold elixir** from the inner furnace, casting it into five **pillars**—the central one four *cùn* low, two *cùn* half high—erected to support the **Divine Chamber**.

Next, take one *jīn* of the **still elixir’s golden essence**, casting it into a **pointed-bottom water furnace** that can cover the golden furnace’s exterior. The pointed bottom must be straight and inserted into the **Chaos Chamber**, sealing it as in the initial stages of elixir refinement.

Then, apply the **residue of the Eighth Return Elixir**—the **golden salve**—as a covering outside the **Chaos Chamber**. Within the **Chaos Chamber**, place one *jīn* of **large cinnabar blocks**, boiled in **Divine Water**. Afterward, use **long-stored cinnabar powder**, regardless of quantity, to spread and fill the chamber. Alternatively, mix dust with finely ground **cinnabar and mercury** to also produce the **Great Return Elixir**.

Once sealed, place the **Golden Furnace of Water Sea** beneath, inserting and tightly sealing the cracks. Secure the exterior with eighty-one *dǎi liǎng* of **yellow clay**, kneaded with **sal ammoniac, alum, paper fibers**, and other binding agents until firm. The outer furnace’s thickness should be one *zhǐ* half or two *zhǐ* wide. Bind it with sturdy iron wires and suspend it with iron chains inside a **three-tiered Law-Image Divine Furnace**, positioned before the altar. Maintain **incense and flame** day and night, set up a **leakage mechanism**, and regulate **water-fire cycles** according to the **Eight Trigrams and Sixteen Hexagrams**, opening and closing the **Eight Gates**, alternating **fire below and water above**, drawing, adding, and shifting them as needed. Afterward, follow the **weighted measures** to complete the **Great Heavenly Water-Fire Cycle** in one year.

Cover the **three-tiered furnace** with a protective enclosure, ensuring no one enters. The following year, remove the furnace from the underground pit, perform **ritual offerings and oaths to the Celestial Sovereign**, and avoid **Water Sea** contamination.

Then, introduce **water into the furnace**, igniting **four surrounding fires** of thirty-six *liang* each for three cycles of ascent.

Thus, for nine days, when the final moment arrives, purify the ashes and place them in the **cold furnace** for three nights. The elixir obtained will be **radiant jade-like**, **purple-gold salve**, or **emerald elixir**, its brilliance surpassing the sun.

Divide it into three portions: one to **offer to Heaven** for blessings, one to **save and aid the poor**, and one for **refining and liberating the spirits of the netherworlds**. Bury any remaining elixir, soak it in water for a hundred days to **steam out its poisons**, then roll it into pills—eighty-one grains per portion—using **yellow essence salve** for binding. Consume one portion annually.

Finally, perform the **Grand Ritual Offering** to the **Three Realms of Deities**, swear oaths to the **Three Pure Ones of Heaven**, the **Three Officials and Nine Ministries**, the **ancestral masters of alchemical Daoists**, and the **local deities of the Nine Provinces**. This is done in anticipation of the **ascension**.

**The Great Elixir’s Water-Fire Cycle**
Commence the fire from **Winter Solstice** on the auspicious day of the **eleventh month**, increasing by one *liang* each day for thirty days until reaching the **ninth month**, then decrease it completely. Before **Established Winter** (立冬), cease the **water-fire cycles** for nine days.

At this time, select an **auspicious location and day**, establish the altar, and install the furnace. Choose a **south-facing site** with **scenic mountains and waters**, free from human activity, and avoid places with **carrion, graves, or foul qi** from poultry and feline beasts. Purify your mind with **fasting and abstinence**, shun worldly toil, and focus your heart and will on **tending the fire and observing the cycles**. Do not let your thoughts wander to **fame, profit, or sensual desires**. Ideally, three like-minded individuals should join in this endeavor.

These **fire-water cycles** are the sacred methods of the **Immortal Daoists**, not to be revealed to the vulgar.

For the **elixir of one *jīn*** (one *jīn* of medicine), **one *jīn* of fire** is required, and **three hundred eighty-four *chǐ*** (one *jīn*) of water is also needed.

Each **yang line** of fire requires two *liang*, each **yin line** of water requires two *liang* and a half. Six lines together yield **fifteen *liang***—the measure of one *jīn*.

**The Heavenly Male (乾) uses nine**, the **Earthly Female (坤) uses six**, totaling **fifteen *liang*** once again.
