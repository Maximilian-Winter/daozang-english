### *The Elbow-Pocket Formula for Cyclically Transmuted Cinnabar, Volume One*

The *Elbow-Pocket Formula* was composed by the Perfected Master Ge of Zhichuan. Originally in ten volumes—nine of which expound upon the world’s medical texts and herbal remedies for healing—the tenth distinguishes the authenticity of metallic minerals, great elixirs, and the Yellow Sprout, clarifying the firing times with crystalline precision. It was written to serve as a model for future scholars, preventing errors. Whoever obtains this formula has already grasped half of the great elixir’s gate.

I possess oral instructions, yet they are not burdensome to the mind. Thus, the utmost truth is conveyed with intent, guiding the benighted so that all may attain immortality. Later scholars must study this carefully.

**The Formula states:**
The treasure elixir originates from the One, which generates the Two. The Two generates Fire, lodged in *bing*-*ding*, born of *jia*-*yi*. At the *ninth-initial*, the Hidden Dragon stirs as the solitary Yang arises. The *jianzi* celestial tally aligns, releasing and concealing in shock and trepidation, receiving the Black from the Mother—Mother being Earth.

The Dao generates the One, the One generates the Two, the Two generates the Three. The Three are the parents of Yang; Yang is the essence of Heaven and Earth. Thus, the Three, Five, and One form the foundation of cyclically transmuted cinnabar.

The celestial tally is called *Trust*. The Sun is the primordial essence of Heaven and Earth, the first illumination of the Five Phases. Years are reckoned by months, months by days, days by hours, and hours by years—thus measuring distance and discerning sameness and difference.

When primordial chaos first divided, the essence and Black of Yin and Yang emerged. The Dipper’s handle marks the twelve branches, shifting and revolving without cease. The clepsydra’s drip never halts; release and intermingling give birth to the myriad things, shaping their forms.

The celestial tally is *Trust*—capable of release, enabling the myriad things to take form. Movement returns to the root, condensing into essence. The Yin Black stealthily circulates, congealing and transforming into essence. Essence transforms into cinnabar, its color endowed by the southern *bing*-*ding* Fire—externally Yang, internally Yin—ruling man, the Sun, and the Yang soul. The radiance of the Sun and Moon’s essence and Black shines as one, illuminating Heaven and Earth.

The Great Yang and Great Yin Blacks harmonize in the center, exchanging and receiving for 1,080 years, condensing essence into cinnabar. Another 1,080 years under the celestial tally’s illumination completes its form, named *Cinnabar*. Mercury is born within cinnabar—Yang within Yin—called the *Great Yang Vermilion Bird*, ruling Water.

When the primordial harmony’s Black is insufficient, it is called *Cinnabar Sand*, also known as *Celestial Lead*, *Male Dragon*, or *Female Blood*. Transforming south into north, extracting the vermilion, it becomes Yin Mercury, ruling Water, numbered One—thus Mercury is said to be the Yang minister.

*Celestial Lead* is divine water. The celestial tally’s movement illuminates cinnabar, nurturing it for another 1,080 years. Heavenly Fire’s transformation fills the Yang Black, while the Yin Black wanes. Yang flourishes to fullness, overflowing in brilliance, naturally generating color—endowed by the northern *ren*-*gui* Water, externally Yin and internally Yang—ruling the Moon’s Yin spirit. It is no common worldly substance, for within red stone, it spontaneously generates, flowing as Yang Mercury. Named the *Essence of Celestial Lead*, the *Ancestor of the Yellow Sprout*, it is the essence and radiance of the Sun and Moon, transformed into natural cyclically transmuted cinnabar. Naturally subduing Fire, its Black color shifts from north to west, ruling Metal, numbered Four—the foundation of Water.

Thus, the Three, Five, and One are the utmost essence of Heaven and Earth. The Three are the parents of Fire; the Five, the parents of cinnabar; the One, the primordial ancestor of cinnabar. Revolving and circulating, essence and primordial harmony interact to form shape, never straying from the One. The One is the root and origin of the Great Dao—Water.

Scholars fail to recognize that cinnabar is Lead, and the child born within Lead is Gold. A single entity of Yin and Yang self-circulates, self-regulates. Yang within Yin, Yin within Yang, Mystery within Mystery—called the *Mysterious Warrior Stone*. Transforming Water into Gold, it is thus named *Cinnabar*. Born within the Yin of Metal, it is the sovereign, named *Lead-Gold*.

The celestial tally’s movement, over 4,320 years, illuminates its parents, nurturing *Celestial Lead* into natural cyclically transmuted cinnabar.

**The Formula states:**
Later sages used Fire to illustrate the hexagrams. A month comprises 360 hours; a year’s climatic phases total 4,320 hours—matching the natural cyclically transmuted cinnabar, named *Cinnabar Mercury*, the Water within Gold. Water to the north, Fire to the south; Dragon to the east, Tiger to the west. The Five Phases unite in one body, returning to the undivided Five. By aligning with the earthly tally and adhering to the seasonal nodes’ movement, the Golden Elixir is achieved.

**The Formula states:**
This cinnabar emerges within the Central Hua, in the twelfth terrestrial division’s second palace—the southwest *kun* region. This treasure is the utmost essence of Heaven and Earth, the correct Black of primordial harmony. Through the Sun, Moon, and celestial tally’s movement, intermingling occurs in the Five. The Five are *wu*-*ji*, the central palace’s Earth.

The places where it is born—auspicious mountains and ridges, lands of favorable terrain—possess the Qi, Blood, Bones, and Flesh of Metal, with Water and Wood both flourishing. Where bones and flesh are complete, grasses and trees thrive, soil and stone are firm and steadfast—such extraordinary realms are guarded by divine spirits. The Yin and Yang Blacks release and nurture, containing and gestating, illuminating essence and Black. Born of Earth, it transforms into cinnabar.

Wherever cinnabar is found, after the first clear dawn or in dim light, radiance appears like the rising Sun—now hidden, now visible—discernible only to skilled miners. The places where it emerges are called *Cinnabar*, also named *Vermilion Sand*.

*Cinnabar*, *Vermilion Lead*, *Celestial Lead*, *Fire Lead*, *Gold within Lead*, *Divine Water Flower Pool*, *Yin Mercury*, *Yang Mercury*, *Quicksilver*, *Yang within Yin*, *Yin within Yang*, *Five-Colored Stone*, *Five Metals*, *Lord of the Seven Treasures*, *Cyclically Transmuted Cinnabar*, *Heaven-Born Yellow Sprout*—the origin of the Five Phases.

The regions known as *Guifu*, *Chenjin*, *Hengqiu*, *Joulou*, *Yunmeng*, *Dushan*, *Bangyong*, *Quandao*, *Tanyue*, and their governed lands—where cliffs, rocky caverns, and lush terrain abound—host both new and ancient mines. Within these, cinnabar of varying grades appears, its luminous surface smooth as a mirror, resembling lotus blossoms or hibiscus, vibrant red and translucent, all deemed top-tier. The middle and lower grades, too numerous to list, may still yield mercury for refinement and other uses, though they are unfit for the supreme elixir of great alchemy.

Top-grade cinnabar is like a sovereign ascending the throne, with all officials in attendance. The middle grade resembles a renowned minister, while the lower grade is akin to common folk—serviceable, yet lacking independent mastery.

The celestial tally is the Sun, the essence and spirit of Yang, the principle of Heaven, radiating brilliance. *Huainanzi* states: "The gathering of Yang’s *qi* forms fire; the essence of fire is the Sun, whose pure, crystalline light embodies its meaning." It further says: "The Sun is born of *jia*, the position of double Yang. Fire arises from *zhen*, *zhen* being the eldest son, *xun* the eldest daughter—the parents of fire." Fire is called *zeng*, wood *qing*; all things are governed by them, hence the term *zengqing*.

The Moon is the essence and soul of Yin, the principle of Earth, casting its glow. *Huainanzi* says: "The gathering of Yin’s cold *qi* ascends as water; the essence of water is the Moon, waxing and waning to fulfill its nature." It further states: "The Moon is born of *geng*, the position of double Yin. Water arises from *dui*, *dui* being the youngest daughter, *kan* the middle son—the parents of water." Thus, man aligns with the Sun’s rise in the east, while woman mirrors the Moon’s ascent in the west.

The scriptures declare: "Cinnabar is the essence of the Sun and Moon, the root of life and destiny, harmonizing inner and outer primal *qi*. It bears and shapes form, and when ingested, grants immortality—the mutual resonance of Sun and Moon." Hence it is said: "The Moon’s birth and the Sun’s nurturance depend on the mother, who is Earth." These two treasures, Sun and Moon, are the purest essences of Heaven and Earth. The union of *jia* and *geng* transforms and refines, their radiance coalescing into form, crystallizing as cinnabar—first named *Vermilion Phoenix*, the most revered among the seventy-two stones, none surpassing mercury.

Resonating with the twenty-four *qi*, manifesting in twenty-four names, a chicken fed upon it becomes a phoenix, a serpent that swallows it transforms into a dragon, and one who consumes it attains longevity, their lifespan equaling Heaven and Earth. It gathers the hun and po, reverses aging to youth, commands the winds and clouds, and summons jade maidens—such is the power of the great cyclically transmuted cinnabar.

The formula states: "Red lead is cinnabar. The liquid drawn from cinnabar governs water—*yang*-within-*yin* mercury. That which emerges naturally from cinnabar governs *yin*—*yang*-within-metal mercury." Thus, the wood that cannot be contained is restrained by metal; metal nurtures water, and water’s stability depends on its presence. Metal and wood nurture fire, and fire’s control relies on water. Therefore, lead-water restrains mercury-water, and lead-fire restrains mercury-fire. Wood embodies its nature, while fire unites its form.

The formula states: "Lead-water is the mercury that naturally arises from cinnabar—*yang* mercury. Mercury-water is the liquid extracted from cinnabar—*yin* mercury." Hence it is said: "Lead-water restrains mercury-water." It further says: "Lead-fire is the metal that arises naturally. Mercury-fire is the liquid drawn out." Yet lead-fire restraining mercury-fire is a principle many fail to grasp, thus it is called the Dao of lead and mercury.

The Sun is the fiery essence of Great Yang—mercury-wood as the dragon. The Moon is the watery essence of Great Yin—lead-metal as the tiger. The dragon is Yang *qi*, the utmost of the number nine, the essence of wood. The tiger is Yin *qi*, the utmost of the number four, the essence of metal.

The formula states: "Use non-being to restrain being, and the Dao is complete." Thus it is said: "Cinnabar, the essence of wood, unites with metal without the slightest deviation—most sacred, most numinous." Yet the world, failing to comprehend, sees gold as mere earth.

The elixir is called *Tai Xuan*. The Dao of the *Yin Fu* generates Yin and Yang; Yin and Yang generate the Five Phases, their union forming cyclically transmuted cinnabar—hence the name *Dragon and Tiger*.

Heaven has three: Sun, Moon, and stars. Earth has three: rivers, lakes, and seas. Man has three: essence, *qi*, and spirit. The elixir has three: water, earth, and metal. Thus, *Qian* and *Kun* are the upper and lower crucibles. *Kan* and *Li* are water and fire as the elixir. *Zhen* and *Xun* govern advance and retreat. Circulating for three years mirrors the natural cyclically transmuted cinnabar—once the *qi* of Heaven’s origin is sufficient, how could the elixir fail to form?

The formula states: "Calculate three years as twelve thousand nine hundred and sixty hours, accounting for long and short months and intercalary months—though not within the prescribed limit, this is the true count." If even one *qi* is lacking, it differs not from worthless rubble. When the myriad phenomena attain numinosity, the divine and enlightened naturally align.

Designated as "Golden Sand," it is called the Great Return. "Return" signifies the meaning of reverting to the root.

The formula states: The *yin* tally revolves, *qi* transforms into essence, essence into cinnabar, cinnabar into mercury, mercury into gold, and gold into the elixir. "Elixir" denotes the meaning of red hue. Mercury, by nature, is metal and water restraining each other, hence the name "Golden Sand." Returning to the original substance, it is thus called the Great Return Elixir.

Another tradition says: the Five-*Qi* Metal Crucible. The formula states: the Five *Qi* subdue and prevent volatilization, generating the Five Colors, reverting to their mother—consuming it grants longevity. Cinnabar flows mercury as father, *wu-ji* yellow gold as mother. The mother’s number is five; five employs earth as the crucible, subduing and preventing volatilization, hence called the Metal Crucible. Earth engenders the myriad things; metal is born of earth, thus called the Metal Father. The Metal Father is fundamentally earth. Thus, earth is the father, water the mother. Earth acts as the ghost: earth suppresses water from rising—this is the achievement of *wu-ji*, named the Five Tallies. Without earth, mercury cannot be subdued. Earth flourishes in the metal phase; the three substances together resemble the Emperor. As a ruler with the Dao, the four directions come to pay tribute. Simply discern the true lead and mercury—these two substances form a single crucible method. Thus, the three substances are one household, all converging in *wu-ji*. Without earth to restrain metal and water, the elixir cannot form. Earth reigns for eighteen days each season; on remaining days, it rests or wanes. Refining the Metal Crucible requires thorough investigation of *yin-yang*; essence and *qi* return ceaselessly, like the unceasing drip of a water clock. The potent yang, likened to earth, stabilizes the four directions. Earth is the earth that generates metal; "potent" refers to the male, "yellow" to earth. Earth can restrain water; earth is the Metal Father—not the *qian* of realgar. The crucible governs external earth, named the Five Tallies.

The world does not comprehend that the Return Elixir’s root lies in father and mother, mistakenly using gold and silver as parents or crucibles. If *qi* is insufficient, it does not depart from the Five; the Five does not depart from the Six *Qi*. Though their names are conflated as one, their functions differ upon distinction. Original *qi* is the lord of the Five Materials; the *qi* of the Five Materials, with ruler and minister in attendance, cannot be abandoned. The Golden Elixir employs original *qi*, not the Five Tallies. The Five Tallies are *qi*; *qi* is formless, arising from essence, containing truth within and without—consuming it grants deathlessness and longevity.

The Metal Crucible is the outer lock of the elixir. The "outer" is *qi*; *qi* is the crucible. The crucible resembles a chicken’s egg: white outside, yellow within. Combined with mercury, white metal is used as the vessel. The vessel does not depart from the Five; Five is earth, the earth that generates metal. Through intricate mutual restraint, it ensures no mishap, preventing water from volatilizing—this is the achievement of *wu-ji*.

The formula states: "Raise the sword, lay down the halberd, enshrouding the four directions." Raising the sword is the essence of metal, fundamentally the Five *Qi*. Laying down the halberd and spear ensures water, once obtained, does not fly—it dies in earth. The foundation of the Great Elixir is cinnabar as lead, born of earth and dying also in earth. That cinnabar’s root is earth—only those who attain the utmost Dao know this.

The formula states: Alternative names for the crucible include: External Spirit Water Flower Pond, Spirit Chamber Enclosure, Outer Lock Five *Qi*, White Robe Elixir Robe, Mother Metal Mother Abode, Five Palaces, Metal Crucible Spirit Furnace.

The formula states: Original *qi* broadly enshrouds the eight directions; in minute form, it lurks within a single hair. It exhales *Kun* and vomits the wheel, emerging from existence and entering non-existence. Flowing pearls undergo nine revolutions; the father does not speak to the son. Transformed into yellow and white, they naturally interact. One *yin*, one *yang*—this is the Dao, reverently subdued within the Metal Crucible.

The Golden Elixir is the harmonious radiance of Heaven and Earth, sun and moon’s original harmony, shining and secretly operating to form cinnabar. Within the cinnabar, spontaneously arises the Return Elixir. Like human conception of male and female, all arise from the mutual resonance of father and mother’s *yin-yang* essence and *qi*. The Return Elixir resembles males born face-down and females born face-up—not only in birth, but also in death. Simply cast into water: males sink face-down, females float face-up. Heaven ordains their nature; parents do not cause this.

Within the crucible, metal and water resemble male and female in mutual resonance: the male above, the female below, each attaining their desire. The two essences wrestle, forming the Great Dao.

The formula states: The Golden Elixir must obtain its original foundation, nurtured and subdued by its true father and mother. The father is yang *qi*; the father can emit and move to complete it. The mother is earth, yin *qi*; the mother can contain and nurture to give birth. The mother governs the Central Palace. Yellow earth is the earth that fundamentally generates metal. Cinnabar first receives *qi*, relying on earth to form—thus, it is called the root mother of the Yellow Sprout. Completed by yang, born by the mother—hence called Earth Father. The Earth Father is the Water Mother. Five is the mother of the Five Phases, perpetually generating earth. Water, fire, metal, wood, and earth each occupy a direction, moving to their proper positions. Fire overcomes metal; earth overcomes water. Water is the child of cinnabar. Earth is the crucible. Fire moves to form shape, obtaining earth to complete it. Earth can restrain water; original *qi* resonates to form the Dao. Thus, it is said: "Know the white, guard the black."

The world entirely fails to understand that like attracts like, generating, restraining, and overcoming. Water takes earth as its ghost; earth suppresses water from rising—this is the achievement of *wu-ji*, named the Five Tallies Metal Crucible. Among ten thousand, perhaps one knows this.

Earth tally: the essence of fire and wood. Fire can cook and mature the myriad things, nurturing human life. Fire is the essence of *jia*, the original *qi* of yang. Conjoined in harmony, it merges with the essence of sun and moon, returning to oneness without duality. The essence of *jia* is fire; fire’s number is two. Two generates three; the completion number is nine. Nine is the extreme number of yang, the *qi* of fire.

"Jia is called *zeng*; wood is called green, the agent of the myriad things. The east is the Azure Dragon of wood, the parent of wood and fire, the progeny of fire and wood. *Zhen* is the eldest son; one line generates *Kan*, producing the middle son. Two lines generate fire, born in *chen* and *si*; *Si* and *Li* form the middle daughter. Two lines generate yang, lodging in *bing* and *ding*—the position of fire. Wood gestates fire; to restrain fire, one must borrow water. These three are the Dao of true yang, the positions of *jia* and *yi*, called the Celestial Tally, the token of trust. They can release and discharge the myriad things.

The moon is the Yin Tally, capable of nurturing the myriad things. Earth is the Yin Tally, capable of fostering the myriad things. Fire is the Earth Tally, capable of ripening the myriad things. Metal and water, the primordial *qi*, together with the Yin Tally, can nurture the myriad things. The Direct Tally is like a mirror, likened to the sixty-four hexagrams of the sun and moon, where the six lines release and discharge, and the Celestial Tally completes the Metal Crucible. Ingesting it leads to transcendence—this is the virtue of *Ziming*.

The formula states: Use fire gently, without losing the seasonal nodes; the myriad things arise naturally—this is the meaning of the *River Chariot*. The efficacy lies in the fire timing; failure lies in withdrawal and addition.

One says: The *River Chariot* is the true position of the north, like a chariot’s carrying function.
Another says: *Zi* is metal, *he* is water, *che* is fire—hence *Ziheche* (River Chariot).

**Diagram of Earth Tally Direct Hexagrams and Seasonal Nodes for Advancement and Retreat**
The formula states: Originally employing the four hexagrams, using the four seasonal Direct Tallies in rotation, like a chariot hub’s turning—yin and yang complete their numbers, and creation carries and conveys the myriad things. Thus, it lies in the pitch-pipes and monthly nodes, with the five and six warp and weft serving the sun’s agent. This is recorded in the *Cantong Qi* and will not be repeated here. The advancing and retreating line images are all within the Direct Tally, from one to nine—*Jinhu* (Metal Tiger) spits essence. The formula for the Direct Tally is not detailed here.

The formula states: Entrusting the yin-yang line images, the sixty-four hexagrams establish the analogy. Simply begin with the use of fire at the start, which is the eleventh month, applying the yang seasonal nodes. From the eleventh month’s *Fu* hexagram to the fourth month’s pure *Qian*, the six positions reach extreme yang. From the fifth month’s *Gou* hexagram to the tenth month’s pure *Kun*, the six positions reach extreme yin. This completes one full cycle.

The formula states: In the fifteen days before the full moon, the white moon governs fire and wood, their numbers being seven and eight. *Zhen* presides over spring; wood generates three, the completion number eight. *Li* presides over summer; fire generates two, the completion number seven. Seven and eight make fifteen.

The formula states: In the fifteen days after the full moon, the black moon governs metal and water, their numbers being nine and six. *Dui* presides over autumn; metal generates four, the completion number nine. *Kan* presides over winter; water generates one, the completion number six. Nine and six make fifteen.

The formula states: The foundation of the Five Phases: one is the north’s *ren* and *gui* water; two is the south’s *bing* and *ding* fire; three is the east’s *jia* and *yi* wood; four is the west’s *geng* and *xin* metal; five is the center’s *wu* and *ji* earth. The father is young, and the son is old. The father is *heavenly lead*; heavenly lead is cinnabar. The son, born from the father, is *black lead*—thus, the father is young, and the son is old. The son’s number is indefinite; the father’s number is twenty-five. Water, fire, metal, wood, and earth—the Five Phases shift and change. Five days make one node; five times five is twenty-five—thus, the father is twenty-five. The son’s years of ceaseless movement make the father young and the son old. The world does not know that the myriad things are generated and completed by the Five Phases—these are the parents.

**Fire-Use Formula**
The formula states: The six lines of the Direct Tally move the hexagram nodes; the fire’s weight and measure begin from pure *Kun* and end at *Kun*, cycling without cease.

The formula states: Change the crucible each month; stop at nine crucibles. The tenth crucible may be used at will for rest or activity—whether using the crucible or not, both yield wondrous transformations, for this is the primordial *qi* of generative metal. Thus, it is called the *earth cauldron* or *mother*. The mother is the Metal Crucible.

The formula states: In the operation of metal and water, following the hexagram nodes for fifteen days, the metal nature is extinguished; in thirty days, the elixir is completed. By the tenth month, the original earth is no longer used as the crucible—mother and child part ways in the womb. The *nine revolutions* are the nine crucibles. The *tally* is the father’s function; the *crucible* is the mother’s function. It is likened to a human, who after receiving *qi*, is born in 270 days. The ninth month is when yin and yang are both abundant; the tenth month, when earth flourishes, mother and child separate—hence the name *womb-exiting returning elixir*. It is like a human, whose four *qi* are complete at birth. Just as a child is nurtured for three years until the primordial *qi* is full, the Golden Elixir is completed—this is called *Yellow Lift*. Transforming and returning to the north, the black color becomes translucent—only then is it named the *Great Returning Elixir*. The world does not know this.

The child is the medicine; the mother is the crucible. *Qi* resonates to generate and produce, restrain and subdue, alternately flourishing and declining. Ascending and descending within the crucible, flying and hiding above and below, yin and yang receive each other, intermingling and devouring. The four substances press upon one another; ruler and minister combine. Earth’s nature generates; metal’s nature dies. The four substances are yang within yin and yin within yang. Yet earth is the pivot; the Direct Tally moves—thus, the four substances each reside in their quadrant. When the four natures are extinguished, they return to oneness and revert to the origin—hence the name *Golden Elixir*.

The formula states: Guard and operate for one year, ingest one *liang*—no illness will arise. Guard and operate for two years, complete the White Way—ingest half a *liang*. Guard and operate for three years, the Great Primordial *Qi* is full, complete the Red Way—ingest one *fen*, abide in the world, and attain longevity. A *daogui* (knife-tip) controls mercury to complete the Red Way. Guard and operate for five years, ingest seven grains the size of sesame seeds—attain longevity. A *daogui* transmutes iron and mercury, one *jin* to complete the Red Way. After nine full years of guarding and operating, ingest three grains—the Three Corpses and Nine Worms all depart, and one attains ageless longevity."

The five metals, eight minerals, and even tiles and pebbles—all become supreme treasures.

The formula states: Use fire as indicated by the moving lines of the hexagrams; record the weight of fire with a hand-mirror, and employ them together. For example, in the eleventh month, when *Jianzi* begins, one yang line stirs—fire begins at two, completing the number seven. The movement and rotation are like a wheel: each month advances one line, until the fifth month when one yin line arises; each month then retreats one line, returning to earth by the tenth month. This cycle repeats endlessly. Cinnabar and gold move like the sun and moon, naturally forming the elixir. Since Suiren mastered fire, later sages used it to refine the elixir. The great creation of the celestial revolution depends on the clarity of the water clock; the fire must not lose its weight, and the seasonal nodes must be precise. Gradually, like steaming food, when the years and months are fulfilled, success comes naturally. If too hasty, the essence will fly away; if too slow, it will not be subdued. Simply follow the moving lines of the hexagrams, and the gold and water will naturally submit.

In the sixth month, yang expires, ending at *si*. In the twelfth month, yin expires, ending at *hai*.

The formula states: Cinnabar is the essence of the yang-black flowing pearl, establishing heaven and earth, circulating water and fire, responding to the celestial tally, and uniting the Three Powers. Gold is the essence of the moon, residing in the yang position. Mercury unites with the *li* hexagram, corresponding to the six lines. The spirit of heaven and earth, the essence of the sun and moon—when negativity reaches its limit, positivity arises. Thus it is said: Cinnabar is the essence of wood, which, when combined with metal, merges as one. This is the Way of the Three-in-One. Three is fire, one is the medicine—this is called "guarding the One." It is also said: Cinnabar is the medicine, gold is the crucible. Hence it is said: The Three Ways originate from one root; the great Dao’s ultimate principle has no duality. Cinnabar is warm and harmonious, non-toxic, pungent in taste, and its primordial blackness connects with the numinous. Though refined ten thousand times, it does not wither—it is called "black lead." Lead is the liquid born within cinnabar, the liquid drawn out by the upturned moon, black in color. When it enters the upturned moon and unites as husband and wife, the yang soul embraces the yin spirit, and the two natures naturally harmonize.

The formula states: Thus, employ the Five Phases—*Qian*, *Kun*, *Gen*, and *Xun*—with the moving tally nurturing and transforming. From *Jianzi*, when the first yang arises at *zi*, *zi* and *wu* correspond, five and six communicate. The water clock shifts, the sun, moon, and five stars move, cold and heat alternate, day as yang and night as yin—every thirty days they conjoin. Each node arrives in sequence; yin and yang, cold and heat, adjust and submit, circulating through the sixty-four hexagrams in endless repetition. Water and fire subdue each other, with nothing external; the five metals and eight minerals are transformed by human effort. The five metals are the Five Phases; the eight minerals are the Eight Trigrams. Water, when met with the dragon, transforms; fire, when met with man, moves. The cyclically transformed elixir is nurtured without exceeding the five and eight.

The formula states: When the moving tally first stirs, civil fire does not exceed nine, and martial fire does not exceed nine. Nine is the extreme number of yang. Three times three is nine; beyond this, the beginning of extreme yin arises. When yin is exhausted, yang is born—all follow the Dao of heaven’s yin and yang in movement. If gold and water are balanced and the seasonal nodes are in order, gold and water harmonize. If the nodes are disordered, gold and water become discordant. The movement is like a silkworm spinning its cocoon or a bird brooding its egg—receiving the blackness to activate its function. Their generation is like the transformation of a cold valley into sprouting branches, occurring at the appointed time and interacting—all are established as metaphors.

The formula states: The essence of the sun is primordial blackness, originally born in the southern *bing ding* fire, the *li* position, where one yin arises amid two yangs—this is the sun’s soul, yin mercury, water. When its blackness is full, it shifts to the northern *ren gui* water, the *kan* position, where one yang arises amid two yins—this is the moon’s spirit, yang mercury, metal. Water is still and unmoving, the substance of non-action. Fire flickers and flies, the origin of action. Uniting the formless with the formed completes the Way. Thus, it is known that metal is born in dark places, initially responding as mother and child.

The formula states: When gold enters the central palace, it is called the Great One, nurturing and containing the yellow, with blackness mixing with the blue. The White Tiger’s system follows the original blackness—hence the term *Cantong*. It is also said: *Kan* and *li* are numbered one and two, uniquely forming the warp of south and north. One is water, two is fire; all things are born through water and completed through fire. Fire and metal contend, water and earth overcome each other to form the elixir.

The formula states: When the moving tally first stirs at *zi*, it arises from *zhen*. In the fourth month, fire flourishes, and extreme yang retreats. Then, from *xun*, two woods gradually align. Though mercury is initially subdued in *qian*, it is not yet the great elixir. Guarding three nodes is called "cinnabar"; five nodes is called "gold sand." One year is called "inverted long sand," also named "lesser return." Two years is called "soul sand," also named "middle return." Three years is called "golden liquid great elixir"—one who ingests it becomes an upper immortal.

The formula states: Those who fail to comprehend the profound principle of the golden elixir do not understand that cinnabar is the root of lead’s transformation. Misled by confusion, they mistakenly use common mercury, common lead, or common silver, unaware that common lead is the mother of worldly silver. Mercury is the child of the medicine, cinnabar is the mother of lead, and yellow is earth—earth is the father and ancestor of cinnabar. Unaware, they err in using common mercury, lead, or silver as crucibles or as mother and child. Some refine lead, extracting its mixed stones as medicine. From ancient times to the present, none have succeeded because they do not know the root of the Dao. The Way of immortals lies before one’s eyes. Cinnabar is the essence of wood, born through earth and extinguished through earth, never departing from the Five Phases’ mutual interaction. They become father and mother, generating and extinguishing to form shape.

The formula states: Blackness can preserve life; the inner elixir secures form, and the outer elixir grants longevity—nothing surpasses these two elixirs, inner and outer. The essence of the sun and moon is cinnabar, the primordial harmony of blackness—the root of nature and life.

Beyond the essence of the inner and outer elixirs of gold, all else is not worth discussing.

The formula states: Take mercury, for instance—a solitary yin substance that corrodes flesh and scours the intestines. Gold harms the liver, silver the spleen, copper the kidneys, lead and tin the stomach. The Four Yellows are highly toxic, depleting one’s primordial qi. Any single metal or mineral, the thirty-six aqueous solutions, or the seventy-two stones—all bear great toxicity. Though they may cause no immediate harm upon ingestion, over time they inevitably bring grave injury. Even if cinnabar has peripheral methods to subdue them, it offers but minor benefit; it cannot serve as the Way of prolonged life and immortality.

The formula states: Consider common mercury and lead—their mother resides in the ore, receiving ample yang and blackness, their nature inherently subdued. When refined by fire and smoke, they become the mercury of the world. This worldly mercury resembles the mercury within cinnabar in appearance, yet they differ as man and woman. Cinnabar is like a man, an old yang, the essence of the hun-soul, preserving human life and nature. Its inherent mercury is subdued, never mingling with worldly mercury, restrained by external forces. The formula states: Worldly mercury is like a woman, the essence of the moon’s great yin, stealing human life and nature. A solitary yin with scant yang, it is toxic and must not be consumed. Thus it is said: Mercury possesses yin and yang. Though their natures and forms appear alike, they are the essence of heaven and earth, differing as man and woman. If cinnabar has peripheral methods to subdue it, then common lead may serve as the vessel to contain and refine the elixir.

The formula states: People today do not know the root of the yellow and white arts. They regard common mercury, lead, gold, and silver as supreme medicines. Yet they fail to see that mercury is born of lead, and cinnabar emerges from gold. The golden elixir borrows the root of blackness to become cinnabar—how can one abandon the root and favor the branch? Lead is the child, the essence of cinnabar. Blackness is the mother, the earth of metal’s earth—hence it is called "root lead," or "heavenly lead," which is cinnabar. Gold is born from lead, the child concealed within the mother’s womb. The child hides within gold, the mother concealed in the child’s embryo. Lead is the yellow sprout; the yellow sprout is cinnabar. Earth generates the sprout, hence it is called the "yellow sprout." Lead is the fine matchmaker of the Seven Treasures, the sinew and bone of the Five Metals. When understood, all matters become clear; when deluded, a thousand paths are blocked. Thus lead subdues mercury, and mercury subdues lead. Lead and mercury unite to form the yellow and white. Therefore, the Dao is called the union of one yin and one yang; the elixir is called the union of one metal and one stone. Stone rides the yang and is hot; metal rides the yin and is cold. The hun and po respond to one another—this is the inevitable principle. The liquid of stone stabilizes the hun; the essence of metal stabilizes the po. Without the mutual transformation of yin and yang, even the depths of the Nine Darks would be unreliable. The noble man seeks earnestly; the virtuous woman matches fittingly. Only then is the principle proper, and the Dao resides therein.

The Classic states: The Old Woman of the River, numinous and most divine. When fire is applied, she takes flight, unseen in dust or earth. Ghosts hide, dragons conceal—none know where she abides.

To subdue it, the Yellow Sprout serves as the root. Without the Yellow Sprout, if one burns mercury alone, though the vessel be a foot thick and sealed a hundredfold, once fire is applied, it takes flight—none can halt it. In an instant, it vanishes without a trace, like ghosts concealed in darkest depths or dragons hidden in watery abodes, even the eyes of Li Lou could not perceive it. That mercury remains subdued and unmoving is the work of the Yellow Sprout.

The *Jue of the Golden Immortal* states: One liang of Yellow Sprout subdues one jin of mercury, like a child clinging to its mother, its countenance obedient, never fleeing—like a loyal minister’s devotion to his lord.

The world uses raw gold as the Yellow Sprout, yet the Yellow Sprout is also said to be the true essence of lead, refined and extracted. A song says:
*The Yellow Sprout and lead-mercury create,*
*Yin’s husk holds yang’s radiance.*

This does not depart from the Five Phases. Thus it is said: When the Five Phases achieve success, one who ingests them attains longevity. The Five are the earth within lead that generates gold—this earth is the true mother of lead. He who grasps the secret of the Yellow Sprout has mastered the gate of the Great Medicine.

I preserve clarity in fire times, discerning advance and retreat, tireless day and night, steadfast from beginning to end, thus achieving the True One. Hence it is said:
*Golden sand enters the five viscera,*
*Mist scatters like wind and rain,*
*Steam rises to the four limbs.*

Thus the sage conceals what is easy, not what is difficult. He who attains it attains the One.

If one forcibly seizes the Dao with a thieving heart, scorns the cultivation of the mind, and disrespects the revered teacher, filled with arrogance and self-satisfaction—even if some teachings are received, should the intent lie in personal glory, it is certain to bring harm instead. This is not that Heaven rejects them, but that their heart does not align with the Dao.

**Direct Talisman Fire Method**
On the first day of the first period, apply one *liang* of fire for thirty hours.
By two and a half days, add two *liang*, totaling sixty hours.
From the first line to the second line.

On the sixth day of the second period, apply three *liang* of fire for thirty hours.
By seven and a half days, increase to four *liang*, totaling sixty hours.
From the third line to the fourth line.

On the eleventh day of the third period, apply five *liang* of fire for thirty hours.
Increase to six *liang*, totaling sixty hours.
From the fifth line to the sixth line.

On the sixteenth day of the fourth period, still use six *liang* of fire for thirty hours.
Reduce to five *liang*, totaling sixty hours.
From the sixth line to the fifth line.

On the twenty-first day of the fifth period, reduce fire to four *liang* for thirty hours.
Further reduce to three *liang*, totaling sixty hours.
From the fourth line to the third line.

On the twenty-sixth day of the sixth period, reduce fire to two *liang* for thirty hours.
Further reduce to one *liang*, totaling sixty hours.
From the second line to the first line.

The above six periods of the Direct Talisman, with lines advancing and retreating, follow this monthly method, cycling endlessly.

Proceeding to the second "horse" (phase), in the initial period, apply two *liang* for thirty hours.
Increase to three *liang*, totaling sixty hours.
Continue incrementing as before.

Each time the cauldron is changed at the start of a lunar month, add one *liang*.
By the ninth month’s initial period, the fire reaches nine *liang*.
From one to nine, the Metal Tiger spits its essence.
For thirty hours, increase to fourteen *liang*, totaling sixty hours.
Align the Direct Talisman with the advance and retreat, strictly following the clepsydra’s markings. When applying fire, emulate the fourth month when fire flourishes in extreme yang. In its advance and retreat, yin and yang lie concealed. When changing the cauldron at the shift of punishment and virtue, it is the earth’s flourishing in the Metal region—where the Three Agents all perish, for Metal and earth are fundamentally black and mutually responsive.

When the Direct Talisman aligns with retreat, it mirrors the fifth month when the first yin arises—"At the ninth yang, the dragon soars too high and meets regret."

When the Direct Talisman moves to the ninth cauldron, it is the initial period after the ninth month, consistently at nine *liang*.
For thirty hours, add one *liang*, totaling sixty hours.
At fourteen *liang*, it is extreme yang.
Then retreat to nine *liang*.
After completing the tenth month, regardless of years or months, always follow the ninth month’s initial period: begin at fourteen *liang*, retreat to nine *liang*, completing sixty hours.

Proceed in order with the Direct Talisman’s increments and reductions, clearly marking the clepsydra’s divisions. Cycle endlessly, and the movement will conclude after nine years.

**Method Formula:**
The Direct Talisman’s fire advance and retreat: In the first month’s initial period, ignite the fire with twenty-four *liang* of fire as one line, following the twenty-four black method.
Maintain until two and a half days, add one line, and by five days, it is one period.
Continue incrementing the fire by lines; each month has six periods.

Always at the third period’s sixty hours and the fourth period’s first thirty hours, apply the martial fire. For the fire’s weight in *liang*, advancing and retreating day and night, add well-tempered fire, ensuring the fire’s surface remains exposed to gauge the proper weight.

After completing nine and a half months of the Direct Talisman, consistently follow the ninth month’s fire period and line method for advancing and retreating *liang*—regardless of how many years or months pass.

Begin the water drip at the *zi* hour, observing until *chou*, measuring the required water. Construct a barrel three *chi* high, one *chi* in inner diameter, and near the bottom edge, bore a small hole with a feathered tube tightly fitted inside. Seal the edges with wax, fill with water, and let it drip completely. Then refill and measure the water used in one double-hour to establish the standard for all times. Ensure day and night are clearly distinguished, matching the clepsydra’s accuracy before use.

For the Direct Talisman’s nine cauldrons, concealed advance and retreat, each month has six periods. Record the fire’s progression in the correct almanac, detailing each step as follows:
One line per month, proceeding in order.
Each month has three advances and three retreats—do not disrupt the sequence.

**Formula:**
The sage shifts and applies fire, emulating Heaven’s cyclical return.
*The Celestial Sovereign’s Hand Mirror* states: Heaven and earth’s two blacks mutually resonate; sun and moon illuminate, forming the natural Reverted Elixir. The celestial immortals gather and refine it—this is not something worldly scholars can attain. It is the method of immortals, upholding the Great Dao. Cultivating life establishes the Direct Talisman. After three years of movement, the natural black emerges. Apply fire in accordance with the seasons, awaiting the hexagrams *Qian* and *Kun*, *Kan* and *Li*, incrementing the fire’s weight. One must receive the true teacher’s oral transmission. Without a teacher, haphazardly mixing ingredients and introducing杂乱杂, there will be no success. The sage observes Heaven and guards the One. Grasping the mutual restraint of the original father and mother ensures success—this is spiritual transformation through divine penetration.

**Formula:**
The Direct Talisman method is likened to the eleventh month, *jianzi*, when yang *qi* begins to arise. On the summer solstice day, yin *qi* begins to arise. This is Heaven and earth’s yin and yang advancing and retreating, governing the twelve months of the year. Thus, each month has six periods. The Direct Talisman lies concealed, with the Five Phases emerging and submerging, their interactions and mutual restraints all contained within. Wood is obtained from earth and fire.

In the first fifteen days of the white moon, the three periods of extreme yang govern. After *Zhen*, yang moves and yin arises—nine-six yin water. In the latter fifteen days of the black moon, the three governing periods belong to yin, cycling endlessly. Thus, seven-eight and nine-six align with the Dao, completing thirty days.

Metal and water are analogized to establish the monthly periods. Day and night, the fire lies concealed, emulating the yin and yang seasonal nodes of a year—one day and night’s fire application.

This is the grasp of Heaven and Earth, with the pivotal mechanism held in hand. It is called the method of transcending the world, profound beyond profundity. When the fire is first kindled, it is the eleventh month, when the first yang begins to sprout and take charge.

The formula states: The first crucible corresponds to the second initial period of the second month, with one line of fire. The Direct Talisman symbolizes the eleventh month, *Jianzi*, when yang and darkness govern, the *ninth yang* of "the hidden dragon biding its time." One line is generated, lasting two and a half days and nights, totaling thirty hours. When it reaches two lines, five days form one period, comprising sixty hours. Traversing the eleventh month, one *chen* moves sequentially from *zi* to *hai*, encompassing twelve hours. Five cycles complete sixty hours, constituting one period.

The first period of five days marks the *Jingzhe* solar term. *Zhen* arrives to receive the talisman, and by the eighth day at the first quarter, the nature of metal waxes and wanes, half-submerged in deathly darkness. Maintaining this until the fifteenth day, the darkness extinguishes the nature of metal. By the twentieth day, what once sprouted no longer grows; yang ascends while yin recedes, water remains still, and hardness and softness interact—spontaneously forming the elixir.

On the twenty-first day, *Xun* arrives to receive the talisman. The nature of metal and water is extinguished, and darkness is exhausted. The two essences inhale and exhale in unison, dying together. *Zhen* and *Xun*, the two woods, gradually align, and mercury becomes *qian*. Yet this is not the Great Elixir.

Forty-five days later, one node after another drives and compels, until the sixtieth day when *mao* aligns with *Jiazhong*. Punishment and virtue contend, and day and night begin to divide—hence the name *YuJia* Elixir.

Thus it is said: The sun has three illuminations, the moon three shifts. When the sun and moon conjoin in darkness, all things undergo three transformations to reach their apex. Following the natural Dao of the four seasons, one month has three hundred sixty hours, symbolizing a year’s four thousand three hundred twenty hours—mirroring the natural cyclical elixir.

The formula states: The nine crucibles correspond to nine months, each crucible requiring three. For each crucible, one must maintain the reception of darkness for two hundred seventy days, when yin and yang are both abundant. In the tenth month, earth flourishes and gives birth—hence the phrase "mother and child parting." The world remains unaware.

Water and fire restrain each other, mutually overcoming and becoming father and mother. They do not exceed five and eight, concealing and nurturing to take form.

Guard and circulate for one thousand days, when the celestial primordial darkness is complete, and the nature returns to the northern *ren* and *gui* waters—black in color, called the Great Returned Elixir.

The formula states: Take primordial black metal-water, divide it into two equal parts, and harmonize them into one body. This is likened to the moon’s upper and lower crescents, corresponding to the weight of two eights (one *jin*), aligning with yin and yang. Metal and water originate from one substance yet manifest as two forms. The black phase awaits the natural union of cinnabar and lead—yellow and white—following the principles of yin and yang, their essence undivided. Two parts are fire, one part is water. Beyond water and fire as ingredients, nothing else is added. If foreign elements intrude, the elixir will never form. Its attainment does not depend on weight. Simply ensure metal-water enters the crucible, seal it properly, and on a *four-killing* yang day at a yang hour, with the water clock’s divisions clear, when metal and water lie undifferentiated within the crucible, the direct spirit moves and transforms them—clarifying the turbid, white above and yellow below—embracing the true and holding to the One.

The formula states: Cinnabar, gold-sand, golden liquid, everlasting sand, yellow sprout, celestial lead, sand-mercury, lead-mercury, yin-yang, metal-earth-water-fire, *kan*-*li*, *qian*-*kun*, dragon-tiger, golden elixir, jade liquid, the Great Elixir of Nine Returns and Seven Reversions—all are alternate names. The ancients guarded these secrets, concealing them in myriad ways, yet for the enlightened, they converge as one without duality. The Returned Elixir has its reversion; blood-contaminated objects are forbidden. The ancients were discreet with this Way, never revealing it to those without shared purpose.

For all cultivation sites, utmost purity is essential—avoid places of death, birth, weeping, burials, graves, or impurity. Choose auspicious lands and renowned mountains, then offer sacrifices to the local earth deities and guardian spirits, maintaining morning and evening incense and lamps. Prevent all vulgar intrusions or defilement; proceed in secrecy. If in a pure and secluded place with like-minded companions—those of unblemished conduct and single-minded devotion—it may also be practiced. Strict cleanliness and protection are required.

Illustrations and supplementary texts are recorded separately.

In praise:
The true formula of the precious elixir,
Transmitted by celestial immortals.
Clarifying metals and minerals,
Dispelling all doubt.
With frugal conduct and a heart for relief,
Devotion takes precedence.
Profound and subtle, the mystery upon mystery—
Vast and boundless, its source unknowable.
Should you lightly disclose it,
You shall forever sink into the dark springs.

Auspicious days for refinement:
*Jiazi*, *Jiachen*, *Yisi*, *Gengshen*, *Xinyou*, *Bingwu*, *Dingsi*, *Wushen*, *Jiyou*—
these nine days are suitable for the work.
When the fire is complete, it opens the gateway to divine immortality.
No other days will suffice.

For the method: Seal the ground with a talisman, invoking the response of the hundred spirits. This talisman is prepared at the *zi* hour of midnight on the *jiazi* day of the winter solstice, then buried three feet deep within the elixir chamber. Thus, the hundred spirits dare not cause harm.

*End of Volume One of the* Handbook of the Returned Elixir.
*Volume Two of the* Handbook of the Returned Elixir *begins.*

*The Heart-Mirror of the Golden Liquor Dragon-Tiger Returned Elixir*

The True Oral Instructions state:
Fear only that the lead be not true—
When the elixir is formed, the medicine will be numinous of itself.
Fear only that the mercury be not upright—
When the elixir is formed, the medicine will be sacred of itself.

The ancient immortals spoke only of the two principles, lead and mercury,
Never of the four yellows and eight minerals.
Those who speak of the four yellows and eight minerals are in error.

The Great Elixir employs the Five Phases,
Is perfected through the Four Images—
This is the primordial qi of yin and yang,
The Dao of spontaneous resonance.

It is like a human receiving qi to form the embryo:
Originally endowed with the two qi, red and white—
The man’s essence is white, the woman’s blood is red.
When the two qi intermingle and conjoin,
After ten months the gestation is complete,
And the form and features are fully manifest.
If the received qi is sufficient,
The person will be intelligent and robust.
If the received qi is insufficient,
The person will be dull-witted and weak.
All is of a kind.

This is a discourse of utmost truth—
Let the student ponder it deeply.

What, then, are the Dragon and Tiger?
The Dragon is mercury, wood, and fire.
The Tiger is lead, silver, Metal’s Elder, and water.
Metal engenders water, water engenders wood,
Wood engenders fire, fire engenders earth—
The Dao abides therein.

Lead contains the five colors,
Mercury emits the three splendors.
When these two substances are conjoined as one,
It is called the River Chariot.
The worldly, deluded by this,
Exhaust their fortunes and ruin their families.
The perfected, awakened to this,
Ascend upon clouds and tread upon rosy mists.

The Dao is not far—it may be seen before one’s eyes.
Bo Yang expounded the *Yi* and composed the *Cantong Qi*,
Illuminating the wondrous workings of yin-yang, li-k’an, and the Five Phases.
Though its matters are plain, they remain hidden;
Scholars find them hard to grasp.
Even those who know of lead and mercury, medicinal substances,
The subtleties of fire-times, the crucible and furnace, and their symbolic forms,
Must delve into their own minds.
The mind is the origin of the elixir.
If the mind does not accord with the Dao,
Even should one encounter a perfected master and receive the oral transmission,
He may yet fear that Heaven’s principle and the numinous spirits will not protect him,
And instead invite demonic obstructions.
Thus it is said: what is hardest to attain is the human mind.
If the mind harmonizes with the Dao, cultivation will surely succeed.
Few are those of sincere heart and reverent resolve—
It is not that the immortals and sages keep secrets,
But that they do not find the right person.
The three chapters of Tao Hongjing remain obscure and difficult to fathom.
The *Jinbi* and *Cantong Qi*—without a teacher, how can they be understood?
I have composed the *Xinjian*—*jian* means “to illumine.”
Illumined and reflected in the mind, ever held in hand,
It explains the *Cantong Qi*’s symbolic images,
Differentiates the weights and measures of medicinal substances,
And clarifies them into a mirror.
Yet I dare not expound at length,
Lest I invite the burden of endless scrutiny.

The arcane principles of the ancient immortals all return to this:
One yin and one yang are called the Dao;
That which is unfathomable in yin and yang is called the numinous.
The numinous transforms and gives rise to the myriad things.
Thus the *Cantong Qi* states:
“Plant grain with grain,
Hatch a chicken with its egg.”
Like attracts like;
Deviate, and the treasure will not form.
Master Tao said:
“Cinnabar is born of mercury,
Gold is born of lead”—
This is true principle.
Like does not mix with unlike;
Mercury and quicksilver are distinct—
The deluded use them clumsily.
If lead is genuine,
It will not lose its ministerial essence.
Mercury lives, quicksilver dies;
Lead, when refined, becomes true yellow sprout—
This is the true teaching.
The ancient immortals spoke only of lead and mercury,
Never of the Four Yellows or Eight Stones.
Let scholars take this as a clear mirror.
Thus I reiterate and exhort again and again,
Yet still fear that later learners will remain mired in confusion.
The so-called Returned Elixir
Returns to the original color of the primordial elixir—
Hence it is called the Returned Elixir.
Simply master the fire-times,
And do not lose the original essence of its fundamental body—
This is called the Returned Elixir.
The “nine revolutions” refer to the ninefold transformation of lead’s primordial qi;
Lead is not refined nine times to completion.
All divine elixirs and supreme medicines
Are formed solely through the transformation of yin and yang’s qi,
Without the admixture of other substances—
They are purely and truly constituted.
One must obtain the true essence-qi of genuine lead.
Without recognizing true lead,
There can be no success in principle.
Moreover, true lead does not change color,
And true mercury possesses numinous power.
The words of the ancient immortals must not be left obscure.
When base lead enters the fire,
It is reduced entirely to ashes—
For its true essence has been consumed and lost,
And its primordial qi dissipated.
If one takes this spent and ruined substance
And compounds it with mercury,
How can a supreme medicine be formed?
This teaching sweeps away the dust of the vulgar and ignorant,
Revealing the true mystery.
Those with the eye of Dao
Will hear these words of mine
As one parched receives icy water,
Or one benighted meets the bright moon.
They will penetrate the sacred canon,
No longer bewildered by numinous texts,
And may join the immortals in song—
How could they not attain the realm of the immortals?
The foolish, hearing this,
Will doubt and disbelieve—
It is not fitting to speak of such things with them.

The immortal scriptures say:
“The wonder of the Returned Elixir lies in the Three-in-One.
The essence of Dragon and Tiger is the essence of Heaven and Earth.
No other medicines are used—
Only the Five Phases.”
These are the words of the perfected.
Those who attain this afterward
Do not betray the words of the ancient worthies,
Nor fail to grasp their symbolic forms.
The symbolic forms are the root of Heaven and Earth;
When the root is established, the Dao arises.
Heaven, Earth, and Humanity are the Three Powers—
How can one narrowly cling to the workings of creation,
The movement of yin and yang,
Without attending to the Three Essentials?
Lose it by a hair’s breadth,
And Heaven and Earth become as distant as sky and abyss—
How can such words be spoken lightly?
The true oral transmission states:
“Cinnabar is the essence of the Great Yang,
Originally receiving the true qi of the South,
Governed by the regulations of yin-yang water and fire.
It resides at the head of the Azure Emperor,
And is called mercury—
Born of fire,
It inherently possesses virtue and reaches the numinous.
Lead is the essence of the Black Water of the North,
Transformed and returning to the Metal of the West’s geng and xin.
Thus Metal engenders Water, Water engenders Wood—
These two substances naturally match each other.
Were they not supremely numinous and sagely,
How could they form the divine elixir?”
The vulgar and common of the world
How could they believe in this most true Dao?
I have long pitied them.
Since ancient times, all true persons have refined and ingested this divine medicine,
Thus attaining wondrous union of form and spirit,
And merging with the Dao in truth.
How could there be any who do not believe?
Many cite the First Emperor of Qin and Emperor Wu of Han as examples.
Yet the numinous power of the Great Elixir
Cannot save one from the calamity of self-inflicted harm.
Formerly, Liu Xuanyu served Master Wei,
Tending the furnace for a year,
But his idle thoughts gave rise to doubt,
And he withdrew without attaining the Way,
Meeting an early death.
Yu Jingxiu, by contrast,
Diligently cultivated his mind and perfected his virtue,
Serving his teacher without cease,
And obtained the divine elixir.
After ingesting it, he became an immortal,
And now dwells in the immortal cave of Mount Taibai,
Having passed over a thousand years,
Yet still wanders the markets of men.
These two—one doubted, one did not—
The difference between them is as vast as a foot and a thousand miles,
Between attainment and non-attainment,
Between muddy paths and cloudy skies.
Even the Five Grains can sustain human life—
How much more the numinous power of the divine medicine?
Yet people of the world are shallow in blessing and karma,
Thus they do not believe, do not encounter, do not cultivate,
Living in vain and dying in delusion,
Sinking through countless kalpas.
People of the world are only greedy for glory, fame, and profit,
Bewitched by wine and sensuality,
Entangled in love and attachment,
Their forms withered and spirits lost,
Yet still they do not awaken.
Day and night they fret and worry—
When will they ever be satisfied?
Noble and base, rich and poor—
All are the same.
Hearing of the cultivation of truth, they slander and revile it—
How then could they attain the Dao of the immortals?
I do not wish to expound further.

In recent times, Xie Chongxuan and Su Dan—
Both ingested the Golden Elixir and became immortals,
As the world well knows.

Moreover, those who attain it often mingle among common folk, blending their light with the dust—how could others recognize them?

The *Cantong Qi* states:
*"Gold takes cinnabar as its master,
Receiving harmony from mercury.
Transformation arises from its truth,
Beginning and end naturally follow,
The two substances conceiving of themselves."*

It further says:
*"Do not use mere herbs—employ the Five Phases."*
And:
*"Heaven engenders the sprout,
Its body naturally formed."*
And:
*"White Horse’s Teeth, true cinnabar,
Mao and You, the two eights, harmonize the two families."*
And:
*"Huainan refines autumn stone,
The Yellow Emperor cherishes golden blossoms."*
And:
*"The sprout is not lead,
Lead is not the sprout.
True lead, true cinnabar—
These two hold the profound essence.
Refined as one household,
Circulating fire nears the ninth revolution,
Naturally forming the yellow sprout."*

It also says:
*"Fire transforms to white,
The medicine turns to red,
Divine cinnabar and autumn stone unite of themselves."*
And:
*"Solitary yin cannot transform alone,
Lone yang cannot achieve completion.
Their original pure and limpid essence
Possesses a numinous power of change."*
And:
*"Dragon and tiger meet—
When do they not attend each other?
White liquid and the other swallow one another,
Swallowing as husband and wife.
Following change, they form the yellow sprout,
Proceeding in time to rely on the earth."*
And:
*"If you comprehend the Purple River Chariot,
You will naturally ascend to the edge of heaven."*
And:
*"Once the divine elixir’s method is mastered,
Its spiritual use lies in your hands.
Life and death rest in my grasp—
Discernment lies in distinguishing false from true."*
And:
*"Without the elixir’s method,
Years of effort waste the heart and spirit.
Do not refine withered lead and mercury,
Lest your work scatter like dust."*

It further states:
*"Within heaven, earth, sun, and moon,
The numinous medicine is called Metal Lord.
The Metal Lord is not lead—
It is originally concealed within lead.
I speak plainly to you,
Yet the deluded rush past in haste.
Mercury is fixed within lead,
The golden blossom’s intent is roughly the same.
This blossom is no mere herb—
To refine it is to waste effort in vain."*
And:
*"This matter is spoken by immortals—
How could it not be profoundly clear?
Study the *Cantong Qi* closely,
And still rely on the Five Categories’ fusion.
Seek only true lead and mercury—
Cultivate them, and you will see results."*

It also says:
*"Lead and mercury unite heaven and earth,
Refined to make the Great Return Elixir.
When the elixir is complete, treasures appear of themselves—
Without this, success is truly difficult.
The Perfected of Great Antiquity spoke thus,
Yet even the wise of today are perplexed.
Only when you grasp the true and essential meaning
Can you align with the Dao and find peace.
Within it lies fivefold radiance,
Spiritual transformations subduing its vessel.
After ten months, the embryo is shed—
Those who witness it rejoice.
I report to the seekers of glory:
A hundred years wither and decay.
Why idly abandon the world,
Dull and content in the Dao’s embrace?
Though I explain in detail, you still slander,
The numinous words’ principle grows ever more obscure.
Alas! Behold the dust of north and south,
Piled over years into mountains and hills.
Amidst the boundless bitter sea,
Birth and death churn like waves.
Since ancient times, even emperors dwelled here—
What is there to admire now?"*

It further says:
*"The white liquid transforms within the furnace,
The yellow sprout gradually forms.
Recall the first day they met—
Mercury’s form was hard to find.
When yang reaches its extreme, yin fire arises,
When fire declines, yang and black merge.
Naturally, the yellow sprout changes—
Ingest it, and you attain long life.
In one month, the white liquid
First congeals, like snow.
In two months, it resembles
Softened wax, slowly solidifying.
In three months, half-contained,
The medicine splits, dangling like flawed pearls.
In four months, the two substances
Embrace, like drops of blood.
In five months, it soars,
Yearning for its mother with mournful cries.
In six months, it arrives—
The yang qi of the Purple Palace is cut off.
In seven months, riding yin,
It receives blackness, hands and feet growing numb.
In eight months, nearing completion,
The viscera hold congealed blood.
In nine months, drop by drop,
Pearls form, hair grows long.
In ten months, mother and child
Part, about to separate.
At this time, the mother is exhausted, the child’s body whole—
Already, the flesh and complexion turn white as snow.
After the lead sheds its womb,
The lead is white as snow.
Observe its gentle nurturing in the furnace,
And the child’s entire body becomes radiant.
Expel the child’s black poison as the method instructs."*

The Classic says:
*"This medicine is like a child in the mother’s womb,
Bright and clear, distinguishing flesh and bone,
Following a sequence—do not transgress it.
Simply know how to cultivate the yellow sprout,
Achieving the power of transformation,
Without cessation.
Ingest it to attain long life,
Turn white hair black,
Possess silver’s whiteness,
Relieve poverty and want.
The benevolent who obtain it never cease—
Their affinity with the Dao runs deep.
If you transmit it to the right person,
It must reside in the heart."*

Those who lack the Dao incur profound transgressions;
Even if obtained, calamity and misfortune will assail them.
The workings of creation are not easily grasped—
Do not casually reveal them to others.
Have you not seen the solemn oaths of the ancients?
To recklessly transmit this invites ancestral retribution.
You must believe without doubt,
For only the wise and enlightened may receive it.
Today, I pledge to you with utmost sincerity—
Let every vow be solemnly observed.

When yang arises, yin follows;
The embryo’s furnace rests in the central earth of wu-ji’s crucible.
Above and below, they mutually converge and guard,
Firmly preserving the subtle balance—
Never let the breath of life escape.
Attend closely to the seasons and signs.
Dragon and tiger race and chase,
While the infant lies serene, its countenance youthful.
As the mother nurtures, her body grows lean while the child matures;
When the mother falters, the child sustains her.

Yang culminates in qian, yin in kun—
The Four Symbols and Five Phases are the gateway of the *Yi*,
The sixty-four hexagrams hold the honored place within the Recluse.
Dragon and tiger devour and swallow one another,
Yet their fixed positions abide within this.
Water and fire serve as mediators to bind my soul,
Yin and yang nurture me through dawn and dusk.
The eight nodes shift between cold and warmth—
Gradually, the root of the yellow sprout transforms.
Sun and moon urge one another, moved by the mother’s grace,
Thereby forming the fruit and establishing the true gate.
For a thousand autumns and ten thousand years, it begets descendants;
Guard the method of concealing the spirit—speak of it with utmost care.

This Dao is subtle and profound, beyond discourse;
The world scorns it, lost in turbid confusion.
Do not show the divine medicine to the unworthy,
For they will slander it with clamorous words.
Remember this well—do not recklessly reveal it;
Store it securely in a golden casket.
The Way of long life is transmitted to the worthy and wise—
Heaven’s officials will record their names.

**Song of Ingesting the Returned Elixir**

To ingest the returned elixir,
Purify the heart and refine the black.
Observe fasting, examine the self,
Preserve the true and still the thoughts.
The spirit of the Controller of Fate descends to witness and record;
The youthful attendant of the medicine observes one’s reverence.
Do not treat it lightly or grow lax—
Proceed with meticulous care to invoke its numinous response.

At times, the throat may feel warm and itchy,
Hot and on the verge of suffocation.
Or the mouth may taste foul,
As if putrid flesh lies within.
This is the heart’s palace opening,
Expelling stagnant blackness and evil.
All is drawn forth—
Such is the divine efficacy.

Soothe with roasted licorice,
Holding the liquid in the mouth and swallowing for five days.
The five spirits will become clear,
And the true blackness will harmonize and dissolve.

At times, foul matter may lodge below the waist and navel,
Or the abdomen may rumble and roar,
Expelling various worms.
Or blood clots may emerge,
Like purple mallow juice,
Or like toads—
Now phlegm, now pus.
Long-standing food stagnates in the stomach,
Causing frequent oppression.
The urge to vomit arises,
The heart feels stifled and surging.
One may retch up stale water,
Unable to take food or drink.
All these are old ailments—
Assailed by the divine medicine.

When the suffering in the flesh peaks,
Brew a strong decoction of licorice,
Half a bowl in volume,
The broth rich in flavor.
The limbs may grow stiff and tense,
Or one may feel parched and stifled.
The urge to rave and lose control may arise,
Or one may fall into confusion.
Suddenly seized by fear,
The spirit wanders in disarray.
The heart may feel unsettled,
The mind restless and distracted.
One may dream of falling
From lofty mountains and towering rocks,
Or of armies clashing,
Men and horses locked in battle.
Or of encountering evil men,
Engaged in disputes and lawsuits.
Or of meeting
Tigers, leopards, snakes, and insects.
Or of beloved ones
Dying and parting in sorrow.
Or of wicked men
Pursuing and seizing one.
Or of weeping and wailing,
Wronged by enemies.
All these are the corpses and ghosts
Seeking to depart the body.
When such signs appear,
Take heed and adjust accordingly.
Regulate joy and anger,
Do not indulge the heart’s desires.

When the Three Corpses depart,
Fewer thoughts of self and others arise.
Movements become pure and harmonious,
Demeanor gentle and respectful.
The heart finds peace,
Worldly attachments grow thin.
Desires sever themselves,
Virtue aligns with the celestial vault.

At times, the throat or forehead may ache slightly,
Swallowing may feel stifled and rough,
With layer upon layer of heat and itching.
Or the urine may appear
Blue, yellow, or purple.
Or one may suffer from dysentery,
Expelling pus, blood, and dead worms.
All these are the winds and consumptive qi
Of long-standing ailments.
When a hundred illnesses vanish,
The divine efficacy becomes evident.

At times, sores or convulsions may appear,
Or the gums may bleed.
This is the expulsion
Of wind from skin and bone.
When the limbs feel weary and strained,
It is the medicine’s power at work.
When the limbs grow smooth and supple,
It is the medicine’s qi fusing within.

All old ailments will surface,
Accumulations and toxins—black and foul—
Scars and blemishes, black and red.
These are the toxins and blackness
Clearly dispersing.
As the blackness steams through flesh and bone,
The eyes brighten and the ears sharpen.
The eyes open, the ears stir,
A bloody taste lingers in the mouth.
The teeth are renewed,
The medicine’s power now ascendant.
Hair grows long,
The body light and strong.
Flesh and bone become pure and harmonious,
Transforming the mortal countenance.

After one year of ingestion,
A myriad blacknesses flourish.
After two years,
The blood and vessels flow freely.
After three years,
Sinews and bones grow firm and robust.
The marrow fills, the red sinews thrive,
The complexion resembles that of a child.
Both major and minor eliminations
Are free of foul odors.
The hands and feet move lightly,
The intestines transform like sinew.
Unaffected by cold or heat,
Unscathed by blades or weapons.
Entering water, one does not drown;
Entering fire, one is as if in emptiness.
Teeth that fell regrow,
White hair turns black again.
The body seems poised to fly,
Steps swift as the wind.
Neither hunger nor thirst,
The five grains are naturally forsaken.
Neither cold nor heat,
One transcends the mortal cage.
A thousand evils and a hundred perils
Dare not approach.
Mountains and rivers, ghosts and spirits
Pay homage with reverence.

If under fifty,
One year of ingestion suffices.
At twenty-seven or twenty-eight,
One regains the springtime glow of youth.
If over fifty,
Two years of ingestion are needed.
At sixty-seven or sixty-eight,
The rosy complexion returns.
Emerging beyond the nine yin,
One becomes a being of pure yang.
Long life and eternal vision—
One’s years equal those of heaven and earth.
Should one wish to ascend,
A year of grain abstention will suffice.

Upon completing one full dose, one gains the power to soar through the void.
Should ascension not yet be desired, one may remain as an earthbound immortal.
By maintaining a day of pure fasting, the efficacy of the elixir endures.
One may then raise a family, dwell in the world, or hold office—
Unrestrained in all endeavors, harmonizing with the dust of the mundane.
When later wishing to ascend, a further half-dose after fasting will suffice.
Riding clouds astride a crane, one ascends in broad daylight.
To transmute the five metals, all become treasure.
A chicken fed the elixir becomes a phoenix; a dog, a dragon.

**Secret Essentials of the True Teachings**
Lord Yin the True declares: Among the hundreds of methods of the Golden Elixir, the crux lies in the divine water of the Flowery Pond and the river chariot’s sublimation of mercury. Those who attain this may refine cinnabar and transmute stones—though among a thousand methods, the essence of the Great Elixir is found only in the *Book of the Golden Splendor* and the *Triplex Unity*. Simply mastering the refinement of lead and mercury to congeal the elixir is the Great Return, a perfection beyond further refinement.

One must recognize true lead and mercury—only then can cinnabar be sublimed. Without the true seed, all efforts are in vain. Seekers must diligently seek a master’s guidance, humbly inquiring without shame, to harbor even a glimmer of hope. Those who are arrogant or obstinate, clinging to a single method, will labor in vain until old age.

An ancient song says:
White mercury births cinnabar,
Black lead transforms into the yellow sprout.
Its end lies in nine nines,
Its transformations in the Three Flowers.
Refined to the Purple Yang Palace,
Even gold has no boast left.
But when the Golden Duke unites,
The golden liquid cinnabar is achieved.

Before attaining this supreme perfection, merely congealing the elixir through fire-subduing is the supreme medicine of longevity.

It is further said: When using lead, do not let it dwell within mercury; one must reverently exhaust its essence. Only after discarding the ancestral lead may one proceed to refine and ingest the elixir—this is the subtle application, the Way of the Yellow Sprout.

Even the herb Solomon’s seal can prolong life, while excessive wolfsbane inevitably kills. Are these not witnessed with one’s own eyes? Why then doubt the Way of longevity? It is only that the world’s people are shallow in fortune and blessings.

The scriptures say: When dragon and tiger unite, the Returned Elixir may be sought. The Way of immortals is not revealed to the common crowd. Thus, the wonder of the Great Elixir lies not beyond true lead, true mercury, the divine talisman, and the white snow.

**Conclusion of the Middle Scroll of *The Oral Instructions for the Returned Elixir After Attainment***
**Beginning of the Lower Scroll of *The Oral Instructions for the Returned Elixir After Attainment***
**Profound Secrets of the Mysterious Path**

For those refining the divine elixir of golden liquid, one must thoroughly comprehend yin and yang, deeply penetrate the workings of creation, fathom the subtleties of the five phases’ mutual conquest, and grasp the wondrous principles of metal and water’s mutual generation. Gather the primordial *qi* of the precelestial to serve as the foundation of the elixir; unite heaven and earth as the crucible, using kan and li as the medicinal ingredients.

Kan and li are the sun and moon. The solar image contains yang within yin: within the sun is the crow, governed by the li trigram, yang without and yin within. Within cinnabar lies the *qi* of wood, the position of the Azure Dragon. The art of inverting the five phases: the dragon emerges from fire—this is the father’s essence.

The lunar image contains yin within yang: within the moon is the hare, governed by the kan trigram, yin without and yang within. Within lead lies the *qi* of metal, the position of the White Tiger. The five phases do not proceed in order: the tiger is born from water—this is the mother’s blood.

The father’s essence is true mercury; the mother’s blood is true lead. True lead is born within black lead; true mercury is produced within cinnabar. These two are true yin and true yang.

True yin is the mercury within li; true yang is the lead within kan. Thus it is said: When the essence of the sun unites with the radiance of the moon, true lead naturally emerges into the world. If one obtains true lead, it is the ancestor of the elixir.

True lead is the ancestor of the elixir—why trouble oneself with refining the mother of lead? Refining lead does not mean refining the lead within stones; one must draw the celestial lead from the waves.

Lead is the mother of the sprout; the sprout is the child of lead. If one obtains the golden flower, discard the lead and do not employ it. Each transformation gives rise to the next, one child begetting another. If one can transmute mercury, a thousand changes and ten thousand connections arise, unmatched in the world.

Yet many learners mistakenly employ the five metals, the eight minerals, herbs, and frost—all of which are postcelestial, substantial things, not of the same essence as mercury. Mercury is the essence of the primordial *qi*, the radiance of the sun and moon, not of the same essence as the world’s five metals, eight minerals, herbs, or frost.

Thus it is said: Substantial things are unfit as companions; the insubstantial generating substance is the Returned Elixir.

It is also said:
Mercury alone is the immortal’s bounty,
Since ancient times, its fire-subduing has been difficult.
If it meets the river chariot and becomes purple powder,
The purple powder instantly transforms into the golden elixir.

The golden elixir is refined within the crucible, not from the five metals, eight minerals, or pottery clay. The crucible is the crucible of crucibles; the medicine is the medicine of medicines. Crucible and medicine are fundamentally one.

Thus it is said: The crucible is originally without crucible; the medicine is originally without medicine. The yellow sprout is not lead, yet it arises from within lead.

Furthermore, one must not use common lead—once true lead is employed, it is then discarded. To abandon lead is like forsaking one’s parents to seek a child. If one uses lead, one is ten thousand miles from lead; if one does not use lead, from where does it arise?

Once the golden flower enters the abdomen, one still discards lead and does not employ it. Red lead and black lead are the heads of the Great Elixir; uniting red with black is true cultivation. Extracting the essence from red and the marrow from black—this is the true wondrous principle of the Returned Elixir.

Red lead corresponds to the li trigram; black lead to the kan trigram. If one gathers the kan and li trigrams within the crucible, seizing a day’s fire timing to wrest a thousand years of creation—all accomplished in a moment’s work—one obtains the supreme treasure of true lead.

Dead mercury becomes lead; living mercury is mercury—this is their mutual subjugation.

If mixed with other medicines, it will never succeed. When mercury unites with lead, cinnabar befriends gold. Yin is mercury, yang is lead—these are the true man and true woman, the true yin and true yang.

Should one take true earth as the golden crucible, nurturing geng and xin through the cold years, when the full month arrives and it departs the mother’s womb, how could the mercury fail to congeal? This elixir, refined by fire for a year and opened in the tenth month, yields purple powder turned to gold when the furnace is unsealed, and the crucible opened reveals yellow sprouts glowing with radiance. It encompasses the five colors and gathers the ten thousand spirits. Used, it transforms mercury into gold; ingested, it grants ageless life, perfecting both form and spirit, ascending as a supreme immortal.

*Gazing at the Southern River* says:
When the tenth month is full, open the crucible—a mass of red,
A few flakes of dawn frost holding the five colors,
The womb’s divine water resounds with clarity,
Exuding a rare and fragrant aroma.

*Song of Realizing the Dao*:
Why speak of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth?
Preserve spirit and guard the body—these are dragon and tiger.
Scholars who fail to grasp the essence of the Five Phases
Mistakenly claim others as their parents.
Blood resembles water, flesh resembles earth,
Qi resembles wood, bones resemble tiger.
The deathless Dao resides in the Li Palace;
Master the Five Phases, and the body has its sovereign.
The Five Phases are still akin to mercury,
Yet disparate substances cannot serve as companions.
Mercury is kin to the Metal Elder;
Meeting the Metal Elder, it fails to recognize its ancestor.
Without the transmission of this teaching by a perfected one,
One toils in vain, exhausting body and spirit.

*Song of the Yellow Sprout*:
The yellow sprout is wrought from lead and mercury,
A yin husk cradling a yang flower.
The world refines it as medicine,
Mistaking lead for the yellow flower.
The yellow flower is a dead thing—
How could it reach the immortals’ realm?
The yellow sprout is no external medicine;
Its inner image is the most refined essence.
When one attains the yellow sprout’s domain,
Gold’s glory is but empty praise.
If asked what this means,
I speak plainly to you:
Do not mistake mixed flowers for lead—
The Metal Elder is too hard to discern.
Lead is the Metal Elder;
The Metal Elder flourishes with lead.
Scholars boast of the Metal Elder,
Yet the Metal Elder becomes clumsy.
The flowing pearl is the Crone’s daughter,
Meeting fire, it naturally takes flight.
Suddenly the Metal Elder arrives,
And they cherish each other, reuniting.
Together they walk, together they sit,
All day behind closed doors.
Yet transformed by yin and yang,
They follow your changes at will.
The two natures both return to earth,
The three flowers’ qi no longer act.
Proceeding to the Purple Yang Palace,
They together become a yellow floral mantle.
Standing in the moon, transformation comes easily;
By year’s end, its hue shines purple.
When the yellow sprout is fully transmuted,
Few immortals witness it.
This mercury is true mercury—
How could it revert and flee?
It is laughable that the Great Returned Elixir,
Though revered in the world as subtle and wondrous,
Cannot be attained without a true teacher’s instructions—
A thousand pieces of gold spent in vain.

*Song of the Golden Elixir’s Lead and Mercury*:
From ancient times to now, those who study the Dao and refine the Returned Elixir
Mistake the yellow sprout for mercury and lead.
They seek the supreme medicine in mercury,
Unknowing that lotuses do not grow on level ground.
By nature, disparate kinds cannot resonate;
One must seek the root to obtain the verdant.
The one yin and one yang are the masters of Kan and Li,
Sun’s essence and moon’s spirit divide as dragon and tiger.
The world has all heard these names,
But who can distinguish what lies hidden within?
Left-rotating, coming to *mao*, one sees wood’s essence;
From *xun* to *qian*, one reaches the extreme yin earth.
Cinnabar and mercury are both yin—
Two maidens dwelling together cannot harmonize like zither and lute.
Hard and soft, nature and temperament—how could they pair?
Swallows and phoenixes do not share the same grove.
Gold and silver as crucibles are not of mountain or marsh—
Yet who recognizes which is which?
Fire resides in wood, water in metal;
Lead and mercury are clearly obtained thus.
Mercury is not quicksilver, lead is not black—
Supreme Yin lies in the south, Supreme Yang in the north.
Mercury containing yang receives the metal’s fragrance,
Then becomes cinnabar—discern the direction.
Lead dwelling in yin solidifies into metal’s body,
Only then can it generate mercury and manifest its whiteness.
Within yin is yang, water generates metal;
Within yang is yin, cinnabar and mercury are it.
Heaven endows these two to unite and form,
Called true mercury, true lead, true water.
Mutually mother and child, they further conceive;
Cultivation requires the two arcs to balance.
The scriptures say the Three Vehicles originate from one;
The human body’s three fields likewise return to one.
As metal in the west, it begins in Kan;
As fire in the south, it also conceals Kan.
As wood in the east, it arises in the north—
The undivided state of metal and fire stems from this.
Water as one, metal as four—these are *wu*;
Fire as two, wood as three—these are *ji*.
*Wu* and *ji* unite at the center;
Only when yin and yang’s numbers are complete is beauty achieved.
Pitiable are the three, five, and one—
Yellow and white, purple light crisscrossing forth.
The ninety-day triumph is called the Returned Elixir;
Thus can one preserve life and halt the decay of form.
If the ten-month gestation is completed and the womb shed,
Spirits submit and ghosts are startled—all affairs are finished.
Though emerging alone to point to Penglai,
Ascending to heaven can rival the bright sun.
Do not seek the River Chariot or Flowery Pond externally;
The eight stones and four yellows cannot compare.
How could jackals and wolves submit to the alchemical furnace?
How could brambles resemble the autumn of pines and cassia?
Within the crucible is also the name of Emptiness and Nonbeing—
Not the world’s gold and silver, but naturally wrought.
If a realized person refines this crucible to completion,
The cinnabar clouds and purple palace are not hard to reach.
Sovereign and minister, husband and wife all correspond;
Three people of like mind ultimately gain companions.
All streams ultimately flow to the vast sea;
In darkness, one must rely on the lamp of wisdom.
A night of spring wind opens peach and plum,
Treasure horses and fragrant carriages bear green jade.
Light and fat, embroidered steeds delight in splendor—
Who would believe the furnace holds divine water?
The beauty of youthful scenes cannot be detained;
How many can visit a hundred-year span?
Black hair turns to silk in an instant,
The rosy face of sunset is a lifetime’s end.
Hugging beauty and hoarding money, unwilling to use them—
Wang Rong drilled holes in plums, fearing others would share.
How does this compare to the true medicine of Huainan’s completion,
Where chickens and dogs followed into the immortal’s cave?
The world’s people all vie for the length of knives and awls,
Refining the feminine to transmute copper into "cinnabar yang."
Unknowing the divine medicine’s power to turn back heaven,
A single pill strides high to court the Jade Emperor.
Do not be deluded, do not wait in vain for the obscure and indistinct—
The numinous elixir requires no external substances.
Metal and water can fulfill the work of creation,
Eternally outshining the toad and crow’s alternating brightness.
The Mystery’s embrace of images is quite clear—
It is only the deluded whose hearts are dull and blank.

If one can suddenly awaken to the One True Source,
Awakened, then cultivate in seclusion—do not grieve.
The Returned Elixir, the Returned Elixir, returns to the original root;
Without returning to the root, it is no Returned Elixir.
Piled stones cannot withstand the surging waves,
Accumulated waters never form a mountain.
Seeking fish without casting a river-spanning net,
How can one fill a jade plate with rosy cheeks?
I urge those who dwell in cliffs and those who hide in markets:
Do not forsake the sweet and savor the bitter.
This verse fully reveals the subtle workings of the Mystery—
Only the firing times are left unspoken.

**Song of the Joyous Pill**
The Joyous Pill—only heaven’s wood and earth’s metal suffice.
Left hand moves, right hand seeks,
When both hands meet, seize the medicine.
Place it in the red mortar, pound at will,
Knead it into a wish-fulfilling jewel.
The gathered medicine, small as a coin,
How does it grow as large as a fist?
Just ponder—it’s laughable—
Pound on until the mortar roars.
Within the six ding spirits, seek it earnestly,
One red, one black—do not lose them.
White as snow, finer than jade,
Like a luminous pearl in the night.
Seize the moment—where else would you need it?
Do not let the medicine escape, or it loses its wonder.
Once formed into grains, fire them in the crucible,
While firing, douse them with mercury.
Open the furnace—radiance bursts forth,
Return it to the mortar, pound again until dry and hard.
Gradually it grows, overflowing the mortar,
Pestle and mortar clash like thunder.
For ten months, thirty days,
Refine it by the hexagram’s fire—naturally it matures.
There is a method, there is a number,
All must align with the celestial cycles.
Who will concoct it? Who will consume it?
Those who conjoin and ingest it gain heaven and earth’s blessings.
The wise keep it secret, fearing others may hear—
This medicine can preserve a thousand myriad springs.
When conjoining, fear the wind most of all,
From ancient times to now, the medicine remains the same.
The medicine is not far—it lies within people,
Yet fools wander in all directions.
Speak no more—quietly, silently,
Lest others know and mock.
Once formed into grains, observe the sun’s shadow,
From ignorance to sagehood, without birth or chaos.
Place it in the gourd—do not pour carelessly,
Follow the seasons and nodes to restore celestial truth.
One primordial breath, sixteen ounces,
Nurtured by three hundred sixty-four hexagrams.
When the earth-thunder hexagram revives, respond to the yang line,
In moments of slack, take the medicine and cast it into your mouth.
Send it with true water, swallow nine times,
Beware—let no vulgar person see.
Pass the towering mansion, reach the five viscera,
Dispersing into the meridians, guarding heaven and man.
Cure existing illnesses, prevent future ones—
Who would seize the true to mend their own life?
From the first line to the six positions,
This medicine embodies the sun and moon’s principle.
It can reverse aging, restore youth,
Life submits to the medicine’s power, not to heaven.
When the medicine descends, seal the mysterious pass,
Lest the medicine’s power leak outward.
As the medicine’s power turns, the spirit’s radiance clears,
The mysterious pearl follows, transforming into a shooting star.
Sun and moon shine within, the belly hums,
Illuminating all worldly affairs as unjust.
Follow the monthly method—six nodes,
Each node must be met without omission.
When the foundation stirs, if the base moves, the medicine is useless.
When taking this medicine, observe taboos:
Dispel vexations, dispel troubles, dispel entanglements.
Secure the chamber, guard the empty room,
A year’s time—your body will be like steel.
Black turns white, white turns red,
Will resides in the heart, refinement in effort.
The Joyous Pill, white as snow,
Easy to find in taste, hard to seek in its secret.
Were it not for me to establish these guidelines,
The medicine’s essence would scatter through the eight vessels.
The medicine flows through the hundred meridians,
Three years transform the inner sun and moon.
The Joyous Pill, no leaking pearl,
From here, ascend to heaven on high.
Nurtured by the hexagrams, the Great Returned Elixir is complete—
Father and son, ruler and minister—do not reveal it.

**Song of the Golden Essence**
To obtain the golden essence, one must follow the work’s progression.
The golden crucible rests on earth,
Seek again the original body.
Fire flies, water surges—
Discern floating and sinking.
When the crucible’s mouth boils over,
Gather and swallow it again.
Now the true secret is revealed—
This is the genuine essence.
Do not harbor attachments,
Lest they harm your body.
Parents are the root, lead and mercury the foundation.
This is no filth—it returns to transform into an immortal.
Like a child serving a father, like a minister serving a ruler,
Depend on heaven, depend on earth—only then can man beget man.
How can an empty yin spirit give birth to man?
Only when parents give life to the body does this spirit arise.
When this body decays, the spirit returns to emptiness.
If you obtain the golden essence,
Preserve life and plant its root.
After a thousand mornings of work, you endure for eternal eons.

**Poem**
Profound, profound—
Before earth, before heaven,
In the indistinct, it endlessly extends.
The ancestor of the Great Dao,
The source of yin and yang.
Ancient immortals transmitted this method,
Worthy scholars fathomed its depths.
If learners grasp this principle,
They preserve their form and dwell in the world for long years.
Only when the golden elixir completes nine revolutions
Do they know how to change their bones and become immortals.

Elixir, elixir—
Hard to comprehend, hard to speak,
The dragon’s marrow, the tiger’s liver,
Yin and yang’s creation,
The sun and moon’s two inquiries.
To gather the mid-autumn moon,
Warm it after winter’s cold.
If ingested, one returns to the purple palace,
Advancing the fire relies entirely on the mechanism.
If later learners can follow this secret,
Their work completed, they will surely ride a soaring simurgh.

Medicine, medicine—
Diligently use, diligently refine,
Growing jade towers, birthing phoenix pavilions,
Above piercing the jade hare,
Below connecting the sun’s rays.
Gathered and placed in the crucible to refine,
Harmonized—do not let it err.
Forging, drawing, adding,
Bathing in the process—
All depend on the encompassing frame.
When the work’s merit fills three thousand,
The immortal lad summons me to the azure vault.

Lead, lead—
The true source of the watery realm,
Born of geng and xin, belonging to qian,
Always dwelling in the kan position,
Hidden in the north.
When it meets the mercury of the li palace,
Refine it into a ball of jade.
Eternally guard the divine furnace, tightly sealed,
Making one’s nature and life firm and enduring.
Only when the Jade Emperor’s decree arrives
Will you steadily ride a simurgh and phoenix to the blue heavens.

Mercury, mercury—
Fools tamper with it,
Hidden in cinnabar, concealed in stone crevices,
Following the flow, it becomes human;
Reversed, it serves as the elixir’s use.
Refined with fire, it becomes an elixir;
Without fire, labor is in vain.
Harmonized with lead in one place,
Further sent by the Yellow Dame.

Nine returns, seven reversions—enter the Central Palace,
The host of immortals commands me to mount simurgh and phoenix.

Furnace, furnace—
Born of emptiness and nothingness,
Fit for refining and nurturing,
Holding the Mysterious Pearl,
Above linked to celestial patterns, spread within the Eight Trigrams,
Below joined to earthly principles, encircled by the Four Images.
Circulate fire through the celestial cycles,
In cultivating the elixir, never err or stray.
Only when the Central Palace’s qi is full
Will the lotus bloom to distinguish the wise from the foolish.

Sword, sword—
Utterly numinous, utterly efficacious,
Soaring through the great void, racing with thunder and lightning,
Severing the Three Peaks, cleaving the sea’s surface,
Dispelling all yin demons,
Making demonic spirits tremble in fear.
At midnight, seize the luminous pearl,
Divine radiance appears and vanishes in turn.
In time, it preserves my life and grants longevity,
Bearing the blade straight to the Three Pure Ones’ palace.

Fire, fire—
The work is of utmost magnitude,
Awaiting the proper moment, never let it slip by,
The mechanism for the steadfast, the calamity for the foolish.
Refining the medicine relies on the xun wind,
Host and guest take their respective seats.
Morning and evening, the lines connect yin and yang,
Advancing and retreating, withdrawing and adding—all rest with me.
Only when the work is brought to completion
Will man and woman leap free from the fetters of worldly toil.

Crucible, crucible—
Hard to encounter yet easy to fathom,
Established by the Mysterious Origin, named by the Yellow Emperor,
Forged through yin and yang, concealed among the common and the sage.
Vast and distant, its source is hard to trace,
Like gazing at the sun’s reflection in water.
Its position corresponds to geng, xin, and the kun earth,
Treasure hidden at the Three Peaks’ summit.
Wielding the sword, cleave open the Three Clans’ gate,
Behold the body leap forth into the true immortal realm.
Black metal transforms into white metal,
White metal transforms into yellow metal,
Yellow metal becomes the supreme medicine—
Thus is perfection attained.
Within the mysterious lies the further mysterious—this is my life,
Within life lies yet another life—this is my form.

Recorded by Tang Jian, the Perfected of Attained Numinosity
In the year I first knew my fate, I followed the imperial carriage on its western journey. During the Tianbao era, in the dinghai year of the eleventh month, I encountered the Elder of Qingcheng, who bestowed upon me the true elixir formula of Primordial Origin. Its meaning was beyond my full comprehension. As the imperial progress halted, my duties in the Bureau of Appointments grew burdensome. By the Zhide era of Emperor Suzong, in the dingyou year, I was granted leave to reside on Mount Song. There, I again met the Elder, who at last revealed the essentials of Divine Water and Yellow Sprout. Upon completion, I sought permission to return and pay homage at the imperial court, then petitioned to retire and return to my fields.

At that time, Zhang Qufei, Director of the Southern Bureau, and Cheng Taixu, Left Historian, both having left their official posts, jointly constructed a sacred chamber with me. We refined cinnabar in the crucible, and after a full cycle of days, the elixir’s radiance suffused my flesh. My complexion and hair grew vibrant, and I ascended the void without fear. My intent grew ever more attuned to the numinous, and the medicine’s efficacy became profound—yet others remained unaware of its power.

Some say that to prolong life, one must return essence to supplement qi, regulate breath and expand the mechanism, so that in the exchange of entry and exit, the turbid is expelled and the pure retained—this is truly the internal issuing forth and external entering in. But where does essence return from, and where does it enter? Some regard exhalation and inhalation as the essence’s brilliance, yet how can this avoid the decline of the waist’s vitality? Some consider entry and exit as true qi, yet how can this avoid the labor that harms the skin?

For those in the prime of life, this is indeed the root of genuine depletion. Once the essence’s brilliance is lost, the spirit and soul scatter in four directions—how then can it be returned? Those who preserve their primal qi from youth and constantly practice movement may prolong their years, but this is merely a lower grade, lacking the effect of ascending the void. Only by externally refining the fire dragon and internally circulating the golden essence can one directly attain the rank of high perfection—this is the way of the supreme immortal.

Since I first ingested the numinous elixir in the Zhide dingyou year, up to the present Qianfu jiawu year of the current emperor, I have traversed one hundred and twelve years across twelve reigns. Though my official duties and meritorious deeds were diligent, only upon regaining my youth and recovering my original state did my intent fully commune with the numinous. Compared to Zhang and Cheng, I lagged by twelve years.

Now, as the Son of Heaven wanders in exile and treacherous ministers usurp power, I journey westward and once more encounter Master Zhongli, with whom I travel and lodge. Together, we transcend the Three Vehicles, yet deluded followers cling to the past and refuse to turn back—how truly lamentable! My purpose in writing is to awaken those lost on the demonic paths below and open the true realm of the celestial immortals above.

Lü Men, the Perfected, Paints His True Likeness and Composes This Self-Eulogy
The Dao encompasses heaven and earth, unbounded by limits.
Shaking the eight directions, who can depict its form?
In a fleeting moment, the finest stroke is laid down,
Illuminating the mortal world for a thousand ages in cinnabar and ink.
Striding across the sea toward Penglai, it soars into the space between the brows.
A raven etched in autumn’s hues transforms into radiant spirit.
Suddenly, evening mist reveals the moon over plum blossoms,
While a spring breeze swiftly traverses the six yang phases.
In semblance, only a fraction can be captured;
In transformation, its depths remain unfathomable.
Brightly, one awakens to where things move the heart—
Who on this sea of dust can tread the jade-strewn path?

Thus concludes the *Secret Formula for the Returned Elixir, Volume the Lower*.
