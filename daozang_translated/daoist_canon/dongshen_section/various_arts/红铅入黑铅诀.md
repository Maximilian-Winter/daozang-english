**The Red Lead Entering Black Lead Formula**

True gold forges the divine chamber; its form resembles a parrot.
The red lead is concealed within the chamber, sealed with native earth to close its seams,
then encased entirely in a layer one finger thick.
Place it within the crucible.
The lower crucible is made of native earth, the upper cauldron of true gold.
Seal the outer seams and suspend it within the furnace.
Apply water and fire, and in ninety days it will be complete.

Black lead is called "precelestial lead." When native black lead is placed in an ash pit,
its black husk is stripped away, leaving it utterly refined—this is the "nine-times-smelted essence."
Its transformations are boundless, its marvelous applications without limit.

**The Crucible Formula**

Native earth may resemble greasy yellow wax or be dark greenish-black.
When ground and washed, it may contain grit or sand,
or resemble sesame seeds of varying sizes.
Some yellow earth, when crushed, reveals cinnabar—this earth is most potent.
Pound and sift it, then knead it into clay, thoroughly and skillfully, to craft the crucible.
Its total length is one foot two inches, its circumference one foot five inches.
The hollow center is five inches wide, the walls one inch and one *fen* thick.
The upper and lower openings are straight, with lips like an overturned wok,
the circumference measuring three feet two inches.
The central cross-section is one foot wide, the rim encircling it two inches high.
Water enters the crucible to a depth of eight inches.

**The Mercury Entering the River Chariot Formula**

Combine half a *jin* of yang mercury with eight *liang* of yin mercury,
place them in the crucible chamber, and seal according to the method.
Select the four destructive phases for restraint.
On a yang day at a yang hour, apply the direct talisman.
Position the fire one inch beneath the crucible’s base, cover it, and activate.
Constantly conceal it with straw ash, burying it firmly.
When the direct talisman is in effect, follow the six-phase advance-and-retreat formula.
Use native earth for the divine chamber and true gold within it,
then pour mercury to seal it securely.
Place it in the crucible cauldron and apply water and fire to transform the River Chariot.

Combine half a *jin* of yang mercury with eight *liang* of common mercury,
place them in the crucible cauldron, and seal.
Construct an altar ring and bury it in ash, with the ash five inches thick.
Direct the fire upward from the top.
Begin with five *liang*; after one *fu* period, add thirteen *liang*;
after another *fu* period, increase to one *jin*.
One version: Follow this weight precisely, applying it day and night for thirty days.
Take two *liang* to refine one *jin* of mercury, yielding two *liang* of "white-way silver."
Then use it to further refine one *jin* of copper into "great silver."

**The Crucible Cauldron**

Knead native earth into clay and shape it like a parrot:
seven inches long, five inches wide.
While still moist, cut it into sections and dry them in the sun.
Each opening is three inches wide, tapering gradually to a point two inches deep at the base.
The exterior is also parrot-shaped.
Craft the two halves with interlocking male and female lips, ensuring no misalignment.
This crucible is suitable for both civil and martial applications.

**Qi and Fire Timing**

At midnight (zi): three *liang*
At early morning (yin): four *liang*
At mid-morning (mao): five *liang*
At early afternoon (si): six *liang*
One version: At noon (wu): six *liang*
At early evening (shen): five *liang*
At mid-evening (you): four *liang*
One version: At early night (hai): three *liang*

**Golden Liquid Fire Timing**

The fire count is one *jin*, and the water count is also one *jin*.
For every one part fire, there are fifteen parts water; for every six parts water, there are ten parts fire.
When the fire count is clear, water recedes; when water rises, fire diminishes.
The six hours of *zi, chou, yin, mao, chen,* and *si* belong to yang and are the time for advancing fire.
The six hours of *wu, wei, shen, you, xu,* and *hai* belong to yin and are the time for retreating fire.
Divide one *jin* into 384 *zhu*.
For advance and retreat within a single day, adjust by sixty-four *zhu* per hour—
advance must be steady.
One version: Retreat should also be gradual, carefully regulating the balance.
With single-minded focus, refine the returning elixir.

**The Direct Talisman Six-Phase Advance-and-Retreat Formula**

The moon has six phases, each lasting five days.
Two *qi* divide into two and a half days, thirty hours per *qi*.
Two *qi* make one phase, six phases make one month.
Each month, replace the crucible’s earth and divine chamber.
After nine months, the nine crucibles are complete.
One version: Up to ten crucibles may be used as desired, whether replacing the crucible or not.
One version: The first turning is most wondrous.

**First Month, First Day:**
First phase: Ignite with one *liang* of fire.
By the second and a half day (thirty hours), advance to two *liang*; by sixty hours, maintain.
Sixth day:
Second phase: Begin with three *liang* at thirty hours, advance to four *liang* by sixty hours.
Eleventh day:
Third phase: Begin with five *liang* at thirty hours, advance to six *liang* by sixty hours.
Sixteenth day:
Fourth phase: Begin with six *liang* at thirty hours, retreat to five *liang* by sixty hours.
Twenty-first day:
Fifth phase: Begin retreating with four *liang* at thirty hours, reduce to three *liang* by sixty hours.
Twenty-sixth day:
Sixth phase: Begin retreating with two *liang* at thirty hours, reduce to one *liang* by sixty hours.

**Second Month, First Day:**
First phase: Ignite with two *liang* of fire.
By the second and a half day (thirty hours), advance to three *liang*; by sixty hours, maintain.
For each subsequent month when replacing the crucible,
increase the fire by one *liang* per phase compared to the previous month.
By the ninth month:
First phase: Begin with nine *liang*, advance to ten *liang* by thirty hours, maintain by sixty hours.
Second phase: Eleven *liang* at thirty hours, advance to twelve *liang* by sixty hours.
Third phase: Thirteen *liang* at thirty hours, advance to fourteen *liang* by sixty hours.
Fourth phase: Fourteen *liang* at thirty hours, retreat to thirteen *liang* by sixty hours.
Fifth phase: Retreat to twelve *liang* at thirty hours, reduce to eleven *liang* by sixty hours.
Sixth phase: Retreat to ten *liang* at thirty hours, reduce to nine *liang* by sixty hours, completing the cycle.
From the tenth month onward, maintain this pattern.
One version: Use the ninth month’s fire timing for advance and retreat as the standard, regardless of year or month.

The regulation of fire’s advance and retreat requires the addition of well-burned charcoal, always exposing the fire’s surface to align with the prescribed weight. Below are the formulas for ingesting elixirs and refining mercury by weight:

After fifteen days of guarding and circulating, one *liang* of medicine transmutes one *jin* of mercury into the White Way.
After thirty days of guarding and circulating, two *liang* may be ingested.
After one year of guarding and circulating, half a *liang* of medicine transmutes one *jin* of mercury into the White Way. Ingesting one and a half *liang* wards off all illnesses.
After two years of guarding and circulating, one *fen* of medicine transmutes one *jin* of mercury into the White Way. Three *fen* may be ingested, and one may also ingest half a *liang*.
After three years of guarding and circulating, a *daogui* of medicine refines one *jin* of mercury into the Red Way. One *fen* may be ingested to abide in the world without death.
After five years of guarding and circulating, a *daogui* of medicine transmutes one *jin* of iron and mercury into the Red Way. Ingest seven grains the size of sesame seeds.
After nine years of guarding and circulating, the method is perfected, enabling the transmutation of the Five Metals, Eight Stones, tiles, and pebbles into treasures of their original colors. Ingesting three grains expels the Three Corpses and Nine Worms.

One version states: Attaining longevity without death extends not only to humans—birds, dogs, and livestock that ingest it also become immortal.

**Method of Ingestion:**
Form the medicine into pills using dense wood, the size of sesame seeds. Ingest according to the prescribed weight each year. On the meeting day of the Eight Nodes and *jiazi*, hold the medicine, kneel, face the sun, recite the invocation to the Heavenly Perfected, and ingest it.

**Formula for Transmuting Mercury with Medicine:**
Grind the mercury and medicine together, place them in a crucible, and cover with a small amount of medicine. Seal the top with a pottery vessel, wrap the sides with damp paper, and set it in fine ash. Apply fire weighing half a *jin* from a distance for the duration of cooking one meal, then gradually increase the fire for half a day until the contents glow red. Soon, they will harden into a mass; subdue the fire and fan it.

One version: Smelt and solidify into treasure.

**Formulas for Transmutation and Refining Stubborn Substances:**
According to the years of guarding and circulating, use the appropriate amount of medicine to refine mercury by weight into gold and silver. Further transmute copper and *shushi* into "great silver," using two *liang* of mercury-silver per *jin*. The mercury-silver may then be reused; guard and circulate it as medicine for one year to cut off the original mercury’s influence.

One version:
After one year of guarding and circulating, use three *liang* of medicine to refine one *jin* of mercury into the White Way.
After two years of guarding and circulating, use two *liang* of medicine to refine one *jin* of mercury into the White Way.
After three years of guarding and circulating, use one *liang* of medicine to refine one *jin* of mercury into the White Way.

**Formula for Utilizing Refined Mercury in Yellow and White Alchemy:**
Place two portions of mercury into a cauldron, seal it with a clay ring, and bury it in ash with the opening facing upward. The ash should be five *cun* thick. Apply fire from above.
Begin with five *liang*, increase to seven *liang* after one *fu* period, then to twelve *liang* after another *fu* period, and finally to one *jin*. After eight *fu* periods, use a martial fire on all sides of the cauldron until it glows red. After half a day, open it: one *liang* of medicine transmutes one *jin* of mercury into the White Way.
Replace the medicine in the crucible and apply one *jin* of fire day and night for one year: half a *liang* of medicine transmutes one *jin* of mercury into the White Way.
Replace the crucible again and apply one *jin* of fire day and night for one year: half a *liang* of medicine transmutes one *jin* of mercury into the White Way.
Replace the crucible and guard it with one *jin* of fire for two years: one and a half *fen* of medicine transmutes one *jin* of mercury into the White Way.
Replace the crucible and guard it for two years: one *fen* of medicine transmutes one *jin* of mercury into the White Way. The crucible must be replaced each year, following the method above. Transmute according to the years and prescribed weights, and all will become treasures.
