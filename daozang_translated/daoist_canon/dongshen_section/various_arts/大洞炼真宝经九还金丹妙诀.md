**The Wondrous Secrets of the *Great Cavern Scripture of Refining the True Treasure***

**Scripture Title:** *Wondrous Secrets of the Great Cavern Scripture of Refining the True Treasure*
Composed by Chen Shaowei, a Daoist of Mount Heng during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang. Recorded in the *New Tang Book·Treatise on Arts and Letters*. The author claimed to have encountered an immortal in the Yellow Dragon Grotto, who bestowed upon him the essential secrets of divine cinnabar. He thus expounded the *Seven Reversions of Divine Cinnabar* in seven chapters and the *Supreme Secrets of the Golden Elixir* in two sections, accompanied by a preface and discourse. Later disciples divided this work into two parts, nearly two fascicles. Here, they are combined into one.

### *Wondrous Secrets of the Nine-Return Golden Elixir of the Great Cavern Scripture of Refining the True*
Composed by Chen Shaowei, Perfected of Mount Heng, styled Ziming.

The Reverted Elixir fundamentally arises from the essence of the Nine Yangs, receiving the twenty-four Perfected. True Water and True Fire embrace within and without, transforming the Five Spirits. The Five Spirits circulate qi, accumulating into cinnabar; the cinnabar coalesces into the elixir. When the accumulated qi reaches its utmost, it is called the Great Return Elixir of Purple Splendor and Crimson Flower.

The secrets of the Great Return Elixir have been transmitted from master to master through oral instructions, with sacred texts concealed in grotto-heavens and golden tablets hidden in immortal capitals. Fearing the severance of the Dao’s source, immortals expounded and elucidated these hidden words, leaving them to be passed down through the ages. Thus, later seekers of brilliance and talent, though they diligently explore the obscure and toil for years, ultimately fail to comprehend. Gradually, they sink into delusion, their forms decaying and spirits dissipating, their corporeal souls transforming into demonic specters—how lamentable!

Yet the operation of the Great Dao depends on single-minded devotion. Through devoted and adaptable practice, merit must culminate in the refinement of mercury. The essential subtleties of refining mercury are fully recorded in two chapters. Within these two chapters, nine grades are distinguished:

The **upper three grades** involve extracting mercury from cinnabar, refining mercury to incorporate gold, and compounding the medicine with gold, as detailed in the seven chapters.

The **middle three grades** briefly describe the gold of the Five Stones, the subjugation and refinement of the Four Yellows, and the transformation of Yang gold.

The **lower three grades** concern the harmonization of the Great Elixir, the furnace and crucible, the firing times, and the secrets of elixir formation and verification of the True.

All are enumerated within the nine grades of the two chapters.

### **Chapter on Verifying Grades and Embracing the Origin**

The *Great Cavern Scripture of Refining the True Treasure* conceals the secrets of True Lead and True Mercury. The secret of True Mercury lies in extracting mercury from the upper-grade luminous cinnabar, then further combining it with the qi of internal Water and Fire—hence it is called "True." From one catty of luminous cinnabar, fourteen taels of mercury are contained.

#### **First Grade: Extracting Mercury from Cinnabar**
**Method for Extracting Mercury:**
First, take a stalk of bamboo with dense nodes, leaving three intact. Bore a hole in the upper node, large enough to fit a pellet. In the middle node, make a small hole the size of a chopstick tip, where the mercury will flow down. First, line the upper part of the middle node with two layers of thick wax paper. Then, finely grind the cinnabar and place it inside the bamboo tube, tightly binding the tube with hemp. Steam it for one day.

Afterward, coat the tube with yellow mud, about three *fen* thick, and bury it in the earth so that the tube is level with the ground. Pack the earth tightly around the tube to prevent qi leakage. Then, pile firewood above it and burn it for one cycle, ensuring the fire penetrates the upper node of the tube. The mercury will flow out into the lower node, without the slightest loss.

If the fire is too weak, the mercury will not fully emerge. If the residue remains heavy and dark purple, repeat the process until the mercury reaches the full measure. For red horse-teeth cinnabar, white horse-teeth cinnabar, and purple divine cinnabar, the extraction method is the same. Other methods of flying and extracting mercury result in significant loss, but this extraction secret is the most wondrous. All are listed in the upper grades of this chapter.

#### **Second Grade: Refining Mercury, Incorporating Gold, and Producing Cinnabar**
Though mercury is extracted from cinnabar of the same kind, it cannot immediately be combined with gold to transform into cinnabar; otherwise, the cinnabar will not manifest, and the seven chapters remain incomplete. The secret of incorporating gold to transform cinnabar lies in refining the mercury.

**Method for Refining Mercury:**
Take one catty of mercury and three taels of sulfur. First, grind them into powder and place them in a porcelain bowl over a low fire. Gradually add the mercury, stirring rapidly to form green sand. Then, transfer it into a porcelain jar with a capacity of one *sheng*. Seal the exterior of the jar with yellow mud, about two *fen* thick, and cover it tightly. Place it in a furnace and surround it with one catty of charcoal, firing it for three days. Ensure the jar is encircled by one catty of charcoal on all sides.

After three days, apply a strong fire, using ten catties of charcoal divided into two portions. Each time, add five catties of charcoal to heat the jar. If a green flame emerges, quickly seal it with thin mud to prevent the flame from escaping. Cease when the charcoal is exhausted. Once cooled, open it—the mercury will have transformed into purple cinnabar, without the slightest deficiency.

Then, take one catty of black lead, melt it into a liquid in a crucible. Finely grind the purple cinnabar and add it to the molten lead. Remove the fire and stir rapidly to combine them into sand. Place it in the crucible, grind it finely, and cover it with salt about two *fen* thick, pressing it firmly. Apply a strong fire to fly it for half a day, and the divine mercury will emerge without loss.

Following the seven chapters, repeatedly incorporate and transform it to produce cinnabar from gold. For the second reversion, transforming into treasure cinnabar, the method uses mercury twice: first, burn it with sulfur to form cinnabar, then incorporate it with lead twice, extracting the mercury again to add gold and transform into cinnabar. For the second reversion of flower cinnabar, mercury is used three times in burning and extraction. For the fourth reversion, producing wondrous cinnabar, mercury is used four times in extraction and burning.

For the fifth reversion, transforming into numinous cinnabar, mercury is used in five cycles of extraction and refinement. For the sixth reversion, producing divine cinnabar, mercury must undergo six cycles of burning and extraction. For the seventh reversion, yielding the profound and true crimson radiance cinnabar, mercury follows the previous pattern of seven cycles: first, combine it with sulfur to burn into purple cinnabar, then use black lead seven times to extract the numinous mercury. In each cycle of burning, three *liang* of sulfur are used, while for each extraction of mercury, one *jin* of black lead is employed. The fire timing for each cycle of burning and extraction follows the earlier method.

In these cycles of burning, extraction, and transformation, the essence of water and fire is contained within, aligning with the grand reckoning of the seven chapters. Naturally, the three luminaries—water, fire, and metal—converge in their qi, uniting in essence to transform and verify the true.

**Chapter Three: Refining Gold and Combining Medicinal Ingredients**

Now, the yang spirit of the primordial, when encountered by yin qi, submits and takes form as po, called *dui* gold. *Dui* gold reveals its yin substance yet retains the essence of the medicine, gradually dispelling its stagnant qi. As numinous mercury is incorporated and transformed, its radiance steadily increases, reverting turbidity to clarity, thereby embodying the true yang. In refining gold and combining medicinal ingredients, one exhausts the true to unite with the primordial, enabling its numinous efficacy to permeate the seven chapters.

Malachite and azurite embody the qi of *jia* and *yi*, the essence of red gold, crystallizing and receiving their yin numen to undergo transformation. Their function is to transmute mercury into gold, which, after prolonged refinement, is named "autumn stone"—a hidden name for gold—akin to cinnabar. Cinnabar is also called "autumn stone."

Azurite is found in Shu *chuan*, Wei *zhou*, E *zhou*, and Shi Xing, though initially only red gold emerges. Over the years, as it ages, it evolves from treasure to void, and from void to *ceng*, hence the name *ceng*. Its form resembles *huang lian*, with clusters linked in succession.

Moreover, it resembles earthworm castings, with squared edges and a deep hue akin to Persian indigo, growing in layered strata. When struck, it rings with the sound of gold—this marks its authenticity.

Azure malachite resembles a bayberry; when freshly extracted from the mine and broken open, it contains water, which dries over time, leaving behind a radiance like golden stars. It grows near springs, perpetually retaining moisture and absorbing the utmost yin qi. Its efficacy parallels that of nitre, though this remains little known.

*Xuan-ying* originates as brine from halite, which seeps into the earth over time, descending to the water table and congealing into a form resembling tortoiseshell, its color a translucent white.

The liquid cinnabar of Yi *zhou*, tinged with red and luminous, is of the highest grade. That from Pu *zhou* is of secondary efficacy. Its power subdues volatile gold and, when combined with nitre, rivals that of azurite. It is called *hua-shi* ("stone-transformer") for its ability to dissolve and transmute minerals—an essence of the utmost yin, the numinous essence of extreme yin. It can restrain and transform the most yang of metals and stones, its alchemical potency harmonizing with *xuan-ying* to achieve profound efficacy.

*Shi-ling* is formed from the essence of *kun* and *kan*, the qi of extreme yin, crystallizing into squared, angular slabs with a lustrous whiteness akin to halite. Its taste is slightly blander than granular salt. Its function is to subdue yang essence and neutralize the toxic potency of igneous stones. It also rivals sulfur in transmutative refinement, enhancing the luminosity of metallic essence and dispelling stagnant qi. Within the seven chapters, it serves as an auxiliary agent.

Horse-tooth nitre, likewise a quintessence of extreme yin, resembles frozen water stone and is found in Shu *chuan*. Its efficacy also subdues yang essence and dissolves the qi of igneous stones. Used alone, its restraining power is modest, but combined with rock salt, its yin toxicity becomes formidable.

Northern Court cinnabar is imbued with the qi of yin stones yet contains the essence of yang toxicity. It can corrode and degrade the five mineral metals, each effect manifesting according to its inherent nature. Its potency rivals that of sulfur, dispelling impurities and augmenting yang—its efficacy is most pronounced. Its raw form appears as translucent, pale red granules, with the most luminous specimens being superior. In the seven chapters, it serves as an auxiliary, guiding the essence of yang metals to shatter yin corporeality. When combined with *da-peng* cinnabar, *chi-ling*, and sulfur for refinement, its efficacy surpasses that of nature itself.

*Qi-lin* resin, sourced from the Western Hu barbarians, is endowed with the qi of Mars. It forms in the yin of yang stones, congealing into a substance resembling purple ochre, its texture crumbling like weathered stone. Its function is to replenish yang essence, dissolve stagnant yin qi, and enhance luster. It possesses great efficacy. When authentic, it emits a crimson sap when burned in fire, its original color remaining unchanged—this reveals its primordial nature.

Chalcanthite is found in Song *yue* and Pu *zhou*, imbued with the numinous and anomalous qi of sacred stones. Its form resembles *se-se* (a type of jade), and its nature is inherently fluid. It resonates with the eight stones and liquefies the five metals; when yang essence encounters it, it returns to the central palace. To verify its authenticity, apply it to copper or iron and heat it—the metal will take on the hue of red gold. Its power in restraint, transformation, and refinement is most potent.

Moreover, fill a copper vessel with water and add a small amount to it—the water will turn a deep azure, its hue unchanged for days—this confirms its authenticity.

Great Peng cinnabar, though imbued with yang essence, is nurtured by yin. Its body resembles amber, its texture akin to peach resin. Its nature is harmonious, capable of dissolving yang metals and transforming stagnant yin substances. When combined with sulfur and red salt, it refines yang essence, progressively enhancing its luster and hue. Within the seven scrolls, it governs the regulation of primal yang qi, restoring it to true origin—its efficacy is most profound.

Red Rong salt originates from the western Rong lands, its flavor endowed by the natural qi of water and earth, congealing into form. The region’s dominant earth qi is yellow-red, and its salt arises in accordance with this ruling qi, hence called Rong salt. Its taste is slightly milder than rock salt, yet its power refines and subdues yang essence, amplifying brilliance and radiance. When used with sulfur, it can reverse dissolution to reconstitute essence, refine essence to generate light, subdue the four yellows, and stabilize form to return to the central palace of earth. To discern its primordial nature, burn it in fire—if its molten sap flows crimson and congeals to deepen its hue, this reveals its original essence.

Sulfur originates from the southern luminous borders of Persia, endowed with the pure yang essence of fiery stones, congealing into form. Its nature is fluid yet fiercely toxic; among medicinal substances, it is called the General. Its functions include dispelling evil to restore rectitude, reversing turbidity to clarity, fortifying yang essence, dissolving yin to transform essence, and circulating primordial true qi, often relying on its efficacy. When encountering refined gold, it corrodes its essence and corrupts its spirit. Specimens with a faint bluish luster possess the greatest potency, those of congealed yellow hue are secondary, and those of reddish-yellow hue are weakest. For compounding the Great Elixir and refining transformations, the strongest variety is required. Its primordial qi must be carefully examined to distinguish its quality, for it harmonizes with the seven scrolls. It transmutes gold to generate cinnabar, and cinnabar gradually refines into luminous power—thus verifying the Nine Elixirs.

**Middle Three Grades: Fifth on the Metal Grades of the Five Stones**
The five stone-metals each embody the yin essence of the five spirits, uniting with the anomalous qi of mountains and marshes to congeal into spirit. Iron embodies the yin essence of the southern *ding* spirit, congealing into form. Copper embodies the yin qi of the eastern *yi* spirit, congealing into spirit. Silver embodies the yin spirit of the western *xin*, condensing essence into substance. Lead and tin both embody the qi of the northern *ren* and *gui*; tin receives the essence of *ren*, while lead embodies the qi of *gui*. Yin culminates in *gui*, thus lead embodies the extreme yin essence. Gold embodies the yin spirit of the central palace’s *si*, its nature inherently unyielding—ingesting it harms the intestines and damages the flesh. Silver’s nature is perverse—ingesting it harms the liver. Copper’s nature is sharp—ingesting it harms the kidneys. Iron’s nature is hard—ingesting it harms the lungs. Lead’s nature is soft and slippery, laden with yin toxicity—ingesting it harms the heart and stomach. The extreme yin toxicity of these five metals, when ingested over time, injures the flesh, decays the bones, shortens lifespan, and damages vitality. Those who seek longevity yet fail to understand the nature of the five metals, arbitrarily refining and transmuting stone-metals, err gravely. For these stone-metals all receive the turbid yin qi of the five spirits, congealing into dense, stubborn forms. Though they may encounter the four yellows and alter their bodies, their yin-toxic nature never easily dissipates. Even if refined into an elixir, ingestion still harms the five viscera. Knowing their fundamental nature reveals the profound divergence from the true principle—seeking transcendence through such means only distances one further from the Dao.

**Fifth: The Subduing Grades of the Four Yellows**
The four yellows—realgar, orpiment, arsenic, and sulfur—all belong to the central palace’s *wu* earth phase. Each contains the toxicity of yang fire, which can corrupt the qi of the five viscera. If properly subdued to eliminate their fiery toxicity, they can transform the substances of the five metals. When subdued, they resist fire’s alteration of their original essence, allowing sap to flow freely—this is their power to transmute the copper and silver of the five stones into the substance of yellow gold. If subdued by fire to turn white like light powder, with a floating, fluid liquefaction, they transmute the five metals entirely into white silver. The four yellows’ efficacy derives from their inherent qi and transformations. Realgar transmutes iron, orpiment transmutes tin, arsenic transmutes copper, and sulfur transmutes silver into mercury. Moreover, the four yellows can reverse iron into copper, copper into silver, silver into gold, undergoing successive transformations. Sulfur’s efficacy is supreme, capable of augmenting yang and enriching essence, reversing turbidity to clarity—it is the General among the seventy-two stones. When the four yellows encounter red salt, great Peng cinnabar, or chalcanthite, they are subdued to return to their original nature without altering their hue. If they encounter rock salt, mirabilite, or chalcanthite, they are also subdued by fire, transforming into a white substance like light powder.

The *Great Cavern Treasure Scripture* and *Master Zheng’s Inner Transmission of Cultivating Reality* discuss the subduing formulas for the seventy-two stones, all of which must contain primordial embryonic essence, mixed with yellow earth in equal parts, lead powder, and stalactite, then sealed in a crucible. Green earth harmonizes with the four yellows’ kind, lead neutralizes fire toxicity, and stalactite subdues stone. The *Inner Transmission of Cultivating Reality* contains numerous formulas for the transmutation of stones, but their principles are somewhat intricate and cannot be fully recorded here. Thus, I briefly outline the grand principles of subduing the four yellows and five metals, arranging them in this graded compendium.

**Sixth: The Transmutation Grades of Yang Metals**
Yang metals embody yang essence, where the five spirits exhale talismanic qi to coalesce into cinnabar. Beyond cinnabar’s encasement of the eight stones lies its inner gold essence. This gold essence first receives qi from *jia*, takes form as *bing*, emerges from the womb as *ren*, congeals spirit into *geng*, enhances luster to return to *wu*—yin and yang ascend and descend, each returning to its source.

Just as pyrite and the five metals all receive and coalesce through the qi of the five yin spirits, they too divide into five forms. Their substance is stubborn and fierce, their nature heavy and stagnant. Mercury, however, is endowed with the numinous essence of the five yang spirits, uniting talismanic signs into one body. Thus it can lightly ascend and mysteriously transform, commanding the myriad spirits. Mercury originally gestates within cinnabar, residing in the south; when its embryo changes, it becomes *ren*-water. Water then reveals mercury’s form in the north, descending its po to become *geng*. *Geng* is the white metal of the west; refining its form returns it to *jia*, the blue-green metal of the east; enhancing its essence brings it to *wu*, the yellow metal of the central palace. When its substance transforms and ascends, its work is perfected in nine cycles. Thus yang metals undergo transmutation, activating the mechanism of change, shifting their substance and altering their embryo to unite the bodies of the five directions. Only then can they receive heaven and earth, reform yin and yang, transcend the Three Origins, shed their form to return to reality—this is called *huandan*.

**Chapter on the Perfection of the Elixir and Return to Reality**
To compound the Great Elixir, one must first accumulate the essence of yang, sevenfold refined into purple gold. Through movement and transmutation, the five spirits are shifted, form is dissolved and substance shed, lightness and flow are achieved, and true water is borrowed. Yet fire’s work is essential: refining the utmost essence, when the nine-by-nine cycle concludes, true water and inner fire—black lead ore and sulfur—are revealed. Lead pertains to the *ren*-*gui* water of the north; sulfur’s nature is endowed with the *bing*-*ding* fire of the south. True lead contains primordial qi. When extracted from pyrite through burning but not yet refined by smoke or distillation, it is called true lead.

**Seventh: The Harmonizing Grades**
Take one *jin* of true lead and subject it to sevenfold refinement within dark-vermilion radiance sand. Add fifteen *liang* of purple gold. Place each in separate crucibles, melt them into liquid, then combine them evenly. Remove from the fire and swiftly stir to form fine grains. Add five *liang* of sulfur, and grind the three substances together in a mortar for one day. Then transfer them to the crucible and apply fire for six revolutions. Each revolution requires an augmented yang furnace and crucible; the fire phases are detailed in the subsequent *Fire Phases* section. The Great Elixir first receives its mandate from heaven, then is activated by the adept. Through nurturing, transmutation, and the accumulation of true yang, it inwardly contains water and fire, outwardly embraces the Three Luminaries, and blends the five spirits in steaming fusion. Suddenly it soars lightly, transforming into radiant elixir, returning to the south, clear and serene, abiding in the Purple Tenuity Hall. This is also the work of inner and outer water and fire, revolving and resonating to form the Great Return Elixir.

**Eighth: The Crucible, Furnace, and Fire Phases**
The crucible and furnace for the Great Elixir must also be constructed in accord with the Three Powers (heaven, earth, and humanity) and the five spirits. The crucible should be made from sevenfold-refined metal weighing twenty-four *liang*, corresponding to the twenty-four qi. Use sixteen *liang* to cast a round crucible with a capacity of nine *ge*; the remaining eight *liang* form the lid. The sixteen *liang* of the crucible match the weight of one *jin*, while its nine-*ge* capacity corresponds to the Three Origins’ yang extremity. The eight-*liang* lid corresponds to the eight solar terms. Together, crucible and lid total twenty-four *liang*, matching the grand reckoning. The crucible must be positioned according to the eight trigrams and twelve spirits. Only then should the compounded purple-gold sand be placed within, sealed tightly to prevent the leakage of yang qi, and set into the furnace.

**Method for Constructing the Furnace:**
During the *jia-chen* ten-day period, on the *wu-shen* day, gather pure earth from the *shen* (southwest) direction. First, build an altar of earth, eight *cun* high and two *chi* four *cun* wide. Upon the altar, construct the furnace, also two *chi* four *cun* high, divided into three tiers with open airflow. The upper tier, nine *cun* high, represents heaven and has nine apertures symbolizing the nine stars. The middle tier, one *chi* high, represents humanity and has twelve gates symbolizing the twelve earthly branches, each gate fitted with a door. The lower tier, five *cun* high, represents earth and has eight passages symbolizing the eight winds. The furnace’s interior must have a diameter of one *chi* two *cun*. Place the crucible within, suspended two *cun* above a supporting earthen platform of the same dimensions. Then apply fire to it.

**Fire Phases:**
The method for applying fire also mirrors yin and yang, the twenty-four qi, and the seventy-two seasonal markers. Five days make one marker, three markers one qi, two qi one month, and seventy-two markers correspond to the twenty-four qi. The twenty-four qi form twelve months, and twelve months make one year—when yin and yang’s revolutions are complete, the elixir is perfected. Begin firing on the *jia-zi* day of the eleventh month at the *jia-zi* midnight hour. Start from the *zi* gate, applying fire for five days with three *liang* of charcoal, maintaining a constant reserve of three *liang* in the furnace without variation. Next, open the *chou* gate and apply fire for five days with four *liang* of charcoal. Then open the *yin* gate and apply fire for five days with five *liang*. Next, open the *mao* gate and apply fire for five days with six *liang*. Then open the *chen* gate and apply fire for five days with seven *liang*. Next, open the *si* gate and apply fire for five days with eight *liang*. These six gates are the yang gates; the charcoal must be arranged firmly, like the stirring of yang qi. Then proceed to the *wu* gate and apply fire for five days with nine *liang*. Next, open the *wei* gate and apply fire for five days with eight *liang*. Then open the *shen* gate and apply fire for five days with seven *liang*. Next, open the *you* gate and apply fire for five days with six *liang*. Then open the *xu* gate and apply fire for five days with five *liang*. Finally, open the *hai* gate and apply fire for five days with four *liang*. These six gates are the yin gates; the charcoal must be arranged horizontally, also symbolizing yin and yang’s seasonal phases. From the *zi* gate to the *hai* gate, circling through the twelve gates, a total of seventy-two *liang* of charcoal is used in the furnace, corresponding to the seventy-two seasonal markers, thus completing four qi and twelve markers.

Sixty days—two months—make one cycle; then open and inspect it. Add two *liang* of sulfur, blending it with purple-gold sand in a mortar, and grind with a jade pestle for half a day. Return it to the crucible, seal it tightly, and secure the closure. As before, apply fire for five days at each gate.

Next, beginning again at the *zi* hour of the *jiazi* day, start the fire at the *zi* gate, using five *liang* of charcoal. At the *chou* gate, use six *liang*; at the *yin* gate, seven *liang*; at the *mao* gate, eight *liang*; at the *chen* gate, nine *liang*; at the *si* gate, ten *liang*. Upon reaching the *wu* gate, reduce the charcoal to nine *liang*. At the *wei* gate, use eight *liang*; at the *shen* gate, seven *liang*; at the *you* gate, six *liang*; at the *xu* gate, five *liang*; at the *hai* gate, four *liang*.

This is the second cycle of firing. Each gate, with five days, constitutes one seasonal marker. Circling through the twelve gates, twelve markers complete sixty days, with a total of eighty-four *liang* of charcoal in the furnace. Compared to the first cycle, twelve *liang* are added, corresponding to the twelve solar terms. Then, when the furnace fire subsides, open and inspect it: the color resembles brown earth, with golden stars gleaming. Add another two *liang* of sulfur, blend it with the sand, and grind thoroughly before returning it to the crucible and sealing it tightly.

Again, apply fire as before, circling through the twelve gates, each with five days as one marker. Starting once more at the *zi* gate, apply fire for five days with seven *liang* of charcoal. The charcoal must precisely match the seven *liang* of well-burned charcoal in the furnace, with no increase or decrease. Next, at the *chou* gate, apply fire for five days with eight *liang*; at the *yin* gate, nine *liang*; at the *mao* gate, ten *liang*; at the *chen* gate, eleven *liang*; at the *si* gate, twelve *liang*. Upon reaching the *wu* gate, reduce the charcoal to eleven *liang*. At the *wei* gate, reduce it to ten *liang*; at the *shen* gate, nine *liang*; at the *you* gate, eight *liang*; at the *xu* gate, seven *liang*; and finally, at the *hai* gate, reduce it to six *liang*.

For these twelve gates, adhere strictly to the prescribed amounts of charcoal. Circling through the twelve gates, a total of one hundred eight *liang* of charcoal is used in the furnace, twenty-four *liang* more than the second cycle, corresponding to the twenty-four qi. After completing the twelve gates and sixty days, when the crucible has cooled, open and inspect it: the color inclines toward purple. Add another two *liang* of sulfur, remove the gold sand, blend and grind them together, then return them to the crucible and seal it tightly.

Again, apply fire as before, with five days for each gate. Beginning at the *zi* hour of the *jiazi* day, start the fire at the *zi* gate for five days with nine *liang* of charcoal. Then open the *chou* gate and apply fire for five days with ten *liang*; at the *yin* gate, eleven *liang*; at the *mao* gate, twelve *liang*; at the *chen* gate, thirteen *liang*; at the *si* gate, fourteen *liang*. Upon reaching the *wu* gate, reduce the charcoal to thirteen *liang*. At the *wei* gate, reduce it to twelve *liang*; at the *shen* gate, eleven *liang*; at the *you* gate, ten *liang*; at the *xu* gate, nine *liang*; and finally, at the *hai* gate, reduce it to eight *liang*.

In this cycle, circling through the twelve gates, a total of one hundred thirty-two *liang* of charcoal is used in the furnace, twenty-four *liang* more than the third cycle, again corresponding to the seasonal qi. When fully cooled, open and inspect it: the cinnabar-sand now bears a golden hue, with stars of purple light shimmering and flowing. Add another two *liang* of sulfur, remove the gold sand, blend it with the sulfur, and grind thoroughly. Return it to the crucible, sealing it tightly to ensure no leaks above or below.

Then, as before, apply fire at each gate. Starting at the *zi* hour of the *jiazi* day, begin at the *zi* gate with eleven *liang* of charcoal for five days. Next, at the *chou* gate, apply fire for five days with twelve *liang*; at the *yin* gate, thirteen *liang*; at the *mao* gate, fourteen *liang*; at the *chen* gate, fifteen *liang*; at the *si* gate, sixteen *liang*. Upon reaching the *wu* gate, reduce the fire, applying charcoal at fifteen *liang* for five days. At the *wei* gate, apply fire for five days with fourteen *liang*; at the *shen* gate, thirteen *liang*; at the *you* gate, twelve *liang*; at the *xu* gate, eleven *liang*; and finally, at the *hai* gate, ten *liang*.

From the *zi* gate to the *hai* gate, circling through the twelve gates, a total of one hundred fifty-six *liang* of charcoal is used in the furnace, encircling the crucible and accumulating the sixty-day firing cycle. Compared to the fourth cycle, twenty-four *liang* are added. Around the crucible within the furnace, purple qi swirls like mist. When cooled, open the crucible: the gold sand has transformed into cinnabar of purple light, with red stars within, as if lightly surging.

Further add two *liang* of sulfur, blending it thoroughly in the mortar and grinding for half a day, then return it to the crucible and seal it tightly. Thereafter, follow the qi cycles and apply the martial fire for one revolution.

Again beginning on the *jiazi* day at the *jiazi* hour, kindle the fire at the *zi* gate for five days, using seventeen *liang* of charcoal; next at the *chou* gate for five days, eighteen *liang*; at the *yin* gate for five days, nineteen *liang*; at the *mao* gate for five days, twenty *liang*; at the *chen* gate for five days, twenty-one *liang*; at the *si* gate for five days, twenty-two *liang*. Then at the *wu* gate for five days, reduce the charcoal to twenty-one *liang*; at the *wei* gate for five days, twenty *liang*; at the *shen* gate for five days, nineteen *liang*; at the *you* gate for five days, eighteen *liang*; at the *xu* gate for five days, seventeen *liang*, and finally at the *hai* gate for five days.

In total, two hundred twenty-eight *liang* of charcoal are used in the furnace, an increase of seventy-two *liang* over the fifth cycle, corresponding to the seventy-two seasonal nodes. Within the furnace and crucible, purple qi rises to the heavens, eclipsing the brilliance of sun and moon. Mountains and rivers tremble—this is the sign of the elixir’s completion.

Extinguish the furnace and remove the crucible onto the incense altar. Upon opening, the elixir is seen to float lightly, freed from its matrix, resembling a nine-layered lotus blossom adhering to the crucible’s lid—fifteen *liang* in weight, not a fraction less. Within the crucible remains twenty-four *liang* of residual ash, the color of purple gold. A single pellet of this purple ash, no larger than a sesame seed, can transmute one *jin* of mercury and five *shi* of base metal entirely into supreme treasure.

Then transfer the crucible to the Three Caverns, each to guard its achievement. The work converges in the true, utterly transcending like the cicada’s molt—such is the power of the returned elixir, truly magnificent.

**Chapter Nine: The Grades of Elixirs and the Attainment of the True**

All elixirs have grades, yet the true is one and the same. Take, for example, the seven-reverted cinnabar elixir: its efficacy is pronounced, and those who ingest it may ascend to a higher grade. Yet it has not attained the true—why? Because it still retains a corporeal form, unable to dissolve lightly, and though it departs the five turbidities, it remains subject to the true water and worldly fire, which can still refine and recast it.

When the nine-reverted elixir is complete, it floats and dissolves lightly, utterly transcending its form. Its radiant light shines through, purple qi piercing the heavens, transmuting all it encounters without obstruction. Though pounded a thousand times or ground ten thousand, it remains unmelting, and its luminous essence only grows brighter. Even within raging flames, it cannot be burned.

The first to ingest it shall ascend, feathered and soaring on clouds, becoming a transcendent of the highest order. Thus, accumulating essence leads to elixirs, and accumulating elixirs leads to the true. The true transcends the utmost yang, enduring as long as heaven and earth, riding the clouds and mist, commanding the myriad spirits, and mastering herbs and minerals. Towering and sublime, ascending to the purple palace, one is then called a *zhenren*. Yet heaven and earth do not change, and the yang essence does not perish. While worldly forms decay and transform, only the true endures forever.
