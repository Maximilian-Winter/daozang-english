**Preface to *The Esoteric Discourses of the Alchemical Chamber***

I humbly observe that the great elixir of golden cinnabar fully harmonizes the ascent and descent of yin and yang, and accords with the natural principles governing all things. What the sages called "investigating things to extend knowledge" ultimately concerns nothing beyond the mutual generation of mother and child, the pairing of husband and wife. This must rely on the impartial power of water and fire to conjoin the essence of the two substances, lead and mercury. Only by securing true earth to capture lead, true lead to restrain mercury, and applying the proper manual techniques and firing times, can one transcend the mundane and enter sagehood, reversing aging to regain youth.

Later generations of elixir students, failing to recognize true earth and true lead, ignorant of manual techniques and firing times, have sought rare herbs and plants of the world. Deluded by others and each expounding their own biases, they recklessly apply contrived methods, misleading one another in confusion, achieving nothing even in old age—deeply lamentable indeed.

In my youth, I admired purity and loftiness, delighting in the hearing of the supreme Dao. I sought teachers and visited friends, yet never penetrated its mysteries. Later, during the Tianxi and Wuwu years of my official travels to Jinling, I encountered the immortal master Wei Jun, the Perfected of Yan’s Dipper, who transmitted to me the wonders of the *Six-One Purple Void Nine Elixirs of Great Clarity*, along with the oral instructions of creation and transformation. Returning to Huxiang, I journeyed to Mount Nanyue, offering rituals to thank the celestial perfected. Following the instructions in practice, each step proved verifiable and true.

Knowing that manual techniques and firing times are not easily transmitted to the world, I feared later learners would never glimpse their beginnings or ends. Unwilling to keep this secret, I respectfully compiled the oral instructions imparted by my teacher, along with the effects I had personally verified, into a single volume, entitled *The Esoteric Discourses of the Alchemical Chamber*. Those who obtain it must not treat it lightly or carelessly; they should treasure and safeguard it. If readers can extend its principles by analogy, it will truly benefit those of shared aspiration.

In the fourth year of Tianxi, gengshen, on the Shangyuan festival, the student of immortality Cheng Liaoyi presents this work.

*The Esoteric Discourses of the Alchemical Chamber*
By the student of immortality Cheng Liaoyi

**I. On True Earth and Common Earth**
Earth stands at the center of Heaven and Earth, its qi capable of gathering the Five Agents and nurturing the myriad things. Gold thrives when united with earth; wood flourishes when rooted in earth; water is stilled by earth; fire is quelled by earth. In refinement, without earth, the elixir cannot be formed—this is the sprouting yellow of cinnabar. It is like a farmer who does not till the field yet expects a harvest: difficult indeed. Thus, the sages of old established the doctrine of true earth to enlighten later learners. How could one remain ignorant of it?

Now, the Eight Stones are refined in Heaven and take form in earth. Their nature craves yin and fears yang; when fire is applied, they scatter without direction. Yet if they undergo decoction with herbs and woods, or are tempered and nurtured with metals and stones, they retain their form and substance, becoming as enduring as Heaven and Earth, as lasting as the sun and moon. When used to transmute the Five Metals or refine various medicines, they can all become treasures—this is called true earth. Substances like magnetite, *shizhonghuang* (yellow within stone), and *yangqishi* (actinolite) may also serve as external vessels for nurturing medicines. However, their forms are stubborn and their natures dull and turbid, so their efficacy is limited.

**II. On True Lead and Common Lead**
The perfected one says:
*True lead differs from worldly lead,*
*Refinement depends on the work of creation.*
*One crucible holds both dragon and tiger,*
*Then you know the cosmos lies within.*

This speaks of the profound mystery of true lead, yet世人不知其为何物，拘泥于黄丹、韶粉。或从铅中取银，砂中取金，误认其元气未散，以为真铅，实与大道相去甚远。 True lead is nothing but mercury, with no other substance. It must not be tainted by the mother’s qi; it must enter the vessel of true earth, be nurtured over time, and when fire is applied, take form—unyielding and unbroken, its power capable of reviving the dead, restoring youth, and transmuting tiles and pebbles into supreme treasures. This is called true lead, the mother of the Five Metals and the ancestor of the returning elixir.

Black lead, however, is harmful in medicinal use. If employed improperly, it renders all medicines weak and worthless, difficult to reform. Those who refine the elixir must examine this carefully.

**III. On True Mercury and Cinnabar Mercury**
According to the *Materia Medica of the Eight Stones*: Cinnabar is the golden liquid of yin, the qi exchanged with the Palace of Li, descending into earth to coalesce into mercury, borrowing the south as its body. Thus, the perfected one extracts mercury from cinnabar and refines it into the elixir. The verse says:
*Drawn as mercury from cinnabar,*
*Returned by fire to cinnabar.*
*In the womb it receives five hues,*
*In the flame the yellow sprout appears.*

This is the meaning.

The Great Elixir takes true mercury as its foundation. The scriptures say: "In all cultivation, first subdue the heart. In all refinement, first subdue mercury." Mercury is quicksilver, born of cinnabar—this is what the immortal classics call true mercury. Yet世人不明其根源，妄以硫黄配合，虽可成灵砂，然其还返之际，则生疏漏。 This is what Master Ge meant by "seeking the red marrow"—the mercury within cinnabar.

Now, those who refine the elixir often fail to investigate the depth of qi absorption in cinnabar. The qi of the Five Agents in Heaven and Earth, concentrated in the flourishing lands of mountains and rivers, becomes gold, jade, auspicious herbs, or sweet springs. Cinnabar and mercury, in particular, are the essence of Heaven and Earth’s qi, coalesced into form. If measured by years, the difference is vast. The true liquid and the qi of the Palace of Li gather for over a thousand years to become mercury, and another thousand years to crystallize into cinnabar—like pine resin buried in earth, which after a thousand years becomes amber. If common mercury is used, how can it achieve unity of body?

Common and true mercury differ by hundreds or thousands of years, requiring countless cycles to fulfill their qi. From this, the disparity is evident.

**IV. On the Three Cinnabars**
In general, to transmute mercury into treasure, one must ensure the affection of mother and child, the harmony of husband and wife—only then can the elixir be formed. Without this, it cannot be achieved. Mercury takes sulfur as its husband and gold or silver as its mother: with sulfur it hardens, with gold or silver it solidifies. Herein lies the Way of husband and wife, mother and child.

Mother and child uphold righteousness, yet may part in time. Husband and wife cherish affection, which cannot be abandoned. Thus, cinnabar and *ling* cinnabar, though differing in origin, are both formed by the union of sulfur and mercury, fulfilling the Way of husband and wife. If decocted with divine herbs and tempered, even without refined medicines, they can be nurtured with stubborn stones like saltpeter, alum, nitre, magnetite, or *shizhonghuang*, enabling them to withstand fire and liquefy—though they cannot become treasure. If they receive the mother’s qi, they may still reach completion.

Mother cinnabar is formed by the union of mother mercury. When decocted with herbs, saltpeter, alum, or vinegar, it hardens; when tempered with plum pits or lotus seeds, it can be hammered. Yet if exposed to great fire and sudden cooling, the mercury flees, leaving only the mother. This is because the mother’s body dries first in fire, driving the mercury away—far from beneficial, it becomes harmful.

Modern students of the elixir, unaware of its origins, take mother cinnabar as a shortcut, delving into the profound and subtle. Truly, it is difficult to discuss. When mercury becomes treasure, its effect is akin to *san* refinement. Thus, mother cinnabar must be nurtured with vessels of true lead or other divine substances, or tempered to a true death, enduring great smelting without breaking—this is called "relying on the mother for *san* refinement." Even with true death vessels and nurturing, without the most divine and void medicines, one failure leads to separation, and mother and child revert to division—what use is that?

Those today may use herbs to kill cinnabar and employ the "dual-sands" method to nurture the two sands, pressing the dual sands as mother cinnabar against the body, sealed within a plum-pit crucible for firm destruction. If they can retain even half a *qian* or a *zhū*, they claim mother cinnabar has become treasure. Yet what remains is merely the turned mercury from the dual sands—not the mercury of true mother cinnabar. Though "qi-sensing sand" borrows the mother’s blackness to form its body, it is not bound by the mother’s control and moves freely, fleeing at the first sign of fire. If herbs are used to boil and harden it, it must enter the water-and-fire crucible for nurturing and tempering, enduring the fire’s power, then placed in a divine vessel for warm nurturing to reverse and achieve success. The mechanisms stand fully revealed—those who study the elixir must tread the path to know them.

**Five: On the Three Yellows**
In refining the Three Yellows, one must understand the nature of the medicines and the firing times. If one fails to grasp the urgency or slowness of each medicine’s nature, or the lightness or heaviness of the firing times, all will turn to ashes—regret comes too late. Sulfur is endowed with pure yang, formed from the essence of fire and stone, its nature flowing and free. It contains fierce toxicity, flees at the sight of fire, and is most difficult to capture and control. In the alchemical vessels, it is called the "General," for it possesses the power to cut through chaos and restore order. If treated with divine herbs and boiled, then tempered with great fire, it can swiftly achieve true death. Yet its fierce toxicity remains, not easily dispelled. If used to nurture other stones, it will instead cause harm. Like a general—difficult to control yet easily slain—even after a thousand years, its heroic qi remains formidable and must not be provoked. Thus, one must gradually apply fire and nurturing until it sheds its black and brown hues, shifting with the herbs to become true gold, cinnabar-red, or snow-white. Only then may it be used, for it greatly dispels evil and restores rectitude, reverses stagnation and revives vitality, strengthens yang essence, and dissolves yin spirits.

Orpiment is yang without yin, while realgar is yin without yang—what the elixir masters call "solitary yin" and "widowed yang." Though easily subdued, they are difficult to bring to true death. First, they must be boiled with herbs, then slowly subjected to fire and nurturing. Even when dead, without medicines like *pao-dan* or dead mercury, they cannot be transmuted. Without the pairing of cinnabar and sulfur, they cannot nurture other substances. Thus, among medicinal ingredients, orpiment serves as the "assisting official." Though it possesses spiritual efficacy, its initial power is incomplete. Without the combination of other medicines, it is truly difficult to use alone.

This is set down in plain words for the scholar’s understanding.

**Six: On the Three Whites**

The sutras state: *Pao-sha* acts as a thief among the Five Metals, and all Five Metals fear it; when combined with *pi-fen*, it can penetrate the transformations of creation. It is also said: *Pi-shuang* subdues and renders substances truly dead, enabling the transmutation of copper into silver. It harmonizes most perfectly with *fen-shuang*; when paired with *pao* and nurtured together, they may form the supreme medicine. Common folk believe this serves only to transmute *dan-yang*, yet they know not that when *zhu-pao* is truly dead and long nurtured, it becomes non-toxic. If it receives the black essence of the mother through steaming, it can also refine and subdue all stones. When used to nurture *dan-shi*, *ci-xiong*, and others, it is called the *Five Spirits Divine Elixir*, turning white into yellow—its efficacy is especially great.

*Fen-shuang* is but a single substance, mercury, refined with saltpeter, alum, and nitre into frost; the elixir classics call it *Divine Snow*. Some say: when aided by herbs to kill *pi*, and used together as the elixir’s foundation, placed within the divine chamber and slowly nurtured with fire to death, it becomes true lead. How could its power be limited to mere bone-transformation? Yet its nature is wholly yin, extremely difficult to subdue, and not easily rendered truly dead. Without the subduing fire of cinnabar, it cannot stabilize its form. Generally, it must rely on the mother’s black essence to achieve completion; separated from the mother and deprived of yang, nothing can be accomplished.

The sutras state: *Fen-shuang* is yin refined from yin, with but a trace of yang—yet without the true death of the Three Yellows, nothing is possible. As for divine cinnabar, silver, and the like, without a spiritual root they cannot become treasures; without subdued *zhu*, they cannot soften bones; without subdued *pao*, they cannot attain softness and moisture. Observing this, I have often combined *fen-shuang* with *pi* and *pao* to form an embryo, placed it within the Four Spirits chamber, and nurtured it for over a hundred days. When used to transmute *dan-yang*, it readily transforms all into gold. Such are its divine and wondrous transformations—how could they be easily fathomed?

**Seven: On the Use of Lead**
The immortal classics say: "Use lead yet do not use lead; instead, work within lead. Yet when it comes to using lead, using lead is still a mistake." I once pondered this and thought: if using lead is wrong, then it cannot be used. Yet it must be worked within lead—why? This is no riddle from the immortals; it is simply that ordinary people do not understand its use. If one grasps the method of lead, what worry is there that the elixir will not form? Those who study the elixir must first clarify its principles before applying them.

Silver is born from lead; before lead and silver separate in the womb, their black essence is undifferentiated. When used to nurture mercury and other medicines within the chamber, success may be achieved. After their forms divide, the original black essence scatters, and lead becomes lead, silver becomes silver—how then can one abandon silver to seek lead, hastily hoping to use lead to create treasures? Is there such a principle in the world?

The method requires three parts lead to four parts silver, ground together into powder, then refined with spiritual herbs and nurtured with fire over time, allowing their black essence to reunite. Only then can it nurture the cinnabar and divine cinnabar, or form lead cinnabar, and be placed within the mother’s chamber. When the mother cinnabar enters the lead chamber and is long nurtured, it can become a treasure. Yet without the passage of great time, success is difficult. All eight stones that have been nurtured in the mother’s chamber, rendered truly dead and without nature, when placed again in the lead chamber and nurtured for over a month, their efficacy doubles that of the ordinary.

If one encounters treasure medicines, they too may be placed in the lead chamber for nurturing and refinement, or treated with medicines that attract lead qi to act as a barrier against dissipation, thus avoiding loss. Alas! The dragon dwells within the serpent’s belly, the mother hides within the child’s womb—such are the principles of reception and release, the subtleties of creation. Who but the most divine in the world could comprehend this?

**Eight: On the Use of the Mother**
In seizing the transformations of heaven and earth to refine the golden elixir, only mercury suffices. Yet it must rely on the ancestral furnace to preserve its form. Like an infant within the mother’s womb, nurtured by the warmth of the black essence, it can take shape—thus gold, silver, and mercury are likened to mother and child.

Mercury’s nature is light and volatile, responding to whatever it encounters, and difficult to subdue. First, one must nurture and refine divine cinnabar and cinnabar to form the elixir’s foundation, then subdue the mercury to establish the Dao of ceaseless transformation. The method requires refining with spiritual herbs until it withstands fire without moving, its great essence forming a liquid, its embryonic color unchanged. Next, it is placed within the gold mother and nurtured over time to form the great elixir. If burned over fire and it still emits light and flame, this indicates the sulfur’s black essence is not yet dead. If one then uses the mother to nurture it, the mercury will devour the mother, and they will consume each other, inevitably depleting the mother’s body. Once the mother’s form is diminished, her original essence weakened, how can she attain longevity?

The mercury must receive the mother’s black essence without devouring her—this is paramount. With the mother, there is no spiritual efficacy; without the mother, nothing can be achieved—this is the meaning. Some say sulfur does not corrode gold, so they hastily use gold as the mother to nurture until full, hoping for success. Yet they know not that gold is utterly hard, mercury utterly soft—their black essences are opposed and do not harmonize. Though time is spent, no treasure can be formed. Thus, refined gold is not used in elixir cinnabar.

When using the mother for divine cinnabar and cinnabar, one must first employ silver before metal—this is called *golden sinews and jade bones*. If one abandons silver for gold, without an enlightened teacher, how can success be achieved? I have received an oral formula: if the sulfur’s trust is not yet subdued, it must first devour mercury, then consume the mother. For every four taels of silver, add one tael of *fen-shuang*, grind them evenly together to form a chamber, and nurture the two cinnabars. Then the sulfur, having devoured the mercury’s black essence before it is exhausted, will already be weakened—how could it then consume the mother? This is called *adding the child to aid the mother*, or *the astonished maiden embracing the infant*.

If one speaks of the principle of using gold to nurture the two cinnabars, though gold and mercury are hard and soft and do not harmonize, with long association, they too can grow intimate. Those in the world who use gold to nurture cinnabar do so because they do not understand that gold becomes dry when heated, mercury flies when exposed to fire, and gold and mercury cannot long endure together. Their essences do not merge, so no success is achieved. For every four taels of gold, add two taels of *fen*, grind them finely together, and use them to nurture the two cinnabars. Then the gold, though inclined to dryness, cannot immediately dry, and the mercury, though inclined to fly, cannot immediately fly. They can thus remain together long, their essences growing intimate—what worry is there that the elixir cannot form?

Having grasped this principle, I repeatedly tested it, and each trial proved effective. However, one must not hastily apply intense fire, lest the mercury readily flee and success be thwarted. Gentle fire and gradual nurturing are most ingenious. If *fen* frost is unavailable, one may use mother mercury to congeal cinnabar as a substitute.

The method of returning to the source and reviving the mother involves burying the crucible in an earthen pit for one or two days to dispel its fire-toxins. For gold, use green vitriol to coat the head, then subject it to a fierce fire for one refining. Add four taels of silver, one tael of mercury, two taels of black lead, and a small amount of night-shining sand, refining them together. Only afterward should it be placed in the furnace, lest the ashes cause warping or breakage.

**The Nine Wheels of Borrowing**
An ancient saying goes: *"With three dead yellows at home, one need not buy farmland."* Another states: *"With true dead *pi* at home, gold and silver melt like mud."* Though these sayings are not entirely clear, borrowing their principle reveals subtleties not easily understood. Those who practice alchemy today do so in great numbers, yet among the true dead three yellows and *pi*, how could there be none that succeed in forming the elixir? Why is this? They have lost the Way of borrowing.

The swallow does not hatch the phoenix; the fox and hare do not nurse the horse. Without true parents, all offspring are false. Nowadays, once a practitioner obtains a single true dead medicine, they immediately seek to refine mercury into treasure. When, after long effort, no success comes, they blame the herbs for lacking efficacy. It is not the herbs’ fault—rather, they have not received the mother’s black vapor to fully infuse their spirit.

When refining *ci* and *xiong* sulfur-*pi*, one need not seek them to be entirely true dead; they must retain their nature. First, use gold mother to nurture and form their shape, then silver mother to complete their blackness. Only then can this be used to further nurture cinnabar, divine cinnabar, *fen* frost, mercury teeth, and other motherless medicines into treasure.

In the earlier section on using mothers to nurture cinnabar and divine cinnabar, it was said to use silver first and gold afterward, yet here it is said to use gold first and silver afterward. Why? Because mercury more readily harmonizes with gold. For example, borax, saltpeter, and other herbs can subdue fire; if refined with silver mother, they too can restrain mercury medicines. Even if true dead, without nurturing by the mother, they can only be used to refine various stones. If one wishes to dry mercury into treasure, they cannot be spoken of in the same breath.

**Ten Discourses on Refining and Transformation**
In alchemy, the difficulty lies not in obtaining the mother but in the art of transformation. If one understands the principle of transformation, then one can become ten, ten can become a hundred, and generation upon generation of change will have no end. As the saying goes: *"Attain the One, and all things are complete."* How could this be an easy matter?

Yet people today do not comprehend this principle. They recklessly speculate, blindly practicing and blindly refining, remaining ignorant even in old age—how pitiful! Though the five metals and eight stones are said to restrain one another in sequence, there is a Way of what can and cannot be refined, existing between them.

The classics say: *"Sulfur nurtures *xiong*; the Dao lies in their unity. *Ci* nurtures *xiong*; they diverge east and west."* They also say: *"Cinnabar nurtures cinnabar, and the cinnabar breaks. Cinnabar pours over mercury, and the cinnabar lives."* Within such teachings, without a master’s transmission—even the wise would be as lost as Yan and Min.

The method of transformation lies in the marvel of *shen* water and flower pool. The classics say: *"Lead entering mercury is called flower pool. Mercury entering lead is called *shen* water."* The sages liken true dead medicines to lead and unrefined medicines to mercury. Using lead to restrain mercury preserves the mercury’s form; using mercury to nourish lead enhances the lead’s *qi*. When they mutually benefit one another, they can attain longevity.

The True Man said: *"Nurture spirit with spirit, emerging from darkness into obscurity. Supplement *qi* with *qi*, and life endures as heaven and earth."* This is the same principle. Yet people today mistakenly use salt, alum, and dew to bathe dead medicines, calling it *shen* water and flower pool—how laughable! Thus, the ancient sages kept their secrets hidden, never lightly transmitting them to the world. Those who practice alchemy must examine this carefully.

All eight stones’ true dead medicines must be replenished before they can attain numinosity. For their original bodies, having endured the poison of medicines and the coercion of fire, are withered in form and exhausted in spirit. Thus, one must add their own kind to nurture them, restoring their spirit and blackness, and completing their form, before they can transform other stones.

Only cinnabar and divine cinnabar, being formed of sulfur and mercury, have an inherent imbalance, making transformation difficult. One must understand the marvel of *"cinnabar nurturing cinnabar breaks it; cinnabar pouring over mercury revives it."* Even if these two are true dead, if one wishes to nurture cinnabar by pouring over mercury, one must first stir-fry them with sulfur, then boil and refine them with herbs, gradually adding fire to nurture them until they melt into liquid. Only then can they be used to nurture raw cinnabar and serve as the foundation of the elixir.

For pouring and washing the sprouts, after three or four repetitions, one must again refine them with sulfur as before to ensure durability, lest they collapse. Some say: *"One yellow dies, and all yellows follow. One yellow does not die, and all yellows flee."* This is not a definitive statement. If sulfur is true dead, it can transform all stones. If *xiong* yellow is true dead, it can transform *ci* yellow. Yet I have never heard of *ci* nurturing *xiong*, or *xiong* nurturing sulfur.

People today know only that true dead *pi* can nurture *fen* to transmute bones, but they do not realize that using it to nurture the two yellows and transmute metal is even more direct. Thus, the ancients said: *"With one dead *pi* at home, gold and silver become like mud."* True dead *fen* frost shares the same efficacy as true lead; one must not rigidly adhere to transmuting bones. Scholars should ponder this themselves, without need for further elaboration.

**Eleven Discourses on Pouring and Washing**
Pouring and washing are also methods of transformation. While all eight stones subdued by fire can be transformed, only the method of pouring and washing requires cinnabar and divine cinnabar. Herbs are used to subdue their fire, and they are nurtured by the mother until true dead, melted into liquid, and thus can become treasure. With further nurturing by the mother over time, their spirit becomes abundant, their root firm, and they can serve as the foundation of the elixir.

Thus may the mother grow robust and the child become numinous, enabling longevity. Should the system be improper or the nurturing incomplete, even self-cultivation remains unattainable—how then could one extend its benefits to others? Today, people fail to grasp this Dao, merely calculating costs and boasting of minimal mother-material as marvelous. Little do they know that each ingredient follows its own method and measure. Such petty concerns not only yield no benefit but also squander prior efforts in vain.

If one wishes to establish the two cinnabars as the elixir foundation, one must repeatedly replace the old mother with new, nurture it until extraction, then add sulfur and refine by roasting until it no longer clumps or adheres. Next, boil it with the original herb’s juice, then subject it to dripping and roasting, and finally place it in the water-and-fire crucible for intense calcination until it melts into liquid. For every four *liang* of elixir foundation, first pour four *liang* of mercury—or two *liang*. If the cinnabar is parched and dry, the mercury will not sprout. After seven days or half a month, open the vessel and pour another two *liang* of mercury—or three *liang* or one *liang*—before it finally sprouts. Repeat this pouring three or four times, observing its form and momentum. Should it resemble a coiling dragon or crouching tiger, or phoenixes in flight, or jade trees in a jeweled forest, such shapes are all auspicious omens. But if it appears like a burial mound or the mercury is overly oily, the elixir foundation’s power is exhausted. Immediately remove the sprout, retrieve the elixir foundation, and reprocess it with sulfur as before. If the sprout weighs four *liang*, extract one *liang* of true mercury from the cinnabar, grind them together into powder, then boil with sulfur. Add a small amount of mother-material and a bit of raw yin-yang, seal according to the original method, and return it to the furnace for nurturing with fire—thus the mercury revives into a numinous sprout.

After seven or nine pourings, substitute raw cinnabar for mercury—this is called the "Seven Returns and Nine Revolutions." Accumulate thus until reaching one *jin*, then take the sprout and add four *liang* of mercury from the cinnabar along with a small amount of raw yin-yang. Boil together with sulfur and white water for three to five cycles of subjugation. Use twenty-four *liang* of silver to fashion a divine chamber, place the sprout within, and seal it in a true-earth or true-lead vessel. Nurture and refine it for twenty-one, thirty-five, or forty-nine days, and the sprout will entirely transform into treasure. Remove it, divide into five portions, and place them in the water-and-fire crucible for intense destruction, forming *tuo*-shaped elixir foundations. Continue pouring mercury as before, generating and transforming endlessly—what the ancient immortals called "children begetting grandchildren, and grandchildren begetting further descendants." At this stage, the embryo is shed here, transformations occur here, and refinement is achieved here. Yet the world neither sees nor recognizes it; one may well ask when such mastery will ever be attained. Scholars must not regard this as commonplace but should devote even greater care to it.

**Twelve: On Transmutation**
A *daogui* of powder enters the mouth, and bones are exchanged for those of an immortal. A mere *zizhu* of substance enters the body, and the base is transmuted into the noble. Without the supreme numinosity of the elixir head or the ultimate subtlety of creation and transformation, how could such thorough permeation of the marrow be achieved? This is the Dao of shifting spirit and altering qi. It resembles the dyeing methods of the world: without bone-penetrating agents or various alums, their wondrous effects cannot be realized.

When mercury is truly dead, it can transmute copper into silver. Yet why did the ancient worthies regard *fen* frost as the supreme medicine for transmuting copper? It is because it has previously absorbed alum qi. If using cinnabar, divine cinnabar, mother-cinnabar, or *fen* frost to transmute copper, one must first combine the cinnabar with *pi* for transmutation. For every *liang* of elixir head, use three *qian* of *pi*—or two *qian*. Then mix the elixir head, *pi*, and copper beads together, wrap them in several layers of Kunlun paper, and place them in a crucible. Pack the top tightly with medicinal closure, then use damp charcoal to build a top fire and calcine until thoroughly heated. Fan two to three thousand times, taking care not to disturb it, and ensure the top fire remains solid. After a brief rest, fan another one to two thousand times, then remove the crucible to cool. Break it open, and the substance will form a *tuo* at the bottom. If it appears black, refine it again with lead—do not use saltpeter for extraction.

To transmute silver into gold, nothing but *pi*-processed chalcanthite can penetrate the bone; without yin-yang sulfur or the two greens (*ceng* and *kong*), the proper color cannot be achieved; without transmuting sacred silver, success is impossible. The supreme Dao encompasses these principles: without true-earth or true-lead vessels to nurture the medicines, nothing can be accomplished. Though the world knows that *pi* powder can transmute bones, few realize that *pi* powder nurtured in vessels with yin-yang, roasted chalcanthite, and the two greens (*ceng* and *kong*) transmuting *geng* is even more wondrous.

For transmuting common silver, one must first emaciate its original body with medicine, then congeal it into cinnabar. Grind this with the elixir head into powder, place it in the crucible, seal it tightly, drive off the mercury, and subject it to intense fire for one calcination. Then place it in the furnace sheath to smelt into supreme treasure. Once the numinous elixir is achieved, even tiles and pebbles can become gold. Yet without boiling and refining with bitter wine, bitter vinegar, golden salt, or jade ferment, it cannot be accomplished. This principle is profoundly subtle and not transmitted in the world—scholars should nevertheless be aware of it.

**Thirteen: On Ash Frost**
Ash frost is the essence and sap of plants and trees, salty in taste and highly toxic, corrosive to the five metals. Thus, elixir alchemists often dare not use it. Yet when used to boil and refine the eight stones, it instantly repels fire, wielding immense power. If one masters the technique to eliminate its saltiness, prolongs the firing, and nurtures it over time, it too can be transformed. Its viridian toxicity can penetrate metal and stone. When used in boiling and refining, it often reduces medicines to liquid. If this occurs, the medicine is dead—do not discard it lightly.

As the classics say: *"Only when its form is no longer visible is it truly dead."* This refers precisely to such cases. Immediately pour the medicinal water into a vessel for settling. After more than ten days, when the upper portion is clear and the lower turbid, decant the clear liquid and boil it down into frost. The sediment at the bottom is the medicine.

After drying by boiling, place it into a sealed vessel for refinement, and boil it into frost. Press down the head, nurture it with fire for seven days—or fourteen days—and the medicine will truly be dead. Then grind it finely, dissolve it with boiling water, and stir evenly before returning it to a settling vessel. If the medicine sinks to the bottom, again decant the clear upper water and discard it, replacing it with fresh water to settle. The settling must be done with patience; otherwise, the medicine will flow away with the water. Only when the saltiness is entirely removed, and it is refined over a great fire for a long time, does this medicine become efficacious. When used to transmute and refine various stones, it can serve as the highest-grade medicinal agent—it must not be dismissed as mere ash-frost. I have tested this with reliable results.

What Ge Xuan called "ash-frost" is the lowest method, and all medicines reject it as dead. Yet if it undergoes transformation, it too can become a superior method—this is no falsehood. However, for refining saltpeter, borax, roasted alum, or vitriol, this method of boiling must never be used.

**Fourteenth Discussion: Soot**
Soot is the divine blackness of plants and trees, and many alchemical practitioners also employ it. Yet its essence is insufficient to refine and nurture the various stones, and its full efficacy is rarely seen. If, after boiling and refining with the original herbs, soot is pressed onto the head and placed in the furnace for gentle nurturing, it can then subdue fire. Used alone, however, it cannot succeed. I have personally tested this with success and record it here.

**Fifteenth Discussion: Preparing the Decoction**
Whenever herbs are used to boil and refine the various stones, fresh herb juice is best. How can one know that one herb governs one medicine? If the herb is not toxic, the medicine will not die. Though people may not perceive its toxicity at first glance, upon closer inspection, it is indeed toxic. The sages of old, fearing that herb toxins would damage and diminish the medicine’s nature, preventing it from achieving spiritual efficacy, thus established the method of preparing the decoction. The proper technique is to press the herbs for their natural juice, place it in a clean vessel, and cover it with paper. In spring and autumn, let it stand for three days; in summer, two days; in winter, five days. Then strain off the clear liquid from the top and use it to boil the medicine. In this way, the medicine’s nature will not be damaged or diminished, and its full efficacy can be achieved. Testing confirms its effectiveness.

**Sixteenth Discussion: Arrangement and Refinement**
In the great method of elixir arrangement and refinement, manual technique is of utmost importance. Without clarity on this, even if one possesses true lead or true earth, the mother and child will be mixed, the new and old intermingled, and it will be impossible to determine what is correct. Thus, in the method of cyclic refinement, the ancestral technique of arrangement comes first. For instance, when using the Eight Stones vessel to nurture the various medicines—such as those like arsenolite, roasted orpiment, and realgar, which are made into liquid—these should only be packed at the bottom of the vessel, with dead vessel medicines pressed on top, then sealed and nurtured with fire. As for terms like "spreading at the bottom, covering the top," or "my lotus" and other such names, these refer specifically to the method of nurturing cinnabar, mercuric sulfide, and mother cinnabar. When nurturing mother cinnabar, one must also use plum-nucleus stone, lotus-pod medicines, gourds, and other such agents to secure it before placing it in the vessel for gentle nurturing. Without this, there will inevitably be loss. Furthermore, when using true earth or true lead to nurture the three cinnabars—such as in a sulfur vessel, where raw sulfur must be placed against the body; in a cinnabar vessel, where raw cinnabar must be placed against the body; and only in vessels for the Four Spirits, Three Yellows, true lead, and the like, where powdered frost must be placed against the body—each must be paired according to its kind, adhering to the principle of "like nurtures like, while unlike causes death." Though these may seem like trivial details, without knowing the path, success cannot be attained.
