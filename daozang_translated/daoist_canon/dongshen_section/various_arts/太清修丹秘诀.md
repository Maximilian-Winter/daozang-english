### **Method for Gathering and Cultivating Divine Cinnabar to Refine the Elixir**

This method begins on the first day of the twelfth lunar month, when one first fortifies the qi with fine wine, delicacies, meat, and medicinal supplements. Then, in the following first lunar month, one observes a prolonged fast and abstains from anger and desire—this "prolonged fast" refers to restraining the upper desires.

In the second month, the cinnabar is sown, and the fasting practices are maintained. The method for sowing cinnabar is as follows: after midnight and before noon, first perform the usual *daoyin* exercises, then exhale with the "xu" sound eight times. Next, gather saliva and rinse the mouth until it is abundant, waiting until one has swallowed a hundred mouthfuls. Swallow from the left side, guiding it slowly downward with the mind until it reaches the *dantian*. Then, descend the heart-fire, rotating leftward eighty-one times. For the sowing medicine, gather and rinse the saliva at least seven times; if one has strength remaining, there is no limit to the number of mouthfuls, but one should proceed according to one’s capacity.

Within seven days, the golden cinnabar will descend. From then on, use fifteen white, fine porcelain basins day and night, each covered with a paper lid labeled with the day’s number. When all basins are filled, begin with the first one to wash and collect the golden cinnabar. Repeat this cycle, as the cinnabar accumulates over days, valuing its settling and coagulation. Each washing requires changing the water four or five times. Collect the cinnabar on ash paper, dry it over smoke, and store it. Half a catty is sufficient.

If the cinnabar collected in the second month is insufficient, continue gathering until the third month, stopping only when the required amount is reached. On the first day of the sixth month, follow the method of the twelfth month, again fortifying with fine wine, delicacies, and meat. From the first to the seventh month, observe a daily fast, abstaining from desire and anger. In the eighth month, perform the cinnabar-sowing method as in the second month, collecting half a catty of cinnabar as before. If the amount is still insufficient, continue until the ninth month, stopping only when the required amount is reached.

Then, combine the golden cinnabar gathered in spring and autumn—one catty in total—and store it in a clean vessel, sealing it tightly. Wait until the tenth month to observe a prolonged fast, and on the first day of the eleventh month, begin the work. Divide the previous catty of medicine evenly into fifteen portions, and further divide each portion into three parts. Each day, at the hours of *zi*, *yin*, and *chen*, take one part three times. Begin on the first day and finish by the full moon.

Each time the medicine is taken, first refine one portion in the mouth with saliva. Swallow three times on an empty stomach, then take the medicine, guiding it with the mind to the *dantian*. Circulate the fire according to the *Qian-Kun* strategy, taking three portions daily at the three designated times. After each dose, take a small amount of talcum powder with boiled saliva to suppress the cinnabar. Also, take a small amount of frankincense to facilitate the cinnabar’s movement.

On the days the cinnabar is taken, after noon, practice breath-holding and only circulate water—meaning only swallow saliva. From the day after the full moon onward, at the hours after *zi* and before *wu*, practice only breath-holding and qi circulation—meaning only swallow qi three times. After the end of the eleventh month, cease further practice. On the last and first days of each month, only hold the breath thirty-six times, exhaling when the qi reaches its limit.

Each day, eat only two meals of plain, well-cooked white rice, no more than three *liang* in total—this is also considered a form of "fire." Wait until the cinnabar no longer descends, signaling the completion of the work and the attainment of the "leakless" elixir. After the fifteenth day of the eleventh month, if the golden cinnabar is not yet mature but occasionally descends, one must intentionally gather it and not neglect or discard it, for the cinnabar already contains the efficacy of the method. Only when the golden cinnabar ceases to descend is the "leakless elixir" complete. The descended golden cinnabar should also be taken in turn.

After the elixir is completed, one may eat and drink freely, taking several meals a day. When full, exhale to expel the food, which will gradually leave no residue or filth. Urination will cease, and one may go a full year without eating yet suffer no hunger or weakness, becoming an Earthly Immortal forever. The work is generally completed within one year.

During the practice, if one experiences dizziness, blurred vision, or loose teeth, these are signs of excessive yang. Simply drink a thick decoction of licorice frequently to resolve it.

This is the secret method for golden cinnabar, a technique for refining the inner medicine that transforms the mortal body into that of an Earthly Immortal.

### **The True Lead Formula of the Great Medicine by Master Chongxu**

Cinnabar is formed from the essence of the sun and moon, congealing into substance. Since cinnabar can be refined to extract mercury, and mercury is the essence of the sun, cinnabar can also be used to gather lead, which is the qi of the moon. If one can extract the lead within cinnabar, it can be paired with the mercury within cinnabar to refine the supreme medicine, thus harmonizing yin and yang. This is the true mercury and true lead; refining them ensures success without fail.

Thus, Master Shentu’s three-character formula states:
*Originally one thing, divided into two bodies—*
*One resembles lead, the other mercury.*

An ancient adage says:
*One mother bears two children—*
*One son and one daughter.*
These two are lead and mercury.

If one obtains true lead and wishes to refine the supreme medicine, the furnace, crucible, fire timing, and methods of preparation and ingestion are all detailed in the various elixir classics. The only difficulty lies in recognizing this true lead.

The formula states:
*The flowing golden essence nourishes the myriad spirits,*
*Naturally achieving immortality and longevity.*
*The divine medicine does not rely on external substances;*
*Yin and yang restrain each other and naturally coalesce.*

**Liver**
Four positions balance under the sovereign’s rule,
Alone dwelling in *jia-yi*, it claims supremacy.
Yet in the end, it yields to the fire within *li*,
Suddenly entering the second gate of the southern palace.

**Heart**
Square in shape, an inch in size, called the Hall of Spirit,
The virtue of fire generates it—how great!
Wait until the six yang numbers are complete,
Then the true lead flows westward.

**Lungs**
Externally corresponding to the White Tiger of the west,
Autumn’s qi congeals into the skin like frost.
Now that the numinous harmony is attained,
Gradually the Original Lord’s Dao grows abundant.

**Kidneys**
A sea of jade waves lies in the north—
Who could journey thus to the Metal Realm?
Soon the Reverted Elixir will be complete,
Yet the work of ascending fire knows no measure.

**Spleen**
Radiant with five colors, stirring the golden essence,
Sweet and harmonious in flavor—here the medicine is formed.
How fine when the hundred spirits all bow in reverence,
As the Central Plain’s Son of Heaven celebrates peace and ascent.

**Further Formula**
The cosmos is the primordial crucible, the medicine resides within the body,
Yin and yang unfathomable—this is called the numinous.
Primordial qi flies as frost through the nine transformations,
The Reverted Elixir is none other than the essence of Great Harmony.

When the mists and rosy clouds wish to depart, how shall they depart?
First, the golden essence must fly from behind the elbow.
Once the golden essence reaches the Upper Palace,
The Central and Lower Palaces all come to welcome it.
Naturally, jade mercury trickles forth,
Rushing back to the Original Sea with thunderous roar.
From this, husband and wife meet in harmony,
Joy surges, leaping beyond all bounds.
Water and fire unite, each half inquiring of the other,
And in the end, Earth and Heaven are inverted to form *Tai*.
Through the double gates of the spine to the crown,
This is the root of the path of cultivation.
The Jade Pool’s nectar should be swallowed often,
As the Purple Mansion’s Original Lord ascends straight upward.
Let the qi constantly surge through the joints,
And naturally essence will solidify and the Valley Spirit abide.
One day, when drawn to the Land of Longevity,
Gratitude must be repaid to those who guided the way.

Now, the true yang of fluids—clear, bright, sweet, and pure—
First arises from the Cinnabar Origin,
And from the true qi of the five viscera.
It can again generate the Cinnabar Origin
And the true qi of the five viscera:
Entering the liver, it becomes qi;
Entering the heart, it generates blood;
Entering the spleen, it produces the Yellow Sprout;
Entering the lungs, it generates fluids;
Entering the kidneys, it generates essence.
It replenishes the brain, strengthens the body,
Fortifies sinews and bones, brightens the complexion,
Firms the skin, and prevents leakage or dissipation—
This is called *qi abiding*, this is called the Elixir,
And thus the Original Spirit is attained.

The *Hunyuan Jing* states:
Heaven and Earth fashioned humanity.
The father is Wood, his essence is Fire—
These two images are fundamentally one qi.
Wood is the ruler, Fire its function.
The mother is Metal, her essence is Water—
Metal is the ruler, Water its function.
Father and mother, essence and qi—
These four images, when they encounter Earth, generate one another;
Without Earth, they restrain one another.
The mother’s palace is true Earth.
When the four images’ qi reach this palace,
They naturally harmonize and gather as treasure.
Spirit, qi, and essence serve as the master of the body.
Spirit is the qi of the spleen;
Qi is the qi of Metal and Water;
Essence is the qi of Fire and Wood—
These are the Three Marvels of the human body.

The *Zhouhou Jue* states:
Yin and yang revolve, qi transforms into essence,
Essence transforms into cinnabar, cinnabar into mercury,
Mercury into gold, gold into medicine—
Called Golden Sand, refined into the Reverted Elixir.
The qi of the Original Sea coalesces as Black Lead;
The qi of the left kidney coalesces as Red Lead.

**The Two Applications of Kan and Li**
The formula states:
To attain longevity, cultivate the root of what gives you life,
Beginning with essence and qi.
Essence and qi coalesce to form the body—
Thus know the body as the root that receives qi,
And qi as the root of the formed.
Yet qi, without form, has no means to take shape.
At the time of receiving primordial qi,
It lies hidden below the mother’s navel,
In the three months of chaos, the Mysterious Female is complete.
The Mysterious Female is the mouth and nose.
Once the Mysterious Female is established,
Like a melon with its stem, yin infuses the mother’s qi,
Beginning here.
The mother exhales, the child exhales with her;
The mother inhales, the child inhales with her.
Ten months pass in continuity, qi suffices, spirit is complete—
The fetus departs the mother, delighting in the child,
Unaware that the body is depleting externally.
Transforming from infant to child, pointing at the cheek and laughing.
The *Xianzhen Yi* states:
This is the root of losing the Dao.
How much more so when, at fifteen, one becomes a youth,
At twenty, a young man—
Eyes dazzled by the five colors,
Ears attuned to the five sounds,
Wielding intelligence and deploying spirit,
Scarcely pausing for breath—
Thus the root of pure simplicity is utterly lost.
Therefore, the sage, knowing external pursuits are futile,
Returns to the origin and reverts to the root,
Grasping the fetal breath to attain the formula of longevity and immortality—
Its principle is clear.

The *Zhongtai Jing* states:
Within the body, mother and child—why not guard them?
The body and qi are the mother, the spirit and qi are the child.
The body and qi are established first, then the spirit arises.
Spirit and qi move together,
Circulating among the viscera,
Directing breath upward and downward.
With long practice,
The spirit becomes luminous, the qi harmonious.
When the spirit is luminous, it illumines the five viscera;
When the qi is harmonious, it flows through the four limbs.
Thus the *Huangdi Neijing* speaks of a single spirit-light,
Internally generating the continuous five viscera—
This saying may be inferred and understood.

The *Huangting Jing* states:
Immortal and Daoist are not inherently numinous—
Accumulating essence and amassing qi makes one true.
All these are its wonders.
Yet in today’s world, spirit and qi move separately,
Mother and child do not guard one another.
Though qi breathes within, the spirit constantly operates without—
Thus qi follows impurity and dims,
And primordial qi gradually scatters.
For the spirit is the master of the body,
Yet the master of the dwelling does not tend to the interior,
But spends each day externally—
Naturally, the dwelling becomes empty and gradually deteriorates.
Those who are not men of the Dao labor the spirit and toil the qi,
Never resting for a breath within the body—
They are far from the Dao.
When spirit and qi reach their destination,
And mother and child circulate,
The gate of cultivation is not far off.
The two applications of Kan and Li—
Thus it is said: begin with the yang line in *Jiji*,
Begin with the yin line in *Weiji*.
The two trigrams proceed together, cycling endlessly,
Seizing the full work of Heaven and Earth’s creation—
This is the essential technique of the immortals’ life-mechanism.
Therefore it is said:
The White Tiger is born from Kan,
The Azure Dragon lies hidden in Li.

The *Book of Changes* states: "Great indeed is Qian! Firm and strong, central and correct, purely refined and essence." This speaks of Qian’s body as pure yang, its nature utterly firm, its movement utterly strong, central, and correct—referring to the second and fifth lines—hence it is called "firm, strong, central, and correct." For those who cultivate qi, they transform the water-fire images of *Jiji* and *Weiji*, making all six lines yang to complete the body of Qian, thus achieving purity. Pure and unadulterated, it becomes luminous and essence—hence it is called "purely refined and essence."

Moreover, the third and fifth lines are yang positions, symbols of generation, while the second, fourth, and sixth are yin positions, signifying gathering and restraint. Yang arises as fire, yin arises as water. In the human body, water and fire, when they intersect, are called *Jiji*. If one practices this hexagram, its efficacy equals that of all sixty-four hexagrams. As yang fire ascends and reaches its extreme, it generates yin; as yin water descends, it naturally generates yang. The fire dragon’s mercury, with its clear qi, spirals leftward; the water tiger’s lead, with its turbid qi, moves rightward—both circulating within the body. Yang’s seven returns to refine the golden elixir until *yin* (3–5 a.m.), yin’s nine reverts to restore the jade liquid until *zi* (11 p.m.–1 a.m.). These two substances naturally move—one counterflow, one compliant—entering the five viscera, permeating the body, ceaseless day and night. Thus one attains longevity, modeling oneself on Heaven and Earth. Therefore, Heaven does not speak, yet the four seasons proceed; Earth does not speak, yet the myriad things grow; humans do not speak, yet the supreme Dao is accomplished. Such oral instructions are not transmitted in writing. If one is fortunate enough to meet a like-minded seeker, one may briefly outline their general principles.
