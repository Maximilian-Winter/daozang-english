**Preface to *The Daode Zhenjing with Imperial Commentary by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang***

Of old, the Primordial Sage expounded profound words, laying the foundation of the true teaching and enlightening future generations. Though his legacy endures in written form, its subtle meanings have often strayed. To grasp its essential purport, even the likes of Yan [Zun] of Shu and [Yin] Wen of He fell short. To excerpt its passages, some from the school of Master He omitted key points. The rest have grown increasingly obscure, scarcely worth mention. Shall the wondrous intent of our Mysterious Origin thus fade into oblivion?

Though I am of humble and shallow virtue, I have long been moved by this text. Having inherited the blessing of posterity, I fear losing the principle of non-action. Whenever I enjoy moments of leisure, I knock upon the gate of the Mysterious, and as insights arise, I have composed this commentary. It does not presume to establish a singular interpretation but merely serves to supplement what has been lost or overlooked.

Now, as I lay down my brush, I consult the assembled ministers, officials, commoners, and the Daoist and Buddhist communities: if any can rouse my understanding like Zibu [Zeng Shen] or cure my errors like Zuoshi [Zuozhuan], thirsting to embrace what is good—I remain open and eager to receive it. Should one truly fulfill these words, I shall bestow generous rewards.

Yet flatterers who claim self-sufficiency do not belong to this company, nor do those who boast in markets and streets, for theirs are but petty arts. Since I do not forbid frank speech, all may speak plainly, lest future generations mock me and compound my lack of virtue.

**Fascicle One of *The Daode Zhenjing with Imperial Commentary by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang***
**The Classic of the Dao (Part One)**

**Chapter One: The Dao That Can Be Spoken**

The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.

The Dao is the wondrous function of utmost emptiness.
The name arises from what things attain and are called.
Its function may apply to things, thus it is called "the Dao that can be spoken."
Names arise from function, thus it is called "the name that can be named."
Yet its application knows no bounds—it is not confined to one Dao.
Things differ, and so do names—thus they are not confined to one name.
This is why we forcibly call it the Dao, though the Dao is eternally nameless.

Nameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.
Named, it is the mother of the myriad things.
Nameless is the wondrous root.
The wondrous root manifests as qi, the origin of Heaven and Earth.
Heaven and Earth draw from this beginning, hence it is called "nameless."
Named is its application.
Through its application, it crafts and nurtures the myriad things.
Things receive its nurture, hence it is called "named."

Constantly without desire, observe its mystery.
Constantly with desire, observe its manifestations.
Humans are tranquil at birth—this is Heaven’s nature.
Stirred by things, they move—this is nature’s desire.
If one constantly guards purity and stillness, unties the heart and releases the spirit,
returning to illuminate the true nature, then one beholds the wondrous root.
If one does not rectify their nature, emotions follow desire and move,
nature lost to desire, deluded about the Dao’s origin—
to seek the wondrous root is but to see its outer edges.

These two emerge from the same source yet bear different names.
As above, both arise from the Dao, hence they are called "the same."
Movement issues in application, and names are established according to use—thus the names differ.
Yet their sameness is called the profound.
Though their emergence yields different names, their sameness is called the profound.
Profound means deep and wondrous.
Profound within the profound—this is the gate of all mysteries.
When thoughts do not arise, one merges with the profound and wondrous.
Yet fearing attachment to the profound as a hindrance, failing to reach complete forgetting,
one lodges in the "profound within the profound" to relinquish even the profound.
To thus embody desirelessness within desirelessness—
all dharmas emerge from this, hence it is called the gate of all mysteries.

**Chapter Two: When All Under Heaven Know**

When all under Heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises.
When all know goodness as goodness, un-goodness arises.
Beauty and goodness arise from the heart’s desires.
If the heart desires something, even the ugly becomes beautiful, the un-good becomes good.
Thus it is said, "When all know"—they take what they deem beautiful as beauty,
what they deem good as goodness.
Beauty and goodness have no fixed essence; both are delusory emotions.
All stem from clinging to being and non-being, distinguishing difficulty and ease,
the wondrous and the putrid, each vying to overcome the other.
The great sage, weighing these, deeply knows their emptiness and falsity—
hence it is said, "ugliness arises."

Thus being and non-being produce each other,
difficulty and ease complete each other,
long and short shape each other,
high and low incline toward each other,
sound and voice harmonize with each other,
front and back follow each other.
These six are mutually opposed yet alternately serve as names—
just like beauty and ugliness, they do not arise from self-nature
but from delusory emotions, giving rise to these many distinctions.

Therefore the sage abides in non-action and practices the teaching without words.
Non-action means no action—yet it is called "abiding" by borrowing the name of action.
The teaching without words means forgetting words—yet it is called "practicing" by borrowing the name of teaching.
The myriad things arise yet he does not refuse them,
allowing each to move and act without the sage’s intervention.
He gives life yet does not possess,
acts yet does not rely,
accomplishes yet does not dwell.
He allows the myriad things to each fulfill their lives without claiming ownership,
to each attain their deeds without presumption—
thus the great peace is accomplished.
Yet he remains daily vigilant, never daring to rest.
Only by not dwelling does it not depart.
Only by never resting and ever cultivating virtue—
forgetting merit while merit endures—does it not depart by not dwelling.

**Chapter Three: Not Exalting the Worthy**

Not exalting the worthy prevents the people from contending.
Exalting the worthy creates traces; following traces breeds contention.
Let the worthy and unworthy each fulfill their proper roles, and there will be no contention.
Not prizing rare goods prevents the people from becoming thieves.
Rare goods are those beyond one’s inherent nature—
sought yet unattainable, hence called "rare."
To abandon one’s proper nature and covet what one lacks—
having lost one’s nature, is this not theft?
Desire that things follow their nature and affairs match their capacities—
then rare goods will not be prized, and the passions of life and destiny will not become thieves.

Not displaying what is desirable keeps the heart from confusion.
Without traces of exalting the worthy or seeking rare goods,
there is nothing desirable to be seen, and the heart is not deluded.

Thus the sage’s governance:
empties the heart,
fills the belly,
weakens the will,
strengthens the bones.
Always keeps the people without knowledge and without desire—
always keeps them without contentious knowledge or covetous desires.
Even those with knowledge dare not act.
Through pure stillness, all are transformed, utterly without knowledge or desire.
If any with knowledge remain, they are made to dare not act.
Act through non-action, and nothing is left ungoverned.
In acting through non-action, people attain their nature, and pure transformation is trustworthy.

**Chapter Four: The Dao Is Empty**

The Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible—seemingly not full.
The Dao moves and issues forth the harmonious qi, giving rise to generation and completion.
Though it is the Dao of generation and completion, it never overflows.
"Seemingly" is used because one dare not speak of the Dao directly.
Abyssal, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things.
Abyssal means deep and still.
The Dao constantly generates things yet never overflows;
its wondrous root is abyssal and profoundly still, hence it seems the ancestor of the myriad things.
It blunts their sharpness, unties their tangles—
the Dao, through harmony, can restrain sharpness and dissolve entanglements.
If worldly learning seeks to return, it only becomes more knotted.
It harmonizes their light, blends with their dust.

**The Dao Is Everywhere**

The Dao is nowhere absent, yet where it abides, there is always emptiness.
In light, in dust—it is one with all.
Light and dust are but light and dust, yet the wondrous root is neither light nor dust.
Profound and still, it seems to endure.
Though it harmonizes with light and blends with dust, its wondrous root remains unstained—hence, profound and still, it seems to abide.
I know not whose child it is, but it seems to precede the image of the Lord.
I know not from whence the Dao arises, for it is clear the Dao is not a created thing. Thus, it has no parent, and seems only to exist before the Lord.
The Lord is the master of all generation.
"Image" means semblance.

**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth**

Heaven and earth are not benevolent; they regard the myriad things as straw dogs.
The sage is not benevolent; he regards the hundred clans as straw dogs.
"Not benevolent" means they do not act with benevolent kindness.
"Straw dogs" are dogs made of straw.
When dogs guard and defend, they are covered with care.
But straw dogs, though shaped like dogs, serve no purpose of warning or barking—thus, they are without feeling or love.
This means heaven and earth view humanity as humanity views straw dogs, without expectation or esteem.

Let us consider this: the utmost benevolence has no favorites—who then practices universal love?
Love that is partial is not true love.
If one does not favor only one’s own kin, then all under heaven are kin.
If one does not cherish only one’s own children, then all under heaven are cherished.
Thus, the utmost benevolence, though without favorites, is in truth all-embracing—how could this be universal love?

Between heaven and earth, is it not like a bellows?
The *tuo* is a bellows, the *yue* a flute.
The bellows drives the wind, the flute carries the breath—both are empty and without intent, yet they move and respond.
Thus, between heaven and earth, the generation of things without partiality also arises from emptiness and absence of intent.
Empty yet inexhaustible, moving yet ever issuing forth.
The bellows, though empty, does not bend; when set in motion, its sound issues forth all the more.
This illustrates how the sage’s heart, free from partiality, knows no exhaustion, and his responses are inexhaustible—truly, moving yet ever issuing forth.
The more one speaks, the sooner one is exhausted; better to hold fast to the center.
Excessive speech meets no response, and thus one is often brought to exhaustion.
Universal love is difficult to extend to all, and instead breeds resentment—better to embrace and hold to the center, where all is naturally sufficient.

**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit**

The valley spirit does not die—
The "valley" is emptiness that can respond.
The "spirit" is the wondrous and unfathomable.
"Death" means cessation.
The valley’s echo gives no sign of its origin.
When moved, it responds—its response is like the spirit, never ceasing.
This illustrates that the utmost Dao, though empty, generates things, and its wondrous function is beyond naming—hence the analogy of the valley spirit.
This is called the mysterious female.
"Mysterious" means profound.
"Female" means mother.
The valley spirit responds to things with an inexhaustible, harmonious function—profound and boundless, it mothers the myriad things.
Thus, the valley spirit is given the name "mysterious female," to illustrate the great Dao’s power of generation and nurturance.
The gate of the mysterious female is called the root of heaven and earth.
The profound, empty female mothers the myriad things, and all things emerge from it—this is called the gate.
Heaven and earth have form, and thus rely upon it as their root.
Ever-flowing, it seems to endure; its use is never labored.
The function of the empty female is ever-flowing and subtle.
Though it responds as if present, its use is without intent—thus, it is never labored.

**Chapter Seven: Heaven Endures, Earth Abides**

Heaven endures, earth abides.
Heaven and earth are said to endure and abide because, being without partiality or intent, they can be long-lasting.
This analogy culminates in the sage, who places himself last and yet comes first, who treats himself as external and yet remains—without partiality, he achieves partiality.
The reason heaven and earth can be long-lasting is that they do not live for themselves—thus, they attain long life.
Heaven and earth generate things, their virtue and function vast, yet they endure and abide because they draw from the Dao and do not claim credit for their acts of generation.
Thus, the sage places himself last and yet comes first; he treats himself as external and yet remains.
Placing himself last, others gladly push him forward—thus, he comes first.
Treating himself as external, his heart is serene and detached—thus, he remains.
Is it not because he is without partiality?
Thus, he achieves his partiality.
Heaven and earth forget their acts of generation and nurturance—this is without partiality.
Yet they endure and abide—this is achieving their partiality.
The sage places himself last and treats himself as external—this is without partiality, yet he comes first and remains—this is achieving his partiality.

**Chapter Eight: The Highest Virtue Is Like Water**

The highest virtue is like water.
To illustrate the supreme virtue of the utmost person, the nature of water is used as an analogy for its nearness to the Dao.
Water benefits the myriad things without contention, dwelling in places all shun—thus, it is near to the Dao.
"Near" means close.
It dwells in good earth—
The person of highest virtue abides in softness and weakness, just as water dwells in the earth, nourishing all.
Earth is useful in its lowliness; water delights in flowing downward.
Its heart is good and deep—
His mind is profoundly still, just as water pools in the depths.
It befriends good benevolence—
His giving accords with the utmost benevolence, just as water nourishes all things.
His words are good and trustworthy—
His speech is truthful, just as water, though it flows through peril, never loses its reliability.
His governance is good and ordered—
His rule brings good order, just as water washes and cleanses all things, leaving them pure and still.
His affairs are good and capable—
In affairs, he is good at adapting, just as water takes the shape of its vessel, never clinging to things.
His actions are good and timely—
He responds to things without missing the moment, just as water melts in spring and freezes in winter.
It is only because he does not contend that he is without blame.
The person of highest virtue, with an empty heart and in harmony with things, is like water—whether dammed or released, it never opposes things—thus, he is without fault.

**Chapter Nine: Holding and Filling**

To hold and fill it is not as good as stopping.
To grasp and fill to the brim, striving to prevent loss, is to accumulate burdens—regret and misfortune will surely arise.
Thus, it is better to stop.
"Stop" means to cease.

**Sharpening and Honing**

To hone and sharpen it is not to be long preserved.
Measuring and sharpening, pursuing glory and fame—wealth and rank will breed arrogance, inviting calamity and fault, thus it cannot be long preserved.
Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can guard them.
This clarifies that fullness is difficult to sustain.
Wealth and rank breed arrogance, bringing fault upon oneself.
This clarifies that sharpness must not be honed.
Arrogance arises from the heart, thus fault comes from no other source.
When merit is achieved and fame attained, withdraw the self—this is the Way of Heaven.
When merit is achieved and fame attained, one should withdraw the self to decline excess, just as the Way of Heaven empties and fills in due time, thus free from care and misfortune.

**Chapter Ten: Carrying the Po and Embracing the One**

Carrying the po and embracing the One—can they not be separated?
At the beginning of life, it is called po; after birth, it is called hun.
The po is yin and empty; the hun is yang and full. It speaks of a person carrying the empty po, ever needing to nurture and restore yang.
When yang qi is abundant, the po becomes hun, and the hun can move—thus life is complete.
The One is undivided.
Restoring yang and completing life must not be tainted or mixed, thus one is commanded to embrace and guard pure oneness—can it not be separated from the body?
Concentrating qi to attain softness—can one be like an infant?
Focusing on the harmonious qi to make it gentle and soft—can one be like an infant, without discrimination?
Cleansing and purifying profound vision—can one be without flaw?
Profound vision is the illumination of the heart.
Flaw is blemish and fault.
Cleansing the illumination of the heart to make it pure and still—can one be without blemish?
Loving the people and governing the state—can one act without action?
Nurturing the multitudes and governing the state—can one act without action?
This is called self-transformation.
From the above, carrying the po is all teaching for cultivating the self.
When the self is cultivated, virtue is complete—thus one can be a ruler.
The gates of Heaven open and close—can one be the female?
The gates of Heaven are where the reckoning of destiny emerges.
Opening and closing refer to order and chaos.
It speaks of the ruler responding to the mandate and receiving destiny, able to guard the female and stillness—thus one can eternally preserve Heaven’s blessing.
Another explanation: The *Book of Changes* says, "One closing and one opening is called change." It speaks of the sage governing the times, responding to change without constancy, not achieving with the male but guarding the female and the receptive, just as the gates of Heaven open and close, diminishing the full and increasing the humble.
Understanding and penetrating the four directions—can one be without knowledge?
If the ruler can be the female and still, then the people will joyfully uphold his virtue, understanding as the sun illuminates the four directions—yet he must forget merit and not act as master, thus it says: can one be without knowledge?
Giving life and nurturing, giving life yet not possessing, acting yet not relying, growing yet not ruling—this is called profound virtue.
Allowing all things to follow their life and nurturing them.
Following life yet not claiming it as one’s own, acting yet not relying on merit, presiding yet not ruling—if the ruler can do this, it is called profound virtue.

**Chapter Eleven: The Thirty Spokes**

Thirty spokes share one hub—where there is nothing, there is the use of the cart.
This clarifies that the functions of being and non-being mutually support and establish each other.
The thirty spokes illustrate the making of a cart.
Sharing one hub means that the few encompass the many.
The presence of shafts and carriage together makes the cart, yet the emptiness within allows it to function.
If there were no presence of shafts and carriage, there would be no cart to use.
If the cart were not empty within, the presence of shafts and carriage would be discarded.
Kneading clay to make a vessel—where there is nothing, there is the use of the vessel.
Kneading is harmonizing; clay is earth. The potter harmonizes earth to make vessels of clay.
Carving doors and windows to make a room—where there is nothing, there is the use of the room.
In ancient times, caves were dug to make dwellings, and doors and windows were also carved—thus it says "carving."
Therefore, being is for the sake of benefit, non-being is for the sake of use.
The benefit of form serves non-being; the use of non-being serves being.
Moreover, that which is above form is called the Dao; that which is below form is called the vessel. To clarify the use of the supreme Dao, it is illustrated through form and substance—thus borrowing the benefit of coarse being and non-being to illuminate the use of subtle non-being.

**Chapter Twelve: The Five Colors**

The five colors blind the eyes; the five tones deafen the ears; the five flavors dull the mouth.
The eyes delight in the sights of blue and yellow; the ears indulge in the sounds of gong and zhi; the mouth savors the tastes of fine meats—excessive harm injures the body, causing deafness and blindness.
Racing and hunting stir the heart to madness.
Racing through duties, indulging in action, like hunting, only seeking slaughter—daily the heart contends, chasing after objects, and when still, reflecting on it, it is a madness.
Rare and precious goods hinder conduct.
What is not within one’s nature, even if sought, cannot be obtained.

Seeking the unattainable harms the practice of the Dao—thus the sage acts for the belly, not for the eyes, and so discards that to embrace this. Embracing this receptive belly, discarding those deluded eyes.

**Chapter Thirteen: Favor and Disgrace**

Favor and disgrace are both startling.
Grasping them brings trembling; relinquishing them brings sorrow—since favor and disgrace are not forgotten, both provoke alarm.
Regard great trouble as you regard the body.
The body is the root of trouble; to prize the body is to prize great trouble.
This might have read, "Regard the body as you regard great trouble," yet it says, "Regard great trouble as you regard the body"—to show that the very act of prizing the body is itself great trouble.
To prize is to take the body as a great sigh, thus it says, "Regard great trouble as you regard the body."
*Ru* means "as."
These two lines form the main statement.
What is meant by "favor and disgrace"?
Favor is inferior.
Having stated that favor and disgrace provoke alarm, it now asks what they mean, lest one fail to understand.
To gain favor breeds arrogance, which invariably invites disaster—thus favor is the root of disgrace, and the answer is that favor is inferior.
To gain it is alarming; to lose it is alarming—this is what is meant by "favor and disgrace are both startling."
Favor and disgrace cycle endlessly, with favor as the root of disgrace.
Ordinary minds, deluded and stagnant, are startled by disgrace but not by favor—thus the sage warns: when you gain favor, be as alarmed as if you had gained disgrace; when you lose favor and gain disgrace, heed my warning and be as fearful as when you gained favor.
Thus it concludes: this is what is meant by "favor and disgrace are both startling."
What is meant by "regard great trouble as you regard the body"?
It asks lest one fail to grasp that the body itself is the root of trouble.
The reason I have great trouble is that I have a body.
The body’s form is illusory, fundamentally unreal—yet it becomes the root of trouble because I cling to its existence, subject to pain, illness, cold, and heat.
But if I had no body, what trouble would I have?
To know that heaven and earth’s harmony is not mine to possess, to leave form and abandon cunning, to realize the body is not the body—this is to merge with the great flow. What trouble could there be?
Thus, one who prizes the body as if for the world may be entrusted with the world.
One who cherishes the body as if for the world may be charged with the world.
This chapter first sets forth the warning against favor and disgrace, then concludes with entrustment—because if favor and disgrace provoke alarm, one has not forgotten favor and attachment.
Since favor and attachment are not forgotten, comparing disgrace to favor shows disgrace is not as valued as favor; comparing prizing to cherishing shows prizing is not as valued as cherishing.
Those startled by favor and disgrace still harbor them in mind; those who retain prizing and cherishing have not yet humbly forgotten the world.
Thus, it first teaches alarm at favor as if it were disgrace, then aims to make one forget both favor and disgrace entirely—using the near-term notion of entrustment to clarify the ultimate state of complete forgetting.
Forget favor and disgrace, and nothing remains to startle; forget the body, and it is no longer the root of trouble; forget the world, and there is no near-term notion of entrustment.

**Chapter Fourteen: The Unseen**

Look for it and it cannot be seen—it is called *yí*.
This describes the Dao.
*Yí* means level and easy.
The Dao is not color, so it cannot be seen.
Yet within the colorless, it alone can give rise to color—thus it is called *yí*.
Listen for it and it cannot be heard—it is called *xī*.
*Xī* means the subtlest of sounds.
The Dao is not sound, so it cannot be heard.
Yet within the soundless, it alone can harmonize—thus it is called *xī*.
Grasp for it and it cannot be held—it is called *wēi*.
*Wēi* means wondrous.
The Dao is formless, so it cannot be grasped.
Yet within the formless, it alone can give rise to form—thus it is called *wēi*.
These three cannot be further questioned, so they merge into one.
These three are meant to question the Dao, yet the Dao transcends sound, color, form, and law—thus questioning yields nothing, only *yí*, *xī*, and *wēi*.
The Dao is not *yí*, *xī*, or *wēi*, so they merge into one.
Above, it is not bright; below, it is not dim.
What is above must be bright; what is below must be dim—yet the Dao, though above, is not above, and though above, is not bright; though below, is not below, and though below, is not dim.
Ceaseless and unnameable, it returns to nothingness.
*Shéngshéng* means ceaseless movement.
Neither bright nor dim, it moves endlessly—its power to generate things defies naming.
Not a thing itself, it makes things—thus it constantly generates without ever possessing them.
Its wondrous root remains serene, so it is said to return to nothingness.
This is called the form of the formless, the image of the imageless—this is called *hūhuǎng*.
This is called the form of what has no form, the image of what has no substance—neither existent nor nonexistent, neither having nor lacking, difficult to name, so it is called *hūhuǎng*.
Meet it and you cannot see its beginning; follow it and you cannot see its end.
Without beginning, you cannot see its start when you meet it.
Without end, you cannot see its finish when you follow it.
Hold to the ancient Dao to steer the present’s being.
Hold to the ancient Dao of non-action to steer today’s affairs of action—thus returning to simplicity.
To know the ancient beginning is called the thread of the Dao.
To know the practices of the ancient beginning is called the guiding principle of the Dao’s transformation.

**Chapter Fifteen: The Virtuous Practitioner of Old**

The virtuous practitioners of old were subtle, wondrous, and profoundly penetrating, too deep to be known.
*Practitioner* means one who acts.
It speaks of those in ancient times who excelled in making the Dao their practice—none of the subtle words and wondrous Dao escaped their profound insight and illumination, yet their virtue and bearing were so deep they could not be known.
Only because they could not be known were descriptions forcibly applied.
Only because their virtue’s measure was hard to know were descriptions forcibly used to clarify it—referring to what follows.
Cautious, as if crossing a winter stream;
*Cautious* means composed and at ease.
The virtuous practitioner, in governing with the Dao, is like crossing a winter stream—ordinary people, clinging and attached, are fearful, but the practitioner, unstained, remains composed.
Hesitant, as if wary of neighbors on all sides;
*Hesitant* means doubtful and difficult.
Above, it says the virtuous practitioner is unstained and thus composed—yet observing their conduct, it is deeply doubtful and difficult, like one today wary of neighbors’ warnings.

Solemn as a guest,
Dispersing like ice about to melt.
Though solemn as a guest, with no deliberate action,
they do not congeal or cling to things,
dispersing like spring ice dissolving.

Simple as uncarved wood,
Though dispersing like melting ice,
they never boast of themselves,
yet remain sincere and thick,
like unhewn wood without distinction.

Vast as a valley,
Their virtue and capacity are boundlessly open,
containing nothing,
like an empty valley.

Turbid as muddy water,
Blending light and merging traces,
turbid yet clear.
Who can still the turbid to slowly clarify it?

Who?
Who can abide in this clarity long,
then seek superior methods,
moving in practice,
so that the nature of stillness does not stagnate in the method,
but gradually stirs and emerges?
*Emerges* means to stir and come forth.

Those who preserve this Way do not desire fullness.
To preserve this Way of gradual clarity and gradual emergence,
one must remain unattached.
If one clings to clarity and seeks emergence,
this is called fullness,
and the Way will be lost.
Thus it is said: do not desire fullness.

Only by not being full
can one remain worn yet not newly accomplished.
Only those who do not become full
can newly realize it,
acting with worn humility,
without clinging to their new attainment.

**Chapter Sixteen: Attaining the Utmost Void**

Attain the utmost void, guard stillness firmly.
The *utmost void* is the wondrous root.
All people receive life endowed with the wondrous root of the utmost void,
but when form takes in and holds things,
the wondrous root scatters.
Now, if one wishes the wondrous root of the utmost void to surely return to the self,
one must sever and abandon the stains of the dusty world,
guarding this feminine stillness with firm sincerity.
Then the Way of the utmost void will naturally return to the self.

The myriad things arise together,
and I observe their return.
The Old Master says: How do we know that guarding feminine stillness can attain the utmost void?
Simply observe the activities and movements of the myriad things—
when they return, they always rest in stillness.
Thus we know this.

The things flourish abundantly,
each returning to its root.
Again, it is said: How do we know the return of the myriad things always rests in stillness?
For the blossoms and leaves flourish abundantly,
yet their living nature all returns to its root.
Thus, when it speaks of "arising together,"
it refers to activity.
It says: When things actively arise,
in their return they all rest in the root.

Returning to the root is called stillness,
stillness is called returning to life.
When blossoms and leaves flourish,
their living nature returns to the root and becomes still.
One who returns to the root and attains stillness
can be said to restore their endowed nature and life.

Returning to life is called constancy,
knowing constancy is called illumination.
Guarding stillness and returning to life
can be called having constancy.
Knowing how to guard constancy
brings even greater clarity.

Not knowing constancy, reckless action brings misfortune.
Failing to maintain virtue,
or bearing shame by losing constancy and acting recklessly,
calamity will surely follow.

Knowing constancy brings capacity,
Knowing how to guard true constancy,
the mind and realm become empty and still,
like an empty valley,
containing all.

Capacity leads to impartiality,
Responding to things with capacity,
acting without self-interest,
being free from private bias,
one becomes impartial.

Impartiality leads to kingship,
One who is impartial and selfless
will be sought after by all things.

Kingship leads to heaven,
When the multitude joyfully submits,
like heaven’s covering,
one’s virtue merges with heaven.

Heaven leads to the Way,
With kingly virtue like heaven,
one can practice the Way.

The Way leads to enduring,
Practicing the Way throughout the world,
one can long enjoy blessings and prosperity.

To the end of one’s life, no danger.
Following heaven and practicing the Way,
one will remain free from peril to life’s end.

**Chapter Seventeen: The Highest**

The highest, below know they exist.
The *highest* refers to the rulers of a pristine age.
*Below know* means the ministers know their lord exists above,
revering him like heaven,
yet without traces of teaching or deliberate action.
Thus, people do not praise his virtue.

Next, they draw near and praise him.
As virtue declines,
the ruler enacts good teachings.
His benevolence is seen, so they draw near;
his merits are great, so they praise him.

Next, they fear and revile him.
As virtue declines further,
the ruler enacts many harmful policies.
The people cannot endure his commands,
so he drives them with punishments—
thus they fear him.
With concealed feelings and mutual deceit,
and his inability to discern clearly,
they revile him.

Trust is insufficient, so there is distrust.
Their fear and revilement
all arise from the ruler’s lack of trust,
which causes the people to become untrustworthy.

Yet they value his words.
Those who draw near and praise him
do so because the ruler’s virtuous teachings are spoken,
so they value his words and draw near to praise him.

When merits are accomplished and affairs completed,
the hundred clans say, "We are naturally so."
When merits are accomplished without attachment,
and affairs completed without deliberate action,
the hundred clans live their daily lives unaware,
saying, "We naturally became so."
This is what is meant by "the highest, below know they exist."

**Chapter Eighteen: The Decline of the Great Way**

When the great Way declines, there are benevolence and righteousness.
When purity scatters and simplicity dissolves,
the great Way is not practiced.
Then benevolence and righteousness,
small accomplishments,
arise in its place.
Kindness and favors arise from insufficiency;
decay and decline arise from deliberate action.
Yet the sage’s heart in saving the age has never differed—
only the traces of peace and peril cannot be the same.

When wisdom emerges, there is great deceit.
Those who employ wisdom
will establish laws.
When laws emerge, treachery arises—
then there is great deceit.
Stealing tallies and seals—
can this not be trusted as so?

When the six relations are not harmonious, there are filial piety and kindness.
Father and son, husband and wife, elder and younger brothers—
these are the six relations.
When kinship and affection lack order,
there is disharmony.
Each clings to their own kin and children—
thus there are filial piety and kindness.
All arise from losing the Way,
hence there are partial names.

When the state is benighted and chaotic, there are loyal ministers.
In times of great peace,
when above and below are mutually sufficient,
what need is there for such names?
In days of benighted chaos,
when one sees danger and dedicates one’s life,
there are loyal ministers.

**Chapter Nineteen: Abandoning Sagacity and Discarding Wisdom**

Abandon sagacity, discard wisdom,
and the people will benefit a hundredfold.

Abandon the traces of sagely teachings and transform through non-action.
Discard the use of common folk’s cunning and deceit, and people will return to simplicity and honesty.
In simplicity and honesty, artifice and falsehood do not arise;
in non-action, ostentation and partiality do not prevail.
People embrace the harmony of Heaven,
and things suffer no unnatural harm—
thus there is a hundredfold benefit.

Abandon benevolence, discard righteousness,
and the people will return to filial piety and kindness.
Abandon the benevolence of universal love,
discard the righteousness of judging right and wrong,
and people will revert to great filial piety and kindness.

Abandon skill, discard profit,
and thieves and bandits will cease to exist.
When people boast of partial skills,
they inevitably harbor a mind that contends for profit.
Thus, abandon skill and people will not contend;
discard profit and people will be self-sufficient.
Sufficient, they will not become thieves or bandits.

These three matters, deemed insufficient as mere teachings,
are therefore made to belong to something greater.
These three—merely instructing abandonment and discarding—
do not yet show the path of cultivation.
Thus, as teachings, they are deemed insufficient,
and are made to belong to what follows below.

Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity,
diminish self-interest, reduce desires.
See the true and plain,
embrace honesty and simplicity,
lessen private bias,
reduce covetous desires.

**Chapter Twenty: "Abandoning Learning Brings No Sorrow"**

Abandon learning, and there will be no sorrow.
Discard worldly learning and artificial doing, and simplicity will not scatter.
Lessen self-interest, reduce desires—thus there is no sorrow.

"Yea" and "ah," how far apart are they?
Good and evil, how distant are they?
"Yea" is a respectful response; "ah" is a careless one.
Both issue from the mouth—how far apart can they be?
Yet respectful response is good, careless response is evil.
This illustrates worldly learning:
Abandon it, and there is no sorrow; fail to abandon it, and trouble arises.
Is the difference truly so great? It lies only in the mind’s turning reflection.

What others fear, one must not fail to fear.
What ordinary people fear is carelessness and evil.
What the virtuous fear is worldly learning and artificial doing.
All should be abandoned—thus one must not fail to fear them.

How desolate! It has no end.
If one does not fear abandoning worldly learning, the true nature of beings will lie waste, with no end in sight.

The multitude bustle and rejoice,
as if feasting at a grand banquet,
as if ascending the spring terrace—
worldly learning and artificial doing lead them to chase after appearances,
as if approaching a lavish feast or gazing upon a spring pavilion,
ever stirring up greed and desire.

I alone remain still, without sign,
like an infant who has not yet learned to smile.
Vague and drifting, as if with no place to return.
The perfected person, free of intent, moves with things,
taking nothing, giving nothing—like a traveler with no destination.
*Chengcheng*: the appearance of movement.

The multitude all have more than enough;
they indulge in worldly affairs, boasting of their cunning and wisdom,
deeming themselves abundant, flaunting their brilliance.
Yet I alone seem to have lost something,
ever as if lacking, as if forgetting.

Is my heart that of a fool?
So pure and simple!
The worldly are bright and clear—
proud of their cleverness.
I alone seem dim—
concealing my light.
The worldly are sharp and discerning...

Establishing laws and systems—this is the way of regulation.
I alone remain dull and unassuming,
for I am only vast and magnanimous.
Sudden as dusk, serene as if without cessation—
my appearance shifts abruptly into obscurity,
yet my heart remains still, detached from worldly learning,
as if without attachment.

The multitude all have their *wherewithal*,
each possessing some means within the world,
pursuing external things and conventional learning.
I alone seem stubborn and coarse—
stubborn in lacking discrimination, coarse in being unrefined,
yet my heart is truly clear and awakened.
Outwardly, I appear deficient, hence the semblance.

I alone differ from others:
people are bound by passions and desires,
while I remain free from attachment.
People turn against the Dao;
I align with it.
Thus I hold dear the nourishment from the Mother,
like an infant seeking sustenance—free from craving.
As stated earlier, "like an infant who has not yet learned to smile,"
and later, "one of profound virtue is like a newborn child."
This is why I alone differ from others.

*(Note on textual variation: The original lacked "seek" and "from," now added for clarity. The sage, in expounding the scripture, originally had no need for such caution, but later teachings must account for ambiguity. The principle remains immutable, though phrasing may adapt for fluency. As Sima Qian noted, Laozi’s five thousand words elucidate the Dao through silence—word count is not fixed.)*

**Chapter 21: The Manifestation of Profound Virtue**

The manifestation of profound virtue follows only the Dao.
*Profound* signifies utmost; *follows* means to accord.
If one asks how one of utmost virtue appears,
the answer is: such a person’s conduct accords solely with the Dao of emptiness and extremity.

The Dao as a thing is only evanescent, only indistinct.
This describes the Dao followed by profound virtue—neither existent nor nonexistent, its function subtle and nameless, hence called *evanescent* and *indistinct*.
Indistinct, evanescent—within it are images.
*Indistinct* is nonexistence; *evanescent* is existence.
*Images* are the first signs of manifestation.
From nonexistence descending into existence, within it emerge the signs of all things.
Evanescent, indistinct—within it are things.
*Things* here refer to the Dao as a thing mentioned above.
From existence returning to nonexistence, it reverts to the Dao,
hence it is said that within it are things.
Abstruse, obscure—within it is essence.
Evanescent and indistinct, abstruse and unfathomable,
its creative and transformative function holds the most subtle essence.
Its essence is utterly real; within it is sincerity.
The essence of the abstruse is fundamentally unadulterated.
When things are moved, it responds without fail,
hence it is said to contain sincerity.
From ancient times to the present, its name has not departed,
for the Dao, from ancient times to the present,
has given rise to and nurtured the myriad things.
Things receive the Dao’s function and thus names are established.
Since its creative function remains unchanged from ancient times to now,
the names derived from its function have not departed.
Thereby it surveys the origins of the multitude.
*Surveys* means to measure; *origins* means beginnings.
The supreme Dao’s function measures the beginnings of all things,
each fulfilling its creative and transformative purpose.
How do I know the origins of the multitude are thus?
By this.
By this, all things receive the Dao’s wondrous function and are thus created.

**Chapter 22: Bending to Become Whole**

To bend is to become whole;
yielding to affairs ensures wholeness.
To submit is to become straight;
humbling oneself to elevate others ensures uprightness.
To be hollow is to become full;
embracing humility ensures constant fullness.
To be worn is to become new;
maintaining simplicity ensures daily renewal.
To have little is to gain;
holding fast to the One ensures no loss.
To have much is to be deluded.
Pursuing many paths leads to confusion.

Thus the sage holds to the One as the model for the world.
The sage embraces pure unity and thus serves as the world’s standard.
Not displaying oneself, one becomes illustrious;
one who does not display their virtue, constantly yielding to affairs,
finds their virtue naturally whole and luminous.
Not asserting oneself, one becomes distinguished;
one who does not insist on their own rightness,
but humbles themselves to elevate others,
finds their rightness naturally evident.
Not boasting, one achieves merit;
one who does not claim credit finds merit returning to them.
Not exalting oneself, one endures.
One who constantly maintains simplicity, without self-promotion,
finds others willingly acknowledging their excellence.
It is only because they do not contend
that no one in the world can contend with them.
Not contending with things, who can contend with them?
This means that in the world, whether worthy or unworthy,
none can contend with one who does not contend.

The ancient saying, "To bend is to become whole," is no empty phrase.
How could it be mere words?
Truly, one who bends will surely attain wholeness.

**Chapter 23: Sparse Words Accord with Nature**

Sparse words accord with nature.
*Sparse words* means forgetting words.
It is not called *forgetting words* but *sparse* because,
while words elucidate the Dao, they cannot be entirely abandoned.
When the Dao is realized, words are forgotten—hence *sparse*.
If one can use words to realize the Dao without clinging to them,
one aligns with nature.

Fierce winds do not last the morning;
torrential rains do not last the day.
Wind and rain that rage violently harm things,
just as clinging to teachings leads to losing the Dao and falling into delusion.
Who brings these about?
Heaven and Earth.
Even Heaven and Earth, vast as they are,
cannot sustain such violence without harming things—
how much less can humans?
Clinging to words and rigid teachings harms the Dao;
how can one hope to attain realization?

Thus those who devote themselves to the Dao
do not cling to words and teachings.
Those who embody the Dao align with the Dao;
those who realize the Dao forget words and thus align with it.
Those who embody virtue align with virtue;
*Virtue* is the name for the Dao’s function.
One who embodies the Dao forgets merit,
and their actions thus align with the Dao’s function.
Those who lose the way align with loss.
Clinging to words and rigid teachings prevents realization;
without realization, one strays from the Dao and aligns with loss.

Those who align with the Dao, the Dao also attains them.
Those who align with virtue, virtue also attains them.
Those who align with loss, loss also attains them.
As a mirror gathers water or a burning-mirror draws fire,
like classifying things by their kind—
the distinction is clear.
Where trust is insufficient, there is distrust.
Clinging to words and rigid teachings prevents realization—
this is what it means for trust to be insufficient.
Aligning with loss, loss delights in coming—
this is what it means for there to be distrust.

**Chapter 24: One Who Stands on Tiptoe Does Not Stand Firm**
One who stands on tiptoe does not stand firm;
one who strides does not walk.
*Tiptoeing* means rising on the heels to gaze.
*Striding* means forcing things with one’s legs.
This is like one who seeks clarity through self-display—
clarity is never attained.
How is this different from one who tiptoes to stand long
or strides to walk far?

Those who display themselves are not enlightened—
flaunting talent and exalting oneself,
acting only to reveal emptiness,
thus they are not enlightened.
Those who are self-righteous are not illustrious—
insisting on their own rightness and others’ wrongness,
they become a storehouse of resentment,
thus they are not illustrious.
Those who boast achieve no merit—
grasping and contending for gain,
things do not yield to them,
thus they achieve no merit.
Those who are self-conceited do not endure—
parading their abilities,
they are despised by others,
thus they do not endure.
In relation to the Dao, these are called
"leftover food and parasitic conduct."
Things naturally abhor them,
thus those who embody the Dao do not engage in them.

**Chapter 25: There Is a Thing Formed in Chaos**
There is a thing formed in chaos,
born before Heaven and Earth.
Seeking to clarify the origin of the Dao’s name,
it is called "a thing."
This thing is formed in undifferentiated wholeness,
encompassing all things.
Tracing its generation and transformation,
it existed before Heaven and Earth.
Silent and empty, it stands alone and does not change;
it circulates without end and does not falter—
it can be called the Mother of all under Heaven.
Its essence is silent and empty,
profoundly still and serene,
thus it stands alone and does not change.
Its function pervades all things,
thus it circulates without peril.
All things rely on it for generation,
nourished by its abundant virtue—
thus it can be called the Mother of all under Heaven.
I do not know its name;
I style it "Dao,"
and by force call it "Great."
Great means it flows away;
flowing away means it reaches afar;
reaching afar means it returns.
Thus the Dao is great, Heaven is great,
Earth is great, and the king is also great.
Among these four great things in the world,
the king occupies one.
The king, as the spirit-lord of humanity,
holds the rise and fall of all things in his hands.
To emphasize this warning,
it is said the king occupies one,
urging him to model himself on what follows:
Man models himself on Earth,
Earth models itself on Heaven,
Heaven models itself on the Dao,
and the Dao models itself on spontaneity.

**Chapter 26: Weight Is the Root of Lightness**
Weight is the root of lightness;
stillness is the lord of restlessness.
Weight restrains lightness,
thus it is the root.
Stillness governs restlessness,
thus it is the lord.
Therefore the noble person travels all day
without leaving the heavy baggage.
*Baggage* refers to the cart;
*heavy* refers to what it carries.
Those who value lightness and restlessness
are like travelers who guard their baggage—
lose the baggage and they suffer cold and hunger;
indulge in lightness and restlessness and they invite disaster.
Though there are splendid sights,
they dwell in them with serene detachment.
The ruler, holding to weight and stillness,
though surrounded by splendor,
must remain calmly composed,
transcending all attachment.
How could a lord of ten thousand chariots
treat his person lightly in ruling the world?
*How could* is an expression of lament.
The world is the precious throne—
how could a ruler indulge his desires,
using his person lightly,
and thus lose his position?
Lightness loses ministers;
restlessness loses the ruler.
If the ruler is frivolous, people scatter—
thus he loses his ministers.
If ministers are restless, the ruler is disdained—
thus they lose their ruler.

**Chapter 27: Skillful Travel Leaves No Tracks**

In the midst of all dharmas, one fathoms the true nature, moving without the appearance of movement—thus it is called "skillful travel." In this way, the mind merges with the Dao, leaving no tracks to seek. "Skillful speech leaves no flaw or blame," for one who understands the teachings does not cling to them, dispelling form to grasp meaning, realizing principle and forgetting words—thus no blemish or fault arises within the teachings. "Skillful reckoning requires no counting," for one who comprehends that all dharmas fundamentally share a single gate, threading them through with unity, gives rise to no other views. Without the labor of calculation, clarity arises of itself—how could this not be called "skillful"? "Skillful closure needs no bolt yet cannot be opened," for one who forgets both words and deeds does not enter heterodox paths. The mind harbors no delusion of boundaries, and the world bears no burden of arising thoughts—though no bolt is set, how could it be opened? "Skillful binding needs no cord yet cannot be undone," for one who fathoms true nature, originally empty and forgotten, if able to be empty and forgotten, then the mind merges with the Dao. Though no cord binds, how could it be untied and scattered?

Thus the sage constantly excels in saving people, and so there are no outcasts. Constantly excels in saving things, and so nothing is discarded. Therefore, the sage constantly employs these five kinds of skillful teaching to instruct, and so there is nothing abandoned. This is called "inheriting illumination." "Inheriting" means subtle application; the five kinds of skillful practice lie in forgetting and relinquishing. When forgotten and relinquished, no traces remain—thus it is called "subtle application." Subtle application leads to awakening—thus it is called "illumination."

Therefore, the good person is the teacher of the not-good, and the not-good person is the resource of the good. "Teacher" means model; "resource" means to take and employ. The good person can be modeled after; the not-good person can be taken and employed. If one does not value the teacher, does not cherish the resource—this chapter’s profound meaning teaches the forgetting of both. If teacher and resource remain, the ultimate is not yet reached. Now, the reason for valuing the teacher is the presence of the appearance of learning; when the appearance of learning is empty, naturally nothing is valued. The reason for cherishing the resource is the presence of the appearance of teaching; when teaching is forgotten within teaching, thus one does not cherish the resource. When both valuing and cherishing vanish from the mind, the Dao transforms of itself. Though the wise may seem greatly deluded, this is called the essential and wondrous. The forgetting of both teacher and resource is called the mysterious power. The common people do not awaken, deeming it great delusion—thus the sage says: though knowing the common people deem it great delusion, from the perspective of the Dao, it is the essential and wondrous.

**Chapter 28: Knowing the Male, Guarding the Female**
Know the male, guard the female, and be the world’s valley. As the world’s valley, constant virtue does not depart, returning to the state of infancy. The male suffers from acting as the yang—thus, knowing the male, one should guard the female. With humility, all things return—this is to be the world’s valley. Then the true and constant virtue does not leave the body, embracing the Dao and containing harmony, returning to the conduct of infancy.

Know the white, guard the black, and be the world’s model. As the world’s model, constant virtue does not err, returning to the boundless. Able to guard the female and stillness, constant virtue does not depart. Though virtue is bright and clear, one should remain as if obscure and dark—thus becoming the world’s model. Constant virtue responds without flaw, its function inexhaustible—thus returning to the boundless. "Err" means deviation.

Know glory, guard disgrace, and be the world’s valley. As the world’s valley, constant virtue is fulfilled, returning to simplicity. Though virtue is noble and glorious, one constantly guards lowliness and disgrace. Things respond when moved, like an echo in a valley, empty and receptive without end. Constant virtue is perfectly complete—thus returning to the Dao. "Simplicity" is the Dao.

When simplicity scatters, it becomes vessels; when the sage employs it, it becomes the chief of officials. When inner power is inwardly fused, one returns to simplicity. When constant virtue is applied, it scatters and becomes vessels. Once it enters form and vessels, there must be refinement and coarseness. When the sage employs it, it becomes the chief of the multitude of villages. Thus great governance does not sever. When the sage employs the Dao to govern the multitude of beings, it is like spring’s warmth, bestowing blessings without end. All things, moving and still, flourish—never severing or harming.

**Chapter 29: One Who Would Take the World**
One who would take the world and act upon it—I see that they will not succeed. The world is the precious throne of great treasure; the one who embodies the Dao must await the mandate resting upon them. If a violent and disorderly person seeks to take it by force and become its ruler, the Old Master warns: I see that they will not succeed. The world is a divine vessel—it cannot be acted upon. Those who act upon it will fail; those who grasp it will lose it. The precious throne is the vessel of heaven, earth, and the divine spirits—thus it is called the divine vessel. It cannot be forcibly acted upon. Therefore, it is said: those who act upon it will fail—this is a warning to treacherous and rebellious ministers. Those who grasp it will lose it. When the mandate rests upon one who has already attained the lord’s position, yet they seek to grasp and possess it, oppressing and violating the divine lord, the way of heaven will bring calamity upon excess—thus they too will lose it. This is a warning to emperors and kings.

Thus things may lead or follow, warm or blow, strengthen or weaken, uphold or destroy. This illustrates that acting leads to failure and grasping leads to loss. Thus things may lead ahead or follow behind, warm to make hot or blow to make cold, support to strengthen or suppress to weaken, uphold with virtue or destroy through lack of power. Therefore, the sage abandons excess, extravagance, and extreme indulgence. The sage, observing how things lead or follow, knows that those who grasp will surely lose—thus they abandon what is excessive.

**Chapter 30: Using the Dao to Assist the Lord of Men**
One who uses the Dao to assist the lord of men does not rely on arms to overpower the world—such affairs readily rebound. A minister who can use the Dao to assist the lord of men should submit with virtue, not employing the might of arms to seek dominance over the world. Why? Arms are instruments of misfortune; war is a perilous affair. When one raises arms and deploys troops, the other side must respond—such affairs readily rebound in retribution. Thus the outcome of victory or defeat cannot be measured.

Where armies encamp, brambles and thorns arise. In the wake of great hosts, lean years must follow. Where troops are stationed, war disrupts the plow; when farming is neglected, brambles and thorns take root. The baleful qi of war brings harm, and drought or flood follows in its train—agriculture abandoned first, calamity close behind, ensuring years of famine and hardship.

Thus the adept acts with resolve alone, never daring to seek dominance through force. Resolute yet not boastful, resolute yet not vaunting, resolute yet not arrogant—the skillful counselor acts resolutely only to halt the foe. For their aim lies in pacifying the people and harmonizing the multitude, never in pursuing victory or supremacy. Though resolute in stopping the enemy, they do not make of them a foe. Beware of vaunting deeds, claiming triumph, or swelling with pride—pride invites ruin, and thus is deeply warned against.

Resolute action is a last resort, resolute yet not aggressive. When the enemy invades and cannot be repelled, then arms are used to halt them. Such resolve lies in responding to the foe, not in seeking dominance through force. All things, when they reach their peak, begin to decline—this is called acting contrary to the Dao, and what is contrary to the Dao meets an early end. The use of force reaches its peak in reliance on strength; when things reach their peak, they weaken, and when arms grow strong, they meet defeat. This is called discord with the Dao, and one must cease such actions early.

**Chapter 31: On Fine Arms**
Fine arms are instruments of ill omen; all things may come to abhor them, and thus those who embody the Dao do not dwell in them. "Fine" means "excellent." "Arms" refers to strategy. When people cultivate eloquence and establish sincerity, they cannot conceal their instruments through virtue and power but instead esteem military strategy and cunning as excellence. The use of strategy lies solely in attack, conquest, and slaughter—thus it is an instrument of ill omen. Even things naturally abhor it, and so those who embody the Dao do not place themselves in such a position.

The noble person values the left in peace, the right in war. The left is yang; yang’s harmony brings forth life, and thus it is valued in times of peace. The right is yin; yin’s condensation brings severity and killing, and thus it is valued in war. Arms are instruments of ill omen—for "omen" means "good." Those who esteem arms exalt killing, and thus they are instruments of ill omen, not the instruments of the noble person. The noble person takes virtue and power as their instruments, not valuing military strategy. When there is no choice but to employ them, equanimity is paramount. When barbarians invade within, there is no choice. To triumph without contention—this is the highest equanimity.

Victory is not to be glorified. To glorify it is to delight in killing. Those who delight in killing cannot realize their ambitions in the world. Triumph over the enemy must be met with sorrow for the fallen, and thus it is not glorified. Victory inevitably entails much killing; if one takes victory as glorious, they delight in mass killing. Those who delight in mass killing will find no one rallying to them—how then can they hope to realize their ambitions?

Auspicious affairs value the left; inauspicious affairs value the right. The deputy general stands to the left, the supreme general to the right. The deputy general, being of lower rank, stands to the left, for they do not preside over killing. The supreme general, being of higher rank, stands to the right, for they direct military strategy. This is to treat them with the rites of mourning. Mourning rites value the right, and thus the supreme general, standing to the right, is placed as though in mourning. When many are killed, one weeps in sorrow and lamentation—for the preciousness of living beings, and the pity of their slaughter in war, evoking a heart of compassion and grief.

When triumph is won, it is treated with the rites of mourning. Though warriors are valiant and emerge victorious in battle, receiving ranks and standing to the right, the right is not auspicious—thus it is treated with the rites of mourning. But as arms are instruments of ill omen, why must one don mourning garb as though in mourning?

**Chapter 32: The Dao Constantly Nameless**
The Dao is constantly nameless. The Dao’s constancy lies in its responsiveness; ever able to respond to things, its responses are not uniform, and thus in its constancy, it is nameless. Though the uncarved block is small, none in the world dare treat it as a subject. The uncarved block is the wondrous root, refined and unified—thus it is called small. Yet when its craftsmanship is perfected, it becomes vast, and thus none dare make the Dao their subject.

If lords and kings can hold to it, the myriad things will naturally submit. If lords and kings can hold to the Dao’s refinement and unity, governing through non-action, then the myriad things will naturally submit. Heaven and earth unite to send down sweet dew, and none command it to be evenly distributed. If lords and kings can embrace and hold to refinement and unity, the earth will be level and heaven complete, their harmony bringing forth sweet dew. Once sweet dew descends, orchids and thoroughwort alike are nourished, and without need for decrees, all is naturally balanced. This is the analogy for lords and kings—weighing things to govern with even-handedness.

When the beginning of order is established, names arise; once names exist, one must also know when to stop. Knowing when to stop is how one avoids peril. If lords and kings can order things with names, then those named things will also know to submit to them. Knowing to submit to a lord who embodies the Dao is how one avoids danger. The Dao’s presence in the world is like valleys flowing into rivers and seas. Heaven sends down sweet dew as an auspicious sign of the Dao, and thus the analogy of the lord who embodies the Dao, governing the world with non-action, to which heaven responds like valleys flowing into rivers and seas.

**Chapter 33: Knowing Others Is Wisdom**
To know others is wisdom; to know oneself is clarity. Wisdom employs knowledge to understand things, while clarity fuses illumination to discern the subtle. Wisdom may yet have its limits, but clarity leaves nothing unilluminated. To triumph over others is to possess strength; to triumph over oneself is to be strong. To overcome others may be called strength, but to overcome one’s own heart and embrace softness is to preserve true strength.

To know contentment is to be rich; to act with perseverance is to have resolve. One who knows where to stop is free from greed and may be called rich.

One who acts with perseverance and unyielding effort may be said to possess noble resolve. To remain where one belongs is to endure; knowing contentment and acting with perseverance, never straying from one’s proper place—this is to abide long in the Way. One who dies yet does not perish enjoys true longevity. Death marks the end of one’s allotted principle; perishing is an untimely demise. Longevity is the fulfillment of one’s destined span. Those who know others and triumph over them invite misfortune, while those who know contentment and act with perseverance move in accord with heaven’s constancy. One who attains heaven’s constancy dies yet does not perish—this is the fulfillment of one’s destined span and may be called true longevity.

**Chapter 34: The Dao Pervades All**
The great Dao flows everywhere, extending left and right. The great Dao, unbound and responsive, pervades all without partiality. The ten thousand things depend on it for life, yet it does not refuse; its work is complete, yet it does not claim possession. It nurtures and sustains the ten thousand things yet does not act as their master—ever without desire, it may be called small. Yet in loving and nourishing the ten thousand things without dominating them, it may be called great. Neither small nor great, it defies naming. Thus the sage never insists on greatness and thereby achieves true greatness.

**Chapter 35: Embracing the Great Image**
Embrace the great image, and all under heaven will come to you. The great image is the great Dao. When the ruler holds fast to the Dao to govern all under heaven, the ten thousand things will naturally turn toward him. Coming without harm, they rest in perfect peace. Music and feasting may make passing travelers pause, but when the ruler upholds the Dao to bring about peace, the ten thousand things will likewise gather. Another interpretation: music gathers by sound, feasting by flavor—passing travelers may linger briefly, but not for long. Thus a thatched hut cannot be dwelled in forever; benevolence and righteousness, once imposed, bring endless demands. Therefore, when the ruler embodies the Dao in stillness, flavorless and serene, he first removes oppressive governance and ultimately transforms the people into simplicity. Hence the text concludes: its use is inexhaustible.

The Dao, when spoken, is bland and without flavor. When the ruler teaches with the Dao’s purity, his words, though seemingly flavorless, differ from worldly instruction, which relies on praise, fear, or shame. Look for it and it cannot be seen; listen for it and it cannot be heard—yet its use is inexhaustible. In governing with the Dao, no words are needed, so it cannot be seen or heard, yet its transformative influence spreads, the ten thousand things flourish, and the harvest overflows—its use is indeed inexhaustible.

**Chapter 36: Subtle Illumination**
To contract something, first expand it; to weaken something, first strengthen it; to abolish something, first exalt it; to take something, first give it—this is called subtle illumination. The scripture says, “Straight words seem reversed,” and the *Book of Changes* states, “Compliance is the means to exercise judgment.” Judgment is the reversal of norms to accord with principle. Thus the noble person values judgment that aligns with principle, while the petty person uses it for deceit. Confucius said, “One may stand with such a person, but not entrust them with judgment.” How true! In the previous chapter, Laozi spoke of embracing the great image—this is the substance. Here, he follows with expansion and contraction—this is the exercise of judgment. To gauge the roots of sentient beings, he employs both substance and judgment in alternation, guiding them toward the realm of nature and destiny. Yet the deluded claim this is not the intent of the Dao and virtue—how deeply they err and fail to awaken!

Thus, to restrain the desires of sentient beings, one must first indulge their extravagance, allowing them to entangle themselves in craving—then contraction becomes possible. The principles of strengthening and weakening, abolishing and exalting, taking and giving follow the same pattern.

This Dao is most subtle, yet its effects are manifestly evident—thus it is called "subtle clarity." *"The soft and weak overcome the hard and strong."* Yielding compliance allows the exercise of judgment; when judgment is exercised, one can master all things. Thus we know that the soft and weak must prevail over the hard and strong.

*"Fish must not leave the depths; the state’s sharp instruments must not be shown to others."* To "leave" is to lose. The "sharp instruments" are the arts of judgment. This means the arts of judgment must not be revealed to those unfit for them. Hence the analogy: if fish leave the depths, they will be seized by men; if the arts of judgment are shown to the unfit, they will be stolen and used for deceit.

**Chapter 37**
*"The Dao is ever without action, yet nothing is left undone."*
The wondrous root is quiescent, hence it is ever without action. Yet all things rely upon it to live—thus nothing is left undone. If lords and kings can abide by the Dao and act without action, the myriad things will transform of themselves. The ruler’s non-action brings about simplicity and purity. *"Should transformation give rise to desire, I shall press it down with the nameless uncarved block."* When people, having followed the ruler’s transformation, have already attained non-action and purity, yet still seek to stir and act, I shall press them down with the nameless uncarved block. The "nameless uncarved block" is the Dao. *"The nameless uncarved block will also be without desire. Without desire, through quiescence, the world will right itself."* When the ruler has already used the nameless uncarved block to pacify the people, he must not cling to this nameless uncarved block and leave traces, lest in following traces he lose the root and fall back into action. Thus, even this nameless uncarved block must be forgotten. Without desire, even the absence of desire vanishes. In profound purity, the world rights itself.

**Virtue Classic, Part One**
**Chapter 38: "The Highest Virtue Does Not Act as Virtue"**

**Chapter 38: "The Highest Virtue Does Not Act as Virtue"**

The highest virtue does not act as virtue—thus it possesses virtue.
The lesser virtue does not lose virtue—thus it lacks virtue.
Virtue is the function of the Dao. *Zhuangzi* said: "That by which things obtain life is called virtue." As times vary between purity and turbidity, so virtue has its higher and lower forms.

In high antiquity, when simplicity and purity prevailed, the function of virtue was not manifest—no virtue could be named, hence it is said "does not act as virtue." Yet its unadulterated power remained undispersed, and the transformation of non-action was clear, hence it is said "thus it possesses virtue." As virtue declined in later ages, its functions gradually became apparent. Though the mind embodied the Dao, its traces involved action. Clinging to virtue made it nameable, hence it is said "does not lose virtue." Yet its traces, marked by self-importance, were coarser than the highest, hence it is said "thus it lacks virtue."

The highest virtue acts without acting, and thus has no act.
To know non-action and then act without acting is not the ultimate.
To act without acting through no deliberate act—that is the ultimate.
Thus, the non-action of the highest virtue is not a pursuit of the beauty of non-action, but rather the natural expression of uncarved simplicity. It is non-action in both mind and trace, hence it is said "and thus has no act."

The lesser virtue acts, and thus has an act.
The lesser virtue acts, for though its mind is without action, its functions become manifest, and its traces involve action, hence it is said "acts." This means the lesser virtue acts without acting yet has a reason for acting—its mind is without action, but its traces are with action.

The highest benevolence acts, yet has no act.
Benevolence is the name for universal love. When the lesser virtue declined, the highest benevolence appeared, hence it is said "acts." Practicing benevolence while forgetting benevolence is also a pursuit of non-action, hence it is said "yet has no act." Here, the mind acts, but the traces do not—this is not to be confused with the lesser virtue’s action.

The highest righteousness acts, and thus has an act.
Righteousness is the principle of correcting wrongs. To act by correcting wrongs is called "acting." Having a means to correct and judge, ensuring propriety, hence it is said "and thus has an act"—both mind and trace are with action.

The highest propriety acts, yet none respond, so one rolls up sleeves and forces compliance.
When the six relations are disharmonious, propriety is employed to remedy it, hence it is said "acts." Propriety values reciprocity; failure to respond is improper. When one practices propriety toward another and receives no response, one rolls up sleeves in anger and compels compliance.

Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue follows; when virtue is lost, benevolence follows; when benevolence is lost, righteousness follows; when righteousness is lost, propriety follows.
Losing the Dao means losing the highest virtue, for the highest virtue aligns with the Dao, hence it is called "losing the Dao." Dao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, and propriety are names for the customs of times, whether level or perilous. Thus, when the Dao declines, virtue appears; when virtue declines, benevolence remains; when benevolence perishes, righteousness is established; when righteousness is lost, propriety is employed—all are but timely expedients.

To discuss propriety in an age of simplicity is either madness or folly; to forget propriety in an age of decadence is either foolishness or perversity. If one can comprehend and reform, one should withdraw propriety and practice righteousness, withdraw righteousness and practice benevolence, withdraw benevolence and practice virtue, forget virtue and align with the Dao. When people return to simplicity, this is the non-action of the highest virtue.

Propriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust, and the beginning of chaos.
Those who established propriety did so because loyalty and trust had thinned, and propriety was made the first remedy for chaos. The purpose of propriety is to pacify superiors and govern the people—how could it be merely about jade and silk?

"Foreknowledge" is the flower of the Dao and the beginning of folly.
"Foreknowledge" refers to human discernment. To establish these external checks before innate discernment, though intending to respond to the times, is to truly lose simplicity, hence it is called "the flower of the Dao." Propriety is meant to remedy chaos, valuing harmony above all. Yet those who miss its intent will boast of their jade and silk, prize their bowing and kneeling—such people are the beginning of folly.

Thus, the great man dwells in the substantial, not the insubstantial; abides in the real, not the flowery.
Action is the insubstantial of the Dao; propriety and righteousness are the flowery of virtue. Thus, the sage dwells in the affairs of non-action—this is the substantial—and does not dwell in the insubstantial. By withdrawing from the practice of propriety and righteousness, one abides in the real. Thus, one rejects that and embraces this.

Reject the flowery and insubstantial; embrace the substantial and real.

**Chapter 39: "Of Old, Those Who Obtained the One"**

"The One is the harmony of the Dao, referring to the primordial qi. Because its wondrous function unifies all things, it is called the One. Heaven obtains the One and becomes clear; earth obtains the One and becomes tranquil; spirits obtain the One and become numinous; valleys obtain the One and become full; the myriad things obtain the One and come to life; lords and kings obtain the One and become the standard for all under heaven—this is how they attain it. When things receive the function of the Dao, names are established according to their use. When the Dao is present, names stand; when its function is lost, reality perishes. Thus, heaven’s clarity, earth’s tranquility, spirits’ numinosity, and valleys’ fullness all rely on this wondrous function to attain their state—hence it is said, 'this is how they attain it.'

If heaven had nothing to make it clear, it would fear splitting; if earth had nothing to make it tranquil, it would fear erupting; if spirits had nothing to make them numinous, they would fear fading; if valleys had nothing to make them full, they would fear drying up; if the myriad things had nothing to make them live, they would fear perishing; if lords and kings had nothing to make them noble and exalted, they would fear collapse.

Those who obtain the One must not boast of its function. Thus, the warning states: If heaven boasts of its clarity, it will fear division; if earth boasts of its tranquility, it will fear dissipation; if spirits boast, their numinosity will fade; if valleys boast, their fullness will dry up; if things boast, their life will perish; if lords and kings boast of their nobility, they will face downfall.

The sagely teachings endure through the ages for the sake of living beings. Though they broadly encompass the clarity of heaven and the tranquility of earth, their convergence lies solely in lords and kings maintaining femininity and employing the Dao. Thus, the following text states:

Therefore, the noble takes the humble as its root, the high takes the low as its foundation. Lords and kings are noble and exalted, while the common people are humble and lowly. Those who govern a state take the people as their root and foundation. They should labor humbly to gather them, ensuring they delight in the joyful harmony of transformation, without scattering or separation.

Thus, lords and kings call themselves 'the orphaned, the widowed, the unworthy.' Is this not taking the humble as their root? The terms 'orphaned, widowed, unworthy' are what ordinary sentiments despise—yet lords and kings adopt them as their titles, taking humility as their root. Is this not so? This makes it clear that they take the humble as their root.

Hence, counting carriages results in no carriages. If you count the carriages, there will be no carriages. The wheels and shafts are the root of the carriage; if you count nobility, there will be no nobility. The humble is the root of the noble. The shafts are the root of the carriage—one must preserve the shafts to stabilize the carriage. The humble is the root of the noble—one must uphold the humble to secure the noble. This admonishes lords and kings to take the humble as their root, hence the analogy of counting carriages.

One should not desire to be lustrous like jade nor scattered like stone. Lustrous describes jade’s appearance; scattered, stone’s appearance. This is taking the humble as the root.

**Chapter 40: "Reversion Is the Movement of the Dao"**
Reversion is the movement of the Dao—
This clarifies expediency. Reversion means returning to the constant to align with principle. Aligning with principle through reversion is the sage’s exercise of expediency. Exercising expediency is the movement of the Dao—hence it is said, 'Reversion is the movement of the Dao.'
Weakness is the function of the Dao—
This clarifies the real."

Weakness embraces softness, gentleness, and the stillness of the feminine—
Softness, gentleness, and the stillness of the feminine are how the sage abides in reality. Abiding in reality is the constant function of the Dao—hence it is said, 'Weakness is the function of the Dao.'

All things under heaven are born of being; being is born of non-being.
Reality in relation to expediency is like non-being giving rise to being. Thus, those who exercise expediency value returning to the function of reality. Being necessarily relies upon non-being. Yet the ultimate Dao is empty and quiescent, free from all designations. The nature of all dharmas is emptiness; they do not depend upon one another. If one can forget both expediency and reality, extinguish both being and non-being, and reduce carriages to no-carriage, this may be called transcendence.

**Chapter 41: "When the Highest Virtue Hears of the Dao"**
When the highest virtue hears of the Dao, they diligently practice it—
Having awakened, they diligently practice.
When the middling virtue hears of the Dao, they waver between belief and doubt—
The middling may ascend or descend, hence they doubt. Doubt makes them waver between belief and doubt.
When the lowest virtue hears of the Dao, they laugh loudly—
Deluded and disbelieving, they laugh. If they did not laugh, it would not suffice as the Dao—
If not mocked by the lowest, it would not suffice as the profound and wondrous Dao.

The established sayings declare:
Established means to set forth. This sets forth the differing responses of the three virtues to the Dao.
The bright Dao seems dim; advancing in the Dao seems like retreating; the level Dao seems uneven—
The highest virtue acts, yet in brightness seems dim, in advancement seems to retreat, in smoothness seems uneven—hence the middling doubt and the lowest laugh loudly.
The highest virtue resembles a valley—
Empty and receptive, it contains all things.
The purest white seems sullied—
Flawless yet embracing impurity.
The most expansive virtue seems insufficient—
Perfect yet holding to humility.
Established virtue seems indolent—
Accomplishing without ostentation.
Unalloyed truth seems tarnished—
Pure and harmonious, it blends with light.
The great square has no corners—
It does not insist on petty edges.
The great vessel is slow to complete—
It does not seek quick results.
The great sound is scarcely heard—
It does not adorn itself with petty words.
The great image has no form—
Thus it can respond to all things.
The Dao is hidden, without name—
Its function unmanifest, nameless.
Yet only the Dao is good at bestowing and completing—
Though hidden and nameless, it is truly good, with its wondrous function of the harmonious and subtle bestowing upon and ripening all things.

**Chapter 42: "The Dao Gives Birth to One"**
The Dao gives birth to one; one gives birth to two; two gives birth to three—
One is the harmonious qi. The Dao moves and emits the wondrous harmonious qi, yet this is insufficient for the principle of generating things, so it gives birth to yang qi. Yang qi cannot generate alone, so it gives birth to yin qi. Accumulating the one of harmonious qi, it is said, 'one gives birth to two.' Accumulating the two of yang qi, it is said, 'two gives birth to three.'
Three gives birth to the myriad things—
Yin and yang conceive, the harmonious qi regulates and harmonizes, then the myriad things flourish and complete—hence it is said, 'three gives birth to the myriad things.'
The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, with harmonious qi as their harmony—
The myriad things, by virtue of being born of yin, yang, and harmonious qi, thus bear yin and embrace yang, nurturing the harmonious qi to maintain their suppleness.
What people despise are only orphanhood, loneliness, and unripeness, yet kings and lords take these as their titles—
All things take harmonious qi as their root. Those who guard the root with harmony and suppleness must be humble and gentle. Thus, though kings and lords are most exalted, they take orphanhood, loneliness, and unripeness as their titles, for they take humility and gentleness as their root.
Thus, things may be diminished yet increased, or increased yet diminished—
Those who diminish themselves are increased by others. Those who increase themselves are diminished by others.
What others teach, I also teach—
The Old Master says: What rulers wish to establish as teachings for others, they should teach using this principle of gentleness and humility.
The strong and overbearing do not meet their proper end—
The strong and overbearing act in opposition to things, seeking increase yet meeting diminution. Others may restrain them, so they do not meet their proper end.
I shall take this as the father of all teachings—
I see that the strong and overbearing perish, while the gentle and weak endure. Thus, I take the teaching of gentleness and weakness as the father of all teachings.

**Chapter 43: "The Softest Under Heaven"**
The softest under heaven gallops through the hardest under heaven—
The softest under heaven is the true nature. If one gallops through worldly affairs, entangled in defiled realms, with passions and desires filling and obstructing, this becomes the hardest under heaven.
That which has no being enters where there is no gap; through this I know the benefit of non-action—
That which has no being is not defiled by worldly realms, leaving the mind utterly without anything. That which has no gap is the pure nature of the Dao, its wondrous essence perfectly blended, without the slightest fissure. If one is not disturbed by desires, leaving both mind and realm quiescent, utterly without anything, then mind and Dao unite, entering where there is no gap. Thus, the sage says: I see that when body and mind are pure, they can unite with the Dao. I know that the teachings of action are not as beneficial as the benefits of non-action.
The teaching without words, the benefits of non-action—few under heaven attain them—
Few among the world’s teachings can equal them.

**Chapter 44: "Fame or Self—Which Is Closer?"**
Fame or self—which is closer?
Fame is the guest of reality. The world pursues fame to the point of losing the self. This question asks which is closer, intending to make one abandon merit and fame to preserve one’s true nature.
Self or possessions—which is more?
Those who pursue fame will seek wealth. Wealth is gained yet the self is lost. This question asks which is more, intending to make one cast aside jade and shatter pearls to preserve harmony.
Gain or loss—which is harmful?
This asks whether gaining fame and possessions or losing them harms the self.
Thus, excessive attachment must lead to great expenditure; hoarding much must lead to heavy loss—
Excessive attachment to fame wearies the spirit—is this not great expenditure? Hoarding much wealth burdens the body—is this not heavy loss?
Knowing contentment avoids disgrace; knowing when to stop avoids danger—this can endure long—
Knowing contentment is not excessive attachment. Knowing when to stop is not hoarding much. Without disgrace or danger, one can endure long.

**Chapter 45: "Great Perfection Seems Lacking"**
Great perfection seems lacking, yet its function is inexhaustible—

In learning, when one attains great accomplishment, it often seems flawed or incomplete—yet humility brings benefit, so one’s talents and utility never face exhaustion or decay.

Great fullness seems empty, yet its use is inexhaustible.
When emolument and rank are full, they should always seem empty and modest—frugality does not harm resources, so what is used never becomes depleted.

Great straightness seems bent,
for straightness without excess appears bent.
Great skill seems clumsy,
for skill that does not exceed its proper bounds appears clumsy.
Great eloquence seems inarticulate,
for it does not adorn petty speech and thus seems inarticulate.

Restlessness overcomes cold; stillness overcomes heat—
purity and tranquility become the norm of the world.
In restlessness, one overcomes cold—cold is thinness.
In stillness, one overcomes heat—heat is harmony.
Thus, what seems bent is great straightness, and purity and tranquility become the norm.
For when the world follows the Dao, warhorses are retired to fertilize the fields.
When a ruler embodies the Dao, governance flows without effort—free from greed, there is no warfare, and the use of warhorses is set aside so that people may tend their fields.

When the world lacks the Dao, warhorses breed even in the outskirts.
When a ruler abandons the Dao, driven by desire to conquer, soldiers and steeds take root in the borderlands.

No crime is greater than indulging desire—
when the heart fixates on what it covets, the crime is greatest.
No disaster is greater than discontent—
endless seeking brings the greatest calamity.
No fault is greater than the desire to possess—
the greatest misfortune lies in desire; if all desires must be fulfilled, the deeper the disaster, hence it is called fault.

Thus, the contentment of true sufficiency is always sufficient.
Those who find sufficiency in things do not know true sufficiency—
only those whose hearts are content know sufficiency.
When the heart knows contentment, this sufficiency endures.

Without stepping beyond the door, one knows the world.
Without peering through the window, one sees the Dao of Heaven.
In effortless governance, without issuing commands beyond the door, one understands the way to order the world—when human affairs harmonize, celestial patterns align, so one need not trouble to peer through the window to know the Dao of Heaven.

The farther one goes, the less one knows.
If one cannot practice non-action, even if commands extend far, one’s understanding of ordering the world diminishes.

Thus, the sage knows without traveling,
for without stepping beyond the door, one remains unmoving—embodying simplicity and non-action, one knows the way of governance.
Sees without looking,
for without peering through the window, one does not gaze—when people harmonize and Heaven aligns, one can name the state of great peace.
Achieves without acting,
for without issuing commands, the world transforms of itself.

In the pursuit of learning, each day brings accumulation; in the pursuit of the Dao, each day brings reduction.
Those who pursue learning daily accumulate knowledge and experience.
Those who pursue the Dao daily reduce their attachments and actions.
Accumulating knowledge is the beginning of cultivation; reducing attachments is the gateway to awakening—thus, one builds merit through accumulation, then forgets merit to embody the Dao.

Reduce and reduce again, until one reaches non-action—
then there is nothing that is not done.
Those who pursue learning accumulate merit and action; those who pursue the Dao reduce them—yet even in reduction, the desire to reduce remains. When this desire is also forgotten, one attains serene non-action.
Like a mirror reflecting all images without discrimination, nothing is left undone.

To take hold of the world, one always does so through non-action.
Through non-action and non-interference, the world returns to harmony, so one may take hold of it.
When one resorts to action, it is insufficient to take hold of the world.
Action brings toil and exhaustion, and exhaustion leads to decline—thus, it is insufficient to take hold of the world.

The sage has no fixed heart but takes the hearts of the people as their own.
The sage’s heart responds to things as they arise, adapting to each encounter—thus, it has no fixed nature.
Though the heart has no fixed form, it always aims to transform for the good, consistently taking the hearts of the people as its own.

The good, I treat with goodness; the not-good, I also treat with goodness—thus virtue is goodness.
The trustworthy, I trust; the untrustworthy, I also trust—thus virtue is trust.
I desire goodness and trust, so I respond with goodness and trust.
To those who lack goodness and trust, I also teach them with goodness and trust, so that the people are moved by my virtue to embrace goodness and trust.

When the sage governs the world, they act with reverent care, blending their heart with the world.
In governing the world, the sage guides the people with constant reverence, cultivating virtue in goodness and trust—so that the sage’s heart becomes still, virtue shines with perfect clarity, and all hearts merge in unity for the sake of the world.

The people all turn their ears and eyes toward them,
as the people, transformed by the sage’s virtue, direct their attention to observe and listen.
and the sage treats them all like children.
The sage cherishes all beings as a mother cherishes her infant.

From birth one enters death.
Awakening leads to birth; delusion leads to death—this is the central theme.
Those who follow life number thirteen; those who follow death number thirteen.
Generally speaking, among living beings, those who live in accord with life’s principles and die in accord with death’s principles make up roughly thirteen out of ten.
Those who, in life, move toward the realm of death also number thirteen.
Excessive attachment to life, indulging in its care to the point of harm, leads the heart to cling to life—thus, they move toward death. Such beings lose the principle of life and also fail in the principle of death; these, too, number roughly thirteen out of ten.

Why is this so?
Because of their excessive attachment to life.
One asks: why do they move toward death? Simply because their desire to preserve life is too intense.

Yet I have heard that those who skillfully nurture life
walk on land without encountering rhinoceroses or tigers, and enter battle without being harmed by weapons.
The rhinoceros has nowhere to thrust its horn; the tiger has nowhere to place its claws; weapons have nowhere to lodge their blades.
Those who skillfully safeguard the principles of life embody clarity and stillness, free from grasping desires—thus, external things cannot harm them. They do not seek to encounter tigers or rhinoceroses on land, nor do they invite armed conflict in battle. Since they do not provoke harm, beings harbor no ill intent—so there is nowhere for horns to thrust, claws to strike, or blades to penetrate.

Why is this so? Because they have no ground for death. Why is it that rhinoceroses, tigers, and weapons have nowhere to place their horns, claws, or blades? Because they follow transformation without self-interest, do not regard death as death—thus, things cannot harm their life, and so it is said there is no ground for death.

**Chapter 51: The Dao Gives Them Life**
The Dao gives them life,
its wondrous root and dynamic function descend as harmonious qi.
Virtue nurtures them,
so that things receive life and nourish the ten thousand kinds.
Things take form,
Heaven’s knowledge and Earth’s work manifest in signs and positions.
Circumstance completes them.
The forces of cold and heat each attain fulfillment.

Thus, the ten thousand things none fail to honor the Dao and prize virtue.
The ten thousand things are born and nurtured by the Dao and virtue—hence they honor and prize them.
The honor of the Dao, the prized nature of virtue—
nothing confers rank upon them, yet they are always so by nature.
This means the honor and prized nature of the Dao and virtue do not depend on conferred rank but are ever present, naturally prized through the power of generation and completion.

Thus, the Dao gives them life, nurtures them, makes them grow, rears them, completes them, ripens them, nourishes them, and covers them.
Therefore, none fail to honor the Dao and prize virtue.

Giving life yet not possessing, acting yet not relying, growing yet not dominating—this is called profound virtue.
As explained in the chapter "Nurturing the Soul," that chapter speaks of human cultivation mirroring the Dao, while this chapter clarifies how the Dao’s function resembles that of humans.

**Chapter 52: The World Has a Beginning**
The world has a beginning,
which serves as the mother of the world.
The beginning is the primordial qi—this wondrous qi generates and completes the ten thousand things, possessing the power of flourishing nurturance, and thus can be the mother of the world.

Having attained the mother, one knows her children.
The ten thousand things, having received the flourishing nurturance of primordial harmony, know their own bodies as the children of this primordial qi.
Having known the children, one again guards the mother—
thus, to the end of one’s days, there is no beginning of peril.
Having known the body as the child of primordial qi, one should guard this wondrous harmony, not allowing it to scatter—then, to the end of one’s days, there will be no danger.

Block the openings, close the gates—
throughout life, there will be no toil.
The openings are the loves and delights: the eyes delight in forms, the ears in sounds, the six senses each have their pleasures. Indulgence gives rise to calamity—thus, one blocks them.
Not indulging the six senses’ loves and delights, the gate of misfortune is closed—hence, throughout life, there is no toil.

Open the openings, aid one’s affairs—
throughout life, there will be no rescue.
Opening the six senses, indulging sight and hearing to accomplish one’s loves and delights—calamity will ever be present, and thus throughout life, there will be no rescue.

To see the small is called illumination.
To be able to perceive and amend one’s conduct in subtle matters is called illumination.
To guard softness is called strength.
Guarding softness and weakness, so that others cannot impose upon one, is called strength.

Use its light, return to its illumination.
Seeing the small is illumination; guarding softness is strength. Yet if one boasts of illumination and employs strength, one will lose the meaning of guarding softness and seeing the small. Thus, one should use the light to shine outward while returning to guard inner illumination—then, there will be no enduring affliction.

Not bequeathing misfortune to the body—
this is called inheriting constancy.
To bequeath is to bestow. To return and guard inner illumination is to have nothing bestowed upon the body as misfortune. This is called secretly employing the true and constant Dao.

**Chapter 53: If I Were Steadfast**
If I were steadfast in knowledge and walked the great Dao,
only my actions would be cause for fear.
The Old Master says: If I were haughtily steadfast in my knowledge, desiring to walk the great Dao—since this would not accord with the Dao—all my undertakings would be cause for fear.

The great Dao is level and smooth,
yet the people greatly favor byways.
The great Dao is level and easy, yet those who fear knowledge turn away. The people, moved by desire, seek shortcuts—like travelers who prefer deviant paths.
The perils of deviant paths are fully described below.

The court is excessively adorned—
exalting worthies and boasting wisdom give rise to artifice.
"Adorned" means ordered. The fields are excessively overgrown—

Idle consumption leads to abandoned livelihoods and neglected farming. Granaries stand empty, southern fields yield no harvest, and no stores are laid by. They wear embroidered silks, carving and dyeing fine fabrics to the detriment of craft and profit. They gird themselves with sharp swords, neglecting cultured virtue while prizing martial readiness. They surfeit themselves with rich food, roasting fat and slaughtering fresh delicacies to indulge their palates. "Surfeit" means gluttonous excess. Wealth and goods overflow, hoarded treasures amassed in abundance. This is called "thievish ostentation"—it is not the Way. To pride oneself on knowledge, acting thus to bring about ruin, is to walk the path of theft, yet still to boast and vaunt—such vaunting thievery is not the Way, and only invites lament. "Alas" is an exclamation of sorrow.

**Chapter 54: What Is Well Established Cannot Be Uprooted**
What is well established cannot be uprooted. One who skillfully establishes a state upon the Dao as its foundation cannot be overthrown. What is well embraced cannot be cast off. One who skillfully embraces the people with the Dao cannot be separated from them. Their descendants’ sacrifices will never cease. To speak of a ruler who establishes and embraces with virtue and the Dao: his merit extends to posterity, and they cherish his memory as the sweet pear—how much more his descendants? Kings honor their ancestors for merit, and clans revere theirs for virtue. Thus the rise of Zhou began with Hou Ji and was completed by Wen and Wu. In Zhou’s sacrifices, Hou Ji was worshipped at the suburban altar, and King Wen at the ancestral temple. Though the dynasty’s allotted generations were thirty and its years seven hundred, though ancestral tablets were removed and overflowed beyond the temple, the sacrifices to Hou Ji and King Wen at the suburban and ancestral altars never ceased.

Cultivate it in your person, and your virtue will be genuine. Cultivate the Dao in yourself, and your virtue will be pure. Cultivate it in your household, and your virtue will overflow. When a whole household cultivates it, virtue will abound. Cultivate it in your village, and your virtue will endure. When a whole village cultivates it, virtue will be lasting. Cultivate it in your state, and your virtue will flourish. When a whole state cultivates it, virtue will be abundant. Cultivate it under heaven, and your virtue will be universal. If all under heaven cultivate it, their virtue will extend everywhere.

Thus, observe the person through the person: by the method of cultivating the person, observe the person—those who attain clarity and stillness are genuine. Observe the household through the household: by the method of cultivating the household, observe the household—those who attain harmony are overflowing. Observe the village through the village: by the method of cultivating the village, observe the village—those who attain order are enduring. Observe the state through the state: by the method of cultivating the state, observe the state—those who attain diligence and frugality are flourishing. Observe all under heaven through all under heaven: by the method of cultivating all under heaven, observe all under heaven—those who attain non-action are universal.

How do I know that all under heaven is thus? By this. By observing through these methods—observing the person and the rest—it can be known.

**Chapter 55: One Whose Virtue Is Profound**
One whose virtue is profound is like an infant. The perfected person, who embraces profound virtue, conducts himself like an infant. Poisonous insects do not sting him, fierce beasts do not seize him, birds of prey do not strike him. The perfected one is spirit-like; things cannot harm him. Since he harbors no intent to harm, there is no ground for stinging or striking—this is the perfected one’s profound virtue.

Though his bones are weak and his sinews soft, his grasp is firm. Though he knows nothing of the union of male and female, his organ stirs—such is the perfection of his essence. Though he cries all day, his voice does not grow hoarse—such is the perfection of his harmony. The infant’s bones are weak and his sinews soft, yet he can clench his fists tightly. Though he knows nothing of the coupling of yin and yang, his vital source stirs. This is the perfection of his essence. Though he wails all day, his voice does not grow hoarse—this is the perfection of his harmony.

To know harmony is called constancy. To be like the infant, firmly guarding harmony and softness, is called the practice of constancy. To know constancy is called illumination. To guard harmony and know constancy is called illumination. To seek excess in life is called ominous. "Ominous" signifies the portent of good or ill. To say that one does not know constancy but seeks excess in life, transgressing one’s proper measure, is to move toward death—this is called an ill omen. To let the mind command the qi is called force. The mind has judgments of right and wrong, but qi makes no distinctions. If one employs the mind to command the qi, this is called a violent person. When things reach their prime, they age—this is called not the Way. What is not the Way will soon end. All things, when they reach their full strength, begin to decline. Thus the warning: to be proud of one’s strength and rely on force is called not accordant with the Way—one must end it early.

**Chapter 56: The Knowing Do Not Speak**
The knowing do not speak; those who speak do not know. "Knowing" means thorough comprehension. "Speaking" means eloquent discourse. Block their apertures: those who comprehend are without attachment to dharmas and without clinging to words, thus it is said, "block their apertures." Close their gates: being without attachment, the gates of craving and desire are closed. Blunt their sharpness, untie their tangles, harmonize their light, equalize their dust—this is called mysterious sameness. The explanation is as in the chapter "The Dao Is Empty"; there it describes the Dao, here it describes the person. To say that one can embody the Dao is to be of the same virtue as the mysterious.

Thus, they cannot be drawn near, nor can they be kept at a distance. They cannot be drawn near because of their mysterious sameness, which is without partiality. They cannot be kept at a distance because they are impartial and harmonious with all. They cannot be benefited, nor can they be harmed. Without desire, they cannot be benefited. Without contention, they cannot be harmed. They cannot be honored, nor can they be debased. Embodying the Dao’s spontaneity, they cannot be honored. Being utterly pure, they cannot be debased. Thus, they are honored by all under heaven. Being without obstruction in their embodiment, their words forgotten and principles flowing, sharpness and tangles fully untied, light and dust harmonized—since they cannot be drawn near or kept at a distance, nor honored or debased, they are the most honored under heaven.

**Chapter 57: Governing the State with Rectitude**
Govern the state with rectitude, employ the military with craft, and take all under heaven through non-action. To let all under heaven be at ease, the highest value is non-action. If governance relies on administrative measures to order the state, and warfare on cunning stratagems, these do not accord with the Dao. Only through non-action and non-interference can one take all under heaven—these three sentences set the theme.

How do I know that all under heaven is thus? By this.

By this. By this, the following is known.

The more taboos and prohibitions there are in the world, the poorer the people become. When governance relies on administrative measures to order the state, frequent taboos and prohibitions cause people to lose their livelihoods, thus making them all the poorer.

The more sharp instruments people possess, the more benighted the state grows. "Sharp instruments" refer to cunning stratagems; when the ruler employs many such schemes, unable to return to simplicity, the people below respond with deceit and treachery, thus plunging the state into ever greater chaos.

The more people rely on cleverness, the more strange things arise. When the ruler favors excessive skill and artifice, unable to embrace plainness, the people below respond with extravagance, thus giving rise to ever more perverse and strange phenomena.

The more laws and decrees are promulgated, the more thieves and bandits appear. When non-action is abandoned and laws become ever more explicit, those who exploit them for villainy all become thieves and bandits—how could they not multiply?

Thus the sage declares:
I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves;
I remain without interference, and the people enrich themselves;
I cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves;
I am without desire, and the people return to simplicity.

Through non-action, clarity and stillness arise, so the people transform themselves. Without interference, there is no disturbance, so the people enrich themselves. By cherishing stillness, one attains their true nature, so the people rectify themselves. Without desire, harmony is preserved, so the people return to simplicity. This is how one takes all under heaven through non-interference.

**Chapter 58: Governance in Obscurity**
When governance is obscure, the people are honest and simple. When governance and instruction are obscure, practiced with non-action and magnanimity, the people respond with unadorned sincerity.

When governance is exacting, the people are deficient and worn. When governance and instruction are exacting, practiced with interference and severity, the people respond with deficiency and decay.

Disaster is where fortune leans; fortune is where disaster lurks—who knows their ultimate end? "Leans" means to rely upon; "lurks" means to lie hidden. The preceding passage spoke of obscure governance, which the world may deem lacking in proper order, yet the people respond with unadorned sincerity—this is how disaster becomes the foundation of fortune. When governance is exacting, the world may deem it a method of proper order, yet the people respond with deficiency and decay—this is how fortune conceals disaster. Is there no true standard? What is upright reverts to the strange; what is good reverts to the ominous. Though disaster and fortune have their ultimate standard, sentient beings, deluded and attached, take what is upright to be strange and what is good to be ominous, so disaster and fortune lean upon and lurk within one another as if there were no true standard.

The people’s delusion has endured for a long time. Taking the upright for the strange and the good for the ominous—such inversion has persisted for a long time.

Thus the sage is square but does not cut, has edges but does not wound, is straight but does not extend, is luminous but does not dazzle. The sage excels in transformation: he does not carve to make square, does not wound to make sharp, does not extend to make straight, does not dazzle to make luminous. Cultivating these in himself, all under heaven transforms of its own accord. "Extend" means to stretch forth.

**Chapter 59: Governing People and Serving Heaven**
In governing people and serving heaven, nothing surpasses frugality. "Frugality" means cherishing resources. When a ruler seeks the Dao of governing people and serving heaven, nothing surpasses cherishing expenditures, ensuring granaries are full, people know propriety, and the three seasons are unharmed—then heaven bestows auspicious omens. Harmony among people enables governance; the protection of heaven enables service.

Only through frugality can one be said to serve early. How does one gather the people? Wealth, it is said. Thus, through thrift and cherishing, people from all directions will come bearing their children, early to serve their ruler. "Serve" means to attend to duties.

Early service is called accumulating virtue in abundance. Only through frugality and thrift does one possess virtue; when people turn toward one who has virtue, they early attend to their ruler—thus it is called accumulating virtue in abundance.

With virtue accumulated in abundance, there is nothing one cannot overcome. When the sage accumulates virtue, the four seas turn toward benevolence—there is nothing he cannot subdue. "Overcome" means to be capable.

With nothing one cannot overcome, none know its limit. When the ruler’s virtue leaves nothing beyond his control, there is no distance it does not reach—thus none in the four directions know its ultimate extent.

When none know its limit, one can possess the state. Only when none know its ultimate extent can one possess the state.

Possessing the mother of the state, one can endure long. Possessing the state and nurturing the hundred clans, the state’s blessings and destiny can endure long.

This is called having deep roots and a firm stem—the Dao of long life and enduring vision. Accumulating virtue to possess the state, one’s roots grow deep and the stem firm. Deep and firm, this is the Dao of long life and enduring vision for the state.

*Thus concludes the third scroll of the Tang Emperor Xuanzong’s Imperial Commentary on the Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue.*

*Here begins the fourth scroll of the Tang Emperor Xuanzong’s Imperial Commentary on the Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue.*

**Virtue Classic, Part Two**

**Chapter Sixty: Governing a Great State**
Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish.
When cooking a small fish, one must not stir; when governing a great state, one must not disturb.
Disturbance wearies the people; stirring spoils the fish.
When the Dao presides over the world, its spirits do not manifest their numinosity.
When the Dao presides over the world, one does not seek reckless fortune, and thus spirits have no means to display their divine power.
It is not that the spirits lack numinosity, but that their numinosity does not harm the people.
The preceding speaks of spirits not manifesting their numinosity—not that spirits vanish and lose their power, but that though they possess numinosity, they do not appear as omens to harm the people.
It is not that their numinosity does not harm the people, but that the sage also does not harm them.
If spirits appear as omens, they harm the people; if the sage acts, he harms the people. Now, that spirits do not appear as omens to harm the people is because the sage practices non-action and purity.
When neither harms the other, virtue converges upon them.
If spirits harm the people, the state suffers loss and its foundation is undermined; if the sage harms the people, the spirits are impoverished and sacrifices cease. Now, as neither harms the other, virtue converges upon them.

**Chapter Sixty-One: A Great State as the Lower Reaches**
A great state is the lower reaches, the confluence of the world.
The lower reaches are the virtue of humility. When a great state assumes the lower position to receive and embrace, the people of the world will gather to it.
The confluence of the world is the female.
The female always overcomes the male through tranquility, for she takes tranquility as her lower position.
When the people of the world gather, they submit to the virtue of humility, like the female with her quiet yielding, ever sought by the active male, for she takes tranquility as her lower position.
Thus, if a great state humbles itself before a small state, it will win the small state.
If a small state humbles itself before a great state, it will win the great state.
The great wins the small to make it a servant.
The small wins the great to make it an ally.
Thus, some humble themselves to win, and some humble themselves and win.
"To" refers to the great winning the small; "and" refers to the small winning the great.
A great state desires nothing more than to nurture and govern the people; a small state desires nothing more than to serve and rely upon others.
When a great state upholds the virtue of humility and lowers itself before a small state, it seeks only to nurture and govern the small state as its servant. When a small state offers tribute and submits to a great state, it seeks only to serve and rely upon the great state as its ally.
Both obtain what they desire, and thus the greater should always humble itself.
One seeks servants, the other seeks allies—both obtain what they desire. Yet the great state must ever guard against excess, and so it is especially said that the greater should humble itself.

**Chapter Sixty-Two: The Dao as the Mystery of Myriad Things**
The Dao is the mystery of the myriad things.
All things rely on this wondrous source for their generation and completion; it is the wellspring from which the myriad things draw sustenance. Thus, it is said to be the mystery of the myriad things.
Mystery means within.
It is the treasure of the good,
The good know that those who hold to the Dao prosper, while those who lose it perish. Thus, they always treasure it, free from the entanglements of misfortune.
and the refuge of the not-good.
Refuge means to dwell. The not-good do not treasure the supreme Dao; only when misfortune strikes do they seek to dwell in the Dao to preserve themselves.
Fine words can be traded in the marketplace; exalted conduct can be imposed upon others.
Sweet and fine words can be used to seek trade; lofty and exalted conduct can be used to influence others. By analogy, the sage employs sweet and savory words of Dharma and exalted, pure conduct to transform the not-good, just as merchants sell their wares, leading others to follow the good.
Thus, the following text says:
If people are not good, how can they be cast aside?
The not-good are to be transformed, not abandoned.
Therefore, the Son of Heaven is established, and the Three Dukes are appointed.
Together, they teach the not-good.
Though one may offer a large jade disc preceded by a team of four horses,
it is not as good as sitting and presenting this Dao.
Though the Three Dukes assist with offerings of large jade discs and teams of four horses, it is still not as good as sitting and presenting this Dao of non-action to the ruler, thereby transforming the people.
Why was this Dao so valued in ancient times?
Why is an interrogative particle.

Does one seek it day by day to obtain it, or wait to have sins to be absolved? Therefore, it is prized throughout the world.

The Dao lies in awakening, not in seeking—unlike wealth and silk, which can be sought and obtained daily. Thus it is said: "not sought day by day to obtain." Once awakened, one is naturally free from the burden of sins; how could one wait to have sins before seeking absolution? This is why it can be prized throughout the world.

**Chapter 63: Acting Without Acting**
Act without acting, attend to affairs without affairs, savor the tasteless.
Great and small, many and few—repay resentment with virtue.

In acting without acting, attending to affairs without affairs, savoring the tasteless: if one does not transgress their proper measure, whether great or small, many or few, then there will be no cause for resentment. But if the mind arises in response to external conditions, transgressing one’s measure and harming one’s nature, then nothing—neither great nor small—will fail to become an object of resentment. Now, by abiding in one’s proper measure and preserving harmony, this is repaying resentment with virtue.

Plan for difficulty while it is still easy; accomplish the great while it is still small.
Those who indulge their desires and follow their impulses find no act that is not difficult, no affair that is not great. If one wishes to plan for difficulty and achieve greatness, one must do so before the nature scatters and the measure is transgressed—that is, while it is still easy and small.

The difficult affairs of the world must arise from the easy; the great affairs of the world must arise from the small.
This clarifies the preceding statement on preemptive planning.

Therefore, the sage never attempts the great, and thus accomplishes greatness.
Since great affairs must arise from the small, it is shown that the sage’s ability to accomplish greatness lies in not attempting difficult or great affairs—thus achieving exalted greatness.

Light promises must lack trust; much ease must bring much difficulty.
One who makes light promises deceives others and must lack trust; one who acts with much ease will later encounter much difficulty.

Therefore, the sage treats things as difficult, and thus ultimately encounters no difficulty.
Because the sage does not make light promises or act with ease, they ultimately encounter no great or difficult affairs.

**Chapter 64: Holding What is Secure**
What is secure is easy to hold; what has no sign is easy to plan for.
When a person’s true nature is calm and stable, if one wishes to grasp and preserve it, preventing it from scattering, then even if the mind begins to arise, before any sign has taken shape, one can devise a plan to cut it off, preventing it from arising—all of which is very easy.

What is fragile is easy to break; what is subtle is easy to disperse.
When desire first takes hold, it is still precarious and fragile; one who can sever it finds it fragile and thus easy to break. When misfortune first arises, its signs are still subtle; if one wishes to prevent it, it is subtle and thus easy to disperse.

Act before it exists;
This reiterates the ease of holding and planning: the reason it is easy is that one takes action before any sign exists.

Govern before it becomes disorder.
This reiterates the ease of breaking and dispersing: the reason it is easy is that one governs before misfortune and disorder take shape.

A tree of arm-span girth grows from a tiny sprout; a nine-tiered terrace rises from a basket of earth; a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
These three examples illustrate the danger of not planning early, allowing later calamity to form.

Those who act fail; those who grasp lose.
When ordinary people cannot follow their allotted measure and instead pursue what lies beyond it, those who act in pursuit of success will inevitably fail. When they cannot let go of affairs and instead become attached, those who grasp in pursuit of gain will inevitably lose.

Therefore, the sage acts without acting, and so does not fail; grasps nothing, and so does not lose.
The people’s undertakings often fail when nearly complete.
When people first undertake good deeds, they often fail just as they near completion.

Be cautious at the end as at the beginning, and there will be no failed affairs.
If one is as cautious at the end as at the beginning, maintaining the mind that seeks the good, then there will surely be no misfortune or failure.

Therefore, the sage desires what others do not desire and does not value rare goods.
Rare goods are what one’s nature and measure do not inherently possess. The sage, in desiring what others do not desire, does not pursue what lies beyond their measure, thus always preserving their natural nature—this is why they do not value rare goods.

Learns what others do not learn, to restore what the multitude has transgressed, thereby assisting the naturalness of the myriad things without daring to act.
The sage does not seek learning that transgresses their measure—this is learning what others do not learn—so as to return the multitude’s transgressive learning to its original state, assisting the naturalness of the myriad things without daring to act through worldly learning or excessive desire.

**Chapter 65: Those of Old Who Excelled in the Dao**
Those of old who excelled in the Dao did not use it to enlighten the people but to make them simple.
The ruler who excels in the Dao does not display it to enlighten the people but guides them with harmony, returning them to simplicity, making them like the uncarved.

The people are difficult to govern because of their cunning.
If the ruler employs the Dao to oversee the people, the people will employ cunning to respond—where cunning abounds, deceit arises, making governance difficult.

Therefore, to govern the state with cunning is the state’s ruin.
*With* here means *to employ*. If the ruler employs ministers of much cunning to govern the state, their cunning will inevitably lead to the creation of laws, and where laws are made, deceit arises—thus it is the state’s ruin.

Not to govern the state with cunning is the state’s blessing.
If one does not employ ministers of clever cunning but instead selects those of pure virtue, allowing them to restrain their baser impulses and resolve difficulties with ease, then cunning and deceit will naturally diminish day by day, while simplicity and purity will flourish. The people will be harmonious, the years abundant—thus it is the state’s blessing.

To know these two is also a model.
Employing cunning and deceit harms the people; entrusting those of pure virtue brings blessing to the state. If the ruler can know these two and entrust those of pure virtue, this becomes a model for governance.

To constantly know the model is called profound virtue.
If the ruler constantly knows whom to entrust, this is called profound and mysterious virtue.

Profound virtue is deep and far-reaching; it moves counter to things, and only then does it attain great compliance.
Profound virtue is deep and far-reaching, able to move counter to things, returning them to their root, enabling all things to attain great compliance with their natural nature.

**Chapter 66: The Rivers and Seas as Kings of the Hundred Valleys**

The rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys because they excel at being lowly—thus they become kings of the hundred valleys. The rivers and seas can make the hundred streams entrust and return to them because they excel at humbling themselves—thus the hundred streams pay them homage. Therefore, when the sage desires to be above the people, he speaks with humility. When he desires to lead the people, he places himself behind them. Thus, though he dwells above, the people do not find him burdensome; though he stands before them, the people do not find him harmful. Humility serves as the handle of virtue, and its honored use grows ever more radiant. By speaking with humility, the people joyfully support him, so though he dwells above, they do not find him burdensome. By placing himself behind, the people come to him as children, so though he stands before them, they do not find him harmful. Therefore, the world delights in exalting him without weariness. Because he is neither burdensome nor harmful, the people of the world delight in esteeming him as their lord without tiring. Because he does not contend, none in the world can contend with him. The sage is humble and retiring, not contending with things—who in the world could contend with one whom all esteem?

**Chapter 67: The World All Calls My Dao Great**
The world all calls my Dao great, yet it seems to resemble nothing. "Resemble" means "to be like." The Old Master says: The people of the world all call my Dao great, as though it had no likeness. I would only reply thus. Precisely because it is great, it seems to resemble nothing. If it resembled anything, long ago it would have become small. Precisely because my Dao is supremely great, it has no likeness. If, as in the case of other teachings, it had some likeness, it could not be called great—long ago it would have been trivial. I possess three treasures, which I guard and hold fast. Though my Dao is great and has no likeness, it contains these three practices, most precious and worthy. If one can constantly guard and uphold them, they can govern both body and state. The first is called *ci* (compassion), the second *jian* (frugality), the third "not daring to be first in the world." Compassion enables broad salvation; frugality ensures sufficiency; not daring to be first in the world ensures that one is joyfully esteemed without weariness. Compassion, therefore, enables courage. The compassionate are keen and kind, their virtue abundant—thus they are brave in aiding others. Frugality, therefore, enables breadth. By being sparing and cherishing resources, wealth and provisions remain ample—thus their beneficence grows ever wider. Not daring to be first in the world, therefore, enables one to become the leader of great vessels. The virtues of compassion and frugality, humility and deference, grow ever more radiant. By yielding precedence to others, people will never weary of one—thus one becomes the leader of the sacred vessel. Now, to abandon compassion yet claim courage, to abandon frugality yet claim breadth, to abandon yielding yet claim precedence—this is death. To abandon compassion yet claim courage is to harm others through recklessness; to abandon frugality yet claim breadth is to squander resources; to abandon yielding yet claim precedence is to incur resentment. To waste resources, harm others, and accumulate resentment—this is a path that leads to death. Thus it is called death. Compassion, when used in war, brings victory; when used in defense, brings firmness. Employing compassion in war ensures the safety of the multitude; employing compassion in defense ensures the people’s peace. Each preserves security—thus victory and firmness are achieved. Heaven will save them, protecting them with compassion. In war and defense through compassion, not only do people harmonize, but the luminous Dao of Heaven will also save and protect them. Victory in war is Heaven’s salvation; firmness in defense is Heaven’s protection. All this is due to compassion—thus it is said: Heaven will save them, protecting them with compassion.

**Chapter 68: The Good Warrior**
The good warrior is not martial. "Warrior" refers to affairs. One who excels at governing the state through the Dao values virtue—thus he is not martial. The good fighter is not angry. When affairs leave no choice but to respond to an enemy, employing compassion is the excellence—thus he does not rely on anger. The good conqueror does not contend. Victory lies in harmony; harmony enables good conquest. The excellence of complete victory lies in not engaging in contention. The good employer of others places himself below them. To gladly employ others and enable them to give their full strength, one must first humble oneself—this is the excellence of employment. This is called the virtue of non-contention; this is called employing the strength of others; this is called matching Heaven, the ultimate principle of antiquity. The excellence of conquest is the virtue of non-contention; humility is the employment of others’ strength. One who can do this may be said to match Heaven and be called an emperor—this is the ultimate essential Dao of antiquity.

**Chapter 69: The Strategist’s Saying**

The Venerable Lord lamented the age, grieving that men lightly destroyed one another through warfare, and thus invoked antiquity to set forth his admonitions.

"These words" refer to what follows:

I dare not act as host but remain as guest; I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot. The host initiates action, thereby provoking affairs and fostering greed. The guest has no designs, thus maintaining himself through compassion. Self-preservation ensures complete victory; provoking affairs leads to defeat and ruin. Though advancing even slightly cannot avoid entanglement, retreating even greatly does not lose humility and deference—thus I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.

This is called "marching without marching." As guest, retreating a foot and not contending with things, though one marches to engage the enemy, it is as if one does not march at all.

"Repelling without arms"—to raise one’s arms is to display anger; the good warrior is not angry, thus it is as if one has no arms to raise.

"Drawing without an enemy"—*still* means to lead. One who leads the enemy desires to contend yet does not contend, thus it is as if there is no enemy to draw.

"Wielding without weapons"—to grasp weapons is to display killing; now, with compassion and harmony as one’s master, though one wields weapons, it is as if one has no weapons at all.

No misfortune is greater than underestimating the enemy; one who underestimates the enemy nearly loses my treasure. Of all calamities, none is greater than treating the enemy with contempt; one who treats the enemy with contempt nearly forfeits my treasure of compassion.

Thus, when armies clash in confrontation, the one who grieves prevails. *Kang* means to raise. When two states raise arms against each other, the one who grieves for the people prevails.

**Chapter 70: My Words Are Easily Known**
My words are easily known and easily practiced. The Venerable Lord says: what I speak accords with principle, thus it is easily known; it simplifies affairs, thus it is easily practiced. Yet none in the world can know them, none can practice them. The people of the world are entangled in words and do not awaken; they complicate affairs and do not simplify—thus none can know, none can practice.

Words have their source; affairs have their lord. Words reside in principle; when principle is attained, words are forgotten—thus words take non-words as their source. Affairs reside in achievement; when achievement is complete, one does not dominate—thus affairs take non-affairs as their lord.

It is only due to this lack of knowing that they do not know me. It is only because people lack the knowing of enlightenment that they do not understand my teaching of non-words and non-affairs.

Those who know me are few; thus those who model themselves on me are precious. Those who comprehend my meaning of forgetting knowledge are rare; thus those who follow my teaching of non-words are most noble.

Therefore the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade within. To wear coarse cloth is to conceal one’s outer appearance; to hold jade within is to illuminate one’s inner being. Thus those who know me are few indeed.

**Chapter 71: Knowing Without Knowing Is Supreme**
To know without knowing is supreme. Not to know yet to claim knowledge is a flaw. To understand the emptiness of dharmic nature, which is fundamentally beyond knowing, and to forget knowing in knowing—this is the highest virtue. Not to know the dharmic nature, which is fundamentally empty, yet to insist on knowing—this is the flaw of conduct.

Only by recognizing the flaw as a flaw can one avoid being flawed. Only by recognizing the flaw of knowing can one avoid being afflicted by forced knowing.

The sage is not flawed because he recognizes the flaw; thus he is not flawed. The reason the sage does not suffer from the flaw is that he recognizes the flaw of sentient beings’ forced knowing—thus he is not flawed.

**Chapter 72: When People Do Not Fear Authority**
When people do not fear authority, then great authority arrives. Authority that is truly awe-inspiring is called *wei*. To say that people do not fear minor matters and are careless in guarding against subtle dangers is to say that they will come to face what is greatly awe-inspiring.

Do not constrict their dwelling. The dwelling of the spirit is the heart. Not to constrict means to eliminate emotions and desires, allowing emptiness to give rise to clarity.

Do not weary of what gives them life. What gives life to the body is the spirit. Not to weary means to reduce thought and limit desire, preventing exhaustion and fatigue.

Only by not wearying does one avoid being wearied. Only when people do not weary the spirit does the spirit in turn not weary them.

Thus the sage knows himself but does not display himself; he cherishes himself but does not exalt himself. Knowing himself, he guards against what is awe-inspiring; cherishing himself, he avoids the fault of wearying the spirit. He does not display his abilities to provoke conflict, nor does he exalt himself to accumulate resentment.

Therefore he abandons that and adopts this. He abandons display and exaltation, adopting knowledge and self-cherishing.

**Chapter 73: Courage in Daring**
Courage in daring leads to killing; courage in not daring leads to life. *Daring* means resolute action. To say that one is courageous in resolute action is to say that one loses humility, deference, and retreat, and thus harms oneself—hence it is said to lead to killing. Not daring, then, is what preserves life.

Knowing these two—one beneficial, one harmful—who understands the reason for Heaven’s aversion? These two are daring and not daring. *Or* means "there is." To know that not daring brings benefit and daring brings harm, one must be courageous in not daring—yet even such courageous and daring people, when they act, bring disaster and calamity. This is what Heaven abhors—who can understand its reason?

Thus even the sage finds it difficult. The sage finds it difficult to act with such courage and daring.

The Way of Heaven does not contend yet excels at victory. Hereafter, the Way of Heaven’s humility is admonished to caution human affairs of courage and daring. Heaven does not contend with things; the four seasons wax and wane, and nothing violates them—thus it excels at victory.

It does not speak yet excels at response. What does Heaven say? It blesses the good and punishes the excess, never erring—thus it is said to excel at response.

It does not summon yet comes of itself. The Way of Heaven does not summon things to follow it; things cannot violate it and thus come to accord with Heaven of their own.

Vast and unhurried, it excels at planning. The Way of Heaven is profound and distant, vast and expansive; it manifests signs for people to emulate—thus it is said to excel at planning.

The net of Heaven is vast and wide; though coarse, it does not miss. The net of Heaven, though vast and wide, punishes excess and rewards goodness without the slightest error.

**Chapter 74: The People Constantly Do Not Fear Death**
If the people constantly do not fear death, how can one use death to frighten them? When they indulge their passions and desires, acting in ways that lead to death, and grow accustomed to it, becoming fearless, the ruler should transform them with clarity and stillness—how can one instead establish punishments and executions to terrify them?

If one could make the people constantly fear death and yet some still act perversely, I would seize and execute them—who would dare? If the people were all transformed by the clarity and stillness of their ruler, dared not indulge their passions or desires, and constantly feared death, yet some still acted with perverse cunning—even if my power allowed me to seize and kill such perverse men, who would dare to do so? Thus the text below states:

*There is always one who kills; let that one kill.*

Such perverse and cunning men, though they escape the net of Heaven, are always slain by the one who executes Heaven’s justice. For a ruler to take execution into his own hands is called “taking the place of the great carpenter to hew.” When a ruler delights in personally wielding death, he cannot accord with Heaven’s principle—this is like an unskilled man taking the place of a great carpenter to hew wood. Few who take the place of the great carpenter to hew avoid injuring their own hands. When an unskilled man hews in his place, not only does he ruin the timber, but he also wounds his own hand. When a ruler employs punishments and takes the place of the one who executes, not only does he harm the people, but he also severs his own harmony with Heaven.

**Chapter 75: The People’s Hunger**
The people’s hunger arises from their ruler’s excessive taxation; thus they are hungry. The reason the people of the world suffer hunger and want is that their ruler consumes too much in taxes and levies.

The people are difficult to govern because their ruler acts with contrivance; thus they are difficult to govern. The reason the people of the world are difficult to transform is that their ruler acts with contrivance. Where there is contrivance, there are many troubles; where there are many troubles, deceit arises—thus they are difficult to govern.

The people treat death lightly because they seek life too lavishly; thus they treat death lightly. The reason the people of the world treat death lightly is that they transgress their proper measure in seeking life too lavishly—thus they treat death lightly.

Only one who does not make life his concern is wiser than one who prizes life. When one’s natural measure is fixed, life is preserved whole. If one nurtures life beyond its measure, exceeding that measure leads to death. Therefore, only one who does not make lavishing life his concern is wiser than one who exalts and prizes it.

**Chapter 76: The People’s Life**
When the people are alive, they are supple and weak; when they are dead, they are stiff and strong. All things, grasses and trees, are supple and fragile in life; in death, they are withered and dry.

Thus the stiff and strong are companions of death; the supple and weak are companions of life. The suppleness and weakness of life arise from the wholeness of harmonious qi. The stiffness and strength of death arise from the dispersal of harmonious qi.

This makes clear that to preserve suppleness and weakness is to preserve life and prolong years. To act with violence and arrogance is to lose one’s body and forfeit one’s nature.

Thus when armies are strong, they do not prevail. He who shows compassion prevails—thus we know that relying on strength leads to defeat.

When wood is strong, it is felled. The trunk of a tree is strong and large, so it remains below. The branches and twigs are supple and weak, and together they grow above. This is because the supple and weak are above, while the strong and violent are below. Thus the text below states:

*The strong and great dwell below; the supple and weak dwell above.*

**Chapter 77: The Way of Heaven**
The Way of Heaven—is it not like the drawing of a bow? The Way of Heaven is profound and distant; without analogy, it cannot be made clear. Thus it takes the drawing of a bow to illustrate its function.

What is high is pressed down; what is low is lifted up. What has excess is reduced; what is deficient is supplemented. When a bow is drawn thus, it can hit the mark—this is like the Way of Heaven, which diminishes the full and augments the humble. It desires that rulers emulate Heaven in nurturing the people, thus demonstrating the principle of pressing down the high and lifting up the low.

The Way of Heaven reduces excess to supplement deficiency; the way of man is not so—it reduces deficiency to serve excess. The Way of Heaven is balanced, taking from the many to benefit the few. Man violates Heaven, instead diminishing the deficient.

Who can take from his excess to offer it to the world? Only one who embodies the Dao. Who can take from his own excess to offer it to the world’s deficiencies? Only one who embodies the Dao can do so.

Thus the sage acts but does not rely on his actions. The sage emulates Heaven, apportioning things with even-handedness. He bestows balance upon things but does not rely on his achievement.

His achievement is complete, yet he does not dwell in it. He ascribes achievement to things and does not reside in its completion.

He does not wish to display his worth. The reason the sage ascribes achievement and does not dwell in it is that he does not wish things to see his worthiness.

**Chapter 78: The Suppleness of the World**
In the world, nothing is more supple than water, yet in attacking the hard and strong, nothing can surpass it—there is nothing that can replace it. When hardness attacks hardness, both hard things are damaged. When suppleness overcomes strength, strength is diminished while suppleness remains whole. Thus in attacking the hard and strong, nothing can replace water.

Therefore, the supple overcomes the hard; the weak overcomes the strong. In the world, none do not know this, yet none can practice it. Though all in the world know that the way of suppleness and weakness overcomes the hard and strong, knowing this principle, they cannot put it into practice.

Thus the sage says: *To bear the nation’s disgrace is to be called lord of the altars of soil and grain. To bear the nation’s misfortune is to be called king of all under Heaven.*

To take upon oneself the sins of all directions is to bear the nation’s filth. To call oneself "solitary," "widowed," or "unworthy" is to bear the nation’s misfortune. When one’s virtue is thus, the altars of soil and grain are served—thus the people of the world turn toward him.

Straight words seem contrary. To bear the nation’s disgrace and be called lord of the altars of soil and grain, to bear the nation’s misfortune and be called king of all under Heaven—these must be straight words that initially seem contrary to custom. Thus it is said: *Straight words seem contrary.*

**Chapter 79: Reconciling Great Resentment**

Great resentment that stands in opposition to the self arises from the passions and desires. "Reconciling" means to harmonize. The ruler, wishing to harmonize the people through verbal instruction so they may be free of passions and desires, is said to "reconcile great resentment." Yet there will inevitably remain residual resentment. When teachings are established to transform the people, traces cannot be avoided; the harm of these traces in turn becomes a source of resentment—thus it is said, "there will inevitably remain residual resentment." How can this be considered good? Since residual resentment persists, it cannot be deemed good. Therefore the sage holds fast to the left tally without making demands upon others. The "left tally" is the heart-mind. As the heart-mind is the yang repository, it aligns with the external realm—hence it is called the left tally. The sage, knowing that establishing teachings must leave traces, and that traces give rise to residual resentment, thus holds firm to this heart-mind, keeping it pure and tranquil. Those below are transformed by it, freeing them from passions and desires, so that no reproach or coercion is needed—they naturally align with non-action. Thus, one of virtue governs by the tally, while one without virtue governs by thoroughfare. "Governs" means to preside; "thoroughfare" means to penetrate. The ruler of virtue presides over the heart-mind’s tally, and the people transform themselves. The ruler without virtue enacts laws to penetrate the people, but the harm of such laws precludes true goodness. The Way of Heaven shows no partiality; it ever aligns with the good. Presiding by the tally brings purity and tranquility; enacting laws brings decay and ruin. August Heaven is impartial, aiding only those of virtue. Thus the ruler must ever contemplate pure transformation through non-action, and must not enact laws that give rise to affairs.

**Chapter 80: Small States and Few People**

In a small state with few people, let there be tools sufficient for the work of ten or a hundred, yet unused. "Ten" refers to assistants; "hundred" to leaders. This chapter shows that when the ruler embodies pure harmony and seeks nothing beyond, even if there are village tools fit for assistants or leaders, they will have no use. Let the people regard death as weighty and not wander far. With few thoughts and scant desires, they do not lightly risk their lives; rooted in fundamentals and seeking nothing, they do not migrate far. Though there be boats and carriages, none will ride them. Though there be armor and weapons, none will array them.

Let the people return to knotting cords for use. Boats and carriages serve to facilitate migration, armor and weapons to engage in attack and warfare—when both desires are absent, none will ride or array them. Returning to simplicity and restoring purity, they revert to the knotted-cord usage of the Three Sovereigns.

Let them find sweetness in their food,
not seeking rich flavors, thus their fare is ever sweet.
Let them find beauty in their garments,
not adorning them with embroidery, thus their attire is ever beautiful.
Let them find peace in their dwellings,
not embellishing their halls and roofs, thus their homes are ever peaceful.
Let them delight in their customs,
not corrupting simplicity and purity, thus their ways are ever joyful.

Neighboring states may gaze upon one another, the sounds of their chickens and dogs heard across the distance—so near are they. Yet the people, from old age to death, do not come and go between them. Each is wholly sufficient, reaching the utmost absence of desire.

**Chapter 81: Truthful Words Are Not Fine**

Truthful words are not fine.
Truthful words are the sagely teachings. "Truthful" means real; their speech does not harmonize with the vulgar, thus they are not fine.
Fine words are not truthful.
Fine words are substitute teachings. Sweet and pleasing speech moves in accord with the vulgar, thus it is not truthful.

The good do not dispute,
the good reside in action, without disputation.
the disputatious are not good.
Those who cling to empty disputation are thus not good.

The wise are not broadly learned,
the wise attain enlightenment.
the broadly learned are not wise.
Those with broad learning possess much hearing.

The sage does not accumulate.
To accumulate is to cling to words and stagnate in teachings, having something stored up. The sage understands words yet forgets words, awakens to teachings yet relinquishes teachings, entirely without attachment or stagnation—thus it is said they do not accumulate.

Having already given to others, they themselves have all the more;
having already given to others, they themselves have all the more.
This clarifies the inexhaustibility of the Dharma-nature. Though the sage does not accumulate or stagnate in words and teachings, when using the flavor of Dharma to guide the foolish and ignorant, they give it all to others. Yet in the sage’s nature of purity and stillness, there is never any diminution—only greater clarity. Thus it is said, "all the more" and "all the more abundant." "All the more" clarifies the illumination of self-nature; "all the more abundant" clarifies the benefit to others.

The Way of Heaven benefits and does not harm.
The Way of the sage acts and does not contend.
Citing the Way of Heaven’s benefiting things without harm, it clarifies that the Way of the sage, in its enactments and vast benefits, constantly gives to others—thus it does not contend.
