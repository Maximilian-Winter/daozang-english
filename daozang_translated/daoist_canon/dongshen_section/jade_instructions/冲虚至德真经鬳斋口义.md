**Liezi**
Liezi’s surname was Lie, given name Yukou, a native of Zheng. He dwelt in the Zheng gardens for forty years, yet none recognized him. Initially, he served Huqiuzi, later became a disciple of Lao Shangshi, and befriended Bogaozi, advancing in the Way of these two masters. After nine years, he could ride the wind and travel.

His disciple Yan Hui asked: "Is the purpose of seeking the Way to attain wealth?"
Liezi replied: "Jie and Zhou prized profit and scorned the Way, thus they perished."

His book comprises eight chapters. Liezi was a man of the Way, and Zhuangzi frequently praised him. The present Liezi Temple in Putian, Bianliang (modern Zhengzhou), marks his former retreat. During the Tang Kaiyuan era, he was enfeoffed as the Perfected Lord of Supreme Emptiness and Ultimate Virtue, and his text was titled *The Perfect Scripture of Supreme Emptiness and Ultimate Virtue*.

The *New Book* was definitively arranged into eight chapters. The Left Supervisor of the Capital Waterworks and Grand Master of Splendid Happiness, Minister Xiang, stated: "The newly collated *Liezi* from the Central Secretariat comprises five fascicles. Your servant Xiang, along with Minister Can, Prefect of Changshe, collated three fascicles from the Chamberlain for Ceremonials, four from the Grand Scribe, six from your servant Xiang’s collection, and two from Minister Can’s. The combined internal and external texts totaled twenty fascicles. After removing twelve duplicate fascicles, eight were finalized. The Central Secretariat’s version was more extensive, while external texts were fewer. Chapters were disordered and scattered across various fascicles, with frequent character errors—such as *jin* (exhaust) miswritten as *jin* (advance), or *guan* (thread) as *xing* (form). Some passages in the *New Book* were fragmentary, and collation relied on the Central Secretariat’s version for finalization. All were transcribed onto bamboo slips, ready for copying."

Liezi was a man of Zheng, a contemporary of Duke Mu of Zheng, and a master of the Way. His teachings originated from the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, and he was styled a Daoist. The Daoists grasp the essential and hold to the root, embracing clarity, emptiness, and non-action. In cultivating the self and engaging with others, they esteem non-contention, aligning with the Six Classics. However, the chapters *King Mu* and *Tang’s Questions* are fantastical and extravagant, unworthy of a noble person’s discourse. As for the *Power and Fate* chapter, it expounds on predetermined destiny akin to Yangzi’s teachings, prizing only unrestrained abandon—two doctrines at odds, unlike a single school’s work. Yet each has its insights, offering much of value.

During Emperor Jing of Han’s reign, the arts of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi were esteemed, and this text circulated widely. Later, it fell into obscurity, scattered among the people, with no transmitters remaining.

Moreover, it abounds in allegories akin to those of Zhuang Zhou, which is why Sima Qian the Grand Historian did not include it in his *Records* but merely appended it as a catalogue entry.

Your servant, Xiang, humbly submits this *Catalogue of the* Liezi *as Collated by the Left Director of the Capital Waterworks, the Grand Master of Splendid Happiness, Your Servant Xiang*. Presented on the renyin day of the eighth month in the third year of the Yongshi era.

**Heavenly Auspices, Chapter One**
This chapter focuses on the principles of Heaven, and because they are precious, it is called "Auspices."

Master Liezi dwelled in the gardens of Zheng for forty years, yet no one recognized him. The lord of the state and his ministers and grandees regarded him as one of the common folk. When the state’s resources were insufficient, he prepared to "marry" into Wei. His disciples said: "Master, if you depart without a set time for return, dare we make a request? What teaching will you leave us?" The Master replied: "Have you not heard the words of Master Huqiu Zilin?" That Zheng has its Yuan gardens is like Qin having its Ju parks—see the *Zuozhuan*. Liezi dwelled beside the gardens of Zheng, hence his "marriage" to Wei. "Marriage" and "mourning" here are regional expressions. Master Huqiu Zilin was one whom Liezi served, so his disciples inquired about his teacher’s words.

Master Liezi smiled and said: "What words did Master Hu have?" Though he added: "Yet our Master once spoke to Bohun Maoren, and I overheard it from the side. Let me tell you." "What words?" implies that this cannot be transmitted through words. "Our Master" refers to Huqiu. "Maoren" was Huqiu’s friend. "Overheard from the side" means he stood beside his teacher and heard it. First saying "what words?" before recounting them suggests that the wordless teaching is more wondrous than the spoken.

His words were: "That which has life does not live; that which transforms does not change. The non-living can give life; the unchanging can effect change. The living cannot but live; the changing cannot but change—thus there is constant life and constant change. In constant life and constant change, there is no time without life, no time without change: such is yin and yang, such are the four seasons. The non-living is solitary and unique; the unchanging is cyclical recurrence. Their boundary cannot be exhausted. 'Solitary and unique'—its Dao cannot be fathomed."

That which has life arises from the non-living; that which transforms originates from the unchanging. Only the non-living and unchanging can give rise to life and effect change—this is the work of creation. The living cannot but live; the changing cannot but change—such are the myriad things. Creation is without life or change, hence it is constant life and constant change. "No time" is synonymous with "constant." The phrasing here merely elaborates. Yin and yang, the four seasons, refer to creation. The two "such" below substantiate the preceding "non-living" and "unchanging."

"Solitary and unique" resembles Laozi’s "seeming the ancestor of the myriad things" and "prior to the Lord on High." "Unique" conveys the sense of utmost loftiness and wonder, without peer. "Solitary" suggests something seemingly present yet elusive, beyond description. "Cyclical recurrence" refers to the alternation of yin and yang and the four seasons, which knows no end—hence "their boundary cannot be exhausted." The "solitary and unique" is creation: vague and indistinct, seemingly existent yet nonexistent—thus "its Dao cannot be fathomed."

The *Book of the Yellow Emperor* says: "The valley spirit does not die; it is called the mysterious female. The gateway of the mysterious female is called the root of Heaven and Earth. Subtle and continuous, it seems to endure; its function is inexhaustible." This is the complete text of a chapter in the *Laozi*, yet it is attributed to the *Book of the Yellow Emperor*, showing that Laozi’s teachings had a lineage, though his complete writings are no longer extant.

In the *Laozi*, Chapter Six: "Essence is full; spirit is empty." "Valley" signifies emptiness. "Valley spirit" is the spirit within emptiness. It speaks of the human spirit emerging from emptiness, hence it endures and does not die. "Mysterious" denotes the boundless and infinite; "female" denotes emptiness and insubstantiality—these two characters merely describe emptiness. Heaven and Earth emerge from this, hence it is called the root. "Subtle and continuous" conveys unceasing persistence. "Seems to endure" means seeming both present and absent. Functioning within emptiness, it is effortless and ever-present—this aligns with Laozi’s "empty yet inexhaustible, active yet ever more productive."

Master Huiweng said: "Within the most wondrous principle lies the intent of ceaseless generation." This is a fine observation, though it leans toward the discourse on nourishing life. While this chapter can serve that purpose, Laozi’s original intent was not solely focused on it. Thus, Liezi cites it to substantiate his discourse on the non-living and unchanging.

Therefore, that which gives life does not live; that which transforms does not change. Self-generating, self-transforming, self-forming, self-coloring, self-knowing, self-empowering, self-diminishing, self-ceasing—it is not that these are called generation and transformation, form and color, knowledge and power, diminution and cessation. That which gives life does not live, for it does not impose intention on life. That which transforms does not change, for it does not exert force on transformation. Throughout Heaven and Earth, all is naturally so.

"Form" and "color" refer to humans and things. "Knowledge" and "power" distinguish among humans. "Diminution" and "cessation" encompass decline and success, life and death, gain and loss. That which is naturally so is life yet not life, change yet not change, form yet not form, color yet not color, diminution yet not diminution, cessation yet not cessation. Initially without fixed names, without tangible traces—if one seeks it through fixed names and tangible traces, one errs. It does not say "without fixed names or tangible traces" but merely uses the word "called," which is strikingly apt.

Master Liezi said: "Of old, the sages followed yin and yang to unify Heaven and Earth. If the formed arises from the formless, then whence came Heaven and Earth?" This chapter first poses the question "What words?" from Master Hu, and having expounded one passage, now returns to the phrase "What words?"—these three characters carry profound meaning.

The *Zhuangzi* states: "One may speak all day yet never have spoken." This aligns with the same meaning. Thus it is said: There is the Great Simplicity (Taiyi), the Great Beginning (Taichu), the Great Origin (Taishi), and the Great Purity (Taisu). The Great Simplicity is that in which qi has not yet appeared; the Great Beginning is the inception of qi; the Great Origin is the inception of form; the Great Purity is the inception of substance.

The *Zhuangzi* further says: "There is a beginning; there is that which precedes the beginning; there is that which precedes even that which precedes the beginning." Its words are wondrously subtle. This text divides it into four names, yet it remains but the intent of *Zhuangzi*. "Form" is the general term; "substance" follows the nature of things; "qi" generates form. That in which qi has not yet appeared is the boundless giving rise to the bounded.

The *Zhuangzi* states: "Qi intermingles in the realm of the indistinct and nebulous, and there arises form." Here, another layer is added to qi. This "yi" (易) must not be taken as the *Yi* of the Confucian classics—*yi* means transformation, and transformation means change. The Great Simplicity is the great process of creation.

"Form" is the beginning, "substance" is the purity. What artisans today call "embryonic purity" (taisu) is this same "su." When qi, form, and substance are all present yet not yet separated, it is called "primordial chaos" (hunlun). "Primordial chaos" means that the myriad things are intermingled and not yet distinct. It cannot be seen, cannot be heard, cannot be grasped—hence it is called *yi*.

*Yi* has no fixed boundaries. It transforms into the One; the One transforms into the Seven; the Seven transforms into the Nine. The Nine is the culmination, after which it transforms back into the One. The One is the beginning of the transformation of form.

Having spoken of the four "Great" terms above, here qi, form, and substance are summarized together. This not only expresses the subtlety of principle but also serves as the pivot of composition. Without such a pivot, the artful turning of prose would not be revealed.

When qi, form, and substance are all present yet not yet separated, it is merely the inception of that in which qi has not yet appeared. At the inception of that in which qi has not yet appeared, one sees only its vast, undifferentiated expanse. Yet when the myriad things are said to be intermingled, it is spoken of in terms of the Three Powers (Heaven, Earth, and Humanity)—not as the "myriad things" are spoken of elsewhere.

"To follow" (xun) means "to seek." If qi has not yet appeared, then what is there to see? What is there to hear? What is there to seek?

Thus, the *Yi* (Change) is precisely the Great Change (*Taiyi*). Observing this single statement, one sees that all below—where form, qi, and substance are present—merely elucidates the two characters *Taiyi* ("Great Change"). "Without form or boundary" speaks of the absence of traces. "Transforming into the One" means that only after qi transforms does the Supreme Ultimate (*Taiji*) arise. With the Supreme Ultimate comes yin-yang and the Five Phases, hence it is said: "One transforms into seven"—yin and yang (two) together with the Five Phases make seven. The numbers of young yin and old yin are eight and six; the numbers of young yang and old yang are seven and nine. Here, the "nine" refers to the ultimate number of *Qian*. Some take seven as young yang and nine as old yang, but this is not the intent of this text. Nine transforms again into one, for it is said: when things reach their extreme, they change; what exists must return to non-existence. Non-existence gives rise to existence, hence it is said: "The One is the inception of form’s transformation." This is the ultimate principle.

The pure and light ascends to become Heaven; the turbid and heavy descends to become Earth; the harmonious qi of the mean becomes Humanity. Thus, Heaven and Earth contain essence, and the myriad things are transformed and born. Yang qi, light and pure, ascends to form Heaven; yin qi, turbid and heavy, descends to form Earth; the harmonious union of yin and yang qi becomes Humanity. "Harmonious" (*chong*) also means "balanced." The generation of things by Heaven and Earth likewise arises from the union of yin and yang’s essence, whence transformation and life proceed. Hence it is said: "Sole yin does not generate; sole yang does not complete."

Master Liezi said: "Heaven has no perfect function, the sage has no perfect ability, and the myriad things have no perfect use." Thus, Heaven’s duty is to generate and cover; Earth’s duty is to shape and bear; the sage’s duty is to teach and transform; and things fulfill their proper roles. Yet Heaven has its shortcomings, Earth has its strengths, the sage has his limitations, and things have their capacities. Why? The one who generates and covers cannot shape and bear; the one who shapes and bears cannot teach and transform; the one who teaches and transforms cannot violate what is proper; and what is proper is fixed and does not transgress its position. Thus, the Way of Heaven and Earth is either yin or yang; the teaching of the sage is either benevolence or righteousness; the proper role of the myriad things is either softness or hardness. All these follow what is proper and cannot transgress their positions.

This passage is entirely sound in its reasoning. Its main idea is that even Heaven and Earth cannot exhaust the uses of creation—how much less can humanity and things? Heaven can generate and cover things; Earth can form and bear things. Each has its capacities, and thus none possesses perfect function. The sage, dwelling between Heaven and Earth, is charged with the duty of teaching and transformation, following the proper roles of the myriad things so that each fulfills its office. "The sage has his limitations, and things have their capacities" means that the sage may have what he cannot do while things can do it; teaching and transformation cannot violate what is proper. For example, loyalty, substance, and refinement follow the times; the Nine Virtues follow their natures—all are cases where one cannot violate what is proper. The proper roles of things are each fixed: the crooked cannot be made straight, the small cannot be made large, the salty cannot be made sour, the cool cannot be made hot—these do not transgress their positions.

Yin-yang, hardness-softness, benevolence-righteousness: the *Great Commentary on the Yi* divides these among Heaven, Earth, and Humanity, while here they are divided among Heaven, Earth, the sage, and the myriad things—this too has its reason.

Thus, there are those that generate, and those that generate generation; there are those that form, and those that form formation; there are those that sound, and those that sound sound; there are those that color, and those that color color; there are those that flavor, and those that flavor flavor. What is generated by the generative perishes, yet the generative never ends; what is formed by the formative is substantial, yet the formative never exists; what is sounded by the sonorous is heard, yet the sonorous never emits; what is colored by the chromatic is manifest, yet the chromatic never appears; what is flavored by the sapid is tasted, yet the sapid never presents itself. All are the offices of non-action.

"Those that generate, form, sound, color, and flavor" refer to the myriad things in Heaven and Earth. "Those that generate generation, form formation, sound sound, color color, and flavor flavor" are creation, the office of the ruler—non-active creation. The non-generative generates what is generated; the formless forms what is formed; extending to coloring what is colored, sounding what is sounded, and flavoring what is flavored—all are the offices of creation.

The passage that follows is again singularly striking: It can be yin, it can be yang; it can be soft, it can be hard; it can be short, it can be long; it can be round, it can be square; it can give life, it can bring death; it can be hot, it can be cool; it can float, it can sink; it can be *gong*, it can be *shang*; it can emerge, it can submerge; it can be dark, it can be yellow; it can be sweet, it can be bitter; it can be rank, it can be fragrant. It has no knowledge, no ability—yet there is nothing it does not know, nothing it cannot do.

These twenty-four "can"s are merely the two words "creation’s work." The marvel of creation is that, though it seems to have no knowledge or ability, there is nothing it does not know, nothing it cannot do.

This passage is also excellent.

Master Liezi was traveling to Wei and ate by the roadside. His followers saw a century-old skull. Plucking a clump of mugwort, he pointed and said to his disciple Baifeng: "Only you and I know that it has never been born and never died. Has this exceeded nourishment? Exceeded joy?"

There are manifold transformations of beings: when a frog becomes a quail, or when it meets water and becomes duckweed, or when it encounters the scum that forms upon water and earth, it becomes the green cloak of moss. If born upon a mound, it becomes plantain. When plantain meets rich soil, it becomes crow’s-foot. The root of crow’s-foot becomes a grub, its leaves become butterflies. Butterflies, in turn, transform into insects, born beneath the stove, their form like a cast-off husk, and they are called *niao-gou-duo*. After a thousand days, *niao-gou-duo* transforms into a bird called *gan-yu-gu*. The froth from *gan-yu-gu* becomes *si-mi*. *Si-mi* becomes *shi-xi*, which in turn gives rise to *yi-lu*. *Yi-lu* generates *shi-xi-huang-xu*, and *shi-xi-huang-xu* generates *jiu-you*. *Jiu-you* generates *mao-rui*, and *mao-rui* generates *fu-quan*. This passage parallels *Zhuangzi*, though with several additional phrases.

As Liezi ate by the roadside, he saw within a clump of mugwort this withered skull, and pointing to it, he spoke to his disciple. Baifeng was his name. "Never born, never dead"—this is the state of neither birth nor death. "He" refers to the skull, while "I" refers to Liezi himself. The two phrases "exceeded nourishment" and "exceeded joy" in *Zhuangzi* read: "Is this true nourishment? Is this true joy?" The meaning runs deep. This text omits the words "if" and "I," replacing "true" with "exceeded," likely a corruption of the sound. If interpreted thus, it might suggest that this dead one, in life, indulged excessively in self-nurture or in joy. Though the logic holds, it lacks depth. Following *Zhuangzi*’s intent, it should say: "Do you truly know how one nourishes oneself in life? Do I truly know the joy of extinction after death?" Pointing to the skull, he refers to himself. To live is to eat and drink—this is nourishment; to die is to find joy in stillness. Yet here, the phrasing is inverted, playing with the brush’s artistry.

"Manifold transformations of beings" speaks of the ceaseless generation of things in heaven and earth, each kind distinct, yet all traced to the most minute origins—not to illustrate the great through the small, but to show that the great differs not from the small. This conveys the idea of no smallness, no greatness, no nobility, no baseness. The meaning is precisely this, yet the brilliance of the writing transcends the ages. Within order, there is disorder; within disorder, order—like watching drifting clouds or a skein of wild geese, like gazing upon solitary peaks or broken slopes, the more one reads, the finer it becomes. The additions in this text, however, make it inferior to *Zhuangzi*. "When a frog becomes a quail" refers to the frog’s transformation into a quail, though *Zhuangzi* omits these four characters, which also disrupt the flow of the following line. "Scum" refers to the film of dust and grime upon water, the first growth of algae not yet fully formed, with threads of silk entwined—though the thing itself is most minute. "The green cloak of moss" is simply green algae. "The meeting of water and earth" refers to the water’s edge where it clings to the shore, where such growth is typically thick and abundant, hence called a "cloak." These two lines describe algae, then shift to speak of mounds. "Mounds" are the high places in fields and wilds. "Plantain" is the coin-leaf herb. "Rich soil" is manure and earth. When coin-leaf grows in rich soil, it transforms into crow’s-foot grass. The root of crow’s-foot becomes a grub, while its leaves become butterflies. The grub is the scarab beetle. *Xu* is another name for butterflies. The addition of this line beneath "butterflies" is particularly striking. What follows describes the transformations of insects born beneath the stove, which then become creatures called *niao-gou-duo*. Soft and without skin or shell, they resemble a shed husk, much like the silkworm. The *niao-gou-duo* insect then transforms into a bird. *Gan-yu-gu* is the name of this bird. The froth from its beak becomes *si-mi*. *Si-mi* is an insect. *Shi-xi* are midges. *Yi-lu* and *huang-xu* are also insect names. Here, three instances of "midge" appear, likely errors in transmission. *Jiu-you*, *mao-rui*, and *fu-quan* are also insect names. *Zhuangzi* omits several characters here, intending to convey that the transformations of the myriad things are endless and inexhaustible.

Sheep’s liver transforms into earthworms; horse blood into will-o’-the-wisps; human blood into marsh fires. The sparrowhawk becomes the goshawk, the goshawk becomes the cuckoo. The cuckoo, in time, reverts to the sparrowhawk. Swallows become clams; field mice become quails; rotting gourds become fish; old leeks become amaranth; aged rams become gibbons; fish roe becomes *gu* insects. The beast *dan-yuan* conceives of itself and is called *lei*. The marsh bird *yi* is born from gazing and is called the osprey. The purely female is named *da-yao*; the purely male is named *zhi-feng*. These lines do not appear in *Zhuangzi*, and the repeated use of "also" disrupts the flow, though they too describe the transformations of things. As in the *Monthly Ordinances*, sparrows become clams, and hawks become turtledoves—such are the natural principles of heaven and earth, inevitable occurrences. An aged ram becoming a gibbon is like an old mouse becoming a bat. *Dan-yuan* is a beast recorded in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*, resembling a leopard but with fur. "Conceiving of itself" means it is female without males. Some say the same of the women’s kingdom in the sea. *Lei* is its name. The osprey is the bird *Zhuangzi* describes: the male cries facing the wind, the female cries with the wind, and they conceive by gazing. *Da-yao* refers to creatures like turtles and softshells, purely female without males, while bees are purely male without females. *Zhi* means small. Bees in the hive transform by incantation, their tails bearing stings—only the queen lacks them.

Some say: this creature takes the multitude of yang to honor yin—yin is its sovereign. The yearning scholar remains unwed yet stirs response; the longing maiden knows no husband yet conceives. Hou Ji was born from a giant’s footprint; Yi Yin was born from the hollow mulberry—these four lines speak of transformations among humans. Jue Zhao was born from dampness; vinegar gnats arise from wine—these two lines speak of common transformations in foodstuffs. The *yangxi* grass pairs with the unyielding shoot; aged bamboo gives rise to the *qingning*. The *qingning* begets the *cheng*; the *cheng* begets the horse; the horse begets man; man in time enters the mechanism. All things emerge from the mechanism, all things return to the mechanism. From this point onward, the passage aligns with *Zhuangzi*. Viewed through *Zhuangzi*, having expounded the preceding section, it then ties off with the most bizarre conclusion—this is where it aims to shock the vulgar, not a statement of truth. Now, with the addition of the yearning scholar and maiden, the text becomes muddled.

*Yangxi* is the name of a grass. Grasses resembling bamboo that do not produce edible shoots are called *bugou*; aged bamboo that does produce edible shoots is edible, but this is not. *Qingning* is an insect; *cheng* is also an insect. *Ma* (horse) is likewise a grass, such as what is now called *machicai* (horse’s-teeth vegetable) or *malancao* (indigo plant). *Ren* (man) is also a grass, such as what is now called *renshen* (ginseng) or *renmianzi* (dracontomelon). Clearly employing many plant names, it then speaks of the characters for "horse" and "man," deliberately crafting deceptive and strange terms. Those who have sought to explain this before have all admitted uncertainty—countless generations have been duped, unable to see through it. The transformations of the myriad things, endlessly arising and ceaselessly born—what is there that does not exist?

Entering the mechanism speaks of returning to annihilation. To exit the mechanism and enter the mechanism is to exit and enter death and life—this is the transmission of fire, yet one knows not its end.

In the *"Utmost Joy"* chapter, I have long suspected that the *Liezi* is not a complete work, and this passage makes it all the clearer. Since the Qin dynasty, many books have been scattered and lost; those recovered later emerged only after being sought, obtained at different times, preserved in varying quantities, and only settled after collation. By the time of collation, errors and admixtures had already occurred. Then came the calamities of the Central Plains under the Jin, and books were lost again. When they resurfaced in the south, many forgeries became intermingled, as with the *Guan Yinzi*. What is good is entirely good; what is adulterated is entirely adulterated. The first several passages at the beginning of this book’s first chapter are exquisite, beyond doubt, but the middle sections are inevitably mixed with later interpolations. Yet the refinement or crudeness of its text is still easily discerned.

The *Book of the Yellow Emperor* states: *"When form moves, it does not generate form but generates shadow; when sound moves, it does not generate sound but generates echo. Where non-being does not generate non-being, it generates being."* Form must come to an end. Do heaven and earth end? They end together with me. Do they advance toward an end? I do not know. The Dao ends where there was originally no beginning; it advances where there was originally no duration. That which is born returns to non-birth; that which has form returns to formlessness. Yet the non-born is not originally non-born; the formless is not originally formless. *"When form moves, it generates shadow; when sound moves, it generates echo"*—these two lines are well put, for their meaning is to illustrate how non-being generates being. All that is generated from being arises from non-being, and thus all being must return to non-being. That which has form must have an end. Heaven and earth are also form—how could they not end together with me? Yet if one believes that heaven and earth end in annihilation, this is something I cannot know. Thus it says: *"Do they advance toward an end? I do not know."* "Advance" means "end"; to take "end" as "advance" is a corruption of the pronunciation. If there was originally no beginning, then there is no end; if there was originally no duration, then there is no annihilation. "No duration" means ceaseless transformation. That which is born must return to non-birth, for non-birth is the source of birth. That which has form must return to formlessness, for formlessness is the source of form. If something was originally non-born, then it has no name of non-birth; if something was originally formless, then it has no name of formlessness. To call it non-birth or formlessness is already to depart from its truth. Thus it says: *"The non-born is not originally non-born; the formless is not originally formless."*

That which is born is by principle that which must end. What must end cannot but end, just as what is born cannot but be born. Yet to desire eternal life and to halt the end is to be deluded by calculations. Spirit is the portion allotted by heaven; bones and flesh are the portion allotted by earth. That which belongs to heaven is clear and disperses; that which belongs to earth is turbid and congeals. When spirit departs from form, each returns to its true nature—this is called *gui* (ghost). *Gui* means "to return," to return to one’s true dwelling.

The Yellow Emperor said: *"When spirit enters its gate and bones return to their root, where then do I remain?"* This passage directly expounds the principle of life and death, and its explanation is indeed clear. Death and life are the constant principle, yet those who covet life constantly seek to preserve it. *"To halt"* means "to stop"; *"to halt the end"* is to desire to stop it from ending. *"Deluded by calculations"* means being misled by the reckonings of longevity and brevity. Spirit belongs to heaven; bones and flesh belong to earth. *"Perfect enlightenment"* refers to the doctrine of the four great elements. *"Portion"* means "that which is allotted." *"Enters its gate"* means returning to the place from which it originally emerged. *"Returns to its root"* means returning to the place where it originally began. Once spirit and bones have each reverted to their origins, where then does the present "I" remain? This is what the *Perfect Enlightenment Sutra* means when it asks: *"Where now does my dharma-body abide?"*

Master Zhu Xi’s claim that the Buddhists plagiarized this idea is, I fear, unfounded. Since ancient times, there has naturally existed such discourse in the world—Yuan Rang was a figure of this kind. The Buddha emerged from the West; how could he have plagiarized this? To denounce it so severely is unjust.

From birth to death, the great transformations of human life unfold in four stages: infancy, youth and prime, old age, and death.

In infancy, qi is concentrated and the will is unified—harmony reaches its utmost. Nothing harms it, and no virtue surpasses it. In youth and prime, blood and qi surge and overflow, desires and thoughts arise in abundance. External things assail it, and virtue thus declines. In old age, desires and thoughts soften, the body prepares to rest, and nothing takes precedence. Though it does not yet match the wholeness of infancy, it surpasses the state of youth and prime. In death, one comes to rest, returning to the ultimate.

Before blood and qi settle, and after their vigor has waned, the sage divides life into three segments, while here it is divided into four. *Zhuangzi* says: *"The great clod burdens me with form, labors me with life, eases me with old age, and rests me with death."* This, too, divides life into four segments.

Laozi’s depiction of the harmony of infancy is most apt. The surging of blood and qi is what the sage calls "vigorous prime." The rise of desires and thoughts is the labor of life. To desire wealth and honor is desire; to scheme ahead and calculate behind is thought. When these fill and arise uncontrollably, external things assail the heart, and the harmony and virtue of infancy wane. In old age, though desires and thoughts remain, one can no longer exert oneself. *Zhuangzi* calls this "eased by old age," while here it is termed "the body preparing to rest"—the meaning is the same, though the words differ. *"Nothing takes precedence"* means one cannot compete with external things. Naturally receding, though not yet equal to infancy’s state of harming nothing, it is already far removed from the days of youth and prime, when things assailed it. When form and qi are exhausted, one returns to their source—this is what *Zhuangzi* means by *"rests me with death."* *"Ultimate"* refers to the extremity of the Great Ultimate, the beginning of all transformations of form, as previously mentioned.

Confucius once traveled on Mount Tai and saw Rong Qigi walking in the wilds of Cheng, clad in a deerskin robe with a rope belt, playing the zither and singing. Confucius asked him: *"What is the source of your joy, sir?"* He replied: *"My joys are many. Heaven gives birth to the myriad things, and man is the most noble—this is my first joy. Among men, the male is honored and the female is lowly, and I have been born a man—this is my second joy. Some do not live to see the sun and moon, never leaving swaddling clothes, but I have already reached ninety years—this is my third joy. Poverty is the constant lot of the scholar, and death is the end of all men. Abiding in constancy and meeting one’s end—what is there to grieve?"* Confucius said: *"Excellent! He knows how to console himself."* Rong was his surname, Qigi his given name. He wore a deerskin robe and a rope belt. Of heaven and earth’s nature, man is most noble among things. Among humankind, the male is more honored than the female. The three joys are a discourse close to human sentiment. This passage instructs on the principles of poverty, wealth, life, and death, and thus presents such a parable. One who can console himself does so not by insight into the Dao but by reasoning through the patterns of things to find ease. Du Fu’s poem—*"On the riverbank, a small hall where kingfishers nest; by the fields, a high tomb where qilin stand. Carefully pondering the patterns of things, one must seek joy—why let floating fame bind this body?"*—captures the meaning of this passage.

Lin Lei was nearly a hundred years old. In late spring, he donned a fur robe, gleaned fallen grain from old fields, and walked while singing. Confucius, passing through Wei, saw him in the wilds and said to his disciples: *"That old man may be worth speaking to. Go and inquire."* Zigong volunteered and met him at the edge of the ridge. Facing him, he sighed and said: *"Sir, do you have no regrets, walking and singing while gleaning grain?"* Lin Lei continued without pause, neither stopping his song nor his steps. Zigong pressed him repeatedly, until at last he looked up and replied: *"What should I regret?"* Zigong said: *"In your youth, you did not cultivate conduct; in your prime, you did not strive for success; in old age, you have no wife or children, and death approaches—what joy is there in gleaning grain and singing as you walk?"* Lin Lei laughed and said: *"The source of my joy is something all men possess, yet they turn it into sorrow. In youth, I did not cultivate conduct; in my prime, I did not strive for success—thus I have lived so long. In old age, I have no wife or children, and death approaches—thus I can be so joyful."* Zigong said: *"Longevity is what men desire; death is what they detest. Why do you find joy in death?"* Lin Lei said: *"Death and life are but a going and a returning. Thus, one who dies here—how do we know they are not born there? So I know they are not the same, and how do I know that busily striving for life is not delusion? How do I know that my death now is not better than my past life?"* Zigong did not grasp his meaning and returned to report to the Master. The Master said: *"I knew he was worth speaking to—indeed, so! Yet what he has attained is not yet complete."*

*"Late spring"* refers to the season. *"Walking while singing"* means singing as he went. *"In youth, he did not cultivate conduct"* means he did not study and left no reputation among men. *"In his prime, he did not strive for success"* means he did not contend for fame or profit in the world. Zigong mocked him for this, but Lin Lei took it as the reason for his longevity: had he labored body and mind to vie for external fame and profit, he would have died young. Zigong and Lin Lei are parabolic figures. *"Death and life are but a going and a returning"* means that from life to death, it is like a journey that must return. *"One who dies here—how do we know they are not born there?"* This is akin to the Buddhist teaching of present and future lives, past and future selves. *"I know they are not the same"* means how do we know this life is not better than the next, or the future self not better than the past?

The death of today surpasses not the life of yesterday—this aligns with *Zhuangzi*’s teaching of the feeble mourner who knows not the return. *"One who attains it yet does not exhaust it"* means he grasps the principle of life and death but has not plumbed its subtleties.

The *Liezi* reveres Confucius throughout its text, thus often borrowing his name in its parables—though whether this truly originates from Liezi remains unknown. Zilu, weary of study, said to Zhongni: *"I wish to rest."* Zhongni replied: *"In life, there is no rest."* Zilu asked: *"Then shall I, Si, have no place to rest?"* Zhongni said: *"You shall. Behold the grave mound—lofty as a tower, smooth as a stewpot, swelling as a burial mound, bulging as a tripod. There you will know your rest."* Zilu exclaimed: *"Death is vast indeed! The noble man finds repose there; the petty man is subdued there."*

Zhongni said: *"Si, you have understood. Men all know the joy of life but not its suffering; they know the weariness of age but not its ease; they know the dread of death but not its rest."* One weary of study has studied without grasping its essence. Having wearied the mind for so long, weariness naturally arises. *"Rest"* means cessation. *"I see his advance, but never his halt"*—this is the case. Zilu, weary of study, sought a place to cease, and the Master thus told him that *"in life, there is no rest."*

Here, *Liezi* borrows the names of sages and the discourse on advance and cessation to clarify the principle of life and death. *"In life, there is no rest"* means that as long as form exists, life must labor. When can one rest? Only in death is rest possible. Zilu, not yet enlightened, pressed further with his question of whether rest had no place, and the Master answered with the matter of graves and mounds. *"Lofty as a tower, smooth as a stewpot, swelling as a burial mound, bulging as a tripod"*—all describe their rising forms. The noble man finds his own rest there; though the petty man’s heart clings without cease, even he cannot but submit when he reaches this.

Though this passage was composed for those who cling to life and dread death, the Chan school later spoke of "dying to the heart" and of "the dead man who yet lives"—here lies a profound meaning, not merely concerning life and death.

Master Yan said: *"How excellent, the death of the ancients!"* The virtuous find rest therein; the unvirtuous submit. Death is the culmination of power. The ancients called the dead *"those who return."* If the dead are called *"those who return,"* then the living are *"those who journey."* To journey without knowing return is to lose one’s home. One man loses his home, and the world condemns him; when the whole world loses its home, none know to condemn it.

There are those who leave their native land, abandon their six relations, forsake their family estate, and wander the four directions without returning—what manner of men are these? The world must call them reckless and dissolute. And there are those who prize worldly eminence, boast of their skills, cultivate fame, and vaunt themselves before the world without self-knowledge—what manner of men are these? The world must deem them wise and cunning. Both are lost, yet the world approves one and rejects the other. Only the sage knows whom to approve and whom to reject.

The virtuous and the unvirtuous are but the noble man and the petty man. *"Culmination"* means return—virtue is only settled in death, which is the meaning of *"returning to the root and reverting to the real."* Thus, the great matter of life and death is used to illustrate this.

*"Losing one’s home"* is the discourse on weakness and loss. *"Prize"* means to value; *"eminence"* refers to form; *"worldly"* refers to life. These three characters are all corrupted by phonetic transmission—it should read *"valuing form and life."* To value form and life is to hold the body as precious. The world deems recklessness wrong, so it rejects such men and instead embraces the wise and cunning, not realizing that wisdom and cunning are also wrong. The sage’s approval and rejection are guided by the Dao, hence it is said: *"know whom to approve and whom to reject."*

Someone asked Liezi: *"Why do you value emptiness?"* Liezi replied: *"Emptiness has no value."* To value emptiness is to esteem it; *"has no value"* means that even the esteem for emptiness is absent—what then is there to esteem?

Liezi said: *"It is not the name. Nothing knows stillness like emptiness."* Stillness and emptiness find their proper place; grasping and giving lose theirs.

When affairs shatter the uncarved block and give rise to the performance of benevolence and righteousness, they cannot be restored. What is not its true name—this means that once a name exists, it is no longer the true name. As the *Laozi* says: *"That which can be named is not the constant name."* To speak of emptiness and stillness is to leave no trace, and thus no name. Without name or trace, one finds their proper place; but the moment there is grasping and giving, distinction and division, one loses it.

The great Dao is broken into fragments, and only then do the names of benevolence and righteousness arise. *"Shattering the uncarved block"* means fragmentation—this describes how the scholars of today, having shattered the great Dao, take the seven virtues as their playthings, so that the wind of true purity and simplicity can never return. *"Performing benevolence and righteousness"* is like what people today call *"manipulating texts and toying with laws."*

Zhou Xiong said: *"The turning never ceases; heaven and earth shift imperceptibly—who notices?"* Thus, what is diminished in one place is filled in another; what is completed here is lost there. Loss and gain, completion and depletion follow the world and follow death. Coming and going connect without pause, with no gap to perceive—who notices? For qi does not advance all at once, nor does form deplete in an instant; one does not sense its completion, nor its depletion. It is like a person from youth to old age—appearance, complexion, wisdom, and bearing change day by day, yet skin, nails, and hair fall away with the passing world, no different from infancy when there was no pause in change. The interval is imperceptible; only afterward does one know.

Zhou Xiong is the borrowed name of an ancient worthy. Between heaven and earth, the turning never ceases. Heaven completes one revolution each day; earth moves in fourfold ascent and descent, never pausing for a single breath. Yet humans dwell within it unaware, like one sitting in a boat—though the boat moves, the passenger does not know. Who can perceive the shifting of heaven and earth? *"Imperceptible"* means it cannot be seen. Things diminish and fill, complete and deplete—all proceed imperceptibly between heaven and earth, and none notice. Life and death come and go in endless cycles, connected without interruption, with no gap to perceive.

Rivers form through the passage of water; their currents flow ceaselessly away. Generations form through the passage of people; their lives drift slowly toward dusk. What person does not renew with the age? What age can remain unchanged by people? This is precisely the meaning.

*"Following the world"* means following life. Cold and heat come and go gradually, so it is said: *"qi does not advance all at once."* High banks become valleys, deep valleys become hills—even the smallest thing or vessel depletes gradually, so it is said: *"form does not deplete in an instant."* Only because it is not sudden does one fail to notice. *"Not sudden"* means not abrupt. The same is true of a person from youth to old age—there is no visible gap, and one only knows when the time arrives. Thus it is said: *"The interval is imperceptible; only afterward does one know."*

*"Bearing"* refers to physical form; *"wisdom"* refers to one’s views. In the state of Qi, there was a man who worried that heaven and earth would collapse, leaving him nowhere to dwell, and so he abandoned sleep and food. Another, concerned for his worry, went to enlighten him, saying: *"Heaven is but accumulated qi—there is no place without qi. You bend and stretch, breathe and move, spending all day within it. Why fear collapse?"* The man replied: *"If heaven is but accumulated qi, should not the sun, moon, and stars fall?"* The enlightener said: *"The sun, moon, and stars are merely luminous accumulations within qi. Even if they fell, they could do no harm."* The man asked: *"What of the earth’s ruin?"* The enlightener replied: *"Earth is but accumulated clods, filling the four directions. There is no place without clods. You tread and step, spending all day upon it. Why fear its ruin?"* The man was suddenly at ease and overjoyed. The enlightener, too, was suddenly at ease and overjoyed.

Changluzi heard this and laughed, saying: *"The rainbow and the secondary bow, clouds and mist, wind and rain, the four seasons—these are the forms taken by accumulated qi in the heavens. Mountains and peaks, rivers and seas, metals and stones, water and fire—these are the forms taken by accumulated matter on the earth. Knowing that they are but accumulated qi and accumulated clods, how can one say they will not perish? The heavens and earth are but a tiny thing within the void, the greatest of all things within the bounded. That they are hard to exhaust, hard to fathom—this is certainly so. That they are hard to measure, hard to comprehend—this is certainly so. To worry over their ruin is indeed too distant a concern; to say they will not ruin is also incorrect. The heavens and earth cannot but perish, and when they do, they will return to ruin. When their time of ruin comes, how can one not worry?*

Liezi heard this and laughed, saying: *"To say the heavens and earth will perish is also mistaken; to say they will not perish is also mistaken. Whether they perish or not, I cannot know. Nevertheless, that is one state, this is another. Thus, the living do not know death, the dead do not know life; the coming do not know the going, the going do not know the coming. Whether they perish or not, why should I trouble my heart over it? Bending and stretching, breathing and moving, one harmonizes with the qi in the heavens—thus, man is also a natural part of accumulated qi. The light of the sun, moon, and stars also arises from this qi. 'Only if' means 'but if' or 'even if.' 'The four voids' refers to the space beyond the four directions. 'Hesitant steps' means to linger. 'Treading and trampling' means to walk upon. This says that aside from the great void, all within is accumulated clods. How can one say they will not perish? For what accumulates must also disperse—how can it not perish? The meaning of this passage is that the heavens are originally accumulated qi, the earth originally accumulated clods, and thus they must have a time of ruin. Therefore, these words are set forth to describe it. The *Book of Changes* says: 'If Qian and Kun perish, the Dao cannot be seen.' The sages also had this idea, though they did not speak of it. Within the great void, formless and boundless, the heavens and earth are but a tiny thing. Yet from man’s perspective, seeing things as substantial, they appear the greatest within the bounded. These two lines are also well put. 'Hard to exhaust, hard to fathom; hard to measure, hard to comprehend'—this means they cannot be known by man. The final turn, however, says: 'The coming do not know the going, the going do not know the coming.' This is to say that those who study the Dao should not trouble their hearts over being and non-being, going and coming. Today’s Chan school emerges from this. The later turn: Shun asked Zheng, 'Can the Dao be possessed?' Zheng said, 'Your body is not your own—how can you possess the Dao?' Shun said, 'If my body is not my own, then whose is it?' Zheng said, 'It is the form entrusted by heaven and earth. Life is not your own—it is the harmony entrusted by heaven and earth. Nature and destiny are not your own—they are the compliance entrusted by heaven and earth. Children and grandchildren are not your own—they are the shedding entrusted by heaven and earth. Thus, when you walk, you do not know where you go; when you dwell, you do not know what you hold; when you eat, you do not know why. Heaven and earth are the forceful yang—qi. How can they be possessed?' 'Entrusted' means gathered. The four great elements temporarily combine to form this body, thus it is called 'entrusted form.' Yin and yang harmonize to give birth to the myriad things, thus life is called 'entrusted harmony.' Compliance with principle—nature and destiny are within me, yet they are the principle of creation, thus called 'entrusted compliance.' Generations succeed one another like the molting of cicadas, thus children and grandchildren are called 'entrusted shedding.' 'Do not know what you hold' means having no attachment. 'Forceful yang qi' is the qi of life. The active is yang, and man’s walking, dwelling, and eating are all movements of this qi—none of it is one’s own. The *Perfect Enlightenment Sutra* says, 'Now this illusory body—where should it be?' This is the same idea. This passage is identical to the *Zhuangzi*’s 'Knowledge Wanders North' chapter."*

The character *zhēng* in the *Zhuangzi* is written as *chéng*—this must be a scribal error. Yet to call it *chéng* is also a figurative expression.

In Qi, the Guo clan was immensely wealthy; in Song, the Xiang clan was desperately poor. The Xiang traveled from Song to Qi to seek their method. The Guo said to them: "I am skilled in thievery. When I first began to steal, I had enough after one year, abundance after two, and great plenty after three. From then on, my bounty extended to the towns and villages."

The Xiang rejoiced greatly, understanding the words of thievery but not its Way. He then scaled walls and bored through houses, seizing whatever his hands and eyes could reach. Before long, he was caught with stolen goods and punished, his ancestral property confiscated.

The Xiang, believing the Guo had deceived him, went to reproach him. The Guo said: "How did you go about stealing?" The Xiang described what he had done. The Guo exclaimed: "Alas! Have you lost the Way of thievery to such an extent? Now I will tell you.

I have heard that Heaven has its seasons, Earth its advantages. I steal Heaven and Earth’s seasons and advantages—the soaking nourishment of clouds and rain, the products of mountains and marshes—to grow my grain, cultivate my crops, build my walls, and construct my dwellings. On land, I steal from the birds and beasts; in water, I steal from the fish and turtles—nothing is not stolen. Yet grain, crops, timber, birds, beasts, fish, and turtles are all born of Heaven. How can they be mine? Thus, though I steal from Heaven, I incur no misfortune.

Gold, jade, treasures, grain, silk, and wealth are what men accumulate—how can they be Heaven’s gifts? If you steal these and are punished, whom can you blame?"

The Xiang was deeply perplexed, thinking the Guo was further deceiving him. He encountered Master Dongguo and asked him about it. Master Dongguo said: "Is not your very body nothing but theft? You steal the harmony of yin and yang to form your life and sustain your body—how much more so with external things? Are they not also theft?

Truly, Heaven and Earth and the myriad things do not exist apart from one another. To measure and claim them as one’s own is delusion. The Guo’s theft is the public Way, thus he incurs no misfortune; your theft is private desire, thus you are punished. Whether public or private, both are theft. Whether without public or private, both are theft. Public and private are the virtue of Heaven and Earth.

One who knows the virtue of Heaven and Earth—what is theft? What is not theft? *Wei ji shi* means not yet able to reckon the seasons. *Xian ju* refers to the property accumulated by previous generations. *Miu ji* means to deceive oneself. *Wang er yuan zhi* means to go and reproach him.

The seasons and advantages are Heaven’s timing and Earth’s benefits. *Pang run* means soaking moisture. Grain, crops, timber, birds, beasts, fish, and turtles are all external things born of Heaven—even the yin and yang of one’s body, how can they be one’s own? They too are made by Heaven and Earth.

*Cheng* means truly so. That Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things do not exist apart means that all things arise from Heaven and Earth, and not one can be separated from them. *Ren* is the same as *ren* (to recognize)—to claim them as one’s own is the delusion of folly.

The meaning of this chapter is that man exists between Heaven and Earth, all stealing from what belongs to Heaven and Earth to sustain his life. Thus, it is expressed in such terms, forming a heterodox teaching. From Heaven’s seasons and Earth’s advantages to birds, beasts, fish, and turtles—all belong to Heaven and Earth, and man steals and uses them. The sage says: "Use Heaven’s Way, divide Earth’s benefits." The *Liezi* here embellishes its words. Liu Zihou’s *Tian Shuo* analogy also originates from this.

The final turn of thought is the same as the previous section. The public Way is what all men share; the private Way is not shared by all. In human judgment, there is public and private; in the virtue of Heaven and Earth, there is no public or private. What is public is so of itself, also made by Heaven and Earth; what is private is so of itself, also made by Heaven and Earth. Viewed from the virtue of Heaven and Earth, both theft and non-theft are matters of intention.

This meaning suggests that to love good and hate evil as if arising from intention is to make even good into evil. The *Laozi* says: "When all under Heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness is already present." This is precisely the same idea. Such passages do not seem to belong to the original *Liezi* text.

*The True Classic of Perfect Virtue, Yanzhai’s Oral Exegesis, Scroll Two*
By Yanzhai Lin Xiang

Emperor Huangdi, Scroll Two

In the fifteenth year of his reign, the Yellow Emperor rejoiced that all under Heaven bore him allegiance. He nurtured his proper destiny, delighted his ears and eyes, and gratified his nose and mouth. Yet his complexion grew sallow and dull, his flesh withered, and his five faculties dimmed in confusion.

Another fifteen years passed, and he grew anxious that all under Heaven remained untamed. He exhausted his wisdom and intelligence, exerted his strength of mind, and toiled for the common people. Again his complexion grew sallow and dull, his brows furrowed, and his five faculties dimmed in confusion.

Then the Yellow Emperor sighed deeply and exclaimed: "My excesses have gone too far! The harm of nurturing oneself alone is thus; the harm of governing the myriad things is thus."

Thereupon he relinquished all affairs of state, abandoned his palace chambers, dismissed his attendants, removed the bells and chimes, reduced his kitchen provisions, and withdrew to dwell in seclusion in the Hall of the Great Court. There he purified his heart and disciplined his form, abstaining from government matters for three months.

One day, as he slept, he dreamed of wandering in the land of Huaxu. The land of Huaxu lies west of Yan Prefecture and north of Tai Prefecture, countless thousands of miles from the state of Qi—so distant that no boat, carriage, or foot could reach it, and one could only journey there in spirit.

In that land, there were no rulers or leaders; all was spontaneous and self-so.

The people there had no cravings or desires; all was spontaneous and self-so.
They knew not the joy of life, nor the dread of death, and thus suffered no premature demise.
They knew not attachment to self, nor estrangement from others, and thus harbored no love or resentment.
They knew not defiance, nor compliance, and thus perceived no gain or loss.
All things were met without fondness or regret, without fear or taboo.
They entered water yet did not drown; entered fire yet did not burn.
Strikes and blows brought no pain; pricks and prods caused no itch or ache.
They tread upon emptiness as if walking on solid ground, and slept in the void as if resting in a forest.
Clouds and mist did not obstruct their sight—obstruction and clarity were one to their eyes.
Thunder and lightning did not disturb their hearing; beauty and ugliness did not unsettle their hearts.
Mountains and valleys did not hinder their steps; their movement was but spirit alone.

When the Yellow Emperor awoke, he felt a profound contentment. He summoned Tian Lao, Li Mu, and Tai Shan Ji, and addressed them, saying: "For three months I have dwelt in seclusion, purifying my heart and disciplining my form, seeking the Dao of nurturing the self and ordering the world, yet I found no method. Exhausted, I slept, and dreamed thus. Now I know the supreme Dao cannot be sought through human sentiment."

I have come to know it, I have attained it, yet I cannot convey it to you.

Twenty-eight years later, the realm knew great peace, nearly resembling the land of Huaxu, and the Emperor ascended in transcendence. The people mourned him for over two hundred years without cease.

This speaks of the land of Huaxu as sharing the same intent as the land of established virtue in the *Zhuangzi*’s "Mountain Trees" chapter. It describes how the Yellow Emperor’s governance of the world began with intention and ended in non-intention, began with action and ended in non-action.

*Zhengming* refers to the nature of life—taking nature as the norm, though the pronunciation is corrupted. *"Jiran"* describes his skin as parched and darkened, emaciated. *"Hunran"* speaks of his five emotions in disarray, bewildered and dazed. The five emotions are joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, and desire. *"Zan"* means to join in sighing. *"Yin yi"* suggests excess like water spreading unchecked; commentators take *yin* as meaning "profound." *"Zhi shi"* refers to attendants or servants. *"Xuan"* is a bell rack. *"Dating"* is akin to the imperial palace. *"Fu xing"* is what modern people call "absorbing qi."

The *Huainanzi* states: due west lies Yan Province, and to the northwest lies Tai Province. This speaks of lands beyond the Nine Provinces, much as the Buddha speaks of the western lands beyond Jambudvīpa.

*"Si"* means separation. Qi State is the Central Land. *"Si Qi guo"* means a distance of ten thousand *li* from the Central Land. *"Ziran"* means non-intention. *"No favor or aversion, no compliance or defiance"* describes a heart without attachment or rejection. *"Entering water without drowning, entering fire without burning"* means no circumstance fails to bring self-possession. *"Striking without pain, prodding without itching"* means that though he had form, it was as if he had none. *"Obstruction and clarity were one."* *"Shen xing"* means his movement left no trace.

Tian Lao, Li Mu, and Tai Shan Ji were three ministers of the Yellow Emperor. *"Deng jia"* means "ascending in transcendence"; *jia* should be read as *xia*. The *Zhuangzi* contains many such ideas. Some say that in comparing *Liezi* to *Zhuangzi*, the former surpasses the latter—though this may not be so.

The Mount Lieguye rises amidst the seas and rivers. Upon its summit dwells a divine being who inhales the wind and drinks the dew, partaking not of the five grains. Her heart is like a deep spring, her form like a maiden’s. She clings not, nor does she cherish; immortals and sages serve as her ministers. She knows no fear, nor does she rage; the guileless and sincere act as her envoys. She bestows no favors, yet all things are self-sufficient; she gathers nothing, yet she herself lacks nothing. Yin and yang remain ever in harmony, sun and moon ever bright. The four seasons proceed in constant order, wind and rain in perfect balance. Birth and nurture occur in due season, the harvest ever abundant. The land suffers no pestilence, the people no premature death or misfortune. Creatures bear no blemish or disease, and ghosts emit no uncanny resonance.

This passage shares much in spirit with the *Zhuangzi*, depicting only the governance of non-action. *"Her heart like a deep spring"* means it is like still water. *"She clings not"* means she does not bend or twist, akin to *"she cherishes not."* *"She knows no fear, nor does she rage"* describes her harmony. *"She bestows no favors"* means she gives nothing. *"She gathers nothing"* means she takes nothing. Since all things are self-sufficient, she herself lacks nothing. *"Lacks"* means deficiency. *"Birth and nurture"* refers to the procreation of birds and beasts. *"Pestilence"* means epidemic illness. *"Creatures bear no blemish or disease"* means they suffer no affliction. *"Ghosts emit no uncanny resonance"* means there is no strange or eerie phenomenon. All spectral anomalies and omens are the mischief of ghosts. This aligns with the *"Free and Easy Wandering"* chapter of the *Zhuangzi*.

Liezi studied under Master Lao Shang and befriended Bo Gaozi. Having mastered the Way of these two, he rode the wind home. Yin Sheng, hearing of this, followed Liezi and dwelled with him for months without returning to his lodging. Seizing an opportunity, he entreated Liezi ten times for his teachings, yet ten times Liezi refused to instruct him. Yin Sheng, aggrieved, sought to depart, but Liezi gave no command. Yin Sheng withdrew.

Months later, his resolve unbroken, he returned to follow Liezi again. Liezi asked, *"Why do you come and go so frequently?"* Yin Sheng replied, *"Before, I, Zhang Dai, made requests of you, but you would not teach me, leaving me resentful. Now, once more, I find myself thus—hence my return."* Liezi said, *"Formerly, I took you for one of understanding, but now your vulgarity has reached this point? Very well, I shall tell you what I learned from my master. Since I began serving my master and befriending such men, after three years, my heart dared not entertain right or wrong, my mouth dared not speak of profit or harm. Only then did my master deign to glance at me. After five years, my heart reversed its thoughts of right and wrong, my mouth reversed its words of profit and harm. Only then did my master begin to relax his countenance and smile. After seven years, I followed my heart’s inclinations, yet it harbored no right or wrong; I followed my mouth’s utterances, yet it spoke no profit or harm. Only then did my master draw me to sit beside him on the same mat. After nine years, whether my heart wandered or my mouth spoke, I knew not whether my own right and wrong, profit and harm existed, nor whether those of others did. I knew not whether my master was my teacher or those men my friends. Within and without, all had advanced. Thereafter, my eyes were as ears, my ears as nose, my nose as mouth—all were the same. My heart congealed, my form dissolved, flesh and bone fused as one. I no longer sensed the body’s support or the feet’s tread, drifting east and west with the wind like a withered leaf or dry husk. Did the wind ride me, or did I ride the wind? I knew not.*

*Now, you have barely spent a full cycle in your master’s presence, yet your resentment and grievance arise again and again. Your body in its parts will not be borne by qi, your limbs in their joints will not be supported by the earth. To tread the void and ride the wind—how could this be within your reach?"*

Yin Sheng, deeply ashamed, held his breath for a long while and dared not speak again. *"Did not return to his lodging"* means he did not go home. *"Aggrieved"* means resentful. Having entreated ten times without instruction, he wished to depart. *"Gave no command for his withdrawal"* meant allowing him to leave of his own accord. *"Returned to follow him"* means he left and then came back.

Chapter Dai—such was Yin Sheng’s given name. *Ji* sounds like *ju*, a phonetic corruption. *The Master* refers to Lao Shang. *That man* refers to Bo Gaozi.

For three years, his mind harbored no thoughts of right or wrong, his mouth uttered no words of right or wrong—thus did he maintain stillness and silence, fearing even self-movement. *Geng* means "to change" or "to turn toward." Having abandoned thoughts of right and wrong, gain and loss, and cut off speech of right and wrong, gain and loss, should such thoughts arise again, his mind, now settled, would issue nothing but what is correct.

*Following* means compliance: whatever he thought or spoke arose naturally, without deliberate engagement in right or wrong, gain or loss. Thus, mind and principle became one, no longer subject to choice. *Unrestrained* means "free": thoughts arose without deliberation, words flowed without constraint—whether spoken vertically or horizontally, all was permissible. Freed and unshackled, no longer aware of right or wrong, gain or loss, the mind merged with principle and forgot it.

These four stages mark the successive steps in the work of Daoist cultivation. Once the inner self has merged with principle, then in movement and repose, every gesture and turn is likewise transformed. Thus it is said: "inner and outer advance together." When even the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth become indistinguishable, this is the moment of transformation and forgetting. The Buddhists call this "the six senses arising from one source"—the same idea.

*Gan* means "body." *Gan-ke* refers to the cast-off shell of a cicada. "Withered leaf or dry husk" describes one who no longer perceives his own body. Only after forgetting the body can one ride the wind. Your resentment and grievance are such that the burden of body and mind remains unforgotten—how then could heaven and earth bear even a fragment of your body, let alone its entirety? This chapter thus declares that the art of riding the wind requires one to regard the body as nothing before it can be achieved. This is no empty claim; only those who cultivate the Dao know these words to be true.

Liezi asked Guan Yin: "The perfected person walks through emptiness without sinking, treads fire without burning, moves above the myriad things without trembling. How may one attain this?" Guan Yin replied: "It is the preservation of pure qi, not a matter of cunning, skill, or bold resolve."

*Ji* is pronounced like *yu* in *yu-nü* ("fish" and "woman"). Whatever has form, sound, or color is a thing—how can things differ so greatly from one another? Why should one strive to surpass the ancients? It is but a matter of appearance. Thus, things are created from the formless and come to rest where transformation ceases. Those who attain this and exhaust its depths—how could they be led astray?

They dwell in measureless depth, conceal themselves in traceless order, and wander through the beginning and end of the myriad things. They unify their nature, nurture their qi, embrace their virtue, and thereby commune with the source of all things. Such as these preserve the wholeness of heaven, their spirit without flaw—how could things intrude upon them?

Guan Yin, named Xi, was one who met Laozi. These words are not transmitted sayings of master and disciple but rather teachings attributed to him. Guan Yinzi has his own book; though later hands have adulterated it, its most profound passages surpass those of other masters.

"Walking through emptiness without sinking" means moving through the void as if on solid ground. "Above the myriad things" describes its loftiness. The preservation of pure qi—modern practitioners of life-nurturing arts do likewise: one guards it with a mind devoid of intention, for it is not attainable through cunning, skill, or bold resolve. The *Zhuangzi*’s "Attaining Life" chapter contains similar words. This is a transmitted teaching of one lineage, a single great thread running through it all.

Ji means "to dwell"; Yu is "I," a corruption of its sound. Appearance, voice, and color are things with form. If one remains confined within the realm of the formed, how can one transcend? Only by being without mind does one rise above the myriad things.

The "prior" refers to the beginning of creation. How can one reach the prior? To say one is bound by form is to say one cannot know the beginning of creation. The earlier passage spoke of appearance, image, voice, and color—here it mentions only color. Among four words, one is singled out: such is the method of composition.

"Not-formed" refers to what precedes the emergence of qi. "Without transformation" refers to the unmanifest beginning of creation. "Creation" is that from which things arise. "To rest" means to abide. If one does not grasp the wonder of the not-formed and the untransformed but merely exhausts what is obtained from things, how can one attain the most profound insight? "Upright" means the utmost extreme.

"Without depth of measure" means it lies right before one, so shallow and near that people fail to see it. "Without end" means without beginning. "Measure" is method; "thread" is coherence. This is the method before one’s eyes, yet its origin is unknown—concealed and unrecognized, like the Master who took me for one who hides.

The beginning and end of the myriad things, that from which things are created, all belong to creation. Unifying one’s nature, nurturing one’s qi, and containing one’s virtue—this is nothing but pure unity and stillness. In terms of principle, it is nature; in terms of life, it is qi; in terms of what is obtained within oneself, it is virtue. "Its heavenly guard is complete" means its purity is undisturbed. "Without retreat or gap" means stability. When pure and stable, external things cannot move it. Thus it is said: how could things intrude?

When a drunkard falls from a carriage, though the fall be swift, he does not die. His bones and joints are the same as others’, yet the harm he suffers differs, for his spirit is whole. He is unaware of riding, unaware of falling. Life and death, alarm and fear do not enter his breast; thus he encounters things without dread. If one preserved in wine can be thus, how much more so one preserved in Heaven? The sage hides in Heaven, and so nothing can harm him.

These several lines echo the *Zhuangzi*. "Suffering harm" refers to the fall. Both riding and falling occur in drunkenness, without awareness or fear, so the spirit remains whole. Only because the spirit is whole, though injury may occur, it does not lead to death. "Encountering things" means not being obstructed by them. "Without dread" means without fear. "Hiding in Heaven" means being without mind and forgetting oneself. Thus is the analogy made. These lines are most precise.

Lie Yukou shot for Bo Hun Wu Ren, drawing the bow to full draw and placing a cup of water on his elbow. He loosed the arrow, and as one shaft followed another, each arrow found its place upon the string. In that moment, he was like a wooden figure.

Bo Hun Wu Ren said: "This is the shooting of one who shoots, not the shooting of one who does not shoot. Suppose I take you to climb a high mountain, tread upon perilous stones, and stand above an abyss of a hundred fathoms—could you shoot then?"

Thereupon, Wu Ren ascended the high mountain, trod upon perilous stones, and stood above the abyss of a hundred fathoms. Turning his back, he retreated hesitantly, with two-thirds of his feet hanging over the edge. He beckoned Yukou to advance. Yukou prostrated himself upon the ground, sweat streaming down to his heels.

Bo Hun Wu Ren said: "The perfected person gazes upward into the azure sky, plunges downward into the Yellow Springs, and roams to the eight limits, yet his spirit and qi remain unchanged. Now you, trembling and with eyes darting in alarm—you are far from the center indeed."

This passage is entirely the same as that in the *Zhuangzi*'s "Tian Zifang" chapter. "Drawing the bow to full draw" means drawing the bow to its fullest. The front hand is straight and level, allowing a cup of water to be placed upon the elbow—this speaks of steadiness. "Loosed" means shot. "Followed" means gone. "Repeated" means again. As one arrow departs, another is already on the string. The arrows on the string follow one after another, so that as one leaves, another is already in place—this describes the swiftness of his skill. "Wooden figure" refers to a wooden puppet. "Turning his back hesitantly" means facing the high mountain while his back overlooks the deep abyss, retreating yet not stopping—hence "hesitantly." With one-third of his feet on the ledge and two-thirds hanging over the void, this was peril in the extreme, yet Bo Hun could do it—this is what is meant by "guarding the pure qi."

Shooting while standing on level ground is ordinary shooting, hence he said: "This is not the shooting of one who does not shoot." If the spirit can guard the One, then though one gazes upward into the azure sky or plunges downward into the Yellow Springs, roaming to the eight limits, the heart remains unmoved. If, in the face of danger or ease, you still tremble and your eyes dart in alarm, then you have not yet grasped the learning of the perfected person. To seek the essence of hitting the mark with such shooting is indeed difficult. Thus he said: "You are far from the center indeed."

"Startled" means fearful. "Darting" means moving. "Darting eyes" means moving eyes. "Far from the center" means difficult. The Fan clan had a son named Zihua who was skilled at cultivating a private reputation. The entire state admired him. Favored by the lord of Jin, he held no office yet ranked above the three ministers. Whatever he glanced at, the state of Jin ennobled; whatever he spoke ill of, the state of Jin demoted. Those who frequented his courtyard were promoted at court.

Zihua sent his knights to attack one another with cunning and stupidity, strength and weakness. Though they were wounded before him, he paid no heed. Day and night, he made this his sport and amusement, until it nearly became the custom of the state.

He Sheng and Zi Bo, the foremost guests of the Fan clan, went on a journey. Passing through the fields, they lodged at the house of Tian Geng, Shang Qiu Kai. In the middle of the night, He Sheng and Zi Bo spoke to each other of Zihua’s fame and power, how he could make the living perish and the dead live, the rich poor and the poor rich.

Shang Qiu Kai, who had long suffered from hunger and cold, secretly listened from behind the north window. Thereupon, he borrowed grain and carried a basket to Zihua’s gate. Zihua’s disciples were all from noble families. Clad in white silk and riding in carriages, they strolled with leisurely steps and haughty gazes. Seeing Shang Qiu Kai—old, weak, with a soot-blackened face and unkempt clothes—they all sneered. Soon they grew familiar, mocking and deceiving him, pushing and shoving, leaning and pressing, doing whatever they pleased. Shang Qiu Kai never showed anger, and the guests’ tricks were simple, wearying them of their sport.

Then they took Shang Qiu Kai to a high terrace and, before the crowd, casually said: "Whoever can throw themselves down will be rewarded with a hundred gold pieces." The crowd all vied to respond. Shang Qiu Kai, taking them at their word, threw himself down first. His form was like a flying bird, alighting upon the ground—his bones nearly unharmed, as if made of stone.

The followers of the Fan clan thought this a mere coincidence and did not yet find it strange. Then they pointed to a secluded bend in the river and said: "There is a precious pearl in that water; you can retrieve it by swimming." Shang Qiu Kai again followed and swam. When he emerged, he indeed held a pearl. The crowd began to doubt.

Zihua then ordered that Shang Qiu Kai be given meat to eat and silk to wear. Soon after, the Fan clan’s treasury caught fire. Zihua said: "Whoever can enter the fire and retrieve the brocade will be rewarded according to what they bring out." Shang Qiu Kai went without hesitation, entering and exiting the fire. No dust clung to him, and his body was not scorched.

The followers of the Fan clan, believing him to possess the Dao, together apologized to him, saying: "We did not know you possessed the Dao and deceived you; we did not know you were a spirit-person and humiliated you. You must think us fools, deaf, blind. We dare ask: what is your Dao?"

Shang Qiu Kai said: "I possess no Dao. Even my own heart does not know the reason. Nevertheless, there is one thing—let me try to speak of it to you."

When those two guests of yours previously lodged at my dwelling, I heard them praise the power of the Fan clan, claiming it could make the living perish and the dead live, the rich poor and the poor rich. I believed them wholeheartedly and came without hesitation. Upon arrival, I took your followers’ words as truth, fearing only that my belief was not sincere enough, my actions not swift enough. I knew not where to place my body or where profit and harm lay. My heart was unified, and the myriad things posed no obstacle—it was as simple as this.

Now that I know your followers deceived me, I harbor suspicion within and display caution without, seeking only to preserve my past good fortune in escaping unscorched and undrowned. Yet my heart burns with shame, and I tremble with fear. How could I ever again approach fire or water?

From then on, the disciples of the Fan clan, upon encountering beggars or horse-doctors on the road, dared not insult them but would alight from their carriages to bow. Zai Wo heard of this and reported it to Confucius. Confucius said: "Did you not know?"

The man of utmost sincerity can move all things—stirring heaven and earth, moving ghosts and spirits, traversing the six directions without resistance. How could this apply merely to treading perilous paths or entering fire and water? If even Shang Qiu Kai, believing in false things, met no resistance, how much more so when both self and other are sincere? Remember this well. This passage depicts the word "sincerity" with utmost precision; grasp this meaning fully, and you may learn the Dao.

*Private name*: a personal appellation, called *private self* in Zhejiang.
*Mouth biased toward fat*: speaking ill and gnawing at others—people in Jin judged others’ likes and dislikes to promote or demote them.
*Wisdom and baseness*: wisdom and foolishness.
*Injury and harm*: contention causing damage.
The people of an entire state had made this their custom.
He Sheng, Zi Bo: names of two guests.
*Beyond the fields*: the wilderness.
*Field elder*: an old rustic.
*Three Elders, Five Elders*: all terms for the aged.
*Unkempt robes and caps*: torn and disordered attire.
*眲*: the meaning of disdain.
*挡, 扌必, 挨, 抌*: all four characters denote playful pushing and striking.
*Exhausted and weary*: the force of mockery spent.
*漫*: casual speech.
*Unscathed bones without stone*: no injury sustained.
*Swirling eddies*: where water forms whirlpools.
*昉*: to begin.
Began to let his fellow guests wear silk and eat meat.
*Dust and smoke could not blind*: dust and smoke could not confuse him.
*My sincerity without duality*: trust without doubt.
*Not knowing where to place the body*: forgetting oneself.
*Not knowing where profit and harm lie*: unaware of worldly dangers.
With the heart unified, no thing opposes the self.
Now that he knows the followers’ words were deceitful, inner suspicion arises, and outer perception is confused.
Recalling his past entry into fire and water, he counts himself lucky to have escaped unscorched and undrowned.
This means that when the heart is utterly pure, profit and harm, fortune and misfortune cannot move it; but if even a trace of calculation remains, it becomes difficult.
Zen has the phrase *leakage*—three excellent characters.
Even beggars and horse-doctors, if their hearts are sincere, may learn the Dao; thus, upon seeing them, one must alight from the carriage. This reflects the *Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment*’s teaching of not slighting beginners.
*Utmost sincerity*: the same as utmost integrity.
*Believing the false*: even when one believes another’s false words as true, it is still thus—how much more so when both are truly sincere?

During King Xuan of Zhou’s reign, the director of herds had a servant named Liang Yang who could raise wild birds and beasts. He fed them in the palace gardens, and even tigers, wolves, eagles, and ospreys became docile. Males and females gathered before him, breeding in groups; different species lived together without attacking or biting one another. The king, fearing the art would die with Liang Yang, ordered Mao Qiu Yuan to learn it. Liang Yang said: "I am but a lowly servant—what art could I teach you?" Fearing the king would suspect him of concealment, he offered a single word on his method of raising tigers.

All creatures with blood and qi rejoice when followed and rage when opposed—this is their nature. Yet how could joy and anger arise without cause? They are provoked by opposition. When feeding a tiger, one does not dare offer living prey, lest it be enraged by the killing; nor whole prey, lest it be enraged by the tearing. One times its hunger and satiety, understands its anger—though tigers and humans are different species, they fawn upon those who feed them, for this is following their nature. Thus, to kill them is to oppose it. How then could I dare oppose them to provoke anger? Yet neither do I follow them to elicit joy. For joy inevitably turns to anger, and anger inevitably returns to joy—both are immoderate.

Now, my heart holds neither opposition nor compliance, so birds and beasts regard me as one of their own. Thus, those that roam my garden do not long for high forests or open marshes; those that rest in my courtyard do not yearn for deep mountains or secluded valleys—this is the principle at work.

*Director of herds*: the official in charge of livestock.
*Servant*: his subordinate.
Fearing the art would not be passed down, the king had him teach Mao Qiu Yuan.
He speaks of raising tigers rather than other beasts, taking the greatest example.
One does not dare offer living or whole prey, lest the tiger’s anger arise.
Though tigers differ from humans, none fed by a man fail to fawn upon him, for he follows their nature.
These lines echo *Zhuangzi*’s "Human World" chapter.
*How could I oppose them to provoke anger? Neither do I follow them to elicit joy.*
*Joy inevitably turns to anger, anger inevitably returns to joy.*
These lines depict human nature and the principles of things with great precision.
*Immoderate*: neither accords with principle.
*Heart without opposition or compliance*: without intent.
Without intent, one can forget the self and merge with things. This passage merely elucidates the principle of *wu xin* (no-mind)—it is an excellent discourse.

Yan Hui asked Confucius: "I once crossed the deep rapids of Shang. The ferryman handled the boat as if by divine skill. I asked him: *Can one learn to steer a boat?* He said: *Yes. Those who can swim may be taught. Skilled swimmers learn quickly. But as for divers—never have I seen one who, without ever having seen a boat, could suddenly take up the oars.* I asked him further, but he did not answer. May I ask what this means?"

Confucius said: "As for medical texts, you and I have long studied their words, yet we have not grasped their essence—do you truly take this to be the Way? Those who can swim may be taught, for they are light upon the water. Skilled swimmers learn quickly, for they have forgotten the water. But as for divers—never having seen a boat yet suddenly taking up the oars—it is because they see the abyss as level ground, and a capsized boat as merely their carriage rolling back. Though ten thousand things may overturn or retreat before them, they cannot enter the dwelling of their heart—where could they go and not be at ease?

*Shangshen* is the name of the abyss. *You* refers to those who float. Skilled swimmers are practiced in floating. *Mo ren* are those who can dive. *Su* means to rise. *Yan* (medical texts) is akin to *yi* (sighing). To *play with their words* is to engage with their surface. *Essence* refers to their inner meaning. This speaks of one who has not deeply seen the Way. *Do you truly take this to be the Way?* *Er* means 'you'—do you take this to be the Way? To see only the outer form of the Way without perceiving its inner truth—is this truly the Way?

Those who are light upon the water may be taught, for they do not fear it. Those who have forgotten the water have practiced repeatedly and thus mastered it, for they are at home in it. But divers rise to take up the oars without learning, for they see water as level ground. Though ten thousand things may overturn or retreat before them, they remain unmoved in heart—where could they go and not find themselves at ease? This further expounds the principle. The heart is the dwelling of spirit and clarity; if nothing can enter its dwelling, then nothing can disturb it.

One who grasps with tiles is skillful; one who grasps with hooks is hesitant; one who grasps with gold is dull. The skill is the same, yet when one clings to externals, they weigh heavily upon the outside. All who weigh externals neglect the inner. These lines are identical to those in *Zhuangzi’s* "Attaining Life" chapter, though Zhuangzi uses *zhu* (to pour) where this uses *kou* (to cast). The words differ, but the meaning is the same. *Kou* means to throw. Zhuangzi speaks of *lightening the inner*, while this speaks of *neglecting the inner*. *Gong* means to grasp or clasp. Hooks are heavier than tiles, and gold heavier than hooks. The archer’s skill is fundamentally one in the heart, yet when one clings to externals, what is weighed lies outside, and the inner heart becomes obstructed, hesitant, and dull—though skilled, one becomes clumsy.

Confucius observed at Lüliang, where the waterfall plunged thirty *ren* and the frothing current stretched thirty *li*, a place where turtles, alligators, fish, and soft-shelled turtles could not swim. He saw a man swimming there and thought him in distress, seeking to drown himself. He sent his disciples to follow the current and rescue him. After several hundred paces, the man emerged, loosened his hair, and walked along singing as he swam through the shallows. Confucius followed and asked him: "The waterfall at Lüliang plunges thirty *ren*, and its frothing current stretches thirty *li*—a place where turtles, alligators, fish, and soft-shelled turtles cannot swim. When I saw you entering it, I thought you were in distress and wished to die, so I sent my disciples to follow the current and rescue you. Yet you emerged, loosened your hair, and walked along singing. I took you for a ghost, but upon closer look, you are a man. May I ask if there is a Way to tread water?"

The man said: "No, I have no Way. I begin with what is familiar, grow with my nature, and complete it with fate. I enter with the swirling current and emerge with the surging flow. I follow the water’s Way without imposing my own will—this is how I tread it."

Confucius said: "What do you mean by *beginning with what is familiar, growing with nature, and completing it with fate*?"

The man said: "I was born on the hills and am at ease on the hills—that is what is familiar. I grew up in the water and am at ease in the water—that is my nature. I do not know why I am so, yet I am so—that is fate."

*Lüliang* is a place name. *Xuan shui* refers to a waterfall. The frothing current stretches thirty *li*—it is vast. *Bing liu* means to follow the current to rescue him. *Cheng* means to receive or catch. *Tang xing* (as per the annotation) refers to the shallows beneath a dike. *Ji* (in *Zhuangzi’s* "Attaining Life" chapter) is written as *qi*, referring to the swirling vortex of water—*ji* is also a miswriting. *Gu* refers to the surging flow. *Entering and emerging* means rising and falling with the water. *Following the water’s Way without imposing one’s own will* means submitting to the water’s force without resistance.

When born on the hills, one is at ease on the hills; when raised in the water, one is at ease in the water—all is in accord with one’s natural disposition, without knowing why. Thus, the three terms *familiarity, nature,* and *fate* are initially without distinction; they are merely used in this way for the sake of composition. To forcibly seek meaning in the words *born* and *raised* would be a mistake. Mencius said: "To speak of nature is merely to speak of what is familiar." This is the same *familiarity*. Later, when Confucius traveled to Chu, he emerged from a forest and saw a hunchback catching cicadas as easily as if picking them up.

Confucius said: "You are skillful. Is there a Way to this?"

The man said: "I have a Way."

In the fifth or sixth month, he stacked pellets like pellets of clay. When he could stack two without them falling, he lost only a fraction; when he could stack three without them falling, he lost but one in ten; when he could stack five without them falling, he caught cicadas as easily as picking them up.

My stance is like a wooden stake firmly planted; my arm, holding the pole, is like a withered branch. Though heaven and earth are vast and the myriad things are many, I know only the cicada’s wings. I do not turn back, nor do I waver—if I do not allow the myriad things to distract me from the cicada’s wings, how could I fail?

Confucius turned to his disciples and said: "When the mind is undivided, it verges on the numinous." This must refer to the hunchbacked elder.

The elder said: "You, a scholar in Confucian robes—what do you know of such matters? First cultivate what you have, then you may speak further of higher things."

This passage is identical to the *Zhuangzi*’s "Attaining Life" chapter. *Bearing the cicada* means holding a pole to catch them. Stacking pellets at the tip of the pole, from two to five without them falling, shows how his concentration becomes spirit-like. Guo Xiang’s commentary on the *Zhuangzi* uses two instances of *stillness and scrutiny*, which is also apt. *A wooden stake firmly planted* refers to what is now called a wooden post. *Stake* is the post; *zhu* is the name of a tree; *ju* means fixed. It seems these three characters existed in ancient times. *Not turning back, not wavering* simply means unwavering focus. When catching cicadas, his body was as motionless as a wooden post, his arm like a withered branch. His mind was fixed solely on the cicada’s wings, unaware of anything else—this is the height of singular focus. *When the mind is undivided* means his intent is not divided. *Verging on the numinous* means concentration that becomes spirit-like. Though this uses a metaphor to discuss the preservation of pure *qi*, such skill truly exists in the world, even today—yet people treat it as mere technique, unaware of the Dao it embodies.

The hunchback is one whose back is bent. *Confucian robes* refer to the attire of scholars. "First cultivate what you have today, then you may speak further of higher things"—this suggests the profundity of the Way does not end here. *Speak further* means to discuss what lies beyond. The rest is the same as in the *Zhuangzi*. *Wang’er* in the original is written as *pellets* in the *Zhuangzi*. The character *doubt* in the original should be *concentration*, following the *Zhuangzi*.

There was a man by the sea who loved gulls. Every morning, he went to the shore and followed the gulls, and hundreds of gulls would come without cease. His father said: "I hear the gulls all follow you—catch some so I may play with them." The next day, when he went to the shore, the gulls danced above but would not land.

Thus it is said: "The perfect word leaves words behind; the perfect act leaves acting behind." What common knowledge knows is shallow. *Gull* and *ou* are interchangeable. *Hundreds coming without cease* means their comings and goings were countless, not limited to a hundred. *Dancing but not landing* means they were wary. For if the slightest thought arises, the mechanism is already exposed—how could one forget self and other? This metaphor illustrates wordless words, actionless action, and knowledge beyond knowing—its meaning is deeply intimate. For *non-action*, *wordlessness*, and *unknowing* are merely the absence of self-will. The perfect word is wordless, hence: "The perfect word leaves words behind." The perfect act is actionless, hence: "The perfect act leaves acting behind." People do not know what cannot be known and take what can be known as knowledge—what they see is shallow, hence: "What common knowledge knows." *Common* means the same, like the word *all*.

These three phrases are also found in the *Zhuangzi*’s "Attaining Life" chapter.

When Viscount Xiang of Zhao led a hundred thousand men to hunt in Zhongshan, they piled grass and set fire to the forest, fanning flames across a hundred *li*. A man emerged from a stone cliff, rising and falling with the smoke and embers. The crowd thought him a ghost. After the fire passed, he walked out slowly, as if untouched by what he had endured.

Viscount Xiang, astonished, detained him and observed him closely: his form, complexion, and seven orifices were human; his breath and voice were human. He asked: "By what Way did you dwell in stone? By what Way did you enter fire?"

The man said: "What thing do you call stone? What thing do you call fire?"

Viscount Xiang said: "What you just emerged from was stone; what you just passed through was fire."

The man said: "I do not know."

Marquis Wen of Wei heard of this and asked Zixia: "What sort of man is he?"

Zixia said: "From what I have heard of the Master’s teachings, one who is harmonious is in great accord with things, so that nothing can harm or obstruct him. Roaming through metal and stone, treading through water and fire—all are possible."

Marquis Wen said: "Why do you not do this?"

Zixia said: "To hollow out the heart and discard knowledge—I have not yet attained this. However, I can speak of it when there is leisure."

Marquis Wen said: "Why does the Master not do this?"

Zixia said: "The Master is capable but chooses not to act."

Marquis Wen was greatly pleased.

*Jie reng* means piling grass. They trampled the grass and burned the forest for the hunt. *What thing do you call stone? What thing do you call fire?* This is also a metaphor for knowledge beyond knowing. The account of treading through fire shares the same meaning as Shang Qiu Kai’s story. *Harmonious* means being in great accord with things. This *harmony* is the work of creation.

When the heart-mind merges as one with the workings of creation, then nothing differs from the self. Initially, there is no obstruction—hollowing out the heart and discarding knowledge is precisely the knowledge beyond knowing.

*Try* means to attempt; *speak of it when there is leisure* means to have long expounded upon this. The Master being *capable but choosing not to act* is like Huangbo and the foreign monk crossing water: Huangbo thought it a display of demonic trickery, but the monk turned back and bowed, saying, "A vessel of the Great Vehicle—I am not your equal." This is the very point of the discussion.

A divine diviner from Qi arrived in Zheng and was named Ji Cheng. He knew the life and death, survival and perishing, fortune and misfortune, long life and early death of men, predicting them by year, month, ten-day period, or day with godlike accuracy. When the people of Zheng saw him, they all fled. When Liezi saw him, he was entranced and returned to tell Huqiuzi, saying, "At first, I thought your Way was supreme, but now there is something even greater."

Huzi said, "I have shown you only its outward form, not its true substance—how could you have truly attained the Way? A flock of hens without a rooster—how could they lay eggs? If you set your Way against the world and insist it must be believed, you will surely be exposed. That is why others can divine your fate. Bring him here tomorrow to meet me."

*Year, month, ten-day period, or day* refers to predictions near or far. A *divine diviner* is a physiognomist whose words proved as accurate as a god’s. Those who fled did so in fear of his veracity. *Entranced* means utterly convinced. *Shown you only its outward form* means revealing only its external aspect; *not its true substance* means not yet revealing its inner reality. *You* refers to Liezi. "You have not yet fully witnessed its true substance—how can you claim to have attained the Way?" The word *truly* implies mistaking partial attainment for full mastery; this must be understood through the tone of the passage. Only with both male and female can life be born—this refers to egg-laying creatures. Without a male, how could there be eggs? This means that without a heart-mind, there are no traces. This sentence illustrates that his heart-mind had not yet transformed, so it could be perceived through form.

*Set against* means to elevate. To elevate one’s Way above the world and demand belief in it is to leave traces—this is the untransformed state, which is why the diviner could read your fate.

The next day, Liezi brought him to meet Huzi. Upon leaving, the diviner said to Liezi, "Alas! Your master is dead—he will not live. He cannot last even ten days. I saw something strange in him—like damp ashes."

Liezi entered, his tears soaking his lapels, and told Huzi. Huzi said, "Just now, I showed him the earthly pattern of stillness—like the first sprouts of guilt. *Hu* is the sound of not trembling. If it does not cease, he nearly saw my *blocked virtue’s subtlety*."

The "damp ashes" describe his vital qi nearing exhaustion, like embers already sodden and about to extinguish.

*Earthly pattern* is akin to the term used in Chan meditation practice. *Guilt* coalesces as a sprout—sprouting yet not sprouting. *Not trembling* means precisely that: not trembling, not moving. *Not ceasing* coalesces as *not upright*, where "upright" cannot be fixed in speech. This "not upright" aligns with Mencius’ phrase "there must be action, yet do not fix it." Only when there is the semblance of movement yet no movement does the diviner perceive "damp ashes." Living ashes are fire; damp ashes signify the fire on the verge of extinction.

*Blocked virtue’s subtlety* is another term from meditative practice. *Virtue’s subtlety* is the impulse of life. *Blocked* means closed—sealing the mechanism so it does not move, hence the appearance of life on the brink of extinction, leading Jixian to conclude he would not live.

He tried bringing him again. The next day, he brought him once more. Upon seeing Huzi, the diviner said to Liezi, "Fortunate indeed! Your master has met me—he is recovering. The ashes now hold life! I saw his *blocked power*."

Liezi entered and told Huzi. Huzi said, "Just now, I showed him the *Heaven-and-Earth* pattern. Names and realities did not enter, yet the subtlety arose from the heels—this is *blocked power*. He nearly saw my *subtle goodness*."

*Blocked power* is movement within stillness. *Power* is akin to *mechanism*, though mechanism is subtle while power is manifest. Within the sealed closure, the mechanism stirs and becomes visible, so Jixian perceived it as fully alive.

*Heaven-and-Earth* is another meditative term, akin to "heavenly field." The field above heaven is not earthly soil but the soil of spontaneity—like modern practitioners of self-cultivation who call the tongue the "heavenly ford" or the crown of the head "mud-ball," signifying the impulse of life sprouting and ascending.

*Names and realities did not enter* means both being and non-being are transcended. *The mechanism arises from the heels* describes qi ascending from below, so subtle it cannot be seen—hence "mechanism." *Subtle goodness* refers to the movement of inherent nature.

He tried bringing him again. The next day, he brought him once more to see Huzi.

He emerged and said to Liezi: "Your master is not in a state of fasting; I cannot divine for him. Try fasting, and I shall divine for him again later." Liezi entered and reported this to Huzi. Huzi said: "Earlier, I showed him the Great Void without trace—this was nearly revealing to him my qi-mechanism in equipoise. *Great Void without trace* is another meditative term: *Great Void* means the vast emptiness; *without trace* means no beginning or end is visible. *Equipoise* means balance, or half: when the qi-mechanism moves to the state of balance or halfway, it is half-dynamic and half-quiescent. The spirit-diviner deemed me not fasting, for I was half-dynamic and half-quiescent, unsettled.

The whirlpool of the giant salamander becomes an abyss; the whirlpool of still water becomes an abyss; the whirlpool of flowing water becomes an abyss; the whirlpool of surging water becomes an abyss; the whirlpool of cascading water becomes an abyss; the whirlpool of seeping water becomes an abyss; the whirlpool of dammed water becomes an abyss; the whirlpool of welling water becomes an abyss; the whirlpool of divergent water becomes an abyss—these are the Nine Abysses. This passage speaks of the Nine Abysses as names for meditative states. Today, Buddhists use the term *observances*, but the ancients called them *abysses*. With nine names, they likely correspond to the modern Twelve Observances. Yet *Zhuangzi* mentions only three; here, all nine appear, suggesting this is not from the original *Liezi* but an interpolation by later hands. *Whirlpool* should be written as *審* (to examine), following *Zhuangzi*—*審* means *truth*. The names of the Nine Abysses are all metaphors, hence: "such-and-such an abyss is a metaphor for truth; such-and-such a metaphor is truth for such-and-such an abyss."

The *giant salamander* is a large fish; *whirling* means spiraling. *Zhuangzi* writes *桓* (to revolve) here, which is correct. Water containing a giant salamander presents the image of half-quiescence and half-dynamism—this is the so-called *qi-mechanism in equipoise*. *Still water* is quiescence, the so-called *mechanism of blocked virtue*. *Flowing water* is dynamism, the so-called *mechanism of subtlety*. *Zhuangzi* says: "The abyss has nine names; here, three are given." These three metaphors are cited precisely to confirm the earlier statement. Examining the flow of this text, it seems to lose the original meaning; from this, the right and wrong of the two books become apparent.

*Surging water* wells up from below. *Cascading water* pours down from above. *Seeping water* (also written as *汜*) should be *汍*—water emerging from a side crevice. *Dammed water* is obstructed and does not flow; it is not water that stills itself. *Welling water* seeps out from underground springs, pooling into stagnant ponds. *Divergent water*, as the *Mao Commentary on the Book of Songs* says, "shares the same source but flows to different destinations." The above water names mostly appear in the *Erya*; they were likely added by later hands using the *Erya*’s terminology. The annotators say: "Water’s rushing, surging, flowing, and stilling resemble the heart-mind of the perfected one, which responds to external things with ease or difficulty, exhibiting movement, quiescence, advance, or retreat." This interpretation is mistaken. Guo Xiang’s commentary on this passage in *Zhuangzi* is of the same kind.

He tried bringing him again.

The next day, he brought him again to see Master Hu. Before he could settle into his stance, the visitor lost himself and fled. Master Hu said, "Pursue him." Liezi chased after him but could not catch up. Returning, he reported to Master Hu, saying, "He has vanished, he is gone—I could not reach him." Master Hu said, "Just now, I showed him what had never yet departed from my origin. I met him with emptiness and compliance, leaving him unsure of who or what I was. Thus, he took me for withered reeds, for surging waves—hence his flight. 'Vanished' and 'gone' mean he could no longer perceive me. 'Never yet departed from my origin' is also a matter of observing names. 'Emptiness' is the void. 'Compliance' means yielding and following. As if nothing, as if something—unsure of what it was, hence 'unsure of who or what.' *Mao* is pronounced *tui*. *Maomao* means broken and crushed. *Bōliú* means vast and boundless. He saw nothing of me, only broken reeds and boundless waves—thus he lost himself and fled."

Thereafter, Liezi returned home, believing he had never yet begun to learn. For three years he did not venture out, cooking for his wife, eating pork as he would human food, and in all matters remaining detached. He carved and polished only to return to simplicity, standing alone like an unhewn block, sealed and complete, thus abiding to the end. "Cooking for his wife" means he took her place at the hearth and cauldron without leaving. "Eating pork as he would human food" speaks of gathering his spirit within, no longer discerning outward forms. "Detached in all matters" means that though he acted, he did so without self-awareness, as if not personally engaged. "Carving and polishing to return to simplicity" refers to breaking his limbs and dulling his senses. "Standing alone like an unhewn block" is like a wooden figurine. "Sealed" means possessing edges and corners. "Abundant" means many. If his form were like a wooden figurine, how could it have many edges and corners? "Abiding to the end" means he remained thus for the rest of his life, ever constant in this state. *Fēn* is written as *fēn*, *róng* as *zāi*. Following *Zhuangzi* here, these are all errors in transcription.

Both Zhuangzi and Liezi belong to the same school of learning. Such discussions must have been part of their shared teachings, which is why both texts contain them.

When Liezi was traveling to Qi, he turned back midway and encountered Bohun Maoren. Bohun Maoren asked, "Why have you returned?" Liezi replied, "I was startled." "Startled by what?"

Liezi had eaten at ten millet-porridge stalls, and five of them had served him first. Bohun Maoren said, "If this is so, then why were you startled?"

Liezi replied, "When inner sincerity is not dissolved, one’s outward demeanor radiates brilliance, thereby overawing others’ hearts, causing them to slight the noble and the elder and to attend solely to their own concerns. Those millet-porridge vendors merely sell gruel for a living, with no great surplus profit. Their gains are meager, their influence slight, and yet they still behave thus—how much more so a lord of ten thousand chariots, whose person is wearied by state affairs and whose wisdom is exhausted by governance? If he were to entrust me with responsibilities and demand results from me, this is why I was startled."

Bohun Maoren said, "Excellent is your observation! Remain as you are, and others will come to safeguard you."

Shortly after, Liezi went to visit Bohun Maoren, only to find the shoes outside his door filling the entrance. Bohun Maoren stood facing north, leaning heavily on his staff and pressing it against his chin. After a while, without a word, he went inside. The attendant informed Liezi, who rushed over barefoot, clutching his shoes, and upon reaching the door, asked, "Since you have come, Master, have you not neglected your medicine?"

Bohun Maoren replied, "It is done. I had already told you: others will come to safeguard you. Indeed, they have safeguarded you."

Not that you can make others safeguard you, but that you cannot prevent others from safeguarding you—why then employ such artifice to move them? Such delight in being moved only breeds strangeness. If you must provoke a response, it will unsettle your very foundation—what purpose does this serve? Those who keep your company offer you no counsel; their petty words are all poison to men. Neither awakened nor enlightened, how can they discern one another? Where lies the path to return? Where do words turn back upon themselves?

One who takes his meal at a ten-vinegar stall, yet five stalls send him offerings first—such a man commands respect without purchase, for harmony and compliance accumulate within, and radiance and brilliance bloom without. These are the words of the sagely gate. Yet if inner sincerity remains unresolved, it is but accumulated virtue untransformed. Resolution is transformation. *Die* is movement; *xingdie* is the bearing and conduct of form. One who "achieves radiance" possesses a luminous demeanor, embodying the meaning of inner accumulation manifesting outwardly—yet this is deemed a learning of traces. To "pacify the hearts of others" is to subdue them, for if I cannot transcend traces, others perceive them, and thus their hearts submit in reverence. As Master Zhaozhou said: "This old monk’s cultivation lacks power—even ghosts and spirits see through it." This is the same idea.

To "value age" is to respect the elderly, for age naturally commands reverence. Yet I am neither old nor noble, and still, others slight them while honoring me—this reverence surpasses even that due to age and rank. *Zheng* means to gather, to accumulate. Such matters, when amassed over time, inevitably breed harm: the more one’s fame and traces are exposed, the harder it becomes to escape the perils of the age. "No surplus profit" means the gain left over is scant. This line, compared to *Zhuangzi*, adds a "not"—altering the meaning entirely. *Ying* is profit. Those with power in the world can sway others; buying vinegar is a trifling matter, for one initially holds no authority to influence others—yet they revere me so. How much more so for a ruler?

When the body is at its peak and wisdom is exhausted, they will surely seek me out and employ me, demanding I present them with success—this is what is meant by *zheng*, the very peril it entails. *Xiao* means to offer. Bohun Maoren rejoiced in this, saying: "Excellent is your observation!"—meaning you possess a single eye for this. He added: "Remain as you are." This meant there was no need to wander further, for others would flock to you and safeguard you as their teacher. *Chu* means to stay; *yi* is an auxiliary particle. *Bao* means to guard. The multitude of followers filling the doorway attests to this.

Yet this single word *bao* already hints at insufficiency, for Bohun Maoren’s vision stands a level higher. The shoes outside the door were many—disciples had gathered in throngs. "Leaning heavily on his staff and pressing it against his chin" describes him standing erect, planting his staff and resting his chin upon it. *Cu* means to press. The *binzhe* was the one who received guests. "Clutching his shoes and running barefoot"—in ancient times, one sat on mats and removed shoes before entering; in his haste to welcome Bohun Maoren, he did not have time to put them on. "Neglecting medicine" refers to teaching, to opening and refining as with medicinal stones. *Fei* means to set aside. "It is done" conveys the sense of "let it rest." I had already told you others would safeguard you—you cannot prevent them from doing so, just as *Zhuangzi* says: "Forgetting oneself is easy; making others forget you is difficult."

Why then do you act thus? *Er* refers to you; *yong* means to do. What is the purpose of your conduct in moving others so? That others are moved and take delight in you stems from your inability to conceal yourself, allowing strangeness to emerge and be seen—hence the saying: "Delight in being moved breeds strangeness." If you persist in this, not only will your outward form fail to remain hidden, but you will inevitably be stirred, shaking your very foundation—all to no avail. *Wu wei* means "no benefit," with an added sense of "even worse."

Those who keep your company are your friends. Their learning is shallow, their words trivial—hence "petty words," all of which are poison to men. With no one to admonish you, you remain unawakened and unenlightened. Who then will question you or care for your well-being? *Xiang shu* means "who," an interrogative phrase. This passage aligns with *Zhuangzi*’s "Lie Yu Kou" chapter, differing by only a word or two.

When Yang Zhu journeyed south to Pei, and Lao Dan traveled west to Qin, they met at the outskirts. Arriving in Liang, Yang Zhu encountered Laozi. Midway, Laozi looked up to the sky and sighed: "At first, I thought you could be taught—now, you cannot." Yang Zhu did not respond. Upon reaching their lodging, he brought water for washing, a towel and comb, removed his shoes outside the door, and advanced on his knees, saying: "Earlier, Master looked up to the sky and sighed: 'At first, I thought you could be taught—now, you cannot.' Your disciple wished to ask for an explanation, but your journey afforded no pause, so I dared not. Now that you have paused, I beg to know my fault."

Laozi said: "Your haughty gaze, your arrogant stare—who would wish to dwell with you? The purest white appears sullied; the greatest virtue seems insufficient." Yang Zhu’s expression changed, and he said solemnly: "I humbly receive your instruction."

When he had departed before, the innkeepers had come forth to greet and escort him; the host of the lodging held the mat, his wife held the towel and comb, and the guests yielded their seats while the cooks withdrew from the hearth. Upon his return, however, the innkeepers contended with him for seating.

Yang Zhu asked about his fault, saying: "Master declared I could no longer be taught—where, then, does my error lie?"

"睢睢吁吁" describes a bearing of self-importance and constraint. "Who would wish to dwell with you?" means that he had not forgotten the distinction between self and others, ever acting as though sharing company with them. "The purest white appears sullied" conveys the intent to remain unassuming despite clarity. "The greatest virtue seems insufficient" means that though one possesses it, one does not presume upon it.

"迎将" means to greet and see off. "家公" refers to the master of the inn. "执席" and "执巾栉" denote acts of service. "炀者" means the cook. Yielding seats and withdrawing from the hearth were signs of respect. "Contending for seating" shows that they no longer regarded him as worthy of reverence. Before hearing Laozi’s words, he carried himself with self-importance, so others treated him with deference. Once enlightened, he withdrew into humility, and people came to see him as an ordinary man.

This passage is identical to the "Yu Yan" chapter of the *Zhuangzi*, except that "涫" in this text appears as "盥" in the *Zhuangzi*, though the meaning is the same.

Yang Zhu passed through Song and stayed at an inn. The innkeeper had two concubines: one beautiful, the other plain. The plain one was favored, while the beautiful one was slighted. Yang Zhu asked the reason. The innkeeper’s young attendant replied: "The beautiful one is self-aware of her beauty, so I do not recognize it as beauty. The plain one is self-aware of her plainness, so I do not recognize it as plainness." Yang Zhu said: "Take note, disciples. Conduct yourself with virtue but abandon the conduct of self-regard—wherever you go, will you not be beloved?" This passage is also found in the "Shan Mu" chapter of the *Zhuangzi*.

"Self-aware of her beauty" means she was proud and boastful. "Self-aware of her plainness" means she was modest and considered herself inadequate. "Conduct yourself with virtue but abandon the conduct of self-regard" means to possess the virtue of the worthy without the bearing of self-importance—wherever one goes, people will cherish and delight in them. This is a most intimate and practical lesson in life.

*Mencius* portrays Yang Zhu as an egoist, but judging from these passages, Yang Zhu seems to have followed Laozi’s teachings. Could it be that Yang Zhu initially studied under Laozi before establishing his own school?

There are ways that always prevail in the world and ways that do not always prevail. The way that always prevails is called softness; the way that does not always prevail is called strength. Both are known, yet people fail to recognize them. Thus, the ancients said: "Strength first contends with those unlike oneself; softness first yields to what surpasses oneself. Contending with those unlike oneself leads to peril when matched. Yielding to what surpasses oneself brings no peril. By this, one prevails over the self as if over others; by this, one bears the world as if bearing nothing. It is called prevailing without striving to prevail, bearing without striving to bear."

Softness can always prevail; strength cannot. This is Laozi’s teaching. Both principles are easily understood, yet most people remain unaware of them. Since ancient times, those who boast of their strength regard others as inferior and take pleasure in surpassing them. If this is considered strength, then one stronger than oneself will surely contend with them, and they will not prevail—thus, peril follows. Hence it is said: "Strength first contends with those unlike oneself; when matched, peril ensues." Those who esteem softness see all others as surpassing themselves and remain behind, always weak and unassuming—where, then, is peril? Hence it is said: "Softness first yields to what surpasses oneself, bringing no peril."

By this way, one guards the self and always prevails, thus: "By this, one prevails over the self as if over others." "As if over others" means "as if over equals." Those who can always prevail over themselves are such people. By this way, one bears the affairs of the world and always prevails, thus: "By this, one bears the world as if bearing nothing," meaning those who can bear the world are such people. For if one claims not to prevail, one prevails at all times—hence "prevailing without striving to prevail." If one claims not to bear, the world can be borne—hence "bearing without striving to bear."

Yuzhi said: "To be firm, one must guard with softness; to be strong, one must preserve with weakness. Accumulate softness, and it becomes firm; accumulate weakness, and it becomes strong. Observe what one accumulates, and you will know the realm of fortune or misfortune."

Strength prevails over those unlike oneself, but when matched, it is rigid. Softness prevails over what surpasses oneself, and its power is immeasurable. Lao Dan said: "Arms that are strong will perish; wood that is strong will break. The soft and weak are the companions of life; the hard and strong are the companions of death."

Guarding with softness ensures enduring firmness; preserving with weakness ensures enduring strength. Constant softness and weakness bring fortune; inability to be soft or weak brings misfortune. Hence it is said: "Observe what one accumulates, and you will know the realm of fortune or misfortune." "Accumulate" means to persist over time. Those who rely on strength to prevail over inferiors disregard their equals, and when their rigidity meets opposition, they do not prevail. Hence it is said: "Strength prevails over those unlike oneself; when matched, it is rigid." Guarding with softness and seeing all others as surpassing oneself, one contends with nothing, and thus always prevails. Hence it is said: "Softness prevails over what surpasses oneself, and its power is immeasurable."

These are the words of Yuzhi, further corroborated by several passages from the *Laozi*. Yuzhi had his own book and was also a disciple of Laozi.

"Arms that are strong will perish" means that those who rely on military force in conflict will surely perish.

"Wood that is rigid will break"—like the vine or willow, which are difficult to snap, while solid wood breaks easily. The supple and weak endure, while the hard and strong perish; these are of the same kind. This saying appears in the *Laozi*, chapter seventy-six. It draws an analogy between humans and plants in life and death, hence the term 'of the same kind.' Following the earlier metaphors of arms and wood, it likewise speaks of 'the same kind,' meaning that softness prevails while rigidity fails—all of this belongs to the same category.

Appearance need not be childlike for wisdom to be childlike; wisdom need not be childlike for appearance to be childlike. The sage values childlike wisdom and disregards childlike appearance, while the common people favor childlike appearance and distance themselves from childlike wisdom. When appearance resembles their own, they draw near and cherish it; when it differs, they keep their distance and fear it.

A being with a seven-foot frame, distinct hands and feet, hair on the head and teeth in the mouth, standing upright and moving forward—this is called a human, yet it may harbor the heart of a beast. Though it has the heart of a beast, its appearance earns it affection. Creatures with wings and horns, fangs and claws, flying aloft or crouching to run—these are called birds and beasts, yet they may possess the heart of a human. Though they have the heart of a human, their appearance sets them apart.

'Childlike' means 'same,' a phonetic variation. The intent is that while human appearance differs from that of birds and beasts, their hearts may be the same. The sage values sameness of heart, not sameness of form—this is a lament against the world. 'Standing upright and moving forward' means relying on one another in shared purpose. 'Aloft' means above; 'crouching' means below.

Fu Xi, Nü Wa, Shen Nong, and the Xia sovereigns had serpent bodies and human faces, ox heads and tiger noses—these bore non-human forms yet possessed the great virtue of sages. Jie of Xia, Zhou of Yin, Huan of Lu, and Mu of Chu had the seven apertures of human appearance, yet harbored the hearts of beasts. Yet the common people cling to a single form in pursuit of supreme wisdom—how can this suffice?

The Yellow Emperor and the Flame Emperor clashed on the wilds of Banquan, leading bears, brown bears, wolves, leopards, lynxes, and tigers as vanguard, with eagles, hawks, falcons, and kites as banners—this was commanding beasts through force. Yao tasked Kui with overseeing music: striking and tapping stones, and the hundred beasts danced in unison; the *Xiao Shao* played nine movements, and the phoenix came to pay homage—this was summoning beasts through sound. If the hearts of birds and beasts differ from those of humans, how so? Their forms and voices differ from ours, yet we know not how to engage them. The sage is all-knowing and all-penetrating, thus able to draw them forth and employ them.

The intelligence of birds and beasts naturally aligns with that of humans in some ways. Their desires and means of preserving life require no borrowed wisdom from humans: males and females pair, mothers and offspring bond; they avoid flatlands and seek high ground, shun cold and favor warmth; when dwelling, they form groups, and when moving, they march in ranks; the small stay within, the strong guard without; when drinking, they accompany one another, and when feeding, they call in flocks.

In the earliest antiquity, they dwelled alongside humans and walked among them. In the age of emperors and kings, they began to scatter in fear and disorder. By the final era, they hid and fled to evade harm. Now, in the eastern land of the Jie people, there are those who frequently understand the speech of the six domestic animals—this is the achievement of partial knowledge. The divine sages of highest antiquity fully comprehended the dispositions of all things and entirely grasped the voices of different kinds. They gathered and assembled them, instructed and received them, making them equal to the people. Thus, they first convened ghosts, spirits, and mountain demons, then reached the people of the eight directions, and finally gathered birds, beasts, insects, and moths. This speaks to the shared heart and intelligence of all beings with blood and breath.

The divine sages, knowing this, left nothing untaught in their instruction. The three sages, though their forms differed from humans, possessed the great virtue of sages—this illustrates that Jie, Zhou, Huan, and Mu, though human in form, truly had the hearts of beasts. This further demonstrates that those who command beasts through force or summon them through sound provide visible evidence to substantiate the argument.

Bears and tigers leading the vanguard can be seen in the tale of Ju Wuba of the Eastern Han, while eagles and kites as banners were released to follow their direction, with people following in their wake—hence the term 'banners.' The intelligence of birds and beasts stems from their desires and the nurturing of their young—how could this be taught by humans? Thus it is said: 'They do not borrow wisdom from humans.' 'All' means 'every'; 'preserving' means 'nurturing.'

In ancient times, humans lived alongside deer and pigs—such things occurred, and this account borrows from them to illustrate the discourse on humans and beasts. 'Partial knowledge' refers to solitary enlightenment, hence 'the achievement of partial knowledge,' whereas the ancient sages possessed complete knowledge. 'Complete' means 'all.' 'Nothing untaught' means that both humans and different kinds were instructed.

The intent is that in the earliest antiquity, even different kinds could be taught to be equal to humans, yet in the final era, people resemble different kinds, and with no sages arising to transform and guide them, this too is a lament of indignation.

In Song there was a man called Ju Gong who loved monkeys and raised them in troops. He understood the monkeys' intentions, and the monkeys grasped his heart. He reduced his household's provisions to satisfy the monkeys' desires. Soon, supplies ran short, and he planned to limit their food. Fearing the monkeys would not submit, he first deceived them, saying: 'I will give you chestnuts—three in the morning and four in the evening. Is that enough?' The monkeys all rose in anger. Then he said: 'I will give you chestnuts—four in the morning and three in the evening. Is that enough?' The monkeys all prostrated themselves in delight.

All things are ensnared by their own abilities and vulgarity—this is no different. The sage ensnares the multitude of fools with wisdom, just as Ju Gong ensnared the monkeys with his cunning. Names and realities remain unharmed, yet their joy and anger are manipulated. This passage aligns with the *Zhuangzi*'s "Equalizing Things" chapter, though the wording differs slightly.

"Three in the morning and four in the evening—first little, then much; four in the morning and three in the evening—first much, then little, yet the total remains seven. *Neng bi* (ability and vulgarity) refers to wisdom and folly. *Wu* (things) means all things can ensnare one another. The sage ensnares the multitude of fools with wisdom, meaning he inspires, transforms, and guides them without their awareness. The *Zhuangzi* uses this as a metaphor for the absence of right and wrong, though its intent differs here.

Master Ji Shengzi reared fighting cocks for King Xuan of Zhou. After ten days, the king asked: 'Are the cocks ready to fight?' He replied: 'Not yet—they are still vain and reliant on their qi.' After another ten days, the king asked again. He replied: 'Not yet—they still respond to echoes and shadows.' After another ten days, the king asked again. He replied: 'Not yet—they still glare fiercely and bristle with qi.' After another ten days, the king asked again. He replied: 'Nearly so. Though other cocks may crow, they show no change. They appear like wooden cocks—their virtue is complete. No other cock dares respond; they turn and flee. To react to sounds or shadows is to have one’s heart still moved by external things. "Glare fiercely and bristle with qi" means their spirit and qi are already full, yet they glare without moving. Initially, they were "vain and reliant on their qi," meaning their qi was still external; here, "glare fiercely and bristle with qi" means their qi is internal. The word *ji* (fierce) carries the sense of anger—direct gazing—yet differs from the commoner’s hand-on-sword, fierce glare. When they appear like wooden cocks, their spirit and qi are both whole. This speaks of the art of guarding qi, using the cock as a metaphor.

Hui Ang visited King Kang of Song. The king stamped his feet, coughed, and spoke rapidly: 'What pleases me are courage and strength—I do not delight in benevolence and righteousness.'"

"What instruction do you bring to me?" asked the guest.

Hui Ang replied, "I possess a Way here: though a man may be brave, he cannot pierce you; though he may be strong, he cannot strike you. Does Your Majesty not wish to hear of it?"

The King of Song said, "Excellent—this is what I desire to hear."

Hui Ang continued, "That one cannot pierce you, that one cannot strike you—this is still a form of humiliation. I possess another Way here: though a man may be brave, he dare not pierce you; though he may be strong, he dare not strike you. That he dare not—this is not because he lacks the will. I possess yet another Way here: he fundamentally lacks the will. One who lacks such will has no mind for love or profit. I possess still another Way here: that all men and women under heaven joyfully desire to love and benefit you. This surpasses mere courage and strength—it is the highest of the four grades. Does Your Majesty not wish to attain it?"

The King of Song said, "This is what I desire to obtain."

Hui Ang replied, "Kong and Mo have already achieved this. Kong Qiu and Mo Di, though they had no land to rule as lords nor office to lead as ministers, yet all men and women under heaven craned their necks and stood on tiptoe, yearning to be at peace and benefit under them. Now, Your Majesty is a ruler of ten thousand chariots—if you truly possess this will, then all within your four borders will receive its benefit. You would surpass Kong and Mo by far."

The King of Song had no reply. Hui Ang hastened out.

The King of Song said to his attendants, "How persuasive the guest was in convincing me!"

This passage resembles somewhat the "Discourse on Swords" in the *Zhuangzi*.

That one cannot pierce you, that one cannot strike you—is this not still contention, with moments of victory or defeat? That one dare not pierce, dare not strike—this still harbors a mind for competition. These are two grades. To fundamentally lack the will is to have no mind for contention with me—this is yet another grade. That all joyfully desire to love and benefit me—this is to subdue the world through nurturing others with goodness, ascending through three grades to reach the highest Way. Thus it is called the highest of the four grades.

This is the work of our sages, yet to speak of Kong and Mo together reflects the discourse of scholars after the Spring and Autumn period.

*Diefu* means stamping the foot; *qingkai* means speaking loudly.

"Swift speech" refers to rapid words—both describe the appearance of his anger.

"One so eloquent" implies deception through his rhetorical skill, meaning this guest possesses great persuasive ability and thus can convince me with his arguments.

*Chongxu Zhide Zhenjing Yanzhai Kouyi*, Scroll Three

By Yanzhai Lin Xiang

**The Third Chapter: King Mu of Zhou**

During the reign of King Mu of Zhou, a *huaren* from the lands of the Four Poles arrived. He could enter water and fire, pass through metal and stone, reverse mountains and rivers, and relocate cities. Riding the void, he did not fall; striking the solid, he did not falter.

**The Third Chapter: King Mu of Zhou**

His transformations were boundless, beyond all measure. Having altered the forms of things, he could also shift a man’s thoughts. King Mu revered him as a spirit and served him as a lord. He yielded his own chambers for the *huaren*’s dwelling, offered the three sacrificial beasts in tribute, and selected female musicians to entertain him.

The *huaren* deemed the king’s palace too crude to inhabit, his banquets too rank to consume, and his consorts too foul to embrace. Thus, King Mu ordered a new construction, sparing no artistry in earth and timber, in ochre and whitewash. The five treasuries were emptied before the tower’s completion—soaring a thousand *ren* high, overlooking the peaks of Zhongnan, it was named the Terrace of Central Heaven. Virgins of Zheng and Wei, maidens fair and supple, were anointed with fragrant balms, their brows painted, their hairpins and rings adorned. Clad in fine silks, trailing skirts of even weave, their faces powdered white and eyes lined black, jade pendants at their waists, they filled the halls with orchid and pollia. The melodies of *Bearing Clouds*, *Six Radiance*, *Nine Shao*, and *Morning Dew* resounded to delight him. Each month, jade robes were presented; each dawn, jade delicacies were offered. Yet the *huaren* remained discontent, and only with reluctance did he deign to ascend.

Before long, he invited the king to wander with him. Grasping the *huaren*’s sleeve, the king ascended, halting only at Central Heaven, then proceeding to the *huaren*’s own palace. That palace was wrought of gold and silver, strung with pearls and jade, rising above clouds and rain, its foundations unseen. Gazing upon it, one beheld only a mass of layered clouds. All that met the eye and ear, all that the nose inhaled or the tongue tasted, was beyond the mortal realm. The king truly believed it to be the Clear Capital, the Purple Tenuity, the Grand Heaven, the Vast Music—the abode of the Emperor. Yet when he looked down, its halls and pavilions appeared no more than heaped clods and piled thatch.

The king, dwelling there for decades, forgot his own kingdom. The *huaren* again invited him to wander. Wherever they went, neither sun nor moon shone above, nor rivers nor seas stretched below. The play of light dazzled the king’s eyes until he could no longer see; the clash of sounds confounded his ears until he could no longer hear. His limbs and organs trembled, unsteady; his mind wandered, his spirit fled. He begged the *huaren* to return. The *huaren* complied, and the king fell as if into the void.

When he awoke, he sat where he had before, his attendants unchanged. Before him, the wine had yet to clear, the dishes had yet to spoil. Only a moment had passed. The king asked whence he had come, and his attendants replied, “The king was lost in silent contemplation.”

From this, King Mu was disoriented for three months before recovering. When he questioned the *huaren* again, the *huaren* said, “I wandered with Your Majesty in spirit—how could your form have moved? Moreover, what difference was there between the place we visited and your own palace? What difference between our journey and your own gardens? Your Majesty mistook the familiar for the strange, doubted what was but a fleeting absence. How can one grasp the full measure of transformation, swift or slow, in its every aspect?”

The *huaren* was a master of illusions. Entering water and fire, piercing metal and stone—these were alterations of form; journeying with the king to the Emperor’s abode was a shifting of perception. *Xinglou* and *shan’e* refer to foul odors. *E’nü miao* describes graceful beauty; *manmi*, slender elegance. *Axi* is fine silk; *qiwan*, even-woven silk. *Zhi* is a fragrant herb; *ruo*, pollia. *Bearing Clouds* was the name of the Yellow Emperor’s music; *Six Radiance*, of Emperor Yu’s; *Morning Dew*, of Tang’s. Jade robes and jade food signify their preciousness. *She* (pronounced *shi*) means discontent. “Unseen foundations” describes the lack of visible base. “Like layered clouds” conveys their multitude. The Clear Capital and Purple Tenuity are celestial palaces; the Grand Heaven and Vast Music, heavenly music. *Leikuai* means piled earth; *jisu*, piled thatch—from above, the palace seemed small and humble. Dazzled by light and confounded by sound, he trembled in fear, his spirit unsettled. *Yunxu* describes falling through emptiness. Wine is finest when rich; if left, it grows thin. “Dishes not spoiled” means they remained fresh. “Silent contemplation” refers to seated meditation. This all occurred in an instant—like Ye Fashan’s journey with Emperor Ming to the Jade Bridge.

The spirit may wander while the body remains still—such is the art of the illusionist. To mistake the familiar for the strange, to doubt what was but a fleeting absence—this is to forget that the present is constant. How can one fully grasp the forms of transformation, whether swift or slow? *Xuji* refers to duration; *mo*, to form. “Fleeting absence” is akin to forgetting. The king was greatly pleased.

He neglected state affairs, took no delight in his ministers and concubines, and indulged in distant travels. Commanding the chariot drawn by the Eight Steeds, with *Siyin* and *Hualiu* as the right and left inner horses, *Chiji* and *Baijian* as the right and left outer steeds—these are their names and meanings. For the lead chariot, *Zaofu* served as driver, while *Li Qishang* stood at the right. The second chariot had *Quhuang* and *Yulun* as the right and left inner horses, *Daoli* and *Shanzi* as the left and right outer steeds, with *Baiyao* as its master, *Canbai* as driver, and *Benjie* at the right. Racing a thousand *li*, they arrived at the land of the *Jusou* people. The *Jusou* offered the blood of white swans for the king to drink and the fresh milk of cows and horses to wash his feet, as well as those of the two chariots’ attendants. After drinking, they departed and lodged at the slopes of Kunlun, on the sunny side of the Red Water.

On another day, they ascended the heights of Kunlun to behold the palace of the Yellow Emperor, sealing it with a monument to bequeath to later generations. Then they paid homage to the Queen Mother of the West, feasting with her upon the Jasper Pool. The Queen Mother sang a song for the king, and he joined in harmony—its words were mournful. Gazing upon the place where the sun sets, covering ten thousand *li* in a single day, the king sighed: "Alas! I, alone, am deficient in virtue yet sated with pleasure. Will later generations recount my faults?" King Mu was nearly a divine being—able to exhaust the joys of his own lifetime, like an ancestor of a hundred years. The world regarded him as having ascended in transcendence.

This account is detailed in *The Travels of King Mu*. Han Yu’s *Stele Inscription for the Temple of King Xu Yan* also references it, and the *Zuozhuan*’s poem "Some like gold, some like jade" pertains to the same matter. *Silu* is another name for *Hualiu*. *Baijian*, *Li Shang*, *Quhuang*, *Yulun*, *Daoli*, *Shanzi*, and *Baiyao* are all names of horses. Liu Zongyuan’s *Disquisition on the Eight Steeds* depicts their forms as even more bizarre—yet it remains uncertain which version is true or false. The land of the *Jusou* is akin to Kunlun and the Red Water. Offering swan’s blood as drink and washing feet with the milk of cows and horses—today’s northern barbarians make wine from mare’s milk, which is of the same kind. The "two chariots" refer to the king’s two carriages. "Another day" means the following day. "Sealing" is like the feng and shan sacrifices. "Paid homage" means to visit. "Feasting" means to entertain with wine. The Queen Mother’s song is *The White Cloud Poem*. "The place where the sun sets" refers to Yan Mountain. "Deficient in virtue" means his conduct was wanting. "Sated" means fulfilled. Though his virtue was wanting, his pleasure was complete—yet he feared later generations would recount it as his fault. The *Qi Zhao* ode speaks of "exerting the people’s strength without the heart of drunkenness and satiety," which conveys the same meaning. To take such joy throughout one’s life, living a hundred years before passing—this the world regarded as "ascending in transcendence," believing him to have died, though in truth he did not.

The purport of this passage is that beyond the world lies vast emptiness, yet boundless joy still exists. Even the abode of emperors and kings is not worthy of envy. People, limited by what their ears and eyes perceive, covet wealth and nobility, unaware that in the eyes of heaven and humanity, such things are but trifles.

Lao Chengzi studied illusion under Master Yin Wen for three years without receiving instruction. Lao Chengzi asked to be told his faults and sought to withdraw, but Master Yin Wen bowed and led him into a chamber, dismissing his attendants before speaking: "When Laozi departed for the west, he turned to me and said: ‘The qi of the living, the forms of beings—all are illusion. That which begins with creation, that which transforms through yin and yang—this is called life, this is called death. To exhaust numbers and comprehend change, to follow form in its shifting—this is called transformation, this is called illusion. The Creator’s craft is subtle, its work profound—truly difficult to fathom or exhaust. But that which follows form is manifest in its artifice, shallow in its work—thus it arises and vanishes in an instant. Only when one knows that illusion and transformation are no different from life and death can one begin to study illusion. You and I are also illusion—what need is there to learn?’"

The purport of this passage is that the arts of worldly illusion and the principles of creation’s transformations in life and death share the same technique. Lao Chengzi returned home and, pondering Master Yin Wen’s words deeply for three months, attained mastery over presence and absence, freely manipulating the four seasons. In winter, he summoned thunder; in summer, he conjured ice. Birds ran, beasts flew—yet throughout his life, he never revealed his art, so the world never transmitted it. Though Lao Chengzi did not fully grasp the technique, through deep reflection he awakened to it, moving effortlessly between being and non-being. Thus it is said: "He mastered presence and absence." *Fanxiao* means to overturn and examine—an allusion to transformation. "Manipulating the four seasons" means altering the nodes of yin and yang. "Summoning thunder in winter" is to transform yin into yang; "conjuring ice in summer" is to transform yang into yin. Birds belong to yang, beasts to yin—thus birds are light, beasts heavy. By altering yin and yang, he made birds run and beasts fly. As his art left no trace, the world never transmitted it.

Liezi said: "Those skilled in transformation follow a subtle and unobtrusive Way, yet their achievements are no different from ordinary people’s. The virtue of the Five Emperors and the accomplishments of the Three Kings were not necessarily the result of wisdom or strength—some were achieved through transformation. Who can fathom this?" "Subtle and unobtrusive" means to employ it silently, unseen by others. Though the Way may be invisible, its effects are no different from human actions. The transformations of the Five Emperors and Three Kings were like the illusions of Lao Chengzi and Master Yin Wen—speaking of their unfathomable mystery.

Waking has eight signs; dreaming, six conditions. What are the eight signs? The first is the familiar; the second, action; the third, gain; the fourth, loss; the fifth, sorrow; the sixth, joy; the seventh, life; the eighth, death. These eight signs are what form engages.

The *Rites of Zhou* speaks of six types of dreams, and here too six dreams are discussed—yet first the eight signs of waking are addressed. "Familiar" refers to affairs, the myriad matters of human life. "Action" denotes the activities undertaken during the day. "Gain," "loss," "sorrow," "joy," "life," and "death" are shared by all that possess form, hence it is said: "what form engages." *Engages* means *responds*—the response of resonance.

What are the six conditions? The first is the *proper dream*; the second, the *startling dream*; the third, the *thought dream*; the fourth, the *waking dream*; the fifth, the *joyful dream*; the sixth, the *fearful dream*. These six arise from the intercourse of spirit. The six conditions of dreams align with those in the *Rites of Zhou*.

Within the human heart lies emptiness, numinous awareness; when affairs bear omens, they appear in dreams—this is the *proper dream*, the dream of foreshadowing. The *startling dream* is one in which one is startled awake. The *thought dream* arises from what one has been pondering. The *waking dream* presents matters of waking life during sleep. The *joyful dream* stems from what brings joy. The *fearful dream* arises from what causes anxiety or dread. Fear and startlement differ, though the commentary in the *Rites of Zhou* makes no such distinction. All these are unified in one’s own spirit, hence it is said: "what spirit intermingles." *Intermingles* means intermingling with external realms.

Those who do not recognize the origin of responsive change are perplexed when events arise, unaware of their cause; those who recognize the origin of responsive change understand the cause when events arise. Knowing their cause, one remains unperturbed. The waxing and waning, the ebb and flow of this singular body all communicate with Heaven and Earth, resonating with the myriad kinds. The mutual resonance of self and other gives rise to transformations, hence it is called *responsive change*. *Events* refer to the eight signs. *Their cause* means all arise from the heart.

People, not knowing that the origin of responsive change begins in the unified heart, harbor doubts and startlements. With understanding, there is no perplexity, no perturbation. Waxing and waning, ebb and flow all follow a single principle, hence it is said: "the waxing and waning, ebb and flow of this singular body." So too with Heaven and Earth, so too with the myriad things. As the *Analects* says: "At forty, one is free from perplexity"—this is that realm.

When yin qi is strong, one dreams of wading through great waters in terror; when yang qi is strong, one dreams of traversing great fires and being scorched; when both yin and yang are strong, one dreams of life and death. These three statements also appear in medical texts. From this, it is evident that dreams emerge from one’s own heart. *Scorched* describes the intensity of fire. Life is yang; death, yin.

When overly sated, one dreams of giving; when ravenously hungry, one dreams of taking. *Giving* means bestowing upon others; *taking*, seizing from them. Such dreams arise from desire in the heart, just as thirst leads to dreams of drinking. Thus, those afflicted by floating emptiness dream of soaring; those burdened by sinking fullness dream of drowning. These are maladies of the heart.

Sleeping with a sash around the waist, one dreams of serpents; if a bird clutches one’s hair in flight, one dreams of flying. The sash and the bird are seen while awake, yet transform in dreams. When yin prevails, one dreams of fire; when illness approaches, one dreams of food. Dwelling in darkness, the mind craves light—hence yin gives rise to dreams of fire. With stomach qi depleted, illness prompts dreams of eating. All emerge from this heart.

Drinkers grieve; dancers weep. Those who dream of drinking may harbor hidden sorrows; those who dream of dancing may conceal tears. Dreams and waking states often stand in opposition. Dream-interpretation manuals abound with such cases.

Master Liezi said: "Spiritual encounter produces dreams; physical contact, events." Thus, daytime thoughts become nighttime dreams—spirit and form meet. When the spirit is concentrated, thoughts and dreams dissolve of themselves. Truly awake, one speaks not; truly dreaming, one comprehends not—these are the comings and goings of transformative things.

The true persons of antiquity forgot themselves in waking and slept without dreams—how could this be mere empty talk? Daytime visions arise from physical encounter; nighttime dreams, from spiritual encounter. Concentration stills the spirit; stillness banishes thought; without thought, there are no dreams. Yet when Gaozong dreamed of Fu Yue or Confucius dreamed of the Duke of Zhou, these were not dreams of mere thought.

In truth, the truly awake remain silent, still and serene. The truly dreaming do not grasp, taking dreams for reality. The flux of transformation—this is the interplay of dream and waking. Unaware of this principle, people dismiss the ancient true persons’ self-forgetting wakefulness and dreamless sleep as idle chatter. How could they fathom the true person’s way?

In waking, one forgets all attachment to the world. With the heart unattached, emptiness reigns, unity prevails—how then could sleep bring dreams? The Buddhist saying "dream and waking are one" captures this perfectly. In his letters, Dahui discusses Gaozong’s dream of Fu Yue, Confucius’ dream of the Duke of Zhou, and the Buddha’s dream of golden drums—his elucidation of the unity of dream and waking is most illuminating.

At the southwestern edge of the farthest reaches lies a land called the Country of Ancient Wilderness. Its borders are unknown, for yin and yang qi do not mingle there, and cold and heat remain undifferentiated.

The light of sun and moon does not shine there, so day and night remain undifferentiated. Its people neither eat nor wear clothing, yet sleep often—waking once every fifty days. To them, what occurs in dreams is real, while what is seen in waking is illusory.

The Country of Ancient Wilderness is but a name. Without yin and yang, without sun and moon, its people neither clothe nor feed themselves, sleeping much and waking but once in fifty days. Thus, they take dreams as real and waking as false. This illustrates the idea of the ordinary being intermittent while the transient seems nonexistent—if one were to dream constantly, the brief moments of waking would instead appear illusory.

The Central Kingdom, as the four seas call it, spans north and south of the Yellow River, east and west of Mount Tai, extending over ten thousand *li*. Its yin and yang are measured precisely, bringing one cold and one hot season; the division of dusk and dawn is clear, yielding one day and one night. Its people possess both wisdom and folly. The myriad things flourish, and skills and arts abound. There are rulers and subjects in governance, rites and laws in maintenance. Their deeds and undertakings are beyond reckoning.

A waking and a sleep—thus they take what waking does as real and what dreams show as false. *Qi* (齐) means "center," and the Central Kingdom is also called *Qizhou*. This passage speaks of how the people of the Central Kingdom likewise regard waking as real and dreams as illusory.

*Shendu* (审度) means to measure with precision; *fencha* (分察) means to distinguish clearly. In the northeasternmost corner of the earth lies a land called the State of Fuluo. Its climate is perpetually warm, bathed in the lingering light of the sun and moon, and no fine crops grow in its soil. Its people eat grass roots and tree fruits, knowing nothing of cooked food. Their nature is fierce and unyielding; the strong trample the weak, prizing dominance over righteousness. They run swiftly and rest little, ever awake and never sleeping.

The State of Fuluo is also an allegory. The alternating glow of the sun and moon illuminates it without end, so its land knows no darkness. As the *Tang Treatise* describes a place where "roasted sheep’s spleen is eaten while the sun still shines," there may well be such lands in the world—who can say? With sunlight and moonlight ever present, its people remain perpetually awake. This suggests that the people of the Central Kingdom take only what they perceive by day as real and what they dream by night as false, unaware that within the Six Directions there exist such lands where one cannot simply trust what the eyes and ears encounter. All this is meant to broaden the narrow views of the common world.

In the Zhou dynasty, a grandee named Yin amassed vast wealth. His subordinates toiled ceaselessly, rising before dawn and resting not even at dusk. Among them was an old laborer, his strength spent, yet pressed to work ever harder. By day, he groaned as he labored; by night, exhausted, he slept deeply, his spirit scattered. Night after night, he dreamed of being a ruler—lording over the people, governing the state, roaming palaces and gardens, indulging every desire, his joy beyond compare. Upon waking, he returned to servitude.

When others consoled him for his toil, the laborer said: "A man’s life spans a hundred years, divided equally between day and night. By day, I am a slave, and though it is bitter, it is but half my lot. By night, I am a lord, and my joy knows no bounds. What cause have I for resentment?"

Yin, meanwhile, was consumed by worldly affairs, his thoughts fixed on his estate. Body and mind wearied, he too slept deeply at night. Night after night, he dreamed of being a servant—running errands, performing every task, enduring scoldings and beatings without end. In his sleep, he muttered and groaned, waking only at dawn. Distressed, he sought counsel from a friend.

His friend said: "Your rank brings you honor, your wealth surpasses others—you are far ahead of most. Yet by night, you dream of servitude, a natural balance of suffering and ease. If you sought to control both waking and dreaming, how could that be achieved?"

Upon hearing this, Yin eased the laborers’ burdens and reduced his own worries. His ailments gradually subsided.

*Xixi* (昔昔) means "nightly," referring to the laborer’s nightly dreams of kingship. *Zhong* (锺) means "to gather," as in concentrating one’s thoughts on managing one’s estate. *Anyi* (啽呓) means sleep-talking. *Bing* (并) means "all," and *jian* (间) means "ease."

He eased the laborers’ tasks and lessened his own concerns, and so both men’s ailments gradually subsided.

This passage uses waking and dreaming to illustrate the nature of suffering and joy—its words carry deep meaning.

There was a man of Zheng who was gathering firewood in the wild when he encountered a startled deer. He pursued it, struck it down, and killed it. Fearing others would see, he hastily concealed it in a dry moat, covering it with plantain leaves, his delight overwhelming. Soon after, he forgot where he had hidden it and took it all for a dream. As he walked along, he chanted about the event. A passerby overheard him, followed his words, and took the deer. Upon returning home, the man told his wife: “A firewood-gatherer dreamed he had caught a deer but forgot where it was. Now I have it—he must truly have been dreaming!” His wife said: “Are you the one who dreamed the firewood-gatherer caught the deer? How could there have been a firewood-gatherer? Now that you truly have the deer, is your dream the real one?” The man replied: “I possess the deer—why trouble myself over whether he dreamed or I dreamed?”

The firewood-gatherer returned home, discontented at losing the deer. That night, he truly dreamed of where he had hidden it and of the one who had taken it. At daybreak, he followed his dream and found the man. They took their dispute to the magistrate. The magistrate said: “At first, you truly caught the deer but mistakenly called it a dream; now you truly dreamed of the deer but mistakenly call it real. He truly took your deer and now contends with you over it. Your wife also claims that if you dreamed of someone else’s deer, then no one truly obtained it. Since you now possess the deer, let it be divided between you.” He reported this to the Lord of Zheng, who exclaimed: “Ah! Is the magistrate about to dream of dividing someone else’s deer?” He consulted his minister, who said: “Whether dreaming or waking, this is beyond my ability to discern. To distinguish between the two, only the Yellow Emperor or Confucius could do so. Now that they are gone, who can settle the matter? Let us simply follow the magistrate’s judgment.”

This passage likewise uses waking and dreaming to show how truth and illusion cannot be fixed—its argument carries its own depth.

In his middle years, Hua of Yangli in Song suffered from forgetfulness. What he took in the morning he forgot by evening; what he gave in the evening he forgot by morning. On the road, he forgot to walk; at home, he forgot to sit. He no longer recognized past or present. His entire household was distressed. He consulted diviners, but no oracle could be cast; he sought shamans, but no prayers could restrain it; he saw physicians, but no treatment could cure him. A scholar from Lu offered his services, claiming he could heal him. Hua’s wife and children offered half their property in exchange for the remedy. The scholar said: “This is not a matter for divination, nor for prayer, nor for medicine. I shall attempt to transform his mind and alter his thoughts—perhaps there may yet be hope.” Thereupon, he exposed Hua to the elements until he sought clothing; starved him until he sought food; confined him in darkness until he sought light.

The scholar joyfully told Hua’s son: “The illness can be cured!” Yet he added: “My method is secret, passed down through generations and never disclosed to others. Let me dismiss all attendants and remain alone with him in seclusion for seven days.” They complied, unaware of what he did, yet after years of affliction, the malady vanished in a single morning.

When Hua awoke to clarity, he flew into a rage, cast out his wife, punished his children, and brandished a spear to chase away the scholar. The people of Song seized him and demanded an explanation. Hua said: “Before, I was lost in forgetfulness—vast and boundless, unaware whether heaven and earth existed. Now, suddenly recalling the past, the tangled threads of decades—life and death, gain and loss, sorrow and joy, love and hate—all surge forth. I fear that in the future, the chaos of existence and loss, sorrow and joy, love and hate will again disturb my heart. Could I ever regain even a moment’s forgetfulness?”

Zigong heard of this and found it strange. He reported it to Confucius, who said: “This is not something within your grasp.” Then, turning to Yan Hui, he instructed him to record it.

*Toxin* means suffering; *poison* means bitterness. The practices of divination, shamanism, and medicine persist even today, showing that the nature of people past and present is not so different. *No oracle could be cast* means it did not align with the hexagrams. *No prayers could restrain it* means they took it as a curse but could not suppress it. *No treatment could cure it* means it was incurable. *Offered his services* means he recommended himself as capable of healing the illness. *Transform his mind and alter his thoughts* refers to this being a malady of the heart, untreatable by other methods. *Sought clothing, sought food, sought light*—these show that his heart still retained some awareness. *Remained alone with him without others present*—thus, no one knew what treatment was applied.

His anger upon awakening stemmed from the realization that worldly affairs could burden his heart, making ignorance and forgetfulness preferable. For ordinary people, worries over joy and sorrow, gain and loss, life and death, love and hate disturb the heart. Only those who follow the Way and delight in forgetfulness escape this; otherwise, the illness of forgetfulness is better than clarity.

The passage refrains from full explanation, merely stating, “This is not something within your grasp”—another subtle point.

Among the Feng clan of Qin, there was a son who was clever in youth but developed a delusional illness in adulthood. He mistook singing for weeping, white for black, feasts for rot, sweetness for bitterness, and wrong for right. Whatever he perceived—heaven and earth, the four directions, water and fire, cold and heat—all were distorted. The Yang clan told his father: “The gentlemen of Lu possess many arts. Might they cure him? Why not seek them out?”

His father traveled to Lu but passed through Chen, where he encountered Lao Dan. He described his son’s condition. Lao Dan said: “How do you know your son is deluded? Today, all under heaven are confused by right and wrong, blinded by profit and harm. Those sharing his affliction are many, yet none awaken. Moreover, one man’s delusion cannot overturn a household; one household’s delusion cannot overturn a village; one village’s delusion cannot overturn a state; one state’s delusion cannot overturn the world. If all under heaven were deluded, who could overturn it? If all people’s hearts were like your son’s, you would be the deluded one. Joy and sorrow, sound and color, scent and taste, right and wrong—who can correct them? Furthermore, my words may themselves be delusion. How much more so the gentlemen of Lu, steeped in delusion—how could they resolve another’s delusion? Spare your provisions and hasten home.”

This passage on delusional illness inverts the earlier meaning of the illness of forgetfulness.

*Overturn* means to disturb. A household is not overturned by one man’s delusion; a village is not overturned by one household’s delusion. This means that when the deluded are few and the clear-sighted many, confusion cannot prevail. But if all under heaven were deluded, the undeluded would be seen as afflicted. The implication is that today’s people are all deluded by profit and desire, ignorant of the Way, and thus regard those who follow the Way as deluded.

*Steeped in delusion* means deeply deluded. *Spare* means to discard or waste; do not squander your provisions.

A man of Yan was born in Yan, raised in Chu, and in old age returned to his homeland. Passing through Jin, his companions deceived him, pointing to a city and saying: “This is the city of Yan.” His expression darkened. They pointed to a shrine and said: “This is your village’s shrine.”

Then he sighed deeply. Pointing to a house, they said: “This is your ancestors’ dwelling.” He wept silently. Pointing to a mound, they said: “This is your ancestors’ grave.” The man could not restrain his sobs. His companions burst into laughter, saying: “We were only jesting with you—this is but the land of Jin.”

The man was overcome with shame. When he at last reached Yan and truly beheld the city and shrine of Yan, truly saw his ancestors’ dwelling and grave, his sorrow was all the fainter. This passage illustrates how, when the human heart lacks true perception, it may mistake the false for the real and the real for the false.

*Fainter* means nonexistent; *his sorrow was all the fainter* means he no longer grieved. Judging by the incisiveness of this passage, it must belong to the original *Liezi*.

**Confucius, Part Four**

Confucius was at leisure in his chambers when Zigong entered to attend him. Seeing his master’s troubled countenance, Zigong dared not inquire and went out to tell Yan Hui. Yan Hui took up his zither and began to sing.

Confucius heard him and summoned Yan Hui inside, asking: “Why are you alone so joyful?”

Yan Hui replied: “Why are you alone so troubled?”

Confucius said: “Speak first of your own thoughts.”

Yan Hui answered: “Long ago, I heard you say: ‘Those who delight in Heaven and know fate are therefore without sorrow.’ This is why I am joyful.”

Confucius, his expression turning grave, paused for a moment before saying: “Did I truly say such a thing? You have misunderstood. That was my teaching of former days—let me now correct it with my present words. You merely grasp that delighting in Heaven and knowing fate brings no sorrow, yet you do not know that delighting in Heaven and knowing fate entails a sorrow greater still.

“Now I shall tell you the truth: Cultivating the self, accepting poverty or prosperity, recognizing that going and coming are not of the self, and banishing disorder from the heart’s reckonings—this is what you call delighting in Heaven and knowing fate without sorrow. But in the past, when I studied the *Odes* and *Documents*, rectified rites and music, I did so to govern all under Heaven and bequeath it to later ages—not merely to cultivate the self or govern the state of Lu. Yet the lord and ministers of Lu daily lost their proper order; benevolence and righteousness further declined; human nature grew ever more shallow. If the Dao cannot be practiced in a single state or in the present age, what hope is there for all under Heaven and for future generations? If the Dao fails even in one state and in the present time, what can be done for all under Heaven and the ages to come? Only now do I realize that the *Odes*, *Documents*, rites, and music cannot save the world from chaos, yet I still do not know the means to reform it—this is the sorrow of those who delight in Heaven and know fate.

“Nevertheless, I have grasped it at last. The joy and knowledge of which I speak are not what the ancients called joy and knowledge. True joy and true knowledge lie in neither joy nor knowledge. Thus, there is nothing that is not joy, nothing that is not known, nothing that is not sorrow, nothing that is not done. Why then abandon the *Odes*, *Documents*, rites, and music? Why seek to reform them? To take joy in joy is to have a heart. True joy is joy without a heart that can contain it.”

Yan Hui bowed northward and said: “I, too, have grasped it.” He went out and told Zigong.

Zigong stood in bewilderment, lost in himself. Returning home, he brooded for seven days without sleep or food, until his bones stood out from his flesh. Yan Hui went again to enlighten him, and only then did Zigong return to Confucius’ gate, where he strummed the zither, sang, and recited the classics all day without cease.

This passage shifts three times in meaning: first, it says that delighting in Heaven and knowing fate brings no sorrow; next, that those who delight in Heaven and know fate may yet feel sorrow; and finally, that to know sorrow and joy is not as good as to know neither. Its intent is that to have sorrow and joy is not as good as to have neither; to recognize sorrow and joy as sorrow and joy is not as good as to recognize neither. Such is its general purport. Yet it conveys this through indirection and contrast, its style far removed from that of the *Zhuangzi*. It is doubtful this belongs to the original *Liezi*.

*Yin* means to be deeply immersed, to ponder with intense absorption.

A minister of Chen paid a visit to Lu and privately met with the house of Shusun. Shusun said: “There is a sage in our state.”

The minister of Chen asked, "Is it not Kong Qiu?"
Shusun replied, "It is."
"How do you know he is a sage?"
Shusun said, "I once heard Yan Hui say: 'Kong Qiu can set aside the mind and employ the form.'"

The minister of Chen said, "In our state, too, there is a sage—did you not know?"
Shusun asked, "Of whom do you speak as a sage?"
The minister replied, "Among the disciples of Lao Dan, there is one named Kang Cangzi who has attained the Dao of Lao Dan. He can see with his ears and hear with his eyes."

The Lord of Lu, hearing this, was greatly astonished and sent his highest minister with rich gifts to summon him. Kang Cangzi accepted the invitation and arrived.

"To set aside the mind and employ the form" means to be without mind and forget one’s form, so that even when acting, one does not know it as action. "To see with the ears and hear with the eyes" is the teaching that the six senses share a single source.

The Buddhist tradition takes sound as the object of *Guanyin*’s observation. Indeed, the Japanese monk Tōkō, in his *Vimalakīrti Praise*, composed a *Praise to Guanyin* with this very meaning. Its verses read:

All the manifold sounds of the world,
The multitude hears with the ear, not the eye.
Only this great being’s eyes can perceive,
Yet in the realm of the eye, nothing is grasped.
So too with ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.
Excellent! The heart penetrates the emptiness of the ten directions,
The six senses mutually manifest thus.

The explanation is found in the *Recorded Sayings, General Exposition*, section fifteen, where it is expounded with great clarity.

The Lord of Lu, speaking humbly, questioned him.

Kang Cangzi said: "Those who transmit this speak falsely. I can see and hear without using eyes and ears, yet I cannot alter the function of eyes and ears."

The Lord of Lu said: "This is even more extraordinary—how does this Way operate? I remain eager to hear it."

Seeing and hearing without eyes and ears is what *Zhuangzi* meant by "the senses cease, yet the spirit moves." Hearing with *qi*, hearing with the heart—this too expresses the same idea. Though one does not use eyes and ears to see and hear, the function of eyes and ears remains the same as in others. Thus it is said: "One cannot alter the function of eyes and ears." "Even more extraordinary" means that this is yet more wondrous.

Kang Cangzi said: "My body aligns with the heart, the heart aligns with *qi*, *qi* aligns with spirit, and spirit aligns with nothingness. Whether something is as subtle as a single blade of grass or as faint as a single sound—whether distant in the eight wilds or near at the edge of one’s brows—whatever comes to disturb me, I will know it. Yet I do not know whether this awareness arises from the seven apertures and four limbs, or from the heart’s knowledge of the six viscera. It is simply self-knowing."

"Body," "heart," "*qi*," and "spirit" all return to nothingness—this is the function of no-mind. "As subtle as a single blade" means even the tiniest visible thing. "As faint as a single sound" means even the slightest audible thing. These eight characters are well placed. When things come to disturb me, I know them—this is stillness undisturbed, yet responsive to stimuli; it is the ability to name things as they arrive and act as events arise.

The seven apertures, four limbs, heart, and six viscera may perceive and know, yet I remain unaware of them—this is the body aligning with the heart, the heart with *qi*, *qi* with spirit, and spirit with nothingness. "It is simply self-knowing" means that though I know myself, there are things beyond words.

The Lord of Lu was greatly pleased. Later, he told Confucius, who smiled but did not answer. This smile without answer is what was meant earlier by "the Master could do it but did not act." The implication is that though the Master knew this Way, he did not speak of it to others, hence his smile and silence.

The Grand Steward of Shang asked Confucius: "Is Qiu a sage?"
Confucius replied: "How would Qiu dare claim sageliness? Yet Qiu is one who has broadly studied and retains much knowledge."

The Grand Steward asked: "Were the Three Kings sages?"
Confucius said: "The Three Kings were skilled in employing wisdom and courage—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know."

He asked: "Were the Five Emperors sages?"
Confucius said: "The Five Emperors were skilled in employing benevolence and righteousness—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know."

He asked: "Were the Three Sovereigns sages?"
Confucius said: "The Three Sovereigns were skilled in following the times—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know."

The Grand Steward was astonished and said: "Then who is a sage?"
Confucius, his expression shifting, paused before saying: "In the West there is a sage who governs without disorder, is trusted without speaking, and transforms without teaching. So vast is he that the people cannot name him. Qiu suspects he may be a sage—yet does not know if he truly is one, or truly is not."

The Grand Steward fell silent, pondering to himself: "Has Kong Qiu deceived me?"

This passage seems to suggest that Buddhist teachings already existed at the time, attributed to the Master’s name in reverence. One who surpasses the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors—who else could this be but the Buddha? Though Buddhist scriptures entered China during the reign of Emperor Ming of Han, their doctrines had long since spread throughout the world.

"Governs without disorder" means his engagement with the world transcends order and chaos. "Trusted without speaking" and "transforms without teaching" describe how sincerity moves others. "Does not know if he truly is a sage or truly is not" conveys a tone of reverence, yet the ambiguity suggests that while such teachings existed, they were not yet widely practiced—hence the refusal to speak definitively.

"Fell silent, pondering to himself: 'Has he deceived me?'" vividly captures his shock, doubt, and astonishment.

"Skilled in employing wisdom and courage" means they could use wisdom and courage to govern the world. "Skilled in following the times" means they could act in accordance with the natural order.

Who, then, is a sage? And what defines a sage?

Zixia asked Confucius, "What sort of man is Yan Hui?"
The Master said, "Hui’s benevolence surpasses my own."
Zixia asked, "What sort of man is Zigong?"
The Master said, "Ci’s eloquence surpasses my own."
Zixia asked, "What sort of man is Zilu?"
The Master said, "You’s courage surpasses my own."
Zixia asked, "What sort of man is Zizhang?"
The Master said, "Shi’s solemnity surpasses my own."

Zixia rose from his mat and asked, "Then why do these four serve you?"
The Master said, "Be seated. I shall tell you.
Hui can be benevolent but cannot adapt; Ci can be eloquent but cannot be restrained; You can be courageous but cannot be timid; Shi can be solemn but cannot blend in. Were I to exchange my qualities for any one of theirs, I would not consent. This is why they serve me without reservation.

To be benevolent yet unable to adapt is to lack the capacity for change—it means one knows benevolence but not transformation, the subtlety of weighing circumstances. Here, *benevolence* carries the same meaning as *sincerity*. The terms *solemnity* and *blending* in the *Zhuangzi* and *Liezi* cannot be compared to those in my text. *Solemnity* means dignity; *blending* means harmonizing one’s light and merging with the dust.

If I possessed all four of their qualities, I could adapt as needed, whereas they cannot. In this light, *adapt* resembles *timeliness*. The sage embodies wholeness: at times eloquent, at times solemn, at times benevolent, at times courageous. The four disciples each possess only a partial virtue.

When I say *I would not consent*, it means they have studied the Way of adaptability and the mean but have not yet mastered it—thus, I do not approve.

Liezi first studied under Master Huqiu Zilin and befriended Bohun Maoren, then resided in Nanguo. Those who followed him were so numerous that they could not be counted daily. Yet Liezi himself was somewhat diminished, for each morning he debated with them, and none went unheard. *Could not be counted daily* means that even if one tried to tally them each day, they could not be exhausted—so great was the number of his followers. *Somewhat diminished* refers to the strain of his constant engagement.

All his daily debates and discourses spread throughout the world, and none failed to hear of them. Though he lived next door to Nanguozi for twenty years, they never paid formal visits to each other. When they met on the road, their eyes seemed not to see one another. Liezi’s disciples assumed there was enmity between them.

A man from Chu came and asked Liezi, "What is the nature of your rivalry with Nanguozi?"
Liezi replied, "Nanguozi is like an infant: his mind is empty, his ears hear nothing, his eyes see nothing, his mouth speaks nothing, his heart knows nothing, and his form shows no agitation. What could I possibly do with him? We do not exchange visits or formal greetings, yet we meet without pretense."

"Enmity" means contention. "Without doubt" means decisively. People all assumed the two had decisive contention in their hearts, which was why they did not meet. "His countenance full" describes a face so replete it seems to overflow the nape of the neck. "No hearing, no seeing, no speaking, no knowing" means that though he hears, he does not hear; though he sees, he does not see; though he speaks, he does not speak; though he knows, he does not know. "His form shows no agitation" means his virtue is complete and nothing external startles him. "What could I possibly do with him?" means: if I were to go see him, what would I say? Nevertheless, let us go together and see. Liezi selected forty disciples to accompany him. When they saw Nanguozi, he indeed appeared like a deceptive wraith—impossible to engage. Looking back at Liezi, his form and spirit were not in accord, and he could not join their company. Suddenly, Nanguozi pointed to one of Liezi’s disciples in the rear rank and spoke with him, cheerful and self-assured as one who stands alone in supremacy. Liezi’s disciples were astonished. Returning home, all wore expressions of doubt.

"Selected disciples" means choosing those to accompany him. "Deceptive wraith" describes a form so inert it resembles a wraith yet is not one. "Deceptive" means doubtful. Compared to Nanguozi’s wraith-like deceptiveness, Liezi’s form and spirit were not in accord, so he could not join their company—Nanguozi was beyond comparison. "Form and spirit not in accord" means form and spirit were separate and not yet unified. "Pointed to one in the rear rank and spoke with him" means he chose the lowest among them to address, implying Liezi was not worth speaking to. "Cheerful" means harmonious; "self-assured" means singular; "in supremacy" means uniquely exalted, as if no one else were present. Their doubt upon returning home was that Nanguozi had slighted Liezi.

Liezi said: The one who has attained the meaning speaks no words, and the one who advances in knowledge also speaks no words. To use no words as words is still words; to use no knowledge as knowledge is still knowledge. No words and not speaking, no knowledge and not knowing—these are still words and knowledge. They are also without anything not spoken, without anything not known; they are also without anything spoken, without anything known. It is only thus. Why this groundless astonishment?

One who has attained the meaning has penetrated the Dao and gained realization. One who advances in knowledge has penetrated the Dao and gained insight. Below this, the text unfolds in three turns.

"No words" means forgetting words. To use "no words" as words, to use "no knowledge" as knowledge—this "also words, also knowledge"—implies that though words are forgotten, the absence of words remains; this is the first turn. "No words and not speaking, no knowledge and not knowing—also words, also knowledge"—here, "no" and "not" are distinguished. "Not" means knowledge and words still linger; "no" means the absence of words and knowledge still lingers. "Also" conveys the sense of incompleteness; this is the second turn. Only when there is nothing not spoken, nothing not known, yet also nothing spoken, nothing known, does one reach the subtlety of penetrating the Dao; this is the third turn. This aligns with the saying "the heart does not transgress the measure," though here it is expressed with fervor. Modern Chan schools employ this very mechanism, and this passage’s phrasing closely resembles the dialectical exchanges in the *Transmission of the Lamp*.

"Why this groundless astonishment?" means: this is the affair of the perfected person—why do you falsely take it as shocking? The implication is that you are startled only because you do not yet understand the affairs of the perfected. How could I compare to such a one?

Liezi was a student. After three years, his heart dared not entertain judgments of right and wrong, his mouth dared not speak of profit and harm, and only then did Master Shang grant him a single glance. After five years, his heart once more entertained judgments of right and wrong, his mouth once more spoke of profit and harm, and only then did Master Shang relax his expression and smile. After seven years, whatever his heart conceived bore no trace of right or wrong; whatever his mouth uttered bore no trace of profit or harm. Only then did the Master draw him near to share his mat. After nine years, whether his heart wandered or his mouth spoke, he no longer knew whether these were his own judgments of right and wrong or profit and harm, or another’s—inner and outer had merged. Thereafter, his eyes were like ears, his ears like nose, his nose like mouth—all were indistinguishable. His heart congealed, his form dissolved, bones and flesh fused entirely. He no longer sensed the body’s support, the feet’s tread, the heart’s thoughts, or the words’ storehouse. Only thus. Then the principle was nowhere concealed.

This chapter recounts the beginning of Liezi’s studies, as seen in the previous section. "Heart congealed" means settled; "form dissolved" means forgetting one’s form. Bones and flesh all melt away—he no longer knows his own body. Standing where the body leans, walking where the feet tread, conceiving what the heart conceives, uttering what the mouth utters—all are beyond his awareness. "Storehouse" means repository: the principles uttered are all contained within. Only thus—merely this state of unawareness, and nothing more. When principle is nowhere concealed, the supreme principle is immediately evident.

Initially, Liezi delighted in wandering. Master Huqiu asked: "Youkuo delights in wandering—what is it about wandering that delights you?" Liezi replied: "The joy of wandering lies in savoring the ceaseless transformation. Others wander to observe what they see; I wander to observe what changes. Wandering, ah, wandering—none have been able to discern the nature of my wandering."

Master Huqiu said: "Is Yourkuo’s wandering truly the same as others’, or do you claim it is fundamentally different? Whatever one sees, one always sees its changes. You savor the ceaselessness of things yet do not realize you yourself are ceaseless. You pursue external wandering yet do not know to cultivate inner observation. Those who wander externally seek completion in things; those who observe inwardly find sufficiency in themselves. Finding sufficiency in oneself is the perfection of wandering; seeking completion in things is the failure of wandering."

Thereupon, Liezi never again ventured out, believing himself ignorant of wandering. Master Huqiu said: "This is the perfection of wandering! The perfect wanderer knows not where he goes; the perfect observer knows not where he gazes. All things wander, all things observe—this is what I call wandering, this is what I call observation. Thus it is said: ‘Has he reached the perfection of wandering?’ The perfection of wandering, ah!"

Wandering means roaming and observing between heaven and earth. "Ceaseless" means daily renewal. Others take what they see as the joy of wandering and observation; I take the ceaseless transformation of creation as the joy of wandering and observation—thus none have been able to discern or know it. Hence it is said: "None have been able to discern his wandering."

Master Huqiu criticized him, saying: "Your wandering is the same as others’, yet you claim it is fundamentally different. Your seeing is always like this—how can you say you see its changes?" Thus he said: "Whatever one sees, one always sees its changes"—meaning Liezi falsely claimed to see its changes. Things’ ceaselessness presents itself anew day and night before one’s eyes, yet one sees only the new and not the ceaseless. The self as self is likewise. To savor the daily renewal of things while unaware that the self, too, follows transformation and departs, changing day by day, is to observe both constancy and change as external wandering. Those who seek completion in things merely exhaust external observation. Finding sufficiency in oneself and observing nothing without—this is the perfection of wandering. One who never attains it knows his learning has not yet reached perfection.

"Not knowing where he goes" means he has no destination. "Not knowing where he gazes" means he has no sight. Without destination or sight, there is no thing, no self. There is nothing that is not wandering, nothing that is not observation. This is what I mean by wandering and observation. Thus it is said: "All things wander, all things observe." Hence: "This is what I call wandering, this is what I call observation." Repeating "has he reached perfection?" is an emphatic expression of admiration.

Long Shu said to Wen Zhi: "Your art is subtle indeed."

"I suffer from an affliction—can you cure it?"

Wen Zhi replied, "I await your command. But first, tell me the symptoms of your illness."

Long Shu said: "Praise from my village brings me no honor; slander from the state brings me no disgrace. Gain does not delight me, nor does loss distress me. I regard life as death, wealth as poverty, others as swine, and myself as one among them. Dwelling in my home, I feel as though in a traveler’s inn; gazing upon my village, I see it as a land of barbarians. All these are my many afflictions—titles and rewards cannot sway me, punishments cannot intimidate me, prosperity or ruin, profit or harm cannot alter me, sorrow or joy cannot move me. Thus I am unfit to serve a lord, befriend companions, govern a wife and children, or command servants. What manner of illness is this? How could any remedy cure it?"

Wen Zhi then instructed Long Shu to stand with his back to the light. Wen Zhi himself stepped behind him, facing the light to observe. After a moment, he exclaimed: "Ah! Now I see your heart. The square inch of your mind is empty—you are nearly a sage. Your heart has six apertures, all flowing freely; only one remains blocked. Is it not those who take sagely wisdom as an affliction who suffer from this? My shallow art cannot cure it.

To view honor and disgrace, gain and loss, life and death, wealth and poverty as one—this is to forget the affairs of the world. To see others as swine is to erase distinctions of noble and base. To see myself as one among them is to dissolve the boundary between self and other. To treat one’s home as a travelers’ inn is to hold even kin at a distance. To regard one’s village as a land of barbarians is to see the far as near. All this arises from a heart free of entanglements. To be unfit to serve a lord, befriend others, govern a wife and children, or command servants—this is to lack the mind for worldly engagement. These are the traits of the perfected, yet you call them illness, much like the scorn of Chan masters.

Standing with one’s back to the light reveals the heart—just as Bian Que could see the five organs through a wall. Though this passage speaks in metaphors, its final turn concludes thus: sagely wisdom resides within us, yet if one cannot forget it, it too becomes an affliction. This is why the argument shifts so. As the Buddhists say: clinging to medicine to cure illness makes the medicine itself the illness. This is much the same.

That which arises without cause and is ever-living is the Dao. That which arises from life and thus lives on, though its end comes, is constancy. That which arises from life yet perishes is misfortune. That which arises without cause and is ever-dying is also the Dao. That which arises from death and thus dies, though it has not yet ended, is also constancy. That which arises from death yet lives on is fortune.

Thus, to live without purpose is called the Dao; to follow the Dao and attain one’s end is called constancy. To die with purpose is also called the Dao; to follow the Dao and attain death is also called constancy.

To live without cause means to arise from nowhere, unaware of how life comes to be. To dissolve all knowledge—this is the Dao. To live from life is to know how life arises and persists, though the body ends, its end does not truly perish—this is the view of ordinary people. To know that life entails death is to grasp the principle of no-life through life—this is misfortune, for such knowledge and awareness become a burden.

To know life through the principle of no-life is to live as though without life—this too is the Dao. The ‘too’ suggests nearness to the Dao. To know constant death through the principle of no-life, though the body has not yet ended, is to live as though already dead—this is also the view of ordinary people. Yet to know life through the principle of no-life is fortune.

To live without purpose is to hold no mind for life—this is called the Dao. To follow this Dao and know the principle of one’s end—this is called constancy. To die with purpose—here, ‘with’ is an error; it should be ‘without.’ To die without purpose, holding no mind for death, following nature—this too is called the Dao. To see the Dao and grasp the principle of death—this is called constancy.

The meaning here is that those who know the Dao are merely ordinary people, not those of lofty wisdom. It is those who do not know who are called the Dao. The arguments of Zhuangzi and Liezi largely follow this shifting pattern. The Buddhist debates on constancy and impermanence also trace their source here.

When Ji Liang died, Yang Zhu sang before his gate; when Sui Wu died, Yang Zhu wept over his corpse. The birth of a servant is met with song, his death with weeping. The eyes, about to go blind, first see the autumn down; the ears, about to go deaf, first hear the gnat in flight; the tongue, about to lose taste, first distinguishes the waters of the Zi and Sheng; the nose, about to be blocked, first detects the scent of burning rot; the body, about to stiffen, first hastens in restless motion; the mind, about to be deluded, first discerns right and wrong. Thus, when things do not reach their extreme, they do not return.

A servant is an ordinary person. Ji Liang and Sui Wu were also ordinary. Yang Zhu sang for one and wept for the other—thus Yang Zhu too was ordinary. The point is that to live and die without purpose is the same in principle, yet song and weeping differ—this is not knowing the Dao. When things do not reach their extreme, they do not return; when they do, they must reverse.

The lines from ‘the eyes about to go blind’ onward are like a lamp about to go out, which first flares brightly—this is the principle that when things reach their extreme, they must reverse.

In Zheng’s gardens and marshes, many worthies dwell; in Dongli, many talents reside. During the marshes’ labor service, a man named Bo Fengzi passed through Dongli and encountered Deng Xi. Deng Xi turned to his disciples and laughed: "Dance for him—what do you make of this one approaching?"

His disciples replied, "We wish to know."

Deng Xi said to Bo Fengzi: "Do you understand the meaning of ‘nurturing nurturance’? To receive nurture from others yet be unable to nurture oneself—this is the way of dogs and swine."

To nurture things and make them serve one’s use—this is the power of man. To make your disciples eat their fill, clothe themselves, and rest—this is the achievement of governance. Yet if the old and young gather in droves to become fodder for pens and kitchens, how is this different from dogs and swine?

Bo Fengzi did not respond.

One of Bo Fengzi’s followers stepped out of turn and said: "Has the Master never heard of Qi and Lu, where many are skilled in craft? Some excel in working earth and wood, some in metal and leather, some in music, some in writing and calculation, some in military affairs, some in ancestral rites—all talents are present. Yet without those who assign positions, without those who command, those who hold office lack knowledge, and those who command lack ability. Thus, the knowing and the capable are made to serve the unknowing and the incapable. The governors are but those whom we employ—why should you take pride in this?"

Deng Xi had no reply. He looked at his disciples and withdrew.

Deng Xi was a master of debate; Bo Fengzi, a man of virtue. Deng Xi, seeing Bo Fengzi approach, wished to mock and provoke him. *Ruo* means "you"; *his disciples* refers to Deng Xi’s followers; *that one approaching* is Bo Fengzi. The meaning of "nurturing nurturance" is like what Mencius called "being employed by others" and "employing others." Dogs and swine receive nurture from men, but those who nurture dogs and swine for their own use are men. The implication is that Bo Fengzi’s followers, fed by the state’s emoluments and sustained by the governors, are but tools of governance.

*Many are skilled* means many possess techniques. *Assigning positions* refers to appointing to office; *commanding* means directing others. Though their skills are equal, each excels in their own domain, yet none can appoint or direct the others. Those who appoint and command them possess neither knowledge nor ability. Thus, the knowing and capable are made to serve the unknowing and incapable. The governors are men of talent, while Bo Fengzi conceals himself in the Way. He says: "I conceal myself in the Way, appearing as one without knowledge or ability, yet those governors of Zheng who are employed in their time are but servants to me. How then can they nurture me?" *Why take pride* means: "Why do you boast and dance before me?"

Gongyi Bo was renowned among the feudal lords for his strength. Tangxi Gong spoke of him to King Xuan of Zhou, who prepared gifts and invited him. When Gongyi Bo arrived and the king observed his appearance, he seemed a feeble man. The king, perplexed, asked: "What is your strength like?"

Gongyi Bo replied: "My strength can break the leg of a spring katydid and lift the wing of an autumn cicada."

The king’s expression changed: "My strength can rend the hide of a rhinoceros or a young buffalo and drag the tails of nine oxen, yet I still feel it insufficient. You break the leg of a katydid and lift the wing of a cicada, yet your strength is renowned throughout the world—why?"

Gongyi Bo sighed deeply, withdrew from his mat, and said: "Excellent is the king’s question. I dare speak the truth. My teacher, Shangqiu Zi, was unmatched in strength under heaven, yet even his closest kin did not know it, for he never employed his strength. I served him unto death. He instructed me: 'One who wishes to see what others cannot see must train to observe what others do not; one who wishes to obtain what others cannot must cultivate what others will not. Thus, those who learn to see begin with perceiving a cartload of firewood, and those who learn to hear begin with hearing the striking of a bell. What is easy within presents no difficulty without. With no difficulty without, one’s name does not leave a single household.'

Now my name is known among the feudal lords—this is my violation of my teacher’s teaching, my display of my own ability. Yet my renown does not come from bearing my strength but from knowing how to use it. Is this not still better than bearing one’s strength in vain? *Kan* means 'to bear'—to say one can lift the wing of an autumn cicada is playful speech to provoke the king’s question."

Shangqiu Zi’s strength was unmatched under heaven, yet even his closest kin did not know of his courage, for he could conceal himself. "To see what is unseen, observe what is unobserved; to obtain what is unobtained, cultivate what is uncultivated"—this is the meaning of "knowing the unknown" and "acting through non-action." Those who learn to see begin with a cartload of firewood, and those who learn to hear begin with the striking of a bell—these are the coarse aspects of perception, which must progress to seeing the unseen and hearing the unheard before reaching subtlety. "What is easy within" refers to what is neither heard nor seen. *Easy* means that what is simple in itself is sought through difficulty. If one can see what is unseen and hear what is unheard, and what one seeks within is already easy, then externally, perception presents no difficulty. With no difficulty externally, even perception is unnecessary—how then would others know of it? Thus, his name did not leave a single household, meaning even his neighbors did not know. Now, I cannot help but employ my strength, so my fame for strength has spread throughout the world. Those who delight in victory and boast of their strength, unable to conceal themselves, bring their names to prominence—this is to violate the teacher’s teaching and lose the Way. Yet my use of strength, though I cannot conceal it, is still better than boasting of it. This is meant to satirize the king’s fondness for valor.

Yet the intent of this text is to embody "having as if not having, being full as if empty," to endure offense without retaliation. Thus, this parable is set forth.

*Long sigh* means a deep sigh.

Zhongshan Gongzi Mou was a worthy prince of Wei. He delighted in associating with worthy men, neglected state affairs, and took pleasure in the company of Gongsun Long of Zhao. Le Zhengzi Yu and his followers laughed at him.

Gongzi Mou said: "Why do you laugh at my delight in Gongsun Long?"

Zi Yu said: "Gongsun Long’s character is such that he follows no teacher, studies with no companions, is glib but misses the mark, rambles without substance, delights in the strange, and speaks recklessly."

He sought to bewilder men’s minds and overpower their speech, practicing such arts alongside Han Tan and his ilk.

*Without teacher or friend* means he studied alone.
*Glib* refers to his eloquence.
*Missing the mark* means failing to hit the principle.
*Rambling* means overflowing without restraint.
*Without school* means he adhered to no single school of thought.
Han Tan was a follower of Gongsun Long. With his theories and his disciples, they debated among themselves, aiming to confound and delude their contemporaries—far from the true principle.

Gongzi Mou’s expression changed as he said: "Why do you depict Gongsun Long’s faults so harshly? Pray, tell me the truth of the matter."

Zi Yu replied: "I laugh at how Long deceived Kong Chuan, claiming that a master archer could make the rear arrowhead strike the front nock, so that each shot followed the last without break, each shaft linked to the next, the foremost arrow reaching the target without a single miss, while the nock of the following arrow still clung to the bowstring—appearing as one continuous shaft.

*The nock* is the base of the arrow where the string rests.
*Making the rear arrowhead strike the front nock* means each shot follows the previous without interruption.
*Each shaft linked to the next* means no arrow stands alone.
*All the foremost arrows hit the target* means not one fell short.
*The following arrow’s nock still clung to the bowstring* describes how the nock, struck by the rear arrowhead, seemed to remain on the string.
*Reaching the target* means hitting the mark.
*The mark* refers to the standard.
*Reaching the mark* means conforming to the principle.
*Front and rear* denote the sequence of the shots.
*Still clung to the bowstring* means the nock, receiving the arrowhead, appeared as if still strung.

Kong Chuan was astonished.

Long said: 'This is not yet the height of skill. Hong Chao, a disciple of Feng Meng, once grew enraged at his wife and sought to frighten her. He drew the famed *Wuhao* bow and the prized *Qiwei* arrows, aiming at her eye. The arrow flew straight toward her pupil, yet her eyelid did not so much as flutter; the arrow fell to the ground without stirring a speck of dust. Is this the speech of a wise man?'

Gongzi Mou said: 'The words of the wise are not meant for fools to grasp. The rear arrowhead striking the front nock aligns what follows with what precedes. The arrow flying toward the pupil without the eyelid blinking—this is the full force of the shot. Why do you doubt it?'

*The Wuhao* was a renowned bow of the Yellow Emperor.
*The Qiwei* must also have been a famed arrow.
*The eyelid did not flutter* means she did not blink.
*The arrow fell without stirring dust* describes how lightly it landed.
*Aligning what follows with what precedes* means the force of the arrows, front and rear, was perfectly balanced.
*The full force of the shot* means the arrow reached the very edge of the pupil before falling—its momentum exhausted precisely at that point, a testament to the archer’s precision.

Le Zhengzi Yu said: 'You are one of Long’s followers—how could you not gloss over his flaws? Let me tell you of his most egregious claims.'"

Long deceived the King of Wei, saying:
"Intention exists without mind.
Pointing occurs without reaching.
Things exist without being exhausted.
Shadows exist yet shift.
A single hair can draw a thousand jun.
A white horse is not a horse.
An orphaned calf has never had a mother."

Such inversions of kind and reversals of principle are beyond counting.

Gongzi Mou said: "You take what is most profound as most egregious—yet the fault lies with you. Without intention, minds are the same; without pointing, all is reached. One who exhausts things always possesses them. That shadows do not move is explained by change. A hair drawing a thousand jun is due to equalized force. That a white horse is not a horse arises from the separation of form and name. That an orphaned calf has never had a mother means it is no orphaned calf at all."

Le Zhengzi Yu said: "You take all of Gongsun Long’s pronouncements as orderly and sound. If such words issued from another orifice, you would still accept them." Gongzi Mou fell silent for a long while, then withdrew, saying: "Let me return another day to discuss this further."

*You, a follower of Long*—meaning Gongzi Mou was a disciple of Long—*how could you not strain to gloss over his lapses?* *Lapses* refers to omissions. *Yet more egregious*—he pressed further, selecting the most extreme examples to make Mou recognize their absurdity.

*Intention arises from mind*—today he speaks of "intention without mind," though mind and intention are but different names. *Without intention, minds are the same*—for if one speaks of intention, it cannot be called mind; if one speaks of mind, it cannot be called intention. To say "without intention" is to say minds are the same, just as to say "with intention" is to say minds are the same—yet having intention does not make it mind.

*Pointing at one thing with the eye leaves many unpointed at*—hence "pointing occurs without reaching." But if nothing is pointed at, all is reached—hence "without pointing, all is reached."

*What exists is called a thing*—if one takes "having" as a thing, how can all things in the world be exhausted? If one does not take things as things, then all things in the world can be exhausted and possessed. Hence: "One who exhausts things always possesses them."

*That shadows do not move*—this is what Master Hui meant when he said the shadow of a flying bird never moves. *Explained by change*—this refers to movement. A thing has one shadow; as soon as it moves, the later shadow is not the earlier one. Seeking the earlier shadow from the later, one finds it in the moment before movement—hence "that shadows do not move is explained by change." *Change* means transformation, referring to the moment of alteration.

*A hair is most weak; a thousand jun, most heavy.* While a single hair cannot draw a thousand jun, if the force of the hair accumulates until it equals a thousand jun, then it can draw it—hence "equalized force." Though this is forced reasoning, it can be made coherent.

*White* is a color, named by its color. *Horse* is a form, named by its form. To call a color "white" is acceptable; to call a form "horse" is acceptable. But to call a white horse a horse is to confuse two things: white is color, horse is form. How can they be one? Hence: "A white horse is not a horse—form and name are separate." This aligns with the *Kong Congzi* and Gongsun Long’s own writings.

*Though an orphaned calf is born of a mother, while the mother lives it is not called orphaned; once called orphaned, it has never had a mother.* To call it "having a mother" means it is no orphaned calf. The *Zhuangzi* also contains similar passages.

*Orderly*—meaning methodical. Le Zhengzi Yu, angered by such forced sophistry and unable to refute it further, said: "Do you take all of Gongsun Long’s words as conforming to method?" *Another orifice*—a base or vulgar source—meaning if such words came from elsewhere, you would still accept them.

*"Let me return another day to discuss this further"*—akin to the modern saying, "Let us continue this another time." He withdrew in silent displeasure, unwilling to engage further.

When Yao ruled the world for fifty years, he did not know whether the world was well governed or not, nor whether the multitudes wished to support him or not. He asked his attendants—they did not know. He asked the outer court—they did not know. He asked those in the wilds—they did not know.

Yao then disguised himself and wandered through the bustling thoroughfares, where he heard children singing a folk rhyme:

*"He who establishes our teeming multitudes—*
*None but you set the ultimate norm.*
*Unknowing, unperceiving,*
*We follow the celestial pattern."*

Delighted, Yao asked, "Who taught you these words?"
The children replied, "We heard them from a grandee."
He questioned the grandee, who answered, "It is an ancient poem."

Yao returned to his palace, summoned Shun, and thereupon abdicated the realm to him. Shun accepted without demurral.

This passage depicts how the sage transforms the world without leaving any trace of transformation—though the world is transformed, none are aware of it. *"He who establishes us"* means he who brings us to life and sets us upright between heaven and earth. *"The ultimate norm"* is the Dao. *"The celestial"* refers to the principles of heaven. The poem was originally composed to praise Yao’s virtue, yet the grandee called it an *"ancient poem"*—this too illustrates how Yao and the world had become as one, oblivious to the source of such transformation. Thus, when Yao raised Shun and abdicated to him, and Shun accepted without refusal, it shows that Yao’s abdication and Shun’s acceptance both arose from non-deliberation.

Guan Yinxi said: *"Abiding nowhere within oneself,*
*Yet manifesting through things.*
*Its movement is like water,*
*Its stillness like a mirror,*
*Its response like an echo—*
*Thus is its Way like things themselves.*
*Things depart from the Dao,*
*But the Dao does not depart from things.*

*One who is good at the Way*
*Uses neither ears,*
*Nor eyes,*
*Nor strength,*
*Nor mind.*
*To seek the Dao through seeing, hearing, form, or intellect*
*Is to miss the mark.*

*Gazing ahead, it is suddenly behind;*
*Used, it fills the six directions;*
*Discarded, none know where it resides.*
*Neither the mindful can attain it from afar,*
*Nor the mindless draw near.*
*Only those who silently grasp it and let nature perfect it attain it—*
*Knowing yet forgetting emotion,*
*Capable yet not acting,*
*This is true knowledge, true capability.*

*If one acts from ignorance, how can there be true emotion?*
*If one acts from incapacity, what can be accomplished?*
*Like a clod of earth, like piled dust—*
*Though non-action, it is not the principle.*

*Abiding nowhere within oneself means no attachment.*
*Appearing with things, manifesting in use,*
*Formed through things, the Dao naturally becomes evident.*
*Its movement like water—no contrivance within.*
*Its stillness like a mirror—beauty and ugliness lie in things, not in oneself.*
*Responding to what comes, following sound,*
*It is naturally so.*

*Its Way is like things because it accords with them.*
*There is nothing that is not the Dao.*
*Those who do not know the Dao depart from it themselves—*
*How has the Dao ever departed from things?*

*Not using the ears—it is not attained through hearing.*
*Not using the eyes—it is not attained through seeing.*
*Not using strength—it is not attained through effort.*
*Not using the mind—it is not attained through thought.*
*To seek the Dao through sight, hearing, form, or intellect*
*Is to fail to grasp it rightly.*
*Form means the body, strength.*
*Intellect means mental deliberation.*

*Gazing ahead, it is suddenly behind—*
*It has no fixed place.*
*Used, it appears, filling the six directions;*
*Unused, it vanishes, and none know where it resides.*
*Those who seek with intent are far from the Dao—*
*How could the Dao be distant for the intentional?*
*Those who seek without intent are near the Dao—*
*How could the Dao ever be near for the unintentional?*

The Śramaṇa say: *"The Dao cannot be sought with intent,*
*Nor can it be attained without intent."*
This expresses the same idea.

*Silently grasping it, naturally awakening,*
*Nature perfecting it—this is innate knowledge.*
*Knowing through unknowing—thus, knowing yet forgetting emotion.*
*Capable through incapability—thus, capable yet not acting.*
*Unknowing is true knowledge;*
*Incapability is true capability.*

*"Acting"* here means *"turning toward"*—modern speech retains similar phrasing. Chan teachings say: *"No single thing is ever entirely so."* *"Emotion"* means reality. If one were utterly devoid of knowledge, how could one grasp reality? If one were utterly incapable, what could one accomplish? For to know through unknowing is not true ignorance—it is unknowing yet all-knowing. To be capable through incapability is not true incapacity—it is incapability yet all-capable. To act through non-action is not true inaction—it is inaction yet all-accomplishing. If one were like piled dust or a clod of earth, though non-acting, it would not accord with principle—meaning the principle of non-action is not like this.

From this perspective, how could the teachings of Zhuangzi and Liezi ever take withered wood or dead ashes as their ideal? Chan masters say: *"No night travel allowed—you must arrive by daylight. Revive only after death—no deceiving the sovereign."* This conveys the same meaning.

This passage is a major thread running through the books of Zhuangzi and Liezi.

*The Record of True Purity in the Five Patriarchs' Expository Treatises* states: *"A single thought—like the cold incense burner of an ancient temple in late autumn—becomes an obstruction to radiant clarity for ten thousand years."* This meaning is precisely the same.

This passage appears in *The Recorded Sayings of Dahui: General Teachings*. In the *"Below in the World"* chapter of *Zhuangzi*, the discussion of Tian Pian and Shen Dao—how a clod never loses the Dao—is called the learning of the dead. This, too, refers to the same "clod," meaning the clod of piled earth.

**Tang’s Fifth Inquiry**

King Tang of Yin asked Xia Ge: *"Did things exist in the primordial beginning?"*
Xia Ge replied: *"In the primordial beginning, there were no things—how could there be things now? Would later generations be right to say there are no things now?"*

King Tang asked: *"Then do things have no before or after?"*
Xia Ge replied: *"The end and beginning of things have no ultimate limit. What was once a beginning may become an end, and what was once an end may become a beginning—how could one know their boundary? Yet beyond things and before events, this I do not know."*

King Tang asked: *"Then do the eight directions—above and below—have limits?"*
Ge replied: *"I do not know."*
Tang pressed further.
Ge said: *"If there is nothing, then there is no limit; if there is something, then there is an end—how could I know this? Yet beyond the limitless there is no further limitlessness, and within the endless there is no further endlessness. The limitless has no further limitlessness, and the endless has no further endlessness—by this I know there is no limit and no end, yet I do not know if there is a limit or an end. Though things arise from nothing into being, once they exist, they must have a beginning—how can one say that in the primordial beginning there were no things? This phrasing is also well turned."*

*"Ji"* (极) means *"to reach an end."* The beginning and end of things have no fixed stopping point—just as spring precedes summer, yet when spring ends, summer begins. Is what came first truly the beginning? Is what follows truly the end? *"Ji"* (纪) means *"limit."* *"How could one know their limit?"* speaks of the limitless.

*"Beyond things and before events, this I do not know"* refers to the four directions and above and below, which cannot be fathomed—the *"six directions beyond"* of which *Zhuangzi* speaks, set aside and not discussed.

*"Pressed further"* means he questioned insistently, and only when forced did Ge reply: *"To call it nothing is to say it is limitless; once the name 'being' exists, there must be an end—but it cannot be known."* *"Beyond the limitless there is no further limitlessness"*—the following lines share the same vein as *Zhuangzi*’s *"There is a beginning,"* *"There is a time before that beginning,"* and *"There is a time before that time before the beginning."*

In *Zhuangzi*’s *"Free and Easy Wandering"* chapter, Tang questions Ji; here, he questions Xia Ge. *"Ji"* and *"Ge"* are near-homophones, likely a transmission error—but these are mostly allegorical, and differences in names need not be scrutinized.

Tang asked again: *"What exists beyond the four seas?"*
Ge replied: *"The same as the Central States."*
Tang said: *"How do you verify this?"*
Ge said: *"When I traveled east to Ying, the people were the same. Asking about what lay east of Ying, it was still like Ying. When I traveled west to Bin, the people were the same. Asking about what lay west of Bin, it was still like Bin. By this I know that the four seas, the four wastes, and the four poles are no different."*

Beyond the four seas, whether there are lands or no lands—this cannot be known. Just as one in Ying sees only Ying’s people, and one in Bin sees only Bin’s people, how could they know that east of Ying lies another Ying, or west of Bin lies another Bin? If even what is seen in the Central States is thus, how much more so beyond the four seas, the four wastes, and the four poles?

*"Central States"* refers to China. *"Verify"* means to use the near to illustrate the far. Beyond the seas lies the *"Great Waste,"* and beyond the Great Waste lies the *"Limitless"*—hence *"the four seas, the four wastes, the four poles."* Such discourse aims at vastness and grandeur. The books of Zhuangzi and Liezi are all like this—thus great and small contain one another without end.

What contains the myriad things is like what contains heaven and earth. Containing the myriad things is inexhaustible; containing heaven and earth is thus limitless. How could I know that beyond heaven and earth there are not greater heavens and earths? This, too, is what I do not know.

Great and small contain one another—like tiles on rafters, rafters on beams, beams on pillars, pillars on the ground. Small and large support things in succession, and all things are thus—beyond exhaustive inquiry.

Since all things are like this, then heaven and earth exist within the Great Vacuity. The Great Vacuity contains heaven and earth, and beyond the Great Vacuity there must be what contains the Great Vacuity. Since what contains the myriad things is inexhaustible, how could what contains heaven and earth have a limit? How could one know that beyond heaven and earth there is not something greater than heaven and earth?

*"Contain"* means *"to hold."* Such arguments reject narrow views. Those bound by self-interest do not grasp the vastness of the world, hence such empty and expansive discourse—though seemingly absurd, it has its own flavor. The following passages in this chapter are all like this; if one seeks principle in each, it cannot be done. To read the books of Zhuangzi and Liezi, one must see with a different eye.

Yet heaven and earth are also things. Things have insufficiencies, so in ancient times Nüwa smelted the five-colored stones to mend their gaps and severed the legs of the great turtle to prop up the four poles. Later, Gonggong contended with Zhuanxu for the throne, and in rage struck Mount Buzhou, breaking the pillar of heaven and severing the cords of earth. Thus heaven tilted to the northwest, and the sun, moon, and stars moved there; earth sank in the southeast, and the hundred rivers and floods flowed there.

Nüwa’s mending of heaven and Gonggong’s breaking of the pillar of heaven and severing of earth’s cords—these are all shocking claims, not to be taken as literal. Heaven’s tilt to the northwest is the subtlest work of creation. Without this leaning canopy, how could the movements of the stars, the waxing and waning of the sun and moon, or the alternation of day and night be manifest? This requires knowledge of astronomy. If one understands the theory of earth’s fourfold motion and that heaven is like an egg, how could there be pillars or cords?

Tang asked again: *"Do things have greatness and smallness? Do they have length and shortness?"*

"Do things share commonalities and differences?"

Ge said: "To the east of the Bohai Sea, beyond countless millions of *li*, lies a great abyss—truly a bottomless valley. Its depths know no end, and it is called the ‘Returning Gulch.’ The waters of the Eight Directions and Nine Wildernesses, the currents of the Celestial River—all pour into it, yet neither increase nor diminish. Within it stand five mountains: the first is Daiyu, the second Yuanqiao, the third Fanghu, the fourth Yingzhou, and the fifth Penglai. Each mountain rises and winds for thirty thousand *li*, its flat summit spanning nine thousand *li*. The distance between their midpoints is seventy thousand *li*, yet they are neighbors. Their terraces and pavilions are all of gold and jade; their birds and beasts, pure white. Trees of pearl and jade grow in clusters, their blossoms and fruits rich in flavor—whoever eats them never ages nor dies. The inhabitants are all of the seed of immortals and sages; day and night, those who fly between them are beyond counting.

Yet the roots of the five mountains have no anchor, drifting ceaselessly with the tides, rising and falling without pause. The immortals and sages, distressed, appealed to the Emperor. Fearing the mountains would drift to the westernmost reaches and scatter the dwellings of the sacred throng, he commanded Yuqiang to dispatch fifteen giant turtles to bear them on their heads. They took turns in three shifts, alternating every sixty thousand years. Only then did the five mountains stand firm and still.

But in the land of Longbo there lived giants whose strides spanned the five mountains in but a few steps. One cast his line and hooked six turtles at once, then carried them back to his country and scorched their bones to divine the future. Thus, the mountains Daiyu and Yuanqiao drifted to the northern pole, adrift in the great sea, and the immortals and sages who were displaced numbered in the countless millions. The Emperor, enraged, diminished the land of Longbo to narrow its bounds and shrank its people to shorten their stature. By the time of Fuxi and Shennong, its people still stood thousands of *zhang* tall.

The ‘Returning Gulch’ is none other than the ‘Tail Socket.’ The ‘Eight Directions’ are the eight cardinal points; the ‘Nine Wildernesses,’ the nine provinces. *Chungao* means pure white; *zhugan*, pearls and jade. *Zhi* means to halt. *Du zhi* means to suffer. Yuqiang is the name of a god. *He fu yi liu* means they bore the turtles away together. *Qu* means to go; *shu*, to count their bones. *Shi ai* means to make narrow. The immortals of the five mountains, the three shifts of the fifteen turtles, the giant of Longbo who fished for turtles, and the Emperor’s wrath—all are allegories. Many Buddhist scriptures contain the like, such as the Thirty-Three Heavens, the Land of Fragrant Accumulation, and the Western Pure Land.

Four hundred thousand *li* east of the Central States lies the land of Jiao Yao, where people stand but a foot and a half tall. In the far northeast lives a people called the Contentious, who measure nine inches. Though the people of Longbo were diminished, they still stood thousands of *zhang* tall; the Jiao Yao, a foot and a half; the Contentious, nine inches. The tallest reach the utmost in height, the shortest the utmost in shortness—yet this only shows that transformations between heaven and earth are not constant, and one cannot take what the eyes and ears perceive as fixed.

South of Jing lies the Dark Numinous, where five hundred years make a spring and five hundred years an autumn. In high antiquity stood the Great Camphor, where eight thousand years made a spring and eight thousand years an autumn. Upon rotting soil grow fungi and mushrooms that sprout at dawn and wither by dusk. In the spring and summer months appear midges and gnats, born with the rain and dying at the sun’s touch.

North of the Northernmost Peaks lies the Dark Sea—the Celestial Pond. There dwells a fish, thousands of *li* in breadth, its length proportionate, named the *Hun*. There too is a bird, named the *Peng*, its wings like clouds trailing from the sky, its body in equal measure. Who in the world would know of such creatures? Great Yu encountered them in his travels; Boyi named them; Yijian heard of them and recorded them."

The *Mingling* is the name of a tree. *Zhongfa* is the same as *qiongfa*—the farthest reaches of the north, a land ever more remote. *Cheng* is read in the falling tone, meaning its length matches its breadth. If its wings are so vast, its body must match them in scale—thus its enormity may be imagined. What mortals see is small; how could they know there are such boundless expanses in heaven and earth? These are all allegories, yet Yu and Yi lend them substance.

The world says the *Shanhaijing*’s *Dahuangjing* was written by Yu, much as people today claim Zhang Qian reached the Celestial River—its purpose merely to invoke Yu’s governance of the Nine Provinces and Boyi’s stewardship of mountains and marshes, thus lending credence to the tale. *Yijian* serves the same role as Zhuangzi’s *Qixie*.

Between the riverbanks grows a tiny insect called the *jiaoming*, swarming in flight to alight upon a mosquito’s lashes, jostling one another in a seething mass. The mosquito remains unaware as they come and go. Li Zhu and Zi Yu, though they rubbed their brows and strained their eyes in broad daylight, could not perceive its form; Jiao Hu, Chou Zhi, Wen Er, Pu Mi, and Shi Kuang, though they cupped their ears and bent their heads in the dead of night, could not catch its sound.

Only the Yellow Emperor and Rongchengzi dwelled upon the heights of Kongtong, aligning their spirits for three months, their hearts stilled and forms abandoned. Gradually, with vision of the spirit, they beheld it as a block—like the flank of Mount Song. Gradually, with hearing of qi, they perceived it with a crash—like the sound of thunder. Thus arose the contention of petty scholars and the discourse on the *jiaoming*, the smallest of the small.

Jiaohu Yu was also one of the ancients skilled in hearing. This aligns with Zhuangzi’s claim that listening with the ear is not as keen as listening with qi, and listening with qi is not as keen as listening with the heart.

In the lands of Wu and Chu there stands a great tree called the *you*, its verdant branches bearing fruit in winter, its crimson flesh tart to the taste. Drinking its sap cures the ailment of *fenjue*. The Central States prize it, yet when carried north across the Huai River, it transforms into the *zhu*. The stork does not cross the Ji River, and the raccoon dog perishes if it crosses the Wen—such is the nature of earthly qi.

Yet though forms and qi differ, their natures remain equal; none may exchange places, for all life is whole, and all portions are sufficient. How then do I discern the great from the small? The long from the short? The same from the different?

The *you* is the mandarin orange. These several lines echo the *Kaogong Ji*, illustrating the instability of form and qi, thereby revealing the workings of creation. Observing all things impartially, their natures are alike—each thing possesses its own nature, none may be interchanged. Each thing fulfills its life, each thing suffices in its allotted part. Whether great or small, long or short, all follow the principle of creation—what is different? What is the same? These lines stand firm in their rectitude.

*Yi* marks the end of speech.

The Taihang and Wangwu Mountains spanned seven hundred *li* square, towering ten thousand *ren* high, originally situated south of Jizhou and north of Heyang. There lived an old man of ninety from the Northern Mountains, named the Foolish Old Man, who dwelt facing the mountains. Vexed by the blockage to the north and the circuitous paths for entry and exit, he gathered his household to deliberate, saying: "Shall we join forces to level the perilous heights, open a passage south to Yu, and reach the northern bank of the Han River? Is this possible?" They all assented in unison.

His wife raised a doubt: "With your strength, you cannot even reduce the mound of Kuifu—how then can you move the Taihang and Wangwu? Moreover, where would you dispose of the earth and stones?" The assembly replied: "Cast them into the tail of the Bohai Sea, north of the Hidden Land." Thereupon, he led his children and grandchildren—three men capable of bearing loads—striking stones and tilling soil, transporting the debris in baskets to the tail of the Bohai Sea. The widow of the Jingcheng family from the neighborhood had a young orphan, just past his first teeth-shedding, who leapt forth to assist them. Winter and summer changed seasons before they made a single return trip.

The Wise Old Man of Hequ laughed and sought to dissuade them, saying: "How utterly lacking in wisdom you are! With your waning years and remaining strength, you cannot even strip a single hair from the mountain—what then can you do with the earth and stones?" The Foolish Old Man of the Northern Mountains sighed deeply and replied: "Your heart is so obstinate, so utterly impervious—you are not even the equal of a widow or a weak child. Though I may die, I have sons who survive. Sons beget grandsons, grandsons beget sons, sons again beget sons, and sons again beget grandsons—descendants without end. Yet the mountains will not grow taller. How then can they not be leveled?" The Wise Old Man of Hequ had no reply.

The Spirit Who Wields the Serpent heard of this and, fearing their unceasing efforts, reported it to the Emperor. Moved by their sincerity, the Emperor commanded the two sons of Kuafu to bear the two mountains away—one placed east of Shuofang, the other south of Yong. From then on, there were no more ridges or barriers south of Ji or north of the Han River.

Taihang is the same as Taihang, the names being phonetically similar. "Open a passage" means to clear a road southward. Hidden Land is a place name in the north. "Leapt forth" signifies rushing forward with vigor. "Changed seasons" refers to a full year. "Lacking in wisdom" means lacking understanding. "Obstinate" means closed off. Though the words of this passage may seem impractical, they vividly convey the unyielding resolve, which is deeply meaningful.

The Buddhist scriptures speak of the Bodhisattva Putuo, who in his early practice endured hardship and saw nothing. As he prepared to descend the mountain, he encountered a man by the water grinding an iron bar. Asking him, "What is the use of grinding this?" The man replied, "I will make it into a needle." The Bodhisattva laughed and said, "Are you not foolish? Can an iron bar be ground into a needle?" The man replied, "If not in this life, then in the next? If not in the next, then in the one after?" The Bodhisattva was greatly enlightened, returned to Putuo, and later attained the Way. Though such words may seem impractical, I have always found them meaningful and beneficial to scholars. If all people held such resolve, what task could not be accomplished? What learning could not be mastered?

Su Dongpo said: "Proceed gradually, and in ten years, what cannot be established? The only fear is that this resolve is not steadfast, or the effort not vigorous enough." Though Dongpo’s words seem simple, upon reflection, the unwavering diligence of Yao, the meticulous care of Shun, the daily renewal of Tang, and the ceaseless purity of King Wen—all arise from this single thought.

The Spirit Who Wields the Serpent and Kuafu are names of deities. "No ridges or barriers" means the land was entirely flat, without even small mounds or anthills.

Kuafu, overestimating his strength, sought to chase the sun’s shadow, pursuing it to the edge of Yugu. Thirsting for drink, he rushed to the Yellow and Wei Rivers, but they were insufficient. He then set out to drink from the Great Marsh in the north. Before reaching it, he died of thirst on the way. His abandoned staff, soaked in the fat and flesh of his corpse, grew into the Deng Forest. The Deng Forest spread thousands of *li* wide. Yugu is where the sun sets. Kuafu’s staff transformed into the Deng Forest, which stretched thousands of *li*—Kuafu was likely of the same kind as the Longbo giants. This must be an ancient legend of strange marvels, which the Daoist adepts incorporated into their texts as material for grand discourse.

Yu the Great said: "Within the Six Directions and the Four Seas, illuminated by the sun and moon, ordered by the stars, governed by the four seasons, and constrained by the Great Year—all things born of the divine and spiritual take their forms, some dying young, some living long. Only the sage can comprehend their principles."

Xia Ge replied: "Yet there are also those not born of the divine and spiritual, not shaped by yin and yang, not illuminated by the sun and moon, not cut short by violence, not prolonged by nurture, not nourished by the five grains, not clothed in silk and floss, not conveyed by boats and carts. Their Way is natural, beyond the sage’s comprehension."

Xia Ge engaged in dialogue with Tang and later with Yu—were these two different Xia Ges? Or the same one? If the same, he must have lived for hundreds or thousands of years.

"Born of the divine and spiritual" refers to the sun, moon, yin, yang, and the Great Year. The previous passage concludes with the divine and spiritual, while this one begins with it—such is the flow of the text.

Yu said: "All things with form, whether dying young or living long, have their principles, which only the sage fully understands." Ge replied: "Yet there are also those not dependent on yin and yang or the sun and moon to exist. Stone eggs and stone seeds—what need have they for the qi of yin and yang? Earth ants and ground dragons—what need have they for the light of the sun and moon? Morning mushrooms and cicadas—do they die young by violence? Pines and cypresses of the southern mountains—do they live long by nurture? Moths and reeds—do they eat the five grains to be full? Oxen and horses—do they wear silk and floss to be warm? Birds—do they ride boats and carts to travel?"

These phenomena arise of themselves, beyond the reach of ordinary reason—even the sage cannot fully comprehend them.

The *Tai Sui* is the spirit that governs the year. The practice of divination by days has existed since antiquity, yet this illustrates how some matters in the world may be deduced by common principles, while others defy them—such is the marvel of creation’s workings.

When Yu governed the waters and lands, he became lost and strayed into a foreign realm. North of the northern sea, beyond the known distance of thousands or tens of thousands of *li* from the Central States, lay a land called *Zhongbei*, its borders unbounded, its limits uncharted. There, no wind or rain, frost or dew fell, nor did birds, beasts, insects, fish, grasses, or trees grow. All directions stretched flat, encircled by towering ridges.

At the land’s center stood a mountain named *Huling*, shaped like an overturned jar. At its summit yawned an opening, round as a ring, called the *Zi Xue* ("Nourishing Cavern"). From it gushed forth a spring named *Shenfen* ("Divine Spring"), its fragrance surpassing orchid and pepper, its taste richer than fine wine. A single source divided into four channels, flowing down the mountain to irrigate the entire land without exception.

The earth’s *qi* was harmonious, sparing the people from plague or affliction. Their nature was gentle, yielding to things without contention; their hearts were soft, their bones supple, free from arrogance or envy. Young and old dwelled together without rulers or subjects; men and women mingled freely without matchmakers or betrothals. They settled along the waters, neither plowing nor sowing; the earth’s warmth sufficed, so they neither wove nor wore clothes. They lived a hundred years without premature death or illness.

Their people multiplied endlessly, ever joyful, never aging or sorrowful. Fond of music, they clasped hands and sang in turns, their voices unceasing all day. When hungry or weary, they drank from the *Shenfen*, their strength and spirits harmonized. If they overindulged, they grew drunk, waking only after ten days. Bathing in the *Shenfen* left their skin sleek and lustrous, its fragrance lingering for ten days.

*Zhongbei* lay at the world’s northernmost extreme—*Qi* means "limit."

Limit means extremity. Its borders stretch without end or bound. *Qiaozhi* is a lofty mountain; *Huling* belongs to the same class as *Fanghu* and *Yuanqiao*. *Danzhui* are earthenware vessels. The waters of *Zixue* are called *Shenfen*, flowing from a single source yet branching to all four sides. *Lie* means "boundary." "Encircling a kingdom" describes how this water winds around a land. "Gentle and yielding to things" means compliance. "Weak bones" means no striving for contention. *Zifu* means to multiply; *fu* means abundance. From "its fragrance lingering for ten days" onward, this passage recounts what Yu witnessed.

King Mu of Zhou journeyed north and passed through that land, lingering for three years and forgetting to return. Once back in the Zhou court, he longed for that kingdom, lost in melancholy. He refused wine and meat, summoned no concubines, and only after months did he recover. This account, building upon the legend of King Mu’s eight steeds, adds further testimony.

Guan Zhong urged Duke Huan of Qi to follow the example of the northern expedition, nearly succeeding in reaching that land. Xi Peng remonstrated: "My lord, why forsake the vastness of Qi, its teeming people, its majestic mountains and rivers, its fertile lands, its flourishing rites and virtues, its splendid robes, its palace filled with beauty, its court brimming with loyal ministers? With a shout, a million soldiers rise; with a gesture, the feudal lords obey. Why envy that land and abandon Qi’s altars of soil and grain to follow barbarians?" He continued: "Is this the senility of our elder statesman? How can you heed such counsel?" Duke Huan desisted and relayed Xi Peng’s words to Guan Zhong. Guan replied: "This is beyond Peng’s understanding. I fear that land cannot be ascended. Why cling to Qi’s wealth? Why heed Peng’s words?" This passage also alludes to Qi’s southward voyage along the coast to Langya.

"Nearly succeeding" means they almost set out at once. "Shouting at will" means issuing commands with unrestrained authority. "Directing with a glance" means guiding troops with a mere look. "That land cannot be ascended" means they feared it might prove unattainable. Such words merely suggest that beyond the known world lie realms surpassing human perception.

In the southern lands, people shave their heads and go bare; in the north, they wear felt caps and furs; in the Central States, they don crowns and robes. Across the nine domains, people rely on farming or trade, tilling or fishing—winter furs and summer linen, boats for water and carts for land—all acquired instinctively, shaped by nature. This idea appears elsewhere in my writings. Beyond the Central States, customs differ, and ways of dress and sustenance vary. Each follows its nature and finds joy in it. This is no different: it merely broadens what people have seen.

East of Yue lies the land of *Zhexiu*, where the eldest son is slaughtered and eaten at birth, deemed "fitting for younger brothers." When a grandfather dies, they carry the grandmother away and abandon her, saying: "A ghost’s wife cannot dwell with the living." South of Chu lies the land of the *Yanren*, where upon a relative’s death, they carve and share the flesh before discarding it, then bury the bones, thus becoming filial. West of Qin lies the land of *Yiqu* and *Wenkang*, where upon a relative’s death, they pile firewood and burn the body. The rising smoke is called "ascending afar," and only then are they deemed filial. Such practices govern both governance above and customs below, yet they are not so strange.

*Zhexiu*, *Yanren*, and *Yiqu* are all names of lands. *Xiu* means "to carve." This passage also appears in the *Mozi*; the *Annals of the Eastern Yi* from the Two Han and the records of the Jin dynasty contain similar accounts. Liezi’s intent is simply this: within the world, lands differ, and customs vary. Must all resemble the Central States to be deemed good? What we cherish, how do we know it is not what they despise?

Confucius traveled east and saw two children arguing. He asked why. One child said: "I believe the sun is nearer at dawn and farther at noon." The other insisted the opposite: "The sun is farther at dawn and nearer at noon." The first child argued: "At dawn, the sun is as large as a carriage canopy, but at noon, it shrinks to the size of a plate or bowl. Is this not proof that what is far appears small, and what is near appears large?" The second child countered: "At dawn, the sun is cool and refreshing, but at noon, it burns like boiling water. Is this not proof that what is near is hot, and what is far is cool?" Confucius could not decide. The children laughed: "Who says you are so wise?" This debate resembles the argument between Prince Chang’an of Jin and others over the sun’s distance.

The passage’s meaning is that near and far, right and wrong, cannot be settled by a single principle. Balance is the supreme principle of the world. Even in tangible things, this holds true. When hair is evenly weighted and suspended, it may bear a load without breaking; if uneven, it snaps. If balanced, it will not break even when strained. Some deny this, but there are those who know its truth.

This passage introduces the concept of *balance*: the supreme principle of the world applies even to all things with form. *Lian* means "all." *Xingwu* refers to tangible things. "This holds true" means that just as the principle applies, so do things. When hair is evenly suspended, it can bear weight, hence "evenly weighted, evenly suspended." If the load is uneven, the hair breaks. The cause of breaking is imbalance, hence "uneven weight causes breaking, for it is not balanced." If weight is evenly distributed, it will not break even when strained, hence "balanced, it will not break." This line is particularly profound. "Balanced" is one phrase; "it will not break" is another.

This expounds the argument of Gongsun Long regarding a single hair lifting a thousand *jun*. Most people deem it impossible, yet there are those who recognize its truth—meaning the world at large remains unaware, while those who understand the Dao know its validity.

Zhan He, using a single silkworm’s thread for line, a needle’s barb for hook, a bramble stalk for rod, and a grain husk for bait, drew forth fish as large as carts from abyssal depths and rushing currents. His line never snapped, his hook never bent, his rod never bowed. The King of Chu, hearing of this marvel, summoned him to inquire the reason.

Zhan He replied: "I recall the words of my late master. When Pujuzi shot birds, he used a supple bow and fine cord, riding the wind to strike, bringing down a pair of wagtails amid the azure clouds. His mind was single, his hand steady and balanced. I took his method as my model and applied it to angling, mastering its Way only after five years. When I stand by the river with rod in hand, my heart holds no stray thoughts—only the fish. Casting the line and sinking the hook, my hand moves with neither lightness nor heaviness, and nothing can disturb it. To the fish, my hook and bait appear no more than drifting dust or gathered foam, swallowed without hesitation. Thus the weak overcomes the strong, the light attains the heavy. If Your Majesty governs the state with such focus, the realm may be held in the palm of one’s hand—what further effort would be needed?"

The king said, "Well spoken."

Zhan He’s angling, Pujuzi’s archery, and the Hunchback Elder’s cicada-catching share a common principle: governing a state or the world is like stilling the mind—without force or weakness, without lightness or weight. The weak may then overcome the strong, the light may overcome the heavy, echoing Laozi’s teaching that the yielding prevails over the rigid.

Lu Gongfu and Zhao Qiying, both afflicted with illness, sought treatment from Bian Que. Bian Que healed them.

Having cured them both, Bian Que addressed Gongfu and Qiying: "The illnesses you suffered before were external invasions of the six bowels and five viscera, readily healed by medicine and stone. Now, however, you bear afflictions born with your bodies, grown with your growth. If I were to treat these for you, how would you respond?"

The two replied, "We would first hear the proof."

Bian Que said to Gongfu, "Your will is strong but your qi weak—thus you excel in planning yet falter in decision." To Qiying he said, "Your will is weak but your qi strong—thus you lack forethought yet act with reckless force. Were I to exchange your hearts, both would attain balance in virtue."

Thereupon Bian Que gave them a poisoned wine to drink, plunging them into a three-day stupor. He split open their chests, extracted their hearts, swapped them, and restored them; then administered a divine medicine. When they awoke, they were as before, and took their leave to return home.

Yet Gongfu went to Qiying’s house and claimed his wife and children, who did not recognize him. Likewise, Qiying went to Gongfu’s house and claimed his wife and children, who also did not recognize him. The two households then brought suit against each other, seeking Bian Que’s judgment.

Bian Que explained the cause, and the dispute was settled.

This passage depicts how the heart is shaped by qi, leaving one not entirely free. Its words carry profound meaning—though seemingly impractical, they are not. As Master Mingdao said: "Of the one hundred and four illnesses, all arise from another’s heart; only when they begin in mine may they be mastered." This teaching rises even higher.

Liezi’s analogy speaks of the heart of qi-nature; Mingdao’s words, of the heart of principle. Only by transforming the heart of qi-nature with the heart of principle may one attain true freedom.

When Huba played the zither, birds danced and fish leapt. Hearing of this, Zheng Shiwen abandoned his home to study under Master Xiang.

Pressing his fingers upon the pegs to tune the seventh string, for three years he could not complete a single piece. Master Xiang said, "You may return home now." Shiwen set aside his zither and sighed, "It is not that my fingers cannot tune the strings, nor that I cannot complete a piece. What I seek lies not in the strings, nor does my aspiration rest in sound. Within, it does not settle in my heart; without, it does not respond to qi. Thus I dare not lift my hand to strike the strings. Grant me a little more time to observe what follows."

Before long, he again sought out Master Xiang. Master Xiang asked, "How fares your zither now?" Shiwen replied, "I have grasped it. Pray, let me demonstrate." Thereupon, in spring, he struck the *shang* string to summon *Nanlü*—a chill wind suddenly arose, and plants bore fruit. In autumn, he struck the *jiao* string to rouse *Jiazhong*—a warm breeze gently returned, and plants flourished. In summer, he struck the *yu* string to invoke *Huangzhong*—frost and snow fell together, and rivers and ponds froze over. In winter, he struck the *zhi* string to harmonize with *Rui Bin*—the sun’s rays blazed fiercely, and solid ice instantly melted. As the piece drew to a close, he commanded the *gong* string to unite the four, and a balmy breeze soared, auspicious clouds floated, sweet dew descended, and sweet springs welled forth.

Master Xiang then clapped his chest and leapt in praise, exclaiming, "How subtle is your playing! Even Shi Kuang’s *Qingjiao* or Zou Yan’s breath through the pitch-pipes cannot surpass it. They would take up zither and flute to follow in your wake."

"Not completing a piece" means he could not yet finish even one melody. "Pressing his fingers upon the pegs" refers to steadying his fingers, and "tuning the strings" to adjusting them. "Lies not in the strings, nor does my aspiration rest in sound" signifies that his heart was not yet at ease. When the heart is settled and the hands respond, one forgets the instrument. Until this is achieved, he dared not move the strings. "Grant me a little more time" means a brief respite, and "to observe what follows" to see how things would unfold afterward.

In spring, he played an autumnal sound, and autumnal qi responded; in autumn, he played a vernal sound, and vernal qi responded; in summer, he played a wintry sound, and wintry qi responded; in winter, he played a summery sound, and summery qi responded. The *shang* string belongs to autumn, the *jiao* to spring, the *yu* to winter, and the *zhi* to summer. *Gong* is the central tone, thus harmonious qi answered. The zither has five strings, each governing one note. When it says he struck a particular string, it does not mean he played only one while neglecting the others, but rather that a given piece was led by *shang*, another by *jiao*, and so on. This illustrates how the marvel of sound can penetrate the workings of creation.

Shiwen’s visits to Master Xiang seem to occur within a single day—how could he traverse all four seasons, striking and eliciting responses in turn? From this, we may know it is an allegory.

"How subtle is your playing" means his zither playing was exquisitely subtle. *Qingjiao* is the name of a melody. "Take up zither and flute to follow in your wake" means that even Shi Kuang and Zou Yan would have to study under him.

Xue Tan learned singing from Qin Qing but had not mastered his teacher’s skill. Believing he had exhausted it, he took his leave to return home. Qin Qing did not stop him. At the crossroads outside the city, he gave a farewell feast, beating time and singing a mournful song. The sound shook the trees, and its resonance halted the passing clouds. Xue Tan then apologized and begged to return, vowing never again to speak of leaving. Qin Qing turned to his friends and said, "Long ago, Han E traveled east to Qi, her provisions exhausted. Passing through Yongmen, she sold her songs to beg for food. After she left, her lingering notes clung to the roof beams for three days without fading, and the townsfolk thought she had not yet departed. When she stayed at an inn, the innkeeper insulted her. Han E then let forth a long, sorrowful wail, and the elders and children of the village grieved, weeping face to face, going three days without eating. They hastily pursued her. When Han E returned, she sang a long, joyous song, and the villagers leapt and danced, unable to restrain themselves, forgetting their former sorrow. They then richly rewarded and sent her on her way. Thus, to this day, the people of Yongmen are skilled in singing and weeping, imitating Han E’s lingering tones."

"Beating time" means keeping the rhythm. "Provisions exhausted" means lacking supplies. "Sold her songs to beg for food" means she sang to earn her meals. "Sent her on her way" means they thanked and escorted her. This story also appears in the *Mencius*.

Building upon Master Wen’s discourse on the zither, the account now turns to the matter of singers, recording both to illustrate how the mastery of craft may attain such divine wonder. If mere skill can achieve this, how much more might those who study the Dao attain the supremely divine and wondrous? This is the unspoken implication.

Boya excelled at playing the zither, while Zhong Ziqi excelled at listening. When Boya played, his intent was upon the lofty mountains. Zhong Ziqi said, “How splendid! Towering like Mount Tai!” When his intent was upon flowing waters, Zhong Ziqi said, “How splendid! Vast like the Yangtze and Yellow River!” Whatever Boya conceived in his mind, Zhong Ziqi invariably grasped.

Once, Boya traveled to the northern slopes of Mount Tai when suddenly a violent storm arose. He took shelter beneath a cliff, and his heart grew sorrowful. Taking up his zither, he began to play. First came the melody *Endless Rain*, then he composed the sound *Mountain’s Collapse*. With each piece he performed, Zhong Ziqi exhaustively fathomed its essence. Boya then set aside his zither and sighed, “How splendid! How splendid! Your listening is truly remarkable. Your thoughts and imaginings are as my own heart. How could I ever conceal my music from you?”

*Endless Rain* and *Mountain’s Collapse* are both names of zither compositions. “Your thoughts and imaginings” refers to Zhong Ziqi, meaning his heart was one with Boya’s. Since music arises from the heart, if your heart is the same as mine, you naturally understand my music. “How could I conceal?” means there is no hiding it. This tale, handed down from ancient times, was adopted into the text to illustrate that in all things under heaven, whether refined or coarse, there exists the possibility of attaining divine wonder.

King Mu of Zhou, on his western expedition, crossed the Kunlun Mountains but did not reach Yan Mountain. On his return journey, before reaching the Central States, he encountered a craftsman named Yan Shi who had come to offer his services. The king received him and asked, “What skills do you possess?” Yan Shi replied, “Your servant will attempt whatever Your Majesty commands. However, I have already created something I wish you to see first.” The king said, “Come together tomorrow, and we shall both observe it.”

The next day, Yan Shi presented himself to the king, who received him and asked, “Who is the person accompanying you?” He replied, “This is a singing and dancing performer I have created.” The king gazed at it in astonishment. It walked, bowed, and lifted its head, behaving exactly like a real person. When the craftsman pressed its chin, it sang in perfect harmony with the rhythm. When he took its hand, it danced in precise accord with the beat, transforming endlessly at will. The king believed it to be a real person and, together with Lady Sheng and his inner attendants, observed it closely.

As the performance neared its end, the performer winked at the king’s concubines on his left and right. The king grew furious and was about to execute Yan Shi on the spot. Terrified, Yan Shi immediately disassembled the performer before the king’s eyes, revealing it to be an assemblage of leather, wood, glue, lacquer, white, black, red, and blue materials. The king examined it carefully: within were liver, gallbladder, heart, lungs, spleen, kidneys, intestines, and stomach; without were sinews, bones, joints, skin, hair, teeth, and nails—all artificial yet perfectly complete. When reassembled, it appeared as it had at first.

The king then tested it: when he disabled its heart, its mouth could not speak; when he disabled its liver, its eyes could not see; when he disabled its kidneys, its feet could not walk. King Mu at last marveled and sighed, "Can human skill truly rival the work of creation?" He ordered his secondary chariot to carry it back.

Now, Lu Ban’s cloud ladder and Mo Di’s flying kite were deemed the pinnacle of their craft. Yet when their disciples Dongmen Jia and Qin Guli heard of Yan Shi’s skill, they dared not speak of their own arts for the rest of their lives, and from then on wielded only compass and square.

Yanshan lies west of Kunlun.

*Jian* means "to present." In the *Book of Han*, *jinshen* is written with *jian* as well.

"To come together tomorrow" means to arrive in company the next day.

Its every movement—hurrying, stepping, bowing, rising—was entirely lifelike.

*Xin* means "truly."

The king marveled at the artisan’s skill.

*Zhen* means "to press."

When its mouth was pressed to make it sing, its voice harmonized with the pitch; when its hands were taken to make it dance, its steps matched the rhythm. At first, it seemed merely to resemble a person, but after a time, it became indistinguishable from one.

Lady Sheng was one among the king’s many consorts.

*Zhao* means "to tease."

*Di* means "to examine closely."

*Liao* means "to inspect."

"Reassembled as before" means that after being disassembled, it was put back together, and its singing and dancing were just as they had been at first.

That a wooden figure could walk and dance was astonishing enough—how then did it produce sound? This suggests that the human body, too, is but an assemblage of parts: the eyes correspond to the liver, the feet to the kidneys, the mouth to the heart—none of it truly under one’s control. The Buddhist doctrine of the Four Elements is not unlike this.

If human skill can rival creation, how much greater is the skill of creation itself?

The secondary chariot was a spare carriage.

The cloud ladder was a siege engine; the flying kite was also made of wood. This is akin to the wooden ball of Snow Peak.

Lu Ban and Mo Di considered their works the height of craftsmanship. Yet compared to Yan Shi, their skills were nothing—so much so that they never again dared claim mastery of their arts. "From time to time wielding compass and square" means that the two abandoned their crafts, resorting to them only when necessary.

Dongmen Jia and Qin Guli were the names of the two disciples.

Gan Ying was an ancient master archer who, when he drew his bow, caused beasts to crouch and birds to descend. His disciple, Fei Wei, learned archery from him and surpassed his teacher. Another disciple, Ji Chang, studied under Fei Wei.

Fei Wei said to him, "First learn not to blink, and only then may we speak of archery." Ji Chang returned home and lay beneath his wife’s loom, gazing upward at the heddle rod. After two years, even when a needle’s tip was turned toward his eye, he did not blink. He told this to Fei Wei.

Fei Wei said, "Not yet. Next, learn to see, and only then may you return." He instructed him to see the small as large, the faint as clear, and only then report back. Ji Chang hung a louse from the window with a yak’s hair and faced south to observe it. Within ten days, it gradually grew larger; after three years, it was like a cartwheel. When he looked at other things, they all appeared as mountains and hills. Then he took a bow of Yan horn and an arrow of northern reeds and shot the louse, piercing its heart while the hair remained unbroken. He told this to Fei Wei.

Fei Wei leapt up, clapped his chest, and exclaimed, "You have mastered it!"

The heddle rod was the part of the loom that moved up and down with the treadles. Though a needle’s tip was turned toward his eye, he did not blink—just as Mencius spoke of "not fleeing from the eye."

"Next, learn to see" means to proceed step by step, to further refine his vision.

Once the louse appeared as large as a cartwheel, all other things seemed like mountains and hills.

The bow of Yan horn was made from the horn of a Yan ox; the arrow of northern reeds was made from the reeds of the northern plains. These were the finest of bows and arrows.

To shoot a louse as if it were a cartwheel—such precision in craft is like Bian Que, who could see through walls. Truly extraordinary.

In all worldly matters, without mastery, one cannot speak of them.

After Ji Chang had mastered Fei Wei’s techniques, he calculated that only one man in the world could rival him and plotted to kill Fei Wei. They met in the wilds, and the two exchanged arrows. Midway, their arrowheads clashed and fell to the ground without stirring dust. Fei Wei’s arrows were exhausted first. Ji Chang loosed one more, but as it flew, Fei Wei deflected it with the tip of a thorn, not missing by a hair. Thereupon, the two wept, cast aside their bows, bowed to each other on the road, and pledged to become father and son. They cut their arms and swore an oath never to reveal this to outsiders.

"Their arrows clashed midway" means they shot at each other on the road. Their arrows met and fell to the ground, dust undisturbed, so evenly did they land.

To deflect an incoming arrow with the tip of a thorn and meet it without error—such was their skill.

"Cutting their arms" means they sliced their arms as a mark of their oath.

This tale seems far-fetched.

Once, while traveling along the Huai River, I met a man who divided the paths at Xuanlu. He was nearly seventy years old and had won first place in the *Spring and Autumn Grand Review* every year. He once told me: "When I first captured Wang Xin, we met in the mountains of Liu’an. Wang Xin drew his bow to shoot me. All I held was a short wooden spear. I called out to him: ‘Here, I’ll let you loose three arrows. If you miss, surrender to me, and I’ll take you to Prefect Zhao to secure you an official post.’ Wang Xin loosed three arrows, but I struck each one down with my spear. He then bowed to me. Later, Wang Xin became the military commissioner of Guangzhou. When I arrived in Anfeng, one of Wang Xin’s former officers also recounted this tale, matching the account I had heard from the old man."

The old man’s name has slipped my mind. Yet if even the archery exchanges of Jichang and Fei Wei are not to be dismissed as fabrications, then how much more must this be true?

Zaofu’s master was called Taidou. When Zaofu first began his apprenticeship in charioteering, he observed the rites with utmost humility; Taidou gave no instruction for three years. Zaofu’s reverence only deepened, until at last Taidou spoke: “An ancient poem says, ‘The son of a master bowyer must first weave baskets; the son of a master smith must first sew furs.’ First observe my gait. When your gait matches mine, then you may grasp the six reins and drive the six horses.” Zaofu replied, “I shall follow your command.”

Taidou then planted wooden stakes to form a path barely wide enough for a foot. He measured the steps and placed them, then walked the line, pacing back and forth without stumbling. Zaofu learned this in three days, mastering its intricacy. Taidou sighed, “How swift your grasp! You have acquired it with such speed. All charioteering is like this. When you walked just now, you gained it through your feet, and your heart responded. Extend this to driving: harmony in the reins and bit, swiftness or slowness in the harmony of the lips; correct measure within the chest, and rhythmic control in the hands. Inwardly centered in the heart, outwardly aligned with the horse’s intent—thus you may advance and retreat along a cord’s breadth, turn in perfect arcs, traverse great distances with energy to spare, truly mastering the art.

Gained through the bit, it responds in the reins; gained through the reins, it responds in the hands; gained through the hands, it responds in the heart. Then you need not rely on sight or whip; the mind is at ease, the body aligned, the six reins untangled, and the twenty-four hooves strike without error. In turning, advancing, or retreating, all is in perfect measure. Beyond the wheels’ track, no trace remains; beyond the horses’ hooves, no ground is wasted. Neither steep valleys nor level plains are perceived as different—they are as one.

My art is exhausted; remember it well.” Taidou was indeed one of the ancient masters of charioteering.

“Fur and basket” is an old saying, already seen in the *Record of Learning*. Learning archery begins with basket-weaving—both are bamboo crafts. *Ye* means metalworking; what does it have to do with fur? This phrase has long been obscure. Yet the *Artificers’ Record* mentions a “Fur Official,” though his duties are unknown. Since the post is now vacant, perhaps his role once related to smithing—now lost to time.

“Observe my gait” means to learn his way of walking. “Acquired it swiftly” refers to his rapid mastery.

The reins and bit rest in the horse’s mouth; the chest and hands belong to the driver. “Walking the cord and turning” means that though the path is as narrow as a cord, one may still turn upon it. “Perfect arcs” means mastery in alignment. “Energy to spare” means the driver is not wearied—akin to the *Artificers’ Record*’s saying, “his lap does not cover [the reins].” “Mind at ease, body aligned” describes the driver’s composure. “Twenty-four hooves” refers to a six-horse chariot. “Strike without error” means the horses move in unison. *Zhe* means the track, the path the chariot follows. “No trace beyond the wheels” means the chariot does not stray from the track. “No ground beyond the hooves” means that if the hooves do not falter, no extra space is needed. Though mountains and valleys are perilous, plains and lowlands level, to the driver they are all the same.

Walking on wooden stakes may seem far-fetched, but seeing acrobats today who climb poles, tread ropes, and balance with ease, we know such feats exist. When *Liezi* recounts this, it is merely to show that even worldly skills attain such marvels—how much more so the Dao?

Wei Hei Luan killed Qiu Bingzhang out of personal enmity. Bingzhang’s son, Lai Dan, vowed to avenge his father. Dan’s qi was fierce, his form exposed; he ate by counting grains, moved with the wind, and though enraged, could not match Qiu’s strength to exact revenge. Ashamed to borrow another’s power, he swore to slay Hei Luan with his own hands.

Hei Luan’s ferocity surpassed all others; his strength equaled a hundred men. His sinews, bones, skin, and flesh were not of mortal kind. He stretched his neck to meet blades, bared his chest to arrows, and though blades bent against him, his body bore no mark. Confident in his might, he regarded Lai Dan as a mere fledgling.

Lai Dan’s friend Shen Ta said, “Your hatred for Hei Luan is profound, and his disdain for you is extreme. What plan will you devise?” Lai Dan wept, “I beg you to counsel me.” Shen Ta replied, “I have heard that Kong Zhou of Wei, a descendant of his lineage, possesses a treasure sword from the Yin emperor. When a mere boy wielded it, he repelled an entire army. Why not seek his aid?”

Lai Dan then traveled to Wei and met Kong Zhou, serving him with the rites of a groom. He first entrusted his wife and children to Kong, then stated his request. Kong Zhou said, “I have three swords; choose as you will. None can kill a man, but first let me describe them.

The first is called *Han Guang* (Containing Light). It cannot be seen when looked upon, and its presence is unknown when wielded. Where it touches, all is indistinct, passing through things without their awareness.

The second is called *Cheng Ying* (Bearing Shadow). At the cusp of dawn, in the dim light between night and day, or at dusk, when light and dark mingle, if you face north and observe it, it appears faintly as if something exists, though its form cannot be discerned. Where it touches, there is a faint sound, passing through things without harming them.

The third is called *Xiao Lian* (Night Forged). By day, its shadow is visible but not its light; by night, its light is visible but not its form. Where it touches, it passes swiftly, sealing the wound as it goes, cutting without drawing blood.

These three treasures have been passed down for thirteen generations, yet never put to use. They lie sealed in their caskets, never opened.” Lai Dan said, “Even so, I must request the lowest of them.”

Kong Zhou then returned Lai Dan’s wife and children and fasted with him for seven days. At dusk, he knelt and presented the lowest sword. Lai Dan bowed twice, received it, and departed.

Lai Dan then grasped the sword and followed Black Egg. At that moment, Black Egg lay drunk beneath the window, and Lai Dan struck him three times from neck to waist. Black Egg remained unaware. Taking Black Egg’s death for granted, Lai Dan hurried away. At the gate, he encountered Black Egg’s son and struck him three times, as if swinging into emptiness. Black Egg’s son laughed and said, “Why so foolish as to wave at me thrice?” Lai Dan, realizing the sword could not kill, sighed and returned home.

When Black Egg awoke, he raged at his wife, “You let me drink until I exposed myself, leaving my throat sore and my waist stiff.” His son said, “Earlier, Lai Dan came and met me at the gate, waving at me three times. It left my body aching and my limbs rigid—he must have cursed me.” *Nìxián* refers to private grudges. His qi was fierce, his might sharp. His form was exposed, his frame gaunt. Fleeing with the wind, his steps were weak. His resolve surpassed all, his courage and ferocity unmatched. *Héntà* means marks or traces. *Chúkòu* refers to newly hatched birds. “Exchanging children” is a grave insult. The names of the three swords are regional terms for hexing techniques. *Mǐnrán wú jì* means vanishing without trace or boundary. *Jiāng dàn mèi shuǎng zhī jiāo* is the moment when dawn breaks and the sun rises. *Dàn xī hūn míng zhī jì* is the time when day fades into dusk. *Dàn xī* means “evening.” *Hūn míng* is the threshold between darkness and light. By day, only its shadow appears; by night, only its light—no form at all. *Mǎ shàn* should be written as *huō*. *Huōrán* describes a faint sound.

Seeking his inferior, he requested the third sword. Taking advantage of his drunkenness, he struck him down, suspecting him already dead, and swiftly departed. The blow fell as if into emptiness—his sword passed through as though through nothing.

*Chī* is akin to *chī* (foolish). The three strikes of Dan were taken by his opponent as mere feints, like child’s play. *Ài jí* refers to a constricted throat. *Zhī qiáng* describes limbs stiff and unyielding, lacking suppleness.

This illustrates that even hexing arts possess numinous efficacy—how much more so the study of the Dao? Such accounts, when included in these writings, carry deliberate intent; they are not mere boastful or exaggerated speech.

King Mu of Zhou launched a great campaign against the Western Rong, who presented him with the *Kūnwú* sword and fire-washed cloth. The sword measured a foot and a span, its blade forged of refined steel with a crimson edge, capable of slicing jade as though it were mud. The fire-washed cloth, when laundered, must be cast into fire; the cloth turns the color of flame, while the grime takes on the cloth’s hue. Removed from the fire and shaken, it gleams as dazzlingly as snow.

The prince deemed such objects nonexistent, dismissing their chroniclers as fabricators. Xiao Shu remarked: “The prince is indeed resolute in his convictions—yet resolute, too, in his distortion of reason!” *Liàn gāng* refers to tempered steel. *Chì rèn* denotes the essence of metal, its hue crimson. *Rú qiē ní* describes its softness. Though swords that cut jade remain unseen today, fire-washed cloth is still witnessed in the world—such marvels do exist.

To be “resolute in self-trust” is to rely solely on what one’s eyes and ears perceive, unaware of the numinous wonders beyond, and thus dismissing their chroniclers as false—this is a distortion of reason. The preceding exposition concludes here with these two lines, observing that those who doubt such vast and wondrous accounts do so from the limits of their own narrow perspective, lacking true understanding of principle.

**Chapter Six: Strength and Fate**

Strength addressed Fate, saying: “What are your achievements compared to mine?”
Fate replied: “What have you done for things that you would compare yourself to me?”
Strength said: “Longevity or early death, success or failure, nobility or lowliness, wealth or poverty—all lie within my power.”
Fate said: “The wisdom of Peng Zu did not surpass that of Yao or Shun, yet he lived eight hundred years. The talent of Yan Yuan did not fall below that of the common crowd, yet he died at eighteen. The virtue of Confucius did not rank beneath that of the feudal lords, yet he was besieged in Chen and Cai. The conduct of King Zhou of Yin did not rise above that of the Three Benevolent Ones, yet he occupied the throne. Ji Zha held no rank in Wu, while Tian Heng monopolized the state of Qi. Boyi and Shuqi starved at Shouyang, while the Ji clan grew wealthier than Zhan Qin. If these are within your power, why do you grant long life to one and early death to another, obstruct the worthy and advance the wicked, debase the wise and exalt the foolish, impoverish the good and enrich the evil?”

Strength said: “If this is so, then I truly have no merit in things. Yet if things are as they are, is this not your doing?”
Fate said: “Since I am called Fate, how could there be one who controls me? I merely follow the straight and yield to the crooked. Each lives long or dies young, succeeds or fails, rises or falls, grows rich or poor—how could I comprehend it? How could I comprehend it?”

Strength is human effort; Fate is Heaven’s decree. The meaning here is that longevity or early death, success or failure, wealth or poverty—if these were determined by human effort and not by Heaven’s decree, then they would not be the work of creation. To follow the straight and yield to the crooked is to say that both straight and crooked arise naturally; I merely follow and yield to them. “How could I comprehend it?” means that even Fate cannot control them, for there is something yet more primal that governs them—what *Zhuangzi* calls “that upon which I depend, which itself depends on something else to be so.”

The general purport of this chapter is thus, and its language is direct and unadorned, which is why some doubt it is from the original *Liezi*.

---

Beigongzi said to Ximenzi: “You and I are of the same generation, yet people esteem you. We are of the same clan, yet people respect you. We share the same appearance, yet people love you. We speak alike, yet people heed you. We act alike, yet people trust you. We serve alike, yet you are honored. We farm alike, yet you grow rich. We trade alike, yet you profit. I wear coarse cloth, eat coarse grain, dwell in a thatched hut, and walk on foot. You wear brocade, feast on fine meats, live in a mansion with long eaves, and ride in a carriage drawn by four horses. At home, you cheerfully dismiss me; at court, you haughtily scorn me. You do not deign to visit me, nor do we travel together—this has been so for years. Do you consider your virtue superior to mine?”

Ximenzi said: “I have no way of knowing the truth. You undertake affairs and fail; I undertake them and succeed. Is this proof of our differing worth?”
Beigongzi, unable to respond, departed in dismay.

On the road, he encountered Master Dongguo, who said: “Where are you coming from, walking so hesitantly, with such a look of deep shame?”
Beigongzi recounted what had happened.

Master Dongguo said: “Shall I relieve you of your shame? Let us go together to question Ximen again.”
He said: “Why do you so deeply humiliate Beigongzi? Speak plainly.”

Ximenzi said: “Beigongzi claims that we share the same generation, clan, age, appearance, speech, and conduct, yet differ in status, wealth, and poverty. I told him: ‘I have no way of knowing the truth. You undertake affairs and fail; I undertake them and succeed. Is this not proof of our differing worth?’ And yet you say we are the same—your face is shameless indeed.”

Master Dongguo said: “Your notion of worth differs from mine. When you speak of worth, you refer only to differences in talent and virtue. What I call worth is this: Beigongzi is rich in virtue but poor in fate; you are rich in fate but poor in virtue. Your success is not due to wisdom, nor is his failure due to folly. Both are Heaven’s doing, not man’s. Yet you boast of your favorable fate, while Beigongzi feels shame for his virtue—neither of you understands the principle of what is inherently so.”

Ximenzi said: “Enough, Master. I dare not speak further.”

After Beigongzi returned home, he donned his coarse cloth, which was as warm as fox or badger fur; he ate his coarse beans, which tasted as fine as rice and millet; he sheltered in his thatched hut, which shaded like a grand hall; he rode in his humble cart, which was as splendid as an ornate carriage. For the rest of his life, he remained at ease, unaware of honor or disgrace in others or himself.

Master Dongguo, hearing of this, said: “Beigongzi has slept long indeed. A single word awakened him—how easily he was enlightened!”

The esteem, respect, and love people show to the successful are merely their partiality toward them. *Lian li* refers to the long eaves of a mansion. *Zaoshi* means the affairs one undertakes. Success or failure—failure is called “thick,” success “thin”; “thick” and “thin” denote ability or its lack. *Yu yu er bu* describes a hesitant gait. *He yin shi* is a phonetic gloss, meaning “to relieve your shame.” *Geng zhi* means to go again, to revisit Ximen together. Success is not due to wisdom, nor failure to folly—how can one boast of fate? *Guran* refers to the inherent principle of nature. *Rong shu* are large beans. To be “rich in virtue but poor in fate” is to have great ability yet no opportunity.

Rich in fate yet poor in virtue—this is to encounter opportunity without ability. Here, *de* (virtue) shares the same meaning as *neng* (ability), not the virtue of moral cultivation.

Guan Yiwu and Bao Shuya were close friends, living together in Qi. Guan Yiwu served Prince Jiu, while Bao Shuya served Prince Xiaobai. The Qi royal clan was favored and numerous, with legitimate and illegitimate heirs contending equally. The people feared chaos. Guan Zhong and Shao Hu escorted Prince Jiu in flight to Lu, while Bao Shuya escorted Prince Xiaobai to Ju. Later, when Gongsun Wuzhi rebelled and Qi had no ruler, the two princes raced to return. Guan Yiwu fought Xiaobai on the road to Ju, shooting him in the belt hook. Once Xiaobai ascended the throne, he forced Lu to execute Prince Jiu; Shao Hu died for him, while Guan Yiwu was imprisoned.

Bao Shuya said to Duke Huan: “Guan Yiwu is capable—he can govern the state.”
Duke Huan replied: “He is my enemy. I wish to kill him.”
Bao Shuya said: “I have heard that a worthy lord bears no private grudges. Moreover, one who can serve his master can surely serve a lord. If you wish to become hegemon, none but Yiwu will suffice. You must pardon him.”
Thereupon, Guan Zhong was summoned. Lu returned him to Qi, and Bao Shuya welcomed him beyond the city walls, releasing him from captivity. Duke Huan honored him, placing him above the Gao and Guo clans. Bao Shuya humbled himself before him, entrusting him with state affairs, and he was styled “Zhongfu.” Duke Huan thus became hegemon.

Guan Zhong once sighed: “When I was young and poor, I once traded with Bao Shuya, taking more than my share of the profits. Bao Shuya did not think me greedy—he knew I was impoverished. I once devised a plan for Bao Shuya that led to great hardship. He did not think me foolish—he knew the times were inauspicious. I served three times and was thrice dismissed by my lords. Bao Shuya did not think me worthless—he knew I had not met my moment. I fought three battles and fled thrice. He did not think me cowardly—he knew I had an aged mother. When Prince Jiu was defeated, Shao Hu died for him, while I endured imprisonment and humiliation. Bao Shuya did not think me shameless—he knew I did not scorn minor setbacks but grieved that my name would not resound through the world. My parents gave me life, but Bao Shuya truly knew me.”

This is why the world praises Guan and Bao for their fine friendship, and Xiaobai for his skill in employing talent. Yet in truth, there was no fine friendship, nor any skill in employing talent. To say there was no fine friendship and no skill in employing talent is not to claim that some other fine friendship or skill existed. Shao Hu did not choose to die—he had no choice but to die. Bao Shuya did not choose to recommend the worthy—he had no choice but to recommend. Xiaobai did not choose to employ his enemy—he had no choice but to employ him.

*Shen qi* means “very close.” The Guo and Gao clans were two noble families of Qi. Bao Shuya knew I was poor, knew the times were inauspicious, knew I had an aged mother—these words are most excellent. To “skillfully employ talent” is to skillfully manage human affairs. To have “no choice but to recommend” and “no choice but to employ” is the mandate of Heaven.

When Guan Yiwu fell ill, Xiaobai asked him: “Zhongfu’s illness is grave. You need not avoid speaking plainly. If it should become critical, to whom should I entrust the state?”
Yiwu said: “Whom do you desire?”
Xiaobai said: “Bao Shuya will do.”
Yiwu replied: “He will not. His character is that of a pure and upright scholar. Toward those unlike himself, he does not associate with them. Once he hears of a man’s fault, he never forgets it. If he were to govern the state, above he would offend the lord, below he would alienate the people. His offense against you would not be long in coming.”

Then Xiaobai asked, “If so, who is suitable?”
He replied, “If you must choose, then Xi Peng will do.
His character is such that above, he forgets his lord, yet below, none rebel against him. He feels shame for not equaling the Yellow Emperor and pities those who do not equal himself.
To share virtue with others is the mark of a sage; to share wealth with others is the mark of a worthy. To rule others with worthiness never wins their hearts; to humble oneself before the worthy never fails to win them.
In governing the state, there are things he does not hear; in managing his household, there are things he does not see.
If you must choose, then Xi Peng will do.”

“His illness is grave” means his illness has become severe. “Do not avoid speaking plainly” means one must not avoid what others say. This marks the end of the sentence.
“Those who do not equal himself” refers to people he despises, whom he does not regard as of the same kind.
“To offend the lord” means to entangle and constrain him.
“To alienate the people” means to control them with laws and governance.
“Above, he forgets” means he serves his lord without calculation.
“Below, none rebel” means he does not go against reason.
“Shame for not equaling the Yellow Emperor” shows his high regard for himself.
“Pity for those who do not equal himself” shows his great forbearance toward others.
“To share virtue with others” means he does not claim virtue as his own.
“To rule others with worthiness” means he deliberately seeks to subdue them.
“To humble oneself before the worthy” means he lowers himself to honor others.
“In governing the state, there are things he does not hear; in managing his household, there are things he does not see” means he does not rely on his own intelligence.

Guan Yiwu does not slight Bao Shuya out of preference, but he cannot but slight him; he does not favor Xi Peng out of partiality, but he cannot but favor him.
To favor someone at first may lead to slighting them later; to slight someone later may follow from favoring them at first. The ebb and flow of favor and disfavor do not depend on me.
Though Guan and Bao’s friendship was as described, Guan’s dying words seemed to slight Bao Shuya and favor Xi Peng. Though he claimed to choose a minister for the state, in truth, this too was a matter of fate, not something Yiwu could control.
The words of favor and disfavor are not meant as actual judgments but serve to illustrate the power of fate.

Deng Xi wielded an argument of two possibilities, crafting endless words. When Zichan was in power, Deng Xi composed the *Bamboo Penal Code*. The state of Zheng adopted it, and Deng Xi repeatedly challenged Zichan’s governance. Zichan yielded to him. Zichan then arrested and executed him, swiftly putting him to death.
Thus, Zichan was not truly able to use the *Bamboo Penal Code*—he could not but use it. Deng Xi was not truly able to humble Zichan—he could not but humble him. Zichan was not truly able to execute Deng Xi—he could not but execute him.
“Two possibilities” means to deceive and follow, making right and wrong interchangeable. “Endless words” are beyond questioning.
“Repeatedly challenged Zichan’s governance” means that during Zichan’s rule, Deng Xi often opposed him.
“Zichan yielded to him” means he was troubled by Deng Xi’s objections.
After Zichan adopted Deng Xi’s *Bamboo Penal Code*, yet found opposition troublesome, he blamed the code. Thus, he arrested and executed Deng Xi, and having executed him, he then put him to death.
The *Bamboo Penal Code* refers to a penal code written on bamboo slips.
“Could not but use it, could not but execute him”—the *Bamboo Penal Code* was Deng Xi’s creation. Zichan first used it, yet Deng Xi was later executed because of it. Favor and disfavor reversed, and fortune and misfortune arose—all by the natural course of fate, not by human effort. Even Zichan had no freedom in this.

To live when one can live is Heaven’s blessing; to die when one can die is Heaven’s blessing.
To live when one cannot live is Heaven’s punishment; to die when one cannot die is Heaven’s punishment.
To be able to live or die, and to live or die accordingly—this happens.
To be unable to live or die, yet to live or die nonetheless—this too happens.
Yet life and death, neither of things nor of oneself, are all a matter of fate, beyond the reach of wisdom.
Thus it is said: Vast and boundless, the Dao of Heaven meets of itself; empty and undivided, the Dao of Heaven moves of itself.
Heaven and Earth cannot transgress it; sages and wise men cannot interfere; ghosts and spirits cannot deceive.
The natural course silently completes it, levels it, guides it, and welcomes it.

“To be able to live or die” means each follows their desire, meeting death or life without regret—people call this Heaven’s blessing.
To cling to life yet not live, to suffer in hardship and disgrace, to seek death yet not die—people call this Heaven’s punishment.
Such things certainly occur in the world, yet they do not know that life and death, neither of things nor of oneself, are not free, beyond the reach of wisdom and effort—all is fate.
Even wisdom can do nothing about it.
“To live or die accordingly” is the same as “to be able to live or die,” merely reiterated for emphasis.
“To live or die nonetheless” also conveys the meaning of “unable to.”

“Vast and boundless” means dark and limitless, unfathomable—this is where the Dao of Heaven converges.
“Empty and undivided” is the wonder of the Dao of Heaven’s movement.
Who can know it? “Heaven and Earth cannot transgress it”—Heaven, though of firm virtue, does not interfere with the seasons; waxing and waning, Heaven itself does not violate them.
“Sages and wise men cannot interfere” means even sages and wise men cannot defy the times.
“Ghosts and spirits cannot deceive” means even ghosts cannot know it, nor use it to deceive others.
“Silently” means to comprehend it in silence.
“Completes it” means it naturally achieves itself, without effort.
“Levels it” means to listen with an impartial heart.
“Guides it” means to guide its departure.
“Welcomes it” means to welcome its arrival.
*Zhuangzi* says: “When the Master came, it was the time; when he went, it was the proper course. To be at ease with the time and dwell in the proper course, sorrow and joy cannot enter.” This is the same idea.

Yang Zhu’s friend was named Ji Liang. Ji Liang fell ill, and after seven days, his condition worsened.

His son circled around him, weeping, and sought out physicians. Ji Liang said to Yang Zhu: “My son is so unworthy—why do you not sing for him to enlighten him?” Yang Zhu sang:

“Heaven does not know—
how could man awaken?
Not blessed by Heaven,
nor cursed by man.
You or I—
who understands?
Physician or shaman—
do they truly know?”

His son did not comprehend and ultimately summoned three physicians. The first was named Jiao, the second Yu, and the third Lu. They examined his illness. Jiao said to Ji Liang: “Your cold and heat are unregulated, your deficiency and excess imbalanced. The illness arises from hunger and satiety, lust and desire, scattered essence and troubled thoughts—neither Heaven nor ghosts are to blame. Though grave, it can be treated.” Ji Liang said: “A common physician—quickly send him away.”

Yu said: “From the beginning, your prenatal qi was insufficient, while your postnatal nourishment was excessive. The illness did not arise in a single day; its causes have accumulated gradually. It cannot be cured.” Ji Liang said: “A good physician.”

He then gave him food to eat.

Lu said: “Your illness comes neither from Heaven, nor from man, nor from ghosts. At birth you received your form, and from the beginning there was one who governed it, one who knew it. What can medicine or stone needles do for you?”

Ji Liang said: “A divine physician.”

He then richly rewarded him.

Soon after, Ji Liang’s illness resolved of itself.

No blessing descends from Heaven, no affliction arises from man—all is natural.

*Jing lü fan san*: thoughts and cares grow excessive, and the spirit scatters and is lost.
*Ru du you yu*: drinking too much milk.
Jiao’s words attributed the illness to human affairs, so Ji Liang dismissed him as a common physician.
Yu’s words spoke of an illness received at birth, tracing its origin to Heaven rather than human action, so Ji Liang deemed him a good physician and gave him food, for his words approached the truth.
Lu’s words spoke of a governing force unknown and a knowing force equally unknown—even Heaven does not comprehend it—so Ji Liang called him a divine physician and lavished gifts upon him, for his insight was lofty and subtle.
Soon after, the illness resolved of itself—this too was simply natural, and medicine played no part.

Life is not preserved by esteem, nor the body enriched by love;
Life is not cut short by lowliness, nor the body diminished by neglect.
Thus, esteem may not bring life, lowliness may not bring death;
Love may not enrich, neglect may not diminish.
This seems contrary, yet it is not contrary—
Life and death, enrichment and impoverishment, proceed of themselves.
Some live despite lowliness, some die despite esteem;
Some are enriched by love, some diminished by neglect.
This seems natural, yet it is not natural—
Life and death, enrichment and impoverishment, proceed of themselves.
Esteem and lowliness, enrichment and impoverishment, have no bearing on longevity or early death.
These words seem to defy the norm, yet they do not—
They appear to contradict reason, yet they do not.
To attribute longevity or early death to esteem or lowliness, enrichment or impoverishment—
These words seem to follow reason, yet they do not.
Know that longevity and early death arise from the natural, from what cannot be otherwise, and the doubt of contrary or natural vanishes.

Xiong Yu said to King Wen: “What is long is not made longer, what is short is not made shorter. What is lost in calculation—what is it? Long and short proceed of themselves, as in Zhuangzi’s discourse on the wild duck and crane. What lies beyond calculation—what can be done? If it does not fall within calculation, what can man do? Since man cannot control it, how can he do otherwise than let it be natural?”

Laozi said to Guan Yin: “Who knows the reason for Heaven’s dislikes? To divine Heaven’s intent, to weigh profit and harm—better to cease.”

This chapter echoes Zhuangzi’s words: “Heaven’s gentleman is man’s petty man; man’s gentleman is Heaven’s petty man.”
Yan Yuan and Robber Zhi—who was good? Who was evil?
To judge Heaven’s intent by human affairs, to seek its likes and dislikes, its profit and harm—where can one find them? Better to cease. To let things be is superior.

Yang Bu asked: “Consider two men: they are brothers in age, brothers in talent, brothers in appearance, yet in longevity they are father and son, in rank father and son, in reputation father and son, in love and hatred father and son. I am perplexed.”

Yangzi said: “The ancients had a saying—I have long remembered it, and shall tell it to you.”

What occurs without knowing why it occurs—this is fate. Now, in this murky confusion, in this ceaseless flux, whether one acts or does not act, as days pass and return, who can fathom its cause? All is fate.

He who trusts in fate transcends life and death;
he who trusts in principle transcends right and wrong;
he who trusts in the heart transcends compliance and defiance;
he who trusts in nature transcends safety and peril.
Thus, one may speak of complete trust—or of complete distrust.
Truly sincere, truly steadfast—what to reject? What to embrace?
What to grieve? What to delight in?
What to do? What not to do?

"Brothers" speaks of their age and appearance, their words and talents being alike. "Father and son" speaks of the vast distance between their rank, longevity, honor, and repute.

The ancients had a saying—which I have long remembered—what was it? "What occurs without knowing why it occurs—this is fate." This is it.

"In ceaseless flux"—this means multiplicity. "Restlessly moving"—this means unceasing motion. The *Book of Han* speaks of "pendant cords swaying restlessly."

To wish to act yet be unable, to wish not to act yet be compelled—fate’s constraint: who knows its cause? To know fate is to transcend life and death; to know the principle of spontaneity is to transcend right and wrong; to know the heart’s truth is to transcend compliance and defiance; to know the nature of Heaven’s mandate is to transcend safety and peril.

Fate, principle, heart, nature—though they seem trustworthy, they are not wholly so. Thus it is said: "Complete trust, complete distrust." Truly sincere, truly steadfast—unified and unwavering. If one could be thus, what to reject? What to embrace?

What is there to grieve over? What is there to rejoice in? What is there to be done? What is there to be left undone? In all these, let the heart remain unburdened.

The *Book of the Yellow Emperor* states: "The perfected person dwells as though dead, moves as though mechanical." They neither know why they dwell nor why they do not dwell; neither know why they move nor why they do not move. They do not alter their demeanor because others observe them, nor do they maintain it because others do not. Alone they come, alone they go—who can obstruct them?

To "dwell as though dead" echoes *Zhuangzi*’s "corpse-like stillness," where the body is like withered wood and the heart like dead ashes. To "move as though mechanical" is like a shadow following its form, dependent on something else to be so—like the wooden puppet of the artisan Yan Shi, whose movements are governed by hidden mechanisms. Since it does not originate from the self, one neither knows why one dwells or does not dwell, moves or does not move. Whether others see my demeanor or not, how has it ever changed? Beyond the reach of ears and eyes, all is forgotten, so that in coming and going, entering and exiting, one attains the marvel alone—who can restrain or hinder this? This is to forget the self, abandon the form, and wander with the Creator.

Mo (眉), Xi (杘), Chi (敕), Yi (夷), and Nü (女) wander together in the world, each following their own will. Though they spend their years together, they never truly know one another, so deep is their cunning.

"Each following their own will" means these four types move through the world according to their own inclinations. Though they spend their lives together, they remain unknown to one another—such is the depth of their cleverness. The five passages below invent such names to depict human emotions and worldly attitudes, akin to *Zhuangzi*’s "flaunting and revealing one’s nature."

Mo (墨) sounds like *mei* (眉), *shǐ nǚ lǚ* (屎女履). Xi (杘) means weakness. Chi (敕) means *dan zhi* (单至), an appearance of unease. Yi (夷) means *tan xuan* (啴咺), a look of fear. Nü (女) means *bie fu* (憋懯), a manner of haste.

The crafty and obsequious, the foolish and upright, the graceful (婩) and the coarse (鱼), the blunt (斫) and the fawning (夫约)—these four types wander together in the world, each following their own will. Though they spend their years together, they never reveal their methods to one another, so subtle is their artifice.

"They never reveal their methods" means they do not share their techniques, believing in the subtlety of their own skill. *Xue* (硸) means *zhuo* (斫), an appearance of dullness.

The cunning (犭廖), the fierce (犽), the emotionally exposed (情露), the inarticulate (言蹇), the overbearing (凌谇)—these four types wander together in the world, each following their own will. Though they spend their years together, they never come to understand one another, so assured are they in their own talents.

Here are four more types who flaunt their abilities. *Liao ya* (犭廖犽) means slyness. *Qing lu* (情露) refers to what people now call "showing off." *Yan jian dan ji* (言蹇诞极) means stammering and urgency. *Ling sui* (凌谇) means interrogation. *Zhuangzi* says: "The wise take no delight in idle debates." "Never come to understand" means they never come to comprehend one another.

The timid (眠), the hesitant (娗), the shirking (諈), the evasive (诿), the brave, and the indecisive—these four types wander together in the world, each following their own will. Though they spend their years together, they never expose one another’s faults, so blameless do they believe their conduct to be.

Here are four more types with differing behaviors. *Mian tian* (眠娗) means shrinking and unsteady. *Zhui wei* (諈诿) means nagging and shifting blame. "Never expose one another’s faults" means they never criticize or correct one another.

The accommodating (多偶), the self-reliant (自专), the powerful (乘权), and the solitary (只立)—these four types wander together in the world, each following their own will. Though they spend their years together, they never glance at one another, so perfectly do they believe the times suit them.

*Duo ou* (多偶) means agreeable, easily aligning with others. *Zi zhuan* (自专) means self-reliant, unable to align with others. *Cheng quan* (乘权) means those who gain power through circumstance. *Zhi li* (只立) means standing alone without fear. "Never glance at one another" means each believes they have seized the right moment.

These are the many attitudes—though their appearances differ, all are subsumed by the Dao, all return to fate. "The many attitudes" refer to the five types of people above. "Dao" means spontaneity. "Subsumed by the Dao" means all proceed from the natural. Though their emotions, appearances, and demeanors vary, none act freely—all return to fate. This suggests that the myriad human emotions and worldly attitudes, though diverse, are all shaped by fate.

All *guigui* seem to achieve completion—these are but semblances of success, not true success. All *guigui* seem to fail—these are but semblances of failure, not true failure. Thus delusion arises from semblance, for in the moment of semblance, all is dim. Yet if one remains undimmed amid semblance, one will not be startled by external misfortune nor delighted by inner fortune; moving with the time, halting with the time—even wisdom cannot fathom it.

Those who trust in fate harbor no duality between self and other. Those who divide self and other would do better to cover their eyes and plug their ears, for even with their backs to the precipice and faces to the moat, they will not stumble. Thus it is said: life and death come from fate, poverty and hardship from the times. Those who resent early death do not understand fate; those who resent poverty do not understand the times. Facing death without fear, enduring hardship without sorrow—this is knowing fate and accepting the times.

Let the clever calculate gains and losses, weigh the real and the empty, gauge human nature—they may succeed, they may fail, yet both outcomes align. Let the foolish not calculate gains and losses, not weigh the real and the empty, not gauge human nature—they too may succeed, they too may fail, and both outcomes align. What difference lies between calculation and non-calculation, between weighing and not weighing, between gauging and not gauging? Only when there is nothing to calculate, nothing not to calculate, is wholeness preserved and loss averted. Yet this is neither knowing wholeness nor knowing loss—wholeness is self-wholeness, loss is self-loss, ruin is self-ruin.

*Guigui* describes the appearance of nearness. *Qiao* means semblance. Success seems success yet is not success; failure seems failure yet is not failure. People are deluded by these semblances, bewildered by success and failure—hence it is said: delusion arises from semblance. Yet in the moment of semblance, though all seems dim and unknowable, the principle is in truth quite clear. It was never truly dim. If one remains undimmed amid semblance, then misfortune is not startling, fortune not delightful. External misfortune is what people shun; inner fortune is what they desire. Yet fortune and misfortune have no inherent inner or outer—people divide them by love and hate, thus giving rise to fear and joy. Moving with the time, halting with the time, advancing and retreating in accord—even wisdom cannot fathom it, for there is no room for intention.

Standing with one’s back to a steep slope, facing a deep moat—this is perilous indeed. To cover one’s eyes and plug one’s ears is peril upon peril. Yet if one knows fate lies in Heaven and harbors no intention, there is no peril. Such words differ from Mencius’ saying that those who know fate do not stand beneath crumbling walls—for the words of sages and worthies differ from those of heterodox teachings.

The clever may calculate, yet success and failure remain evenly matched. The foolish may not calculate, yet success and failure remain evenly matched. "Succeeding aligns, failing aligns"—this means both outcomes are half. Even the most cunning cannot exhaust all calculations, and even the most foolish may sometimes succeed. But if one neither calculates nor refrains from calculation, then gain and loss vanish entirely—what is of Heaven is preserved, and nothing is lost. Yet wholeness cannot be known, loss cannot be known, and the absence of wholeness or loss cannot be known either. Thus it is said: neither knowing wholeness nor knowing loss. The preceding line speaks of wholeness without loss, yet concludes with self-wholeness, self-loss, self-ruin—this is stirring prose. Its meaning is: wholeness is self-wholeness, loss is self-loss, and the absence of wholeness or loss is itself the absence of wholeness or loss.

Duke Jing of Qi was traveling on Ox Mountain when he looked north over his capital and wept, saying: "How beautiful is this land! So lush and verdant—why must I one day leave it and die?" If the ancients had never died, where would I go from here? Historians Kong and Liang Qiu Ju both wept with him, saying: "We rely on Your Lordship’s grace. Though we eat coarse grain and tough meat, though we ride broken-down horses and rickety carts, we still do not wish to die—how much less our lord?" Only Yanzi laughed beside them. The duke wiped his tears and turned to Yanzi: "Today’s outing has made me sorrowful. Kong and Ju weep with me, yet you alone laugh—why?" Yanzi replied: "If worthy men had always guarded this land, then the Great Duke and Duke Huan would still guard it. If brave men had always guarded it, then Duke Zhuang and Duke Ling would still guard it. With such rulers guarding it, where would Your Lordship be? You would be wearing a straw raincoat and hat, standing in the fields, worrying only about your livelihood, with no time to ponder death. How then would you have attained this position? It is because rulers succeed one another, departing one after another. That you alone weep for this is unkind. Seeing an unkind ruler and flattering ministers—these two things are why I could not help but laugh." Duke Jing was ashamed. He raised his cup to punish himself and made the two ministers drink two cups each as punishment.

*Didi* describes the appearance of decline. *Coarse grain* refers to the food of the lowly. *Rickety carts* are small, roughly made vehicles. *Wiping tears* means drying them. *Worrying only about livelihood* means being anxious about survival. *With no time* is a scribal error for "how could there be time." This passage speaks of those who, in their folly, do not understand life and death, coming and going, but cling only to present pleasures.

There was a man of Wei named Dongmen Wu whose son died, yet he was not grieved. His steward said: "No one in the world loved their son more than you. Now that your son has died, why are you not grieved?" Dongmen Wu replied: "I once had no son, and when I had no son, I was not grieved. Now that my son has died, it is the same as when I had no son—why should I grieve?"

The *steward* was the manager of his household. This passage presents the doctrine of "what is originally possessed is fundamentally real; what is originally lost is fundamentally nonexistent."

*Minister* and *how* are interchangeable terms. The farmer pursues the seasons, the merchant seeks profit, the artisan refines his craft, and the official chases power—such is the compulsion of circumstance. Yet the farmer faces drought and flood, the merchant meets gain and loss, the artisan encounters success and failure, and the official finds favor or neglect—such is the decree of fate.

*To pursue* means to refine, as in the pursuit of carving and polishing. Though the farmer follows the seasons, Heaven sends drought and flood; though the merchant chases profit, circumstances bring gain and loss; though the artisan excels in skill, times yield success and failure; though the official curries favor with the powerful, he may meet with fortune or misfortune—all is fate.

The earlier statement that "such is the compulsion of circumstance" means that once one becomes a farmer, merchant, artisan, or official, the situation leaves no alternative—worldly conditions compel it, allowing no self-determination.

*The Authentic Classic of Perfect Virtue, Master Yan’s Oral Exegesis, Scroll Seven*
By Lin Xiyi of Yan Studio

**Yang Zhu, Chapter Seven**

Yang Zhu traveled to Lu and lodged at the Meng residence. Meng asked him: "Man is but man—why strive for fame?"

Yang Zhu replied: "Fame is sought for wealth."

"If one is already wealthy, why not cease?"

"For nobility."

"If one is already noble, why not cease?"

"For death."

"If one is already dead, what then?"

"For one’s descendants."

"What benefit does fame bring to descendants?"

Yang Zhu said: "Fame wears the body and wearies the heart. Yet those who ride its wave bestow blessings upon their clans, extend benefits to their villages, and how much more to their descendants? Man is but man—since all are equally human, mere life suffices; why pursue fame? Fame wears the body and wearies the heart, for those who chase it labor in vain. Yet through such toil, they secure fame and thus leave blessings for their clans, benefits for their villages, and all the more for their descendants. This is how fame brings advantage."

"Yet all who seek fame must be incorruptible, and incorruptibility leads to poverty; they must be yielding, and yielding leads to lowliness." (Here, a transition is implied.) "All who seek fame must be both incorruptible and yielding. If one is incorruptible and yielding, one cannot be wealthy or noble—how then can one benefit descendants?"

Yang Zhu said: "When Guan Zhong served as minister of Qi, he matched his lord’s excesses and extravagance. Their wills aligned, their words concurred, and the Way was enacted, making the state hegemonic. Yet after his death, only the Guan clan remained. When the Tian clan served as ministers of Qi, if the lord was full, they diminished themselves; if the lord levied, they bestowed. The people all turned to them, and thus they seized the state of Qi. Their descendants have enjoyed it to this day without end."

"True fame leads to poverty; false fame leads to wealth." (Another transition, now distinguishing true and false fame.) "Guan Zhong followed his lord in excess and extravagance, seeking no self-praise. Loyal in his counsel, he swiftly achieved hegemony—this was true fame, yet its benefits extended no further than himself. The Tian clan’s actions all countered their lord’s: when he was arrogant, they were modest; when he was oppressive, they were benevolent. Their modesty and benevolence were self-serving, seeking reputation—this was false fame, yet they ultimately gained the state of Qi. Thus, the false grow wealthy while the true remain poor."

Yang Zhu said: "Truth has no fame; fame has no truth. Fame is but pretense."

"In ancient times, Yao and Shun feigned offering the world to Xu You and Shan Juan yet did not lose it, reigning for a hundred years. Boyi and Shuqi sincerely ceded the rulership of Guzhu yet ultimately lost their state and starved to death on Mount Shouyang. The distinction between truth and pretense is thus made clear." (Another transition: all fame is pretense.) "Those of true virtue do not seek fame; those who seek fame lack true conduct. All who pursue fame do so falsely. Having deemed fame pretense, the text invokes Yao, Shun, Boyi, and Shuqi to illustrate its point—this is why the book is considered heterodox. *Sheng* means ‘clear’: the distinction between truth and pretense is thus made evident."

This passage first asserts that fame can benefit oneself, yet ultimately concludes with the word *pretense*. "Truth has no fame; fame has no truth"—these six characters are well put. But to say, "Fame is but pretense," is a doctrine that corrects the world.

Yang Zhu said: "A hundred years is the greatest span of life. Of a thousand, not one attains it. Even if one does, half is spent in infancy, old age, and senility. Half of what remains is lost to sleep at night and distraction by day. Another half is consumed by pain, illness, sorrow, loss, anxiety, and fear. In the few decades that remain, moments of unburdened joy, free from even the slightest concern, are but fleeting. What, then, is the purpose of human life? What joy does it bring? It is but fine food and rich garments, music and beauty. Yet fine food and rich garments cannot always sate, nor can music and beauty always delight the senses. Then one is further constrained by rewards and punishments, advanced or withdrawn by fame and law. Restlessly, one competes for fleeting reputation, schemes for posthumous glory, cautiously guards what one sees and hears, and spares no thought for the body or mind. Thus, one forfeits the supreme joy of the present, unable to indulge even for a moment. How is this different from a prisoner in shackles?"

"The people of high antiquity knew that life is but a brief sojourn and death a fleeting departure. Thus, they followed their hearts and acted without defying their natural desires. They did not forsake present pleasures for the sake of fame. They roamed in accord with their nature, not resisting the inclinations of all things. They did not seek posthumous fame, nor did they invite punishment. They did not weigh reputation before or after, nor did they measure the length of life. *Qi* means ‘measure.’ *Mǐ* means ‘dissipated,’ as in ‘dissolved.’ *Yí* means ‘lost.’ *Jiè* refers to the slightest thing—joy is rare in life, and even in moments of joy, can one be entirely free of minor concerns? This is to say, joy is never complete. Even if one could fully enjoy a hundred years, not a single moment of perfect bliss would remain. *Měi hòu* means fine food and rich garments. *Huánghuáng* means restless. *Yǔyǔ* means aimless. Restlessly competing for empty fame, aimlessly avoiding right and wrong—how is this different from a prisoner? *Yì* and *yì* are the same: to follow the heart is to act, merely without violating natural principle. For present pleasures, one pursues what one loves without abandoning it for the sake of fame. One roams in accord with one’s nature, not resisting the desires of all things. Posthumous fame is indeed what people desire, yet one does not court punishment to attain it—this means one does not die for fame."

Yet such writings reveal too much of their sinews and bones, seeming unfit for the purpose of imparting instruction—*Zhuangzi* is not thus.

Yang Zhu said: "All things differ in life, yet are the same in death. In life, there are the worthy and the foolish, the noble and the base—this is how they differ. In death, there is putrefaction and dissolution—this is how they are the same. Though so, worthiness and foolishness, nobility and baseness are not within one’s power; putrefaction and dissolution are likewise not within one’s power. Thus, life is not what one lives, death is not what one dies; worthiness is not what one deems worthy, foolishness is not what one deems foolish; nobility is not what one deems noble, baseness is not what one deems base. Yet all things are equal in life, equal in death, equal in worthiness, equal in foolishness, equal in nobility, equal in baseness. Ten years or a hundred years—both end in death. The benevolent sage and the cruel fool—both end in death. Alive, one may be Yao or Shun; dead, one is but rotting bones. Alive, one may be Yu or Zhou; dead, one is but rotting bones. All is one—who knows the difference? Moreover, one should attend to the present life—why hasten to consider what comes after death? Though life differs, death is the same, just as Du Zimei said: the sage Confucius and the bandit Zhi alike become dust. *Qu* means ‘to turn toward.’ Having understood the present, why trouble oneself with what follows death? Thus it is said: *Attend to the present life—why hasten to consider what comes after death?* Zhang Han said: *Let us first drain this cup of life.* Letian said: *Do not think of the endless matters beyond the self—just empty the limited cups before you.* Both express this same idea."

Yang Zhu said: "Boyi did not lack desires—his excessive pride in purity led him to starve to death. Zhan Ji was not without passions—his excessive pride in chastity led him to leave no descendants. The error of purity and chastity lies in this. The character *xie* is likely a scribal corruption of *you*. *You* and *you* are the same, meaning ‘excessive’—the ancient characters were interchangeable. They were not without emotions or desires, for their likes and dislikes were the same as others’. Yet by clinging too rigidly to purity and chastity, Boyi thus brought about his own starvation, and Zhan Ji thus brought about the extinction of his lineage. *Gua zong* means the end of his clan. Such is how one errs by oneself. Yet the reputation for purity and chastity can mislead even the virtuous to such an extent. Thus it is said: *The error of purity and chastity lies in this.*"

Yang Zhu said: "Yuan Xian was impoverished in Lu, while Zigong amassed wealth in Wei. Yuan Xian’s poverty harmed his life, and Zigong’s wealth burdened his person. If poverty is not permissible, nor is wealth—where then lies what is permissible? It lies in delighting in life and freeing the self. Thus, one who delights in life does not suffer poverty, and one who frees the self does not amass wealth. *Zhi* means to burden oneself with the pursuit of wealth. Poverty brings no joy, and riches bring self-exhaustion—neither is the Way of nurturing life."

Yang Zhu said: "An ancient saying goes: *In life, we cherish one another; in death, we cast one another aside.* This saying is perfect. The Way of cherishing is not merely about affection—it is to labor so that others may be at ease, to hunger so that others may be full, to be cold so that others may be warm, to be poor so that others may prosper. The Way of casting aside is not without sorrow—it is to refrain from placing pearls and jade in the mouth, from dressing the dead in brocade, from offering sacrifices, from setting out funerary objects. *In death, we cast one another aside*—the ancients abandoned the dead, as the *Yi* says: *No mounding, no planting, no fixed mourning period.* The lines about not placing pearls and jade, etc., satirize those who practiced lavish burials in his time. The arguments of Yang Wangsun and Huangfu Mi for unclothed burial seem to derive from this."

Yan Pingzhong asked Guan Yifu about nurturing life. Guan Yifu said: "Let it be free—do not obstruct or restrain it." Yan Pingzhong said: "What does this entail?" Yifu said: "Indulge the ears in what they wish to hear, the eyes in what they wish to see, the nose in what it wishes to smell, the mouth in what it wishes to speak, the body in what it wishes to find comfortable, and the mind in what it wishes to do. If the ears wish to hear music but are not allowed to listen, this is called *obstructing hearing*; if the eyes wish to see beauty but are not allowed to look, this is called *obstructing sight*; if the nose wishes to smell pepper and orchid but is not allowed to inhale, this is called *obstructing scent*; if the mouth wishes to speak of right and wrong but is not allowed to speak, this is called *obstructing wisdom*; if the body wishes for comfort but is not allowed to follow it, this is called *obstructing ease*; if the mind wishes to act freely but is not allowed to do so, this is called *obstructing nature*. All these obstructions are the tyrants of self-torment. Cast off these tyrants of self-torment, and live joyfully awaiting death—whether a day, a month, a year, or ten years—this is what I call nurturing. Clinging to these tyrants of self-torment, bound without release, living in sorrow to a great age—whether a hundred years, a thousand years, or ten thousand years—this is not what I call nurturing. *E* means to restrain and control oneself, thereby tyrannizing one’s own heart—nothing but self-inflicted suffering. *A day, a month, a year, ten years*—this means to indulge body and mind so that one day is like another’s month, one year like another’s decade. Otherwise, even with a lifespan of a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand years, what benefit is there? *Not what I call nurturing*—this means it is not the Way of nurturing life."

Guan Yifu said: "I have already told you about nurturing life—what of sending off the dead?" Yan Pingzhong said: "Sending off the dead is a trivial matter—what more is there to say?" Guan Yifu said: "I would still like to hear it." Pingzhong said: "Once dead, what is it to me? Burn the body, or sink it, or bury it, or expose it; wrap it in firewood and cast it into a ravine, or dress it in embroidered robes and place it in a stone coffin—whatever one encounters will do." Guan Yifu turned to Bao Shu and Huangzi and said: "The Way of life and death—we two have advanced it."

The phrase "trivial matter" means it requires no deliberate arrangement—letting things take their course suffices. The dead should swiftly decay; those who prepare stone coffins do so merely to defy worldly convention.

Bao Shu and Huangzi are the names of two men—though Huangzi may well be a fictional figure. When Zichan served as minister of Zheng and held sole authority over the state’s governance, after three years, the virtuous submitted to his transformative influence while the wicked feared his prohibitions. Zheng thus achieved order, and the feudal lords stood in awe of him. Yet he had an elder brother named Gongsun Chao and a younger brother named Gongsun Mu. Chao was fond of wine, and Mu was fond of women.

In Chao’s residence, wine was amassed by the thousand *zhong*, yeast piled into mounds. From a hundred paces outside the gate, the scent of sweet ale assailed the nostrils. When he was lost in drink, he knew nothing of the world’s stability or peril, the regrets or resentments of human affairs, the prosperity or ruin of his household, the closeness or estrangement of his nine clans, or the sorrow and joy of life and death. Even if fire, flood, or blades raged before him, he remained oblivious.

Mu’s rear courtyard contained dozens of adjoining chambers, each filled with women of dazzling youth and delicate beauty, their voices soft and alluring.

When he was lost in sensual indulgence, he cast aside close kin, severed friendships, and fled to his rear courtyard, sating himself day and night. He would emerge but once every three months, yet his desires remained unfulfilled. Whenever he heard of a maiden of surpassing beauty in the village, he would bribe and summon her, employ matchmakers to entice her, and relent only when he had secured her.

Zichan grieved over this day and night. Secretly, he sought Deng Xi’s counsel, saying: “I have heard that governing the self leads to governing the household, and governing the household leads to governing the state—this speaks of proceeding from the near to the far. I have brought order to the state, yet my own household is in chaos. Does this mean my Way is perverse? What remedy can save my two brothers? I beg you, instruct them.”

Deng Xi replied: “I have long marveled at this but dared not speak first. Why not admonish them in due time, illustrating the weight of life and destiny, and alluring them with the dignity of ritual and righteousness?”

Zichan followed Deng Xi’s advice. Seizing an opportunity, he met with his brothers and said: “What elevates humans above beasts is wisdom. What wisdom guides is ritual and righteousness. When ritual and righteousness are perfected, renown and rank follow. But if one acts on impulse, indulging in desires, life and destiny are imperiled. Heed my words, and by evening you will regret your ways and enjoy emolument by dawn.”

Chao and Mu replied: “We have long known this and long deliberated upon it. Do we need your words to recognize it? Life is hard to attain yet death comes easily. With a life so difficult to obtain, why wait for death, which comes so readily? Why should we revere ritual and righteousness merely to impress others, or feign restraint to seek fame? We deem this worse than death. We wish only to exhaust life’s joys, to drain the pleasures of our years. Our sole concern is that our bellies may swell before we have drunk our fill, or our strength may fail before we have indulged our passions. We have no leisure to fret over tarnished reputations or the peril to our lives. Moreover, do you flaunt your governance of the state to sway us? Do you seek to confuse our hearts with fine words, to delight us with honors and emoluments? How contemptible and pitiable! We wish to part ways with you.

Those skilled in governing externals may not bring order to the world, yet they exhaust themselves. Those skilled in governing the self may not plunge the world into chaos, yet their nature remains at ease. Your governance of externals may be temporarily enforced in one state, but it does not accord with human hearts. Our governance of the self can be extended to all under heaven, and the Way of ruler and minister will cease. We have long wished to explain this art to you, yet you turn and instruct us with yours instead.”

Zichan was left speechless. Later, he recounted this to Deng Xi, who said: “You have dwelt with true men yet failed to recognize them. Who would call you wise? The order of Zheng is but a coincidence, not your achievement. Piles of yeast form mounds, and heaps of dregs become towers of wine. *Woduo* and *ejiao* both mean ‘beautiful women.’ ‘Relent only when secured’ means exhausting every scheme until success is achieved. ‘Deep reflection’ means profound contemplation. ‘Bellies may swell before drinking their fill, strength may fail before indulging their passions’—this is Guo Pu’s argument that the resources for wine and women may not be exhausted. Deng Xi called them ‘true men’ because they grasped the principles of nurturing life. ‘Those skilled in governing the self may not plunge the world into chaos’ means that those who delight in their own hearts do not necessarily bring disorder to the world—order and chaos are both natural destinies. This passage resembles the *Zhuangzi*’s ‘Robber Zhi’ chapter, with its sprawling branches and leaves. Guo Pu’s words seem profoundly irrational, yet considering his habit of girding a sword, loosening his hair, and ascending the privy, he likely knew his fate. Foreseeing that he could not protect himself, he espoused such theories. Yet fortune and misfortune lie with heaven, while cultivation rests with us. One should fulfill human effort and leave the rest to destiny. Girding a sword and loosening one’s hair is not the conduct of one who understands principle—how much less indulgence in wine and women? Reflecting on this, *Mencius* said: ‘Whether one lives long or dies young is not a matter of doubt; cultivate the self and await it.’ What richness of flavor, what abundance of principle, what inexhaustible enjoyment! Confucius said: ‘If one hears the Dao in the morning, one may die in the evening.’ His meaning lies here. The books of Zhuangzi and Liezi were originally written to lament the world, yet deluded people manipulate their arguments, and later generations have further adulterated them. Those who read these works without grasping their intent, or who fail to discern their authenticity, may be led astray—this is why they are called heterodox teachings.

Wei’s Duanmu Shu was a descendant of Zigong. Relying on his family’s wealth, his household amassed ten thousand gold. He paid no heed to worldly affairs, giving free rein to his desires.”

He indulged in all that the people desired to do, all that human inclination longed to enjoy—nothing was left undone, nothing left unplayed. His walls and halls, terraces and trees, gardens and parks, ponds and pools, food and drink, carriages and robes, music and concubines rivaled those of the lords of Qi and Chu. Whatever his heart craved, whatever his ears wished to hear, his eyes wished to see, his mouth wished to taste—even if it came from distant lands or remote states, from places where Qi’s soil did not nurture it—he would inevitably procure it, as if it were but a thing within his garden walls. Wherever he traveled, though mountains and rivers blocked the way, though the roads were long and the paths distant, he would inevitably go, as if it were but a step away. Guests filled his courtyard daily by the hundreds; his kitchens never ceased their smoke and flame; his halls and corridors never stilled their music.

After providing for his own needs, he first distributed the surplus to his clan; after the clan, he gave to his village; after the village, he scattered it throughout the state. At sixty, when his vitality began to wane, he abandoned his household affairs and dispersed all his storehouses—his treasures, jewels, carriages, robes, concubines, and attendants. Within a year, he exhausted it all, leaving no wealth for his descendants. When he fell ill, he had no medicines stored; when he died, he had no funds for burial. All in the state who had received his gifts then pooled their resources to bury him and restore his wealth to his descendants.

Qin Guli heard of this and said: “Duanmu Shu was a madman—he shamed his ancestors.” Duan Yuansheng heard of it and said: “Duanmu Shu was an enlightened man—his virtue surpassed his ancestors.” What he did, what he pursued, shocked the common mind, yet it was affirmed by the truth of principle.

The gentlemen of Wei, who held fast to ritual propriety, were certainly not those who could grasp this man’s heart. “Descendant of Zigong” refers to his later generations. “Pooled their resources to bury him” means they collected funds to inter him. “Shocked the common mind” means that ordinary people found his actions strange. “Affirmed by the truth of principle” means that, viewed through the lens of natural principle, his conduct was worthy of emulation. How could those who rigidly cling to ritual propriety ever understand this? His intent, it seems, was to mock our Confucians.

"Qi-drying" is akin to the strength of one’s qi-bones.

Meng Sunyang asked Yangzi: “Suppose there were a man here who values life and cherishes his body, seeking thereby not to die—would that be permissible?”
Yangzi replied: “In principle, there is no not-dying.”
“Then, seeking long life—would that be permissible?”
Yangzi replied: “In principle, there is no long life. Life is not preserved by valuing it, nor is the body made more substantial by cherishing it. Moreover, what is the purpose of long life? The five passions of love and hate remain the same in ancient times as now; the safety and peril of the four limbs remain the same in ancient times as now; the bitterness and joy of worldly affairs remain the same in ancient times as now; the alternations of order and chaos remain the same in ancient times as now. Having heard of these things, having seen them, having experienced them—even a hundred years would seem too many, let alone the suffering of an even longer life. Love and hate, safety and peril, bitterness and joy—these are all that human affairs amount to. The life of the world moves from order to chaos in an unending cycle, hence it is said: the alternations of order and chaos remain the same in ancient times as now. A thousand years, ten thousand years—it is all the same. *Geng* means to have passed through. My life, whether ten years or a hundred, has seen and heard and passed through nothing more than this; even a thousand years or ten thousand would be no different.”

Du Mu said: “The work of this floating world is eating and sleeping.” This, too, is the same idea.

Meng Sunyang said: “If that is so, then swift death is better than long life.”

Then to tread upon blades, plunge into boiling water and fire—this would fulfill one’s resolve.

Master Yang said: “Not so. Once born, then set aside all deliberation and yield to nature, exhausting all desires while awaiting death. When death comes, then set aside all deliberation and yield to nature, exhausting all destinations until release in dissolution. There is nothing not set aside, nothing not yielded to—why then hasten or delay between them? This turn of thought is well made.

The life of man is by nature without sufficient joy, yet one cannot abandon life to seek death. *To set aside* means to be without intent; to set aside one’s thoughts and follow nature—thus it is said: set aside and yield to it. If one can fully grasp this notion, then even the distinction between setting aside and yielding vanishes—how then could one find leisure to calculate the swiftness or slowness between them?”

Yang Zhu said: “Bo Cheng Zigao would not sacrifice even a hair’s breadth to benefit others, relinquishing his state to retire and plow in seclusion. Great Yu would not seek personal gain even at the cost of his own body, enduring partial withering. The ancients would not surrender a single hair to benefit the world, nor would they accept the whole world to serve a single self. If each person refrains from sacrificing even a hair, if each person refrains from benefiting the world, the world will be well-ordered.”

Qinzi asked Yang Zhu: “If plucking a single hair from your body could save the age, would you do it?”

Yang Zhu said: “The age cannot truly be saved by a single hair.”

Qinzi said: “Suppose it could—would you do it?”

Yang Zhu did not answer.

Qinzi went out and told Meng Sunyang, who said: “You do not comprehend the Master’s heart. Allow me to explain. If someone could gain ten thousand gold by cutting into your flesh, would you do it?”

He replied: “I would.”

Meng Sunyang said: “If severing one of your limbs could win you a state, would you do it?”

Qinzi fell silent for a moment.

Meng Sunyang said: “A single hair is finer than flesh, flesh finer than a limb—this is evident. Yet flesh is but the accumulation of hairs, and a limb the accumulation of flesh. A single hair is indeed one ten-thousandth of the body—how can it be lightly discarded?”

Qinzi said: “I have no answer for you. Yet if you were to ask Lao Dan or Guan Yin, your words would be correct; if I were to ask Great Yu or Mo Di, my words would be correct.”

Meng Sunyang then turned and spoke of other matters with his disciples.

*Partial withering of the body* refers to Yu’s hands and feet calloused from labor. To use even a single hair of mine to benefit the world—I would not give it. To offer all things under heaven to me—I would not accept them.

This is what is called the teaching of "for oneself." The world is not a place that can be saved by a single hair—what benefit would sacrificing even one hair of mine bring to the world? And what use does the world have for a single hair? The hypothetical question of salvation asks: if a single hair could save the world, would you do it? Yangzi did not respond, for he did not express this idea in full. The body is the accumulation of limbs, and limbs the accumulation of hairs. To move even a single hair is to disturb something within one’s own body—how can it be lightly discarded for its smallness? This implies that even a slight inclination toward external affairs is not the Way of self-nurturance.

Qinzi said: “Given your argument, I find it difficult to answer. Yet Lao Dan and Guan Yin would agree with you, while Great Yu and Mo Di would not.” Meng Sunyang then turned to his disciples and spoke of other matters, implying: “Great Yu and Mo Di are not models my teacher follows—how can you compare them thus?”

Meng Sunyang was a disciple of Yang Zhu. Yang Zhu said: “The world’s praise is heaped upon Shun, Yu, the Zhou kings, and Confucius, while its blame falls upon Jie and Zhou. Yet Shun tilled the fields at Heyang and made pottery at Leize, his limbs never at rest, his mouth never tasting fine food, his parents displeased, his siblings estranged. At thirty, he married without informing his family. When he received Yao’s abdication, he was already aged and his wisdom in decline. When Shangjun proved unworthy, he passed the throne to Yu, living in constant sorrow until his death—such was the bitter fate of this sage. Gun failed in his governance of flood and earth, and was executed at Feather Mountain. Yu inherited his task, avenging his father’s failure, laboring over barren lands, his son left unraised, passing his own door without entering. His body withered, his hands and feet calloused, and when he received Shun’s abdication, he lived in humble quarters, adorned in fine robes and regalia, yet remained anxious until his death—such was the toil of this sage. After King Wu’s death, King Cheng was young and weak, and the Duke of Zhou took up the reins of governance. The Duke of Shao was displeased, and rumors spread among the four states. After three years in the east, he executed his brother and exiled another, barely preserving his own life, living in constant fear until his death—such was the peril of this sage. Confucius, who illuminated the Way of emperors and kings, responded to the summons of rulers of his time. He was driven to fell a tree in Song, erase his traces in Wei, impoverished in Shang and Zhou, besieged in Chen and Cai, humiliated by the Ji family, insulted by Yang Hu, living in perpetual distress until his death—such was the harried life of this sage. These four sages lived without a day of joy, yet died with names that endured for ten thousand generations. But a name is not something one can truly possess. Though praised, they knew it not; though rewarded, they knew it not—no different from a clod of earth. Jie, inheriting generations of wealth and the throne of the Son of Heaven, possessed intelligence to overawe his subjects and power to shake the realm. He indulged his senses and exhausted every desire, living in carefree abandon until his death—such was the dissolute life of this tyrant. Zhou, too, inherited generations of wealth and the throne of the Son of Heaven. His will was unopposed, his commands obeyed without fail. He gave free rein to his passions in the Leaning Palace, indulged his desires through long nights..."

They did not torment themselves with ritual and righteousness, but lived in carefree abandon until their execution—such were the wanton among heaven’s people. Those two villains enjoyed the pleasures of desire in life, yet died bearing the names of folly and brutality. Reality is not something names can bestow; though reviled, they knew it not; though praised, they knew it not—how did they differ from a clod of earth? Those four sages, though the objects of all praise, suffered to the end, yet all met the same death; those two villains, though the objects of all condemnation, reveled to the end, yet all met the same death.

The term *tianren* refers to the people under heaven. Among them, the most destitute and solitary, the most anxious and afflicted, the most fearful and harried—these are the most pressed and unable to find leisure. *Huangju* means pressed and unable to find respite. *Tianmin* is synonymous with *tianren*. *Zhukuai* refers to rotting wood and clods of earth. Once the body perishes, neither praise nor blame is known—what difference, then, between worthy and unworthy?

This passage is too stark in its argument. When Yang Zhu met King Hui of Liang, he claimed governing the world was as easy as turning one’s palm. The king replied: “You cannot even manage one wife and one concubine, nor tend a garden of three *mu*—how can you claim governing the world is as easy as turning your palm?” Yang Zhu answered: “Have you seen a shepherd? A hundred sheep in a flock, led by a five-foot boy carrying a switch—where he wishes them to go east, they go east; where he wishes them to go west, they go west. But if Yao were to lead a single sheep, with Shun carrying the switch behind him, they could not move forward. Moreover, I have heard that fish large enough to swallow a boat do not swim in shallow streams, and swans soar high without alighting in filthy ponds. Why? Their ambitions are too vast.”

The Yellow Bell and Great Lǚ cannot accompany frantic dances—why? Their tones are too sparse. He who would govern the great does not govern the petty; he who would achieve great deeds does not fuss over trifles. This is the meaning of it. Yao and Shun herding sheep could not match a five-foot boy—these words are most excellent, for they show that those capable of greatness are incapable of smallness. "Shallow streams" refers to minor tributaries. The *Zhuangzi*’s "Autumn Floods" chapter expresses a similar idea.

Yang Zhu said: The affairs of the distant past are extinguished—who records them? The deeds of the Three Sovereigns exist as if they exist not, as if waking or dreaming; the affairs of the Five Emperors seem half-real, half-illusory; the doings of the Three Kings appear now hidden, now revealed—of a hundred, not one is known. The events of one’s own lifetime may be heard or seen, yet of ten thousand, not one is truly grasped. The matters before one’s eyes may endure or vanish—of a thousand, not one is certain. From the distant past to the present, the years are too many to count. Since Fuxi’s time, over three hundred thousand years have passed—wisdom and folly, beauty and ugliness, success and failure, right and wrong—all have dissolved, differing only in how swiftly they fade. To fret over fleeting praise or blame, tormenting one’s spirit and body for the sake of a name lingering a few hundred years after death—can this moisten dry bones? Where is the joy in life?

"Extinguished" means obliterated and untransmitted. "As if they exist not," "as if waking or dreaming," "now hidden, now revealed"—the general sense is that the more distant the past, the more unknowable it becomes. Even momentary fame and reputation will vanish without a trace after a few centuries. Those who do good merely torment themselves in vain.

Yang Zhu said: Man resembles the class of Heaven and Earth, bearing the nature of the Five Constants. Of all living things, he is the most spiritually endowed. Yet man’s claws and teeth are insufficient for defense, his flesh too frail to shield himself, his speed inadequate to evade harm or pursue advantage. Lacking fur or feathers to withstand cold and heat, he must rely on external things to nourish his nature, depending on wisdom rather than strength. Thus, what wisdom values is preserving oneself; what strength degrades is encroaching upon others. Yet the body does not truly belong to oneself—once born, one cannot but preserve it; external things do not truly belong to oneself—once possessed, one cannot discard them. The body is the master of life, just as things are the masters of sustenance. Though one preserves life, one cannot claim ownership of the body; though one does not discard things, one cannot claim ownership of them. To claim ownership of the body or things is to wrongfully appropriate the world’s body and the world’s things. Only the sage does not do so. To share the world’s body and the world’s things—only the perfected person achieves this. This is called the utmost of the utmost.

"Nourishing one’s nature" means nourishing life. Relying on wisdom rather than strength—wisdom preserves the self, while strength contends with things. Preserving the self is noble; encroaching upon things is base. Encroaching upon things means clashing and struggling with them. One’s body and life cannot but be preserved. Things outside the self are not one’s own—if not one’s own, they become burdens, and one cannot but distance oneself from them. Yet the body is the very means by which one lives, just as things are the means by which one sustains life. Though the body is dear, it is not always free—how can one claim to possess it? Though things may be discarded, some cannot be abandoned—how can one harbor the intent to discard them? This is what *Zhuangzi* meant by "things cannot be relied upon, yet cannot be done without." To regard things or the body as one’s own is to defy the principles of Heaven and act selfishly—hence, "wrongful appropriation." The sages of the world are like this; these words subtly mock all from Yao and Shun onward. Only by entrusting one’s body to no-body and external things to no-thing, free from selfish desires, does one become a perfected person. "The utmost of the utmost" means reaching the ultimate limit, beyond which nothing can be added.

Yang Zhu said: The people cannot rest because of four things—longevity, fame, rank, and wealth. Possessing these four, one fears ghosts, fears others, fears authority, and fears punishment—such a person is called a fugitive. Life and death are controlled by external forces. If one does not defy fate, why crave longevity? If one does not pride oneself on nobility, why crave fame? If one does not seek power, why crave rank? If one does not covet riches, why crave wealth? Such a person is called a compliant one. In all the world, none can oppose them; their fate is controlled from within.

Thus, the saying goes: Without marriage or office, half of human desires vanish; without clothing or food, the way of ruler and subject ceases. A Zhou proverb says: "A farmer can be killed by sitting." Rising at dawn and returning at dusk, he takes his nature as constant; sipping beans and chewing greens, he considers his fare the finest. His flesh is coarse and thick, his sinews and joints sturdy and supple. But if one morning he is placed upon soft furs and silken curtains, served fine grains, meat, orchids, and citrus, his heart will grow restless, his body agitated, and internal heat will breed illness. If the lords of Shang and Lu were to share the farmer’s lot, they would not last a day before exhaustion. Only when one has desires does one have fears. Authority brings hidden and manifest fortunes and misfortunes; punishment refers to the execution and mutilation of royal law. A fugitive is one who flees from Heaven and turns against principle. Such a person’s life and death are controlled by others—hence, "fate is controlled externally." The compliant one, free from pride, envy, or worldly desires, stands alone above all—hence, "in all the world, none can oppose them." Their fate lies within, not controlled by others—hence, "fate is controlled internally." Marriage and office give rise to human desires; the way of ruler and subject is maintained through clothing and food. Without marriage and office, desires could be halved.

If freed from the burden of clothing and food, then ruler and subject could no longer employ one another. This must be an observation from ancient times. That a farmer may be killed by sitting idle means that if one from the fields, coarse and lowly, were made to sit at leisure without need of blade or spear, they would surely fall ill—bones aching, body wasting—for they are accustomed to toil, and sudden ease would bring sickness. Were the lords of Shang and Lu to exchange places with field laborers, they could not endure even a moment. As Zimei said: *"Without noble or base, there is no sorrow; without wealth or poverty, there is sufficiency."* The meaning of this passage seems akin to this. It speaks of how human life is but a matter of habit—if all toiled bitterly and ate plainly, unaware of the world’s honors and pleasures, then none would feel want. The moment thoughts cease, all places become peaceful. These words carry weight.

Thus, what rustics find contentment in, what they deem beautiful, they believe nothing in the world surpasses. Formerly, in the state of Song, there was a field laborer who wore only tattered hemp to endure the winter. When spring came and he began his eastern work, he basked in the sun, unaware of the world’s grand halls, warm chambers, silk floss, or fox-fur robes. Turning to his wife, he said: *"The warmth of the sun upon my back is a joy unknown to others. If I were to offer it to our lord, I would surely receive great reward."* A wealthy man of the village told him: *"Once, a man praised the excellence of wild beans, sweet hemp stalks, water celery, and duckweed seeds to a local magnate. The magnate took them and tasted them—bitter on the tongue, agonizing in the belly. The crowd laughed and reviled him, and the man was deeply ashamed. You are of the same sort."* The rustic’s contentment, his sense of beauty, comes from believing nothing in the world surpasses what he knows—he is at peace with what his eyes have seen and unaware of anything beyond.

*"Tattered hemp"* refers to rags of broken flax. To seek reward for the joy of basking in the sun is to illustrate his narrow vision, seeing only what is small and not what is great. *"Wild beans"* are large beans; *"sweet hemp"* is fine hempseed; *"water celery"* is a soup made from silk celery; *"duckweed seeds"* are another kind of vegetable. *"Stung"* means poisoned—they were acrid in the mouth, speaking of their fierce bitterness.

Yang Zhu said: *"Grand houses, fine clothes, rich flavors, and beautiful women—with these four, what more could one seek? Yet those who possess them and still seek beyond are insatiable by nature. Such insatiability gnaws at the balance of yin and yang."* Once these four are attained, a person’s life should be self-sufficient, yet those who still pursue fame and achievement are insatiable. *"Gnaws at yin and yang"* means that insatiability harms the body’s vital qi.

Loyalty is insufficient to secure a ruler’s peace and only endangers oneself; righteousness is insufficient to benefit others and only harms one’s life. Peace for superiors does not arise from loyalty, and so the name of loyalty perishes; benefiting others does not arise from righteousness, and so the name of righteousness vanishes. The ancient Way was for ruler and subject to be at peace together, for self and others to benefit alike. This passage also satirizes those who establish names through loyalty and righteousness, saying that loyalty must endanger the self and righteousness must harm one’s life—this is called attending to externals rather than internals. The reality of securing peace for superiors arises naturally; how could the loyalty of one person alone bring it about? The way of benefiting others also arises naturally; how could the righteousness of one person alone achieve it? To seek the name of loyalty and righteousness through personal ambition is to see the name vanish and only burden the self. Better to follow nature, so that ruler and subject are both at peace and self and others both benefit—this is the so-called ancient Way.

The *Yuzhi* says: *"Abandon names, and there is no sorrow."* Laozi said: *"Names are but guests of reality."* Yet the careless world pursues names without end. If names truly cannot be abandoned, can they truly be treated as mere guests? Now, to have a name is to be honored and exalted; to lack a name is to be lowly and disgraced. Honor brings ease and joy; disgrace brings sorrow and suffering. Sorrow and suffering violate one’s nature; ease and joy accord with it. These are the realities to which names are tied. How can names be abandoned? How can they be treated as mere guests? The danger lies in clinging to names and thereby burdening reality. Clinging to names and burdening reality will lead to irreparable peril—how can one then distinguish between joy and sorrow?

*"Abandon names, and there is no sorrow."* *"Names are but guests of reality."* Though these words come from the *Yuzhi* and Laozi, the world knows them well. Yet the careless world pursues names without cease—how can the words of these two masters serve as a warning? *"Guest"* means external; thus, names cannot be abandoned, nor can they be treated as external. People of this world take having a name as honor and delight, and lacking a name as disgrace and sorrow. They see sorrow as violating their nature and delight as according with it, and so they pursue names without end. *"These are the realities to which names are tied"* means that the violation or accord of one’s nature is tied to tangible gains and losses—one cannot help but seek them. Thus, though the two masters wished to abandon names, how could they be abandoned? Though they wished to treat names as external, how could they be made external?

Having fully expounded this, the text concludes by observing the ways of the world: though names cannot be abandoned or set aside, clinging to them too fiercely will lead to self-harm. In matters of nurturing life, this brings the peril of irreparable ruin—how then can one distinguish between suffering and joy? *"Pity"* means sorrow. This meaning is that those in the world who ceaselessly seek fame will ultimately destroy themselves—this is the consequence of loving joy and fearing sorrow, leading to self-destruction.

The seventh scroll of *The True Classic of Perfect Virtue and Empty Tranquility, Oral Teachings from the Yan Studio*, is now complete.

**Volume Eight of *The True Classic of Perfect Virtue and Empty Tranquility, Oral Teachings from the Yan Studio* by Lin Xiyi of the Yan Studio**

**Explaining the Talisman (Shuofu) Eighth**

*The Zhuangzi* speaks of *"Virtue’s Full Manifestation"* (Dechongfu), while this is called *"Explaining the Talisman"* (Shuofu). Though the character *fu* (符) is the same, its meaning differs.

*Fu* means "to accord." It signifies that the most profound words naturally align with the harmony of Heaven and humanity—hence the title *Shuofu*.

*The Liezi* comprises eight scrolls, with only the first and last bearing this title; the six in between are named by their opening two characters. It is likely the original text was not structured otherwise.

Master Liezi studied under Master Huqiu Zilin.
Master Huqiu Zilin said: "If you understand *holding to what comes after*, then we may speak of *holding the self*."
Liezi replied: "I wish to hear of *holding to what comes after*."
The master said: "Observe your shadow, and you will understand."

Liezi turned to examine his shadow: when the body was bent, the shadow appeared crooked; when the body was straight, the shadow was upright. Thus, crookedness and straightness follow the body and do not reside in the shadow. Flexion and extension depend on the object, not on the self—this is what it means to *hold to what comes after* and yet *dwell before all things*.

Guan Yin said to Master Liezi: "Beautiful words produce a beautiful echo; foul words produce a foul echo. A tall body casts a long shadow; a short body casts a short shadow. *Name* is the echo; *self* is the shadow. Thus it is said: Be cautious in your speech, for harmony will follow; be cautious in your conduct, for consequences will follow. Therefore, the sage observes outcomes to know others, examines the past to foresee the future—this is the principle by which they attain foreknowledge. Measurement lies in the self; verification lies in others. If others love me, I must love them in return; if others despise me, I must despise them in return. Tang and Wu loved the world, and so they ruled; Jie and Zhou despised the world, and so they perished—this is what is verified. When both measurement and verification are clear yet the Way is not followed, it is like leaving without using the door or walking without taking the path. How can one seek profit without difficulty?

I have observed the virtue of Shennong and the Flame Emperor, examined the records of Yu, Xia, Shang, and Zhou, and weighed the words of refined scholars and worthies. In all matters of preservation and ruin, rise and fall, there has never been a case that did not proceed from this Way.

*Holding to what comes after* means not preceding things. One who can *hold to what comes after* can thereby *hold the self*—for only by humbly placing oneself below others can one preserve the self. As for the shadow, it is your shadow. The shadow bends or straightens with the body; I flex or extend with things. The shadow does not precede the body; I do not precede things. One who can grasp this principle will always dwell before all things—this is also the meaning of *not contending for excellence yet surpassing others*.

Speech is sound. The echo responds to sound just as the shadow mirrors the body. Without seeking fame, fame naturally arrives; without prizing the self, the self naturally precedes. By following the pattern of echo and shadow rather than form and sound, one attains the Way. The sage’s Way is precisely this: through *non-speech*, others naturally harmonize; through *non-action*, others naturally follow—this is the inevitable principle. As going out must lead to returning, and departing must lead to coming, others may not know, but the sage knows—this is the sage’s foreknowledge, as if saying, *I have already grasped what all hearts must affirm*.

*Measurement* is the ruler. To measure an object is to *verify*. *Measurement lies in the self* means using the self as the standard to verify others. What others love in me, I must also love; what others despise in me, I must also despise—this speaks of the shared human sentiments of love and aversion. Tang and Wu were thus loved by the world and so ruled it; Jie and Zhou did not follow this Way and were despised by the world, and so lost their states. These are verifiable, historical events—one may examine Tang, Wu, Jie, and Zhou to see this. When what can be measured and verified is so clear, yet people do not follow the Way, it is like leaving without using the door or walking without taking the path. To seek profit without harm is difficult indeed.

The examples of Shennong, the Flame Emperor, Yu, Xia, Shang, and Zhou are all proven cases. Since ancient times, the words of refined scholars and worthies have all been thus. To seek the causes of rise and fall, preservation and ruin, yet not follow this Way—such a thing has never existed.

This passage is pure in its phrasing and upright in its argument, yet it differs markedly from the rest of this book. Could it be that the earlier sections were *deceptive speech* while this is *direct discourse*? Or is the text a patchwork, not the work of a single author?

Yan Hui said: "Those who inquire about the Way do so for the sake of wealth. Now that I have obtained a pearl, I am wealthy—why would I need the Way?"
Master Liezi replied: "Jie and Zhou prized profit and slighted the Way, and so they perished. How fortunate I did not speak to you earlier! A person without righteousness, who seeks only to eat, is no different from a chicken or a dog. Those who fiercely compete for food, locking horns, with the stronger dominating the weaker—these are the ways of beasts. To act like chickens, dogs, or beasts, yet desire others’ respect, is impossible. If others do not respect you, then danger and disgrace will befall you."

*Competing for food* means fighting over it. *Locking horns* refers to clashing like animals with antlers. The stronger overpower the weaker—this is the way of beasts. If a person knows nothing but seeks food, they act like beasts and will surely bring danger and disgrace upon themselves.

This passage also seems not to belong to this book, though its principles are quite sound.

Liezi had mastered archery and reported this to Master Guan Yin.
Master Guan Yin asked: "Do you know *why* you hit the mark?"
Liezi replied: "I do not."
Master Guan Yin said: "Then it is not yet time."
He withdrew and practiced further. After three years, he returned to report to Master Guan Yin.

Master Guan Yin said: "Do you now know *why* you hit the mark?"
Liezi replied: "I know."
Master Guan Yin said: "Then you may hold to this and not lose it. This is not only true of archery—governing a state and cultivating the self are likewise.

Thus the sage does not examine whether things exist or perish, but examines *why* they are so. At first, when asked about hitting the mark, you said you did not know—you had not yet grasped the Dao of hitting the mark. Now, when asked again, you say you know—you have grasped the Dao of hitting the mark. I tell you to hold to this and not lose it, so that you may preserve this Dao without forgetting it.

Yet if you *know* that you hit the mark, this is no longer the ‘knowing without knowing’; if you hold to it without losing it, this is no longer the discourse on the transforming Dao.

Existence and perishing are what can be seen. *Why* things are so is the underlying principle. Judging by such arguments, these passages do not belong to the teachings of Zhuangzi or Liezi, but rather approach those of our Confucians. This is why I suspect they may not be part of the original book.

Liezi said: When one’s appearance is flourishing, one becomes arrogant; when one’s strength is flourishing, one becomes reckless—such people cannot be spoken to of the Dao. Thus, even those whose hair is not yet streaked with white, if they speak of the Dao, will err—how much more so if they try to practice it?

Therefore, if one acts recklessly, no one will instruct them. If no one instructs them, they will be isolated and without support. The worthy delegate to others, and so even in old age they do not decline; even when their wisdom is exhausted, they do not fall into chaos.

Thus the difficulty in governing a state lies in knowing the worthy, not in considering oneself worthy. When one’s appearance is flourishing, arrogance shows in their face; when one’s strength is flourishing, they rely on brute force to prevail. Those whose hair is not yet streaked with white have little experience in the world and have not aged in worldly matters. With so little experience, how can they know the right and wrong, the gains and losses of the Dao? If even speaking of it is not yet possible, how much less so practicing it?

To act recklessly is to act on one’s own. If one has the mindset of self-reliance, who would be willing to teach them the good Dao? If no one instructs me, then I stand alone without support. To remain undiminished in old age means that, though my strength may be exhausted, I delegate to others to take my place; though my wisdom may be spent, I rely on others to plan for me—thus affairs are managed without disorder.

What is valued is not one’s own worthiness, but the ability to recognize worthiness. As the *Gongyang Commentary* says: ‘To be able to honor the worthy is to make the worthy also worthy.’ This aligns with the same idea. These arguments are quite sound, though it remains uncertain whether they truly originate from the *Liezi*."

An artisan of Song crafted for his lord a mulberry leaf from jade, taking three years to complete it. Its edges and veins, its finest striations and lustrous sheen, were so lifelike that when mixed among real mulberry leaves, none could distinguish it. Thereupon, this man lived by his skill throughout the state of Song.

Master Liezi heard of this and said: "Were heaven and earth to take three years to produce a single leaf, few things would bear leaves at all." Thus the sage relies on the transformative power of the Dao and not on clever skill.

*Feng* refers to the sharp edges of the leaf; *sha*, to the trimmed and tapered parts; *haomang*, to the veins and textures on the leaf; *fan*, to the abundance of such textures; and *ze*, to its lustrous color. *Dao-transformation* is non-action; *clever skill* is human effort. This analogy is most apt.

Master Liezi was impoverished, his countenance bearing the pallor of hunger. A visitor spoke of this to Ziyang of Zheng, saying: "Lie Yukou is surely a man of the Dao. That he dwells in your lord’s state yet suffers want—does this not suggest the lord fails to esteem scholars?" Ziyang of Zheng immediately ordered an official to send him grain. Master Liezi went out to meet the messenger, bowed twice, and declined. The messenger departed.

When Master Liezi returned home, his wife gazed at him and, striking her breast, said: "I have heard that the wives of those who possess the Dao all live in ease and joy. Yet you bear the look of hunger. The lord, recognizing his fault, sent you grain, and you refused it—is this not fate?" Master Liezi laughed and replied: "The lord does not truly know me. He sent me grain on another’s word, and should he condemn me, it would likewise be on another’s word. This is why I did not accept." In the end, the people indeed rose in revolt and killed Ziyang. If one knows me by another’s words, one will surely condemn me by another’s words—this shows he fundamentally does not understand me. To trust only the words of others, how can one be secure? As Wei Yang said: 'If a lord cannot employ me on your word, he will not kill me on your word either.' This is of the same kind. These seem like words from the Warring States period, yet they make for a fine tale.

The phrase "the lord, recognizing his fault, sent you grain" means the lord, considering it a failing not to esteem scholars, sent grain as a gift.

The Lu family of the Shi clan had two sons: one devoted to learning, the other to martial arts. The one fond of learning offered his arts to the Marquis of Qi, who accepted him and made him tutor to the noble scions. The one fond of martial arts went to Chu and presented his methods to the King of Chu, who was pleased and appointed him military commander. Their salaries enriched the household, and their ranks brought honor to their kin.

The Shi clan’s neighbor, the Meng family, also had two sons with the same pursuits, yet they were reduced to poverty. Envying the Shi clan’s fortune, they earnestly sought the means to advance. The two sons truthfully told the Meng family. One of the Meng sons went to Qin and offered his arts to the King of Qin. The King of Qin said: "Now the feudal lords contend with force, and all they attend to is arms and provisions. If I were to govern my state with benevolence and righteousness, it would be the path to ruin." He then castrated and banished him. The other son went to Wei and presented his methods to the Marquis of Wei. The Marquis of Wei said: "I am a weak state, hemmed in among great powers. I serve the great states and soothe the small—this is the way to seek security. If I were to rely on military power, destruction would soon follow. If I let you return intact to another state, the harm you would bring me would be no small matter." He then had his feet cut off and sent him back to Lu.

Upon their return, the father and sons of the Meng family beat their breasts and reproached the Shi clan. The Shi clan said: "Those who meet the moment prosper; those who miss it perish. Your path was the same as ours, yet your success differed—you missed the moment, not that your conduct was flawed. Moreover, in the world, principles have no constant right, and affairs no constant wrong. What was once employed may now be discarded; what is now discarded may later be used. This use or disuse has no fixed right or wrong. Seizing opportunities and adapting to the times, responding to affairs without fixed method—this belongs to wisdom. If wisdom is insufficient, even if one’s learning were as vast as Confucius’s or one’s strategies as those of Lü Shang, where could one go and not meet with failure?" The father and sons of the Meng family relaxed their expressions, free of resentment, and said: "We understand. Say no more."

Though their learning was the same, their circumstances differed. The moment brings success or failure—this is fate.

"Formerly" refers to the past. "Seizing opportunities and adapting to the times" means observing the gaps in the times and riding the moment to respond, without fixed place—this is the work of clever skill. Thus it is said: "Responding to affairs without fixed method belongs to wisdom." The meaning is that though you knew that devotion to learning or martial arts could be used to present your case, you could not adapt to the times and thus suffered mutilation and punishment—this shows a lack of clever skill. This again slightly contradicts the earlier idea of relying on Dao-transformation and not on clever skill. "Say no more" means there is no need to bring it up again.

Duke Wen of Jin went out to a meeting, intending to attack Wei. Gongzi Chu looked up to the heavens and laughed. The Duke asked why he laughed. He replied: "I laugh at a neighbor who was seeing his wife off to her parents' home. On the road, he saw a woman gathering mulberry leaves and, pleased, spoke with her. Yet when he turned to look at his wife, there was someone beckoning to her as well. I secretly laughed at this."

The Duke understood his meaning and halted the campaign. He led his army back, and before they arrived, someone had already raided the northern border of Jin.

This passage resembles the *Records of the Grand Historian: Biographies of Jesters*. Its meaning is that what one dislikes should not be imposed on others. If I can inflict something upon others, then others can inflict it upon me as well.

The state of Jin suffered from banditry. There was a man named Xi Yong who was skilled at discerning thieves by their appearance, examining their brows and lashes to uncover their true nature. The Marquis of Jin sent him to identify thieves, and not one in a thousand or a hundred escaped him. The Marquis was delighted and told Zhao Wenzi: "I have found one man, and the bandits of the entire state will be eradicated. Why would I need more?"

Wenzi replied: "If our lord relies on spies and surveillance to catch thieves, the thieves will never be fully eliminated. Moreover, Xi Yong will certainly not meet a good end."

Soon after, the bandits plotted among themselves: "The one who has cornered us is Xi Yong." They then joined forces to ambush and kill him.

When the Marquis of Jin heard this, he was greatly alarmed. He immediately summoned Wenzi and told him: "Just as you said, Xi Yong is dead. But what method should we use to capture thieves?"

Wenzi replied: "There is a Zhou proverb: 'He who sees the fish in the depths brings misfortune; he who discerns hidden things invites calamity.' If you wish to eliminate banditry, there is no better way than to appoint worthy men and entrust them with governance, so that instruction is clear above and transformation flows below. When the people have a sense of shame, what need is there for bandits?"

Thereupon, the state employed Sui Hui to oversee governance, and the bandits fled to Qin.

This passage illustrates how exposing hidden wrongs and uncovering secrets instead provokes contention among the people. Confucius said: "In hearing litigation, I am no different from others. What is essential is to make litigation unnecessary." He also said: "If you yourself do not desire it, though you reward them, they will not steal." This is the same idea.

Confucius, returning from Wei to Lu, rested his carriage by a bridge over the river and observed the waters. There was a cataract thirty *ren* high, its currents swirling for ninety *li*, where fish and turtles could not swim, nor could alligators and giant salamanders dwell. Yet a man was about to ford it.

Confucius sent someone along the bank to stop him, saying: "This cataract is thirty *ren* high, its currents swirl for ninety *li*, where fish and turtles cannot swim, nor alligators and giant salamanders dwell. Surely it is too perilous to cross?"

The man paid no heed, waded in, and emerged safely. Confucius asked him: "Is this skill? Or do you have some Daoist technique? How were you able to enter and exit?"

The man replied: "When I first entered, I relied on loyalty and trust. When I exited, I again followed loyalty and trust. Loyalty and trust placed my body amidst the waves, and I dared not act on private motives. That is how I was able to enter and exit."

Confucius said to his disciples: "Take note, all of you. If even water can be crossed by relying on loyalty and trust to align oneself with it, how much more so with people?"

*Li* (厉) means to ford water. As the *Book of Songs* says: "Where deep, wade through; where shallow, lift your robes." "Surely it is too perilous to cross" means it seemed impossible to ford. "Paid no heed" means he did not regard the peril of the waves. *Loyalty and trust* means sincerity. Placing oneself in the currents with loyalty and trust, without a trace of private motive, is how one can enter and exit the water.

The meaning of *loyalty and trust* here should not be sought in the conventional sense of the words in my writings. It broadly refers to sincerity alone.

The first half of this passage is identical to the Lü Liang episode in the *Yellow Emperor* chapter. Such repetition should not occur in the *Liezi*, which further confirms its杂乱. Moreover, the phrasing "first with loyalty and trust, then following with loyalty and trust" (先以忠信，又从以忠信) differs entirely from the style of the *Zhuangzi* and *Liezi*. If one remains in the realm of *with* (以), one has not yet undergone transformation. If one still clings to it without transformation, how could one traverse such a境界?

Duke Bai asked Confucius: "Can one speak in subtle terms with others?"

Confucius did not respond.

Duke Bai asked again: "If you throw a stone into water, what then?"

Confucius replied: "A skilled diver from Wu could retrieve it."

Duke Bai said: "If you pour water into water, what then?"

Confucius replied: "When the waters of the Zi and Meng rivers merge, Yi Ya could taste and distinguish them."

Duke Bai said: "Is it truly impossible to speak in subtle terms with others?"

Confucius replied: "Why would it be impossible? Only one who knows the meaning of words can do so. One who knows the meaning of words does not rely on words to convey meaning. Those who fight over fish get wet; those who chase beasts run—yet they do not do so for pleasure. Thus, the highest speech transcends words, and the highest action is non-action. What shallow minds contend over is trivial."

Duke Bai, unable to proceed further, later died in his bathhouse.

*Subtle speech* refers to hidden language. Duke Bai wished to rebel but dared not speak openly to seek Confucius' approval. Confucius understood his intent and thus did not answer.

"Throwing a stone into water—divers can retrieve it" means it is easily obtained. "Pouring water into water seems difficult, yet Yi Ya could distinguish them." The implication is that there is no principle by which words can be hidden; nothing spoken remains concealed from others.

Duke Bai, failing to grasp this, asked again whether subtle speech was truly impossible. "Why would it be impossible?" means: Is there truly anything in subtle speech that cannot be understood? Those who know the principle of words understand them. The principle of words lies not in the words themselves but beyond them, hence: "does not rely on words to convey meaning."

Those who fight over fish must enter the water—how could they not get wet? Those who chase beasts must enter the mountains—how could they not run and exhaust themselves? Pursuing things at the cost of harming oneself is no cause for joy.

Here the implication subtly rebukes his ill-conceived schemes.

Ultimate speech is the Dao; words cannot exhaust the Dao, and to depart from words is to attain the Dao. Ultimate action is the Dao; deliberate action cannot exhaust the Dao, and only non-action fully embodies the Dao. To employ shallow and clumsy wisdom in contending with the world is to fail to grasp the root. The overarching meaning is that the impulse to compete must not arise. Though Duke Bai understood these words, he could not restrain himself, and so ultimately rebelled and perished. "Could not restrain himself" means he was unable to cease. This entire chapter is identical to the "Dao and Its Applications" section of the *Huainanzi*. If the *Liezi* had already appeared by the time of Emperor Jing, the *Huainanzi* would not have copied it wholesale—thus we may be certain this is not the original text of the *Liezi*.

Viscount Xiang of Zhao sent Xin Zhi Muzi to attack the Di; he prevailed and captured the towns of Zuoren and Zhongren, then dispatched a courier to announce the victory. Viscount Xiang was eating when the news arrived, and his expression turned troubled. His attendants said, "In a single morning, two cities have fallen—this is cause for joy. Why does my lord appear distressed?" Viscount Xiang replied, "The greatness of the Yangtze and Yellow River lasts no more than three days; violent winds and torrential rains do not endure past morning; the sun at its zenith does not linger. Now the virtue and conduct of the Zhao house have not been cultivated over time, yet in a single morning two cities have fallen—ruin will surely overtake us." Confucius heard of this and said, "The Zhao house will flourish. For it is through concern that one flourishes, and through rejoicing that one perishes. Victory is not the difficult part; maintaining it is. A worthy ruler sustains victory in this way, and so his blessings extend to later generations. Qi, Chu, Wu, and Yue all frequently prevailed, yet ultimately met their downfall, for they did not understand how to sustain victory. Only a ruler who embodies the Dao can maintain victory."

Xin Zhi Muzi was a retainer of Viscount Xiang of Zhao. The Di were the same as the northern tribes. Zuoren and Zhongren were the names of two towns. The courier was a postal relay runner. "Violent winds and torrential rains do not endure past morning" is a saying from the *Laozi*. "The sun at its zenith does not linger" refers to the sun’s inevitable decline. The accumulation of virtue and conduct had not yet been extended to others, hence: "virtue and conduct have not been cultivated over time." Zichan said, "Without civil virtue but with military achievement"—this expresses the same idea. "Ruin will surely overtake us" means he feared arrogance would lead to defeat. Those who are able to be concerned will surely be secure; those who rejoice in themselves will surely invite disaster. Thus, achieving victory is not difficult—sustaining it is. This argument is entirely sound.

Confucius was so strong he could lift the crossbar of a city gate, yet he refused to be known for his strength. Mozi devised defensive strategies, and Gongshu Ban conceded defeat, yet Mozi refused to be known for his military skill. Thus, those who are adept at sustaining victory turn strength into weakness. "Lift" means to raise. "Refused to be known for his strength" means he was praised for his virtue, not his physical power. Gongshu Ban’s siege engines were the most refined of his time, yet he could not breach Mozi’s defenses, and was ultimately forced to submit—yet Mozi was not celebrated for his military knowledge. These two examples serve as metaphors for concealing courage in timidity and sustaining victory as if bearing a burden.

There was a man of Song who diligently practiced benevolence and righteousness for three generations without faltering. His family’s black ox unexpectedly bore a white calf, and he asked Confucius about it. Confucius said, "This is an auspicious omen; offer it in sacrifice to the Supreme Deity." A year later, the man’s father inexplicably went blind, and the ox again bore a white calf. The father once more instructed his son to ask Confucius. The son said, "Last time we asked, you lost your sight—why ask again?" The father replied, "The words of a sage may initially seem contrary but later prove fitting. The matter is not yet resolved—let us ask again." The son once more consulted Confucius, who again said, "It is auspicious," and instructed him to perform the sacrifice. The son returned and relayed the message. His father said, "Follow Confucius’ words." A year later, the son also inexplicably went blind. Later, Chu attacked Song and besieged its capital. The people resorted to exchanging children to eat and breaking bones for fuel. The able-bodied all mounted the walls to fight, and more than half perished—yet this man and his father, being afflicted, were spared. When the siege was lifted, their sight was restored. This chapter shares the same meaning as the parable of the old frontier man who gained and lost horses: fortune does not necessarily preclude misfortune, nor misfortune fortune. "Initially seem contrary but later prove fitting" means that what does not appear true at first will prove true later. "Not yet resolved" means the final outcome remains unknown.

There was a man of Song called Lanzi who sought an audience with the Lord of Yuan through his skills. The Lord of Yuan summoned him and had him demonstrate his art. Lanzi bound two long poles twice his height to his shins and ran swiftly back and forth, juggling seven swords in rapid succession, with five constantly in the air. The Lord of Yuan was astonished and immediately bestowed gold and silk upon him. Another Lanzi, skilled in acrobatics, heard of this and also sought an audience with the Lord of Yuan. The Lord of Yuan grew furious, saying, "Previously, someone with extraordinary skills sought my favor. His skills were of no use, but it so happened I was in high spirits, so I rewarded him with gold and silk. He must have heard of this and come seeking my favor again—he expects another reward." He had the man arrested and nearly executed, only releasing him after a month.

The binding of two poles to the shins is what people today call the "stilt-walking" performance. The "two poles" are two pieces of wood. Juggling seven swords with five constantly in the air—this performance also exists today. The "Yan acrobatics" refers to the skills performed amid feasting and revelry. "Skills of no use" means they were inherently without practical purpose, and he happened to reward them out of delight. "Arrested and nearly executed" means he detained and intended to punish him. Though their skills were the same, their fates differed—such is the unpredictability of circumstance.

Duke Mu of Qin said to Bo Le, "You are advanced in years. Among your descendants, is there anyone I could send to seek horses?" Bo Le replied, "A fine horse can be described by its form, appearance, sinews, and bones. But the horse of the world—it is as if vanished, as if lost, as if gone without a trace. Such a horse leaves no dust in its wake, outstrips the arrow’s flight. My sons are all of mediocre talent; they may be taught how to recognize a fine horse, but not how to recognize the horse of the world. I have a man with whom I once gathered firewood and shared greens—his name is Jiu Fang Gao. In matters of horses, he is no inferior to me. I beg you to meet him." Duke Mu received him and sent him forth to seek a horse.

After three months, he returned and reported, "I have found it—it is in Shaqiu." Duke Mu asked, "What kind of horse is it?" He replied, "A yellow mare." The duke sent men to fetch it, only to find it was a black stallion. Displeased, Duke Mu summoned Bo Le and said, "It is ruined. The man you sent to seek a horse cannot even discern its color or sex—how could he know anything of horses?"

Bo Le sighed deeply and said, "Has it truly come to this? This is why he surpasses me ten thousandfold without measure. What Jiu Fang Gao observes is the celestial mechanism: he grasps its essence and forgets its coarse form, attends to its inner nature and disregards its outward appearance. He sees what ought to be seen and overlooks what need not; he regards what should be regarded and ignores what should not. Such is the judgment of one who values the horse itself above all. When the horse arrived, it proved indeed to be the horse of the world."

*[Note: "子姓" refers to one’s descendants. "姓" derives from "生," meaning birth. The horse of the world is one that surpasses all others. "Vanished, lost, gone without a trace" describes its elusive, intangible nature—beyond form or description. "Leaves no dust" means it outpaces even the dust it raises; "outstrips the arrow’s flight" means it leaves no tracks. "Gathered firewood" refers to carrying firewood with a rope. "Surpasses me ten thousandfold without measure" means his ability exceeds mine beyond all reckoning. The "celestial mechanism" is the innate nature grasped while form is forgotten. What is seen is what heaven reveals; what is unseen—coat, color, sex—lies in the external.]*

King Zhuang of Chu asked Zhan He, "How should one govern the state?" Zhan He replied, "I am enlightened in cultivating the self but not in governing the state." The king said, "I have been entrusted with the ancestral temples and the altars of soil and grain. I wish to learn how to preserve them." Zhan He answered, "I have never heard of a well-ordered self leading to a disordered state, nor of a disordered self leading to a well-ordered state. Thus, the root lies in the self—I dare not speak of mere branches."

The king said, "Well said." This is the principle that the root of state and world lies in the self—a most excellent discourse.

The Elder of Huqiu said to Sunshu Ao, "There are three sources of resentment—do you know them?" Sunshu Ao asked, "What are they?" The elder replied, "Those with high rank are envied; those with great office are resented by their lord; those with generous emolument are beset by grievances."

Sunshu Ao said, "As my rank rises higher, my aspirations grow humbler; as my office grows greater, my heart grows smaller; as my emolument grows richer, my generosity grows wider."

"By this means, may one avoid the three resentments?" When Sunshu Ao fell ill and was near death, he admonished his son, saying: "The king has repeatedly offered to enfeoff me, but I have not accepted. When I die, the king will surely enfeoff you. You must not accept fertile land. Between Chu and Yue, there is a place called Qinqiu—this land is inauspicious, and its name is most ill-omened. The people of Chu revere ghosts, and the people of Yue are superstitious; only this place can be held in perpetuity."

After Sunshu Ao died, the king indeed offered his son fine land. The son declined and requested Qinqiu instead. It was granted to him, and to this day, his family has not lost it. The name of the town of Qinqiu resembles that of a burial ground, hence it is called "most ill-omened." "Inauspicious" means disadvantageous to the land’s lord. The people of Chu believe in ghosts and spirits, while the people of Yue favor divination and omens, abounding in taboos. They would surely despise this land and desire it no more, so that none would contend for it—thus it could be held forever. The underlying meaning is that by taking what others discard and securing what none contend for, one may preserve one’s peace.

Niu Que was a great Confucian scholar from Shangdi. Traveling to Handan, he encountered bandits in the marsh of Ōusha, who took all his clothing and carriage. Niu walked away unhurried, his countenance free of distress or regret. The bandits pursued him and asked the reason. He replied, "A noble man does not harm what he nurtures for the sake of what nurtures him." The bandits exclaimed, "Ah! How worthy he is!" Then they conferred among themselves: "With his worthiness, if he goes to see the lord of Zhao and gains influence, he will surely regard us as thorns in his side. Better to kill him." So they pursued and slew him.

When the people of Yan heard of this, they gathered their clans and warned one another: "If you meet bandits, do not be like Niu Que of Shangdi." They all heeded the lesson. Soon after, Niu Que’s younger brother traveled to Qin. At the pass, he too encountered bandits. Remembering his brother’s warning, he fought fiercely with them. When he could not prevail, he pursued them with humble pleas for his belongings. The bandits grew enraged: "We spared your life—how generous!—yet you persist in following us. Our tracks will be exposed. Since we are already bandits, where is our humanity?" They killed him and slaughtered four or five of his companions as well.

"Traveling to Handan" refers to descending from Shangdi, which is high ground, to Handan, which lies low. Ōusha is the name of a place. "Gains influence" means that if he were employed in his time, he would surely regard the bandits as obstacles. This passage suggests that misfortune does not depend on whether one is worthy or foolish—some escape it, others do not—all follows the natural order, beyond human comprehension.

The Yu family was a wealthy household of Liang. Their wealth overflowed, their money and silk were measureless, their treasures beyond reckoning. They ascended a high tower overlooking the main road, where they set out music and wine and played dice. A group of swordsmen followed them as they walked, and one of the gamblers on the tower shot an arrow, piercing a bright jade target. The dice were cast, the wooden pieces clattered, and laughter rose like fish breaking the water’s surface. Just then, a kite soaring overhead dropped a rotten rat, which struck the target. The swordsmen conferred among themselves: "The Yu family has long enjoyed wealth and pleasure, yet they have always held others in contempt. They have not wronged us, yet they have humiliated us with a rotten rat. If we do not avenge this, how can we stand among the bold knights of the world?"

"Let us join forces with one mind, lead our followers, and surely exterminate his household to set an example for our peers." All assented. On the appointed night, they gathered their forces and weapons, attacked the Yu family, and utterly destroyed their household.

*Ming qiong* refers to dice of the present kind. *Zhang zhong* means to set up the target and determine victory or defeat by whether one’s shot hits it. *Mu xi yu* is the name of a dice combination: among the five white faces, flipping two of them constitutes the *mu xi yu* throw. Liu Yi’s contest over the *xiao lu* throw belongs to this category.

Just as laughter rose on the tower, a kite in the sky happened to drop a rotten rat, striking a swordsman walking below outside the tower. Though unrelated to them, the swordsmen grew enraged and took vengeance on the Yu household—akin to the tale of weak Lu wine bringing siege to Handan, or the city gate’s fire bringing disaster to the pond’s fish: fortune and misfortune arise beyond all expectation.

*Li qin* means to establish a reputation for valor. *Deng lun* refers to the swordsmen’s peers.

In the east there was a man named Yuan Jingmu. As he traveled, he collapsed from hunger on the road. A thief from Hufu named Qiu saw him and offered a gourd of food to feed him. After three mouthfuls, Yuan Jingmu could finally see. He asked, "Who are you?" The man replied, "I am Qiu of Hufu." Yuan Jingmu said, "Bah! Are you not a thief? Why do you feed me? I will not eat your food on principle." Pressing his hands to the ground, he retched violently but could bring nothing up—*ke ke*. Then, still retching, he collapsed and died.

The man of Hufu was indeed a thief, yet the food he offered was not stolen. To judge the food as tainted merely because the giver was a thief, and thus refuse to eat—this is to confuse name and reality.

Yuan Jingmu was a man’s name. This passage conveys his scorn for the gift and his resolve to reject it, even to the point of death. When Master Zhong of Wuling retched at the sight of his brother’s goose, Mencius likewise mocked him for this same misplaced principle.

Zhu Lishu served Duke Ao of Ju, but believing the duke failed to recognize his worth, he left and dwelt by the sea. In summer he ate water caltrop and water chestnut; in winter he ate acorns. When Duke Ao faced peril, Zhu Lishu bade his friends farewell and went to die for him. His friends said, "You left because you believed he did not know you. Now you go to die for him—how is this different from being known or unknown?" Zhu Lishu replied, "Not so. I left because I believed he did not know me. Now, by dying for him, I prove he truly did not know me. I will die to shame future rulers who fail to recognize their ministers. To die for one who knows you, and not for one who does not—this is the straightforward way of the world." Zhu Lishu may be called one who, in his resentment, forgot his own life.

The case of Lang Shen in the *Zuo Tradition* follows this same principle. To resent one’s lord for not knowing one, and thus go so far as to die—this is not the straightforward way. Yet to die in order to shame future rulers who do not know their ministers—this intention is admirable.

Yang Zhu said: "Benefit given brings real reward; resentment sent invites harm in return. What is initiated here finds response abroad—this is the nature of requests. Thus the worthy are cautious in what they put forth. If I extend benefit to others, then the reality of that benefit will return to me. If I act unjustly toward others, causing them to harbor resentment against me, then harm will come to me in turn." This speaks to the principle of reciprocity.

*Wei* means "yes." When someone makes a request of me and I assent, then when I make a request of others, they too will assent. What is initiated here is the act of giving; what responds abroad is the act of repayment. To be cautious in what one puts forth means to refrain from imposing on others. This is the meaning of "what goes around comes around."

Yangzi’s neighbor lost a sheep. The man not only led his own household in pursuit but also asked Yangzi’s servant to join the chase. Yangzi said, "Hmph! Why so many chasing one sheep?" The neighbor replied, "There are many branching paths." When they returned, Yangzi asked, "Did you catch the sheep?" The man said, "It was lost." Yangzi asked, "How was it lost?"

He replied, "Among the branching paths there are yet more branches. I knew not where to go, and so I returned." Yangzi’s countenance fell into sorrow, and for a long while he did not speak; for the rest of the day he did not smile.

His disciples, perplexed, asked, "The sheep is but a lowly beast, and not even yours to lose. Why then this loss of words and mirth?"

Yangzi gave no answer, and his disciples could not fathom his intent. His student Meng Sunyang went out and told this to Xin Duzi.

Another day, Xin Duzi came with Meng Sunyang and asked, "Once there were three brothers who traveled between Qi and Lu, studying under the same master and returning home to practice the Way of benevolence and righteousness. Their father asked, ‘What is this Way of benevolence and righteousness?’

The eldest said, ‘Benevolence and righteousness make me cherish my life first, then my reputation.’
The second said, ‘Benevolence and righteousness make me sacrifice my life to achieve reputation.’
The youngest said, ‘Benevolence and righteousness make me preserve both life and reputation.’

These three methods are at odds, yet all stem from the Ru. Which is right, and which is wrong?"

Yangzi said, "There was a man who lived by the river. Skilled in water, bold in swimming, he plied a boat to ferry passengers, earning enough to feed a hundred mouths. Those who came with provisions to learn from him gathered in numbers, yet nearly half drowned. They came to learn swimming, not drowning, yet the outcome was thus. How then would you judge right and wrong?"

Xin Duzi fell silent and departed. Meng Sunyang reproached him, "Why did you ask such a roundabout question, only for the Master to answer so obliquely? Now my confusion is greater still."

Xin Duzi said, "The great Way, when riddled with branching paths, loses the sheep. The scholar, when led astray by many directions, forfeits his life. The root of learning is not different, nor is it not one, yet the branches diverge so. Only by returning to unity and reverting to oneness can one avoid loss and gain, ruin and preservation.

You have long stood at the Master’s gate, studied the Master’s Way, yet fail to grasp the Master’s sentiment—how lamentable!

Xin Duzi’s question shares the same vein as Zigong’s inquiry about Boyi and Shuqi.

*Qi* means a fork in the road. ‘Among the branching paths there are yet more branches’ describes divisions upon divisions, likening them to the disunity of learning. Yangzi’s sorrow and silence were born of feeling.

The Ru is one, yet it has three methods—this is the many branches. *Cheng tu* means a multitude; it is like saying a gathered throng. That those who came to learn swimming drowned instead illustrates how the later currents of learning often betray their origins, losing their true essence.

Xin Duzi’s silent departure showed he grasped the meaning beyond the words.

The great Way is a broad path. When it is one, the sheep is not lost; when it branches, the sheep is lost. Learning is originally the same, but when it diverges into many directions, lives are lost—this is the root being one while the branches differ.

‘Returning to unity’ means converging upon the ultimate Way and reverting to the principle of ultimate oneness, where there is neither gain nor loss.

*Kuang* means sentiment. If one does not understand the Master’s sentiment, how can one practice the Master’s Way?

This chapter unfolds through layered analogies in question and answer, a style also found in later Chan responses.

Yang Zhu’s younger brother, Yang Bu, went out wearing white clothes. When it rained, he removed his white garments and returned in black. His dog, not recognizing him, barked and rushed at him. Yang Bu grew angry and was about to strike the dog.

Yang Zhu said, "Do not strike it. You would do the same. If your dog had gone out white and returned black, how could you not be startled?"

This chapter suggests that those who do not understand the principle of ultimate oneness are seldom unaltered by external things. The dog, seeing white clothes turn black, how could it not bark? If a man saw a white dog turn black, how could he not be astonished? Seeing the outer without perceiving the inner—this is common to all.

Yang Zhu said, "To practice goodness without seeking fame, yet fame follows; fame does not seek profit, yet profit comes; profit does not seek contention, yet contention arises. Thus the noble person must be cautious in doing good."

This reflects Zhuangzi’s idea of "doing good without drawing near to fame." When fame arises, profit inevitably follows; when profit comes, contention is sure to follow. Thus, one who does good must forget the self and relinquish fame to succeed.

Once there was a man who claimed to know the Way to immortality. The Lord of Yan sent someone to learn it, but the attempt failed, and the man died. The Lord of Yan was furious and was about to punish his envoy.

A favored courtier advised, "What people fear most is death; what they value most is life. He has already lost his own life—how could he secure yours? Do not punish him."

Another man from Qi also wished to learn the Way. Hearing that the first man had died, he struck his chest in regret. Fuzi heard of this and laughed, saying, "He wished to learn immortality, yet the man is dead, and he still regrets it—he does not understand the purpose of learning."

Huzi said, "Fuzi’s words are wrong. There are those who possess a method but cannot practice it, and those who can practice it but lack the method."

A man of Wei skilled in calculation, on his deathbed, imparted his secrets to his son. The son memorized his father’s words but could not put them into practice. When others asked him, he repeated what his father had told him.

The inquirer applied his father’s words and practiced his method, matching his father’s skill without discrepancy. If so, why could the dead not transmit the art of life? Those who receive it yet fail to master it—"mastery" means swiftness; if one’s practice is not swift, they will not live to see their teacher again.

The skilled calculator excelled in mathematics. The meaning of this passage is that learning is not difficult, but practice is; knowing is not as good as doing. The analogy of the immortality teaching is most apt.

Why could the dead not transmit the art of life? It means that though the man is dead, the method of longevity he taught remains valid—only that people cannot practice it.

On the first day of the first month, the people of Handan presented doves to Jianzi, who was greatly pleased and rewarded them generously. A guest asked the reason. Jianzi said, "On New Year’s Day, I release living creatures to show my benevolence." The guest replied, "The people know you wish to release them, so they compete to capture them, and many die. If you truly wish to preserve life, it would be better to forbid them from capturing creatures in the first place. To capture and then release them—your kindness cannot compensate for the harm." Jianzi said, "You are right."

This analogy closely reflects human nature. Many in the world today commit the same error, such as releasing fish and turtles in Gushan Lake, only for them to be sold multiple times in a single day.

The Qi nobleman Tian held a sacrificial feast in his courtyard, hosting a thousand guests. At the feast, someone presented fish and wild geese. Tian looked at them and sighed, saying, "Heaven is generous to the people. It cultivates the five grains and gives life to fish and birds for their use." The assembled guests echoed his words like an echo.

The son of the Bao family, aged twelve, was present among the guests. He stepped forward and said, "Your words are not so. Heaven and earth, the myriad things, and I are born together—we are of the same kind. Among kinds, there is no nobility or baseness; they merely dominate one another by size, wisdom, or strength, devouring each other in turn. They are not born for one another’s sake. Humans take what is edible and eat it—how could Heaven have originally created them for human use? Moreover, mosquitoes and gnats bite the skin, and tigers and wolves eat flesh—was Heaven originally creating humans for mosquitoes and gnats, or flesh for tigers and wolves?"

This passage expounds the Buddhist notion of a world where great creatures devour small ones. Its reasoning holds merit, as when humans eat chickens and chickens eat ants—things are not born for one another’s sake. Heaven does not create the hundred creatures for humanity. The analogy of mosquitoes, gnats, tigers, and wolves is apt. The phrase "非天本为蚊蚋生人" should read "岂天本为蚊蚋生人."

In Qi, there was a poor man who often begged in the marketplace. The townspeople, weary of his frequent appeals, refused to give him anything. He then went to the stables of the Tian family, where he worked under the horse-doctors and received food in return. Someone in the city mocked him, saying, "Working for the horse-doctors for food—is that not shameful?" The beggar replied, "Of all shames in the world, none surpasses begging. If begging is not shameful, how could working for the horse-doctors be?" This sentiment suggests that people occupy different stations, yet all are mired in shame without realizing it—echoing Zhuangzi’s idea of mutual deference among servants, and subtly reflecting Mencius’ reference to the beggar at the grave-mound, though less overtly.

A man from Song was traveling along a road when he found a lost contract. He took it home and hid it, secretly counting its notches. He told his neighbor, "I shall soon be rich!" The notches represented the quantities of goods listed on the contract. Rejoicing over an empty contract is an analogy for valuing hollow names without substance. Su Shi’s poem employing "urn calculations" carries the same meaning.

A man had a withered parasol tree. His elderly neighbor said, "A withered parasol tree is inauspicious," so the man promptly cut it down. The neighbor then asked to take it as firewood, at which the man grew displeased. He said, "That old neighbor only wanted firewood and urged me to cut it down. To live beside such a treacherous man—how can this be?" The warning about inauspiciousness was well-intentioned, but the request for firewood aroused suspicion of self-interest. This illustrates the difficulty of discerning worldly motives and the ambiguity between public and private interests. The analogy is most apt. The phrase "若此其险" stands alone, followed by "岂可哉" as a three-character clause.

A man lost his iron and suspected his neighbor’s son. He observed the boy’s gait, demeanor, expressions, speech, and every movement—all seemed to confirm the theft. Later, he dug in his grain cellar and found the iron. The next time he saw the neighbor’s son, none of his movements resembled a thief. This passage illustrates how suspicion breeds illusions. When the mind is doubtful, even an innocent person appears guilty in every detail. The analogy keenly captures the subtleties of human nature.

Bai Gong Sheng was plotting rebellion. After dismissing court, he stood lost in thought, leaning on his staff upside down. The iron tip of the staff pierced his chin, and blood flowed to the ground, yet he remained unaware. A man from Zheng heard of this and said, "If one can forget one’s chin, what else might one forget?" When the mind is fixated, one may stumble over roots or strike one’s head against rough wood without realizing it. Such is human nature. "倒杖策" means using the staff upside down to prod oneself. "錣" refers to the sharp end of the staff. "株" means wood, and "埳" means a pitfall. When the mind is preoccupied, even obstacles in one’s path go unnoticed—echoing *The Great Learning*: "When the mind is not present, one sees without seeing, hears without hearing."

Once, a man from Qi coveted gold. At dawn, he dressed and went to the market, where he approached a gold-seller’s stall, seized the gold, and fled. The authorities caught him and asked, "With so many people around, why did you seize another’s gold?" He replied, "When I took the gold, I saw nothing but the gold." Fixated on seizing gold, he saw no one—like one chasing beasts who fails to see Mount Tai. This shows how obsession clouds the mind.

The arguments in this chapter are sound and align with Confucian texts. The latter analogies are particularly well-crafted, and the prose differs from other sections. Among the eight chapters of this book, its authenticity is debatable. Several passages closely resemble the style of *Robber Zhi’s Discourse on Swords*, making it clear they were not written by Liezi. Though the arguments here are sound, they do not reflect Liezi’s school of thought. Only those well-versed in the various traditions can discern this.

*The True Classic of Perfect Virtue, Oral Teachings of Yan Zhai, Volume Eight* concludes.
