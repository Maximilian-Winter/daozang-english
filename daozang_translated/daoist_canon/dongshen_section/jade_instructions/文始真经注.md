### **Guan Yinzi**
Guan Ling Yin Xi was a grandee of the Zhou dynasty. When Laozi journeyed west, Yin Xi perceived a purple qi hovering over the pass and knew a true person would pass through. He awaited and observed, and indeed encountered Laozi. Laozi, recognizing his extraordinary nature, composed a text for him. After receiving Laozi’s work, Yin Xi himself wrote nine chapters, titled *Guan Yinzi*. Today, the Taihu Guan in Lingbao County, Shanzhou, marks the ancient Hangu Pass where he awaited Laozi. The Zongsheng Gong on Mount Zhongnan was Yin Xi’s former residence; King Mu of Zhou later renovated its thatched pavilion, renaming it Louguan and establishing a shrine to Laozi. The rise of Daoist temples truly began here.

After transmitting the scripture, Laozi exited through the Dasan Pass and later met Yin Xi again at the Green Ram Market in Chengdu, where he bestowed upon him the title *Wenshi Xiansheng* (Master of the Primordial Beginning). The book he composed became the *Wenshi Zhenjing* (True Scripture of the Primordial Beginning).

### **Postscript to the *Wenshi Zhenjing Zhijie* (Direct Explication of the True Scripture of the Primordial Beginning)**
Bright as the full moon, its radiance is seen in a thousand rivers; wondrous existence arises from true emptiness, pervading the ten thousand scrolls of scripture. By water one perceives the moon’s round clarity; through scripture one awakens to wondrous existence. Round clarity has the bright moon as its root; wondrous existence has true emptiness as its source. Root and branch are one; source and flow are not distinct. Following the branch, one returns to the root; tracing the flow, one reverts to the source. The source is true emptiness—beyond all conception; the flow is wondrous existence—yet not confined to singular silence. The scripture is the wordless word; the wondrous is the speechless speech. The speechless speech is offered before words; the wordless word illumines beyond meaning. Before words lies profound mystery; beyond meaning dwells abyssal depth. Without direct explication, it is hard to fathom; without detailed annotation, it remains obscure. By the finger one sees the moon and forgets the finger—thus the true moon shines forth. Through explication one awakens to the scripture, and the true scripture becomes utterly clear. Seeing the moon’s reflection in a thousand rivers, one knows the single moon as the guiding principle. Investigating the true purport of the palm-held scripture, one awakens to the singular true essence that governs all. Seeing and knowing both dissolve; investigation and awakening are both forgotten. The celestial eye and dragon’s gaze—how could they glimpse even a shadow? The numinous wisdom of sages—how could it fathom even a trace? Beyond meaning, it defies thought; before words, it eludes discourse.

### **Commentary on the *Wenshi Zhenjing*, Fascicle One**
**Direct Explication by Shenfeng Xiaoyaozi Niu Daochun**

#### **The "One Character" Chapter**
The character *yu* (宇) is a metaphor for the Way of true emptiness. This chapter comprises twenty-eight sections.

**Guan Yinzi said:**
Without the Dao, it cannot be spoken.
That which is "without the Dao" refers to the fundamental absence of any forced attribution of "Dao," and thus it cannot be discussed in words. As the scripture says: "Only that which cannot be named"—this is why it "retires all words under heaven." Hence, it is said: without the Dao, it cannot be spoken.

That which cannot be spoken *is* the Dao.
This is awakening before words. Before any discourse arises, one clearly awakens to the wondrous Dao—thus words cannot reach it. Hence, it is said: that which cannot be spoken *is* the Dao.

Without the Dao, it cannot be contemplated.
Not only is there no forced name for the fundamental absence of Dao, but it also does not belong to thought. Thought pertains to the knowing and understanding of consciousness. The Dao cannot be known or recognized. Thus, it is said: "As soon as it falls into thought, it becomes the ghost’s livelihood." This is precisely the meaning. As the scripture says: "Only that which cannot be known"—this is why it "seizes all wisdom under heaven." Hence, it is said: without the Dao, it cannot be contemplated.

That which cannot be contemplated *is* the Dao.
This is awakening before thought. Before any thought arises, one clearly awakens to the wondrous Dao—only then does one know that thought cannot reach it. Hence, it is said: that which cannot be contemplated *is* the Dao.

Heavenly things surge in furious flow; human affairs are tangled and chaotic.
"Heavenly things" refers to the original endowment of celestial truth. "Anger" is majestic radiance—its brilliance vast and boundless. "Flow" is the heart-mind, its source streaming into the six functions, intermingling with human affairs in ceaseless confusion. As the scripture says: "Nature is water; the heart-mind is flow." Hence, it is said: heavenly things surge in furious flow; human affairs are tangled and chaotic. "Tangled" means mixed. It speaks of deluded people engaging with the Dao, their understandings scattered and divergent, as in the text below.

Seeming yet turning away,
"Seeming" means resemblance or likeness. One imagines the Dao as resembling the great void, the bright moon, a limpid pool, or a crystal vase. Such imaginings and comparisons are far removed from the Dao. Hence, it is said: seeming yet turning away. "Turning away" means divergence.

Clashing like a state at war,
"Clashing" is the sound of striking. "State" refers to contention. It warns against debating the Dao through verbal disputes. Hence, it is said: "Taking one’s endowment as doors and windows, each opens in its own way; using scriptural debate as shields and spears, they attack one another." This is the warning against contention. Hence, it is said: clashing like a gaping void.

Hurriedly, it seems yet is not.
Do not think in images; do not debate in contention. Even if one’s understanding seems to align, it is not so. Hence, it is said: hurriedly, it seems yet is not.

And they contend over it,
"Contend" means striving for supremacy. When two or three people gather to study the Dao, those who are courageous and diligent, who take pride in their determination—such views have not yet awakened. Hence, it is said: and they contend over it.

And they isolate themselves over it,
"Isolate" means solitary and aloof. Dwelling alone, one meditates deeply on the wondrous Dao. Such views have not yet awakened. Hence, it is said: and they isolate themselves over it.

And they praise it.
"Praise" means extolling the words of the ancients to glorify the wondrous Dao. Following words to contemplate and praise the wondrous Dao—this has not yet awakened. Hence, it is said: and they praise it.

And they sigh over it,
"Sigh" means exclaiming and murmuring over the renowned sayings and dharma-attributes of the ancients, silently and deeply contemplating the wondrous Dao. Such views have not yet awakened. Hence, it is said: and they sigh over it.

And they discard it, and they seek it.
"Discard" means relinquishing; "seek" means grasping. Relinquishing all delusions to grasp the true Dao—where there is grasping and relinquishing, this is still deliberate action, and thus has not yet awakened. Hence, it is said: and they discard it, and they seek it.

Words are like blowing at shadows,
"Shadows" serve as a metaphor for names. This refers to those who ceaselessly debate, extol, praise, and exclaim over names and forms. To rebuke names and attributes with words is like blowing at shadows—it cannot dispel them. What does this mean?

Thoughts are like carving dust,
"Dust" serves as a metaphor for consciousness; "carving" means to chisel and sculpt. This refers to the aforementioned imaginings, comparisons, and the striving, contending, isolating, solitary contemplation, relinquishing, and grasping. Such are all attributes of consciousness—like carving dust, it cannot be purified completely.

Sage wisdom creates delusion,
Sage wisdom can comprehend the myriad dharmas, yet using wisdom to construct the Dao cannot reach it—thus, wisdom itself is delusion. Only by transcending sageliness and abandoning wisdom, awakening to the wondrous Dao, does one realize that wisdom itself is delusion. Hence, it is said: sage wisdom creates delusion.

Even spirits and gods do not comprehend it.
Spirits and gods cling to perceptions and views, yet perceptions and views cannot know the Dao. Hence, it is said: even spirits and gods do not comprehend it.

Only that which cannot be acted upon—
The Dao is fundamentally natural and does not rely on cultivation. Hence, it is said: cannot be acted upon.

*"Only"* here is a phrase connecting the above to the below.

Cannot be attained,
"Attained" means inviting from without. The Dao is inherently complete and does not rely on external seeking. Hence, it is said: one who enters through the gate does not possess the family treasure. Thus, it is said: cannot be attained.

Cannot be fathomed,
The Dao is difficult for even spirits and gods to perceive; yin and yang cannot fathom it—how much less can ordinary beings? Hence, it is said: cannot be fathomed.

Cannot be divided,
The Dao is the undifferentiated principle of Heaven, profound and unfathomable. Thus, it cannot be divided or debated through the mind, words, or thoughts. Hence, it is said: cannot be divided.

Thus, it is called Heaven, called Mandate, called Spirit, called Mystery—together, they are called the Dao.
"Thus" is a phrase connecting the above to the below. "Heaven" is non-action that acts, naturally so. "Mandate" is that which is so without knowing why. "Spirit" refers to the unfathomable workings of yin and yang. "Mystery" is the profound and unfathomable, mystery upon mystery. "Together" means to harmonize and awaken. Only by awakening to Heaven, Mandate, Spirit, and Mystery does one harmonize with the wondrous Dao.

This chapter clarifies that the Dao does not reside in words or thoughts but in the awakening and profound harmony of the human heart.

**Chapter One**
Guan Yinzi said: There is no single thing that is not Heaven,
"Heaven" is naturally so, and "naturally so" is another name for the Dao. All things are born of the Dao, and thus each thing is the Dao—just as waves arise from water, and thus each wave is water. Hence, it is said: there is no single thing that is not Heaven.

There is no single thing that is not Mandate,
"Mandate" is that which is so without knowing why, and "without knowing why" is another name for the Dao. All things possess the Mandate of the Dao. Hence, it is said: there is no single thing that is not Mandate.

There is no single thing that is not Spirit,
"Spirit" is the spirit that is not spirit, the unfathomable workings of yin and yang—another name for the Dao. All things possess the Spirit of the Dao. Hence, it is said: there is no single thing that is not Spirit.

There is no single thing that is not Mystery.
"Mystery" is the profound and unfathomable—another name for the Dao. All things possess this Mysterious Dao. Hence, it is said: there is no single thing that is not Mystery.

If things are thus, how could humans be otherwise?
Heaven and Earth, the myriad things—great and small, coarse and fine, flying and crawling, moving and still—all possess the wondrous Dao. How could humans be otherwise? Hence, it is said: if things are thus, how could humans be otherwise?

All people may be called Heaven, all may be called Spirit, all may attain Mandate and penetrate Mystery.
Heaven, Mandate, Spirit, and Mystery are all alternative names for the Dao. Though the names are four, the Dao is not two. The Dao is complete in every person, inherently present in each. If one awakens, without relying on cultivation, one immediately realizes the unborn and stands equal to all sages. Hence, it is said: all people may be called Heaven, all may be called Spirit, all may attain Mandate and penetrate Mystery.

There is no "that Heaven" and "this non-Heaven," no "that Spirit" and "this non-Spirit," no "that Mandate" and "this non-Mandate," no "that Mystery" and "this non-Mystery."
Every person possesses their original, innate Heavenly truth; every person possesses the Spirit that is not spirit; every person possesses the Mandate that is so without knowing why; every person possesses the profound and unfathomable Mystery. Heaven, Mandate, Spirit, and Mystery—whether in the ordinary or the sage, they neither increase nor diminish; whether fine or vast, they neither lessen nor multiply. How could one say that only those things possess them while I alone do not? Hence, it is said: there is no "that Heaven" and "this non-Heaven," no "that Spirit" and "this non-Spirit," no "that Mandate" and "this non-Mandate," no "that Mystery" and "this non-Mystery."

Therefore, those who are adept in my Dao, within a single thing, know Heaven and exhaust Spirit, attain Mandate and reach Mystery.
"Therefore" is a phrase connecting the above to the below. "Those who are adept in my Dao" means that within a single thing, one knows Heaven and exhausts Spirit, attains Mandate and reaches Mystery—this is awakening to the Dao from the subtle. Hence, it is said: the entire ten-direction world is the Dao-person’s eye; the entire ten-direction world is the Dao-person’s body; the entire ten-direction world is one’s own light; the entire ten-direction world resides within one’s own light. However one moves, one merely acts within the realm of light and shadow. Only by awakening to the state before light and shadow arise does one truly realize that the Dao is everywhere. Within a single thing, one awakens to Heaven, Mandate, Spirit, and Mystery—nothing else.

Hence, it is said: therefore, those who are adept in my Dao, within a single thing, know Heaven and exhaust Spirit, attain Mandate and reach Mystery.
"Know" means to awaken; "attain" and "reach" both mean to arrive. This speaks of the ultimate realization of my Dao.

Those who study cling to distinctions, while names dissect what is essentially the same. Learners chase after the differences in Heaven, Mandate, Spirit, and Mystery, dividing names while failing to recognize the unchanging truth of the Dao. They are deluded by names and lost to reality. Hence, it is said: those who study cling to distinctions, while names dissect what is essentially the same.

When attainment aligns with sameness, reality forgets differing names. The Dao originally has no name; through names, one awakens to the Dao. The Dao is reality, while names are but guests to reality. Through names, one contracts and awakens to the truth that though names differ, reality does not. Awakening to reality, one forgets names—like catching fish and forgetting the trap, catching rabbits and forgetting the snare, grasping meaning and forgetting words. Names are but words. Hence, it is said: when attainment aligns with sameness, reality forgets differing names.

This chapter clarifies that the Dao is everywhere, and in awakening to reality, one forgets names.

Chapter Two

Guan Yinzi said: To observe the Dao is like observing water. To observe is to reflect; with wisdom, one reflects on principle, just as one reflects upon water. This is a borrowed analogy.

To consider observing a mere pond insufficient—ponds are metaphors for ordinary people. When one’s wisdom is shallow, one measures others by it, and though one may possess the Dao, one doubts that the Dao is fully present in ordinary people. Hence, it is said: to consider observing a mere pond insufficient.

Then one turns to rivers, to the Yangtze, to the sea, saying, “This is the ultimate of water.” To turn is to go forth. Rivers are metaphors for noble ones, the Yangtze for the worthy, and the sea for sages. Doubting that the Dao is fully present in ordinary people, one then observes noble ones. Still doubting that the Dao is fully present in noble ones, one then observes the worthy. Still doubting that the Dao is fully present in the worthy, one then observes sages, only then ceasing to doubt and declaring the Dao’s ultimate state. Hence, it is said: then one turns to rivers, to the Yangtze, to the sea, saying, “This is the ultimate of water.”

Yet one fails to realize that one’s own saliva, tears, and mucus are all water. Saliva, tears, and mucus are metaphors for movement and stillness, speech and silence. One fails to realize that movement and stillness, speech and silence are all functions of the Dao. Through function, one awakens to essence, only then trusting that the Dao is no less present in the ordinary, no more present in noble ones, the worthy, or sages. Hence, it is said: yet one fails to realize that one’s own saliva, tears, and mucus are all water.

This is the concluding analogy. This chapter clarifies that the Dao is neither lacking nor excessive, equally and fully present in sages and ordinary people alike.

**Chapter Three**

Master Guan Yin said: The Dao is without person—sages do not perceive it. *Jia* is the Dao; *yi* is not the Dao.

*Jia* represents the sage; *yi* represents the ordinary person. The Dao is fundamentally without the mark of self—how could it have the mark of person? One who has realized the Dao, the sage, forgets their own views and thus does not perceive it. The sage is the Dao; the ordinary person is not the Dao. Hence it is said: the Dao is without person—sages do not perceive it. *Jia* is the Dao; *yi* is not the Dao.

The Dao is without self—sages do not perceive it. One may advance toward the Dao or retreat from the Dao.

To advance is to grasp; to retreat is to discard. The Dao cannot be grasped when sought, nor lost when abandoned. Since the Dao is without the mark of self, the sage forgets their views and thus does not perceive it. One may advance toward the Dao in grasping it or retreat from the Dao in discarding it. Hence it is said: the Dao is without self—sages do not perceive it. One may advance toward the Dao or retreat from the Dao.

Because it does not possess the Dao, it is not without the Dao.

The Dao does not belong to being or non-being; the sage’s subtlety is impartial. This explains why one does not perceive *jia* as the Dao and *yi* as not the Dao. Hence it is said: because it does not possess the Dao, it is not without the Dao.

Because it does not attain the Dao, it does not lose the Dao.

The Dao does not belong to attainment or loss; it is originally and spontaneously complete. This explains why one does not perceive advancing toward the Dao or retreating from it. This chapter clarifies that the Dao does not belong to being or non-being, attainment or loss.

**Chapter Four**

Master Guan Yin said: One who does not know the Dao yet recklessly conjectures and divines is like shooting at an overturned vessel.

One who does not know the Dao is a deluded person. One who recklessly conjectures and divines is one who vainly uses the intellect to speculate about the Dao. To shoot is to guess; the overturned vessel is a metaphor for the dust of delusion that obscures. The deluded person, failing to awaken to the wondrous Dao, vainly uses the intellect to speculate about it, like guessing at what lies beneath an overturned vessel. Hence it is said: one who does not know the Dao yet recklessly conjectures and divines is like shooting at an overturned vessel.

Those of lofty understanding say: “There is gold, there is jade.”

Gold and jade are metaphors for profound and wondrous words. Moreover, gold represents clarity; jade represents luminous purity. Those of superior wisdom, vainly using the intellect to speculate about the wondrous Dao, say it is as clear as gold, as pure as jade.

Some say: “gold-lead and jade-mercury,” or “mysterious within the mysterious, the gate of all wonders.” Is this the Dao or not? Though the dust of delusion obscures, and though they grasp the most refined words, they still do not awaken. Hence it is said: those of lofty understanding say, “There is gold, there is jade.”

Those of middling understanding say: “There is horn, there is feather.”

Horn represents the sharpness of wisdom; feather represents the lightness and clarity of those of middling wisdom. Vainly using the intellect to speculate about the wondrous Dao, they say wisdom is sharp and penetrating, or that one should cultivate non-action, tranquility, preserve spirit, and keep the body light and healthy.

Some say: “like the antelope hanging by its horns, like the simurgh and phoenix soaring into the clouds.” Is this the Dao? Such guesses still do not lead to awakening. Hence it is said: those of middling understanding say, “There is horn, there is feather.”

Those of inferior understanding say: “There is tile, there is stone.”

Tile represents having undergone refinement through firing; stone represents firmness. Those of lesser wisdom, vainly using the intellect to speculate about the wondrous Dao, say one should temper the stubborn mind and remain single-minded, firm, and unshaken.

Some say: “The Dao is in tiles and rubble.” Is this the Dao or not? Such guesses lead even further from awakening. Hence it is said: those of inferior understanding say, “There is tile, there is stone.”

Is it so or is it not so?

Only one who has set things aside knows.

To set aside is to abandon; to know is to awaken. The three types of people above—lofty, middling, and inferior—vainly use the intellect to speculate about gold, jade, horn, feather, tile, and stone, judging whether they are the Dao or not. Only by abandoning things, forgetting the intellect within, and clearly awakening—when the overturned vessel of delusion is entirely removed and nothing obscures—does one trust that the Dao is not obtained from without. Hence it is said: Is it so or is it not so? Only one who has set things aside knows. This chapter clarifies that the Dao is realized through the heart’s awakening, not through reckless conjecture and divination.

**Chapter Five**

Master Guan Yin said: A single potter can make ten thousand vessels, yet never has a single vessel been able to make or harm the potter.

To mold clay is called *tao*; the potter is the craftsman who fires ceramics and tiles. A single potter can make myriad ceramic and tile vessels. The potter can cause vessels to be formed or destroyed, but how could a vessel form or destroy the potter? Hence it is said: a single potter can make ten thousand vessels, yet never has a single vessel been able to make or harm the potter. This is a borrowed analogy.

A single Dao can make ten thousand things, yet never has a single thing been able to make or harm the Dao.

The Dao moves yin and yang, giving rise to heaven, earth, and the ten thousand things. Hence it is said: a single Dao can make ten thousand things. To make is to generate. The Dao is like empty space, profound and unfathomable, originally and spontaneously complete, not dependent on cultivation or fabrication. Hence it is said: never has a single thing been able to make the Dao. Since the Dao is like empty space, how could the ten thousand things harm empty space? Hence it is said: never has a single thing been able to harm it. This is the concluding analogy. This chapter clarifies that the Dao gives rise to the ten thousand things, yet no thing can harm the Dao.

**Chapter Six**

Master Guan Yin said: The Dao is vast and without knowledge; the heart is free and without constraint; things follow one another and are without error.

The Dao is the essence of the heart; the essence of the heart is true emptiness. True emptiness is profound and obscure, vast and boundless—like the state before the arising of knowledge. Since the heart takes true emptiness as its essence, it is free and unbound by the myriad conditions. Things are the function of the heart; essence and function are not two. Responding to change while remaining ever tranquil, things follow one another without departing from the Dao. *Diedie* means to circulate without ceasing. Hence it is said: the Dao is vast and without knowledge; the heart is free and without constraint; things follow one another and are without error.

The lightning’s swiftness—

Those of great attainment, having realized the wondrousness of self-benefit and benefiting others, are persons of superior capacity. Their spiritual sharpness is swift as striking flint or flashing lightning. In the space of a thought, they traverse a thousand mountains and ten thousand rivers. Persons of superior capacity directly and suddenly awaken, penetrating the wondrous Dao. Hence it is said: the lightning’s swiftness.

The sand’s flight—

Those of great attainment, in their equality and universal beneficence, do not forsake the middle and lower capacities. With swiftness of spirit, they guide those of superior capacity; through skillful expedients, they broadly expound the ten thousand dharmas, pervading the realm of sand-grains to reach those of middle and lower capacity. Hence it is said: the sand’s flight.

The sand’s flight speaks of the vast expounding of the wondrous Dharma, like wind scattering dust and sand. The sage knows that heart is one, things are one, and the Dao is one—these three are again united as one.

Heart is one, things are one, the Dao is one: these three names of oneness are like the sun’s radiance. The sun is the essence of brightness; light is the function of brightness. Though there are three names, the Dao is not two. Hence it is said: the sage knows that heart is one, things are one, and the Dao is one—these three are again united as one.

Not by oneness measuring non-oneness.
"One" is the essence of non-duality; "measure" is the act of gauging. "Non-one" is the function of responding to change. Essence and function are not two; the function of non-function is like an echo resounding in an empty valley—responding to change while ever tranquil. One does not, from the essence, generate the heart to measure responses to change. Hence it is said: not by oneness measuring non-oneness.

Not by non-oneness harming oneness.
The function of non-function is like an echo resounding in an empty valley—responding to change while ever tranquil, essence and function as they are. One does not, by function, obstruct the essence. Hence it is said: not by non-oneness harming oneness. "Harm" means to obstruct.

This chapter clarifies that the Dao, heart, and things are not two; essence and function are ever thus.

---

**Chapter Seven**

Guan Yinzi said: Using a basin as a pond, a stone as an island, fish circle and swim without end, traversing countless thousands of miles—why is this so?

Water has no source, no return.
Encircling it is water; within it, a mountain called an island. Using a basin as a pond, placing a stone within as an island, and releasing fish into the water, the fish circle the stone endlessly, traversing countless thousands of miles without exhaustion. Why is this so? It is because the water has no source, no flow, no return—hence it is inexhaustible. This is a borrowed analogy. Thus it is said: using a basin as a pond, a stone as an island, fish circle and swim without knowing thousands of miles, yet never exhaust—why is this so? Water has no source, no return.

The sage’s Dao has no beginning, no end, and thus responds to things without exhaustion.
"Beginning" is the essence of true emptiness; "end" is the function of wondrous existence. The sage, having penetrated the Dao of true emptiness and wondrous existence, knows the Dao has no beginning or end, no measure to fathom it. Responding to the pivot of change, it is inexhaustible. Hence it is said: the sage’s Dao has no beginning, no end, and thus responds to things without exhaustion.

This chapter clarifies that the Dao has no beginning or end and responds to things without exhaustion.

---

**Chapter Eight**

Guan Yinzi said: Do not love the Dao—love is water.
"Do not" is a prohibitive term. To say "do not love the Dao" means the Dao does not belong to love. When the slightest thought of love arises, one falls into the five phases, becoming water—thus one is far from the Dao. Hence it is said: do not love the Dao—love is water.

Do not observe the Dao—observation is fire. Do not pursue the Dao—pursuit is wood. Do not speak of the Dao—speech is metal. Do not think of the Dao—thought is earth.
Do not attain the Dao through observation, pursuit, speech, or thought. The Dao does not belong to form, action, name, or emotion—how could it be fathomed by observation, pursuit, speech, or thought? When the slightest thought of observation, pursuit, speech, or thought arises, one falls into the five phases. Observation belongs to fire, pursuit to wood, speech to metal, thought to earth. Enslaved by the five phases, one is far from the Dao. Hence it is said: do not observe the Dao—observation is fire; do not pursue the Dao—pursuit is wood; do not speak of the Dao—speech is metal; do not think of the Dao—thought is earth.

This is a profound admonition to later learners.

Only the sage does not depart from fundamental nature and ascends the great Dao; when the heart has not yet arisen, the Dao is but a provisional name.
"Only" connects the preceding and following. "Only the sage does not depart from nature" refers to the state before the arising of love, observation, pursuit, speech, or thought. Before the arising of love, observation, pursuit, speech, or thought, this is the essence of true emptiness—true emptiness is the Dao. When the heart of true emptiness has not yet arisen, the name of the Dao is also provisionally established. Thus, there is not even a name for the Dao. This points the way for learners to awaken to the Dao. Hence it is said: only the sage does not depart from fundamental nature and ascends the great Dao; when the heart has not yet arisen, the Dao is but a provisional name.

This chapter clarifies that the Dao does not belong to the five phases and urges awakening before the arising of love, observation, pursuit, speech, or thought.

**Chapter Nine**

Guan Yinzi said: Dense clouds veil the sky, rivers and lakes grow dim; wandering fish are lost. Suddenly, they glimpse the shimmer of waves, the movement of food—believing it a gift from heaven, they rush toward it, and the fish are hooked and perish.

Dense clouds veil the night sky, thick and dark, obscuring the heavens. Without stars or moon to illuminate, the waters of rivers and lakes grow dim and shadowed. Wandering fish are lost and confused. Then, a fisherman casts a lantern’s light and bait into the water. The fish suddenly glimpse the shimmer of waves and the movement of food, unaware that it is a man’s bait. Believing it a gift from heaven, they rush to seize it—and the fisherman hooks and kills them. Thus it is said: dense clouds veil the sky, rivers and lakes grow dim; wandering fish are lost. Suddenly, they glimpse the shimmer of waves, the movement of food—believing it a gift from heaven, they rush toward it, and the fish are hooked and perish.

Not knowing the self is no-self, those who pursue the Dao are likewise.
Deluded people, obscured by ignorance, are like the sky veiled by dense clouds. Their minds are unclear, like rivers and lakes grown dim. Not awakening to the wondrous Dao, they are like wandering fish lost and confused. Drifting on the waves of intellect, they seek truth in dharmas—like suddenly glimpsing the shimmer of waves and the movement of food. The waves of intellect delude the Dao; the dust of dharmas obscures the heart—like the fish rushing toward the bait. Losing the Dao and deluding the true, they are like the fish hooked and perishing.

Those who do not know do not awaken. Not awakening to the self’s inherent no-self is the Dao of true emptiness. Yet clinging to a false self and seeking the Dao externally—this, too, is like the parable above. This is the synthesis of analogy and meaning, hence it is said: not knowing the self is no-self, those who pursue the Dao are likewise.

This chapter laments that the deluded, failing to awaken to the Dao, forfeit their lives.

**Chapter Ten**

Master Guan Yin said: The arts and techniques in the world are many. All beneath heaven—every school of thought—unfolds the Dao’s vast expanse. Thus it is said: the arts and techniques in the world are many. *Fang* is the Dao.

Some esteem concealment, some esteem clarity, some esteem strength, some esteem weakness. The hundred schools cannot be exhaustively listed; these four are but a rough outline. *Shang* means to value. Some value concealment, not wishing to be known; some value manifest display, teaching openly and brightly; some value the ability to act, ceaselessly strengthening themselves; some value yielding weakness, not contending with things. Thus it is said: some esteem concealment, some esteem clarity, some esteem strength, some esteem weakness.

Clinging to these is all *shi*; not clinging to them is all Dao. *Shi* means application. If one clings to esteeming concealment, clarity, strength, or weakness, these are all called *shi*. Clinging to application and losing sight of the essence—how can one penetrate the wondrous Dao? If one does not cling to application, then application becomes non-application, and there is nothing to attach to. With nothing to attach to, one departs from all extremes—this is called the wondrous Dao. Thus it is said: clinging to these is all *shi*; not clinging to them is all Dao.

This chapter clarifies that the Dao is present everywhere yet cannot be clung to.

**Chapter Eleven**

Master Guan Yin said: The Dao can never be attained. What can be attained is called *de* (virtue/power), not Dao. The Dao is fundamentally true emptiness, beyond gain and loss. Where there is gain, there is loss. The Dao resides in humanity—sage and commoner share the same essence, neither lacking nor excess. Like a newborn infant and an adult sharing the same body, yet not the same function.

Foolish people and sages share the same essence, yet not the same function. The essence is originally nameless; names arise according to function. When function is applied to evil, it is called a foolish person; when applied to good, a worthy person; when applied to nothing to be attained, a sage. Attaining nothing yet attaining it—this is called *de*, not Dao. Thus it is said: the Dao can never be attained. What can be attained is called *de*, not Dao.

The Dao can never be practiced. What can be practiced is called *xing* (conduct), not Dao. The Dao requires awakening of the heart, ascending the great Dao without departing from one’s original nature—thus it cannot be practiced. What can be practiced is called goodness, not Dao. Thus it is said: the Dao can never be practiced. What can be practiced is called *xing*, not Dao.

The sage employs what can be attained and practiced to perfect this life. The sage attains the Dao of self-benefit and benefiting others, universally and equally, seeking no reward—this is called *de* and *xing*. This *de* and *xing* perfect our interactions and benefit life. Thus it is said: the sage employs what can be attained and practiced to perfect this life—this is benefiting others.

By means of what cannot be attained or practiced, one perfects one’s death. Death is the heart’s rest. By means of what cannot be attained or practiced, one conceals all function. Concealing all function is non-action. Non-action perfects the heart’s rest. Thus it is said: by means of what cannot be attained or practiced, one perfects one’s death—this is self-benefit.

This chapter clarifies that *de* and *xing* are function, while the Dao is essence.

**Chapter Twelve**

Master Guan Yin said: After hearing the Dao, those who act and cling proceed toward the human. If a learner, after hearing the Dao, engages in deliberate action and clings to intellectual understanding, their path aligns with worldly affairs. *Zhi* means to proceed. Thus it is said: after hearing the Dao, those who act and cling proceed toward the human.

Those who act not and cling not proceed toward heaven. Heaven is natural truth. Hearing the Dao and awakening to it, ceasing study and abandoning inquiry, concealing all function—acting not, externally not clinging to forms, internally not attaching to emptiness—serene and pure, one accords with one’s original natural truth. Thus it is said: those who act not and cling not proceed toward heaven.

Acting inevitably leads to failure; clinging inevitably leads to loss. Those who act are bound to fail in the Dao; those who cling are bound to lose *de*. Thus it is said: acting inevitably leads to failure; clinging inevitably leads to loss.

Thus, hearing the Dao in the morning, one may die by evening. *Gu* is a connective phrase linking above and below. Hearing the Dao at dawn, one may die by dusk—completely letting go of the body, the heart dying and resting, preserving and maintaining this state. Thus it is said: hearing the Dao in the morning, one may die by evening.

This chapter clarifies that those who awaken to the Dao act not and cling not, resting and preserving.

**Chapter Thirteen**

Master Guan Yin said: When the one emotion is obscured, one becomes a sage. *Ming* means true emptiness, profound and unfathomable. *Yi qing* means emotion returning to true emptiness. Thus one is called a sage. Hence it is said: when the one emotion is obscured, one becomes a sage.

When the one emotion is good, one becomes a worthy person; when the one emotion is evil, one becomes a petty person. From the essence of true emptiness, a sudden emotion arises—if it does not incline toward goodness, it inclines toward evil. When emotion arises, how can one not be cautious? If it inclines toward goodness and accumulates goodness, the accumulation grows vast, forming the blessing of *de* and *xing*—thus one is called a worthy person. If it inclines toward evil and accumulates evil, the accumulation grows vast, forming the calamity of violence and cruelty—thus one is called a petty person. Hence it is said: when the one emotion is good, one becomes a worthy person; when the one emotion is evil, one becomes a petty person.

The obscured emotion is the self-existent nothingness—it cannot be shown.

The state of *one emotion obscured* is the self-existent nothingness—it is the return from traces to the origin. Returning from traces to the origin, one obscurely accords with the Dao of true emptiness, yet this cannot be shown to others. As the scripture says: "Even the sage cannot bring forth the Dao to show to others"—hence it is said: *the one emotion obscured* is the self-existent nothingness, which cannot be demonstrated.

The *one emotion* of goodness or evil arises from nothingness into being—it cannot be concealed. Nothingness is true emptiness; being is emotion. From the ground of true emptiness, a sudden emotion arises—inclining toward goodness and accumulating goodness, or inclining toward evil and accumulating evil—this is the descent from origin to trace. In this descent from origin to trace, the traces of goodness and evil cannot be concealed or hidden. Thus it is said: the *one emotion* of goodness or evil arises from nothingness into being and cannot be kept secret.

The *one emotion* of goodness or evil belongs to knowing; only sentient beings possess it. To say that the *one emotion* of goodness or evil pertains to knowledge is to equate it with the dull and moving creatures that possess perception. Hence it is said: the *one emotion* of goodness or evil belongs to knowing, and only sentient beings possess it.

The *one emotion obscured* belongs to unknowing; beneath the vast heavens, the Dao is present everywhere. When the *one emotion* merges with true emptiness, it is prior to the arising of knowledge. Before knowledge arises, the wondrous being of true emptiness fills the great void, present in all places without exception. Thus it is said: the *one emotion obscured* belongs to unknowing, and beneath the vast heavens, the Dao is present everywhere. This chapter clarifies that the Dao does not belong to emotion or perception—there is no place where the Dao is not.

**Chapter Fourteen**
Master Guan Yin said: Do not say that because the sage exerts unceasing effort, the Dao is achieved through diligence.
*"Do not"* is a prohibitive term. One must not claim that because the sage applies effort with vigor and practices without laziness, the sage’s study of the Dao succeeds through toil and hardship. This is not so—the Dao is realized through the awakening of the heart, inherently complete from the beginning. How could it depend on unceasing effort and hardship before being achieved? Hence it is said: *Do not say that because the sage exerts unceasing effort, the Dao is achieved through diligence.*

Do not say that because the sage firmly maintains without change, the Dao is obtained through grasping.
One must not claim that because the sage firmly preserves and does not alter, the sage obtains the Dao through holding fast. This is also not so—the sage’s heart opens in awakened understanding, taking the Dao as its essence. It is truly constant and unchanging, non-doing and non-grasping, without loss or gain. Hence it is said: *Do not say that because the sage firmly maintains without change, the Dao is obtained through grasping.*

The sage’s exertion of effort is like the loosing of an arrow—acting in response to others, not acting of oneself.
An arrow is a shaft. The sage responds to beings with compassion, universally benefiting without cease. People may call this "exerting effort," yet they do not realize that the sage’s exertion of compassion and universal benefit without cease is like a person shooting a bow to loose an arrow—moved to respond, acting only when unavoidable. Hence it is said: *The sage’s exertion of effort is like the loosing of an arrow—acting in response to others, not acting of oneself.* This speaks of action without self.

The sage’s firm maintenance is like the grasping of an arrow—maintaining in response to others, not maintaining of oneself.
To *grasp* is to hold. The sage abides in tranquil solitude, and people may call this "firm maintenance," yet they do not realize that the sage’s firm maintenance is like a person holding an arrow before shooting—remaining still because there is no response. How could there be a heart that maintains stillness? Hence it is said: *The sage’s firm maintenance is like the grasping of an arrow—maintaining in response to others, not maintaining of oneself.* This chapter clarifies that the sage’s movement and stillness are without self.

**Chapter Fifteen**
Master Guan Yin said: If one seeks the Dao through words, actions, learning, and knowledge, revolving endlessly, there will be no time of attainment.
The Dao originally has no name and cannot be sought through words. The Dao originally has no trace and cannot be sought through actions. The Dao originally has no method and cannot be sought through learning. The Dao originally has no emotion and cannot be sought through knowledge. If one seeks it through names, traces, methods, and emotions, it is like stones grinding against one another in endless revolution—never departing from names, traces, methods, and emotions. When will one awaken to the Dao? Hence it is said: *If one seeks the Dao through words, actions, learning, and knowledge, revolving endlessly, there will be no time of attainment.*

Knowing words is like the murmuring of a spring; knowing actions is like the flight of birds; knowing learning is like grasping at shadows; knowing knowledge is like interpreting dreams. When not a single breath remains, the Dao will come to accord.
Knowing words is like the murmuring of a spring—its sounds cannot be distinguished. When sounds cannot be distinguished, one forgets names.
Knowing actions is like the flight of birds—its traces cannot be followed. When traces cannot be followed, one forgets traces.
Knowing learning is like grasping at shadows—its falsity cannot be seized. When it cannot be seized, one forgets methods.
Knowing knowledge is like interpreting dreams—its delusions cannot be trusted. When delusions cannot be trusted, one forgets emotions.
A *breath* is one inhalation and one exhalation. In the space of a single breath, names, traces, methods, and emotions are suddenly forgotten and no longer exist—then one accords with the wondrous Dao. Hence it is said: *Knowing words is like the murmuring of a spring; knowing actions is like the flight of birds; knowing learning is like grasping at shadows; knowing knowledge is like interpreting dreams. When not a single breath remains, the Dao will come to accord.* To *grasp* is to seize with the hand. This chapter clarifies that the Dao does not belong to names, traces, methods, or emotions and cannot be sought through words, actions, learning, or knowledge.

**Chapter Sixteen**
Master Guan Yin said: To establish things through affairs is difficult; to abandon things through the Dao is easy.
*Through affairs* means all applications. *To establish* means to establish wondrous function. *Things* refers to beings. To establish wondrous function and universally benefit the world, enabling each person to realize the Dao, is truly not easy. Hence it is said: *To establish things through affairs is difficult.*
Sweeping away and returning to the origin, not a single thing remains—only the wondrous body of true emptiness is revealed. What difficulty could there be? Hence it is said: *To abandon things through the Dao is easy.*

**Chapter Seventeen**
In all under heaven, nothing is difficult to accomplish yet easy to destroy. The myriad things of the world, countless and boundless, all require perfect completion—truly no easy task. Hence it is said: *In all under heaven, nothing is difficult to accomplish.*
This explains *to establish things through affairs is difficult.* Consider Qin’s Epang Palace, which took more than a year to build, yet a single fire of Chu reduced it to ashes. Is this not *easy to destroy?* Hence it is said: *easy to destroy.* This explains *to abandon things through the Dao is easy.*
This chapter clarifies that establishing is not easy, while returning to the origin is not difficult.

**Chapter Eighteen**
Master Guan Yin said: A single spark of fire can burn ten thousand things—yet when the things are gone, where does the fire remain?
Fire is a thing without self. Whether struck from stone or kindled from wood, a single spark may be fanned into flame, and when great, it becomes a raging inferno capable of consuming all things. Yet when all things are burned away, the fire too ceases to exist, for fire has no self. Hence it is said: *A single spark of fire can burn ten thousand things—yet when the things are gone, where does the fire remain?*
This is the analogy.
A single breath of the Dao can obscure ten thousand things—yet when the things are gone, where does the Dao abide?
In the space of a single breath, the Dao of true emptiness pervades all, profound and obscure, with not a single thing remaining. Thus, one forgets all things externally, and in forgetting all things externally, one forgets internally as well. "True emptiness" is but a provisional name for the Dao. Hence it is said: *A single breath of the Dao can obscure ten thousand things—yet when the things are gone, where does the Dao abide?*
This is the application of the analogy.
This chapter clarifies that one who awakens to the Dao also transcends the provisional name of "Dao."

**Chapter Nineteen**
Master Guan Yin said: Among those born into the world, some die after a single day, some after ten years, some after a hundred years.
The lifespans of humans vary—some die in infancy, some in childhood, some live a full hundred years. Hence it is said: *Among those born into the world, some die after a single day, some after ten years, some after a hundred years.* This is the analogy.
Those who die after a single day are like those who attain the Dao in a single breath. Those who die after ten or a hundred years are like those who attain the Dao after a long time.
Those of sharp faculties, upon encountering a teacher’s guidance, awaken instantly. In the space of a single breath, their minds die, all doubt vanishes—like one who dies after a single day. Hence it is said: *Those who die after a single day are like those who attain the Dao in a single breath.*
Those of middling or lesser faculties, upon encountering a teacher’s guidance, struggle to awaken at once. Like water soaking into an object, they gradually penetrate, whether after ten or twenty years. With unwavering resolve, at some point they suddenly break through, their minds illuminated—like one who lives ten or a hundred years before dying. Hence it is said: *Those who die after ten or a hundred years are like those who attain the Dao after a long time.*
This is the application of the analogy.
Those who have not yet died, though they act with clarity and wisdom, are merely called "alive," not "dead."
"Those" refers to the three types mentioned above—those who die after a day, ten years, or a hundred years. Before their death, though they move and act with brightness and wisdom, they are merely called "alive," not "dead." Hence it is said: *Those who have not yet died, though they act with clarity and wisdom, are merely called "alive," not "dead."*
Those who have not yet realized the Dao, though they act with clarity and wisdom, are merely called "engaged in affairs," not "abiding in the Dao."
"Those" refers to the three types of sudden and gradual awakening mentioned above. Before realizing and embodying the Dao, though they move and act with brightness and wisdom, they are merely called "engaged in human affairs," not "abiding in the wondrous Dao." Hence it is said: *Those who have not yet realized the Dao, though they act with clarity and wisdom, are merely called "engaged in affairs," not "abiding in the Dao."*
This is the application of the analogy.
This chapter clarifies that awakening may be sudden or gradual, yet the Dao is not two.

**Chapter Twenty**
Master Guan Yin said: Not knowing that my Dao is without words or actions, yet seeking the Dao through words and actions, one may suddenly encounter strange phenomena and stubbornly cling to them as the Dao.
The deluded do not awaken to the fact that the Dao is originally without names or traces. Hence it is said: *Not knowing that my Dao is without words or actions.* The deluded, attached to the sacred words and dharmic forms of the ancients, seek the Dao through them. Or, with a mind that reveres the strange and wondrous, they may suddenly encounter demonic forces manifesting as extraordinary beings—expounding on heaven and earth, discussing affairs and principles, or displaying supernatural transformations. The deluded stubbornly cling to them as enlightened sages of the Dao, desiring to take them as teachers and seek the Dao. Hence it is said: *yet seeking the Dao through words and actions, one may suddenly encounter strange phenomena and stubbornly cling to them as the Dao.*
Little do they know that abandoning the source to seek the stream will never return them to the source; abandoning the root to seek the branches will never return them to the root.
The Dao is realized through the awakening of the mind. The numinous source is wondrously serene, its essence and function ever thus. The deluded, not awakening to this, abandon the source and seek the Dao externally through names and traces—this is to forsake the numinous source and chase after the flowing traces. The root is the source; the branches are the stream. Wandering in pursuit of branches, one can never return to the root. Hence it is said: *Little do they know that abandoning the source to seek the stream will never return them to the source; abandoning the root to seek the branches will never return them to the root.*
This chapter admonishes students of the Dao not to seek it through names and traces.

Guanyinzi said: In learning archery, charioteering, the zither, or chess, there is not one skill that can be mastered in a single breath. Learning archery means training with the bow and arrow; learning charioteering means training to drive a carriage; learning the zither means practicing its playing; learning chess means practicing the game of *qin*. These four pursuits all require years of practice, yet not one can be perfected in the span of a single breath. Thus it is said: *In learning archery, charioteering, the zither, or chess, there is not one skill that can be mastered in a single breath.*

Only the Dao, being formless and without direction, can be attained in a single breath. The Dao is true emptiness—without form or image, without orientation or position. Those of keen capacity may directly awaken to true emptiness in an instant, gaining penetrating clarity in the space of a single breath. Thus it is said: *Only the Dao, being formless and without direction, can be attained in a single breath.*

This chapter clarifies that the Dao is easier to learn than worldly skills.

Guan Yinzi said: When two archers meet, skill and clumsiness become apparent; when two chess players meet, victory and defeat become apparent. When archers meet but do not shoot, the one who hits the mark is seen as skillful, while the one who misses is seen as clumsy—thus it is said: *When two archers meet, skill and clumsiness become apparent.* When two players of *yi* meet to compete, the winner is seen as victorious, while the loser is seen as defeated—thus it is said: *When two chess players meet, victory and defeat become apparent.* When two practitioners of the Dao meet, there is nothing to display. Having nothing to display means there is no skill or clumsiness, no victory or defeat. When two people who have thoroughly penetrated the wondrous Dao meet, there is nothing to present or show—nothing to present or show means it is not like archery or chess, where skill and clumsiness, victory and defeat exist. Thus it is said: *When two practitioners of the Dao meet, there is nothing to display; having nothing to display means there is no skill or clumsiness, no victory or defeat.* This chapter clarifies that the Dao has no skill or clumsiness, no victory or defeat, and nothing to present or show to others.

Guan Yinzi said: My Dao is like the sea. Cast a hundred million pieces of gold into it, and it is not seen; cast a hundred million stones into it, and it is not seen; cast a hundred million impurities into it, and it is not seen. The sea is a metaphor for true emptiness. Gold is a metaphor for subtle words and wondrous conduct—true emptiness can obscure all wondrous conduct, so that when observed, it is not seen. Thus it is said: *My Dao is like the sea; cast a hundred million pieces of gold into it, and it is not seen.* Stones are a metaphor for all good deeds—true emptiness can obscure all goodness, so that when displayed, it is not seen. Thus it is said: *Cast a hundred million stones into it, and it is not seen.* Impurities are a metaphor for all evil—true emptiness can obscure all evil, so that when viewed, it is not seen. Thus it is said: *Cast a hundred million impurities into it, and it is not seen.* It can carry small minnows and small fish, and it can carry great leviathans and great whales. Small minnows and small fish are metaphors for petty people and ordinary beings; great leviathans and great whales are metaphors for noble persons and the worthy. True emptiness can carry petty people and ordinary beings, noble persons and the worthy—universally benefiting all equally, from birth to death, sustaining them without their awareness. Thus it is said: *It can carry small minnows and small fish, and it can carry great leviathans and great whales.* It gathers all waters and receives them without excess; it disperses all waters and divides them without insufficiency. True emptiness is not filled when augmented, so it obscures heaven and earth and the ten thousand things without being in excess. True emptiness is not diminished when reduced, so it gives rise to heaven and earth and the ten thousand things without being insufficient. Thus it is said: *It gathers all waters and receives them without excess; it disperses all waters and divides them without insufficiency.* This chapter clarifies that the Dao has no lack and no surplus, yet nothing is beyond its capacity.

---

Guan Yinzi said: My Dao is like dwelling in darkness. One who dwells in brightness cannot see a single thing in the dark, yet one who dwells in darkness can see all affairs in the light. The Dao is true emptiness—profound and obscure, beyond the reach of yin and yang, difficult for ghosts and spirits to fathom. Thus it is said: *My Dao is like dwelling in darkness; one who dwells in brightness cannot see a single thing in the dark.* Though true emptiness is profound and obscure, beyond the reach of yin and yang, and difficult for ghosts and spirits to fathom, its functioning is like pouring sweet wine into a vessel; its response to things is like a hanging mirror reflecting forms. It is also like an echo in an empty valley—still and unmoving, yet when stimulated, it instantly connects, and nothing can escape its measure. Thus it is said: *Yet one who dwells in darkness can see all affairs in the light.* This chapter clarifies that the Dao is profound and unfathomable, responding to change without end.

---

Guan Yinzi said: The power of petty people inclines toward evil. *Power* means application—the foolish and deluded among petty people apply themselves entirely to evil. What is evil? Killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, false speech, frivolous talk, divisive speech, greed, hatred, delusion, great rebellion, disobedience to parents, disloyalty, lack of benevolence, lack of righteousness—these are what is meant by *the power of petty people inclines toward evil.* The power of noble persons inclines toward goodness. Noble persons, enlightened to principle, apply themselves entirely to goodness. What is goodness? Not killing, not stealing, not engaging in sexual misconduct, not lying, not speaking with flattery or false charm, reverently practicing the Five Constants and the hundred virtues—this is what is meant by *the power of noble persons inclines toward goodness.* The power of sages inclines toward nothing to attain. Only with nothing to attain can one be in accord with the Dao. The application of sages is universally and equally beneficial, seeking no reward, embodying virtue without claiming virtue, responding to change without fixed method, transcending all extremes, surpassing all dharmic appearances, attaining nothing whatsoever—this is forcibly named the Dao of true emptiness. Thus it is said: *The power of sages inclines toward nothing to attain; only with nothing to attain can one be in accord with the Dao.* This chapter clarifies that the Dao does not belong to goodness or evil, transcending all existence.

---

Guan Yinzi said: My Dao is like a sword. When its edge cuts things, it is sharp; when grasped by the hand, it injures. The sword is a metaphor for the Dao—the Dao obscures the ten thousand things, universally benefiting without end. Thus it is said: *My Dao is like a sword; when it cuts things, it is sharp.* Clinging and attachment obscure one’s nature and delude one about the Dao. Thus it is said: *When grasped by the hand, it injures.* This chapter clarifies that the Dao universally benefits without end, while those who are deluded and attached bring harm upon themselves.

---

Guan Yinzi said: A *lian* does not ask a *dou*, and a *dou* does not answer a *lian*; a tile does not ask a stone, and a stone does not answer a tile—yet the Dao is not lost. A *lian* is made of bamboo to hold dates and chestnuts; a *dou* is made of wood to hold offerings for sacrificial rites. The Dao is present in all things. Though the *lian*, *dou*, tile, and stone do not question or answer one another, they engage in questioning and answering all day long—yet though they question and answer, they have never truly questioned or answered.

Guan Yinzi said: Thus it is said—a *lian* does not ask a *dou*, and a *dou* does not answer a *lian*; a tile does not ask a stone, and a stone does not answer a tile—yet the Dao is not lost. This is the preaching of the insentient; the deluded do not understand. Thus it is said: though they do not respond, they conceal true response; where there is no knowing, knowing abides—this is true knowing. Question and answer arise from the single qi’s coming and going—where then is the Dao?

The Dao is fundamentally without question, without answer. Before question and answer arise, before I even conceive of questioning or answering, the heart does not stir. When the heart does not stir, the single qi neither comes nor goes. When the single qi neither comes nor goes, the heart knows no arising or ceasing. Without arising or ceasing, one merges with the wondrous Dao. Once the heart of questioning and answering stirs, wherever the heart goes, qi follows. Thus with each question and each answer, qi comes and goes. With qi’s coming and going, one drifts far from the Dao. Hence it is said: *At the subtlest point, the moment one conceives or deliberates, one falls.* Thus it is said: question and answer arise from the single qi’s coming and going—where then is the Dao?

This chapter clarifies that the Dao is universally present, yet question and answer are distinct and separate.

---

Guan Yinzi said: Those who look up to the Dao are lame; those who follow the Dao are errant. All know the affairs of the Dao, yet none know the Dao itself.

*Ba* means to aspire with longing; *bo* means to pursue with haste. *Ru* means to go forth. Those who look up in admiration of the sages’ Dao, aspiring yet never attaining—these are called *ba*, those who look up to the Dao. Those who go forth in hasty pursuit of the wondrous Dao yet never grasp it—these are called *bo*, those who follow the Dao. *Shi* means function. The above—longing aspiration and hasty pursuit—are but the functions of the Dao. Following function, one loses sight of its essence. Thus it is said: all know the affairs of the Dao, yet none know the Dao itself.

Thus it is said: the source of the Dao is not distant; the sea of nature is not remote. Seek only within yourself—do not search elsewhere. Even if you search, you will not find; even if you find, it will not be true. This is the truth of the matter.

Therefore, the sage neither longs for the Dao in want nor relies on the Dao in abundance. He does not borrow the Dao from the sage nor sell the Dao to the foolish.

*Qian* means deficiency; *feng* means surplus. *Jie* means to borrow; *gu* means to sell. *Shiyi* serves to connect the above and below. The wondrous Dao of true emptiness is inherently complete, neither deficient nor surplus. The sage, seeing clearly and penetratingly, knows the Dao is originally complete. Thus he does not long for the Dao in want, for true emptiness holds nothing. Nor does he rely on the Dao in abundance. Since the Dao is possessed by all, he does not borrow it from the sage—the sage cannot extract the Dao to show others. Nor does he sell the Dao to the foolish.

This chapter clarifies that the Dao is possessed by all, and one must not borrow or take it from another.

**#1** *"All people may attain life and penetrate the Mystery"* aligns with the *Collected Works of the Congshu Jichu Initial Compilation* version of the *Guan Yinzi*, while the *Wushang Miaodao Wenshi Zhenjing* in the *Daoist Canon* (Mu character section) reads *"All people may attain life and create the Mystery."*

**#2#3** *"Grasping the loss"* is an error; both the *Guan Yinzi* and the *Wushang Miaodao Wenshi Zhenjing* read *"grasping the arrow."*

**#4** This phrase appears in the *Guan Yinzi* and the *Wushang Miaodao Wenshi Zhenjing* as *"the things of the world."*

**#5** This phrase in the *Guan Yinzi* reads: *"yet those who seek the Dao through words and actions."*

**Commentary on the Wenshi Zhenjing, Scroll Two**
*Divine Peak’s Carefree Master Niu Daochun’s Direct Explication*
**The Two Pillars Chapter**
A pillar is that which establishes the wondrous workings of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang. This section comprises twelve chapters in all.

The *Guan Yinzi* states: Whether bowl or basin, whether cracked vessel or pot, whether jar or urn—all may establish Heaven and Earth.

The six items—bowl, basin, *ping* vessel, pot, jar, and urn—are all vessels in use. As objects, vessels are solid without and hollow within. The solid pertains to yin; the hollow pertains to yang. Yang belongs to Heaven; yin belongs to Earth. Thus, in establishing their wondrous workings, every thing may serve as a model.

Hence it is said: Whether bowl or basin, whether *ping* vessel or pot, whether jar or urn—all may establish Heaven and Earth.

Omen-tortoises, divining stalks, broken tiles, and veined stones—all may foretell good or ill fortune.

*Omens* are the precursors of good or ill fortune. By scorching a tortoise shell with fire and drilling its cracks, one examines the fissures to discern the omen of good or ill. *Divining stalks* are stalks of milfoil, a plant of the mugwort family from Caizhou. One bundle contains fifty stalks. Following the *Great Expansion* number, forty-nine are used, with one representing the Great Unity. These are evenly divided into two to symbolize the Two Modes. One is set aside to symbolize the intercalary month. They are arranged in fours to symbolize the four seasons. Three arrangements form one line, and eighteen changes form one hexagram. Once the hexagram is determined, the omen of good or ill fortune is revealed.

*Broken tiles* refer to tile divination: when a tile is struck and shatters unevenly, the odd fragments pertain to yang and foretell good fortune; even fragments pertain to yin and foretell ill fortune.

*Veined stones* are stones whose fissures are examined to discern good or ill fortune. If the veins are straight and the count odd, they pertain to yang and foretell **#1** fortune. If the veins are slanted and the count even, they pertain to yin and foretell ill fortune. Thus it is said: Omen-tortoises, divining stalks, broken tiles, and veined stones—all may foretell good or ill fortune.

From this, we know that the principle of Heaven and Earth **#2** is contained within a single thing, and every thing contains it, each without reliance on another.

*From this, we know*: Based on the above—that bowls, basins, *ping* vessels, pots, jars, and urns may all establish Heaven and Earth, and that omen-tortoises, divining stalks, broken tiles, and veined stones may all foretell good or **#3** fortune—we thus know that the principle of Heaven and Earth is contained within a single thing. *Principle* is the Dao.

The Dao is inherently complete and requires no cultivation. The Dao is omnipresent—Heaven and Earth, the myriad things, persist when aligned with the Dao and perish when they lose it. Thus it is said: To perceive the inherent Dao is to recognize that every thing contains the wondrous Dao. It is not that things contain it, but that Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things never depart from the wondrous Dao. Hence it is said: We know that the principle of Heaven and Earth is contained within a single thing, and every thing contains it, each without reliance on another. "Without reliance" means each thing is self-sufficient and needs not borrow from another.

When my essence converges with its essence, the two essences interact and the spirit responds. "It" refers to tortoises, stalks, tiles, and stones; "I" refers to the diviner. Though the tortoise be withered, the stalks dried, the tiles scorched, or the stones hardened, how could they possess inherent spiritual omens of fortune or misfortune? It is because my sincerity merges with the tortoise, stalks, tiles, and stones—the essence of the principle of Heaven and Earth—so that the two essences stir and interact, eliciting this spiritual response. Thus it is said: When my essence converges with its essence, the two essences interact and the spirit responds.

One female and one male hatch from eggs; one yin and one yang gestate in the womb. Among flying creatures, pairs are called female and male, and those with eight orifices hatch from eggs. Among walking beasts, pairs are called yin and yang, and those with nine orifices gestate in the womb. Thus it is said: One female and one male hatch from eggs; one yin and one yang gestate in the womb.

Form is its essence; principle is its spirit. "It" refers to female and male, yin and yang. When female and male, yin and yang unite, their essences and spirits merge as one to form eggs or embryos. The form of eggs and embryos is the essence of female and male, yin and yang. "Principle" is consciousness—this is their spirit. Thus it is said: Form is its essence; principle is its spirit.

Love is my essence; observation is my spirit. Love is water; observation is fire. When love clings and observation follows, they transform into wood. When observation abides and love gathers, they coalesce into metal. "I" refers to every person’s self. When a person conceives a thought of love, it pertains to the essence of their nature; when their gaze rests upon form, it pertains to their spirit. Essence belongs to water, hence love is water; spirit belongs to fire, hence observation is fire. Love as water and observation as fire cling and unite, thereby transforming into wood. When wood is pressed, water emerges to reveal the mother’s form; when drilled, fire appears to reveal the child’s form. Observation as spirit and love as essence abide and unite, thereby coalescing into metal. When metal is struck, fire appears to reveal the husband’s form; when smelted, water emerges to reveal the child’s form. Thus it is said: Love is my essence; observation is my spirit. Love is water; observation is fire. When love clings and observation follows, they transform into wood; when observation abides and love gathers, they coalesce into metal.

First conceive the primordial qi within a single thing, then cling to love to unite with its form and obscurely observe to unite with its principle—thus the image takes shape. "It" refers to the mother. The father’s nature is true emptiness, originally pure and still. When desire arises in the pure and still true emptiness, it is like the Dao generating the One qi. Thus it is said: First conceive the primordial qi. Once desire arises, the mother’s form is already present in consciousness. Thus it is said: It is contained within a single thing. The mother’s form exists in consciousness, and through clinging love, one unites with her essence and blood. Thus it is said: Cling to love to unite with its form. As the essences of father and mother merge in the indistinct and obscure, observation of form gives rise to love, completing their union. The father’s consciousness unites with the mother’s consciousness, forming the image of the embryo. The human form already exists within the womb. Thus it is said: Obscurely observe to unite with its principle—thus the image takes shape. "Principle" is consciousness. The above describes how the union of beasts and humans, their essences and spirits, elicits a response akin to the spiritual resonance between a diviner’s sincerity and tortoises, stalks, tiles, and stones.

The image of the One’s movement pervades the Great Void. From the center it ascends to become Heaven; from the center it descends to become Earth. The Dao generates the One—the Dao is the Limitless, and the One is the Supreme Ultimate. From the Limitless emerges the Supreme Ultimate, and within the Supreme Ultimate, the images of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things are already contained. Though the Supreme Ultimate encompasses all images, it has not yet departed from the Limitless. Thus it is said: The image of the One’s movement pervades the Great Void. The Great Void is the Limitless. When the Supreme Ultimate moves, movement generates yang. The yang qi, light and pure, rises from the center of the Supreme Ultimate and coalesces to form Heaven. Thus it is said: From the center it ascends to become Heaven. When movement reaches its limit, it becomes still, and stillness generates yin. The yin qi, heavy and turbid, descends from the center of the Supreme Ultimate and congeals to form Earth. Thus it is said: From the center it descends to become Earth.

Nothing ascends without descending; nothing descends without ascending. At the winter solstice, yang is born, and over thirty-six pentads, the qi ascends for one hundred eighty days. When the yang qi reaches Heaven, yang at its extreme generates yin. At the summer solstice, yin is born, and over thirty-six pentads, the qi descends for one hundred eighty days. When the yin qi reaches Earth, yin at its extreme again generates yang. That which belongs to yang naturally ascends; that which belongs to yin naturally descends. Ascending and descending, coming and going, they circulate endlessly, thus generating and transforming without cease. Where there is ascent, there is descent; without ascent, there would be no descent. Without ascent or descent, there would be no life or death. Thus it is said: Nothing ascends without descending; nothing descends without ascending.

That which ascends is fire; that which descends is water. Fire belongs to yang and naturally ascends—fire flares upward, embodying the image of ascent. Water belongs to yin and naturally descends—water flows downward, embodying the image of descent.

Thus it is said: that which ascends is fire; that which descends is water. That which desires to ascend yet cannot ascend is wood; that which desires to descend yet cannot descend is metal.

Water generates wood, and wood generates fire. Fire is the child of wood; water is the mother of wood. The affection between child and mother resides entirely within wood. Fire desires to ascend, water desires to descend, yet wood’s qi desires to ascend but cannot—thus it is said: that which desires to ascend yet cannot ascend is wood. Water is the child of metal; fire is the husband of metal. The affection between husband and child resides entirely within metal. Water desires to descend, fire desires to ascend, yet metal’s qi desires to descend but cannot—thus it is said: that which desires to descend yet cannot descend is metal.

As for wood: when drilled, it yields fire; when wrung, it yields water. As for metal: when struck, it yields fire; when smelted, it yields water. Metal and wood are the intercourse of water and fire. Drilling wood to obtain fire reveals the child’s affection; wringing wood to obtain water reveals the mother’s affection—this explains why that which desires to ascend yet cannot ascend is wood, hence it is said: as for wood, when drilled, it yields fire; when wrung, it yields water. Striking metal to obtain fire reveals the husband’s affection; smelting metal to obtain water reveals the child’s affection—this explains why that which desires to descend yet cannot descend is metal, hence it is said: as for metal, when struck, it yields water.

As stated above, we know that metal and wood each contain the affections of water and fire, their intercourse giving rise to the transformation of metal and wood—thus it is said: metal and wood are the intercourse of water and fire.

Water is essence and Heaven; fire is spirit and Earth. Water is yang within yin—like the *kan* trigram, which belongs to yin, yet its central line belongs to yang. Yang naturally ascends, embodying the image of Heaven. In the Five Phases, water is water; in qi, it is Heaven; in humans, it is essence; in direction, it is north; in season, it is winter; in numbers, it is one and six; in trigrams, it is *kan*; in the Five Constants, it is wisdom; in stars, it is the Pole Star; in mountains, it is Mount Heng; in the viscera, it is the kidneys; in earthly branches, it is *hai* and *zi*; in heavenly stems, it is *ren* and *gui*—thus it is said: water is essence and Heaven.

Fire is yin within yang—like the *li* trigram, which belongs to yang, yet its central line belongs to yin. Yin naturally descends, embodying the image of Earth. In the Five Phases, fire is fire; in qi, it is Earth; in humans, it is spirit; in direction, it is south; in season, it is summer; in numbers, it is two and seven; in trigrams, it is *li*; in the Five Constants, it is propriety; in stars, it is Mars; in mountains, it is Mount Heng; in the viscera, it is the heart; in earthly branches, it is *si* and *wu*; in heavenly stems, it is *bing* and *ding*—thus it is said: fire is spirit and Earth.

Wood is the soul and humanity; metal is the corporeal soul and things. In the Five Phases, wood is wood; in qi, it is humanity; in spirit, it is the soul; in direction, it is east; in season, it is spring; in numbers, it is three and eight; in trigrams, it is *zhen*; in the Five Constants, it is benevolence; in stars, it is Jupiter; in mountains, it is Mount Tai; in the viscera, it is the liver; in earthly branches, it is *yin* and *mao*; in heavenly stems, it is *jia* and *yi*—thus it is said: wood is the soul and humanity.

In the Five Phases, metal is metal; in qi, it is things; in spirit, it is the corporeal soul; in direction, it is west; in season, it is autumn; in numbers, it is four and nine; in trigrams, it is *dui*; in the Five Constants, it is righteousness; in stars, it is Venus; in mountains, it is Mount Hua; in the viscera, it is the lungs; in earthly branches, it is *shen* and *you*; in heavenly stems, it is *geng* and *xin*—thus it is said: metal is the corporeal soul and things.

That which moves without cease is time; that which encompasses and contains is direction. The Five Phases revolve endlessly, forming the four seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter—thus it is said: that which moves without cease is time. Heaven and Earth encompass the myriad things, forming the ten directions of the eight extremes—thus it is said: that which encompasses and contains is direction.

Only Earth begins and ends all things. There are those who resolve it, and those who reveal it. Earth has no fixed phase but flourishes in the four seasons. Throughout the year, from beginning to end, all generation and completion are imbued with Earth’s qi. Spring and summer are for generation, the beginning of growth; autumn and winter are for completion, the fulfillment of things—thus it is said: only Earth begins and ends all things.

To resolve is to disperse and conceal: in the first and second months, wood reigns and Earth is hidden; in the third month, wood flourishes for twelve days, while Earth flourishes for eighteen days—flourishing is manifesting. In the fourth and fifth months, fire reigns and Earth is hidden; in the sixth month, fire flourishes for twelve days, while Earth flourishes for eighteen days. In the seventh and eighth months, metal reigns and Earth is hidden; in the ninth month, metal flourishes for twelve days, while Earth flourishes for eighteen days. In the tenth and eleventh months, water reigns and Earth is hidden; in the twelfth month, water flourishes for twelve days, while Earth flourishes for eighteen days.

In the Five Phases, Earth is Earth; in direction, it is center; in season, it is the four seasons; in numbers, it is five and ten; in trigrams, it is *kun* and *gen*; in the Five Constants, it is trustworthiness; in stars, it is Saturn; in mountains, it is Mount Song; in earthly branches, it is *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*; in heavenly stems, it is *wu* and *ji*; in the viscera, it is the spleen; in spirit, it is intention.

When subtle words are heard, the wondrous intention is resolved and awakened, yielding the marvel of self-benefit—thus it is said: there are those who resolve it. Having awakened to the wondrous intention and attained self-benefit, one may also benefit others. For those of superior capacity, a gesture or secret indication suffices for sudden enlightenment, where even the wondrous intention transcends the measure of wondrous intention—thus it is said: there are those who reveal it.

This chapter elucidates the wondrous functioning of the establishment of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things. End of Chapter One.

Master Guan Yinzi said: The people of the world cannot be counted by the hundreds of millions. All who dwell in the world belong to boundless kinds—beyond reckoning by the measure of ten myriad as one *yi* or ten *yi* as one *zhao*. Thus it is said: the people of the world cannot be counted by the hundreds of millions.

Each person’s dreams differ; each night’s dreams differ. There is heaven, there is earth, there are people, there are things—all formed by thought. They cannot be counted by grains of dust. When all the world dreams in the same night, each dream realm is different—thus it is said: each person’s dreams differ. Each night’s dream realms differ—thus it is said: each night’s dreams differ. When the people of the world dream each night, they generally see heaven and earth, people and things—thus it is said: there is heaven, there is earth, there are people, there are things. What is seen in dreams—heaven and earth, people and things—is but the deluded perceptions and attachments of ordinary days. When dreaming, the spirit is confused and the *shi*-soul seizes control; what one has been attached to in waking life appears as visions in dreams—thus it is said: all are formed by thought. The dreams of all the world, though differing in the same night, cannot be numbered, let alone the endless variations night after night—thus they cannot be counted by grains of dust. (Dust is like sunlight glinting on motes.) How can we be certain that the present heaven and earth are not likewise the product of thought? *An* means “how can we know?” How can we know that in this waking state, where we see heaven and earth, people and things, there is no thinker? This is to say: the unenlightened, bound by their perceptions and attachments, see heaven and earth, people and things no differently than in dreams—deluded alike by day and night. Thus it is said: how can we know that the present heaven and earth are not the product of thought?

This chapter clarifies that the perceptions of the deluded—whether in waking or dreaming—take heaven and earth, people and things to be real, when in truth they are but the creations of deluded thought.

End of Chapter Two.

Master Guan Yinzi said: The heart corresponds to the jujube, the liver to the elm; I commune with heaven and earth. Heaven and earth generate the myriad things, each belonging to the Five Phases. The jujube is red and belongs to fire; fire corresponds to the heart—thus it is said: the heart corresponds to the jujube. The elm is green and belongs to wood; wood corresponds to the liver—thus it is said: the liver corresponds to the elm. Heaven and earth’s yin and yang *qi* intermingle to produce jujubes and elms; the heart corresponds to the jujube, the liver to the elm—this is how I commune with heaven and earth. Thus it is said: I commune with heaven and earth.

When rain is coming, one dreams of water; when clear skies are coming, one dreams of fire—heaven and earth commune with me. When the *qi* of heaven descends and the *qi* of earth ascends, clouds gather to bring rain. The yin *qi* affects a person, and at night one dreams of water—thus it is said: when rain is coming, one dreams of water. When the descending *qi* of heaven is restrained and the ascending *qi* of earth is withdrawn, the yang *qi* affects a person, and at night one dreams of fire—thus it is said: when clear skies are coming, one dreams of fire. As stated above, the yin and yang *qi* of heaven and earth affect a person, first manifesting in dreams of water or fire—this is how heaven and earth commune with me. Thus it is said: heaven and earth commune with me.

I and heaven and earth seem joined, seem separate, each returning to purity. As stated above, I commune with heaven and earth, and heaven and earth commune with me—thus I and heaven and earth seem joined, yet not joined. Heaven and earth contain humanity, and humanity contains heaven and earth; heaven and earth are the great person, and the person is the small heaven and earth—seeming distant, yet not distant. Thus it is said: I and heaven and earth seem joined, seem separate. Heaven and earth and I arise together. Heaven and earth have the Dao, and humanity has the Dao. The Dao is pure and without admixture, originally complete and true. The Dao is the归宿 of heaven, earth, and humanity—thus it is said: each returning to purity.

This chapter clarifies the Dao by which heaven, earth, and the myriad things are born.

End of Chapter Three.

Master Guan Yinzi said: Though heaven and earth are vast, they have color and form, number and direction. Heaven is dark and earth is yellow—thus they have color. Heaven is round and earth is square—thus they have form. Heaven and earth, having color and form, will eventually return to dust—thus they have number. Heaven and earth have the eight directions and above and below—thus they have direction. Though heaven and earth are vast, they have observable colors and forms, and their number and direction can be exhausted. Thus it is said: though heaven and earth are vast, they have color and form, number and direction.

Yet I possess that which is neither color nor form, neither number nor direction, yet gives rise to heaven and earth. I possess the Dao of true emptiness: it cannot be seen—thus it is not color; it cannot be grasped—thus it is not form. True emptiness is inexhaustible—thus it is not number; true emptiness is without location—thus it is not direction. The Dao of true emptiness generates heaven and earth. Heaven and earth have their number and will return to dust, yet dust gives rise to them again, and they to dust once more—endlessly arising and returning, arising and returning. Yet the Dao neither arises nor returns; it abides through endless kalpas. Thus it is said: I possess that which is neither color nor form, neither number nor direction, yet gives rise to heaven and earth.

This chapter clarifies that heaven and earth arise and return, while the Dao neither arises nor returns.

End of Chapter Four.

Master Guan Yinzi said: Those who die in the womb, those who die in the egg—whether human or thing—though heaven and earth are vast, they know nothing of them. *Bi* refers to those who die in the womb and those things that die in the egg. The natures of humans and things enter the womb and egg, but perish before birth. Though heaven and earth are vast, the natures of these humans and things know nothing of them. Thus it is said: those who die in the womb, those who die in the egg—whether human or thing—though heaven and earth are vast, they know nothing of them.

Those who conceive of heaven and earth do so through their limited perceptions. Though the human nature resides in the womb, it knows nothing of heaven and earth. Only after birth, in childhood, does one begin to know that what is above is called heaven and what is below is called earth. From childhood to old age, this knowledge is never forgotten. Thus, those who measure and conceive of heaven and earth do so through their limited perceptions. Thus it is said: those who conceive of heaven and earth do so through their limited perceptions.

End of Chapter Five.

Just as the hand does not touch the blade, the blade does not wound the person. The hand is likened to perception; the blade, to heaven and earth. Just as the hand does not grasp the sword’s edge, the sword’s edge does not wound the hand—so too does perception remain unstained by heaven and earth, and heaven and earth do not obscure the nature of perception. When perception is forgotten, one knows nothing of heaven and earth. Thus it is said: just as the hand does not touch the blade, the blade does not wound the person. This chapter clarifies how deluded perception obstructs the Dao.

End of Chapter Five.

Master Guan Yin said: In dreams, in mirrors, in water—heaven and earth exist therein. When one sleeps and dreams, one dimly perceives heaven, earth, and people. When a mirror reflects above and below, it captures heaven, earth, and people. Gazing into a clear pool, one sees heaven above and earth below; even the mountains and plains beside it become heaven and earth within the water. Thus it is said: in dreams, in mirrors, in water—heaven and earth exist therein.

To dispel the heaven and earth of dreams, one must not sleep. To dispel the heaven and earth of mirrors, one must not look. To dispel the heaven and earth of water, one must not draw from the vessel. The deluded do not awaken: true emptiness is unimpeded by heaven and earth, and heaven and earth are likewise unimpeded by true emptiness. Yet deluded perception, clinging to false habits, seeks to remove the heaven and earth of dreams, unaware that dreams themselves are illusory—how can they be dispelled? If one attempts to dispel them, one cannot rest peacefully. Thus it is said: to dispel the heaven and earth of dreams, one must not sleep.

Ancients cast mirrors to reflect forms, to see heaven when gazing at heaven, to see earth when gazing at earth. The mirror itself is without mind, yet deluded perception conceives of it as heaven and earth—does the mirror know this? How can it be dispelled? If one seeks to remove the heaven and earth within the mirror, one must shatter it. Yet if it is shattered, there will be no means to reflect the beauty or ugliness of forms. Thus it is said: to dispel the heaven and earth of mirrors, one must not look.

When water is clear, it reflects the sky above and the mountains and plains beside it; it nourishes things and, when drawn, sustains people. To remove the heaven and earth within water, one may dry it up. Yet if it is dried, the vessel will have no use for drawing. Thus it is said: to dispel the heaven and earth of water, one must not draw from the vessel.

Their existence or nonexistence lies not in them but in this. Therefore, the sage does not remove heaven and earth but removes perception. "Them" refers to dreams, mirrors, and water; "this" refers to perception. In dreams, mirrors, and water, sometimes heaven and earth appear, sometimes they do not. Whether they are reflected or not, whether heaven and earth exist or not, lies in the false conceptions of perception—not in the dreams, mirrors, or water themselves. Thus it is said: their existence or nonexistence lies not in them but in this.

"Therefore" is a phrase connecting the above to what follows. The sage, having awakened to true emptiness, perceives the stillness of the mind’s waves. Heaven and earth and true emptiness each abide in their own suchness, without mutual obstruction. Thus it is said: therefore, the sage does not remove heaven and earth but removes perception. This chapter clarifies how awakening shatters deluded perception, and true emptiness is unimpeded.

End of Chapter Six.

Master Guan Yin said: Heaven is not heaven of itself; there is that which makes it heaven. Earth is not earth of itself; there is that which makes it earth. Heaven and earth cannot generate themselves; that which generates heaven and earth is the Dao. The Dao generates the One; the One is the Supreme Ultimate. The One generates the Two; the Two are heaven and earth. Thus it is said: heaven is not heaven of itself; there is that which makes it heaven. Earth is not earth of itself; there is that which makes it earth.

For example, houses, boats, and carts depend on people to be completed; they do not complete themselves. Heaven and earth depend on the Dao for their generation and completion, just as houses, boats, and carts depend on human craftsmanship to be realized. How could houses, boats, and carts complete themselves? From this, we know that heaven and earth are generated and completed by the Dao’s operation of the Supreme Ultimate’s primordial qi. Thus it is said: for example, houses, boats, and carts depend on people to be completed; they do not complete themselves. "Them" refers to heaven and earth.

Knowing that they depend on something, knowing that this does not depend on anything—above, one does not see heaven; below, one does not see earth; within, one does not see the self; without, one does not see others. Knowing that heaven and earth depend on the Dao for their generation and completion, knowing that the great Dao depends on nothing for its generation and completion—as the classic says: "I know not whose child it is; it seems to have been before the Lord of Heaven." "Knowing" means awakening. Having awakened to the wondrous Dao, utterly free from duality, one transcends all opposition. Having transcended opposition, above and below, heaven and earth, within and without, self and others—all dualities vanish. Thus it is said: knowing that they depend on something, knowing that this does not depend on anything—above, one does not see heaven; below, one does not see earth; within, one does not see the self; without, one does not see others. This chapter clarifies that heaven and earth depend on the Dao for their generation, and the Dao is without duality in life and death.

End of Chapter Seven.

Master Guan Yin said: That which has time is qi; that which is not qi has never known day or night. What has temporal sequence is merely the movement of qi. The wondrous Dao and true emptiness are not qi. Before the Dao generated the One qi, there was no heaven, no earth, no sun, no moon—how could there have been day and night or the twelve hours? Thus it is said: that which has time is qi; that which is not qi has never known day or night.

That which has direction is form; that which is not form has never known north or south. What has spatial orientation is defined by form. The wondrous Dao and true emptiness are not form. Before the Dao generated the One qi, there was no heaven, no earth, no spatial orientation—how could there have been east, west, south, or north? Thus it is said: that which has direction is form; that which is not form has never known north or south.

What is meant by "not qi"? That from which qi itself arises. Like the wind obtained by waving a fan—before it is waved, there is no wind qi; once it is waved, it is called qi. Here, the text poses a question: What is meant by the wondrous Dao and true emptiness not being qi? It answers: that from which qi itself arises. For example, when one waves a bamboo fan to obtain a cool breeze, it is like the Dao’s operation generating the One qi. Thus it is said: What is meant by "not qi"? That from which qi itself arises—like the wind obtained by waving a fan.

The *dun* refers to a bamboo fan. Before the bamboo fan is waved, there is no wind qi—this illustrates the state before the Dao generated the One qi. Thus it is said: before it is waved, there is no wind qi. Yet when the bamboo fan is waved and a cool breeze arises, it is called qi—this illustrates the Dao in motion generating the One, which is then named qi. Thus it is said: once it is waved, it is called qi.

What is meant by "not form"? That from which form itself arises. For example, when one drills wood to obtain fire, before drilling, there is no form of fire; once drilled, it is called form. Here, the text poses another question: What is meant by the true emptiness of the Dao? It answers: that from which the forms of heaven and earth arise. For instance, when one drills wood and the form of fire appears, this illustrates the Supreme Ultimate (*Taiji*) dividing into the forms of height and depth. Thus it is said: What is meant by "not form"? That from which form itself arises—like drilling wood to obtain fire. Before one drills the wood, there is no form of fire; this illustrates the state before the Supreme Ultimate existed. Thus it is said: before drilling, there is no form of fire. Once the wood is drilled and fire appears, it is called the form of fire—this illustrates the state of "Non-Ultimate (*Wuji*) and yet Supreme Ultimate," where the Supreme Ultimate divides into the forms and positions of heaven and earth. Thus it is said: once drilled, it is called form. This chapter clarifies that the Dao does not belong to time, number, or spatial orientation.

**Chapter Eight**
Master Guan Yin said: The transformations of cold, heat, warmth, and chill are like those of tiles and stones. Placed in fire, they become hot; placed in water, they become cold; breathed upon, they become warm; blown upon, they become chilled. The Dao moves primordial qi, transforming yin and yang and the Five Phases to produce winter’s cold, summer’s heat, spring’s warmth, and autumn’s chill—the seasonal shifts of primordial qi. Like tiles and stones, when placed in fire, they grow hot, just as in summer, when fire prevails, primordial qi follows the fire’s nature to become scorching heat. When tiles or stones are immersed in water, they grow cold, just as in winter, when water prevails, primordial qi follows the water’s nature to become severe cold. When one breathes upon tiles or stones for a long time, they grow warm, just as in spring, when wood prevails, primordial qi follows the wood’s nature to become mild warmth. When one blows upon tiles or stones for a long time, they grow cool, just as in autumn, when metal prevails, primordial qi follows the metal’s nature to become crisp chill. Thus it is said: The transformations of cold, heat, warmth, and chill are like those of tiles and stones—placed in fire, they become hot; placed in water, they become cold; breathed upon, they become warm; blown upon, they become chilled.

Yet these changes arise only because external things come and go, while the tiles and stones themselves neither come nor go. Tiles and stones are inherently without cold, heat, warmth, or chill; it is only because of external factors—water soaking, fire burning, breathing, or blowing—that cold, heat, warmth, or chill come and go, while the tiles and stones themselves remain without such comings or goings. Thus it is said: these changes arise only because external things come and go, while the tiles and stones themselves neither come nor go. This illustrates that primordial qi is inherently without the comings and goings of cold, heat, warmth, or chill. It is only because the qi of water, fire, metal, and wood wax and wane that cold, heat, warmth, and chill come and go. Like reflections in water, which come and go, the water itself does not come or go. First, the example of tiles and stones with water, fire, breath, and blowing illustrates the comings and goings of primordial qi’s cold, heat, warmth, and chill. Fearing this may not be clear, the text offers another analogy to enlighten: primordial qi, like the qi of water, fire, metal, and wood, is like reflections in water—while the reflections come and go, the water itself does not. From this, we know that while the qi of water, fire, metal, and wood wax and wane, primordial qi itself has no comings or goings. If primordial qi is without the comings and goings of cold, heat, warmth, or chill, how much more so the Dao? Thus it is said: like reflections in water, which come and go, the water itself does not come or go. This chapter clarifies that the Dao does not belong to primordial qi, and primordial qi does not belong to time.

**Chapter Nine**
Master Guan Yin said: Shake a garment in empty space to summon wind; exhale upon an object to produce water; pour water into water to create sound; strike stone against stone to generate light. One who understands this principle can command wind, rain, thunder, and lightning. Humans are miniature heavens and earths, and heaven and earth are great humans. Wind, rain, thunder, and lightning are the works of heaven and earth, yet humans can do the same. When a person shakes a garment, wind arises from empty space; when one exhales upon an object, water forms—this is the image of wind and rain. When water is poured into water, sound resounds; when two stones are struck together, sparks fly—this is the image of thunder and lightning. One who understands this principle can summon wind and rain, instantly arouse thunder and lightning—it is no difficult feat. Thus it is said: shake a garment in empty space to summon wind; exhale upon an object to produce water; pour water into water to create sound; strike stone against stone to generate light. One who understands this principle can command wind, rain, thunder, and lightning.

Wind, rain, thunder, and lightning all arise from qi, and qi arises from the mind. *Yin* means "cause"—wind, rain, thunder, and lightning arise from yin and yang. When yang qi descends but finds no yin qi to receive it, it transforms into wind. When yin qi ascends but finds no yang qi to meet it, it transforms into clouds. When yin and yang clash, they generate thunder and lightning. From this, we know that wind, rain, thunder, and lightning arise from qi. Thus it is said: wind, rain, thunder, and lightning all arise from qi. One who awakens to the wondrous Dao of true emptiness, grasps the source of yin-yang and the One qi, and penetrates the marvels of creation, can wield the true mind to transform qi, summoning wind and rain, instantly arousing thunder and lightning—these are but trifling feats for the sage. Thus it is said: and qi arises from the mind. Just as inwardly contemplating great fire for a long time produces warmth, and inwardly contemplating great water for a long time produces cold, one who understands this principle can emulate the powers of heaven and earth.

The preceding discussion of wind, rain, thunder, and lightning as attainable arts may still leave some in doubt, so further analogies are offered to clarify. Consider those who practice forced and contrived methods, inwardly visualizing the lower elixir field as a great wheel of fire—over time, their entire body grows warm, and they mistake this warmth for harmony, though it is not. Or those who inwardly contemplate their body and mind as a vast, still, icy pool—over time, they feel their whole body grow cold and assume this to be a realm of pure clarity, though it is not. Such deluded imaginings of heat and cold still shift with the mind’s intent; how much more so when the true mind is awakened? One who grasps this analogy can summon wind and rain, instantly arouse thunder and lightning—these are the virtues of heaven and earth, which the enlightened may all emulate. This chapter reveals the Dao as the origin of yin and yang, its power harmonizing with the workings of heaven and earth.

**Chapter Ten**
Master Guan Yin said: The transformations of the five clouds can foretell the year’s abundance or scarcity. The five clouds are the clouds of five colors—blue, yellow, red, white, and black. Their transformations refer to the mutual changes among these five. "The year" means the current year; "abundance" means a bountiful harvest, while "scarcity" means famine and crop failure. According to *The Book of Cloud Omens*: On the first morning of the first lunar month, observe the five directions. The appearance of five-colored clouds in each direction indicates abundance or scarcity for that region. Black clouds foretell little snow and much rain in that direction; red clouds foretell drought and crop failure; blue clouds foretell pests and poor wheat harvests; white clouds foretell human calamities and poor yields of japonica and glutinous rice; yellow clouds foretell peace among the people and moderate harvests of crops. If the yellow clouds take on a verdant hue, the region will enjoy a great harvest of the five grains. The five grains are those with edges, husks, awns, and ears. If black, red, blue, white, or yellow clouds appear alone, scarcity follows; if the five colors intermingle or take on a verdant yellow, abundance ensues. Thus it is said: The transformations of the five clouds can foretell the year’s abundance or scarcity.

The arrival of the eight winds can foretell the fortune or misfortune of the moment. The eight winds are the winds arising from the directions of the eight trigrams. "Arrival" refers to winds blowing from those directions. According to *The Book of Wind Omens*: Each day at the hour of *yin*, observe the following: Winds from the *qian* direction are called the *buzhou* wind—neither wholly auspicious nor inauspicious. Winds from the *kan* direction are called the *guangmo* wind—neither fortunate nor misfortunate. Winds from the *gen* direction are called the *rong* wind, also known as the inauspicious wind—half fortunate, half misfortunate. Winds from the *zhen* direction are called the *mingshu* wind—greatly auspicious. Winds from the *xun* direction are called the *qingming* wind—greatly auspicious. Winds from the *li* direction are called the *jing* wind—greatly auspicious. Winds from the *kun* direction are called the *dong* wind—misfortunate. Winds from the *dui* direction are called the *yanhe* wind—greatly misfortunate. Thus it is said: The arrival of the eight winds can foretell the fortune or misfortune of the moment.

From this, we know that good and ill fortune, calamity and blessing, all arise from the movement of qi. "From this, we know" means that by divining abundance or scarcity, fortune or misfortune through wind and clouds, we understand that their transformations—whether auspicious or inauspicious, calamitous or blessed, scarce or abundant—all proceed from the movement of qi. Thus it is said: From this, we know that good and ill fortune, calamity and blessing, all arise from the movement of qi.

Blending self and others, harmonizing with heaven and earth—yet those of private cleverness claim it as their own. Self, others, heaven, and earth all arise from the movement of the One qi, and when that qi is exhausted, self, others, heaven, and earth perish. That they endure now shows their unity in the One qi. Thus it is said: Blending self and others, harmonizing with heaven and earth. The foregoing divinations of wind and clouds, the blending of self and others, and the harmony with heaven and earth are all products of deluded perception and private cleverness. Such deluded perception and private cleverness are not the original nature. Those who mistake deluded perception and private cleverness for their true nature are in error. Thus it is said: yet those of private cleverness claim it as their own. This chapter reveals that private cleverness is not the nature, for all arises from the movement of the One qi.

**Chapter Eleven**
Master Guan Yin said: Heaven and earth are lodged, the myriad things are lodged, the self is lodged, the Dao is lodged. If separated from lodging, the Dao cannot stand. "Lodged" means to be entrusted. Nothing surpasses yin and yang in qi, nor heaven and earth in form. Heaven and earth are the greatest of the formed, yet they are but minute things within the Great Void—they are entrusted within the primordial qi of the Great Void. Thus it is said: Heaven and earth are lodged. The myriad things are entrusted within the primordial qi between heaven and earth. Thus it is said: The myriad things are lodged. The self, originally without self, is the self without self, entrusted within the primordial qi of the Dao to gain its life. Thus it is said: The self is lodged. The Dao, originally without name, is entrusted by the sage with a forced name to proclaim it. Thus it is said: The Dao is lodged. "If" means supposing; if separated from the forced name of the Dao, then no name can be named, and the forced name of the Dao cannot stand. Thus it is said: If separated from lodging, the Dao cannot stand. This chapter reveals that from the original source, the trace descends, yet does not depart from lodging; the name, following the trace, returns to the source, and the forced name of the Dao cannot stand.

**The Three Ultimates**

The "Ultimate" signifies the supreme attainment of transcending the ordinary and surpassing the sagely to embody the Dao, comprising twenty-seven chapters.

Master Guanyin said: In governing the world, the sage does not impose his own standards of worth or folly, thus he responds to others' worth by affirming their worth, and to others' folly by affirming their folly.

The sage is the sagely Son of Heaven who has fully realized the Dao. To govern the world means the sagely Son of Heaven pacifies and comforts the people through virtue and the Dao. Thus it is said: "the sage governs the world." "Does not impose his own standards of worth or folly" means the sage is without self; the worthy manifest their worth, and the foolish manifest their folly, yet the names of worth and folly do not originate from the sage. Thus it is said: "does not impose his own standards of worth or folly." "Thus" is a phrase connecting the preceding and following statements.

When the multitude all declare someone worthy, the sage, responding to their acclaim, also affirms their worth and advances them. When the multitude all declare someone foolish, the sage, responding to their censure, also affirms their folly and demotes them. Thus it is said: "he responds to others' worth by affirming their worth, and to others' folly by affirming their folly." He does not impose his own standards of right or wrong, thus he responds to affairs that are right by affirming their rightness, and to affairs that are wrong by affirming their wrongness.

Since the sage is without self, right and wrong arise from the affairs themselves, and the names of right and wrong do not originate from the sage. Thus it is said: "does not impose his own standards of right or wrong." "Affairs" refer to application. Though the essence is originally nameless, names are established according to function. When applied to good, if the multitude all declare it right, the sage, responding to their acclaim, also affirms its rightness and rewards it. When applied to evil, if the multitude all declare it wrong, the sage, responding to their censure, also affirms its wrongness and punishes it. Thus it is said: "he responds to affairs that are right by affirming their rightness, and to affairs that are wrong by affirming their wrongness."

He knows the great unity of past and present, thus sometimes he precedes the past, sometimes he precedes the present.

"Knows" means awakening. The past refers to the principles before the present; the present refers to the affairs before us. The sage, having realized the Dao and awakened to affairs, perceives principle and affair as non-dual, past and present as one continuum. Thus it is said: "knows the great unity of past and present." The sage attains the marvel of self-benefit and benefiting others, thus sometimes he first reveals principle to others, sometimes he first reveals affairs to others. Those of superior capacity may enter through principle or through affairs; though principle and affair differ, entry is without distinction. Thus it is said: "sometimes he precedes the past, sometimes he precedes the present."

He knows the great unity of inner and outer, thus sometimes he precedes the inner, sometimes he precedes the outer.

"Knows" means awakening. The sage, having fully realized the marvelous Dao, attains the wondrous union of form and spirit, body and mind as one continuum. Thus it is said: "knows the great unity of inner and outer." The sage, with boundless compassion and universal benefit, for those of superior capacity, first reveals the clarity of mind and awakening of nature. Those of superior capacity directly and suddenly awaken to the originally pure source of the mind. Thus it is said: "sometimes he precedes the inner." For those of middling and lesser capacity, fearing they may not easily awaken, the sage first reveals the marvels of cultivating the body and preserving life, enabling them to gradually comprehend. Thus it is said: "sometimes he precedes the outer."

The things of the world cannot burden him, thus he fundamentally embodies humility.

The sage, having penetrated true emptiness and embodied the great void, though the things of the world are myriad and boundless, how could they ever burden or obstruct the void? Thus it is said: "the things of the world cannot burden him." The sage, in nurturing the world, models himself after the rivers and seas, dwelling below, embracing dust and enduring defilement. The myriad states flow toward and submit to him; the world delights in exalting him without weariness. All are effects of the fundamental virtue of humility. Thus it is said: "fundamentally embodies humility."

The things of the world cannot estrange him, thus he embraces them with emptiness.

"Things" refer to all beings. The sage, governing the world with virtue and the Dao, causes the myriad states to return to virtue and submit to transformation, willingly becoming his subjects without weariness. Thus the people of the world cannot be estranged from the sage. Thus it is said: "the things of the world cannot estrange him." Having gained the submission and transformation of the myriad states, willingly becoming his subjects without weariness, the sage also does not become self-satisfied; his mind is one with the great void. Thus it is said: "he embraces them with emptiness."

The things of the world cannot make governance difficult for him, thus he conducts affairs with ease.

The people of the world delight in returning to sagely virtue; there are no arduous or difficult tasks to be imposed. The common people delight in peace and prosperity, and there are no people difficult to transform. Thus the affairs he administers are without difficulty. Thus it is said: "the things of the world cannot make governance difficult for him, thus he conducts affairs with ease."

The things of the world cannot obstruct him, thus he transforms them with adaptability.

In a world of great peace, the common people prosper, harmonious qi flows freely, heaven and earth, yin and yang are in harmonious accord, and the myriad things fulfill their growth and completion without a single thing being obstructed or blocked. The sage, nurturing himself with the Dao and acting without contrivance, responds to change with virtue and applies it. "Adaptability" means application. Thus it is said: "the things of the world cannot obstruct him, thus he transforms them with adaptability."

With this centered governance of the world, rites may be established. "With this" refers to the application of adaptability. "Centered" means without the faults of excess or deficiency. When the application of adaptability is fitting and does not lose the hearts of the world's people, rites may be established to rectify the relationships between ruler and subject, superior and inferior, and to distinguish the roles of father and son. Thus it is said: "With this centered governance of the world, rites may be established."

With this harmonization of the world, music may be created. Music embodies harmony, valuing it without indulgence. When this virtue is applied to nurture the age, the world attains peace, rites and music flourish, and moral transformation becomes beautiful. Thus it is said: "With this harmonization of the world, music may be created." "Creation" signifies flourishing.

With this impartial governance of the world, finances may be managed. When this virtue and power nurture the age, those who are just and selfless may be entrusted with the administration of the world's resources. Thus it is said: "With this impartial governance of the world, finances may be managed."

With this all-encompassing governance of the world, insults may be repelled. When this virtue and power nurture the age, transforming the entire world, those who insult their superiors or act with arrogance will cease of their own accord without the need for restraint. "Repel" means to prohibit. Thus it is said: "With this all-encompassing governance of the world, insults may be repelled."

With this responsiveness to the world, laws may be established. When this virtue and power nurture the age, if there are those who harm the world's people, laws may be established to eliminate them; if there are those who benefit the world's people, laws may be established to promote them. Thus it is said: "With this responsiveness to the world, laws may be established."

With this observation of the world, tools may be crafted. When this virtue and power nurture the age, observing what is convenient for the world's people, tools may be crafted and provided for their use. Thus it is said: "With this observation of the world, tools may be crafted."

The sage does not govern the world by himself but governs it through the world. The sage, free from self, nurtures the age with virtue and power, so that the world's people each settle into their occupations, delight in great peace, and forget the ruler's influence. Thus it is said: "The sage does not govern the world by himself but governs it through the world."

The world attributes merit to the sage, yet the sage ascribes merit to the world. When the world's people attribute the merit of great peace to the sage, the sage does not claim it as his own, nor does he say, "I am capable of governing the world." The sage nurtures himself with humility and ascribes merit to the world's people. This explains why the sage does not govern the world by himself but governs it through the world. Thus it is said: "The world attributes merit to the sage, yet the sage ascribes merit to the world."

Therefore, in the governance of Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang, the world all declared it to be natural. The four emperors—Tang Yao, Yu Shun, Xia Yu, and Shang Tang—governed the world to great peace, causing the people to forget the ruler's influence. The world's people all declared the peace to be natural, asking, "What has the ruler's power to do with it?" Thus it is said: "In the governance of Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang, the world all declared it to be natural." This chapter clarifies that the sage nurtures the age with virtue and power, free from self.

**Chapter One**

Master Guan Yin said: Heaven covers all without exception, giving life and bringing death, yet heaven harbors no love or hatred. The greatest is heaven, which shelters not a single thing from its covering. It gives life in spring and brings death in autumn, yet it acts without intent. How could heaven love and give life, or hate and bring death? Thus it is said: "Heaven covers all without exception, giving life and bringing death, yet heaven harbors no love or hatred."

The sun shines upon all without exception, revealing beauty and ugliness, yet the sun shows no partiality. The brightest is the sun, which shines upon not a single thing without its illumination. Because of the sun's light, beauty is revealed in its loveliness and ugliness in its coarseness, yet the sun treats beauty and ugliness equally, shining upon all without intent. How could it favor beauty with its light or slight ugliness by withholding it? Thus it is said: "The sun shines upon all without exception, revealing beauty and ugliness, yet the sun shows no partiality." This chapter uses heaven and the sun as metaphors for the sage's universal benefit and impartiality.

**Chapter Two**

Master Guan Yin said: The sage's Way follows the mandate of heaven, not something the sage can claim as his own. The Way is beyond thought or discussion. "Heaven" refers to that which is so of itself. "Mandate" refers to that which is so without knowing why. The sage thoroughly comprehends the unfathomable Way, which is so of itself, so without knowing why. Even the forced name of the Way is not established, nor is there anything the sage can claim as his ability. Thus it is said: "The sage's Way follows the mandate of heaven, not something the sage can claim as his own."

The sage's virtue accords with the times, not something the sage can claim as his own virtue. "Accords" means to align. The sage universally benefits the age without seeking repayment or gratitude, forgetting his abilities and not clinging to the name of virtue. Thus it is said: "The sage's virtue accords with the times, not something the sage can claim as his own virtue."

The sage's affairs are for the sake of others, not something the sage can claim as his own affairs. "Affairs" means application. The sage applies the use of non-use to universally benefit without end, acting for others without the intent to act. Thus it is said: "The sage's affairs are for the sake of others, not something the sage can claim as his own affairs."

Therefore, the sage does not possess the Way, does not possess virtue, and does not possess affairs. The sage acts without intent, so without knowing why. Thus he does not possess the name of the Way, the traces of virtue, or the application of affairs. Thus it is said: "Therefore, the sage does not possess the Way, does not possess virtue, and does not possess affairs." This chapter clarifies that the sage sweeps away all to return to the root, free from self.

**Chapter Three**

Master Guan Yin said: The sage knows that the self is no-self, thus he unites all with benevolence. Benevolence is compassion, kindness, and benefiting others. The sage profoundly embodies true emptiness, where the self is fundamentally no-self, and the name "self" is merely provisional. The sage awakens to this, so in benevolence, there is no difference between self and other. Thus it is said: "The sage knows that the self is no-self, thus he unites all with benevolence."

**Chapter Four**

Master Guan Yin said: Knowing that affairs are no-self, thus he adapts them with rightness. Affairs are application; adaptation is also application. The sage awakens to the application of no-self to suit all things. Thus it is said: "Knowing that affairs are no-self, thus he adapts them with rightness." Rightness is appropriateness. Knowing that the mind is no-self, thus he disciplines it with ritual. The sage awakens to the originally wondrous mind, fundamentally without the mark of self, thus he disciplines others with the practice of proper conduct. Thus it is said: "Knowing that the mind is no-self, thus he disciplines it with ritual." Ritual is practice, also proper conduct. Knowing that consciousness is no-self, thus he illuminates it with wisdom. The sage awakens to the source of numinous consciousness, fundamentally without self, thus he employs illumination to discern right and wrong, truth and falsehood. Thus it is said: "Knowing that consciousness is no-self, thus he illuminates it with wisdom." Wisdom is the discernment of right and wrong, also the examination of truth and falsehood. Knowing that speech is no-self, thus he upholds it with trustworthiness. The sage awakens to speech without speech, also without the mark of self in names, thus he preserves true sincerity, where word and deed accord. Thus it is said: "Knowing that speech is no-self, thus he upholds it with trustworthiness." This chapter clarifies that the sage, being without self, wondrously applies the five constant virtues.

**Chapter Five**

Master Guan Yin said: The Way of the sage may employ benevolence as benevolence, or rightness as benevolence, or ritual, wisdom, or trustworthiness as benevolence. "Employ" means application. The sage takes the Dao as essence and the five constants as application. Applying them to compassion, kindness, and benefiting others, thus it is said: "The Way of the sage may employ benevolence as benevolence." Or adjudicating right and wrong, making things fitting and appropriate while rooted in compassion, thus it is said: "or rightness as benevolence." Or practicing proper conduct while rooted in compassion and kindness, or discerning truth and falsehood while rooted in compassion and kindness, or aligning word and deed while rooted in compassion and kindness, thus it is said: "or ritual, wisdom, or trustworthiness as benevolence." Benevolence, rightness, ritual, wisdom, and trustworthiness each encompass the five. Sometimes practicing transformation encompasses rightness, ritual, wisdom, and trustworthiness; sometimes practicing rightness encompasses ritual, wisdom, trustworthiness, and benevolence; sometimes practicing ritual encompasses wisdom, trustworthiness, transformation, and rightness; sometimes practicing wisdom encompasses trustworthiness, rightness, ritual, and benevolence; sometimes practicing trustworthiness encompasses benevolence, rightness, ritual, and wisdom. Thus it is said: "Benevolence, rightness, ritual, wisdom, and trustworthiness each encompass the five." The sage unifies without attachment; the world cannot name him. The sage penetrates true emptiness, transcends all extremes, surpasses all dharmic marks, and abides in non-attainment, unstained by names. No name can capture him, and the people of the world cannot describe the sage’s appearance. Thus it is said: "The sage unifies without attachment; the world cannot name him." "Without attachment" means without clinging. This chapter clarifies the sage’s application without application, where no traces or names remain.

**Chapter Six**

Master Guan Yin said: Do not observe the sage through conduct, for the Dao leaves no traces. The sage moves contrary or in accord, unfathomable even to spirits and gods. The Dao of true emptiness leaves no trace to follow. Thus it is said: "Do not observe the sage through conduct, for the Dao leaves no traces." "Traces" are footprints; "do not" is a prohibitive term. Do not observe the sage through speech, for the Dao is without speech. "Do not observe the sage through speech" means the sage’s speech is speechless, allowing others to awaken to the meaning beyond words. The meaning beyond words is the Dao itself, which is fundamentally nameless and cannot be captured in speech. Do not observe the sage through ability, for the Dao is without action. "Do not observe the sage through ability" means the sage acts without acting, acting through non-action. Thus it is said: "Do not observe the sage through ability, for the Dao is without action." Do not observe the sage through appearance, for the Dao is without form. "Do not observe the sage through appearance" means the sage’s appearance does not differ from others. His essence merges with true emptiness, leaving no form to behold. Thus it is said: "Do not observe the sage through appearance, for the Dao is without form." This chapter clarifies that the sage’s Dao does not belong to traces, speech, action, or form, and cannot be observed through conduct, speech, ability, or appearance.

**Chapter Seven**

Master Guan Yin said: Though conduct may be most eminent, it does not depart from high and low. When one cultivates goodness, standing out from the multitude, the multitude is low while virtuous conduct is high. High and low are relative and do not depart from traces. Thus it is said: "Though conduct may be most eminent, it does not depart from high and low." This chapter explains the previous chapter’s "Do not observe the sage through conduct." Though speech may be most refined, it does not depart from right and wrong. When one speaks with wondrous principle, differing from the multitude, the multitude’s speech is unrefined and thus wrong, while refined speech is right. Right and wrong are relative and do not depart from names and marks. Thus it is said: "Though speech may be most refined, it does not depart from right and wrong." "Refined" means skillful and wondrous. This chapter explains the previous chapter’s "Do not observe the sage through speech." Though ability may be most divine, it does not depart from skill and clumsiness. When one’s creations and actions are divinely wondrous, differing from the multitude, those who cannot are clumsy, while those who can are skillful. Skill and clumsiness are relative and do not depart from action. Thus it is said: "Though ability may be most divine, it does not depart from skill and clumsiness." This chapter explains the previous chapter’s "Do not observe the sage through ability." Though appearance may be most extraordinary, it does not depart from beauty and ugliness. When one’s appearance is surpassingly beautiful, differing from the multitude, the multitude’s appearance is not beautiful and thus ugly, while beautiful appearance is lovely. Beauty and ugliness are relative and do not depart from provisional form. Thus it is said: "Though appearance may be most extraordinary, it does not depart from beauty and ugliness." This chapter explains the previous chapter’s "Do not observe the sage through appearance." The sage employs these to manifest to the world; when the world darkly comprehends them, only then does it perceive the sage. The sage descends into the world, employing conduct, speech, ability, and appearance to manifest to all. Thus it is said: "The sage employs these to manifest to the world." When students of the world awaken before the arising of conduct, speech, ability, or appearance, penetrating and comprehending the profound emptiness of the sage’s wondrous Dao, thus it is said: "When the world darkly comprehends them, only then does it perceive the sage."

This chapter clearly instructs students in attaining the wondrous by following the flow.

**Chapter Seven**
Master Guan Yin said: The sage took the bee as teacher to establish ruler and subject, took the spider as teacher to establish nets and snares, took the bowing rat as teacher to create ritual, and took the fighting mantis as teacher to devise weaponry.

The sages of antiquity, observing the bees’ hierarchical order, took them as their model and thus established ruler and subject to govern the world—hence it is said: *The sage took the bee as teacher to establish ruler and subject.* The sages of the middle age, observing the spider weaving its web to catch food, took it as their model for combat and thus established nets and snares to capture birds and beasts for sacrifice—hence it is said: *took the spider as teacher to establish nets and snares.* The sage, observing the mountain rat that bows and chirps before humans, took it as their model and thus created ritual and music to rectify high and low, distinguish noble and base, and order the great human relationships. Further observing the mole crickets in their two burrows, fighting and biting over food, they took them as their model and thus devised weaponry to punish the rebellious—hence it is said: *took the bowing rat as teacher to create ritual, took the fighting mantis as teacher to devise weaponry.*

The common people take the worthy as their teachers; the worthy take the sages as their teachers; the sages take the myriad things as their teachers. Only the sage is one with things, and thus has no self.

The common people take the worthy as their teachers to learn the Five Constants and the hundred practices—hence it is said: *The common people take the worthy as their teachers.* The worthy take the sages as their teachers to learn the great Dao of non-action—hence it is said: *The worthy take the sages as their teachers.* The sage, with boundless compassion and universal benefit, takes the natural principles of the myriad things as their teachers and employs all manner of expedient means to benefit the world—hence it is said: *The sages take the myriad things as their teachers.* The sage, penetrating the true emptiness, dwells in the world with harmonious light yet unobtrusive, moving with the dust yet unstained, no different from others, embodying the void and thus without self—hence it is said: *Only the sage is one with things, and thus has no self.*

This chapter reveals the sage’s boundless universal benefit.

**Chapter Eight**
Master Guan Yin said: The sage says: *Observe the Dao—heaven, earth, and the myriad things are all my Dao.* They harmonize with its call and response, its beginnings and endings, its green and yellow, its hatching and nurturing. They do not cling to the Dao, do not discard things, do not exalt the noble, do not despise the lowly.

The sage’s mind merges with the supreme Dao, and in reflection, heaven, earth, and the myriad things are all their wondrous Dao—hence it is said: *The sage says: Observe the Dao—heaven, earth, and the myriad things are all my Dao.* They further observe the call and response of husband and wife, the beginnings and endings of the myriad things, the green and yellow of grasses and trees, the hatching and nurturing of male and female—all are the wondrous Dao. Hence it is said: *They harmonize with its call and response, its beginnings and endings, its green and yellow, its hatching and nurturing.* The sage, awakening to the truth that heaven, earth, and the myriad things—great and small, soaring and hidden, moving and still—are all the wondrous Dao, does not generate thoughts of cherishing the Dao or discarding things, of exalting the noble or despising the lowly. Hence it is said: *They do not cling to the Dao, do not discard things, do not exalt the noble, do not despise the lowly.*

The worthy say: *Each thing differs; daily they discard, daily they bestow, lengthen and shorten, straighten and square—these are those enslaved by things.*

*Things* here mean *use.* The worthy, deluded about their essence, focus solely on use, and their uses are not uniform—hence it is said: *Each thing differs.* *Dawn* means *day.* The worthy daily discard evil and daily bestow kind words, urging others to practice—hence it is said: *daily they discard, daily they bestow.* The worthy instruct others, clarifying that what is right is long in principle, what is wrong is short in principle, and strive to make people practice upright and square conduct—hence it is said: *lengthen and shorten, straighten and square.* Those who, deluded about their essence, focus solely on use, whose uses are not uniform, who ceaselessly debate discarding and bestowing, lengthening and shortening, straightening and squaring—these are those who make use their servants and masters. Hence it is said: *these are those enslaved by things.*

Little do they know that the sage scorns the impure and distinguishes proper dwellings, doing so for others, not for themselves.

*Scorns the impure* means despising those who are base, mixed, and defiled by impurity. *Distinguishes proper dwellings* means using ritual propriety to rectify ruler and subject, father and son, noble and base, high and low, and to distinguish the proper places of men and women, husbands and wives, and brothers. The worthy little know that the sage despises those who are base, mixed, and defiled by impurity, establishing ritual propriety to distinguish the dwellings of ruler and subject, father and son, husband and wife, brothers, men and women, preventing them from mixing in filthy conduct. They do so for the sake of the world’s people, not for themselves. Hence it is said: *Little do they know that the sage scorns the impure and distinguishes proper dwellings, doing so for others, not for themselves.*

This chapter reveals that the Dao is omnipresent, and the sage benefits things without self.

**Chapter Nine**
Master Guan Yin said: In food and drink, clothing, houses, boats, and carriages, the sage is the same as the common people; in nobility and baseness, wealth and poverty, they are the same.

The sage, penetrating the wondrous Dao, deeply hidden in the world, harmonizes their light yet does not shine, moves with the dust yet is unstained. What is meant by *harmonizing their light and moving with the dust, no different from others?* It is their food and drink, clothing, houses, boats and carriages, nobility and baseness, wealth and poverty. The sage dwells in the world: when the common eat, they eat; when the common wear clothes, they wear clothes; when the common dwell in houses, they dwell in houses; when the common ride boats and carriages, they ride boats and carriages. When the common serve in office and are noble, they serve in office and are noble; when the common are commoners and base, they are commoners and base. When the common are poor and without wealth, they are poor and without wealth; when the common are rich and have wealth, they are rich and have wealth. Their traces in the world are never different from others. Hence it is said: *In food and drink, clothing, houses, boats, and carriages, the sage is the same as the common people; in nobility and baseness, wealth and poverty, they are the same.*

The common people often emulate the sage; the sage often emulates the common people. Those who look up to their loftiness and exaggerate their greatness—is it so, or is it not?

The common people’s traces are no different from the sage’s traces in the world—hence it is said: *The common people often emulate the sage.* The sage often emulates the common people. Those common people who admire the sage’s high Dao and great virtue—hence it is said: *Those who look up to their loftiness and exaggerate their greatness.*

At times, the sage establishes wondrous function—impartial and universally beneficial—without seeking gratitude in return. The common people, admiring the loftiness of the Dao and extolling the vastness of its virtue, when they witness the sage sweeping away all traces to return to the root, leaving not a speck of dust, beyond the reckoning of yin and yang, beyond the scrutiny of gods and spirits—how much more so for ordinary beings—hence it is said: *Is it so, or is it not?* This chapter clarifies the sage’s unfathomable concealment and revelation.

**Chapter Ten Concludes**

Master Guan Yin said: If a fish wishes to differ from the school of fish, abandoning the water to leap onto the shore, it dies at once. If a tiger wishes to differ from the pack of tigers, abandoning the mountain to enter the marketplace, it is captured. The fish is a metaphor for the common people; the water, a metaphor for the vast and wondrous Dao. When people delight in treading paths of unrighteousness, devising strange schemes, they violate the supreme Dao. Condemned by men and reproached by spirits, they fail to complete their allotted years and die—like a fish that, wishing to differ from the school, is deprived of water and leaps onto the shore, only to wither and perish. Hence it is said: *If a fish wishes to differ from the school of fish, abandoning the water to leap onto the shore, it dies at once.*

The tiger is a metaphor for the noble person; the mountain, a metaphor for towering supreme virtue. When the noble person pursues fame at the expense of true virtue, coveting rank and emolument, ensnared by wealth and honor without knowing retreat, they may be slandered and brought low, or tread perilous paths without meeting a good end—like a tiger that, wishing to differ from the pack, abandons the great mountain to enter the city, only to be seized and slain by men. Hence it is said: *If a tiger wishes to differ from the pack of tigers, abandoning the mountain to enter the marketplace, it is captured.* "At once" means immediately.

The sage does not differ from the common people; thus, external things cannot constrain them. The sage’s conduct is not eccentric; their traces are the same as the common people’s. They tread no path but the Dao, enact no power but virtue. Their body merges with true emptiness, unbound by the myriad conditions. Free and at ease, uniquely liberated and unshackled, they wander beyond the dust and grime, transcendent and carefree before the forms of emperors and gods. Hence it is said: *The sage does not differ from the common people; thus, external things cannot constrain them.* "Thus" means uniquely. This chapter clarifies that the sage’s conduct is not eccentric, their dwelling in the world free and unfettered.

**Chapter Eleven Concludes**

Master Guan Yin said: The Dao does not act. Those who respond to the world with the Dao engage in affairs, not the Dao. "Act" means to do; "affairs" means function. The sage embodies the Dao, acting without contrivance, naturally. Hence it is said: *The Dao does not act.* The sage employs virtue as function, arising from the essence to manifest function. Hence it is said: *Those who respond to the world with the Dao.* Arising from the essence to manifest function, their responses to change are inexhaustible. The common people, seeing the sage’s functional affairs, mistake them for the wondrous essence of the Dao. Little do they know that these are functions, not the essence. Hence it is said: *They engage in affairs, not the Dao.*

The Dao has no direction. Those who lodge the Dao in things engage with things, not the Dao. The Dao is originally formless—how could it have the eight directions, above and below, the ten quarters? "With" means to employ; "things" means people; "lodge" means entrusting to wondrous words to instruct people. The common people, seeing the sage’s profound and wondrous principles, mistake them for the Dao. Little do they know that these are traces of instruction, not the Dao itself. Hence it is said: *The Dao has no direction. Those who lodge the Dao in things engage with things, not the Dao.*

The sage ultimately cannot bring forth the Dao to show others. "Ultimately" means in the end; "show" means to make clear. The Dao is true emptiness—formless, without appearance, without likeness, without comparison. The mind cannot fathom it through thought, the mouth cannot discuss it through speech. It is realized only when the heart awakens to its secret accord. Though the sage may do so, they ultimately cannot grasp the wondrous Dao to enlighten disciples. Hence it is said: *The sage ultimately cannot bring forth the Dao to show others.* This chapter clarifies that the Dao is realized through the heart’s awakening; even the sage cannot convey it to others.

**Chapter Twelve Concludes**

Master Guan Yin said: Like a bell sounding when struck, like a drum resounding when beaten—such are the sage’s words. Bells and drums do not sound themselves; they respond when touched, their resonance without intent. This illustrates how the sage responds only when moved, their words without premeditation. The bell’s sound is clear, illustrating how the sage, moved to respond, instructs people with principle, guiding them to awaken through reason. Hence it is said: *Like a bell sounding when struck.* The drum’s sound is deep, illustrating how the sage, moved to respond, instructs people with affairs, guiding them to awaken through practice. Hence it is said: *Like a drum resounding when beaten—such are the sage’s words.*

Like a cart moving when drawn, like a boat gliding when poled—such are the sage’s actions. Carts and boats do not move themselves; they proceed only when impelled, their motion without intent. This illustrates how the sage acts only when compelled, proceeding only when unavoidable, their actions without premeditation. The cart’s movement leaves traces, illustrating how the sage at times comforts the world, at times assists it, universally benefiting all under heaven. Their traces are luminous, enduring through the ages without fading. Hence it is said: *Like a cart moving when drawn.* The boat’s movement leaves no trace, illustrating how the sage, compelled to respond to the world, enacts virtue. The highest virtue does not claim virtue, leaving traces that are no traces, confounding the wise and foolish alike, beyond the ken of gods and spirits. Hence it is said: *Like a boat gliding when poled—such are the sage’s actions.*

Only when none can name it does it silence the world’s words. Only when none can know it does it strip the world’s wisdom. The Dao is originally nameless; it is forcibly called the Dao. When the forced name is dissolved, the Dao too ceases to stand. Hence it is said: *Only when none can name it.* When none can name it, words have no ground for discussion. Even the world’s most capable, confronted with this, fall silent in retreat. Hence it is said: *It silences the world’s words.* The Dao is originally without inclination; contemplation cannot grasp it to know it. When contemplation cannot grasp it to know it, even the world’s greatest sages, confronted with this, are rendered powerless. Hence it is said: *Only when none can know it does it strip the world’s wisdom.*

This chapter elucidates that the sage’s words and actions are without deliberate intent, and the Dao is beyond contemplation and discussion.

**Chapter Thirteen**
Master Guan Yin said: The centipede eats the snake, the snake eats the toad, and the toad eats the centipede—each devours the other. The "centipede" here refers to the *wugong*; the "toad," to the *hama*. The centipede enters the snake’s nostrils to consume its brain and marrow; the snake swallows the toad, and the toad swallows the centipede. These three creatures mutually consume one another, hence the saying: *The centipede eats the snake, the snake eats the toad, the toad eats the centipede*—serving as an analogy.

The sage’s words are likewise: they speak of the flaws of "being and non-being," then of the flaws of "neither being nor non-being," and then of the flaws of abandoning "neither being nor non-being." The named teachings and dharmic appearances left by the sage resemble the centipede, snake, and toad devouring one another. Thus it is said: *The sage’s words are likewise.* The sage’s words encompass both "being" and "non-being." Those who are deluded cling to these two extremes, which becomes the flaw in cultivating the Dao. This aligns with the analogy of *the centipede eating the snake*, hence the saying: *they speak of the flaws of "being and non-being."*

Once one recognizes that the two extremes of "being and non-being" are erroneous, one neither clings to being nor to non-being, and only practices the Middle Way. Yet they then speak of the flaws of "neither being nor non-being." Once one recognizes that the Middle Way of "neither being nor non-being" is also a flaw, one discards "neither being nor non-being" and does not establish either the two extremes or the Middle Way. The deluded, failing to awaken, cling to these words as if they were the Dao itself—this, too, is a flaw in cultivating the Dao. This corresponds to the analogy of *the snake eating the toad, the toad eating the centipede*, hence the saying: *they speak of the flaws of abandoning "neither being nor non-being."*

Words are like drawing a saw: the previous statements on "being and non-being," "neither being nor non-being," and abandoning "neither being nor non-being" all reveal flaws. These words mutually erode one another, like pulling a saw back and forth, deepening the traces. Thus it is said: *Words are like drawing a saw.*

Only those who are truly adept do not cling to a single word. "Clinging" means attachment. The sage’s words are like the fish trap and rabbit snare: the trap is the means to catch fish, but once the fish is caught, the trap is forgotten; the snare is the means to catch the rabbit, but once the rabbit is caught, the snare is forgotten. Words are the means to convey meaning, but once the meaning is grasped, the words are forgotten. To "forget words" is to not cling to them. Only those who profoundly awaken to the sage’s Dao do not cling to words, rendering them ineffable and beyond mutual erosion. Thus it is said: *Only those who are truly adept do not cling to a single word.*

This chapter clarifies that the sage’s Dao does not belong to names and words, and any attempt to conceive or discuss it becomes a flaw.

**Chapter Fourteen**

Master Guan Yin said: Be it dragon or flood dragon, serpent or tortoise, fish or clam—all these the dragon can become. The dragon as a creature rides the clouds and qi, nurtures itself in yin and yang, gathers to form shape, disperses to form pattern, its transformations unfathomable. It can be small or great: when great, it fills heaven and earth; when small, it becomes flood dragons, serpents, tortoises, fish, or clams of every kind. Thus it is said: be it dragon or flood dragon, serpent or tortoise, fish or clam—all these the dragon can become. This is a borrowed analogy.

The flood dragon is but a flood dragon—it cannot become a dragon, nor serpent, tortoise, fish, or clam. The flood dragon resembles the dragon but is not the dragon; yet it may ultimately transform into one. Before its transformation, it is merely a water beast, hence it is called *flood dragon*—nothing more. As a water beast, it cannot change its form; how then could it become dragon, serpent, tortoise, fish, or clam? Thus it is said: it cannot become a dragon, nor serpent, tortoise, fish, or clam. This too is a borrowed analogy.

The sage is like the dragon; the worthy, like the flood dragon. Water is an analogy for the Dao; the dragon, for the sage; the flood dragon, for the worthy; the serpent and tortoise, for the noble person; the fish and clam, for the common people. Dragon, flood dragon, serpent, tortoise, fish, and clam—all dwell in water, from birth to old age, inhaling and exhaling, partaking of its bounty, each lacking nothing. Yet while flood dragon, serpent, tortoise, fish, and clam all live in water, they cannot transform within it—only the dragon can. Sage, worthy, noble person, and common people all live within the Dao, from birth to old age, their daily needs all met, each lacking nothing. But while the worthy, noble person, and common people live within the Dao, they do not comprehend it—only the sage comprehends it. Thus it is said: the sage is like the dragon; the worthy, like the flood dragon. This is a combined analogy.

This chapter clarifies that the Dao resides in the sage’s subtlety, complete and without lack—others do not comprehend it, but the sage does.

Master Guan Yin said: Abiding nowhere within oneself, the forms of things manifest of themselves. In movement, it is like water; in stillness, like a mirror; in response, like an echo.

Only the true and constant abides within, hence it is said *abiding within oneself*. Not clinging to the appearance of emptiness, hence *abiding nowhere*. True emptiness is perfectly luminous, and every thing becomes manifest—thus it is said *the forms of things manifest of themselves*. *Manifest* means clearly revealed. True emptiness stands alone, unclinging to the appearance of emptiness; every particular is distinctly seen, every thing clearly revealed. In movement, it is like water, flowing yet leaving no trace; in stillness, like a bright mirror, reflecting forms without intent; in responding to things, like an echo in an empty valley, ever silent. Thus it is said: *Abiding nowhere within oneself, the forms of things manifest of themselves. In movement, it is like water; in stillness, like a mirror; in response, like an echo.*

Vague, as if vanished; silent, as if pure. The sage, having thoroughly comprehended true emptiness, has a mind like cold ashes or withered wood, seemingly devoid of vitality—thus it is said *vague, as if vanished*. *Vague* means dim and obscure, like cold ashes without light; *vanished*, like withered wood without vitality. The source of the mind is perfectly clear and still, pure as water in its tranquility—thus it is said *silent, as if pure*. *Silent* means still.

Those who harmonize are in accord; those who grasp lose. Those of keen capacity, drawn by shared qi, study under the sage. The sage subtly demonstrates to them, and they immediately comprehend, transforming from ordinary to sage—thus it is said *those who harmonize*. The former sage initiates, and the later sage responds—thus it is said *those who harmonize are in accord*. Those of dull capacity, not yet awakened to the Dao, grasp at the sage’s words and dharmic forms, believing they have gained something. With such views, they do not forget—and thus they lose by a great margin. Thus it is said: *those who grasp lose.*

Never preceding others, yet always following them. The sage, dwelling in the world, responds only when moved, compelled to establish words and dharmic forms for those of middling and lesser capacity—all expedient means. Yet the sage never first sets forth these words, for those of middling and lesser capacity become attached and deluded. Only then does the sage, according to their portion, loosen their bonds, prescribing remedies according to their ailments. Thus it is said: *Never preceding others, yet always following them.* This chapter clarifies that the sage’s movement and stillness are without intent, responding only when moved.

---

Master Guan Yin said: Vast and boundless, roaming the Great Beginning! The great Dao is undifferentiated and boundless as the ocean—this is the sage’s essence. Thus it is said: *Vast and boundless.* *Great Ease* is the state before qi is seen; *Great Beginning* is the inception of qi. When the singular qi first stirs, it is the functioning of the Dao—the sage embodies both essence and function, roaming without trace. Thus it is said: *Roaming the Great Beginning!*

Now gold, now jade; now dung, now earth. The sage, dwelling in the world, does not oppose the times. When the time is right to assist the world and govern the realm, people regard it as precious as gold—thus it is said *now gold.* When the time is right to comfort the world and pacify the realm, people regard it as noble as jade—thus it is said *now jade.* When the time is right to withdraw and live in obscurity, humble and poor, benefiting others and aiding the people, they are scorned as lowly as dung or earth—thus it is said *now dung, now earth.*

Now soaring above things, now following them. When the time is right for the sage to cultivate alone, they roam freely, like the phoenix soaring through the clouds, leaving no trace—thus it is said *now soaring above things.* When the time is right to follow the multitude, they conceal their spiritual powers—thus it is said *now following them.* *Following* means accompanying.

Now mountain-dwelling, now abiding in the depths. When the time is right, the sage may dwell in the mountains, drinking from streams, sleeping beneath the moon and clouds, concealing their brilliance and finding joy. Or they may take a solitary boat with a short oar, clad in straw raincoat and bamboo hat, wandering rivers and lakes—unfit to be the emperor’s subject, nor the feudal lord’s friend—freely roaming without constraint. Thus it is said: *Now mountain-dwelling, now abiding in the depths.*

Upright or adaptive, mad or foolish?
*Upright or adaptive* explains the earlier *now metal-aligned, now jade-aligned*—speaking of aiding and governing the world with upright principles and adaptive governance to bring peace and comfort to all under heaven. Thus it is said: *upright or adaptive.* *Mad or foolish* explains the earlier *now dung-aligned, now earth-aligned; now soaring above things, now following them; now mountain-dwelling, now abiding in the depths*—meaning that the sage sometimes acts with unrestrained self-mastery, unbound by rules, elusive in concealment or revelation, appearing mad or foolish, beyond all conjecture. Thus it is said: *mad or foolish.* This chapter clarifies how the sage adapts to the times, eluding all prediction in concealment or revelation.

**Chapter Seventeen**

Master Guan Yin says: One skilled in the zither, when moved by sorrow, produces sounds that are mournful; when lost in thought, sounds that are slow and measured; when filled with resentment, sounds that are winding and bitter; when gripped by longing, sounds that are lingering and tender. *Mournful* describes the voice of grief; *slow and measured*, the voice of contemplation; *winding and bitter*, the voice of resentment; *lingering and tender*, the voice of yearning. The heart’s intent is lodged in the zither, manifesting through its tones. When the heart harbors sorrow, the zither’s voice becomes mournful and stirring—thus it is said: *one skilled in the zither, when moved by sorrow, produces sounds that are mournful.* When the heart is lost in thought, the zither’s voice becomes slow and measured, as if pondering—thus it is said: *when lost in thought, sounds that are slow and measured.* When the heart resents another, the voice becomes winding and bitter with grievance—thus it is said: *when filled with resentment, sounds that are winding and bitter.* When the heart longs for something, the voice becomes lingering and tender with attachment—thus it is said: *when gripped by longing, sounds that are lingering and tender.*

What is called *sorrow, thought, resentment, longing* arises neither from the hands nor the bamboo, neither from the strings nor the paulownia wood. It is grasped by the heart, matched by the hands; grasped by the hands, matched by the instrument. Those who embody the Dao never miss the mark. The aforementioned *sorrow, thought, resentment, longing*—these tones of mourning, slowness, bitterness, and tenderness do not arise from the hands, bamboo, strings, or zither itself. Thus it is said: *what is called sorrow, thought, resentment, longing arises neither from the hands nor the bamboo, neither from the strings nor the paulownia wood.* When one skilled in the zither internalizes it, the heart’s intent aligns with the hands, and the hands’ movements align with the strings, bamboo, and paulownia wood. Naturally, the heart’s intent manifests through the sound. If even one skilled in the zither can thus reveal the heart’s intent through sound, how much more so the adept who awakens to the Dao! The adept’s essence and function are ever-present; whether grasping or releasing, speaking or silent, rising or resting, all is in perfect accord with the Dao. Thus it is said: *grasped by the heart, matched by the hands; grasped by the hands, matched by the instrument. Those who embody the Dao never miss the mark.* This chapter shows that in movement and stillness, speech and silence, all is the Dao.

**Chapter Eighteen**

Master Guan Yin says: The sage employs speech, action, and thought to align with others. *Speech, action, and thought* are all means of engagement. The sage’s traces of response may at times differ little from those of ordinary people—thus it is said: *the sage employs speech, action, and thought to align with others.* Yet the sage also embodies what has never been spoken, never been done, never been thought, and this sets them apart from others. *Never* means *not once*; *what has never been spoken, done, or thought* refers to the unconditioned essence prior to the arising of speech, action, or thought. The sage’s unconditioned essence is fundamentally no different from that of ordinary people, but because the many are deluded while the sage is awakened, they differ from the many. Thus it is said: *the sage embodies what has never been spoken, never been done, never been thought, and this sets them apart from others.* This chapter clarifies how the deluded share the sage’s traces but not the sage’s Dao.

**Chapter Nineteen**

Master Guan Yin says: The sharper the mind’s discernment of profit and harm, the less harmony among kin; the sharper the mind’s distinction between worthy and foolish, the fewer bonds of friendship; the sharper the mind’s judgment of right and wrong, the less success in affairs; the sharper the mind’s preference for beauty and ugliness, the less resonance with things. When the mind is fixated on discerning profit, it pursues it single-mindedly; when fixated on discerning harm, it avoids it single-mindedly. In this way, even parents and children cannot live in harmony—how much less others? Thus it is said: *the sharper the mind’s discernment of profit and harm, the less harmony among kin.* When the mind is fixated on distinguishing the worthy from the foolish, it clings to the worthy and distances the foolish. Yet if another is wiser than oneself, they will surely regard one as foolish and distance themselves in turn. Thus, even in old age, one cannot form bonds with like-minded friends. Thus it is said: *the sharper the mind’s distinction between worthy and foolish, the fewer bonds of friendship.* When the mind is fixated on judging right and wrong, it clings to right and rejects wrong, becoming ensnared by the labels of right and wrong. No matter how trivial or grand the matter, one dares not act. Thus, no affair, great or small, can be accomplished. Thus it is said: *the sharper the mind’s judgment of right and wrong, the less success in affairs.* When the mind is fixated on preferring beauty and rejecting ugliness, love and aversion cloud the heart, and one becomes obsessed with appearances. Even the bond between husband and wife cannot find resonance. Thus it is said: *the sharper the mind’s preference for beauty and ugliness, the less resonance with things.* *Sharper* means *fixated*; *things* refers to all beings.

Therefore, the sage blends them all.

Thus, *shi yi* serves as a phrase linking the preceding and following. *Hun* means the undifferentiated true heart, free from discriminations. Therefore, the sage’s true heart remains undifferentiated, free from discriminations, and thus transcends the labels of profit and harm, worthiness and folly, right and wrong, beauty and ugliness. Hence it is said: *Therefore, the sage blends them all.*

This chapter clarifies that the sage’s true heart is undifferentiated and free from discriminations.

**Chapter Twenty-One**
Master Guan Yin said: The foolish and clumsy of the world falsely invoke the sage’s foolishness and clumsiness to justify themselves. *Yuan* means *to cite*. Among the people of the world, there are those who are dull, clumsy, and slow-witted, fearing ridicule, and so they falsely invoke the sage’s traces of concealment, feigned madness, and clumsiness to explain themselves, claiming that the sage, too, possessed such foolishness and clumsiness. Hence it is said: *The foolish and clumsy of the world falsely invoke the sage’s foolishness and clumsiness to justify themselves.*

Yet they fail to realize that the sage is at times foolish, at times enlightened, at times clumsy, at times skillful. The foolish and clumsy of the world do not understand that the sage adapts to circumstances and responds to change, never bound by traces. When concealment is fitting, the sage feigns madness like a fool—this is the height of concealment. When revelation is fitting, the sage’s name shines brighter than the sun and moon. When non-action is fitting, the sage forgets ability and appears clumsy. When action is fitting, the sage employs skillful means to guide the deluded. Hence it is said: *Yet they fail to realize that the sage is at times foolish, at times enlightened, at times clumsy, at times skillful.*

This chapter clarifies that the sage’s concealment and revelation are unfathomable.

**Chapter Twenty-Two**
Master Guan Yin said: Those who model themselves on the sage with sagely wisdom are worthy persons; those who model themselves on the sage with worthy wisdom become sages. Those who, with sagely wisdom, emulate the sage’s virtue reach its utmost and become worthy persons. Hence it is said: *Those who model themselves on the sage with sagely wisdom are worthy persons.* Those who, with the heart of a worthy person, emulate the sage’s Way reach its utmost and become sages. Hence it is said: *Those who model themselves on the sage with worthy wisdom become sages.*

For those who model themselves on the sage with sagely wisdom cling to traces and forget the Way, while those who model themselves on the sage with worthy wisdom reverse traces and unite with the Way. Virtue and its application leave traces. Those who, with sagely wisdom, emulate the sage’s virtue and its application cling to the traces of its application and forget the substance of the Way. Hence it is said: *For those who model themselves on the sage with sagely wisdom cling to traces and forget the Way.* The substance of the Way is true emptiness, leaving no traces to cling to. Those who, with the heart of a worthy person, emulate the sage’s Way awaken understanding, their hearts merging with true emptiness, reversing traces to unite with the Way. Hence it is said: *Those who model themselves on the sage with worthy wisdom reverse traces and unite with the Way.*

This chapter clarifies that descending from the root to traces makes one a worthy person, while returning from traces to the root makes one a sage.

**Chapter Twenty-Three**
Master Guan Yin said: The worthy incline upward and do not see below; the common people incline downward and do not see above. The sage encompasses both above and below, acting as is fitting. The worthy understand principle—what is above form is called the Dao, and what is below form is called the instrument—and fixate solely on principle, unaware that attachment to principle is but one side. Hence it is said: *The worthy incline upward and do not see below.* The common people are benighted to principle and infatuated with affairs, unaware that attachment to affairs is also but one side. Hence it is said: *The common people incline downward and do not see above.*

*Above* refers to principle; *below* refers to affairs. The sage, penetrating true emptiness, is unbound by affairs or principle. At times, the sage teaches through principle; at other times, through affairs. Observing the moment, the sage instructs, adapting to circumstances with perfect appropriateness. Hence it is said: *The sage encompasses both above and below, acting as is fitting.*

Is it said that apart from the worthy and the common people, there exists another kind of sage? The sage is like water; the worthy and common people are like ice. Water congeals into ice when cold, and ice melts back into water when warm. Though the ice has not yet melted, one cannot say the ice is not water, for the ice is wholly water. When the sage is deluded, they become an ordinary person; when they awaken, they become a sage again. Though they have not yet awakened, one cannot say the ordinary person is not a sage, for the ordinary person is wholly the sage. How tragic for those who remain deluded!

Thus, to know water, do not depart from ice—seek it, and ice is water. To awaken to the sage’s Way, do not depart from the ordinary—investigate it, and the ordinary is the sage. Hence it is said: *Is it said that apart from the worthy and the common people, there exists another kind of sage?* *Zai* is an exclamation of deep lament for the deluded.

This chapter clarifies that the Dao resides in the sage and the ordinary person alike, equally complete, differing only in delusion and awakening.

**Chapter Twenty-Four**
Master Guan Yin said: In the principles of the world, the husband leads, and the wife follows; the male runs, and the female pursues; the rooster crows, and the hen responds. In the world, there are natural principles: yang is honored, yin is humble; yang is firm, yin is yielding; yang precedes, yin follows. Thus, the husband leads, and the wife follows in harmony. Among beasts, the male runs first, and the female pursues. Among birds, the rooster crows from the windward, and the hen responds from the leeward. Hence it is said: *In the principles of the world, the husband leads, and the wife follows; the male runs, and the female pursues; the rooster crows, and the hen responds.*

Therefore, the sage establishes words and deeds, and the worthy adhere to them. Observing the world’s natural principles of yin and yang, honor and humility, precedence and sequence, the sage establishes the words and deeds of ruler and minister, father and child, husband and wife, elder and younger, their honor and humility, precedence and sequence. The worthy of past and present dare not transgress or deviate from them, bound by these words and deeds, unable to act with freedom and ease. Hence it is said: *Therefore, the sage establishes words and deeds, and the worthy adhere to them.*

This chapter clarifies that the sage’s Way transcends norms yet sets an example for later generations.

**Chapter Twenty-Five**
Master Guan Yin said: Though the sage’s Way transforms like a tiger, in affairs, it moves like a turtle. Though the Way is as fine as silk, in affairs, it is as coarse as sackcloth.

**Chapter Twenty-Five**
The "tiger’s transformation" illustrates the awe-inspiring radiance of the sage’s Way, responding to change without fixed form. The "turtle’s movement" illustrates the sage’s handling of affairs—reluctantly and with measured delay—hence it is said: *Though the sage’s Way transforms like a tiger, in affairs, it moves like a turtle.*

The "silken threads" illustrate the sage’s Way, intricate and all-encompassing. The "sackcloth" illustrates the sage’s handling of affairs, each step grounded in principle and reason—hence it is said: *Though the Way is as fine as silk, in affairs, it is as coarse as sackcloth.*

This chapter clarifies that the sage’s Way is unfathomable, yet in action, it follows discernible patterns.

**Chapter Twenty-Six**
Master Guan Yin said: The so-called Way of the sage—how solitary it is! How perfect it is! How profound it is! How wondrous it is!

"Solitary" means without counterpart. "Perfect" means utterly good and beautiful. "Profound" means deep and unfathomable. "Wondrous" means marvel upon marvel. "How" asks: *In what way?*

The Way of the sage—how solitary it stands, transcending all dualities! Hence it is said: *The so-called Way of the sage—how solitary it is!*

The Way of the sage—how perfect in its utter goodness and beauty! How profound in its unfathomable depth! How wondrous in its boundless marvels, beyond all praise! Hence it is said: *How perfect it is! How profound it is! How wondrous it is!*

Only because it pervades and pairs with the myriad things, yet no single thing can pair with it, does it hold all things in honor.

"Pair" means to depend upon. Only the Way, being without self, gives birth to the myriad things yet remains undifferentiated from them. All things depend upon the Way to exist, yet the Way depends upon nothing. Thus it transcends and honors all things. Hence it is said: *Only because it pervades and pairs with the myriad things, yet no single thing can pair with it, does it hold all things in honor.*

"No single thing can pair with it" means no single thing can compare to the Way.

This chapter clarifies that the Way transcends all existence, utterly beyond all dualities.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven**
Master Guan Yin said: The curling and unfurling of clouds, the flight of birds—all occur within the empty void, and thus their transformations are inexhaustible.

Clouds arise when the qi of earth and water ascends and coalesces. Within the empty void, they curl or unfurl, gathering and dispersing, coming and going without trace.

Birds, born of yang qi, soar through the empty void, north or south, east or west, wherever their will inclines. Their comings and goings, their free movement—no trace can be found.

Clouds and birds alike dwell within the empty void, curling and unfurling, flying and soaring, their transformations endless. Hence it is said: *The curling and unfurling of clouds, the flight of birds—all occur within the empty void, and thus their transformations are inexhaustible.*

This is a metaphor.

So too is the sage’s Way.

The sage’s Way, penetrating the true emptiness and wondrous existence, embodies both substance and function with perfect equanimity. Responding to change without fixed form, it is like the curling and unfurling of clouds, the flight of birds—free and boundless in its transformations, without end, yet leaving no trace to follow. Hence it is said: *So too is the sage’s Way.*

This chapter clarifies that the sage’s Way is inexhaustible in its transformations, now hidden, now manifest, beyond all reckoning.

*Divine Peak’s Free and Easy Master Niu Daochun’s Direct Explication*

**Chapter on the Four Symbols**

The *Symbols* refer to essence, spirit, soul, and spirit—comprising seventeen sections in all.

Master Guan Yin said: *"Water may be divided or united. Essence has no person."*
Among the Five Phases, water divides into the myriad waters yet unites as one water, manifesting without reliance on other things—thus we know water has no person. In the human body, water pertains to the kidney’s stored essence; hence, essence has no person. Therefore it is said: *"Water may be divided or united; essence has no person."*

*"Fire depends on oil or fuel. Spirit has no self."*
Among the Five Phases, fire arises from lamp oil, wicks, or burning wood, revealing its form. Without oil or fuel, fire cannot manifest alone—thus we know fire has no self. In the human body, fire pertains to the heart’s stored spirit; hence, spirit has no self. Therefore it is said: *"Fire depends on oil or fuel; spirit has no self."*

Thus:
*"The ear, though obstructed, hears before and behind—no person."*
*"Wisdom, lofty—no person."*
*"The singular, odd—no person."*
*"Winter withers autumn’s things—no person."*
*"Black cannot be altered—no person."*
*"The North endures—no person."*
All these pertain to essence.

Since water has no person, wherever it resides, there is no person. In the viscera, water is the kidney; in form, it is the ear—the ear being the kidney’s external manifestation. Though obstructed, it hears sounds before and behind; as the ear belongs to water, it too has no person. Hence: *"The ear, though obstructed, hears before and behind—no person."*

Among the Five Constants, water corresponds to wisdom. Wisdom’s solitary eminence is called *loftiness*. As wisdom belongs to water, it has no person. Hence: *"Wisdom, lofty—no person."*

In numbers, water is one—the singular, odd number, water’s generative number. As one belongs to water, it too has no person. Hence: *"The singular, odd—no person."*

In seasons, water is winter. Winter’s severity withers autumn’s grasses and trees. As winter belongs to water, it too has no person. Hence: *"Winter withers autumn’s things—no person."*

In colors, water is black. Black cannot be changed into another color. As black belongs to water, it too has no person. Hence: *"Black cannot be altered—no person."*

In directions, water is the North. Water’s longevity never dries up; thus we know those who preserve essence live long. As the North belongs to water, it too has no person. Hence: *"The North endures—no person."*

The above six—ear, wisdom, singular, winter, black, and North—all pertain to water. Among the Five Spirits, water governs essence; hence it is said: *"All these are essence."*

*"The tongue, with teeth, forms speech—no self."*
*"Ritual, humble—no self."*
*"The dual, even—no self."*
*"Summer relies on spring’s things—no self."*
*"Red can be altered—no self."*
*"The South is short-lived—no self."*
All these pertain to spirit.

Since fire has no self, wherever it resides, there is no self. In the viscera, fire is the heart; in form, it is the tongue—the tongue being the heart’s external manifestation. The tongue alone cannot speak; speech arises through the teeth. As the tongue belongs to fire, it too has no self. Hence: *"The tongue, with teeth, forms speech—no self."*

Among the Five Constants, fire corresponds to ritual. Ritual’s foundation is humility. As ritual belongs to fire, it too has no self. Hence: *"Ritual, humble—no self."*

In numbers, fire is two—the dual, even number, fire’s generative number. As two belongs to fire, it too has no self. Hence: *"The dual, even—no self."*

In seasons, fire is summer. Summer relies on spring’s grasses and trees to grow them. As summer belongs to fire, it too has no self. Hence: *"Summer relies on spring’s things—no self."*

In colors, fire is red. Red can be altered into another color. As red belongs to fire, it too has no self. Hence: *"Red can be altered—no self."*

In directions, fire is the South. Fire is easily extinguished, hence short-lived; thus we know those who indulge in true fire die young. As the South belongs to fire, it too has no self. Hence: *"The South is short-lived—no self."*

The above six—tongue, ritual, dual, summer, red, and South—all pertain to fire. Among the Five Spirits, fire governs spirit; hence it is said: *"All these are spirit."*

*"As essence has no person, when rice is husked from grain, essence remains."*
Among the Five Spirits, water governs essence. Since water has no person, essence too has no person. As essence has no person, it is like grain husked to reveal pure rice—this is the image of no-person. Hence: *"As essence has no person, when rice is husked from grain, essence remains."*

*"As spirit has no self, when ghosts rely on things, spirit manifests."*
Among the Five Spirits, fire governs spirit. Since fire has no self, spirit too has no self. As spirit has no self, it is like ghosts relying on people or objects to reveal their numinous power—this is the image of no-self. Hence: *"As spirit has no self, when ghosts rely on things, spirit manifests."*

*"Those who preserve essence forget right and wrong, forget gain and loss. What is here is not there."*
One who preserves perfect essence stands alone, unpaired with the myriad dharmas, forgetting good and evil, honor and disgrace, gain and loss. Standing alone, apart from the myriad dharmas, essence exists here, independent of other things. Hence: *"Those who preserve essence forget right and wrong, forget gain and loss. What is here is not there."*

*"Those who embrace spirit alternate between obscurity and clarity, strength and weakness. What is there is not here."*
One who embraces perfect spirit, selfless and obscure, adapts to the times. When obscurity is fitting, they withdraw and cultivate alone; when clarity is fitting, they emerge to benefit the world. When strength and unceasing effort are fitting, they practice virtue and persevere; when humility and softness are fitting, they restrain themselves. Obscurity and clarity, strength and weakness depend on the times, not on this spirit. As spirit has no self, hence: *"Those who embrace spirit alternate between obscurity and clarity, strength and weakness. What is here is not there."*

This chapter clarifies that those who preserve essence and spirit have no self or person.

**End of Chapter One**

Master Guan Yin said: Spirit and essence are water and fire, mutually generated and extinguished by the Five Phases. Their coming has no beginning, their going has no end.

Essence pertains to water, spirit pertains to fire—thus spirit and essence are water and fire. Water generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal, metal generates water; water extinguishes fire, fire extinguishes metal, metal extinguishes wood, wood extinguishes earth, earth extinguishes water—thus it is said the Five Phases mutually generate and extinguish one another. In the first and second months, wood flourishes; in the third month, wood flourishes for twelve days, earth for eighteen days. In the fourth and fifth months, fire flourishes; in the sixth month, fire flourishes for twelve days, earth for eighteen days. In the seventh and eighth months, metal flourishes; in the ninth month, metal flourishes for twelve days, earth for eighteen days. In the tenth and eleventh months, water flourishes; in the twelfth month, water flourishes for twelve days, earth for eighteen days. The four seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter cycle endlessly, their beginning and end traceable—thus it is said their coming has no beginning, their going has no end.

Then my essence, a single drop, neither exists nor perishes. Essence pertains to water—hence it is called a single drop. The Way of my perfect essence does not pertain to existence or nonexistence, presence or absence—thus it is said: *Then my essence, a single drop, neither exists nor perishes.*

My spirit, a single spark, neither arises nor ceases. Spirit pertains to fire—hence it is called a single spark. My perfect spirit, in that single spark, is neither born nor destroyed. Arising is birth—thus it is said: *My spirit, a single spark, neither arises nor ceases.*

Only with no self, no person, no beginning, no end does one merge with heaven and earth. As stated above: spirit has no self, essence has no person; the Five Phases mutually generate and extinguish them, their coming has no beginning, their going has no end. Thus we know there is no self or person. Beginning and end are what unite with heaven and earth in the profound and obscure Way—thus it is said: *Only with no self, no person, no beginning, no end does one merge with heaven and earth.*

This chapter clarifies that spirit and essence have no self or person, and together with heaven and earth, arise from the Dao.

**End of Chapter Two**

Master Guan Yin said: Essence is water, po is metal, spirit is fire, hun is wood. Among the five spirits, water is essence—thus it is said *essence is water.* Among the five spirits, metal is po—thus it is said *po is metal.* Among the five spirits, fire is spirit—thus it is said *spirit is fire.* Among the five spirits, wood is hun—thus it is said *hun is wood.*

Essence governs water, po governs metal; metal generates water—thus essence is stored within po. Essence pertains to water, po pertains to metal; metal is the mother of water, metal generates water. From this we know po conceals essence—thus it is said: *Essence governs water, po governs metal; metal generates water—thus essence is stored within po.*

Spirit governs fire, hun governs wood; wood generates fire—thus spirit is stored within hun. Spirit pertains to fire, hun pertains to wood; wood is the mother of fire, wood generates fire. From this we know hun conceals spirit—thus it is said: *Spirit governs fire, hun governs wood; wood generates fire—thus spirit is stored within hun.*

Only water as an element can conceal metal and still it, can nourish wood and make it flourish—thus it separates hun and po. The Xixuan edition includes these four lines, which seem to follow the flow of the text without disrupting its order—thus they are also explained here. When metal is placed in water, it hides and becomes still; when wood receives water, it is nourished and flourishes. Since essence pertains to water, po to metal, and hun to wood, and water conceals metal, we know essence can separate hun and po—thus it is said: *Only water as an element can conceal metal and still it, can nourish wood and make it flourish—thus it separates hun and po.*

Only fire as an element can melt metal and dissolve it, can burn wood and consume it—thus it unites hun and po. Fire can melt and dissolve metal, and can also burn and consume wood. Since spirit pertains to fire, po to metal, and hun to wood, and fire can dissolve metal and burn wood, we know spirit can unite hun and po—thus it is said: *Only fire as an element can melt metal and dissolve it, can burn wood and consume it—thus it unites hun and po.*

Only essence, in heaven, is cold; on earth, is water; in humans, is essence. Essence pertains to water; when water is in heaven, it becomes winter’s cold; when water is in earthly form, it is the water of the Five Phases; when water is among the five spirits of humans, it is essence—thus it is said: *Only essence, in heaven, is cold; on earth, is water; in humans, is essence.*

Spirit, in heaven, is heat; on earth, is fire; in humans, is spirit. Spirit pertains to fire; when in heaven, it becomes summer’s heat; when in earthly form, it is the fire of the Five Phases; among the five spirits of humans, it is spirit—thus it is said: *Spirit, in heaven, is heat; on earth, is fire; in humans, is spirit.*

Po, in heaven, is dryness; on earth, is metal; in humans, is po. Po pertains to metal; in heavenly qi, it becomes scorching dryness; in earthly form, it is the metal of the Five Phases; among the five spirits of humans, it is po—thus it is said: *Po, in heaven, is dryness; on earth, is metal; in humans, is po.*

Hun, in heaven, is wind; on earth, is wood; in humans, is hun. Hun pertains to wood; in heavenly qi, it becomes wind; in earthly form, it is the wood of the Five Phases; among the five spirits of humans, it is hun—thus it is said: *Hun, in heaven, is wind; on earth, is wood; in humans, is hun.*

Only by uniting my essence with the essence of heaven, earth, and the myriad things—just as the myriad waters can merge into one water. Using the analogy of myriad waters merging into one water, we know my essence can unite with the essence of heaven, earth, and the myriad things into one essence—thus it is said: *Only by uniting my essence with the essence of heaven, earth, and the myriad things—just as the myriad waters can merge into one water.*

Just as my spirit can unite with the spirit of heaven, earth, and the myriad things—just as the myriad fires can merge into one fire. Using the analogy of myriad fires merging into one fire, we know my spirit can unite with the spirit of heaven, earth, and the myriad things into one spirit—thus it is said: *Just as my spirit can unite with the spirit of heaven, earth, and the myriad things—just as the myriad fires can merge into one fire.*

Just as my po can unite with the po of heaven, earth, and the myriad things—just as metal, as a substance, can fuse different metals into one. Using the analogy of different metals fusing into one, we know my po can unite with the po of heaven, earth, and the myriad things into one po—thus it is said: *Just as my po can unite with the po of heaven, earth, and the myriad things—just as metal, as a substance, can fuse different metals into one.*

Just as my hun can unite with the hun of heaven, earth, and the myriad things—just as wood, as a substance, can graft different woods to grow into one. Using the analogy of different woods grafting into one, we know my hun can unite with the hun of heaven, earth, and the myriad things into one hun—thus it is said: *Just as my hun can unite with the hun of heaven, earth, and the myriad things—just as wood, as a substance, can graft different woods to grow into one.*

Then heaven, earth, and the myriad things are all my essence, my spirit, my po, my hun—what dies, and what lives? As stated above, the essence, spirit, po, and hun of heaven, earth, and the myriad things all arise together from the Dao. Since they arise together from the Dao, how could the Dao have life and death? Thus it is said: *Then heaven, earth, and the myriad things are all my essence, my spirit, my po, my hun—what dies, and what lives?* This chapter clarifies that heaven and earth are born together with me, and the myriad things and I are one—one born from the Dao, and the Dao has no life or death.

**Chapter Three**

Guan Yinzi said: The movement of the Five Phases arises from essence giving rise to hun, hun giving rise to spirit, spirit giving rise to intent, intent giving rise to po, and po giving rise to essence. The Five Phases—metal, wood, water, fire, and earth—revolve and mutually generate one another.

Essence pertains to water; hun pertains to wood. Water generates wood—thus it is said: *The movement of the Five Phases arises from essence giving rise to hun.* Spirit pertains to fire; wood generates fire—thus it is said: *from hun giving rise to spirit.* Intent pertains to earth; fire generates earth—thus it is said: *from spirit giving rise to intent.* Po pertains to metal; earth generates metal—thus it is said: *from intent giving rise to po.* Essence pertains to water; metal generates water—thus it is said: *from po giving rise to essence.* These five revolve endlessly. Essence, spirit, hun, po, and intent generate one another in an unceasing cycle. *Yi* means to cease—thus it is said: *these five revolve endlessly.* The sequence of generation is: essence generates hun, hun generates spirit, spirit generates intent, intent generates po, and po generates essence, which in turn generates hun.

If the human heart’s spirit does not arise, then intent does not arise—without fire, there is no earth. If intent does not arise, then po does not arise—without earth, there is no metal. If po does not arise, then essence does not arise—without metal, there is no water. If essence does not arise, then hun does not arise—without water, there is no wood. If hun does not arise, then spirit does not arise—without wood, there is no fire. From this, we know that if the heart does not arise, all five cease—this is the swift path out of the cycle of rebirth.

Thus, my false heart has flowed through the transformations of creation for countless eons without end. The false heart is karmic consciousness; all sentient beings’ karmic consciousness rushes about without foundation, drifting through life and death, entering and exiting the hub, through the four births and six destinies, their bones piled like mountains, revolving for countless eons without end or escape. The great sage, in compassion, expounded this scripture for this reason—thus it is said: *Thus, my false heart has flowed through the transformations of creation for countless eons without end.* *Zaohua* means life and death; *I* refers to all sentient beings.

Yet, from a single kernel, countless trees arise. Though heaven and earth are vast, they cannot sprout a kernel suspended in empty space. Fruit-bearing trees, when their kernels are buried in soil, sprout and grow into trees, which then bear fruit and produce kernels. These kernels, when buried again, sprout and grow into trees, bearing fruit and kernels once more. Thus, they generate one another endlessly, producing countless trees—thus it is said: *Yet, from a single kernel, countless trees arise.* This analogy illustrates that if the heart contains consciousness, the false heart flows through the transformations of creation for countless eons without end. But if a fruit kernel is tied with a string and suspended in empty space, though heaven and earth are vast, how could it sprout? Thus it is said: *Though heaven and earth are vast, they cannot sprout a kernel suspended in empty space.* This analogy illustrates that if the heart unites with true emptiness, the transformations of creation cannot cause it to revolve.

From a single hen’s egg, countless birds arise. Though yin and yang are wondrous, they cannot hatch an egg from a hen without a rooster. A hen, after mating with a rooster, lays an egg; the hen broods over the egg and hatches a chick. When the chick grows, it too has hens and roosters that mate and lay eggs, generating one another endlessly to produce countless birds—thus it is said: *From a single hen’s egg, countless birds arise.* This analogy illustrates that if the heart turns away from awakening and unites with dust, life and death continue without end. But if a hen does not mate with a rooster, though yin and yang are wondrous, how could it lay an egg? Thus it is said: *Though yin and yang are wondrous, they cannot hatch an egg from a hen without a rooster.* This analogy illustrates that if the heart does not unite with dust, there is no life or death.

Only when all that comes to me is gathered in a single breath—then things are transformed into me, and there is nothing that is not me. As for the so-called Five Phases, who can transform them?

The self is the heart. The heart is originally heartless—only when external objects and realms come to disturb it does the heart suddenly appear in a single breath. From this we know that objects are the heart itself. Thus it is said: *Only when all that comes to me is gathered in a single breath are things transformed into me.* If no external objects come to disturb, the heart does not appear. When the heart does not appear, this is true emptiness. How could the Five Phases transform true emptiness? Since they cannot transform true emptiness, there is no cycle of life and death. Thus it is said: *There is nothing that is not me; as for the so-called Five Phases, who can transform them?* Therefore it is said: *Seeing objects, one sees the heart; without objects, the heart is not seen.* In the ten directions, whether open or obstructed, the true heart pervades all—this is precisely what is meant.

This chapter clarifies that the moment a single thought arises, one falls into the Five Phases and the cycle of rebirth continues without end. When not a single thought arises, there is true emptiness, and yin and yang cannot mold or shape it.

**Chapter Four**
Guan Yinzi said: The multitude are those who use the *po* to restrain the *hun*. When metal is in excess, wood is insufficient. The *po* is yin—deluded thoughts, attachment to worldly desires, and the myriad evils. The *hun* is yang—purity, stillness, and the myriad virtues. The multitude, foolish and inverted, cling to deluded thoughts, outwardly commit evils, inwardly covet sensual pleasures, deplete their hidden virtue externally, and exhaust their primordial yang internally. When the yang *hun* is spent, the yin *po* alone grows strong. Seized by evil habits, they sink into the yin realms at death, like water flowing downward—this is the nature of yin descending. Since the yin *po* alone is strong, and the *po* belongs to metal, metal is in excess. Since the yang *hun* is spent, and the *hun* belongs to wood, wood is insufficient. *She* means to restrain—to use the strong *po* to subdue the weak *hun*. Thus it is said: *The multitude use the po to restrain the hun; when metal is in excess, wood is insufficient.*

The sage uses the *hun* to move the *po*—when wood is in excess, metal is insufficient. *Yun* means to circulate. When the sage first cultivates the Dao, the heart awakens to clarity, pure and unstained. Outwardly, they practice the myriad virtues without clinging to the traces of good deeds; inwardly, they preserve primordial yang without dwelling in emptiness, transcending all extremes. Pure yang flows and abides, the yang *hun* transforms, and the yin *po* dissolves into stillness. When merit is complete, the form is shed, and they ascend to the yang realms—thus they become sages. Like fire rising upward, this is the nature of yang ascending. Since the yang *hun* transforms, and the *hun* belongs to wood, wood is in excess. Since the yin *po* dissolves into stillness, and the *po* belongs to metal, metal is insufficient.

When the *po* conceals itself, the *hun* follows; when the *hun* wanders, the *po* accompanies it. The *po* belongs to yin, and yin governs stillness—stillness means concealment. When the *po* hides at night, the *hun* also follows it into concealment. Thus it is said: *When the po conceals itself, the hun follows.* *Gai* means "in general, it is so." The *hun* belongs to yang, and yang governs movement—movement means wandering. When the *hun* wanders by day, the *po* follows it in wandering. Thus it is said: *When the hun wanders, the po accompanies it.*

By day, the *hun* lodges in the eyes; by night, the *po* rests in the liver. Lodging in the eyes enables sight; resting in the liver enables dreams. The *hun* is the spirit of the liver, and the eyes are the liver’s outward manifestation—thus the *hun* lodging in the eyes by day is beyond doubt. The *po* is the spirit of the lungs, and the nose is the lungs’ outward manifestation. It should follow that the *po* rests in the lungs by night, but the text states that the *po* rests in the liver by night, which contradicts reason and is likely a scribal error. Though we may force an interpretation by following "rests in the liver," it remains strained. It would be more fitting to say: By day, the *hun* wanders and lodges in the eyes, and the *po* follows it in lodging there as well. By night, the *po* conceals itself in the lungs, and the *hun* follows it in concealment. This reasoning is sound. To say that by day the *hun* wanders and lodges in the eyes, and the *po* follows it in lodging there, while by night the *po* conceals itself in the liver, and the *hun* follows it in concealment, is even more forced—since the liver is the *hun*’s original abode, it should not be said to "follow." When the *hun* wanders and lodges in the eyes by day, it can perceive all forms and appearances, which are discerned by the *hun*’s consciousness. Thus it is said: *By day, the hun lodges in the eyes; lodging in the eyes enables sight.* When the *po* conceals itself in the lungs by night, it produces all dream realms, which are the creations of the *shi-po*’s deluded thoughts and inverted perceptions. Thus it is said: *By night, the po rests in the lungs; resting in the lungs enables dreams.*

What sees is the *hun*, undiscerning; what analyzes is discernment. To analyze and call it "heaven and earth" is the *hun*’s habitual clinging. *Ju* means familiarity. By day, the *hun* wanders and lodges in the eyes, perceiving all forms and appearances, which are discerned by the *hun*. Thus it is said: *What sees is the hun.* When the *hun* first lodges in the eyes, it is originally undiscerning—thus it is said to be *undiscerning*. Suddenly, the faculty of discernment arises—thus it is said: *What analyzes is discernment.* Once discernment arises, it knows what is above as "heaven" and what is below as "earth." Thus it is said: *To analyze and call it "heaven and earth."* Having discerned heaven and earth, the *hun*’s consciousness becomes habitually stained by familiarity, like the moon’s reflection entering the rhinoceros’s horn—though the moon’s form fills the horn, the rhinoceros cannot rid its horn of the moon’s image. The staining of consciousness by heaven, earth, and the myriad things is likewise—this is the cause of the cycle of rebirth, from which one cannot escape for kalpas. Thus it is said: *The hun’s habitual clinging.*

What dreams is the *po*, undiscerning; what analyzes is discernment. To analyze and call it "self and other" is the *po*’s habitual clinging. By night, the *po* conceals itself in the lungs and produces all dreams—thus it is said: *What dreams is the po.* When the *po* first conceals itself in the lungs, it is originally undiscerning, but when the faculty of discernment arises, it analyzes and calls it "that person" and "this self"—all of which is the *po*’s consciousness habitually clinging, deluded dreaming, and mistaking the false for the real. Thus it is said: *Undiscerning; what analyzes is discernment. To analyze and call it "self and other" is the po’s habitual clinging.*

Fire generates earth, thus spirit generates intent. (The *Guozi Qian* edition includes these seven characters, which harmonize smoothly with the scriptural phrasing, and so they are adopted here for explication.) Spirit pertains to fire; intent pertains to earth. Fire generates earth, thus spirit generates intent—hence it is said: *Fire generates earth, spirit generates intent.*

Earth generates metal, thus intent generates the *po*. Intent pertains to earth; the *po* pertains to metal. Thus intent generates the *po*—hence it is said: *Earth generates metal, thus intent generates the po.*

When spirit moves, it is no longer called spirit but intent. When intent moves, it is no longer called intent but the *po*. "Movement" means generation. What spirit generates can no longer be named spirit but is called intent. Spirit pertains to fire; intent pertains to earth. Fire generates earth, and thus when spirit generates, it is named intent—hence it is said: *When spirit moves, it is no longer called spirit but intent.* What intent generates can no longer be named intent but is called the *po*. The *po* pertains to metal; earth generates metal, and thus when intent generates, it is named the *po*—hence it is said: *When intent moves, it is no longer called intent but the po.*

Only the sage knows that the self is no-self and that phenomena are no-phenomena, all of which arise from discriminative thought and calculation. The sage awakens to true emptiness, originally devoid of self. "True emptiness" means thought has not yet arisen. When thought has not yet arisen, inwardly one does not know the self, and outwardly one does not know phenomena. "Knows" means awakens. The sage awakens to true emptiness, originally devoid of self and phenomena. Now, the calculation of self and phenomena arises entirely from deluded thought—hence it is said: *Only the sage knows that the self is no-self and that phenomena are no-phenomena, all of which arise from discriminative thought and calculation.*

Therefore, when the myriad things arise, I respond to them with nature, not with the heart-mind. "Nature" means the heart-mind has not yet arisen. "Therefore" is a phrase connecting the preceding and following. Because ordinary people, through discriminative thought, falsely calculate the myriad things as self and other, when the myriad things arise, I merely respond with nature. "Nature" is true emptiness; true emptiness responds to things with constant stillness—hence it is said: *Therefore, when the myriad things arise, I respond to them with nature.* Why respond with nature and not with the heart-mind? The answer: "Nature" is the heart-mind before it arises. The heart-mind before it arises is the nature of true emptiness—hence it is said: *Not with the heart-mind; nature is the heart-mind before it arises.*

Without the heart-mind, there is no intent—for without fire, there is no earth. Without intent, there is no *po*—for without earth, there is no metal. The heart-mind pertains to fire; intent pertains to earth. Without fire, earth is not generated—hence it is said: *Without the heart-mind, there is no intent—for without fire, there is no earth.* Intent pertains to earth; the *po* pertains to metal. Without earth, metal is not generated—hence it is said: *Without intent, there is no po—for without earth, there is no metal.*

If the one is not preserved, the five are all abolished. The "one" is the heart-mind. If the one heart-mind does not arise, then the five—spirit, intent, *po*, essence, and *hun*—are all abolished and no longer generate one another—hence it is said: *If the one is not preserved, the five are all abolished.*

Having already merged the myriad things of heaven and earth into the *hun*, one can then merge the myriad things of heaven and earth into the *po*. "Having already" refers to the preceding chapter’s discussion of uniting one’s *hun* with the *hun* of heaven and earth. Having already merged one’s *hun* with the *hun* of heaven and earth, one can then merge one’s *po* with the *po* of heaven and earth—hence it is said: *Having already merged the myriad things of heaven and earth into the hun, one can then merge the myriad things of heaven and earth into the po.*

All that the creative transformation subtly manifests is my *hun*; all that the creative transformation possesses is my *po*—thus there is not a single thing that can enslave me. As stated above, my *hun* and *po* merge with the *hun* and *po* of heaven and earth. From this, one knows that whatever the creative transformation subtly manifests or possesses is my *hun* and *po*—hence it is said: *All that the creative transformation subtly manifests is my hun; all that the creative transformation possesses is my po.* "Creative transformation" means the creator. Having roamed with the creator, one can command the myriad things, and not a single thing can command me. The scripture says: *The Way alone can create the myriad things, yet there is not a single thing that can create the Way or harm it*—this is analogous. Hence it is said: *Thus there is not a single thing that can enslave me.*

This chapter clarifies that when the one heart-mind arises, the five spirits falsely generate without cease. When the one heart-mind does not arise, the five spirits return to their origin, and one can roam with the creator.

**Chapter Five**
Guan Yinzi says: "Ghost with *yun* is *hun*; ghost with *bai* is *po*—this is so in terms of script." The character *hun* is composed of *gui* (ghost) and *yun* (cloud); the character *po* is composed of *gui* (ghost) and *bai* (white)—hence it is said: *Ghost with yun is hun; ghost with bai is po—this is so in terms of script.*

A ghost is what a person transforms into after death. If a fraction of yin is not exhausted, one cannot become an immortal; if a fraction of yang is not exhausted, one cannot become a ghost. From this, one knows that when a person’s original yang is entirely depleted, even if they have not died, they are as good as dead. A person is a ghost wearing a husk; a ghost is a person who has shed their husk. It is deluded, pernicious habits that, after death, sink one into the yin realm and transform one into a ghost—hence it is said: *A ghost is what a person transforms into after death.*

*Yun* (cloud) is wind; wind is wood. *Bai* (white) is *qi*; *qi* is metal. Yang *qi* becomes clouds. When clouds rise without yin to meet them, they transform into wind. Wind pertains to *xun* (the trigram); *xun* pertains to wood—hence it is said: *Yun is wind; wind is wood.* The color white pertains to metal; metal *qi* transforms into the color white—hence it is said: *Bai is qi; qi is metal.*

Wind disperses, thus it is light and pure; what is light and pure ascends to heaven. Metal is hard, thus it is heavy and turbid; what is heavy and turbid descends into the earth. Wind pertains to yang and can disperse the myriad things, thus it is light and pure. Since wind pertains to yang and is light and pure, it naturally ascends to heaven—hence it is said: *Wind disperses, thus it is light and pure; what is light and pure ascends to heaven.*

Metal’s form pertains to yin, thus it is hard and heavy-turbid. Since metal’s form pertains to yin, being hard and heavy-turbid, it naturally sinks into the earth—hence it is said: *Metal is hard, thus heavy-turbid; what is heavy-turbid descends into the earth.*

What is light and pure: the *po* ascends following the *hun*. What is heavy and turbid: the *hun* descends following the *po*. When one cultivates all virtues, one pertains to yang; at death, the blessings of goodness sustain them, so their *qi* is light and pure, and the *po* naturally ascends with the *hun* into the yang realm—this, too, is a matter of natural correspondence. Hence it is said: *What is light and pure: the po ascends following the hun.*

When one commits all evils, one pertains to yin; at death, the karmic weight of wickedness seizes them, so their *qi* is heavy and turbid, and the *hun* naturally descends with the *po*, sinking into the yin realm—this, too, is a matter of natural correspondence. Hence it is said: *What is heavy and turbid: the hun descends following the po.*

Those who ascend through benevolence become assistants to Jupiter; those who ascend through righteousness become assistants to Venus; those who ascend through propriety become assistants to Mars; those who ascend through wisdom become assistants to Mercury; those who ascend through sincerity become assistants to Saturn.

One who devotes themselves entirely to benevolence and perfects its practice, at death ascends to become an assistant to Jupiter, the Year Star—for benevolence pertains to wood. This, too, follows naturally from its kind. Hence it is said: *Those who ascend through benevolence become assistants to Jupiter.*

One who devotes themselves entirely to righteousness and rightly orders all things, perfecting its practice, at death ascends to become an assistant to Venus, the Great White Star—for righteousness pertains to metal. Hence it is said: *Those who ascend through righteousness become assistants to Venus.*

One who devotes themselves entirely to propriety and honors ruler and father, perfecting its practice, at death ascends to become an assistant to Mars, the Sparkling Deluder—for propriety pertains to fire. Hence it is said: *Those who ascend through propriety become assistants to Mars.*

One who devotes themselves entirely to wisdom, discerning truth from falsehood and right from wrong, following truth and rejecting falsehood, perfecting its practice, at death ascends to become an assistant to Mercury, the Culminating Star—for wisdom pertains to water. Hence it is said: *Those who ascend through wisdom become assistants to Mercury.*

One who devotes themselves entirely to sincerity, aligning word with deed, perfecting its practice, at death ascends to become an assistant to Saturn, the Quelling Star—for sincerity pertains to earth. Hence it is said: *Those who ascend through sincerity become assistants to Saturn.*

Those who sink through lack of benevolence are punished by wood; those who sink through lack of righteousness are punished by metal; those who sink through lack of propriety are punished by fire; those who sink through lack of wisdom are punished by water; those who sink through lack of sincerity are punished by earth.

One who practices no benevolence, monopolizing all evils and perfecting their practice, at death sinks into the yin realm, where the Eastern Marchmount seizes and punishes them—for the Eastern Marchmount pertains to wood. If they are seized and punished, how is this not the predation of wood? Hence it is said: *Those who sink through lack of benevolence are punished by wood.*

One who devotes themselves entirely to unrighteousness, inverting all things and defying principle, perfecting their practice, at death sinks into the yin realm, where the Western Marchmount seizes and punishes them—for the Western Marchmount pertains to metal. Hence it is said: *Those who sink through lack of righteousness are punished by metal.*

One who devotes themselves entirely to impropriety, insulting ruler and father, disloyal and unfilial, perfecting their practice, at death sinks into the yin realm, where the Southern Marchmount seizes and punishes them—for the Southern Marchmount pertains to fire. Hence it is said: *Those who sink through lack of propriety are punished by fire.*

One who devotes themselves entirely to folly, deluded and obstructed, unable to discern truth from falsehood or right from wrong, inverting all things, at death sinks into the yin realm, where the Northern Marchmount seizes and punishes them—for the Northern Marchmount pertains to water. Hence it is said: *Those who sink through lack of wisdom are punished by water.*

One who devotes themselves entirely to insincerity, believing all deceitful words and lies, aligning neither word nor deed, their deceit and falsehood excessive, at death sinks into the yin realm, where the Central Marchmount seizes and punishes them—for the Central Marchmount pertains to earth. Hence it is said: *Those who sink through lack of sincerity are punished by earth.*

Those who perfect the virtues of the Five Constants become assistants to the Five Stars; those who betray the virtues of the Five Constants are, in turn, preyed upon by the Five Phases. How can one not be cautious!

When *hun* and *po* are evenly matched, one remains among humans.
One who practices both good and evil in equal measure has blessings and sins balanced: goodness pertains to the yang *hun*, evil to the yin *po*. Thus, they neither ascend to the yang realm nor sink into the yin realm, but remain among humans, revolving through birth and death. Hence it is said: *When hun and po are evenly matched, one remains among humans.*

The ascending *hun* brings nobility; the descending *po* brings baseness. The numinous *hun* brings worthiness; the malevolent *po* brings foolishness. The light *hun* brings brightness; the heavy *po* brings darkness.

If one performed many good deeds in a past life, the ascending *hun* brings wealth and nobility in this life. Hence it is said: *The ascending hun brings nobility.*

If one performed many evil deeds in a past life, the descending *po* brings poverty and baseness in this life. Hence it is said: *The descending po brings baseness.*

If one possessed wisdom and understood principle in a past life, the numinous *hun* brings worthiness in this life. Hence it is said: *The numinous hun brings worthiness.*

If one lacked wisdom in a past life, being foolish, obstinate, and violent, the malevolent *po* brings foolishness in this life. Hence it is said: *The malevolent po brings foolishness.*

If one cultivated wisdom and goodness in a past life, the light *hun* brings intelligence in this life. Hence it is said: *The light hun brings brightness.*

If one lacked wisdom and practiced evil in a past life, the heavy *po* brings dullness and darkness in this life. Hence it is said: *The heavy po brings darkness.*

The yang *hun* becomes winged creatures; the dull *po* becomes furred creatures. The luminous *hun* becomes spirits; the obscure *po* becomes ghosts.

If one was frivolous and committed evil in this life, at death the yang *hun* becomes a creature with wings. Hence it is said: *The yang hun becomes winged creatures.*

If one was dull and committed evil in this life, at death the dull *po* becomes a creature with fur. Hence it is said: *The dull po becomes furred creatures.*

If one was intelligent, upright, detested evil, and delighted in goodness in this life, at death the luminous *hun* becomes a spirit. Hence it is said: *The luminous hun becomes spirits.*

If one favored darkness, practiced deceit and theft, and committed all manner of evil in this life, at death the obscure *po* becomes a ghost. Hence it is said: *The obscure po becomes ghosts.*

Their forms and dwellings, their perceptions and preferences—all are bound to the Five Phases. Whether noble or base, wise or foolish, luminous or obscure, winged or furred, spirits or ghosts, though their shapes and abodes differ, all arise from the karmic seeds of their perceptions and desires, each reaping its corresponding fruit. Those who cultivate the Five Constants as their cause receive the fruit of becoming the five celestial ministers; those who violate the Five Constants receive the fruit of being judged by the Five Peaks. Hence it is said: *Their forms and dwellings, their perceptions and preferences—all are bound to the Five Phases.*

The generative and consummate numbers of the Phases are not uniform, which is why the myriad things are so abundant that they fill the space between Heaven and Earth without cease. Water’s generative number is one, its consummate number six; fire’s generative number is two, its consummate number seven; wood’s generative number is three, its consummate number eight; metal’s generative number is four, its consummate number nine; earth’s generative number is five, its consummate number ten. Hence it is said: *The numbers of the Phases are not uniform.*

The Five Phases and yin-yang mutually impel and agitate, intermingling and transforming. From the vast to the minute, the flying and the hidden, the moving and the still—all teem and surge without end. In their countless multitudes, they fill the space between Heaven and Earth, ceaselessly generating and transforming, giving rise to diverse kinds, never resting. Hence it is said: *This is why the myriad things are so abundant that they fill the space between Heaven and Earth without cease.*

The Five Affairs correspond to the Five Phases, and the Five Phases give rise to the Five Creatures—how could one exhaust their enumeration? The Five Affairs are all functions: seeing, hearing, eating, breathing, and thinking. Their correspondence to the Five Phases is as follows: the eyes are the outward manifestation of the liver, and the liver belongs to wood, so seeing pertains to wood; the ears are the outward manifestation of the kidneys, and the kidneys belong to water, so hearing pertains to water; the tongue is the outward manifestation of the heart, and the heart belongs to fire, so eating pertains to fire; the nose is the outward manifestation of the lungs, and the lungs belong to metal, so breathing pertains to metal; the mind is the spirit of the spleen, and the spleen belongs to earth, so thinking pertains to earth. Hence it is said: *The Five Affairs correspond to the Five Phases.*

The Five Phases are wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. The Five Creatures are scaled, feathered, naked, furred, and armored. The east, with its celestial stems *jia* and *yi*, belongs to wood and gives rise to 360 kinds of scaled creatures, with the dragon as their chief. The south, with its celestial stems *bing* and *ding*, belongs to fire and gives rise to 360 kinds of feathered creatures, with the phoenix as their chief. The center, with its celestial stems *wu* and *ji*, belongs to earth and gives rise to 360 kinds of naked creatures, with the sage as their chief. The west, with its celestial stems *geng* and *xin*, belongs to metal and gives rise to 360 kinds of furred creatures, with the qilin as their chief. The north, with its celestial stems *ren* and *gui*, belongs to water and gives rise to 360 kinds of armored creatures, with the spirit-turtle as their chief. Hence it is said: *The Five Phases give rise to the Five Creatures*—how could one exhaust the discussion of moving and growing things? *Sheng* means "to bear," and *yan* means "to discourse."

For example, when divining with tortoise shells or milfoil stalks, if sincerity is fully present, the Five Phases respond; but if sincerity is lacking, no matter how one divines or calculates, not a single response will come.

The divination with tortoise shells and milfoil stalks is the second chapter of the "Two Pillars of Interpretation." All that has been discussed earlier—nobility and baseness, wisdom and foolishness, clarity and obscurity, feathered and furred creatures, spirits and ghosts, and the karmic causes of the Five Constants—is like making sincere prayers and drilling the tortoise shell or casting the milfoil stalks: the Five Phases respond with auspicious or inauspicious omens. A person’s form, dwelling, knowledge, and preferences all correspond to the Five Phases in the same way. Thus it is said: *For example, when divining with tortoise shells or milfoil stalks, if sincerity is fully present, the Five Phases respond.*

If, when drilling the tortoise shell or casting the milfoil stalks, the heart is not fully sincere, not a single omen of fortune or misfortune will respond. When the human heart has no attachments, severs its desires, remains pure and unstained, departs from all extremes, and does not fall into cause and effect, the cycle of rebirth is likewise. Thus it is said: *If sincerity is lacking, no matter how one divines or calculates, not a single response will come.*

The sage borrows things to wander through the world, and the Five Phases cannot but correspond. The sage employs the forms of the Four Great Elements and the virtue of the Five Constants to universally benefit all beings, making wondrous use of them. Having taken the Five Constants as their wondrous function, dwelling and wandering in the world to universally benefit all beings, they assign benevolence to wood, righteousness to metal, propriety to fire, wisdom to water, and trustworthiness to earth. Since these are the Five Constants, they cannot but correspond to the Five Phases. Thus it is said: *The sage borrows things to wander through the world, and the Five Phases cannot but correspond.*

This chapter clarifies that when the heart is stained with attachments, it falls into cause and effect; when the heart is free from attachments, it escapes the cycle of rebirth.

**Chapter Six**
Master Guan Yin said: The three possess the *hun*-soul. The *hun* is consciousness; the eye is essence; color is spirit. That which perceives them belongs to the *hun*—ears, mouth, nose, heart, and the like.

The *hun* possesses this consciousness, essence, and spirit—these three. Thus it is said: *The three possess the *hun*-soul.* The *hun* dwells in the eye by day; the eye sees and distinguishes the five colors. It also possesses consciousness, essence, and spirit, and only then can it see and distinguish. Thus it is said: *The *hun* is consciousness; the eye is essence; color is spirit.* That which distinguishes color with the eye is the *hun*’s consciousness; the eye’s spirit-water is its essence and spirit.

Not only is seeing so, but hearing sounds, tasting flavors, smelling fragrances, and the heart contemplating objects all similarly possess consciousness, essence, and spirit before they can distinguish sounds, flavors, fragrances, and objects. Thus it is said: *That which perceives them belongs to the *hun*—ears, mouth, nose, heart, and the like.* "The like" means "the same."

In this life, love is essence and the root of the father for the next life; observation is spirit and the root of the mother for the next life. Though love and observation differ, both arise from the same consciousness. In this life, the body is the father for the next; the love that clings to the mother is essence—essence belongs to water. The mother for the next life is the observation that clings to the father—observation is spirit, and spirit belongs to fire. The intermingling of the father’s and mother’s essence and spirit is the root of this life’s body. Thus it is said: *In this life, love is essence and the root of the father for the next life; observation is spirit and the root of the mother for the next life.* Though the father’s love and the mother’s observation differ, both use consciousness and emotion to intermingle and give birth to the child—they are the same. Thus it is said: *Though love and observation differ, both arise from the same cause.*

The root of the next life’s birth. In the next life, the first is the father, so one receives *qi* from the father’s *qi*, which is water. The second is the mother, so one receives blood from the mother’s blood, which is fire. The father and mother of the next life are the root of its birth. The father’s essence belongs to water, and water’s number is one—thus the first is the father. At the beginning of this body’s birth, it first receives the father’s essence-*qi* to form the embryo’s origin—essence-*qi* belongs to water. Thus it is said: *The root of the next life’s birth. In the next life, the first is the father, so one receives *qi* from the father’s *qi*, which is water.* The mother’s blood belongs to fire, and fire’s number is two—thus the second is the mother. At the beginning of this body’s birth, it next receives the mother’s blood-*qi* to form the embryo’s foundation—blood-*qi* belongs to fire. Thus it is said: *The second is the mother, so one receives blood from the mother’s blood, which is fire.* With a father and a mother, the next life is born. With a father and a mother, yin and yang intermingle, and the father and mother of the next life give birth without end. Thus it is said: *With a father and a mother, the next life is born.*

Only when love is without consciousness, like the intertwining of a lock, and observation is without consciousness, like the illumination of a lamp—when my consciousness does not sprout—how can my birth exist? Only by being perfectly impartial, universally benefiting all without consciousness, seeking no reward, and not abiding in the traces of benevolent action—though engaging with the world like the intertwining of a lock’s rings, without the heart of emotional consciousness—can this be so. Thus it is said: *Only when love is without consciousness, like the intertwining of a lock.* The benevolent embrace all with love; their perfect clarity, concentration, and wisdom are like a great mirror, reflecting things without heart, like a lamp dispelling darkness, illuminating things without consciousness. Thus it is said: *Observation is without consciousness, like the illumination of a lamp.* As described above, being perfectly impartial, universally benefiting all without heart, with concentration and wisdom perfectly clear, responding to things without consciousness—when my consciousness does not sprout, how can my birth and death exist? Thus it is said: *When my consciousness does not sprout, how can my birth exist?* This chapter clarifies that consciousness is the seed of birth and death; without consciousness, there is no cycle of birth and death.

**Chapter Seven**
Master Guan Yin said: It is like striking a drum with a stick. The drum’s form is what I possess; the drum’s sound is my response. The stick has already gone, yet the lingering sound remains—ultimately, it too will cease to exist.

Wandering through the world, when things come to interact, it is like a drumstick striking a drum—only after being struck does the sound arise. Thus it is said: *It is like striking a drum with a stick.* What I possess—my essence and spirit—is like the drum’s form; my response is like the drum’s sound. Thus it is said: *The drum’s form is what I possess; the drum’s sound is my response.* The stick has already gone, yet the drum’s lingering sound remains.

As the stimulus that aroused me has already passed, yet the awareness of my essence, spirit, soul, and vitality lingers unresolved—turning the light inward to shatter this awareness and forget it is what ultimately renders it nonexistent. Thus it is said: *The stick has already gone, yet the lingering sound remains—ultimately, it too will cease to exist.* The drum’s form is like my essence; the drum’s sound is like my spirit; its lingering resonance is like my soul and vitality.

My vivid clarity is like the drum’s form; my stillness, unmoving, yet responsive and all-pervading, is like the drum’s sound. Thus it is said: *The drum’s form is like my essence; the drum’s sound is like my spirit.* The awareness of my soul and vitality, unceasing in its response to external stimuli, is like the stick that has already gone, yet the drum’s lingering resonance remains. Thus it is said: *The lingering sound is like the soul and vitality.*

Know that what comes and goes in an instant—how can the qi of the Five Phases belong to me? If one awakens to the true emptiness of original nature, perceiving the fleeting comings and goings of external phenomena while remaining ever still in response, then how can the qi of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth pertain to true emptiness? Thus it is said: *Know that what comes and goes in an instant—how can the qi of the Five Phases belong to me?* This chapter clarifies that true emptiness does not pertain to the Five Phases.

**Chapter Eight**
Master Guan Yin said: The kernel within a fruit must await the presence of Water, Fire, and Earth—only then can it generate endlessly. Without all three, as in great drought, great flood, or barren clods, none suffice to bring forth life.

Within the fruit, the kernel buried in the soil must await the nourishment of rain and moisture, the warmth of sunlight and fire—only then does the kernel sprout, the sprout grow into a tree, and the tree bear fruit once more. The kernel is planted again, and with the nurturing warmth of Water, Fire, and Earth, it sprouts, grows into a tree, and bears fruit in an unending cycle. Thus it is said: *The kernel within a fruit must await the presence of Water, Fire, and Earth—only then can it generate endlessly.*

If the kernel is not buried in soil, lacking the nourishment of rain and sunlight, how can it sprout and grow into a tree? Without Water, Fire, and Earth, as in times of severe drought, flooding, or parched earth, nothing can take root and grow. Thus it is said: *Without all three, as in great drought, great flood, or barren clods, none suffice to bring forth life.* "Flood" means excess; "suffice" means attainment.

Essence-Water, Spirit-Fire, and Mind-Earth do not originally interact—only when humans unite them through the root do they appear to give rise to phenomena. Essence pertains to Water, Spirit to Fire, and Mind to Earth. These three—essence, spirit, and mind—do not inherently generate phenomena, but when a man and woman unite their roots, essence, spirit, and awareness merge in the fleeting moment of conception, illusorily perceiving the form of this embryonic event. Thus life arises endlessly, just as a kernel, with Water, Fire, and Earth, sprouts, grows into a tree, and bears fruit in an unceasing cycle. Thus it is said: *Essence-Water, Spirit-Fire, and Mind-Earth do not originally interact—only when humans unite them through the root do they appear to give rise to phenomena.*

It is like a sorcerer who, from utter nothingness, conjures manifold phenomena. Before the union of man and woman, each abides in the true emptiness of original nature, fundamentally pure and devoid of phenomena. Yet through the union of their roots, essence, spirit, and mind give rise to a child—much like a sorcerer or shaman who, from utter nothingness, summons spirits and illusorily perceives strange transformations. Thus it is said: *It is like a sorcerer who, from utter nothingness, conjures manifold phenomena.* This chapter clarifies that originally, all is pure and still, fundamentally free from birth and death. It is human delusion and desire that plunge one into the cycle of birth and death.

**Chapter Nine**
Master Guan Yin said: The soul is Water; the root of Wood lies in winter Water, yet its blossoms appear in summer Fire. Thus, a person’s soul is stored in the night’s essence and manifests in the day’s spirit.

The soul is Wood. In winter, Wood returns to its root to renew its life, nourished by winter Water; in summer, warmed by Fire, it blooms. Thus it is said: *The soul is Wood; the root of Wood lies in winter Water, yet its blossoms appear in summer Fire.* Essence pertains to Water, and the soul to Wood—Water generates Wood. Thus it is said: *A person’s soul is stored in the night’s essence.* Night pertains to yin, and yin to Water; day pertains to yang, and yang to Fire. The spirit pertains to Fire, and the soul, dwelling in the eyes by day, reveals its radiance through the spirit. Thus it is said: *And manifests in the day’s spirit.*

United with essence, what is perceived is uniquely mine—for essence has never known another. United with spirit, what is perceived is shared by all—for spirit has never known a self. Essence pertains to Water, and Water has no other; thus, essence also has no other. United with pure essence, one’s clarity stands solitary, unaccompanied by the myriad phenomena. Thus it is said: *United with essence, what is perceived is uniquely mine—for essence has never known another.* United with pure spirit, one’s awareness is profound and unfathomable, responsive only after being stirred, answering to others without a self. Spirit pertains to Fire, and Fire has no self; thus, spirit also has no self. Thus it is said: *United with spirit, what is perceived is shared by all—for spirit has never known a self.* This chapter clarifies that one who embodies pure essence and pure spirit transcends both self and other.

**Chapter Ten**
Master Guan Yin said: Realize that this body is like a body in a dream, appearing as one’s emotions dictate—then one may send forth the spirit as oneself and wander the Great Purity.

To "realize" is to awaken. If one awakens to the truth that this body, composed of the four great elements, is like dust gathering into foam—ephemeral, dreamlike, and insubstantial—an illusory and unreal form shaped by deluded emotions into the notion of a self, then, with such awakening and thorough penetration of true emptiness, one may soar with the spirit’s function, swift without haste, arriving without traveling, and wander the realm of the Great Purity without cease.

The Great Purity is the wondrous Dao of true emptiness—thus it is said: "Realize that this body is like a body in a dream, appearing as one’s emotions dictate, then one may send forth the spirit as oneself and wander the Great Purity." Realize that these phenomena are like objects in a dream, shaped by one’s emotions—then one may condense essence into phenomena and traverse the Eight Wastes.

Phenomena are functions. If one awakens to the sixfold spiritual penetrations as likewise dreamlike and insubstantial, and thoroughly penetrates true emptiness, one may concentrate the luminous clarity of refined essence to manifest wondrous function, riding the Eight Wastes in an instant’s journey. Thus it is said: "Realize that these phenomena are like objects in a dream, appearing as one’s emotions dictate, then one may condense essence into phenomena and traverse the Eight Wastes."

The Eight Wastes lie beyond the Four Seas, called the Eight Chords; beyond the Eight Chords lie the Eight Expanses; beyond the Eight Expanses lie the Eight Regions; beyond the Eight Regions lie the Eight Poles; beyond the Eight Poles lie the Eight Wastes; beyond the Eight Wastes lies the Vast Primeval, the boundless frontier.

Moreover, the Great Purity is the heaven where the Supreme resides, above the Four Celestial Realms of humankind—it is the immortal realm of the Great Purity. Those of great attainment take true emptiness and the Great Void as their body, reaching as far as beyond the Eight Wastes and as near as the space between their brows. Yin and yang cannot fathom it; ghosts and spirits cannot glimpse it. Without relying on external things, they traverse the immortal realm of the Great Purity beyond the Eight Wastes in an instant’s journey.

At times, they manifest transformations to awaken the deluded; at others, they rouse sincerity and faith in the Dao. Sometimes they project the spirit as a body beyond the body, riding the void and treading emptiness to ascend and wander the immortal realm of the Great Purity. At other times, they condense essence into dragons and tigers, simurghs and phoenixes, tortoises and cranes, beams and carp, winnowing baskets and towers, riding them to roam beyond the Eight Wastes in playful excursion.

This Dao can preserve spirit to prolong life, or forget spirit to transcend life. *This* refers to this Dao—the inconceivable Dao. When one awakens to the wondrousness of this inconceivable Dao, the body becomes like withered wood, the mind like cold ashes. Naturally, the spirit settles and essence congeals, reversing aging to restore youth, extending life and preserving vision—like Guangchengzi, who lived twelve hundred years without ever declining. Thus it is said: "This Dao can preserve spirit to prolong life." When body and mind are like withered wood and cold ashes, one forgets spirit and far transcends birth and death. Thus it is said: "It can forget spirit to transcend life."

Inhale qi to nourish essence, like metal generating water.
Qi is white and belongs to metal. There exists a minor practice of hygiene: inhaling through the nose, holding the breath briefly, and exhaling slowly to nourish essence and cure illness. Qi nurtures essence as metal generates water—qi pertains to metal, essence to water. Thus it is said: "Inhale qi to nourish essence, like metal generating water."

Inhale wind to nourish spirit, like wood generating fire.
There exists a minor practice to cultivate the heart: drawing in pure wind through the nose, allowing gentle ebb and flow, so the heart remains undisturbed and the spirit settled, thus receiving its nourishment. Wind pertains to wood, spirit to fire. Thus it is said: "Inhale wind to nourish spirit, like wood generating fire."

These methods borrow externals to extend spirit.
As mentioned above, inhaling qi and wind to nourish spirit borrows externals to retain and extend spirit, preventing its dissipation. Thus it is said: "These methods borrow externals to extend spirit."

Rinse with water to nourish essence, so essence never depletes.
There exists a minor practice: rinsing with saliva to preserve essence, preventing its leakage, so essence flourishes without end. Thus it is said: "Rinse with water to nourish essence, so essence never depletes."

Rub with fire to nourish spirit, so spirit never depletes.
There exists a minor practice: concentrating the mind to rub the navel wheel until it grows hot as fire, so spirit flourishes without end. Thus it is said: "Rub with fire to nourish spirit, so spirit never depletes."

These methods borrow internals to extend spirit.
As mentioned above, rinsing with the water of saliva and rubbing with the fire of the navel wheel do not rely on externals—they borrow internals to retain and extend spirit, preventing its dissipation. Thus it is said: "These methods borrow internals to extend spirit."

As for those who forget essence to transcend life, I have spoken of this before.
When one thoroughly penetrates true emptiness and spirit returns to its source, profound and unfathomable, one no longer knows of spirit to forget, nor of birth and death to transcend. I have often instructed disciples on this. As for other minor practices borrowing externals or internals, I have never spoken of them. Thus it is said: "As for those who forget essence to transcend life, I have spoken of this before."

This chapter clarifies that the Dao is realized through the awakening of the heart—minor practices cannot compare.

**Chapter Eleven**
Master Guan Yin said: One who diligently practices ritual keeps the spirit from scattering and may gather it.
Ritual pertains to fire in the Five Phases, as does spirit. Ritual is reverence and care. When the heart is devoted to vigilance and sincerity, never deceiving even in solitude, the spirit does not gallop outward but gathers and settles in stillness. Thus it is said: "One who diligently practices ritual keeps the spirit from scattering and may gather it." *Diligence* means focus.

One who diligently cultivates wisdom prevents essence from leaking and may refine it.
Wisdom pertains to water in the Five Phases, as does essence. Wisdom discerns truth from falsehood, right from wrong, and is devoted to preserving truth and forgetting falsehood—thus names follow right and shun wrong. In this way, essence does not leak outward but may be refined and nurtured. Thus it is said: "One who diligently cultivates wisdom prevents essence from leaking and may refine it."

Gathering means nurturing. Benevolence pertains to yang and brightness, and may lighten the *hun*-soul. Righteousness pertains to yin and darkness, and may govern the *po*-soul. Benevolence corresponds to wood in the Five Phases, as does the *hun*-soul. Benevolence nurtures the self through stillness and benefits others through compassion. Compassion and goodness belong to yang; stillness brings clarity. Thus the *hun*-spirit becomes light and pure, limpid and deep. Hence it is said: "Benevolence pertains to yang and brightness, and may lighten the *hun*-soul." Righteousness corresponds to metal in the Five Phases, as does the *po*-soul. Profoundly comprehending true emptiness, it unites with the Dao in authenticity. Concealed in yin’s hidden depths, it causes the *shi-po* to rest in stillness and become clear and penetrating. Hence it is said: "Righteousness pertains to yin and darkness, and may govern the *po*-soul." To govern means to cause to rest. This chapter elucidates the wondrous functions of the Five Constants as the Dao.

**Chapter Twelve**
Master Guan Yin said: The dung beetle rolls a pellet. When the pellet is formed, it concentrates its spirit upon it, and a white grub comes to dwell within. Soon it sheds its husk and becomes a cicada. The dung beetle rolls dung into a pellet. Once the pellet is formed, it burrows into the earth, embracing the pellet with single-minded focus. The beetle’s spirit and qi enter the pellet, transforming into a white grub. Nurtured through autumn, winter, and spring, warmed by summer’s fire-like qi, it emerges from the soil and climbs grasses, trees, or walls. In an instant, its back splits open; it sheds its husk and becomes a cicada, flying among the trees, sipping wind and dew as it sings. Hence it is said: "The dung beetle rolls a pellet. When the pellet is formed, it concentrates its spirit upon it, and a white grub comes to dwell within. Soon it sheds its husk and becomes a cicada." If the beetle does not concentrate its spirit, how could the grub come to be? All transformations follow deluded thoughts, and form changes accordingly. Thus it is said: "If the beetle does not concentrate its spirit, how could the grub come to be?" *Xi* means "how." This chapter clarifies that the transformations of life and death all arise from deluded attachment.

---

**Chapter Thirteen**
Master Guan Yin said: A cook was preparing mantis shrimp. He left one leg upon the table, and though the shrimp had been cooked, the discarded leg still twitched. Life and death are but the gathering and dispersal of a single qi. When a cook prepares mantis shrimp, leaving one leg upon the table, the shrimp may be cooked, yet the discarded leg still moves. From this we know that life and death are but the gathering and dispersal of a single qi. When qi gathers, life arises; when qi disperses, death follows. That the discarded leg still moves shows the qi has not yet completely dissipated. Hence it is said: "A cook was preparing mantis shrimp. He left one leg upon the table, and though the shrimp had been cooked, the discarded leg still twitched. Life and death are but the gathering and dispersal of a single qi." That which is neither born nor dies—yet people falsely conceive of birth and death. *Heng* means delusion. The original face of true emptiness, the inherent nature, existed before the Five Ultimates. Before the Five Ultimates, there was not yet a single qi. From this we know that the nature of true emptiness does not belong to qi. Not belonging to qi, it has no gathering or dispersal. Without gathering or dispersal, there is no birth or death. Thus, those who fail to awaken to this nature see only the gathering of qi into form as birth and the dispersal of form as death—how could this not be a deluded conception? Hence it is said: "That which is neither born nor dies—yet people falsely conceive of birth and death." This chapter clarifies that the nature is fundamentally without birth or death; the deluded fear it out of ignorance.

**Chapter Fourteen**
Master Guan Yin said: There are those who die standing, those who die sitting, those who die suddenly, those who die from illness, and those who die from poison. Though their deaths differ, there is no distinction between them. In the world, some depart while standing, some while sitting, some in an instant, some from grave illness, and some from ingesting poison. Though the manner of death—standing, sitting, sudden, illness, or poison—varies, death itself is no different. There is no distinction between one death and another. Hence it is said: "There are those who die standing, those who die sitting, those who die suddenly, those who die from illness, and those who die from poison. Though their deaths differ, there is no distinction between them." The one who knows the Dao does not perceive birth, and thus does not perceive death. *Zhi* means awakening. The awakened one, having penetrated true emptiness, is free from birth and death in the heart. Turning inward, they see the four great elements as a temporary assemblage, like dust gathering and dispersing, like a thatched hut briefly lodging a traveler. They do not perceive birth or death as real. Hence it is said: "The one who knows the Dao does not perceive birth, and thus does not perceive death." This chapter clarifies that the Dao is without birth or death, and those who have realized the Dao perceive no birth or death.

**Chapter Fifteen**
Master Guan Yin said: Those who loathe life and death and seek to transcend them all suffer from a grave affliction. *Huan* means illness. The deluded, failing to realize that the Dao is without birth or death and that one can be free from them, cling to life and fear death. Before awakening, they conceive an aversion to life and death and seek to transcend them directly—this is the great affliction of the Dao-seeker. Hence it is said: "Those who loathe life and death and seek to transcend them all suffer from a grave affliction." For example, if a transformed being harbored such aversion and desire, it would be called a demon, not the Dao. A *hua-ren* is one who teaches and transforms others. For instance, if a teacher instructed the deluded to cultivate aversion to life and death and seek to transcend them, this would be teaching demonic and inauspicious practices—how could it be called teaching the Dao? Hence it is said: "For example, if a transformed being harbored such aversion and desire, it would be called a demon, not the Dao." This chapter clarifies that those who have realized the Dao perceive no life or death to loathe or transcend.

Chapter Sixteen

Master Guan Yin said: Those who speculate on life and death hold various views. Some say that after death, one continues to exist; some say that after death, one ceases to exist; some say that after death, one both exists and does not exist. Those who recklessly speculate on life and death may claim that the body is like a rented dwelling—when the dwelling crumbles, the person remains; when the body dies, the nature endures. Thus it is said: some say that after death, one continues to exist.

Others may say: a person lives for a lifetime, as grass lives for a season; when a person dies, it is like a lamp extinguished—once dead, nothing remains. Thus it is said: some say that after death, one ceases to exist.

Still others may say: when a person dies, no trace is left, yet some spirits attach to others and communicate, leaving one to doubt whether death is both existence and non-existence. Thus it is said: some say that after death, one both exists and does not exist.

Some say one should rejoice in death; some say one should fear it; some say one should accept it; some say one should transcend it. Such shifting perceptions and restless emotions race on without end.

Some may say: in life, one is not numinous, but in death, one becomes so; in life, one finds no joy, but in death, one does. The spirit having form is like form having a wart—if the wart were absent, what could not be achieved? Thus is death not cause for rejoicing? Hence it is said: some say one should rejoice in death.

Others may say: when a person dies, they become a ghost, dwelling in endless darkness where the three luminaries do not shine, where no homeland offers shelter, where no familiar faces provide solace, where no food or drink sustains them. The dark, shadowy netherworld is truly fearful. Hence it is said: some say one should fear death.

Still others may say: life and death come and go in an instant—neither joy nor fear is fitting; one should simply let them follow their natural course. Hence it is said: some say one should accept death.

And some may say: transcending life and death is not difficult—with single-minded devotion to the Dao, one may directly transcend them. Hence it is said: some say one should transcend death.

The preceding reckless speculations on life and death—whether death entails existence, non-existence, or both, whether one should rejoice, fear, accept, or transcend it—these eight views only multiply deluded perceptions, causing the emotions to gallop ceaselessly. Hence it is said: such shifting perceptions and restless emotions race on without end.

Yet they do not realize that my life and death are like a horse’s hand or an ox’s wing—fundamentally non-existent, and thus neither existent nor non-existent. It is like fire and water: though one may encounter fire and water, they cannot burn or drown one.

Those who recklessly speculate on life and death do not realize that life and death are originally non-existent. Their speculations are like imagining a horse has hands or an ox has wings and clinging to such delusions. Horses and oxen naturally have no hands or wings, yet they imagine them to exist. This analogy reveals that life and death are fundamentally neither existent nor non-existent. Hence it is said: they do not realize that my life and death are like a horse’s hand or an ox’s wing—fundamentally non-existent, and thus neither existent nor non-existent.

The original true emptiness and wondrous existence are one with the great void. Emptiness merging with emptiness is like fire meeting fire—its brightness is not questioned, for fire does not burn fire. Water meeting water—its clarity is not questioned, for water does not drown water. Hence it is said: it is like fire and water—though one may encounter fire and water, they cannot burn or drown one.

This chapter clarifies that when perceptions and consciousness do not arise, life and death are fundamentally non-existent.

**Chapter Five: The Five Mirrors**

A mirror is the heart; this chapter contains twenty sections.

Master Guan Yin said: When the heart is obscured by fortune and misfortune, numinous ghosts seize it. When the heart is obscured by male and female, lewd ghosts seize it. When the heart is obscured by hidden sorrow, drowning ghosts seize it. When the heart is obscured by reckless pursuit, mad ghosts seize it. When the heart is obscured by oaths and curses, strange ghosts seize it. When the heart is obscured by medicines and elixirs, material ghosts seize it.

Obscuration means fixation and delusion. When a person’s heart is singularly fixated on fortune and misfortune, the Five Phases, and yin and yang, then ghosts of numinous penetration seize and delude it—hence it is said, “When the heart is obscured by fortune and misfortune, numinous ghosts seize it.” When a person’s heart is singularly fixated on the entanglements of husband and wife, the arts of bedchamber union, and sexual combat, then lewd ghosts seize and delude it—hence it is said, “When the heart is obscured by male and female, lewd ghosts seize it.” When a person’s heart is singularly fixated on dark sorrow and melancholy, drowning ghosts seize and delude it—hence it is said, “When the heart is obscured by hidden sorrow, drowning ghosts seize it.” When a person’s heart is singularly fixated on reckless hunting and wandering, mad ghosts seize and delude it—hence it is said, “When the heart is obscured by reckless pursuit, mad ghosts seize it.” When a person’s heart is singularly fixated on oaths, vows, and curses, strange ghosts seize and delude it—hence it is said, “When the heart is obscured by oaths and curses, strange ghosts seize it.” When a person’s heart is singularly fixated on compounding and consuming medicines and elixirs, material ghosts seize and delude it—hence it is said, “When the heart is obscured by medicines and elixirs, material ghosts seize it.”

Such ghosts may take yin as their bodies, or darkness as their bodies, or wind as their bodies, or qi as their bodies, or clay effigies as their bodies, or painted images as their bodies, or old beasts as their bodies, or broken vessels as their bodies.

As stated above, the six kinds of ghosts—numinous, lewd, drowning, mad, strange, and material—seize and delude the six kinds of people fixated on obscurations. Thus it is said, “Such are these ghosts.”

Ghosts have no form or appearance; they must attach to things to take shape. Some attach to shadows to form bodies and appear to delude people—hence it is said, “Some take yin as their bodies.” Some attach to darkness to form bodies and appear to delude people—hence it is said, “Some take darkness as their bodies.” Some attach to whirlwinds to form bodies and appear to delude people—hence it is said, “Some take wind as their bodies.” Some attach to yin qi to form bodies and appear to delude people—hence it is said, “Some take qi as their bodies.” Some attach to clay effigies to form bodies and appear to delude people—hence it is said, “Some take clay effigies as their bodies.” Some attach to painted figures to form bodies and appear to delude people—hence it is said, “Some take painted images as their bodies.” Some attach to old beasts to form bodies and appear to delude people—hence it is said, “Some take old beasts as their bodies.” Some attach to broken vessels to form bodies and appear to delude people—hence it is said, “Some take broken vessels as their bodies.”

Theirs is their essence; ours is our essence. When the two essences clash, the spirit responds.

“Theirs” refers to the ghosts that attach to the eight things—yin, darkness, wind, qi, clay effigies, painted images, old beasts, and broken vessels. “Ours” refers to the six kinds of people whose hearts are obscured by fortune and misfortune, male and female, hidden sorrow, reckless pursuit, oaths and curses, and medicines and elixirs. When such people are singularly fixated on these six matters, their essence becomes unyielding. The essence of the attaching ghosts and the essence of the person clash, and the ghosts manifest numinous and wondrous responses. Thus it is said, “Theirs is their essence; ours is our essence. When the two essences clash, the spirit responds.”

Those seized by ghosts may explain strange matters, extraordinary matters, or auspicious matters. Such people grow arrogant, claiming not that ghosts possess them but that the Dao possesses them.

People whose hearts are fixated and deluded by the six ghosts—numinous, lewd, drowning, mad, strange, and material—may explain rare and wondrous matters, strange and uncanny matters, or auspicious and prophetic matters. Their predictions invariably come true, and the multitude reveres them as sages. Yet those who explain such strange and auspicious matters grow arrogant, refusing to admit that ghosts possess them, insisting instead that the supreme Dao has granted them such numinous penetration. Thus it is said, “Those seized by ghosts may explain strange matters, extraordinary matters, or auspicious matters. Such people grow arrogant, claiming not that ghosts possess them but that the Dao possesses them.”

In time, they may die by wood, die by metal, die by rope, or die by well.

Those seized by ghosts, who arrogantly believe themselves to have attained the Dao after explaining strange and auspicious matters, may in time die by crashing into trees, by cutting their throats with blades, by hanging themselves with ropes, or by throwing themselves into wells. Thus it is said, “In time, they may die by wood, die by metal, die by rope, or die by well.”

Only the sage can spiritually engage with spirits without being ensnared by them, commanding the myriad spirits while grasping their mechanism. They can gather them, disperse them, or master them, responding to the ten thousand things while their heart remains serene.

Only the sage who has attained the Dao, who thoroughly comprehends the wondrous interplay of emptiness and existence, who awakens to the spirit that is not spirit, whose yin and yang are unfathomable, whose transformations pervade the dust-like worlds, whose wondrous functions are boundless, and whose subtlety remains concealed—only such a sage can spiritually engage with spirits without being ensnared by them. Thus it is said, “Only the sage can spiritually engage with spirits without being ensnared by them.”

The enlightened sage who has attained the Dao can summon wind and rain, command the myriad spirits, and grasp their mechanism—*grasp* meaning to hold and master. Not only can such a sage summon wind and rain and command the myriad spirits, but they can also gather them when they may be assembled, disperse them when they may be divided, and restrain them when they may be controlled. Thus it is said, “They can gather them, disperse them, or master them.”

The heart of the enlightened sage is like the moon reflected in all waters, like the wind resounding through the myriad sounds, like a mirror suspended to reflect all forms, like an empty valley transmitting all echoes—responding to change while ever still and luminous, ever pure and tranquil. Thus it is said, “They respond to the ten thousand things while their heart remains serene.”

This chapter clarifies that any heart bound by attachments is a deluded heart, while the unbound heart is the Dao.

**Chapter One**
Master Guan Yin said: Do not fixate on oneness, for the five senses will race in parallel—if the heart cannot be one, it is because oneness cannot be fixed. Do not seek emptiness, for the five phases will all arise—if the heart cannot be empty, it is because emptiness cannot be forced. Do not cling to stillness, for the ten thousand transformations will shift imperceptibly—if the heart cannot be still, it is because stillness cannot be grasped.

*Do not* is a prohibitive term, for the wondrous heart is originally non-dual. It warns the learner not to single-mindedly pursue oneness. If the thought of fixating on oneness arises, that very thought will race alongside the five senses—sight, hearing, taste, breath, and thought—preventing true unity. Through this understanding, one knows the heart cannot be forced into oneness. Thus it is said, “Do not fixate on oneness, for the five senses will race in parallel—the heart cannot be one.”

The wondrous heart is originally empty of all things, equal to the great void. It warns the learner not to single-mindedly pursue emptiness. If the thought of forcing emptiness arises, it will align with the five phases—joy as fire, anger as wood, thought as earth, sorrow as metal, and fear as water—all arising together, preventing true emptiness. Through this understanding, one knows the heart cannot be forced into emptiness. Thus it is said, “Do not seek emptiness, for the five phases will all arise—the heart cannot be empty.”

The wondrous heart is originally pure and still, like empty space, without movement or disturbance. It warns the learner not to single-mindedly cling to stillness. If the thought of fixating on stillness arises, it will be swept away by the imperceptible shifts of the ten thousand transformations, preventing true stillness. Through this understanding, one knows the heart cannot be forced into stillness. Thus it is said, “Do not cling to stillness, for the ten thousand transformations will shift imperceptibly—the heart cannot be still.”

To borrow oneness is to create duality; to borrow emptiness is to invite fullness; to borrow stillness is to invite movement. The wondrous heart is originally non-dual. If one fixates on oneness, that fixation becomes a duality opposing the non-dual heart. Thus it is said, “To borrow oneness is to create duality,” explaining why the heart cannot be one.

The wondrous heart is originally empty of all things, equal to the great void. If one fixates on emptiness, that fixation fills and obstructs the empty heart. Thus it is said, “To borrow emptiness is to invite fullness,” explaining why the heart cannot be empty.

The wondrous heart is originally still, like empty space, without movement or disturbance. If one fixates on stillness, that fixation itself becomes movement, disturbing the heart. Thus it is said, “To borrow stillness is to invite movement,” explaining why the heart cannot be still.

Only the sage can gather the ten thousand existences into a single breath, so that not a single thing can obscure their clarity. They can disperse a single breath into the ten thousand existences, so that not a single thing can inquire into their actions.

The heart of the enlightened sage is like the great void, all-embracing. Their transformed bodies number in the billions, yet in a single breath, they return to the source—like all water-moons under the one true moon, which governs the flowing waves of water-moons without any water ever drowning the true moon’s clarity. Thus it is said, “Only the sage can gather the ten thousand existences into a single breath, so that not a single thing can obscure their clarity.”

The enlightened sage, in a single breath, scatters their transformed bodies throughout the dust-like worlds—like the one true moon appearing in all waters. The ceaseless flow of water-waves cannot interrupt the true moon’s luminous actions and radiance. Thus it is said, “They can disperse a single breath into the ten thousand existences, so that not a single thing can inquire into their actions.”

This chapter clarifies that the wondrous heart is originally non-dual, empty, and still—responding to change without hindrance.

**Chapter Two**
Master Guan Yin said: A fire may burn for a thousand years, yet it can be extinguished in an instant. Consciousness may persist for a thousand years, yet it can be dissolved in an instant.

Fire has no self; it takes form through oil and fuel. Though it may burn for a thousand years, if the oil and fuel are suddenly exhausted, the fire will be extinguished. Thus it is said, “A fire may burn for a thousand years, yet it can be extinguished in an instant.” This begins the analogy.

The deluded mind races with karmic consciousness, without any true foundation. Trapped in the cycle of rebirth for countless eons, it cannot escape—all due to this consciousness.

Consciousness also has no self; it arises dependent on conditions. Though it may persist for ten thousand years, if one is suddenly awakened by a teacher’s guidance and directly realizes the wondrous heart—originally pure and still, equal to the great void—then in an instant, conditions vanish and consciousness dissolves, like a fire extinguished when the fuel is gone. Thus it is said, “Consciousness may persist for a thousand years, yet it can be dissolved in an instant.” This completes the analogy.

This chapter clarifies that consciousness is the root of birth and death, and the key to escaping the cycle lies in forgetting conditions and dissolving consciousness.

**Chapter Three**
Master Guan Yin said: What flows is the boat, but what causes it to flow is the water, not the boat. What moves is the cart, but what causes it to move is the ox, not the cart. What thinks is the heart, but what causes it to think is intention, not the heart.

People see only the boat’s movement, unaware that what truly moves it is the flowing water—the boat cannot move itself. Thus it is said, “What flows is the boat, but what causes it to flow is the water, not the boat.”

People see only the cart’s movement, unaware that what truly moves it is the ox’s pulling— the cart cannot move itself. Thus it is said, “What moves is the cart, but what causes it to move is the ox, not the cart.” These two analogies of boat and cart are borrowed comparisons.

People know only the heart’s thoughts, unaware that what enables thought is the intention and consciousness— the inherently wondrous heart does not think of itself. Thus it is said, “What thinks is the heart, but what causes it to think is intention, not the heart.” This is the combined analogy.

Not knowing the cause yet seeing the effect, only by not knowing the cause can one see the effect. Thus its coming has no source, its going no abode. The inherently wondrous heart takes true emptiness as its essence and wondrous existence as its function. Essence and function are thus, responding to change without end. Spirits and ghosts cannot fathom it; yin and yang cannot measure it— not knowing the cause yet seeing the effect.

Not knowing the cause yet seeing the effect, the inherently wondrous heart originally existed before the Five Ultimates, prior to the appearance of the Lord of Creation. Radiantly clear and luminous, its coming is unknown— whence it arises. Profoundly hidden and obscure, its going is unknown— where it resides. Thus it is said, “Not knowing the cause yet seeing the effect.” Only by not knowing the cause can one see the effect, so its coming has no source, its going no abode.

Its coming has no source, its going no abode, thus it can unite with the primordial origin of heaven and earth, neither ancient nor modern. The preceding two lines mean that the inherently wondrous heart, not knowing whence it arises, profoundly hidden in its going, yet unknown in its abode— thus heaven and earth share the same origin with me. The wondrous heart gives rise to the primordial origin, yet the wondrous heart does not belong to time, hence neither ancient nor modern. Thus it is said, its coming has no source, its going no abode, so it can unite with the primordial origin of heaven and earth, neither ancient nor modern.

This chapter clarifies that the inherently wondrous heart is endowed from before the Five Ultimates, beyond the reach of discursive thought.

**Chapter Five**
Master Guan Yin said: Know that the heart is without thing, then know that things are without thing. Know that things are without thing, then know that the Dao is without thing. Know that the Dao is without thing, thus one does not esteem lofty and peerless conduct nor marvel at subtle and wondrous words.

The inherently wondrous heart takes the Dao as its essence and things as its function. Awakening to the heart of the Dao, it is fundamentally without a single thing, equal to empty space. Essence and function are thus, responding to change yet ever tranquil. Thus it is said, “Know that the heart is without thing, then know that things are without thing. Know that things are without thing, then know that the Dao is without thing.”

“Know” means awakening. “Things without thing” means responding to change yet ever tranquil. Penetratingly awakening to the heart of the Dao, its essence and function without thing, thus one does not esteem lofty and peerless conduct. Though conduct may be lofty and peerless, it does not depart from traces, yet the Dao is originally without trace, hence one does not esteem it. Nor does one marvel at subtle and wondrous words. Though words may be profound and wondrous, they do not depart from names, yet the Dao is originally without name, hence one does not marvel at them. Thus it is said, “Know that the Dao is without thing, thus one does not esteem lofty and peerless conduct nor marvel at subtle and wondrous words.”

This chapter clarifies that the heart of the Dao responds to change yet remains ever tranquil, beyond the reach of words and conduct.

**Chapter Six**
Master Guan Yin said: When self and things interact, the heart arises— just as fire is born from two sticks rubbing. The heart is originally without heart; it appears through things. When self and things interact, the heart becomes manifest, like fire born from two sticks rubbing together. Thus it is said, “When self and things interact, the heart arises; two sticks rubbing produce fire.”

It cannot be said to be within me, nor within that, nor as not-me, nor as not-that. To cling to self and other is foolish.

The self is originally without self; when things come to interact, the heart suddenly appears— it is not that the heart arises from the self. Thus it cannot be said to be within me. When things come to interact, though the heart appears, the heart is like empty space, unimpeded by those things. Thus it cannot be said to be within that. If there were no self, though things came to interact, the heart would not arise. Since the heart has arisen, it cannot be said to be not-me. Thus it cannot be said to be not-me. If that thing did not come to interact, the heart would also not arise. The heart does not originally arise; it arises through interaction. Thus it cannot be said to be not-that. Thus it cannot be said to be not-that.

Deluded people, not awakening to the absence of self and heart, unimpeded by things, falsely establish a self and set it against things. Clinging to self and other, they encounter obstacles with things— what is this if not foolishness? Thus it is said, “To cling to self and other is foolish.” “And” refers to you; clinging to self and other without forgetting is the mark of a deluded person.

This chapter clarifies that the heart is originally without self and other, unimpeded by things. Deluded people falsely establish self and other, setting them against things.

**Chapter Seven**
Master Guan Yin said: Do not rely on what you call benefit and harm, right and wrong. As for what you call benefit and harm, right and wrong— do they truly attain benefit and harm, right and wrong?

“Do not” is a prohibitive term; “rely” means to depend upon. It means one should not depend upon what you call benefit and harm, right and wrong. Thus it is said, “Do not rely on what you call benefit and harm, right and wrong.” What you call benefit and harm, right and wrong are all deluded feelings without measure. How can benefit be definitively benefit, harm definitively harm, right definitively right, wrong definitively wrong? Benefit and harm, right and wrong change with deluded feelings— how can they be fixed? Since they cannot be fixed, they are merely what deluded feelings calculate at the time— how can they truly attain benefit and harm, right and wrong? Thus it is said, “As for what you call benefit and harm, right and wrong— do they truly attain benefit and harm, right and wrong?”

The sage goes so far as to be without knowledge or awareness— how much more so for you?

The one who moves and transforms benefit and harm, right and wrong is the Creator. The Creator is profound and obscure—none can fathom its workings. Even the sage of great wisdom, who fully penetrates the profound obscurity of the Creator, goes so far as to be without knowledge or awareness—how much more so for you, an ordinary person? Thus it is said, “The sage goes so far as to be without knowledge or awareness—how much more so for you?” This chapter clarifies that benefit and harm, right and wrong are moved and transformed by the Creator, and the ordinary cannot predict them.

**Chapter Seven**

Master Guan Yin said: The dreams of the night may extend longer than the night itself. The heart has no time. "Longer than the night" should be understood as "longer than the day," which makes sense in meaning—this is likely an error in transcription. The deluded person, when dreaming at night, may dream of a lifetime passing in a day. From this, we know that the originally wondrous heart is not bound by the reckoning of time. Thus it is said, "The dreams of the night may extend longer than the day—the heart has no time."

Those born in Qi see only the land of Qi in their hearts. Later, when they go to Song, to Chu, to Jin, to Liang, what their hearts hold differs— the heart has no direction. There are those born and raised in the state of Qi, whose hearts see only the realm of Qi. "And" (而) means "you," and "go" (之) means "to go." Once you go to the state of Song, then to the three states of Chu, Jin, and Liang, the boundaries of the four states differ, and what the heart holds also differs. From this, we know that the originally wondrous heart is not bound by direction. Thus it is said, "Those born in Qi see only the land of Qi in their hearts. Later, when they go to Song, to Chu, to Jin, to Liang, what their hearts hold differs—the heart has no direction." This chapter clarifies that the originally wondrous heart is not bound by the reckoning of time or direction.

**Chapter Eight**

Master Guan Yin said: The skilled archer takes the bow as his teacher, not Yi. The skilled boatman takes the boat as his teacher, not Jie.

Yi was the title of an ancient master archer. In former times, Emperor Yao bestowed upon Yi a bow and arrows, appointing him as the official in charge of archery. He dwelled in the land of Qiongshi. By the time of Emperor Yao, ten suns appeared at once, and Yi was commanded to shoot them, striking nine and bringing them down. Later, he usurped the throne of King Xiang of Xia, becoming the ruler of the state of Youqiong, named after Yi. His minister, Han Zhuo, killed him, took his wife, and gave birth to Jie. Jie was immensely strong, able to push a boat across dry land. Later, he was killed by Shaokang, the son of King Xiang of Xia.

"Teacher" means "model." The skilled archer takes the bow as his model to hit the mark. Since hitting the mark is the principle, why take Yi as the model? Thus it is said, "The skilled archer takes the bow as his teacher, not Yi." The skilled boatman takes the boat as his model, ensuring smooth passage without obstruction. Since the boat’s unobstructed passage is the principle, there is no need to take Jie as the model. Thus it is said, "The skilled boatman takes the boat as his teacher, not Jie." This is an analogy.

The skilled heart takes the heart as its teacher, not the sage. One who skillfully awakens to the originally wondrous heart, which is inherently pure, still, and free, untainted and unattached, takes awakening as the principle—there is no need to take the sage as the model. Thus it is said, "The skilled heart takes the heart as its teacher, not the sage." This is the synthesis of the analogy. This chapter clarifies that the heart takes awakening as its principle, thereby transcending the nearness of the sage.

**Chapter Nine**

Master Guan Yin said: Right and wrong, beauty and ugliness, success and failure, fullness and emptiness—these are moved by the Creator, yet all arise from clinging to private perceptions.

Taking the good and beautiful as right and lovely, and the evil and base as wrong and ugly; taking the flourishing of things as success and fullness, and their decline and decay as failure and emptiness—how could one know that right and wrong, beauty and ugliness, success and failure, fullness and emptiness are all moved by the natural Creator? How could I presume to intervene? Yet the deluded cling to them as if they were real, not realizing they all arise from one’s own private, deluded perceptions. Thus it is said, "Right and wrong, beauty and ugliness, success and failure, fullness and emptiness—these are moved by the Creator, yet all arise from clinging to private perceptions."

Then, when one tries to dispel them with "non-being," the traces still remain. When one tries to dispel them with "neither being nor non-being," the traces still remain. There is no day when one does not think of "neither being," no day when one does not think of "neither non-being"—the traces remain, like revisiting a place one once traveled and recalling it vividly.

Once one knows that right and wrong, beauty and ugliness, success and failure, fullness and emptiness all arise from clinging to private perceptions, then when one tries to dispel these perceptions with "non-being," the perception of "non-being" still lingers. Thus it is said, "Then, when one tries to dispel them with 'non-being,' the traces still remain." When one further tries to dispel the perception of "non-being" with "neither being nor non-being," the perception of "neither being nor non-being" still lingers. Thus it is said, "When one tries to dispel them with 'neither being nor non-being,' the traces still remain." There is no day when one does not think of "neither being," no day when one does not think of "neither non-being"—the perception of a vague, undifferentiated state still lingers. Thus it is said, "There is no day when one does not think of 'neither being,' no day when one does not think of 'neither non-being'—the traces remain."

Trying to dispel perception with perception is like washing mud with mud. Trying to dispel perception with perception is like revisiting a place one once traveled and suddenly recalling it—the old perception remains vivid and cannot be forgotten. Thus it is said, "Like revisiting a place one once traveled and recalling it vividly."

This cannot be forgotten, nor can it be dispelled. One who skillfully eliminates perception transforms perception into wisdom. This perception cannot be forgotten, nor can it be dispelled. One who skillfully eliminates perception thoroughly understands the true emptiness of the heart’s essence, transforming perception into wisdom, which becomes the wondrous function of the heart. Thus it is said, "This cannot be forgotten, nor can it be dispelled. One who skillfully eliminates perception transforms perception into wisdom."

Do you understand the saying about transforming perception into wisdom?
He said: Imagining ghosts makes the heart tremble; imagining thieves makes the heart fear. Perception is like mistaking millet for sorghum, or jade for stone—all are floating, illusory images without foundation.

Here is the translation:

---

"Stable" means level and steady. Regarding the earlier explanation of transforming perception into wisdom—do you yet understand it? Thus it is said, "Do you understand the saying about transforming perception into wisdom?" This is a rhetorical question, to which the answer is given: "Perceiving ghosts is like a person imagining spirits in this place, causing the heart to shudder and tremble in fear; imagining bandits is like a person thinking of robbers here, causing the heart to quail and shrink in terror." Thus it is said, "Perception is like thinking of ghosts, and the heart trembles; thinking of bandits, and the heart fears." "Discernment" is like a person mistakenly taking millet for sorghum—though sorghum resembles millet, it is black—or like one mistakenly taking jade for stone. This deluded, false perception and discernment are all floating, illusory images without form, without any place of true awakening. The wondrous heart’s original essence is the realm of true emptiness, level and steady, where it comes to rest. Thus it is said, "Discernment is like taking millet for sorghum, jade for stone—all are floating, illusory images without any place to settle."

"Without" means non-existent; "settling" means coming to rest. For example, seeing a strange object gives rise to strange perceptions, which in turn give rise to strange discernments. These perceptions and discernments do not take root in me. As previously explained, perceptions and discernments are like a person encountering an unusual thing, which then generates perceptions and discernments of that thing. These strange perceptions do not originally exist in the heart; they arise only upon seeing the unusual thing. Thus it is said, "For example, seeing a strange object gives rise to strange perceptions, which give rise to strange discernments—these perceptions and discernments do not take root in me."

"Perception" is the heart’s thinking; "discernment" is the heart’s distinguishing and differentiating. For instance, today is merely today; as for tomorrow’s perceptions and discernments, they cannot yet be foretold. But when tomorrow arrives, the myriad perceptions and discernments arise in response to events. All are conditioned by arising. Earlier, it was said that these perceptions and discernments do not take root in me. Fearing that one might not fully believe this, another analogy is given to clarify: For example, from dawn to dusk today, the perceptions and discernments of today’s affairs are already known. As for tomorrow’s perceptions and discernments, they cannot be predicted or foreknown. Thus it is said, "For example, today is merely today; as for tomorrow’s perceptions and discernments, they cannot yet be foretold." When tomorrow arrives, perceptions and discernments arise in chaotic profusion in response to events, showing that perceptions and discernments do not take root in me but arise spontaneously in response to circumstances. Thus it is said, "When tomorrow arrives, the myriad perceptions and discernments all arise conditioned by existence." "Conditioned" means "because of."

Perception and discernment are like a rhinoceros gazing at the moon: the moon’s form enters its horn, and only because of discernment does the moon’s form appear. Yet the true moon was never in the horn. The wondrous heart originally has no perceptions or discernments. Fearing that one might not fully believe this, another analogy is given: For example, the rhinoceros’s horn originally has no moon’s form; only because the rhinoceros gazes at the moon does the perception and discernment of the moon arise, and the moon’s form enters the horn. Yet the true moon in the sky was never in the horn. Thus it is said, "Perception and discernment are like a rhinoceros gazing at the moon: the moon’s form enters the horn, and only because of discernment does the moon’s form appear. Yet the true moon was never in the horn."

The myriad things in the heart’s realm are likewise. One who understands this teaching sees nothing externally and feels no emotions internally. The perceptions of the myriad things in the heart’s realm are like the rhinoceros gazing at the moon, with the moon’s form entering its horn. Thus it is said, "The myriad things in the heart’s realm are likewise." One who comprehends the above analogies externally sees no things and internally feels no emotions. This chapter clarifies that the wondrous heart originally has no emotions or discernments; all arise from the heart’s delusion, which falsely generates emotions and discernments.

**Chapter Ten**
Guan Yinzi said: Things arise from earth and ultimately return to earth. Affairs arise from intention and ultimately return to intention. The myriad things arise from earth, and when they finally perish, they transform back into earth. Thus it is said, "Things arise from earth and ultimately return to earth." This is the analogy. Earth corresponds to the intention of the spleen’s spirit. The myriad affairs arise from intention, and when all are forgotten, they ultimately return to intention. Thus it is said, "Affairs arise from intention and ultimately return to intention." This is the application of the analogy.

Knowing that all depends on intention, then in an instant it affirms, in an instant it denies, in an instant it deems good, in an instant it deems evil. Intention changes, but the heart does not change; intention is aware, but the heart is not aware. As explained in the above analogies, one knows that the existence or non-existence of all affairs depends solely on this root of intention. Knowing the affairs generated by this root of intention, in a fleeting moment, non-being transforms into being, being into non-being, evil into good, good into evil. Thus it is said, "Knowing that all depends on intention, then in an instant it affirms, in an instant it denies, in an instant it deems good, in an instant it deems evil." The root of intention undergoes change, but the wondrous heart originally does not change; the root of intention has awareness, but the wondrous heart originally has no awareness. Thus it is said, "Intention changes, but the heart does not change; intention is aware, but the heart is not aware."

Only my singular heart exists, for intention is merely the coming and going of dust, and affairs are merely the swift arising and ceasing of phenomena. My heart abides in the great constancy. The wondrous heart is originally non-dual, thus it is said, "Only my singular heart exists." "Dust" refers to phenomena. The root of intention can generate and extinguish the myriad phenomena: when extinguished, it departs; when generated, it arrives. Thus it is said, "Intention is merely the coming and going of dust." If the root of intention does not generate affairs, it is like fire burning firewood: it flares up swiftly, and when the firewood is consumed, it swiftly ceases. Thus it is said, "Affairs are merely the swift arising and ceasing of phenomena." "Swift" means rapid. The "great constancy" is the true emptiness of the wondrous heart’s essence, boundless and without limit, transcending past and present without change. What else could abide but this? Thus it is said, "My heart abides in the great constancy."

This chapter elucidates the great constancy of the heart governing the minor transformations of intention.

**Chapter Eleven**
Master Guan Yin said: Emotions arise from the heart, the heart arises from nature. Emotions are waves, the heart is the current, nature is water. Human delusion and emotions are born from the heart, and the heart is born from nature—thus it is said, "Emotions arise from the heart, the heart arises from nature." When people are deluded, emotions resemble the waves of water; the heart that pursues external states is like flowing water; the original nature of humans is like the source of water. Waves, currents, and source have three names but no dual substance, for waves, currents, and source are all water. Emotions, heart, and nature have three names but no dual substance, for emotions, heart, and nature are all true—thus it is said, "Emotions are waves, the heart is the current, nature is water."

What comes to disturb me is like the fleeting spark of flint. If received with nature, the heart does not arise, and phenomena float lightly. When the myriad things come to disturb me, it is but a momentary flash, like the spark of flint or lightning. If received with the true emptiness of nature, the heart does not arise, and the perception of phenomena floats lightly, like clouds in the vast sky, unobstructing the void, or like an echo in an empty valley, responding yet ever tranquil—thus it is said, "What comes to disturb me is like the fleeting spark of flint. If received with nature, the heart does not arise, and phenomena float lightly."

This chapter elucidates the non-duality of heart and nature, responding without obstruction.

**Chapter Twelve**
Master Guan Yin said: Worthies and fools, the true and the false—some recognize them, some do not. In the world, there are true worthies and true fools, false worthies and false fools. Some people can discern them, while others cannot—thus it is said, "Worthies and fools, the true and the false—some recognize them, some do not." Though they may be worthy or foolish, true or false, what is called worthy or foolish, true or false, is bound to my perception. Though the world may have worthies and fools, the true and the false, the distinction between them depends on my deluded perception—thus it is said, "Though they may be worthy or foolish, true or false, what is called worthy or foolish, true or false, is bound to my perception." Knowing that all are formed by perception, even what is true is thereby false. If one knows that the distinction between worthies and fools, the true and the false, is formed by deluded perception, and perception itself is delusion, then even what is true is named false and unreal—thus it is said, "Knowing that all are formed by perception, even what is true is thereby false."

This chapter elucidates that deluded perception is not the true heart.

**Chapter Thirteen**
Master Guan Yin said: When the heart responds to phenomena, it does not generate the heart but generates emotions. When phenomena interact with the heart, they do not generate phenomena but generate perception. Phenomena are not yet real—how much less perception? Perception is not yet real—how much less emotions? The originally wondrous heart is inherently pure and still. When moved by phenomena, the heart itself does not arise—what arises are emotions—thus it is said, "When the heart responds to phenomena, it does not generate the heart but generates emotions." When all phenomena come to interact with the heart, what the heart transforms in response to phenomena is not phenomena but the heart’s perception—thus it is said, "When phenomena interact with the heart, they do not generate phenomena but generate perception." All phenomena are illusory arising and ceasing, still fundamentally unreal—how much more perception? How could it not be delusion and falsehood?—thus it is said, "Phenomena are not yet real—how much less perception?" Since perception is delusion and falsehood, how much more emotions? How could they not be delusion?—thus it is said, "Perception is not yet real—how much less emotions?"

Yet those deluded people, in the midst of utmost emptiness, cling to it as existence; in the midst of utmost change, they cling to it as constancy. Those deluded and confused people, in the midst of the originally true and wondrous heart where not a single thing exists, suddenly generate deluded perception, stubbornly grasping it as real, clinging and unable to relinquish, failing to illuminate the original heart—thus it is said, "Yet those deluded people, in the midst of utmost emptiness, cling to it as existence." Those deluded and confused people, in the midst of perception that ceaselessly arises and ceases, chasing external states and endlessly transforming, stubbornly grasp it as the great constancy of the original heart—alas! Little do they know that this deluded perception is the seed of samsara—thus it is said, "In the midst of utmost change, they cling to it as constancy."

One deluded emotion, when recognized, accumulates into ten thousand emotions; ten thousand emotions, when recognized, accumulate into ten thousand things. Phenomena come endlessly, yet my heart has bounds. From the originally pure and wondrous heart, a single deluded emotion suddenly arises, unrecognized as false and taken as real. Emotions then multiply endlessly, one after another, accumulating into billions of emotions—thus it is said, "One deluded emotion, when recognized, accumulates into ten thousand emotions." The deluded person, amidst billions of emotions, still fails to recognize their falsity, taking delusion as truth, clinging to phenomena, thoughts shifting ceaselessly, waves of emotions vast and boundless, accumulating into billions of phenomena—thus it is said, "Ten thousand emotions, when recognized, accumulate into ten thousand things." Bounds refer to boundaries. The originally wondrous heart is like empty space, boundless and without limit. Yet deluded perception and emotions usurp control, falsely dividing the void, establishing boundaries and limits, deludedly clinging to the myriad phenomena, endlessly chasing their transformations—thus it is said, "Phenomena come endlessly, yet my heart has bounds."

Thus my good heart is controlled by emotions, and my original emotions are controlled by phenomena. They can be made to depart, they can be made to arrive. The heart, deluded and chasing emotions, establishes boundaries, not following the enlightened and wondrous heart but driven solely by deluded emotions—thus the originally good and wondrous heart is instead controlled by deluded emotions, like a minister rebelling to control the ruler—thus it is said, "Thus my good heart is controlled by emotions." My original true emotions, once deluded and clinging to the myriad phenomena, are instead driven by them—thus the original true emotions are controlled by phenomena, like the people rebelling to control the minister—thus it is said, "My original emotions are controlled by phenomena."

The heart, deluded, chases emotions; emotions, deluded, cling to phenomena. Deluded emotions falsely cling to the realm of phenomena, binding one until death, then drawn by the pull of love and attachment to phenomena, reborn where attachment is heaviest. Thus, life after life, death after death, for hundreds of thousands of kalpas in the wheel of rebirth, with no end in sight, ceaselessly departing and arriving—hence it is said, "They can be made to depart, they can be made to arrive."

Yet this departing and arriving does not originate from me; the workings of creation enslave them, without respite. The five emotions of humans correspond to the five phases: joy belongs to fire, anger to wood, thought to earth, sorrow to metal, and fear to water. Since the five emotions correspond to the five phases, and the five phases with yin and yang create and shape the myriad things of heaven and earth, they drive and enslave the cycles of death and life, departure and arrival, without end. Investigating the cause, all this arises from the delusion of the five emotions—had the five emotions not yet arisen, how could there be death and life, departure and arrival? From this, one knows that this departing and arriving does not originate from me but arises from deluded emotions falsely clinging, falling into the molding of the five phases and creation, enslaved in the wheel of rebirth without respite—hence it is said, "Yet this departing and arriving does not originate from me; the workings of creation enslave them, without respite."

Little does one know that though heaven and earth are vast, they can enslave the formed but cannot enslave the formless; though yin and yang are wondrous, they can enslave the qi-endowed but cannot enslave the qi-less. The deluded, falsely clinging to realms of attachment, are enslaved by the workings of heaven and earth and yin and yang, endlessly revolving—yet little do they know that before deluded emotions arose, the originally wondrous heart was like empty space, formless. Though heaven and earth and the workings of yin and yang are vast, they can only enslave deluded, formed emotions—how could they enslave the wondrous heart like empty space? Hence it is said, "Little does one know that though heaven and earth are vast, they can enslave the formed but cannot enslave the formless."

Once deluded emotions arise, primordial qi follows, and one falls into the enslavement of yin-yang creation and the wheel of rebirth. Before deluded emotions arise, primordial qi returns to its root, becoming one with true emptiness—though yin and yang and creation are wondrous, how could they enslave true emptiness? Hence it is said, "Though yin and yang are wondrous, they can enslave the qi-endowed but cannot enslave the qi-less."

Where the heart goes, qi follows; where qi goes, form responds. "Goes" means to proceed. Where the heart proceeds, qi follows in proceeding—like a general, the heart commands, and qi, like an army, obeys, following the general. Thus it is said, "Where the heart goes, qi follows." When the heart is deluded by false love, clinging to various realms, qi follows, giving rise to this rebirth-bound body and form—hence it is said, "Where qi goes, form responds."

It is like the great void: from perfect nothingness, it transforms into one qi; within that one qi, it transforms into the myriad things. Yet that one qi is not called the great void. The Dao is originally nameless and formless, like the great void, yet it moves one qi. One qi divides into yin and yang, and from yin and yang, heaven and earth and the myriad things transform. Once named one qi, it is no longer called the great void—what is formless is named the Dao, let alone the myriad things. Hence it is said, "It is like the great void: from perfect nothingness, it transforms into one qi; within that one qi, it transforms into the myriad things. Yet that one qi is not called the great void." This is the analogy.

My single heart can transform into qi and form, yet my heart is without qi and without form. My originally wondrous heart takes true emptiness as its essence. Before thoughts arise, its essence is like the great void; once thoughts arise, where it goes, qi follows, and where qi goes, form responds—like the great void transforming into one qi, and within that one qi, transforming into the myriad things. Hence it is said, "My single heart can transform into qi and form." Before thoughts arise, the originally wondrous heart is fundamentally without qi and without form—hence it is said, "Yet my heart is without qi and without form."

Knowing that my single heart is without qi and without form, then heaven and earth and yin and yang cannot enslave it. "Knowing" means awakening. Awakening to the originally non-dual wondrous heart is like the great void before it transformed into qi and form, before there were heaven and earth and yin and yang—whom could they enslave? Even if there were heaven and earth and yin and yang, how could they enslave empty space? Hence it is said, "Knowing that my single heart is without qi and without form, then heaven and earth and yin and yang cannot enslave it."

This chapter clarifies that when the heart is deluded and falls, it is molded by yin and yang and ceaselessly revolves; when the heart awakens and transcends the molding of yin and yang, it is forever free from the wheel of rebirth.

**Chapter Fourteen**

Guan Yinzi said: In a person’s ordinary days, if the eyes suddenly see extraordinary things, it is always because essence has congealed with them to bring about such changes. In a person’s ordinary, peaceful days, if the eyes suddenly see extraordinary and strange phenomena, it is always because spirit has congealed with those phenomena, suddenly causing such strange transformations—hence it is said, "In a person’s ordinary days, if the eyes suddenly see extraordinary things, it is always because essence has congealed with them to bring about such changes."

In a person’s sick days, if the eyes suddenly see extraordinary things, it is always because the heart is deficient and brings about such changes. In a person’s feverish, ailing days, burned by heat and seeing illusions, if the eyes suddenly see extraordinary and strange phenomena, it is always because the heat of illness burns and the heart’s deficiency causes it—hence it is said, "In a person’s sick days, if the eyes suddenly see extraordinary things, it is always because the heart is deficient and brings about such changes." "Deficient" means insufficient.

If one knows that my heart can manifest being from non-being, then one knows that my heart can manifest non-being from being.

If "if" means recognition, then "know" means awakening. As stated above, whether in ordinary days or sick days, when the eyes suddenly see extraordinary things, one truly awakens to the fact that the wondrous original heart is fundamentally empty of any thing, equal to the great void—all extraordinary existences are manifested from non-being. Through this awakening, one realizes that even these extraordinary existences reveal the wondrous heart originally empty of things. Thus it is said: "If one knows that my heart can manifest being from non-being, then one knows that my heart can manifest non-being from being."

Yet if one does not believe, it naturally loses its numinosity. Some may ask: "If one’s consciousness is already clouded, who can avoid belief?" I reply: Just as a snake-catcher’s heart does not fear snakes, though he dreams of them, he feels no dread. If in ordinary days or sick days the eyes suddenly see extraordinary ghosts, spirits, or strange phenomena, one should awaken to the fact that the original heart is fundamentally pure and empty of any thing—all forms of existence are illusory. Thus one becomes clear and does not believe or cling, and those strange phenomena naturally lose their numinous power. Hence it is said: "If one does not believe, it naturally loses its numinosity." "Clouded" means obscured; "who" means which person. Someone may ask: "If one’s consciousness is already darkened and deluded, seeing extraordinary spirits and strange phenomena, who can avoid belief?" This is a rhetorical question. The answer is: Just as a snake-catcher, who uses methods to control snakes, is unafraid when catching them, though he dreams of snakes in sleep, he feels no fear. Through this clarity, one knows that if one does not believe, it naturally loses its numinosity. Thus it is said: "I reply: Just as a snake-catcher’s heart does not fear snakes, though he dreams of them, he feels no dread." This answers the above question.

Therefore, the Yellow Emperor said: "The Dao has no ghosts or spirits; it moves alone, comes and goes alone." Using the snake-catcher as a metaphor to answer the questioner, fearing they might not fully grasp it, the text also cites the words recorded in the Yellow Emperor’s book as evidence. In the Yellow Emperor’s book, it is said that the Dao has no ghosts or spirits—ghosts belong to yin, spirits to yang, but the wondrous Dao does not belong to yin or yang, hence it has no ghosts or spirits. Even if ghosts and spirits exist, they cannot fathom the wondrous Dao. The wondrous Dao operates and turns, with yin and yang coming and going, yet yin and yang cannot pair with the Dao. Thus it is said: "Therefore, the Yellow Emperor said: 'The Dao has no ghosts or spirits; it moves alone, comes and goes alone.'" This chapter clarifies that by following the flow, one attains the wondrous heart and awakens to the wondrous Dao, which ghosts and spirits cannot measure.

**Chapter Fifteen**
Guan Yinzi said: "My thoughts change daily, driven by something—not by me, but by fate. If one knows it is only fate, externally one does not see the self, and internally one does not see the heart." I am originally without self, but false consciousness establishes it. Thoughts bustle about, changing daily in myriad ways—this is not the self without self, but the transformations of fate, which arise without knowing why. Thus it is said: "My thoughts change daily, driven by something—not by me, but by fate." "Fate" means arising without knowing why; "driven" means transformation. If one truly awakens to the fact that things arise without knowing why, this is the Dao of true emptiness. Fate is another name for the Dao. Awakening to the Dao of true emptiness, externally there is no self to be seen, and internally there is no heart to be seen. Thus it is said: "If one knows it is only fate, externally one does not see the self, and internally one does not see the heart." This chapter clarifies that the heart is originally empty, and the Dao cannot be reached by thoughts.

**Chapter Sixteen**
Guan Yinzi said: "For example, the two eyes can see all things under heaven, but if the light is momentarily withdrawn, nothing is seen." The true empty essence of the heart is fundamentally without a single thing, profound and unfathomable. When false thoughts suddenly arise, what is seen becomes clear. Returning the light to true emptiness is like a person’s two eyes, which can see the forms of all things under heaven, but if the gaze is momentarily withdrawn, nothing is seen. Thus it is said: "For example, the two eyes can see all things under heaven, but if the light is momentarily withdrawn, nothing is seen." This chapter explains the previous chapter’s statement that thoughts change daily, driven by fate.

**Chapter Seventeen**
Guan Yinzi said: "The eyes that gaze upon carvings injure their clarity; the ears that hear harmonious sounds injure their acuity; the heart that contemplates the mysterious injures itself." Eyes that see clearly are called "bright"; if they fixate on intricate carvings of gold, jade, or fine patterns for too long, their brightness is increasingly harmed. The scriptures say: "The five colors blind the eyes." Thus it is said: "The eyes that gaze upon carvings injure their clarity." Ears that hear clearly are called "acute"; if they fixate on the harmonious sounds of the five tones for too long, their acuity is increasingly harmed. The scriptures say: "The five sounds deafen the ears." Thus it is said: "The ears that hear harmonious sounds injure their acuity." The mysterious and wondrous are dust. The heart is fundamentally pure and empty of any dharma—this is the source of the mysterious. Not awakening to the original heart, one fixates on the mysterious teachings of the ancients, not realizing that these mysterious teachings are all dust and defilement, increasingly polluting and harming the heart. The scriptures say: "Cleanse the mysterious mirror." Thus it is said: "The heart that contemplates the mysterious injures itself." This chapter clarifies that the wondrous original heart does not belong to the six dusts.

**Chapter Eighteen**
Guan Yinzi said: "Do not measure others with your own heart; measure others with their own hearts." "Do not" is a prohibitive term; "measure" means to estimate or gauge. This admonishes those who study the Dao and wander in the world: do not use your own heart to estimate others. When employing people, one should respond to their worthiness with worthiness and to their foolishness with foolishness. In this way, one advances or retreats with others without losing their hearts. Thus it is said: "Do not measure others with your own heart; measure others with their own hearts."

One who comprehends this teaching may perfect all affairs, practice virtue universally, penetrate the Dao, befriend all people, and forget the self. When one knows this heartless state and responds to others’ worthiness or foolishness with their own measure—advancing or retreating without intent—then worthiness and foolishness, advance and retreat, arise without losing the hearts of others. Thus, what affair would not be perfectly managed? What virtue would not be universally practiced? What Dao would not be fully penetrated? What person would not become a friend? What self would not be forgotten? For in the single method of illuminating the heart, all is perfectly good and beautiful. Therefore it is said: "One who comprehends this teaching may perfect all affairs, practice virtue universally, penetrate the Dao, befriend all people, and forget the self." This chapter clarifies that dwelling in the world without intent brings self-benefit and benefits others, and all excellences follow therefrom.

**Chapter Nineteen**

Guan Yinzi said: "The principles of the world begin with the small that, if unchecked, grow to the great; the great, if unchecked, grow to the ungovernable." All matters and principles under heaven, like water and fire, if a trickle is not stopped, gradually becomes a river; if a spark is not extinguished, it blazes beyond control. Just as stacked wood forms a forest and piled stones become a mountain, accumulated evil becomes disaster—how can one not be cautious! Therefore it is said: "The principles of the world begin with the small that, if unchecked, grow to the great; the great, if unchecked, grow to the ungovernable."

Thus, one who can govern a single emotion may cultivate virtue; one who can forget a single emotion may merge with the Dao. "Thus" connects the preceding to what follows; "govern" means to regulate. If one can regulate an emotion at its first arising, directing it toward goodness, one may thereby perfect virtue—hence it is said: "One who can govern a single emotion may cultivate virtue." If one can clearly perceive and dissolve an emotion at its first arising, one merges with the boundless wondrous Dao—hence it is said: "One who can forget a single emotion may merge with the Dao." This chapter clarifies that the distinction between the ordinary and the sage lies in the delusion or awakening of a single emotion.

**Chapter Six: The Ladle**

The ladle (匕) is for eating; eating sustains form. This chapter comprises sixteen sections.

Master Guan Yin said: The people of the world distinguish self-thought from other-thought, other-thought from self-thought, thereby dividing self and other. Yet they do not realize that in dreams, too, self-thought differs from other-thought, and other-thought differs from self-thought—who then is the self, and who the other? "Other" refers to people.

The deluded of the world take their own thoughts as distinct from others' thoughts, believing others' thoughts differ from their own. Thus they separate self and other, vainly generating views. Yet they do not know that such vain distinctions of thought between self and other are but the celestial truth following deluded thoughts to fabricate dreams. Not only are nighttime sleep-dreams dreams—even in broad daylight, when nature follows deluded thoughts, all is dream. How can one claim that the thoughts and dreams of the dreaming differ from the objects of thought and dream, when the very act of thinking and dreaming remains unchanged? From this, who is the self, and who the other?

Thus it is said: The people of the world distinguish self-thought from other-thought, other-thought from self-thought—who then is the self, and who the other?

The people of the world distinguish their own pain from others' pain, others' pain from their own, thereby dividing self and other. Yet they do not realize that in dreams, too, their own pain differs from others' pain, and others' pain differs from their own—who then is the self, and who the other?

The deluded of the world take their own pain as distinct. For instance, when two people receive moxibustion, though the sites differ, the pain is the same. How can one vainly distinguish self and other by pain? Yet they do not know that in dreams, too, pain is taken as distinct. Upon awakening, however, there is no other person. Thus one realizes that dream-pain is deluded perception, and daytime pain is likewise deluded perception. From this, who is the self, and who the other?

Thus it is said: The people of the world distinguish their own pain from others' pain, others' pain from their own, thereby dividing self and other. Yet they do not realize that in dreams, too, their own pain differs from others' pain, and others' pain differs from their own—who then is the self, and who the other?

Nails and hair feel no pain; hands and feet form no thoughts—yet they are also the self. How can one distinguish self and other by thought and pain?

Having first explained that thought and pain are equally illusory and indistinct, lest one fail to believe, further analogies are given for clarity. For example, a person’s nails and hair feel no pain when cut, and hands and feet form no thoughts—yet nails, hair, hands, and feet all belong to the self. How can one vainly distinguish self and other by thought and pain?

Thus it is said: Nails and hair feel no pain; hands and feet form no thoughts—yet they are also the self. How can one distinguish self and other by thought and pain?

The people of the world take solitary visions as dreams and shared visions as wakefulness. Yet they do not know that when essence congeals, there are those who alone see visions in broad daylight; when spirits merge, there are those who share dreams at night. Both arise from the self’s spirit—who then is dreaming, and who is awake?

The deluded of the world take visions seen alone, unseen by others, as dreams, and visions seen by all as wakefulness. Thus it is said: The people of the world take solitary visions as dreams and shared visions as wakefulness.

Yet they do not know that when a person’s essence congeals with things, even in broad daylight, extraordinary visions may appear, unseen by others, visible only to the self. From this, one knows that not only night-dreams are dreams. Thus it is said: Yet they do not know that when essence congeals, there are those who alone see visions in broad daylight.

When one’s spirit merges with another’s, two people may share a dream at night. From this, one knows that shared visions are not necessarily wakefulness. Thus it is said: When spirits merge, there are those who share dreams at night.

Essence congealing produces solitary visions; spirits merging produce shared visions. Both arise from the self’s spirit transforming, vainly generating distinctions of sameness and difference. From this, who is dreaming, and who is awake? Dreams are deluded dreams; wakefulness is deluded wakefulness. Both dream and wakefulness are delusion—what distinction is there between self and other?

Thus it is said: Both arise from the self’s spirit—who then is dreaming, and who is awake?

The people of the world take fleeting visions as dreams and enduring visions as wakefulness. Yet they do not know that fleeting visions arise from the qi of yin and yang, and enduring visions likewise arise from the qi of yin and yang. Both arise from the self’s yin and yang—who then is dreaming, and who is awake?

The deluded of the world take nightly fleeting visions as dreams and daily enduring visions as wakefulness. Thus it is said: The people of the world take fleeting visions as dreams and enduring visions as wakefulness.

Yet they do not know that the fleeting visions of night-dreams are transformations of the spirit, hun, po, and the qi of yin and yang, while the enduring visions of daylight are likewise deluded perceptions of form and dust arising from the spirit, hun, po, and the qi of yin and yang. Thus it is said: Yet they do not know that fleeting visions arise from the qi of yin and yang, and enduring visions likewise arise from the qi of yin and yang.

Fleeting and enduring visions both arise from the transformations of the spirit and the qi of yin and yang. Since perceptions are deluded, neither wakefulness nor dreams are real. From this, who is dreaming, and who is awake? Only one who has attained true wakefulness knows this deluded wakefulness and dreaming.

Thus it is said: Both arise from the self’s yin and yang—who then is dreaming, and who is awake?

This chapter clarifies that the deluded take both dreams and wakefulness as delusion.

**First Section**
Master Guan Yin said: Those who delight in benevolence often dream of pines, wutong, peaches, and plums; those who delight in righteousness often dream of weapons, blades, gold, and iron; those who delight in propriety often dream of ritual vessels and sacrificial stands; those who delight in wisdom often dream of rivers, lakes, streams, and marshes; those who delight in trustworthiness often dream of mountains, peaks, plains, and fields. Bound by the five phases, there has never been an exception.

**Second Section**

Virtue pertains to wood; those who devote themselves to benevolence often dream in their spirit-awareness of pines, wutong, peaches, and plums—hence it is said that those who delight in benevolence often dream of pines, wutong, peaches, and plums. Righteousness pertains to metal; those who devote themselves to righteousness often dream in their spirit-awareness of weapons, blades, gold, and iron—hence it is said that those who delight in righteousness often dream of weapons, blades, gold, and iron. Propriety pertains to fire; propriety is ritual order. Those who devote themselves to ritual conduct often dream in their spirit-awareness of raging wildfires or of sacrificial vessels and ritual implements—hence it is said that those who delight in propriety often dream of *gai*, *jian*, *peng*, and *dou*. The *gai* is made of bamboo, round both inside and out; the *jian* is made of bamboo, round outside and square within; the *peng* is square outside and round within, used to hold dry offerings; the *dou* is made of wood, used to hold wet offerings. All four are lacquered red, corresponding to the color of fire. Wisdom pertains to water; those who devote themselves to wisdom to discern truth and falsehood often dream in their spirit-awareness of rivers, lakes, and marshes—hence it is said that those who delight in wisdom often dream of rivers, lakes, streams, and marshes. Trustworthiness pertains to earth; those who devote themselves to sincerity and truthfulness often dream in their spirit-awareness of mountains, peaks, plains, and fields—hence it is said that those who delight in trustworthiness often dream of mountains, peaks, plains, and fields. Thus, those who devote themselves to benevolence (wood), righteousness (metal), propriety (fire), wisdom (water), and trustworthiness (earth) are bound by the Five Constants and dream of these Five Phases in their partiality—hence it is said, "thus."

In dreams, one may hear of some matter or think of some matter, and the dream follows accordingly—the Five Phases cannot be rigidly confined. By day, one indulges in deluded thoughts; by night, in deluded dreams. In the midst of dreaming, one may suddenly hear of some matter or think of some matter, and as the mind chases after shifting circumstances, the dream follows accordingly. This is because the mind is partial to the Five Phases; if the mind were not partial, the Five Phases could not be rigidly confined. Hence it is said: "In dreams, one may hear of some matter or think of some matter, and the dream follows accordingly—the Five Phases cannot be rigidly confined."

The sage governs things with the mind and restrains the mind with nature, so that the mind merges with the workings of creation, and the Five Phases cannot be rigidly confined. To "govern things" is to employ them. The sage takes the true emptiness of nature as the substance of the mind and the wondrous existence of things as its function. Substance and function are thus in harmony, responding to change while remaining ever tranquil. Above, the sage roams with the Creator; below, befriends those beyond birth and death, without beginning or end. Thus, yin and yang and the Five Phases cannot be rigidly confined. "Creation" refers to the Creator. Hence it is said: "The sage governs things with the mind and restrains the mind with nature, so that the mind merges with the workings of creation, and the Five Phases cannot be rigidly confined." To "govern things with the mind" is to employ the mind in governing things as its function; to "restrain the mind with nature" is to return the mind to the true emptiness of nature as its substance.

This chapter clarifies that when the mind is deluded, it is bound by the Five Phases; when the mind is enlightened, it transcends the confinement of the Five Phases.

**Third Section**

Master Guan Yin said: When you see those with the head of a serpent and the body of a human, or the arms of an ox and the scales of a fish, or the form of a ghost and the wings of a bird, do not be astonished. "You" refers to people in the world. Among the people of the world, some may see humans born with heads resembling serpents and human bodies, or arms like oxen with scales like fish, or forms like ghosts with wings like birds under their arms—let the people of the world not be astonished. For instance, the ancient Fu Xi had the body of a serpent and the head of a human; Shen Nong had the head of an ox and the body of a human; and the ghost-faced General Cen Peng—these are well known in the Central Kingdom. As Dongfang Shuo recorded of the barbarian peoples: In the northwest wastes, there are humans whose faces, eyes, hands, and feet resemble ours, yet they have wings under their arms and cannot fly. In the southwest wastes, there are humans with body hair and pig heads. In the northeast wastes, there are humans with red hair, serpent bodies, and human faces, but no hands or feet. In the southern wastes, there are humans with beaks like crows, wings, and the ability to fly, but no feet. In the western wastes, there are humans like tigers, with long fur, human faces, tiger feet, and wolf teeth, with tails eighteen feet long. In the northwest wastes, there are also humans shaped like tigers who eat people, with wings and the ability to fly, who understand human speech. All these arise from the chaotic and perverse qi of yin and yang, resulting in extraordinary forms—how could they be considered strange? Hence it is said: "When you see those with the head of a serpent and the body of a human, or the arms of an ox and the scales of a fish, or the form of a ghost and the wings of a bird, do not be astonished."

Such anomalies are not as strange as dreams; the strangeness of dreams is not as strange as wakefulness. With ears and eyes, hands and arms, the strangeness is even greater. The extraordinary forms mentioned above are not worth marveling at—such anomalies are not as strange as dreams. Consider this single person: when asleep, they dream of all manner of strange realms—people, heaven and earth, mountains and rivers, grasses and trees, towers and pavilions, birds and beasts—sometimes auspicious and wondrous, yet upon waking, all is empty. What is this thing that can conjure such dream realms? This is truly strange—hence it is said, "such anomalies are not as strange as dreams." Upon waking, one sees a person as a lump of flesh, with ears that can hear sounds, eyes that can see colors, hands that can grasp objects, and arms that can move—yet without any threads to pull them, who is in control? How can they act so precisely and appropriately? This strangeness is even greater, yet the people of the world do not find it strange. Hence it is said: "The strangeness of dreams is not as strange as wakefulness. With ears and eyes, hands and arms, the strangeness is even greater."

Great speech cannot be spoken; great wisdom cannot be thought. Tracing the source of the six senses, one finds the nameless, passionless Dao of true emptiness and wondrous existence. Nameless, thus great speech cannot be spoken; passionless, thus great wisdom cannot be thought. One must awaken to this before the arising of words or thoughts, when the mind opens in sudden clarity, and one understands that the great constancy governs all minor changes. Then even the anomalies previously considered strange are not truly so—hence it is said: "Great speech cannot be spoken; great wisdom cannot be thought."

This chapter elucidates how the great constancy governs all minor changes, yet the common people employ it daily without awareness.

**Chapter Three**
Master Guan Yin said: Someone asked me, "What is your clan, what is your family name? What is your given name, what is your courtesy name? What do you wear, what do you eat? Who are your friends, who are your servants? What zither do you play, what books do you read? What ancient principles do you follow, what present affairs do you attend to?"

At that time, I remained silent and did not utter a single word.

Another asked, "What is the surname of your lineage, what is your taboo name, what virtue does your courtesy name express?"—thus repeating the question: "What is your clan, what is your name, what is your courtesy name?"

Again, they asked: "What clothes do you wear, what food do you eat? With whom do you keep company, whom do you employ as servants? What kind of zither do you play, what kind of books do you read? Whose ancient principles do you emulate, whose present affairs do you follow?"

I remained silent and did not answer a single word, for this silently conveyed the teaching of non-utterance. Thus it is said: "What do you wear, what do you eat? Who are your friends, who are your servants? What zither do you play, what books do you read? What ancient principles do you follow, what present affairs do you attend to?" At that time, I remained silent and did not utter a single word.

When the questioner persisted without cease, I could not but respond: "You do not even see yourself—what could be mine?"

This subtly revealed the mechanism beyond, yet the person did not awaken. When pressed further, I could not but reply: "You do not even see yourself—what could truly belong to me in the realm of true emptiness?" Thus it is said: "You do not even see yourself—what could be mine?"

**Chapter Four**
Master Guan Yin said: Form may be divided or united, extended or concealed. A man and a woman may bear two children—form may be divided. A man and a woman may together produce one child—form may be united. Consuming *jusheng* prolongs life—form may be extended. On a moonless night without firelight, one cannot see me—form may be concealed.

Those who deeply attain the Dao have bones and flesh wholly fused, form and spirit perfectly merged. They may divide into countless millions without insufficiency, or unite into one without excess. Their form endures for eternal kalpas—thus form may be extended. Profound and unfathomable, their form may be concealed. Thus it is said: form may be divided or united, extended or concealed.

Fearing that people might not fully grasp this, I illustrate it with mundane analogies. In the world, a man and a woman may bear twins—this is the image of form being divided. A man and a woman may unite to produce one child—this is the image of form being united. Consuming *jusheng* seeds prolongs life—this is the image of form being extended. On a moonless night without firelight, one cannot see another—this is the image of form being concealed. Thus it is said: a man and a woman may bear two children—form may be divided; a man and a woman may together produce one child—form may be united; consuming *jusheng* prolongs life—form may be extended; on a moonless night without firelight, one cannot see me—form may be concealed.

*Jusheng*: The smaller variety is called sesame; the larger, *jusheng*. It grows in the wilds of Shangdang County in Youzhou, reaching over three feet in height. Its seeds resemble those of the *niubang* but are smaller, dark greenish-black. They are harvested in the eighth month. Immortals prepare them as food to attain longevity. In ancient times, Han Zhong consumed them and lived for a hundred years; with prolonged use, his lifespan extended to a thousand, and none knew its end.

The one qi generates the myriad things, like hair that may be replaced—thus form may be divided. The one qi unites the myriad things, like a cleft lip that may be mended—thus form may be united. Spirit preserves qi, qi preserves form—thus form may be extended. Uniting form with spirit, spirit with the formless—thus form may be concealed.

Do you wish to know this? Do you wish to practice it?

Having previously employed common analogies to enlighten the learner, I now reveal the true and wondrous workings of the Dao.

Those who deeply attain the Dao achieve perfection in both form and spirit, their transformations unfathomable. Through the one qi, they generate countless forms, like human hair that falls and regrows endlessly—this is the principle of form’s divisibility. Thus it is said: “With the one qi, the myriad things are born, like discarded hair that may be replaced—hence form may be divided.”

Gathering the countless forms born of the one qi, they reunite them into a single body, just as a cleft lip may be mended to restore wholeness—this is the principle of form’s reunification. Thus it is said: “With the one qi, the myriad things are united, like a cleft lip that may be mended—hence form may be united.”

By preserving the spirit in its non-spiritual state—empty, still, and profoundly serene—the primordial qi remains harmonious and undiminished. Over time, both form and spirit attain perfection, and one achieves immortality. This is the principle of form’s extension. Thus it is said: “Spirit preserves qi, qi preserves form—hence form may be extended.”

Uniting form with spirit, and spirit with the boundless, wondrous Dao, one becomes obscure and invisible, beyond the perception of gods or demons, beyond the reckoning of yin and yang. This is the principle of form’s concealment. Thus it is said: “Unite form with spirit, spirit with the formless—hence form may be concealed.”

O learner, do you wish to know this wondrous Dao? Do you delight in practicing it? This Dao cannot be grasped by knowledge, nor attained through deliberate action—it lies solely in the heart’s silent comprehension. Thus it is said: “Do you wish to know it? Do you wish to practice it?” This chapter clarifies that for the enlightened, division, union, extension, and concealment of form present no obstacle.

**Chapter Five**
Guan Yinzi said: There is nothing that cannot be seen—thus nothing is not my seeing. There is nothing that cannot be heard—thus nothing is not my hearing.

The forms of all things in the world are but the dust of color. When the eye of Dao opens wide, nothing remains unseen, and every seeing is the Dao. Thus it is said: “There is nothing that cannot be seen—thus nothing is not my seeing.”

The sounds of all things in the world are but the dust of noise. When the ear of heaven opens wide, no sound goes unheard, and every hearing is the Dao. Thus it is said: “There is nothing that cannot be heard—thus nothing is not my hearing.”

The five grains nourish the form, and nothing is not my form. The five flavors nourish qi, and nothing is not my qi. Therefore, my form and qi are the ten thousand things of heaven and earth.

The five phases shift and transform, yin and yang create and evolve, giving rise to the five grains—awned, husked, bearded, pointed, and eared—to nourish the human form. The forms of the ten thousand things in heaven and earth arise from the creation and transformation of yin, yang, and the five phases, and my form likewise arises from them. From this perspective, nothing in heaven and earth is not my form. Thus it is said: “The five grains nourish the form, and nothing is not my form.”

Through the qi of the five phases, the five flavors—sour, salty, sweet, acrid, and bitter—are created and transformed. When people consume them, they preserve and nourish the qi of the five viscera. All things arise from the qi of the five phases, and my body likewise arises from it. From this perspective, nothing is not my qi. As stated above, the ten thousand things of heaven and earth are my form and my qi. Thus it is said: “The five flavors nourish qi, and nothing is not my qi.” Therefore, my form and qi are the ten thousand things of heaven and earth.

This chapter clarifies that heaven and earth are born together with me, and the ten thousand things are one with me.

**Chapter Six**
Guan Yinzi said: The plowman who works with oxen becomes coarse; the hunter who works with tigers becomes brave; the fisherman who works with water becomes adept at sinking; the warrior who works with horses becomes agile. The ten thousand things can become me.

Coarseness (*guang*) means wildness—fierce, reckless, and foolish. The plowman who drives oxen for long, staying close to them, adopts their fierce and reckless nature. Thus it is said: “The plowman who works with oxen becomes coarse.”

The hunter who pursues and kills tigers and leopards for long, staying close to them, adopts their brave and fearless nature. Thus it is said: “The hunter who works with tigers becomes brave.”

The fisherman who catches aquatic creatures, staying close to water for long, becomes adept at sinking into it to seize his prey. Thus it is said: “The fisherman who works with water becomes adept at sinking.”

The warrior who rides fine horses for long, staying close to them, adopts their swift and agile nature. Thus it is said: “The warrior who works with horses becomes agile.”

Human nature is originally pure and still, but through long habituation, it becomes stained and attached to the natures of things. As in the examples above—habituation to oxen, tigers, water, and horses—one becomes coarse, brave, adept at sinking, or agile. Is this not the nature of things shaping my own nature? Thus it is said: “The ten thousand things can become me.”

Within my body, internal transformations give rise to *nao* and *hui* worms, while external influences breed lice and fleas. Sores may produce turtles or fish, and ulcers may yield rats. Thus I can become the ten thousand things.

*Nao* are fine worms in the abdomen. *Hui* are large worms in the abdomen, also called *laohao*. They arise from the interaction of yin and yang qi in the foods consumed. Lice and fleas arise from the warmth of clothing and the steam of sweat.

Sores (*ju*) are ulcers. Once, a man developed a sore on his back, from which a turtle gradually emerged, stretching its neck to gnaw at his flesh until he died in agony. Another man developed a sore on his waist, from which a fish emerged, causing unbearable pain with every movement.

Ulcers (*huan*) are also sores. Once, a man developed a sore on his neck, from which a fleshly rat emerged. A monk, annoyed by mantises crawling along the railing, burned them all to ashes. Soon after, he developed a sore that, when lanced, revealed only mantises.

Within the human body, the *nao* and *hui* worms transform; beyond the body, steam and warmth breed lice and fleas. Afflictions give rise to sores, which may become turtles or fish, rats or mantises—these seven creatures. From this we know that I, too, may become all things.

Thus it is said: within my body, *nao* and *hui* arise; without, lice and fleas are born. Sores (*ju*) become turtles and fish; ulcers (*huan*) become rats and mantises. I may become all things.

This chapter clarifies that when there is an "I," things become mine, and I become things; when there is no "I," creation cannot alter me.

**Chapter Seven**
Guan Yinzi said: My "I" is like gold in ash—yet not as gold in ore. Break the ore to obtain gold; sift the sand to obtain gold. But sift the ash for a lifetime, and no gold will be found.

The "I" is the mind that grasps subject and object. The mind is like fire, yet without an "I." It manifests through oil and wick, revealing the form of fire. When oil and wick are exhausted, the fire turns to ash. The mind is originally without an "I"; it appears through conditions. Forget the mind, extinguish the "I" that grasps subject and object—thus it is said, "My 'I' is like gold in ash." If there is no gold in the ash, then the ashen mind has no "I."

Ore is unrefined gold; ore and sand are likened to the six dusts. The six dusts are form, sound, scent, taste, touch, and dharma. "Not as gold in ore" is a metaphor for my mind. To obtain gold, one must seek it in ore and sand—smelt the ore, wash away the sand, and gold is found. But if one merely sifts the ash, even a lifetime of effort yields no gold.

This is a metaphor for the mind, originally without an "I," appearing through the six dusts. To see the mind, observe the six dusts with clarity—awakening follows the flow, and the source is found in the stream. If the six dusts are purified, the mind returns to true emptiness. Even the celestial eye or dragon’s gaze cannot perceive it, let alone ordinary vision. Thus it is said: "Not as gold in ore. Break the ore to obtain gold; sift the sand to obtain gold. But sift the ash for a lifetime, and no gold will be found."

This chapter clarifies that the "I" is originally without an "I," falsely established through conditions.

**Chapter Eight**
Guan Yinzi said: A single bee, though tiny, may roam and observe heaven and earth. A single shrimp, though tiny, may frolic in the vast sea.

The bee and shrimp are metaphors for humans; heaven and earth and the great sea are metaphors for the great Dao. Though the bee and shrimp are small, they may roam heaven and earth and frolic in the sea. Though humans are small, they may comprehend the great Dao—boundless, transcending the finite and the sage, far beyond yin and yang.

Thus it is said: "A single bee, though tiny, may roam and observe heaven and earth. A single shrimp, though tiny, may frolic in the vast sea." To roam and observe, to frolic—both are self-attained ease.

This chapter clarifies that though humans are small, they may comprehend the great Dao.

---

**Chapter Nine**
Guan Yinzi said: When clay figurines are formed, some are noble, some base, some male, some female—yet their substance is earth, their dust the same as man’s.

Clay figurines are human images molded from mud. Once shaped, they may be officials or servants, men or women—all are forms made of earth. Human perception, following appearances, distinguishes noble from base, male from female.

Alas! They are all but earth—why falsely divide noble and base, male and female? This is a metaphor for the human body, though divided into noble and base, male and female, being but a temporary aggregation of the four great elements—earth, water, fire, and wind—like dust gathering into foam. Why falsely divide noble and base, male and female?

Thus it is said: "When clay figurines are formed, some are noble, some base, some male, some female—yet their substance is earth, their dust the same as man’s."

This chapter clarifies that humans, deluded by temporary aggregates, falsely divide noble and base, male and female.

---

**Chapter Ten**
Guan Yinzi said: The eye sees of itself, yet the eye has no color. The ear hears of itself, yet the ear has no sound. The tongue tastes of itself, yet the tongue has no flavor. The mind contemplates of itself, yet the mind has no thing.

The eye is a sense organ; color is dust. When the eye departs from dust and returns to reflection, it awakens to the eye’s original purity, fundamentally without color-dust. Thus it is said: "The eye sees of itself, yet the eye has no color."

The ear is a sense organ; sound is dust. When the ear departs from dust and returns to listening, it awakens to the ear’s original purity, fundamentally without sound-dust. Thus it is said: "The ear hears of itself, yet the ear has no sound."

The tongue is a sense organ; flavor is dust. When the tongue departs from dust and returns to tasting, it awakens to the tongue’s original purity, fundamentally without flavor-dust. Thus it is said: "The tongue tastes of itself, yet the tongue has no flavor."

The mind is a sense organ; things are dharmas, and dharmas are dust. When the mind departs from dust and returns to self-contemplation, it awakens to the mind’s original purity, fundamentally without thing-dharma-dust. Thus it is said: "The mind contemplates of itself, yet the mind has no thing."

Ordinary people, attached to the six dusts, pursue external affairs and lose their true nature. Thus it is said: "The multitude chases the external." The worthy depart from external affairs and cling to inner principle. Yet in grasping and clinging to inner principle, they create a barrier of principle and stray from the Dao. Thus it is said: "The worthy cling to the internal." The sage neither stains the six dusts externally—awakening to the falsity of the obstacle of affairs—nor grasps or clings to principle internally—awakening to the falsity of the obstacle of principle. Thus it is said: "The sage sees all as false," for they do not dwell in the three times or either extreme.

This chapter clarifies that the mind is originally pure, not dwelling in the three times or the middle and extremes.

---

**Chapter Eleven**
Guan Yinzi said: The qi of the five phases within my body—yet the nature of the qi of the five phases is one thing.

The qi of the five viscera in the human body: the qi of the liver belongs to wood and conceals the *hun*; the qi of the heart belongs to fire and conceals the spirit; the qi of the lungs belongs to metal and conceals the *po*; the qi of the kidneys belongs to water and conceals essence; the qi of the spleen belongs to earth and conceals intention. When spirit, *hun*, *po*, essence, and intention return to their nature, the five qi gather at the origin.

**Chapter Twelve**

Thus it is said: "The qi of the five phases within my body"—yet the nature of the five phases’ qi is one thing. When the five spirits return to their nature and the five qi gather at the origin, this is non-duality. Wondrous nature! Things are the wondrous function of nature. For example, a single place may yield fire, yield water, give birth to wood, congeal metal, or transform earth—its nature contains and embraces all, originally without distinction.

Since the five spirits return to their nature and the five qi gather at the origin, this single nature can again generate the spirit-fire, essence-water, *hun*-wood, *po*-metal, and intention-earth. When the five spirits return to their nature and the five qi gather at the origin, this is nature containing and embracing the five phases, originally without distinction. Thus it is said: "For example, a single place may yield fire, yield water, give birth to wood, congeal metal, or transform earth—its nature contains and embraces all, originally without distinction."

Therefore, when feathered creatures flourish, furred creatures do not thrive; when furred creatures flourish, scaled creatures do not thrive. One who understands the mutual generation of the five phases may forget the self. Of the five creatures, three are mentioned—the other two may be inferred. The five creatures are: scaled, feathered, furred, shelled, and armored. Feathered creatures belong to fire; when fire is at its peak, metal does not generate, hence "when feathered creatures flourish, furred creatures do not thrive." *Thrive* means to be born. Furred creatures belong to metal; scaled creatures belong to wood. When metal is at its peak, wood does not generate, hence "when furred creatures flourish, scaled creatures do not thrive." From this, we know that when scaled creatures flourish, armored creatures do not thrive—armored creatures belong to earth, and when wood flourishes, earth does not generate. When armored creatures flourish, shelled creatures do not thrive—shelled creatures belong to water, and when earth flourishes, water does not generate. When shelled creatures flourish, feathered creatures do not thrive—when water flourishes, fire does not generate.

Thus, when the heart does not generate, intention is not born; when intention does not generate, the *po* is not born; when the *po* does not generate, essence is not born; when essence does not generate, the *hun* is not born; when the *hun* does not generate, the spirit is not born; when the spirit does not generate, the heart is not born. When the heart does not generate, there is no self to forget—hence "one who understands the mutual generation of the five phases may forget the self." This chapter clarifies that the Dao is the ancestor of the five phases, and nature is the source of the five spirits.

**Chapter Thirteen**

Guan Yinzi said: A withered tortoise shell, though without self, can reveal great knowledge; a lodestone, though without self, can reveal great power; bells and drums, though without self, can reveal great sound; boats and carts, though without self, can reveal far-reaching movement.

Without self means without mind. A withered, dried tortoise shell has no mind, yet when one bores into it with sincerity, it reveals omens of future fortune or misfortune—what is this if not great knowledge? Thus it is said: "A withered tortoise shell, though without self, can reveal great knowledge." A lodestone has no mind, yet when a needle draws near, it attracts and clings to it—what is this if not great power? Thus it is said: "A lodestone, though without self, can reveal great power." Bells and drums have no mind, yet when struck or beaten, their sound resonates far—what is this if not great sound? Thus it is said: "Bells and drums, though without self, can reveal great sound." Boats and carts have no mind, yet by means of water or oxen, they carry goods to distant places—what is this if not far-reaching movement? Thus it is said: "Boats and carts, though without self, can reveal far-reaching movement."

Therefore, though this body of mine possesses knowledge, power, sound, and movement, it has never possessed a self. The sage is without mind—without knowledge yet knowing all, penetrating the principles of things; without power yet all-powerful, so that no demon dares to invade; without sound yet all-sounding, so that every tone is wondrous; without movement yet moving everywhere, traversing the ten directions in an instant—yet never possessing a self or a mind. Thus it is said: "Therefore, though this body of mine possesses knowledge, power, sound, and movement, it has never possessed a self." This chapter clarifies that the Dao of no-self is perfectly good and perfectly beautiful.

**Chapter Fourteen**

Guan Yinzi said: The *yu* shoots at shadows and can kill me—know that the unknowing is also myself, and beneath the vast heavens, I am nowhere absent.

The *yu* is the name of a water creature, also called *duanhu* or *shuinu*. Its form resembles a crab, with three legs and a length of three to five inches. It is commonly found in the south. It spits sand to shoot at a person’s shadow, which can cause death. Thus it is said: "The *yu* shoots at shadows and can kill me." From this, we know that the shadow itself is unknowing, yet the *yu* merely shoots the shadow and can kill a person—thus the unknowing is also myself. If one knows that the unknowing is also myself, then beneath the vast heavens, whether sentient or insentient, there is nothing that is not myself. This "I" is the self of no-self, its substance identical to empty space, nowhere absent. Thus it is said: "Know that the unknowing is also myself, and beneath the vast heavens, I am nowhere absent." This chapter clarifies that the self of no-self is the wondrous Dao, and the wondrous Dao is nowhere absent.

**Chapter Fifteen**

Guan Yinzi said: One whose mind is absorbed in recollection may forget hunger; one whose mind is consumed by anger may forget cold; one whose mind is nurtured may forget illness; one whose mind is roused may forget pain.

When a person’s mind is fixated on something, they may go all day without feeling hunger—thus it is said: "One whose mind is absorbed in recollection may forget hunger." When, in the midst of freezing ice and snow, a person’s mind is suddenly enraged and their inner fire blazes forth, they may strip bare and stand in the open, sweat soaking their body, yet forget the cold—thus it is said: "One whose mind is consumed by anger may forget cold." A noble person who cultivates the nourishment of the mind may face all manner of dangers or contract severe illness yet remain unmoved in heart or troubled in spirit—thus they may forget their ailment. Thus it is said: "One whose mind is nurtured may forget illness." When two people mutually provoke each other, their minds clash in fury, their limbs are injured, yet they feel no pain—thus it is said: "One whose mind is roused may forget pain."

If one inhales qi to nurture harmony, who can afflict them with hunger? If one preserves spirit to nourish warmth, who can afflict them with cold? If one cultivates the five viscera with the Five Phases, there will be no injury—who can afflict them with illness? If one returns the five viscera to the Five Phases, there will be no awareness—who can afflict them with pain?

Earlier, it was said that ordinary people, though possessing minds, may through recollection, anger, nurturance, or arousal forget hunger, cold, illness, and pain—how much more so for those who have attained the Dao and transcended the mind? Having attained the Dao and transcended the mind, their primordial qi flows in harmonious equilibrium; their breath, soft and continuous, enables them to eat a hundred meals in a day or go a hundred days without food yet never hunger. Thus it is said: *If one inhales qi to nurture harmony, who can afflict them with hunger?* "Who" here means "how."

Having attained the Dao and transcended the mind, their spirit and water are firm, their true fire steaming and suffusing, able to withstand the bitterest cold. Thus it is said: *If one preserves spirit to nourish warmth, who can afflict them with cold?*

Having attained the Dao and transcended the mind, their hundred vessels flow smoothly, their five viscera rest in harmony, their five spirits are clear, their five qi intermingle and merge—no illness arises. Thus it is said: *If one cultivates the five viscera with the Five Phases, there will be no injury—who can afflict them with illness?*

Having attained the Dao and transcended the mind, heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys are aligned with Fire, Wood, Earth, Metal, and Water; all discriminating knowledge is forgotten. Even when a blade is pressed to their neck, they feel no fear or pain—like trimming hair or removing dirt, what pain could there be? Thus it is said: *If one returns the five viscera to the Five Phases, there will be no awareness—who can afflict them with pain?*

This chapter clarifies that hunger, cold, illness, and pain are hard to escape when one clings to the self, but having attained the Dao and transcended the mind, one rises above the suffering of hunger, cold, illness, and pain.

**Chapter Fifteen**

Guan Yinzi said: People should not take the absence of knowledge and action as the absence of self. Though one may possess knowledge and action, it does not impair their absence of self.

Earlier, it was said that the withered tortoise, lodestone, bell, drum, boat, and cart have no self, lest one mistakenly equate the absence of knowledge and action with the absence of self. Another caution is given to learners: do not take the absence of knowledge and action, like dead matter, as the absence of self—otherwise, one would be no different from those who toil in the ghostly caverns beneath Black Mountain.

Little do they know that the absence of knowledge is not without knowledge, the absence of action is not without action. Still and unmoving, yet responsive and penetrating—though possessing knowledge and action, how could this obstruct the absence of self? Thus it is said: *People should not take the absence of knowledge and action as the absence of self. Though one may possess knowledge and action, it does not impair their absence of self.*

For example, fire is restless and ceaseless, yet it has never possessed a self. Having explained that possessing knowledge and action does not impair the absence of self, lest one fail to grasp this fully, another analogy is given to clarify.

Fire, though inherently without self, takes form through kindling. When fire blazes, it burns restlessly and ceaselessly, yet fire has never possessed a self—just as true emptiness responds to change, ever still and without self. Thus it is said: *For example, fire is restless and ceaseless, yet it has never possessed a self.*

This chapter clarifies that true emptiness and the absence of self are not bound by knowledge or action, nor by existence or non-existence.

**The Seventh Cauldron Scroll**

The cauldron signifies transformation, comprising thirteen chapters in all.

Master Guan Yin states:
The Dao is fundamentally utter non-being. Those who return affairs to the Dao attain it in a single breath. Affairs are fundamentally utter being. Those who employ the Dao to manage affairs encompass them in a hundred acts.

Non-being is true emptiness. The supreme Dao is originally true emptiness; when function returns to essence, enlightenment dawns in a single breath. Thus it is said: *The Dao is fundamentally utter non-being. Those who return affairs to the Dao attain it in a single breath.*

Affairs are function; being is wondrous existence. To employ wondrous existence as function is to unite essence and function, responding and transforming without end. Thus it is said: *Affairs are fundamentally utter being. Those who employ the Dao to manage affairs encompass them in a hundred acts.*

Those who attain the Dao in its nobility may assist the world. Those who attain the Dao in its singularity may establish the self.

Nobility is the utmost honor. Those who do not lose the Dao in its utmost honor may aid in bringing worldly peace and benefiting others. Thus it is said: *Those who attain the Dao in its nobility may assist the world.*

"Employ" is function; "singularity" is non-duality; "self" is the essence of true emptiness. Those who do not lose the Dao in its non-duality may gather the function of wondrous existence and restore the essence of true emptiness for self-cultivation. Thus it is said: *Those who attain the Dao in its singularity may establish the self.*

Those who know the Dao cannot be constrained by time may make one day into a hundred years, or a hundred years into one day.

"Know" is awakening; "Dao" is the inconceivable Dao of true emptiness and wondrous existence. Awakening to the inconceivable Dao of true emptiness and wondrous existence is like the great void—beyond the grasp of temporal measures. All that has form is bound by limits; the sea may dry, mountains may crumble, sun and moon may darken, heaven and earth may collapse. Only this Dao of true emptiness transcends time, allowing one to use a single day as a thousand myriad years, or a thousand myriad years as a single day. Thus it is said: *Those who know the Dao cannot be constrained by time may make one day into a hundred years, or a hundred years into one day.*

Those who know the Dao cannot be hindered by space may make one *li* into a hundred *li*, or a hundred *li* into one *li*.

The Dao is originally formless, unbound by the ten directions. The utmost spirit is selfless, unrestrained by the eight extremes. It is swift without haste, arrives without moving, its essence like the great void, its function likewise. Awakening to this, one may traverse a single *li* as if roaming beyond the eight wilds, or traverse the eight wilds as if moving a single *li*. Thus it is said: *Those who know the Dao cannot be hindered by space may make one *li* into a hundred *li*, or a hundred *li* into one *li*.*

Those who know the Dao as prior to qi and can direct existing qi may summon wind and rain.

Awakening to the Dao before the arising of the primordial qi, one may employ the Dao to move qi, transforming yin and yang into wind and rain. The profoundly realized may subtly wield the function of true emptiness, instantly summoning clouds and thunder, calling forth wind and rain. Thus it is said: *Those who know the Dao as prior to qi and can direct existing qi may summon wind and rain.*

Those who know the Dao as formless and can transform existing forms may alter birds and beasts.

The adept of the Dao possesses boundless spiritual powers, roaming as a companion to the Creator. They may transform formlessness into form, or form into formlessness, concealing or revealing at will. They may turn flying birds into running beasts, or running beasts into flying birds, manifesting wondrous transformations without end. Thus it is said: *Those who know the Dao as formless and can transform existing forms may alter birds and beasts.*

Those who attain the Dao in its purity are unburdened by things; their bodies become light, and they may ride phoenixes and cranes.

The Dao is neither pure nor impure, yet may be either. The adept of the Dao, pure and unstained like the void, cannot be encumbered by the myriad things. Body and spirit both wondrous, they unite with true emptiness, weightless as the void, traversing the ten directions in an instant without need of a mount. To manifest spiritual transformations and awaken the deluded, they may ride phoenixes or cranes, or ascend on colored clouds, revealing the truth to those of middling and lesser capacity and inspiring their sincerity in the Dao. Thus it is said: *Those who attain the Dao in its purity are unburdened by things; their bodies become light, and they may ride phoenixes and cranes*—as did Wei Shuqing, who rode a white crane, or Wang Zijin, who ascended on a phoenix while playing his flute.

Those who attain the Dao in its undifferentiated state are unswayed by things; their bodies become obscure, and they may sit upon dragons and whales.

The adept of the Dao dwells in the world without defilement, harmonizing their light without display, utterly concealed. Thus it is said: *Those who attain the Dao in its undifferentiated state are unswayed by things; their bodies become obscure.* "Unswayed" means unstained; "obscure" means concealed. They may manifest spiritual powers, using dragons and whales as seats, riding them through the great void. Thus it is said: *They may sit upon dragons and whales*—as did the ancient Yu, who rode dragons to guide the hundred rivers; Li Taibai, who mounted a flood dragon; or Liu Zhigu, who rode a golden carp; or Qin Gao, who ascended on a red carp.

Being is non-being; non-being is being. Those who know this Dao may command spirits and gods.

"Being" is the function of wondrous existence; "non-being" is the essence of true emptiness. Function is essence; essence is function—essence and function are inseparable. Awakening to this Dao, one may subdue spirits and gods, employing them as servants. Thus it is said: *Being is non-being; non-being is being. Those who know this Dao may command spirits and gods*—as did Liu Gen, who skillfully employed spirits and gods, or the Han Celestial Master, who subdued them in Chengdu.

Reality is emptiness; emptiness is reality. Those who know this Dao may enter metal and stone.

Reality is true existence; emptiness is true void. True void and true existence are the non-duality of the Dao’s essence and function. Awakening to the non-duality of essence and function, emptiness and reality interpenetrate, allowing one to tread upon water and fire, enter metal and stone without obstruction. Thus it is said: *Reality is emptiness; emptiness is reality. Those who know this Dao may enter metal and stone.*

Above is the wondrous Dao before the Five Ultimates; below is the myriad virtues and practices of perfect power. The wondrous Dao is essence; virtue and practice are function. When essence and function share a single source, above and below are non-dual. Those who awaken to this Dao may command the ten thousand images and the forest of phenomena as their attendants. Thus it is said: *Above is below; below is above. Those who know this Dao may attend the stars and constellations.*

The ancient is principle; the present is phenomena. Principle is essence; phenomena are function. When essence and function are inseparable, those who awaken to this Dao remain quiescent and unmoving, yet respond with perfect resonance—like the divination of the yarrow stalks, where auspicious omens are certain, and sincerity is without falsehood. Thus it is said: *The ancient is the present; the present is the ancient. Those who know this Dao may divine with tortoise and millet.*

Others are the external realm; the self is the mind. When mind and realm are both forgotten, the Dao-eye opens in clarity. Those who awaken to this Dao can see all without seeing, perceiving the thoughts and intentions within others’ hearts and lungs—this is called *knowledge of others’ minds*. Thus it is said: *Others are the self; the self is others. Those who know this Dao may peer into others’ lungs and livers.*

Heaven and earth are born together with me; the ten thousand things and I are one. Those who awaken to this Dao may transform their liver-spirit into a dragon, their lung-spirit into a tiger, riding and mounting them to wander the Great Clarity. Thus it is said: *Things are the self; the self is things. Those who know this Dao may cultivate dragons and tigers within the abdomen.*

Knowing that images arise from the mind’s transformations, by contemplating the mind thus, one may cultivate the Maiden and the Infant. The realm of the ten thousand images arises from the transformations of the mind-spirit. Through this profound contemplation, the mind’s essence is true emptiness, yet it contains the wondrous function of existence. The spirit within the heart transforms into the Marvelous Maiden; the spirit within the kidneys transforms into the Infant Brother. When Maiden and Infant unite, nature and life merge, transcending birth and death. Thus it is said: *Knowing that images arise from the mind’s transformations, by contemplating the mind thus, one may cultivate the Maiden and the Infant.*

Knowing that qi arises from the mind, by absorbing spirit thus, one may refine the furnace and crucible. Where the mind directs, qi follows. Knowing that qi arises from the mind, when the mind realizes true emptiness—like still, limpid water—breathing the spirit-qi with unbroken continuity, the heart-fire descends and the kidney-water ascends. When water and fire intermingle, the Great Elixir is formed. Those who ingest it transcend the ills of birth and death. Thus it is said: *Knowing that qi arises from the mind, by absorbing spirit thus, one may refine the furnace and crucible.*

The later sages’ use of the elixir to metaphorically describe the Dao originates here. With this supreme power, tigers and leopards may be subdued; by harmonizing with things, one may enter water and fire. With this perfect Dao and perfect virtue, radiant majesty shines forth, and all things submit in reverence. Tigers and leopards bow in submission, serving as mounts. Thus it is said: *With this, one may subdue things; tigers and leopards may be tamed.* With this perfect Dao, the body merges with the Great Void—how could water drown or fire burn the void? Those who awaken to the Dao are no different from it, thus they may traverse vast floods without drowning, endure great droughts where metal and stone melt and mountains scorch without feeling heat. Thus it is said: *By harmonizing with things, one may enter water and fire.*

Only those who embody the Dao can achieve these feats, yet they may also choose not to act upon them. The eighteen wondrous powers described above—assisting the world and establishing the self, traversing a hundred *li* in a day or a hundred years in an instant, summoning wind and rain, transforming birds and beasts, riding phoenixes and cranes, resting upon whales, commanding spirits and gods, entering metal and stone, attending the stars and constellations, divining with tortoise and millet, perceiving others’ lungs and livers, cultivating dragons and tigers, the Maiden and the Infant, the furnace and crucible, taming tigers and leopards, entering water and fire—are all within the mastery of those who awaken to the Dao. Yet they may also choose not to employ them, for these are the miraculous transformations of those who can act yet refrain.

The Dao values authenticity and sincerity, and concealment is paramount. The sage does not perform wonders that startle the foolish or shock the vulgar—these eighteen marvels are such examples. Though the matters themselves are profoundly real, when the Dao governs them, they become as effortless as a hundred acts. Thus it is said: *Only those who embody the Dao can achieve these feats, yet they may also choose not to act upon them.*

This chapter elucidates the boundless transformations of the Dao’s essence and function, while the sage conceals their brilliance, never startling the foolish or vulgar.

**Chapter One**
Guan Yinzi said: Among human abilities, there are those that can seize the creative transformations of heaven and earth. Those who awaken to the Dao may wander as equals with the Creator, seizing the wondrous generative and transformative powers of heaven and earth’s yin and yang. Thus it is said: *Among human abilities, there are those that can seize the creative transformations of heaven and earth.*

For example, summoning thunder in winter or creating ice in summer, animating the dead or causing withered trees to bloom—those who awaken to the Dao can invert yin and yang, summoning thunder in winter or congealing ice in summer. As when Lao Chengzi studied under Yin Wen, mastering life and death at will, reversing the four seasons: thunder in winter, ice in summer, birds running and beasts flying, yet never erring in his transformations. Such marvels are unknown to the world. Thus it is said: *For example, summoning thunder in winter or creating ice in summer.*

Of old, the Most High cast the Great Mystery Life Talisman upon Xu Jia’s withered bones, and in that very moment they revived and could walk—thus it is said: *the dead corpse can walk.* The Pure Yang Patriarch revived a withered willow in Anzhou with the elixir, and likewise revived a withered locust tree in Laizhou, whereupon its branches and leaves flourished anew—thus it is said: *the withered tree can bloom.*

Summoning ghosts from beans: Once, the Perfected Lord Guo Pu scattered several hundred small beans beyond a wall, and they all transformed into red-clad ghosts. Using talismans as divine generals, he bound them one by one and cast them into a well—thus it is said: *summoning ghosts from beans.*

Fishing in a cup: Once, the Perfected Lord Zuo Ci drank with Cao Cao. He filled a bronze basin with water, cast hook and bait into it, and in an instant hooked a golden carp over a foot long, which he then scaled—thus it is said: *fishing for fish in a cup.*

A painted door can open: Emperor Taizong of Tang summoned Wu Daozi to splash ink upon the palace walls. After veiling it with curtains for a long while, the curtains were drawn back, and the emperor was invited to view the painting. Mountains and rivers, grasses and trees, human dwellings, birds and beasts—all were fully rendered. Suddenly, a cave entrance appeared beneath a cliff. Daozi pointed to the cave and said, “Within dwell immortals.” He struck it with his hand, and the cave door instantly opened. Daozi leapt inside and beckoned to the emperor, who dared not enter. In an instant, the door closed again and vanished—thus it is said: *a painted door can open.*

Clay ghosts can speak: Once, in a temple on Mount Lu, clay statues of gods and ghosts could foretell fortune and misfortune. The Perfected Lord Yue Ba exorcised them, revealing that they were possessed by a wild fox spirit. If even a wild fox spirit could make clay ghosts speak, how much more so the immortals?—thus it is said: *clay ghosts can speak.*

All these are the workings of pure qi, and thus they can transform the myriad things. As in the examples above—thunder in winter, ice in summer, the dead corpse walking, the withered tree blooming, summoning ghosts from beans, fishing in a cup, the painted door opening, clay ghosts speaking—these eight wonders all arise from purity without admixture, the wondrous Dao of true emptiness. They can move the single qi to transform the myriad things, which is precisely what was meant earlier by *among human abilities, there are those that can seize the creative transformations of heaven and earth.* Thus it is said: *All these are the workings of pure qi, and thus they can transform the myriad things.*

Now, the ceaseless flux of human emotions is also the work of qi, for qi is a thing that gathers and scatters. The hearts and passions of deluded people surge and flow like unceasing waves—this too is the work of strong yang qi. That strong yang qi, from birth to maturity, gathers and overflows; from maturity to old age, it scatters and declines. Thus it is said: *Now, the ceaseless flux of human emotions is also the work of qi, for qi as a thing gathers and scatters.*

The qi I cultivate has never gathered, nor has it ever scattered. The sage who awakens to the Dao of true emptiness attains the primordial qi’s origin, and the primordial qi’s origin has never known gathering or scattering. Thus it is said: *The qi I cultivate has never gathered, nor has it ever scattered.* “Origin” means source.

Where there is gathering, there is life; where there is scattering, there is death. The deluded person receives one catty of primordial qi. A man attains the number eight: at two eights, sixteen years, he begins to leak essence, unaware of how to preserve it. Every three years, he loses one ounce; in thirty years, he loses ten ounces. Three sixes make eighteen, and forty-eight years in total deplete the full sixteen ounces of primordial qi. After forty-eight years, adding another sixteen—eight eights, sixty-four—brings the hexagram count to its end. Once the primordial qi is exhausted, only the qi of the five grains sustains him. Though still called a man, in truth he is a ghost.

A woman receives fourteen ounces of primordial qi. A woman attains the number seven: at two sevens, fourteen years, the celestial waters descend, and the primordial qi begins to leak. Every two and a half years, she loses one ounce; in twenty-five years, she loses ten ounces, leaving four. In ten years, these are exhausted. Twenty-five plus ten years totals thirty-five, and adding another fourteen—seven sevens, forty-nine—brings the central yang number to its end. The celestial waters dry up, and only the qi of the five grains sustains her. Though still called a woman, in truth she is a ghost. Once the primordial qi of men and women is exhausted, they await only death. From this, we know that when qi gathers, there is life; when qi scatters, there is death. Thus it is said: *Where there is gathering, there is life; where there is scattering, there is death.* “Gathering” means to assemble.

That which has never gathered nor scattered is beyond life and death. Guests come and go, but the post station remains ever unchanged. The sage who awakens to the Dao attains the origin of primordial qi, which has never known gathering or scattering—thus we know there is no life, no death. The “post station” is the courier’s lodge; the “guest” is the traveling emissary. Guests come and go, but the lodge remains ever as it is, unmoving and unchanging, without departure or arrival. The guest is an analogy for qi; coming and going are analogies for scattering and gathering. The post station is an analogy for the Dao. The Dao moves primordial qi, ascending and descending, coming and going. When qi gathers, there is life; when qi scatters, there is death. Yet the Dao that moves qi is not qi. That which is not qi knows no gathering or scattering, no life or death, no coming or going. Thus the awakened one knows no gathering or scattering, no life or death, no coming or going. Thus it is said: *Guests come and go, but the post station remains ever unchanged.* “Unchanged” means thusness, unmoving and untransformed.

This chapter clarifies that the Dao is the origin of primordial qi, its transformations boundless, yet without coming or going, life or death.

Chapter Two

Guan Yinzi said: There are those who recite mantras, those who serve spirits, those who inscribe talismans, and those who manipulate fingers—all can command spirits, master qi, and transform the myriad things. The adepts of ritual registers transmit and receive whispered instructions, devoting themselves to prayer and recitation to achieve spiritual efficacy. For example, the Nine Characters of the Esoteric Tradition, when recited 108,000 times, respond to the will like an echo—thus it is said: *there are those who recite mantras.*

Guan Yinzi said: There are those who erect images, focusing their reverence in single-minded devotion, praying and supplicating according to their hearts—nothing fails to respond. Thus it is said: *there are those who serve spirits.*

The masters of talismanic registers transmit and receive esoteric writs of divine descent, inscribing characters on paper and ink to reveal future fortune or misfortune. Their verifications are never in error. Thus it is said: *there are those who inscribe talismans.*

The masters of ritual registers transmit and receive hand seals of divine response, directing the afflicted to extend their hands over the incense burner. The master summons the incantation, calling forth the spirits for a long while. The fingers grow or shrink, rise or fall, and the master discerns the cause of the ghostly or spiritual affliction. Their verifications are never mistaken. Thus it is said: *there are those who manipulate fingers.*

These four practices—reciting mantras, serving spirits, inscribing talismans, and manipulating fingers—all can command ghosts and spirits, direct the flow of primordial qi, and transform the myriad things, thereby manifesting divine efficacy. Thus it is said: *all can command spirits, master qi, and transform the myriad things.*

Yet those lacking sincerity find it difficult to trust themselves and readily trust external objects. Thus, these methods are employed as expedients. Every person possesses the wondrous Dao of true emptiness, with boundless majesty and radiance. All is complete within, nothing is lacking in its use. With a single awakened thought, one’s station equals that of the sages—able to command ghosts and spirits, summon wind and rain, and wield limitless spiritual powers. Every person possesses such extraordinary potential. Yet when told this, people lack faith. Since they struggle to believe in themselves, they easily believe in external things. Out of compassion, the sages employ the sincerity of reciting mantras, serving spirits, inscribing talismans, and manipulating fingers to demonstrate spiritual efficacy and awaken the heart of faith in the Dao. Thus it is said: *those lacking sincerity find it difficult to trust themselves and readily trust external objects, hence these methods are employed as expedients.*

If one truly understands sincerity, there is no need to rely on such practices. *If* here means *sincerity*. If one knows that reciting mantras, serving spirits, inscribing talismans, and manipulating fingers yield spiritual efficacy—all arising from sincerity—then, understanding that only sincerity moves the spirits, one need not depend on reciting mantras, serving spirits, inscribing talismans, or manipulating fingers to command ghosts and spirits. Thus it is said: *if one truly understands sincerity, there is no need to rely on such practices.*

This chapter clarifies that sincerity is the foundation of commanding spirits and the gateway to entering the Dao.

Guan Yinzi said: With every inhalation and exhalation, a person traverses four hundred thousand *li* in a day—transformation may indeed be called swift. One breath consists of one inhalation and one exhalation. In a day and night, there are thirteen thousand five hundred breaths. With each breath, qi travels six inches, so in a day and night, qi travels eight hundred ten *zhang*. This is fifty circuits of the celestial sphere. Ten hundreds make a thousand, ten thousands make a myriad, ten myriads make a *yi*, and ten *yi* make a *zhao*. In one breath, a person traverses four hundred thousand *li* in a day—meaning one breath covers four hundred million *li*. Ten breaths cover four *zhao* *li*, a hundred breaths cover forty *zhao* *li*, a thousand breaths cover four hundred *zhao* *li*, ten thousand breaths cover four thousand *zhao* *li*, three thousand breaths cover one thousand two hundred *zhao* *li*, and five hundred breaths cover two hundred *zhao* *li*. In total, a day and night sees a traversal of five thousand four hundred *zhao* *li*. From this, we know that the great transformation may indeed be called swift. Thus it is said: *with every inhalation and exhalation, a person traverses four hundred thousand* li *in a day—transformation may indeed be called swift.*

Only the sage remains unchanged. The sage, penetrating the Dao of true emptiness, is without self—neither existing nor not existing. True emptiness transcends past and present, without alteration. As the ancients said: *adding a year, subtracting a year—true emptiness remains unmoved.* Thus it is said: *only the sage remains unchanged.* *Unchanged* means *without self.*

This chapter clarifies that the Dao does not belong to the great transformation but rather directs it.

---

Guan Yinzi said: The Blue Phoenix Master lived a thousand years and underwent a thousand transformations. Peach Master served five times and his heart changed five times. The Blue Phoenix Master was an ancient sage. The sage’s form changes with time, shifting and altering year after year until a thousand years pass, never ceasing to transform. Yet within these transformations, there is that which does not transform—the unchanging, eternally constant Dao. For example, a sage at sixty years of age has undergone sixty transformations, yet what began as right may end as wrong. Thus it is said: *the Blue Phoenix Master lived a thousand years and underwent a thousand transformations.* The Peach Master was an ancient worthy. Serving five times in office, his heart changed five times. Like Lian Boyu, who at sixty transformed sixty times, not knowing whether sixty was right or fifty-nine was wrong. As the ancients said: *a lamp’s flame in a jar—later light is not the earlier light. Borrowing form from a mirror—today’s reflection is not yesterday’s.* Thus it is said: *Peach Master served five times and his heart changed five times.*

The sage treats affairs as a guest and distances himself from things. How could he not wish to establish himself in the world? Yet he fears the unknowable nature of transformation in forms and numbers. *Affairs* means *use*. The sage treats affairs as a guest, not making use the primary concern. The body of the Dao is true emptiness, unattached to the realm of things, which naturally recedes. Thus it is said: *the sage treats affairs as a guest and distances himself from things.* The sage does not prioritize establishing wondrous functions but preserves the substance of true emptiness. Responding only when moved, his responses remain ever tranquil. How could he not wish to establish wondrous functions to benefit the world? Yet he does not make use the primary concern. If he were to prioritize establishing wondrous functions, treating the substance of true emptiness as secondary, he would fall into the traces of forms and numbers—the causes of minor karmic fruits in the human and heavenly realms, like a shadow following form. Though not substantial, once fallen into the traces of forms and numbers, he would be subject to the great transformation’s shifts and changes. From this, we see that those bound by forms and numbers fear being swept away by the great transformation. Those who study the Dao must awaken to this truth.

Thus it is said: how could he not wish to establish himself in the world? Yet those bound by forms and numbers fear the unfathomable transformations of the Dao. The unfathomable lies in this: as soon as knowledge sprouts, one falls into the great transformation. This chapter clarifies that the substance of the true must be primary, while establishing wondrous functions is secondary. With substance and function both present, transformation transforms yet does not transform.

**Chapter Five**
Master Guan Yin says: The myriad things undergo ceaseless change, now hidden, now manifest, yet their qi is but one. Only the sage knows the One and does not transform.
The myriad things arise and grow, age and die in an instant—there is no moment they do not change. In spring, Wood is hidden while Fire appears; in summer, Fire is hidden while Metal appears; in autumn, Metal is hidden while Water appears; in winter, Water is hidden while Wood appears. Earth is hidden and manifest through the four seasons. The Five Phases and four seasons alternately hide and appear, generating and transforming without end—all driven by the revolving of a single qi, mutually impelling and stirring to enact the workings of spirits. Thus it is said: though the myriad things undergo ceaseless change, now hidden, now manifest, their qi is but one. The sage, awakened to the wondrous Dao of non-duality, abides like empty space and does not shift with the great transformation. Thus it is said: the sage knows the One and does not transform. *Knowing* here means awakening. This chapter clarifies that the Dao moves the great transformation yet does not transform.

**Chapter Six**
Master Guan Yin says: The growth of nails, the lengthening of hair, the circulation of *ying* and *wei*—none ceases for even an instant. The multitude see only what is coarse, not what is subtle.
The nails on a person’s hands and the hair on their head grow and recede in constant flux, just as the blood’s *ying* and the qi’s *wei* circulate day and night without pause—all these, like the growth of nails and hair, never cease for even an instant. Thus it is said: the growth of nails, the lengthening of hair, the circulation of *ying* and *wei*—none ceases for even an instant. *Coarse* refers to overt traces. The multitude see only overt, manifest traces but cannot perceive the subtle growth of nails and hair or the circulation of *ying* and *wei*. Thus it is said: the multitude see only what is coarse, not what is subtle. The worthy see what is subtle yet cannot yield to transformation.
*(The following eleven characters are added in Guo Ziqian’s edition, which is well-ordered, so they are included here in the explication:)* The worthy perceive the subtle but cannot fathom the heart-mind, and thus cannot yield to the transformation that is no-transformation. Thus it is said: the worthy see what is subtle yet cannot yield to transformation. The sage yields to transformation, and thus there is no transformation. The sage awakens to the unchanging, independent substance and yields to the inexhaustible, ceaseless function. Yielding to the inexhaustible, ceaseless function is yielding to transformation; awakening to the unchanging, independent substance is no-transformation. Thus it is said: the sage yields to transformation, and thus there is no transformation. This chapter clarifies that the Dao is independent and unchanging, circulating without cease.

**Chapter Seven**
Master Guan Yin says: Within the chamber, one’s perceptions are constant. Then one goes to the gate, to the neighbors, to the village, to the district, then to the outskirts, to the mountains, to the rivers—perceptions differ, likes and dislikes follow, harmony and contention arise, gain and loss take shape.
The inner chambers of a hall are called *rooms*; five households make a *neighborhood*, five neighborhoods a *village*, five hundred households a *district*, and what lies beyond the city walls is called the *outskirts*. When one dwells within the chamber, the sights and sounds of people and things are taken as ordinary, daily perceptions. Thus it is said: within the chamber, one’s perceptions are constant. *Goes* means to proceed. First one leaves the room for the courtyard gate, then for the neighborhood, the village, the district, or further to the outskirts, the mountains, the rivers—eyes behold different forms and appearances, ears hear different sounds, so perceptions vary. Thus it is said: then one goes to the gate, to the neighbors, to the village, to the district, then to the outskirts, to the mountains, to the rivers—perceptions differ. As sights and sounds differ, some evoke fondness and desire, others aversion and dislike; some bring harmony and shared joy, others discord and contention; some can be grasped and gained, others lost and abandoned. Such circumstances shift with emotions and take shape accordingly. Thus it is said: likes and dislikes follow, harmony and contention arise, gain and loss take shape. Therefore the sage’s movements and stillness are governed by precepts.
*Stillness* means quietude; *precepts* means restraint. The sage instructs disciples that in every movement and stillness, they must restrain themselves from sensory indulgence, cautiously guarding their conduct and concealment, not allowing perceptions of sights and sounds to alter their course. Thus it is said: therefore the sage’s movements and stillness are governed by precepts. If these are precepts for disciples, what need has the sage for them? This chapter clarifies that the deluded are swayed by sights and sounds.

Master Guan Yinzi said: Just as the great sea can transform into countless dragons and fish, yet the water remains one and the same. The great sea is likened to the Dao that operates the great transformation; the dragons and fish are likened to the worthy and the foolish. The great sea can transform into countless dragons and fish, all born within the same water. The Dao can operate the great transformation, altering the myriad worthy and foolish, all born within the same Dao. Thus it is said: just as the great sea can transform into countless dragons and fish, yet the water remains one and the same. This serves as an analogy.

I and all things flourish abundantly, thriving within the great transformation, yet their nature remains one and the same. *Flourishing* describes the dense growth of grasses and trees; *thriving* depicts their lush abundance. I and all things flourish and thrive like untamed grasses and luxuriant forests, innumerable, all within the great transformation, their Dao-nature undivided. Thus it is said: I and all things flourish abundantly, thriving within the great transformation, yet their nature remains one and the same. This completes the analogy.

Those who fully awaken to the unconditioned, non-dual Dao see no faults in others beyond nature, nor do they perceive a self within. Their minds merge with the great void, free from annihilation and birth. Thus it is said: those who know that nature is one are without others and without self, without death and without birth. *Death* means annihilation. This chapter clarifies that the Dao-nature transcends self and others, and that death and birth do not belong to the great transformation.

Master Guan Yinzi said: Among the principles of the world, right may transform into wrong, and wrong may transform into right; kindness may turn into enmity, and enmity may turn into kindness. The principles of the world shift with human delusions. What aligns with one’s self is deemed right; yet when public affairs conflict with private desires, yesterday’s right may transform into today’s wrong. What differs from one’s self is deemed wrong; yet when private matters align with private desires, yesterday’s wrong may transform into today’s right. Thus it is said: among the principles of the world, right may transform into wrong, and wrong may transform into right.

The greatest kindness in the world is none other than that of ruler and father. Yet when public affairs and public principles conflict with private desires, yesterday’s greatest kindness may transform into today’s greatest enmity—such is the case with those who murder their rulers or fathers. The greatest enmity in the world is none other than that of rival states. Yet when private matters and private principles align with private desires, yesterday’s greatest enmity may transform into today’s greatest kindness—such is the case with rival states forming alliances and intermarrying. Thus it is said: kindness may turn into enmity, and enmity may turn into kindness.

Therefore, the sage abides in constancy while contemplating change. *Therefore* is a phrase connecting the preceding to the following. The sage instructs disciples to rest in the great constancy of nature while guarding against the petty changes of emotion, not yielding to selfishness. Thus it is said: therefore, the sage abides in constancy while contemplating change. *Abides* means to rest; *contemplates* means to reflect carefully and guard against negligence. This chapter clarifies that yielding to the petty changes of deluded emotions distorts right and wrong, kindness and enmity, while embracing the great constancy of true nature transcends distinctions of right and wrong, kindness and enmity.

Master Guan Yinzi said: In youth, one should heed the teachings of father and elder brothers; in maturity, one should comprehend the admonitions of friends; in old age, one should caution the young and mature with one’s counsel. Though the myriad transformations shift, they cannot constrain me.

In one’s youth, when father and elder brothers offer instructive words, one should inscribe them upon the body and follow them without forgetfulness. Thus it is said: in youth, one should heed the teachings of father and elder brothers. In maturity, when fellow disciples or like-minded friends offer admonitions, remedies, and moral guidance, one should fully understand and not shrink from correcting faults, daily renewing one’s virtue. Thus it is said: in maturity, one should comprehend the admonitions of friends.

In old age, having experienced much and discerned the principles of right and wrong, gain and loss, one should use these insights to caution the young and mature, tirelessly expounding and instructing—this is the heart of a benevolent person. Thus it is said: in old age, one should caution the young and mature with one’s counsel. As described above, in youth one follows the teachings of father and elder brothers, in maturity one comprehends the admonitions of friends, and in old age one cautions the young and mature. Thus one does not violate the principles of being human.

Abiding by principle and wandering through the world, though the myriad transformations subtly shift, one does not resist the Creator but follows it without peril. Thus it is said: though the myriad transformations shift, they cannot constrain me. This chapter clarifies that abiding by principle allows one to wander with the Creator without constraint.

Master Guan Yinzi said: Among the principles of the world, the light are easily transformed, while the heavy are difficult to transform. The principles of the world discard the light and pure qi, whose bearers possess keen roots and bright natures, making them easily transformed and awakened. Thus it is said: among the principles of the world, the light are easily transformed. Those who bear the heavy and turbid qi possess dull roots and obscure natures, making them difficult to transform and awaken. Thus it is said: the heavy are difficult to transform.

For example, wind and clouds vanish in an instant, while the nature of metal and jade endures unchanged over time. *Vanish* means to transform. For instance, the qi of wind and clouds changes and vanishes in a moment, disappearing without a trace. Thus it is said: for example, wind and clouds vanish in an instant. This illustrates the earlier point that the light are easily transformed. The nature of metal is firm, and the nature of jade is hard, enabling them to endure for a long time without alteration. Thus it is said: the nature of metal and jade endures unchanged over time. This illustrates the earlier point that the heavy are difficult to transform.

Those who are light and bright can transform along with creation without lingering, as if an untransformed essence remains.

Those endowed with the light and pure qi possess a nature that is bright and keen, their minds readily awakening to understanding. They can wander in unison with the transformations of creation without obstruction. Thus it is said: those who are clear and bright can transform along with creation without lingering. *Without lingering* means without obstruction. Having awakened to wander with the transformations of creation without obstruction, they follow change yet remain unchanged, undergoing minor transformations while preserving the great constancy. Thus it is said: as if an untransformed essence remains. *Remains* means preserving the great constancy. This chapter clarifies that those of keen nature easily awaken, following change yet remaining unchanged.

**Chapter Twelve**

Master Guan Yin said: When two children are fond of each other, by the time they reach adulthood, upon meeting they no longer recognize one another. When two adults are fond of each other, by the time they grow old, upon meeting they no longer recognize one another. Like the transformations of sparrows into clams, hawks into turtledoves—without past, without present.

When two children love each other, delighting in play and intimacy, after parting for many years and both reaching vigorous adulthood, their appearances altered and forms changed, upon meeting again, they cannot recognize each other as they did in childhood. Thus it is said: when two children are fond of each other, by the time they reach adulthood, upon meeting they no longer recognize one another. When two adults form an inseparable bond, delighting in shared studies, after parting for many years, their forms and faces transformed, hair turned white and complexions aged, skin slackened and wrinkled, upon meeting again, they cannot recognize each other as they did in their prime. Thus it is said: when two adults are fond of each other, by the time they grow old, upon meeting they no longer recognize one another.

The transformation of children into adults, of adults into the elderly, is like sparrows entering water and becoming clams, or turtledoves transforming into hawks. The *Book of Transformations* states: snakes transform into tortoises, sparrows into clams. The *Liezi* also states: sparrow hawks transform into cranes, cranes into cuckoos, and cuckoos back into sparrow hawks. The cuckoo is another name for the turtledove. Thus it is said: like the transformations of sparrows into clams, hawks into turtledoves—without past, without present. The sparrow is the past of the clam, the clam the present of the sparrow; when a sparrow becomes a clam, the clam is entirely the sparrow. When a turtledove becomes a hawk, the hawk is entirely the turtledove. Though their forms change, their nature knows no past or present. This chapter clarifies that form follows transformation without cease, while nature transcends past and present without alteration.

**Commentary on the *Wenshi Zhenjing*, Scroll Eight**
*Divine Peak’s* [Shenfeng] *Carefree Master Niu Daochun’s Direct Explication*

**The Eight Strategies**
*Strategy* (*chou*) means "thing" (*wu*). In all, six chapters.

Master Guanyin said: The ancients skilled in divination—whether casting stalks or scorching tortoise shells—could reveal the ancient within the present, the present within the ancient; the high within the low, the low within the high; the small within the great, the great within the small; the one within the many, the many within the one; the human within things, things within the human; the self within the other, the other within the self.

**First Chapter on Scapulimancy and Pyromancy**
The ancients possessed skill in divining with milfoil stalks and scorching tortoise shells—like searing a hot iron awl to bore into the shell—interpreting the cracks to discern the auspices and inauspices of past, future, and present events. They could use present affairs to illuminate ancient principles, and in turn, apply ancient principles to reveal the gains and losses of present affairs. Thus it is said: the ancients skilled in divining with stalks and scorching tortoise shells could reveal the ancient within the present, the present within the ancient.

The *high* refers to Heaven, which pertains to *yang*—and *yang* pertains to auspice. The *low* refers to Earth, which pertains to *yin*—and *yin* pertains to inauspice. Through divination with stalks and scorched shells, they could reveal inauspice within auspice to inform people, and likewise, auspice within inauspice. Thus it is said: the high within the low, the low within the high.

The *small* refers to the individual body; the *great*, to the realm, state, and family. Through divination with stalks and scorched shells, they could reveal the fortunes and misfortunes of the realm, state, and family within the individual body, and conversely, the auspices and inauspices of the individual body within the realm, state, and family. Thus it is said: the small within the great, the great within the small.

The *one* refers to the sovereign; the *many*, to the common people. Through divination with stalks and scorched shells, they could reveal the fortunes and misfortunes of the common people to the sovereign, and conversely, the auspices and inauspices of the sovereign to the common people. Thus it is said: the one within the many, the many within the one.

*Things* refer to material wealth. Through divination with stalks and scorched shells, they could reveal the abundance or scarcity of wealth based on a person’s gains and losses, and conversely, a person’s gains and losses based on the abundance or scarcity of wealth. Thus it is said: the human within things, things within the human.

The *other* refers to parents, siblings, wives, and children. Through divination with stalks and scorched shells, they could reveal the survival, loss, abundance, or scarcity of parents, siblings, wives, and children based on the self’s Eight Characters, and conversely, the self’s nobility, baseness, fortunes, and misfortunes based on the survival, loss, abundance, or scarcity of parents, siblings, wives, and children. Thus it is said: the self within the other, the other within the self.

This Dao—its coming knows no present, its going knows no past; its height has no canopy, its depth has no foundation; its greatness has no beyond, its smallness has no within; its root is not one, its branches are not many; its exterior has no things, its interior has no people; its nearness has no self, its farness has no other.

*This* refers to the present. This true emptiness, this inconceivable Dao, is not like divination with stalks and scorched shells, which analyzes the six pairs of opposites—past and present, high and low, great and small, one and many, human and things, self and other.

The Dao does not belong to time; it comes and goes alone, without distinction between past and present. Thus it is said: this Dao—its coming knows no present, its going knows no past.

The Dao does not belong to form or position; it fills the void, pervading above and below, present everywhere—unlike Heaven and Earth, fixed in canopy and foundation. Thus it is said: its height has no canopy, its depth has no foundation.

The Dao does not belong to interior or exterior, center or periphery. In its greatness, it is boundlessly vast; in its smallness, it is invisible. Thus it is said: its greatness has no beyond, its smallness has no within.

The Dao does not belong to number; it cannot be fixed as one or many. The Dao is the root-source of the Five Ultimates, the Two Modes, and the myriad things. It circulates as a single *qi*, transforming and generating Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things. Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things never depart from the Dao; if they were to separate from it, they would collapse and perish. From this, we know that Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things are the branches of the Dao. Thus it is said: its root is not one, its branches are not many.

This line—*"its root is not one, its branches are not many"*—appears in Guo Ziqian’s edition, where it fits well within the sequence of the scripture. Thus, it is also explained here.

The Dao does not belong to things or people; interior and exterior are not two. Thus it is said: its exterior has no things, its interior has no people.

The Dao does not belong to self or other; far and near are not two. Thus it is said: its nearness has no self, its farness has no other.

It cannot be divided, cannot be united; it cannot be described, cannot be conceived. Only in its undifferentiated wholeness is it the Dao.

The Dao is like empty space—without dispersion, without aggregation. Thus it is said: it cannot be divided, cannot be united.

The Dao has no likeness, no comparison, no sentience. It cannot be conveyed through speech or analogy, nor grasped through thought or understanding. Thus it is said: it cannot be described, cannot be conceived.

If one awakens to it, it is inherently complete, inherently manifest, inherently whole and true—requiring no cultivation, fabrication, or contrivance. Such is what we forcibly name the Dao. Thus it is said: only in its undifferentiated wholeness is it the Dao.

This chapter clarifies that the Dao does not belong to form or number and cannot be known through analysis.

**End of First Chapter**

Master Guanyin said: Water, being latent, stores the Five Essences; fire, being soaring, extends the Five Odors; wood, being flourishing, blooms into the Five Colors; metal, being firm, solidifies into the Five Sounds; earth, being harmonious, nourishes the Five Flavors.

Master Guanyin said: Essence is the essence of spirit; water’s nature delights in concealment within, thus it accumulates and becomes the essence of the Five Worms. The Five Worms are those with scales, feathers, fur, carapaces, and bare skin. Water, when stored in the viscera, is the kidneys; among the Five Spirits, it is essence. Thus it is said: water, being latent, stores the Five Essences.

Fire’s nature delights in soaring outward, thus it permeates the nose with the Five Odors—rank, putrid, fragrant, scorched, and rotten. Thus it is said: fire, being soaring, extends the Five Odors.

Wood’s nature delights in flourishing, thus it blooms into the Five Colors—blue-green, yellow, red, white, and black. Thus it is said: wood, being flourishing, blooms into the Five Colors.

Metal’s nature is firm and hard, thus when struck, it produces the Five Sounds—gong, shang, jue, zhi, and yu. When heard, these are the Five Sounds.

Earth’s nature is gentle and harmonious, thus it nourishes the Five Flavors—sour, salty, sweet, acrid, and bitter. Thus it is said: earth, being harmonious, nourishes the Five Flavors.

In their constancy, they are five; in their transformations, they are beyond reckoning. In their substances, they are five; in their admixtures, they are beyond reckoning.

Their constancy as five refers to the Five Constants: benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust. Benevolence pertains to wood, righteousness to metal, propriety to fire, wisdom to water, and trust to earth.

Their substances as five are metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.

Transformations are admixtures.

These Five Phases—metal, wood, water, fire, and earth—when observed above, become the Five Stars; when viewed below, become the Five Peaks; when positioned, become the Five Directions; when transformed, become the Five Colors; when struck, become the Five Sounds; when grouped, become the Five Surnames; when materialized, become the Five Metals; when vaporized, become the Five Odors; when concealed, become the Five Essences; when nourished, become the Five Flavors; when moved, become the Five Worms; when planted, become the Five Grains; when cultivated, become the Five Virtues; when corrupted, become the Five Thieves; within the body, become the Five Viscera; within the spirit, become the Five Spirits; within perception, become the Five Emotions.

Thus it is said: in their constancy, they are five; in their transformations, they are beyond reckoning. In their substances, they are five; in their admixtures, they are beyond reckoning.

Yet the myriad things between Heaven and Earth cannot be rigidly called ten thousand, nor rigidly called five, nor rigidly called one.

The Five Phases transform and give rise to the myriad things, teeming and bustling between Heaven and Earth. Their admixtures are beyond number—how could they be rigidly called ten thousand? Thus it is said: the myriad things between Heaven and Earth cannot be rigidly called ten thousand.

The myriad things belong to the Five Phases. In their constancy, they are five; in their transformations, they are beyond reckoning—how could they be rigidly called the Five Phases? Thus it is said: they cannot be rigidly called five.

The Five Phases belong to the One. The One unifies the billions, ceaselessly generating and transforming—how could it be rigidly called one? Thus it is said: they cannot be rigidly called one.

They cannot be rigidly called not ten thousand, nor rigidly called not five, nor rigidly called not one.

Between Heaven and Earth, the profusion of things—verdant and lush, teeming and bustling—how could they be merely called the myriad things? Thus it is said: they cannot be rigidly called not ten thousand.

Though the myriad things teem in abundance, they ultimately belong to the Five Phases. Thus it is said: they cannot be rigidly called not five.

Though the Five Phases transform beyond reckoning, they ultimately belong to the governance of the One Qi. Thus it is said: they cannot be rigidly called not one.

At times they unite, at times they separate—through this, form is necessarily determined; through this, number is necessarily determined; through this, qi is necessarily determined. Yet this is but self-exertion; things do not know me, nor do I know things.

At times the myriad things and Five Phases unite as One; at times the One Qi separates into the Five Phases and myriad things. Thus it is said: at times they unite, at times they separate.

Since there is union and separation, through this, the forms of the myriad things are necessarily determined. Thus it is said: through this, form is necessarily determined.

Through this, the myriad things necessarily belong to the numbers of the Five Phases. Thus it is said: through this, number is necessarily determined.

Through this, the Five Phases necessarily belong to the One Qi. Thus it is said: through this, qi is necessarily determined.

The prior distinctions of the myriad things, Five Phases, and One Qi all belong to deluded sentiment, having already fallen into the transformations of form, number, and qi. This is but self-exertion. If deluded sentiment returns to true nature, then things and self are thus, each unaware of the other, transcending the transformations of form, number, and qi. Thus it is said: yet this is but self-exertion; things do not know me, nor do I know things.

This chapter clarifies that as soon as deluded sentiment arises, one falls into the transformations of form, number, and qi. When deluded sentiment returns to its root, then form, number, and qi cannot be grasped or constrained.

**End of Second Chapter**

Master Guanyin said: Within my mind, the myriad things may arise. For where the mind goes, love follows; where love follows, essence follows.

The mind is fundamentally pure and quiescent, originally without a single thing, equal to the Great Void. Upon this pure mind, a deluded sentiment suddenly arises. Unaware of its delusion, sentiments follow one another in succession, accumulating into the myriad sentiments, and the myriad sentiments delude and stain the myriad things. As the scripture says: "One sentiment recognizes it, accumulating into the myriad sentiments; the myriad sentiments recognize it, accumulating into the myriad things." Thus it is said: within my mind, the myriad things may arise.

Where the mind’s deluded sentiment goes, it follows the beloved realm. Love pertains to water, and water pertains to essence. Where the mind’s sentiment loves a realm, the essence-spirit also follows. Thus it is said: where the mind goes, love follows; where love follows, essence follows.

"Goes" means to proceed.

Where the mind congeals, it first coagulates into water. When the mind longs for things, saliva flows; when the mind grieves for things, tears flow; when the mind feels shame for things, sweat flows.

The original qi pervades the body, manifesting in response to the mind’s feelings. Where the mind has attachments, it becomes bound by the realm to which it clings. Thus it is said: where the mind congeals.

When the mind first congeals and stagnates with things, the original qi transforms into water. If the mind longs for edible things it loves, the original qi within transforms into saliva and manifests. Thus it is said: it first congeals into water; when the mind longs for things, saliva flows. When the mind is moved by sorrow—such as the death of kin—grief suddenly arises, and the original qi within the eyes transforms into tears and manifests. Thus it is said: when the mind grieves for things, tears flow. When one commits unvirtuous deeds and shame suddenly arises upon seeing others, the original qi upon the face transforms into sweat and manifests. Thus it is said: when the mind feels shame for things, sweat flows.

There is no momentary state that does not endure, and no enduring state that does not change. "Momentary" means not enduring; "enduring" means constant stillness; "change" means movement. If one cannot awaken to the true emptiness and constant stillness of the mind’s essence due to fleeting thoughts of arising and ceasing, it is said: there is no momentary state that does not endure. If one cannot respond to the myriad movements of change with constant tranquility because the mind’s essence of true emptiness and stillness is not realized, it is said: there is no enduring state that does not change.

Water generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal, metal generates water—mutually engendering and overcoming without end. The heart viscus pertains to fire and houses the spirit; its emotional nature delights in joy. The liver viscus pertains to wood and houses the ethereal soul; its emotional nature delights in anger. The spleen viscus pertains to earth and houses intention; its emotional nature delights in contemplation. The lung viscus pertains to metal and houses the corporeal soul; its emotional nature delights in sorrow. The kidney viscus pertains to water and houses essence; its emotional nature delights in fear.

Essence generates the ethereal soul, so fear gives rise to anger—thus it is said: water generates wood. The ethereal soul generates the spirit, so anger gives rise to joy—thus it is said: wood generates fire. The spirit generates intention, so joy gives rise to contemplation—thus it is said: fire generates earth. Intention generates the corporeal soul, so contemplation gives rise to sorrow—thus it is said: earth generates metal. The corporeal soul generates essence, so sorrow gives rise to fear—thus it is said: metal generates water. The character "overcome" should be "generate," likely a scribal error; it should read "mutually generating and overcoming."

In mutual overcoming: water overcomes fire, fire overcomes metal, metal overcomes wood, wood overcomes earth, and earth overcomes water. The Five Phases mutually generate and overcome, giving rise to the myriad things of heaven and earth. The myriad things mutually generate and overcome in ways beyond calculation. Thus it is said: mutually generating and overcoming, without end.

The Infant and the Medicinal Maiden, the Golden Tower and the Crimson Palace, the Azure Dragon and the White Tiger, the Precious Cauldron and the Red Furnace—all are these things, yet there exists that which is not these things. The kidney viscus pertains to Kan (☵), and the yang line within Kan is called the Infant, the qi of original yang transformed from essence. The heart viscus pertains to Li (☲), and the yin line within Li is called the Medicinal Maiden, the spirit of the heart’s fluid. The lung viscus pertains to Dui (☱), which governs the twelve joints and is called the Golden Tower, also known as the Twelve-Storied Tower. The heart viscus pertains to fire, whose color is red, and is called the Crimson Palace. The liver viscus pertains to wood, houses the ethereal soul, and is green in color—called the Azure Dragon. The lung viscus pertains to metal, houses the corporeal soul, and is white in color—called the White Tiger. Thus it is said: the Infant and the Medicinal Maiden, the Golden Tower and the Crimson Palace, the Azure Dragon and the White Tiger.

The original qi within the body pertains to yang, and yang pertains to Qian (☰), which pertains to metal—thus it is called the Precious Cauldron. The spirit within the heart pertains to yin, and yin pertains to Kun (☷); the heart pertains to fire, whose color is red—thus it is called the Red Furnace. Body and mind are called the Qian-Kun Cauldron and Furnace. Since body and mind are the cauldron and furnace, spirit and qi are the medicinal substances. Thus it is said: the Precious Cauldron and the Red Furnace are all these things. "These things" refer to spirit and qi.

The Dao has no form or name; it is the ancestor of spirit and qi. The ancestor of spirit and qi is the inconceivable Dao. Thus it is said: there exists that which is not these things. This chapter clarifies how the Dao moves spirit and qi, transforming endlessly.

**Chapter Three**
Guan Yinzi said: Birds and beasts suddenly *yo-yo*, suddenly *xun-xun*, suddenly flee; plants and trees suddenly sprout, suddenly stand tall, suddenly wither. Heaven and earth cannot retain them, nor can the sage bind them.

*Yo-yo* is the sound of birds and beasts when their young are first born. *Xun-xun* describes birds and beasts growing large after several ten-day periods. "Flee" describes birds and beasts growing old and dying, vanishing like a person in flight. "Sprout" describes plants and trees first putting forth buds. "Stand tall" describes plants and trees growing large and erect. "Wither" describes plants and trees growing old and withering, their leaves fallen. It speaks of birds and beasts suddenly born, suddenly grown, and in an instant transformed into death. Thus it is said: birds and beasts suddenly *yo-yo*, suddenly *xun-xun*, suddenly flee. Plants and trees suddenly sprout, suddenly stand tall, and in an instant transformed into withering death. Thus it is said: plants and trees suddenly sprout, suddenly stand tall, suddenly wither.

Birds and beasts cannot but be born when it is time to be born, cannot but grow when it is time to grow, cannot but age when it is time to age, and cannot but die when it is time to die. These four—birth, growth, aging, and death—are the flowing of the great transformation. Even the vastness of heaven and earth and the spiritual powers of the sage cannot momentarily retain or bind them, preventing birth, growth, aging, and death. Thus it is said: heaven and earth cannot retain them, nor can the sage bind them.

Yet there is that which operates within. The Creator revolves the one qi, with yin-yang, the Five Phases, and the four seasons mutually pushing and stirring, generating and transforming without end. Thus it is said: there is that which operates within.

Being resides there; non-being resides here. The drum does not sound without being struck. Evenness resides there; oddness resides here. The mallet does not strike without the hand.

The workings of creation and transformation exist there, bound within the deluded emotions and the numerical patterns of form and qi—thus it is said: "Being resides there." The Way of true emptiness and nothingness abides here, in the heart that has awakened to clarity, merging obscurely with the Dao, no longer subject to form, qi, time, or numerical patterns. How then could the workings of creation transform it? Thus it is said: "Non-being resides here."

When the heart has awakened, false emotions do not arise, and the defilements of the external world are not clung to. Pure and still, it is like empty space—how could the Creator mold or cast empty space? When the heart is thus enlightened, it is like a drum that does not sound without being struck by the mallet—thus it is said: "The drum does not sound without being struck."

To be paired with the workings of creation is to dwell there in deluded emotion—thus it is said: "Evenness resides there." Not to be paired with the workings of creation is to stand alone and unmatched, abiding here in the awakened heart of true emptiness—thus it is said: "Oddness resides here." If the heart of true emptiness has not yet sprouted, how could there be deluded emotions or defilements of the external world? When true emptiness is thus, it is like a mallet that cannot strike the drum without the hand—thus it is said: "The mallet does not strike without the hand."

This chapter clarifies that to be deluded and defiled by the myriad things is to be unable to escape the great transformation, while to awaken to true emptiness is for the great transformation to be unable to alter one.

**Chapter Four**

Master Guan Yin said: It is all one thing.
The multitude are confused by names, seeing things but not the Dao. The worthy analyze its principles, seeing the Dao but not things.

The "one" is the undivided Dao. "Things" are the ten thousand things of heaven and earth. The ten thousand things of heaven and earth all rely on the undivided Dao for their existence—thus it is said: "It is all one thing." The Dao dwells within the ten thousand things of heaven and earth, omnipresent. The multitude are confused by the names of the ten thousand things, their hearts deluded and attached to things, seeing things but not the undivided Dao—thus it is said: "The multitude are confused by names, seeing things but not the Dao." The worthy can analyze affairs and principles, clearly and distinctly, perceiving the Dao while forgetting external things—thus it is said: "The worthy analyze its principles, seeing the Dao but not things."

The sage unites with heaven, seeing neither Dao nor things, for the one Dao is all Dao.
The sage, having awakened, obscurely harmonizes with the celestial truth, realizing the essence of the Dao and forgetting the name of the Dao—how much more so things? Thus it is said: "The sage unites with heaven, seeing neither Dao nor things." The origin of the Dao is undivided, and the Dao is omnipresent—thus it is said: "The one Dao is all Dao."

Not to grasp it is the Dao; to grasp it is a thing.
When the heart abides nowhere and the whole body is released, it obscurely harmonizes with the wondrous existence of true emptiness—thus it is said: "Not to grasp it is the Dao." When the heart abides somewhere, clinging to various extremes, it is deluded and pursues external things—thus it is said: "To grasp it is a thing."

This chapter clarifies that without thorough awakening, the worthy and the foolish alike remain deluded, while with complete clarity, the ordinary and the sage are not two.

**Chapter Five**

Master Guan Yin said: One who knows the falsity of things need not reject them. It is like clay oxen and wooden horses: though the emotions retain the names of oxen and horses, the heart forgets their reality.

"Knows" means to awaken. To awaken to the fact that all external things are false and illusory naturally prevents the heart from clinging, leaving it pure and still—there is no need to forcibly remove external things. Thus it is said: "One who knows the falsity of things need not reject them." To awaken to the falsity and illusoriness of all external things is to be naturally undefiled. It is like oxen made of clay or horses carved from wood: though the emotions retain the names and forms of oxen and horses, the heart naturally forgets their true reality—thus it is said: "It is like clay oxen and wooden horses: though the emotions retain the names of oxen and horses, the heart forgets their reality."

This chapter clarifies that awakening to the falsity of external things naturally leaves the heart pure and undefiled.

**Chapter Six**
*End of the Eighth Scroll of the Commentary on the Wenshi Zhenjing*

**Chapter Nine: The Nine Medicines**

The term "medicine" here denotes a comprehensive treatment, comprising thirty-one chapters in total.

Master Guan Yin said:
Do not take small matters lightly, for a tiny crack may sink a great ship;
Do not take small things lightly, for a tiny insect may poison the body;
Do not take petty men lightly, for petty men may plunder the state.

Those who study the Dao must accumulate even the slightest good, and eliminate even the smallest faults. Nothing should be treated lightly or neglected. Though a matter may seem trivial, it must not be dismissed with indifference. Just as a ship of ten thousand *hu*, though its hull may bear but a pinhole, will sink if the breach is not sealed, so it is said: "Do not take small matters lightly, for a tiny crack may sink a great ship."

"Must not" is an admonitory phrase, and "crack" refers to an opening. One must not treat small things with carelessness. For instance, a scorpion or a seven-inch snake, though small, may sting and poison a person if approached with undue confidence. Thus it is said: "Do not take small things lightly, for a tiny insect may poison the body."

One must not treat petty men with carelessness. Consider Huang Chao, the Red Eyebrows, and the Yellow Turbans—though they were but petty men, they brought ruin to the Han and Tang dynasties. How much more so for a state? Thus it is said: "Do not take petty men lightly, for petty men may plunder the state."

Only by attending to small matters can one accomplish great deeds;
Only by accumulating small things can one achieve great things;
Only by treating petty men with kindness can one align with great men.

"Matters" refer to application and practice. When one acts with impartiality and universal benefit, not neglecting even the smallest conduct, one may attain the supreme virtue of "non-virtue"—the ultimate virtue. This ultimate virtue is the great power of the Dao, hence it is said: "Only by attending to small matters can one accomplish great deeds."

"Small things" refer to minor deeds and subtle merits. One should protect even grasses, trees, and insects without harming them, benefiting all with wondrous existence like a timely rain that falls equally upon thorns, crops, pure and impure fields. Just as the great sea does not discriminate between clean and turbid waters but embraces all without distinction, so too does it become the king of all valleys. When such meritorious conduct accumulates to greatness, one becomes a sage or a worthy. Is this not the making of a great person? Thus it is said: "Only by accumulating small things can one achieve great things."

To treat all with benevolent virtue and universal benefit, without distinction between noble and petty men, and with equal compassion, is to win the hearts of people. All will revere and respect such a one, and thus one may align with the Dao of great men. Hence it is said: "Only by treating petty men with kindness can one align with great men."

Heaven cannot be relied upon to determine human affairs, nor can humans be relied upon to determine events. Only by relinquishing affairs and distancing oneself from others does the self remain within the self—whatever is fitting, let it be so.

A person’s nobility or baseness, wealth or poverty, longevity or early death, success or failure—these lie within the mandate of Heaven. How can one predetermine whether one will be good or evil, deluded or awakened, a petty man, a noble man, a worthy, or a sage? Thus it is said: "Heaven cannot be relied upon to determine human affairs."

"Affairs" refer to application. When applied to evil, one becomes a petty man; when applied to good, one becomes a noble man; when applied to virtue, one becomes a worthy; when applied to the Dao, one becomes a sage. How can human application be rigidly fixed? Thus it is said: "Nor can humans be relied upon to determine events."

If one abandons all entanglements, severs attachment to the appearances of others, and conceals all wondrous functions within non-action and purity, then the self will be unaware of its own existence. Life and death become spontaneous, neither acceptable nor unacceptable—free, unconstrained, and unbound. Thus it is said: "Only by relinquishing affairs and distancing oneself from others does the self remain within the self—whatever is fitting, let it be so."

There is no fixed rule for when to be elaborate or simple, when to be restrained or patient, when to be diligent or at ease.

There is no definitive method for establishing expedient means. When all practices are cultivated equally, without abandoning a single teaching yet sweeping away all excess to return to the root and practice simplicity, this is not permissible. Thus it is said: "There is no fixed rule for when to be elaborate or simple."

There is no fixed rule for when to combine vigilance with forbearance. To practice forbearance without vigilance is not permissible. Thus it is said: "When to be restrained or patient."

There is no fixed rule for when to be diligent in good conduct. To become lazy and cease diligence is not permissible. Thus it is said: "When to be diligent or at ease."

This chapter clarifies that by guarding against the subtle and blocking the gradual, and by not neglecting even the smallest conduct, one may become a worthy or a sage.

**End of Chapter One**

Master Guan Yin said:
The height of wisdom is to know that wisdom is ultimately insufficient to encompass all things, hence one becomes foolish;
The height of eloquence is to know that eloquence is ultimately insufficient to illuminate all things, hence one becomes reticent;
The height of courage is to know that courage is ultimately insufficient to overcome all things, hence one becomes timid.

Those of utmost wisdom can illuminate principles and penetrate the Dao, yet wisdom is truly insufficient to benefit all things. Knowing this, it is better to embrace the Dao through foolish obscurity. Thus it is said: "The height of wisdom is to know that wisdom is ultimately insufficient to encompass all things, hence one becomes foolish."

Those of utmost eloquence can clarify matters and principles, yet eloquence is truly insufficient to enlighten all beings in the world. It is better to nurture qi and spirit through reticence. Thus it is said: "The height of eloquence is to know that eloquence is ultimately insufficient to illuminate all things, hence one becomes reticent."

Those of utmost courage and strength may overcome ten or a hundred men, yet courage is truly insufficient to overcome all beings in the world. It is better to cultivate virtue through timidity, humility, and gentleness. Thus it is said: "The height of courage is to know that courage is ultimately insufficient to overcome all things, hence one becomes timid."

This chapter elucidates the flaws of wisdom, eloquence, and courage.

**End of Chapter Two**

Master Guan Yin said:
Among Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things, there is not a single thing that is mine. Things are not me, yet they cannot but respond; I am not me, yet I cannot but nurture myself.

**End of the Ninth Scroll of the Commentary on the Wenshi Zhenjing**

Qi circulates yin and yang, giving rise to Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things. Yet the source of qi was originally without thing. Since it was originally without thing, it is true emptiness. When things come to stir, it cannot but respond, yet in responding to things it remains ever quiescent. Thus it is said: "Among Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things, there is not a single thing that is mine." Things are not mine, yet they cannot but elicit response.

That which is I is the original. Qi circulates yin and yang, giving rise to the four great elements in temporary combination as this self. Yet the source of qi was originally without the four great elements in temporary combination as this self. Since it dwells in temporary combination, it cannot but rely on clothing and food to nurture it. Thus it is said: "I am not I, yet I cannot but nurture myself." That which is not I is the original.

Though it responds to things, there has never been any thing. Though it nurtures the self, there has never been any self. True emptiness and wondrous being—though it responds to things, it is like an echo in an empty valley: responding to change, it remains ever quiescent, and the valley has never held any sound. The response of true emptiness to things is likewise. Thus it is said: "Though it responds to things, there has never been any thing."

When one awakens to true emptiness, the four great elements are like a rented dwelling. Though one relies on clothing and food for nurture, within the twelve hours one abides solely in true emptiness, and true emptiness is without self. Thus it is said: "Though it nurtures the self, there has never been any self."

Do not say that one first externalizes things and then externalizes the self. Do not say that one first externalizes form and then externalizes the mind. The Dao is one and the same; it cannot be approached in stages.

To externalize is to forget. Since the body composed of the four great elements in temporary combination is like a rented dwelling, how is it different from things? Both are illusory and unreal. Once one understands that both are illusory, one forgets them all at once. One must not say that one first forgets the myriad things and then forgets the self. Thus it is said: "Do not say that one first externalizes things and then externalizes the self."

Form is the body of the four great elements. The mind is the mind of the five aggregates in false accumulation. Not only is the body composed of the four great elements no different from things, but the mind of the five aggregates in false accumulation is also no different from things. Both self and things, form and mind, are equally illusory and unreal. Once one awakens to their illusory nature, one forgets them all at once. One must not say that one first forgets the body and then forgets the mind of the five aggregates in false accumulation. Thus it is said: "Do not say that one first externalizes form and then externalizes the mind."

Since the Dao is not two, there is no division into inner and outer, things and self. How could it admit of sequential progression? Thus it is said: "The Dao is one and the same; it cannot be approached in stages."

The mind is the inner; form is the outer. This chapter elucidates the flaws of delusion and attachment to things, self, mind, and form.

**End of Chapter Three**

Master Guan Yin said:
One who scrutinizes the tip of a hair cannot see the vastness of Heaven and Earth. One who examines a faint sound cannot hear the crash of thunder.

To scrutinize is to examine closely. The tip of a hair refers to the fine point of an autumn hare’s fur. One who closely examines the tip of a hare’s autumn fur becomes attached to the subtle appearance of form and thus fails to perceive the vast appearance of Heaven and Earth. Thus it is said: "One who scrutinizes the tip of a hair cannot see the vastness of Heaven and Earth."

A faint sound refers to the sound of a gnat. The greatest sound of thunder is the crash of a thunderclap. One who closely examines the faint sound of a gnat thus fails to hear the great sound of thunder’s crashing roar. Thus it is said: "One who examines a faint sound cannot hear the crash of thunder."

One who sees the great cannot see the small. One who sees the near cannot see the far. One who hears the great cannot hear the small. One who hears the near cannot hear the far.

Not only does one who closely examines the tip of a hair fail to see the vastness of Heaven and Earth, but one who closely examines the vastness of Heaven and Earth also fails to see the tip of a hair. Thus it is said: "One who sees the great cannot see the small."

The near refers to what is close at hand. Not only does one who sees the great fail to see the small, but one who sees what is shallow and near also fails to see what is profound and distant—the true aspect of what lies before one. Thus it is said: "One who sees the near cannot see the far."

Not only does one who closely examines the sound of a gnat fail to hear the sound of thunder, but one who closely examines the sound of thunder also fails to hear the sound of a gnat. Thus it is said: "One who hears the great cannot hear the small."

Not only does one who hears the great fail to hear the small, but one who hears shallow, near sounds of indulgence also fails to hear the mighty sound beyond the kalpas. Thus it is said: "One who hears the near cannot hear the far."

The sage has nothing he sees, and thus can see all things; he has nothing he hears, and thus can hear all things.

What is seen is form; what is heard is sound. Thus, whether it be the tip of a hair or Heaven and Earth, though their forms differ in size, their nature as form is not different. Whether it be the sound of a gnat or thunder, though their sounds differ in magnitude, their nature as sound is not different. The sage has nothing he sees and nothing he hears because he does not cling to form or sound. One who does not cling to form or sound abides in true emptiness and luminous clarity, perceiving and hearing all without obstruction. Thus it is said: "The sage has nothing he sees, and thus can see all things; he has nothing he hears, and thus can hear all things."

This chapter elucidates the flaws of delusion and attachment to form and sound.

**End of Chapter Four**

Master Guan Yin said:
The eye sees countless things, yet some love gold and some love jade—this is to fixate on one form for the eye. The ear hears countless things, yet some love bells and some love drums—this is to fixate on one sound for the ear.

The eye beholds countless forms, yet roughly speaking, some love the yellow of gold, and some love the white of jade. If one loves the yellow of gold, one despises the white of jade; if one loves the white of jade, one despises the yellow of gold. Thus one must love and fixate on one form, resulting in the eye’s partial vision. Thus it is said: "The eye sees countless things, yet some love gold and some love jade—this is to fixate on one form for the eye."

The ear hears countless sounds, yet roughly speaking, some love the clear tones of bells, and some love the deep tones of drums. If one loves the clear tones of bells, one despises the deep tones of drums; if one loves the deep tones of drums, one despises the clear tones of bells. Thus one must love and fixate on one sound, resulting in the ear’s partial hearing. Thus it is said: "The ear hears countless things, yet some love bells and some love drums—this is to fixate on one sound for the ear."

Only the sage does not crave them, does not reject them, does not dwell in them. The sage who has realized the Dao sees through true emptiness, neither craving nor despising forms and sounds, nor needing to sweep them away. Why is this so? Because forms and sounds cannot abide in true emptiness. Thus it is said: Only the sage does not crave them, does not reject them, does not dwell in them. *Dwell* means to abide. This chapter cures the illness of delusion and attachment to love and aversion toward forms and sounds.

**End of Chapter Five**

Master Guan Yin said:
One who is good at the present can practice the ancient; one who is good at the branch can establish the root. *The present* refers to current human affairs; *the ancient* refers to the principles prior to the Five Ultimates. *The branch* refers to the Five Constants and the hundred practices; *the root* refers to the great root and great origin of the Dao. If one is skillful in applying current human affairs and the Five Constants and hundred practices with marvelous efficacy, one can respond to change without attachment, darkly accord with the principles prior to the Five Ultimates, and stand alone in the great root and great origin of the Dao. Thus it is said: One who is good at the present can practice the ancient; one who is good at the branch can establish the root. *Practice* means to be without attachment. This chapter cures the illness of delusion and attachment to the root and branch of affairs and principles, failing to awaken to the substance and function.

**End of Chapter Six**

Master Guan Yin said:
Cunning surpasses thieves and thus can capture thieves; courage surpasses tigers and thus can capture tigers. When the human heart’s cunning surpasses that of bandits, it can capture bandits. Thus it is said: Cunning surpasses thieves and thus can capture thieves. When human strength and courage surpass that of tigers and leopards, they can capture tigers and leopards. Thus it is said: Courage surpasses tigers and thus can capture tigers. This is a metaphor.

Only by overcoming the self can one perfect the self; only by overcoming things can one benefit things; only by forgetting the Dao can one possess the Dao. *Overcome* means to surpass; *the self* means selfishness. Only by skillfully overcoming one’s selfish desires can one perfect one’s supreme virtue. Thus it is said: Only by overcoming the self can one perfect the self. Only by skillfully overcoming deluded attachment to things and desires can one universally benefit beings and accomplish the marvelous practices of the ten thousand things. Thus it is said: Only by overcoming things can one benefit things. Only by skillfully forgetting the wisdom of realizing the Dao can one darkly accord with true emptiness and not lose the wondrous existence of the Dao of true emptiness. Thus it is said: Only by forgetting the Dao can one possess the Dao. *Possess* means not to lose wondrous existence. This chapter cures the illness of failing to forget the wisdom of realizing the Dao.

**End of Chapter Seven**

Master Guan Yin said:
If armor is hard, things will surely destroy it—what is rigid will break. If a blade is sharp, things will surely shatter it—what is keen will be blunted. *Armor* refers to chainmail. Though chainmail is hard, there are hard bows and strong crossbows whose arrows can pierce and destroy it. From this, we know that whatever is too rigid will be broken by something else. Thus it is said: If armor is hard, things will surely destroy it—what is rigid will break. If a blade’s edge is sharp, there are steel and stone that can damage its edge. From this, we know that whatever is too keen will be blunted by something else. Thus it is said: If a blade is sharp, things will surely shatter it—what is keen will be blunted. This is a metaphor.

The phoenix is revered for being rarely seen—thus the sage takes profundity as the root. The musk deer flees, leaving its fragrance uncaptured—thus the sage takes restraint as the guiding principle.

The two metaphors above—like the majestic phoenix, whose rarity and elusiveness make it wondrous—were it to appear frequently in the world, people would no longer revere it as rare and wondrous. Thus it is said: the phoenix is revered for being rarely seen. Following these metaphors, we understand that the sage conceals his radiance, aligning with the profound and obscure Dao, which is the root-source of the Five Ultimates, the Two Modes, the Five Constants, and the hundred practices. Thus it is said: the sage takes profundity as the root.

The musk deer, when pursued relentlessly, rips open its own musk sac and abandons it; seeing the deer without musk, people no longer hunt it. Thus it is said: the musk deer flees, leaving its fragrance uncaptured. From these successive metaphors, we understand that the sage restrains his sagely wisdom and spiritual powers, merging with true emptiness. Only when things come to move him does he respond of necessity, ever responding yet ever quiescent, never departing from the supreme Dao—like a net with its guiding cord, when drawn, all its meshes open in unison. Thus it is said: the sage takes restraint as the guiding principle. This is the synthesis of the metaphors.

This chapter elucidates the malady of being unable to subdue the strong or humble persuasions, as well as the affliction of failing to conceal sagely wisdom and spiritual powers.

**Chapter Eight**
Master Guan Yin said: A vessel has two openings. When filled with water and inverted, the water pours out; if one is sealed, the water does not flow down. For if it does not ascend, it does not descend. Though a well be a thousand *ren* deep, when drawn, the water rises—if it does not descend, it does not ascend.

The "vessel" is full. The vessel has openings at both ends. First, seal the lower opening and pour water into the vessel until it is full. Then, swiftly seal the upper opening, remove the lower seal, and invert it—the water does not flow out. Why? Because one opening is forcefully sealed, and the *qi* does not circulate. If the *qi* does not ascend and flow, the water does not descend. Thus it is said: a vessel has two openings; when filled with water and inverted, if one is sealed, the water does not flow down—for if it does not ascend, it does not descend.

A *ren* is seven *chi*. Though a well be seven thousand *chi* deep, when a bucket is lowered by rope and drawn, the water rises with it. Thus it is said: though a well be a thousand *ren* deep, when drawn, the water ascends. If the bucket is not lowered by rope, the water has no means to rise. Thus it is said: if it does not descend, it does not ascend. This is the metaphor.

Therefore, the sage does not precede things. From the foregoing metaphors—if it does not ascend, it does not descend; if it does not descend, it does not ascend—we understand that the sage does not precede things, and thus things do not precede the sage. "Does not precede" means the sage does not first exalt himself or act arrogantly toward others, and so others dare not act arrogantly toward the sage. Thus it is said: the sage does not precede things. "Things" refers to all beings. This chapter elucidates the malady of being unable to abide in the rear.

**Chapter Nine**
Master Guan Yin said: When people commit errors, though they suffer harm only after the error is made, in time, they secretly deliberate over what preceded the error. The deluded of the world, when employing their actions for unwholesome ends, err in their virtuous conduct. Though the harm of misfortune befalls them only after the loss of virtuous conduct, in time, they reflect and repent, privately pondering the good and ill, fortune and misfortune of their past actions before the error was made, and thereafter cautiously apply this understanding to their virtuous conduct.

Thus it is said: when people commit errors, though they suffer harm only after the error is made, in time, they secretly deliberate over what preceded the error. "Secretly" means privately. Only by not relying on one’s own intelligence but embracing the intelligence of others, naturally dissolving the self and embracing the selves of all under heaven, and practicing this throughout life, can one avoid error.

Only the enlightened person, having awakened to the wondrous Dao, does not rely on the intelligence of awakening to the wondrous Dao. Concealing its wondrous function, they incorporate the intelligence and use of others, adapting to what benefits all, and thus universally applying it. Naturally, there is no self. Thus it is said: only by not relying on one’s own intelligence but embracing the intelligence of others does the self naturally dissolve. In true emptiness, there is no self; responding to things, forms appear—like the moon universally reflected in all waters. The brightness of the moon in all waters is governed by the single moon in the sky. The intelligence of all under heaven is governed by the majestic light of the true emptiness of the Dao. With the majestic light of the true emptiness of the Dao, responding to change while abiding in constant quiescence, one remains unattached to any middle or extreme throughout life, enabling wondrous function and universal benefit without losing the Dao and virtue. Thus it is said: embracing the selves of all under heaven and practicing this throughout life, one can avoid error. "Practicing" means non-abiding; "applying" means using. This chapter elucidates the malady of being unable to dissolve the self and universally benefit others.

**Chapter Ten**
Master Guan Yin said: The customs of past and present differ; the customs of east, west, south, and north also differ. Even the virtues of a single household or individual vary—how could I cling to one pattern to constrain later generations?

From ancient times to the present, the customs of simplicity and decadence have varied. Thus it is said: the customs of past and present differ. The customs of the Eastern Yi, Western Rong, Southern Man, and Northern Di also vary. Thus it is said: the customs of east, west, south, and north also differ. Every household and every individual has its own preferences and virtues. Thus it is said: even the virtues of a single household or individual vary. The hearts and inclinations of people under heaven change with the times and differ in their directions—how could I cling to one fixed method and preemptively set a pattern for later generations? Thus it is said: how could I cling to one pattern to constrain later generations?

Only by adapting to the times and harmonizing with customs, anticipating the subtle and following events, relinquishing anger and restraining desires, simplifying things and forgiving others, weighing their relative importance and acting accordingly, can one naturally align with the unfathomable spirit and accord with the boundless Dao.

The greatly enlightened person alone can adapt to the times and change without self, harmonizing with the world without contrivance. First comprehending the living mechanism of true emptiness and wondrous existence, they respond only when things move them, ever responding yet ever quiescent. Thus it is said: only by adapting to the times and harmonizing with customs, anticipating the subtle and following events.

As stated above, having comprehended the living mechanism of true emptiness and wondrous existence, when things come to them, their heart harbors no anger; when assailed by the demon of beauty, their heart knows no attachment. Thus it is said: relinquishing anger and restraining desires. A heart without anger is to relinquish anger; a heart without attachment is to restrain desire. Thus it is said: restraining anger and blocking desire originate from this.

The greatly enlightened person does not indulge in external things but uses only what is necessary for sustenance, employing them only when unavoidable and not taking what is not righteous. Thus it is said: simplifying things. The greatly enlightened person, empty and preserving the true, pure yet accommodating all—like the vast sea, lowly in position, receiving both the clear and the turbid. Thus it is said: forgiving others.

Having embraced the capacity to accommodate all things and forgive others, their response to phenomena is like a mirror hung aloft—reflecting all forms without omitting beauty or ugliness. Their handling of affairs is like a balance scale—weighing all things without erring in lightness or heaviness. They act through non-action, yet nothing is left undone. Thus it is said: weighing the light and the heavy to act accordingly.

Having attained non-action wherein nothing is left undone, they employ the spirit that is not spirit, so that yin and yang cannot fathom them. Their essence is the unfathomable Dao, responding to change without fixed method. Thus it is said: naturally aligning with the spirit’s unfathomability, harmonizing with the Dao without fixed form.

This chapter elucidates the cure for the illness of failing to respond with living mechanism and adapt to the times.

**Chapter Eleven**
Master Guan Yin said: There are those who form bonds through the Dao, those who form bonds through virtue, and those who form bonds through affairs.

The greatly enlightened, having awakened to the wondrous Dao, seek those of like realization as inseparable companions. Thus it is said: those who form bonds through the Dao. Noble persons who practice myriad virtues together become friends beyond the constraints of age. Thus it is said: those who form bonds through virtue. Those who collaborate in public or private affairs may find mutual affinity and thus form bonds. Thus it is said: those who form bonds through affairs.

Bonds through the Dao are like father and son, transcending right and wrong, worthy and unworthy—thus they endure. Bonds through virtue may involve right and wrong, worthy and unworthy—thus they may unite or part. Bonds through affairs part when the affair ends.

Those who have together awakened to the Dao form inseparable bonds, like the intimacy of father and son, forgetting right and wrong, worthy and unworthy, and roaming beyond the realm of phenomena. Like water, their friendship never severs. Thus it is said: bonds through the Dao are like father and son, transcending right and wrong, worthy and unworthy—thus they endure. Noble persons who prioritize virtue and conduct may form bonds, yet cannot be without intention, thus distinguishing right from wrong, worthy from unworthy, and experiencing union or separation. Thus it is said: bonds through virtue may involve right and wrong, worthy and unworthy—thus they may unite or part. Those who do not hold the Dao and virtue in their hearts, collaborating in public or private affairs and forming bonds through worldly etiquette, may unite in affairs yet remain distant in sentiment. At the slightest discord, their bonds sever. Thus it is said: bonds through affairs part when the affair ends.

As *Zhuangzi* said: "The gentleman’s bonds are as bland as water; the petty person’s bonds are as sweet as wine. The gentleman’s blandness fosters closeness; the petty person’s sweetness leads to rupture."

This chapter elucidates the cure for the illness of failing to form bonds through the Dao.

Master Guan Yin said: Do not mistake clumsiness and coarseness for the substance of the Dao—one should delight in nimbleness and quickness. Do not mistake ignorance and obscurity for the obscurity of the Dao—one should delight in lightness and clarity. Do not mistake arrogance and disdain for the loftiness of the Dao—one should delight in harmony and unity. Do not mistake boundless dissipation for the vastness of the Dao—one should delight in essential urgency. Do not mistake secluded sorrow for the stillness of the Dao—one should delight in joy and ease.

The words of the ancients on learning are often flawed and must be remedied. One must not claim dullness, clumsiness, or coarseness as the plainness of the Dao—rather, one should delight in keen, swift, and penetrating awakening. Thus it is said: Do not mistake clumsiness and coarseness for the substance of the Dao—one should delight in nimbleness and quickness. One must not claim foolishness, ignorance, or darkness as the concealment of learning the Dao—rather, one should delight in lightness and clarity. Thus it is said: Do not mistake ignorance and obscurity for the obscurity of the Dao—one should delight in lightness and clarity. One must not claim arrogance and disdain toward others as the loftiness of virtue and power—rather, one should delight in humility, harmonious radiance, and untainted unity with the world. Thus it is said: Do not mistake arrogance and disdain for the loftiness of the Dao—one should delight in harmony and unity. One must not claim boundless dissipation and empty chaos as the vastness of the Dao—rather, one should delight in awakening to true emptiness as the essential and wondrous, and in the marvelous existence of responsive urgency. Thus it is said: Do not mistake boundless dissipation for the vastness of the Dao—one should delight in essential urgency. One must not claim dwelling in seclusion with a sorrowful heart as the stillness of learning the Dao—rather, one should delight in carefree joy and untainted purity. Thus it is said: Do not mistake secluded sorrow for the stillness of the Dao—one should delight in joy and ease.

These five—clumsiness, ignorance, arrogance, dissipation, and sorrow—are but the words of ancients who, in their enlightened clarity, feigned madness to blend with the world. Later learners, failing to awaken, took them as literal truth and followed them, turning them into the maladies of learning the Dao. These must be cured with the medicine of corrective words. Thus it is said: The words of the ancients on learning are often flawed and must be remedied. This chapter elucidates the cure for the illness of failing to awaken to the ancients’ words.

Master Guan Yin said: One must not condemn the world while affirming oneself, nor belittle others while exalting oneself. One must not slight the Dao while presuming one’s own attainment, nor slander virtue while claiming one’s own possession of it. One must not disparage others’ talents while boasting of one’s own.

Those who study the Dao must not fixate on others’ faults, opening the eye of illness and deeming the whole world wrong while relying on their own abilities to fuel self-righteousness. Thus it is said: One must not condemn the world while affirming oneself. Those who study the Dao must not regard others as base and lowly while elevating themselves. Thus it is said: One must not belittle others while exalting oneself. Those who study the Dao must not treat others with disdain and arrogance, assuming they have not awakened to the wondrous Dao while presuming their own attainment. Thus it is said: One must not slight the Dao while presuming one’s own attainment. Those who study the Dao must not incessantly slander others as devoid of virtue while claiming virtue for themselves. Thus it is said: One must not slander virtue while claiming one’s own possession of it. Those who study the Dao must not regard others as vulgar, foolish, and untalented while boasting of their own talents and learning. Thus it is said: One must not disparage others’ talents while boasting of one’s own. This chapter elucidates the cure for the illness of failing to forget the self, others, abilities, and possessions.

Master Guan Yin said: To confound the world’s wisest is not through wisdom but through foolishness. To exhaust the world’s most eloquent is not through eloquence but through inarticulateness. To subdue the world’s bravest is not through bravery but through timidity.

True emptiness and profound obscurity cannot be known or recognized through wisdom. Thus, those who confound the world’s wisest are not the wise but those who, like the enlightened, remain silent and concealed as if foolish—even the world’s wise cannot fathom them. Thus it is said: To confound the world’s wisest is not through wisdom but through foolishness. The Dao is originally nameless and cannot be grasped through speech or debate. The world’s most eloquent, when faced with this, are exhausted and left without words. Those who have awakened to the Dao find it difficult to explain to others; it is better to remain inarticulate and speechless. Thus it is said: To exhaust the world’s most eloquent is not through eloquence but through inarticulateness. Those who have awakened to the wondrous Dao preserve their inner being through non-action and stillness, and protect their outer being through humility, softness, and non-contention. None in the world who love to contend can contend with those who do not contend—thus, they become invincible. Through the virtue of non-contention, one can subdue the world’s bravest, not through contention. Thus it is said: To subdue the world’s bravest is not through bravery but through timidity. Timidity here means softness and weakness. This chapter elucidates the cure for the illness of failing to forget wisdom, eloquence, and bravery.

Master Guan Yin said: Heaven cannot make lotuses bloom in winter or chrysanthemums in spring—thus the sage does not defy the seasons. Nor can earth make oranges grow in Luoyang or foxes and raccoon-dogs thrive in the south—thus the sage does not defy customs.

Lotus flowers bloom in summer, chrysanthemums in autumn. Heaven cannot make lotuses bloom in winter or chrysanthemums in spring. Thus, the sage does not go against the four seasons of heaven or defy the openings and closings of time. Thus it is said: Heaven cannot make lotuses bloom in winter or chrysanthemums in spring—thus the sage does not defy the seasons.

Luoyang refers to the region of Song and Luo. Oranges are citrus fruits that thrive in the warmth of the south. When transplanted to the banks of the Luo River in Songshan, they transform into bitter oranges. The waters of Mount Wen form the Wen River, located in the Wu-Yue region. Foxes and raccoon-dogs live in the highlands and wilds north of the Yangtze, but perish when brought to the damp lowlands of the south. These differences arise from the earth’s qi. Since the earth cannot make oranges grow in Luoyang or raccoon-dogs thrive in the south, the sage does not defy the customs of the Yi, Di, Man, and Rong peoples or those of the Central States. Thus it is said: Nor can earth make oranges grow in Luoyang or foxes and raccoon-dogs thrive in the south—thus the sage does not defy customs.

The sage cannot make hands walk or feet grasp, thus the sage does not defy the strengths of the self. The sage cannot make fish fly or birds gallop, thus the sage does not defy the strengths of others. Digging is the strength of the hand, walking the strength of the foot—how could even a sage make hands walk or feet grasp, exchanging their functions? Thus the sage does not defy the six faculties’ inherent strengths. Hence it is said: The sage cannot make hands walk or feet grasp, thus the sage does not defy the strengths of the self. Strength lies in what one can do, weakness in what one cannot. Fish excel at swimming in water, birds at soaring in the sky, and galloping is the swiftness of horses—how could even a sage alter the swimming of fish, the flight of birds, or the gallop of horses? Thus the sage does not defy the strengths of others. Hence it is said: The sage cannot make fish fly or birds gallop, thus the sage does not defy the strengths of others.

Such is the Way: it may move or halt, conceal or reveal, yet remains unbound. This refers to the four principles mentioned above—where the sage does not defy the times, does not defy customs, does not defy the self’s strengths, and does not defy others’ strengths. Adhering to these four, one may act when the time is right without defying the time’s movement, rest when the time is right without defying the time’s stillness, conceal when the time is right without defying the time’s obscurity, and reveal when the time is right without defying the time’s clarity. Only by not resisting the transformations of creation and not clinging to rigid methods can one respond endlessly to change and embody the subtle Dao. Hence it is said: Such is the Way—it may move or halt, conceal or reveal, yet remains unbound.

This chapter cures the ailment of failing to adapt to the times.

**Chapter Sixteen**
Master Guan Yin said: Those who speak little are not resented by others; those who act little are not criticized by others; those who use little wisdom are not wearied by others; those who display little ability are not employed by others.

Those who study the Dao guard their words and moderate their speech to avoid faults, thus escaping the resentment of the multitude. Hence it is said: Those who speak little are not resented by others. In the arena of profit and fame, those who restrain their conduct and limit their actions avoid the envy and obstruction of others. Hence it is said: Those who act little are not criticized by others. Those who conceal their wisdom and use it sparingly avoid the toil imposed by others. Hence it is said: Those who use little wisdom are not wearied by others. Those who appear clumsy yet temper their skills avoid being enslaved by others. Hence it is said: Those who display little ability are not employed by others.

This chapter cures the ailment of failing to forget words, actions, wisdom, and ability.

**Chapter Seventeen**
Master Guan Yin said: Hold fast to sincerity, act with simplicity, respond with forbearance, and answer in silence—thus my Dao knows no end.

To "hold fast" is to maintain; "sincerity" is truthfulness; "simplicity" is absence of excess; "to act" is to proceed without attachment; "to respond" is to engage; "forbearance" is magnanimity and tolerance. Realizing the truth of emptiness and existence, one preserves and upholds without clinging to any extreme—thus one’s actions are simple and uncluttered. Hence it is said: Hold fast to sincerity, act with simplicity. When dwelling among others or leading the multitude, one responds with magnanimity and tolerance, overlooking others’ faults to preserve one’s own virtue. Hence it is said: Respond with forbearance. If someone comes seeking answers, one subtly gestures without resorting to verbal instruction, allowing the keen-minded to awaken instantly—thus the Dao one has realized knows no bounds. Hence it is said: Answer in silence—thus my Dao knows no end.

This chapter cures the ailment of failing to embody sincerity, simplicity, forbearance, and silence.

**Chapter Eighteen**
Master Guan Yin said: Plan according to affairs, decide according to principle, act through people, and succeed through Heaven. Model affairs on the present, model principles on the past; affairs align with others, but the Dao is one’s own.

When scheming for worldly matters, one judges by principle to ensure appropriateness. Hence it is said: Plan according to affairs, decide according to principle. The effort or lack thereof lies with human action, but success or failure rests with Heaven’s decree. Hence it is said: Act through people, succeed through Heaven. Model affairs on those of the present, and principles on those of the past. Hence it is said: Model affairs on the present, model principles on the past. Affairs are means—though one’s use of them may align with others, the realization of the subtle Dao, the constant stillness in response, and the untainted purity set one apart. Hence it is said: Affairs align with others, but the Dao is one’s own.

This chapter cures the ailment of failing to harmonize affairs and principles.

**Chapter Nineteen**
Master Guan Yin said: Gold and jade are hard to discard, while earth and stone are easy to abandon. Those who study the Dao, when encountering subtle words or wondrous deeds, must not cling to them—for they are to be practiced, not grasped. To grasp them is a malady of the heart, incurable by any medicine.

Gold and jade symbolize the words and deeds of sages, while earth and stone symbolize the words and deeds of ordinary people. Though gold and jade are precious, they become dust in the eye—the great Dao leaves no trace, and thus words and deeds cannot be equaled. Students of the Dao find it difficult to forget the words and deeds of sages, just as people find it hard to discard gold and jade. Hence it is said: Gold and jade are hard to discard. Students of the Dao easily forget the words and deeds of ordinary people, just as people readily abandon earth and stone. Hence it is said: Earth and stone are easy to abandon. When students of the Dao encounter the subtle words or wondrous deeds of sages, they must not cling to them. Hence it is said: Those who study the Dao, when encountering subtle words or wondrous deeds, must not cling to them.

The wondrous deeds of sages may be practiced to cultivate virtue, yet one must not cling to the traces of those wondrous deeds. Hence it is said: They may be practiced but not clung to. Those who cling to them are like one whose skin bears disease—easily cured—but if the illness lies in the heart and belly, even the physicians Lu and Bian Que cannot heal it. Those who cling to the traces of sages’ wondrous deeds are likewise afflicted. Hence it is said: Those who cling to them suffer a malady of the heart and belly for which no medicine exists. This chapter cures the ailment of being unable to forget words and deeds.

**Chapter Twelve**

Master Guan Yin said: Those who fail to recognize urgent matters and instead pursue many affairs, other affairs, or strange affairs will meet with poverty, distress, and misfortune. Urgent matters are the Dao and virtue; many affairs are the ten thousand dharmas; other affairs are peripheral arts and skills; strange affairs are the heterodoxies of other worlds. If students of the Dao do not understand that the Dao and virtue are the simplest and most pressing matters, but instead become mired in the ten thousand dharmas, or study peripheral minor arts, or learn the crafts of medicine, divination, and labor, or pursue the strange heterodoxies of other worlds—though their studies differ, their loss of the Dao is one and the same. Losing the Dao, they fall into the wheel of rebirth, drifting through kalpas of dust without hope of escape. No poverty, distress, or misfortune is greater than this. Hence it is said: Those who fail to recognize urgent matters and instead pursue many affairs, other affairs, or strange affairs will meet with poverty, distress, and misfortune. "Pursue" means to become mired; "meet with" means to fall into the wheel of rebirth.

Moreover, the Dao is nowhere absent—one cannot abandon this to seek that. "This" refers to the urgent matters of the body, mind, Dao, and virtue; "that" refers to many affairs, other affairs, and strange affairs. Students of the Dao must realize that the Dao is nowhere absent, that this very body and mind are the Dao. Since the Dao is nowhere absent, how could it not reside in the body and mind? The body and mind arise from the Dao as waves arise from water—thus the waves are water, and likewise this body and mind are the Dao. Once one awakens to the truth that this body and mind are the Dao, one must not abandon them to seek the Dao in many affairs, other affairs, or strange affairs. Hence it is said: Moreover, the Dao is nowhere absent—one cannot abandon this to seek that. This chapter cures the ailment of failing to make the Dao one’s primary pursuit.

**Chapter Twenty-One**

Master Guan Yin said: Among the principles of the world, to abandon the intimate for the distant, the root for the branches, the worthy for the foolish, the near for the far—these may be tolerated briefly, but over time they bring harm. The intimate is one’s nature and life; the distant is wealth and sensuality. The root is the Dao; the branches are the five constants, the hundred practices, and the ten thousand dharmas. The worthy are the virtues of wisdom; the foolish are delusion and confusion. The near is compassion and goodness; the far is the multitude of evils.

The principles of the world lead students of the Dao astray, causing them to abandon their nature, life, Dao, virtue, compassion, and goodness, and instead become mired in wealth, sensuality, the ten thousand dharmas, delusion, and the multitude of evils. This may bring fleeting pleasure to deluded emotions, but prolonged attachment without awakening leads to the wheel of rebirth, birth and death, wombs, eggs, moisture, and transformation, without end. No harm is greater than this. Hence it is said: Among the principles of the world, to abandon the intimate for the distant, the root for the branches, the worthy for the foolish, the near for the far—these may be tolerated briefly, but over time they bring harm. This chapter cures the ailment of failing to awaken to the Dao.

**Chapter Twenty-Two**

Master Guan Yin said: Those who discoursed on the Dao in ancient times described it as concentrated stillness, profound depth, limpid clarity, vast emptiness, or obscure darkness—do not encounter such descriptions and grow fearful or retreat. "Concentrated" means settled; "stillness" means quiescent; "profound" means secluded. The ancients who discoursed on the Dao sometimes spoke of it as perfect stability and tranquility, sometimes as deep and unfathomable, sometimes as clear and abyssal like water, sometimes as vast and boundless like empty space, or sometimes as hidden, obscure, and inscrutable. If students encounter these five descriptions—concentrated stillness, profound depth, limpid clarity, vast emptiness, or obscure darkness—they must not grow fearful, thinking the Dao too difficult to study, and thus become negligent. Hence it is said: Those who discoursed on the Dao in ancient times described it as concentrated stillness, profound depth, limpid clarity, vast emptiness, or obscure darkness—do not encounter such descriptions and grow fearful or retreat.

The supreme principle of the world ultimately transcends words and concepts. If one truly knows that it is neither words nor concepts but lies beyond those subtle words and wondrous meanings, one will accord with my teaching. The supreme principle of the world is the Dao; "ultimately" means in the end. The five descriptions previously mentioned—concentrated stillness, profound depth, limpid clarity, vast emptiness, and obscure darkness—all belong to the realm of nominal appearances and deluded emotions. The Dao itself is nameless and without emotion; when thoroughly investigated to its ultimate end, it ultimately transcends words and concepts. Hence it is said: The supreme principle of the world ultimately transcends words and concepts. If one truly knows that it cannot be reached by words or concepts, and that it lies before the subtle words and wondrous meanings of the ancients, one will suddenly awaken, thoroughly perceive the originally complete and self-sufficient Dao, which is inherently pure and requires no cultivation or external seeking. Such awakening accords with the meaning of my teaching. Hence it is said: If one truly knows that it is neither words nor concepts but lies beyond those subtle words and wondrous meanings, one will accord with my teaching. "Beyond" means before; "truly" means sincerely. This chapter cures the ailment of failing to understand the roots and dusts of perception.

**Chapter Twenty-Three**

Master Guan Yin said: The great words of sages are like gold and jade; their small words are like platycodon and plantain. When used appropriately, platycodon and plantain give life; when used inappropriately, gold and jade bring death.

**Chapter Twenty-Four**

Master Guan Yin said: The great words of sages, such as the *Dao De Jing* and the *Yin Fu Jing*, are as precious as gold and jade—hence it is said, "The great words of sages are gold and jade." Platycodon is the name of an herb that cures wind-dampness. Plantain, also called *cheqian* grass, treats red-and-white dysentery. Small words refer to later sages’ poems, lyrics, direct sayings, and recorded dialogues. If one awakens to the Dao through poems, lyrics, direct sayings, or recorded dialogues, it is like using platycodon and plantain to cure wind-dampness and dysentery, restoring health and life—hence it is said, "Small words are platycodon and plantain; when used appropriately, platycodon and plantain give life." "Used appropriately" means curing illness; "give life" means restoring vitality. Yet if one recites the *Dao De Jing* and the *Yin Fu Jing* as if flowing water but fails to awaken to the Dao, it is like taking gold and jade as medicine—unable to cure wind-dampness or dysentery, leading to death. Hence it is said, "When used inappropriately, gold and jade bring death." "Bring death" means losing life; "inappropriately" means failing to cure illness. This chapter cures the ailment of distinguishing between refined and coarse scriptural words.

**Chapter Twenty-Five**

Master Guan Yin said: When speaking of a certain matter, Person A says it is beneficial, Person B says it is harmful, Person C says it may be beneficial or harmful, and Person D says it is both beneficial and harmful—one must necessarily fall into one of these. But those who speak of the Dao do not speak. "Certain" is a placeholder term. People’s views differ when discussing matters: Person A (named *Jia*) argues that a matter benefits the world; Person B (named *Yi*) argues that another matter harms it—hence it is said, "When speaking of a certain matter, Person A says it is beneficial, Person B says it is harmful." Person C (named *Bing*) argues that a matter may benefit or harm the world—hence it is said, "Person C says it may be beneficial or harmful." Person D (named *Ding*) argues that if a matter is conducted rightly, it benefits the world, but if conducted wrongly, it harms it—hence it is said, "Person D says it is both beneficial and harmful." Though Persons A, B, C, and D differ in their judgments of benefit and harm, one of them must necessarily be correct and aligned with principle—hence it is said, "one must necessarily fall into one of these." "Fall" means to align. The Dao has no name and cannot be compared through words; it is realized only through awakening in the heart, unlike matters that can be compared in terms of benefit and harm—hence it is said, "Those who speak of the Dao do not speak." This chapter cures the ailment of failing to relinquish considerations of benefit and harm.

**Chapter Twenty-Six**

Master Guan Yin said: Matters have their place in matters, and words have their principle in words. The Dao has no place in the Dao, and words have no principle in words. One who knows that words have no principle finds every word to be the Dao; one who does not know that words have no principle, though holding the most profound words, becomes obstructed and blinded. Worldly affairs each have their proper place, and every matter discussed has its own principle—hence it is said, "Matters have their place in matters, and words have their principle in words." The Dao has no fixed place, nor does it belong to names, words, or principles. The words of sages are all wordless words, pointing to the meaning beyond words. If one awakens to the wordless words, realizing they do not belong to matters or principles, then though one speaks all day, one has never truly spoken, and every word is the Dao. "Knows" means awakens. If one does not awaken to the wordless words that transcend matters and principles, though holding the words of the most realized ones before the eye of the Dao, it is like an obstruction in the throat or dust in the eye—hence it is said, "One who does not know that words have no principle, though holding the most profound words, becomes obstructed and blinded." *Yi* should be *yi* (blindness). This chapter cures the ailment of failing to relinquish attachment to matters and principles.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven**

Master Guan Yin said: It is easy not to trust foolish people, but difficult not to trust worthy ones. It is easy not to trust worthy people, but difficult not to trust sages. It is easy not to trust one sage, but difficult not to trust a thousand sages. "Not to trust" means not to cling or become attached. The words and deeds of foolish people are easily relinquished without attachment, but those of worthy people are harder to forget—hence it is said, "It is easy not to trust foolish people, but difficult not to trust worthy ones." It is also easy to relinquish attachment to the words and deeds of worthy people, but those of sages are harder to forget—hence it is said, "It is easy not to trust worthy people, but difficult not to trust sages." It is also easy to relinquish attachment to the words and deeds of one sage, but those of a thousand sages are even harder to forget—hence it is said, "It is easy not to trust one sage, but difficult not to trust a thousand sages." One who does not trust a thousand sages sees neither others nor self, neither the Dao above nor matters below. If a learner does not cling to the words and deeds of a thousand sages, the mind forgets names and traces, merging obscurely with the Dao, transcending the distinctions of sages, self, matters, and principles—hence it is said, "Not admiring the many sages, not valuing one’s own spirit" refers precisely to this. Thus it is said, "One who does not trust a thousand sages sees neither others nor self, neither the Dao above nor matters below." The Dao is principle. This chapter cures the ailment of failing to relinquish attachment to the ordinary and the sagely.

**Chapter Twenty-Eight**

Master Guan Yin said: The words of sages are dim and hazy, thereby making people deaf. The words of sages are dark and obscure, thereby making people blind. The words of sages are deep and heavy, thereby making people wounded. The words of sages are all wordless words, leading people to awaken to the meaning beyond words. This meaning beyond words does not belong to sound, so learners become dim and confused, their deluded feelings veiling them—unable to hear it, as if struck deaf. Hence it is said, "The words of sages are dim and hazy, thereby making people deaf."

The meaning beyond words does not pertain to form—dim and obscure, invisible when gazed upon, leaving people as if afflicted with blindness. Hence it is said, "The words of sages are dark and obscure, thereby making people blind."

The meaning beyond words does not pertain to names—profound and still, difficult to discuss in speech, leaving people as if stricken with emaciation and spasms. Hence it is said, "The words of sages are deep and heavy, thereby making people wounded."

Only the deaf do not hear sound; only the blind do not see form; only the wounded do not utter speech.

Only those afflicted with deafness cannot hear sound—thus it is said, "Only the deaf do not hear sound." Only those afflicted with blindness cannot see form—thus it is said, "Only the blind do not see form." Only those afflicted with emaciation and spasms cannot speak—thus it is said, "Only the wounded do not utter speech."

Those who do not hear sound do not hear the Dao, do not hear matters, do not hear the self. Those who do not see form do not see the Dao, do not see matters, do not see the self. Those who do not utter speech do not speak of the Dao, do not speak of matters, do not speak of the self.

The meaning beyond words, though inaudible when listened to, is not unlike the deaf who also cannot hear the sounds of the Dao, matters, or the self. Hence it is said, "Those who do not hear sound do not hear the Dao, do not hear matters, do not hear the self." The meaning beyond words, though invisible when gazed upon, is not unlike the blind who also cannot see the forms of the Dao, matters, or the self, nor do they generate such perceptions. Hence it is said, "Those who do not see form do not see the Dao, do not see matters, do not see the self." The meaning beyond words, though indescribable in speech, is not unlike those afflicted with emaciation and spasms who cannot speak—nor can they name the Dao, matters, or the self. Hence it is said, "Those who do not utter speech do not speak of the Dao, do not speak of matters, do not speak of the self."

This chapter cures the ailment of failing to relinquish attachment to form, sound, names, the Dao, matters, and the self.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine**

Master Guan Yin said: People merely recognize that within false attainment lies true loss, yet fail to see that within true attainment lies true loss. They merely recognize that within false affirmation lies true negation, yet fail to see that within true affirmation lies true negation.

Learners cling to deluded attainment, mistaking it for genuine loss in the supreme Dao, unaware that even true attainment is a genuine loss in the supreme Dao—just as gold dust, though real, becomes an obstruction when it enters the eye. Hence it is said, "People merely recognize that within false attainment lies true loss, yet fail to see that within true attainment lies true loss."

The false is illusion; the true is sincerity; "merely" denotes ignorance.

Learners discuss knowledge, clinging to deluded affirmation as if it were genuine negation, unaware that clinging to true affirmation is also genuine negation. Hence it is said, "They merely recognize that within false affirmation lies true negation, yet fail to see that within true affirmation lies true negation."

This chapter cures the ailment of failing to relinquish attachment to the real and the illusory.

**Chapter Thirty**

Master Guan Yin said: Speaking of the Dao is like speaking of dreams. Those who speak of dreams say: such gold and jade, such vessels, such birds and beasts. The speaker can describe them but cannot take and give them; the listener can hear but cannot receive and obtain them. Only the adept listener neither clings nor disputes.

Those of great awakening and thorough comprehension are like one who awakens from a dream, only then realizing that all perceived within the dream was the fabrication of deluded, inverted perceptions. Those who have not attained great awakening and thorough comprehension, though their perceptions may comprehend all phenomena, expound the wondrous Dao to others—all is but dreaming within a dream. Hence it is said, "Speaking of the Dao is like speaking of dreams."

Speaking of dreams within a dream, one says: I dreamed of such golden treasures and towering mountains, vast and immeasurable; such jade caverns, boundless and profoundly deep. These two metaphors illustrate the Dao and virtue as numinous treasures and mysterious caverns—vast, profound, immeasurable, and unfathomable. Hence it is said, "Those who speak of dreams say: such gold and jade."

Again, speaking of dreams within a dream, one says: I dreamed of such jade vessels and golden utensils, countless in their use. This metaphor illustrates the establishment of wondrous functions, universally benefiting all virtuous practices. Hence it is said, "Such vessels."

Again, speaking of dreams within a dream, one says: I dreamed of such crows and hares, tortoises and phoenixes, dragons and tigers. This metaphor illustrates the golden crow and jade hare, the black tortoise and vermilion phoenix, the white tiger and azure dragon—yin and yang in transformation. Hence it is said, "Such birds and beasts."

Speaking of dreams within a dream, one describes such gold, jade, vessels, birds, and beasts, yet the speaker can only describe them and cannot take the gold, jade, vessels, birds, or beasts to give to the listener. This metaphor illustrates that the sage cannot manifest the Dao to present to the learner. Hence it is said, "The speaker can describe them but cannot take and give them."

Those who listen to the dream within a dream only hear of such gold, jade, vessels, birds, and beasts but cannot receive or obtain them. This metaphor illustrates that those who study the Dao, through the master’s skillful guidance, awaken in an instant—not obtaining from without. Hence it is said, "The listener can hear but cannot receive and obtain them."

Only those of keen faculties, adept at hearing the profound and wondrous Dao, neither cling to words nor dispute the sage’s wordless speech. They merely, through the sage’s wordless speech, awaken to the meaning beyond words, realizing the inconceivable Dao. Hence it is said, "Only the adept listener neither clings nor disputes."

This chapter cures the ailment of failing to awaken from the affliction of discoursing on the Dao.

Lord Guan Yinzi said: Let your Dao be round, your virtue square, your conduct level, and your affairs sharp.

"You" refers to those who study the Dao. Among all who study the Dao in the world, if they can but read carefully and recite thoroughly these nine chapters, refining and delving into them, investigating and penetrating them, they will naturally awaken to the inconceivable Supreme Dao—each person possessing it in full, every individual perfected in its completeness, without need of cultivation or effort, their station equal to that of all sages. Hence it is said, "Let your Dao be round."

"Square" means upright; "virtue" is the function of the Dao. Among all who study the Dao in the world, if through the scripture they awaken to the inconceivable Supreme Dao, they must still safeguard, uphold, and preserve it. How to safeguard, uphold, and preserve it? Simply by maintaining non-action and purity, wandering carefree and at ease, neither clinging nor attaching to guard within; by humility and gentleness, not contending with things to guard without. Furthermore, rectify its wondrous function, applying it among the multitude, benefiting beings and pacifying people without seeking repayment or gratitude—all this is the upright application of it, thereby perfecting the highest virtue. Hence it is said, "Let your virtue be square."

Among all students of the Dao in the world, if through the scripture they awaken to the inconceivable Supreme Dao and safeguard, uphold, and preserve it to perfect the highest virtue, they must benefit themselves and others equally, bestowing universal kindness without distinction of noble or base, poor or rich, male or female, beauty or ugliness. With impartial benevolence and no favoritism, they perfect the wondrous conduct of the ten thousand virtues. Hence it is said, "Let your conduct be level."

"Sharp" means keen; "affairs" means function. Among all students of the Dao in the world, if through the scripture they awaken to the inconceivable Dao of True Emptiness and Wondrous Being, taking it as the essence of the true mind and the highest virtue and wondrous conduct as the function of the true mind, then in benefiting themselves and others, they will be keen in all affairs. Hence it is said, "Let your affairs be sharp."

This chapter elucidates the intent of the entire scripture as understood by Master Yin. Here ends the ninth scroll of the *Commentary on the Wenshi Zhenjing*.

#1 Based on the preceding scripture, this phrase should read: "Small insects poison the body."
#2 According to the preceding scripture, "不夫" should be "不失."
#3 "也不能" appears as "地不能" in both the *Guanyinzi* and the *Wushang Miaodao Wenshi Zhenjing*.
#4 "为医" appears as "为翳" in the *Guanyinzi*.

**Postface to the *Wenshi Zhenjing***
Composed by Ge Xianweng of the Jin

Though my form be as humble as mugwort or wormwood, I have by chance come to cherish the longevity of towering pines. Those who know the Dao, though lowly, must be embraced; though barbarian, must be esteemed.

Later, I encountered Master Zheng Siyuan. Master Zheng possessed many books of jade tablets and jasper bamboo slips. Through elixirs and herbs, he opened for me the finest medicines of the supreme Dao; through breath and absorption, he cleansed me with the purest flavors of Purple Clarity. Later, he entrusted me with the nine scrolls of the Perfected Yin’s *Wenshi Jing*. I cherished them, recited them, treasured them, and revered them.

The *Yu* is the Dao; the *Zhu* establishes heaven and earth; the *Ji* honors the Dark Man; the *Fu* is the spirit, soul, ethereal and corporeal souls; the *Jian* is the heart; the *Bi* is food; the *Fu* is transformation; the *Chou* is things; the *Yao* is compounded remedies.

With each savoring, I grew as light as treading upon a drifting leaf, roaming the undifferentiated vastness of heaven and earth; as boundless as striding a staff across the horizon, afloat upon the fathomless expanse of the great sea. Lofty as dwelling in halls of gold, jade, and precious stones; solemn as wielding the seal of ghosts, demons, and treacherous spirits. Swift as soaring phoenixes and cranes; fierce as battling tigers and rhinoceroses. Pure as bathing in azure waters; somber as dreaming of crimson hues. Seizing and releasing the great Dao, merging with the primal principle—such depths are beyond the reach of alchemists, unspoken by earlier scholars. It may be looked up to but not scaled; admired but not grasped; mirrored but not pondered; aligned with but not expressed. Is this not the discourse of those who forget things and forsake the world? The words of those who sever ties and abandon cunning? The speech of those who harmonize with yin and yang, obscuring self and other?

How exalted! How vast! And yet—how simple and effortless!

I received this teaching firsthand.

In the second year of the Xianhe era, on the first day of the fifth lunar month, Ge Hong of Danyang, styled Zhichuan, sets forth this preface.
