**Prologue to *Zàngshì Zuǎnwēi* (Hidden Treasures of the Dao/Way: The Chapter on the Revered and Subtle)**

The sage Laozi bore the surname Li, given name Er, and was called Cōng (or Bóyáng in some accounts). According to Daoist scriptures and writings, he transcended the void before the heavens and earth took form, mastered the marvelous transformations of nature, and dwelled perpetually in the celestial realm, serving as the imperial teacher in succession. These are matters beyond the scope of the six directions, so they are omitted here.

Those who stray from his teachings say this of him: Laozi’s mother, moved by the radiance of a great meteor, conceived. When her time came, she was destined to be of the Li lineage, and gave birth to him in the royal house of Shang. In the seventeenth year of Shang’s eighteenth king, King Yangjia (regnal year *Gēngshēn*), she wandered beneath a Li tree and bore Laozi. He was born with a white head, and thus could speak immediately, pointing to the Li tree and saying: “This is my surname.”

Others say: His father bore the surname Li, given name Wúguǒ. His mother was of the Yin clan, named Yìshòu. In the ninth year of Shang’s twenty-second king, King Wuding (regnal year *Gēngchén*), on the fifteenth day of the second month at the hour of the Hare (*Mǎoshí*), Laozi was born.

Some accounts describe his physique as follows: eight feet eight inches in height, with a yellow complexion, fine eyebrows, broad forehead, long ears, large eyes, sparse teeth, square mouth, thick lips, and three five lines on his brow that revealed the Dao’s principles. His forehead bore the mark of *rìjiǎo* (sun’s horn), his eyes the *yuèyuān* (moon’s abyss), his nose had twin bones, his ears three openings, his feet pressed upon the *èrwǔ* (two noon) points, and his hands grasped the *shíwén* (ten characters). These peculiarities signified that his *qi* was supremely refined and his form uniquely attuned.

He was born in the village of Lèxiāng, County Kǔ, State Chu, on the banks of the Yáo River. By the twenty-first year of King Zhòu’s reign (regnal year *Dīngmǎo*), he resided on the southern slopes of Qíshān.

The Western King (Wūwáng) heard of him and decreed that he be appointed as the *Shǒucángshǐ* (Keeper of the Hidden Treasures). When King Wū conquered Shang, Laozi was transferred to the position of *Zhùxiàshǐ* (Pillar-Hall Historian). Through the reigns of King Chéng and King Kāng, he remained in seclusion, holding his lowly rank in silence.

After a long time in the Zhou court, he saw its decline and resigned his post. In the twenty-fifth year of King Zhāo’s reign (regnal year *Guǐchǒu*), on the twenty-ninth day of the fifth month at the hour of the Horse (*Rénwǔ*), he ascended a green ox, rode a thin-wheeled carriage, with Xu Jiā as his charioteer, and departed from Zhou.

The official of the Pass, Yin Xi, was a Zhou noble, surnamed Yin, given name Xi, and styled *Yánggōng*. He wrote nine chapters on the Dao and virtue. Some say this is the *Xīshēng Jīng* (Scripture of the Western Ascension).

The passages cited by Zhuangzi and Liezi also speak of him: “He mastered the inner arts of celestial lodges (*xīngsù*), refined the essence of the cosmos, concealed his virtue, and practiced benevolence, while the world knew him not.”

Yin Xi was tall and handsome, with a profound appreciation for ancient texts and a mastery of celestial omens and esoteric writings. He observed the heavens and contemplated the earth with unerring insight, penetrating even the subtlest changes, so much so that not even the transformations of spirits and gods could escape him.

His nature was vast and generous, yet he did not conform to worldly customs. He was kind and frugal, loving all widely, and often diminished himself to aid others. In court, he was a guest of the Eastern Palace; outside, he served as the official of the Hángǔ Pass.

Each time he gazed upon the sky, he yearned for transcendence. Before Laozi arrived at the Pass, Yin Xi climbed the tower and looked in all four directions. He saw a purple cloud rising in the east and drifting westward, and knew that a true sage was about to pass through the capital. He then issued strict orders: his attendants swept the path, burned incense, and awaited the divine omen.

On the twelfth day of the seventh month (regnal year *Jiǎzǐ*), Laozi arrived at the Pass. Yin Xi, with hands clasped in reverence, invited him to his residence. He then assisted Laozi in washing, grooming, and purifying himself with ritual ablutions. Yin Xi fasted and questioned Laozi until the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, when Laozi, feigning illness, resigned his post and imparted the two chapters on the *Dao* and *Virtue* (*Dé*).

Yin Xi bowed his head and begged to follow Laozi westward to the deserts of Liúshā. Laozi replied: “You have not yet attained the Dao. How could you follow me to distant lands?”

The deserts of Liúshā were a foreign realm, where crude customs were difficult to refine. Yet how could the *Héwèi* (Guardian of the Pass) resist such temptations? Only if one nurtures the Dao within, preserving the divine light in one’s essence, can one purify the body, still the mind, and guard the One. After a thousand days of fasting and refining one’s form to its utmost subtlety, then one may seek me in the market of Qīngyáng, Shù District. But even then, how could you?

Yin Xi bowed repeatedly and withdrew. Laozi suddenly ascended into the sky, rising slowly toward the *Tàiwēi* (Great Subtlety) constellation.

Yin Xi waited until the light faded and the air grew still, then returned to his tower, fasting in seclusion. He barred all servants and attendants, recited the scriptures for three years, and meditated with concentrated thought for a thousand days. His mind became still, his body released, and his bones and flesh dissolved. He then exhausted the mysteries of celestial transformations and the subtleties of form-shifting, mastering them all.

Thus, he left his home, transcending the world with lofty strides, and finally reached the market of Qīngyáng. There, he met Laozi. Laozi then commissioned Yin Xi as *Wénshǐ Xiānshēng* (Master of the Primordial Text), and they journeyed together to the deserts of Liúshā.

Some say that during King Zhāo’s reign, Laozi departed the Pass, transforming and guiding the Western barbarians. By the time of King Yōu, he had returned to the central lands.

Thus, when Confucius visited Zhou, he revered Laozi and inquired about ritual propriety. Laozi said: “The man you speak of—his flesh and bones have long since decayed. Only his words remain.”

Moreover, the worthy attains his moment and rides the winds, or if not, he travels with humility like the commoner. I have heard this: a skilled merchant hides his wares as if they were nonexistent, while a man of virtue conceals his power, appearing as if foolish. Abandon your arrogance and greed, your vain demeanor and licentious desires—these bring no benefit to your life. This is why I have told you as I have.

Confucius departed and said to his disciples: “I know how the crow flies and the fish swims. I know how the beast runs. The running one can be ensnared with a net, the swimming one with a hook, and the flying one with a snare.

But the dragon—how it rides the wind and clouds to ascend to the heavens—this I cannot know. Today, I have seen Laozi; he is like the dragon.”

At that time, the world was in darkness, and the Way of the Kings waned, so he emerged from the pass again. Some say he lived over two hundred years, for he cultivated the Dao and nourished his lifespan.

Laozi received learning from Rongcheng, and inquired about the Dao from Changdao—both were ancient recluse sages.

Laozi’s son was named Zong. Zong served the state of Wei as a general and was ennobled at Duangan. Zong’s son was Zhu, Zhu’s son was Gong, and Gong’s distant descendant was Jia. Jia served under Emperor Wen of Han. Jia’s son, Jie, became the Grand Tutor to the King of Jiaoxi and settled his family in Qi.

When Heaven and Earth exist, then Dao techniques exist. Those who uphold the Dao—when have they ever been lacking? From Fu Xi onward, through the Three Dynasties, eminent Daoist sages have appeared in every generation.

Speaking of Laozi, he was originally a spiritually gifted man, indeed one who attained the Dao with extraordinary precision. In his time, the common folk saw his longevity and his white hair from birth, so they called him Laozi. *Lao* is an honorific for "old," and *zi* is a general honorific for "master."

Some people, upon receiving their fate, possess innate spiritual insight and extraordinary perception, their qi differing from that of ordinary men. They are destined to be masters of the Dao, thus able to be aided by celestial spirits and followed by the multitude of immortals.

Therefore, the methods he transmitted to save the world—such as the Nine Elixirs and Eight Stones, the Jade Nectar and Golden Liquor, preserving the True Self and guarding the Primordial, meditating on the spirit and traversing the inner chambers, guiding the qi and refining the form, warding off disasters and evil, pacifying ghosts and nurturing the nature, fasting and transforming, silent admonition and instruction, commanding ghosts and demons—all these were the common practices Laozi employed to safeguard the world. These were not the ultimate extremes.

Later, governing the family and the world were but minor applications of the Great Dao, the remaining tasks of the Sage.

Laozi, serene and effortless, devoted himself solely to longevity, so even though he remained in Zhou for long, his rank and position did not advance. He harmonized his light and blended with the dust, inwardly possessing natural authenticity. Valuing the Dao, he embraced emptiness and responded spontaneously, transforming without action. Thus, he wrote his book as *mysterious and subtle, difficult to recognize*, and departed once the Dao was complete. This is what is meant by the *vast and true person*.

Moreover, Laozi’s descendants continued their sacrifices without ceasing, ascending to the Celestial Capital of Jade. Zhuangzi’s drumming of his wife’s funeral basin, sending her to serve the Emperor in Heaven, were all acts of those who became masters of the Dao, causing later generations to believe in the attainability of longevity—not as mere marvels, but as something that could be learned, though not fully comprehended.

This is called the *teaching beyond the square*, possessing the purity of antiquity.

Throughout the dynasties, his temples and reverence have never ceased. In Tang’s Qianfeng Year 1, Emperor Gaozong posthumously conferred the title *Playful Primordial Emperor* upon Laozi. In Guangzhu Year 1, the Empress Dowager posthumously conferred the title *Primordial Heavenly Empress* upon Yin Xi, making him the *Holy Ancestor of the Tang*.

In antiquity, Laozi composed two treatises, *Dao* and *De*. Today’s *Laozi’s Classic of the Dao and Virtue* was likely titled thus by Guan Yin after receiving the text.

The Dao is profound and difficult to speak of. There exists a formless unity—compelled to name it, we call it the Dao. Since it permeates all life, it is called *through* (通). Again, *Dao* means to tread. How much more so the Dao of the path, which makes people revere its words and follow its practice!

The Dao is the revered foundation of virtue. Where there is the Dao, there must be virtue. Virtue is *obtained*. Obtained inwardly in the heart, outwardly in things—obtained and not lost—thus things are allowed to flourish, and this is called virtue.

Where there is virtue, there must be the Dao. Virtue and the Dao rely upon each other and do not separate, hence *Dao and Virtue*.

*Jing* means *constant*, *law*. It speaks of principles that are constant and can be emulated, as with the Nine Classics. Again, *jing* is an honorific for *book*.

Now, when we say *Dao Jing* (upper) and *De Jing* (lower), the first chapter of the upper takes *Dao*—the Dao that can be spoken of, the constant Dao. The first chapter of the lower takes *upper virtue*—virtue that is not virtue, hence having virtue, and thus the title.

Later commentators, following the text, say the Dao cannot be displayed without virtue, and virtue cannot be illuminated without the Dao. The Dao is formless and without action, thus it precedes the transformation of things. Virtue is functional and active, thus it follows after birth and transformation. When the Dao declines, virtue arises; when virtue declines, the Five Constants arise. This shows that Dao and Virtue are the foundation of all conduct, the root of the Five Constants.

Thus, the *Dao Jing* comes first, the *De Jing* follows, the two volumes emulating the generation of the Two Principles, eighty-one chapters symbolizing the extreme number of the sun. Therefore, the upper *Jing* clarifies the Dao by emulating Heaven, the lower *Jing* clarifies virtue by emulating Earth.

Heaven’s number is odd, so the upper *Jing* has thirty-seven chapters. Earth’s number is even, so the lower *Jing* has forty-four chapters. All this originates from ancient sages, continuing the old tradition. This *Classic* takes the profound depths as its core, nature as its body, and Dao and virtue as its function. Its essence lies in governing the self and the state.

To govern the state: if I do nothing, the people transform themselves; if I desire nothing, the people return to simplicity. To govern the self: block the orifices and close the gates, and the spirit of the valley will not die. Reduce private desires and minimize cravings—this is its essential meaning, which can be spoken of.

But as for that which cannot be seen when viewed, cannot be heard when listened to, the unfathomable depths beyond depths, the gateway to all marvels—this is surely beyond speech or transmission.

Those who wander in its outer halls all believe they have ascended to the inner chambers and glimpsed its mysteries. Only when they refine their essence and ponder deeply do they realize, regarding the Dao, that even an autumn hair’s tip is but a fraction of what they have yet to grasp.

They depend on their teachers’ instructions and briefly compile the subtle insights of former sages. Yet, for those who have truly attained enlightenment, this is but a fleeting shadow of self-awakening.

Laozi declared that there is no second Dao in the world, no dual hearts in the Sage. His writing was to transmit the Dao; his teachings were to save the times. Since the times’ afflictions differed, his methods of expression also varied. His methods varied, so his doctrines differed, causing later scholars to see these differences and thus regard Confucius and Laozi as holding opposing teachings.

「If one grasps the Dao and does not constrain it by time, aligns with its essence and is not bound by outward forms, understands its intent without clinging to its words, then the writings of all the sages complement one another without fail, and their teachings do not diverge in the least.

Since the decline of the Three Dynasties, no sage-kings arose, and the world drowned in the excesses of textualism, lacking the means to return to their original nature and restore its simplicity. The Dao waned and virtue declined, never more so than in this age.

Laozi, born in the Zhou era, presented himself with gentle humility, while his true essence was the boundless, unspoiling emptiness that sustains all things—thus his withdrawal from the world and retreat to seclusion.

When Guan Ling (尹喜) requested him to record his teachings, he composed the *Eighty-One Chapters* (《道德经》) to elucidate the profound truths of virtue and the Dao.

His words were concise, his principles vast—rooted in depth, structured by simplicity, refined in essence, and coarse in outward expression. He sought only to restore the people to the unadorned purity of knotted cords (结绳之朴), and nothing more.

His efforts to uphold teaching and save the times were indeed most urgent and sincere.

Alas, later generations failed to perceive the complete workings of Heaven and Earth or the grand essence of the sages. Confucianists like Sima Qian even claimed that those who study Confucius reject Laozi, and those who study Laozi reject Confucius—saying the Dao does not allow for such divergent paths.

Yang Xiong declared: *"To extinguish rites and music, I have no use for them."* Han Yu said: *"Gazing from a well, one’s view of the sky is small."* Yet these three masters (三君子) are one in truth—how could they not understand the sages’ profound intent?

The Dao is like the seasons: summer thrives in growth, autumn excels in restraint. One brings flourishing abundance, the other brings withering return to origin. Together, they complete the cycle of Heaven’s function.

From Fu Xi’s first creation of laws to the reigns of Yao and Shun, and through the Three Dynasties, rites and music were fully established, resplendent and complete—this was the summer of the Dao.

In Laozi’s time, ritualistic excesses had grown too severe. If one did not curb the superficial flourishes and return to virtue and the Dao, how could the sage’s grand work ever be fulfilled?

His words state: *"When the Dao is lost, virtue appears; when righteousness is lost, rites arise."* Rites, being the thinnest veneer of loyalty and trust, are also the source of chaos. He proclaimed that nothing is more exalted than virtue and the Dao, nor more debased than rites. If rites are reversed to restore righteousness, and righteousness is then returned to virtue and the Dao, then this is indeed sufficient for governing the world.

Thus, he dismissed righteousness, rites, wisdom, and intelligence, recording only the virtue and Dao to instruct all under Heaven.

In later generations, some spoke of the *"mixed formation of things"* and *"that which precedes Heaven and Earth."*

At the beginning of the *Yijing* (《易》), all was in a state of undifferentiated chaos (浑沦), without visible form or nameable *qi*. Only when the changes of the *Yijing* manifest as one did numbers arise.

One change yields seven, seven changes yield nine, and nine is completion—then it returns again to one, tracing its origin. Such endless transformations and cycles have no end.

Thus, Laozi wrote *Eighty-One Chapters* (九九篇) to reveal the ebb and flow of yin and yang, the rise and fall of calamity and fortune, the Dao’s ceaseless motion, and the beginning and end of human affairs—all without exception.

Confucius lived in Laozi’s time and also recorded his teachings to ensure their immortality. Confucius said: *"My learning knows no end."* Laozi, however, sought to transcend learning.

Confucius said: *"Must one be a sage?"* Laozi, however, sought to transcend sainthood.

Confucius prized righteousness and rites, while Laozi abandoned them. Confucius promoted worthy talent, but Laozi did not exalt the virtuous.

Confucius said: *"The wise are not confused."* Laozi declared: *"To govern with wisdom is to harm the state."* His words were largely opposed, yet was this deliberate contradiction?

Laozi’s true aim was to reveal the fundamental nature of the Dao to rectify the times’ excesses, while Confucius established the conventional paths of the Dao to adapt to worldly changes. Their approaches could not help but differ.

To transcend learning is to allow one’s nature and destiny to unfold naturally, achieving the marvel of *"sitting in forgetfulness"* (坐忘) and daily refinement.

To transcend sainthood is to let people rest in their natural state, without the ambition to dazzle or confuse the wise and simple alike.

To abandon righteousness and rites is to eliminate the distinctions of favoritism and partiality, ensuring that the world does not cling to *"only love one’s own parents and children"* (不独亲其亲，子其子), but instead unifies in filial piety and benevolence (同归於孝慈).

To not exalt the virtuous is to end the disputes of Confucians and Mohists, so that the world has no hearts of mutual rivalry or ambition (无夸跂相轧之心).

*"To govern with wisdom is to harm the state"*—the more deceitful and false the words, the more constrained the wisdom becomes. Who could compare this to governance that is *"dim and quiet"* (闷闷), allowing the people to remain *"pure and simple"* (淳淳)?

The reason their teachings differ is not to create opposition, but rather because of Laozi’s and Zhuangzi’s writings—where nineteen out of twenty are allegorical (寓言), and their profound truths are often conveyed through dialogues between Confucius and Laozi, or accounts of Confucius inquiring about rites. Does this make their Dao divergent?

Why then do we have phrases like *"stealing comparisons from Laozi and Peng Zu"* (窃比老彭) or *"like a dragon"* (犹龙)? It must be that their names differ, yet their essence is the same.

Later generations, bound by rigid doctrines, saw the sages as increasingly distant in outward form.

Laozi said: *"My words are very easy to know, very easy to practice. Yet the world cannot know them, cannot practice them."*

A thousand generations later, if one sage arises, they will apply what they know and practice, achieving a reign of *"pure clarity"* (清静之治). They will also expound upon his words, creating a vast and profound text.

If the four seas return to simplicity, and the virtue and Dao are not forgotten, how fortunate would that be! How fortunate would that be!

**Bo Ge of Wen Kang (文康公葛邲) in succession to Zhong (仲)** recorded this. **Bi Xuzi Chen Jun (碧虚子陈君)** received instruction from **Zhang Wumen (张无梦)**, the **Hong Mengzi (鸿蒙子)** of Tian Tai Mountain (天台山), attaining Laozi’s essence. He printed the *藏室纂微篇* (*Collected Essentials from the Hidden Chamber*), gathering the refined insights of all commentaries while integrating his master’s secret transmissions. Its meaning encompasses both Dao and things, elucidates the principles of purity and simplicity, and magnifies the divine transformations of the sages.

During the **Xining era (熙宁)**, he was summoned to the imperial audience hall and presented his work. The emperor’s favor was exceptional, and it was decreed to be included in the *Daozang* (《道藏》). It was enshrined in famous mountains across the land, and scholars of the four seas took it as their model and standard.»

The **Master Yang Zhonggeng (仲庚)**, having sought the Dao in the western lands of Shu at the end of the Five Dynasties period and later studied this scripture in the southeastern regions, devoted himself to its teachings from youth to old age. Though he fathomed the profound depths of the *Yin-Yang* mysteries, he still gazed across the boundless sea of meaning with humble awe—grateful to glimpse the essentials of the *Collected Essentials from the Hidden Chamber*, as though parting the clouds to behold the sun and moon.

Yet, lamenting that the world lacked a flawless edition and its circulation remained limited, he reverently collated and meticulously corrected the text from the *Daozang*. He solicited benevolent patrons, commissioned artisans to engrave and print it, ensuring its enduring transmission.

In gratitude, he first honors the **Dao Ancestor of the Primordial Void (玄元道祖)** for establishing the teachings, then repays the nurturing guidance of his father and master. He prays that all kindred spirits may delve deeply, pondering the text to align with the Dao, all attaining the realization of *wuwei* (non-action), thereby perpetuating the true Daoist spirit, safeguarding the nation’s prosperity, and—though but a humble hermit—offering a token of filial gratitude.

On the **First Day of the First Month, the Year of the Horse (戊午)**, in the **Bao’you era (宝佑)** of the Great Song, **Yang Zhonggeng (杨仲庚)**, the overseer and abbot of **Lingshan Lingying Observatory (灵应观)**, respectfully prostrates and inscribes this preface.
