**Preface to the *Wenshi Zhenjing Yanzhi* (The Esoteric Purport Beyond the Words of the *Wenshi Zhenjing*)**

I have heard that the Three Teachings stand like tripods in the world, as the three celestial luminaries in the heavens—each relying on the others to shine, none dispensable. The scriptures of the three traditions fill storehouses and overflow libraries, yet each possesses works of utmost subtlety and profundity. For us Confucians, the Six Classics are all canonical, but the most refined is the *Book of Changes*; for the Buddhists, the Great Treasury spans thousands of scrolls, but the most refined is the *Lankavatara Sutra*; for the Daoists, the Great Treasury also numbers in the thousands, but the most refined is the *Book of Master Guan*.

These three works within their respective traditions are like the three luminaries within the three realms. Yet though the luminaries shine, without eyes, one cannot perceive their light; though the three books are wondrous, without wisdom, one cannot fathom their wonder. Thus, though they endure, their purport has long been obscured. As the *Tradition* says: *"If the person is not right, the Dao does not manifest in vain."* How true!

Alas! After the Three Sages of Confucianism, the *Book of Changes* devolved into a text of divination and numerology. After the transmission of the Four Lamps in Buddhism, the *Lankavatara* became mere doctrinal literature. From the Qin and Han dynasties onward, the *Book of Master Guan* fell into the hands of the magicians of Huainan. Moreover, the Dao conceals itself in minor accomplishments, and words obscure themselves in superficial falsity. Sages do not appear in every age, nor do their profound teachings circulate perpetually. Thus, it is fitting that the *Book of Master Guan* has been hidden and not transmitted to the world.

Yet the most numinous qi of heaven and earth manifests as culture, and words that bear the Dao are secretly guarded by spirits—they cannot be obliterated, only await their time to circulate. After Confucius, thousands of years passed before Chen Tuan transmitted the heart-method of the *Book of Changes*. After the Buddha’s nirvana, thousands of years passed before Bodhidharma brought the *Lankavatara* to China. Now, since Laozi departed westward through the pass, thousands of years have elapsed, and Master Baoyi has at last illuminated the profound mysteries of the *Book of Master Guan*. Yet even the punctuation of this book is difficult—how much more so its meaning!

Having realized the truth of the Dao, the Master, moved by compassion for later learners, delved into the marrow of Laozi and Guan Yin, and expounded the esoteric purport beyond the words of the scripture. Sometimes he elucidates the purport through the words, sometimes clarifies the scripture by rephrasing, sometimes illustrates the mystery through analogy, sometimes reveals the profundity through paradox. At times, hidden meanings lie beneath the sentences; at others, the mechanism leaks beyond the words. Sometimes he points to the meaning before the words, or discloses the subtle beyond the intent. In most cases, these are the purports *beyond* the words of the *Book of Master Guan*, hence the title *Yanzhi* (Esoteric Purport Beyond the Words).

This book truly unlocks the secret treasury of the great transformation, augments the radiance of the sun and moon, reveals the unexposed mechanism of the *Book of Changes*, and expounds the hidden depths of the *Lankavatara*. It embodies the original heart of Fuxi, exhausts the divine thought of King Wen, probes the subtleties of Confucius, and investigates the lifeblood of all buddhas. It delves into the marrow of all patriarchs, discloses the hidden mechanisms of the Yellow Emperor, and lays bare the innermost depths of Lao Dan. For scholars to encounter this book is a once-in-an-age opportunity—how could they not recognize their fortune?

I, humble and dull, received direct transmission from my teacher and awakened to the truth of the Dao. Unable to repay his boundless kindness, I respectfully commit this to the printing blocks, to transmit it endlessly, that later generations of gentlemen devoted to the Dao may encounter this book, awaken in an instant, and realize the truth of the Dao—all through the infinite virtue of my teacher, Master Baoyi.

Wherever this book resides, it surpasses even the sutras of the Buddha’s vehicle, secretly protected by the spirits of heaven. How could one treat it with disrespect? Scholars should reverently recite it with devotion, as Ge Hong once did.

Thus, I inscribe this preface.

Respectfully composed on the Winter Solstice of the second year of Baoyou (1254) by the disciple Xiweizi Wang Yi, who bows in offering before the incense burner.

**Memorial of Liu Xiang on Presenting the *Book of Master Guan***

The newly collated *Book of Master Guan* comprises nine chapters. Your servant, Liu Xiang, Left Director of Waterways and Grand Master of Splendid Happiness, respectfully reports: Having examined the *Book of Master Guan* in the palace archives, I found that the version stored in the Grand Temple preserves seven chapters, while my own copy contains nine. I have removed errors and irrecoverable passages, filled lacunae, and restored continuity, resulting in nine complete chapters, all transcribed onto bamboo slips, ready for copying.

Master Guan Yin, also known as Guan Lingzi or Guan Lingzi the Recluse, was a man of virtue, esteemed by all. He often entreated Laozi to compose the *Book of Dao and Virtue* in two scrolls. Lie Yukou and Zhuang Zhou both cited it among the Daoist texts. Each chapter is titled, and every chapter begins with the words *"Master Guan Yin says."* The sequence of chapters varies, and their meanings differ, yet their purport aligns with Laozi, Zhuangzi, and Liezi, though their diction diverges. The style is unadorned yet vast, turbulent yet boundless, yet it possesses form and rule, instilling in the reader a sense of cool clarity, never inciting recklessness.

Originally, the Master transmitted the text to Chancellor Cao Can. After Chancellor Cao’s passing, the book was buried with him. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, a fangshi presented seven chapters, which the Emperor set aside in weariness. Prince Liu An of Huainan, fond of the Dao and a collector of books, possessed this text but did not release it. My father, Liu De, obtained it while handling the Prince’s affairs. As a youth, I cherished it. The reclusive scholars and pure gentlemen who esteem the Yellow Emperor and Laozi’s teaching of clarity and stillness cannot do without it. Thus, I, your servant, risk death to present it.

Respectfully submitted on the gengzi day of the eighth month of the second year of Yongshi (16 BCE) by your servant, Left Director of Waterways and Grand Master of Splendid Happiness, Liu Xiang, who has collated the *Book of Master Guan* and now humbly presents it.

**Preface to the Esoteric Meaning Beyond Words of the *Wen Shi Zhen Jing***

The Dao fundamentally has no name. *Laozi* says: "There is a thing, formlessly formed, born before heaven and earth." I know not its name, so I forcefully call it the Dao. Yet if it is said to have no name, and its name is unknown, then it cannot be spoken of in words. Thus, the sage, in relation to the Dao, ought to establish neither speech nor writing. However, the sage, wishing to enlighten later generations, if he did not forcibly establish its name to describe its reality, then what is called the Dao would be cut off from learning and left without transmission.

Guanling Yin observed the clouds and qi to await Laozi’s departure through the pass. He entreated and detained him, becoming his disciple and requesting that he establish words to benefit later generations. Thus, the sage’s compassionate concern for later learners was utmost. After obtaining Laozi’s Dao and transmitting the five thousand words, he then composed this book to enlighten later generations, revealing the meaning that the five thousand words had not yet expressed.

Yet this is the Dao that cannot be named in words, and this book is the speech of what cannot be spoken. How could its words be glimpsed by the hundred schools? No wonder Zhuangzi, hearing of its influence, rejoiced in it, claiming his own learning derived from Guan Yin and calling him "the ancient, vast, and true person." Liezi also studied under him to transmit his Dao.

Alas! The perfected do not often appear, and their words are not often heard. Yet Guan Yin’s book, since ancient times, has been secretly transmitted in the world, with few who know it. Though in this sagely and enlightened age, the works of Zhuangzi and Liezi are named as classics, this book has not been transmitted and has not reached the court. If Zhuangzi and Liezi were aware, would they not feel shame in the underworld?

Zhuangzi did not say: "Not departing from the origin is called the celestial person; not departing from the essence is called the spirit person; not departing from the real is called the perfected person. Taking heaven as the origin, virtue as the root, and the Dao as the gate, presaging transformation, is called the sage." Now, observing this book, we know that Master Guan Yin fully embodied the Dao of these four. No wonder he was called the vast and true person.

Since the separation of clear and turbid began, there has been no writing that, in establishing words and bequeathing teachings, reveals the divine virtue, the utmost subtlety, the utmost mystery, and the utmost wonder as this book does. Ge Zhichuan said: "It grasps and releases the great Dao, the primordial and perfect principle—something earlier Confucians never spoke of and fangshi could not attain." Precisely because of its loftiness, the shallow and near cannot glimpse it; because of its vastness, the narrow and ignorant cannot approach it; because of its simplicity, the encyclopedic cannot fathom it. Scholars gaze upon it but cannot reach it, study it but cannot grasp it, comprehend it but cannot express it, chew it but find no flavor, grope for it but find no door, seek it but find no path. Some even dismiss it as a forgery, claiming it emerged from the mouths of Han Confucians.

Alas! This book’s profundities could not be spoken by Zhuangzi or Liezi, nor could Wen or Cheng articulate them—how could Han Confucians have composed it? Since the time of Emperor Ming of Han, when the teachings of the Western Regions first spread into China, the most subtle and wondrous of its scriptures—*Śūraṅgama*, *Laṅkāvatāra*, *Vajracchedikā*, and *Lotus Sutra*—all their discussions of divine transformations, marvelous meanings, and the doctrines of no-self and no-person were already expounded in this book. Yet its words are concise while its meaning is vast, incomparable even to the multiply translated Buddhist texts.

Master Guan Yin lived in the late Zhou, contemporaneous with Confucius. Both sages personally met Laozi, so some of their words and questions coincide, such as "If one hears the Dao in the morning, one may die in the evening." Could what they heard and saw have been the same? Now, observing the opening chapter of this book, it seems to elucidate the meaning of the five thousand words, serving as a commentary on the *Daodejing*. Scholars should study it alongside the *Daodejing*, and perhaps then their minds will be released and their spirits awakened by this book.

Yet if, after being moved and enlightened by this book, one then follows the vulgar, one-sided scholars of the world, lightly slandering and disrespecting it, mocking the sage’s words, then such a person, having originally awakened to this book’s meaning through the numinous spirit of the mind, will surely revert to the mind’s dullness and lack of spirit, obscuring their innate nature and losing their awakening. The numinosity of this book is such that those who read it in this way—should they not instead love it, recite it, play with it, and bow to it as Ge Zhichuan did?

Now, wishing to forcibly name and characterize it under a forced name, I have composed this preface on the esoteric meaning beyond words.

Respectfully submitted on the Double Ninth Festival of the second year of Baoyou in the Song dynasty (1254), by Chen Xianwei, the Embracer of the One, who bows before the stove incense.

The Embracer of the One says: "Yu" encompasses all directions, above and below, so I place "One Yu" at the beginning of the chapters. Without this "yu," there would be no place for the body to dwell or life to be established. The Dao pervades all directions, above and below—without this Dao, the creation and transformation of heaven and earth would nearly cease. Thus, "One Yu" is the Dao.

Once "yu" is established, it cannot lack pillars, so I place "Two Pillars" next. Pillars are what erect heaven and earth; when heaven and earth are fixed in position, the sage dwells at the center. The sage is the embodiment of the Dao. The sage establishes the center and sets the ultimate standard, so I place "Three Ultimates" next.

Once the Three Powers are established, the Four Images take their places, so I place "Four Talismans" next. Talismans are objects that contract with the spirit, thus representing essence, spirit, soul, and魄.

Five resides at the center of numbers, and the heart resides at the center of the person, so I place "Five Mirrors" at the center to illuminate the true heart’s capacity to reflect. Yet without form, the heart has no dwelling, so I place "Six Spoons" next. Spoons are for eating; eating nourishes form. Thus, form and nourishment are one. When form endures, it transforms, so I place "Seven Cauldrons" next.

Cauldron is the vessel that transforms the myriad things. A cauldron cannot be empty, so I place "Eight Tallies" next. Tallies are things; every thing can become medicine, and medicine can be compounded for healing, so I conclude with "Nine Medicines." Nine signifies thoroughness and completion; when things become medicine, their efficacy reaches its utmost. Yet the efficacy of medicine can revive people, revealing the principle of rebirth—showing that all things possess this qi and this nature, capable of generating life, not perishing with form. Thus, I conclude with medicine.

Now, I divide these nine chapters into three scrolls to illustrate the meaning of "from one comes three, from three comes nine." When nine is reached, it transforms back into one, cycling endlessly.

The original three scrolls—upper, middle, and lower—are now separated into nine scrolls.

*Wenshi Zhenjing Yanwai Zhi*, Scroll One
By Baoyizi Chen Xianwei

**One-Character Chapter**
"Yu" is the Dao. In all, twenty-eight sections.

Guan Yinzi said: Without the Dao, one cannot speak; what cannot be spoken is the Dao. Without the Dao, one cannot think; what cannot be thought is the Dao.

Heavenly things rage and flow; human affairs are tangled and chaotic—some swirl like eddies, some clash like grinding teeth, some rush by, seeming yet not so. People contend, isolate, display, rebuke, depart, or cling. In ancient times, to act upon it was like blowing at shadows; to ponder it was like carving dust. Even sages and wise men become lost; ghosts and spirits cannot fathom it. It is unmakeable, unattainable, unfathomable, indivisible—thus called Heaven, called Mandate, called Spirit, called Mystery. Together, they are called the Dao.

Baoyizi said: *Laozi* states, "The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao; the name that can be named is not the eternal name." Scholars today rarely see the writings of Guan Yinzi and often interpret *Laozi* through the words of the Hundred Schools or their own conjectures, failing to clarify Laozi’s intent.

Guan Yinzi said: If there were a Dao that could not be spoken, then the Dao and speech would be two. Only when what cannot be spoken *is* the Dao are speech and the Dao one. Scholars who hastily read "without the Dao, one cannot speak" often mistakenly believe there is a Dao that *can* be spoken. If there were a Dao that could be spoken, it should say "there is a Dao that is not unspeakable," not "without the Dao, one cannot speak." Today, saying "without the Dao, one cannot speak; what cannot be spoken is the Dao" is to invert Laozi’s words to reveal their implicit meaning.

If we invert this statement, it becomes: "Without the Dao, one cannot *express*; what cannot be expressed is the Dao." Having inverted it to "what cannot be expressed is the Dao," we then invert "the Dao that can be expressed is not the Dao"—which is precisely Laozi’s "the Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao." Some may still doubt that "can be spoken" refers to the Dao of rivers and paths. To clarify, I invert the scriptural words: "If emptiness can be empty, it is not true emptiness. If it could be empty, there would be something obstructing and not empty—how could that be called true emptiness? Knowing that emptiness that can be empty is not true emptiness, one then knows that the Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao."

Some use this analogy: Just as the mind can be minded and nature can be cultivated through effort, the Dao alone cannot be forced—thus, it cannot be expressed as Dao. Without inverting the words beyond words, I could never have clarified the profound meaning of *Laozi*’s classic.

People are often misled by the word "eternal," assuming *Laozi* speaks of an extraordinary Dao. Yet Laozi uses "eternal" precisely to dispel the notion that his Dao differs from others’. In truth, this is the universal Dao of all under heaven. Even calling it "Dao" is but a provisional name—the universal name of all under heaven.

This Dao pervades heaven and earth, spans past and present, and is present everywhere. Yet the moment one opens one’s mouth to speak, one strays far from it. Thus, it is said to be two. The moment one points to this provisional name as a "name that can be named," it is no longer the name. Only because it cannot be named do we borrow the term "eternal name" as a provisional designation—just as we say, "Without a name, one cannot name; what cannot be named is the name." This is the meaning of "what cannot be spoken is the Dao; what cannot be named is the name"—corresponding to Laozi’s "the Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao; the name that can be named is not the eternal name."

Yet Laozi was a great sage, and his words were like the speechless speech of heaven. Without another great sage like Guan Yinzi, who could employ speechless speech to elucidate the implicit meaning beyond his words?

Guan Yinzi, having revealed the principle of the unnameable and unspeakable, feared that people might think the Dao could be grasped through thought. Thus, he added, "Without the Dao, one cannot think; what cannot be thought is the Dao"—echoing the earlier idea.

Alas! What can be spoken and thought belongs to humanity; what cannot be spoken or thought belongs to Heaven. Can humanity and Heaven truly be viewed as distinct? If one says all people can be called Heaven, can humanity and Heaven truly be viewed as one? Heavenly things rage and flow; human affairs are tangled and chaotic. Some resemble eddies, some clash like grinding teeth, some rush by, seeming yet not so. People contend, isolate, display, rebuke, depart, or cling. With such disorder in heavenly things and human affairs, how can they be viewed as one? To attempt to grasp them with human speech and thought is like blowing at shadows or carving dust—only exhausting the mind.

This Dao—even sages and wise men are led astray by it; ghosts and spirits cannot fathom it. Because it cannot be made, it is called Heaven; because it cannot be attained, it is called Mandate; because it cannot be measured, it is called Spirit; because it cannot be divided, it is called Mystery. Combining these four, we provisionally call it the Dao.

Master Guan Yinzi said: There is no single thing that is not Heaven, no single thing that is not Mandate, no single thing that is not Spirit, no single thing that is not Mystery. Since things are thus, how could humans be otherwise? Every person may be called Heaven, every person may be called Spirit, every person may attain Mandate and penetrate Mystery. One cannot say "that is Heaven, this is not Heaven," "that is Spirit, this is not Spirit," "that is Mandate, this is not Mandate," "that is Mystery, this is not Mystery." Therefore, those who master my Way perceive within a single thing the fullness of Heaven, the exhaustion of Spirit, the attainment of Mandate, and the creation of Mystery.

To pursue learning by chasing differences is to split names while the reality remains the same; to attain it is to unite in sameness while forgetting the names of differences.

Master Baoyizi said: *The Laozi* speaks of the Dao, then follows with "constantly desireless to observe its mystery, constantly desiring to observe its manifestations"—both are called Mystery, Mystery upon Mystery, the gateway of the manifold wonders. Master Guan Yinzi, fearing that learners would chase differences and split names while the reality remains the same, and thus view Heaven, Mandate, Spirit, and Mystery as four separate things, reiterates here: within a single thing, one can know Heaven and exhaust Spirit, govern Mandate and create Mystery. Every thing is thus, every person inherently possesses this—one cannot say "that is Heaven, this is not Heaven," "that is Spirit, this is not Spirit," "that is Mandate, this is not Mandate," "that is Mystery, this is not Mystery." Whether one calls it wonder, subtlety, or Mystery, every thing is thus, every person inherently possesses it. Only those who attain it unite with the shared reality and forget the names of differences. As for "Mystery upon Mystery," one may thereby enter the Dao.

Master Guan Yinzi said: To observe the Dao is like observing water. If gazing at a pond is insufficient, one goes to the river, to the Yangtze, to the sea, saying, "This is the ultimate water." Yet they do not know that my saliva, tears, and spittle are all water.

Master Baoyizi said: To observe the Dao as if observing water is to make oneself and water two. The greater the observation, the farther the divergence. Turning the light inward, one finds that one’s own body contains ponds, rivers, Yangtze, and seas. Now, are not saliva, tears, and spittle the manifestations of the ponds, rivers, Yangtze, and seas within one’s body? The ignorant simply do not realize this.

Master Guan Yinzi said: The Dao has no "person"—the sage does not see "this person follows the Dao, that person does not." The Dao has no "self"—the sage does not see "I advance in the Dao, I retreat from the Dao." Because one does not possess the Dao, the Dao is not absent; because one does not grasp the Dao, the Dao is not lost.

Master Baoyizi said: If there is a "person," then I and the person become two; if there is an "I," then I and the Dao become two. If the "I" cannot be possessed, how can the Dao be possessed? If the "I" cannot be grasped, how can the Dao be grasped? Only by not possessing the "I" can one not be without the "I"; only by not grasping the "I" can one not lose the "I." Not possessing yet not lacking, not grasping yet not losing—how could this be like the arising and ceasing, gaining and losing of ordinary things? Those who cling to possession and attainment are far from understanding this.

Master Guan Yinzi said: Those who do not know the Dao yet recklessly divine with their minds are like shooting at a covered vessel. The lofty say, "There is gold, there is jade"; the middling say, "There is horn, there is feather"; the base say, "There is tile, there is stone." Is this right or wrong? Only the one who placed the object knows.

Master Baoyizi said: If the one who placed the object had not placed it under the covered vessel, those shooting would labor in vain. Here, the one who places the object and the one who shoots are two people. Now, if the same person both places and covers the object yet does not know what was placed, why is this? Because desire is the vessel, and the obscuring mind is the cover. Even with great wisdom and power, one cannot shoot at this covered vessel. How could one realize what was placed? For at the moment of placing, one has already forgotten. One doubts and assumes another placed it, and so one shoots and divines for a lifetime without success. One day, when the vessel of desire is lifted and the cover of the obscuring mind is shattered, one sees what was placed and suddenly realizes that the placer was no other than oneself. The former notions of "gold or jade," "horn or feather," "tile or stone" were all delusions. Alas! What, after all, lies beneath the covered vessel? Scholars, do not remain ignorant as if nothing were ever placed there.

Master Guan Yinzi said: A single potter can make ten thousand vessels, yet in the end, no single vessel can make the potter or harm the potter. A single Dao can make ten thousand things, yet in the end, no single thing can make the Dao or harm the Dao.

Master Baoyizi said: Call it a vessel—how could it make the potter? How could it harm the potter? Call it a thing—how could it make the Dao? How could it harm the Dao? Yet if a vessel does not make the potter, one cannot say it is not the potter; if a thing does not make the Dao, one cannot say it is not the Dao. Moreover, vessels cannot harm the potter, yet what harms the potter is also vessels; things cannot harm the Dao, yet what harms the Dao is also things. When vessels exist, the potter exists; when things exist, the Dao exists. Remove these vessels—where is the potter? Eliminate these things—where is the Dao? Can one truly remove these vessels? Vessels form endlessly. Can one truly eliminate these things? Things arise without end. Only by not being confined to vessels is one a good potter; only by not being confined to things is one a master of the Dao. The good potter is the potter of potters; the master of the Dao is the Dao of the Dao. The potter of potters does not know pottering; the Dao of the Dao does not know the Dao. Not knowing pottering, no vessel can be made; not knowing the Dao, no thing can be completed. Vessels, things—pottering, the Dao.

Master Guan Yinzi said: Is the Dao vast and without knowledge? Is the heart free and without constraint? Are things ceaseless and without exception? Swift as lightning, flying as sand—the sage knows that heart is one, things are one, the Dao is one, and these three are again united as one.

Do not insist on uniformity nor let non-uniformity harm unity.

Master Baoyi said: When you see things, you see the heart; without things, the heart does not appear. When you see the heart, you see the Dao; without the heart, the Dao does not appear. Someone asked: The earlier masters said that having no heart *is* the Dao—is this teaching incorrect? Another said: Having no heart is still one barrier away—is this teaching trustworthy? He asked: When you see things and thus see the heart, do you comprehend? The disciple replied: I do. He said: When there are no things and the heart does not appear, where then is the heart? The questioner was stunned and at a loss.

Another day, he asked again: Can the heart be seen? The master said: The heart cannot be seen—what *can* be seen? He asked: Can the Dao be seen? The master said: Do you think the Dao and the heart are one or two? The disciple said: The heart and the Dao may be one, but can things also be one with the Dao and the heart? The master said: Do you wish to let what is not one harm the One? The questioner assented and withdrew.

Master Guan Yinzi said: If you use a basin as a pond and a stone as an island, fish will swim around them, unaware that they have circled thousands of miles without end. Why is this? Because water has no source and no return. The Dao of the sage has no beginning and no end, thus it responds to things without exhaustion.

Master Baoyi said: What has a beginning and an end responds to things and soon exhausts itself; what has no root and no end responds to things without exhaustion. The tradition says: Like a circle without end, who can exhaust it?

I once doubted that before the Great Simplicity (*Taisu*) there was the Great Beginning (*Taishi*), and before the Great Beginning there was the Great Origin (*Taichu*). If so, then the Dao has never been without beginning or end. The Great Simplicity is the beginning of substance; the Great Beginning, the beginning of form; the Great Origin, the beginning of qi. If one can return to the root and trace back to the source, from the Great Simplicity to the Great Origin, it is like climbing a hundred-foot pole—one reaches the utmost limit and cannot ascend further. Yet they do not realize that beyond the Great Origin lies what is called the Great Change (*Taiyi*). The Great Change is where qi has not yet appeared. It is like taking one more step beyond the hundred-foot pole—only then does one see the Great Change. Without beginning, without end, without source, without return, no one knows its end, no one knows its beginning. Yet how can a scholar take that step beyond the hundred-foot pole?

Master Guan Yinzi said: Do not love the Dao, for love is water. Do not observe the Dao, for observation is fire. Do not pursue the Dao, for pursuit is wood. Do not speak of the Dao, for speech is metal. Do not contemplate the Dao, for contemplation is earth. Only the sage does not depart from fundamental nature and ascends the great Dao. When the heart has not yet sprouted, the Dao borrows it.

Master Baoyi said: Love, observation, pursuit, speech, and contemplation—these five arise from the heart. When the heart arises, all five arise; when the heart is quiescent, all five vanish. The scripture says: The five thieves reside in the heart and act upon heaven. Those in the world who cling to one aspect in seeking the Dao—whether love, observation, pursuit, speech, or contemplation—stir their hearts and move their thoughts, drifting ever farther from the Dao. Only the sage is not without love, yet love has never been love; not without observation, yet observation has never been observation; and so too with pursuit, speech, and contemplation—never pursuing, speaking, or contemplating. Thus they do not depart from fundamental nature and ascend the great Dao. Is the sage’s fundamental nature different from that of others? Only in that their heart has never sprouted.

Master Guan Yinzi said: Heavy clouds obscure the sky, and rivers and lakes darken. Fish swim in confusion, then suddenly glimpse a flash of light and moving food—a gift from heaven. They rush toward it and are caught by the fisherman’s hook. Those who do not know the selfless self and pursue the Dao are likewise deluded.

Master Baoyi said: Pursuit is wood—the heart has already sprouted. With a heart that pursues the Dao, one may encounter strange sights, strange objects, strange omens, strange qi, strange lights, strange illuminations, strange visions, strange inclinations, strange numinosity, strange penetrations. Clinging to these as the Dao is like fish rushing toward the flash of light and moving food. Only by knowing the selfless self does the heart become heartless—why then pursue?

Someone asked: Is not cultivation also pursuit? Is not diligence also pursuit? Both are incorrect. He said: In learning, one says "increase," so diligence is required. In retreat and cultivation, virtue is perfected. In the Dao, one says "diminish"—diminish and diminish again until reaching non-action. Non-action is non-action without non-action—this is called true diligence.

Master Guan Yinzi said: The methods of the *fangshi* in the world are many. Some esteem obscurity, some brightness, some weakness, some strength. Clinging to any of these is correct; not clinging to any is the Dao.

Master Baoyi said: In refining the true and cultivating nature, in achieving roundness, penetration, and awakening, what is esteemed differs. Some, observing sounds, esteem obscurity; some, stabilizing radiance, esteem brightness; some, through movement, esteem strength; some, through stillness, esteem weakness. These methods can all lead to the Dao. Yet if one clings to them, they are not the Dao but mere affairs. If one does not cling, they can all lead to the Dao. Between clinging and not clinging, the distance is vast.

Master Guan Yinzi said: The Dao can never be attained. What *can* be attained is called virtue, not the Dao. The Dao can never be practiced. What *can* be practiced is called conduct, not the Dao. The sage uses what can be attained and practiced to perfect life, and what cannot be attained or practiced to perfect death.

Master Baoyi said: The Dao cannot be departed from for an instant. What can be departed from is not the Dao. As for what can be attained and practiced, it can also be lost and stopped. What can be lost and stopped will at some point be departed from. Only what cannot be attained or practiced cannot be departed from for an instant. Where I am, there the Dao is.

The *Book of Changes* says: Manifest the Dao and spiritually enact virtue. The Dao is manifestly established from the self, yet virtue and conduct must not fail to be spiritual.

Yet what the sage attains of the Dao is all virtue; what the sage practices of the Dao is all conduct. Thus they accumulate virtue without daring to lose virtue, and amass conduct without daring to lose conduct. When merit fills three thousand, the Great Veil becomes an immortal; when conduct fills eight hundred, the Great Veil becomes a guest—all this is using what can be attained and practiced to perfect life.

As for what cannot be attained or practiced, how can there be what is called life? How can there be what is called death? This is how they perfect death.

Master Guanyin said: After hearing the Dao, those who act and cling do so to become human; those who neither act nor cling do so to become Heaven. Those who act will surely fail; those who cling will surely lose. Thus, one who hears the Dao in the morning may die by evening.

Master Baoyi said: Can the Dao truly be heard? It is heard in the heart, not in the ear. Can the Dao truly be transmitted? It is transmitted by Heaven, not by man. Can Heaven itself be clung to? Thus, those who act will again fail; those who cling will again lose—all this is the way of man. From this we know: if one does not hear the Dao from Heaven in the morning, one does not truly die by evening.

Master Guanyin said: With emotions utterly quiescent, one becomes a sage; with emotions wholly good, one becomes a worthy; with emotions wholly evil, one becomes a petty person. Those with utterly quiescent emotions possess an inherent nothingness that cannot be shown; those with good or evil emotions arise from nothing into being, which cannot be concealed. Those with good or evil emotions possess knowledge, for only sentient beings have it; those with utterly quiescent emotions possess no knowledge, and beneath the vast heavens, the Dao is nowhere absent.

Master Baoyi said: King Wen’s "not knowing, not perceiving," Confucius’s "without knowledge," and Laozi’s "able to be without knowledge"—all are the quiescent emotions of the sage. The nothingness inherent in being is vast and boundless, beyond description—how could it be shown? As for the benevolence of Yan and Meng or the cruelty of Jie and Zhou, all arise from nothing into being, manifest and impossible to conceal. Those with good or evil emotions possess knowledge, for all sentient beings are thus; those with utterly quiescent emotions possess no knowledge, and in no-knowledge they unite with the Great Void. Thus it is said: beneath the vast heavens, the Dao is nowhere absent.

Master Guanyin said: Do not assume that the sage’s tireless effort is called diligence, nor that the sage’s unwavering steadfastness is called clinging. The sage’s effort is like loosing an arrow: it moves by virtue of the target, not by its own motion. The sage’s steadfastness is like grasping an arrow: it holds by virtue of the target, not by its own holding.

Master Baoyi said: When it is time to act, act; when it is time to stop, stop—how could the sage ever be obstinate? When the time calls for the Nine, the sage "exerts unceasing effort," not through diligence but because the time demands movement, allowing no rest. When the time calls for the Six, the sage "benefits from eternal integrity," not through clinging but because the time demands stillness, allowing no motion. The *Book of Changes* says: "In movement and stillness, do not lose the proper time—thus the Dao shines forth." Therefore, the study of the Dao has its seasons and causes; how could the sage concern himself with movement or stillness? Those who observe the sage well observe only his timing.

Master Guanyin said: If one seeks the Dao through words, actions, learning, or knowledge, these will turn endlessly upon one another, never reaching the proper moment. Knowing words is like the murmur of a spring; knowing actions is like the flight of birds; knowing learning is like grasping at shadows; knowing knowledge is like interpreting dreams. The moment one ceases to cling, the Dao will come to meet you.

Master Baoyi said: Words, actions, learning, and knowledge can advance virtue and cultivate endeavors, but they cannot be used to seek the Dao. Beyond these four, where else could one seek it? Those who truly seek the Dao neither adhere to nor depart from these four. Knowing words is like the murmur of a spring, without right or wrong to discern; knowing actions is like the flight of birds, without good or evil to ponder; knowing learning is like grasping at shadows, without gain or loss to verify; knowing knowledge is like interpreting dreams, without principles to trace. Thus, with words, forget words; with actions, forget actions; with learning, forget learning; with knowledge, forget knowledge—then one approaches the Dao.

It is asked: Can the Dao be sought?
It is said: To seek is not true seeking; not to seek is true seeking. Thus it is said: The moment one ceases to cling, the Dao will come to meet you.

Master Guanyin said: To build things through affairs is difficult; to abandon things through the Dao is easy. All things under heaven are hard to complete and easy to destroy.

Master Baoyi said: When building things through affairs, the world’s people all rush to it without fearing its difficulty, for the work of action yields something to grasp—completing it is very hard, yet doing it is very easy. When abandoning things through the Dao, the world’s people all shrink from it without knowing its ease, for the work of non-action yields nothing to grasp—completing it is very easy, yet doing it is very hard. Whether establishing the world, founding states, building families, or cultivating the self, none can avoid accumulating virtue and amassing merit, advancing day by day and month by month, whether over years, lifetimes, or generations, without fearing toil—only then may one hope for success. Truly, it is not easy. Yet a single misstep, a single errant thought, a single wrong movement, a single moment of indulgence, and in an instant the world may be ruined, states overthrown, families broken, and the self lost. Thus it is said: completing is hard, and destroying is easy.

To the point of letting go at the precipice and willingly taking responsibility, without relying on cultivation, one instantly attains the Dao—this is supremely easy. Who but the most resolute and vigorous of great men could achieve this?

Master Guanyin said: A single spark can burn ten thousand things; when the things are gone, where does the fire remain? A single breath of the Dao can quiesce ten thousand things; when the things are gone, where does the Dao abide?

Bao Yi Zi said: All things under heaven possess form, and where there is form, there is the self. Yet among those with form but without self, only fire is so. Why? Fire does not stand alone—it appears only by clinging to things. Without self, if it does not attach to grass, wood, metal, or stone, where can fire exist? Thus, if fire were not to cling to anything, it would cease to be in the world. Yet when metal is struck or bamboo and wood are drilled, fire arrives unbidden. Does fire truly exist? Does it truly not exist? The sage compares the Dao to fire—ah, what a fine analogy!

Guan Yin Zi said: In this world, some die after a single day of life, others after ten or a hundred years. Those who die in a day are like those who attain the Dao in a single breath; those who die after ten or a hundred years are like those who attain it after long effort. Those not yet dead, though they move and act with clarity and wisdom, are merely called "alive," not "dead." Those who have not grasped the Dao, though they move and act with clarity and wisdom, are merely called "engaged in affairs," not "in the Dao."

Bao Yi Zi said: The ancients spoke of "just born, just dying; just dying, just born." For "just born, just dying"—this birth is not true birth; "just dying, just born"—this death is not true death. Now, those who live a day and die—is their birth truly birth? Is their death truly death? The same holds for those who live ten or a hundred years. How do we know true death? It is when one moves and acts with clarity and wisdom. But who does not move and act with clarity and wisdom? Those not yet dead are merely called "alive," and those who have not grasped the Dao are merely called "engaged in affairs." Ah, how can one speak of the Dao with those who have not truly died?

Guan Yin Zi said: Not knowing that my Dao is without words or deeds, yet seeking the Dao through words and deeds—suddenly encountering some strange thing and stubbornly taking it for the Dao—one does not realize that abandoning the source to seek the flow will never reach the source, nor will abandoning the root to seek the branches ever reach the root.

Bao Yi Zi said: Words and deeds can advance virtue but cannot advance the Dao. Seeking the Dao through words and deeds not only fails to attain it but also loses virtue. Why? Those who seek the Dao excessively, beyond seeking virtue, overuse their minds. Deeming good words and deeds insufficient, they pursue strange speech and extraordinary conduct, believing these to be the path to transcend virtue and enter the Dao. Then, when some strange event matches their strange words or some strange thing responds to their strange conduct, the learner, failing to awaken, stubbornly clings to it as the Dao. Without exception, they encounter demonic realms as described in the Daoist scriptures and Buddhist texts. It is not merely that they never reach the source or the root—the harm they suffer is beyond words.

Guan Yin Zi said: In archery, charioteering, lute-playing, music—or chess—no skill can be mastered in a single breath. Only the Dao, being formless and boundless, can be attained in a single breath.

Bao Yi Zi said: Worldly affairs and endeavors require great effort, yet people delight in them. The great Dao, being effortless, requires little effort, yet people do not pursue it. Why? Worldly affairs are like archery, charioteering, lute-playing, or chess—there are objects and rules, teachers and practice, so they can be gradually mastered. Without accumulating years and months, one cannot reach their subtlety. The great Dao has no color, no form, no measure, no direction. It cannot be taught, cannot be practiced, cannot be gradually approached. Some attain it in the snap of a finger, while others, despite years of effort, do not. Others attain it in a single instant. The difference is vast. This is because the work of effortful action and the work of effortless action are not the same.

Guan Yin Zi said: When two archers meet, skill or clumsiness is revealed. When two chess players meet, victory or defeat is revealed. When two Daoists meet, there is nothing to show—no skill, no clumsiness, no victory, no defeat.

Bao Yi Zi said: When Confucius met Wenbo Xuezi in Lu, their eyes met, and the Dao was present—nothing to show, nothing to say. Yet there are those in the world who, when host and guest meet, debate right and wrong to compare depth and shallowness—both have missed the mark. How can one find someone whose eyes meet yours, with whom you can simply gaze and smile?

Guan Yin Zi said: My Dao is like the sea. Cast in ten million pieces of gold, it is not seen; cast in ten million stones, it is not seen; cast in ten million filths, it is not seen. It can carry tiny shrimp and small fish, and it can carry great whales and leviathans. Gathering all waters into it, it is not full; dispersing all waters from it, it is not empty.

Bao Yi Zi said: Comparing the Dao to the sea is indeed a fine analogy. In its essence, it accepts gold, stone, filth, shrimp, fish, whales, and leviathans without exception. In its function, whether gathering or dispersing, it benefits and conceals without fail. Vast is the sea! Vast is the Dao! Yet if the sea knew that a single thing remained within it or that a single drop was gathered or dispersed, the sea would no longer be the sea. Does the sea know? Does the Dao know?

Guan Yin Zi said: My Dao is like dwelling in darkness. Those in brightness cannot see a single thing in the dark, but those in darkness can see all things in the light.

Bao Yi Zi said: Dwelling in darkness, one does not see the self but sees things. Not seeing the self is to forget the self, and the body vanishes. Seeing things is to be clear and not deluded. To forget the self and be clear yet undeluded—this is the sage’s achievement. As for those in brightness, they see the self, and seeing the self, they see brightness. Seeing brightness, they cannot see a single thing in the dark. Thus, the multitude bustles about like ascending the terrace in spring—all forms are displayed, honor and disgrace both alarm, and they are deluded by dependence and hidden forces, unaware and unknowing. What is to be gained?

Guanyin Zi said: The power of the petty person resides in evil; the power of the noble person resides in goodness; the power of the sage resides in non-attainment. Only through non-attainment does one embody the Dao.

Bao Yi Zi said: All people possess this power—it is only a matter of where it resides. "Power" refers to that which has no fixed designation. Is the petty person invariably evil? If he can turn toward goodness, he becomes noble. Is the noble person invariably good? Should he act hastily in evil, he becomes petty. Only the sage’s power is like empty space, residing in non-attainment. The learner, in the moment between neither-thinking-good nor-thinking-evil, seeks where this power resides—this is near indeed.

Guanyin Zi said: My Dao is like a sword: when its edge cuts things, it is sharp; when grasped by the hand, it wounds.

Bao Yi Zi said: The undiscerning do not comprehend the Dao. Those who comprehend the Dao resolve all worldly affairs without difficulty or ease, all cleaving to the blade as it passes. For their spirit is firm and luminous, their wisdom penetrating and clear—things manifest of themselves, matters judge themselves, and they know not how it is so, yet so it is. How could the slightest human effort intervene? But to measure one’s own spirit, to scrutinize one’s own wisdom—what is firm, what is luminous, what is penetrating, what is clear—is like grasping the blade with the hand: few escape injury.

Guanyin Zi said: The lotus does not ask the bean, and the bean does not answer the lotus; the tile does not ask the stone, and the stone does not answer the tile. The Dao does not lose—alternately, does not recognize. Question and answer flow as one qi; where is the Dao?

Bao Yi Zi said: The Dao has no questions; questions have no responses. Thus, person dwells with person, Dao meets Dao, and there are questions and answers, the flow of a single qi. Why not observe the lotus and bean, the tile and stone? The lotus and bean discourse on propriety all day, yet the blind do not see; the tile and stone converse on the Dao all day, yet the deaf do not hear. Then do the lotus and bean, the tile and stone have questions and answers, or is it the flow of a single qi?

Guanyin Zi said: Those who look up to the Dao diverge; those who emulate the Dao are few. All know the affairs of the Dao, but none know the Dao itself. Therefore, the sage does not expect the Dao to yield, nor rely on it to prosper; does not borrow the Dao from the sage, nor peddle it to the foolish.

Bao Yi Zi said: The Dao cannot be sought—those who seek it do not obtain it. The Dao cannot be spoken—those who chase it do not reach it. The Dao cannot be relied upon—those who rely on it do not honor it. The Dao cannot be displayed—those who display it do not esteem it. Worldly scholars have not attained the Dao: they look up and stumble, gaze and feel discontent, follow teachers to acquire it, or imitate others to emulate it—all are those who seek and chase it. Once the Dao is attained, to rely on it and feel self-sufficient, or to display it and peddle it to the foolish, is to fail in honor and esteem. These know only the affairs of the Dao, not the Dao itself. What do they possess of the Dao? As for the sage, he obtains without a teacher, reaches without pursuit, possesses without reliance, and esteems without display. Before him, no sage; after him, no fool. He comes and goes alone; those who know him are few—thus is he noble.

The first scroll of *Wenshi Zhenjing: Implicit Principles Beyond Words* concludes.

**Er Zhu Pian**
The Pillars—establishing Heaven and Earth—comprises twelve chapters in all.

Guanyin Zi said: Whether a bowl or a basin, a jar or a pot, an urn or a vat, all can establish Heaven and Earth. Tortoise shells and milfoil stalks, broken tiles and inscribed stones—all can foretell good and ill fortune. Thus, within the principles of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things, each thing contains the whole, and every thing contains it. None borrow from another. When my essence merges with their essence, the two essences interact, and spirit responds.

One female and one male hatch from eggs; one yin and one yang gestate in the womb. Form is their essence; principle is their spirit. Love is my essence; observation is my spirit. Love is water; observation is fire. When love grasps and observation follows, it becomes wood. When observation abides and love gathers, it becomes metal.

First, conceive of the primordial qi, complete within a single thing. Grasp love to unite with its form, and obscurely observe to unite with its principle—thus the image is preserved. The image of a single movement pervades the great void: rising from the center, it becomes Heaven; descending from the center, it becomes Earth. There is no rising that does not descend, no descending that does not rise. That which rises is fire; that which descends is water. That which desires to rise but cannot is wood; that which desires to descend but cannot is metal.

As for wood: drilling it yields fire, wringing it yields water. As for metal: striking it yields fire, smelting it yields water. Metal and wood are the intersection of water and fire. Water is essence and Heaven; fire is spirit and Earth; wood is the hun-soul and humanity; metal is the po-soul and things. That which moves without cease is time; that which encompasses and resides within is direction. Only Earth begins and ends it. Some resolve it; some reveal it.

Bao Yi Zi said: Heaven and Earth are the parents of the myriad things. The myriad things are born of Heaven and Earth, each possessing the body of Heaven and Earth in microcosm. Possessing this body, they possess this principle. Though they be bowls, basins, jars, or vats, all contain Heaven and Earth. Though they be tortoise shells, milfoil, tiles, or stones, all hold good and ill fortune.

Even inanimate things are thus—how much more so beings of blood and qi, endowed with sentience? How much more so humans, the most spiritually refined of all creatures? When spirit and essence subtly respond to form, when principle and appearance are cherished and preserved, life arises through gathering and nurturing, perpetuating without end. Who but the most profoundly enlightened in the world can partake in this?

People merely know that spirit belongs to Heaven and essence to Earth, yet do not realize that the fire of spirit ascends from Earth, while the water of essence descends from Heaven. That which longs to ascend but cannot becomes wood and humanity; that which longs to descend but cannot becomes metal and things. Metal and wood are the intersection of water and fire, and thus each possesses the nature of water and fire. Moving without cease, the four seasons arise; encompassing and residing within, the four directions are established. Once the four seasons are born and the four directions stand firm, the Great Center is achieved. When the Great Center is achieved, Earth becomes supreme. Thus, whether initiating or concluding, resolving or dividing, revealing or manifesting—all are the work of central Earth.

When the qi of the Great Center pervades the vastness of space, Heaven naturally ascends from the center, and Earth naturally descends from the center, and so the forms of Heaven and Earth are distinguished. There is nothing that ascends without descending, nothing that descends without ascending—this is the mutual ascent and descent of spirit and essence between above and below. Thus, in humans, the roots of the hair are on the head while the limbs hang downward, for the hun-soul descends from Heaven. In grasses and trees, the roots are below while the branches and stems reach upward, for the po-soul ascends from Earth. In birds and beasts, which grow horizontally, the root lies in the tail. Though they possess the sentience of blood and qi, they intermingle with the natures of metal and wood. With the five phases interwoven, creatures of all kinds—each with its own endowment and root—are beyond enumeration.

Guan Yin Zi said: The people of the world cannot be counted by the billions, and each person’s dreams differ; every night’s dreams differ. Within them are Heaven and Earth, humans and things, all shaped by thought—beyond reckoning by specks of dust. How can we know that the present Heaven and Earth are not likewise shaped by thought?

Bao Yi Zi said: Are the Heaven, Earth, humans, and things in dreams different from those in waking life, or not different? Are they all shaped by thought, or not shaped by thought? When infants have not yet learned to think, they perceive Heaven, Earth, humans, and things, yet do not recognize them as such. That they are called Heaven, Earth, humans, and things depends on perception. Before infants have perception, can they dream of Heaven, Earth, humans, and things? At first, they do not recognize what they see; only with time does it coalesce, imprinted by the water of the heart, and thus dreams take form—just as within jade, stone, scales, and horns, mountains, rivers, stars, and moons coalesce and crystallize, their shapes fully preserved. Yet do scales and horns think? Do jade and stone think? Knowing whether scales, horns, jade, and stone think, one knows whether Heaven and Earth think.

Guan Yin Zi said: The heart responds to jujubes, the liver to elms—I communicate with Heaven and Earth. Before rain, one dreams of water; before clear skies, one dreams of fire—Heaven and Earth communicate with me. I and Heaven and Earth seem joined, seem separate, purely merging and returning.

Bao Yi Zi said: Heaven and Earth are the greatest of forms; the human body is the smallest. Viewed through form, there is a distinction between great and small; viewed through spirit, there is no separation or union. The brightness and darkness of Heaven’s sun and moon are the flourishing and decline of human spirit—how could it be only that one dreams of water before rain and fire before clear skies? The five flavors of Earth’s medicines and foods are the likes and dislikes of the five viscera—how could it be only that the heart responds to jujubes and the liver to elms? Are I and Heaven and Earth one or two? Do we return together, or each return separately?

Guan Yin Zi said: Though Heaven and Earth are vast, they possess color and form, number and direction. Yet I possess that which is neither color nor form, neither number nor direction, and therein abides that which is Heaven-as-Heaven and Earth-as-Earth.

Bao Yi Zi said: That which gives life has never truly been born; that which brings death has never truly died. Thus, that which is Heaven-as-Heaven is not Heaven, and that which is Earth-as-Earth is not Earth. People merely see what has form, color, number, and direction, and call it Heaven—yet they do not know that what is without form, color, number, or direction is what enables Heaven-as-Heaven, Earth-as-Earth, life-as-life, and death-as-death. Only when scholars truly recognize and fully embody this do they realize it cannot be named in words or likened in form. The ancients spoke of "neither mind nor thing," of "detaching from nature and appearance." Hanshan Zi called it "the Heaven within Heaven"—yet even this is but a forced name. How could it be truly spoken?

Guan Yin Zi said: Those who die in the womb or within the egg—whether human or creature—though Heaven and Earth are vast, they know nothing of them. Those who calculate Heaven and Earth do so only through their own limited perception. It is like a hand not touching the blade, and the blade not cutting the hand.

Bao Yi Zi said: Perception is easy to acquire, but hard to discard. A single glimpse in youth may bind one for a lifetime—so tightly does perception shackle the human mind. How fearsome! Those who die in the womb or egg certainly do not see Heaven and Earth, but when they were in the womb or egg, did they possess perception? Or were they without it? If they had no perception, then why were they in the womb or egg? Yet if they were in the womb or egg, did Heaven and Earth truly exist within them? Or did they not? The Buddhists regard perception as the subtlest of the five aggregates, for it is the hardest to forget. Without perception, there would be no birth; without birth, there would be no entrapment in the yin of the womb, egg, or damp transformation. Thus, those who claim Heaven and Earth exist do so only through their own limited perception. Heaven and Earth never demand human perception. Therefore, it is said: "I do not touch the blade, and the blade does not wound me."

Guan Yin Zi said: Within dreams, within mirrors, within water—Heaven and Earth exist there as well. To dispel the Heaven and Earth of dreams, one must sleep without dreaming. To dispel the Heaven and Earth of mirrors, one must not look into them. To dispel the Heaven and Earth of water, one must not draw from the vessel. Their existence or nonexistence lies not in those things, but in oneself. Thus, the sage does not discard Heaven and Earth, but discards perception.

Bao Yi Zi said: Heaven and Earth bestow great kindness upon humanity, yet they are also great thieves. Knowing their thievery, one is no longer robbed by them. Heaven and Earth do not steal from people—people steal from themselves. Why? The Heaven and Earth and the ten thousand things within the breast first appear like visions in a dream, then like reflections in a mirror, and finally congeal in the spirit-water, persisting until death without forgetting their thievery. How can this be fully expressed? Yet dreams arise from sleep, reflections from gazing, and water’s images from drawing. To draw is to take; dreams arise from seeing, seeing from taking, and taking from perception. Thus, it is said: Do not discard Heaven and Earth, but discard perception. For when one speaks of Heaven and Earth, the ten thousand things are already within them.

Guan Yin Zi said: Heaven is not Heaven of itself—there is that which makes it Heaven. Earth is not Earth of itself—there is that which makes it Earth. It is like houses, boats, and chariots, which depend on people to be completed; they do not complete themselves. Knowing that they depend on something else, and that this does not depend on anything, one sees neither Heaven above nor Earth below, neither self within nor others without.

Bao Yi Zi said: Heaven is not Heaven of itself, and thus it endures long. Earth is not Earth of itself, and thus it lasts forever. If people were not people of themselves, and I were not I of myself, then we could share in the long endurance of Heaven and Earth. Do Heaven and Earth truly depend on people to be completed? What depends on people is merely the Heaven and Earth within their own breasts. Dependence lies in that which is external, but completion or incompletion lies within oneself. Thus, those who do not act as Heaven and Earth see neither Heaven above nor Earth below, neither self within nor others without.

Guan Yin Zi said: That which has time is qi. That which is not qi has never known day or night. That which has direction is form. That which is not form has never known south or north. What is meant by "not qi"? It is that from which qi itself arises—like the wind obtained by waving a fan. Before the fan moves, it is not the qi of wind; once the fan moves, it is called qi. What is meant by "not form"? It is that from which form itself arises—like fire obtained by drilling wood. Before the wood is drilled, it is not the form of fire; once the wood is drilled, it is called form.

Bao Yi Zi said: Qi cannot generate qi; that which generates qi is not qi. Form cannot generate form; that which generates form is not form. Someone asked: If qi cannot generate qi, that is beyond question. But if form cannot generate form, then how do humans and the ten thousand things generate form from form? I replied: Withered wood and dead corpses are also form—can they generate form? When humans and the ten thousand things generate form from form, it is because that which is not form abides within them. Even metal, stone, grass, and trees are no exception. Thus, the sages used fire as a metaphor to show that even the most refined form is like this—how much more so the coarse forms! That which is not qi generates qi when stirred; that which is not form generates form when drilled or polished. Qi is Heaven, possessing time, day and night. Form is Earth, possessing direction, south and north. The world has those who select auspicious times and directions to seek the generation of qi and form—yet do they know that time existed before Heaven and Earth were divided, and direction is merely the natural position of the south?!

Guan Yin Zi said: The changes of cold, heat, warmth, and frost are like tiles and stones—place them in fire and they grow hot, place them in water and they grow cold, breathe upon them and they warm, inhale over them and they freeze. This occurs only because external things come and go, while those tiles and stones neither come nor go.

Just as reflections in water come and go, yet the water itself neither comes nor goes.

Baoyi Zi said: My foolish understanding of the *Cantong Qi* once stated: Heaven and Earth cannot create day and night—they arise from the coming and going of the sun and moon. Heaven and Earth cannot produce cold and heat—they arise from the nearness and distance of the sun and moon. This speaks of the constancy of cold and heat. Yet in the height of summer, icy winds may blow; in the depths of winter, sudden warmth may arise. These are irregular qi, untimely winds, fleeting in their coming and going—not acts of Heaven and Earth, but merely the passage of guest qi. Thus, like reflections in water that come and go, the water itself neither comes nor goes.

Guan Yin Zi said: Shake a robe in empty space and wind is born; exhale upon an object and water is produced. Pour water and it murmurs; strike stone against stone and light flashes. One who understands this can summon wind, rain, thunder, and lightning. For wind, rain, thunder, and lightning all arise from qi, and qi arises from the mind. Just as dwelling inwardly on great fire brings heat over time, and dwelling inwardly on great water brings cold, one who grasps this can align with the virtue of Heaven and Earth.

Baoyi Zi said: People know that spirit, soul, ethereal and corporeal souls are like Heaven’s wind, rain, thunder, and lightning. Wind, rain, thunder, and lightning issue from Heaven, yet humans can replicate them—how then can one’s own spirit, soul, ethereal and corporeal souls not be self-generated, self-nurtured, self-preserved, and self-refined? Knowing that shaking empty space produces wind, one can sound the flute of one’s breath to generate qi. Knowing that exhaling upon an object produces water, one can transform one’s qi into essence. Knowing that pouring water makes it murmur, one can refine one’s essence to govern the corporeal soul. Knowing that striking stone produces light, one can forge one’s corporeal soul to augment the spirit. Thus, observing the Way of Heaven and grasping its workings, the control of the *Yinfu* lies in qi, and the control of qi lies in the mind. Imagine fire and grow hot; imagine water and grow cold. Merge with Heaven and it is Heaven; merge with Earth and it is Earth. A thousand transformations, ten thousand changes—nothing is beyond mastery. One’s virtue aligns with Heaven and Earth—truly so!

Guan Yin Zi said: The changes of the five clouds can foretell the year’s harvest; the arrival of the eight winds can foretell the moment’s fortune. Thus, good and ill omens, disasters and blessings, are but the movement of a single qi. To merge self and other, to unite with Heaven and Earth—yet those of private cunning claim them as their own.

Baoyi Zi said: The five clouds and eight winds, whether bearing disaster or blessing, are all the movement of a single qi, foretelling good and ill within Heaven and Earth. Qi as qi—how wondrous! How numinous! Yet the deluded do not know it. When one person is moved, the five clouds shift and the eight winds change, for something most wondrous and numinous resides within. Thus, whether called self or other, Heaven or Earth, all is interconnected. Yet those of private cunning claim it as their own—how could they know the Way of vast emptiness, spiritual penetration, and great unity?

Guan Yin Zi said: Heaven and Earth are lodged, the myriad things are lodged, I am lodged, the Dao is lodged. If separated from lodging, the Dao cannot stand.

Baoyi Zi said: Lodging means having no fixed abode within oneself. The ancients said: A person’s life between Heaven and Earth is like a white colt flashing past a gap—gone in an instant. What is this if not lodging? I am lodged, thus Heaven and Earth are lodged. Heaven and Earth do not form themselves—they await me to make them Heaven and Earth. Thus, if I am lodged, Heaven and Earth are lodged; if Heaven and Earth are lodged, the myriad things are lodged. I and Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things are all lodged—yet if the Dao alone were not lodged and endured forever, then I and the Dao would be two. How could the Dao stand? When the person exists, their Dao exists; when the person perishes, their Dao ceases. Thus, if separated from lodging, the Dao cannot stand.

**Scroll Three: The Three Ultimates**

The "Ultimates" reveres the sage—comprising twenty-seven chapters in all.

Master Guan Yin says: In governing the world, the sage makes no distinction of my worth or folly, thus responding to others’ worth with worth and to others’ folly with folly. He makes no distinction of my right or wrong, thus affirming what is right in affairs and rejecting what is wrong. Knowing the great unity of past and present, he may prioritize the ancient or the contemporary; knowing the great unity of inner and outer, he may prioritize the internal or the external. No thing under Heaven can burden him, so he grounds himself in humility; no thing can estrange him, so he embraces emptiness; no thing can obstruct him, so he acts with ease; no thing can block him, so he adapts with flexibility. With this, he centers the world and may establish rites; with this, he harmonizes the world and may create music; with this, he makes the world impartial and may manage resources; with this, he encompasses the world and may repel aggression; with this, he follows the world and may enact laws; with this, he observes the world and may craft tools.

The sage does not govern the world by himself but governs the world through the world. The world ascribes merit to the sage, yet the sage attributes merit to the world. Thus, in the governance of Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang, the world all called it natural.

Master Baoyi says: Heaven does nothing, yet the myriad transformations are accomplished; the sage does nothing, yet the world is governed. What mind does the sage possess?

People merely see him establishing rites, creating music, managing resources, repelling aggression, enacting laws, and crafting tools—nurturing and perfecting all without omission. They suppose the sage ponders each thing, calculates each affair, and applies his own wisdom and strength to the world’s matters. Yet they do not realize: the sage grounds himself in humility, embraces emptiness, acts with ease, and adapts with flexibility. He responds to others’ worth with worth and to others’ folly with folly; he affirms what is right and rejects what is wrong. He does not let past or present dictate precedence in his heart, nor does he weigh inner and outer in his affairs. Instead, he governs the world through the world. The world ascribes merit to the sage, yet the sage does not claim merit for himself but attributes it to the world. This is the Dao—attained by Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang—so all called it natural.

Master Guan Yin says: Heaven covers all without exception—giving life and taking it, yet Heaven harbors no love or hatred. The sun illuminates all without distinction—shining on the beautiful and the ugly, yet the sun shows no partiality.

Master Baoyi says: The sage is like Heaven—things live and die, yet Heaven harbors no love or hatred. The sage is like the sun—things are beautiful or ugly, yet the sun shows no partiality. This is the governance of the sage, who does nothing and has no mind.

Master Guan Yin says: The sage’s Dao follows Heaven’s mandate; it is not that the sage can Dao by himself. The sage’s virtue aligns with the times; it is not that the sage can virtue by himself. The sage’s affairs arise from human effort; it is not that the sage can act by himself. Thus, the sage does not possess Dao, does not possess virtue, does not possess affairs.

Master Baoyi says: The sage has no self, so his Dao follows Heaven’s mandate—he does not possess Dao himself. His virtue aligns with the times—he does not possess virtue himself. His affairs arise from human effort—he does not possess affairs himself. Those who cling to possessing Dao, virtue, or affairs are but ordinary people—how could they forget the self?

Master Guan Yin says: The sage knows the self is no-self, so he unites with others through benevolence. He knows affairs are no-self, so he weighs them with righteousness. He knows the heart is no-self, so he restrains it with propriety. He knows knowledge is no-self, so he illuminates it with wisdom. He knows words are no-self, so he upholds them with trust.

Master Baoyi says: The sage’s five constants are like those of ordinary people—how could they differ? Yet ordinary people’s five constants cannot forget the self, while the sage’s five constants arise from no-self. This is how he differs from others. Benevolence without self unites the world’s selves as benevolence; righteousness without self weighs the world’s affairs as righteousness; propriety without self restrains the world’s hearts as propriety; wisdom without self illuminates the world’s knowledge as wisdom; trust without self upholds the world’s words as trust. This is why he cannot be surpassed!

Master Guan Yin says: The sage’s Dao may take benevolence as benevolence, or righteousness as benevolence, or propriety, wisdom, or trust as benevolence. Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust each encompass the five—yet the sage unifies them without fixation, so the world cannot name them.

Master Baoyi says: Taking transformation as benevolence, the world’s people can know and practice it. But taking righteousness, propriety, wisdom, or trust as benevolence—who but the world’s utmost sages could attain this? Why? For in elevating one constant, all five are complete. The five rotate and cycle, each encompassing the five. Compared to those of superior wisdom who favor benevolence but neglect righteousness, whose wisdom is abundant but trust insufficient, the difference is vast.

The *Book of Changes* says: "The benevolent see it as benevolence; the wise see it as wisdom." Thus, the sage’s Dao is boundless and unfathomable—how could it be named or described? Hence, it is said: the sage unifies without fixation, and the world cannot name it.

Master Guan Yin says: Do not observe the sage by his conduct—for the Dao leaves no traces. Do not observe the sage by his words—for the Dao has no speech. Do not observe the sage by his abilities—for the Dao does nothing. Do not observe the sage by his appearance—for the Dao has no form.

Master Baoyi says: The Dao has no form, no traces, no words, no action—how then can scholars seek it? If they must seek, let them seek it in the sage.

The sage is the embodiment of the Dao—yet can it truly be sought in the sage? To seek it in the sage is merely to seek in his words, appearance, conduct, and abilities, and thus one strays ever further from it. Beyond words, appearance, conduct, and abilities, how then can one perceive the sage?

He who perceives the sage well perceives his heart, not his manifestations. Yet can the sage’s heart truly be perceived? Is it truly unperceivable? Is it distinct from our own hearts, or is it not distinct? As stated in the previous chapter: *"Do not borrow the Dao from the sage."* This is what it means.

Master Guan Yin says: Though conduct may be most lofty, it does not escape high and low. Though speech may be most refined, it does not escape right and wrong. Though ability may be most divine, it does not escape skill and clumsiness. Though appearance may be most singular, it does not escape beauty and ugliness. The sage borrows these to manifest before the world; when the world is deluded by them, it sees the sage.

Master Baoyi says: The sage fundamentally has no words, appearance, conduct, or abilities. Only out of necessity does he borrow these to manifest before the world. Yet people merely see the refinement of the sage’s words, the singularity of his appearance, the loftiness of his conduct, and the divinity of his abilities, and claim the Dao resides within these four. They then distinguish right and wrong, beauty and ugliness, high and low, skill and clumsiness—thus they are ever less able to recognize the sage. Scholars who are deluded by these four yet perceive beyond them truly study well.

Master Guan Yin says: The sage takes the bee as his teacher to establish ruler and minister, the spider to establish nets and snares, the kangaroo rat to institute rites, and the mantis to deploy troops. (Another version reads: The masses take the worthy as their teacher, the worthy take the sage as their teacher, and the sage takes the myriad things as his teacher.) Only when the sage is one with things does he have no self.

Master Baoyi says: The masses follow the worthy, the worthy follow the sage, and the sage follows the myriad things—this is certain. Yet does the sage truly take the bee to establish ruler and minister, the spider and rat and mantis to institute nets, rites, and troops? The sage, being one with things and acting without self, takes all things under heaven as his teachers. Things arise naturally, and the sage follows their spontaneity—what intent does he have?

Master Guan Yin says: In food and drink, clothing, houses, boats, and carriages, the sage is the same as the common people. In nobility and baseness, wealth and poverty, he is the same as they. The common people often resemble the sage, and the sage often resembles the common people. Those who look up to his loftiness and marvel at his greatness—are they correct, or are they not?

Master Baoyi says: The sage’s way of dwelling in the world is to blend his light and mingle with the dust, ever fearful of setting himself apart from the common people. In his daily life, clothing, food, wealth, poverty, nobility, and baseness, how would he dare differ from others? To make people look up to his loftiness and marvel at his greatness is what the sage fears.

When Shi Chengqi met Laozi, he said: "I observe that you are no sage. There are leftover vegetables in the mouse holes, and the food before you is not fully eaten, yet you hoard drink without end." Laozi remained silent and did not respond. Thus, in dwelling among the world, how could the sage tolerate the admiration and marveling of the common people?

Master Guan Yin says: The sage speaks of the Dao, seeing heaven, earth, and the myriad things as his Dao. He harmonizes with them, begins and ends with them, colors them blue and yellow, nurtures them as fledglings under wings. He does not love the Dao, nor does he abandon things. He does not exalt the noble, nor does he despise the lowly.

The worthy speak of things, and each thing is different. Day by day, they cast some aside and take others up, shortening and lengthening, straightening and squaring them—these are those who are altered by things. Little do they know that the sage scorns such mingling and sorting, such distinctions and arrangements, using them for others but not for himself.

Master Baoyi says: In the Dao, the sage is like tangled silk; in affairs, he is like woven cloth. He initiates a sound, and a sound responds; he begins an affair, and an affair concludes. He colors it blue, and it becomes blue; he colors it yellow, and it becomes yellow. He nurtures things as fledglings, and they are sheltered under wings. He does not love the Dao, nor does he abandon things. He does not exalt the noble, nor does he despise the lowly—this is how the Dao is like tangled silk. As for the mingling of myriad things, their distinctions and arrangements, some short and some long, some straight and some square, each thing different, day by day casting some aside and taking others up, all in perfect order—this is how affairs are like woven cloth.

The sage is devoted to the Dao, without intent or self, and thus is not altered by things. The worthy are devoted to things, with intent and self, and thus cannot avoid being altered by things.

Master Guan Yin says: If a fish wishes to differ from the school of fish, it leaps onto the shore and dies. If a tiger wishes to differ from the pack of tigers, it leaves the mountain and enters the marketplace, where it is captured. The sage does not differ from the common people—it is simply that things cannot confine him.

Master Baoyi says: Zhuangzi said: "In the past, I heard from the great man: He who boasts of himself has no merit; he who achieves merit falls; he who achieves fame is diminished. Who can relinquish merit and fame and return to the common people? Pure and constant, he sheds reputation and power, demands nothing of others, and others demand nothing of him." This is the meaning of the sage not differing from the common people.

Yet as for roaming in the carved grove and forgetting oneself, seeing the profit in a strange magpie and forgetting one’s truth, being pursued by the gamekeeper and feeling shamed, fleeing and not returning home for three months—this is what it means for the fish to leap onto the shore and the tiger to enter the marketplace. Though the sage dwells among the people without setting himself apart, how could things confine him?

Master Guan Yin says: The Dao does nothing. To respond to the world with the Dao is to engage in affairs, not the Dao. The Dao has no direction. To lodge the Dao in things is to deal with things, not the Dao. The sage ultimately cannot bring forth the Dao to show it to others.

Master Baoyi says: The Dao is fundamentally non-action, yet to respond to the world with the Dao is to engage in affairs. The Dao is fundamentally formless, yet to lodge the Dao in things is to deal with things. The sage ultimately cannot bring forth this Dao to show it to others. Then how can those devoted to the Dao attain it?

Of old, it was said: If the Dao could be offered, none would fail to offer it to their lord; if the Dao could be advanced, none would fail to advance it to their kin; if the Dao could be transmitted, none would fail to transmit it to their descendants. Precisely because it cannot be brought forth to show others, those who attain it are few. Does this mean the sage never transmits it to others? Yet did not Confucius say, *"I hide nothing from you"*?

Those who would truly observe the sage must look beyond affairs and things.

Master Guan Yin says: Like a bell sounding as a bell, like a drum resounding as a drum—such are the sage’s words. Like a cart moving as a cart, like a boat sailing as a boat—such are the sage’s actions. Yet none can name it, and so he retires all under heaven from speech. None can comprehend it, and so he seizes all under heaven from knowledge.

Master Baoyi says: Call a bell a bell, and all agree; call a drum a bell, and none fathom his words—thus he retires all under heaven from speech. Call a cart a cart in motion, and all agree; call a boat a cart in motion, and none grasp his actions—thus he seizes all under heaven from knowledge. It is like a dog mistaken for a sheep, or a wheel that does not roll upon the earth—can such things be named? Can they be known by wisdom?

Master Guan Yin says: The earthworm eats the soil, the soil nourishes the leech, the turtle eats the earthworm—each devours the other. The sage’s words are likewise: some speak of the ills of being, others of the ills of non-being, still others of the ills of neither being nor non-being. His speech moves like a saw’s teeth, yet the truly sagely leave no single word behind.

Master Baoyi says: The great Dao cannot be spoken. The truly sagely do not speak—not because there is nothing to say, but because it cannot be said. To speak of what cannot be spoken is to invite error. Why? Speech does not escape being and non-being. To speak of being is to negate non-being; to speak of non-being is to negate being. To speak of neither being nor non-being is to negate neither non-being nor being. Being and non-being consume each other, each giving rise to error, like the leech, soil, and earthworm devouring one another, like a saw’s teeth moving back and forth in endless tugging. Thus, to speak is not as good as to remain silent.

Yet does the sage truly leave no word behind? The sage’s words fill the world. If scholars take the sage’s words as their own words, not only do they fail to understand speech—they lose the sage entirely.

Master Guan Yin says: The dragon can become a flood-dragon, a serpent, a tortoise, a fish, or a clam; the flood-dragon is only a flood-dragon—it cannot become a dragon, nor a serpent, tortoise, fish, or clam. The sage is like the dragon; the worthy, like the flood-dragon.

Master Baoyi says: The sage can be great or small, wise or foolish, defiled or pure, noble or base, long-lived or short-lived—transforming in a thousand ways, without limitation. The worthy are not so: what is great cannot be small; what is wise cannot be foolish.

Of old, when Confucius met Laozi, he returned and told his disciples: *"Only now have I seen the dragon! The dragon coalesces into form, scatters into pattern, rides the clouds and qi, and nourishes itself in yin and yang. My mouth gaped, yet I could not speak—what counsel could I offer Lao Dan?"*

Zigong said: *"Then are there truly men who dwell like corpses yet manifest like dragons, whose thunderous voices fall silent like abysses, whose movements mirror heaven and earth? Might I, too, witness such a one?"*

The sage is like the dragon; the worthy, like the flood-dragon—is this not what is meant?

Master Guan Yin says: Abiding nowhere within himself, his form does not cling to itself. His movement is like water, his stillness like a mirror, his response like an echo. Vague as if vanished, silent as if purified, those who harmonize with him find harmony; those who grasp at him lose him. He never precedes others, yet always follows them.

Master Baoyi says: Abiding nowhere within himself, to abide is to have a self. Without self, form and things manifest of themselves—not through his own discrimination. This is stillness. Stillness reaches its limit and moves; his movement is like flowing water. Movement returns to stillness, and his stillness is like a polished mirror. Though there is movement and stillness, when were they ever truly movement and stillness? In responding to things, he is like an echo answering sound—then am I like empty space, a hollow valley. Vague as if nothing were there, yet profoundly clear and pure. Harmonizing with things without setting himself apart, he is at peace with them without contention. Startled by what he attains yet not possessing it, he forgets the Dao yet does not lose it. Never preceding others, he always follows—daring not to take the lead. Yet he always follows others, harmonizing without initiating, acting only when there is no other choice. Substance and function are both preserved; adaptability and constancy are both complete. Is this not how the sage becomes truly sagely?

Master Guan Yin says: Vast and boundless, he roams the Great Beginning. Now gold, now jade; now dung, now earth. Now soaring with things, now pursuing things; now mountain-like, now abyss-like. Upright or cunning, mad or foolish.

Master Baoyi says: Laozi said: *"I wander in the beginning of things."* Confucius said: *"What does this mean?"* He replied: *"My heart is troubled and cannot know; my mouth gapes and cannot speak. Beginning and end reverse without end, and none know where it leads."* Is this not what is meant by vast and boundless, roaming the Great Beginning?

As for gold within a bell, jade hidden in stone—these are the times of gold and jade. The Dao in tiles and rubble, the Dao in excrement and urine—these are the times of dung and earth. Dwelling like a quail and eating like a rat, moving like a crow without shadow—these are the times of soaring with things. Calling my horse a horse, calling my ox an ox—these are the times of pursuing things.

Still as a stone, withered as a tree—these are the times of mountain things. Like scales submerged, like fish swimming—these are the times of abyssal things.

Are these then all the sage’s proper conduct, all the sage’s adaptive transformations? The greatest sage seems mad, the greatest wisdom seems foolish—yet how could they truly be mad or foolish!

Master Guanyin says: One skilled in the zither, with a sorrowful heart, plays notes that are mournfully desolate; with a longing heart, plays notes that are lingeringly slow; with a resentful heart, plays notes that are windingly plaintive; with an admiring heart, plays notes that are resplendently bright. What we call sorrow, longing, resentment, admiration—these are not of the hand, not of the bamboo, not of the silk, not of the paulownia. They are grasped in the heart, matched by the hand; grasped in the hand, matched by the instrument. Those who possess the Dao never miss the mark.

Master Baoyi says: One skilled in the zither grasps it in the heart and matches it with the hand; grasps it in the hand and matches it with the instrument. Yet even the heart’s sorrow, longing, resentment, admiration suffice to move the silk and paulownia, altering the sound—how much more so the person of the Dao, whose every movement and pause, every turn and rotation, never misses the mark! Would they not move heaven and earth, bring peace to the age and abundance to all things? Long ago, Gengsang Chu attained the Dao of Laozi and dwelt on Mount Weilei. After three years, Weilei flourished greatly—is this not what is meant?

Master Guanyin says: The sage’s words, deeds, and thoughts serve to align with others; their wordlessness, inaction, and thoughtlessness serve to set them apart from others.

Master Baoyi says: The sage speaks all day yet never speaks, acts all day yet never acts, thinks all day yet never thinks—it is only that others cannot fathom or recognize this. How then are they different from others?

Master Guanyin says: The sharper the mind for profit and harm, the less harmony with kin; the sharper the mind for worthy and unworthy, the less fellowship with friends; the sharper the mind for right and wrong, the less success in affairs; the sharper the mind for beauty and ugliness, the less accord with things. Thus the sage blends them all.

Master Baoyi says: When all are clear and discerning while I alone remain dim and muddled, when all are keen and precise while I alone remain dull and confused—this clarity and precision only sharpen the mind for profit and harm, worthy and unworthy, right and wrong, beauty and ugliness. The sharper they grow, the harder it becomes to harmonize with kin, befriend others, succeed in affairs, or accord with things. Only the sage, with a mindless blending, allows profit to be profit, harm to be harm, worthy to be worthy, unworthy to be unworthy, right to be right, wrong to be wrong, beauty to be beauty, ugliness to be ugliness. Thus kin are always harmonious, friends always in fellowship, affairs always successful, things always in accord. What room is there for the sage’s mind to intervene?

Master Guanyin says: The foolish and clumsy of the world rashly invoke the sage’s foolishness and clumsiness to excuse themselves, unaware that the sage is at times foolish, at times wise, at times clumsy, at times skillful.

Master Baoyi says: The sage possesses great skill yet seems clumsy, great wisdom yet seems foolish. The foolish and clumsy of the world rashly invoke the sage to excuse themselves—only to reveal their foolishness all the more, expose their clumsiness all the more. How can this be an excuse?

Master Guanyin says: Those who take the sage as their teacher are worthy; those who take the worthy as their teacher become sages. For those who take the sage as their teacher follow the traces and forget the Dao; those who take the worthy as their teacher return to the traces and unite with the Dao.

Master Baoyi says: The distinction between sage and worthy lies in the traces; the Dao itself has no such distinction. To regard the sage as a sage is already to fall short—this is following the traces and forgetting the Dao. Only by not recognizing them as sages and instead taking the worthy as one’s model can wisdom equal that of the teacher, perhaps forgetting the traces and attaining the Dao. Yet the ancients still said, "When wisdom equals that of the teacher, it is but half the teacher’s virtue." The learner must surpass the teacher’s wisdom to approach true mastery.

Master Guanyin says: The worthy strive upward and do not see below; the common strive downward and do not see above. The sage connects above and below, acting only as is fitting. How can it be said that the sage is separate from the worthy and the common?

Master Baoyi says: Those above the median can be spoken to of higher things, so the worthy strive upward; those below the median cannot be spoken to of higher things, so the common do not see above—both are partial. The sage blends above and below, striving in all directions, seeing all things. Whether among the worthy or the common, all is fitting. Harmonizing light and merging with dust, they differ vastly from the worthy.

Master Guanyin says: In the principles of the world, the male leads, the female follows; the stallion runs, the mare pursues; the rooster crows, the hen responds. Thus the sage governs words and deeds, while the worthy are constrained by them.

Master Baoyi says: The sage’s words fill the world without a single fault; their conduct fills the world without a trace of resentment. Why? They follow the natural principles of things, and in the interplay of ruler and minister, high and low, father and son, elder and younger brother, noble and base, honor and humility, resonance and connection flow from mouth to action. Like the male leading and the female following, the stallion running and the mare pursuing, the rooster crowing and the hen responding—all accord with their natural principles. What room is there for the sage’s mind to intervene? The worthy, however, establish rites and laws to restrain the human heart, and thus cannot but be constrained. They must be cautious of words and deeds, the triggers of honor and disgrace, the subtle signs of good and ill fortune, compliance and defiance. Thus learners must be vigilant in speech and action.

Master Guanyin says: Though the sage’s Dao may transform like a tiger, their conduct moves like a turtle; though the Dao may be as fine as silk, their conduct is as coarse as hempen cloth.

Master Baoyi says: Earlier it was said the sage moves like a dragon, as in the *Book of Changes*’ *Qian* hexagram, which speaks of the "great person soaring like a dragon." Now it speaks of the tiger’s transformation, as in the *Book of Changes*’ *Lin* hexagram, which speaks of the "great person’s tiger-like transformation." The dragon describes the sage’s essence—endlessly changing, soaring and diving beyond measure. The tiger illustrates the sage’s Dao—brilliant with patterns to behold, awe-inspiring with a majesty to fear.

When it comes to practicing the affairs of the sage, even the most ignorant of men and women can do so, walking with the slow, clumsy steps of a turtle—there is nothing lofty or difficult to perform in them. That the Dao is like fine silk while affairs are like coarse cloth means that the Dao appears chaotic and hard to fathom, while affairs proceed in order without confusion.

Master Guanyin says: What is called the sage’s Dao—how is it so solitary, so penetrating, so vast, so replete? Only because it can pair with all things yet no single thing can pair with it does it hold all things in esteem.

Master Baoyi says: The sage’s Dao is like the great void—solitary, with nothing to pair with; penetrating, pervading all without obstruction; vast, filling heaven and earth; replete, beyond the reach of sight or hearing. Only because it can pair with all things yet no single thing can pair with it does it command reverence from all things. As the *Laozi* says: “There is a thing, chaotic yet complete, born before heaven and earth.” How majestic and exalted—does this not describe it?

Master Guanyin says: The rolling and unfolding of clouds, the flight and soaring of birds—all occur within the empty void, and thus their transformations are inexhaustible. The sage’s Dao is likewise.

Master Baoyi says: The sage’s Dao is like clouds in the great void, rolling and unfolding without end; like birds in the vast sky, flying and soaring without limit. Without this void to contain them, the transformations of clouds and birds would be stifled. Without the boundless spirit and formless mystery to animate it, the sage’s transformations would be exhausted.

*Wenshi Zhenjing: Yanwai Zhi*, Scroll Three, concludes.

*Wenshi Zhenjing: Yanwai Zhi*, Scroll Four, by Master Baoyi Chen Xianwei.

**Scroll Four of *Wenshi Zhenjing: Yanwai Zhi***

**Chapter on the Four Symbols**
The *Symbols* refer to essence (*jing*), spirit (*shen*), soul (*hun*), and corporeal soul (*po*). In all, seventeen sections.

Master Guanyin says:
Water may be divided or united, yet essence has no self.
Fire depends on oil or fuel, yet spirit has no I.
Thus, the ear, though blocked before or behind, may still hear—no self.
Wisdom is lofty—no self.
The singular is odd—no self.
Winter’s decay and autumn’s things—no self.
Black cannot be altered—no self.
The North governs longevity—no self.
All these are essence.

The tongue, with teeth and lips, forms speech—no I.
Ritual is humble—no I.
The dual is even—no I.
Summer thrives on spring’s things—no I.
Red may be transformed—no I.
The South governs early death—no I.
All these are spirit.

As essence has no self, when rice is husked, its essence remains.
As spirit has no I, when a ghost clings to an object, its spirit appears.

One who preserves essence forgets right and wrong, forgets gain and loss.
In this, that is not.
One who embraces spirit alternates between obscurity and clarity, strength and weakness.
In that, this is not.

Master Baoyi says:
This speaks of the Way of preserving essence and embracing spirit.
Essence originally has no self, so one must forget right and wrong, forget gain and loss, to preserve the fivefold essence.
Spirit originally has no I, so one must adapt to obscurity and clarity, strength and weakness, to embrace one’s spirit.

Essence is one.
Water may be divided or united—one.
The ear belongs to the kidney; though blocked before or behind, it may still hear—one.
Water is wisdom; wisdom’s loftiness is self-respect—one.
Winter’s things return to the root—one.
Black cannot be altered—one.
The North governs longevity—one.
When rice is husked, its essence remains—one.
One is an odd number, solitary—thus all are said to have no self.

Spirit is two.
Fire depends on oil or fuel—two.
The tongue belongs to the heart; with lips and teeth, it forms speech—two.
Fire is ritual; ritual’s humility honors others—two.
Summer’s things flourish—two.
Red may be transformed—two.
The South governs early death—two.
When a ghost clings to an object, its spirit appears—two.
Two is an even number, paired—thus all are said to have no I.

Without self, that which is here is not there.
Without I, that which is there is not here.
Know this, and you will understand the principle of forgetting right and wrong, gain and loss, and adapting to obscurity and clarity, strength and weakness.

Master Guanyin says:
Essence and spirit are water and fire.
The Five Phases mutually generate and destroy one another, coming without beginning, going without end.
Thus, my essence—a single drop—has no birth or death.
My spirit—a single spark—has no arising or ceasing.
Only without self or other, without beginning or end, can one merge with heaven and earth.

Master Baoyi says:
Essence and spirit are water and fire.
From water arises wood, from wood fire, from fire earth, from earth metal, from metal water—thus they mutually generate.
From fire metal is overcome, from metal wood, from wood earth, from earth water, from water fire—thus they mutually destroy.
Coming without beginning, going without end, destruction gives way to generation, generation to destruction.
Thus, essence has never had a single drop with birth or death; spirit has never had a single spark with arising or ceasing.
Only without self or other, without beginning or end, can one merge with heaven and earth, and spirit and essence endure forever.

Master Guanyin says:
Essence is water, corporeal soul is metal.
Spirit is fire, soul is wood.
Essence governs water, corporeal soul governs metal.
Metal generates water, so essence is stored in corporeal soul.
Spirit governs fire, soul governs wood.
Wood generates fire, so spirit is stored in soul.

Yet fire, as a thing, can melt metal and consume it, can ignite wood and burn it—thus it obscures soul and corporeal soul.

Essence in heaven is cold, on earth is water, in humans is essence.
Spirit in heaven is heat, on earth is fire, in humans is spirit.
Corporeal soul in heaven is dryness, on earth is metal, in humans is corporeal soul.
Soul in heaven is wind, on earth is wood, in humans is soul.

Thus, with my essence, I unite with the essence of heaven, earth, and the myriad things—just as ten thousand waters may merge into one.
With my spirit, I unite with the spirit of heaven, earth, and the myriad things—just as ten thousand fires may merge into one.
With my corporeal soul, I unite with the corporeal soul of heaven, earth, and the myriad things—just as metal, though diverse, may be smelted into one.
With my soul, I unite with the soul of heaven, earth, and the myriad things—just as wood, though different, may be grafted into one.
Then heaven, earth, and the myriad things are all my essence, my spirit, my corporeal soul, my soul.
What is death? What is life?

Master Baoyi says:
Essence (water, one) unites with corporeal soul (metal, four) to form five.
Spirit (fire, two) unites with soul (wood, three) to form five.
Essence stores corporeal soul, and spirit stores soul—thus, though the four things reside in two places, they may be grasped as one five.
Yet the soul (wood) is the dragon, and the corporeal soul (metal) is the tiger.
If the soul is stored in spirit and the corporeal soul in essence, the two things are divided between two places and cannot restrain one another.
Only fire can melt metal and burn wood, so spirit can control soul and corporeal soul.
Yet one must know: spirit dwells in soul as fire clings to wood.
Fire (two) and wood (three) form five, circulating in the northwest, refining essence and tempering corporeal soul, so that the Four Symbols and Five Phases all return to earth—truly relying on the power of spirit-fire.
Thus, in the alchemical method, fire and timing are paramount from beginning to end. Great indeed is the function of fire!

As for uniting the water, fire, metal, and wood of heaven, earth, and the myriad things into one’s own essence, spirit, soul, and corporeal soul—just as ten thousand waters merge into one, ten thousand fires into one, diverse metals into one, and different woods into one—then mountains, rivers, and the great earth are all the wondrous function of my Dharma-body.
Where is there life? Where is there death?

Guan Yinzi said: The movement of the Five Phases arises from essence giving rise to soul, soul to spirit, spirit to intent, intent to corporeal soul, and corporeal soul to essence—these five revolve endlessly. Thus, my illusory heart has flowed and transformed through the workings of creation for countless eons, never reaching an end.

Yet, from a single kernel, sprouts multiply into tens of thousands of trees; though heaven and earth are vast, they cannot sprout a kernel suspended in empty space. From a single hen’s egg, birds multiply into tens of thousands; though yin and yang are wondrous, they cannot hatch an egg from a hen without a rooster. Only when all that comes before me is gathered in a single breath do I transform things into myself, so that nothing is not myself. Then, what can alter the Five Phases?

Baoyizi said: Essence, spirit, soul, corporeal soul, and intent—these five revolve and generate one another endlessly. Thus, the illusory heart of humans cycles through the four modes of birth and the six paths of existence for countless eons, never reaching an end. Why? Because with this illusory heart comes illusory intent; with intent comes corporeal soul; with corporeal soul comes essence; with essence comes soul; with soul comes spirit; and with spirit comes intent again. How then can the kernel in empty space sprout, or the hen without a rooster lay an egg? It is because essence does not abide. Things naturally descend from clarity into turbidity, thus beginning with essence and ending with corporeal soul. Spirit naturally ascends from subtlety into wonder, thus beginning with intent and ending with spirit.

Now, the number of intent is five in earth, and five is born with humans—thus the head, the four limbs, and the fingers of the hands and feet are all five. If one can ultimately reach spirit without intent arising again, then when encountering things and facing circumstances, one gathers them with a single breath, transforming things into oneself. With nothing not being oneself, the Five Phases become the five functions, and the mechanism of mutual generation and destruction ceases. What then can alter them? This is the wondrous function of never cycling through rebirth or receiving life again. Does the scholar wish to know this?

Guan Yinzi said: The multitude take corporeal soul to restrain soul—this is metal in excess and wood insufficient. The sage takes soul to move corporeal soul—this is wood in excess and metal insufficient. Where corporeal soul abides, soul accompanies it; where soul wanders, corporeal soul follows. By day, soul dwells in the eyes, and by night, corporeal soul lodges in the liver. Dwelling in the eyes allows seeing; lodging in the liver allows dreaming. In seeing, soul makes no distinctions—it is the analyzer that distinguishes. To analyze and call it "heaven and earth" is the habit of soul’s cunning. In dreaming, corporeal soul makes no distinctions—it is the analyzer that distinguishes. To analyze and call it "self and other" is the habit of corporeal soul’s cunning.

Earth generates metal, thus intent generates corporeal soul. Where spirit moves, it is not called spirit but intent; where intent moves, it is not called intent but corporeal soul. Only the sage knows that I am not I and things are not things—all arise from the calculations of thought. Therefore, when the myriad things come, I respond to them with nature, not with heart. Nature is the heart before it sprouts. Without heart, there is no intent; without fire, there is no earth; without intent, there is no corporeal soul; and without earth, there is no metal. If one is absent, all five cease. Having merged heaven, earth, and the myriad things into soul, one can then merge heaven, earth, and the myriad things into corporeal soul. All that creation wondrously transforms becomes my soul; all that creation possesses becomes my corporeal soul. Then, there is nothing that can enslave me.

Baoyizi said: My foolish understanding of the previous chapter is this: when things proceed from essence to corporeal soul, descending from clarity into turbidity, corporeal soul waxes strong, and death follows—thus, "metal in excess, wood insufficient." As for the sage, who generates the body from intent and attains spirit, this is "wood in excess, metal insufficient." One whose soul is in excess has many awakenings; one whose corporeal soul is in excess has many dreams. Yet both awakenings and dreams are capable of distinction—not because soul or corporeal soul can analyze themselves, but because true nature abides within, and through long habit, this distinguishing consciousness arises.

Only the sage knows that I am not I and things are not things—all arise from the calculations of heart and intent. Thus, when facing circumstances, one forgets consciousness and has no intent, responding with nature. Nature is the heart before it sprouts. Without heart, there is no intent; if intent does not abide, the Five Phases all cease. Then, all that creation wondrously transforms becomes my soul, and all that creation possesses becomes my corporeal soul. Thus, the myriad things all serve me, and I am not enslaved by things.

Guan Yinzi said: "Ghost" with "cloud" forms *hun* (soul); "ghost" with "white" forms *po* (corporeal soul). In script, this is so. A ghost is what a person becomes after death. "Cloud" is wind, and wind is wood; "white" is qi, and qi is metal. Wind scatters, thus it is light and clear—what is light and clear ascends to heaven. Metal is hard, thus it is heavy and turbid—what is heavy and turbid descends to earth. The light and clear is corporeal soul following soul in ascent; the heavy and turbid is soul following corporeal soul in descent.

Some ascend through benevolence as assistants to Jupiter; some ascend through righteousness as assistants to Venus; some ascend through propriety as assistants to Mars; some ascend through wisdom as assistants to Mercury; some ascend through trustworthiness as assistants to Saturn. Some sink through lack of benevolence, assailed by wood bandits; some sink through lack of righteousness, assailed by metal bandits; some sink through lack of propriety, assailed by fire bandits; some sink through lack of wisdom, assailed by water bandits; some sink through lack of trustworthiness, assailed by earth bandits.

When soul and corporeal soul are evenly divided, they remain among humans. Ascending soul is noble; descending corporeal soul is base. A numinous soul is worthy; a vicious corporeal soul is foolish. A light soul is bright; a heavy corporeal soul is dark. A soaring soul becomes feathered; a dull corporeal soul becomes furred. A luminous soul becomes spirit; a shadowy corporeal soul becomes ghost. Their forms, dwellings, perceptions, and preferences—some versions say "names"—all correspond to the Five Phases. Only because the numbers of the Five Phases vary and are not uniform do the myriad things multiply, filling heaven and earth without end.

The Five Affairs correspond to the Five Phases, and the Five Phases give rise to the Five Creatures—how can one exhaust their discourse? It is like divining with tortoise shells or counting milfoil stalks: when utmost sincerity aligns, the Five Phases respond; if sincerity is lacking, though one divine and count, not a single response comes.

The sage borrows things to traverse the world, and the Five Phases cannot but correspond. *Baoyizi* says: "Cloud-white" is the standard script of today. Standard script emerged when Cheng Miao of Qin transformed seal script into clerical script, yet at that time, the form of characters differed from today’s. The character *yun* (云) was the ancient form of *cloud*; the character *bai* () was the ancient form of *white*. Thus, *gui* (鬼) represents *hun* (魂), and *bai-gui* (鬼) represents *po* (魄)—such was the case in ancient script. The character *feng* (风) derives from *xu* (虚), for its lightness and clarity make it wind; this is the ancient form of *wind*. The character *qi* (皖) derives from *shen* (身), for its heaviness and turbidity make it *qi*—this is the ancient form of *qi*. Thus, the ancients in creating characters may also have followed the Dao.

Wind belongs to Wood, *qi* belongs to Metal. Wood governs ascent, Metal governs descent. Those who ascend through the Five Constants become assistants to the Five Stars; those who sink by violating the Five Constants are assailed by the Five Phases. The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*’s deluded ascent and descent in retribution share this meaning.

When *hun* and *po* are evenly divided, one remains among humans. Yet ordinary people possess only three *hun* and seven *po*. Thus, those with more *hun* are noble, worthy, bright, feathered, and spirit; those with more *po* are base, foolish, dark, furred, and ghost. Their perceptions and preferences—all correspond to the Five Phases. Only because the Five Phases vary and are not uniform do the myriad beings—womb-born, egg-born, moisture-born, transformation-born, with form or without, with thought or without—fill heaven and earth, ceaselessly arising.

Yet the sage is fundamentally without self. Without borrowing things, one cannot traverse the world—just as fire, without wood, has no form to attach to. But how can things in the world endure forever? The sage harnesses the Five Phases to correspond with them, and thus life arises without end. Like water and fire overcoming each other yet forming the hexagram *Jiji* (既济), or Metal and Wood overcoming each other yet forming husband and wife, all are methods of correspondence.

This Dao is like divining with tortoise shells or counting milfoil stalks: when utmost sincerity aligns, the Five Phases respond; if sincerity is lacking, not a single response comes.

*Guanyinzi* says: The Three possess *hun*. *Hun* is consciousness; the eye is essence; color is spirit. That which perceives is *hun*—the ear, mouth, nose, heart, and the like. In this life, love is essence, the root of the father in a future life; observation is spirit, the root of the mother in a future life. Though love and observation differ, consciousness arises, and the root of future life is born. In that future life, one is father, receiving *qi* from the father’s *qi*—Water; one is mother, receiving blood from the mother’s blood—Fire. With father and mother, future life arises.

Only when love is without consciousness, like the coupling of locks, and observation is without consciousness, like the illumination of a lamp, does one’s consciousness remain unarisen—how then can one’s life exist?

*Baoyizi* says: The eye, ear, nose, mouth, and heart are called the Five Roots; sound, color, fragrance, flavor, and touch are called the Five Dusts; seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and thinking are called the Five Consciousnesses. The Five Roots govern essence, which is a thing of self without others. The Five Dusts govern spirit, which perceives without self, manifesting in things. The Five Consciousnesses govern *hun*—thus it is called *hun*-consciousness. Only when the Three—Root, Dust, and Consciousness—are complete does *hun* exist.

The father loves with essence, the mother observes with spirit. Love is Water, observation is Fire; Water is *qi*, Fire is blood. When the father’s essence and mother’s blood unite, consciousness abides within—this is the principle of descending from root to branch, of ceaseless arising. But if love is without consciousness, like the coupling of locks, and observation is without consciousness, like the illumination of a lamp, then one’s consciousness has never arisen—how can one’s life exist?

*Guanyinzi* says: Like striking a drum with a mallet—the drum’s form is my possession, the drum’s sound is my resonance. Though the mallet has departed, the lingering sound remains, yet in the end, it too vanishes. The drum’s form is like my essence, the drum’s sound like my spirit, and the lingering sound like my *hun* and *po*. Knowing that they come and go in an instant, what do I have of the Five Phases’ *qi*?

*Baoyizi* says: Essence is like the drum, spirit like the sound, and the lingering sound like *hun* and *po*—this is certain. Yet if the drum is not struck, no sound arises; if essence is not stirred, no spirit arises. Strike the drum with a mallet, and when the mallet is gone, though lingering sound remains, in the end it vanishes. Stir essence with *qi*, and when *qi* is gone, though *hun* and *po* remain, in the end they vanish. Thus, the Five Phases’ *qi* comes and goes in an instant—I fundamentally possess nothing. What I do possess is only the mallet that strikes and the *qi* that stirs.

Someone asked: If one wishes the sound to never cease and the drum to endure forever, by what method can this be achieved? The master replied: Please set down the mallet in your hand, and I will tell you.

*Guanyinzi* says: For a fruit to have a pit, it must await the presence of Water, Fire, and Earth—only then can it arise without end. If the Three are incomplete, like great drought, great flood, or great clod, none can give rise to beings. Essence (Water), spirit (Fire), and intent (Earth)—these Three do not originally unite. Only when humans use their roots to combine them can affairs arise within. It is like the art of *shushu*, which can reveal many affairs within perfect emptiness.

*Baoyizi* says: The adepts of the world can perceive many affairs within emptiness—like Zhang Liang creating a five-mile fog or Zuo Ci tossing a cup onto a beam. This Dao emerges from nothing other than the Three: spirit, essence, and intent. When united, they act like a fruit’s pit, which awaits Water, Fire, and Earth to arise. If the Three do not unite, it is like great drought, great flood, or great clod—none can give rise to beings.

Yet these Three cannot unite of themselves—only humans, through their root, combine them. It is like the two roots of male and female uniting in essence to give birth to form. However, Heaven has its Heaven-root, Earth its Earth-root, humans their human-root, and the workings of creation possess their own root of creation. If one can rise upon the root of creation to awaken the roots of Heaven and Earth, one may generate being from non-being and comprehend the Dao of transformation.

*Guanyinzi* says: The hun-soul is Wood. Wood’s root lies in winter’s Water, yet it blossoms in summer’s Fire. Thus, a person’s hun-soul is stored in night’s essence and appears in day’s spirit. When united with essence, what it sees is uniquely its own—for before there was essence, there was no person. When united with spirit, what it sees is shared with others—for before there was spirit, there was no self.

*Baoyizi* says: This chapter speaks solely in terms of Wood to elucidate the meaning of "root" from the previous chapter. For Wood becomes the hun-soul and the person. What makes a person human is nothing more than the hun-soul’s awareness, which hides and appears within essence and spirit. Essence is one, so when the hun-soul unites with essence, what it sees is only its own self. Spirit is two, so when the hun-soul unites with spirit, what it sees is shared with others. Just as Wood’s root lies in winter yet flourishes in summer, so too does the hun-soul hide in night and appear in day. Know the root of Wood, and you know the root of the hun-soul. Know the root of the hun-soul, and you know the root of Heaven, Earth, and creation.

*Guanyinzi* says: One who knows this body is like a body in a dream, shaped by what the mind perceives, may soar in spirit as the self and wander the Great Clarity. One who knows this thing is like a thing in a dream, shaped by what the mind perceives, may condense essence into things and ride the Eight Wastes. This is the Dao: to perceive spirit and essence is to attain long life; to forget spirit and essence is to transcend life.

Inhale qi to nourish essence, like Metal giving rise to Water. Inhale wind to nourish spirit, like Wood giving rise to Fire. Thus, one borrows from without to extend spirit and essence. Rinse with water to nourish essence, for essence is inexhaustible. Rub with fire to nourish spirit, for spirit is inexhaustible. Thus, one borrows from within to extend spirit and essence.

As for those who forget spirit and essence to transcend life, I have spoken of this before.

*Baoyizi* says: Humans rely on spirit and essence for life. Those who skillfully nourish spirit and essence may perceive them and attain long life—*The Scripture of Yin Convergence* says, "Heaven has five thieves; those who perceive them prosper." Those who forget spirit and essence to transcend life—*The Scripture of Yin Convergence* says, "People know the spirit as spirit, yet do not know the non-spirit as the source of spirit."

There are those who dream of soaring in spirit to wander the Great Clarity, and those who dream of riding things to traverse the Eight Wastes. This body, this thing—all are like dreams, like illusions. Those who can do this in dreams are more numinous than spirit; those who cannot while awake are bound by form. Only those who can perceive their own spirit and essence may unite waking and dreaming, soar in spirit as the self, or condense essence into things. These are all wondrous applications of the Dao.

As for inhaling qi and wind to augment Metal and Wood externally, or rinsing with water and rubbing with fire to nourish spirit and essence internally—these too may extend spirit and essence. Yet these are but coarse practices. As for forgetting spirit and essence to transcend life—that is the Dao. This Dao lies hidden and subtle within this text; it rests with each person to attain it for themselves.

*Guanyinzi* says: One who is diligent in ritual keeps spirit from scattering outward and may gather spirit. One who is diligent in wisdom keeps essence from drifting outward and may refine essence. Benevolence is yang and luminous—it may lighten the hun-soul. Righteousness is yin and obscure—it may govern the po-soul.

*Baoyizi* says: The sage established the Five Constants based on what is inherently present in the human heart, all arising naturally, without force—hence they are called "constants." One who follows these constants in practice may gather spirit, refine essence, lighten the hun-soul, and govern the po-soul. For the human’s five spirits preside over these Five Constants, just as Heaven’s five stars preside over these five affairs.

Mars governs ritual, and ritual governs ascent—Fire too ascends. Spirit pertains to Fire. One who is diligent in ritual keeps spirit from scattering outward and may gather spirit. The rest follow likewise: Jupiter governs benevolence, Venus governs righteousness, Mercury governs wisdom. Wood is light, Metal is obscure, Water descends—thus they may lighten the hun-soul, govern the po-soul, and refine essence. All are so. Here only four are mentioned, but when the four things are complete, Earth is within them; when the four constants are complete, trustworthiness is within them; when the four spirits are complete, intent is within them; when the four directions are established, the center is within them. *Mencius* likewise speaks only of the four beginnings without mentioning trustworthiness—its meaning is the same.

*Guanyinzi* says: The mantis rolls a pellet, and when the pellet is formed, it concentrates its thoughts upon it. A white midge then appears within the pellet. Soon, it sheds its husk and becomes a cicada. If the mantis did not concentrate its thoughts, how would the midge have appeared?

*Baoyizi* says: This chapter speaks of the mechanism of resonance, which can move even insentient things. The pellet is originally insentient, yet the mantis rolls it and concentrates its thoughts upon it—then a midge is born within the pellet. Soon, it sheds its husk and transforms into a cicada. The external elixir of golden cinnabar is born within the golden crucible and spirit chamber. The spirit chamber is but an empty vessel, wholly dependent on the crucible-keeper’s unwavering awareness, who day and night observes with focused essence—then the divine elixir is born within the empty vessel. Once the external elixir is ripe, the internal elixir is also complete, and one transforms into an immortal. *The Kinship of the Three* says: "Myriad images arise from emptiness; resonance and transformation each have their kind." This resonance is akin to the mantis concentrating its thoughts.

*Guanyinzi* says: A cook stewed a mantis, leaving one leg upon the table. Though the mantis had already been stewed, the leg still twitched. Life and death are but the gathering and scattering of a single qi. There is no birth, no death—yet people arbitrarily calculate them as birth and death.

Bao Yizi says: People regard animals as possessing life, yet when the tadpole in the pot has already been stewed, the severed leg left upon the table still twitches. Thus, what lives is but the gathering of a single qi, and what dies is but the scattering of that same qi. As for that which is not qi, when has it ever known gathering or scattering, birth or death? It is merely people who arbitrarily impose such distinctions.

Guanyinzi says: There are those who die standing, those who die sitting, those who die lying down, those who die of illness, and those who die from medicine—all deaths are equal, without distinction of rank or grade. The one who understands the Dao, however, perceives no birth and thus perceives no death.

Bao Yizi says: The world does not know that I am originally without birth, yet when they see one who departs while sitting or perishes while standing, they deem it enlightenment, while those who die from illness or external causes they consider unenlightened. They do not realize that all deaths are the same, without distinction of rank or grade. Only the one who understands the Dao has never known birth and thus does not perceive birth, has never known death and thus does not perceive death.

Guanyinzi says: Those who loathe birth and death and seek to transcend them are all afflicted with grave delusion. It is like a transformed being—if it harbors thoughts of loathing or transcending birth and death, it is called a demon, not one who walks the Dao.

Bao Yizi says: Laozi spoke of concentrating qi to attain suppleness, becoming like an infant. Now, if you ask an infant, *"Are you alive?"* it does not know. *"Are you dead?"* It does not know. Thus, for one to harbor thoughts of loathing birth and death—is this not a great folly? To seek to transcend them—is this not demonic?

Guanyinzi says: Those who calculate birth and death say either that death already exists, or that it ceases to exist, or that it both exists and does not exist, or that it neither exists nor does not exist. Some say one should rejoice in it, some say fear it, some say accept it, some say transcend it—endlessly shifting their emotions and perceptions, ever chasing after illusions. They do not realize that my birth and death are like a horse’s hand or an ox’s wing: fundamentally non-existent, yet not even non-existent. It is like fire and water—though one may encounter them, they cannot burn or drown one.

Bao Yizi says: Just as a horse has no hand and an ox has no wing, so too have I never known birth or death. Just as water encounters water or fire encounters fire, so too do I enter birth and death. Yet if it is said that, like the horse’s hand or ox’s wing, birth and death have never existed, then what is there to enter? It is by never having known birth that one enters death, and by never having known death that one enters life. Thus, entering is no entering, and encountering is no encounter. As for those who claim it may exist or not exist, that one should rejoice or fear, accept or transcend—endlessly shifting their emotions and perceptions—they stray ever farther from the truth. How could they possibly understand this?

*The Outer Teachings of the Wenshi Zhenjing, Scroll Four, Concludes*

*The Outer Teachings of the Wenshi Zhenjing, Scroll Five*
*Recorded by Bao Yizi, Chen Xianwei*

**Scroll Five of the Outer Teachings of the Wenshi Zhenjing**

**Chapter of the Five Mirrors**
A mirror is the heart; this chapter contains twenty sections.

Master Guan Yin says:
When the heart is obscured by fortune and misfortune, spectral ghosts seize it.
When the heart is obscured by lust between man and woman, lewd ghosts seize it.
When the heart is obscured by hidden sorrow, drowning ghosts seize it.
When the heart is obscured by reckless abandon, mad ghosts seize it.
When the heart is obscured by oaths and curses, uncanny ghosts seize it.
When the heart is obscured by medicines and elixirs, material ghosts seize it.

Such ghosts may take yin as their body,
or darkness as their body,
or wind as their body,
or qi as their body,
or clay effigies as their body,
or painted images as their body,
or aged beasts as their body,
or broken vessels as their body.

They invest their essence, and one invests one’s own essence;
when the two essences contend, the spirit responds.
Those seized by ghosts may comprehend strange affairs,
or understand marvelous events,
or interpret auspicious signs.
Such a person grows arrogant,
claiming not that ghosts possess them,
but that the Dao possesses them.
In time, they may die by wood,
or die by metal,
or die by rope,
or die by well.

Only the sage can spirit the spirits
yet not be spirited by spirits,
commanding the myriad spirits while grasping their mechanism.
One may gather them,
may scatter them,
may master them.
Responding to the ten thousand things daily,
the heart remains still.

Master Bao Yi says:
The sage can spirit the spirits
yet not be spirited by spirits.
The common people are spirited by spirits
yet cannot spirit the spirits.
Those who can spirit the spirits
respond to the ten thousand things daily,
their hearts still.
Those spirited by spirits
have hearts obscured by affairs,
and are seized by ghosts.

Ghosts are also spirits of pure yin,
thus they have no self but cling to material forms.
Once one mistakes material forms for one’s own body,
essence abides in the object,
and when object and self contend, the spirit responds.
Thus, those seized by ghosts
may perform auspicious wonders
or know fortune and misfortune.
Such a person grows arrogant,
believing they have attained the Dao,
unaware that demonic possession will eventually destroy their body.
The five phases will devour them,
and they will die according to their kind—
by wood, metal, rope, or well—
just as the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* describes the twenty-five delusions.
This is the same teaching.

In the late Zhou dynasty,
before Buddhism entered China,
this book had already expounded it.
Compared to the Buddhist scriptures,
its principles are more detailed and its words more concise.
How could the *Guan Yinzi* be fathomed by those of limited understanding?

Master Guan Yin says:
Without the one heart, the five senses race in all directions.
The heart cannot be made one.
Without the empty heart, the five phases are all present.
The heart cannot be made empty.
Without the still heart, the myriad transformations shift imperceptibly.
The heart cannot be made still.

If one forces it to be one, duality arises.
If one forces it to be empty, it becomes full.
If one forces it to be still, it moves.
Only the sage can gather the ten thousand existences into a single breath,
so that not one thing can enslave their clarity.
They can scatter a single breath into the ten thousand existences,
so that not one thing can inquire into their actions.

Master Bao Yi says:
The sage’s heart can gather and scatter.
When gathering, they unite the ten thousand existences in a single breath.
When scattering, they disperse a single breath into the ten thousand existences.
They do not wait to be one, empty, or still.
If one strives for oneness, it is no longer one.
If one strives for emptiness, it is no longer empty.
If one strives for stillness, it is no longer still.
Only by not striving for oneness,
not striving for emptiness,
not striving for stillness,
does this heart remain undivided,
unfilled,
unmoved.
Though it gathers and scatters daily,
when has it ever gathered or scattered?
Thus, responding to the ten thousand changes,
the heart remains still.
Not one thing can enslave their clarity,
not one thing can inquire into their actions.
The sage illuminates the heart with the five mirrors—
truly, it is a mirror.

Master Guan Yin says:
Fire may burn for a thousand years,
yet in an instant it can be extinguished.
Consciousness may persist for a thousand years,
yet in an instant it can be cast aside.

Master Bao Yi says:
Fire has no self;
it arises from the division of purity and turbidity.
The world has never known fire that generates itself.
It must rely on human effort—
drilling wood or striking stone—
to come into being.
As *Liezi* says: "Humans give birth to fire."
Fire has no inherent form,
so though it may blaze for a thousand years,
in a moment it can be extinguished.
Consciousness is the same.
It arises from the embryo’s endowment of form,
for this heart does not originally possess consciousness.
It is born from the interaction of faculties and objects,
from habit and reception.
As *Guan Yinzi* says: "When things interact with the heart, consciousness is born."
Consciousness has no fixed direction,
so though it may persist for a thousand years,
in a moment it can be cast aside.
Thus, extinguishing fire is easy,
but preventing its rekindling is difficult.
Casting aside consciousness is easy,
but preventing its continuation is difficult.
As the *Book of Documents* says:
"Attaining the Dao is easy; preserving it is hard."
How true!

Master Guan Yin says:
That which flows is the boat,
but what causes it to flow is the water, not the boat.
That which moves is the cart,
but what causes it to move is the ox, not the cart.
That which thinks is the heart,
but what causes it to think is intention, not the heart.
Only by not knowing why it is so, yet it is so,
can its coming have no source,
its going no place.
Its coming has no source,
its going no place,
thus it can unite with the original source of heaven and earth,
neither ancient nor modern.

Master Bao Yi says:
The heart is fire,
intention is earth,
thought is also earth.
Thus, what causes thinking is intention, not the heart—
just as a boat flows because of water,
a cart moves because of an ox,
and the heart thinks because of intention.
The ancients said:
"If the cart does not move, strike the cart—it is so.
Strike the ox—it is so."
Now, when the heart is enslaved by thought,
to abandon the heart is so,
to abandon intention is so.
The sages of the Three Teachings all advocate the absence of intention,
but not the absence of the heart—
there is profound meaning in this.
When scholars engage in thought,
they should trace the origin of intention.
Then they will not know why it is so, yet it is so.
Thus, its coming has no source,
its going no place.

Thus, intention never truly intends, and if intention never truly intends, then thought never truly thinks, and念 never truly念s. Yet this thought without thought, this 念 without 念, aligns with the primordial origin of Heaven and Earth—neither ancient nor modern—and endures eternally. This differs from those who sever thought and cut off 念, rendering the heart like dead wood.

Master Guan Yin says:
Know that the heart is without things, and you will know that things are without things. Know that things are without things, and you will know that the Dao is without things. Knowing that the Dao is without things, one neither venerates actions of transcendent excellence nor marvels at words of subtle wonder.

Master Bao Yi says:
The ancients had a saying: "If you claim another is a sage, you yourself become mad." To revere actions of transcendent excellence when you encounter them, to be astonished by words of subtle wonder when you hear them—this is to cling to traces without perceiving the Dao. For the Dao has no past or present, no sage or madman, no words or deeds. Before it, there are no forerunners; after it, no successors. Knowing this, what then is a thing, and what is the heart?

Master Guan Yin says:
When things and self intersect, the heart arises—just as when two pieces of wood rub together, fire is born. One cannot say it is in me, nor in the other; one cannot say it is not me, nor not the other. To grasp and divide it into self and other is foolishness.

Master Bao Yi says:
The heart is fire, and fire is dual. Thus, the heart arises only when things and self intersect, just as fire arises only when two pieces of wood rub together. Those who cling to the notion that the heart resides in me or in the other, or that fire resides in this or that—even those who claim it is neither me nor the other—are all fools. How could they comprehend the heart?

Master Guan Yin says:
Do not rely on what you call profit and harm, right and wrong. Do those things you call profit and harm, right and wrong truly attain profit and harm, right and wrong? The sage moves without knowing or perceiving—how much more so for you?

Master Bao Yi says:
The more clearly one discerns profit and harm, the less harmony there is among kin. The more clearly one discerns right and wrong, the less affairs come to fruition. The sage moves without knowing or perceiving—how much more so for you? Do those things you call profit and harm, right and wrong truly attain profit and harm?

Master Guan Yin says:
In the dreams of the night, some last longer than the night itself. The heart has no fixed time. Those born in Qi see only the state of Qi in their hearts. Later, when they travel to Song, to Chu, to Jin, to Liang, what the heart holds differs each time. The heart has no fixed direction.

Master Bao Yi says:
In the dream of Deng Zheng, a lifetime of glory and disgrace passed—how many winters and summers went by? Yet upon waking, the millet was still uncooked, a mere moment had elapsed. Does the heart have a fixed time? A child of Chu, raised in the state of Chu, if taken and placed among the markets of Zhuang and Yue, after several years—even if beaten daily to make him speak Chu—it would be impossible. Does the heart have a fixed direction? Those who cling to time or direction to seek the heart—how could they comprehend the heart?

Master Guan Yin says:
A skilled archer learns from the bow, not from Yi. A skilled boatman learns from the boat, not from Guo. A skilled heart learns from the heart, not from the sages.

Master Bao Yi says:
The marvel of Wheelwright Bian’s crafting of wheels cannot be passed from father to son. It is grasped by the heart and expressed by the hand—how could it be transmitted by a teacher? Yet when Feng Meng learned archery from Yi, did he exhaust Yi’s Way? If he had exhausted Yi’s Way, he would not have thought that in all the world, only Yi surpassed him. Those who study the sages, believing they have exhausted the sages’ Way, are like a rat drinking from a river—just enough to fill its measure. Now, the skilled archer learns from the bow, the skilled boatman from the boat. By analogy, the skilled heart learns from the heart—this is a fine analogy. The bow has arrows, targets, and draw weight to learn from; the boat has sails, oars, wind, and water to follow. But when the heart is bright, it awakens; when it is dull, it merely exists. From whom could one learn? Nevertheless, when scholars, in their activity and stillness, speech and silence, find even a thread of clarity amid confusion, then the heart’s method has more than enough teachers.

Master Guan Yin says:
Right and wrong, beauty and ugliness, success and failure, fullness and emptiness—the Creator moves them all. They arise from clinging to private knowledge. Thus, even when you dispel them with non-being, they remain; even when you dispel them with neither being nor non-being, they remain. Some call it the "dim and dark," some the "chaotic and indistinct"—yet they remain. It is like returning to a place once visited: the memories are vivid. This cannot be forgotten, cannot be dispelled. The wise transform knowledge into wisdom. Do you understand this transformation of knowledge into wisdom?

He says:
Imagining ghosts makes the heart tremble; imagining thieves makes the heart vigilant. Knowledge is like mistaking millet for sorghum, jade for stone—floating, formless, without foundation. Seeing a strange object gives rise to strange thoughts, strange knowledge. These thoughts, this knowledge, do not originate in me. It is like today: only today exists. As for tomorrow—who can predict its trials? Yet when tomorrow comes, the myriad recognitions arise, all born of what has come before. Thoughts and knowledge are like a rhinoceros gazing at the moon: the moon’s form enters its horn. It is only because knowledge arises that the moon’s form appears. Yet the true moon was never in the horn. The myriad things of Heaven and Earth within the breast are the same. One who understands this teaching sees nothing outside, feels no emotion within.

Master Bao Yi says:
The myriad things of Heaven and Earth, the myriad affairs of past and present—all reside in the human breast like the moon’s form appearing in the rhinoceros’s horn. If the rhinoceros does not gaze at the moon and imagine it, the moon’s form would never arise in the horn. Once the moon’s form exists in the horn, the entire shape of the rhinoceros cannot be removed. By analogy, the myriad things and affairs in the human breast cannot be forgotten, cannot be dispelled. Like the scenes of a place once visited, when you return, the memories are vivid—all the work of knowledge.

Moreover, consider how today one sees a certain thing or affair, yet what will be seen tomorrow remains entirely unpredictable. When tomorrow arrives, the myriad thoughts and perceptions all arise anew. But before tomorrow comes, before things and affairs exist, where do these thoughts and perceptions have their root? Thus, it is clear that today’s thoughts and perceptions are all delusive thoughts and delusive perceptions.

It is like imagining ghosts where there are none, or thieves where there are none—these are delusive thoughts, yet they give rise to delusive emotions of fear and dread. Or mistaking millet for sorghum, or jade for stone—these are delusive recognitions, yet they produce delusive perceptions of true sorghum or true stone. In this way, seeing rare objects or witnessing strange affairs differs not at all from delusive emotions and delusive perceptions. To grasp and possess them within the treasury of the mind is truly unwise. Understanding this, one grasps the teaching of transforming perception into wisdom. When perception is transformed into wisdom, nothing is seen outside, and no emotion arises within.

Master Guan Yin says:
Things arise from earth and ultimately return to earth; affairs arise from intent and ultimately return to intent. Know only intent, and in an instant it affirms, in an instant it denies, in an instant it deems good, in an instant it deems evil. Intent changes, but the mind does not change; intent awakens, but the mind does not awaken. Only in my singular mind does intent become but dust passing to and fro, and affairs become but shadows rising and vanishing. My mind abides in the Great Constancy.

Master Bao Yi says:
Perception arises from intent, and intent arises from the mind. To well dispel perception, one must dispel the mother that gives birth to it. It is like things arising from earth and ultimately returning to earth; perception arises from intent and ultimately returns to intent. The right and wrong, good and evil of affairs, though distinguished by perception, all change according to intent. When intent is in right or wrong, perception follows accordingly; when intent is in good or evil, perception follows accordingly—like a child turning with its mother. Yet though intent may change, the mind never changes; though intent may awaken, the mind never awakens. Knowing that the mind is without change and without awakening, then intent is but dust passing to and fro, and affairs are but shadows rising and vanishing—none can move the lord of my mind. My mind is singular, for the Great Constancy abides therein.

Master Guan Yin says:
Emotion arises from the mind, and the mind arises from nature. Emotion is the wave, the mind is the current, and nature is the water. What comes to assail me is like the flash of flint—if received by nature, the mind does not arise, and things float lightly away.

Master Bao Yi says:
Later generations who speak of nature all say that nature arises from the mind, taking the mind as mother and nature as child. They claim, for instance, that the nature of the Five Constants is rooted in the singular mind. Yet they have not penetrated the true nature of nature. The sages of the Three Teachings expound the true suchness of nature with one voice, but worthies cling to their views—is this not why they have not entered the realm of sageliness?

Confucius spoke of exhausting principle and then fully realizing nature. Principle is the mind, and this aligns with Mencius’ words: “Fully realize your mind, and you know your nature; know your nature, and you know Heaven.” It is the same as the Buddhist teaching of illuminating the mind and then seeing nature—“directly pointing to the human mind, seeing nature and attaining Buddhahood.” Thus, the present teaching that the mind arises from nature takes nature as mother and the mind as child. Yet fearing that learners may not understand, it further illustrates with the metaphor of water: nature is water, the mind is the current, and emotion is the wave. The sequence of root and branch is thus clearly distinguished.

If affairs and things come to assail me and I respond with the mind, is this not laborious? The affairs and things of the world are boundless, while the spirit of my mind is limited. To oppose the boundless with the limited is to exhaust my mind. Only the sage receives them with nature, so that the mind does not arise, and affairs and things float lightly away, unable to enter the numinous treasury of my mind.

Master Guan Yin says:
Wise and foolish, true and false—some recognize them, some do not. Though there are indeed wise and foolish, true and false, to call them wise or foolish, true or false depends on my perception. Knowing that all are formed by perception, even what is true is rendered false.

Master Bao Yi says:
People deem the wise worthy of admiration and reverence, while the foolish are neither admired nor revered. True affairs and things are easily noticed but hard to remember, while false ones are not much attended to yet easily forgotten. Yet to call them wise or foolish, true or false is all the work of my discriminating perception. If one knows the nature of perception, then even the wise are deemed foolish, and even the true are deemed false—thus transforming perception into wisdom and making all easily forgotten.

Master Guan Yin says:
When the mind is stirred by things, it does not give rise to mind but to emotion; when things interact with the mind, they do not give rise to things but to perception. Things are not even real—how much less perception? Perception is not even real—how much less emotion? Yet deluded people, in the midst of utter nothingness, cling to it as something, and in the midst of utter change, cling to it as constant. One delusive recognition accumulates into myriad emotions, and myriad emotions accumulate into myriad things. Things come without end, but my mind has its limits. Thus, my good mind is controlled by emotion, and my original emotion is controlled by things. They can be made to depart, they can be made to arrive, yet their coming and going are not originally mine. Creation enslaves them, and there is no rest.

Yet they do not know that though Heaven and Earth are vast, they can enslave the formed but cannot enslave the formless; though yin and yang are subtle, they can enslave the qi-endowed but cannot enslave the qi-less. Where the mind goes, qi follows; where qi goes, form responds. It is like the Great Void, which within a single qi transforms into the myriad things, yet that single qi is not called the Great Void. My singular mind can transform into qi and form, yet my mind is without qi and without form. Knowing that my singular mind is without qi and without form, then Heaven and Earth and yin and yang cannot enslave it.

Bao Yi Zi said: Though Heaven and Earth are vast and yin and yang are subtle, they can enslave the formed and qi-endowed but cannot enslave the formless and qi-less. Yet my singular mind is without form and without qi—Heaven and Earth and yin and yang cannot enslave it, so why does it instead submit to emotions and become enslaved by things? From utter nothingness, one clings to it as something; from utter transformation, one clings to it as constant. Through perception, emotions arise; through emotions, one becomes attached to things. Things come endlessly, creation knows no constancy, and one is made to depart and made to arrive, unable to attain freedom.

Some say: My singular mind can transform into qi and form. Once it becomes qi, once it becomes form, it is enslaved by the Five Phases, bound by yin and yang, subject to waxing and waning, coming and going—none of this is originally mine. Creation enslaves it; how can it be free? Alas! It is like a painter or sculptor who conjures images of ghosts and spirits, then grows terrified of his own creations. Little does he know that my singular mind is originally one with the Great Void. The Great Void transforms the myriad things within a single qi, yet that single qi is not called the Great Void. The deluded simply name that single qi the Great Void—how can they escape the enslavement of Heaven and Earth and yin and yang?

Guan Yin Zi said: When a person in ordinary health suddenly sees extraordinary things, it is always because essence has congealed to make it so. When a person is ill and suddenly sees extraordinary things, it is always because the mind harbors some deficiency to make it so.

If my mind can manifest something from nothing, then know that my mind can also manifest nothing from something. But if one does not believe this, it naturally loses its numinosity.

Someone asked: When perception is already clouded, who can avoid belief?

I replied: Like the snake-catcher whose mind does not fear snakes, though he dreams of serpents, he feels no terror. Thus the Yellow Emperor said: The Dao has no ghosts or spirits; it comes and goes alone.

Bao Yi Zi said: Straining the eyes and exerting effort, over time essence congeals, so one suddenly sees extraordinary things—no different from the sick who see flowers in the air or a second moon. Or when the mind harbors resentment and suddenly sees the forms of old grievances, these are all manifestations of something from nothing. Once seen, who can avoid belief? Like the snake-catcher who, though dreaming of snakes, feels no fear—it is because habit has become like nature. Once there was a man dwelling in the mountains to cultivate stillness. Mountain spirits appeared in monstrous forms, transforming in a hundred ways to disturb him. The man closed his eyes and did not look, saying: Your tricks have limits, but my not hearing and not seeing are boundless. The mountain spirits retreated and were seen no more. This is manifesting nothing from something—only by not believing does it naturally lose its numinosity.

As for those who see within their own minds the myriad things—infants, maidens, green dragons, white tigers, and the like—these are all self-created. Being and nonbeing lie within me, unlike the sudden appearance of extraordinary things. Yet even when the sage witnesses this, he sees as if not seeing. Why? As the Yellow Emperor said: The Dao has no ghosts or spirits; it comes and goes alone.

Guan Yin Zi said: My thoughts and concerns change daily, driven by something not myself—by fate. If one knows it is only fate, outwardly one does not see the self, inwardly one does not see the mind.

Bao Yi Zi said: A person’s thoughts and concerns differ day by day, arising without cause—what drives them? Fate. Since it is called fate, does it come from me or not from me? If my fate lies in Heaven, then thoughts do not come from me. If my fate lies within me, then why think or worry? Thus outwardly one does not see the self, inwardly one does not see the mind.

Guan Yin Zi said: It is like two eyes that can see the myriad things of Heaven and Earth. If one briefly turns the light inward, all is unseen for a time.

Bao Yi Zi said: This passage should be joined with the previous one. It means: People have thoughts and concerns like two eyes that can see the myriad things of Heaven and Earth. If one can turn the light back to illuminate, then the myriad things of Heaven and Earth are unseen for a time. In that case, why think or worry? But few in the world know this mechanism.

Guan Yin Zi said: The eye that gazes at carvings injures its clarity; the ear that hears intricate sounds injures its acuity; the mind that ponders mysteries injures its essence.

Bao Yi Zi said: This passage also connects to the one above. It means: The eye that cannot turn inward to reflect but only gazes injures its clarity through carvings; the ear that cannot turn inward to listen but only hears injures its acuity through intricate sounds; the mind that cannot be free of thoughts but only ponders injures its essence through mysteries. These three passages form a continuous whole, and their meaning is only complete when taken together.

Guan Yin Zi said: Do not measure others by your own mind; rather, measure others by their own minds. One who understands this teaching can manage affairs, practice virtue, penetrate the Dao, and associate with others—one version says: *can establish others and forget the self.*

Bao Yi Zi said: If one measures others by one’s own mind, then people’s perceptions and views differ. Once self and others are divided, how can one manage affairs? If affairs cannot be managed, how much less can one associate with others, practice virtue, or penetrate the Dao? Only by measuring others by their own minds does one practice the sage’s teaching of no-self. In this way, what affair cannot be managed? What person cannot be associated with? What virtue cannot be practiced? What Dao cannot be penetrated?

Guan Yin Zi said: The principles of the world begin with the small that is not controlled, leading to the great; the great that is not controlled leads to the uncontrollable. Thus, one who can control a single emotion can perfect virtue; one who can forget a single emotion can align with the Dao.

Bao Yi Zi said: Scholars only know to guard against and cease what is subtle, but do not know to control emotions when they are subtle. If one can control a single emotion, one can perfect virtue; if one can forget a single emotion, one can align with the Dao. Thus virtue is not difficult to perfect, and the Dao is not difficult to align with—it is only that emotions are difficult to control.

A single emotion, though subtle, if left uncontrolled, will branch into greater ones; if the great remain uncontrolled, they become uncontrollable—how can the harm they wreak be fully described? The principles of the world are all thus.

*Wenshi Zhenjing: External Implications, Scroll Six*
*Recorded by Bao Yi Zi, Chen Xianwei*

The *Bi* chapters—*Bi* means "nourishment," and nourishment pertains to form. In all, sixteen chapters.

Guan Yin Zi said: People of the world distinguish between "my thoughts" and "their thoughts," "my pain" and "their pain," thus dividing self and other. Yet in dreams, one also distinguishes "my thoughts" from "their thoughts," "my pain" from "their pain"—which is the true self, and which the other? Nails and hair do not feel pain; hands and feet do not think—yet they too are part of the self. How can one separate them by thought or pain?

People of the world deem solitary visions dreams and shared visions wakefulness. Yet when essence congeals, even one person may see alone by day; when spirit harmonizes, even two may share a dream by night. Both arise from my spirit—so which is dream, and which wakefulness?

People of the world deem fleeting visions dreams and lasting visions wakefulness. Yet both the fleeting and the lasting are but the qi of yin and yang—both are my yin and yang. So which is dream, and which wakefulness?

Bao Yi Zi said: There was once a man who sought the self without recognizing it. He sought it in form, but found it not; in sound, but found it not; in scent, taste, touch, and thought—yet still it eluded him. Only then did he realize that what he had grasped as the self—what could not be seen, heard, or seized—was all delusion. How could he know the true self?

Now, people of the world take what can think and feel pain as the self, and what cannot think or feel pain as not the self—both are mistaken. Is what can think and feel pain truly the self? The self is originally without intention or thought—whence comes thinking? It is but delusion, conditioned by the senses, accumulating habits and attachments to form thoughts—this is not the self’s true thought. The self is originally without form or substance—whence comes pain? It is but delusion, the false union of blood and qi, where contact gives rise to sensation—this is not the self’s true pain.

Then is what cannot think or feel pain truly not the self? Nails and hair do not feel pain; hands and feet do not think—yet they too are the self. The heavens, earth, and the myriad things in a dream do not think; the people, spirits, birds, and beasts in a dream do not feel pain—yet they too are the self. How can one divide self and other thus?

People of the world deem solitary and fleeting visions dreams, and shared and lasting visions wakefulness—both are mistaken. Are solitary and fleeting visions truly dreams? The self is originally without dreams. Yet through yin, night, and sleep, it interacts with perception to produce dreams. The self is originally without wakefulness. Yet through yang, day, and waking, it interacts with sight to produce wakefulness.

Then are shared and lasting visions truly not dreams? When spirit harmonizes, even two may share a dream by night. When yin and yang form habits, even the heavens, earth, and the myriad things may persist in a dream. How can one divide dream and wakefulness thus?

When self and other are not distinct, and dream and wakefulness are not separate, one realizes that throughout the vast emptiness of the world, in the heavens, earth, and all beings, there is not a single thing that is not the self’s truth—yet not a single thing is the self’s possession.

Guan Yin Zi said: Those who favor benevolence often dream of pines, wutong, peaches, and plums; those who favor righteousness, of weapons, blades, gold, and iron; those who favor propriety, of baskets, sacrificial vessels, and ritual implements; those who favor wisdom, of rivers, lakes, streams, and marshes; those who favor trustworthiness, of mountains, peaks, and plains. All are bound by the five phases—there is no exception. Yet in dreams, if one hears or thinks of something else, the dream shifts accordingly—the five phases cannot be rigidly confined.

The sage governs things with the heart and restrains the heart with nature, so the heart aligns with creation—the five phases also cannot be rigidly confined.

Bao Yi Zi said: People cannot escape yin and yang or the five phases because their hearts are entangled in thoughts, enslaved by affairs and things. As the saying goes, "There is no greater bandit than yin and yang—nowhere between heaven and earth can one escape them." And again, "The five thieves reside in the heart, acting throughout the heavens." Thus, the five thieves arise from yin and yang, and people’s thoughts, once attached to affairs or things—affairs and things being bound by the five phases—are enslaved by the five thieves and cannot escape.

These thieves, in yang, manifest as perceptions; in yin, as dreams; in wakefulness, as affairs; in dreams, as things. For example, those who favor benevolence often dream of pines and plums—all enslaved by the five phases. Yet even so enslaved, if in a dream one suddenly hears or thinks of something else, the dream shifts with changing perceptions—the five phases cannot be rigidly confined.

Knowing that the five phases cannot rigidly confine dreams, one may govern and employ both affairs and things, rather than being enslaved by them. Freed from enslavement to affairs and things, how can yin and yang or the five phases remain bandits or thieves?

The

Bao Yi Zi said: The Five Substances may nourish the form, the Five Flavors may nourish the qi—thus within heaven and earth, there is no single thing that is not my form and qi. Yet if no single thing is not my seeing, no single thing is not my hearing, then what indeed are hearing and seeing? If one supposes that form can be heard and seen, why then can a corpse not be heard or seen? If one supposes that qi can be heard and seen, why then can a sigh or breath not be heard or seen? Thus beyond form and qi there must exist something else that governs and sustains them. Where then does this thing reside? As the scripture does not say: Vague and indistinct, within it there is something; dark and obscure, within it there is essence. To recognize this thing—it is the spirit. Yet spirit has no self; it is through the colors of heaven, earth, and the myriad things that my spirit is seen. Essence has no person; it is through the sounds of heaven, earth, and the myriad things that my essence is heard. Therefore my form and qi are heaven, earth, and the myriad things; my spirit and essence are the sounds and colors of the myriad things.

Guan Yin Zi said: The plowman who is accustomed to oxen becomes rough; the hunter accustomed to tigers becomes brave; the fisherman accustomed to water becomes submerged; the warrior accustomed to horses becomes strong—all things may become me. Within my single body, internally it changes into pinworms and roundworms, externally it attracts lice and fleas; when afflicted with sores, it becomes tortoises and fish; when emaciated, it becomes rats and ants—I may become all things.

Bao Yi Zi said: The human form is not originally mine. If one becomes habituated to things, one transforms together with them; if one is diseased in qi, one transforms together with the qi. There was once a man who painted tigers so vividly that he transformed into a tiger—this is the principle of becoming rough through habituation to oxen. There was once a man with a tumor; when it was cut open, it was full of lice—this is the same as the soft transforming into pinworms and roundworms. Through habituation one transforms together with things; through illness one transforms together with qi. Yet世人 cling to possessing this body, falsely considering it their own—how can they awaken to the forms bestowed by heaven and earth?

Guan Yin Zi said: My self as myself is like gold in ashes, yet not like the gold in furnace sand. One may break the crucible to obtain gold, wash the sand to obtain gold, but sift the ashes all one’s life and never obtain gold.

Bao Yi Zi said: Those who do not know that I have no self yet exhaust their wisdom seeking the self are like those who sift ashes for gold—they will never obtain it in their lifetime. Knowing there is no self and not seeking the self is like gold hidden in smelted sand or jade concealed in uncut stone. The ancients used the analogy of saltiness in water or clarity within glue—though ultimately there is something, its form is not seen. This may be called a fine analogy.

Guan Yin Zi said: A single bee, though minute, can roam and observe heaven and earth; a single shrimp, though minute, can frolic wantonly in the great sea.

Bao Yi Zi said: All creatures, though dull or sentient, possess this heart and possess this Dao. The ancients spoke of the "dark and obscure worm" establishing worlds upon the eyebrows and eyelashes of mosquitoes—viewed by form, there is a distinction of great and small; judged by heart, there is no difference between large and small. Thus a single bee may roam and observe heaven and earth; a single shrimp may frolic wantonly in the great sea. How can one slight them because of their minute forms?

Guan Yin Zi said: When clay figurines are made, there are noble and base, male and female—yet their substance is earth, their soil is earth. Are they people?

Bao Yi Zi said: When people encounter others, they perceive distinctions of male and female, noble and base, and generate thoughts of love and aversion, esteem and contempt—this is discrimination by perception, not illumination by wisdom. Now when encountering clay figurines, though there are distinctions of male and female, noble and base, one does not generate thoughts of love and aversion, esteem and contempt because one knows their substance is earth and possesses the wisdom to recognize their falsity. Thus the previous passage said: Knowing that all are formed by perception, even the real is treated as false—this is the marvelous function of transforming perception into wisdom.

Guan Yin Zi said: The eye observes itself—it has no color; the ear listens to itself—it has no sound; the tongue tastes itself—it has no flavor; the heart measures itself—it has no thing. The multitude pursue externals; the worthy cling to internals; the sage treats all as false.

Bao Yi Zi said: The eye pursues colors, the ear pursues sounds, the tongue pursues flavors, the heart pursues things—this is the multitude. The eye inwardly gazes and observes itself, the ear returns its hearing and listens to itself, the tongue gathers its saliva and tastes itself, the heart collects its thoughts and measures itself—this is the worthy. Pursuing externals is certainly wrong, but clinging to internals is also delusion. The ancients had a poem: Though you put down the toil of external dust, internally it still entangles the heart—what difference is there? Thus the sage treats all as false.

Guan Yin Zi said: My body is the qi of the Five Phases, and the qi of the Five Phases is in its nature one thing. For example, from one place one may obtain fire, obtain water, generate wood, congeal metal, transform earth—its nature encompasses all, fundamentally without difference. Thus when feathered creatures flourish, furred creatures do not thrive; when furred creatures flourish, scaled creatures do not thrive. Knowing the mutual functioning of the Five Phases, one may forget the self.

Bao Yi Zi said: Within heaven and earth, birds, beasts, insects, and fish all possess the nature of the Five Phases; compared to humans, they merely have a predisposition toward excess in one phase. Those biased toward fire become feathered; those biased toward metal become furred; those biased toward water become scaled—such as the Vermilion Bird in the south or the White Tiger in the west. When one phase is excessive, the others do not thrive. Thus we know that humans and the myriad things each possess the Five Phases, and the qi of the Five Phases circulates and functions mutually. Looking back at my body, it is merely the temporary combination of the qi of the Five Phases. Yet the deluded cling to possessing this body—how can they not be confused? Knowing this teaching, one may forget the self.

Guan Yin Zi said: One whose heart is absorbed in recollection forgets hunger; one whose heart is filled with anger forgets cold; one whose heart is nurtured forgets illness; one whose heart is stirred forgets pain.

Should one cultivate harmony by absorbing qi, who could afflict them with hunger? Should one nourish warmth by preserving spirit, who could afflict them with cold? Should one nurture the five viscera with the Five Phases, then nothing can harm them—who could afflict them with illness? Should one return the five viscera to the Five Phases, then there is no awareness—who could afflict them with pain?

Master Baoyizi said: Human hunger, cold, illness, and pain all arise from the deluded heart-mind. Yet if recollection can forget hunger, this is but a case of using delusion to halt delusion. Should one know that the deluded heart-mind arises from the Five Phases and overcome it with the Five Phases, then the deluded heart-mind may dissolve. Thus, absorbing qi to cultivate harmony can make one forget hunger; preserving spirit to nourish warmth can make one forget cold—this is the defense of replenishing metal to strengthen earth and using fire to overcome water. Nurturing the five viscera with the Five Phases can cure illness—this is the method of generation, restriction, supplementation, and drainage. Returning the five viscera to the Five Phases can make one forget pain—this is the Dao of form and qi transcending the self.

If one can be sated without absorbing qi, be warm without preserving spirit, cure illness without nurturing the five viscera, or forget pain without returning to the Five Phases—unless one is a person of utmost refinement and penetration, who could attain this?

Guan Yin Zi said: People do not take the absence of knowledge and action as the absence of self. Yet even with knowledge and action, this does not impair the absence of self. It is like fire—though restless and ceaseless, it has never possessed a self.

Master Baoyizi said: This chapter, section by section, speaks of nourishing form, and the discourse on the absence of self is expounded in detail. The sage, fearing that learners might cling to the absence of self as if to wood or stone, thus in the final section further elucidates the wondrous function of the absence of self by way of analogy: like fire, though restless and ceaseless, it has never possessed a self. Should one grasp this wondrous function, though one engages in speech, conduct, and activity all day, this does not impair their being without self. Alas! This is what *Zhuangzi* meant by "profoundly knowing the absence of heart-mind."

*The Outer Purport of the Wenshi Zhenjing*, Scroll Six, concludes.

---

A withered tortoise, though without self, can manifest great wisdom; a lodestone, though without self, can manifest great strength; bells and drums, though without self, can manifest great sound; boats and carts, though without self, can manifest distant travel. Thus, though this body of mine possesses intelligence, strength, movement, and sound, it has never possessed a self.

If a crossbow’s shadow can slay me, then knowing the absence of knowledge is also myself—throughout the vast heavens and earth, there is nowhere I am not present.

**The Seven Cauldrons by Chen Xianwei of Baoyizi**

The Cauldron is transformation. This篇 comprises thirteen chapters.

Master Guanyin said: The Dao is fundamentally the utmost void. Those who return affairs to the Dao obtain it in a single breath. Affairs are fundamentally the utmost existent. Those who move affairs with the Dao encompass them in a hundred acts.

Those who attain the Dao in its nobility may assist the world. Those who attain the Dao in its solitude may establish the self.

Those who know the Dao is not bound by time may make one day into a hundred years, or a hundred years into one day. Those who know the Dao is not obstructed by place may make one *li* into a hundred *li*, or a hundred *li* into one *li*.

Those who know the Dao is without qi yet can move existent qi may summon wind and rain. Those who know the Dao is without form yet can transform existent form may alter birds and beasts.

Those who attain the Dao in its purity are unburdened by things—their bodies become light, and they may ride phoenixes and cranes. Those who attain the Dao in its primal unity are undrowned by things—their bodies become obscure, and they may sit upon dragons and whales.

Existence is non-existence; non-existence is existence. Those who know this Dao may command ghosts and spirits. Substance is emptiness; emptiness is substance. Those who know this Dao may enter metal and stone.

Above is below; below is above. Those who know this Dao may attend the stars. Past is present; present is past. Those who know this Dao may divine with tortoise and milfoil.

Others are myself; myself is others. Those who know this Dao may peer into the lungs and liver of others. Things are myself; myself is things. Those who know this Dao may cultivate dragons and tigers within the belly.

Knowing that images arise from the heart’s transformation, by observing the heart one may become an infant maiden. Knowing that qi arises from the heart’s generation, by absorbing spirit one may cool the furnace.

By this, one may overcome things—tigers and leopards may be tamed. By this, one may unite with things—water and fire may be entered.

Only the man of Dao can do these things, yet he may do them without doing them.

Baoyizi said: The *Book of Changes* states, "Those who know the Dao of transformation know what the spirit does." *Mencius* states, "What is sacred yet unknowable is called spirit." Today, scholars of the world have drifted far from the sages. Gazing toward the Dao, they have yet to see it. Those who aspire to approach the sages are unheard of in this age—how much less the unknowable spirit.

Thus, those who speak of the spirit generally cite Confucius’s refusal to discuss prodigies, force, disorder, and spirits, so men of Dao seal their lips and do not speak. Even teachings on life and death are guarded and not transmitted.

Yet did Confucius truly not speak of the spirit? Truly not speak of life and death? Consider his words: "Know the teachings on life and death." Or: "What is unfathomable in yin and yang is called spirit." Or: "Strike and dance it to exhaust the spirit." All are Confucius’s words.

Now, in this篇 of the *Seven Cauldrons*, the sage exhaustively speaks of the Dao of transformation. The cauldron is the vessel that relies on water and fire to transform things. Few among later scholars who read this will not be astonished by its words. Some will denounce it as heretical or spurious—no wonder! *Zhuangzi* said: "The blind cannot partake in the spectacle of patterns; the deaf cannot partake in the sound of bells and drums." Is it only the body that may be deaf and blind? The understanding, too, may suffer this—is this not what is meant?

The *Book of Changes* does not say: "The movement of all under heaven is truly one"? This is the principle of returning affairs to the Dao and obtaining it in a single breath. Moving affairs with the Dao and encompassing them in a hundred acts is the ability to unify the world’s affairs—one governance, a hundred deliberations.

Those who attain the Dao in its nobility or solitude may assist the world and establish the self. This is assisting the fitting of heaven and earth, the sage’s great treasure of the throne.

The Dao is not bound by time nor obstructed by place—this is penetrating the Dao of day and night, knowing what is swift without haste, arriving without traveling.

To summon wind and rain and attend the stars is to scatter with wind and moisten with rain—this may be called aiding the spirit. To alter birds and beasts, ride phoenixes and cranes, sit upon dragons and whales, and command ghosts and spirits is to know that essence becomes things and wandering souls become transformations—this is knowing the conditions of ghosts and spirits.

To enter metal and stone is to know that *dui* is metal and *gen* is stone, that mountains and marshes communicate qi, and only then can transformation produce the myriad things.

To divine with tortoise and milfoil is to know that divination and milfoil respond like echoes to fate and destiny.

Scholars who know that the opening and closing of *qian* and *kun* is called change will understand the mechanism of *kan* and *li* meeting, water and fire intersecting, mountains and marshes communicating qi, thunder and wind clashing. Then they will know that my *zhen* and *dui* are others’ lungs and liver. By entering the spirit of *zhen* and *dui*, one may peer into others’ lungs and liver.

My hun and po are the essence of dragons and tigers. By congealing the qi of hun and po, one may transform dragons and tigers within the belly.

Within *kan* is the infant; within *li* is the maiden. By taking the substance of *kan* to infuse the emptiness of *li*, the maiden and infant appear, each manifesting their form.

This Dao operates by moving the spirit-fire to illuminate *kan*, driving the yang within yin to ascend to the spirit-fire’s original position, where it encounters the yin within yang. Capturing and binding them, like the golden crow seizing the hare or the lodestone attracting the needle, the two qi intertwine and generate transformation. Sometimes the image of the maiden and infant appears; sometimes the form of dragons and tigers emerges. Myriad transformations arise, flying and moving without restraint, leaping and bounding without leaving the crucible and furnace. At this time, one must stir the *xun* wind to assist the *li* fire in fierce refining and extreme forging, smelting the true elixir and congealing the supreme treasure—this is the Dao.

Within this are the dual practices of observing the heart and absorbing spirit, both aiding the power of the fire-timing.

The observation methods of the Buddhists, which focus on the mind, appear similar but are fundamentally different; the techniques of the alchemists, who ingest *qi* and swallow saliva, abandon the root to chase the branches. How could they comprehend the wondrous application of circulating the spirit-fire to observe the true heart or stirring the *xun* wind to absorb the true spirit?

Once the elixir is formed, one naturally gains the ability to subdue tigers and leopards, to enter water and fire—these are all secrets of *xing* and *ming*. Where in the *Book of Changes* can such phenomena be found? As the *Changes* states: "Without the utmost spirit, utmost essence, utmost transformation, and utmost penetration, who could partake in this?" If one is not the right person, the Dao does not operate in vain. Thus, it is said that only those with the Dao can achieve this. The sage wishes to manifest it through benevolence and conceal it in utility, fulfilling the Way of inner sageliness and outer kingship. Therefore, it is also said that while they *can* do it, they do not.

Guan Yinzi said: "Human power can wrest the transformations of Heaven and Earth. Examples include summoning thunder in winter, creating ice in summer, making a corpse walk, a withered tree bloom, conjuring spirits within beans, fishing in a cup, opening a painted door, or speaking to a clay ghost—all are the work of pure *qi*, enabling the transformation of the myriad things." Now, the ceaseless flow of human emotions is also the work of *qi*. Yet *qi*, as a thing, may gather or scatter. The *qi* we cultivate has never truly gathered nor scattered. That which gathers is born; that which scatters dies. That which neither gathers nor scatters is beyond birth and death. Guests come and go, but the post station remains unchanged.

Baoyizi said: "Liezi asked, 'How can the perfected one walk underwater without obstruction, tread fire without heat, or move above the myriad things without fear?' Guan Yinzi answered: 'This is the preservation of pure *qi*, not a matter of cunning or boldness.'"

When people are bound by form, they cannot transform. But if one refines form into *qi*, making form entirely dissolve into *qi*, then it may gather as form or scatter as *qi*, thus enabling the transformation of the myriad things. Observing the changes of clouds reveals the transformations of *qi*. Even the clam, a creature less intelligent than humans, can accumulate *qi* over time to manifest mirages of towers, pavilions, and people—this is the "sea market." As for the hawk transforming into a turtledove, the leopard into a tiger, the cicada shedding its shell, or the fish into a dragon, even birds, beasts, insects, and fish can wrest the transformations of Heaven and Earth. Why, then, are humans inferior? It is because the six desires and seven emotions internally plunder their celestial authenticity, while the five phases and six dusts externally consume their spirit and *qi*. Though there are those who know the Dao and can refine essence, preserve spirit, and transmute form into *qi*, their practice is inconsistent—nine times cold, once warm. To seek one who has purely transformed into *qi*, even among billions, would be impossible.

This Dao is accessible to all, regardless of worthiness, foolishness, nobility, or lowliness. The Way is not distant; the ceaseless flow of human emotions is this very thing. Yet within it lies something beyond this thing. If scholars understand this, they will grasp how we cultivate *qi*. Knowing how to cultivate *qi*, they will know how to refine it. Knowing how to refine *qi*, they will understand how to transform it into pure essence.

This treasure does not follow *qi* in gathering or scattering, nor does it follow form in life or death. Thus, it is said: "Guests come and go, but the post station remains unchanged."

Guan Yinzi said: "There are those who chant mantras, those who serve spirits, those who inscribe talismans, and those who alter fingers—all can command spirit, govern *qi*, and transform the myriad things. Only the insincere struggle to trust themselves and readily believe in external objects, hence relying on such methods. If one truly knows sincerity, there is no need to depend on them."

Baoyizi said: "Sincerity can move Heaven and Earth, stir ghosts and spirits. Thus, whether chanting mantras, serving spirits, inscribing talismans, or altering fingers, one can command spirit, govern *qi*, and transform the myriad things. The insincere do not trust their own emptiness but readily believe in external objects. Therefore, the sage employs these transformations to awaken their faith. If they truly know sincerity, they will no longer need such methods but can achieve it naturally."

Guan Yinzi said: "With each breath—inhale and exhale—a person travels four hundred thousand *li* in a day. The transformation is swift indeed! Only the sage remains unchanged."

Baoyizi said: "The vastness of Heaven and Earth cannot be measured by degrees. Now, if one breathes thirteen thousand five hundred times in a day and night, traveling fifty-four *yi* *li* to complete one celestial cycle—ancients used the length of shadows to verify the sun’s movement, measuring by spans and inches. If it can be measured by spans, it can be measured by *li*. The foolish claim that traveling four hundred thousand *li* daily is impossible, but this is merely a rough estimate. If there were an exact remainder, it might complete the five thousand five *yi* *li* of the *Changes*’ celestial tally of fifty-five."

The conjunctions and oppositions of the sun, moon, and five planets—sages can calculate them into calendars, yet the ignorant see but do not understand. Thus, the *Classic of Yin Convergence* says: "All under Heaven see it, yet none know it."

Nothing is swifter than the great transformation. The ancients said: "Lifting Heaven and Earth to hasten the new, shouldering mountains and rivers to discard the old—creation does not pause for an instant, nor do the myriad things remain unchanged for a moment." Mountains and rivers change daily, yet people assume they are as before. Eras renew daily, yet people cling to the past. Those who lose the moment in the blink of an eye have all departed into darkness. The "I" of the past is no longer the present "I"; the "I" of today is no longer the former self. Thus, the self and the present both pass away.

Yet the ignorant remain unaware, recklessly believing that what they encounter today can be bound and preserved. How could they know that in a single breath, the great transformation has already traversed four hundred thousand *li*?

Only the sage neither resists transformation to preserve nor follows it to change—thus, they neither preserve nor change. (Note: *yi* here means ten thousand times ten thousand.)

Master Guan Yin said: "The Blue Phoenix lives a thousand years and transforms a thousand times; Peach Master served five lords and his heart transformed five times. The sage treats affairs as a guest and distances himself from things—how could he not wish to establish himself in the world? It is the fear of the unfathomable nature of transformation that comes with form and number."

Master Baoyi said: "Those with form and number are inevitably transformed. The sage does not seek to evade this—why? Once called form, it must have number, which is not mine to possess. It is but the cast-off husk of Heaven and Earth. Even Heaven and Earth cannot halt transformation—how could form defy it?"

Yet the sage borrows the myriad things to wander through the world, lodges his form amid the Five Phases, and responds to all affairs without daring to take the lead. Thus, he does not act as host but as guest, mastering the ten thousand things without being enslaved by them. Standing alone, he is without dependence.

To be a guest is to dwell as a sojourner—coming and going freely. To be without dependence is to be without duality—unchanged in life or death. In this way, how could form or number constrain him? Yet even the sage does not wish to remain long in the world, for this bodily form is but a great sigh—fearing the unfathomable nature of transformation.

The Blue Phoenix was an ancient adept of the Dao who lived a thousand years and transformed a thousand times—this is the meaning. As for Peach Master, who served five lords and whose heart transformed five times, it is like Confucius, who at sixty transformed with each year, or Master Zeng, whose heart transformed with each office. The intent is the same.

Master Guan Yin said: "The ten thousand things shift and change, now hidden, now manifest, yet the *qi* remains one. Only the sage knows the One and does not transform."

Master Baoyi said: "This passage connects to the previous one. Though the things of form shift and change, now hidden, now manifest, the single *qi* within Heaven and Earth never transforms. If even the *qi* does not transform, how much less that which is not *qi* in me? What is not *qi*? That from which *qi* itself arises was already explained in the preceding section.

The sage here clarifies that our numinous essence, if lodged in form, will transform even over a thousand years. If lodged in *qi*, it remains one and unchanging."

Master Guan Yin said: "The growth of nails, the lengthening of hair, the circulation of *ying* and *wei*—none ceases for an instant. The multitude sees these in their manifest forms but cannot perceive them in their subtlety."

Master Baoyi said: "The multitude merely sees the swift transformations of Heaven and Earth, sun and moon—these are manifest and easily observed. Yet they do not know that our *ying* and *wei* circulate twenty-five degrees through the *yin* and twenty-five degrees through the *yang* in a day and night, completing one hundred and thirty-five hundred cycles as the vessels and channels revolve without pause. Thus, the growth of nails and hair never halts for an instant. These are subtle and difficult to perceive—who can escape them? Only the sage, who neither preserves nor changes, allows all things to transform of themselves—thus, he is without transformation."

Master Guan Yin said: "Within a room, one’s perceptions are constant. Then, stepping to the gate, to the neighbor’s, to the village, to the district, then to the outskirts, the mountains, the rivers—perceptions differ, likes and dislikes follow, harmony and contention arise, gain and loss take shape. Thus, the sage is ever cautious in movement and stillness."

Master Baoyi said: "The sage’s perceptions are no different from those of the multitude. The multitude’s perceptions shift with each place, giving rise to likes and dislikes, harmony and contention, gain and loss. If the sage were to differ from the multitude, refusing to generate such responses, he would have a heart, a self—this is the learning of the worthy, who still their hearts, but it falls short of the sage.

The sage, however, goes forth and shares in others’ joys, follows their likes and dislikes, joins their harmony and contention, and partakes in their gains and losses. Like Laozi, who wept when others wept and laughed when others laughed; like Confucius, who at seventy followed his heart’s desires without overstepping; like Liezi, who studied for three years without daring to think of right or wrong or speak of profit or harm, and for five years, his thoughts and words transformed—these are examples of the sage not differing from the multitude, and the multitude not differing from the sage. How could he set himself apart through perception?

What the sage guards against is recklessly leaving the courtyard and inviting blame, recklessly mingling with the crowd and failing to overcome, recklessly joining others in the wilds and falling short of his aspirations. He does not enter perilous states or dwell in chaotic ones—he is merely cautious in movement and stillness."

Master Guan Yin said: "It is like the great sea, which transforms countless dragons and fish—yet the water remains one. I and the myriad things, flourishing and abundant within the great transformation, are of one nature. To know this oneness is to be without self or other, without death or life."

Master Baoyi said: "As the ancients said: 'Dragons and fish do not know water is their life, just as people in the void do not recognize the void.' I and the myriad things dwell within the great transformation, of one nature—like dragons and fish born in the great sea, where the water is one. To know the sea as one water is to forget the dragons and fish; to know the Great Void as one nature is to forget self and other. What then is death? What is life?"

Master Guan Yin said: "The principles of the world: what is right may transform into wrong, wrong into right; kindness may become cruelty, cruelty kindness. Thus, the sage dwells in constancy yet contemplates change."

Master Baoyi said: "In all under heaven, there is nothing that does not change, nor any principle that does not transform. The distance between sage and madman—how vast, like heaven and abyss! The disparity between life and death—how extreme, like ice and burning charcoal! Yet the sage, lost in thoughtlessness, may become a madman; the madman, restraining his thoughts, may become a sage. Life, pushed to its limit, transforms into death; death, pushed to its limit, transforms into life. How much more so the shifts between right and wrong, kindness and cruelty—doubt and semblance, reversal and repetition—are they not easily altered?

The deluded cling to their own rightness, as unmovable as mountains; they rely on their kindness, as inexhaustible as the flowing sea. Yet in no time, rightness transforms into wrongness, kindness into cruelty. The mountain of self-righteousness from days past suddenly becomes the sea of universal reproach; the sea of kindness one relied upon in an instant becomes the mountain of accumulated resentment. Like towering cliffs becoming valleys, deep valleys becoming hills—unexpectedly, change arrives.

Alas, how fearful! Only the sage does not cling to rightness, does not dispute wrongness, does not rely on kindness, does not dwell on cruelty. He levels his mountain, flattens others’ seas, abides in the constancy of all under heaven, and contemplates the transformations of things. He never precedes others but always follows them—his essential aim is simply to avoid fault.

Master Guan Yin said: "In youth, one should heed the teachings of father and elder brothers; in maturity, one should grasp the admonitions of friends; in old age, one should be warned by the words of youth. Though the myriad transformations shift, they cannot constrain me."

Master Baoyi said: "In navigating the world, one cannot avoid establishing oneself, conducting affairs, striving for excellence, and interacting with others. If one acts with self-will, then in every moment of movement, fortune and misfortune, regret and shame follow. Though there may be one benefit in good fortune, the three—misfortune, regret, and shame—will constrain me.

Only the sage sets aside the self and follows others: in youth, heeding the teachings of parents; in maturity, grasping the admonitions of friends; in old age, being warned by the words of youth. Thus, from youth to old age, he never asserts the self. Though the myriad transformations shift, how can they constrain me?"

Master Guan Yin said: "Among the principles of all under heaven, the light is easily transformed, the heavy is difficult to change. For example, wind and clouds vanish in an instant, while the nature of gold and jade endures unchanged over time. Those who are light and bright can transform along with creation without lingering—yet something unchanging remains within."

Master Baoyi said: "The light is the human *hun*; the bright is the human *shen*. The *hun* is wood, hence its lightness; the *shen* is fire, hence its brightness. The sun rises at *mao* (5th earthly branch), and the *hun* flourishes; the sun culminates at *wu* (7th earthly branch), and the *shen* flourishes. At *shen* (9th earthly branch), the *hun* perishes; at *hai* (12th earthly branch), the *shen* perishes. Thus, within a single day, my *hun* and *shen* transform along with creation without lingering.

Only *jing* and *po* are heavy and dark, capable of enduring. Thus, they can gestate the *hun* and *shen* until the next day. The light and bright *hun* and *shen* are reborn and flourish again from *jing* and *po*, awakening through clarity and arousal. Therefore, the light and bright rely on the heavy and dark as their mother. If the *hun* and *shen* perish between *shen* and *hai*, and the *jing* and *po* are destroyed and cease to exist, then the *hun* and *shen* of the next day will have no source from which to arise.

Those who understand the Dao know this, so they refine *jing* and *po* into gold and jade, making them endure unchanged. Then my *hun* and *shen* can ride upon them eternally, finding their support and growing without end. As the *Cantong Qi* says: *'The auspicious ride upon one another, securely attaining long life.'* Thus, refining *jing* and *po* into gold and jade makes my body a supremely auspicious vessel, bearing my *hun* and *shen*.

The reason the Taiyi Fire Talisman and Golden Elixir cultivation focus on these two things—refining *jing* and *po*—and earth as the third, is this. As the *Cantong Qi* states: *'The three do not enter; fire and two accompany them.'* The *hun* of wood (three) and the *shen* of fire (two) need no refinement, do not enter the crucible, but remain outside it. The *hun* and *shen* circulate the fire in the celestial revolution. The *hun* (three) and *shen* (two) combine to form five, enabling them to revolve the celestial fire without obscurity. *Jing* (water, one) and *po* (metal, four) also combine to form five, enabling them to transform into golden liquid and form the elixir. Thus, all four can form five, truly relying on the central palace’s earth (five) to achieve transformation.

As Zhang Wuzhen said: *'Only by embracing true earth between them can the golden elixir return.'* This is the meaning. It also says: *'East three and south two together form five; north one and west four share them. Wu and ji reside in their original positions; the three families meet to conceive the infant.'* Knowing this principle, one then understands that within the self, something unchanging remains."

Master Guan Yin said: "Two children who were close, when grown, meet and do not recognize each other; two adults who were close, when aged, meet and do not recognize each other. Like the transformations of sparrows into clams, hawks into turtledoves—there is no past, no present."

Master Baoyi said: "The human body is merely one thing among heaven and earth, never for a moment not transforming along with the Creator. The appearance of youth differs in maturity; the appearance of maturity differs in old age. Like sparrows, clams, hawks, and turtledoves, they change their forms with the *qi* of the four seasons’ yin and yang, unable to act as they wish. How can there be sameness between past and present?

Thus, my form and countenance have already passed with the present, transforming along with things. Can one not be aware of this?"

*The Seventh Outer Chapter of the Wenshi Zhenjing Concludes*
*(Note: In the Juer and two other collated editions, two lines of the text are missing: 'The worthy see it clearly but cannot submit to transformation.')*

**The Eighth Outer Chapter of the Wenshi Zhenjing**

**Baoyizi’s Chen Xianwei’s Exposition**

**The Eight Strategies**

A *strategy* is a thing—altogether six chapters.

Master Guanyin said: The ancients skilled in divining with milfoil and scorching tortoise shells could reveal the ancient within the present, the present within the ancient; the high within the low, the low within the high; the small within the great, the great within the small; the one within the many, the many within the one; the human within things, things within the human; the self within the other, the other within the self.

This Dao—its coming has no present, its going has no past; its height has no summit, its depth no base; its greatness has no exterior, its smallness no interior. Beyond it, there are no things; within it, there are no people. Its nearness has no self, its distance no other.

It cannot be divided, cannot be united, cannot be described, cannot be pondered. Only in its undifferentiated oneness does it become the Dao.

Baoyizi said: The *Yijing* states, *"To probe the subtle and search the hidden, to draw forth the deep and reach the distant, and so accomplish the world’s straightest lines—nothing surpasses the brush."* Thus, the brush and its tip may serve as metaphors for the Dao.

This thing—it is but withered stalks and rotting bones. Whence comes its numinosity? Whence arises its sageliness? How then can it divine the ancient within the present, the present within the ancient?

This is because its coming has no present, its going no past—yet it manifests the past and examines the future.

To reveal the low within the high and the high within the low is because its height has no summit, its depth no base—thus high and low have no constancy.

To reveal the great within the small and the small within the great is because its greatness has no exterior, its smallness no interior—thus great and small are equalized.

To reveal the many within the one and the one within the many is because its numbers intermingle—thus one policy governs a hundred concerns.

To reveal things within the human and the human within things is because beyond it there are no things, within it there are no people—thus there is no distance, no depth, no obscurity, and one knows what is to come.

To reveal the other within the self and the self within the other is because its nearness has no self, its distance no other—thus to speak of the distant is not to depart, to speak of the near is to be still and correct.

How wondrous then are withered stalks and rotting bones! This numinosity resides within them—yet it cannot be divided, cannot be united, cannot be described, cannot be pondered. Know that the marvelous Dao dwells within the human’s blood and flesh, yet it cannot be divided or united, cannot be described or pondered.

Does not the *Yijing* say, *"The brush’s virtue is round and numinous"*? Only in its undifferentiated oneness does it become the Dao.

Master Guanyin said: Water gathers, thus condensing into the five essences; fire soars, thus dispersing into the five odors; wood flourishes, thus blooming into the five colors; metal hardens, thus solidifying into the five sounds; earth harmonizes, thus nourishing the five flavors. Their constancy is five, their transformations beyond reckoning; their forms are five, their combinations beyond reckoning.

Thus, the myriad things between heaven and earth cannot be rigidly called ten thousand, cannot be rigidly called five, cannot be rigidly called one; nor can they be rigidly called *not* ten thousand, *not* five, *not* one. Whether uniting or separating them, to insist on their forms, their numbers, or their *qi* is but self-exertion—things know not the self, the self knows not things.

Baoyizi said: The five phases within heaven and earth—their constancy is five, their transformations beyond reckoning; their forms are five, their combinations beyond reckoning. Summarizing their essentials: water condenses into the five essences, fire disperses into the five odors, wood blooms into the five colors, metal solidifies into the five sounds, earth nourishes the five flavors. Yet the myriad things between heaven and earth, beyond reckoning, all arise from the intermingling of the five phases.

Whether uniting or separating them, they cannot be rigidly called five, cannot be rigidly called ten thousand, cannot be rigidly called one; nor can they be rigidly called *not* five, *not* ten thousand, *not* one. To distinguish which thing must correspond to which number or which *qi* is but self-exertion. Thus it is said: things know not the self, the self knows not things.

Master Guanyin said: Within my mind, the myriad things can be created. Where the mind directs, love follows; where love follows, essence follows. Where the mind congeals, it first solidifies into water. The mind yearns for things, and saliva flows; the mind grieves, and tears flow; the mind feels shame, and sweat flows. There is no momentary state that does not endure, no enduring state that does not transform. Water generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal, metal generates water—attacking and overcoming one another, beyond reckoning.

The infant and the maiden, the jeweled tower and the crimson palace, the azure dragon and the white tiger, the precious tripod and the great furnace—all are these things, and none exist apart from them.

Baoyizi said: The *Yinfu Jing* states, *"Heaven has five thieves; those who perceive them prosper. The five thieves reside in the heart, acting upon heaven. The cosmos lies within the hand, the myriad transformations arise within the body."*

Thus, the marvelous workings of the five phases—how wondrous, how numinous! People rest unaware of their mechanism. Know their mechanism and master them, and the five thieves all become one’s tools. Then the infant and the maiden, the jeweled tower and the crimson palace, the azure dragon and the white tiger, the precious tripod and the great furnace—all manifest their forms and cannot be concealed. Thus it is said, *"Those who perceive them prosper."*

To perceive them is to see the spirit, soul, ethereal and corporeal souls of one’s body congealing in numinous water, coalescing into images, appearing within the Yellow Court.

This thing—it is the same whether in the kidneys, stirred by love to become essence; in the eyes, moved by sorrow to become tears; in the nose, affected by wind to become mucus; or on the body, shamed by things to become sweat. All alike arise from the mind’s direction, and numinous water responds accordingly.

As with the visions seen in childhood, which remain vivid in dreams even into adulthood and old age, never fading from memory—these impressions are etched into the heart, congealing in numinous water, enduring without momentary lapse and unchanging without alteration. The difference lies only in whether the heart is directed or undirected. If one can seize and restrain the five thieves, tempering the five phases, then with the heart unmoved, the numinous water naturally congeals, and the five thieves manifest their forms in myriad transformations.

This Dao, though formed from the transmutations of the five phases, inherently contains something beyond them—something that presides as their master. Master Guan Yin said: *"Birds and beasts now chirp, now gather, now flee; grasses and trees now sprout, now stand tall, now wither. Heaven and earth cannot retain them, the sage cannot bind them—only the workings of fate abide."* That which exists lies there; that which does not exists here. A drum does not sound without a drumstick; the even lies there, the odd lies here. Without the hand to strike, there is no resonance.

Master Baoyi said: *"The sage observes transformation, thus remaining free from the workings of change within form and qi. Heaven and earth cannot retain them, sages and worthies cannot bind them. Birds and beasts cry out, gather, and flee; grasses and trees sprout, flourish, and wither—all these are fleeting, their transformations swift. Yet the sage remains unchanging, like a drum that does not sound without a drumstick: existence lies there, nonexistence lies here. Without the hand to strike, there is no impact: the even lies there, the odd lies here."* The earlier passage—*"A hand that does not touch the blade, a blade that does not wound"*—shares this principle.

Master Guan Yin said: *"Though all is one thing, the multitude are deluded by names, seeing only things and not the Dao. The worthy dissect its principles, seeing the Dao but not things. The sage unites with Heaven, seeing neither Dao nor things—all is Dao. Ungrasped, it is the Dao; grasped, it becomes a thing."*

Master Baoyi said: *"All things fill the space between Heaven and Earth, each bearing a name, each bearing a principle. Those who see the name but not the Dao are bound by things—they are the multitude. Those who dissect the principle but not the thing can bind things—they are the worthy. The sage, however, is otherwise: seeing neither the so-called Dao nor the so-called thing, they simply unite with Heaven. If one points to a single thing and calls it the Dao, then every thing is the Dao. Only by not grasping it is it called the Dao; if grasped as the Dao, it becomes a thing."*

Master Guan Yin said: *"One who knows the falsity of things need not discard them. For example, seeing clay oxen or wooden horses, though the name of ox or horse remains, the mind forgets their true substance."*

Master Baoyi said: *"The true and false of things arise from perception. The sage encounters even what is true and treats it as false. By relinquishing perception, even the true is made false—then all things under Heaven are false. Knowing all things are false, why discard them? Like seeing wooden or clay effigies, though they bear the name of a thing, the mind forgets their true substance. Should those who study the Dao be able to face phenomena in this way!"*

*The Outer Teachings of the Wenshi Zhenjing, Scroll Eight, concludes.*

*The Outer Teachings of the Wenshi Zhenjing, Scroll Nine, recorded by Baoyizi Chen Xianwei.*

**The Nine Remedies**

A remedy is a mixed treatment. This section contains thirty-one chapters.

Master Guanyin said: *"Do not slight small matters—small cracks sink ships. Do not slight small things—tiny insects poison the body. Do not slight petty men—petty men plunder nations. Only by attending to small matters can one accomplish great matters; only by accumulating small things can one achieve great things; only by mastering petty men can one align with great men.*

*Heaven has nothing it must necessarily favor in man, and man has nothing he can necessarily control in affairs. Only by departing from affairs and distancing from men does the self remain in the self. What is permissible is permissible; what is not, is not. There is no fixed rule for complexity or simplicity, no fixed rule for restraint or endurance, no fixed rule for diligence or indolence."* (Alternatively: *"for action or stillness"*)

Master Baoyi said: *"This entire section consists of medicinal admonitions—hence its name, 'mixed treatment.' For in man’s engagement with the world, if he cannot depart from affairs and distance from men, then in every response to events and encounters with things, in every movement and stillness, fortune and misfortune, regret and shame reside. The sage desires that man avoid misfortune and seek fortune, free from the anxieties of regret and shame, and thus imparts these medicinal teachings, that man may take them to heart and apply them in treatment. Who but one of great sagacity and wisdom could do this?*

*Moreover, since Heaven has nothing it must necessarily favor in man, and man has nothing he can necessarily control in affairs, how dare one slight petty men, small things, or trifling matters! Confucius said: ‘Man’s heart is more treacherous than mountains and rivers, harder to know than Heaven. Heaven at least has its seasons—spring and autumn, winter and summer, dawn and dusk—but man conceals his countenance and buries his feelings. He rushes toward righteousness as if parched, yet flees from it as if scorched. How can he be fathomed?’*

*How many in the world have slighted petty men, belittled small things, and neglected trifling matters, only to bring ruin upon their nations, destruction upon their families, and loss of life and limb! Thus the sage says: Only by mastering petty men can one align with great men; only by accumulating small things can one achieve great things; only by attending to small matters can one accomplish great matters. All proceeds from the small to the great, from the subtle to the manifest—one must not dismiss petty men, small things, or trifling matters as insignificant. If the sage treats even the small with such care, how much more the great!*

*The principles of the world are such that no complex matter can be resolved with simplicity, no matter requiring restraint can be forced through endurance, and no matter demanding diligence can be accomplished through indolence. Thus the sage, in his dealings with the world, permits only what is permissible and rejects what is not. In affairs, there is nothing that is necessarily permissible or necessarily impermissible—how could there be any fixed attachment?*

*Thus we know that though the sage daily responds to affairs and things, he is not bound to affairs or things, and the self remains in the self."*

Master Guanyin said: *"The utmost in wisdom is to know that wisdom is ultimately insufficient to encompass all things—hence, the wise appear foolish. The utmost in eloquence is to know that eloquence is ultimately insufficient to clarify all things—hence, the eloquent appear inarticulate. The utmost in courage is to know that courage is ultimately insufficient to overcome all things—hence, the brave appear timid."*

Master Baoyi said: *"The principles of the world are such that contention leaves one lacking, while deference leaves one with surplus. The sage’s great wisdom appears foolish, his great eloquence appears inarticulate, his great courage appears timid—not as a pretense, but because he knows that wisdom is ultimately insufficient to encompass all things, hence he appears foolish; that eloquence is ultimately insufficient to clarify all things, hence he appears inarticulate; that courage is ultimately insufficient to overcome all things, hence he appears timid. As the saying goes: ‘His foolishness is unmatched’—thus wisdom is not equal to foolishness. ‘Nine correct guesses out of ten are not as good as one moment of silence’—thus eloquence is not equal to inarticulateness. ‘The soft can overcome the hard, the weak can overcome the strong’—thus courage is not equal to timidity."*

Master Guanyin said: *"Of the ten thousand things between Heaven and Earth, not one is truly mine. Things are not me, yet they cannot but be responded to; I am not me, yet I cannot but be nurtured. Though I respond to things, I have never possessed them; though I nurture myself, I have never possessed a self. Do not say that external things make me external; do not say that external form makes the mind external. The Dao is one—it cannot be approached in stages."*

Master Baoyi said: *"One who responds well to things has no things; one who nurtures the self well has no self. If there are things, one cannot respond to things; if there is a self, one cannot nurture the self. Why? Things are not my things, and I am not my self. The moment one externalizes things, one externalizes the self; the moment one externalizes the self, one externalizes the mind. If one inwardly observes the mind, outwardly observes the form, and distantly observes things, then mind, self, and things are divided into three, inevitably leading to a staged progression. The Dao is one—it is seen directly, without the labor of discrimination. Once one is empty, all is empty—why proceed in stages?"*

Master Guanyin said: *"One who scrutinizes the tip of a hair cannot see the vastness of Heaven and Earth; one who examines a faint sound cannot hear the crash of thunder. Those who see the great cannot see the small; those who see the near cannot see the far. Those who hear the great cannot hear the small; those who hear the near cannot hear the far. The sage has nothing he sees, and thus nothing he does not see; nothing he hears, and thus nothing he does not hear."*

Master Baoyi said: *"When a man has something he sees, he also has something he does not see; when he has something he hears, he also has something he does not hear. It is not that his spirit is limited or his essence is measured—it is that he does not employ his spirit and essence correctly. Little does he realize that the wondrousness of Heaven, Earth, and the ten thousand things is all his spirit, and that the existence of Heaven, Earth, and the ten thousand things is all his essence. Thus, the sage, having nothing he sees, can see all things; having nothing he hears, can hear all things. Do scholars understand this?"*

Master Guanyin said: *"The eye sees countless things—some love gold, some love jade—this is to fixate on one color for the eye. The ear hears countless sounds—some love bells, some love drums—this is to fixate on one sound for the ear. Only the sage neither craves nor rejects them, nor dwells upon them."*

Baoyi Zi said: This chapter further elucidates the meaning of the preceding one. The sage fears that scholars may not understand that having nothing he sees and nothing he hears constitutes greatness, so he provisionally uses what is seen and heard to illustrate it. For instance, the eye sees countless colors, yet when one gazes upon an object, he fixates on a particular hue, thus constraining his vision. The ear hears countless sounds, yet when one listens to a specific noise, he fixates on that sound, thus constraining his hearing. Only the sage neither covets nor rejects those sounds and colors, nor dwells upon those forms and echoes. By not clinging to his own seeing and hearing, his seeing and hearing become vast.

Guanyin Zi said: *"One who is good at the present can practice the ancient Way; one who is good at the branches can establish the root."*

Baoyi Zi said: If scholars wish to practice the ancient Way, they must be adept with present customs. If they wish to return to the root, they must understand the branches. Should one live in the present age yet defy its customs, he will harm his life. If one knows only the root but not the branches, it will be difficult to stand firm. Thus, the sage harmonizes his light and blends with the dust to master the present, responding flexibly and fittingly to adapt to the branches—this is the very ground for practicing the ancient Way and establishing the root.

Guanyin Zi said: *"A cunning thief can capture a thief; a brave man can capture a tiger. Only by overcoming the self can one perfect the self; only by overcoming things can one benefit things. Only by forgetting the Way can one possess the Way."*

Baoyi Zi said: A thief is overcome by cunning, a tiger by bravery—this is certain. But by what does one overcome the self? The self is one’s own body; to overcome is to prevail over it. If one knows what the body fundamentally is, he will understand the Way to overcome it. Scholars should observe that the self is originally nonexistent, arising only from the entanglement of the seven emotions and six desires. To overcome the self, one must first overcome emotions and desires. As stated in the previous chapter: *"One who can restrain a single emotion can cultivate virtue; one who can forget a single emotion can align with the Way."* This is the sage’s teaching on perfecting the self. Only after perfecting the self can one benefit things. If even a single thing remains before oneself, one is overcome by things—how then can he benefit them? Having perfected the self and benefited things, one may approach the Way. Yet can the Way be forgotten? If the Way is not forgotten, how can one possess it?

Guanyin Zi said: *"A vessel that is too hard will be shattered by things—what is rigid will break. A blade that is too sharp will be blunted by things—what is keen will be dulled. The phoenix conceals its divinity in rarity, thus the sage takes depth as his root. The musk deer leaves its fragrance to avoid capture, thus the sage takes restraint as his principle."*

Baoyi Zi said: *"What is hard will be shattered; what is sharp will be dulled; taking depth as the root and restraint as the principle—these are all words of Laozi."* *The Guanyin Zi* further employs the vessel, blade, phoenix, and musk deer to illuminate Laozi’s meaning, urging scholars to fully embrace the principles of guarding softness, embracing emptiness, and concealing one’s brilliance to preserve oneself and avoid fault. Are these not healing words?

Guanyin Zi said: *"A jar has two openings. When filled with water and inverted, if one opening is closed, the water will not flow out. For if it does not rise, it cannot descend. Though a well be a thousand fathoms deep, when drawn, the water ascends—if it does not descend, it cannot rise. Thus, the sage does not precede things."*

Baoyi Zi said: When the sage does not dare to be first in the world, it is precisely how he becomes first before Heaven, Earth, and the ten thousand things. Why? The principles of the world are such that if it does not rise, it cannot descend; if it does not follow, it cannot lead; if it does not lower itself, it cannot be exalted. Thus, Laozi speaks of being *"a ravine for the world"* and *"a valley for the world"*—all expressing this idea. Drawing water with a tube: if the upper opening is pressed, the water flows downward. Placing fire beneath a jar to draw water causes the water to rise upward—both illustrate the principle that if it does not rise, it cannot descend. The same principle applies to closing an opening or drawing from a well. Yet what can rise and descend is water, while what closes, draws, fires, or presses is man. Man’s ability to make water rise, descend, remain, or reverse lies in qi. Nevertheless, the Way of Heaven favors return. To hold and fill is not as good as stopping—how much less dare one precede things? This is what the sage most cautions against.

Guanyin Zi said: *"When a man makes a mistake, though he suffers harm only after the error, in time, he secretly criticizes himself even before the mistake. Only by not relying on his own wisdom but incorporating the wisdom of others can he naturally transcend the self and embrace the selves of all under Heaven. Practicing this throughout life, he can avoid mistakes."*

Baoyi Zi said: Even one as wise and perceptive as Emperor Shun did not rely on his own wisdom but humbly followed others—how much more should others do the same! Yet while it is easy to not rely on one’s own wisdom and incorporate the wisdom of others, it is difficult to discern the sincerity and deceit of others and choose whom to associate with. Alas! The sayings on knowing others and understanding words—even Yao and Shun found them challenging!

Guanyin Zi said: *"Customs of ancient and modern times differ; customs of east, west, south, and north differ; even the virtues of a single family or individual differ. How could I cling to one pattern to constrain later generations? Only by adapting to the times, harmonizing with customs, anticipating opportunities, following events, relinquishing anger, restraining desires, simplifying things, and forgiving others—weighing their importance and acting accordingly—can one naturally align with the unfathomable and unite with the boundless Way."*

Baoyi Zi said: *"Adapting to the times, harmonizing with customs, anticipating opportunities, following events, relinquishing anger, restraining desires, simplifying things, and forgiving others"*—these principles align with Confucius’ *"Wing Yi: Adapting to the Times."* People know the sayings on *"grasping opportunities to accomplish tasks,"* *"curbing anger and restraining desires,"* and *"simplicity, forgiveness, loyalty"*—yet scholars do not understand. They claim Daoist learning exclusively values non-action, as if the sage clings to one pattern to constrain later generations. What could the sage’s intention be?

Across all ages and lands, though the customs of each household and individual differ, the sage weighs their importance and establishes measures accordingly—advancing when it is fitting to follow the ancients, bowing when it is fitting to yield below. Only in this "neither necessary nor impossible" does one align with the unfathomable and unite with the boundless Way. Did not Confucius say, *"I privately compare myself to Old Peng"*? Then how can the Ways of Confucius and Laozi be viewed as distinct?

Master Guan Yin said: *"There are those who unite through the Way, those who unite through virtue, and those who unite through affairs. Those who unite through the Way are like father and son—transcending judgments of right and wrong or worthiness and foolishness—thus their bond endures. Those who unite through virtue are subject to such distinctions, thus their union may harmonize or dissolve. Those who unite through affairs part when their purpose is done."*

Baoyi Zi said: *"When Zihua Zi and Confucius met on the road, they tilted their carriage canopies and spoke for the entire day, as joyful as old friends. Confucius turned to his disciples and had them present a bundle of silk to the gentleman. Zilu questioned this, for Zihua Zi was none other than Cheng Ben, a disciple of Laozi. Yet at first sight, Confucius treated him as an old friend—this was a union through the Way. When the two met by chance, their eyes met and the Way was present. How could this compare to worldly unions of virtue or profit, bound by distinctions of worthiness, right and wrong, or gain and loss? No wonder Zilu failed to understand! Ah, how could one encounter another like Cheng Zihua or Kong Zhongni, tilt their canopies in passing, and forget all beyond the form of the body?"*

Master Guan Yin said: *"Do not mistake clumsiness for the substance of the Way—one should delight in agility. Do not mistake dullness for the obscurity of the Way—one should delight in clarity. Do not mistake arrogance for the loftiness of the Way—one should delight in harmony. Do not mistake dissipation for the vastness of the Way—one should delight in focus. Do not mistake melancholy for the stillness of the Way—one should delight in joy. The ancients’ teachings on learning are prone to many corruptions—these must be remedied."*

Baoyi Zi said: *"The ancients’ teachings were not confined to a single approach. In their time, there were the schools of Qin Guli, Song Keng, Yin Wen, Peng Meng, Tian Pian, Shen Dao, and Mo Di. Today, their words are no longer transmitted. By the time of Mencius, only the teachings of Yang Zhu and Mozi remained. Thus, we know that by the eras of Guan Yin and Confucius, the words of Qin, Song, Yin, Peng, Tian, and Shen had already been rejected. Agility resembles today’s Chan dialogues, which value quick-witted responses. Clarity resembles the leaping and dancing practices of contemplative observation. Harmony resembles the Six Harmonies of the Western teachings. Focus resembles the single-minded inquiry into a phrase to seek sudden awakening. Joy resembles the unconstrained freedom of carefree wandering. Though these are not the exact teachings of the ancients, their essence is largely akin. The corruptions of learning must still be remedied."*

Master Guan Yin said: *"Do not condemn the world while exalting yourself. Do not belittle others while elevating yourself. Do not treat the Way with carelessness. Do not slander the virtuous. Do not disparage your own talents."*

Baoyi Zi said: *"One who condemns the world will be condemned by it—this is misfortune. One who belittles others will be belittled by them—this is disgrace. To endure carelessness and claim one possesses the Way is shallow. To ignore slander and claim one possesses virtue is arrogance. To encounter vulgar people and claim one possesses talent is delusion. These five are ailments of the scholar—one must remedy them oneself."*

Master Guan Yin said: *"To confound the world’s wisest is not through wisdom but through foolishness. To exhaust the world’s most eloquent is not through eloquence but through silence."*

Baoyi Zi said: *"Excessive wisdom and eloquence are ailments. The ability to be foolish and silent is the remedy. Wisdom cannot confound the world’s wisdom; eloquence cannot exhaust the world’s eloquence. Using wisdom to attack wisdom, eloquence to counter eloquence, is like using fire to stop fire or water to stop water—what benefit is there? Formerly, the Southern Tang selected envoys of vast learning and eloquence to send to our court. Our Taizu chose illiterate, utterly foolish, and silent warriors to receive them, leaving the eloquent envoys with no means to deploy their skills. This is the Way."*

Master Guan Yin said: *"Heaven cannot make lotuses bloom in winter or chrysanthemums in spring—thus the sage does not defy the seasons. Earth cannot make oranges from Luoyang grow in Wen or badgers from Wen thrive in Luoyang—thus the sage does not defy customs. The sage cannot make hands walk or feet grasp—thus the sage does not defy their own strengths. The sage cannot make fish fly or birds run—thus the sage does not defy others’ strengths. Only thus can one act or rest, conceal or reveal, without constraint—this is the Way."*

Baoyi Zi said: *"The Way unfolds in the world, sometimes valuing concealment, sometimes clarity, sometimes movement, sometimes stillness—all are the natural principles. The sage observes Heaven’s patterns to harmonize the obscurity or clarity of their spirit with the seasons. They examine Earth’s advantages to align the movement or stillness of their form with what is fitting. Beginning with oneself, one extends this to others—none are exceptions. Thus, when the spirit is fit for clarity, one clarifies; when fit for obscurity, one obscures. When the form is fit for movement, one moves; when fit for stillness, one rests. My hands cannot walk, nor my feet grasp—just as fish cannot fly nor birds run. Heaven cannot make lotuses bloom in winter or chrysanthemums in spring; Earth cannot make oranges from Luoyang grow in Wen or badgers from Wen thrive in Luoyang. How much less can one defy their own strengths—or others’ strengths! To force what contradicts the strengths of form and spirit is harm—where then is the Way?"*

Master Guan Yin said: *"Those who speak little are not resented by others. Those who act little are not criticized by others. Those with little wisdom are not wearied by others. Those with few abilities are not enslaved by others."*

Bao Yi Zi said: *"Those who speak much are resented by others. Those who act much are criticized by others. Those with much wisdom are wearied by others. Those with many abilities are enslaved by others—all these bring regret and misfortune. How can one not be cautious?*

Master Guan Yin said: *"Hold to sincerity, act with simplicity, treat others with forbearance, respond with silence—thus my Way knows no end."*

Bao Yi Zi said: *"In dealing with affairs and engaging with others, one must not lack sincerity; without sincerity, virtue is lost—thus in sincerity, one grasps and preserves it. One must not lack simplicity; without simplicity, the spirit is wearied—thus in simplicity, one acts and accords with it. One must not lack forbearance; without forbearance, anger is not restrained. One must not lack silence; without silence, schemes are not kept secret. When these four are fully realized, how can my Way know any end?"*

Master Guan Yin said: *"Plan according to the matter, decide according to principle, act through others, and let success come from Heaven. In affairs, take the present as your teacher; in principle, take the ancients as your teacher. In affairs, align with others; in the Way, walk alone."*

Bao Yi Zi said: *"When planning present affairs, take present affairs as your teacher. Just as a skilled archer learns from the bow, not from Yi, and a skilled boatman learns from the boat, not from Yi—such models are not far off. When deciding the principle of a matter, take the ancients as your teacher; the sages of old weighed principles exhaustively, beyond what people today can match. In acting through others, one cannot but share their likes and dislikes. Since it is called ‘affairs,’ acted through others and completed by Heaven, how dare I cling to my own judgments? As for the Way, it is for me alone to walk."*

Master Guan Yin said: *"Gold and jade are hard to relinquish; earth and stone are easy to discard. Those who study the Way, when encountering subtle words or wondrous conduct, must not cling to them. These may be practiced but not grasped. If one grasps them, they become a disease of the heart and core—no medicine can cure it."*

Bao Yi Zi said: *"When scholars gain a single good word or hear a single good deed, they cling to it earnestly and do not lose it—this may be called love of learning. Yet they do not know this can perfect virtue but cannot enter the Way. The Way is like a bright and pure spirit-terrace, where not a single thing lingers—only then may one hope to attain it. If one grasps subtle words or wondrous conduct in the heart, it becomes a disease of the heart and core—no medicine can cure it. Why? Earth and stone are easy to pick up; gold and jade are hard to relinquish. Subtle words and wondrous conduct enter the heart’s storehouse and are never forgotten. As the ancients said: ‘A single phrase that accords with the Way is a post to which a donkey is tied for ten thousand kalpas.’ How true!"*

Master Guan Yin said: *"People who do not understand urgent matters and instead pursue many affairs, other affairs, or strange affairs—poverty, distress, and disaster befall them. They do not know the Way is present in all things and cannot be abandoned here to seek it there."*

Bao Yi Zi said: *"Scholars of the world trust the strange and not the constant, favor the odd and not the proper. Thus they pursue strange affairs, other affairs, and many affairs, neglecting their fundamental work, abandoning their regular livelihood, and losing their means of sustenance. The Way is not yet seen, but poverty, distress, and disaster arrive first. They do not know that in daily use and constant conduct, the Way is present in all things. Thus one must understand urgent matters. What are urgent matters? For a child, serving parents is urgent; for a father, teaching children is urgent; for a subordinate, serving superiors is urgent; for a superior, bringing peace to subordinates is urgent. For scholars, their conduct and work are urgent; for farmers, plowing and sericulture are urgent; for artisans, their tools and vessels are urgent; for merchants, the circulation of goods is urgent. These are all urgent matters—how can one abandon these to seek others? If these urgent matters are settled and one still has strength left to seek the Way, then the Way is already within them."*

Master Guan Yin said: *"Among the principles of the world, abandoning the close for the distant, the root for the branch, the worthy for the foolish, the near for the far—these may be done briefly, but if prolonged, harm arises."*

Bao Yi Zi said: *"This chapter further clarifies the previous one’s meaning. It speaks of scholars who abandon the close for the distant, the root for the branch, the worthy for the foolish, the near for the far—and yet gain something of the Way. This may be done briefly, but if prolonged, harm arises."*

Master Guan Yin said: *"Those who discussed the Way in the past spoke of it as ‘serene stillness,’ ‘profound depth,’ ‘lucid clarity,’ ‘empty sameness,’ or ‘obscure darkness.’ Do not encounter such words and retreat in fear. The supreme principle of the world utterly transcends speech and thought. If one knows it is beyond speech and thought, above subtle words and wondrous meanings, then one accords with my teaching."*

Bao Yi Zi said: *"Since ancient times, the sages’ words and teachings have differed in their expressions but shared the same return to the Way. Some spoke of ‘serene stillness,’ some of ‘lucid clarity,’ some of ‘empty sameness,’ some of ‘obscure darkness.’ Scholars who encounter these must not retreat in fear. The Way is not in words or meanings—how can words and meanings exhaust the Way? It is above subtle words and wondrous meanings that one accords with the sages’ teaching."*

Master Guan Yin said: *"The great words of sages are like gold and jade; their small words are like platycodon and plantain. When used appropriately, platycodon and plantain give life; when used inappropriately, gold and jade bring death."*

Bao Yi Zi said: *"The sages’ words—those refined are like gold and jade; those coarse are like stalks and herbs. The ancients said: ‘Whispered words and humble speech all return to the supreme Way.’ There are those who awaken to the Way through humble speech, and those who study refined words yet do not awaken. Like medicine: when used appropriately, even herbs and grasses give life; when used inappropriately, even gold and jade bring death. What matters is not the medicine’s value but its appropriateness."*

Master Guan Yin said: *"When speaking of a certain matter, one says it is beneficial, another says it is harmful, a third says it may be beneficial or harmful, a fourth says it is both beneficial and harmful—it must fall into one of these. But those who speak of the Way do not speak."*

Ao Yi Zi said: *"The Dao and affairs differ—affairs have benefit and harm, so when speaking of affairs, there is the principle that some words hit the mark of benefit, others the mark of harm. But when speaking of the Dao, there is never the principle that some words hit the Dao, others miss it. Thus, those who skillfully illustrate the Dao do not speak."*

Master Guan Yin said: *"Affairs have their place in affairs, and words about them have their principles. The Dao has no place in the Dao, and words about it have no principles. Know that words have no principles, and every word is the Dao. Not knowing that words have no principles, even holding the most perfect words, they become obstacles and veils."*

Ao Yi Zi said: *"The Dao and affairs are interrelated, like water and fire, day and night—they do not accompany each other. If scholars speak of the Dao as they speak of affairs, they err. Speaking of affairs, affairs have their place, so words about affairs have principles. Speaking of the Dao, it is without place and without absence of place—how can words about the Dao have what is called principle? If one knows that the Dao has no principle to be spoken of, then every word is the Dao. If not, even holding the most perfect words, they are but obstacles and veils."*

Master Guan Yin said: *"It is easy not to believe fools, difficult not to believe the worthy. It is easy not to believe the worthy, difficult not to believe sages. It is easy not to believe one sage, difficult not to believe a thousand sages. Those who do not believe a thousand sages see no others outside, no self within, no Dao above, no affairs below."*

Ao Yi Zi said: *"In learning the Dao, one enters through the gate of self-trust. If one is not steadfast in the Dao, there is no way to enter. Yet trusting sages and worthies is easy; trusting the mad and foolish is difficult. If one can trust even the most mad and foolish, then one’s trust may be called steadfast. But what I call trust is not what the world calls trust. The world’s trust is trust in trust; my trust is trust in non-trust. If one does not trust the mad and foolish, the world can all trust my non-trust. But if one does not trust the worthy, the world will not yet trust my non-trust. How much less if one does not trust sages? Would the world believe such non-trust? And how much more if one does not trust ten thousand sages? This is a teaching the world finds most difficult to believe. Only one who can trust my non-trust in ten thousand sages—such trust may be called true trust. Such a person sees no others outside, no self within, no Dao above, no affairs below."*

Master Guan Yin said: *"The sage’s words are dim and hazy, to make people deaf. The sage’s words are dark and obscure, to make people blind. The sage’s words are deep and heavy, to make people mute. Only the deaf do not hear sound; only the blind do not see form; only the mute do not utter words. Not hearing sound, they do not hear the Dao, do not hear affairs, do not hear the self. Not seeing form, they do not see the Dao, do not see affairs, do not see the self. Not uttering words, they do not speak of the Dao, do not speak of affairs, do not speak of the self."*

Ao Yi Zi said: *"Once a student asked his master: ‘If a person afflicted with blindness, deafness, and muteness comes to see you, what medicine would you prescribe?’ The master said: ‘Come closer.’ The student stepped forward and stood before him. The master raised his palm and asked: ‘What is this?’ The student said: ‘A palm.’ The master shouted him away, saying: ‘You are not afflicted with the three ailments.’ Alas! This person heard the master’s words and stepped forward—so he was not deaf. He could see the palm—so he was not blind. He said ‘palm’—so he was not mute. Yet when he first posed the question, he seemed to understand this principle; but when the master examined him, his true nature was revealed. The *Cantong Qi* says: ‘The ear, eye, and mouth are three treasures—firmly seal them, do not let them open and communicate.’ The *Yinfu Jing* says: ‘The depravities of the nine orifices lie in the three essentials—through them, movement and stillness can be activated.’ This is of the same purport. Alas! How can one find those who do not hear sound, do not see form, do not utter words, and commune with them in understanding?"*

Master Guan Yin said: *"People only know that in false gains there are true losses, and do not realize that in true gains there are true losses. They only know that in false affirmations there are true negations, and do not realize that in true affirmations there are true negations."*

Ao Yi Zi said: *"All under heaven who study know that in false gains there are true losses, and in false affirmations there are true negations. Thus they seek true gains to be gains, true affirmations to be affirmations. Yet they do not know that the Dao has no gains or losses, no affirmations or negations. As soon as there are gains and losses, affirmations and negations, it is affairs, not the Dao. If one studies the Dao and suddenly encounters strange things or strange visions, stubbornly holding them to be true gains or true affirmations, often one is seized by demons and does not awaken to their being true losses or true negations."*

Master Guan Yin said: *"Speaking of the Dao is like speaking of dreams. Those who speak of dreams say: ‘There was such gold and jade, such vessels, such birds and beasts.’ The speaker can speak of them but cannot take them and give them. The listener can hear them but cannot receive and obtain them. Only the good listener does not cling or discriminate."*

Ao Yi Zi said: *"This analogy is most apt—speaking of the Dao to others is truly like speaking of dreams. The speaker says: ‘I dreamed of great wealth and honor.’ The listener says: ‘I neither see nor know it.’ The speaker says: ‘I truly had this dream—you must believe it.’ The listener says: ‘Since I neither see nor know it, how can I believe?’ The speaker cannot take and show it, so says the listener is unwise. The listener cannot obtain and see it, so says the speaker is untruthful. Thus, for the speaker, speaking is no better than not speaking; for the listener, hearing is no better than not discriminating. The ancients said: ‘Knowing the Dao is easy; not speaking of it is difficult. Hearing the Dao is easy; silently comprehending it is difficult.’ Thus, the good listener does not seek the Dao in words but silently comprehends their unspoken purport."*

If one clings to the words and disputes their substance, how can one be considered a good listener or a good learner? Master Guan Yin appended this chapter at the end precisely for such learners, intending that they contemplate these profound words without clinging to them or disputing them, and silently comprehend their unspoken purport.

Master Guan Yin said: "Make your Dao round, your virtue square, your conduct level, your affairs sharp."
Master Baoyi said: "If the Dao is not round, it lacks spirit; if virtue is not square, it lacks rectitude; if conduct is not level, it lacks constancy; if affairs are not sharp, they lack efficacy."

As Master Guan Yin’s subtle words and wondrous meanings drew to a close, he yet feared that learners might aspire to the Dao while forgetting virtue, establish virtue while neglecting conduct, or accumulate conduct while abandoning affairs. Such a one knows only to attend to the root but not to the branches—yet there has never been one who, by harming the branches, did not also harm the root.

In this world, there are those who, through the failure of affairs, impair their conduct; there are those who, through the impairment of conduct, damage their virtue; and there are those who, through the damage of virtue, obstruct the Dao. How can a learner attend solely to the Dao without relying on virtue and conduct to support it? And how can one accumulate virtue and conduct yet fail to apply diligence when encountering affairs?

There are also those who aspire to the Dao yet remain steeped in depravity, neglecting virtue and conduct, or who abandon their duties and forsake their affairs. How could they know that the sagely teachings, in establishing words and bequeathing instruction, encompass both substance and function, root and branch, in such exhaustive detail?

Alas! The compassion of the great sage Master Guan Yin for later generations is utmost, complete, and beyond all reckoning.

*Waizhi, Scroll Nine of the* Wenshi Zhenjing*, concludes here.*

**Postscript by Immortal Ge**

Ge Zhi of Danyang said: Hong possesses the humble endowment of mugwort and wormwood, yet by chance I cherish the longevity of towering pines. Those who know the Dao, though lowly, I necessarily draw near; though barbarian, I necessarily honor.

Later, I encountered Master Zheng, who possessed many books of jade tablets and jasper bamboo slips. Through elixirs and herbs, he opened for me the finest medicines of the supreme Dao; through breath and absorption, he cleansed me with the purest flavors of violet clarity. Thereafter, he entrusted me with the *Guan Yinzi*. I have ever loved it, recited it, treasured it, and revered it.

The *Yu* (chariot) is the Dao; the *zhu* (pillar) is the establishment of Heaven and Earth; the *ji* (ridgepole) is the veneration of the sage; the *fu* (tally) is the spirit, soul, and ethereal soul; the *jian* (mirror) is the heart; the *bi* (spoon) is sustenance; the *fu* (cauldron) is transformation; the *chou* (tally-stick) is things; the *yao* (medicine) is miscellaneous remedies.

With each savoring, I am as if lightly treading upon flying leaves, roaming the primordial chaos of Heaven and Earth; as if heavily stepping upon a horizontal staff, floating upon the vast expanse of the great sea. I ascend as though dwelling in a palace of gold, jade, and precious stones; I stand firm as though wielding the seal of ghosts, demons, and malevolent spirits. In an instant, I soar like a phoenix; in fury, I battle like tigers and rhinoceroses. I am pure as though bathing in azure; I am somber as though dreaming of crimson. I seize and release the great Dao, merging with the primordial principle. Such depths are unattainable to alchemists, unspoken by former scholars—lofty yet beyond reach, delightful yet ungraspable, reflective yet unthinkable, resonant yet unmatchable.

Is this not the speech of those who forget things and forsake the world? Is it not the speech of those who sever ties and abandon cunning? Is it not the speech of those who harmonize with yin and yang, obscuring self and other? How exalted, how vast, and yet how simple it is!

Fortunate indeed was I to receive it in person. Respectfully inscribed on the first day of the fifth month in the second year of Xianhe by Ge Hong of Danyang, amidst the smoke of the stove.
