#### **Discourse on the White Horse**

**Question:** May it be said that a white horse is not a horse?
**Answer:** It may.

Those who hear subtle words and illuminate the kingly Way do not fail to establish guest and host, to engage in exchange and response, to borrow a single thing as the origin of the myriad transformations, and to lodge their discourse in words to rectify the errors of self and other. Thus, they raise the example of the white horse to confound sameness and difference.

**Question:** How so?
**Answer:** "Horse" is that by which form is named; "white" is that by which color is named. To name form and color is not to name form alone; hence, it is said that a white horse is not a horse.

The form of a horse illustrates that the forms of the myriad things are all material and functional; the color of a horse exemplifies that the kinds of the myriad things each have near and distant relations. To nurture the myriad things is to bring the world into accord; to preserve near and distant relations in dealing with others is to incite rebellion within the seas.

For example, if one separates color from the naming of a horse, all horses respond; if one clings to whiteness in seeking a horse, only a white horse is obtained. Thus, to name the form of a horse while clinging to a single white color is not to name the multitude of horses.

**Question:** If there is a white horse, it cannot be said there is no horse. That which cannot be said to be without a horse is not a horse. Since there is a white horse, it cannot be said there is no horse—then is a white horse not a horse? If having a white horse is having a horse, why is whiteness not a horse? If white and horse are conjoined yet white is not a horse, why is this so?

**Answer:** In seeking a horse, a yellow or black horse may both be obtained; in seeking a white horse, a yellow or black horse may not be obtained. Among all things, those that are near are few, and those that are distant are many—just as whiteness is but one among the multitude of colors.

Thus, if one separates whiteness in seeking a horse, yellow and black horses both arrive; if one names a horse while including whiteness, all other colors depart. The Way of cherishing harmony is likewise.

If a white horse were indeed a horse, then what is sought would be one and the same, and what is sought would be whiteness, no different from a horse. If a white horse were considered to be a horse, it would be but one horse, its material no different from that of other horses—just as the ruler’s favored one is but a single person, his worth no different from that of others.

The human heart does not remain constant toward one ruler, just as the form of a horse is not confined to one color. Thus, when the ruler loves one, they draw near; when the ruler distances them, they rebel. How can one favor one’s kin and distance the world?

What is sought is no different from a yellow or black horse—sometimes obtainable, sometimes not. Why is this? Obtainable and unobtainable are clearly distinct; thus, a yellow or black horse is one and the same. It may respond to "having a horse" but not to "having a white horse"—this proves that a white horse is not a horse.

Though a yellow or black horse is each a single horse, no different from a horse, it cannot respond [to "white horse"]. Why can the multitude of horses not respond to "white horse"? White is not yellow, yellow is not white—the five colors are clearly distinct in their mutual exclusions.

If a ruler treats others with partiality, others will likewise respond with partiality and rebel against the ruler. Will they willingly obey the ruler’s command? Thus, one who clings to whiteness in naming a horse cannot truly summon the multitude of horses.

**Question:** If having color is taken to mean a horse is not a horse, yet there are no colorless horses in the world, can it be said there are no horses in the world? If having color is taken to mean a horse is not a horse, yet all horses in the world have color, how can it be said there are no horses? Just as all people have near and distant relations, it cannot be said there are no people.

**Answer:** Horses inherently have color, hence there are white horses. If horses had no color, there would be horses as such—how then could there be white horses? Thus, whiteness is not a horse.

For example, horses all have color, hence there are white horses. If horses were originally without color and there were only horses as such, then how could there be white horses? Just as people must arise from kinds and clans, hence there are distinctions between Hua and Yi, if there were originally no lineages and only people as such, how could there be near and distant relations? Thus, whiteness is itself itself, not a horse.

A white horse is horse and white. Horse and white horse—hence it is said: a white horse is not a horse. Since white is not a horse, white and horse are two things. To combine two things into a single body is not to refer to it exclusively as a horse. Thus, using horse to illustrate white, a white horse is not a horse.

**Question:** Before horse is conjoined with white, it is a horse; before white is conjoined with horse, it is white. Combining horse and white to name it "white horse" is to use what is not conjoined to name what is conjoined—this is impermissible. Thus, it is impermissible to say a white horse is not a horse.

This is the guest restating the host’s position and challenging it.

Horse is of the same kind as horse; white is of the same kind as white—hence it is said they are conjoined. Horse is not conjoined with white to be a horse; white is not conjoined with horse to be white—hence it is said they are not conjoined. Combining horse and white to name it "white horse" is to forcibly use white color as the name for horse—this meaning is impermissible. Thus, it is impermissible to say a white horse is not a horse.

The above "impermissible" is the host’s position; the following "impermissible" is the guest’s challenge.

**Question:** If having a white horse is having a horse, may having a white horse be said to be having a yellow horse?
**Answer:** It may not.

The host questions the guest: If one firmly takes a white horse to be having a horse, can a white horse be said to be a yellow horse?
The guest replies: It may not.

**Answer:** To take having a horse as distinct from having a yellow horse is to distinguish a yellow horse from a horse. To distinguish a yellow horse from a horse is to take a yellow horse as not a horse. If a white horse is taken to be having a horse, yet a yellow horse cannot be a white horse, then a yellow horse is not a horse. Those who cling rigidly to this have never avoided error.

To take a yellow horse as not a horse while taking a white horse as having a horse is like a flying creature entering a pond or a coffin and outer coffin being in separate places—this is the world’s perverse speech and disordered discourse.

Yellow and white are colors; the multitude of horses are forms. To forcibly take color as form is what is meant by "a flying creature entering a pond." The yellow horse and white horse are both horses, yet to select the white and discard the yellow is what is meant by "the coffin and outer coffin being in separate places." Generally, the coffin and outer coffin depend on one another, just as lips and teeth rely on each other—once the lips are gone, the teeth grow cold; they cannot be in separate places. The four barbarians guard the outer lands, while the Central States rely on the inner; when inner and outer depend on one another, the world is at peace. If one favors the Central States and estranges the barbarians, then the barbarians will rebel. To muster troops and attack distant lands, so that the people cannot bear the burden, is to throw the Central States into chaos. With inner division and outer rebellion, the coffin and outer coffin in separate places—then what one has favored cannot alone support the ruler. Thus, to discard the yellow and take the white is the height of perversity and disorder.

It is said: To have a white horse cannot be called having no horse—this is what is meant by "separating the white." Without separation, to have a white horse cannot be called having a horse. Therefore, what makes having a horse is solely taking the horse as having a horse, not taking the white horse as having a horse. Thus, its being having a horse cannot be called "horse-horse."

The guest says: To separate the white is to have a horse; not to separate is to have a non-horse. But if the form of the horse and the color of the horse are firmly conjoined, this is two horses sharing a single body, and cannot be called "horse-horse." Hence, one speaks of "white horse."

It is said: The white is not fixed to what it whitens—one may forget it. All things universally possess the color white, hence it is said "not fixed to what it whitens." Since white is not fixed to the horse, the horse is not exclusively white. Thus, to forget color in seeking the horse is to have all horses respond. To forget partiality in cherishing others is to have all under heaven cherished.

The white horse speaks of white, fixing what it whitens—what is fixed to whiten is not white. What fixes white to the horse is the horse’s white; how can it be white on its own? The horse makes no rejection or selection of color, hence yellow and black follow in response. To speak simply of "horse" is to make no rejection or selection among colors. Without selection, the horse responds to all; without rejection, all colors are present.

Thus, the sage is serene and forgetful, governing things with emptiness. Therefore, nothing is not ordered, and principle is fully realized. The white horse makes a selection of color, so yellow and black horses are rejected by color. Thus, only the white horse alone can respond. To discard the yellow and take the white is to have all horses guard their own colors, each becoming distinct and departing. Thus, only the white horse alone responds.

The ruler who favors what is partial and estranges all under heaven causes all under heaven to guard their estrangement, each becoming distinct and rebelling. When all under heaven rebels, who will respond to the ruler’s command? Will it be those he favors? Those he favors alone respond, but his command only increases disaster and cannot quell disorder.

What makes no rejection is not what makes a rejection. Thus, it is said: The white horse is not a horse. Not to select the white is not to reject the yellow. Not to reject color means that color and horse have no power to reject. Thus, it is said: What makes no rejection is not what makes a rejection.

Generally, yellow and white in the horse are like closeness and distance in people. To favor the close and turn away from the distant is to have the distant rebel. When the distant departs and rebels, the close cannot survive alone. Thus, it is said: The white horse is not a horse.

Therefore, the sage empties the heart and illumines with mystery, unifying all principles. Embracing the six directions within the breast, his spirit鉴 is abundant; mirroring the ten thousand images within a square inch, his spirit grows ever more still. Thus, he can be among the close without attachment, among the distant without estrangement. Though he makes no selection of closeness or distance, he also does not abandon closeness or distance. This is how the four seas are equally close and the ten thousand states are united as one.

**On Pointing at Things**
There is nothing that is not pointed at, yet pointing is not pointing. Things and I have distinct capacities, yet nothing does not point to another. Thus, it is said: There is nothing that is not pointed at. What points to another points to right and wrong. When this and that mutually displace each other, right and wrong become one, returning to no pointing. Thus, it is said: Yet pointing is not pointing.

If there were no pointing in the world, nothing could be called a thing. All pointing is called right and wrong. That there is nothing that is not pointed at means that the nature of all things necessarily involves mutual right and wrong. If there were no things of right and wrong in the world, then there would not be a single thing that could be called a thing. Thus, where there are things, there is mutual right and wrong. Therefore, there is nothing that is not pointed at.

If pointing is not pointing in the world, can things be called pointing? That there is nothing that is not pointed at, yet it is called "not pointing," means that the world is equalized—how can things be called pointing? All things falsely point to one another, hence all pointing is not pointing.

Pointing is what the world does not possess; things are what the world possesses. To take what the world possesses as what the world does not possess is impermissible. There is not a single day when the world lacks things, nor a single thing that is not fitting. Thus, to forcibly take things as pointing is impermissible.

If there is no pointing in the world, things cannot be called pointing. That there is no right and wrong in the world means that each thing fits its fitting and cannot be called right and wrong. Thus, there is no right and wrong. That things cannot be called pointing means they are not pointing. For example, water and fire have distinct natures, each fitting its use. Since there is no right and wrong, how can they be called right and wrong?

That pointing is not pointing means there is nothing that is not pointed at. That is, the things that are not pointing all falsely point to one another. That there is no pointing in the world and things cannot be called pointing does not mean there is "not pointing." That things cannot be called pointing means there is no right and wrong. Not only is there no right and wrong, there is also no absence of right and wrong. Thus, it is said: There is no "not pointing."

That there is no "not pointing" means there is nothing that is not pointed at. That there is nothing that is not pointed at means that pointing is not pointing. Because there is no absence of right and wrong, the ten thousand things all mutually affirm and negate. Thus, it is said: That there is no "not pointing" means there is nothing that is not pointed at.

When both right and wrong and the absence of right and wrong are forgotten, one may engage in right and wrong all day yet remain free of right and wrong. Thus it is said: "There is nothing that is not pointed at, yet pointing is not pointing." The absence of pointing in the world arises from things each having their names and not serving as pointers. Things possess their realities and each has its name—like Wang Liang’s skill in driving or Li Shou’s mastery of calculation—each thing serves its own function. Take the ears and eyes, for example: neither can be dispensed with, so they do not serve as right and wrong. To call what does not serve as a pointer a "pointer" is to include what does not serve as a pointer. All things do not serve as pointers; yet when some are called pointers, it is because things mutually affirm and negate one another, and this affirmation and negation cannot be fixed. Thus, they do not serve as pointers. To say that because there is what does not serve as a pointer, there is nothing that does not serve as a pointer, is not permissible. *Zhi* (之) means "to suit." What does not serve as a pointer refers to things; what is called "nothing that does not serve as a pointer" refers to pointing. Because things suit pointing, it is not permissible.

Moreover, "pointing" encompasses all under heaven. Sometimes one thing has two names of right and wrong; sometimes things mutually point to one another—all are called "encompassing." That there is no pointing in the world does not mean things can be called "without pointing." That they cannot be called "without pointing" means there is no "not pointing." The names of right and wrong arise from things mutually opposing one another. Thus, it is said that things cannot be called "without," for among the ten thousand things there is no pointing, yet also no absence of pointing. Thus, it is said: "There is no 'not pointing.'" That there is no "not pointing" means there is nothing that is not pointed at. To say there is no right and wrong arises from things, yet there is nothing that is not pointed at. Therefore, the sage seeks the person within right and wrong and thereby attains the person free of right and wrong.

Pointing is not "not pointing"; pointing and things are not pointing. To call it "pointing" is not to say there is no pointing. Since pointing cannot serve as pointing for things, it is not pointing. If there were no things in the world to point, who would directly call it "not pointing"? If there were no things in the world, who would directly call it "pointing"? If there were no things and no pointing in the world, all would be still—who then would call pointing "not pointing"? Who would call pointing "pointing"? If there is pointing in the world but no things to point, who would directly call it "not pointing" or "not pointing because there are no things"? If there were pointing but no things to apply it to, who would call pointing "not pointing"? Who would say it is "not pointing because there are no things"? Clearly, there is originally no pointing.

Moreover, pointing inherently is not pointing—why must it depend on things to serve as pointing? When mutually examined, pointing itself is without pointing; how then can it serve as pointing for things? Clearly, the ten thousand things are each distinct, each serving its own purpose, without right and wrong. Therefore, the sage maintains threefold silence, at ease and expansive, forgetting right and forgetting wrong, not pursuing one ability nor neglecting one thing.

**Imperial Edict of the Tianbao Era**
By the grace of august Heaven and the favor of the ancestral spirits, the rites of reverent illumination are preserved in the ancestral canon. Zhuangzi, Wenzi, Liezi, and Kangcangzi are ranked among the perfected immortals. Embracing this emptiness and purity, they followed the sacred teachings of the Primordial Sage and propagated the great Dao throughout the human realm. Henceforth, the *Zhuangzi* shall be titled the *True Scripture of Southern Florescence*, the *Liezi* the *True Scripture of Thoroughgoing Emptiness*, the *Wenzi* the *True Scripture of Pervasive Mystery*, and the *Kangcangzi* the *True Scripture of Penetrating Spirit*. Issued on the twentieth day of the second month, the first year of the Tianbao era.

**Preface to the *True Scripture of Southern Florescence***
*By Guo Xiang*

Zhuangzi may be said to have known the root. Thus, he never concealed his wild words. His words, though without convergence, uniquely respond—yet to respond without convergence, even if apt, is of no use. Words that do not pertain to things and affairs, though lofty, cannot be put into practice. There is indeed a difference between this and those who remain still and unmoving, rising only when compelled. He may be called one who knows the mind without mind. When the mind is without contrivance, it responds to stimuli as they come, adapting to the moment, speaking only with caution. Thus, he embodied transformation, flowing through the ages and obscuring things. How could he have set up oppositions, encountered alone, and discoursed beyond the realm? This is why his work, though not canonical, stands at the head of the hundred schools.

Yet though Zhuangzi did not fully embody it, his words reached the utmost. They unify the thread of heaven and earth, order the natures of the ten thousand things, comprehend the transformations of life and death, and illuminate the Dao of inner sageliness and outer kingship. Above, he knew that creation has no things; below, he knew that things create themselves. His words are vast, his intent profound—uttermost Dao, subtle and refined, serene and unconstrained. Unconstrained yet not arrogant, thus it is said: "Not knowing where righteousness leads, wildly roaming yet treading the great square." Chewing and rejoicing in simplicity, drumming the belly and wandering in boundlessness. The perfected person reaches the extreme of no attachments; filial piety and compassion ultimately end in mutual forgetting. Ritual and music return to one’s innate abilities; loyalty and trust arise from celestial radiance. Using this radiance, one’s simplicity naturally forms. Thus, the numinous vessel transforms alone in the realm of profound obscurity, its source deep and its flow long.

Therefore, where its long waves surge and its lofty winds blow, it harmonizes with the fittingness of things and accords with the people’s wishes. It broadens the narrow, resolves entanglements, and without applying the work of detachment, disperses self-importance and boasting. Thus, reading his book, one feels transcendent, as if one has already attained it—traversing Kunlun, crossing the great void, and wandering the courts of the indistinct and vague. Even the greedy and restless, the ambitious and hasty, if they but briefly grasp its lingering fragrance and taste its overflowing stream, catching even a faint echo of its resonance, may yet feel vast and free, forgetting form and attaining self-contentment. How much more those who delve into its distant depths and savor its eternal years? Thus, it extends far and wide, pure and remote, departing from dust and returning to the ultimate obscurity.

**Preface to the *Subcommentary on the True Scripture of Southern Florescence***
*By Cheng Xuanying*

Zhuangzi expounds the deep roots of virtue and power, elucidates the wondrous purport of the profound mystery, unfolds the tranquility of non-action, and clarifies the obscure obscurity of solitary transformation. He bridles the nine schools and encompasses the hundred masters, truly the ultimate teaching within the realm, the subtle words beyond images.

The man’s surname was Zhuang, given name Zhou, courtesy name Zixiu. He was born in Meng County of Suiyang in the state of Song, studied under Master Sangzi, and received the title "Immortal of Southern Florescence." At the beginning of the Warring States period, as the declining Zhou dynasty neared its end, he lamented the meager karmic lot of the common people and grieved the erosion of the Dao and virtue. Thus, with fervent resolve, he composed this discourse. His words are vast and expansive, his purport profound and far-reaching—beyond the grasp of lesser scholars or the shallow-minded.

The term *zi* is an honorific for one of virtue; in ancient times, a teacher was called *zi*, and here it also serves as the title of the book. It is not merely the collective name for the three Inner Chapters but a general designation for the hundred schools. The term *Inner Chapters* signifies that "inner" is set in contrast to "outer," while *chapters* refers to the binding of bamboo slips. In antiquity, bamboo was cured to make slips, bound with leather thongs to form chapters—akin to modern pages bound into scrolls. Thus, Yuan Kai stated: "Great matters are recorded on *ce*, while minor ones suffice on slips." The Inner Chapters discuss the root of principle, while the Outer Chapters recount events and traces. Though events may be manifest, they are not understood without principle; though principle is subtle and obscure, it is not revealed without events. To first clarify the wondrous principle, the Inner Chapters are placed first. Since the principle in the Inner Chapters is profound, each chapter is given a distinct title beyond the text. Guo Xiang followed this by providing annotations directly beneath the titles, as in *Free and Easy Wandering* and *The Equality of Things*. From the Outer Chapters onward, titles are taken from the first two characters of each chapter, as in *Webbed Toes* and *Horses’ Hooves*.

Regarding *Free and Easy Wandering*, interpretations have varied across the ages. Here, I broadly outline three key explanations. The first, by Gu Tongbo: *Xiao* means "dissolving," *yao* means "far." Dissolving the burdens of deliberate action and perceiving afar the principle of non-action, one wanders the world—hence *Free and Easy Wandering*. The second, by Zhi Daolin: "Treating things as things without being ensnared by them, one is thus free, unbound by external constraints. The mysterious resonance is swift without haste, hence far-reaching in all directions. Wandering the world thus, it is called *Free and Easy Wandering*." The third, by Wang Mu’ye: "*Free and Easy* is the name for unrestrained self-contentment. With perfect virtue inwardly full, one is ever at ease. Forgetting both self and things, where does one not penetrate? Wandering the world thus, it is called *Free and Easy Wandering*."

The Inner Chapters clarify the root of principle, while the Outer Chapters recount events and traces. The Miscellaneous Chapters intermingle principle and events. Though the Inner Chapters clarify the root of principle, they are not without events; though the Outer Chapters recount events, they contain profound principle. The division of teachings and chapters is based on what is predominant.

Thus, *Free and Easy Wandering* reveals the beginning: the scholar who attains the Dao possesses wisdom and virtue, bright and keen, all his undertakings harmonious, encountering things with ease—hence the title. The sage who is "without dependence" reflects circumstances like a mirror, discerning both provisional and real wisdom, thus able to equalize the myriad conditions—hence *The Equality of Things* follows. Having pointed to the hooves and the heavens, merging with the common things, with a mind serene and still, one can safeguard and nurture life—hence *The Secret of Caring for Life* follows. With good and evil both forgotten and the interplay of circumstances and wisdom perfected, one can navigate human affairs—hence *The Human World* follows. With inner virtue complete, one can extend it outwardly to engage with things, rising and falling with them while inwardly and outwardly in mysterious accord—hence *Signs of Full Virtue* follows. Like still water holding a reflection, engaging with things without attachment, forgetting virtue and form, uniting inner and outer to their utmost, one can shape and perfect the common lot—hence *The Great and Venerable Teacher* follows. The true sage of antiquity knew heaven and knew man, sharing the work of creation, at once quiescent and responsive, thus able to guide and govern the multitude—hence *Fit for Emperors and Kings* follows.

From *Webbed Toes* onward, chapters are titled by their first two characters, with no further significance. I will not elaborate on their order.

Since ancient times, recluses of the Jin and Han dynasties have all immersed themselves in this work. Its meanings require annotation, and its expositions are seamless. Yet their elegant words all seek the hidden depths. Though I, Xuanying, am unworthy and dull, I have studied it since youth, refining my understanding with deep thought for thirty years. Following Zi Xuan’s commentary on the thirty-three chapters, I have composed this subcommentary, totaling thirty scrolls. Though my words are crude and my intent clumsy, I have striven to convey the heart’s direction and return. I dare not bequeath this to later generations but merely record it to prevent forgetting.

*Miscellaneous Records on the* True Scripture of Southern Florescence *(Part One Concluded)*
*Miscellaneous Records on the* True Scripture of Southern Florescence *(Part Two)*

**Ninefold Testimony of the Heart Precepts, with Preface**
*Composed by Yang Sifu, Minister of Rites*

Sifu—foolish to the utmost, unaware of his own folly and thus perpetuating it. Ever carving and corrupting, seeking praise to adorn himself, he never discerned the swift and facile deceptions that branch into grand delusions, forming a marsh of profound stupidity. Restless in haste, he shunned stillness.

Upon reading Zhuang Zhou’s account of the Nine Evidences of the Sage Confucius, tears streamed down his face. Pressing his hand to his heart, he felt shame and remorse, realizing at last that his expansions and contractions had missed their subtlety, his adaptations their essence. Fire scorched his innards; ice chilled his bones. Following the example of the girdle-bound scholar who composed precepts, he looked up in reverence to the leather-belted admonisher, savoring these words to curb his faults. Casting aside distractions, he took up brush and ink, addressing each matter as it arose, presuming to expound and praise. Though insufficient to fully elucidate the Sage’s work, this effort at least expresses his sighs of awe—all owing to the power of the Nine Evidences.

No peak rivals the height of Taihang; no abyss matches the depth of the ocean’s tides. Things cannot magnify themselves; they are magnified by others. People cannot name themselves; they are named by their deeds. Thus, people may mirror things, and deeds may mirror people. When things are mirrored, their beauty shines without flaw; when people are mirrored, their renown endures without limit. The text of the Nine Evidences is such a mirror for people.

To rescue is to prevent a fall; to support is to avert collapse. Discerning the auspicious path and the virtuous person is like taking good medicine for a grave illness or holding a lamp in the darkest night—endless in gratitude and wonder. Daring to draw parallels, I recall the teachings of Laozi, the divine efficacy of the *Yellow Court*. Reading it ten thousand times, one is certain to ascend. Yet the promise of ascension beguiles the ears of the vulgar. Why? The truly reclusive cultivate their forms, the Dao flowing through their limbs, virtue tilling their five viscera. Thus, the *Inner and Outer Scenes of the Yellow Court* are books for refining body and heart.

People delight in the distant but not the near, despise what they see but not what they hear. They find the easy easy and the unchanging hard, the difficult difficult and the unchallenging simple. Thus, they fabricate palaces of blossoms to extend their doctrines, flaunt gates of jade to exalt their words. Those who align with the Dao attain it through the Dao; those who align with virtue attain it through virtue. Heart hands to heart, mouth transmits to mouth—the essence lies in reading the text and thereby cultivating the heart. Reading the scripture ten thousand times, ears grow sharp, eyes bright, spirit clear, qi refined, defense and nourishment harmonized, the six palaces at peace. Delusions no longer intrude; sinews and bones purify themselves. One joins the true companions of the Upper Clarity, becoming a transcendent of this world.

To name immortals as an analogy is to spur practitioners—yet one must not be bloated with fat, the chest stuffed with scheming, harboring right and wrong, concealing joy and anger. Mouthing the words of the *Yellow Court* while the heart strays from the gates of the azure heavens is like carving compass and square on frost or aligning curves and straight lines in clouds. What merit is there in such exertion? Thus, those who recite the *Yellow Court* do not practice its teachings.

This book of Nine Evidences, when recited ten thousand times and put into action, enables one to distinguish right from wrong, discern disgrace from doubt, sever deceit, and guard against peril. A hundred blessings gather. Then, one’s integrity rivals the green pine, one’s name shines like the sun, equaling the noble men of antiquity and becoming a paragon of the age. Unmatched in character, steadfast and resplendent, one must not be obstinate and aggressive, cunning and oppressive, treading empty paths and courting danger, delighting in flattery and clumsiness. To mouth the words of the Nine Evidences while lacking a single observable deed is like carving rotten wood—no axe can shape it—or tempering rusted iron, which never regains its luster. Such effort is vain, leaving no true trace.

The fish-trap exists for the fish; once the fish is caught, the trap is forgotten. Words exist for meaning; once the meaning is grasped, words are forgotten. Beware of losing the fish while clinging to the trap, or losing the meaning while clinging to words. Such is the man who reads the Nine Evidences but does not practice them. Medicine cures illness only if taken steadfastly; books heal the body only if practiced steadfastly. Steadfast to the utmost, there is nothing they cannot cure. Thus, preserving life and safeguarding destiny requires no less effort than the *Yellow Court*; with a heart serene and body at ease, the Dao flows even more deeply than the *Inner Scene*.

To renounce the ambition of fame and rescue others, aligning with those who dwell in seclusion and avoid affairs—this benefits many, not just oneself. Vast is the aid, enduring the Way of the Sage Confucius. Yet one must not tread the paths of the fortunate, cling to the carriages of elders, utter refined words while concealing true conduct, or seek to transcend self without selflessness. To share a drink is to taste the sweet dew and savor the magic mushroom—this is to ride the clouds and transform like a feather.

The *Virtue Classic* says: "Cultivate it in the self, and one’s virtue becomes true." There has never been one who attained true virtue without cultivation. If one reveres it like the divine, looks up to it like the sun and moon, so that a single word uttered echoes a thousand miles and a single deed performed draws the world like wind—this is the fruit of self-cultivation. There has never been one who attained it without cultivation.

Sifu, now forty-one, has risen to the third rank. Many call this luck. Yet when it comes to lofty reputation and ample profit, most fear falling short. For six or seven years, he has harbored the wish to rescue others, beginning with rescuing himself. But his steps toward the misty clouds, treading the path of rosy dawn, have not brought him close enough to the Milky Way. He fears the grace of rain and dew may not be abundant—this is the greed for fame, not the fear of excess or the caution of one who guards against complacency, nor the wisdom of knowing advance and retreat, life and death. Such a heart remains unresolved.

To bear a debt is to invite bandits’ pursuit. To wait for others to rescue oneself—how can one then rescue oneself? Now, having cleansed his heart and washed his innards, he bears the weight of these virtuous words. Day and night, he trembles as if standing at a deep ravine. He must curb desires, cast off adornments, dispel emotions, and banish delusions. Until his hair turns white, he dares not slacken.

Confucius said: "The human heart is harder to know than Heaven, for Heaven has its seasons—spring, autumn, winter, summer—and its fixed times of dawn and dusk, while man, with his deep countenance and deeper emotions, remains unfathomable." Truly, these words are so.

There are those whose appearance is stern yet whose heart is gentle and compliant; those whose appearance is mild yet whose heart is cruel and fierce; those whose appearance is weak yet whose heart is resolute and bold; those whose appearance is firm yet whose heart is timid and fearful. Some speak fair words yet break their promises; some speak sparingly yet love to domineer; some draw near to ritual yet delight in excess; some boast of their vigor yet lack restraint.

There are those who display the belly of a gentleman yet harbor the heart of a petty man, who parade the patterns of tigers and leopards yet possess the nature of dogs and sheep. There are those who outwardly appear restless yet inwardly remain calm and composed, who do not flaunt their merits but secretly bestow kindness and grace. There are those who govern others with upright words and observe people with a straight path, who feed on dregs yet follow the times, who endure defilement and forsake the vulgar.

There are those who humble themselves before others, who yield in speech yet reflect deeply on their conduct—such are the differences of the heart. Thus, one cannot fully know another. The noble person observes others through these nine matters as a bright mirror gazes upon the face, where not even the finest detail is hidden, as flowing light illuminates objects, where neither curve nor straightness can escape.

If the other advances or does not advance, this reveals their nature; if one retreats or does not retreat, the other perceives it. Through thorough examination, one gains understanding in the heart, and with clear verification, it is stored in the eyes. If among the nine signs one roughly discerns even a single trait, it is like the first leaf of an orchid—who would say it bears no fragrance? Or the first branch of a cassia—surely it is a fine tree.

If two or three traits are discerned, it is like a fishing boat entering a creek, avoiding the muddy currents, or a woodcutter ascending a mountain, shunning the common path. If four or five traits are discerned, it is like the edge of a whetted blade, irresistibly sharp, or the radiance of fine jade, unmatched in beauty.

If six or seven traits are discerned, it is like gold and stone placed in the courtyard, delighting in refined music, or embroidered robes stored in a chest, a joy to behold. If eight or nine traits are discerned, it is like a black dragon emerging from the sea, its light piercing myriad layers, or the roc’s wings soaring high, its fame resounding through the six directions.

If one finds such a person, one should incline one’s heart toward them—who would not strive to emulate them? The lofty are drawn near, the lowly are lifted, the bent are straightened, the sunken are raised, the virtuous are followed as teachers, the humble are befriended, the close are cherished, the distant are treated with courtesy. One who can observe oneself thus is said to observe others as well.

To know the highest is to aspire; to know the lowest is to fear. Cui Ziyu had his *Seat Inscription*, Zhuge Liang had his *Admonition on Self-Examination*—both served to shackle deceit and restrain excess. I dare not presume to imitate the ancients by creating new titles, but wish only to follow them in carving away right and wrong. Thus, I name this *Nine Signs: A Heart’s Admonition*, to serve as a measure for unchanging conduct. What follows is but my humble continuation.

**To Send Them on a Distant Mission and Observe Their Loyalty**
To observe their loyalty, one must test them with deception to know their heart. How can the heart be known? Some, when feigned estrangement drives them away, will harbor resentment in their words; some, when feigned suppression bends their will, will speak with bitterness; some, when falsely accused to stifle their virtues, will speak defiantly; some, when feigned rebuke breaks their edge, will speak insolently.

If one tempts them with profit, their conduct will waver; if one provokes them with subtle words, their heart will stir; if one appeals to their private interests, matters will be easily swayed; if one upholds impartiality, matters will become difficult. These eight are not the marks of loyalty.

The noble person’s heart is clear and boundless, yet the deceptive use of joy, anger, distance, or closeness may stir it. If one incites them without reason, probing their nature, one must await their words to gauge their depth. It is like tempering a blade on a whetstone or cutting jade with sand—if it remains unsullied by dye or unthinned by grinding, that is the Way of the noble person.

The petty man is narrow and base, difficult to enlighten. Not knowing that the wise use falsehood to sift truth, or emptiness to lure substance, he instead grows resentful and opens the gates of misfortune. Words are the sprouts of the heart—by observing them, one discerns gain and loss.

**To Assign Them Nearby Tasks and Observe Their Respect**
To observe their respect, one must also employ feigned right and wrong, advance and retreat, to assail their heart, and their true nature will stand revealed. If one draws near and they do not lose propriety, distances them and they do not speak amiss, angers them and they do not lose courtesy, delights them and they do not lose composure; if they are neither careless nor contemptuous, neither jesting nor frivolous; if they enter a room with dignity, their countenance composed, and leave as if facing a distinguished guest; if in quietude they remain wary, and in jest they grow more solemn; if they do not rely on favor to act recklessly nor wield authority to indulge desires—this is the height of respect.

But if they act as though blind before the worthy or deaf to instruction, delighting in frivolity without shame, taking a lost demeanor as beauty—how can this be called respect? If they are flogged in the marketplace and grow lazy when treated with familiarity, arrogant when drawn close, impure when urged, and muddied when mixed; if their conduct lacks any principle and their words are not weighed thrice; if they fail in vigilance—none of this is respect.

Thus, when the noble person receives extraordinary favor, they must be wary of petty men; when they receive extraordinary fortune, they must guard against ruin through neglect of courtesy and loss of respect.

**To Overwhelm Them with Tasks and Observe Their Ability**
People are hard to trust, for those who boast of themselves are many. To assess talent, one must first test it. Entrust them with numerous duties, overwhelm their minds, and wait to see if they falter—thus one discerns the capable from the inferior.

The capable will govern with calm and surely succeed, not sowing discord to hatch schemes. They will be present yet seem absent, abundant yet appear sparse. If they seize opportunities to indulge their will or rely on affairs to impose on others; if their beginning and end conflict, their principles break, and their commands fail; if their grand strategies are complete in inception yet lacking in conclusion, and their certain achievements rise only to fall—such are not the marks of ability.

In the first year of the Taihe reign, the dingwei year, summer, the fourth month, the eleventh day, respectfully inscribed.

When right and wrong arise in chaos, the ears and eyes know not what to follow; strategies multiply in conflict, and the heart cannot hold its ground. Lacking clarity and understanding, one becomes overwhelmed by affairs, sinking into distress as if drunk, unable to meet deadlines without scattering the mind and soul. Thus exhausted and weakened, how can one accomplish anything? The capable, however, remedy flaws as if ever insufficient, manage crises with ease, dwell amidst excellence without ostentation, and mend many flaws without ruin. Their achievements grow, yet they remain humble; their governance expands, yet they grow more cautious. They do not seek empty praise to advance themselves, nor are they swayed by deceitful schemes to harm the public—this is the essence of managing complexity.

**Test them with sudden questions to assess their wisdom.**
When asked unexpectedly about what they have not considered, if their responses are reasoned and coherent, this is wisdom. As the *Book of Songs* says: *"Both enlightened and wise, they preserve themselves."* If one speaks without thought, how can it be called enlightenment? If one responds without propriety, how can it be called wisdom? The ability to answer sudden questions lies in adaptability. Even in distress, one who can adapt and think anew when at an impasse follows the Way of the noble person. As the saying goes: *"Observe their words to know their wisdom,"* for caution in speech ensures it is not lightly given. Only in times of change can one avoid relying on deceit or clinging to crookedness; those whose words are incisive yet principles clear, whose path is straight yet foresight far-reaching—these are the truly wise. But if one seizes upon words to form intentions, hastily creating steps for gain or loss; if one exploits opportunities for schemes, planting the seeds of arrogance—this is base and unworthy of being called wisdom.

Water, in relation to man, stops when dammed and flows when released; the key lies in reinforcing the dikes and guarding against overflow. Human speech is like water, and the mouth is its dike—how can one not guard against overflow and harm? One must deliberate before speaking.

**Press them with urgent demands to assess their trustworthiness.**
What is easy in leisure becomes difficult under pressure—those who endure difficulty demonstrate trustworthiness. Trust is the guiding principle of all conduct, the linchpin of all virtues. Should it falter, it will surely invite calamity. Why? The three luminaries move without end, the four seasons proceed without speech—this is the trust of Heaven. Nurturing all things according to their high and low stations, fostering growth according to depth and shallowness—this is the trust of Earth. Manifesting sacred power in five colors, bearing auspicious omens in double rings—this is the trust of the sun. Shining like a mirror when hidden, waxing and waning like a hook—this is the trust of the moon. Discarding weapons and provisions to issue warnings, gazing upon the linchpin to uphold sincerity—this is the trust of man. If Heaven loses trust, cold and heat reverse; if Earth loses trust, all things wither; if the two luminaries lose trust, their light wanes. If man loses trust, virtue finds no home. The words of the noble person are trustworthy and verifiable, so resentment and blame stay far from them. The words of the petty person are false and unverifiable, thus unworthy of trust—would they not rather flee blame? Who, then, could save them?

**Entrust them with wealth to assess their benevolence.**
Place great profit before them and observe their hearts in secret. If deceit does not arise, this is benevolence.

A mirror of clarity is unstained by dust or grime;
A spirit serene is unled astray by craving or desire.
Those who esteem virtue and uphold righteousness—
their mirror is surely bright;
Those who honor ritual and draw near the worthy—
their dust remains unmingled.
Naturally pure and white as jade,
radiant and clear as ice,
what filth could ever taint them?
What greed or lust could ever defile?
They stand towering like a wall of fathoms,
unmatched by any thing—
such is the noble person.

Affairs may call for ease and adaptability,
yet one must not cling rigidly to a single course.
Let contentment be the heart’s measure,
and all taking be guided by rightness.
For taking with rightness,
people will not deem one a beast.
The petty person’s heart is a bottomless ravine;
their taking knows no rightness.
For taking without rightness,
people will surely revile them.

As the saying goes:
*To master oneself and return to ritual is benevolence.*
This is restraint of the heart.
Facing wealth yet not losing one’s resolve—
this approaches mastery of self;
Seeing gain yet not altering one’s conduct—
this approaches return to ritual.
Fair forms undermine the resolve of upright scholars;
great profit corrupts the hearts of the upright.
Beware!

**Warn them of peril to assess their integrity.**
Confront them with urgency,
warn them of danger and distress—
those who hold fast to the center,
who firmly uphold what is right without wavering,
show integrity.
The noble person faces hardship without seeking escape,
thus ennobling their integrity and righteousness.
To cling to life without rightness rather than embrace death,
to preserve oneself by betraying integrity rather than perish—
this is to kill others to live,
to destroy others to survive.
The noble person does not act thus.

The benevolent possess courage,
for righteousness lies within;
The petty possess courage,
but calamity lies within.
The noble person, though beset, does not forget ritual;
though imperiled, does not abandon integrity.
The petty person, when beset, alters their nature;
when imperiled, betrays what is right.
Once rightness is betrayed,
it is like plunging down a precipice into raging waves,
or leaping from a cliff after a flying pellet—
swift as thunder after the lightning’s flash,
or an arrow loosed from a snapped bowstring.
What is gone cannot be reclaimed;
what is lost cannot be saved.
With careful thought and earnest reflection,
one avoids lifelong regret.
To dwell in sorrow after joy
is to preserve the renown of great integrity.

As the saying goes:
*Facing great trials yet unshaken—
such is the noble person.*
The petty person lacks foresight;
fearing calamity that presses near,
they seek only to preserve themselves,
yet cannot safeguard their integrity.

**Intoxicate them with wine to observe their restraint.**
Though the mad draft loosens the tongue,
one who remains reverent before drunkenness
shows restraint.
Thus three cups suffice to know when to stop;
a hundred bows honor the guest—
no slanted cap betrays disorder,
no overturned carriage brings regret,
for this is how one escapes the woes of wine.
As for wine’s effect on people:
in moderation, it harmonizes the qi;
in excess, it disorders the spirit.
It loosens the tongue’s restraint,
disturbs the tranquil heart.
Foul words arise, voices grow louder;
perverse deeds appear, and demeanor turns fierce.
Right and wrong swarm like bees,
sleeves are rolled, collars grasped—
evil is followed like a current,
and one knows not what they grasp.
They rush into fire and water,
heedless of shame after drunkenness,
plunging headlong into madness,
unable to avert disaster before sobriety.
Such blind fools willingly fall into ruin,
bringing sorrow upon themselves—
yet what pity do they deserve?

But when goblets and platters are arrayed,
cups fly in disarray,
and one’s demeanor remains solemn,
their conduct measured and dignified,
their expression respectful and self-controlled,
their face never slackening to offend—
when they gauge their portion to share in joy,
their capacity to meet the feast,
fearing the loss of restraint—
this is the way of the wise.

As the saying goes:
*Only with wine is there no limit—
yet one must not descend into chaos.*
Even the sage deeply warned against it.

**Mix them with others to observe their demeanor.**
Do not restrain women,
but mingle them among the company,
and watch their laughter and speech—
thus one knows their fondness for beauty.
Those with arched brows and radiant charm,
graceful forms and lovely bearing—
their cheeks outshine the lotus’s blush,
their complexions rival ice and snow.
Golden sparrows dangle from their hairpins,
jade pendants hang at their waists.
Their bright eyes stir the Wu Gorge’s depths,
their gleaming teeth part like the Luo Goddess’s.
Their weeping could halt a galloping horse,
their smile could topple a city.
Even steadfast men are moved by them,
even the resolute turn to look.
Fragrant winds draw forth their allure,
and the heart grows restless, ill at ease;
sunlight glints on their powdered faces,
and the mind lingers, lost in thought.
How much more so for the common crowd?

Yet some can scorn such filth,
banish such enchanting beauty.
Their minds remain untouched,
their natures untainted by strong temptation.
They feel shame at the songs of *Sangzhong*,
grief at the poems of *Xinglu*.
By night, they hold candles to avoid suspicion;
by day, they lower their voices to enter a room.
Their actions do not burden themselves,
their conduct does not defile their hearts.
Within the inner chambers, all is pure and tranquil;
their virtue is refined and unadulterated.
They hear words as if from kin,
yet regard such beauty as they would a foe.
To turn the heart that loves beauty
toward loving the worthy—
this is goodness.
Let all people take heed!

**Postscript**
The ancients did not speak lightly,
for they were ashamed if their conduct fell short.
Though my understanding is shallow and dull,
I have delighted in these teachings.
Now, in my flawed compilation and explanation,
I feel twice the weight upon my heart.
Though these words exist,
my conduct does not match them.
I daily reflect on these sayings,
reading and amending them.
The discerning may fear that my actions fall short of my words—
they will worry for me.
The deluded may rejoice that my actions fall short of my words—
they will mock me.
Yet since a true person has spoken,
how could I abandon the Way mid-course?
I must ensure that those who would mock me do not mock,
that those who would worry for me do not worry—
this will take time.
Those who know me will see my heart;
those who do not know me—
how dare I speak of my aspirations?
I must examine myself with vigilance and act accordingly.
