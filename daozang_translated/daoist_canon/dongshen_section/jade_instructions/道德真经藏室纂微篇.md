**Daoist Scripture (Upper Section)**

The **Dao/Way** is expounded in terms of **Chángdào** (the Eternal Dao). The **Chángdào** is the **void-hearted** (emptiness of the mind) that awaits all things.

The Dao, when it can be spoken of, is **not** the **Chángdào**. The Dao that can be articulated is subject to change, to transmigration, to speech and explanation—this is called **teachings and precepts**. How is it different from dross? Let us examine it by elucidating:

The Dao is **the Way of universal passage** (通). All things obtain it, and thus nothing is impassable.
It is also called **the Way of traversal** (蹈), taking the path as its metaphor.
The *Shuōwén* (Explanations of Script and Characters) states: **"One path reaching through is called Dao."** The ancient sages commanded that it be embodied and practiced, hence it is called **Dao**.

As for **virtue/power** (德) such as *rén* (benevolence), *yì* (righteousness), *lǐ* (propriety), *zhì* (wisdom), and *xìn* (faithfulness), these are all **applications of the Dao**. When applied, it is called **the Dao that can be spoken of**.

Once the **Dao that can be spoken of** is made manifest, it is **no longer the Chángdào**. The **Chángdào** is the spontaneous and natural, responding to sensation and transforming without end. It cannot be transmitted by words, nor can it be sought by intellect—only by embodying and merging with the **transformative power** (造化), containing the luminous light and hiding its radiance, acting without action yet accomplishing all things, silently attaining its utmost.

**Yán Jùnpíng** (严君平) said: The **Dao that can be spoken of** is the **Dao of virtue/power** made manifest, yet it is **not** the natural Dao.

Those who practice today do not carry torches by day, for the sun is bright. The sun’s brightness is the **Dao that is not spoken of**, eternal in its constancy. Carrying torches is the **Dao that can be spoken of**, made manifest.

What is inscribed on bamboo and silk, carved into metal and stone, and can be passed on to others—this is the **Dao that can be spoken of**. If it can be passed on yet cannot be received, if it can be obtained yet not seen, if it is the **self-originating root** (自本自根), before Heaven and Earth existed, since ancient times yet eternally preserved—then the **Dao of the Cavernous Deities** (神鬼、神帝), the **Dao that generates Heaven and Earth**, is the **Chángdào**.

The **five-thousand-word essence** (五千文) is unfolded from these few words, truly the **mysterious within the mysterious**, the **divine within the divine**.

**Naming and the Dao/Way**:
The Dao, when it can be named, is **not** the **Chángdào**.
The Dao is **embodiment** (体). Naming is **application** (用). Application arises from embodiment, and naming comes from the Dao. Once its name is marked, it can be applied. The application being established, it is called **the Dao that can be named**.

Once the **Dao that can be named** is applied, it is **no longer the Chángdào**. The **Chángdào** is the **name of application without bounds**, fragmenting its virtue/power.

**Yán Jùnpíng** said: The **Dao that can be named** is the **Dao of virtue/power** made manifest, yet it is **not** the innate truth.

**Lì Zǐ** (列子) dwelled in the **Jìng** (郑) garden for forty years, and no one recognized him. The king and ministers treated him like the common folk—this is truly the **Dao of guarding the Chángdào**.

The **beginning of Heaven and Earth** is **nameless** (无名). The **nameless** refers to the Dao. Before all transformations, there was no way to force a name upon it. When the **marvelous origin** (妙本) first descended, the **primordial simplicity** (浑沦之朴) was about to depart, and then the **Great Polarity** (太极) of the *Yì* (易) emerged, giving rise to the **Two Principles** (两仪).

**Yán Jùnpíng** said: The **nameless** is **without traces** (无朕), merging with the divine embodiment, the world relying upon it yet unaware of its transformation from **voidness** (虚无), making it the **beginning of Heaven and Earth**—this is the **embodiment of the Dao**.

The **named** (有名) is the **mother of all things**. The **named** refers to **Heaven and Earth**. Heaven’s bestowal and Earth’s transformation nurture all things. They shelter and harm them like a mother nurturing her children. Hence it is called the **named**, the **mother of all things**.

The **Great Dao** is mysterious and remote—how could it be confined to the **named** or the **nameless**? The sage **simplifies application to establish teachings**, thereby clarifying the **similarities and differences** of the **origin and traces**.

All **Dao that is renewed daily** is said to be **nameless**. Hence, the **beginning of all things** is the **nameless**. The **completion of all things** is the **named**.

**Yán Jùnpíng** said: The **named** is the **Dao of transformation**. Revering the Dao and valuing the divine, following the **Great Harmony** (太和), then Heaven and Earth become the **mother of all things**—this is the **application of the Dao**.

**Always without desire**, one may observe its **mystery** (妙);
**Always with desire**, one may observe its **boundaries** (徼).

**Desire** (欲) is the **pursuit of sensory realms** that generates the mind.
**Mystery** (妙) is the **essence of the utmost subtlety**.
**Boundary** (徼) is the **edge and corner**.

The **Great Dao** has small paths at its boundaries—these are called **boundaries**. It is also **return**.
The **Dao of voidness** (虚无) is **still and unmoving**—this is called **without desire**.
When it **senses and gives birth to all things**, it is called **with desire**.
**Without desire** is observing the **mystery** while guarding the **voidness**.
**With desire** is observing the **boundaries**—this is called **retaining thought** (存思).

It has been said that **true constancy** (真常) is the **Great Dao** itself.
**Without desire** and **with desire** are the **Dao’s applications**.
The Dao originally has **no form**—**form** arises when the Dao is sensed and generated.
What is **above form** is called the Dao.
What is **below form** is called **instrumentality** (器).

The **superior person** (上士) knows the **subtle** and the **manifest**, seeing what is **not yet formed** and already exhausting its **mystery**—hence, **always without desire**, they observe its **mystery**.
The **middle person** (中士) follows and adapts to things, seeing their **clusters and masses** (群村), and thus obtains their **application**—hence, though there are **ten thousand differences**, the **true principle** (真理) is unfathomable, but they merely **glimpse its boundaries**.

Another elucidation states:
If a person **always embodies the subtle essence of the Great Dao**, guards the **key to stillness** (清静之要), and returns to the **extreme of life and vitality** (性命之极), not being seduced by external things, then their **intentions and will** (志意) become **pure and vast** (虚澹), able to observe the **Dao’s utmost mystery** and the **Dao’s ultimate boundaries**.

**Yán Jùnpíng** said:
When the **mind is like metal or stone** (金石), the **body is like the wood of the *jú* tree** (桔木), and one **silently dwells in the corners** (隅隅), with **intentions as gentle as a colt** (驹犊)—this is the **person without desire**, returning to the **root of life and vitality**.

The person with desire consumes the boundaries of things and loses the path of ease and openness.
They see only the petty edges of the net, lost and unable to return, forfeiting the true origin.

Some ancient sages said that those without desire embody the Dao inwardly, observing transformation without attachment to any form or trace, forgetting their own origins.

Those with desire, however, arise from the root and apply its use to what can be spoken of—establishing teachings to respond to things, accomplishing the salvation of myriad affairs. They perceive the end of things and know their return, first speaking of restraining oneself, then of transforming the people. Cultivating oneself and governing the state—these two are the same.

In principle, nothing is lacking. These two are the same—what can be spoken of and what can be named, the unnamed and the named, desirelessness and desire. All are contained within the still, motionless, and profound source, where essence and function remain indistinct, and good and evil are both extinguished. Hence, they are said to be the same.

Yet when they manifest, they take on different names. By "manifest," it means descending from the root to expound what can be spoken of in gradual stages. Though originating from one mind, the applications of the Five Constants differ, and the wise and foolish vary and transform. Lifespans, fortune, and existence all differ—each takes on its own name.

The same is called the Mysterious. The Mysterious again, the Mysterious—this is profound and subtle, obscure and natural. What is called "natural" is the Way.

It is said that both the unnamed and the named, desirelessness and desire, all receive *qi* from Heaven and examine nature’s essence. Pure and impure, honored and humiliated, forms take on myriad shapes—this arises from the Mysterious again, the Mysterious, the Divine again, the Divine. This is what is called "naturally so."

If one penetrates and comprehends this profound subtlety, piercing the silent and obscure, this is called possessing *Xuándé* (玄德). It is the gateway to all marvels—meaning the realm of the Dao.

The Great Dao is vast and unbounded, with no barriers or confines, no doors or walls—it is boundless and resplendent. When speaking of self-cultivation, outwardly it aligns with the common people, inwardly it becomes the wondrous root. When teaching, the myriad truths emerge from subtlety, and the sages contain subtlety within. Transformation and guidance have no fixed method; profound and singular, it stands alone and unchanging—this is called *Zhīcháng* (知常).

Since there are ways of emergence and return, it is called the *Gate*. Zhuangzi said:
*"There is birth and there is death,
There is exit and there is entry.
Exit and entry without seeing its form—
This is called the Heavenly Gate."*

The Heavenly Gate is the state of *wu* (無有, non-being).
All things emerge from non-being—
This is also called the gateway to all marvels.

Only the Marvelous Dao gives rise to all things.
What gives rise to all things is surely the Marvelous Dao.
Those who use the Dao are surely the sages.
The sage’s Dao renews itself daily, its applications boundless—
Hence, it is called *Cháng* (常, the Constant).

Emergence and retreat have boundaries;
Desire for difference leads to action—
Hence, it is called *kě* (可, permissible).

What can be spoken of must be named;
What is named must be known—
Hence, it follows with *"All under Heaven know."*

All under Heaven know beauty as beauty—
Then ugliness already exists.
All know goodness as goodness—
Then ungoodness already exists.

Beauty and goodness arise from deluded emotions.
What one’s emotions favor becomes beauty;
What one’s emotions reject becomes ugliness.
If one indulges deluded emotions, what is not ugliness?

What one takes as right becomes goodness;
What one takes as wrong becomes ungoodness.
If one indulges in one’s own right and wrong,
How can there be true beauty?

Zhuangzi said:
*"Is and is-not—this is what I call emotions.
What I call without-emotion is:
People do not harm themselves with their likes and dislikes,
Always following nature without artificial enhancement.
This is called stopping at what is truly fitting."*

The sage is not without beauty and goodness—
Rather, they possess it without boasting,
Thus aligning with non-being.
Not boasting preserves virtue intact;
Aligning with non-being keeps harm at bay.
Virtue preserved, harm distant—
Then beauty and goodness are complete.

If one uses beauty and goodness to transform the world,
Making them know beauty as beauty—
This is not yet perfect goodness.

The *Classic* says:
*"The highest virtue does not cling to virtue;
The lower virtue does not lose virtue."*
This is correct.

Moreover, good people are few under Heaven,
While ungood people are many.
If one corrects their governance and secretly mocks them,
This becomes evil.

Yán Jùnpíng said:
*"The bright does not always endure;
The obscure does not always vanish.
Honor and decay begin in late spring,
Wild plants and grains sprout at the autumn equinox.
On the winter solstice, all things flourish;
On the summer solstice, all things wither.
It is said that prosperity must yield to decline,
And beauty must yield to ugliness.
Even yin and yang follow this—
How much more so for humans?"*

This is a warning against those who boast in beauty and goodness.

Thus, being and non-being give rise to each other,
Difficulty and ease complete each other,
Length and shortness define each other,
High and low incline against each other,
Sounds harmonize with each other,
Front and back follow each other.

These six principles, when one boasts in beauty and goodness, lead to action.
Once action is manifest, partial fixation arises,
And mutual destruction and harm emerge—
Things lose their nature.
Hence, it concludes with the sage’s *wuwei*,
And *Xuándé* does not depart.

The nature of being and non-being
Originally does not give rise to each other.
Yet it is said that being must emerge from non-being,
And non-being must arise from being—
Hence, *"being and non-being give rise to each other."*

The principle of difficulty and ease
Originally does not complete each other.
For instance, the potter finds clay easy to shape
But wood difficult to work.
The carpenter finds wood easy to shape
But altars difficult to construct.
If one tries to make the easy difficult,
It will not succeed.
If each sticks to their craft,
It will be accomplished—
Hence, *"difficulty and ease complete each other."*

Length and shortness
Originally do not define each other.
Seeing a crane, one knows the hare’s legs are short;
Observing a hare, one knows the crane’s legs are long.
Things follow this pattern—
Hence, *"length and shortness define each other."*

High and low
Originally do not incline against each other.
If one lacks sufficient rank,
Then the desire for usurpation arises.
If one is high but not arrogant,
Then none will seek to humble them.
If one is low but not abased,
Then none will seek to exalt them.
If one aspires and envies, striving to surpass others,
Then all will topple each other—
Hence, *"high and low incline against each other."*

The resonance of sounds,
Originally does not harmonize.
Like the natural music of heaven,
It hums and ceases on its own.
Yet the world claims that tones and rhythms,
Qi and melodies combine to form songs,
To harmonize and hum together—
Hence, *"sounds harmonize."*

Before and after,
Originally do not follow in sequence.
Like day and night succeeding each other,
Yesterday is before today,
Today is after yesterday.
Again, like the path of forward and backward steps—
Lifting the foot, lowering the foot,
Which comes first, which comes after?
It shifts and changes.
Jun Ping said:
Without the void, there is no way to perceive existence;
With the void, form takes shape.
Difficulty cannot reveal ease,
Ease cannot reveal difficulty.
An inch shortens a foot,
A foot lengthens an inch.
Mountains collapse through valleys,
Valleys tilt through mountains.
Sounds distinguish tones,
Tones pause through sounds.
What comes first is seen through what follows,
What follows is understood through what precedes.
Thus, without the void, existence cannot be seen;
Without existence, the void cannot be known.
Without difficulty, ease cannot be known;
Without ease, difficulty cannot be known.
Without length, shortness cannot be known;
Without shortness, length cannot be known.
Without mountains, valleys cannot be known;
Without valleys, mountains cannot be known.
Without sounds, tones cannot be known;
Without tones, sounds cannot be known.
Without what comes first, what follows cannot be known;
Without what follows, what comes first cannot be known.

All these things—
The proofs of Heaven and Earth,
The symbols of Nature—
Are laid out, exposed, and slow to change.
Affirmation and negation follow each other,
Beginning and end reverse and repeat,
Unseparable, beyond evasion by the numinous,
Unopposed by yin and yang.

From this, it is seen:
The affairs of the Sage-King
Cannot be achieved through contrived action.

Thus, the Sage acts in *wuwei*,
Practices the teaching of *non-speech*.
This speaks of the ancient Sage-Kings,
Who did not govern the world through beauty and virtue,
Yet the world governed itself.
*Wuwei* is not idle inaction or silent withdrawal—
It is the forgetting of beauty and virtue,
The annihilation of emotion, the return to true nature,
Where the people act according to their abilities,
Things settle into their proper order,
And none disturb the harmony above or below.
Thus, the teaching of *non-speech* is carried out—
By leading with one’s own conduct,
Rectifying one’s bearing to enlighten things,
Acting in accordance with the times,
Utilizing resources to achieve merit,
And aligning with the principle of *forgetting speech*.

All things act without complaint.
*Action* is movement.
The Sage governs the world with *youshou* (nurturing),
Doing nothing, yet nothing is undone—
Thus the people till and eat,
Weave and clothe themselves,
Rest content in their homes,
And play with full bellies.
They take joy in their natural inclinations,
All drinking from the transformation of *wuwei*.
Thus the Sage entrusts them without complaint.
The people can be led along a path,
But cannot be made to know its purpose.
This is the wind of *upper virtue not claiming virtue*.

To give birth without possession,
To act without reliance,
To complete deeds without taking credit—
All things arise and transform on their own,
Standing alone and self-so,
Not claimed as one’s own.
All creatures pursue their nature,
Each adapting to its kind,
Not relying on their own virtue.
When deeds are accomplished and affairs settled,
The Way permeates all things,
The mind wanders in the Maoshu Mountains,
Not lording over the people.
This is the complete virtue of the Sage.

Only by not claiming
Does one not depart.
The Sage’s deeds are like those of Creation,
Allowing all things to reach their utmost,
Forgetting name and self.
Not claiming means not taking position as one’s own,
Thus the people are unaware, unknowing—
Hence, their Way does not perish,
Their virtue does not fade.

*The Honglie Explanation* says:
When the Chu did not appoint Zi Fa to attack Cai,
He was praised, and King Xuan of Chu welcomed him at the border,
Granting him a hundred *mu* of land and sealing him with a jade tablet.
Zi Fa declined, saying:
*"To govern a state and establish policies,
To receive vassal lords as guests—
This is the virtue of the ruler.
To issue commands and the enemy flees before battle—
This is the might of the general.
To array the troops and defeat the enemy—
This is the strength of the common people.
To ride upon the people’s labor and take their rank and rewards—
This is not the Way of ren and yi.*
Thus he declined and did not accept it.
This is *completing deeds without claiming them.*"

Knowledge brings the mutual birth of good and evil,
The incline of high and low cannot be escaped.
Difficulty and ease stand opposed,
The talents of long and short cannot be concealed.
When long and short are revealed, the worthy are praised—
Hence, it is followed by *not praising the worthy*.
Not praising the worthy prevents the people from contending.
If the ruler is humble, yielding, and tranquil,
Not boasting of his own virtue,
Then the people’s transformation follows like wind bending grass,
And who would dare to contend?
*The Classic* says:
*"I do nothing, yet the people transform themselves;
I love stillness, yet the people rectify themselves."*

Another explanation says:
If the ruler is tranquil,
The ministers are enlightened,
Punishments do not spare the noble,
Grace does not exclude the lowly,
The worthy and unworthy each fulfill their roles—
Then the scholars will not contend.
But if the ruler is indecisive,
The ministers are flattering,
Though they praise the worthy and seek talent,
Their outward loyalty hides inner deceit,
And those with poisonous hearts and harmonious words arrive—
Then deceit arises and contention spreads.

Jun Ping said:
The Sage is the master of great virtue,
The commoner is the servant of lesser virtue.
The worthy are not one in ten thousand,
The Sage does not appear in every age.
Heaven’s creation of the worthy and unworthy
Is not by praising them.

Again, it is said:
Like driving a poor horse and a fine steed together on a level road,
Or letting a wild goose and a quail fly side by side in the blue sky—
Then the worthy and unworthy become clear.
This is natural, not by praising them.

Not valuing rare treasures
Prevents the people from stealing.
Rare treasures are gold, jade, pearls, and rhinoceros horn.
If the ruler’s transformation is pure and tranquil,
The people focus on farming and learning,
Hiding gold in the mountains,
Discarding pearls in the depths,
Finding no profit in wealth,
No attraction in nobility—
Then the people will have no heart for theft.
Another explanation says:
The black dragon’s night-light pearls,
Gold, jade, brocade, and embroidery—
If the ruler does not value them,
The people will not covet them,
And where would thieves come from?
The saying goes:
*"If a person does not desire it,
Even if rewarded, they will not steal."*

*The Honglie Explanation* says:
Citing the laws of Shennong:
*"If a man is strong yet does not plow,
There will be those who starve in the world."*

When women reach adulthood yet remain uneducated,
The world will have those who suffer from cold.

Thus, the ruler himself plows,
His wife weaves,
Setting an example for all under heaven.
This is how he guides the people—
By not valuing rare treasures,
By making desirable things unseen,
So that the people’s hearts remain undisturbed.

Desirable things are those external objects
That bewilder the mind,
Giving rise to covetous and lustful desires.
Yet "not seeing" does not mean distant isolation—
It means not letting perception become perception,
But embracing *wuwei* instead.

If the ruler beholds external things
Yet harbors no covetous or lustful desires,
Then he is untouched by the defilements of form,
And his original nature returns to purity and tranquility—
To its true, singular essence.

When the ruler preserves this true singularity,
The people’s hearts remain undisturbed,
And the winds of simplicity and sincerity can flourish.

**Jun Ping** says:
If the world does not honor the worthy,
The people will not strive,
And without striving, there will be no contention,
And without contention, there will be no disorder.
If the world does not value wealth,
The people will not desire it,
And without desire, there will be no seeking,
And without seeking, there will be no theft.
If the world abandons the pleasures of music and dance,
The people will have no joy,
And without joy, there will be no licentiousness.
This is the natural order of things.

*The Honglie Explanation* says:
**Ordering Yin Zi Pei** to drink with King Zhuang of Chu,
The king agreed.
Zi Pei stood with loose sleeves, facing north in the hall,
Thinking: *"The king once granted this, yet now does not fulfill it—
Perhaps I have erred?"*

The king replied:
*"I have heard of your Strong Terrace.
That terrace overlooks the Liang Mountains,
Facing the vast expanse,
With the river to its left and the Huai to its right—
Its pleasures make one forget life and death.
A man of my meager virtue cannot bear such delights.
I fear if I linger, I may never return.
Thus, the saying: 'Make desirable things unseen,
So that the heart remains undisturbed.'"*

**Transmission of Yi’s *Yin Yi*** says:
The ancient text reads *"make the people’s hearts undisturbed,"*
But the He Shang Gong *Kaoyuan* edition reads *"make the heart undisturbed,"*
Which is also acceptable.

Thus, the Sage’s governance begins with emptying the heart—
First purifying oneself,
Then extending to family and state.
Emptying the heart means harboring no wicked thoughts.
Not forcing the mind to chase after darkness,
Yet inwardly quelling desires,
Dispelling all attachments,
So that the mind naturally settles—
This is emptiness.

As Zhuangzi says:
*"In an empty chamber, white purity arises—
A blessing of stillness.
Stillness means the heart is empty,
And pristine whiteness brings fortune to dwell."*

**Filling the belly.**
The Sage’s virtue and power internally suffuse,
The five spirits remain tranquil,
Contentment is self-sufficient,
And no attachment to wealth or love arises—
Thus, *"filling the belly."*

**Weakening the will.**
The will is the mind’s affair.
What the mind pursues is called will.
To act with the mind,
One must uphold humility, stillness, gentleness, and weakness—
Then the Dao is complete.

**Strengthening the bones.**
Bones are the body’s framework.
When purity and harmony are sufficient,
The body is nourished,
And when vital essence is robust,
The bones grow strong—
This too is natural law.

**Always keeping the people in ignorance and desirelessness.**
The Sage constantly cultivates himself, emptying his heart,
So that the people may return to simplicity and sincerity,
And transform naturally with joy.

The saying goes:
*"If one rectifies himself,
What need has he for governance?"*
Thus, even those who possess knowledge or cunning,
Or who adorn themselves with deceit,
Are already influenced by the winds of purity and sincerity,
Their hearts grow dull,
Their bodies wither—
They dare not stir,
And all desires for action fade.

**To act with *wuwei* is to govern perfectly.**
To act with *wuwei* means to follow the Way of non-action.
Non-action means not exceeding one’s natural endowment.
If one does not exceed nature,
Then natural order is preserved,
And all actions become non-action.

When all things act without contrivance,
The hearts of covetousness and seeking vanish entirely,
And the winds of simplicity prevail—
Who could say governance fails?

To honor one’s own worth and ability makes the people follow,
But to indulge in contention and theft stirs the desires that breed chaos.
Only the Sage governs through emptiness and openness,
Thus he follows with the *chong* of the Dao.

The *chong* of the Dao,
When applied, is never full.
*"Full"* in the ancient text means *"satisfied."*
*Chong* means emptiness.
It also means centrality—
An indefinite term,
And also constancy.
The Dao’s use lies in its emptiness—
Harmonious *qi* is empty and open,
Thus it flows universally.
The ruler who attains this emptiness
Loses his wealth in a thousand chariots,
While the common man, attaining it,
Forgets his poverty in a single room.
Though seated in the temple halls,
His heart is as still as in a mountain cave;
Though dressed in coarse rags,
He does not differ from the adorned in fine silks—
This is the profound attainment of emptiness,
And the absence of fullness.

**Jun Ping** says:
Those who *do* emptiness are not empty,
Those who *do* harmony are not harmonious.
Only by *not* doing emptiness and harmony
Does one truly attain emptiness and harmony.
Emptiness takes emptiness as its dwelling,
Harmony takes non-action as its home.
To be able to empty and to be non-action—
This is the excess of emptiness,
To be able to be non-action and to empty—
This is the constancy of harmony.
Thus, one truly attains the Great Dao,
The use of emptiness and harmony without fullness.

The central way lies in harmony.
Some dare not establish it—
This refers to the Dao itself.

Deep, like the source of all things.
*Deep* means profound stillness.
*Fu* is the rhythmic intonation of Daoist chant.
Understanding this,
The Dao of emptiness is neither deficient nor excessive,
Its nature is concentrated and serene—
Deep, unfathomable—
Thus it is called *deep*.

The logic of the unfathomable
Is neither being nor non-being,
Difficult to name,
Thus it is spoken of metaphorically.
Daily life flows naturally,
Like water in a vessel—
Serene and profound,
Encompassing all phenomena,
Preserving both good and evil,
Nurturing all movement and growth—
Thus it is the source of all things.

**Dulling the sharp, unraveling the tangled.**
*Dulling* means restraining.
It also means breaking the edge—
*Sharp* refers to keen ambition,
And also to forward momentum.
*Unraveling* means dispersing,
*Tangled* means excessive agitation.
Those who advance eagerly for fame and gain
Should reflect on the Dao’s emptiness,
Restrain their greed and delusion,
And not exalt themselves.

「Yet some rage with arrogance, galloping in pursuit of fame,
Their inner and outer selves in turmoil—
But those who grasp the Dao’s profound stillness
Can loosen bonds and disperse agitation,
Serene and clear, restoring their true nature.
*Agitation* (纷), Master He Shang of the Riverbank, renders as *resentment* (忿), meaning "a knot of grudges."
When one harbors resentment and hatred, bound like iron chains,
Yet holds the Dao’s emptiness and harmony in mind,
All dissolves—like ice melting in the sun.

*Harmonizing its light*, *blending with the dust*—
Serene, yet as if something remains.
The Dao of ultimate emptiness
Employs harmony and balance in its operations,
And its applications know no limits.

In light, it harmonizes—
Present yet without distinction.
In dust, it blends—
Coexisting yet without separation.

When responding to phenomena, it merges with light and dust,
When returning to its root, it remains untouched and serene—
Trace its wondrous origin, and it vanishes into emptiness,
Yet its actions are manifest and real—
Thus it is said: Serene, yet as if something remains.

I do not know whose child I am,
Yet I precede the likeness of the Emperor.
*I* refers to the Old Master’s self-designation.
*Likeness* means resemblance.
I observe the Dao’s unfathomable depths,
Its boundless, unmeasurable operations,
Crafting all things.

The Dao endures through ages past and present,
Having neither ancestor nor master—
Who dares claim descent or lineage?
It seems as though, through profound contemplation,
One might suppose I emerged before the Celestial Emperor.

If one employs the Dao’s emptiness and balance,
Then the *deep* (渊) is never full,
And blending with light and dust,
Thus it becomes the source of all things.

Seeking its source, it precedes Heaven and Earth—
Hence the mention of Heaven and Earth.

Heaven and Earth are not kind,
Yet they treat all things as fodder for sacrifice.
The Sage is not kind,
Yet he treats the people as fodder for sacrifice.
*Fodder* (刍) means grass—
Bound into bundles for ritual offerings.
In ancient times, it was used for sacrifices to avert misfortune,
Then discarded afterward.
When used, they did not cherish it greatly,
And when abandoned, they did not grieve its loss.
Thus, fodder for sacrifice arises from divine purpose,
Yet the divine has no need for the fodder.
No need means no partiality,
No partiality means no favoritism—
Hence, Heaven and Earth have no favoritism,
Yet great benevolence arises,
The Sage is not kind,
Yet Heaven’s kindness is fulfilled.

*Not kind* means lacking emotional attachment to benevolence,
Not neglecting what is evil.
Thus, Heaven and Earth, lacking sentiment,
View all things as fodder for sacrifice,
Demanding no gratitude in return.
The Sage, lacking sentiment,
Views the people as fodder for sacrifice,
Demanding no gratitude in return.
This is the natural way of Heaven and Earth.

Master Rong Ping said:
Heaven is high and clear, Earth is thick and yielding—
The interplay of Yin and Yang,
Balanced *qi* flowing,
Naturally effortless, yet all things arise.

Heaven and Earth do not strain their hearts or minds,
Nor exhaust their spirits in laborious deeds,
Nor weep in excessive affection,
Nor bestow favors with calculated gain,
Nor shower blessings to demand repayment—
Yet all things are nurtured and fulfilled.
This is what is meant by:
Heaven and Earth are not kind,
Yet they treat all things as fodder for sacrifice.

Enlightened kings and sagely rulers
Hold the Dao’s unity and harmony,
Their clarity and stillness unchanging,
Yet they adapt in all transformations—
Divine and effortless,
Their actions aligned with the Dao,
The world responds, all things naturally evolve.

The Sage does not exhaust his wisdom or abilities,
Nor disturb his heart with restless schemes,
Nor drain his vital essence in ceaseless toil,
Nor fixate on endless calculations,
Nor flaunt his benevolence in public displays,
Nor lead the people with contrived affection—
Yet virtue spreads universally,
And the realm unites in peace,
His kindness reaches to all corners,
His deeds are fully accomplished—
For what is the art of benevolence and kindness?

Things rely on their allotted measure for transformation,
Yet the Dao’s boundless operations
Grant measure to the boundless,
Endowing it with inexhaustible power—
If they do not sustain each other,
It is like a river drying up,
And the land withering in its wake.
*Again it is said:*
Even lice stirring on the hair
Cause sleep to be unsettled.
Mosquitoes settling on the skin
Distract the mind,
And obstruct clear thought.
External harm from venomous insects
Pierces the heart with pain,
Yet the damage ends at the ears and eyes,
And all limbs grow sluggish.
This shows that affection and gain
Stored in the chest
Cannot but bring strain, imbalance, and depletion of vital *qi*.

Excessive words lead to exhaustion,
Better to uphold the Center.
*Excessive words* refers to excessive talk of universal love—
Too much leads to difficulty in execution,
Thus, words run dry, bending under strain,
Yet if one follows Heaven and Earth’s emptiness and stillness,
And the *bell bellows* (橐钥)’s heartless nature,
Embracing the Center’s harmony,
All will naturally suffice.
It is also the teaching of *non-action* (不言之教).

The *Honglie Explanation* (《鸿烈解》) says:
Master Wang Shou carried his books while walking,
And encountered Xu Feng in Zhou.
Xu Feng said:
*Action* (事) arises from responding to change,
Change comes from the times,
Thus, those who know the times act without fixed patterns.
*Books* are the source of words.
Words come from those who know,
And those who know hide their books.
Thus, Master Wang Shou burned his books
And danced, saying:
Excessive words lead to exhaustion,
Better to uphold the Center.

Heaven and Earth move and rest without partiality,
Their essence containing emptiness yet unyielding—
This is due to their *spirit* (神).
Hence, it follows with *the spirit of the valley* (谷神).

The *spirit of the valley* does not die,
This is called the *mysterious female* (玄牝).
The Great Person regards the *Great Emptiness* (太虚) as the *valley’s spirit*,
And *creation* (造化) as the *ultimate spirit* (至神).
The *valley’s spirit* and *ultimate spirit*
Are the Dao’s essence and function—
How could they ever die?

「The principle of non-death is both profoundly obscure and capable of nurturing as a mother.
Some liken the *valley* to Heaven and Earth,
And *spirit* to the Great Dao.
Now, those who speak use the analogy of mountain valleys echoing in response—
Is this not a small comparison?

Moreover, if a person can embrace openness without limits,
Conform to the boundless scope of the Great Emptiness,
Preserve the true and genuine *spirit*,
And draw upon the vitality of *creation*,
Then naturally their form aligns with the Dao—
What is there of death to speak of?
Thus, in obscurity, they flourish and nurture,
And all things receive their blessing—
This is called the *mysterious female*.

River Above Master’s *Commentary* states:
The sound of the *valley* (谷) is *nurturing* (育).
The *mysterious female* is nurturance itself.
If a person can nurture their *spirit*, they will not die.
By *spirit*, they mean the *spirits* of the five *viscera* (五藏):
The liver harbors the *hun* (魂),
The lungs harbor the *po* (魄),
The heart harbors the *spirit* (神),
The kidneys harbor the *jing* (精),
The spleen harbors the *zhi* (志).
If a person can maintain purity, stillness, and emptiness,
To nurture their *spirit* without being stained by desires,
And keep their form intact and *spirit* complete—
Then they will not die.
If, however, they indulge in emotions and become entangled,
Disturbed by all phenomena,
Their form becomes impaired and their *spirit* departs—
How could the Dao persist?

The *gateway* of the *mysterious female*
Is called the *root of Heaven and Earth*.
For all things emerge and return through the Great Emptiness and *creation*.
Since there is the name of *emergence and return*,
It is thus called the *gateway*.
By *root*, they mean *origin*.
Though Heaven and Earth are vast,
They cannot evade having form—
All things of form rely on the Great Emptiness and harmony as their origin,
Hence, it is called the *root of Heaven and Earth*.
River Above Master says:
The way to non-death lies within the *mysterious female*.
*Xuan* (玄) is Heaven,
In humans, it is the *nose*.
*Pin* (牝) is Earth,
In humans, it is the *mouth*.
Heaven nourishes humans with the five *qi* (五气),
Entering through the nose and stored in the heart—
These five *qi*, pure and refined, become the *spirit* of intelligence,
The clarity of hearing and voice,
And the five *natures* (性),
Their *ghostly* aspect being the *hun*.
The *hun* is masculine.
It governs the entering and exiting of *qi* through the nose,
Connecting with Heaven—
Thus, the nose is called *xuan*.
Earth nourishes humans with the five *flavors* (五味),
Entering through the mouth and stored in the stomach—
These five flavors, coarse and impure, become the *form* of bones, flesh, and blood,
The six *emotions* (情),
Their *ghostly* aspect being the *po*.
The *po* is feminine.
It governs the entering and exiting of *qi* through the mouth,
Connecting with Earth—
Thus, the mouth is called *pin*.
By *root*, they mean *primordial* (元).
The gateway of the nose and mouth
Is where the primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth
Flows in and out.

The earlier statement that the *spirit of the valley* does not die
Encourages people to understand the principle of nurturing the *spirit*.
This passage on the *gateway of the mysterious female*
Illustrates the further development of refining the form.
Thus, those who perfect both form and *spirit*
Are the ones who can align with the Dao.

When humans have a body and a *spirit*,
Then there is life and death.
Life and death cannot be spoken of as the Dao.
Flowing and changing without constancy—
How could it be called *stillness*?

If one empties their form and *spirit*,
Forgets distinctions of self and other,
Then emergence has no root—
Thus, *qi* gathers without being called life,
And return has no orifice—
Thus, *qi* disperses without being called death.
Neither life nor death—
This is the *spirit of the valley*.
Life and death without constancy—
This is the floating and changing of things.
Profound stillness, feminine tranquility,
Serene and unmoving—
This is the *mysterious female*.

Continuous as if ever-present,
Yet effortless in its application.
Continuous—
The appearance of ceaselessness—
This concludes the meaning of nurturing the *spirit* and refining the form.

To nurture the *spirit* is to reach profound mystery and obscurity,
Purity, stillness, and emptiness,
Continuous as if ever-present,
Responding to things without ceasing.
To refine the form is to breathe the Great Harmony,
Guide and connect the blood and *qi*,
Drink the *elixir* of the endless spring,
Chew the herbs of longevity,
And ensure the limbs and joints remain unobstructed without labor—
Only then can one align with the roots of Heaven and Earth,
And share the gateway with all marvels.

The *valley* is the Great Emptiness,
*Creation* is the *spirit*—
The *mysterious female* nurtures all things,
Continuous and unending—
Thus, it is followed by the saying *Heaven endures, Earth persists*.

*Heaven endures, Earth persists*—
A standard.
Heaven, through its vast *qi* and forms,
Has not tilted from ancient times to now,
Hence it is called *enduring*.
Earth, through its solid substance and capacity,
Remains eternally steadfast and unchanging,
Hence it is called *persisting*.
This concludes the analogy and establishes its meaning in the following text.

Heaven and Earth endure and persist
Because they do not generate themselves—
Thus, they can achieve eternal life.
This concludes the meaning.

Heaven endures in purity,
Earth persists in tranquility,
Because they cover and nourish all things,
And extend their nurturing to all beings—
Yet they all draw upon the wondrous origin,
Return to the boundless void,
And restore to the profound stillness,
Without boasting of their own creative power,
And thus they uphold their constant *virtue*—
Hence, they can endure and persist eternally.

Another interpretation says:
Heaven, Earth, and all things
Transform uniquely and naturally,
All discerning their own essence,
Yet none seeking to prolong or augment their life—
Thus, they can endure and persist eternally.
This is a solemn warning.

Hence, the Sage follows his own body while his body precedes others,
Sets aside his body while his body remains.
The Sage acts without action,
His body in the hall of state,
Yet his mind wanders in *Maoshu* (姑射).
He follows the pattern of Heaven and Earth’s covering and nurturing,
And distributes nourishment impartially.
He has greatness yet practices humility,
And does not dare to take precedence over the world.
His people delight in his guidance without wearying of its joy,
They are pushed forward without resentment—
Thus, his body precedes others.
He can also forget his merits and name,
Set aside his body and reduce his desires.
The world loves him as a father and mother,
The *spirit* and clarity of Heaven protect him as an innocent child—
Thus, his body remains.

Is it not because he has no self-interest?
Hence, he can achieve his own interests.
Heaven and Earth generate all things,
Yet the Sage, setting aside himself, benefits all people—
None rely on their own benevolence,
How could there be a heart of self-interest?
It is truly without self-interest.
Without self-interest, he can endure and persist,
And because he endures and persists,
He is like one who can achieve his own interests.

Master Li Yue says:
He who does not selfishly hoard for himself,
Yet gives generously to others—
Others’ selfishness may not succeed,
But his own will be fulfilled.

*The Profound and Distinct Interpretation* says:
When Gongyi Xiu governed Lu,
He loved fish,
And when the entire state offered fish to him,
He did not accept it.
His disciples remonstrated:
“Master, you love fish—
Why do you not accept it?”
He replied:
“It is precisely because I love fish,
That I do not accept it.”」

「Though he receives fish and is spared from serving as prime minister,
Even if he loves fish, he cannot provide fish for himself—
Without receiving fish, he is not spared from serving as prime minister,
Yet he can still long provide fish for himself.
This is the understanding of one who acts for others while benefiting himself.

Thus it is said:
It is not because he lacks self-interest that he fulfills his own.
The Riverbank Master (河上公) and Master Yan Junping (严君平) wrote: *"because he lacks self-interest."*
Wang Bi’s ancient text read: *"It is not because he lacks self-interest that..."*
The Kaiyuan Imperial Edition (开元御本) states: *"It is not because he lacks self-interest that..."*
Each has its own meaning—let the reader consider them carefully.

The Sage’s later body, having transcended the self,
Can be public to himself while private to others,
Soft and yielding yet beneficial to all things—
Thus he is ranked above as *the highest virtue is like water*.

*The Daoist Classic of Authentic Perfection* (*道德真经*), in the *Palace Treasuries* (*藏室*), *Mù Wēi* Chapter (*慕微篇*), Volume One concludes.
*The Daoist Classic of Authentic Perfection*, *Palace Treasuries* (*藏室*), *Zhuǎn Wēi* Chapter (*纂微篇*), Volume Two begins.
Compiled by Bìxū Zǐ (*碧虚子*) Chén Jǐngyuán (*陈景元*).

*The Daoist Classic* says:
The highest virtue is like water.
The *highest virtue* (上善) refers to the standard for humanity (标人).
*Like water* (若水) is a metaphorical illustration (举喻).
He whose aspirations are for others, whose heart is empty and desireless,
Who adapts to circumstances and follows the times,
Does not oppose the myriad things,
And in virtue forgets virtue—
Thus he is called *the highest virtue*.

Water can solidify or dissolve, conform to depths or shallows,
Flow or sink, follow the Dao and embrace emptiness—
All these have their principles.
Only the Sage comprehends and harmonizes them all,
Thus he is like water.

Water embodies the Dao’s three near-qualities (三能之近道)
And seven virtues of benefit to all (七善之利物),
As explained in the following passage.

Water benefits all things yet does not contend,
Dwelling where others abhor—
Thus it is near the Dao.
This is the first of the three near-qualities.

Water’s nature is calm and still,
Yet it spreads and nourishes all things.
Without water, the sky would be parched and dry,
And the earth would be dusty and turbulent.
It benefits and nourishes all things,
Thus it is called *virtuous in beneficence*—
This is the first virtue.

Water is the gentlest and weakest of all things,
Yet it yields to emptiness, rejecting solidity,
Avoiding heights and seeking depths—
Blocked, it stops; pressed, it flows.
It submits to all things,
Thus it is called *non-contending*—
This is the second virtue.

Though men’s nature is to abhor what is low and impure,
Water dwells in the depths and accepts filth—
It does not shun what others abhor,
Yet it cleanses all things, making them pure and white,
Bearing all insults alone,
Dwelling where others abhor—
This is the third virtue.

*Near* (几) means *approaching*.
Water benefits all things,
Thus its benevolence is vast and boundless—
It does not contend,
Thus its virtue is modest and radiant—
It dwells in what others abhor,
Thus its capacity endures defilement.
By illustrating water’s three near-qualities,
Only the Sage embodies them in a unified virtue and conduct—
Far from straying from the Dao,
Thus it is said: *near the Dao*.

Another explanation:
Water is *qi* (气),
The ruler of the North (毋王於北方),
Its number being six.
The North is the beginning of Yang virtue (阳德)
And the end of Yin *qi* (阴气).

The number of life is one, the same as the Dao—
The Dao is also called one.
The Dao’s one is *the one that transcends all ones* (无一之一),
Water’s one is *the one that contains all ones* (有一之一).
The one that transcends all ones is the essence of the Dao,
The one that contains all ones is the manifestation of the Dao—
Thus water, as the Dao’s manifestation,
Is said to be *near the Dao*.

Residence (居), virtue of the land (善地);
Heart (心), virtue of the depths (善渊);
Giving (与), virtue of benevolence (善仁);
Speech (言), virtue of trustworthiness (善信);
Governance (政), virtue of rectitude (善治);
Affairs (事), virtue of ability (善能);
Action (动), virtue of timeliness (善时).

The Sage’s residence is virtuous in holding low and modest,
Following things naturally—
His influence extends to his village,
Like water flowing beneath the earth,
Dwelling in the depths and low places,
Nourishing all things—
Thus it is said: *virtuous in residence*—
This is the first virtue.

The Sage’s heart is virtuous in preserving emptiness and stillness,
Piercing the profound and subtle,
Clear and penetrating—
Like the depths of water, tranquil and undisturbed,
Though nine changes occur in its waves,
Its clarity and stillness remain unaltered—
Thus it is said: *virtuous in heart*—
This is the second virtue.

The Sage in giving is virtuous in practicing benevolence,
His kindness extending to all under heaven,
Without favoring kin or loved ones—
Like water’s oiliness, nourishing all,
Rising and falling with ease,
Nothing escapes its reach—
Thus it is said: *virtuous in giving*—
This is the third virtue.

The Sage’s speech is virtuous in upholding sincerity,
Not relying on external agreements,
Yet naturally harmonizing—
Like water’s reflection, without discrimination of beauty or ugliness,
Filling to the brim before it moves—
Flowing through dangers without loss—
Thus it is said: *virtuous in speech*—
This is the fourth virtue.

The Sage in governance is virtuous in rectifying the people,
His bearing upright and understanding profound—
Things submit naturally—
Like water’s clarity, settling high and low,
Purifying and cleansing all things,
Removing all dust and filth—
Thus it is said: *virtuous in governance*—
This is the fifth virtue.

The Sage in affairs is virtuous in ability,
Assigning roles according to aptitude—
No one is left unplaced—
Like water’s gentleness, accommodating all shapes and vessels,
Nothing it handles fails—
Thus it is said: *virtuous in affairs*—
This is the sixth virtue.

The Sage in action is virtuous in timeliness,
Emerging and retiring as circumstances demand—
His conduct preserves the Dao—
Like water’s movement, adapting to the times—
In winter, it solidifies; in summer, it flows—
It never deviates from its proper course—
Thus it is said: *virtuous in action*—
This is the seventh virtue.

Only because it does not contend,
Is there no resentment against it.
*Only* (唯) means *alone* (独).
This concludes the discourse on the three near-qualities and seven virtues above.

The Sage’s thoughts, conduct, and words,
His emergence and retirement—
All are complete in the wondrous Dao,
Conforming to the needs of things,
Yet ever maintaining *feminine* (雌) stillness,
Not contending with all things—
If things do not contend with it,
How could there be grounds for blame or resentment?

Again, *resentment* (尤) means *grudge* (怨).
It is said that only the Sage, who is alone in not contending,
Has no one to blame or resent.

The Dao’s essence is emptiness and nothingness,
Yet water’s number is one—
Only when the Sage employs it,
Does it approach the Dao.
It is also good at holding yet not overflowing,
Thus it is ranked next with *holding yet overflowing* (持而盈之).

*Holding yet overflowing* (持而盈之) is not as good as *early cessation* (其已).
*Overflowing* (盈) means *full* (满),
*Cessation* (已) means *stop* (止).
He who clings to fullness and overflowing,
Yet does not know humility and moderation,
Will inevitably see his downfall.
To avoid such ruin,
It is better to seek early cessation—
This is *laying down arms* (垂械).

Master Yan Junping (严君平) wrote: *"accumulating yet overflowing"* (殖而盈之),
Referring to amassing wealth and treasures.
*Measuring yet sharpening* (揣而锐之) cannot be long preserved.
*Measuring* (揣) means *calculating* (度).」

「Again, this is about *governance* (治). *Truly sharp* (锐) means *keen and cutting* (铦利). It speaks of how people know only of their sharp, greedy desires, yet pursue wealth and honor with reckless abandon, yet fail to discern the calculated folly (揣度) of their passions, and to govern themselves with moderation (思治侨恣). When misfortune comes, it cannot be long preserved.

Master Yan Junping (君平) said: *"Wealth and honor to me are like ascending a mountain to gaze endlessly—*
*Power and status pass like a fleeting bolt of lightning.*
This is to say they cannot be long preserved."

*The *Honglie Jie* (《鸿烈解》) records: White Gongsheng (白公胜) seized a state’s treasury but could not distribute its wealth. After seven days, Shi Qi (石乞) entered and said: *"What is gained unjustly cannot be kept, and if you cannot share it, disaster will surely come."* Unable to give to others, he only brought harm to himself. White Gongsheng did not heed this warning. On the ninth day, Ye Gong (叶公) arrived and opened the treasury’s stores to distribute among the people, while also raising taxes to fund soldiers. White Gongsheng attacked him, but nineteen days later, he was captured.

To claim a state that is not rightfully yours,
Yet fail to share its wealth,
Is to be the most avaricious (至贪).
To take without giving to others,
Yet lack the wisdom to benefit oneself,
Is to be the most foolish (至愚).
Compare White Gongsheng’s fate to the *Ur* (臬) who loved his son—
How different is it?

Thus it is said:
*Holding yet overflowing* (持而盈之) is not as good as *early cessation* (其已),
*Measuring yet sharpening* (揣而锐之) cannot be long preserved.
Gold and jade fill the halls,
Yet none can keep them.
This illustrates the inevitable truth:
*Fullness cannot be long held.*

Gold and jade in a chamber
May only moisten the house,
Yet when a great thief arrives,
He will seize baskets and bags in haste,
Though wise men may dwell within,
None can guard them.
Thus even beasts know this—
The elephant fears the hunter’s blade and loses its tusks,
The rooster dreads sacrifice and sheds its tail.
Even beasts recognize this,
Yet how do humans fail to reflect?

Master Yan Junping (严君平) and Wang Bi (王弼) wrote: *"Gold and jade fill the chamber"* (金玉满室).
Wealth and honor, if indulged in excess (侨),
Bring ruin upon oneself.
*遗* (遗) means *to bestow* (与).
Wealth invites others to seek it,
So one easily deceives himself.
Honor makes others subservient,
So one easily oppresses others.
Deceit and oppression grow daily,
Disaster and blame will surely follow—
This ruin is self-inflicted, is it not?

Master Yan Junping (君平) further said:
*"Gold and jade harm the body,*
*Status and power corrupt the spirit—*
Like ice and fire,
They cannot coexist."
Thus, *status is the spirit’s impurity* (名者神之秽),
*wealth is the body’s harm* (利者身之害).
Nurturing the spirit’s impurity,
Accumulating the body’s harm,
Damages what is already achieved,
And aids what is already flawed.
Gaining them brings benefit,
Losing them brings ruin—
Then one’s thoughts are muddled,
And his discernment of gain and loss is perverse.

Again he said:
*"Those who increase my wealth*
*Diminish my spirit,*
*Those who bring me fame*
*Destroy my body.*
Misfortune arises from within myself,
Not from others.
Fortune arises from within myself,
Not from heaven."*

Master Lu Xisheng (陆希声) said:
*"To hold a great office yet overflow with arrogance (满盈),*
Though one fears it,
It is better to cease early.
To occupy a high position yet exceed its limits (亢极),*
Though one worries,
It is better to withdraw early.
To calculate power and wealth yet sharpen one’s ambitions (锐意),*
Though one gains them,
They cannot be preserved forever.
To hoard gold and jade while the halls overflow,*
Though one possesses them,
They cannot be kept long.
If one is honored yet extravagant (侨), he invites disaster;
If one is wealthy yet extravagant (侨), he multiplies his faults.
Hubris grows within the heart,
And its punishment comes from oneself—
Why blame heaven or reproach others?"*

*"Great deeds accomplished,*
*Fame secured,*
*Then step back—*
This is the Dao of heaven.
Whoever understands this,
Knowing when to advance and retreat,
To preserve or perish,
Is the Sage indeed.
External fullness injures life—
Rather than sharpen one’s focus on wealth and honor,
It is better to embrace simplicity (抱一) and avoid blame,
Thus follows the teaching: *Carry the vital essence (营魄), embrace unity (抱一).*

*Carrying the vital essence (载营魄), embracing unity (抱一),*
Can one truly remain undivided?

The Daoists say:
*The spirit of yang is called *hun* (魂),*
*The hun delights in life,*
*The shade of yin is called *po* (魄),*
*The po favors death.*
*The hun roams,*
*The po remains still.*

*The *Baihu Tong* (《白虎通》) states:*
*"The hun is the wandering essence,*
*Qi is the undetermined form,*
Thus the hun is called *ying* (营)."*
The old commentary says:
*载* (载) means *to bear* (乘).
*营* (营) refers to the *hun* (魂).
It is also said that *ying* (营) means *to protect the yang qi*.
The *hun* is the yang essence,
The *po* is the yin spirit.
The yang essence favors movement and wandering,
Thus Daoist scriptures speak of *restraining and retaining* (拘留).
The yin spirit favors agitation and deception,
Thus Daoist scriptures teach methods of *subduing and controlling* (制伏).
If one’s form and essence always bear the yang essence and yin spirit,
And embrace the pure, unified *tàihé* (太和) *qi*,
Keeping them from scattering,
Then one may forever preserve longevity.

The Dao’s embrace of unity (抱一)
Is like a *yì* (镒) containing its brilliance—
Can brilliance ever separate from the mirror?
This teaches how to nurture the spirit (养神).

Now I explain:
If one seeks to guard unity (抱一之卫),
One must keep the heart undivided.
If the heart remains undivided,
Then it is bearing the *hun* and *po*,
And embracing the pure, unified Dao.
Can one be like an infant (婴儿)?
The following passages are all interpreted in this way.

*Concentrating qi to achieve softness (专气致柔),*
Can one be like an infant?

The old commentary says:
*专* (专) means *unified* (一) and *to entrust* (任).
*Qi* (气) is the *chōnghé miàoqì* (冲和妙气) of harmony and subtlety,
And also the natural *qi* of the body.
When a person stands alone, distinct from all else,
He receives the natural, harmonious, and subtle *qi*.
As *qi* descends and form is born,
It remains untainted and pure.
If one concentrates and entrusts oneself to this harmonious, subtle *qi*,
Forgets all perceptions and knowledge,
Then *qi* will naturally remain pure and harmonious,
And the body will naturally be soft and weak,
Unharmed by the evils of others—
This is attaining the infant’s complete harmony.
This teaches how to nurture *qi* (养气).

Now I explain:
*"Can one be like an infant?"*
It means:
If one seeks to guard *qi* through concentration and softness (专气致柔之卫),
One must be like an infant in purity and harmony.
If one can be like an infant in purity and harmony,
Then one has attained the guarding of *qi* through concentration and softness.

*Washing away impurities, gazing into the profound (涤除玄览),*
Can one be without blemish?

The old commentary says:
*涤* (涤) means *to wash* (洗).
*除* (除) means *to dispel* (遣).
*玄览* (玄览) is *mind’s illumination* (心照).
*Blemishes and flaws* (疵瑕) are *diseases* (病).
One must wash away dust and filth,
Dispel the five passions (五情),
Keep inner and outer purity,
Illumine all things with the mind—
Then blemishes and flaws, like diseases,
Will vanish without trace.
This teaches how to cultivate the heart (修心).」

From here, the three matters above exhort one to cultivate the person;
From here, the three matters below urge one to govern the state.

The *Classic* says:
*"Cultivate it in the person, and its virtue becomes true;
Cultivate it in the world, and its virtue becomes universal."*

Now it is explained:
If one seeks to wash the heart, dispel filth, and fathom inner and outer affairs,
And can reflect upon oneself without blemish or disease,
Then this is the method of *washing away and profound illumination*.

Can one govern the people with love and the state without action?

The old commentary says:
*"To govern the state is to love the people as one’s own children.
In administering affairs, one must not be harsh or cruel;
Taxes and labor must not harm their nature.
One should focus on agriculture, simplify governance,
And let the people pursue their occupations in peace,
Thus ensuring their well-being—
This is the transformation of *wuwei*."*

Now it is explained:
If a ruler seeks to nurture the ten thousand people without harming their natural endowment,
And governs by fostering agriculture while keeping affairs clear and still,
Then this is the art of loving the people and governing the state.

Can one be receptive like the female principle?

*The Heavenly Gate* is the gate of Nature.
Nature gives birth to the *Taiji*;
The *Taiji* gives birth to Heaven and Earth;
Heaven and Earth give birth to yin and yang;
Yin and yang give birth to the ten thousand things;
The ten thousand things live and die through it, coming and going—
Thus it is called the *Heavenly Gate*.
*Opening* means to disperse and give;
*Closing* means to gather and withdraw.
When it opens, life flourishes;
When it closes, things decay and perish.
Though it gives birth to all things, one does not see its *generating*;
Though it brings death to all things, one does not see its *destroying*.
Life and death unfold unseen—
How could it not be called Nature?

Only the *Great Person* can embody Nature.
The *Great Person* encompasses the universe in measure,
And contains yin and yang in *qi*.

Through receptive stillness,
The transformations of life and death, rise and decline
Do not enter the mind.

*Receptive stillness* is the subtle function of Nature.
This warns those who cultivate the person and govern the state
To guard with receptive stillness.

The old commentary says:
*"The *Heavenly Gate* is the gate of the Northern Pole within the Purple Enclosure.
Heaven has the Northern Pole, with stars within the Purple Enclosure,
And within the enclosure are the Five Emperors,
Who take turns in their reigns—
Thus the gate opens and closes.
When it opens, it is *Tai* (harmony);
When it closes, it is *Pi* (blockage).
Thus, in spring, the Green Emperor’s gate opens,
While the others close—
And the seasons follow this pattern.
Moreover, the Five Phases cycle endlessly,
And the changes of time and fate are unceasing.
Only the sage knows Heaven and follows the Mandate,
Ever guarding receptive stillness,
Thus never swayed by change—
Hence eternal prosperity and great good fortune.

Some interpret this in terms of personal cultivation:
The *Heavenly Gate* refers to the nose and mouth;
*Opening and closing* refers to breathing and exhalation.
Speaking of one who is receptive, still, and yielding,
Their breath becomes deep and subtle,
Continuous and refined,
Nurturing the spirit in effortless ease."*

Now it is explained:
The opening and closing of the *Heavenly Gate* in its cycles
Is the natural order of time—
Only by being receptive and humble
Can one remain unmoved by yin and yang,
Unchanged by cold and heat.

Can one be clear and open in all directions?

Can one be without knowing?

The old saying speaks of *day’s clarity*—this is wisdom’s illumination.
Though one cultivating the self may possess this luminous wisdom,
And though their ears and eyes are sharp and their understanding vast,
If they lack perception and hearing,
Then the one governing the realm must cultivate virtue as bright as the sun and moon,
Illuminating the four quarters of the land—
Yet they must block their ears and veil their eyes,
And act as though they know nothing.

To make the people of the world live unaware in their daily lives—
This is called *the Dao*.

Now it is explained:
To attain wisdom and clarity in all directions,
One must first withdraw the senses and return to stillness,
Ever guarding *non-knowing*—
This is the root of clarity and boundless understanding.

To nurture and preserve,
To give birth yet not possess,
To act yet not rely upon it,
To grow yet not control—
This is called *Mysterious Virtue*.

Speaking of cultivating the self and governing the realm,
If one practices these six principles,
It is like the Dao’s generation—
Things are not obstructed at their source;
They are left to complete themselves naturally.

And in nourishing virtue,
Things are not constrained in their nature;
They are left to complete themselves naturally.

Thus, virtue shines forth alone,
And only the sage is born—
How could this be otherwise?

All creatures attend to their own affairs—
What does the sage rely upon?

Things grow and nurture themselves—
What does the sage control?

This is to forget merit, forget things,
Pierce the depths of obscurity—
This is called *Mysterious Virtue*.

Wang Bi says:
*Mysterious Virtue* is having virtue yet not knowing its master,
Emerging from the depths of darkness.

Embrace the One without departing from focused *qi*,
Achieve the harmony of an infant—
When harmony is attained, all things return as spokes converge to the hub,
Thus the thirty spokes unite in one hub.

The thirty spokes unite in one hub—
When the hub is empty, the wheel’s function is realized.
This illustrates how *having* and *non-having* support each other in utility.

The *Zhou Li: Kao Gong Ji* states:
The carriage’s canopy is round to symbolize Heaven’s vehicle,
Its square base follows Earth’s law,
And the thirty spokes symbolize the number of days in a month.

The moon hangs in Heaven, flowing endlessly,
The wheel rolls across Earth, turning without end.
Thus, the carriage symbolizes the moon—
Thirty days complete one month,
Just as thirty spokes unite in one hub.

When the hub’s center is empty, the wheel can turn.
The carriage’s emptiness allows it to bear its load.
Thus, the void’s emptiness holds the function of turning and bearing.

Jun Ping said:
In the age of ancient sages governing the people,
They followed what Heaven and Earth naturally did,
And did not contrive clever artifices.
They drank from gourds, ate with their hands,
And all things were equal, with no high or low.

When rulers began to act,
Taxes grew heavy, labor burdensome,
The people exhausted—
The upper classes no longer sang,
Tribute came from afar,
Men and women bore loads they could not bear.

Thus, the wise invented the *pushing-hub carriage*,
Hitching horses and oxen to bear heavy burdens over long distances,
Easing the people’s toil.

Later generations followed suit,
And clever creations multiplied—
Carved and painted hubs,
Gilded wheels adorned with silver and jade,
And emerald pendants—
The cost of one carriage could impoverish a family.
Thus, Laozi lamented how artificial contrivances harm morality,
And how doing good can breed chaos.

Hence, the three things—carriage, tools, and dwellings—
Illustrate how *having* and *non-having* mutually support utility,
And serve as a warning.

Mixing clay to make vessels—
When the center is empty, the vessel’s function is realized.
*Cao* means blending,
*Ni* means clay—
The artisan blends and molds clay,
Shaping it into vessels,
Taking the empty space within to hold all things.

Jun Ping said:
In times when morality decays,
Worries assail from within,
And yin and yang harm from without—
The people grow weak, emaciated, and sickly.
Thus, water and fire arise together,
The five flavors take form,
Raw and cooked are indistinguishable,
Drying and moistening are confused.
Hence, the wise mix clay to make vessels,
To cook sour and salty foods,
And eventually indulge in hunting, luxury, and licentiousness,
Slaughtering creatures and cracking eggshells to please the ruler,
Carving jade into bowls and plates,
Refining crude materials into tools—
Until it reaches this point.

Piercing doors and windows to make dwellings—
When the center is empty, the dwelling’s function is realized.
*Zao* means to pierce.

Half-door and daily door.
The window beside the door is called *yǒu* (牖).
Door, window, and *yǒu*—these are also general terms.

In ancient times, when dwelling in caves,
One would pierce and hollow out the earth within,
Covering it above to form doors and windows for dwellings.
Taking the empty space within the dwelling,
Humans found a place to rest, enter, and exit.

Jun Ping said:
Once human hearts change,
All things harbor resentment—
Worms and snakes rise,
Poisonous silkworms act,
Birds and beasts harm people.
Thus, even caves prove insufficient
To defend against calamities,
Preserve life,
Or complete one’s natural years.

Therefore, the wise constructed dwellings—
Roofs above, eaves below,
Windows pierced for observation,
Sturdy gates and firm closures,
Swiftly opening and shutting,
So that wasps and insects could not enter,
And beasts could not approach.
Only then did it lead to ornate pavilions,
Lofty towers,
The Alang Palace’s halls,
Great gates guarding strategic passes,
Fortified cities,
Soldiers exhausted and dying in countless numbers.

Yet what was considered governance in ancient times
Is seen as chaos in later ages—
This stems from the mutual drawbacks of *you* (有) and *wu* (无),
For it lies in human nature itself.

Thus, *you* is used for advantage,
And *wu* is used for function.
This resolves the three matters above,
Illustrating that *you* and *wu* mutually rely on each other
And neither can be discarded.
*You* is used for advantage—advantage lies in vessels.
*Wu* is used for function—function lies in emptiness.

The utility of vessels
Must exist externally,
Drawing on emptiness to fulfill their purpose.
The function of emptiness
Must be internally void,
Borrowing from vessels to achieve its use.

Thus, *wu* relies on *you* for advantage,
And *you* relies on *wu* for function.

*Wu* aligns with the Dao,
*You* manifests as vessels.
That which is above form is called the Dao.
The Dao is formless.
Though the Dao is formless,
It must rely on *you* to display its efficacy.
That which is below form is called vessels.
Vessels have substance.
Though vessels have substance,
They must rely on *wu* to fulfill their function.

Thus, vessels without the Dao cannot be applied,
And the Dao without vessels cannot display its function.
It is like the hub having spokes,
Vessels containing things,
Dwellings housing people—
All rely on *wu* to benefit *you*,
And on *you* to utilize *wu*.

As for cultivating the body,
The spirit is the advantage for sustaining life,
Emptiness is the function for attaining the spirit.
Thus, *wu* enables function,
And *you* benefits things.
The advantage of *you* lies in sustaining life,
While the function of *wu* lies in attaining the spirit.
*Wu* is the state of emptiness and tranquility,
*You* is the state of spiritual clarity.

Spiritual clarity is the subtle *you*,
Emptiness and tranquility is the ultimate *wu*.
The advantage of subtle *you* lies in sustaining life,
The function of ultimate *wu* lies in attaining the spirit.
The advantages and functions of sustaining life and attaining the spirit
Do not exceed subtle *you* and ultimate *wu*.

The establishment of chariots and tools
Uses *wu* to benefit *you*—
*Wu* is emptiness,
*You* is form,
Thus, it follows with the five colors.

The five colors blind the eyes,
The five tones deafen the ears,
The five flavors dull the palate.

The five colors were originally established
To manifest the symbols of the Five Phases,
With *fǔfù* (黼黻) patterns and decorations
Distinguishing the adornments of rank—
This is the proper use of the five colors.
Yet later generations indulged in brocades and silks,
With green and yellow pleasing the eye,
Chasing external objects,
Draining vitality and impairing vision,
Unable to perceive the color beyond color—
What else but blindness?

The five tones were originally established
To manifest the sounds of the Five Phases,
With metal, stone, silk, and bamboo
Harmonizing the *qi* of Heaven and Earth—
This is the proper use of the five tones.
Yet later generations composed *Zheng* and *Wei* music,
With licentious melodies pleasing the ear,
Indulging without restraint,
Shaking the spirit and blocking hearing,
Unable to listen to the sound beyond sound—
What else but deafness?

The five flavors were originally established
To manifest the harmony of the Five Phases,
With salt and vinegar moderating,
Nourishing human relationships—
This is the proper use of the five flavors.
Yet later generations craved bear’s paw,
With coarse meats delighting the palate,
Gluttony without end,
Corrupting the spirit and defiling purity,
Unable to taste the flavor beyond flavor—
What else but dullness? *Cuan* (爽) means loss,
*Cha* (差) means error.

Galloping in hunts drives the mind to madness.
Hunting is the state’s customary ritual,
To practice martial affairs
And demonstrate the seasons to the people.
The Son of Heaven and feudal lords
Each year held three hunts:
One for *gān dòu* (乾豆) offerings,
To sacrifice at ancestral temples.
One for guests,
To foster goodwill between states.
One to replenish the ruler’s kitchen stores in season.
If hunting is not done in season,
It is called disrespectful.
Hunting out of season
Is called ravaging nature.
Thus, spring searches, summer inspects seedlings,
Autumn fills stores, winter hunts.
If one does not follow these laws,
Galloping recklessly across borders,
Exhausting wildlands without restraint,
Harming crops and farmers,
Climbing cliffs and crossing dangers,
The mind and spirit grow disordered—
What else but madness?

Valuable goods cause one to act recklessly.
Gold, silver, jade, and pearls—
These are rare treasures.
If one greedily pursues them without measure,
Or ceaselessly seeks them,
The Dao becomes obstructed and injured,
And the body suffers labor and humiliation.

Jun Ping said:
When the five colors are excessive, the world grows blind;
When the five tones are harmonized, the world grows deaf;
When the five flavors are balanced, the world grows dull;
When hunting flourishes, the world grows mad;
When jade and pearls are prized, the world grows weary;
When currency and silk circulate, the world grows impoverished.

Thus, the five colors are like daggers piercing the eyes,
The five tones are like mallets blocking the ears,
The five flavors are like blades severing the tongue,
And hunting is the leader of madness.

Pursuing distant goods brings ruin,
And valuing difficult-to-obtain things brings scarcity.
All these things
Transform and generate one another,
Unfathomable and endless,
Difficult to clarify yet easy to extinguish,
Difficult to obtain yet easy to lose.

Calamities and disasters
Are the chambers of peril and annihilation.
Seeking them brings self-harm,
Dwelling in them brings self-destruction.

This is both a warning to the sovereign
And instruction to the common people.

Thus, the Sage prioritizes the belly over the eyes,
And so discards the former to take the latter.

The Sage refers to the ruler who follows the Dao.

The ruler who follows the Dao allows his mind to wander beyond sound and color, while nurturing the boundless inner radiance. The belly—when it receives nourishment and fills with substance—does not chase after things, thus preserving its wholeness and attaining spiritual sovereignty. Therefore, the Sage follows this principle and prioritizes the belly.

The eyes—when they fixate on colors and cause disorder—lead one to chase after things, thus blinding the outer senses and dissipating vital essence. Therefore, the Sage warns against this and does not indulge the eyes.

To "discard the former and take the latter" means to abandon the eyes' pursuit of things and embrace the belly's inner completeness.

Indulging in the pleasures of sound and color leads to slaughter and disgrace, while not valuing hard-to-obtain goods brings honor and prosperity. Thus, honor and disgrace follow.

Honor and disgrace are like sudden alarms.
Honor refers to wealth, nobility, celebrations, and rewards—all that is fortunate.
Disgrace refers to poverty, humiliation, punishment, and misfortune—all that is calamitous.

Those who grasp the Dao regard the body as a temporary lodging, and life and death as burdensome afflictions. They neither rejoice in prosperity nor fear adversity, knowing that official rank and external possessions are mere transient dependencies. How could honor and disgrace bind their hearts and cause constant alarm?

This speaks of honor and disgrace as sudden alarms—words meant for the average person.
The moderately wise, dwelling in safety yet mindful of peril, fearing disgrace even in honor, thus react as if alarmed.
Common folk flee toward trivial pursuits, alarmed by disgrace, while the moderately wise, observing the fundamental Dao, are alarmed by honor—hence, "honor and disgrace are like sudden alarms."

To hold great afflictions as one’s own body.
"Great afflictions" refers to official rank, treasures, and external possessions that sustain life.
The perfected one knows the body is not truly theirs, yet they still cling to externals—how much more so do they cling to what they revere?

Now, people of the world claim that official rank and treasures can sustain life, thus valuing them as their own body, unaware that both the body and external things are the roots of great sighing and are unworthy of reverence.

What is meant by "honor and disgrace"? Honor is superior; disgrace is inferior.
*(Original note: The *Kaoyuan* text reads "honor is inferior, disgrace is superior.")*
It means that when one attains wealth and nobility, relying on honor leads to arrogance and ruin. If ruin comes from honor, then honor is the root of disgrace—thus, "honor is inferior."
*(Original note: The *Heshang Gong* and *Huangfu Mi* texts also read "honor is superior, disgrace is inferior," meaning gain is superior, loss is inferior.)*
To gain is like being alarmed; to lose is like being alarmed—this is called "honor and disgrace are like sudden alarms," concluding the meaning.

The vulgar cling to their wealth and rank—holding them brings trembling, losing them brings sorrow. They do not understand that gain and loss are not truly theirs, so they are all seized by alarm.
The moderately wise know that fortune and misfortune cycle like a knot. If one enjoys honor and prosperity, decay and disgrace will inevitably follow, so they guard against overreaching, fearing loss as they would alarm.

*The Liezi* says: Zhao Xiangzi sent envoys to attack Di, capturing two cities yet wearing a worried expression. He said, "I have great virtue and heavy deeds; how can I not be vigilant?" Confucius heard this and said, "The Zhao clan will surely flourish—this is gaining as if alarmed."

What is meant by "to hold great afflictions as one’s own body"? My greatest affliction is that I have a body. When I have no body, what affliction do I have?
*(The repeated "what is meant by" marks a question-and-answer structure to introduce the following explanation.)*
The reason one has great affliction is that they have a body.
The human body, lacking fur or feathers to resist cold and heat, must rely on external things to nourish life and preserve existence. Yet those who cling excessively to life often court death, and thus great sighing follows.
This arises from being ensnared by worldly attachments, clinging to the idea of having a body.

If one transcends the body, no longer treating it as their own, forgetting the mind and no longer treating it as their own, merging with the natural transformations and aligning with all things—moving as if dragging dead wood, sitting as if gathering cold ashes—then the former afflictions of honor, disgrace, and great peril, what harm can they bring?
Thus it is said: *When I have no body, what affliction do I have?*

In *"On Equality of All Things,"* Zi Cha said to Yan Yan: "Now I have lost myself—do you know this?"
*(Original note: "Lost" here means "forgotten" or "transcended.")*
To abandon illumination and attain seated forgetfulness is to still greater afflictions—how much more so for those who naturally merge with existence?
*(Original note: Some interpret "no body" as annihilation or emptiness, but this misses the essence of Laozi’s teaching.)*

Thus, to hold the body as precious for the sake of the world is to be able to entrust the world to it.
To love the body as precious for the sake of the world is to be able to deposit the world in it.
From the perspective of transcending the body upward, this broadly addresses how common people and scholars are seized by honor and disgrace, leading to great affliction.
From the perspective of valuing and loving downward, it specifically speaks of rulers who have not yet forgotten the world, hence the language of entrustment.

Yet the idea of entrustment is not the virtue of the highest Sage. If one’s heart wanders in tranquility, blends with the boundless, follows nature without artifice, then one may restore the winds of antiquity.
Lu Xi-sheng said: If one’s heart is disturbed by gain and loss, clinging to external things, then honor and disgrace never bring lasting peace, and fortune and misfortune never cease. How can such a one govern the world or hold the great position within the realm?

Only those who hold the body as precious for the world’s sake, loving the body as precious for the world’s sake, truly value and love the world, not their own bodies.
Thus, gain and loss lie beyond them, and worries and afflictions do not cling to their person. Even so, they dare not claim dominion over the world—how much less would they seize it as their own?

This is the Way of Great Dao, the intent of the public realm.
*(Original note: The *Kaoyuan* text reads: "Thus, to hold the body as precious for the world is to be able to entrust the world; to love the body as precious for the world is to be able to deposit the world." The commentary says: This chapter begins with a warning against honor and disgrace, concluding with the idea of entrustment. If one is alarmed by honor and disgrace, they have not forgotten them; if they value and love [the body], they have not forgotten [their attachments].")*

Thus, comparing disgrace to honor, disgrace is not as worthy as honor;
comparing virtue to love, virtue is not as profound as love.

Those alarmed by honor and disgrace still cling to their hearts;
those who cherish virtue and love have not yet forgotten the world entirely.

Hence, first, one must make the alarm of honor akin to disgrace,
then seek to forget both honor and disgrace entirely.
Using the near-name of entrustment, one argues for the ultimate of forgetting both—
forgetting honor and disgrace means nothing remains to alarm,
forgetting the body means no root for affliction,
forgetting the world means no need for the near-name of entrustment.

The *Wang Bi* text reads:
*"Thus, if one values the body for the sake of the world, then one can entrust the world.
If one loves the body for the sake of the world, then one can deposit the world."*
Wang Bi’s commentary states:
*"There is nothing to exchange for the body, hence ‘virtue’—
thus one can entrust the world.
There is nothing to diminish the body, hence ‘love’—
thus one can deposit the world.
Only when honor and disgrace, glory and calamity,
do not diminish or exchange the body,
can the world then truly be entrusted."*

The *Zhuangzi: "Zai You"* chapter’s citation is taken as definitive,
with Wang Bi’s text ranked secondary.
The commentary aids in elucidation, though its phrasing is inferior.
It is suspected that the *Kaoyuan* text’s collation may have added or omitted passages,
thus losing the original intent.

When both honor and disgrace alarm, the mind is not yet free—
only those who conform to the Way are effortless and formless,
hence the progression to *"what cannot be seen."*

The *Zhuangzi* states: "Thus one can entrust the world."
Since there is nothing to diminish the body, it is called **"Yī"**—
thus one can deposit the world.
When honor and disgrace, glory and calamity,
do not diminish or exchange the body,
only then can the world truly be entrusted.

**Yī** (原本作 *jī*), in ancient texts, refers to the subtle and formless.
The *Yìjīng* says: "Subtle (*jī*) is the faintest stir of movement."
Though this meaning exists, it is now preserved but not discussed.

That which cannot be heard is called **"Xī"** (希).
That which cannot be grasped is called **"Wēi"** (微).
These three—**Yī**, **Xī**, and **Wēi**—
cannot be summoned or invoked,
so they are merged into one.
The Dao is difficult to describe and define,
thus the Sage names it with reluctant necessity.

The Dao is not a visible thing,
yet cannot be seen with the eyes—
thus, within the formless,
it manifests all forms,
and is therefore called **Yī** (夷).
**Yī** means "level"—
it describes the boundless, tranquil state
where, though present in form,
there is no form at all.

The Dao is not a sound,
yet cannot be heard with the ears—
thus, within the silent,
it gives rise to all sounds,
and is therefore named **Xī** (希).
**Xī** means "sparse"—
like objects scattered thinly,
without striking or touching,
it is sound yet not sound.

The Dao is not a shape,
yet cannot be grasped by the hands—
thus, within the shapeless,
it takes on all shapes,
and is therefore called **Wēi** (微).
**Wēi** means "wondrous"—
it is subtle and profound,
without substance or boundary,
yet is shape without shape.

Only the **Perfect Sage** (至人) perceives with the spirit
the formless form of the Dao,
and emerges beyond all forms.
With **qi** attuned, he hears the soundless sound,
and emerges beyond all sounds.
With the mind discerning, he grasps the shapeless shape,
and emerges beyond all shapes.

These three—**Xī**, **Yī**, and **Wēi**—
are forced names for the Dao’s operation,
not its true, inherent existence,
so they cannot be examined or questioned.
Thus, they should be merged and understood as the supreme unity.

Jun Ping says:
*"Before the great wild goose (*hóng*) is fully formed,
cut open its egg and look inside—
it is not yet the goose,
yet its shape, sound, head, and tail
are all already present.
This is the formless goose within the egg.
How much more so,
when even the egg of the goose does not yet exist,
and yet the Transforming Power (*zàohuà*) creates it!"*

From this, it is clear:
The origin of the **Supreme Ultimate** (*Tàijí*),
before Heaven and Earth,
already contains subtle traces of shape and sound,
though unseen and unheard.
Thus, it is evident:

Those who do not see with the eyes can see,
those who do not hear with the ears can hear,
those who do not follow with the hands can grasp,
those who do not speak with words can explain.
Therefore, the shapeless shape,
from which Heaven and Earth arise,
is called **Yī** (夷).
The soundless sound,
from which the five tones begin,
is called **Xī** (希).
The formless trace,
from which myriad things emerge,
is called **Wēi** (微).

These are the paths the ancient sages pointed toward.
If one forgets seeing and hearing,
truly follows and grasps,
and merges all into boundless unity,
then the Dao is fully attained and exhausted—
nothing more can be added.

Its upper reaches are not bright,
its lower depths are not dark.
Endless and unbroken, beyond naming,
it returns to the formless.
**Yī** (绳绳) means endless continuity,
without bounds.

This is called the **indescribable state** (*wúzhuàng zhī zhuàng*),
the **formless image** (*wúwù zhī xiàng*),
or **dim and vague** (惚怳).

To return to the formless is not to speak of emptiness—
it means that within the stateless state,
all forms are created,
and within the imageless image,
all things are transformed.
To say "it exists" would be wrong,
yet things arise from it—
this is **having without having**.
To say "it does not exist" would also be wrong,
yet things arise through it—
this is **having without having**.
Existence and nonexistence are indeterminate—
this is called **dim and vague** (惚怳).
**Hū** (惚) is "nonexistence,"
yet speaks of nonexistence as if it were existence.
**Huàng** (怳) is "vague,"
yet speaks of existence as if it were nonexistence.
Thus, it is called **dim and vague**.

Approach it, yet you cannot see its head.
Follow it, yet you cannot see its tail.
The Dao precedes Heaven and Earth,
and endures beyond the ancient past—
how did it come into being?
No one knows its origin,
thus you cannot see its head.
Yet it persists through all ages,
and extends beyond countless eons—
how does it end?
No one knows its conclusion,
thus you cannot see its tail.

This is what prompts one
to clear their **spiritual platform** (*língtái*)
and model themselves after the Dao’s essence.

To hold the ancient Dao
and govern the present is to know
the origin of antiquity—
this is called the **principle of the Dao** (*dàojì*).
The ancient Dao is formless and nameless,
the root of Heaven and Earth,
the ancestor of all things—
the Dao that cannot be seen or heard.

The *Lǎozǐ*’s method for cultivating the self and the world
is to uphold the ancient, natural Way of nonaction (*wúwéi zìrán*),
to restrain the present’s artificial, vexatious customs (*yǒuwéi fánnǎo*),
and to return to simplicity,
recovering the **Supreme Beginning** (*Tàishǐ*),
so that each may rectify their nature and life—
not shifting their virtue—
this is called the **framework of the Dao’s principle**.

Seeing and hearing cannot be summoned,
dim and vague beyond form—
only the **good scholar** (*shànshì*)
can hold the ancient Dao
and govern the present’s artificiality.

Thus, it follows with the **good scholar of antiquity** (古之善为士者).
The *True Classic of the Dao and Virtue* concludes here.

**The True Classic of the Dao and Virtue: *Zàngshì Zuǎnwēi* (Volume Three)**
*Compiled by Bìxū Zǐ Chén Jǐngyuán*

**The Dao Classic**

The **good scholar of antiquity**—
subtle, profound, and ineffable,
deep beyond recognition—
was one who, in the **Supreme Beginning**,
governed self and realm
through the natural Way,
his virtue vast yet hidden,
his spirit bright yet distant,
his wisdom piercing the void,
his sincerity unobstructed.
Thus his bearing was profound and thick—
who could truly know the *Lǎozǐ*?

For the Dao seems great yet appears unworthy,
as when **Liezi** dwelt in Zheng
yet none could recognize him—
this was the **good scholar of antiquity**.

Since he could not be known,
he feigned outward form.
The **good scholar of the Way**,
his virtue deep and boundless,
difficult to discern,
fearing later ages might lack his model,
thus he spoke of his bearing and demeanor,
pointing out his conduct and posture—
this is the **lower text**.

**Like winter crossing a river,**
*Yù*—hesitant, as if—
the **good scholar of the Way**,
following nature without resistance,
neither hastening fortune nor provoking calamity,
yet in all actions, cautious and reserved,
though walking smooth paths,
ever wary of drowning,
as in bitter winter’s month,
venturing across a long river,
his heart hesitant yet doubtful,
fearing to sink into unfathomable depths.

**Like fearing four neighbors,**
the **good scholar of the Way**,
ever treading the void yet daring no action,
in retreat or engagement, deeply contemplative,
fearing judgment in the realms of light and dark,
as common folk avoid taboos,
dreading neighbors’ secret knowledge—
this is the depth of his caution.

**Solemn as a guest,**
the **good scholar of the Way**,
upright and composed,
his mind undistracted,
like a guest before his host,
how dare he act hastily?
His words: *"No action, no doing."*

As **Shùngé Shùnzǐ** bound his belt and straightened his bearing,
his presence dissolved all intent—
thus **Tiánzǐ Fāng** revered him as teacher.
**Lǐshè Guāng** dwelt in darkness,
as if before sovereign and parent—
thus **Sīmǎ Zǐwēi** praised him deeply.
This is called **solemn as a guest**.

**Dissolved like ice about to melt,**
the **good scholar of the Way**,
though outwardly stern,
his mind at ease, his wisdom unfettered—
like spring ice thawing,
dissolving and dispersing,
all rigidity gone.

**Sincere as uncarved wood,**
*Sincere*—in its pure thickness.
*Uncarved*—in its undivided simplicity.
*Uncarved*—before form’s division.
The **good scholar of the Way**,
naturally thick and pure,
speech and silence both unadorned.

**Vast as a valley,**
*Vast*—in its breadth.
*Valley*—in its hollow void.
The **good scholar of the Way**,
his virtue thick yet unseen,
his capacity wide yet encompassing,
bearing good and ill alike,
like an empty valley’s echo—
always void.

**Mixed as muddy water.**
*Mixed*—as waves churn.
*Muddy*—when clarity is lost.
The **good scholar of the Way**,
his heart serene within,
yet outward currents swirl—
like turbid water’s obscurity,
how could beauty or ugliness be distinguished?

The seven matters above:
if applied to ruling a realm,
the people know not, understand not,
returning to the **Supreme Beginning**;
if applied to cultivating the self,
harmonizing with dust and light,
obscured in the **Ultimate Way**—
who could muddy then clarify?
Stillness brings gradual clarity.

The **good scholar of the Way**,
his heart like a deep spring—
muddied yet settling,
stillness brings its clarity.

Who could remain steadfast yet endure?
Movement brings gradual life.
The **good scholar of the Way**,
his virtue fragmented—
when steadfast, enduring,
movement brings life’s fullness.

An old saying claims:
The **Perfect One** outwardly appears mixed and indistinct,
yet within, pure and clear—
aligned with the Dao’s essence,
gradually ascending,
borrowing from clarity’s truth.

Again, for the scholar’s sake,
fearing to dwell in this gradual clarity,
long yet unchanging,
lodged in all phenomena,
thus urged to move, seek superior methods,
until life’s gradual unfolding,
no longer clinging to forms,
reaching unbroken generation.

*One variant reads:*
Who could muddy then still—gradual clarity?
Who could remain steadfast yet move—gradual life?

**Preserve this Way without excess.**
Only by not being full
can one endure decay without renewal.
He who guards this gradual clarity and life,
well knows humility in self-cultivation,
dwelling in emptiness and stillness.

Only by not being full—
again, the **Perfect One** alone,
not boasting of completeness,
thus ever clinging to decay’s humility,
though new achievements arise,
he holds victory unmoved,
seeks further progress,
pursues higher virtue,
not resting in small gains—
this is the **Sage’s** profound path.

The **good scholar** follows antiquity,
his insight deep and subtle,
sincere, uncarved, vast and hollow—
attaining the **Way of the Hollow Valley’s Extremes**,
thus it follows with **attaining the Extremes of Emptiness**.

**Attaining the Extremes of Emptiness,**
**Guarding Stillness Firmly.**
*Attaining*—obtaining.
He who, desireless,
attains the **Void’s Way**,
reaches the **Obscure’s Extremes**,
yet steadfast in stillness,
his virtue becomes pure and thick.

*The *Lièzǐ* says:*
None surpasses stillness,
none surpasses emptiness—
stillness, emptiness,
obtaining their dwelling.

*The *Xīshēng Jīng* says:*
If one empties and does nothing,
not desiring the Way,
the Way itself returns.

*Yán Jūnping said:*
Dao and virtue are empty and void,
thus able to receive and bestow.
Heaven and Earth are clear and still,
thus able to transform.
Yin and Yang alternate,
thus able to give and take.
Sun and Moon advance and retreat,
thus able to shine.
The four seasons begin and end,
thus able to nurture and complete.

Remove emptiness and void—
Dao and virtue cannot endure.
Remove clarity and stillness—
Heaven and Earth cannot exist.
Advance without return—
Yin and Yang cannot circulate.
Move without retreat—
Sun and Moon cannot illuminate.
End without beginning—
All things cannot live.

Thus:
Having yet returning to nonhaving,
full yet returning to emptiness,
the heart bearing nothing,
the will displaying nothing,
doing nothing as if blocked,
unworried as if mad,
embracing truth, treading simplicity,
abandoning cleverness,
not knowing what is first,
emptiness as constant—
then spirit and clarity reach their peak,
naturally exhausted.

The movement of action returns to the self,
while thought and contemplation restore the spirit.
Hide me within the heart of no-mind,
carry the form within the body of no-self.
What does not benefit life,
do not use it to enslave the will.
What does not accord with Heaven,
do not use it to scatter the spirit.

When matters are simple yet the spirit remains unshaken,
when inner flow does not alter the outer,
when vision is inverted and hearing is reversed,
and the spirit moves in harmony—
above aligning with the Dao of Heaven,
below engaging with the world—
the spirit remains undisturbed,
vital qi unstrained,
naturally embracing contraction and extension,
thus attaining the Middle Way.

When all things act in concert,
I observe their return.
Human beings are born in stillness—
this is the nature of Heaven.
Now, those who speak of attaining ultimate emptiness
and steadfastly guarding stillness
are guiding people to return to their wondrous origin.
This is not merely for humanity.
Truly, when all things move together,
their origin has never failed to begin in profound tranquility,
emerging from formlessness,
born of harmonious qi,
responding to transformation.
When observed in their return,
they exhaustively revert to the boundless void,
returning to the trackless,
thus preserving their true form.

The *Classic of Changes* says:
*"Return—does it not reveal the heart of Heaven and Earth?"*
The heart of Heaven and Earth is profound stillness unto nothingness.

Jun Ping said:
*"Heaven and Earth return and invert,
thus able to endure eternally.
Humans return to sleep,
thus able to attain clarity.
Flying birds return to gather,
thus able to soar high.
Running beasts return to rest,
thus able to leap far.
Dragons and serpents return to their coils,
thus able to shine resplendent.
Grasses and trees return to their roots,
thus able to remain verdant.
When transformation returns,
spirit and clarity attain their proper place,
communing with the void and nothingness,
the soul resting, the vital breath at ease,
each finding its place—
the will tranquil, the qi harmonious,
the blood and vital essence in balance.
Even this temporary return to stillness
preserves the spirit—
how much more so for those who endure in the ultimate Dao!"*

All things, teeming and flourishing,
each return to their root.
Returning to the root is stillness;
stillness is returning to the vital command;
returning to the vital command is constancy.
Teeming—luxuriant in growth—
refers to plants and grasses.
Some say *yún yún*—
moving and acting, teeming and numerous—
refers to flying and walking creatures.
By analogy, though movement and stillness differ,
all return to their root.
The void is the boundless and formless;
stillness is profound and silent.
The boundless and silent—
this is the root of movement and stillness.

Moreover, the nonbeing is the origin of being,
stillness is the sovereign of agitation—
when movement reaches its peak,
it must return to stillness;
when being reaches its limit,
it must return to nonbeing.
The roots of grasses and trees are heavy,
resting low in stillness,
thus they thrive.
Flowers and leaves are light,
residing above in movement,
thus they wither and fall.
If even things abide thus,
how much more so for humanity?

Therefore, the Sage offers analogies
to make the people abandon their love of desires,
returning to the root of emptiness and stillness,
thus restoring the origin of their nature and vital command.
The origin of nature and vital command—
this is the boundless and obscure,
where sight does not perceive and hearing does not hear.
This is only for the wise to awaken to themselves.

Those who awaken to it
walk, stand, sit, and lie outside of emptiness and stillness,
yet respond to change without deviation—
these are those who attain constancy
and return to the vital command.

To know constancy is clarity.
To not know constancy is reckless action—disaster.
This speaks to the difficulty of the constant Dao,
yet even understanding it is enlightenment.

Those who awaken to the constant Dao
possess spirit that transforms without bounds,
nature that communicates with all,
qi that harmonizes with all—
they do not know of all things as "me,"
nor of "me" as all things,
thus able to tread upon water and fire,
pierce metal and stone,
reverse mountains and rivers,
shift cities and towns,
ride the void without falling,
touch the solid without breaking—
thousand transformations, ten thousand changes,
inexhaustible—
this is the spirit aligned with the constant Dao.

The next level:
their essence and vitality unwaning,
their visage like a maiden’s,
dwelling in the world for millennia,
borne aloft to immortality—
this is the form aligned with the constant Dao.

The next level:
speech and silence follow principle,
conduct and retreat accord with the times,
action aligns with the Yang’s rhythms,
shining yet not dazzling,
stillness aligns with the Yin’s virtue,
using obscurity to attain clarity—
worldly burdens cannot harm them,
their bodies free from blame—
this is the ability to wield the constant Dao.

If governing the body is the foundation,
then wielding the constant Dao is supreme.
Thus, it is said: *"To know constancy is clarity."*
Or, *"To grow ever clearer"*—
this is the doctrine of gradual enlightenment.
Having awakened to the constant Dao,
one must follow as described above.
Those who fail to awaken to the constant Dao
instead take spiritual transformation for monstrosity,
long life for falsehood,
ultimate emptiness and steadfast stillness for hollow retreat,
injuring vitality as annihilation—
they do not know strong knowing,
do not recognize strong discernment,
every thought false and deceptive,
every action disastrous and easy—
this is *"not maintaining virtue"*—
or bearing its shame.
Thus, it is said: *"Reckless action brings disaster."*

To know constancy is tolerance;
tolerance is impartiality;
impartiality is sovereignty;
sovereignty is the Way of Heaven;
the Way of Heaven is the Dao;
the Dao is enduring—
living without peril.

Those who know the constant Dao
respond to all things with benevolence,
saving without abandoning,
embracing without exclusion.
Embracing movement and stillness without selfishness,
their bosom opens boundlessly,
achieving true impartiality.
True impartiality without selfishness
spreads virtue universally across the world,
with none failing to return.
*"Sovereign"* means "to go forth."
When people return,
Heaven will aid them—
by nature, they oppose nothing,
thus called *True Persons*.
They emerge from being, enter nonbeing,
obscurely vast and all-pervading,
enduring with the Dao,
inexhaustible—
water and fire cannot harm them,
metal and stone cannot maim them,
worldly calamities cannot assail them—
what peril could there be?

Attaining emptiness, guarding stillness,
returning to the root, restoring the vital command—
this is to know constancy.
Those who know constancy walk the path of the Great Above,
thus ranked beneath the *Supreme Above*.
The *Supreme Above*—
the sovereign of primordial antiquity,
unnamed and unmarked—
the *"Highest Virtue that is not virtue."*
Its virtue cannot be surpassed,
thus called *Supreme Above*—
though it holds sovereign rank,
it does not claim exaltation,
letting all things act naturally,
each rectifying their nature and vital command.
Thus its teaching is effortless,
its governance untraceable,
actions arise with the times,
resources are leveraged for achievement—
the people use it daily without knowing its Dao,
only knowing of their sovereign above.

The sovereign—what power does he hold over me?

Zhuangzi said: In the age of supreme virtue, the worthy are not exalted, the capable are not employed. The ruler stands like a pole marking a branch, the people move like wild deer—upright and proper without knowing it as *righteousness*, loving one another without knowing it as *benevolence*. They act without leaving traces, perform deeds without leaving records. This is the age of the *Supreme Above*.

The next stage: they are cherished, they are praised. As supreme virtue declines and *benevolence* and *righteousness* become prominent, those who benefit from *benevolence* grow close and attach themselves, those who embrace *righteousness* praise and elevate them. Zhuangzi said: When the sage arrives, he bends and stretches to create *benevolence*, he stands on tiptoe to establish *righteousness*, and thus the world begins to doubt. Doubt gives rise to cherishing and praise.

Again he said: Shun had his natural conduct, and the people delighted in him, so he moved his capital three times to Chengdu. Yao, hearing of his virtue, raised him to high office and then abdicated in his favor—this is the stage of cherishing and praising.

The next stage: they are feared, they are scorned. When *benevolence* and *righteousness* fade and penal laws are established, when penal laws are strict, the people fear them. Though laws are strict, those who rely on cunning and deceit will transform the people, leading them to fraud and deception—this is when the people’s scorn of their ruler runs deepest.

*The Profound and Mysterious* says: In the age of the *Supreme Above*, virtue spreads naturally—this is when the people merely know of their sovereign above. The next stage is to prevent them from doing wrong—this is the stage of cherishing and praising. The next stage is to reward the virtuous and punish the violent—this is the stage of fear and scorn.

Trust is insufficient, so distrust arises. Sincerity is when the heart loves truly; faithfulness is when words can be relied upon. When trust is complete, the world is secure; when trust is lost, the world is in peril. Now that cunning and deceit have flourished and fraud is rampant, the ruler’s trust is lacking among the people, so distrust answers in kind.

The ruler’s influence over the people is like the reflection of a bright mirror—its form is clear, its logic unerring. Wang Bi said: When the body’s nature is lost, disease arises; when the essence of things is distorted, flaws and conflicts emerge. When trust is insufficient, distrust follows—this is the natural order.

Yet even this is better than reckless speech. From the stage of cherishing downward, the way of the *Supreme Above*’s effortless transformation is already lost, unable to restore the purity of antiquity. Even so, it still values speech and teaching, clinging to old methods as the means of transformation. Though far from the Dao, it is still better than reckless speech leading to distrust and rebellion.

When deeds are accomplished and affairs settled, the people say, *"This is natural."* The ruler of the Dao governs with passive ease, so achievements are completed without claim, his silence and stillness profound—thus affairs are settled and forgotten. The people are pure and unadorned, doing nothing in vain, saying, *"This is simply natural."* Where then do the hearts of cherishing, praising, fearing, and scorn arise?

The old saying: *"Trust is insufficient, so distrust arises"*—this explains *fearing* and *scorning*. *"Yet even this is better"*—this explains *cherishing* and *praising*. *"When deeds are accomplished..."*—this again echoes the stage where the people merely know of their sovereign above. To rigidly adhere to old interpretations is not followed here.

The *Supreme Above*’s effortless virtue is not manifest. When *benevolence* and cherishing arise, the *Great Dao* is abandoned, so it is ranked below. When the *Great Dao* is abandoned, *benevolence* and *righteousness* emerge. The *Great Dao* is the ancient way of effortless transformation. *"Abandoned"* means both hidden and decayed, no longer practiced. When the people’s hearts are not pure, the *Great Dao* is hidden and decayed; supreme virtue is not practiced.

Then the seven forms of artificiality gradually arise, and *righteousness* and *profit* grow excessive. Thus, the pure is shaped into vessels—this is when the *Great Dao* is abandoned, giving rise to the seven forms of artificiality.

Zhuangzi said: Fish forget one another in the rivers and lakes; people forget one another in the states of Dao and Wei—this illustrates the age of the *Great Dao*. When *comprehensive love* becomes *benevolence* and *judging wrong* becomes *righteousness*, then *benevolence* and *righteousness* arise from insufficiency. This is like fish stranded on dry land, splashing each other with muddy water, moistening one another with saliva—not as good as forgetting one another in the rivers and lakes. This explains how the *Great Dao*’s abandonment gives rise to the seven forms of artificiality.

Wisdom emerges, and great deceit follows. When purity is lost and the *Great Dao* is abandoned, wisdom arises, and with it, great deceit—this is the natural order. Zhuangzi said: The true nature of the horse is to graze, drink, and lift its legs as it walks. When happy, it nuzzles and rubs necks; when angry, it rears and kicks. This is all the horse’s wisdom. But when the master of horses tames it—with bit and bridle before, whip and spur behind, the yoke and reins to guide it, and the monthly inspections to refine it—the horse becomes skittish, resistant, fierce, and deceitful, and the cunning of stolen reins is born.

In the age of antiquity, the people lived without knowing what to do, walked without knowing where to go. They dwelled in contentment and joy, drumming their bellies as they wandered. The people could do no more than this. But when the sage arrived, he bent and shaped *rites* and *music* to regulate the world’s form, he stretched and adjusted *benevolence* and *righteousness* to soothe the world’s heart—and thus the people’s cunning and deceit grew, their sophistry and hair-splitting flourished. This is what is meant by *"wisdom emerges, and great deceit follows."*

The five relationships are disrupted, and *filial piety* and *affection* arise. The state falls into chaos, and loyal ministers emerge. The five relationships are father, son, elder and younger brothers, husband and wife. The *Rites* say: When the *Great Dao* is practiced, one does not love only one’s own kin, nor cherish only one’s own children—true *benevolence* forgets kinship. Those who cherish their kin treat nephews as their own children and serve uncles as their own fathers. When the five relationships are harmonious, where then does *filial piety* and *affection* become prominent? Thus, the people’s reverence for my kin is as it should be for all kin. Therefore, above and below live in harmony, and the bonds of kinship are forgotten.

But when the teachings of balance are lost and the young harbor superiority, they defy the natural order, so the five relationships are disrupted, and the traces of *filial piety* and affection appear.

「Loyal ministers,
　　The six kinships—father and son, elder and younger brothers, husband and wife—are thus unified. The *Rites* state: When the *Great Dao* is practiced, one does not favor only one’s own kin nor cherish only one’s own children; true *virtue* forgets kinship. Those who cherish their kin treat nephews as their own children and serve uncles as their own fathers. When the six kinships are harmonious, where then does *filial piety* and *affection* become manifest? Thus, all revere my kin as they should revere all kin. Therefore, above and below dwell in harmony, and the bonds of kinship are forgotten.

But when the young lack balance and harbor arrogance, they transgress the natural order, disrupting the six kinships, and the traces of *filial piety* and affection then appear.

Moreover, the *Sage* maintains balance, and thus the Four Seas become one family. Wandering in spirit to the *Maoshan* (Maoshan Mountains), one fades away and forgets all of one’s worldly concerns. Then, the ruler above does nothing, yet the people transform effortlessly—where then would there be ministers who pierce their eyes and split their hearts to serve?

Thus, the blind and the late-born, the obstinate, are praised as *Shun* is called *Great Filial Piety*, the wise yet austere of *Lu* is praised as *Shen* is called *Able to Nurture*, the upright *Jie* of *Xia* saw *Longfeng* rise, and the perverse *Zhou* saw *Bigan* shine—these are acts of necessity, not of joy.

When the *Dao* is abandoned, *virtue* and *righteousness* become prominent; when *wisdom* emerges, great deceit arises. To restore the ancient simplicity, one must extinguish the traces of *Sageliness* and discard cunning *wisdom*—thus comes the teaching of *Discarding Sageliness and Wisdom*.

Discarding Sageliness and Wisdom, the people’s benefit increases a hundredfold.
*Sageliness* refers to the institutions, laws, symbols, and functional relics of the *Sages*.
To discard it is to restore their original simplicity.
*River Upper Master* (Huangshang Gong) said: The Five Emperors’ painted symbols and *Cangjie*’s creation of writing are inferior to the Three Sovereigns’ simple knotted cords without script.

*Wisdom* refers to strategic scheming, calculation, and the manipulative arts of *halong* (纵横).
To discard it is to return to *non-action*.
The *Classics* say: To rule a state with *wisdom*, it is the state’s ruin.
If one does not display the functional relics of *Sageliness* nor employ the manipulative arts of *wisdom*, then craftiness and deceit will not arise, calamities and chaos will not occur, and the people will be like innocent children, devoted solely to agriculture—then their benefit will far exceed a hundredfold.

*Zhuangzi* said: “Abandon minor *wisdom*, and major *wisdom* will become clear.”
He also said: “If the *good man* is not found, the *Dao* of the *Sage* cannot stand.
If *Zhi* the robber is not thwarted, the *Dao* of the *Sage* cannot prevail.”
Thus, one must discard and abandon these things for the people to truly benefit.

Discarding *virtue* and *righteousness*, the people return to *filial piety* and *affection*.
*Virtue* is the love of things, so people grow attached to it.
*Righteousness* is the proper arrangement of things, so people praise it.
Yet the harm of *virtue* and *righteousness* lies in the attachment and praise they inspire—once attachment and praise are established, the hearts of the people become restless, and the harmony of life and nature is lost.

When the harmony of life and nature is lost, how then can *filial piety* and *affection* persist?
Now, if one discards and abandons them, it is to restore the wholeness of life and nature and revive *filial piety* and *affection*.

Discarding cleverness and material gain, thieves and robbers will cease to exist.
*Cleverness* refers to intricate carving, fine craftsmanship, and mechanical devices like locks and keys.
*Material gain* refers to precious gems, jade, and measuring tools—weights, scales, seals, and tokens.
Though these mechanical devices and tokens may serve to guard against minor threats, in the grand scheme, they cannot repel great calamities.
Today, to discard them is like casting aside jade, destroying pearls, burning seals, and breaking tokens—it is to make the people simple and unadorned, so that theft naturally stops.
These three teachings—*Discarding Sageliness and Wisdom*, *Discarding Virtue and Righteousness*, and *Discarding Cleverness and Material Gain*—are said to be insufficient as *culture* (文), so they are followed by *Associated Teachings*.
*Associated* means to follow or continue.
The three teachings refer to the aforementioned steps.
Though one may wish to abandon these three, to restore the ancient simplicity, yet as *culture* and *teachings* handed down, they remain unclear in principle—thus, many find them perplexing.

Separately, there are the *Associated Teachings* to follow, which will clarify the mind like ice—this is explained below.
*Seeing Simplicity and Embracing Purity* (见素抱朴), with *few private interests and little desire*.
*Seeing Simplicity* means preserving one’s natural purity, without mixing in artificial adornments—thus, the traces of *Sageliness* and *wisdom* naturally vanish.
*Embracing Purity* means returning to one’s original simplicity, without indulging in ostentation—thus, the sentiments of *virtue* and *righteousness* naturally fade.
*Few private interests* means adhering to one’s proper portion with utmost fairness, not coveting external beauty—thus, cleverness and artifices naturally cease.
*Little desire* means moderating one’s emotions and living frugally, calm and tranquil—thus, superficial material gain naturally disappears.

The traces of *Sageliness* and *wisdom* can rescue the near but fail to know the harm they cause to the far; the sentiments of *virtue* and *righteousness* can aid the urgent but fail to recognize their deviation from true nature; the tools of *cleverness* and *material gain* can assist the small but fail to see their danger to the great. Therefore, the *Sage* is bright yet does not display, wise yet does not act, holding only to *Seeing Simplicity and Embracing Purity* as their aspiration, and *few private interests and little desire* as their concern. Thus, ruling a state in this manner, the people attain wealth and longevity, returning to the ancient simplicity, and cultivating oneself in this way, one’s body withers and mind grows empty, fading away like a lost pair.

When the traces of *Sageliness* are discarded, cleverness and artifice naturally fade; when *virtue* and *righteousness* are discarded, *affection* and *filial piety* naturally flourish, and kinship grows harmonious. This arises from the harm caused by *scholarship*—thus, it is followed by the teaching of *Discarding Scholarship and Freedom from Worries*.

*Discarding Scholarship and Freedom from Worries*.
The *Dao* is vast and difficult to speak of—how can *scholarship* grasp and advance it? Thus, it can be transmitted but not bestowed, obtained but not fully possessed.
The case of *Lun Bian* (轮扁) was not one of inability to transmit, but rather of lacking a recipient of suitable quality.
How much more so with the *Dao* of the *Sage*!
Today’s *scholars* are but the dregs and refuse of knowledge.»

「The so-called *Discarding Scholarship* does not mean abandoning learning altogether, but rather preserving one’s innate nature without exceeding its bounds through study. Just as the *Wild Duck’s Way* (凫经) is brief, yet clinging to it brings worry, and the *Crane’s Way* (鹤经) is long, yet severing it brings sorrow. *Lun Bian* (轮扁) and *Shi Guang* (师旷) were born with natural brilliance, yet later scholars often distort the strengths and weaknesses of their innate nature—how could they ever emulate their humble yet proud virtue?

Abandoning such emulation, one finds neither worry nor joy; instead, one follows their natural *qi*, attains the Sage’s heart, and thus what is truly sought is not lacking, while what is vainly discarded is not needed. Those who labor in scholarship yet remain troubled bow their heads and pierce their thighs, seeking only empty fame, or study by candlelight, pursuing only fleeting gain—thus, they are ensnared by honor and disgrace, joy and sorrow. How lost they are!

*Yi* (唯) and *E* (阿) differ by how much? *Shan* (善) and *E* (恶) differ by how much?
*Yi* (唯) is reverent acceptance; *E* (阿) is complacent assent.
From the perspective of *social norms* (名教), *yi* is reverence while *e* is flattery.
In truth, *yi* and *e* both stem from the same voice—how distant their divergence!

If one forgets the world’s attachments, then the distinction between *yi* and *e* vanishes.
*Shan* (善) is the praise of *auspiciousness* (吉); *E* (恶) is the label of *inauspiciousness* (凶).
To study and practice it is *shan* (善); to neglect study and defy it is *e* (凶).
The *Dao* is boundless, profound, and tranquil—how could it be confined to learning or not learning?

Those who pursue *shan* (善) without attaining its essence find ruin in fame,
while those who flee *e* (恶) without avoiding its roots meet destruction in punishment.
Thus, *shan* and *e* are not the true *Dao*—they are external things.
Since both are external, how different can they be?
Only those who *Discard Scholarship* and *Free from Worries*, though they possess the Sage’s wisdom,
remain unaware of it—how much more so with *shan* and *e*, *yi* and *e*!

Some say: *"Transform conventional scholarship into true scholarship,
change *e* into *yi*, change *e* into *shan*—it is as easy as turning one’s hand!"*
The Sage’s words are of ultimate truth; these are the world’s teachings.
If one argues from this perspective, how does it differ from *yi* and *e*?

The ancients wrote: *"The distinction between *shan* (善) and *e* (恶) is as follows:
As in the previous chapter, all know what is beautiful as beautiful—thus, *e* already vanishes.
What people fear, they must fear.
The *Dao* is boundless—its depth is endless.
The Sage’s true heart and wondrous *Dao*,
*Discarding Scholarship* and *Free from Worries*,
though they forget *shan* and *e* within their breast,
must align with *yi* and *e* in outward form.
The warnings of *shan* and *e* must not be disregarded—
this is the depth of the Sage’s *Dao*!

The petty-minded are not so.
They admire *shan* yet fail to practice it,
fear *e* yet do not abandon it.
They drown in worldly scholarship,
going forth without return,
wasting their true nature,
never once halting in their folly.
*Cent* (央) means *center* (中); *Zhi* (止) means *halt*.

The crowd moves with joy,
as if feasting on the grandest sacrificial meat,
or ascending the Spring Platform in springtime.
*Cent* (熙熙) is the appearance of delight;
the *Spring Platform* (春台) is the splendor of the season.
This is the way of the common folk.

People, through scholarship, adopt falsehoods,
chase fleeting appearances, and lose their true nature—
drowned in the waves of love and desire,
they revel in joy,
like a starving man before a grand feast,
his appetite unfulfilled yet rushing along the path of honor,
watching eagerly,
like a wandering son ascending the Spring Platform,
his heart lost and never returning.

I alone remain still—
my state is not yet apparent,
like an infant before it smiles,
calm and undirected,
as if having nowhere to go.

*Cent* (怕) means *tranquil*—also, serene and effortless.
*Cent* (兆) is the initial appearance of form;
*Cent* (孩) is the look of laughter.
*Cent* (乘乘) is the movement of *qi*.
The Sage’s heart is tranquil and serene,
effortless and void,
leaving no trace of form or shape—
though amidst the clamor of the world,
watching the transformations of things,
they gaze blankly,
like an infant unable to distinguish laughter or sorrow.

Then, they drift along with the world,
mixing in its currents,
riding the crowd’s tide,
moving without sharp contrast or vast distinction—
as if bound for nowhere.

*Cent* (乘乘) is also like a hollow boat drifting east and west,
with no fixed destination.

*Cent* (怕) was originally written as *Cent* (魄).
Wang Bi (王弼) rendered it *Cent* (廓).
*Cent* (乘乘) was originally written as *Cent* (儡儡) by Wang Bi,
or *Cent* (魁魁) in another version.

The crowd all have excess,
while I alone seem abandoned—
this is the heart of the foolish man,
undifferentiated and simple.

When people’s hearts are bound to things,
they cling to appearances as if returning home—
gluttonous in the pursuit of wealth and honor,
they claim their hearts overflow with joy.

Thus, the Sage abandons worldly affairs,
unbinds the *Way of the Scholar* (绅修),
knowing that honor and disgrace come and go,
like a guest departing and a host forgotten—
this is the heart of the Sage,
undifferentiated and vast,
as if all things are one.
The foolish man’s heart is indeed simple and pure—
though they say, *"Is this not the heart of the foolish man?"*
In truth, the Sage’s heart has no distinctions,
and thus the Sage’s heart is perilously like this.

The crowd is bright and radiant,
while I alone seem dim.
*Cent* (昭昭) is the appearance of brilliance,
shining with talent and skill—
thus, the Sage’s wisdom encompasses all things,
yet they never boast,
as if in darkness.

The crowd is keen and discerning,
while I alone am dull and broad-minded.
*Cent* (忽兮) is like the sea—
floating, as if bound for nowhere.

*Cent* (察察) means strict and rigid—
also, harsh and constrained,
or proud and self-important.
*Cent* (闷闷) means expansive and yielding.
Some render it *Cent* (惛惛)—
the appearance of confusion and obscurity.

The world, through scholarship and governance,
establishes strict laws and harsh decrees,
proudly clinging to artificial *ways*—
thus, the people barely survive.
The Sage follows the *Way of Nature* (天) and aligns with the *Dao*,
conforming to the world’s flow,
in yielding and embracing all things—
thus, the people preserve their true nature,
living in broad-mindedness and simplicity.»

Zhuangzi said:

At the utmost extreme of the Dao,
dim and silent, yet though dim and silent it does not divide,
obscure and unfathomable,
yet all things return to it—
none know where they go,
the myriad folk employ it—
none know where it is exhausted.
It is skilled in descending and broadly accepting,
its depths unfathomable—
thus it is said, like the sea.

And yet, the Dao of responding to change
has no fixed method—
like flowing waves drifting and rising,
never settling in place.
Some render it: *Cent* (忽兮若晦寂), as if bound for nowhere,
speaking of the Sage’s bearing suddenly obscured,
his mind dwelling in stillness,
serene and unshaken—
this is the ninefold transformation of the waves of Huqiu Zilin.

Both interpretations are valid,
but I follow the first.

The crowd all have *ways* (有以),
while I alone am dull and broad-minded.
I alone differ from others,
yet value *food of the Mother* (食母).

*With* (以), means *employ* (用).
The common folk revere learning,
unable to *act without purpose* (无为),
yet they must employ some *way*—
thus it is said, they have *ways*.

The Sage moves as if dragging a withered tree,
dwells as if gathering dead ashes,
not adorning his form externally—
thus, he alone appears dull and broad-minded.

The Sage’s coming and going,
his speech and silence,
are not purposely different from others,
yet naturally they differ—
why? Because he values employing the Dao.

Those who employ the Dao
are in harmony with the *transforming of things* (造化),
thus it is said: I alone differ from others,
yet value *food of the Mother*.

*Food* (食), means *employ* (用).
*Mother* (母), is the Dao,
the origin.
Some say *food* (食) means *nourish* (养),
*Mother* (母) means *spirit* (神).
The spirit can give birth to the body—
thus it is called *Mother*.

The common folk value desires
and thereby lose their true form,
while the Sage values *non-desire*
and thereby nourishes his spirit—
thus he differs from others.

Others say:
*Mother* (母) is *qi* (气).
The common folk indulge in flavors,
while the Sage values *food of harmonious qi* (食和气)—
thus he differs from others.

Some say, "The Master Lao values blending light with dust to avoid conflict,
why does this passage alone speak of *me and you* (彼我)?"
I say, "This is surely not the Sage’s original intent—
rather, it is spoken out of necessity."

The Sage’s actions,
what is ever truly different?
It is merely that the common folk’s movements and stillness are contrary to the world’s flow,
so he speaks in response and establishes teachings—
thus there is *me and you*.

Worries of *transgressing the Dao* (失礼) arise from learning,
so he follows with the *dimness of the Sage’s bearing* (沌沌若昏).
The *virtue/power* (德) of the Sage is vast and luminous—
thus he follows it with the *bearing of great virtue* (孔德之容).

The bearing of great virtue
follows only the Dao.

*Kong* (孔), means *great* (甚) and *vast* (大).
*Bearing* (容), means *form* (状).
*Follows* (从), means *conform* (顺).

The Sage is one who is in harmony with the Dao.

The Dao has no name,
yet *virtue/power* (德) reveals it.
Great virtue has no origin,
it is formed by conforming to the Dao.
Thus, the Sage of great virtue,
amidst all appearances,
what is ever truly seen?
Only the bearing of conforming to the Dao—
shorn and plain, such is his form.

The Dao, as a thing,
is only *dim and vague* (倪唯惚).
The Dao is remote and difficult to speak of,
so even the keenest ears cannot perceive it—
what thing can be called *seen*?

Now, when speaking of *things*,
it is merely to borrow strong names
to probe the subtle truths.

The Sage of great virtue,
able to conform and follow the Dao,
the Dao having no form—
how can he follow it?
Since its form is nonexistent,
and yet it cannot be named—
how then can it be followed?

Only by probing its *dim and vague* (怳惚) nature,
can one resonate with its influence—
its image is formless yet audible.

*Dim* (怳) seems like *having*—
yet *having* is not *having*.
*Vague* (惚) seems like *not having*—
yet *not having* is not *not having*.
*Not having* that is not *not having*—
this is *emptiness as form*.
*Having* that is not *having*—
this is *form as emptiness*.
*Having* and *not having* are unfathomable,
yet we borrow images of *things*
to elucidate the Dao.

*Vague* (惚) and *dim* (怳),
within them lies *image*—
*dim* (怳) and *vague* (惚),
within them lies *thing*.
*Image* (象), is *qi manifestation* (气象).
*Thing* (物), is *spirit-thing* (神物)—
that which Zhuangzi calls *True Lord* (真君),
and which we now call *nature* (性).

The Dao,
dim and vague, undetermined—
if we say it has no *transgression*,
then *vague* (惚) naturally emerges from the formless,
delighting as it transforms *qi manifestations*—
becoming the portents of all things.

If we say it has *transgression*—
then *dim* (怳) arises from the initial *image*,
and *vague* (惚) dissolves back into *non-being*—
yet within the utmost *non-being*,
there exists *spirit-thing*.

*Spirit-thing* (神物),
the unfathomable interplay of *yin* and *yang*—
the subtle essence that speaks of all things.

Through myriad transformations and changes,
never exhausted—
governing heaven and earth,
creating *yin* and *yang*—
establishing *qi* and forming essence,
becoming all ten thousand kinds—
nurturing the body, nurturing the state,
refining the coarse into the subtle—
none escape the *spirit-thing*.

Profound and obscure,
within it lies *essence*—
its essence is most true,
within it lies *faithfulness*—
profound, in its depth and distance—
obscure, in its stillness and quietude.

The Dao,
dim and vague, cannot be determined—
*images* of *things* cannot be seen—
yet profound and obscure,
askers know not its substance,
responders comprehend not its truth—
within it, however, dwells pure *essence*,
and it holds the *faithfulness of Nature*.

Its transformations are not false—
thus it is called *true*.
Its changes respond to the times—
thus it is called *faithful*.
Like the crow’s foot becoming the *dish* (跻螬),
human blood becoming *wildfire* (野火),
rotting melons birthing fish,
virtuous women turning to stone—
though the movements of growth and decay vary in ten thousand forms,
none escape the *essence* sensing and transforming,
the *faithfulness* reaching its peak and not failing to change.

Who but the Sage of great virtue
could ever comprehend this?

From ancient times to the present,
its name does not fade—
employing it to measure the myriad folk.

How do I know the myriad folk are thus?
By this.

*Measure* (阅), means *assess* (度) and *unfold* (披).
*Folk* (甫), means *origin* (本始).

The Dao,
from the ancient past to the present,
serene and ever-present without form—
though unseen, its name remains.
To liken the Sage who attains the Dao for many years,
thus able to assess all *things*’ origins,
knowing they all begin from the Dao—
thus he unfolds it to complete their forms and essences.

Again, when asked how I know
all things derive their *endowment* (资禀) from the Dao,
and that birth and death, beginning and end,
are as they are—

I answer:
The Dao’s dim and vague, profound and obscure,
ever-present without fading—
thus it can respond to change and govern,
in stillness and *non-action*—
assessing the myriad folk’s transformations,
none escape deriving their *endowment* from the Dao—
by this, I know.

The Sage of Great Virtue,
conforms to the Dao—
conforming to the Dao preserves wholeness,
thus it follows: *What is bent becomes whole.*

The *Dao De Jing*’s *Hidden Chamber*:
*Volume Three of the Collected Subtle Chapters* concludes.
*Volume Four of the Collected Subtle Chapters* begins.
Compiled by **Bìxū Zǐ** (碧虚子) **Chén Jǐngyuán** (陈景元).

Then it becomes whole;
what is twisted becomes straight,
what is hollow becomes full,
what is worn becomes renewed,
what is few becomes simple,
what is many becomes confused.

The wise and virtuous scholar,
broadly versed in past and present,
probing the depths and reaching afar,
unimpeded in his singular vision—
though his talents may coil and bend,
they never flaunt themselves—
for he seeks to avoid harm and preserve his body.

Sharp in hearing, keen in perception,
his deeds and achievements manifest,
his heart straight as an arrow,
his resolve taut as a bowstring—
yet he bends himself, humbles himself,
never extending himself—
this is the man of true straightness.

Again, the Sage does not oppose things.
When things come and bend him,
he submits and receives them.
If they reflect inward and know their fault,
then straightness returns of its own accord—
thus it is said: *What is bent becomes whole.*

The rise and fall of hills and valleys,
high and low in constant flux—
valleys and gullies, low and hollow,
draw water to fill them;
peaks and ridges, high and steep,
are eroded by rain and crumble.
When a man is humble and lowly,
the multitude reveres and follows him,
bringing about his radiance and greatness—
thus it is said: *What is hollow becomes full.*

A man of talent, if he fragments his virtue
and wears himself thin,
will be joyfully promoted by the multitude,
his Way ever renewed—
thus it is said: *What is worn becomes renewed.*

Fewness means simplicity.
The *Yì* says:
*"Simple and easy, yet all under heaven’s patterns are achieved."*

The *Xīshēng Jīng* says:
*"Hold to One, and all things are complete."*

Many means extensive learning.
Zhuangzi says:
*"When ornament destroys substance, learning drowns the mind."*

The *Lièzǐ* says:
*"Many paths lead to losing the sheep;
many studies lead to losing the Way."*

Thus the Sage embraces One,
setting the standard for all under heaven.
The *Classic* says:
*"The Dao generates One."*

One is the Dao’s child—
the *Tàijí* (太极),
also the *Húnyuán* (混元),
the pure and unified *qi* of *Tàihé* (太和).

Again, it is *wuwei* (無為).
The Sage embraces and guards
the pure and unified Dao of *Húnyuán*,
restoring the ancient *wuwei* custom,
to serve as the standard for all under heaven.

How is it that One is *wuwei*?
The *Classic* says:
*"Heaven, obtaining One, is clear;
Earth, obtaining One, is tranquil."*

Zhuangzi says:
*"Heaven, through *wuwei*, is clear;
Earth, through *wuwei*, is tranquil."*

Thus it is clear.

From *What is bent becomes whole* downward,
the six matters still bear traces of counteraction—
but *Embrace One* and *wuwei* encompass them all,
thus becoming the standard for all under heaven.

Not self-displaying, hence clear.
Not self-righteous, hence manifest.
Not self-praising, hence effective.
Not self-aggrandizing, hence enduring.

These four matters are all marks of *wuwei*.
The Sage, practicing *wuwei*,
never openly shows his talents—
yet all under heaven naturally acknowledge his clarity.

River-Upper Master says:
*"Though the Sage is clear,
he does not see a thousand *li* ahead—
he uses the eyes of all under heaven to see,
thus his clarity is thorough."*

He who uses the eyes of all under heaven
also does not reveal his own intentions.
Though the words differ, their meaning is similar—
the Sage, empty and tranquil,
never asserts himself while denying others.
Self and other forgotten,
all under heaven naturally acknowledge his correctness,
and his virtue becomes manifest.

The Sage, serene and undisturbed,
never boasts of his merits—
yet all under heaven naturally acknowledge his achievements.

The Sage, still and silent,
never boasts of his worth—
yet all under heaven naturally acknowledge his virtue
and his enduring presence.

Only he who does not contend
cannot be contended with by all under heaven.

The *Honglie Jie* says:
*"When Duke Jian of Zhao died and was not yet buried,
Zhongmou surrendered to Qi.
After five days of burial,
Duke Xiang raised an army to attack it.
Before the siege was complete, a thousand *zhang* of the city wall collapsed.
Duke Xiang struck the bell and withdrew.
His officers advised:
‘Your Highness punishes Zhongmou’s crime,
yet the city wall collapses—
this is Heaven’s aid. Why withdraw?’
Duke Xiang said:
‘I was taught by Master Shùxiàng:
*A gentleman does not exploit another’s advantage,
nor force him into peril.
Let him fortify his city,
then attack when it is complete.’
Zhongmou, hearing this, begged to surrender.
Thus it is said:
*Only he who does not contend
cannot be contended with by all under heaven.*"

The ancient saying of *What is bent becomes whole*—
is this mere empty speech?
Truly whole, and returned to its source.

The Sage, pure and unified,
practicing *wuwei*,
how could he harbor contentious intentions?
The *Classic* says:
*"His virtue is as thick as that of an infant—
poisonous insects do not sting him,
ferocious beasts do not clutch him,
swooping crows do not peck him.
Even beasts behave thus—
how much more so for humans!"*

Yet in ancient times, there were these words of *bending to wholeness*—
are they not today’s parables?
If a man practices them,
truly attaining the perfection of virtue,
and returning it to himself—
this is the profound intent urged again and again.

Bending to wholeness, embracing One,
not boasting, not praising—
not boasting nor praising leads to few words naturally.

Few words naturally,
like gusts of wind that do not last till morning,
or sudden rains that do not last till evening.
The *Yì* says:
*"The words of the virtuous are few;
the words of the hasty are many.
Value their rarity and guard against their excess."*

Few and sparse words align with nature.
The Sage responds when questioned,
speaks when engaging with others,
moves and rests according to the time—
thus aligning with nature.

To explain winds and rains that come and go as they should
is beneficial to all things.
Violent and sudden, they do not persist—
*piāo* (飘) means fierce,
*zòu* (骤) means abrupt.

From dawn to midday is *zhōngzhāo* (终朝).
From early to late is *zhōngrì* (终日).

When mountains and marshes connect,
they produce *piāo* winds.
When *yin* and *yang* surge violently,
they produce *zòu* rains—
this arises from *yin* and *yang* losing their proper order,
the harmonious *qi* not blending—
thus they cannot endure long.

「To liken this to humanity—
when words and deeds clash,
joy and anger are unchecked,
how could purity and harmony not be lost?

Who causes this?
The heavens and the earth.

The heavens and the earth cannot endure long,
how much less can humanity?

If one asks who makes the *piāo* winds and *zòu* rains,
the answer is: it is the heavens and the earth.

The grandest forms are none greater than the heavens and the earth,
the broadest *qi* none more vast than *yin* and *yang*.

When *yin* and *yang* collide,
when the heavens and earth shift violently,
they produce fierce winds and sudden rains—
yet these cannot last even half a day,
how much less can humanity dwell between the heavens and earth,
like a single hair upon a horse’s body?

How dare one indulge desires and surrender to joy and anger,
reckless and abrupt without restraint,
rushing toward swift ruin?

This is not the Dao.

Those who follow the Dao align with the Dao;
those who embody virtue align with virtue;
those who stray align with loss.

*From* (从) means to act in accordance,
to follow naturally.

The Dao is the natural, boundless,
tranquil, simple, and effortless Way.

When humans act, they should align with the Dao,
restrain their words and desires,
and preserve the harmony of heaven—
how could they be like fierce winds and sudden rains,
only to vanish soon?

Yet those who follow the Dao:
in motion, they ride the waves of *yang*;
in stillness, they rest in the virtue of *yin*,
gathering to form substance,
scattering to become *qi*—
emerging without return,
they walk the Way of subtlety.

Those who embody virtue:
within, they fulfill all their duties,
never losing their spirit,
without;
they benefit all things,
extending kindness even to weeds and grasses,
completing deeds without claiming credit,
and thus align with the highest virtue.

Those who stray:
take pleasure in gluttony and greed,
consider bonds and servitude as honor,
toil like beasts without remorse,
and gladly court ruin—
they align with loss.

Those who align with the Dao,
the Dao will find them.
Those who align with virtue,
virtue will find them.
Those who align with loss,
loss will find them.

*"Faith is insufficient—
there is also unfaith."*

This speaks of how *qi* of like nature responds to one another.

Those who embody the Dao in their being—
not only do they bring joy to the people,
but the sovereign of the Great Dao also finds his match.

Those whose deeds align with the highest virtue—
not only do the people revere them,
but the sages of supreme virtue also find their match.

Those whose hearts are lost in ruin—
not only do they rejoice in their decaying bodies,
but the ranks of the lost also find their match.

Each responds in kind.

Thus, those who trust in the Dao
find their Dao.
Those who trust in virtue
find their virtue.
If one does not trust in the Dao,
or scorns virtue,
then the Dao will not respond,
and virtue will be unattained.

Who in the world truly trusts in this?

Therefore it is said:
*"Faith is insufficient—
there is also unfaith."*

Few words and sparse speech align with nature and the Dao,
virtue and the Way blend harmoniously without arrogance or boasting—
thus, those who follow are not established.

The boastful do not stand,
the presumptuous do not walk.

Boastful—
they rise on their toes to gaze,
then press forward in vain.
Presumptuous—
they grasp at things,
or leap over others in contempt.

The gluttonous and aggressive,
who lift their gaze beyond measure,
seeking favor and glory—
though they may briefly attain it,
it is like stretching their necks and rising on their toes—
how could they stand long?

Yet they lack true talent and ability,
yet they dare to surpass others—
the crowd blocks their path,
so they cannot speak.
Their strides are forced, grasping at things,
their hearts longing for swift success—
how could they ever walk?

The self-praised are not enlightened,
the self-righteous do not shine,
the self-glorified have no merit,
the self-proud do not endure.

*"The crooked becomes whole—
Chapter Twenty-Two—*
the Sage acts without doing,
does not boast or glory,
yet never fails to be manifest.

This chapter speaks of the petty man—
he is not so.

He flaunts his own talents,
obscuring others—
how could his deeds be clear?

He is right in his own eyes,
yet wrongs others—
he praises himself,
yet blames others—
how could his principles be revealed?

His benevolence does not extend to all,
his righteousness does not judge wrongs—
he takes credit for himself,
seeking glory—
how could his governance be effective?

He boasts of his great abilities,
oppressing the weak and foolish—
how could he walk the Dao long?

Of the Dao it is said:
*"Excessive food and superfluous actions—
men may detest them,
yet the Dao does not dwell there."*

These are like blemishes and deformities upon the body.

The actions of self-glorying and the like—
to the Dao of natural effortlessness,
they are like discarded food,
fit only to offend,
or like deformities,
fit only to disgrace.

All things detest them,
how much more would the Dao’s worthy
ever place themselves there?

Boasting, presumption, and superfluous actions—
the Dao does not dwell there,
their traces blend into obscurity—
thus, it follows with *"things blend into obscurity."*

Things blend into obscurity,
existing before the heavens and earth.

Those who blend into obscurity—
they are the origin of the Dao.

Thus, they cannot be seen,
cannot be heard,
cannot be grasped.

The highest principle is profound and ever-present,
thus called *"things blend into obscurity."*

The true Dao flows in myriad paths yet is undivided,
thus called *"obscurity without end."*

Yet obscurity without end cannot be known,
yet all things arise from it—
thus it is said: *"things blend into obscurity."*

Existing before the heavens and earth—
this is the source of the Dao.

The *Classic* says:
*"I do not know whose child is this,
who shaped the Emperor before his birth."*

Zhuangzi says:
*"The Dao precedes the Great Pole,
yet is not high.
It lies beneath the Six Poles,
yet is not deep.
It exists before the heavens and earth,
yet is not long-lived.
It endures through the ancient past,
yet is not old—
these mark the Dao’s grand essence.

Silent and boundless,
it stands alone yet never changes,
circulates endlessly yet never falters—
it may be called the Mother of the world.

Silent—
no sound.
Boundless—
no form.

Though it is said *"things blend into obscurity,"*
seeking its form and voice,
it is like an open window into true emptiness—
no image, no substance—
thus it is called *"silent and boundless."*

The Great Mass stands solitary,
no thing to compare with.
Even form and shadow depend on something else,
yet it is said to transform alone—
how much more the subtle Dao,
vast and clear—
what thing could pair with it?

Thus it stands alone.»

The myriad things though ever-changing, born and dying,
yet the subtle Dao never shifts or alters—
thus it is said, *"never changes."*

Moreover, the Dao’s workings:
when dispersed, the harmonizing *qi* is confined within the Great Void,
when gathered, the pure essence is stored like grains in a granary.
Circulating through the Six Empties,
its applications are boundless—
thus it is said, *"never falters."*

No thing, great or small,
does not rely upon the Dao.
To obtain it is to be whole,
to depart from it is to perish.
It gives birth and completes all things—
all depend upon it—
thus it is called *"the Mother of the world."*

I know not its name,
so I call it *Dao*.
Forced to name it, I say *Great*.

The Great Dao is formless,
so no ear can hear it,
no hand can grasp it.
Since it lacks form, sound, or trace,
its name is unknown.

Yet earlier it was said, *"things blend into obscurity,"*
so it has *body* and *use*.
Once body and use are revealed,
it gives rise to all things.
Examining its use reveals its *virtue*,
so it is named *Dao*.
It encompasses heaven and earth—
its substance is supremely vast—
thus, forced to name it, I say *Great*.

Great is called *Passing*,
Passing is called *Distant*,
Distant is called *Returning*.
Passing—this is *going*.
All great things have boundaries,
yet the Dao is boundless.

Without limit it goes,
without shore it extends—
thus Great is called *Passing*.
The farther it passes, the more distant it grows,
its source cannot be traced—
thus Passing is called *Distant*.
Though distant beyond the Eight Wastes,
it returns to stillness within the inch of the heart,
like a mirror’s clarity—
responding without storing—
thus Distant is called *Returning*.
Returning—this is *restoration*.
To go and return,
to perish and revive,
from yin to yang—
all are the Dao’s transformations.

Thus the Dao is Great,
heaven is Great,
earth is Great,
and the Sage-King is also Great.
Within the *domain*, there are Four Greats,
and the Sage-King occupies one.

The Dao is the origin of heaven and earth,
vast and boundless, encompassing all.
All things obtain it and live;
the people cherish it and honor it—
thus the Dao is Great.

Heaven is inverted above,
moving without rest,
covering all things endlessly—
thus heaven is Great.

Earth is congealed below,
still and unmoving,
yielding and tranquil,
thickly bearing all things endlessly—
thus earth is Great.

The Sage-King is serene and does nothing,
his transformations reach all things,
the leader of the black-haired masses—
he does not dare compare himself to heaven, earth, or the Dao—
thus he is also Great.

The Four Greats within the *domain* are:
the Dao, heaven, earth, and the Sage-King.
*Domain*—this is *limit*.

The Dao encompasses the cosmos,
penetrates the finest hair,
sometimes transcends form,
sometimes dwells within limits.
From earth upward, all belong to heaven—
not the lofty, distant blue.

Heaven is beyond earth,
earth is within heaven.
The Sage-King, honored among humanity,
dwells between the Nine Regions—
all within the *domain*.

Thus the Four Greats within the *domain*.
The Sage-King follows the Dao of heaven and earth,
holds the authority over all things,
and among the Four Greats,
he shares in one.

Zhuangzi said:
*"None are more divine than heaven,
none are more abundant than earth,
none are greater than the Emperor-King.
The Emperor-King’s virtue aligns with heaven and earth—
how could he be careless?"*

Humanity follows earth,
earth follows heaven,
heaven follows the Dao,
the Dao follows *naturalness*.

This admonishes the Sage-King:
to model the Two Poles,
take the Dao as his standard,
and the world will naturally be governed.

The Sage-King, guarding *yin*-like stillness,
bears all without partiality—
this follows earth.
Yet he must not cling to earth’s immutability.
When he moves with *yang*-like vigor,
his rule is impartial—
this follows heaven.
Yet he must not fixate on heaven’s unchanging course.
Instead, he follows *wuwei*,
aligning with the Dao’s substance,
letting all things return to their nature—
this is the Sage-King following heaven and earth as the Dao.

It is not that heaven, earth, and the Dao model each other,
but one should discern the profound intent of the Sage’s teachings—
not merely engaging in empty words.

The *mixed-and-formed* Dao—
this is called *strong naming*.
Strongly naming the Four Greats,
the Sage-King occupies one.
The Sage-King, with heavy things governing light,
thus places the heavy as the root of the light.

Heavy is the root of light,
stillness is the lord of agitation.

Grasses and trees—
their petals and leaves are light and fragile,
perched on branches—
they wither under wind and frost.
But their roots are firm and heavy,
deep below—
nothing can harm them, and they endure.

Likewise, governing the body and the state,
one must take substance and weight as the foundation.

Dragons and serpents,
coiled and submerged in stillness,
can transform and ascend.
Tigers and leopards,
menacing and restless,
are felled by arrows and die young.
Thus, for governing the body,
a tranquil heart brings harmony to all spirits—
no cravings or agitation will harm it.
For governing the state,
a ruler who does nothing brings the people joy and ease—
no scheming ministers will cause chaos.

Thus the noble person walks all day
without leaving his *zhi* and *zhòng*.
*Zhi*—a screen-car, also a heavy wagon.
*Zhòng*—this is *weight* in his conduct.

The perfect person and noble never speak or act lightly.
Whatever they do, they carry their *zhi* and *zhòng*.
Their words must weigh upon matters.
If their words and deeds are thus,
how much more the Dao—
would they dare for an instant depart from it?

Some interpret *zhi* as *stillness*,
also warning of stillness and weight.

Moreover, those who travel far
never abandon their *zhi* and heavy loads—
for their clothing and food depend upon them.
If they depart and discard them,
they risk exhaustion upon the road.

Likewise, the noble person,
if he abandons the Dao’s weight and stillness
to act lightly and agitated—
what greater calamity could there be?

Though adorned with splendor,
he remains serene and detached.
*Splendor*—the appearance of bustling adornment.
*Serene*—this is *ease*.
The perfect person and noble,
ever fearful in their hearts,
do not take ornate splendor as beauty.
They do not indulge in ease and comfort,
but remain detached and distant,
abandoning arrogance and excess—
this too is the essence of guarding weight and stillness.

Some texts read *honor-hall* or *feast-assembly*,
meaning they do not delight in halls of splendor,
but find ease in modest dwellings,
and remain detached and distant.

Alas, how could the ruler of a great realm—
the sovereign of ten thousand chariots—
lightly cast his own weight upon the world?
Lightness leads to losing one’s foundation,
agitation leads to losing one’s sovereignty.

*"Alas"*—this is the language of lament.
For the sovereign of ten thousand chariots,
holding the grandest treasure of rule,
how could he not guard weight and stillness,
but lightly abandon his body to reckless desires?

If a subject fails to be steadfast and weighty,
he loses his own foundation
and forfeits his proper duties.

The ancient text reads:
*"Lightness leads to losing one’s foundation,"*
and if the ruler does not uphold the Way of non-action and serene stillness,
but stirs and disturbs the people,
then he loses his sovereign position
and forfeits the harmony of Heaven.

The old saying goes:
*"If the ruler acts lightly and carelessly, troubling the people,*
*then the people scatter—who would remain as his subjects?"*

If subjects disguise themselves with deceit to seek wealth,
act agitated to gain power and influence,
they invite exile and ruin,
and cannot serve their ruler.

Both meanings are valid.

The method of guarding weight and stillness
is only practiced well by the noble person,
so it follows with *"the noble person’s actions leave no trace."*

*"Noble actions"*—no tracks or edges.
*"Noble speech"*—no flaws or censure.
*"Noble calculation"*—no need for schemes or strategies.
*"Noble closure"*—no doors or bolts yet cannot be opened.
*"Noble binding"*—no ropes or knots yet cannot be undone.
*"Noble actions"*—this means acting in accordance with nature.

The *Yin-Fu Jing* says:
*"To observe the Dao of Heaven, one must follow Heaven’s actions,"*
meaning to observe the natural Way,
which is the original observation.
To follow nature’s actions,
one must hold nothing in hand.
If one holds nothing in observation or action,
this is obtained from the heart,
so even without stepping outside the door,
there are no tracks or disturbances.

*"Noble speech"* is like Zhuangzi’s cup-speech—
words drawn from the center,
ever-renewing variations,
in harmony with nature,
without exceeding the proper boundaries.
Thus, there are no flaws or censures.

*"Noble calculation"* means
to guard the One and do nothing,
to follow the natural course of all things,
allowing their long and short,
broad and narrow,
great and small,
many and few
to each fulfill their proper measure,
without harming their natural forms and capacities.

Zhuangzi said:
*"The One and speech become two,
two and the One become three—*
*from this point onward,*
*even clever schemers cannot grasp it,*
*how much less the ordinary?"*

This is why the noble person
rejects schemes and strategies.
The *Yin-Fu Jing* says:
*"The eight trigrams, the Heavenly Stems, the Earthly Branches—
divine schemes and occult concealments—
the interplay of yin and yang in victory and defeat,*
*clearly advance into the realm of symbols.*
*All this belongs to the study of contrived actions and clever stratagems."*

The perfect person wanders in the initial realm of things,
allows all things to govern themselves without being enslaved by them,
and calculates only his own body—
thus knowing the other.
Hence, he has no need for schemes or strategies.

*"Noble closure"* means the heart’s non-action.
The one whose heart does not act,
though sounds and colors may be before him,
all such phenomena do not enter his ears or eyes—
this is why no doors or bolts are needed,
yet nothing can open it.

*"Horizontal"* is called *guān*,
*"vertical"* is called *zhàng*.

*"Noble binding"* means
to bind affairs with the Dao.
The perfect person is simple and effortless,
skilled at restraining greed and excess with the Dao,
naturally binding emotions and desires,
while maintaining serene stillness without strain.
Thus, he has no need for explanation.

Therefore, the sage is always good at saving people,
so he does not abandon people,
and always good at saving things,
so he does not abandon things—
this is called *"clinging to clarity."*

*"Clinging"* means *secretly applying*.
The sage refers to those who practice the Five Noble Virtues.

The sage harmonizes with nature,
his heart merges with the utmost One,
so he can treat all things—
even the humble and lowly—
as if they were sacred offerings,
and assign the wise and foolish to their proper roles,
allowing people’s nature to remain whole
and their forms complete,
each fulfilling their proper function—
thus, he does not abandon people.

Furthermore, he follows their growth and decline,
respects their capacities and endowments,
ensuring that square and round,
straight and crooked
do not harm Heaven’s principles.
Even to the lowliest tiles and boards,
everyone has their place—
thus, he does not abandon things.

*"Always good"* means
to nurture the constant Dao
while clearly discerning and following the natural course of things.

The *Hong Lie Jie* says:
*"In the past, when Gongsun Long was in Zhao,*
*he told his disciples:*
*'If a man has no ability,*
*I cannot consort with him.'*
*A traveler in coarse clothing and simple belt came to see him,*
*and said:*
*'I can shout.'*
*Gongsun Long turned to his disciples and said:*
*'Among your ranks, is there one who can shout?*
*They replied:*
*'No.'*
*Gongsun Long said:*
*'Enroll him as a disciple.'*
*After several days,*
*the man went to speak with the king,*
*and when he reached the riverbank,*
*he was crossing in a boat,*
*and the traveler shouted once,*
*and the boat came to him.*
*Thus, the sage’s way in the world*
*does not oppose those with extraordinary abilities,*
*so it is said:*
*'He does not abandon people.'*
*Therefore, the good person is the teacher of the ungood,*
*and the ungood person is the resource of the good.*
*The good person refers to those with the Dao.*

*The Classic says:*
*'Establish the Son of Heaven,*
*set the Three Exalted Ministers—*
*this is to teach the ungood.'*
*Thus, it is said:*
*'The good person is the teacher of the ungood.'*
*Even if there are ungood people,*
*the good person also uses and employs them,*
*gradually transforming and guiding them.*

*The Classic says:*
*'The good, I make them good.*
*The ungood, I also make them good,*
*and thus they become good.*
*The faithful, I believe them.*
*The unfaithful, I also believe them,*
*and thus they become faithful.'*
*This is to transform and subdue the ungood through virtue and power,*
*to use them as resources and tools.*

*The Hong Lie Jie says:*
*'The Chu general Zi Fa*
*loved to seek out those with martial skills.*
*There was a man in Chu skilled at theft,*
*who came to see him and said:*
*'I have heard that you seek those with martial skills.*
*I am a thief,*
*and I wish to use my skill to spare one soldier for you.'*
*Zi Fa, upon hearing this,*
*did not bother to adjust his clothes or straighten his cap,*
*but rushed out to greet and honor him.*
*His attendants remonstrated:*
*'A thief is the greatest bandit in the world—*
*why honor him?*
*The general replied:*
*'This is not something you can understand.'*
*Soon after,*
*Ami’s army rose,*
*attacking Chu,*
*and Zi Fa led his troops to meet them.*
*The enemy forces repelled his three times.*
*The worthy and virtuous ministers of Chu*
*all exhausted their schemes and sincerity,*
*yet the Ami army grew stronger.*
*Then the thief came forward and said:*
*'I have a small skill.*
*I wish to use it for you.'*
*Zi Fa replied:*
*'Agreed.'*
*He did not question his words*
*but sent him away."*

The thief then secretly untied the general of Qi’s tent at night and presented it to him. Zi Fa had someone return it, saying: *"A soldier was gathering firewood and found the general’s canopy. I had him return it to the proper authorities."*

The next day, he went again and took the general’s hairpin. Zi Fa once more had it returned.

When the Qi army heard of this, they were greatly alarmed. The general and his officers conferred: *"If we do not leave today, the Chu army may take our heads."* Thus, they withdrew their forces.

A skill may be slight, yet its use profound—it lies in how the ruler employs it. If one does not honor his teacher nor cherish his resources, though he may know the great confusion, this is called the supreme subtlety.

Though the Sage may wander in the realm of self-realization, he cannot neglect his teacher and resources. Yet even when establishing them, he fears overvaluing his teacher or clinging to his resources, becoming mired in old traces and failing to reach the farthest heights. Hence, he repeatedly emphasizes: *"Do not honor your teacher, do not cherish your resources."*

Though a man relies on his teacher to awaken his initial understanding, he seeks the ultimate truth, which arises from his innate nature—this is the day of true transformation. Thus, the horse expert cannot transform a poor steed into a fine one, nor can a skilled artisan carve inferior wood into beams. Only when one forgets all aspiration can he attain the Dao’s ultimate.

Hence, Liezi, having learned from Lao Shang and befriended Bo Gao, later said: *"I do not know whether my teacher and friend were truly my teacher and friend—this is the true forgetting of teacher and resource."*

Though the Sage knows the petty man is rigid and his teachings may seem misleading, he still instructs the superior man, urging both to forget, and thus speaks of the supreme subtlety.

Good deeds and good words are what save people and things. To be a teacher or resource is to know softness and hardness.

Thus, next comes knowing the雄 (*xiong*—masculine, strong, preeminent). Knowing the雄, guarding the雌 (*ci*—feminine, yielding, retreat), makes one the valley of the world.

To be the valley of the world is to preserve one’s virtue unchanging, returning to the infant.

The雄 is exalted strength, precedence. The雌 is humility, weakness, retreat. To know one’s own exaltation, to stand out before others—if indulged, it breeds arrogance and invites calamity. Instead, one must dwell in humility, guard softness and weakness, be modest and retreat, and the world will submit, as water flows into deep valleys. When one’s heart and mind are like a valley, one preserves virtue unchanging, abandons harsh desires, and returns to the innocence of infancy.

Infancy is the pure, unadulterated harmony where distinctions of right and wrong are extinguished.

Knowing the white, guarding the black, makes one the model of the world. To be the model of the world is to preserve virtue without excess, returning to the boundless.

The man of the Dao, whose heart and mind are like a valley, generates clarity in emptiness—bright and distinct—yet he guards his depth and silence, holding himself in obscurity, making his light shine without dazzling. This can be the model for the world.

Those who take him as their model see his virtue without excess, aligning with the Dao’s true essence.

Knowing honor, guarding humiliation, makes one the valley of the world. To be the valley of the world is to make virtue complete, returning to simplicity.

Though the man of the Dao may be taken as a model, he must guard humiliation, hold victory in self-effacement, and let the world’s heart turn to him, as water flows into valleys. His capacity is like a valley—virtue is full yet nameless, returning to the Dao’s simplicity. Simplicity means concealing talent and hiding use.

When simplicity disperses, it becomes an instrument. The Sage uses it as an official, thus the great order is not violated.

Returning to the Dao’s simplicity means merging into the boundless, where vision and hearing find no grasp—this is the body’s attainment of true reality. Yet in governing, one must disperse and become an instrument.

River Master said: *"When the simplicity of all things disperses, it becomes an instrument. Used according to the Dao, it becomes divine clarity, flowing as the sun and moon, dividing into the Five Phases."*

When a man’s true heart disperses, it becomes thought and deliberation. A single movement of thought brings forth myriad actions and all affairs. Affairs are coarse instruments.

The Sage takes their talents and abilities, appointing them as leaders of the hundred officials, thus able to govern all things naturally without harm.

Lu Xi Sheng said: *"Ah, the great Dao! It abandons benevolence and righteousness. When simplicity disperses into instruments, the Sage uses them, thus able to lead the myriad coarse things. The great Dao is not an instrument, yet it uses these instruments. The great order is not violated, yet it governs all things. If one is not merged in the Dao yet seeks to use the world’s instruments, constrained by things and attempting to govern the world’s talents, I must see his ruin."*

Knowing the雄, guarding the雌, practicing virtue like a valley yielding downward. Knowing the white, guarding the black, obscuring oneself as the world’s model.

When the model is applied, one may wish to take the world. Yet to take the world by force—*I see it as inevitable failure.*

The Dao acts without action, naturally. Even the slightest matter follows it, let alone the world. If one does not follow its natural course but relies on boldness, seeking to forcibly take the world’s great instrument and indulge in artificial action, not only will he lose the Dao—I must see him perish.

*"Perish"* means *"die."*

The world’s divine instrument cannot be forced. To force it is to ruin it; to grasp it is to lose it. The divine instrument is the supreme position of heaven and earth, the divine clarity of the cosmos. Man is the divine thing of the world.

Zhuangzi said: *"I have heard of nurturing the world, not governing it."* *"Nurturing"* means fearing the world will corrupt its nature. *"Governing"* means fearing the world will stray from its virtue.

The world does not corrupt its nature nor stray from its virtue—how then could there be one who governs it? This is called *not* governing the world.

Not governing the world means following the natural course without action, letting things unfold spontaneously, so that the world is at peace and the divine things are tranquil.

If one does not follow the natural course without action but instead acts, it is like a clumsy woodcutter—though he applies his skill, he ruins more than he accomplishes. Thus, when the seven orifices were pierced, Pangu died; when the horse was whipped and urged, its strength was exhausted. Is this not the case where action brings ruin?

And yet, if one clings stubbornly and refuses to yield, claiming to be a sage of governance, not only does one lose the ultimate truth, but one will also lose one’s own authenticity.

Thus, things may prosper or decline, be molded or shattered, be strong or weak, bear loads or collapse. These eight outcomes prove that external things cannot be relied upon.

In the world, some act with sincere intent, while others follow with insincere motives. Sincerity brings order, insincerity brings chaos. Order arises naturally, while chaos demands action.

Some praise with warmth—those who extol and perfect the virtues of others—or criticize with coldness—those who slander and expose the faults of others. Praise with warmth signifies wealth and nobility, while cold criticism signifies poverty and lowliness, just as spring and summer nurture while autumn and winter wither. The affairs of the world change and transform in this way.

Some see strength and support it, others see weakness and suppress it. Some bolster the weak to make them strong, others oppress the strong to make them weak—these are the inclinations of human nature.

Some bear burdens and make them stable, others topple them and make them precarious. From this point onward, all are deviations from nature, relying solely on artificial action and boldness, seeking to take and thus bringing about these flaws.

Therefore, the sage avoids excess, avoids extravagance, avoids extravagance. Excess, extravagance, and extravagance are all transgressions beyond measure.

Thus, the sage who governs the world knows that calamity and blessing depend on each other, that blessing and calamity lie latent. Abandoning artificial action, returning to desirelessness, discarding extreme contrivance and returning to nature, abandoning luxurious adornment and returning to simplicity, abandoning excessive desires and returning to tranquility—though excess, extravagance, and extravagance are three distinct names, they are all facets of the unity of *wuwei* and naturalness. Through these excesses and extravagances, artificial action arises, which is why the Old Master issued profound warnings.

If one insists on forcing, ruin is inevitable. If one coerces the weak and strong, tilts the balance, indulges in extravagance and excess, it is better to assist the ruler with the Dao than to persist in such folly.

Thus, the *True Scripture of Dao and Virtue*—*Hidden Chamber of Reverence*—Chapter Four concludes.
The *True Scripture of Dao and Virtue*—*Compilation of Subtleties*—Chapter Five begins.

「Bìxū Zǐ Chén Jǐngyuán compiled: *The Dao Scripture*—*On Using the Dao to Assist the Ruler*—states, *"Do not use military force to coerce the world; such actions tend to rebound."* Here, *以* means *to employ*.

The virtuous minister, employing the Dao of naturalness, assists the sage ruler by first clarifying the *Heavenly Mandate* while *Dao and Virtue* follow, then *Dao and Virtue* illuminated, *benevolence and righteousness* follow, and so on—*benevolence and righteousness* clarified, *allocation and defense* follow; *allocation and defense* clarified, *form and name* follow; *form and name* clarified, *fitness and responsibility* follow; *fitness and responsibility* clarified, *self-reflection and restraint* follow; *self-reflection and restraint* clarified, *discrimination of right and wrong* follows; *discrimination of right and wrong* clarified, *rewards and punishments* follow. This is the method of using the Dao to assist the sage ruler.

Thus, one who holds the *Great Principle* (*dàxiàng*) will govern the world without harming its peace and stability. Military force is a cruel instrument, and warfare is a perilous affair—how can one display military strength to the world? The signs of war lie in the heart: harboring resentment before conflict is war, hasty speech and stern expressions are war, arrogant words and reckless challenges are war, indulging in battles and assaults is war. These four are the seeds of great and petty strife alike.

Moreover, when humans oppress things violently, things will inevitably retaliate—this is called *"beasts driven to desperation will strike."* Hence, it is said, *"such actions tend to rebound."*

Where troops are stationed, thorns and brambles grow; after great armies pass, calamitous years follow. Where soldiers dwell, they bring destruction: they plunder the people, obstruct agriculture, leaving fields barren and homes exposed, thorns and brambles to flourish wildly. Furthermore, once great armies have passed, slaughter knows no bounds, and the grievances of life and death disrupt the harmonious *qi*, causing *yin-yang* disturbances—surely floods and droughts will follow.

For one who governs his own body and seeks to resolve his troubles, military campaigns become burdensome like troops, vexations like thorns, cravings like great armies, and illness like calamitous years. Following righteousness with reckless abandon, one cannot fathom its depths.

Thus, the wise act decisively yet without arrogance, never daring to employ force for coercion. Act decisively yet do not boast, act decisively yet do not glory in victory, act decisively yet do not be proud. This is called *good use*.

The harm of military force is something even the enlightened abhor. Yet, even the sagest of rulers never abandon it entirely, for its origins are noble and profound. Gēngsāng Zǐ said: *"The roots of war lie in humanity’s very beginning."* Again, he said: *"There are those who die from taking medicine, yet one cannot forbid all physicians in the world. There are those who die from boarding ships, yet one cannot forbid all ships in the world. There are those who lose their nations through war, yet one cannot forbid all military forces in the world."*

War cannot be abolished, like water and fire. Good use brings fortune, poor use brings calamity. Hence, anger and corporal punishment must not be indulged in the home, legal punishments must not be indulged in the state, and military campaigns must not be indulged in the world.

The sage rulers of antiquity had *righteous wars* yet no *indulged wars*. Therefore, one who uses the Dao to assist the ruler must uphold *feminine tranquility*, never daring to coerce the world with military force. When forced to respond, they do so with restraint—this is called *good use*.

Decisive (*guǒ*) means *courageous*. Speaking of the good use of troops, it means courage in resolving crises, not daring to employ weapons to coerce the world. Though there is courage in resolving crises and repelling enemies, it must all be done without coercion.

Things grow strong only to decline—this is called *not the Dao*. *Not the Dao* is early decay. Though one may act decisively to resolve crises and repel enemies, it is all done without coercion. Only violence for the sake of violence is to be avoided; decisive action must be for righteousness alone, not for the love of war.

The growth of grass and trees is soft and tender; when they reach their peak, they wither and fall. Human infancy is marked by softness and weakness; when one reaches his prime, he grows old and frail. This illustrates that military might and strength lead only to ruin—once ruined, one cannot claim to follow the Dao.

Unrighteous acts cannot be emulated, and actions contrary to the Dao are better stopped early. Hence, *righteous wars* prevail, *responsive wars* succeed, *wrathful wars* perish, and *arrogant wars* are destroyed.

The good use of military force lies in decisive yet restrained action—without boasting, without wrath, without greed, without arrogance—responding only when forced, with righteousness in repelling enemies and saving people, not relying on strength or craving battle.

Governing one’s body and resolving troubles means: *"The withering of a man is due to his failure to follow the Dao; failing to follow the Dao means early death."*

To assist the ruler, one must rely on *Dao and Virtue*, not on fine soldiers and military force. Thus, it proceeds to discuss *fine soldiers*.

Fine soldiers are instruments of ill omen, and things often loathe them. Hence, those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon them. *佳* (*jiā*) means *to favor* or *to esteem*. To favor and esteem weapons and armor as objects of luxury is to esteem what is not good.

Weapons and armor, which harm the form and spirit of men, are only enjoyed by the cruel and obstinate. Even ordinary things may be loathed, how much more so by those who follow the Dao?

The gentleman values the left when at home, but the right when in war. The Dao of Heaven and Earth is such that the left is *yang*—generative, soft, and weak—while the right is *yin*—punitive, hard, and strong.

Thus, in times of peace, the gentleman esteems those of virtue to dwell on his left, but in times of war, he esteems the courageous to stand on his right.

Weapons are instruments of ill omen, not for the gentleman. This is a reiteration to emphasize the point—*the Scripture explaining itself*.

Since weapons are instruments of killing, of hardness and strength, and their purpose is to harm, they are indeed instruments of ill omen.

The gentleman takes *wuwei* and naturalness as his heart, and *Dao and Virtue*, *benevolence and righteousness* as his practice. Military force is only for defense and preparedness, not an instrument the gentleman habitually employs.

When forced to use it, he does so with calm restraint. Barbarians and savages, bandits and deceitful thieves—these are the reasons why the gentleman, who follows the Dao, may be forced to use military force. Yet he never initiates war, so he does not dare to be the aggressor but only the defender, nor to advance an inch when he must retreat a foot—all these are done without coercion.

Righteous wars are used to conquer and settle chaos, to respond to enemies—never for the sake of seizing land or treasure.»

Zhuangzi said: *"When the market-seller Yi Liao of Shì Nán played with his ball and resolved the feud between the two families, and when Sun Shu Ao took his jade staff and feathered robe while the people of Ying cast down their weapons, this is what is called victory without battle—calm and tranquil is the highest. To resolve without disorder is called tranquil; to quiet the mind is called serene. When matters arise and one remains unmoved and unperturbed, this is the method for cultivating oneself.*

*To win yet not take pleasure in it, but others do—this is one who delights in killing. He who delights in killing cannot achieve his will in the world. The great virtue of Heaven and Earth is *generation*; this is why all beings hold it in common esteem. Now, if one cannot win over others with virtue but instead raises armies, wages war, and seeks victory through slaughter, how can this be the conduct of one who follows the Dao?*

*The *Lüzi* says: When Zhao Xiangzi sent his retainers to attack Zhi and won yet wore a worried expression, this was the conduct of a virtuous ruler holding victory—thus it is said, *‘to win yet not take pleasure in it.’* Yet if there are those who praise this, it is because they delight in killing. Those who delight in killing are not only shunned by others but will themselves be slain. These are the cruel and violent who love slaughter—such men must not be allowed to achieve their will in the world. If they do, they will surely defy Heaven’s virtue, unleash indiscriminate slaughter, and how could Heaven then aid them?

*In auspicious rites, the left is honored; in funeral rites, the right is honored. The *Pianjiang* (Vanguard General) stands on the left, the *Shangjiang* (Commander-in-Chief) on the right—this is to treat them as in mourning rites. The left is *yang*, the principle of life, so in ordinary times the left is honored—this is auspicious. The right is *yin*, the principle of death, so in funeral rites the right is honored—this is inauspicious. The *Liji·Tan Gong* says: The Master stood with his disciples in a respectful bow, all facing right. The Master said: ‘Your eagerness to learn is admirable. As for me, I am mourning my sister.’ The disciples should then face left. The Commander-in-Chief, who has the power of life and death, stands on the right; the Vanguard General, who does not, stands on the left—this shows that the conduct of war follows the same principle as funeral rites. Now, if the Commander-in-Chief stands on the right, it is because he is treated as in mourning rites. When many are slain, one weeps in sorrow; when victorious, one is treated as in mourning rites. Truly, righteous war is waged only when there is no alternative. Victory brings many deaths, yet one does not take pleasure in it—thus one weeps in sorrow. The Commander-in-Chief stands on the right, for the right is the position of mourning—this is why.*

*The military is an inauspicious instrument, to be used only when there is no alternative. The gentleman values it only as a secondary matter, placing *Dao* and its constant practice above all else. Thus it is said: *‘Dao is constant and nameless.’* Though crude and small, the uncarved block (*pu*) is not dared to be enslaved by the world. If lords and kings could guard it, all things would come of their own accord. The Dao, in its greatness, is not exhausted; in its smallness, it is not neglected. It encompasses all things, penetrating the minutest details. Empty within yet full without, it contains *yin* within *yang*—this is the Dao, not the Dao of names, nor the names of the Dao. Thus it is said: *‘Dao is constant and nameless.’*

*Once nameless, it is not an instrument. Before instruments are manifest, it is called *pu*. The Dao is subtle and mysterious: unseen when viewed, unheard when listened to—this is called *small*. The world’s talents and tools have bright eyes to enslave sight, keen ears to enslave hearing, minds to enslave will, courage to enslave strength, eloquence to enslave speech, and skill to enslave action. All these named things are what the *wuwei* (non-acting) uses to govern. Only the nameless *pu* of the Dao cannot be enslaved by the world. If lords and kings could hold fast to the root of *wuwei*, vague yet present above, precious yet empty within, then external things could not burden their authenticity, desires could not deceive their spirit, and all things would come of their own accord. The four classes would have none who did not submit.*

*When Heaven and Earth unite in *wuwei*, sweet dew descends. No one commands it, yet it is evenly distributed. Heaven’s *wuwei* causes *yin* qi to descend; Earth’s *wuwei* causes *yang* qi to rise. When both act in *wuwei*, harmonious qi and sweet dew descend, bringing auspicious omens—this is the way of lords and kings. Heaven and Earth’s virtue is harmonious and divine. The *Classic* says: *‘I act not, yet the people transform themselves; I do not praise, yet the people return to simplicity.’* This is to say that without command, things naturally follow and become balanced.*

*At first, there was the Dao—nameless. Once named, one must know when to stop. Knowing when to stop is how one avoids peril. The beginning was the Dao—nameless, the constant and nameless Dao. Named things are the instruments of all things. The Dao, at its beginning, was nameless, yet it could govern all named things—this is called *pu*. When dispersed, it becomes instruments; when the sage uses it, it becomes officials and rulers. Named instruments are all the possessions of the king. Once distinctions are established, ranks are set—none may transgress above or below. Thus one must know when to stop. To know when to stop is to know oneself—this is wisdom. To know oneself and others is enlightenment. How could there then be peril?*

*The Master of Riverbank (Heshang Gong) wrote: *‘Heaven too will know it.’* This means that if one follows the Dao and practices virtue, Heaven too will recognize it. The analogy is that the Dao in the world is like streams and valleys to the rivers and seas. The Dao pervades the world without exclusion: above, it reaches the Celestial Capital and Purple Bureaus; below, it reaches the humble and lowly. To follow it brings prosperity; to defy it brings ruin. If lords and kings guard *wuwei* and tranquility, they will above attract harmonious qi and below win the people’s hearts. Root and branch will be in accord, and none will escape its blessings. This is like the flow of streams and valleys, which, when aligned with the rivers and seas, nourish all things, but when obstructed, become turbulent and turn to sand.*

*To guard the Dao is to have all things submit of their own accord. To know oneself and others is wisdom.*

「To discern others is called wisdom, hence knowing speech is how one discerns others—this is the wisdom of adapting to people, yet not knowing oneself. To know oneself and hold fast in silence is called clarity, hence knowing without speaking is how one knows Heaven—this is the self-adaptation of clarity alone, which transcends wisdom.

To overcome others is to have strength; to overcome oneself is to be mighty. To overcome others is not the Dao of enduring victory. The Dao of enduring victory is called might. Might, though strong and forceful, when encountering one who surpasses it, will falter. But to overcome oneself is the Dao of constant victory. The Dao of constant victory is called yielding. Yielding can humble itself, and things will naturally defer to it—this is called not overcoming yet overcoming oneself, not assuming burdens yet bearing them. It is ever serene and never falters; what else could be called might?

To know contentment is to be wealthy; to persist in strong conduct is to have resolve. To know contentment means to curb one’s desires. When desire does not indulge in excess, frugality suffices, and this may be called wealth. To persist in strong conduct means to exert oneself diligently. Diligence in action will surely succeed, and this may be called having resolve.

Master Zhuangzi said: Master Zeng lived in Wei, his patched robe without lining, his face swollen and his voice hoarse, his hands and feet calloused. For three days he did not light a fire, and for ten years he did not make new clothes. His crown was upright but its ribbon frayed, his collar was grasped yet his elbows exposed, his shoes were worn but their heels stacked, and as he pulled his belt he sang the *Shang* hymns, his voice filling the heavens and earth, as if issuing from metal and stone. The Son of Heaven could not find a subject like him, nor any lord a friend. Thus, those who cultivate resolve forget form, those who cultivate form forget profit, and those who perfect the Dao forget the self.

This is what is meant by knowing contentment is to be wealthy, and persisting in strong conduct is to have resolve. To never lose one’s place is to endure; to die yet not perish is longevity. *Place* refers to Heaven’s bestowal of life and death, adversity and fortune, nobility and humility, poverty and wealth. To preserve its natural order and accept it as one’s fate, without letting gain or loss unsettle the heart—this is how one endures. Thus, when alive, one does not take life as joy, knowing its inevitable course; when facing death, one does not take death as sorrow, knowing its inevitable return. To follow one’s fate in uprightness and wait for its end, without harming life through self-destruction—this is called longevity.

Master Yan Junping said: Not knowing others means one cannot navigate affairs; not navigating affairs means one cannot engage with the world. Not knowing oneself means one cannot know Heaven; not knowing Heaven means one cannot foresee what has not yet come to pass. Not overcoming others means one cannot stand above; not standing above means one cannot rule. Not overcoming oneself means one cannot attain self-mastery; not attaining self-mastery means one cannot win others. Not knowing contentment means one cannot grasp wealth; not grasping wealth means one cannot curb desire. Not persisting in strong conduct means one cannot align with the Dao; not aligning with the Dao means one cannot find harmony. Without harmony, one cannot endure in life; not enduring in life means one cannot nurture the spirit. When the spirit is not cultivated, one cannot attain longevity.

Therefore, to establish oneself in the world and benefit others while removing harm, to interact with people and adapt to change—nothing is broader than knowledge. To gather one’s intelligence and cultivate clarity, to found a state and govern its people, to realize the intent of the Dao and the mind of Heaven—nothing is greater than self-knowledge. To wield authority and govern the people, to establish laws and rites, to set forth transformations and issue commands, to rectify the ministers of the land and the lords of the states—nothing is more noble than overcoming others. To uphold virtue and morality, to align with the divine and luminous, to receive from Heaven and Earth, to harmonize yin and yang, to act or rest with measured advance and retreat—nothing is more exalted than overcoming oneself.

To govern one’s household and preserve the state, to bring the people ease and joy, to dwell in harmony with reverence and caution, to practice kindness and filial piety while fearing the law—nothing is higher than knowing contentment. To wander freely in the divine and luminous, to be tranquil and at peace, to be honored and adorned—nothing is better than finding harmony.

To serve in office and fulfill duties, to attend to superiors and oversee inferiors, to complete others’ undertakings and continue their legacies, to extend these to all the people—nothing surpasses what is enduring. What Heaven and Earth value, what all creatures depend upon, to dwell in without ever tiring, to rejoice in without ever ceasing, where all blessings flourish and none can rival its splendor—this is called longevity.

Master Lu Xisheng said: Knowledge that comes from without is called wisdom, like the external radiance of the sun and fire. Knowledge that returns within is called clarity, like the internal reflection of gold and water. To use yielding strength to overcome others’ violence is the force of the Daoist Way; to uphold yielding to overcome one’s own restlessness is the might of virtue. To know contentment in matters of profit and desire is to not lose one’s great undertaking, hence it is called wealth and might.

To practice benevolence and righteousness is to reach eminent virtue, hence it is called having resolve. To act without ever losing one’s place is to endure; to die yet the Dao not perish—this is called longevity. To know others is to overcome others; to know oneself is to know Heaven. To never lose one’s place and to die yet not perish, drifting freely without attachment, attaining the Dao—this is why it is followed by the great hymn: *"The great Dao drifts, drifting, its left and right unbound."* The great Dao drifts, drifting—without clinging or attachment. The Dao is supremely high without equal, supremely deep without bottom. It is level as a carpenter’s plumb and straight as a mason’s line, round as a compass and square as a ruler. It encompasses the universe without exterior, and penetrates all things without limit. It drifts, drifts, filling the boundless expanse, yet without clinging or attachment—this is the very body of the Dao. Whether it manifests on the left or the right, all things meet their source, and none escape its reach—this is the very use of the Dao. All things rely upon it for life yet it does not decline; its work is done yet it claims no credit. To rely means to depend. Heaven depends on the Dao’s yang-qi to move and turn above, Earth depends on the Dao’s yin-qi to rest and settle below. Though Heaven and Earth are vast, they still depend on the Dao for its function. How much more so the myriad things, which all arise from it! Moreover, the great Dao is without sentiment, giving birth to Heaven and Earth; how could it ever refuse to labor for the myriad things? Yet again, the great Dao is without form, shaping the world without material; though all things have names of reliance and dependence, when tracing their origins...」

「Lofty and singularly transformative, the Dao gives rise to things as they change and yet remains self-generated—thus leaving no trace of reliance or repayment. The Sage’s accomplishments are complete yet he does not claim them as his own; this is the very use of the Dao/Way.

He nurtures the myriad things yet does not lord over them, ever without desire, and thus may be called *virtue/power* in its small aspect. The Dao can cover and nourish all beings, yet it does not expect their gratitude in return. Hence, the Sage cultivates benevolence and love to sustain all classes of beings, allowing each to fulfill its nature and grow without restraint. The *Sutra/Scripture* says: *"Ever without desire, one beholds its subtlety; subtlety allows entry into all things, and thus one may name the Dao’s simplicity as small."* One variant reads: *"The Dao clothes and covers all things"*—here, *clothes and covers* means *cover and nourish*.

When all things return to it yet it does not claim lordship, this may be called *virtue/power* in its great aspect. The Dao covers and sustains all things, encompassing them without exclusion; all things return to it yet it remains undifferentiated, undifferentiated yet not claiming lordship. Zhuangzi says: *"Undifferentiated yet encompassing all things—this is what is called great. Greatness contains all things, and thus the Dao may be called great."* Therefore, the Sage never claims to be great, and thus he achieves true greatness. The Sage holds to the Dao, humbly calling himself *孤 (Gū, solitary)*, *寡 (guǎ, few)*, and *不谷 (bùgǔ, not plentiful)*, demonstrating his refusal to claim greatness.

All nations return to him, yet his joy in promoting them never wanes—this is how he achieves true greatness. Du Guangting says: *"The Sage loves the people and relieves the suffering of all things, extending his virtue to great and small alike—this may be called small virtue/power."* Yet, he allows all things to follow their nature and attributes his achievements to Heaven—this may also be called great virtue/power.

The Dao/Way applies its transformations, dispenses its virtue to humanity, and stirs the pure and harmonious winds, while clothing the world with its clear and tranquil governance. Forgetting his own deeds, not exalting himself above others, his grand achievements may be called great, and his virtue may endure forever—because he does not claim greatness, he attains this very eminence.

Those who cultivate their personal conduct are expansive and unconfined, like clouds without form or water without vessel. They may turn left or right, adapt to every shape and direction, yet remain unconstrained by fixed norms. When things come, they respond; when they reflect, they broaden. They do not boast of their responsive and expansive nature, though their benefits to all things are manifold. Benevolence extends even to the lowliest creatures, yet he never makes it his own. All good deeds converge in harmony, yet he does not claim them as his own.

Thus, he manifests the virtue/power that is neither small nor great, bearing no name of self-exaltation or self-denigration, and may be said to align with the complete and true Dao.

The great Dao is vast and boundless, yet left or right, all things meet its source. When all things return to it, this is because he holds to the great principle and its manifestations—thus, it follows with the next step: holding to the great manifestations.

When he holds to the great manifestations, all under Heaven proceed, yet they do so without harm, in peace and stability. The great manifestations are the great principles. The eight trigrams and nine categories are what is meant here.

The rulers of the *太古 (Tàigǔ, Great Antiquity)* governed with no action, relying solely on the virtue/power of Heaven. When the Sage established the trigrams and observed the manifestations, the distinctions of auspicious and inauspicious became clear, and transformations arose—thus there came to be gains and losses, advances and retreats.

When the vast and primordial transformations first emerged, the governance of the great principles began to shape the world, and the world’s original purity and simplicity departed. *往 (wǎng, to proceed/leave)* here means *to depart/abandon*.

Once the original purity and simplicity have departed, the great principle may still be upheld—thus, to proceed does not bring harm. To proceed without harm is because he acts according to the times, establishes achievements based on resources, assigns roles according to ability, and does not damage their inherent nature—thus all under Heaven are at peace and stable.

Yan Junping says: *"The Dao has no form, so Heaven and Earth rely on it to give birth. The Dao has no possession, so yin and yang rely on it to begin. The Dao has no fixed principle, so the four seasons rely on it for their work. The Dao has no manifestation, so all classes of beings rely on it to proceed."* Thus, the great principle has no principle, the great manifestation has no manifestation; greatness is without limit, yet it is not without possession. It gives birth where there is no birth, and denies where there is no denial—so the Dao achieves without action, and Heaven and Earth are thus formed; virtue/power is realized without labor, and all things find their place. What more need be done?

Not without limit yet not without possession, not acting yet not denying—here the Dao finds its own way, and all things find their own way. This is what is called the virtue/power of Heaven.

If the Dao waits for transformations to occur through deliberate action before they manifest, then what it achieves will be few. If virtue/power waits for labor to arise before it applies its function, then what all things receive will be sparse. This is what is meant by gains and losses, advances and retreats—thus the following passage states:

*"Music and baits: passing guests will stop."* This is an illustrative metaphor.

When music’s harmony is played, people must linger briefly. When the *鐸饵 (duò’ěr, ritual bells and lures)* are beautiful, guests must pause.

When music is exhausted, the ears are filled yet pass onward. When the baits are overindulged, the tongue grows weary and recoils. When guests stop, the host grows weary and takes offense.

When the law first arises, the people hold it dear and praise it. But when its flaws appear, they fear it and scorn it. Zhuangzi says: *"Benevolence and righteousness are the ancestral halls of the former kings, where one may stay but one night, yet not dwell long-term. To observe and then criticize excessively—this is the proper use of law."* If it lingers in the world and grows corrupt, becoming stagnant and enduring, then reason must fail.

Once reason has failed, how could proceeding not bring harm?

「Once having suffered its harm, then how could one speak of its peace and tranquility?

The Dao/Way, when uttered, is bland and without flavor.

When music is exhausted and the baits are overindulged, the ears and tongue grow weary and recoil in excess. When the great law shows its flaws, fear and scorn become manifest.

Yet the Dao/Way, when spoken of, is bland and without taste—this is what is meant by *"truthful words are not beautiful."* In stillness and simplicity, without contrivance, the people delight in their nature, thus they content with full bellies and dwell in ease, lost in the boundless and indistinct, unaware of their whereabouts.

Could there ever be harmonious melodies or sweet flavors to be savored and chewed upon?

The Dao/Way is unseen when looked upon, unheard when listened to, and cannot be exhausted when applied.

For laws are shaped by contrivance, and those who cling to them will find their limits.

The Dao/Way is natural and without contrivance, yet neither sounds nor colors can fathom its depths.

Thus it is said: *"Unseen when looked upon, unheard when listened to—from ancient times to today, its name never fades."* The common folk use it daily without knowing its true nature, yet it cannot be exhausted when applied.

The *象 (xiàng, form/manifestation)* without form means there is nothing to grasp. Without grasping, its application cannot be exhausted. But if one grasps it and claims possession, how could one avoid the extremes of excess and deficiency? Hence, it is followed by the principle: *"When about to exhaust, first fully extend. When about to weaken, first fully strengthen. When about to abandon, first fully establish. When about to take away, first fully bestow."*

This is called *微明 (wēimíng, subtle clarity)*.

Many learned interpreters of this chapter have offered varied explanations, yet none align with its proper structure. Some cite Confucius: *"One may follow the Way with them, but not yet establish it; one may establish it with them, but not yet wield it with subtlety."* Others draw parallels with statecraft and strategic maneuvering, akin to the *纵横 (zōnghéng, sophistry/scheming)* school—equally unreliable. This is truly in harmony with the *阴符 (Yīnfú, Yinfu)*’s celestial mechanics, a secret employed by those of lofty insight and adaptable understanding.

Lu Xisheng said: *"The profound dwelling of the Sage is nothing more exquisite than the interplay of *权实 (quánshí, expedient and truth)*. Truth is rooted in conformity with the natural order, while expedient arises from reversing established principles. Expedient aids truth, and truth enables expedient—though they differ in application, their essence converges in unity."*

After Laozi first guided people with truth, establishing the teaching of *知常 (zhīcháng, knowing the constant)*, he further employed expedient to address practical matters, clarifying the necessity of reversal. This is what the *易 (Yì, I Ching)* speaks of: *"Bending to complete all things without loss, encompassing heaven and earth without overreaching."*

The *Honglie Jie* says: *"Qi Huan of Qi loved delicacies, and Yi Ya cooked his own son as bait to please him. The Lord of Yu loved treasures, and Duke Xian of Jin used a jade and a horse to lure him. The Hu King loved music, and Duke Mu of Qin used female dancers to entice him. These were all instances where people were ensnared by their own desires."*

Yan Junping said: *"The Dao/Way traverses the moral realm, the divine illuminates it, heaven and earth transform through it, and yin and yang regulate it. Truth reverses into emptiness, clarity into obscurity, abundance into decline, tension into relaxation, possession into loss, life into death—these are the inherent natures of things and the natural principles of the Dao/Way.

Thus, the advantages of reversal and the benefits of yielding and extending: the Dao/Way governs heaven, heaven governs the sovereign, the sovereign governs his ministers, and the ministers govern the people. All living beings rely on this to sustain themselves.

When tigers and leopards prepare to pounce, they first conceal their claws. When wolves and jackals are about to devour, their teeth are not seen. The Sage abandons his personal intentions to conform with the Dao/Way, the wise adapt to the world to serve the people. Loyal words, though harsh, preserve the truth; treacherous ministers, when rising, must be appeased by their lord. Knowing this and applying it, all within the six directions shall prosper.

Ignoring this and applying it, even within the household, kin become bandits.

Thus, sons and brothers may become wolves and jackals when given advantage, while enemies and rivals may act as fathers and elders when denied. Yet within advantage lies disadvantage, and within disadvantage lies advantage—one may vanish while the other persists. Hence, even those who are not loyal cannot be trusted if they are close, and even those who are not virtuous cannot be loved if they are near. This is the lament of the worthy and the vigilant concern of the Sage and the wise.

Zhuangzi praised Xu Wugui’s audience with Duke Wu of Wei, where he first discussed horses and dogs before tiring the lord’s spirit and form, ultimately binding him with political counsel—this was the expedient of the wise, wielding extension and exhaustion.

If one applies this principle and extends it, then the meaning of *微明 (subtle clarity)* becomes evident.

Softness overcomes hardness, weakness overcomes strength—this is the logic of the Dao/Way. Examining this reveals the application of *权变 (quánbiàn, expedient adaptation)*.

Fish cannot be pulled from the depths without harm, nor can the state’s instruments of utility be displayed to the people.

The state’s *权谋 (quánmóu, expedient strategies)* are great instruments for benefiting the world. If fish are wrenched from their natural pools and streams, even ants may torment them. If the state’s expedient strategies are leaked to the lower ranks, petty officials will exploit them—what of the cunning tyrants?

The *Yinfu Jing* says: *"Heaven has five hidden calamities; those who perceive them thrive. How could they be recklessly revealed?"*

Another interpretation: *"Fish pulled from the depths cannot be retrieved, and expedient lost to ministers cannot be reclaimed."*

Han Fei said: *"The sovereign’s power is like the depths—his ministers are fish within it. The ancients spoke in parables because of this.

Rewards and punishments are instruments of utility. The sovereign wields them to control his ministers, while the ministers seize them to dominate the sovereign. Hence, if the sovereign first reveals what he will reward, the ministers will scheme to earn his favor, claiming it as his virtue. If he first reveals what he will punish, the ministers will band together to shield themselves, calling it the strength of his rule. The state’s instruments of utility—should they not be handled with care?"*

The *Honglie Jie* says: *"In ancient times, Sici Zhihan served the state of Song. He told the Song ruler: 'The stability or peril of the state, the order or chaos of the people, rests on your administration of rewards and punishments.

When you grant titles and favors, the people rejoice. When you mete out executions and punishments, the people resent them. Let me, your subject, bear the resentment, while you enjoy the favor.'

The Song ruler said: 'Good.' When I receive the praise, you shall bear the blame. I know well that I shall not be laughed at by the other lords."*」

The people of the state all knew that the power of executions rested solely with Sici Zhihan. The great ministers favored him, while the common folk feared him. Yet even after not reaching a full year in office, Zhihan resigned, leaving the Song ruler to monopolize governance—this was like a fish escaping from the depths, while the sharp tools of power were handed to the lower ranks.

The art of She Zhang in granting and withholding lies in subtlety, which is called *Dao of the Profound and Mysterious*.

When the Dao is overt, the fish escapes from the depths;
When it is subtle, it aligns with the *Dao of the Constant and Natural*.
Thus, it follows with the principle of *Dao of the Constant and Natural, Without Action*.

The *Dao of the Constant and Natural, Without Action* yet accomplishes all things—
If a lord or king could uphold it,
All things would naturally transform.

For the Dao is ever constant,
Deep and still, unmoving—
Thus it is called *Without Action*.

Yet when it responds to things, all things move of their own accord—
Thus it is called *Without Not-Action*.

If a lord or king could always hold emptiness as his heart
And *Without Action* as his form,
Unyielding in his grasp yet never rigid,
Then all things would naturally conform to his transformation.

The *Classic* says:
*"I act without action, and the people transform themselves.
If they transform yet wish to act,
I shall govern them with the nameless and pure."*

For the virtuous few in the world are outnumbered by the unvirtuous many—
Thus, the sage’s *virtue-transformations* are always in aid of the good,
And even if some do not follow his transformation but instead stir and act contrary to the Dao,
The sage still remains lenient,
And shall govern them with the nameless Dao of purity,
To bring them to stillness and *Without Action*—
Then the world will naturally settle.

The Dao itself leaves no trace,
Yet it borrows the pure and simple to speak of it;
Those who cling to its traces,
Who grasp at the pure and simple as something fixed,
Become the bane of later ages.
The sage fears that this bane cannot be cured,
So he shall also not desire to preserve this nameless purity—
Then the world will gradually settle of its own accord,
Entering the *Dao of the Constant and Natural, Without Action* yet *Without Not-Action*.

Lu Xi Sheng says:
The first chapter takes *Constant Dao* as its essence,
*Constant Dao* as its application,
And culminates in the profound depths.
This chapter takes *Without Action* as its essence,
*Without Not-Action* as its application,
And unifies them with *comprehensive forgetting*—
Its beginning and end are interlinked,
And it exhausts the essence and application.

The *Dao of the Constant and Natural, Without Action*—
This is called *Constant Dao*.
*Constant Dao* responds to changes,
Yet accomplishes all things without fail.

**The Daoist Classic of the *Zangshi Mowei* Chapter Five concludes.**
**The Daoist Classic of the *Zangshi Zuanwei* Chapter Six concludes.**

**The Daoist Classic of the *Zangshi Mowei* (Continued) – Chapter Seven**

**Bìxū Zǐ Chén Jǐngyuán’s Annotation:**

The lower section elucidates *virtue/power (dé)*, taking *not-virtue (bùdé)* as its origin.
*Not-virtue* is the forgetting of *virtue/power* in order to respond to things.

The *highest virtue/power* is *not-virtue*—thus it possesses *virtue/power*.
*Virtue/power* is *obtaining (dé)*.
Within, it is obtained in the heart;
Without, it is obtained in things—
Always obtained yet never lost,
Beneficial yet never harmful.
When things thrive through it, this is called *virtue/power*.

Its origin lies in the *Dao’s* accumulation—
Thus it has *virtue/power*.
Having *virtue/power* yet no name—
This is the *Dao’s* profundity.
Having *virtue/power* yet a name—
This is the *Dao’s* shallowness.
The *Dao* has depth and shallowness—
Thus *virtue/power* has high and low.

The so-called *highest virtue/power*—
This is *ultimate virtue/power*.
*Ultimate virtue/power* is profound,
Is distant,
And harmonizes with things.
People do not see its traces—
Thus it is called *not-virtue*,
For it contains light yet conceals brilliance,
Its actions are fragmented yet complete,
Causing the people to use it daily without knowing,
And its *virtue/power* is whole—
Thus it is said to possess *virtue/power*.

The *lower virtue/power* does not lose *virtue/power*—
Thus it is *not-virtue*.
The *lower virtue/power*—
Its traces and actions gradually become manifest,
Scattered like a single flower’s petals,
Following things passively,
While things preserve their own ease.
The world praises it,
Attributing beauty to itself—
Yet it is distant from *ultimate virtue/power*,
And loses *ultimate virtue/power*—
Thus it is said to be *not-virtue*.

The *highest virtue/power* acts *without action*,
Yet does nothing—
The one with *highest virtue/power*,
Naturally receives the utmost subtlety,
Obtains the essence of *original qi*,
His spirit permeates heaven and earth,
His clarity rivals the sun and moon,
With no thought, no deliberation—
His heart is naturally *without action*,
Forgetting merit, forgetting traces,
Doing nothing yet obtaining all—
This is called *without action* yet *without not-action*.

The ancient text reads: *The highest virtue/power acts without action yet without not-action.*
It speaks of those with *highest virtue/power*—
Their mind is still, their nature serene,
Even their desires do not defy nature,
Their actions do not oppose all things—
Thus they act *without action* yet *without not-action*.

The *lower virtue/power* acts,
Yet does nothing—
The *lower virtue/power* descends from the *highest virtue/power*,
Naturally receiving the plain and ordinary,
Obtaining the pure harmony of *original qi*,
His spirit aligns with yin and yang,
His clarity mirrors the sun and moon,
The people all revere and joyfully extol him—
Thus it is said to do nothing.

The ancient text reads: *The lower virtue/power acts yet does nothing.*
It speaks of those with *lower virtue/power*—
Their minds imitate emptiness,
They cling to the void,
Responding to things with caution,
Daring not to act hastily—
Thus it is said to do nothing.

*Highest benevolence (shàngrén)* acts,
Yet does nothing—
The benevolent universally bestow and love all—
All things are possible.
Possible yet without partiality—
Thus it is called *highest benevolence*.
With a mind to benefit all beings—
Thus it is said to act.
Merit accomplished yet not claimed,
Affairs completed yet not controlled—
Thus it is said to do nothing.

*Highest righteousness (shàngyì)* acts,
Yet does something—
Righteousness is what is fitting.
What is fitting must entail some loss,
Yet in all matters, nothing is unfitting—
Thus it is called *highest righteousness*.
There is fitting and benefit—
Thus it acts.
What it does involves cutting and severing—
Thus it is said to do something.

*Highest ritual (shànglǐ)* acts,
Yet none respond—
Then it rolls up its sleeves and drags them along.
*Rolling up its sleeves*—
Exposing the arms by pushing aside sleeves.
*Drags*—draws.
Ritual is *treading*—
Treading the *Dao* and walking,
Distinguishing high and low,
Fixing noble and base,
With humility, respect, harmony, and gentleness—
This is the root of ritual—
Thus it is called *highest*.
Jade and silk exchanged,
威仪相答 (威严的仪节相互应答),
Bowing, kneeling, clenching fists,
Advancing, retreating, glancing and bowing—
This is the ornament of ritual—
Thus it is called *lower*.

Zhuangzi said:
*The greatest ritual aligns with heaven and earth in rhythm.*
Again:
*Those who use ritual as wings—*
This is how they move through the world.

The ancient sages established ritual
To settle the mind and *qi*,
To refine appearance—
Thus it is said to act.
Yet the mediocre and lowly
Abandon the root and exalt the branches,
Twisting explanations and multiplying complexities,
Unable to respond—
Thus it is said none respond.
This is the slight failing of ritual.
But there are those who flush with anger,
Brandishing arms,
Dragging fingers to point out right and wrong,
Competing—
This is the extreme failing of ritual.

The Master Lao enumerates the undifferentiated and scattered,
Arriving at this in the lower text.

Yán Jūnping said:
*Empty and without action, guiding all things—*
This is called the *Daoist*.
*Clear and tranquil, responding without fail—*
This is called the *virtuous*.
*Compassionately loving all things, endlessly bestowing—*
This is called the *benevolent*.
*Rectifying names, aligning reality, acting appropriately—*
This is called the *righteous*.
*Humble, retiring, courteous, guarding harmony—*
This is called the *ritualist*.

These five are all traces of the *Dao’s* exposition,
Not the *ultimate ultimate*.

The *ultimate ultimate* transcends all distinctions—
How could there be these five?

Thus, losing the *Dao* leads to *virtue/power*,
Losing *virtue/power* leads to *benevolence*,
Losing *benevolence* leads to *righteousness*,
Losing *righteousness* leads to *ritual*.
*Dao, virtue/power, benevolence, righteousness, ritual*—
These five are the *Dao’s* essence,
Unattainable through inquiry—
Thus they are merged into one.
Once divided, the five distinctions appear,
And their traces become manifest—
Thus they are applied according to the age.

The *Dao* is the essence of *virtue/power*,
*Virtue/power* is the function of the *Dao*.
Separating essence for function—
Thus losing the *Dao* leads to *virtue/power*.
*Virtue/power* is *obtaining (dé)*.
When things obtain life, this is called *virtue/power*—
Where there is life, there must be love—
Thus losing *virtue/power* leads to *benevolence*.
*Benevolence* is *kinship (qīn)*.
Loving things appropriately—
Thus losing *benevolence* leads to *righteousness*.
*Righteousness* is *what is fitting (yí)*.
What is fitting demands humility and respect—
Thus losing *righteousness* leads to *ritual*.
*Ritual* is *treading (lǚ)*—
Treading the *Dao* to form its patterns—
Simple and direct, it is easy to follow;
Complex and twisted, it leads to chaos.
*Losing*—this is *extinction*.
When the branches flourish and the root perishes—
This is the natural order.

Yán Jūnping said:
*The emperor’s foundation—*
The *Dao* is its root,
*Virtue/power* is its beginning.
Losing the *Dao*, *virtue/power* follows;
Losing *virtue/power*, *benevolence* follows;
Losing *benevolence*, *righteousness* follows;
Losing *righteousness*, *ritual* follows;
Losing *ritual*, chaos follows.
These five are the *Dao’s* unified body,
Yet the world’s rulers vary in length.

The purpose is not what one truly desires,
The pursuit is not what one truly obtains—
They neglect the natural Way and instead cling to petty trifles.

Now, *ritual* as a practice:
Within and without, it contradicts itself,
Flourishing in ornament while lacking substance,
Its branches thrive while its roots wither.
*Ritual* grows thin compared to loyalty,
Authority grows light compared to *virtue/power*,
Faith does not reach *righteousness*,
*Virtue/power* does not suffice for *benevolence*.
This is the end of governance,
The beginning of chaos.
Deceit and pretense arise from it,
Anger and contention take root—
This is what is called *superficial* teaching.

For *ritual* is the thinning of loyalty and faith,
And the origin of chaos.
If one abandons *virtue/power*, *moral cultivation*, *benevolence*, and *righteousness*,
And relies solely on *ritual* and teaching—
Is this not the thinning of loyalty and faith,
And the origin of chaos?

But if one reveres *virtue/power* and the seven *righteous acts*,
And harmonizes them with *ritual* and teaching—
Then *ritual* is elevated above them,
And where would there be disorder?

Zhuangzi said:
The Sage acts through unsaid teaching.
The *Dao* cannot be attained,
*Virtue/power* cannot be reached,
But *benevolence* can be cultivated,
And *righteousness* can be diminished,
While *ritual* is where pretense thrives—
This aligns with the origin of chaos.

*Foresight* is the ornament of the *Dao*,
And the beginning of folly.
To cultivate and exalt *ritual* and teaching is wisdom—
Wisdom is foresight,
Thus it is called *foresight*.
Once foresight precedes things,
How can one remain detached?
Thus governing with wisdom is a state’s ruin—
Is this not the ornament of the *Dao*
And the beginning of folly?

But if one conceals foresight and wisdom,
Thinking and deliberating nothing,
Then one returns to simplicity and purity.

Excessive *ritual* leads to chaos,
Excessive wisdom leads to deceit—
This is an inevitable truth.

Thus, the true person dwells in substance, not ornament,
In reality, not superficiality—
Hence, they discard the latter and embrace the former.

The true person is one who follows the *Dao*.
Wenzi said:
The true person is serene without thought,
Unburdened without worry,
Walks where there are no paths,
Moves without fatigue,
Exits without gates,
Enters without walls,
Unites their vital essence,
Lulls their perceptions,
Vacant and unforced—
Yet nothing remains undone.

Thus, their dwelling is naturally pure and substantial,
In harmony with the highest *virtue/power*.

Residing in loyalty and faith,
Diligently pursuing sincerity—
How could they indulge in ornament, pretense, or deceit?

Therefore, they discard the shallow ends of *ritual* and *righteousness*,
And take the great foundation of *virtue/power* and *moral cultivation*.

The ancient text originally combined these four sentences with the character *chǔ* (处).

There is a wondrous *Dao*, and from it all things are born.
The great *virtue/power* of Heaven and Earth is called *generativity*.
Things receive *generativity* and call it *virtue/power*—
Thus, it is called *uppermost* *virtue/power*.
In *virtue/power*, there is no loss—
Thus, it is called *lowermost* *virtue/power*.
Though upper and lower differ,
Each attains its unity—
Hence, it follows with the *One* of antiquity.

The *One* of antiquity:
Heaven, obtaining *One*, is clear;
Earth, obtaining *One*, is tranquil;
The *Spirit*, obtaining *One*, is numinous;
The *Valley*, obtaining *One*, is full;
All things, obtaining *One*, are born;
The sovereign, obtaining *One*, corrects the world.
This is how they attain *One*.

*Antiquity* refers to the distant past.
*The One* is the primal *qi*.
Primal *qi* is the child of the Great *Dao*,
The mother of the numinous,
The ancestor of Great Harmony,
The progenitor of Heaven and Earth.
Condensed, it forms living beings;
Dispersed, it radiates as light.
In the yin, it shares the yin’s *virtue/power*;
In the yang, it rides the yang’s waves.
It dwells in the Celestial Capital yet remains untainted,
It resides in the humble hut yet remains unsoiled.
Its position is unchanging above and below,
Its essence is undivided through ages—
Thus, it is called *One*.

Concealed within the heart, it is the *Numinous Treasury*;
Ascending to the mind, it is the *Numinous Platform*;
Motionless and still, it is the *True Sovereign*;
Guiding the form, it is the *True Ruler*.
When coiled, it retreats into the pores;
When unfurled, it fills the vast expanse.

The *Western Ascension Scripture* says:
Obtain *One*, and all matters are complete.
If a person empties their heart,
*The One* will naturally return.

Zhuangzi said:
*Qi* is the void that awaits things.
Only the *Dao* gathers the void.
Again, it says:
*The empty chamber births white auspiciousness*—
Stop, stop.

Heaven is the pure yang *qi*.
And Heaven, obtaining it, thus moves vigorously and dynamically,
Its dome vast and encompassing,
Its symbols clear and bright—
All things derive their origin from it.

Earth is the pure yin substance.
And Earth, obtaining it, thus remains faithful, yielding, and weak,
Its foundation firm and thickly bearing,
Its stability unshaken—
All things derive their sustenance from it.

The *Spirit* is the subtle expression of all things.
And the *Spirit*, obtaining it, thus transforms without limit,
Its reversals endless,
Its rectitude resonant and responsive—
Its correspondence to things is inexhaustible.

The *Valley* is the deepest of the Han.
And the *Valley*, obtaining it, thus moves *qi* and channels water,
Its fullness unexhausted.

The *Ten Thousand* refers to the greatness of numbers.
*Things* are the visible forms.
And things, obtaining it, thus generate and complete without ceasing—
Their extinction is unknown.

The *Marquis* and *King* are the five ranks of nobility.
The *King* is the general term for ruler.
Obtaining it, they thus eternally possess the great treasure,
Their will unchallenged—
And they correct the world.

These five attain clarity, tranquility, numinosity, and fullness,
And all things thrive because the sovereign’s *Dao* is correct.

*Correctness* means attaining the *One* of the primal void.
If the *One* is lost, all things perish—
As stated below.

The *Kaiyuan* edition reads: *"Their governance lacks the One,"*
Two characters missing in meaning.
This follows the ancient text as correct.

Yán Jūnping’s version omits:
*"All things obtain it and thus are born,"*
And the following fourteen characters:
*"All things, without it, would fear extinction."*
For humans are the most refined of all things,
And the sovereign is the ruler of humans—
Thus, it is summarized.

With it, the text is complete;
Without it, the meaning is not lacking—
This also aligns with principle.

Heaven, without clarity, would fear cracking;
Earth, without tranquility, would fear upheaval;
The *Spirit*, without numinosity, would fear cessation;
The *Valley*, without fullness, would fear exhaustion;
All things, without *generativity*, would fear annihilation;
The sovereign, without exalted nobility, would fear ruin.

*"Without it"* refers to the language of warning through consequences.

Heaven is the manifestation of the *virtue/power* of Yang, the emblem of the sovereign. When it is said that Heaven lacks clarity, if it relies on itself as if on something secure, it loses the *Way* of supreme luminosity, leading to discord between Yin and Yang, the collapse of order and principles, and the stagnation of the unified *qi*—thus risking the omen of fissures. Moreover, when Yang *qi* is excessive, calamities and decline must follow; when the harmonious balance disperses, fissures must occur. Thus, the *Yin-Yang Book* states: *"Heaven’s cracking is the result of insufficient Yang *qi* and the decline of the sovereign’s virtue."*

From here onward, all are words of admonition.

Earth is the manifestation of the *virtue/power* of Yin, the emblem of the minister. When it is said that Earth lacks tranquility, if it relies on itself as if on something secure, it loses the *Way* of serenity, leading to the distortion of firmness and softness, the collapse of mountains and rivers, and the failure to uphold the unified *qi*—thus risking the consequences of eruption and overflow. Moreover, when Yin *qi* reaches its extreme, there must be flooding disasters; when the harmonious balance dissipates, eruptions must occur. Thus, the *Yin-Yang Book* states: *"Earthquakes arise from excess Yin *qi* and the neglect of the minister’s duty."*

The *Spirit* is the essence of transformation. All things with refined vitality possess their *Spirit*—an unfathomable interplay of Yin and Yang. When it is said that the *Spirit* lacks numinosity, if it relies on itself as if on something secure, it loses the *Way* of supreme transformation, leading to the birth of calamities and omens, the rise of portents, and the abandonment of the unified *qi*—thus risking the time of cessation. When the *Spirit* strays from the *Way*, it harms the people; when the people are harmed, they rebel in destruction. Destruction without *Spirit*—what else but cessation?

The *Valley* is the void that receives all things. When it is said that the *Valley* lacks fullness, if it relies on itself as if on something secure, it loses the *Way* of flowing nourishment, leading to the fear of collapse and desolation, the obstruction of the unified *qi*—thus risking the isolation of exhaustion. Exhaustion affects the state, hence the Luo River’s drying led to the fall of Xia, and the Yellow River’s depletion caused the ruin of Shang.

All things have form and substance, destined to transform. When it is said that all things lack *generativity*, if they rely on themselves as if on something secure, they lose the *Way* of yielding compliance, leading to the inversion of nature’s order, the dispersal of the unified *qi*—thus risking the period of annihilation.

The sovereign unites the Three Realms as sovereign and governs all things. He must cultivate humility to nurture the talents of the people. When it is said that the sovereign lacks exalted nobility, if he relies on himself as if on something secure, he loses the *Way* of pure transformation, causing officials to neglect their duties, the people to abandon loyalty, and the risk of ruin and overthrow. All the matters mentioned above—though extending to Heaven and Earth—ultimately serve as warnings to the sovereign.

If the sovereign heeds these warnings, how much more should the common people?

Thus, nobility finds its foundation in humility, and height finds its base in lowliness.

Nobility—how can it arise from itself? It must be upheld by the humble, and only then does it attain nobility. This is the foundation of humility.

Height—how can it arise from itself? It must be borne by those beneath, and only then does it attain elevation. This is the base of lowliness.

Therefore, the sovereign addresses himself as *"lonely, widowed, and unworthy"*—is this not the embodiment of humility as foundation? Is it not so? *"Lonely, widowed, and unworthy"* are terms of common reproach, yet the sovereign adopts them as titles, cultivating humility to avoid arrogance. Is this not the foundation of humility? And if it is not, then truly it is the foundation of humility.

Thus, when praised repeatedly, he does not take pride. A sage ruler forgets his name and self; though the world praises him often, he does not grow more encouraged. Though the world criticizes him often, he does not grow discouraged. How would he know whether he is truly noble or not?

The *Guoyu* text reads: *"When praised repeatedly, there is no praise."* When considering the components of a chariot, there are wheels, axles, frames, and shafts—yet none is called a "chariot" alone. Only when combined do they form a chariot. When considering the components of a state, there are scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants—yet none is called a "state" alone. Only when combined do they form a state. How could a chariot be formed without its parts? How could a state survive without its people? This is a grave warning to the sovereign, urging him to love his people.

He does not wish to shine like jade, nor to be dull like stone.
*Jianjian*—the appearance of jade.
*Luoluo*—the appearance of stone.
A sage ruler does not desire ostentation like jade, nor does he wish to be obscure like stone. Instead, he cultivates a hidden light, guarding the *Way* of the unified *qi*, becoming the model for all under Heaven.

The ancient text reads: *"Like jade, like stone."* The transmitted versions by Yan Yuan and Xu Xian adopt this.

Having attained nobility and height, yet grounding himself in humility, addressing himself as lonely and widowed, repeatedly practicing modesty—this is why it is followed by the *Way* of return.

*Return* is the movement of the *Way*.
*Return* means restoration, transformation.
The origin of all things lies in emptiness and stillness.
Before things arise, they first return to the origin of emptiness and stillness. When they transform, they emerge from emptiness and stillness into motion—thus, first returning, then moving.

Therefore, the *Yijing* states in the *Fu* (Return) hexagram:
*"The firm returns and moves, yielding and proceeding—
Thus, entering and exiting without haste—
This is what is meant."*

The weak are the application of the *Way*.
Since returning to emptiness and stillness is the movement of the *Way*, then softness, weakness, and receptivity are truly the application of the *Way*.

All things under Heaven are born from existence, and existence is born from nonexistence.
Existence is the One.
The One is the Original *Qi*.
It is said that all things under Heaven are born from the Original *Qi*. The Original *Qi* possesses light without form—though light and shadow emerge from the void.

The void is the substance of the *Way*.
*The Liezi* states:
*"Formed things arise from the formless—
Then how did Heaven and Earth come to be?"*
It also says:
*"Movement without form does not produce form,
Yet produces shadow.
Sound without substance does not produce sound,
Yet produces echo.
The void in motion does not produce the void,
Yet produces existence."*

Thus, all things are born from existence, and existence is born from nonexistence—yet all things transform uniquely.

Yan Junping says:
*"Heaven and Earth are born from Great Harmony,
And Great Harmony is born from the void—
This is the origin of returning to emptiness and stillness."*

The moment things are about to move, they first return to the origin of emptiness and stillness.
Only the superior sage understands how to move from emptiness and stillness—
thus, the next passage speaks of the superior sage hearing the *Dao*.

The superior sage hears the *Dao* and diligently practices it.
The mediocre sage hears the *Dao* yet is half-convinced, half-doubtful—
thus, it is as if it exists and as if it does not.
The inferior sage hears the *Dao* and laughs loudly in disbelief.
If it is not laughed at, then it is not worthy to be called the *Dao*.

The superior sage, by nature, is pure and tranquil,
serene and undisturbed, empty and without action,
unadulterated and unchanging, still as one—
when he hears the *Dao*, people observe his conduct,
truly believing he diligently practices it,
yet in reality, he does nothing at all.
This is what is called effortless mastery.

The mediocre sage, by nature, is moderate—
things the world does not use.
He retreats to marshes and valleys, seeking quiet and spaciousness,
exhales the old and inhales the new,
endures hardship like the bear and soars like the phoenix,
merely nurturing his body and preserving his spirit.
But when he is put to use by the world,
he speaks of great achievements,
establishes great reputation,
honors the relationships of lord and subject,
rectifies the order of high and low,
and governs affairs—
this is what is called as if it exists and as if it does not.

The inferior sage, by nature, is coarse and defiled—
his eyes crave to see colors,
his ears crave to hear sounds,
his mouth craves to savor flavors,
his intentions crave to be fulfilled.
When he hears of serene tranquility and non-action,
he laughs loudly and rejects it.
If it is not rejected and laughed at by the inferior sage,
then it is not worthy to be the true *Dao*.

Yan Junping says:
*"The quail and partridge fly high,
yet their hearts are set on the humble weeds.
The wild goose and crane take great strides,
crossing mountains and rivers,
yet their hearts are set on the marshes and pools.
The phoenix and cranes soar above the lofty peaks,
gliding through the boundless purity,
their brilliance obscuring the sun and moon,
their gaze reaching far and wide,
dwelling in the eight extremes,
thus finding their perfect place.
All three take pleasure in their own ways—
thus, the infinite source and the deep spring
are where the divine dragon returns,
while the small fish flee."*

High mountains and great mounds,
dense forests and vast ravines,
are where the wild goose and tiger delight—
yet where the fowl and dogs recoil.

Thus, to diminish sharpness and abandon clever scheming,
to return to truth and embrace simplicity,
to wander in the Great Purity,
to hold the world in contempt,
to remain untainted and unperturbed,
to let joy and anger not dwell in the heart,
to let gain and loss not linger in the mind,
to treat noble and base alike,
to embrace *virtue* and contain harmony—
these are the ideals of the Great Sage,
the true pursuits of the superior sage,
the bewilderment of the mediocre sage,
and the great laughter of the inferior sage.

Lu Xisheng says:
*"The *Dao* above form is called the *Dao*—
it transcends all forms.
The *Dao* below form is called *instrumentality*—
it conforms to all forms within.
The superior sage knows both subtlety and manifestation,
transcending all forms—
thus, when he hears the *Dao* and believes it,
he diligently practices it.
The mediocre sage is caught between subtlety and manifestation,
dwelling in the space between *Dao* and *instrumentality*—
when he hears the *Dao*, he is half-doubtful, half-convinced—
thus, it is as if it exists and as if it does not.
The inferior sage knows only manifestation and not subtlety,
stopping at mere forms—
thus, when he hears the *Dao*, he laughs loudly,
not only laughing but also rejecting it."*

The *Dao* is subtle and profound, mysterious and all-pervading,
deep beyond recognition—
if it is not rejected and laughed at by the inferior sage,
then it is not worthy to be the true essence of the *Dao*.

The following words explain:
*"Establishing"* means *"to set up"*—
the passage that follows explains the words of the three sages,
their differing perceptions, and the state of being laughed at.

*"Clarifying the *Dao* as if in darkness"*—
*"Clarifying"* means *"to meet and understand face-to-face"*—
those who awaken to the *Dao* hold their light within,
their actions and demeanor like an unlit lamp.
Thus, the mediocre sage doubts its existence or non-existence,
and the inferior sage laughs loudly at it.

*"Advancing the *Dao* seems like retreating"*—
The superior sage reaches enlightenment without effort,
much less does he advance it.
Even with sage-like achievements,
he does not take them for himself,
and in mingling with the dust and engaging with the world,
it seems as if he is retreating and failing.

*"Equalizing the *Dao* as if it were a kind"*—
*"Equalizing"* means *"level and even"*—
*"kind"* refers to uneven silk, which is discarded by weavers.
The superior sage’s heart is broad and level,
his *virtue* undivided—
yet if it is uneven like silk with flaws,
it will not be used by the world.
River Master’s version reads *"kind"*—
those who follow the Great *Dao* are broad and level,
adapting to all without distinction.

*"Highest *virtue* resembles a valley"*—
Those of highest *virtue* act without action,
their minds aligned with the void,
neither lofty nor low, beyond measure—
like a deep valley, containing all.

*"Great purity resembles defilement"*—
Great purity is like the whiteness of snow and frost,
unrestricted in its reach,
even in filthy, neglected places,
it spreads without discrimination.
Those who follow the *Dao* are surely no different—
thus, in a defiled world,
they remain purely white and untainted.

*"Vast *virtue* seems insufficient"*—
Sun Deng says:
*"If one’s *virtue* is deep and vast,
then it appears distant and neglects small details,
its wisdom seemingly lacking.
Thus, a good merchant hides his wares as if empty,
and a gentleman of great *virtue* looks foolish in appearance."*

Lu Xisheng says:
*"To clothe all under Heaven yet not claim its *virtue*—
this is vast *virtue* seeming insufficient."*

*"Establishing *virtue* resembles stealing"*—
This refers to hidden, secret *virtue*.
Those who establish hidden *virtue*
do not display their deeds,
fearing others’ knowledge—
thus, it seems like stealing.

Wu Jun’s *Treatise on the Primordial Thread* says:
*"One’s deeds should be hidden,
one’s mistakes should be obvious—
hidden deeds can be preserved,
obvious mistakes are easily corrected.*
This is what is meant.

*"True essence resembles corruption"*—
*"Corruption"* means *"change"* and *"dullness"*—
those of pure essence act without ostentation,
like uneven silk, their brilliance unexpressed.
Zhuan Yi’s *Explanation of Meaning* states:
*"Ancient texts read ‘*shū*’ (输).*
*The *Guangya* says: ‘*shū*’ means ‘*foolish*.’*
Some read ‘*yú*’ (榆).
Dong Yu reads ‘*yáo*’ (摇).
Now, following Wang Bi and Zhuan Yi’s reading, we take ‘*yú*’ (渝).*

*"The square has no corners"*—
Kaiyuan Imperial Commentary says:
*"Square"* means *"rectitude"*—
*"corners"* means *"angles"*—
those who polish their reputation and name
to establish a sharp, upright stance,
do so to create a corner of integrity.

This is what is meant by the "bounded teachings" of the common scholar—not the "great square" of the sage.

To polish without brilliance,
to dwell in filth without staining—
this is the great square.
To blend light with dust,
to walk without sharp distinction—
this is without corners.

Great vessels take long to mature;
their use is complete when their purpose is fulfilled.
River Above Master said:
The great *gān* (柑) of humanity,
like the Nine Tripods and coral waves,
is not formed in a single day.
Accumulated habits yield enduring beauty—
perfection lies in duration.

Great sound is rare in voice;
River Above Master said:
Great sound is like thunder waiting for its moment to move—
it is the *qi* of love, sparse in words.
Thunder still strikes the ears—
how much more so the profound words?

Lu Xi’s *Hixiang* said:
Through silent teaching,
stirring all things without resorting to frivolous speech—
this is great sound, rare in voice.

Great form is shapeless;
River Above Master said:
Those who embody the great *xiàng* (象) are simple and unadorned.
He who possesses great *xiàng* responds without form—
saying that great *xiàng* responds to all *xiàng* is to say it cannot be fixed by form,
hence it is shapeless.

The Dao is hidden, nameless.
The Dao originally had no name,
yet it was forcibly named *Dao*.
Now the Dao is hidden again—
what name remains?
This is truly the erasure of traces, concealment of origins.

Heaven follows the Dao—
virtue is lent and fulfilled.
*Across* (贷) means to bestow.
To praise this wondrous Dao alone—
it can move gods and spirits, emperors and deities,
generate heaven and earth.
It lends its pure, harmonious, wondrous *qi* to all things,
fulfilling their nature and returning to spontaneity.

Jun Ping said:
The Dao’s transformation begins with nothing,
ends with no end,
exists in non-existence,
lends without expectation.
In motion, it forms all things;
in stillness, the world is at ease.

Lu Xi’s *Hixiang* said:
Only those who generously bestow upon all things,
without demanding repayment,
are why all things receive their fulfillment
yet know not its virtue.
Thus, the lesser scholars hear this Dao and scoff,
doubting its power.

The superior scholar diligently practices,
establishing virtue—
the Dao generates One.

The Dao generates One,
One generates Two,
Two generates Three,
Three generates all things.

The Dao is the emptiness of emptiness,
the nothingness of nothingness—
the natural thusness.

Mysterious, boundless, supreme void,
profound silence, deep unity—
ineffable and unspeakable.

Yet when it moves, it produces transformation—
this is called *húnlún* (浑沦).
*Húnlún* is One.
*Húnlún* One—
before *qi* disperses,
there must be spirit and clarity,
latent within.

Spirit and clarity are Two.
With spirit and clarity comes division—
thus, the three *qi* of purity, turbidity, and harmony
emerge in sighs,
each returning to its place.
Hence, pure *qi* becomes Heaven,
turbid *qi* becomes Earth,
harmonious *qi* becomes Humanity.

With the Three Talents complete,
all things are nourished to life.

Jun Ping said:
The emptiness of emptiness generates the nothingness of nothingness;
the nothingness of nothingness generates the formless.
Thus, all formed things belong to their kind,
and each kind has its origin.
Heaven and Earth are the greatest of things,
with Humanity following.

When Heaven and Humanity are born,
form arises from *qi*,
*qi* from harmony,
harmony from spirit and clarity,
spirit and clarity from the Dao.
The Dao’s natural unfolding sustains all things,
so Heaven is Heaven not by itself,
Humanity is Humanity not by itself.

Gu Shenzzi said:
The Dao naturally transforms and generates spirit,
spirit moves and forms harmony,
harmony disperses and *qi* congeals,
*qi* congeals and form is made—
thus, the Dao generates One,
One generates Two,
Two generates Three,
Three generates all things.

River Above Master said:
The Dao’s first generation is One;
One generates Yin and Yang,
Yin and Yang generate the three harmonious *qi* of purity, turbidity, and harmony,
which divide into Heaven, Earth, and Humanity.
Heaven and Earth, with Humanity, generate all things.
Heaven bestows, Earth transforms,
Humanity nurtures them.

Kaiyuan Imperial Commentary said:
The Dao is the supreme spirit of ultimate emptiness.
One is the refined *qi* of pure harmony.
To generate is to move and produce.
Speaking of the Dao’s movement producing harmonious *qi* to generate things,
yet this still does not suffice for the principle of response—
further, Yang *qi* is generated,
accumulating Yang to complete One—
thus, One generates Two.
Pure Yang alone cannot generate,
so Yin *qi* is generated,
accumulating Yin to complete Two—
thus, Two generates Three.
Three generates all things—
when Yin and Yang interact harmoniously,
and the pure *qi* refines,
then myriad beings proliferate.
The three schools’ accounts differ slightly in detail;
here, all are preserved.

All things bear Yin on their backs and embrace Yang,
using harmonious *qi* as their mediator.
*Negative* (负) means to turn away;
*embrace* (抱) means to face.
Living things fear death and seek life,
plants turn from cold and toward warmth.
Their skin and texture envelop externally—
skin and texture are where Yin *qi* congeals,
hence it is said they bear Yin.
Their marrow fills internally—
marrow is where Yang *qi* gathers,
hence it is said they embrace Yang.
The充和 *chōnghé* *qi* circulates between,
thus forming the essence of life.

When harmonious *qi* is full and complete,
the essence of life is unharmed,
and vitality reigns.
When harmonious *qi* decays and scatters,
the essence of life separates,
and death ensues.

Thus, the sage empties his spiritual repository,
and pure whiteness converges.
The virtuous man stirs not his heart,
and the vast *hé* *qi* may be nurtured.
Pure whiteness and vastness are alternate names for harmonious *qi*.
Harmonious *qi* is gentle and weak,
capable of mediating Yin and Yang—
hence it is said harmonious *qi* mediates.

What humanity despises are the terms *gū* (孤), *guǎ* (寡), and *bùgǔ* (不谷),
yet kings and nobles adopt them as titles.
*Gū*, *guǎ*, and *bùgǔ* are terms of gentle weakness and humility—
what the vulgar find objectionable,
yet the sage and noble take as their own,
for this is how they attain royal nobility.

This follows the harmonious *qi* as mediator,
reducing the heart’s rigid strength
to seek benefit in virtue and the Way.

Thus, things sometimes benefit when diminished,
and are diminished when over-benefited.

There are things that can reduce emotional desires,
that do not boast of their own merits,
and that lower themselves to preserve their essence.
As when kings and nobles adopt the titles *gū* (孤), *guǎ* (寡), and *bùgǔ* (不谷),
their humility brings them greater honor and nobility.
The vulgar, however, seek only excess and fullness,
and those who greedily pursue wealth and noble status,
knowing no restraint, invite ruin and peril.
The *Shū* says: *"Fullness invites loss, humility invites benefit."*
When things are diminished by external means,
it is the Dao’s way that brings true benefit.
The Dao’s benefit comes when things are diminished by their own nature.

What humanity teaches is also what I teach.
The teachings of the world each assert their own *wǒ yì* (我义).
As with the hundred schools of thought,
each establishes its own principles—
those whose intent is good are aligned with the sage’s teachings,
while those whose intent is perverse become the arts of *zònghéng* (纵横).
The arts of *zònghéng* lead to entrapment by force and violence,
and one cannot escape their consequences.
Those who rely on force and violence cannot escape their fate—
I shall take this as my guiding principle.

Gentleness and weakness belong to Yang, the principle of life;
force and violence belong to Yin, the principle of death.
When rulers above are forceful and violent,
they lose the hearts of their people and meet downfall without delay.
When subjects below are forceful and violence,
they are overthrown by the multitude, and ruin is imminent.
To *"not escape their fate"* means to die before one’s natural end.

The Master Lao observed the world’s deviation from the Dao
and wrote these warnings for future generations,
knowing that those who practice humility and gentleness will thrive,
while those who indulge in greed and violence will perish.
Thus, he recorded these lessons to instruct posterity.
*"Father"* (父) means origin, foundation.
The principle of *chōnghé* (冲和) with its humility invites benefit,
while abandoning one’s own *wǒ yì* (我义) in favor of force and violence
leads to ruin—
hence, one must adhere to the utmost gentleness.
Therefore, I follow it with the observation:
*"The Dao’s utmost gentleness overcomes the world’s utmost firmness."*

The gentlest thing is water,
the firmest are metal and stone.
*"Driving"* (驰骋) describes its ceaseless flow,
like a swift steed racing without pause.
Water, though supremely gentle,
can penetrate metal and stone through its use,
and drown all things—
thus it is said to *"drive"* past the world’s firmest substances.
The Dao is without form or boundary,
yet it can encompass Heaven and Earth without end,
and invade the minutest hairs without omission.
How could anything with form enter its boundless void?
Zhuangzi said:
*"Metal and stone cannot sound without emptiness—*
*this refers to containing the Dao’s *qi* (气)."*
Jun Ping remarked:
*"Things with form, though sharp, do not enter the formless;
the spirit’s wisdom moves within the body,
emerging without boundary,
entering without aperture—
in the span of a breath, it traverses thousands of miles."*
Thus, I understand the benefits of *wúwéi* (无为).

*"I"* (吾) is the Master Lao’s self-reference.
The Way of emptiness and nothingness,
gentle and formless, yet penetrates all things.
Wang Bi said:
*"Nothingness cannot be exhausted,
gentleness cannot be broken—
from this, one knows the Dao of *wúwéi* (无为) benefits all."*

The teaching of silence and *wúwéi* (无为) is rarely attained.
The sage, observing the natural Dao of Heaven,
adjusts his body and simplifies his actions,
refines his bearing and conduct to enlighten others—
thus his teaching prevails without words.
If one resorts to forceful action,
it leads to stagnation and harm to things.
Yet when one returns to *wúwéi* (无为),
the benefits are manifold—
hence, the Way of quietude and simplicity
is truly the supreme guardian of the world.
Few attain it.

The *Classics* say:
*"Those who know me are rare—*
*thus I am precious."*

Wenzi said:
*"Gao Yao sighed and established the great laws,
and there was no cruelty in the world—
does governance have greater value than words?"*
Shi Kuang, though blind, became the Grand Steward,
and the state of Jin knew no disorder—
does administration have greater value than sight?

The sage’s commands are spoken without utterance,
his governance is seen without form—
this is how he becomes a teacher.

Gentleness and non-competition lie in *wúwéi* (无为).
The benefits of *wúwéi* (无为) are closest to one’s own body—
thus, I follow with: *"Which is dearer, name or body?"*

Which is dearer, name or body?
The body is substance, the name is guest—
to abandon substance for guest is called inversion.
The *Liézǐ* says:
*"Substance is poor, falsehood is rich;
to say substance has no name while name has no substance—
this is falsehood indeed.
Yet those who chase fame relentlessly—
can fame truly be abandoned?
Can fame truly be treated as a guest?"*

Now, having a name brings honor,
losing it brings disgrace.
Honor brings ease and pleasure,
disgrace brings sorrow and suffering.
Sorrow and suffering harm one’s nature,
ease and pleasure align with it—
this is where the matter lies.
How can fame be abandoned?
How can it be treated as a guest?
Only to fear those who cling to fame,
burdening their substance,
and neglect the peril of ruin—
is this not more than the difference between ease and suffering?

Bao Jiao extends this reasoning:
Those who cling to fame and burden substance.

Which is more: body or wealth?
Wealth refers to resources and possessions.
All who dwell in riches and delight in their means of support
are yet to find one who does not covet wealth.
The rich toil endlessly, day and night,
amassing treasure yet unable to enjoy it fully—
their bodies are but external forms.
The noble fret through the night and day,
pondering whether their actions are good or bad—
their bodies are but distant shadows.
Though their halls be filled with gold and jade,
if they lack virtue and benevolence,
they earn only the mockery of thieves and the scorn of those who hoard wealth—
and when their families fall and their bodies are shamed,
what greater loss is there?

To gain or to lose—
which brings greater harm?
False fame and fleeting profit
are as light as a feather,
while the loss of life, body, spirit, and nature
is as heavy as a great mountain.
A discerning person weighs which is the greater affliction.

Zhuangzi said:
*"To nourish one’s will is to forget the body;
to nourish the body is to forget profit;
to attain the Dao is to lose the heart—*
*it is gone."*

Thus, excessive love brings great depletion,
and excessive hoarding invites heavy loss.
*"Depletion"* (费) means harm.

Hoarding wealth brings ruin,
for greed and avarice lead only to self-destruction—
how could such folly be called light?

The contented know no disgrace,
the restrained face no peril.
Thus may one endure.

*"Peril"* (殆) means ruin.

The contented do not covet riches.
Without coveting riches,
they escape the calamities of shame and slaughter.

Zhuangzi recounts how Confucius spoke to Yan Hui:
*"Your home is poor, your station low—
why do you not seek office?"*
Yan Hui replied:
*"I have no wish to serve."*

He had fifty *mu* of fields outside the city walls,
enough for rice gruel,
and ten *mu* within,
sufficient for silk and hemp.
Playing the *qin* brought him joy,
and what he learned from the Master
filled him with delight.
Thus Yan Hui had no wish to serve.

Confucius grew solemn, his expression changing.
*"Ah, well said!
I have long heard that the contented
do not burden themselves with profit.
Those who find true self-sufficiency
lose nothing and fear no loss,
while those who cultivate virtue within
act without needing rank.
Now I see this in you—
this is my gain."*

The restrained do not covet fame or station.
Without coveting fame or station,
they know no fear of ruin or peril.

Zhuangzi said:
Yuan Xian lived in Lu,
in a hut of sun-dried bricks,
its thatched roof patched with wild grass,
its doors of woven reeds,
its windows framed with mulberry branches.
Within, two rooms were partitioned with coarse hemp,
leaking above, damp below—
yet he sat upright, plucking his strings.

Zigong arrived in a grand carriage,
drawn by fine horses, draped in white silk,
so wide the streets could not contain it.
He went to visit Yuan Xian,
who wore a fine cap and loose sandals,
leaning on a staff of black bamboo at the door.

Zigong exclaimed:
*"Ah, Master, what ails you?"*
Yuan Xian replied:
*"Poverty is lack of wealth.
Illness is knowing but not practicing.
I am poor, not sick."*

Zigong hung his head, ashamed.
Yuan Xian laughed:
*"To conform to the world’s ways,
to flatter and fawn in friendship,
to study for others’ gain,
to teach for self-aggrandizement—
these are the corruptions of *ren* and *yi*,
like gilding a horse’s trappings.
I cannot bear them.
But the truly contented and restrained
need fear no disgrace, no peril—
they endure."*

To cherish the self is to know contentment;
to distance oneself from fame is to avoid disgrace.
Contentment without disgrace—
the Dao is complete, like a broken vessel.
Thus, the greatest completion resembles a flaw.

A vessel with a flaw is never exhausted in use.
*"Flaw"* (缺) means broken;
*"exhausted"* (敝) means ruin, decay.
The truly accomplished—those of full virtue—
though their forms may seem incomplete,
are like vessels with flaws:
rarely discarded, their use never fails.
Thus they preserve their wholeness,
free from ruin or decay.

Again, like the great abyss:
draw from it, yet it is never emptied;
like a bright mirror:
reflect all things, yet never obscured.
Thus its use is never exhausted.

Great fullness seems empty,
yet its use knows no end.
*"Empty"* (冲) means humble, unassuming.
Those of vast virtue and achievement
are modest, not proud;
the wealthy in modest dwellings
are frugal, not extravagant.
Their abundance overflows—
how could they ever be wanting?

Great straightness seems bent,
for true straightness follows things as they are.
It bears grime without complaint,
its rectitude not its own—
thus it seems bent.

Great skill seems clumsy,
for true skill follows nature’s course,
crafting nothing unnatural—
thus it seems clumsy.

*The Liezi* tells of a man from Song
who carved jade into mulberry leaves,
taking three years to perfect them,
so seamless they blended with the real—
and thus he fed his skill to Song.
Liezi heard of this and said:
*"If Heaven and Earth took three years
to grow a single leaf,
then few things would bear leaves at all."*
Thus the Sage relies on the Dao’s transformation,
not on clever artifice.

The Dao’s transformation—
this is true skill:
following things as they are,
not boasting of one’s own power—
thus it seems clumsy.

Great eloquence seems tongue-tied,
for true eloquence knows no bounds.
It speaks as things demand,
without obstruction.
If one relies only on one’s own words,
some truths may elude it.
Thus it speaks no forbidden laws,
no unseemly words—
doing nothing forced,
it seems tongue-tied.

Vigor conquers cold,
stillness conquers heat.

*"Vigor"* (躁) means movement.
Spring and summer, the yang qi rises from the earth,
and all things thrive.
But extremes invert—
at the summer solstice, a single shade of yin appears within.
When movement reaches its peak, cold follows,
and all things wither.
Thus vigor is the root of decay,
excess the origin of decline—
a warning that perfection without flaw must fail,
that fullness without emptiness must topple,
that rigid vigor must perish.

Jun Ping said:
*"The movements of Heaven and Earth—
advance and retreat—
give rise to all things.
Change is inevitable, unblocked;
flexibility is inevitable, unobstructed.
Thus when yin reaches its height,
the earth splits, ice forms,
howling winds rage, frost descends like rocks,
turtles and tortoises retreat,
all things curl into balls.
At such times,
though you dwell in heated chambers,
stand by blazing fires,
wear thick fox and badger furs,
and wrap in fine wool,
you cannot ward off the cold.
But when the mind is still,
the body at ease,
when vitality drains and filth flows—
casting aside your clothes,
stepping outside—
you find warmth beyond measure."*

Stillness conquers heat,
for in autumn and winter, the yang qi rests beneath the cold depths.
What is rejected gives rise to what is affirmed—
at the winter solstice, a single shade of yang appears within.
Heat then brings forth the harmonious qi,
and all things are born from it.
Life arises from stillness—
thus stillness is both the root of life and its opposite, vigor.

Jun Ping said:
*"When yang reaches its height,
sand is boiled, stones melt,
birds fall from the sky,
water creatures writhe in agony,
all things wither and dry,
rivers and streams run low.
At such times,
though you plunge into deep, cold springs,
wear thin, loose robes,
soar on high towers,
consume icy stones—
you cannot endure the heat."*

When the mind is released and the will set free,
when the spirit rests in pristine stillness,
the body transcends the four seas’ bounds,
while the will roams where nothingness resides—
then the heart is balanced, the qi harmonious,
and cold is cast aside from the body’s core.

This speaks of vigor as the root of death,
stillness as the foundation of life—
to illustrate the sovereign’s path.

Vigor and strength repel foes,
adorn falsehood, and provoke the nature of things,
leading to the ruin of family and state—
this is called **vigorous strength**,
which brings only stillness and cold decay.
Cold decay brings decline and extinction.

Yet **stillness in harmony**—
with effortless governance, preserving all things’ truth—
brings enduring peace to the realm—
this is called **stillness in harmony**,
which brings warmth and human accord,
and human accord brings prosperity.

Purity and stillness are the right way for all under Heaven.
This concludes the meaning of what came before.

The most refined clarity lies within the turbid,
yet nothing can obscure it.
The most profound stillness dwells amid motion,
yet no affair can disrupt it.

Moreover, the **Great Completion, Great Fullness, Great Rectitude, Great Skill, Great Binding**—
these have their counterparts:
**not exhausted, not depleted,**
**as if bent, as if lacking, as if hesitant**—
yet only **clarity and stillness**
can uphold all things
and stand as the central balance for all under Heaven.

Zhuangzi said:
*"Hold the spirit in stillness, and the form will align itself.
Be still, be clear—
do not weary your body,
do not agitate your essence—
then you may attain longevity."*

When the outer is deficient yet the inner is whole,
this is called **the Way**.
Thus, it is followed by: *"All under Heaven has the Way."*

**End of *Dao De Jing: Hidden Chamber, Revered Subtlety*, Scroll Six**
**Begin *Dao De Jing: Hidden Chamber, Compiled Subtlety*, Scroll Seven**

**Begin *Dao De Jing: Hidden Chamber, Compiled Subtlety*, Scroll Seven**

The **Biqiuzi** Chen Jingyuan compiled:

**The Virtue Classic (De Jing):**
When the Dao prevails under Heaven,
warhorses are driven out to till the fields.

*However*, **屏去 (bǐng qù)** means to set aside.
*And* **治田 (zhì tián)** means to cultivate the land.

When the Dao prevails under Heaven,
this speaks of a time of **Great Peace (shí tài)**.
In times of Great Peace, the people flourish,
and ancestral temples shine in splendor.
The realm is at ease,
and feudal lords come as honored guests.
The seas grow tranquil,
and arms rest in repose.
All turn to the roots of life,
with every household striving in agriculture and sericulture.
Thus, warhorses—**the martial prowess (wǔ gōng)**—
are set aside,
and the people return to **the common arts (cháng yè)**.

Hence, the **Heavenly Heart (Tiān Xīn)** is harmonious and content,
and all things rejoice in their natural state.

When the Dao does not prevail under Heaven,
warhorses breed in the **交 (jiāo) [borderlands]**.
*Here*, **交 (jiāo)** refers to the frontier between two states.

When the Dao does not prevail under Heaven,
this speaks of a time of **Great Disorder (shí fǒu)**.
In times of Great Disorder, official duties are neglected,
and the sovereign grows anxious.
The treasuries are drained,
and floods and droughts plague the land.
Counties and districts fall to bandits,
and the strong oppress the weak.
All lose their means of livelihood,
and the custom of war takes hold.
Naturally, the **戎骇 (róng hài) [battle]**-horses breed in the borderlands,
thus **阴阳 (yīn yáng) [the cosmic forces]** are severed and blocked,
and all living things mourn in sorrow.

No crime is greater than **可欲 (kě yù)**.
If a man has **可尚 (kě shàng) [worthy of reverence]**, **欲爱 (yù ài) [desires to love]**, and **之心 (zhī xīn) [heart]**
that crave what is **非理 (fēi lǐ) [unreasonable]**, then his **贪求 (tān qiú) [greed and grasping]**
will be like **火驰 (huǒ chí) [wildfire]**, unstoppable and unreturning.
Thus, he who pursues the **秋毫 (qiū háo) [finest hair]**
loses the **太山 (Tài Shān) [great mountain]**.
He who indulges in **侨奢 (qiáo shē) [excessive desires]**
must bear the **校之凶 (jiào zhī xiōng) [punishment of calamity]**.

For the cause of crime, nothing is heavier than this.

*The Liezi* says: A man from Qi desired gold. At dawn, he dressed formally and went to the market, arriving at the place where gold was sold. There, he seized the gold and fled. The sheriff captured him and asked, *"All were present—why did you seize another’s gold?"* He replied, *"When I took the gold, I saw no one—only the gold. Like gazing into murky water and losing oneself in a clear pool."* No greater calamity exists than **unknowing contentment**.

Calamity—harm. Among the things one may desire, even within greed, there are limits. But the unknowingly contented—whatever passes before their eyes, they take nothing, yet their cup overflows without spilling. Ruin and disaster follow, so no calamity surpasses **unknowing contentment**.

No greater misfortune exists than **desiring to possess**. Misfortune—ruin. Even the things that pass before one’s eyes have bounds. If one desires all under heaven—seen and unseen—and seeks to hoard them all, leaving none untaken, this is the height of **without-Dao**. How could ruin not befall oneself alone? It also brings ruin to future generations.

Crime speaks of transgressing prohibitions. The first offense is called *guilt*; the Daoists call it *overt*. The Classics say: *"The first offense is guilt, also called error."* Error—mistake. To commit error a thousand eight hundred times brings *calamity*, heavier than guilt. To commit error two thousand one hundred sixty times brings *misfortune*, heavier still than calamity. These three are all deeds of **without-Dao**. The small harms the body; the great destroys the state. How could one not take warning?

Thus, **knowing contentment’s contentment** is always contentment. Though external things may suffice, if the heart does not know contentment, this is called **unknowing contentment**. Though external things may lack, if the heart remains content, this is called **knowing contentment**.

*The High Sage’s Transmission* says: The strict **Yán Jūn Píng** was friendly with the wealthy man **Luō Chōng** of Shu Commandery. Hearing that Jūn Píng declined an official summons, Chōng asked, *"Why do you not seek office?"* Jūn Píng replied, *"I lack the will to rise."* Chōng then prepared carriages, horses, provisions, and attendants. Jūn Píng said, *"I am ill—it is not lack."* *"I have abundance, yet you have not even a single coin—how can you say you have excess?"* Chōng retorted. Jūn Píng said, *"I once lodged in your home. When others slept, your servants labored without rest, day and night, ceaselessly—never content. Now I earn by divination; money comes without effort, and I have tens of thousands in surplus, piled high. I do not know what to do with it. How can you say I have excess while you lack?"*

Chōng withdrew, deceiving himself: *"He who enriches me diminishes my spirit; he who gives me fame destroys my life. If one truly knows contentment’s contentment, how could **battle-horses breed in the borderlands**, or calamity and misfortune be so heavy?"*

The Dao is nowhere absent—why seek it far? Thus, it follows: *"Do not leave the door, and you know the world."* Not leaving the door, one knows the world. The sage’s governance begins with self and heart, measuring near before reaching far. Without descending from the ancestral hall, one knows beyond the four seas. By observing things, one recognizes things; by knowing people, one understands people. When eating, think of the world’s hunger; when clothing, think of the world’s cold. Loving one’s elders reveals the world’s aged; pitying one’s children reveals the world’s young. If such, why leave the door to know the world?

*"Without peering through the window, one sees the Dao of Heaven."* A man’s seven-foot frame—four limbs, nine orifices, five viscera, six palaces—all contained within. Thus, the original *qi* of the body communicates with the Dao of Heaven. If the ruler preserves form in stillness, the Heavenly *qi* ascends bright and self-corrects. If the ruler indulges in excess desires, the Heavenly *qi* grows dim and turbid. The ruler, sharing virtue with the Two Forces, aligns with the sun and moon in clarity. Leading Heaven, Heaven does not resist; following Heaven, one honors its timing. Without peering through windows or gazing afar, the Dao of Heaven is self-evident.

Yán Jūn Píng said: Thus, the sage does not leave the door. Above, he examines parents; below, he measures descendants. Danger, security, profit, and harm return to himself, so he is clear on the sayings of death and life, discerning in right and wrong, comprehending the roots of profit and harm, reaching the foundation of order and chaos. Knowing oneself, one knows the family; knowing the family, one knows others. Affairs grasp their principles; things follow their order. In motion, one knows where to go; in stillness, one knows what to guard. Virtue and power are father; spirit and clarity are mother; stillness and purity are teacher; Great Harmony is friend. The world is home; all things are body. View others as oneself; view oneself as others. The heart dares not stir; the will dares not rise. Abandoning old knowledge, extinguishing the three and five, one does not dwell in cliffs or caves, does not slaughter living things, does not eat raw plants, does not wear unripe fruits, does not pluck before maturity. Heaven, Earth, and all things each preserve their own. This is called, within the unity of the body, modeling Heaven, Earth, and all things.

The farther one goes, the less one knows. The ruler who loses the Dao cannot model Heaven or walk the Way, yet relies on cleverness to discern things. The farther he seeks, the less he knows. Jūn Píng said: *"Examining Heaven and Earth, verifying past and present, actions never contradict—thus I know the Dao of Heaven is complete within me."* The family is the root of knowing people. The body is the source of knowing Heaven and Earth. To observe the world without the body is to observe people without the family. Near is small, far is great; small knowledge leads to great confusion. Leaving the family and the door, one does not see the world. Leaving the body to peer through windows, one does not know the Dao of Heaven. The farther one goes, the less one knows. Wandering the four seas, one is ever more confused. The more one seeks, the greater the pursuit; the greater the pursuit, the smaller the achievement. Without seeing or hearing, seek within oneself. At the juncture of Heaven and man, the Great Dao is complete.

To govern the realm, first govern one’s own country; to govern one’s country, first govern one’s family; to govern one’s family, first govern one’s self; to govern one’s self, first cultivate one’s heart; to cultivate one’s heart, first rectify one’s intentions.

Thus, the virtuous person, if not sincere, will see all things turn against them—this refers to the body and the heart. Therefore, the Sage acts without movement yet knows, does not see yet names.

The Sage, though not traversing the world, yet discerns human affairs by observing the self within the self and knowing the outer through the inner—this is called *solitary enlightenment*.

The Sage, though not witnessing celestial omens, yet can name and command the Dao of Heaven by examining the small to comprehend the great, clarifying the near to illuminate the far—this is called *mysterious contemplation*.

The Sage achieves without action. The Sage transforms the world without contrivance, merely illuminating the natural inclinations of things and following their course.

Confucius said: *"He who governs without action—is he not Shun?"*

To learn is to grow daily, yet the Dao is diminished daily. The Dao grows through learning, but once grown, it must be diminished; knowing the child yet guarding the mother, returning to the origin—this is the root.

Returning to the origin, one must first discard cleverness and grasp the essential. Clinging to the vital and holding fast to the root, the Dao is diminished daily—this is entering the realm of boundless mystery.

Diminish again and again, until one reaches *non-action*. When one acts without contrivance, there is nothing that cannot be achieved.

The one who diminishes does not force gain nor discard what is extraneous. When one discards until one forgets what is wrong, then there is nothing minute that is not removed. When one removes until one forgets what is right, wrong is not wrong, and right is not right.

Having diminished what is wrong and what is right, it is said: *"Diminish again and again."* If both right and wrong are forgotten, self-interest naturally vanishes, and nature aligns with the Dao, reaching *non-action*. Once in *non-action*, one does not compete with things, but lets all things follow their own course. Thus, all things are achieved without contrivance.

To take the world, one must act with *non-interference*. When there are affairs to attend, it is insufficient to take the world. The Sage and the virtuous follow the Dao: first cultivating the self and the heart, then extending to the world.

Earlier, it was said to govern the self through *non-action*; now it is said to govern the world through *non-interference*. Thus, the Sage’s way of thinking is always concerned with one thing’s loss of place, and the key to rectifying flaws and chaos lies in taking the hearts of all under Heaven.

To take the hearts of all under Heaven, one must use *non-interference* as defense, *non-action* as guidance, and *non-desire* as treasure. When the people naturally transform into simplicity and tranquility, they willingly embrace and do not tire of it.

If one governs through contrivance and interference, the people will labor under burdensome rule, stand in dread, and criticize in secret. How can one then take the hearts of all under Heaven?

Once growth leads to diminishment, and diminishment reaches *non-heart*, it is said: *"The Sage has no fixed heart."* The Sage takes the hearts of the people as their own.

The Sage embodies the Dao with an empty heart; things respond to their own nature, and since responses are not uniform, the Sage’s heart remains without fixed inclination.

Yet the hearts of the people always desire to secure their lives and fulfill their nature. The Sage who lets all people attain what they desire—is he not the one who takes the hearts of the people as their own?

Zhuangzi said: *"The Perfect One’s use of heart is like a balance scale—neither pushing nor pulling, responding without storing. Thus, they can overcome things without harming themselves."* The Sage has no fixed heart.

To those who are good, I am good to them; to those who are not good, I am also good to them—*virtue* is goodness.

The people have a natural inclination toward goodness. The Sage does not contradict their nature, responding with goodness. Those whose nature is inherently good, the Sage further aids with greater goodness, ensuring their goodness is perfected.

If there are those whose nature is not good, the Sage still treats them with goodness. Under the influence of the Sage’s *virtue*, their hearts naturally shift toward goodness.

Thus, there are none in the world who are not good—this is the Sage’s way of harmonizing with natural inclinations to complete transformation, not forcing things to conform to themselves.

To those who are trustworthy, I trust them; to those who are not, I also trust them—*virtue* is trust.

The people have a natural sincerity toward trustworthiness. The Sage does not suppress their resolve, responding with trust. Those whose trust is firm, the Sage aids with greater trust, ensuring their trust is perfected.

If there are those who are not sincere in their trust, the Sage still treats them with trust. The untrustworthy, influenced by the Sage’s *virtue*, naturally awaken their sincerity into trust.

Thus, there are none in the world who are not trustworthy—this is the Sage’s ability to accommodate human nature, not out of love or self-interest.

The Sage moves through the world with *solemn vigilance*, regulating the hearts of all under Heaven.

*Solemn vigilance* is the appearance of concern and movement, yet never ceasing. *Undivided* means without distinction.

In ancient times, rulers in the world, though their governance appeared concerned and active, shared in the people’s affairs, yet their hearts remained serene and empty, aligned with nature. Thus, they could embody transformation, harmonize change, and reach nothing that could not be achieved. They balanced all things as one, and nothing was left untransformed.

For the people of the world, the Sage makes their hearts undivided and their desires unified, follows their nature to harmonize their transformation—who would not willingly embrace this?

To labor over the mind and exhaust thought, treating affairs as affairs, is to achieve something. Lu Xi-sheng said: *"When the Sage is present, the world is in awe. Responding to things and their influences, they never cease, yet their heart is undivided, in harmony with all under Heaven. They never have their own agenda."*

Thus, the four things that Master Zhongni renounced were: *no intentions*, *no absolutes*, *no rigidity*, *no self*.

Therefore, they could achieve *no may or may not* and *no action or inaction*.

The *Riverbank Master*’s text reads: *"chùchù"* (怵怵).

The *King Pi* version reads: *"xīxī"* (歙歙).

The common people all pour their ears and eyes into [worldly] affairs, while the Sage treats them as children.

*"Zhù"* (注) means to pour forth, to apply.
The Sage cultivates with *wuwei* as virtue, never opposing the natural inclinations of all things. Thus, the people are bathed in their sacred virtue, each fulfilling their inherent capacities.

The wise are made to scorn, the perceptive to listen—all pour their ears and eyes into imitating the Sage’s natural Way. Yet the Sage, his crown flowing loose, his gaze distant, his ears blocked, does not strain his body with cleverness nor probe the hidden in things. He cradles the common folk in his thoughts, treating them all as infants—thus it is said: *"to treat them as children."*

Without fixed intentions, one is undivided. Responding to transformations as a child does, one obscures life and death—hence the next stage: *birth and death*.

**Birth and Death:**
From emptiness arises natural spontaneity; from spontaneity arises the Dao; from the Dao arises *yī qì*—one breath, which transforms and gives rise to all things. Thus it is called *birth*.
At the peak of life, transformation renders it formless—thus it is called *entering death*.
This is yet confined within the realm of beginning and end.

To transcend this realm, how could life and death ever bind one?

There are thirteen categories of those who cling to life, and thirteen of those who court death.
*"Tú"* (徒) means kind, type.

Those who cling to life: those who practice *shèshēng* (摄生) fall into this category.
Those who court death: those who rush toward death fall into this category.
The thirteen: as Han Fei said: four limbs, nine orifices—thirteen in total, their movement and stillness all tied to life and death.

Now, the adept at *shèshēng* does not wastefully gaze, does not wastefully listen, does not wastefully smell, does not wastefully speak, does not wastefully grasp, does not wastefully tread—his movements and stillness are effortless, committing no evil. These are the ranks of those who seek longevity.

Those who court death, however, let their eyes wander over garish colors, their ears indulge in wanton sounds, their noses grow weary of foul odors, their mouths crave what is unrighteous, their hands favor wicked tools, their feet quicken on forbidden paths. Their movements and stillness are drowned in vice, with no virtue remaining—these are the ranks of those near death.

The roots of life and death all hinge on these thirteen matters.

Sun Deng said: Among the things of Heaven and Earth, those that align with nature are few, while those that defy it are many. Thus, in ten cases, only three follow nature.

Now, life not lived in accordance with the Dao, death not met with reason—those who follow life are few, while those who defy death are many. Hence, in death, only three submit to fate.

Some interpret this as: the threefold business of ten evils—those who master and subdue them belong to the ranks of longevity. Those who indulge belong to the ranks of near-death.

By reasoning through it, the nine orifices and four limbs are the most thoroughly discussed.
Human life is a descent into death’s domain through these thirteen matters.

Now, why is it that people’s ordinary actions lead them toward death’s domain?
It is because they are seduced by desire for gain.
They crave rich flavors, fine silks, beautiful colors, pleasing sounds—all to indulge the nine orifices and four limbs. Thus their movements are strained, as if compelled against their will, yet they fall into death’s domain without knowing it. None escape the thirteen matters.

Why is this?
Because those who advance life excessively do so at the expense of their own substance.
*"Shēngshēng"* (生生) means to further life.
To forget life’s weight upon oneself is to hope for longevity, while to advance life at one’s own expense is to draw near death’s domain.

Moreover, to advance life must first rely on external things. Though external things suffice to preserve the body and delight the nature, serving as means for prolonged life, yet those who forget themselves in their greed for wealth overreach in seeking life-preserving things, letting the thirteen matters slide into chaos and hastening themselves toward death’s domain.

It is said that the adept at *shèshēng* does not speak of *shèshēng*—*"swēi wén"* (盖闻) is a humble phrase.
*"Shè"* means to guard. Within guarding life, they grasp its subtleties, hence the adept at *shèshēng*.
Traveling on foot, they avoid rhinoceros and tigers; entering battle, they wear no armor.
The rhinoceros has no place to strike with its horn, the tiger no place to strike with its claws, weapons no place to lodge their blades.
They meet without design.

「The rhinoceros emerges from the southern banks of the Xiang River, its hue a deep azure-black, its form resembling a wild ox, with a single horn weighing a thousand *jīn* [~220 lbs].

The adept at *shèshēng* [guarding life] attains internally to the self, so all illnesses fail to arise. Externally, they harmonize with things, so all calamities cannot befall them. When they abandon all selfish gain, they naturally meet with fortune.

Of all the harms that tools bring, none surpass the sword and spear. Among beasts, none are fiercer than the tiger and rhinoceros. Thus, though the sword and spear stand before them, they are not alarmed—this is because there is no place for their blades to lodge. Though tiger and rhinoceros block their path, they are not startled—this is because there is no place for their claws and horns to strike. Hence, though all calamities assail the sentient, they cannot harm the unsentient.

Why is this? Asking why all calamities do not assail and spare the adept at *shèshēng* [guarding life]—it is because they have no place of death.

The supreme person does not indulge their inner desires, nor do they harbor outward harm toward things. Thus, they can forget the self while the self remains, for they have no place of death.

Zhuangzi said: Those who grasp the Dao/Way must reach *lǐ* [principle/reason], those who reach principle must discern *quán* [opportunity/strategic measure], and those who discern opportunity will not let external things harm them. The virtuous/powerful ones are not scorched by fire, drowned by water, harmed by cold or heat, or preyed upon by birds and beasts—not because they are callous, but because they perceive danger and safety, rest in calamity and blessing, and are cautious in departure and approach. None can harm them.

To die is to lose the Dao/Way; to awaken is for the Dao/Way to arise. Thus, it follows with *dào shēng zhī* [the Dao/Way giving birth to it].

The Dao/Way gives birth to it, and virtue/power nurtures it. The Dao/Way is the essence of emptiness. Virtue/power is the function of nature. The Dao/Way’s essence is emptiness, yet through movement it gives rise to things. All things receive *qi* from the Dao/Way, hence it is said to give birth to them.

Virtue/power’s function is natural, encompassing and nurturing things. Things take form from virtue/power, hence it is said to nurture them.

Things are shaped by their form, and their fate is completed by their circumstances. All creatures and plants are rooted in the Dao/Way and born, sustained by virtue/power, and when their material is fully formed, they take shape, hence it is said to shape them.

Once things have taken form, they follow the changes of the four seasons to reach completion. Thus, all things cannot but revere the Dao/Way and honor virtue/power.

The Dao/Way descends as pure essence, giving birth to the nature of things. Virtue/power contains harmonious *qi*, nurturing the form of things. Hence, all things revere and honor the Dao/Way as if it were their father, and virtue/power as if it were their mother.

The reverence of the Dao/Way and the honor of virtue/power—none can confer rank upon them, yet they are always naturally present. Rank is the bestowal of command. The example of this is the titles of duke, marquis, earl, viscount, and baron.

The reason the world holds things in reverence and honor is because the sovereigns bestow rank and command upon them. Yet the Dao/Way, with its pure essence, gives birth to things, and all things naturally revere it like a father. Virtue/power, with its harmonious *qi*, nurtures things, and all things naturally honor it like a mother.

All things universally receive the Dao/Way’s and virtue/power’s nurturing and completing functions, revering and honoring them as if they were parents—not because of conferred rank, but because they are always naturally present and have the power to guard and subdue.

Thus, the Dao/Way gives birth to it, nurtures it, lengthens it, educates it, completes it, ripens it, sustains it, and protects it. Earlier, it spoke of the Dao/Way giving birth and virtue/power nurturing, but here it does not mention virtue/power, for the Dao/Way permeates all without omission.

To receive its essence is to be born, to contain its *qi* is to nurture, to fulfill its form is to lengthen, to refine its nature is to educate, to aid its function is to complete, to bring it to its end is to ripen, to preserve its harmony is to sustain, and to guard its injuries is to protect. These eight are the fundamental functions of the Great Dao/Way. Even the most minute of creatures—those that dart and creep—cannot escape its reverence and honor.

Born yet not possessed, acting yet not relying, lengthening yet not ruling—this is called *Xuán Dé* [Mysterious Virtue/Power]. This concludes the eight meanings above.

If the Dao/Way were said to give birth to all things as if it had possession, then its benevolence would be diminished. If it were said to nurture all things as if relying on its actions, then it would claim its function. If it were said to lengthen and educate all things, completing and ripening all types, sustaining and protecting all creatures and plants, as if it were proud of its rule—then it would be seen as presuming its length. With these attributes yet remaining hidden in secrecy, one can say its mysterious virtue/power is profound and distant.

The Dao/Way gives birth and virtue/power nurtures, providing things with their beginning. Thus, it follows with *tiānxià yǒu shǐ* [the world having a beginning].

The world having a beginning, the Dao/Way is the mother of the world. Once one has obtained its mother, one knows its child. The beginning is the Dao/Way, the root, the nameless.

The mother is nurturing, the named. The Dao/Way externally encompasses Heaven and Earth, internally fills the cosmos. All things draw upon it to be born and follow it to reach completion. That which completes is the child, that which gives birth is the mother.

The child is the One, and the One is the *chōngqì* [primordial breath], the Dao/Way’s child. The Dao/Way is the body of true essence, and the One is the function of wondrous things. Once the Dao/Way’s body is obtained, one knows the wondrous function. Body and function are interdependent, merging in the ultimate emptiness.

Having known the child, one again guards the mother. Thus, throughout life, one is unharmed. Having known the wondrous function of things, one again guards the true essence of the Dao/Way. Body and function become indistinguishably one, responding to stimuli without end, and only then can one act without doing and achieve all without action—thus, throughout life, one is unharmed.

Close its *duì* [joyous/pleasure], shut its gates—then one will labor not a day in their life. This illustrates the practice of cutting off desire and guarding the mother.

*Duì* means delight. It refers to the ears and eyes delighting in sounds and colors, the nose and mouth delighting in scents and flavors. The six senses each have their delights, and gates signify the paths of entry and exit.

The ears, eyes, and all the senses are the means by which dust and defilements enter. If one seals the gates of love and delight, then misfortune ceases and the body does not toil.

Again, *duì* is the eyes. If one closes the insatiable gaze, then all scenes will be cut off. Gates are the rivers. If one stops the mouth that speaks excessively, then all calamities will not approach.

When all scenes are cut off, the source of desires is sealed. When all calamities cease, the path to action is closed. Thus, one will be tranquil and at ease, laboring not a day in their life.

Open its *duì* [joyous/pleasure], and its affairs will flourish—yet one’s life will never be saved. If one does not guard the mother Dao/Way, opening the source of love and delight without sealing it, then the emotions of desire will grow ever longer.»

If the path of calamities is left open and not closed, then the affairs of misfortune will flourish. Thus, one will face sorrow, suffering, peril, and death, and never be saved.

To perceive the small is called clarity; to uphold softness is called strength. This is called preventing before sprouting, governing before chaos arises.

When calamities and chaos have not yet appeared, they are small—yet clearly visible, that is clarity. If one knows the arts of sealing *duì* and closing the gates, then one sees the subtle and minute.

Dulling the sharpness of desires and dissolving the turmoil of calamities—this is upholding softness and weakness. To uphold softness and weakness means that things cannot overpower one; this is called strength. To see the subtle and minute means that affairs cannot become obscured; this is called clarity.

Employ its luminosity, and return to its clarity. Luminosity is the illumination of wisdom. Wisdom arises externally, externally shines, and is ever in motion—motion is the function of things. Clarity is insightful understanding. Insight dwells internally, internally reflects, and remains ever still—stillness is one’s true nature. When wisdom shines outward, it responds to affairs; when it returns, it aligns with principle. Thus, function returns to essence, and it is said: *return to its clarity*.

This is a further elucidation of perceiving the small and upholding softness, causing the external to cease and the internal to return. To leave no harm to the self is called *clinging to the constant*.

*Heru* (遗) means to bestow or to leave behind. If affairs and principle are both clear, essence and function merge in obscurity, and one does not enslave wisdom’s external illumination while guarding insight’s internal reflection—returning desires before they sprout and restoring them to the primal Mother Dao—then there will be no self-inflicted harm, and this is called *secretly employing the constant Dao*.

To have a beginning and an end, to know the Child while guarding the Mother, to seal and close love and delight—is this not the upright and discerning? Thus, it follows with: *If one makes the upright and discerning have knowledge*.

If the upright and discerning have knowledge, walking the Great Dao, only their actions are to be feared. *Jie* (介) means solitary, upright, and resolute. Alas, if in this age one does not follow the ancient Dao, then it is said: *If one makes the solitary and resolute scholar have knowledge of governance, then they will walk the Great Dao*.

The Great Dao is the Way of effortless clarity, utmost fairness, and utmost straightforwardness. Yet those who walk the Dao must have actions. If actions are simple and easy, they guide the people toward the realm of clarity. If actions are convoluted and vexing, they lead the people toward greed and filth.

Only actions are to be feared—feared that they do not conform to the ancient Dao. The Great Dao is exceedingly smooth, yet people love shortcuts. The Great Dao is exceedingly smooth, like a grand thoroughfare. A grand thoroughfare is level and easy, reaching everywhere without obstruction, for its vast straightness does not fear minor detours. Yet people desire speed, seeking shortcuts, and thus become entangled in rugged paths, lost and confused, never reaching their destination.

Therefore, the Ancient Sage lamented this, cautioning only the methods of instruction, making them feared, and guiding the people along the broad path—referring to the following passage.

The palace halls are excessively cleared,
The fields are overgrown with weeds,
The granaries are empty,
Yet adornments are worn,
Fine silks and embroidered patterns are displayed,
Sharp swords are carried,
Beasts are fed sumptuous foods,
And wealth and goods abound.

Han Fei commented: *"Resource and goods are in excess."*

Enter a land, and its governance and teachings become apparent.

Observe the palace halls meticulously maintained, the walls and halls elaborately carved and towering—then one knows the sovereign delights in grand construction and indulges in frivolous pleasures. Observe the fields overgrown with weeds, agriculture neglected—then one knows the sovereign relishes forced labor, seizing the people’s time. Observe the granaries empty, farmers starving—then one knows the sovereign favors frivolous pursuits while abandoning essential livelihoods. Observe garments adorned with excessive embroidery, substance abandoned for superficial ornamentation—then one knows the sovereign indulges in licentious craftsmanship and exploits female labor. Observe belts adorned with sharp swords, valorized strength and martial competition—then one knows the sovereign cherishes martial prowess while neglecting governance. Observe feasts rejecting plain fare, savoring rich meats and fresh kills—then one knows the sovereign revels in gluttony and forgets state affairs. Observe wealth and goods in surplus, hoarding rare treasures—then one knows the sovereign amasses riches, impoverishing the people.

Confucius said: *"If the people lack, how can the sovereign suffice?"*
If plunder continues unchecked, the people’s strength will be exhausted—this is not the Dao of the Sage.
This is called *robberious boasting*, not the Way.

The seven misdeeds above all rely on deceitful expansion, seizing the people covertly without principle—thus, they are theft. Already thieves, yet they still boast grandly—hence, *robberious boasting* is not the Way.
This is what is meant by *"only instruction should be feared"*—here lies its proof.

Those who know the Way and practice it well have virtue that cannot be undermined by teaching, hence the next step: establishing what cannot be uprooted.
Those who establish well cannot be uprooted—*establish* means *to stand firm*. Those who stand firm in the Way, rooting their person and nation, first solidify their foundation before cultivating their branches, thus their roots run deep and their branches flourish, making them unshakable.

Those who embrace well do not lose—*lose* means *to depart*. *Separate* means *to detach*. Those who embrace the people with the Way have them loyal and undetected. Those who embrace the primal unity with the Way preserve their spirit whole and unlost. Their descendants’ sacrifices know no end.

Cultivate it in the self, and virtue becomes true.
Cultivate it in the family, and virtue abounds.
Cultivate it in the village, and virtue endures.
Cultivate it in the nation, and virtue flourishes.
Cultivate it in the world, and virtue is universal.
These five stages begin with self-cultivation and extend to the world.

To cultivate the Way in the self: the heart is at ease, nature joyful, *qi* nurtured, spirit nourished, desires few and private concerns minimal—thus life is prolonged, years extended, and one becomes a True Person.

To cultivate the Way in the family: fathers are benevolent, sons filial, brothers harmonious, younger siblings obedient, husbands trustworthy, wives virtuous—nine clans in concord, blessings flowing to future generations.

To cultivate the Way in the village: the aged are honored, the young cared for, the ignorant instructed—people united, ruler and subjects in trust, virtue enduring.

To cultivate the Way in the nation: natural joy arises, officials fulfill their duties, calamities and chaos do not arise, all treasures abundant—thus all things are plentiful.

To cultivate the Way in the world: transformation occurs without speech, governance without teaching—effortless, harmonious, universally inclusive—neighborhoods may be ennobled, influence reaching distant lands, virtue extending universally.

Thus, observe the self with the self, the family with the family, the village with the village, the nation with the nation, the world with the world.
*Observe* means *to scrutinize*.
Reflect on the Sage’s methods of self-cultivation to examine one’s own heart and mind—if one’s heart and mind embody the Way, then virtue becomes true.
Reflect on the Sage’s methods of family governance to examine one’s household—if one’s family harmonizes with kin, then virtue abounds.
Reflect on the Sage’s methods of village governance to examine one’s neighbors—if one’s community trusts in friendship, then virtue endures.
Reflect on the Sage’s methods of national governance to examine one’s people—if one’s people thrive, then virtue flourishes.
Reflect on the Sage’s methods of world governance to examine the world’s people—if the world’s people are without desire, without knowledge, then virtue is universal.

How do I know the world is thus? By this.
The Ancient Sage spoke: *"How do I know that those aligned with the Way prosper while those who abandon it perish?"*
The answer: By the five observations I have laid out, scrutinized in reflection—thus I know.

The Classic says: *"Without leaving one’s door, one knows the world."*
The *Yijing* says: *"Observe my life, observe the people."*—is this not its meaning?

To establish oneself and one’s nation with the Way, virtue extending to the world—how profound their contained virtue must be! Hence, next follows: *the depth of contained virtue*.

*The Daoist Classic of Authentic Virtue: Compiled Mysteries, Volume Eight*

**The Daoist Classic of Authentic Virtue: Contained Virtue’s Depth**

**Chapter on the Depth of Contained Virtue**

The Master of Azure Emptiness, Chen Jingyuan, compiled:
*"The Depth of Contained Virtue"*—
**Contained virtue is like that of the infant.**

*Contained* means *to cherish within*.
The Perfect One is pure and unadulterated, his virtue deep and profound. His emotions return to their original nature, his desires extinguished—his form stands serene, like that of an infant.

The infant is taken as the epitome of pure harmony.
Poisonous creatures do not sting, fierce beasts do not seize, raptors do not strike.

*Poisonous creatures*—scorpions, wasps, and fireflies—sting with their tail tips.
*Fierce beasts*—tigers and leopards—seize with claw and fist.
*Raptors*—hawks and eagles—strike with talon and beak.

The Perfect One is divine—his essence lost and regained like the infant’s unknowing heart, so his spirit remains whole and nothing can harm him.

Master Yan Junping said:
The infant, as a thing,
knows yet does not manifest,
is aware yet does not reach,
is capable yet does not act,
is skilled yet appears clumsy,
lives yet seems dead,
is new yet seems worn,
acts without acting,
harmonizes with the Dao’s completeness—
life without life,
body without body,
use without use,
hearing without hearing,
doing nothing yet nothing undone,
no intention, no mind,
seeking neither virtue nor power,
accumulating no spirit,
thinking not at all,
yet no obstruction or burden,
spirit and qi unattached,
cleverness without knowledge,
soft and weak, yet empty and still,
soul and spirit undisturbed,
joying joy without joy,
resting in desire without desire,
neither wasting life nor bending will—
thus he can embrace the Dao and contain virtue,
aligning with Heaven and Earth.
So wasps and serpents sting without malice,
raptors and beasts attack without intent.

His bones are weak, his sinews soft, yet his grip is firm.
The infant’s perfect harmony illustrates the Perfect One’s pure virtue—
before knowing joy or anger, his clenched fist is unbreakable,
for his true nature is singular and undivided.

Before knowing union with male and female, his essence flows freely—
*essence* is the infant’s vital source.
The infant’s desires have not yet stirred; his innate virtue moves spontaneously,
as the Perfect One’s breath circulates without obstruction,
and all desires fail to intrude.

[*Essence flows* was originally written as *fullness*.]
Master Wang Bi said:
*Flow* means *to grow*—
unharmed by external things, he remains whole and thrives.

The *Upper Clarity Scripture of True Perfection* says:
When a person is born,
he receives Heaven’s and Earth’s qi as spirit and form,
and the Primordial One’s qi as fluid and essence.
When Heaven’s qi is exhausted, the spirit scatters.
When Earth’s qi is exhausted, the body falls ill.
When the Primordial qi is exhausted, life ends.
Thus the Emperor’s method of returning to the Origin
reverses the flow of the hundred vessels,
supplementing the muddy nine [organs],
filling the brain so the spirit is whole,
the spirit whole so the body is whole.
When the body is whole, the hundred passages are regulated within,
evil qi vanishes without,
marrow solidifies into bone,
intestines transform into sinews—
pure and unmixed, eternal life is attained.

He cries all day yet his voice does not grow hoarse—
this is harmony perfected.
*Crying* is *weeping*.
When weeping reaches its extreme, the voice fails—*hoarse*—
or becomes raspy.
The infant weeps endlessly, yet his throat does not tire or scatter,
for Heaven’s harmonizing qi is fully present.
Thus the True One’s breath aligns with *la* and *wa*—
harmony is complete.

Knowing harmony is constancy;
knowing constancy is clarity.
The infant’s full harmony is true—
the Perfect One values harmony as the constant way,
so knowing constancy does not change,
and guarding it brings self-illumination.
This is the depth of contained virtue.

Master Du Guangting said:
The Five Constants are all present in harmony—
when a person’s body is harmonized, virtue is complete and he attains truth;
when a nation is harmonized, its transformation spreads and its blessings endure;
when among the people, harmony brings ritual alignment;
when leading armies, harmony ensures victory.
Great is the meaning of harmony!
This is knowing harmony and constancy,
so virtue is whole and self-illuminating.

*Beneficial days* bring auspiciousness;
the heart directing qi brings strength.
*Auspiciousness* is the omen of good or ill.
Once formed, one’s inherent nature is fixed—
no artificial enhancement will bring fortune;
only ruin follows.
Master Zhuangzi said:
*"One should follow nature without artificial aid."*

The heart has right and wrong, yet qi has no discrimination—
trusting qi brings softness and weakness,
trusting the heart brings rigidity and force.
Moreover, will can move qi, and qi can move will—
when the heart directs qi, qi grows strong and the heart rigid.
Master Zhuangzi said:
*"Do not listen with the heart, but with qi—
this is the heart directing qi,
which benefits life but misleads the Dao."*

When things grow strong, they age—
this is called *not the Way*.
*Not the Way* brings early decay.
When things reach their peak, they wither and grow old.
When the heart grows strong, it turns violent and cruel.
Yet the Way employs softness and weakness—
to wield strength and rigidity as the heart is *not the Way*.
Thus the Ancient Sage warned:
*"The path of not the Way—
better to stop early."*
*Stop* is *death*.
He who does not walk the Way dies young.

Virtue is deep, still, and silent—
enlightened, yet speechless—
thus follows: *The Wise Do Not Speak*.

The Wise do not speak;
those who speak are not Wise.
The Wise know the Dao with the heart, not with words,
valuing action over speech.
Those who discuss the Dao rely on words, not the heart—
they lose the Dao yet keep their talk.

Master Yan Junping said:
Five tastes are in the mouth, five notes in the ear—
yet what is sweet is not sweet,
what is bitter is not bitter,
what is *shang* is not *shang*,
what is *yu* is not *yu*—
yet Yi Ya and Shi Kuang could distinguish them.
How? Because the mouth cannot speak.
If taste and sound are thus,
how much more the subtle Dao!

Master Zhuangzi said:
When the Wise traveled north, he was asked three times—
he answered *"Do nothing"* yet gave no reply,
not because he refused to answer,
but because he did not know how.
His intent aligns with this.

The *Western Ascension Scripture* says:
The Dao is natural—
those who practice attain it,
those who hear can speak,
but the Wise do not speak.
Those who speak do not know.
They speak to be heard by sound—
thus, those who discuss the Dao with words
are merely making noise.

「The unknowing trouble others with words,
yet those who do not hear do not speak—
they do not know how to begin.

· For instance, those who know the music
discern the sound by the strings,
yet though their heart understands the tune,
their mouth cannot convey it.
The Dao is profound and subtle—
the knowing do not speak.
When the sound of music brings sorrow,
one suppresses the external note
and lets the heart speak—
yet the speaker does not know.
This is the case for those who can act and speak.

Plug its *yuè* [口], shut its gate—
this is similar in wording to Chapter 52,
yet differs in meaning.
There, it restrains the Dao by quietude,
to block the roots of cravings and desires;
here, it upholds the Dao’s wordlessness,
thus advocating the blunting of hearing and discarding of sight.

The Dao is formless—
it cannot be seen with the eyes,
it cannot be spoken with the mouth;
thus the heart is perplexed,
knowing not how to grasp it,
and the mouth is silenced,
unable to discuss it.
This is why the Perfect One
does not need to block sight or close the gate—
his nature is inherently so.

Dull its sharpness,
resolve its confusion,
blend its brightness,
equalize its dust—
these principles have already been stated in Chapter 4,
yet there, they were applied to the Dao to discuss its efficacy,
while here, they are grounded in human conduct to clarify practice.

The Perfect One, in harmony with Heaven’s intent yet without knowledge,
aligns with the Dao’s essence yet lacks form—
thus, the heart of sharpness and confusion,
where would it arise from?
The mind of distinction and separation,
where would it be born?

This is called *Xuántóng* [玄同].

The Perfect One’s movements and dwellings:
When manifest, he shares the root with all things;
when obscure, he blends with emptiness and nothingness.
Thus, his words and silences adapt to the times without deviation,
and his spontaneous speech follows the sun’s rising to respond to change—
this is called *Xuántóng* [玄同].

Thus, he cannot be approached or distanced,
cannot be swayed for gain or harm,
cannot be honored or slighted—
yet for this reason, he is honored by all under Heaven.
He interacts with the Dao above without excess,
and though the world praises him, he is not emboldened—
thus, he cannot be approached.
He deals with affairs below without impropriety,
and though the world condemns him, he is not disheartened—
thus, he cannot be distanced.
His *dànpō* [澹泊] is without force,
his adherence to *fèn* [分] is contented—
thus, he cannot be enticed by profit.
Though in lowly stations he is not humiliated,
and though in ugliness he does not contend—
thus, he cannot be trapped by harm.
Rank and reward cannot sully him,
power and influence cannot sway him—
how could he be held in esteem?
Losing his resolve does not bend him,
dwelling in poverty makes him only more serene—
how could he be deemed base?

The Perfect One practices these six virtues:
he does not prosper in fame nor suffer in obscurity,
bears no Heaven’s resentment nor man’s blame,
is not burdened by things nor haunted by ghosts’ reproach—
thus, he is honored by all under Heaven.

· When one governs himself without coercion,
then he governs things naturally—
this is *zhèng* [政], the next stage is *zhèngzhì* [政治] to govern the state.
To govern the state with *zhèngzhì* [政治],
to use unconventional strategies in warfare,
to take the world with *wúshì* [無事]—
*wúshì* [無事] means *wúwéi* [無為].

The *zhèng* [政] of the *zhèngzhì* [政治] ruler,
who relies on governance and instruction,
though the people may not be extravagant,
their exhaustion and decline grow ever deeper.
Once the traces of governance are made clear,
how could such rule endure long?

The *bàwáng* [霸王] ruler,
who employs cunning strategies in warfare,
though the state may not topple,
misfortunes and chaos accumulate daily.
Resentment and longing multiply—
how could such rule remain firmly established?

The ruler with the Dao,
who seeks to win the world’s heart
and establish an enduring legacy,
finds nothing better than *wúshì* [無事].
Thus, Chapter 48 states:
*"To win the world, one must rely on wúshì [無事];
when one resorts to governance,
it is insufficient to win the world."*
This is the Master Lao’s teaching
on the way to govern the world in great peace.

*Zhèng* [政] is written as *zhèng* [正] in the *Héshàng* [河上] edition.

How do I know this to be true?
From this [text].

The Master Lao does not dare claim these words as his own,
thus he cites the Sage’s saying:

Some say the Master Lao was the historian beneath the pillars of Zhou,
who surveyed the ancient texts of the Three *Fèn* [坟] and Old Scriptures.
Hence, he cites them to verify his point.

*"I do nothing, yet the people transform themselves;
I take no action, yet the people grow rich."*

The Master Lao continues:

*"I love stillness, and the people align themselves;
I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity."*

I—this is the self-designation of the sovereign in an age of governance—
speaks of how I, without action, follow the Dao,
making no alterations, allowing the people to live as they will,
their customs transforming naturally.

I, without interference or disturbance,
frugal in my expenditures,
the people enrich their livelihoods,
their households prospering naturally.

I remain quiet and unspoken,
guarding myself in humility and fear,
the people embrace the harmony of Heaven,
their customs pure and upright.

I, without desire, am empty and void,
discarding ornamentation and honoring the root,
the people do not seek vain ambition,
their nature returning to simplicity.

If I act or desire,
yet hope to lead the people to wealth and longevity,
I have never seen such a possibility.

Zhuangzi said:
*"Heaven and Earth possess great beauty yet speak not,
the four seasons shine with clear principles yet debate not,
all things follow their natural laws yet are not explained."*

The Sage, thus,
originates from Heaven and Earth’s beauty,
penetrates the principles of all things.
Hence, the Perfect One acts without interference,
the Great Sage does without contrivance—
this is called observing the Dao of Heaven and Earth.

The *Héshàng* edition further states:
*"I have no emotions, and the people remain pure."*
The annotation reads:
*"By cultivating the Dao and guarding the True,
severing the Six Emotions,
the people naturally follow me in purity."*

In governing the state and transforming the people,
nothing surpasses *wúshì* [無事].
When *wúshì* [無事] is practiced,
its governance is expansive and relaxed—
thus, it follows with *"its governance is dim and tranquil."*

Its governance dim and tranquil,
its people are sincere and virtuous.
The *Kāiyuán* Imperial commentary says:
*"Dim and tranquil—without contrivance, expansively relaxed.
Sincere and virtuous—unadorned, thick with integrity."*
This means the sovereign without action,
whose governance is broad and lenient,
allows things to follow their natural course,
whose laws are not harsh or violent,
thus their customs become sincere and virtuous,
dwelling in purity and stillness,
ever growing in integrity.

The ancient text reads *zhèngzhèng* [偆偆], but Wang Bi renders it as *chúnchún* [惇惇].
Its governance is sharp and probing,
its people are depleted and scattered.
The *Kāiyuán* Imperial commentary says:
*"Sharp and probing—with contrivance, strict and urgent.
Depleted and scattered—withered, impoverished, and dispersed."*
This means the sovereign with contrivance,
whose governance is stern and urgent,
binds the people with laws,
whose decrees grow ever more explicit—
thieves and robbers multiply,
thus the people wither and disperse,
every movement entangled in prohibitions,
fearing and avoiding them,
their moral cultivation daily more ruined and deficient.

Disaster, oh! Fortune depends upon it;
fortune, oh! Disaster lurks within it—
who can know its limit?
*Yī* [倚] means "to rely upon";
*fú* [伏] means "to conceal."

The dim and tranquil governance,
though the world calls it lax,
yet the people are sincere and virtuous—
truly, they find joy in it.

The sharp and probing governance,
though the world calls it capable,
yet the people are depleted and scattered—
truly, they find sorrow in it.

What the world calls disaster,
none but rejoice in it—
fear brings caution,
and fortune arises from within.

What the world calls fortune,
none but fear it—
joy brings arrogance,
and disaster hides within.

Disaster and fortune rely upon and conceal each other—
none can fathom their ultimate bounds.

Thus, Heaven and Earth have their moments of rest and activity,
the sun and moon their waxing and waning—
this is the law of relying and concealing.

Disaster hides within fortune:
if fortune brings arrogance,
then disaster arrives.
Fortune conceals disaster within:
if disaster brings caution,
then fortune comes.
This is how the world operates.

Hence, the sovereign of the Dao,
guards it with purity and stillness,
trusts it to unfold naturally,
does not profit from wealth or treasure,
does not seek proximity to the noble and rich,
does not delight in longevity,
does not grieve over early death,
does not glorify the open and flourishing,
does not despise obscurity and want—
thus, disaster and fortune rely upon and conceal each other in what way?

There is no right or wrong in this.

Disaster and fortune rely upon and conceal each other—
how could there be no right or wrong?
It lies in whether the sovereign of the Dao
acts without interference or contrivance,
forgets form and substance,
and only then does it become right.
If one deliberately seeks to make it right,
that rightness will surely become strange.
If one deliberately seeks to do good,
that goodness will surely become unnatural.

Rightness becomes strange,
goodness becomes unnatural.

The hearts of the people are not singular.
The sovereign of the Dao,
uses his heart like a balance—
neither pushing nor inviting,
responding without seizing,
thus he can master all things without harming them.

If he enforces rightness upon what is not right,
that rightness will be strange.
If he enforces goodness upon what is not good,
that goodness will be unnatural.
If he allows things to naturally become right and good,
then disaster and fortune will not be perverse,
but will rely upon and conceal each other.

The people’s confusion is long-standing.
The shallow customs cannot naturally become right and good,
yet they force truth into rightness,
reverse nature into goodness,
and thus become strange and unnatural—
bewildered and unaware,
their origin of confusion is indeed long.

The *Xīshēng Jīng* [西升经] states:
*"To enforce rightness is to find no place—
rightness naturally returns to itself.
It does not receive what is perverse,
thus perverse *qi* departs—
this is called the Dao naturally aiding."*

Hence, the Sage is square yet does not cut,
the sovereign of the Dao
is square and upright in himself,
allowing things to awaken by themselves,
not enforcing his own square and upright upon them,
lest they follow him while losing their nature.

He is frugal yet not impure.
*Lián* [廉] means "clean";
*huì* [秽] means "impure."
The sovereign of the Dao,
follows his nature in cleanliness and frugality,
allows things to transform naturally,
not using his own purity to flaunt others’ impurity,
but merely letting things know to encourage
and wash away the impure.

The ancient text reads *chuàng* [创], meaning "to harm."
This means the Sage is generous in himself,
yet does not punish others to cause harm.

He is straightforward yet not domineering.
*Shì* [肆] means "to apply force."
The sovereign of the Dao,
inherits a straightforward and honest *qi*,
takes responsibility without bending,
yet does not impose his own directness
to forcefully apply or provoke upon others—
this is akin to great directness appearing as bending.

He shines yet does not dazzle.
*Guāng* [光] means "enlightened and wise."
The sovereign of the Dao,
is enlightened and wise, his discernment radiant,
yet also preserves and conceals himself,
not using his own strong wisdom
to dazzle and overwhelm others,
lest they be extinguished.

From this point onward,
all are examples of dim and tranquil governance,
not sharp and probing rule.

When governance is expansive, the people are fortunate;
when rule is strict, the people suffer disaster—
disaster and fortune rely upon and conceal each other,
originating from the people and from Heaven—
thus, it follows with *"the affairs of the people and the response to Heaven."*

To govern the people and serve Heaven,
nothing surpasses frugality.
Frugality is love.

The common folk dissipate their *qi* through excessive desires,
pursuing luxury yet never satisfied,
while the Sage cherishes *qi*, restrains expenditure,
and lives with moderation—thus having abundance.
Therefore, the ruler who governs without action,
maintaining clarity, tranquility, and simplicity,
reduces the people’s burdens,
fills the granaries and armories,
and teaches them propriety—
then preserves their vitality and loves their *qi*,
purifies sacrifices, and rejects extravagance,
so that both humanity and the divine are in harmony.
Thus it is said: *nothing surpasses frugality.*

Only through frugality is it called *early service*;
restraining expenditure without luxury,
moderating desires while cherishing *qi* and spirit—
this is to align with the Dao.
The Sage, before calamity or fortune manifests,
constantly aligns with the Dao—
this is called *early service.*

*Early service* is called *heavily accumulating virtue*;
to economize the people’s wealth,
cherish *qi* and spirit,
and thus serve the Celestial—
this is one virtue.
Again, by *early service* to the Dao,
bringing harmony between humanity and the divine,
it is called *heavily accumulating virtue.*

*Heavily accumulating virtue* means nothing is unconquered;
the one who *heavily accumulates virtue*
can rule over the people,
and all under Heaven will turn and revere him—
none will fail to submit.
If nothing is unconquered,
then its limits are unknown;
if none fail to submit,
then all things transform and are civilized,
and virtue and the Dao are boundless—
thus its limits are unknown.

If its limits are unknown,
then one can have a realm;
he whose virtue and Dao are boundless
will place himself last yet be first,
set himself aside yet endure—
all under Heaven will joyfully follow without tiring,
and thus can be the sovereign of a land.

In days past, Master Gēngsāng resided on the slopes of Yǔshān.
For three years, his people knew no sickness or plague,
and their grain stores overflowed.
They whispered among themselves:
*"When Master Gēngsāng first arrived,
we were struck by his difference.
Now, when we calculate daily, we lack nothing,
and when we calculate yearly, we have abundance—
could he be a Sage?"*
*"Shall we then sacrifice to him as a spirit,
and enshrine him as a deity?"*
This is what is meant by:
*"Virtue and the Dao have no limits,
and thus one can have a realm."*

「The mother of a realm, one may endure long;
The mother of a realm refers to the accumulation of virtue.
Virtue can nurture the people abundantly—
when the people are prosperous and rich,
then the altars of soil and grain (*shèqì*) may endure long.
This is called the Dao/Way of deep roots and firm stems,
of enduring life and lasting vision.
Roots are the foundation;
stems are the flower’s base.
He who cultivates fruit trees,
when their roots are deep, their stems are firm—
even if great winds arise,
they cannot uproot the foundation
nor shake the fruit from its place.
Thus, deep roots yield flourishing branches,
and firm stems ensure the fruit does not fall—
this is what is called enduring long.

The ruler who accumulates virtue,
in governing people and serving Heaven,
nourishes his land and sustains his people—
plants his roots in *wuwei* (non-action),
and secures his stems in *qīngjìng* (serene tranquility).
Then the altars of soil and grain extend far,
and this is called enduring life;
his reign is ever bright,
and this is called lasting vision.

Du Guāngtíng said:
Those who cultivate the Dao/Way,
harmonize their spirit and body,
accumulate *qi* and preserve their wholeness,
fortify their inner gates (*sānjiān*) while relaxing all concerns—
all spirits submit in order,
all affairs proceed in harmony,
transformation knows no bounds,
and their years are long and enduring.
Their stems are rooted in the *Hùnyuán* (Primordial Domain),
their roots run deep in the *Wúhé* (Land of No-Where),
and they stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Nine Elders and Seven Ancients.

The ancient text read: *"deep roots and firm stems"* (*shēnguì*).
Serving Heaven and accumulating virtue,
one may have a realm—
thus it follows with governing great states.

Governing great states is like cooking small fish.
To govern a realm of ten thousand chariots (*wànshèng zhī guó*),
is like cooking a fish of mere inches—
adjusting the water and fire,
letting it cook naturally, then it is whole and perfect.
Agitate it, and the fish is harmed;
the fish harmed, it rots and decays.
A skilled ruler nurtures his people,
harmonizing his governance and teachings,
letting them find their own way—
then they are naturally at ease.
Disturb them, and the people are harmed;
the people harmed, they grow chaotic and rebellious.

When the Dao/Way permeates all under Heaven,
its spirits are not fearsome.
The Sage employs the *wuwei* Dao/Way of serene tranquility,
and as he moves through the world,
his harmonizing *qi* spreads across all lands—
in valleys, valleys are full;
in ravines, ravines are full.
Thus winds and rains come in season,
floods and droughts do not arise,
human hearts remain natural,
and no one seeks false blessings.
Though spirits and deities exist,
they dare not display their fearsome transformations.
The *Xīshēng Jīng* says:
*"This is the Dao/Way of natural assistance—
not skilled in ritual sacrifice (*cí*),
yet spirits flee of their own accord."*

Spirits are the essence of transformation.
It is not that their spirits are not fearsome,
but that their fearsome transformations do not harm the people.
It is not that their spirits lack transformation,
but that their fearsome changes cease and vanish.
This arises from the people not making disorder—
then calamities and disasters (*qìxiáng*) how could they emerge?
When people uphold their constant virtue,
spirits’ fearsome transformations have no cause to harm the people—
this is the natural order.
It is not that the spirits do not harm the people,
nor that the Sage harms the people.
Their spirits, though fearsome, do not harm the people,
because the Sage’s *wuwei* and serene tranquility
move the spirits and deities to sense his radiant virtue,
and they themselves regulate their shadowy essences (*yīnlíng*).

The words of *Lièzi* on the Sage’s governance:
He neither gives nor bestows favors,
yet all things find sufficiency;
he neither hoards nor collects,
yet nothing is lacking.
The harmony of *yin* and *yang* is constant,
the sun and moon shine eternally,
the four seasons follow their course,
winds and rains are ever balanced,
the people are nurtured in time,
the land yields abundant harvests,
the soil knows no erosion,
the people no untimely deaths,
the world no sickness or plague,
and the spirits no fearsome manifestations.

For the two do not harm each other,
their virtues return in harmony.
The two are the Sage and the spirits.
Hé Shànggōng said:
The two do not harm each other—
people are governed by the *yang*,
spirits by the *yin*;
people preserve their lives,
spirits preserve their spirits—
thus their virtues return in harmony.
Moreover, when the ruler can preserve the spirits,
the spirits can bless the ruler—
and this is called the return of virtue.

Du Guāngtíng said:
The people are the foundation of the state;
when the foundation is firm, the state is secure.
The people are the masters of the spirits;
when the master is at peace, the spirits are content.
The Sage governs through the Dao/Way—
since he does not harm people or spirits,
the spirits, moved by the Sage’s achievements,
also do not harm the world.
The two take joy in each other,
their virtues return in harmony.

Great states govern through serene tranquility to secure the small,
thus it follows with the small states beneath them.

Great states are the lowest currents (*xiàliú*),
the confluence of all under Heaven.
The seas and rivers can be kings of all valleys
because they excel in descending;
great states can be emperors of all lands
because they excel in humility and descending—
thus they are where all under Heaven’s subjects gather.

The confluence of all under Heaven is female (*pín*),
for the female ever conquers the male through tranquility,
and the female is ever the descending one.

*(Continuing from the previous text:)*
The great state’s excellence in descending
is what makes it the confluence of all under Heaven.

The great state, though mighty, forgets its might—
thus no small state escapes its embrace.
In high position yet humble in descent,
it does not rely on coercive force or arms—
so neighboring states submit in gentleness,
all willingly becoming its servants and subjects,
thus winning the small states’ affection.

Yán Jūnping said:
The enlightened kings and sage rulers,
when governing great states,
bestow without expecting return,
descend without demanding obedience—
they enfold the lands of all feudal lords (*zhūhóu*)
yet none dare to fear them;
their virtue encompasses the strength of all feudal lords,
yet none dare to resist them.
They lower their station to align with others’ intentions,
prioritizing loyalty, integrity, and sincere trust,
holding scholars and worthies in esteem—
they cede land to attract virtuous talent,
encourage agriculture and weaving to amass wealth,
employ alliances and counter-alliances to guard against unforeseen threats,
open their granaries and distribute wealth,
support the aged and care for orphans,
relieve the poor and aid the distressed—
they honor reclusive worthies,
bestowing gifts yet not seizing them,
granting authority yet not claiming it,
practicing gentleness and simplicity,
employing *wuwei* in governance.
Though feudal lords may be greedy, cruel, or arrogant,
relying on brute force or their own might,
they are still subdued by the weight of the great state’s virtue—
when it descends in tranquility and humility,
those rulers regulate their conduct,
reform their errors,
cede land and offer treasures,
risk their lives to pledge allegiance,
and beg to be made vassals of its borderlands or tributary states.
Thus they win the hearts of the small states.»

The small state submits to the great state, and thus takes the great state’s authority.
The small state dwells in its smallness yet forgets its smallness,
so there is no great state it cannot dominate—
humble and reverent in its lowly position,
not indulging in arrogance or contempt,
thus neighboring states comfort and assist it,
all desiring to aid it—
this is how it seizes the great state’s might and prestige.

Mencius said:
Only the virtuous can act with greatness toward the small,
thus Tang served Ge Bo, and King Wen served Kun Yi.
Only the wise can act with smallness toward the great,
thus Taiwang served Xuanchuang, and Goujian served Wu.

Those who act with greatness toward the small are joyful in Heaven’s will.
Those who act with smallness toward the great fear Heaven’s will.
Joyful in Heaven’s will, they preserve the world.
Fearful of Heaven’s will, they preserve their own state.

The *Odes* say:
*"Fear Heaven’s might, and in its time, you shall be preserved."*
This is from the *Zhou Preface*,
praising King Cheng’s fear of Heaven’s might,
and his ability to secure lasting peace.

Yan Junping said:
*"When in a weak and small position,
move according to the Way, follow virtue without fail,
act with sincerity and loyalty,
value simplicity and till the fields,
harmony between ruler and people,
the ruler as the heart within the body,
the people as limbs to the body—
unified in purpose, they can die together."*

Even if the great state’s ruler
is burdened by strength, wields authority,
possesses virtue, and practices benevolence,
his heart like a hungry tiger, his wrath like a surging spring—
yet if he aligns with Heaven’s will,
gains the people’s favor,
earns the trust of ministers and neighbors,
unleashes the hidden might of his enemies,
humbles himself in body and spirit,
offers sincere allegiance,
and governs with quiet clarity—
then his spirit is moved, his resolve shaken,
his anger dissipates, his misfortunes shift,
and he pledges fealty to you.

Thus, sometimes submission takes authority,
sometimes submission seizes authority.
This is ambiguous phrasing.
*"Taking"* refers to the superior taking through humility,
subduing with meekness to win the people’s favor.
*"Seizing"* refers to submission to gain authority,
obeying with reverence to secure the great state’s power.
This is mutual reciprocity through righteousness.

The great state does not exceed its bounds,
desiring only to nurture all under its sway.
The great state’s ruler,
elevating humility and honoring reverence,
refining himself through rites and law,
subduing the small states—
does he truly harbor greedy ambitions,
seeking to annex and hoard the small states’ people?
He merely upholds the constant virtue of humility and reverence.

The small state does not exceed its bounds,
seeking only to serve others.
The small state’s ruler,
preserving loyalty and obedience,
refining himself through institutions—
does he truly harbor excessive desires,
pretending to serve the great state’s people?
He only holds firm to self-preservation,
guarding his inherent virtue.

Both attain what they desire,
so the great state ought to submit.
The great and small states,
each content with their portion,
mutually upholding their due,
without encroachment—
this is *"settled in their place, content with their customs,"*
neighboring states visible yet distant,
their roosters and dogs heard but never seen,
their people dying of old age without ever meeting.

Yet the small state’s submission is the constant of ritual.
The great state’s humility is truly complete sincerity.

The great state ought to submit—
urging deeply, making it enduring and steadfast,
thus securing the world’s alliances.

The great state’s humility contains the essence of the Way.
The Way is the deepest essence of all things.
Essence means hidden, obscure, contained.
The Way encompasses all things without exclusion,
its origins most profound, most hidden—
the fundamental root of all existence,
with nothing escaping its protection.

The *Western Ascension Scripture* says:
*"The Way is profound and hidden,
a boundless void—
speaking of the Way as the refuge of all things,
nothing not contained within it.
From the lofty dome of heaven to the vast earth,
from the sun and moon’s radiance to the finest of life—
all draw sustenance from the Way,
obscurely relying on its shelter."*

The virtuous man’s treasure,
the wicked man’s refuge.
The virtuous man—
the superior sage—
hears the Way and diligently practices it,
refining his essence and nurturing his spirit,
ascending with lightness and ease,
firmly guarding the wondrous root,
making it his enduring treasure.

The wicked man—
the inferior sage—
hears the Way and scoffs at it,
until he encounters its contrary and stumbles into misfortune,
then longs to return to fortune,
seeking the Way’s protection once more.

Beautiful speech can be sold,
noble conduct can elevate one.
This explains the wicked man’s refuge.
Sweet words find favor everywhere—
even the most cunning merchant’s schemes
are met with eager agreement.
How could they compare to sincere speech,
dull and flavorless, dismissed without thought?

Noble conduct commands respect—
nowhere can it be ignored,
even the lowest traveler knows its worth.
How could it be likened to vulgar ways,
or whitewashed as shame?

Thus, even those without speech or conduct,
borrowing sweet words and noble deeds,
can win over crowds and rise above the masses—
how much more so those who embody the Way!

Why abandon those who are unvirtuous?
Even the deceitful and false,
relying on beautiful speech and noble conduct,
can please the multitude—
how much more so the Way, which can be leaned upon for refuge.
From this, how can one say the unvirtuous shall always remain so?
Only fearing transformation’s reach—
why abandon them at all?

Thus, the Son of Heaven is established,
and the Three Ministers appointed.
Heaven entrusts its Way to the ruler,
commanding him to transform the unvirtuous.
The ruler, fearing transformation may be incomplete,
further appoints the Three Ministers to assist him.

Du Guangting said:
*"The vastness of the Four Seas,
the abundance of all things—
at their origin, humanity could not exist without governance,
thus the Son of Heaven is established to nurture them,
revering Heaven and Earth as father and mother,
and is called the Son of Heaven."*

One ruler cannot govern alone—
thus officials are appointed to oversee him,
and among them, the Three Ministers stand supreme.
*The Book of Documents* and *The Rites of Zhou* declare:
*"It is the Three Ministers alone
who discuss the Dao and govern the realm."*

The Three Ministers—
the Grand Marshal (太尉), Grand Tutor (司徒), and Grand Minister of Works (司空)—
assist the Son of Heaven,
regulate yin and yang,
cherish the myriad people,
and broaden the teachings of the Way.
Even if one offers a jade *guangbi* as tribute before four-horse chariots,
it is not as valuable as presenting this Dao.

Du Guangting explains:
*"Two hands clasped form the gesture of 'guang' (拱).
The *bi* (璧) is a ceremonial jade.
The *guangbi* is the largest of jades.
Four horses harnessed together pull a single carriage.
In ancient times, when feudal lords paid homage to the Son of Heaven,
assembled at great states, or visited small ones,
or met in the wilds,
when two rulers faced each other,
they observed the ritual of presenting tribute first—
leading with gifts and currency, called 'advancing' (先).
Now, the Three Ministers should prioritize discussing the Dao
and governing the realm.
Even if they wished to offer four-horse chariots and great jades to the ruler,
it would still be the duty of subjects.
Such gifts only benefit licentious extravagance,
but contribute nothing to governance.
It is far better to advance the Dao of *wuwei* (無為) and serene stillness
to transform the world—
so that the unvirtuous turn to goodness,
the unrepentant change their hearts,
and the Way’s transformation spreads universally,
while imperial virtue extends far and wide.
What need is there for jades or horses?"*

Scholars who pursue learning
value an inch of time over a foot of jade—
how much more so the ruler who embodies the Dao?
Why did the ancients hold this Dao in such esteem?
Because it is the Dao of *wuwei* and serene stillness.

Someone asks: *"What did the ancients mean by valuing this Dao?"*
Did they not say:
*"Seek and you shall obtain,
commit guilt and you shall be absolved"*?
Thus, it is held in high regard by all under Heaven.

The subtlety of the Dao
begins with enlightenment within the mind and body,
and ultimately illuminates the cosmos beyond.
Its mysteries penetrate the formless void,
while its unfolding fills the boundless expanse.
To embody it is to perfect oneself,
to apply it is to benefit the world.
Though it may not be said *"seek and you shall obtain,"*
it cannot be neglected.

To obtain it without seeking is to attain it naturally.
If attained naturally, why need the Three Ministers at all?
Thus, it is not *"seek and you shall obtain,"*
but rather *"seek and you shall obtain"*—
a principle the ancients held constant.
Those who comprehend this constant Way
shall have no guilt to bear.

If one were to stray from the Dao and commit a fault,
by amending one’s errors and returning to the Way of *wuwei* and serene stillness,
one may yet avoid disgrace.
The original text reads: *"Did they not say 'seek and you shall obtain'?"*
Yan Junping’s version states: *"Obtain it without seeking."*

The profound mysteries of attaining the Dao
lie in acting without action—
thus it is called *wuwei*.
To do without doing,
to act without laboring,
to taste without indulging—
the Perfect One does nothing,
yet lets things act of themselves.
Things act of themselves, yet there is no doing without doing.
Still, the Perfect One’s heart never stirs.

To labor without toil is to let things manage their own affairs.
Things manage their own affairs, yet there is no labor without labor.
Still, the Perfect One’s body never wearies.

To taste without desire is to follow the essence of things.
Things follow their own essence, yet there is no taste without taste.
Still, the Perfect One’s palate never craves.

If the heart remains undisturbed, clarity is boundless.
If the body labors not, substance is profound.
If the mouth desires nothing, tranquility endures.
If tranquility endures, vital essence flows without end.

Another interpretation of *"taste without taste"*:
It is not the speech of beauty or ugliness,
but the speech of the Great Dao’s flavorlessness.
The Classic says:
*"When the Dao issues from the mouth,
its taste is faint and without flavor."*

Great or small, much or little—
rewarding resentment with virtue.
People say there are great and small matters in the world,
and that human affairs range from much to little.
They say that all actions diminish one’s true nature
and stray from spontaneity.
Diminishing true nature breeds resentment,
straying from spontaneity spawns malice.
Resentment and malice together
are the stages of calamity and chaos.

Only the Perfect One, with *wuwei*, *wuwei*, and *wuwei*,
can extinguish the heart and wither the body.
Even if there are resentments from those who act,
they are all met with the Perfect One’s heartless, boundless virtue.
Someone asks: *"If one has virtue, how does one repay it?"*
The world’s affairs—great or small, much or little—
its anger, resentment, kindness, and virtue—
are all repaid with the Perfect One’s heartless, boundless virtue.

Lu Xisheng says:
*"Those who embody the Dao are profound and boundless,
responding to the world while rooted in *wuwei*,
attending to affairs while rooted in *wuwei*,
tasting without indulgence while rooted in *wuwei*.
Though their form may be vast, their essence is simple and small.
Though their deeds may be many, their essence is subtle and few.
Thus, they flourish in simplicity and stillness,
unshaken by all things."*

Only thus can there be no desires,
no desires mean no selfishness,
kindness is the accumulation of selfishness,
resentment is the seed of kindness.
Only the Sage can have no selfish desires,
no selfish desires mean no selfish kindness,
no selfish kindness means no selfish resentment.
Common people are not so—
because they have selfish desires,
they have kindness and resentment.

Yet those under Heaven who harbor resentment,
the Sage repays them with virtue.
Those who act unvirtuously,
the Sage cultivates them with virtue.
Thus, the people live in harmony,
and ruler and ruled have no resentment—
this is what is meant.

Zhongni said:
*"To walk the Way fully under Heaven is to have no resentment.
How could the Sage harbor resentment toward anything?"*

Plan for difficulty when it is easy,
act on greatness when it is small.
Difficulty and ease, greatness and smallness—
these are the world’s great and small matters.
Right and wrong, beauty and ugliness,
resentment and anger, kindness and virtue—
all arise from subtle beginnings.
None do not begin as easy and end as difficult,
or start as small and become great.
If one plans at the time of ease,
there will be no difficulty at the end.
If one acts at the time of smallness,
there will be no greatness later.

But if one waits until difficulty arises,
or acts when greatness is already upon them,
resentment deepens and calamities accumulate.
To then seek to dissolve difficulty and untangle chaos—
is it not difficult?

The great difficulties of the world must be undertaken when they are easy.
The great affairs of the world must be addressed when they are small.

For arduous tasks, they must arise from ease—
one must plan for them when they are still easy.
For weighty matters, they begin in subtlety—
one must act upon them when they are still minute.

The myriad types of affairs are too numerous to enumerate,
thus the world is spoken of in general terms.

Yan Junping said:
When great difficulty is about to arise,
it is like a malicious wind entering a person.
Before it manifests, if one is cautious and prevents its coming,
it remains at the skin and hair—
boiling with soup can dispel it.
When it penetrates to the sinews and veins,
a fine needle can extract it.
When it reaches the organs,
hundreds of medicines can remove it.
When it sinks to the marrow,
even Heaven and Earth cannot transform it,
and the processes of creation cannot cure it.
Thus it is said: the world’s great difficulties begin in ease.

When great affairs are about to emerge,
they are like water issuing from a mountain—
first appearing as dampness and droplets,
then flowing ceaselessly, gathering into streams and valleys.
Therefore, the Sage never seeks greatness directly,
and thus achieves true greatness.

The earlier passage spoke of those who lose the Dao,
who delight in difficult and great affairs,
and thus often meet with ruin.
Here, it cites the Sage’s refusal to seek greatness—
the utmost caution toward subtleties.

The Sage does not pursue difficult and great affairs,
yet does not remain idle—
easy, simple, and effortless,
thus able to accomplish enduring and vast undertakings.

Yan Junping said:
The Sage’s establishment of merit and fame is subtle,
thus able to reveal the hidden,
thus able to illuminate the small,
thus able to achieve great concealment,
thus able to manifest intent—
dwelling beneath the common people,
yet becoming a ruler of kings.

Light promises bring few fulfillments.
Many easinesses bring many difficulties.
Those who speak without threefold deliberation,
lightly granting promises,
engage in many affairs yet cannot keep their word.
Those who do not plan at the beginning but are cautious at the end,
who act lightly,
accumulate difficulties and face unpredictable changes.
How could one not be cautious?

Thus the Sage treats even these matters with difficulty,
and so ultimately faces no difficulty.

With the Sage’s talent and virtue,
they still find difficulty in small and easy matters—
how much more so for those without the Sage’s talent and virtue,
who neglect them?

Thus, the common world accumulates burdens,
while the Sage ultimately faces no difficulty.

Yan Junping said:
The Sage’s heart is silent and unmoved,
their mouth silent and unspoken,
their eyes silent and unseeing,
their ears silent and unhearing.
In motion, they are like Heaven and Earth;
in stillness, like spirits and gods.
They act without doing,
speak without words.
Advancing, they are invincible;
retreating, they are unexhausted.
Their body knows no minor worries,
their realm knows no trifling calamities.

The tranquility of non-action
must come from simplicity and ease,
thus it is followed by its stability and ease of maintenance.

*[End of Chapter Eight: Hidden Treasures of the Daoist Canon—*Mùwēi* Scroll]*
*[Beginning of Chapter Nine: Compiled Subtleties of the Daoist Canon—*Zuǎnwēi* Scroll]*

**Chapter Nine: Compiled Subtleties of the Daoist Canon—*Zuǎnwēi* Scroll**

Bi Xuzi Chen Jingyuan compiled:

The *Dao* of **virtue/power** is easy to maintain when its roots are deep,
its troubles yet unseen are easy to plan against,
its frailty is easy to break,
its subtlety is easy to disperse.

Act upon it **before its emergence**,
For when a realm is yet at peace and quiet,
it is easy to preserve and uphold.
But when it nears collapse and peril,
then guarding it becomes difficult.

When wickedness has not yet taken form,
it is easy to plot its eradication.
But when its evil shape is already manifest,
its annihilation becomes hard to achieve.

When the seeds of misfortune are tender,
they are easy to uproot and destroy.
But when branches and trunks have grown,
how can one strike them down?

When regret and sorrow are but faint traces,
worries and anxieties are easy to dispel.
But when calamity has already revealed itself,
its disaster cannot be undone.

The original text reads: *"its frailty is easy to judge"* (or *"to disperse"*).
**Act upon it before its emergence**—this means to **modify and remove** it beforehand.

When a realm has not yet fallen into peril,
and wickedness has not yet sprouted,
if one preemptively guards against it,
then what misfortune could arise?

**Prevent disorder before it begins.**
*"Prevent"* here means **to rescue**.

When the seeds of misfortune have not yet taken root,
and calamity has not yet attached itself,
if rescue comes first,
then no great harm shall arise.

Yan Junping said:
A person not yet sick is easy to heal,
a realm not yet in danger is easy to counsel,
a sprouting affliction is easy to address,
a small, weak misfortune is easy to dispel.

How does this work?
A cart with a single wheel missing can be guided by a child.
But when it has overturned and toppled,
a thousand men cannot restore it.

A fledgling bird, not yet able to fly,
can be stopped with a mere finger’s touch.
But when it has become a wild goose,
soaring with wings above the clouds,
no net or snare can capture it.

A newborn beast, still nursing,
can be bound with a single rope.
But when it has grown into a tiger,
seizing leather and devouring cattle and horses,
swords and spears cannot threaten it,
nets and traps cannot restrain it.

Thus, a single drop of water
can swell into vast oceans,
a small serpent, if not slain,
becomes a divine dragon.
Accumulated goodness leads to auspicious fortune,
while unchecked evil eventually brings ruin.

A tree of a thousand arms begins from a tiny sprout,
a nine-tiered tower rises from a single shovelful of earth,
a journey of a thousand miles starts beneath one’s feet.

These three things illustrate
the failure to heed early warnings and subtle signs,
leading to later calamities.

Misfortune not preemptively guarded against,
evil not gradually checked,
is like planting a tree.
At first, it grows from a tiny sprout,
which can be pulled out and destroyed.
But when it has reached a girth of embrace,
its roots are deep in the shadowed cliffs,
its branches stretch toward the sunlit peaks,
a hundred feet tall, blocking the sun and moon—
how can it be felled?

This shows **evil arising from one’s own nature**.
Again, like building a tower:
it begins with a single basket of earth,
which can be kicked away and ruined.
But when it has risen to nine tiers,
soaring a hundred *rèn* high,
matching the grandeur of hills and valleys—
how can it be demolished?

This shows **evil formed through accumulated habits**.
Again, like a traveler setting out:
they begin with a single step,
which can be turned back with a mere pivot of the heel.
But when they have gone a thousand miles,
long rivers stretch endlessly,
towering mountains rise steep and vast,
paths narrow and treacherous,
roads winding and forked—
how can they return?

This shows **a journey gone too far to halt**.
The *Yì* says:
*"Treading on frost, the solid ice is near"*—this is what it means.
Nine tiers (originally *"nine layers"*), the ancient text reads *"nine stages"*.

Those who act **meet ruin**,
those who grasp **meet loss**.
To act beyond necessity brings natural decay,
to act within desire **diminishes vitality**.
Yet those who cling to power and love fame
suffer loss unto their own lives,
those who value courage and delight in conflict
invite disaster upon their realms—
all because they cannot act **before its emergence**,
cannot rescue **before disorder begins**.

Thus, the Sage acts not, and so meets no ruin;
does not grasp, and so meets no loss.

Where things fail, failure comes from action—
how could non-action bring failure?
Where intentions falter, loss comes from grasping—
how could non-grasping bring loss?

Therefore, the Sage directs their mind
not toward petty achievements,
but always toward **emptiness, tranquility, serenity, and stillness**,
and **non-action**—
naturally without action,
without grasping,
without ruin,
without loss.

Zhuangzi said:
The Emperor of the Southern Sea was named **Tao**,
the Emperor of the Northern Sea was named **Hu**,
and the Emperor of the Central Sea was **Hun Dun**.
Tao and Hu once met in the land of Hun Dun.
Hun Dun treated them with great kindness.
Soon, Tao and Hu plotted to repay Hun Dun’s virtue,
saying: *"All people have seven orifices
for seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing,
but this one has none—
let us drill some for them!"*
Each day they drilled one orifice,
and on the seventh day, Hun Dun died—
this is proof that **action brings ruin**.

The people’s undertakings
often fail when nearly complete.
*"Near"* means **close at hand**.

The common folk, though they may begin with virtuous deeds,
yet have no completion—
they act first, then grow weary.
When their undertakings are nearly finished,
they neglect caution and vigilance,
and thus meet with ruin.

**To be as diligent at the end as at the beginning**
is the way to avoid failure.
This is a repeated admonition and exhortation.

If the common folk could **preserve their initial diligence to the end**,
all their endeavors would succeed.

The *Odes* say:
*"Though all may have a beginning,
few attain the end."*

Thus, the Sage desires not to desire,
and does not prize difficult-to-obtain treasures—
treasures such as gold, jade, pearls, and rhinoceros horn.

The common folk regard **not desiring** as a burden,
while the Sage finds it a joy.
The Sage values **tranquility, moderation, and self-restraint**,
while the common folk value **greed, selfishness, and extravagance**.
Therefore, what the common folk do not desire,
the Sage does desire—
and thus regards gold and jade as discarded soil.

**To not study when one should study**
is to repeat the errors of the masses.
The common folk **strain their innate nature** to pursue external learning,
and thus lose their **inherent true nature**.
The Sage **nurtures spontaneity without studying**,
and preserves the **harmony of their innate constitution**.

Yet the common folk consider **not studying** a fault,
while the Sage regards **not studying** as true learning—
hence, *"to repeat the errors of the masses."*

**To assist the natural unfolding of all things**
without presuming to act.
Human beings are born in stillness—
this is the nature of Heaven.

The Sage teaches **not to desire and not to study**
to aid the natural unfolding of all things,
so that each may fulfill its nature
without daring to contrive artificial deviations,
lest they lose their fundamental essence.

**To uphold without failure**
is to examine the subtle, unmanifest signs of joy and disorder,
without losing the **principles of lineage and the natural support of things**—
this was the **ancient Way of excellence**.

Thus, we follow the **ancient Way of excellence as Dao**.

Those who **excelled in the ancient Way of governing**
did not seek to enlighten the people,
but rather to **delude them**.

The ancient rulers who **excelled in the Way of governing themselves and transforming the people**
cultivated **sincerity within their own hearts**,
so that the Dao **permeated all things** while their governance remained unobtrusive,
and the people fulfilled their capacities without artificial praise.

They did not **flaunt their teachings and decrees**,
lest the people’s **joy and sorrow be manipulated** and deceitful scheming arise.
Instead, they sought to **guide the people back to simplicity and naturalness**.

This is the teaching of the **ancient Way of the Sage**,
offered as an exhortation for the present.

The difficulty in governing the people lies in their **excess of cleverness**.
When the people are too clever,
deceit arises first.
Though laws and decrees exist,
there is nothing to fear—
hence, they are **difficult to govern**.

Zhuangzi said:
*"If the ruler excessively favors cleverness without the Way,*
the world will fall into great disorder.
How do we know this is so?
When the cleverness of **bows, crossbows, and snares** abounds,
the birds above are thrown into chaos.
When the cleverness of **hooks, bait, nets, and traps** abounds,
the fish below are thrown into chaos.
When the cleverness of **snares, pitfalls, and nooses** abounds,
the beasts in the marshes are thrown into chaos.
When the cleverness of **deceit, poison, and sophistry**—
such as **‘firm and white,’ ‘separating filth from purity,’ ‘same and different’**—abounds,
the people are bewildered by confusion.
Thus, whenever the world falls into great disorder,
the fault lies in the love of cleverness."*

Therefore, **to govern a nation with cleverness is to ruin it**;
**to employ deceitful ministers to govern a nation**
is to **use cunning and schemes to undermine governance**,
and to **disturb and confuse the people**—
this is the **ruin of the nation**.

The *Classics* say:
*"When wisdom arises, great deceit follows."*
And again:
*"When governance is meticulous,*
the people become cunning."*

**Not to govern with cleverness is the nation’s blessing.**
**To employ virtuous and sincere ministers to govern a nation**
is to **practice non-action and simplicity**,
and to **bring the people peace and contentment**—
this is the **blessing of the nation**.

The *Classics* say:
*"I do nothing, yet the people transform themselves.
I take no action, yet the people grow wealthy."*
And again:
*"When governance is unobtrusive,*
the people are pure and sincere."*

「Du Guangting said: The ruler is like a mirror—
when the mirror is upright, its reflection is true,
when the mirror is crooked, its reflection is distorted.
If upright, the people follow and become upright;
if crooked, the people follow and become crooked.
The purity or corruption of the people is not determined by others.

To employ ministers of clever schemes,
the use of authority and stratagem will flourish,
to employ virtuous and loyal scholars,
the customs and teachings will become pure.

When the people are transformed in purity and harmony,
the nation prospers and thrives—
this is the blessing.

Understanding these two principles,
is to grasp the eternal model.

The two principles refer to
employing cleverness and not employing cleverness.

He who employs cleverness
harms governance and plunders the people—
he is the nation’s thief,
leading to the ruin of oneself and one’s family.
Thus, not employing cleverness
is the eternal model to be followed.

He who does not employ cleverness,
practices virtuous governance and benefits the people—
he is the nation’s blessing,
leading to honor for one’s clan and glory for one’s kin.
This is also the eternal model
to be followed by those who employ cleverness.

The ancient text reads *kǎishì* (稽式), *kǎi* (稽) meaning "to examine."
It refers to examining ancient models.

Always knowing the eternal model,
is called *Xuándé* (玄德, profound virtue).
*Xuán* (玄) means deep, obscure.

A ruler should know
that blessings can be entrusted to,
and thieves can be removed,
bringing the *Qínshǒu* (黔首, common folk) to wealth and longevity—
this is profound and obscure virtue indeed.

Profound virtue is deep, distant, and contrary to things,
only then does it reach the *Dàshùn* (大顺, Great Harmony).

The *Xuándé* (玄德) of the Sage
is deep beyond knowing,
distant beyond perception.
Yet when observing their words,
they seem to oppose the natural order of things,
but when examining their essence,
they align with the people’s path—
only then do they enter the realm of *Zìrán* (自然, spontaneity),
and nothing goes against it;
this is called *Dàshùn* (大顺, Great Harmony).

Yan Junping said:
The discernment of foolishness and cleverness
is without limit,
bringing peace to the heavens and tranquility to the earth,
like the *Yīnfú* (阴福, hidden blessings) of the cosmos,
unseen by the world—
thus it is called *Xuándé* (玄德, profound virtue),
deep beyond measurement,
distant beyond reckoning,
contrary to things,
and none can overcome it.

The *Liezǐ* (《列子》) says:
Emperor Yao governed the world for fifteen years,
and did not know whether the world was governed or not,
did not know whether the ten million myriads
wished to revere him or not.
He asked his attendants,
but they did not know;
he asked the outer court,
but they did not know;
he asked the commoners,
but they did not know.

Yao then dressed plainly and wandered through the bustling streets of Kang (康).
He heard children singing:
*"Establish us, the boiling masses,
none but you are the utmost.
We do not recognize you,
yet we follow the Sage’s Way."*

Yao rejoiced and asked:
*"Who taught you these words?"*
The children replied:
*"We heard them from the nobles."*
Yao asked the nobles:
*"This is an ancient poem."*

Yao returned to his court,
summoned Shun (舜),
and passed the throne to him through abdication.
Shun did not decline and accepted it.
This is called profound virtue,
deep and distant, reaching Great Harmony.

The adept in the Dao
does not act against the few,
their virtue and measure are profound and distant,
like rivers flowing toward the sea,
thus they are likened to the sea,
the king of all rivers.

The sea becomes the king of all rivers
because it excels in humility—
thus it can be the king of all rivers.

The *Kāiyuán Yùshū* (开元御疏) says:
The sea becomes the king of all rivers
because it dwells in the lowest flow.

The *Yì* (《易》) says:
*"The Earth’s Dao transforms fullness into humility,
and flows with modesty—
the Earth’s Dao uses humility,
and all rivers converge and flow toward it.
The Sage uses humility,
and the common folk come willingly without exhaustion."*

Yan Junping said:
The sea’s kingship
is not achieved by accumulating virtue,
piling up benevolence,
or offering favors to win their devotion—
nor is it through exalted rites,
broad deference,
or adorned wisdom to please them—
nor is it by employing unusual tactics,
establishing authority,
or wielding force and displaying might to control them.
Instead, it is through purity and stillness,
dwelling in humility,
waiting in emptiness,
with no action and no desire—
that all rivers come naturally.

The rivers do not come because they hear
the sea’s beauty or are transformed by its virtue—
nor are they bound by constraints,
guided by coercion.
Yet they pierce through gold and stone,
drill into cliffs,
soak into mountains,
and rush toward the sea without return—
this is the form conforming to nature,
the essence aligning with things,
and the natural course of all phenomena.

From this, we see
that humility as the Dao is vast indeed.

A hundred harms cannot injure it,
clever schemes cannot seize it.
It is strong without battle,
mighty without coercion.
Silent and without action,
it engages in mutual exchange with all things.

Valleys are low,
thus they can reach their end without exhaustion;
the sea dwells beneath,
thus it can reign without ceasing.

Therefore, the Sage desires to be above others,
yet speaks with humility.
The Sage refers to those who embody
the humility of the lowest flow—
they who wish to stand above others
must first humble themselves in speech,
knowing fullness invites loss.
Thus, they speak in humility and gentleness,
take the names of solitude and fewness,
and their great virtue grows daily,
their vast undertakings ever firm—
naturally, they are revered and elevated by all.

To lead others,
one must place oneself behind them.
To emerge first among all things,
one must humble oneself in body,
and be gentle in words.
Those who retreat behind others
are cautious in their conduct,
following the Dao,
not presuming to lead—
thus they are allowed by others to take precedence.

Therefore, though they dwell above,
others do not feel burdened;
though they stand before,
others do not feel harmed.
The Sage, when ascending the highest treasure,
occupying the utmost honor,
wearies one body while resting all people,
sparing themselves while enriching others—
yet the people all joyfully revere them,
as though they were light in their governance.
Thus, the people follow willingly,
and who could harm them?

Therefore, the world delights in pushing them forward
without exhaustion.
The ruler who follows the Dao,
even commoners flock to them,
as though drawn by the sun,
or praised like clouds.
As lord, they are never weary—
it is their virtue of humility and sincerity that brings this.

Because they do not contend,
none under heaven can contend with them.
Humility transforms the lower,
and the lower all become humble and retreat.
Thus, the Sage always takes emptiness as their body,
and non-action as their heart—
when heart and form are void,
what can contend with them?

Lu Xisheng said:
The Dao of Heaven
replenishes humility while diminishing fullness,
the Dao of Earth
transforms fullness into flowing humility,
spirits and gods
harm fullness while blessing humility,
and human conduct
abhors fullness while loving humility.»

The virtue of humility,
lowly yet self-nurturing,
thus the rivers and seas take humility as virtue,
and all streams flow toward them.

The Sage takes humility as virtue,
and is thus first in the world’s esteem.
Yet the Sage does not seek to be first—
the world delights in pushing them forward without exhaustion.

Rivers and seas dwell in the lowest flow,
the Sage-King abides in humility,
while the common practice favors strength and arrogance,
deeming passivity as unmanly.
Thus, they are ranked below those who say,
*"The world says my Way is vast—
yet I seem unworthy."*

The world says my Way is vast—
yet I seem unworthy.
*Worthy* means *resembling*.
Laozi said:
*"All under heaven speak of my Way as vast and boundless—
shining yet not dazzling,
abundant virtue like foolishness,
without form or likeness,
as though unworthy."*

Only because it is vast does it seem unworthy.
If it were worthy, long ago it would have diminished.
Only my Way, vast and boundless,
is not trusted by the lowly,
so it is called unworthy.
If it were praised,
long ago others would have extolled it—
why wait until now?
If my Way were praised by others,
how could it truly be vast?

Zhuangzi said:
Laozi told Master Chengqi:
*"The clever, wise, divine, and sagely—
I have long since freed myself from them."*

This is how Laozi has long valued
the unworthy over the praiseworthy.

As the saying goes:
*"Wuzi’s wisdom could be matched,
but his foolishness could not."*
This is close to the truth.

I have three treasures,
to preserve and uphold them.
Though my Way is vast and boundless,
without form or likeness,
there are three practices
to rely upon and hold fast—
truly the supreme treasures for self-cultivation and governance.
*(Referring to what follows.)*

The ancient text reads:
*"Hold them fast and treasure them."*
If the world follows these three practices as precious,
clinging to them without abandon,
what cannot they achieve?

The *He Shang Gong* version reads:
*"Hold them fast and preserve them."*

First: *compassion*,
second: *frugality*,
third: *not daring to lead the world.*

The *Kaiyuan Imperial Commentary* says:
To embody *ren* and act sincerely,
to love and nurture the people—this is *compassion*.
To use sparingly and enrich others,
without depletion—this is *frugality*.
Not to initiate actions,
to harmonize without leading—
this is *not daring to lead the world.*

Because of *compassion*, one is courageous.
Because of *frugality*, one is expansive.
Because one does not dare lead the world,
one can perfect tools and extend influence.

The Sage practices *compassion* as conduct,
courageous in aiding others—
the virtuous must be fearless.
The frugal in use
must be expansive in relief—
this is *"moderate use and love for people."*
Not daring to lead the world,
one can perfect tools and extend influence.

The *Yijing* says:
*"Seeing the dragon without head is auspicious."*
This is what is meant by
*"the Great Way seems unworthy."*

Li Yue said:
From the lowly, one ascends to the high—
thus one attains lordship over the world.

Now, abandoning *compassion* for *courage*,
abandoning *frugality* for *expansiveness*,

Abandoning the rear for the front—this is death.

Yet the world today does otherwise. Those deemed "worthy" are in fact contrary to the Way.

All abandon *compassion* and *virtue*, seeking instead *courage* and *righteousness*, reckless with *qi* and light in death, to ensnare others—this is the extreme peril of overreaching.

Unable to love and practice frugality, they instead indulge in extravagance, greedily seeking broad expenditure, plundering until resources are exhausted. They must inevitably harm finances and the people, thus inviting the calamity of scarcity.

Then, they adorn themselves with cleverness to astonish the ignorant, refine their conduct to expose filth, delight in leading others, and shame being last. Advancing without humility, retreating without restraint, their actions are bold yet unchecked—this is rebellion against the sovereign.

These three ways are not the enduring arts of the Great Way; they lead only to the ruin of family and self. Hence, it is said: *this is death.*

Now, *compassion*—when wielded in war, it brings victory; when held in defense, it secures strength.

Among the Three Treasures, *compassion* is most precious, hence its partial concealment as a flaw.

When a sovereign employs *compassion*, nurturing soldiers as one’s own, they become invincible beneath heaven.

For *compassionate* armies entering enemy lands do not trample crops, dig up graves, ravage stores, or burn dwellings. Instead, people welcome them as孝子 (filial sons) behold their benevolent parents. Those who surrender come like arrows loosed into deep valleys.

Thus, why must battles be fought in open fields before victory is won, or defenses fortified with gates and drums? Heaven itself will aid them, shielding with *compassion*.

For Heaven’s *Dao* rewards the virtuous and punishes the licentious. The virtuous are naturally blessed by Heaven, facing no adversity.

The *Classics* say:
*"Heaven’s *Dao* favors none—it aids only the virtuous."*

Thus Heaven aids them because their sovereigns and generals employ *compassion* and *virtue* to protect soldiers and people.

The Great Way seems unworthy, yet *compassion* and frugality appear unmartial—hence the next step: *the virtuous warrior is unmartial.*

The *virtuous warrior*—one who embodies *compassion* and *virtue*, punishes tyranny, relieves suffering, yet does not oppress the weak with brute force.

The skilled warrior does not rage in battle.
For those who master the battlefield, though armed, use force only when unavoidable. In confronting the enemy, they do not delight in slaughter. They treat war with the solemnity of mourning rites—how could they revel in anger and war?

The skilled victor does not contend.
For the skilled victor, triumph lies in *virtue*, not conflict. Armies conquer through harmony; harmony brings victory. They do not act from self-interest but follow the *Dao* to seize opportunity.

Like Zhu Zhonglian’s whistling or Xiong Yiliang’s ball-playing—these are the ways of the skilled victor.

The skilled ruler serves beneath others.
The skilled ruler employs humility, not force; delights in guiding the people, who forget their labor. Thus, using ministers as advisors, they are like limbs to the body; employing generals, they are obeyed with reverence, their chariots led by the sovereign’s hand. They lead with *virtue* before demanding strength.

This is the *virtue* of non-contention, the *virtue* of harnessing others’ strength, the *virtue* of aligning with Heaven—ancient perfection.

Those who excel as warriors, in battle, in victory, and in ruling—ever gentle, non-contending, humble in self-cultivation—exhaust the world’s potential and fully employ all. Is this not the *virtue* of non-contention, the strength of others?

If they lead with harmony, we respond in kind—like Heaven’s boundless grace arising from no favor, or the seasons moving without command. Thus they align with Heaven, governing in its place—this is the ultimate of ancient *Dao*.

The *virtue* of non-contention is the law of warfare, hence the next step: *the principles of warfare.*

**Principles of Warfare:**
Laozi lamented that the world’s armies take delight in war, so ancient military strategies are cited to warn against this.

I dare not be the aggressor, only the defender;
I dare not advance an inch, only retreat a foot.

Warfare’s aggressor is the attacker; the defender responds. The Sage’s army acts only when forced, thus always responding—always the defender.

Advancing little, retreating much—this is the art of deep strategy against superior foes.

Though enemies come, I rely on *Dao* rather than formation, thus avoiding conflict.

Again, the laws of deploying troops: the aggressor schemes through mobilization; the defender focuses on response. Though advances are few, they edge toward annihilation; though retreats are many, they turn toward survival. Thus, one must not dare to be the aggressor but the defender, not dare to advance an inch but retreat a foot—just as courage in daring leads to slaughter, while courage in restraint brings life.

This is called:
*"Marching without marching,
Repelling without arms,
Confronting without enemies,
Wielding without weapons."*

For the purpose of warfare is to halt the enemy, valuing non-contention. Though halting them, one harbors no intent to kill.

Since there is no killing intent, my army merely upholds *righteousness* in defense—thus *"marching without marching."*

Again, if generals must raise arms to charge first, it is as if they have no arms to raise—such is their aversion to killing and reverence for *compassion.*

Even if a tyrannical aggressor stirs rebellion, I respond with *cultural virtue* and display *righteous* armies. They will retreat upon hearing *righteousness*, naturally leaving no enemy. Though the threat of retaliation remains, there is no enemy to retaliate against—hence *"confronting without enemies."*

With the enemy withdrawn, arms are sheathed. Though the ritual of bearing weapons remains, there are no weapons to wield—hence *"wielding without weapons."*

No greater calamity exists than underestimating the enemy—underestimating the enemy risks losing one’s *Treasure.*

*Treasure* refers to life and position.

Underestimating the enemy means delighting in external warfare while neglecting internal defenses. Delighting in external warfare may yield victory or defeat, but neglecting internal defenses ensures ruin.

Though the Sage rules supreme beneath heaven, considering the times of order and chaos, enemies are many.

What then is meant by this?

The *Classic of Documents* states:
*"Caress me, and I will follow; oppress me, and I will become your enemy."*

If this is so, then even a single state or kingdom is my enemy, and even a single village or household is my enemy.

Thus, the sovereign who does not neglect even the lowliest minister will win the affection of all under heaven.
The noble who does not humiliate the widowed and orphaned will win the people’s affection.
The virtuous scholar who does not neglect self-cultivation will bring divine delight and heavenly harmony.

Only then can one safeguard what is most precious.

What does it mean to say *"near to losing my Treasure"*?

I am naturally merciful and do not delight in killing. If forced to confront an enemy, it is not my true intent. Since it is not my true intent, it is already a loss. Though the loss is not yet great, it is *"near to losing."*

Thus, when armies clash, the first to strike is victorious.
*"Ant"* (抗) means *"to raise."* When two states raise their armies against each other, the side that acts first prevails.

*"Pity"* (哀) is the expression of sincere mercy from the heart, arising from the ruler’s virtue. If the ruler retains a merciful heart, does not neglect the rites of governance, and the ministers below fulfill their loyalty, exhausting their duty to serve—then where can they fail to triumph?

Warfare warns against underestimating the enemy, but its words are easily understood. Therefore, I follow with my own teachings, which are even easier to understand and even easier to practice.

The *Classic* says:
*"Act without action."*
*"Know the world without leaving your door; know the Way without looking through a window."*
*"Practice the teaching of the unsaid."*

All these are the Way of *Wuwei*—simple and effortless within its proper scope. Though the words are not elaborate and the practice requires no labor, they are easy to know and easy to do.

Yet none under heaven can know them, none can practice them.

Those who cannot know them are the lesser scholars. The lesser scholars delight in petty disputes, cling to superficial arguments, and are easily confused by *having-for-nothing* (有为). They favor attacking heterodox views, unable to purge their minds, still their thoughts, or guard the One. They remain in darkness, unaware of the Way of *Wu*—vague and unable to act.

There is a principle in speech, a master in affairs. This explains why the easy-to-know and easy-to-do is so seldom attained.

*"Principle"* (宗) is the root, the sovereign. Though the hundred schools speak in different ways, they all converge on *li* (理, principle). Those who grasp *li* forget the words, so the ultimate principle of speech is *not-speaking*.

All affairs, though diverse in their paths, ultimately unite in *achievement*. When achievement is complete, the affairs are abandoned—thus, the master of affairs is *non-action*.

This is teaching through *non-speech* and *non-action*—how could it not be easy to know and easy to do?

Yan Junping said:
The Sage’s words root in *naturalness*, ancestral in *divine clarity*. They dwell in the inversion between speech and silence, subtle and wondrous, returning to *naturalness*. Their clarity is as if unseen, their hearing as if unheard—open yet seemingly blocked, penetrating yet seemingly exhausted. Their practice begins in *naturalness*, flows into the divine, and dwells in harmony between *action* and *inaction*. Pure, still, yielding, and weak, their movements are delicate and refined, simple and retiring, returning to *Wuwei*.

Only because they are without knowledge are they unknown to others.

The lesser scholars, blind in their ignorance, delight in parsing words and lost in debates over *solid-white* and *same-different*. Hearing the Dao of *non-speech* and *non-action*, they scoff and laugh in disbelief, deeming my Way great yet calling it unworthy.

Yan Junping said:
It is not that my Way is small or unworthy of knowledge, nor that my affairs are trivial or unworthy of action. Nor is it that the world delights in ruin, hates completion, loves calamity, and shuns rest—refusing to follow me.

Human nature opposes mine, desires conflict with mine. The wise are ensnared by desires, drowning in what they hear their whole lives, their *qi* and spirit unsettled, their hearts and intentions misaligned.

Few know me, thus I am honored.

The words of the ultimate Dao have a principle and a master—only the enlightened know them, hence their rarity and sparseness.

Those who attain this Dao are honored by all things, hence it is said, *"those who follow me are honored."*

The *Kaiyuan* edition reads: *"those who follow my Way are honored."*

Yan Junping said:
Thus, their clarity is not seen, their hearing not heard. Deep words return to receive slander, great deeds retreat to earn blame. The lone-seer’s clarity is useless in the world, the lone-hearer’s wisdom brings shame among the people. Those who align with divine clarity do not conform to convention, those whose achievements match the heavens and earth do not please the masses.

Thus, the Sage wears coarse cloth while harboring jade.
*"Coarse cloth"* (褐) is the garment of the lowly. Jade is pure and moist, likened to the virtue of the gentleman.

The Sage internally treasures virtue and power—this is likened to harboring jade. Externally, he lacks ornamentation—this is likened to wearing coarse cloth.

Thus, though his inner brilliance is vast, his outer appearance seems foolish and dim. Pearls are hidden in oysters, jade nestled in stone—none under heaven can know it, hence my Way is honored.

Since common folk presumptuously claim to know the Sage’s hidden knowledge, I follow with *"knowing the unknown."*

*"Knowing the unknown"* is virtue’s height.
*"Not knowing the known"* is a flaw.

The Sage, pure in *qi* and refined in nature, internally harbors true knowledge. All things are spontaneously understood, yet though capable of knowing, he does not boast in it—this is the highest virtue.

The middle and lesser scholars, coarse in *qi* and stubborn in nature, internally brimming with cunning, yet in their affairs they are arrogant and ignorant. Though they do not truly know, they forcefully argue, embellishing their words to feign knowledge—this is the flaw of virtue.

Zhuangzi said:
*"The unknown is profound; the known is shallow. The unknown is within; the known is without. This is what is called: ‘The knower does not speak; the speaker does not know.’"*

Only because of the sickness of sickness is there no sickness.

The Sage’s true knowledge and wondrous root penetrate the dim and obscure, thus he possesses the six penetrations and four openings, transcending above and below without fixed form. Tranquil and without burden, he yet constantly suffers.

The common folk mistakenly cling to the sickness of forced knowledge, often leading them into fatal traps from which they do not return—truly a matter for lamentation.

This reveals the Sage’s compassionate heart, alone able to cure afflictions.

The common folk suffer from this sickness of forced knowledge, yet how could they harm the Sage’s virtue? Thus, true knowledge is without affliction, while forced knowledge brings sickness.

The Sage is not afflicted because he cures affliction—this is why he is not afflicted.

The Sage alone knows the virtue of ignorance and the mechanism of the Dao, dimming his sharpness and abandoning his cleverness, truly free from worldly afflictions.

Compassionate and benevolent, he can cure the afflictions of all beings because he himself is without affliction.

If he had afflictions, how could he cure the afflictions of all beings?

Zhuangzi said:
*"No one can be weighed down by flowing water, yet people are weighed down by stagnant water. Only the still can still all things; receiving its mandate from the Earth, only the pine stands alone. Rectifying the winter and summer, its verdant hues endure; receiving its mandate from Heaven, only Shun stands alone. Rectifying his own life to rectify all lives, this is first rectifying oneself before rectifying others—just as the Sage does not suffer because he cures affliction."*

Forced knowledge loses the Dao, provoking calamity. When calamity comes yet the people do not fear, then the greatest fear arrives.

If the people do not fear the fear of Heaven or the fear of the state, then the greatest fear arrives.

The greatest fear is the omen of death.

The virtuous fear Heaven’s mandate, fear great men, and fear the words of the Sage.

For man, to establish oneself, fear must be the foundation. If one does not fear even small evils, they accumulate until the greatest fear arrives—inevitable and inescapable.

Yan Junping said:
*"When the greatest fear has arrived, one begins to do good. At this time, virtue and power cannot save, Heaven and Earth cannot resolve—this is not Heaven’s fault."*

Those who are high and secure, bearing the fear yet wielding power, forget care and lose fear, seeking nothing from themselves.

Thus, those who care for their own bodies do not fear others, those who fear themselves are not controlled by others, those who are cautious in small matters do not dread great ones, and those who restrain themselves near do not regret their distance.

Do not defile where you dwell.
*Ancient reading*: "狎" (*xiá*), meaning "habitual."
*Where you dwell*: refers to one’s conduct.
The cautious and fearful must choose good neighbors, avoid corrupt companions, maintain purity in self-guarding, and hold themselves in humility—then calamity cannot touch them. Their bodies remain whole, their spirits sovereign; this is the depth of fear and caution.

Do not narrow where you dwell.
*Kaiyuan Imperial Commentary*: "狭" (*xiá*), meaning to broaden one’s dwelling, not to forcefully confine oneself. It lies in harmonizing light and accommodating all, not clashing with things.

*Ancient reading*: "The dwelling of the spirit is the heart."
Man should forget emotions and abandon desires, softening his breast to let the spirit’s chambers rest, so that the spirit may dwell in the heart—then life is preserved.

Do not corrupt where you are born.
*Ancient reading*: "驮" (*tuó*), meaning "evil."
The form given by the Dao is what is meant by "where you are born."
Man should not corrupt the evil of his Dao; he should serve diligently, revere the great, fear the Dao and fear Heaven—then he can eternally preserve his primordial blessing.

If he indulges his desires, corrupts his Dao, and despises virtue, calamity will follow swiftly.

*Ancient reading*: "The spirit born from the body."
Man lives through the spirit; "where you are born" refers to the spirit.
The spirit, clear and luminous, prefers emptiness and stillness. If man washes his heart and calms his thoughts, the spirit returns of itself.
If he indulges in desires and debases his spirit, scheming to indulge his nature, then the spirit’s *qi* scatters and dissipates, and life is lost.

Thus, he is exhorted to not corrupt the spirit he was born with, to preserve the enduring Dao.

Only because one does not resist, is one not silent.

Only those who fear the Dao and fear Heaven are singularly precise and unified. In haste or leisure, they adhere to this principle—how could they have a heart for evil or laziness? Thus, the Dao’s hidden blessings descend upon them, granting a hundred auspicious signs. This is why they mutually cherish and protect, never exposing evil.

*Kaiyuan Imperial Commentary*: "Singularly precise and unified" are words from *The Book of Documents—Great Yu’s Model* (《尚书·大禹谟》), where Shun commands Yu to take his place.

Man’s heart is fraught with peril, the Dao’s heart is subtle—peril makes it hard to rest, subtlety makes it hard to discern. Only through singular precision and unity can one steadfastly grasp its center.

Thus, the Sage knows himself without revealing himself.
The Sage first preserves within himself, then within others. Examining his own heart’s origin, he knows his own virtues and vices.
Through cleansing and purging, he ensures no dust or filth enters his gates—this is called self-knowledge.
Having understood the Dao’s profound silence, he acts with movement day and night, not boasting of his talents or abilities, nor being confused by things, fearing to deviate from principle or act improperly—like those who do not fear the greatest fear.

He loves himself but does not exalt himself.
The Sage cherishes his own body, knowing it is the Dao’s creation. He does not indulge his appetites, nor does he wallow in evil and idleness, harming the utmost principle or diminishing his form and spirit—this is called self-love.
If one instead covets rich flavors and fine clothes, indulges in beauty and music, finds comfort in his nature, and delights his ears and eyes, exalting himself while despising others—this is defiling where he dwells and failing to maintain purity and stillness. How could this be one who fears and is cautious in the minutest matters?

Thus, he abandons that and takes this.
If one abandons the arrogant self-exaltation and takes the fear of the greatest fear—obtaining the principle of revering the Dao and serving Heaven without growing weary of others—then external punishments fade, and life’s Dao is internally sufficient.

He does not do evil for the sake of doing evil, nor seek courage for the sake of killing—
*Daoist True Classic: Treasury of Virtue and Power, Chapter Nine, "Perfection of the Dao"*
*Daoist True Classic: Treasury of Virtue and Power, Chapter Ten, "Refinement of the Dao"*

**Daoist True Classic: Treasury of Virtue and Power, Chapter Eleven, "Discernment of Courage and Boldness"**

Boldness in daring leads to killing;
Courage in restraint leads to life.
Firm resolve is courage,
Swift decisiveness is boldness.
The resolute and unyielding—
Fearless of threats, unflinching in action,
Relying on their ruthless obstinacy,
They strike and slaughter without hesitation—
Thus, boldness in daring leads to killing.

Yet the virtuous Daoist,
Discerning retreat and advance,
Moderate and yielding,
Soft and harmonious,
Dare not act recklessly,
Spare life and avoid harm—
Thus, courage in restraint leads to life.

To know these two paths—
One brings benefit, the other harm—
What Heaven abhors, who truly understands?
Hence, even the Sage finds this difficult.

These two refer to daring and restraint,
To killing and to life.

The greatest virtue of Heaven and Earth is *generation*.
The Sage takes compassion as substance,
Yet does not delight in killing.

Death is the bitterest poison to humanity;
All living beings abhor it.
Boldness in decisive action is the path of killing.
Courage in mercy and benevolence is the path of life.

If one clings rigidly to this principle without change,
They have yet to grasp Heaven and Earth’s authority over life and death.
If today’s actions bring benefit or harm,
It is because the choice between killing and life remains undetermined.

When one commits evil in plain sight,
Humans may punish them.
When one commits evil in secret,
Ghosts may slay them.
Even the Sage’s mercy,
Heaven’s benevolence—
Cannot pity or save them.
Yet if pardoned and spared,
Retribution’s calamity will surely follow.

There are those who *should* be killed and are killed,
Those who *should* live and are spared,
Those who *should* be killed but must not be,
Those who *should* live but must not be,
Those whose sparing brings misfortune,
Those whose killing brings blessing—
How so?

Yet what Heaven abhors,
Who truly knows its reason?
Unless one embodies the True Transformation,
How could one know the origins of calamity and blessing,
The roots of benefit and harm?
Even the Sage’s wisdom finds boldness and daring difficult—
How much more so for those who dare to act by private will?

Thus, it remains difficult.

**Yan Junping** said:
These two functions—
Courage and boldness, equally matched—
Yet their strategies diverge;
One strikes the body, the other defies it;
They oppose Heaven’s intent, contradict Earth’s will;
They unleash their passions, indulge their desires—
One may turn a thousand chariots into captives,
Another may rise from a commoner to king.
Thus, some are born to bring fortune,
Others to bring ruin;
Some are killed to bring blessing,
Others to bring disaster.
These two paths are profound—
None can fully fathom them.

The Dao of Heaven
Conquers without striving,
Naturally balanced, it does not resist the myriad things,
Yet the myriad things thrive on their own.
How could it compete with humans over daring or restraint,
Over killing or life?

Yet those who submit to it
Do not contend with things,
Yet conquer them well—
This is the courage and boldness of the uninjured field.

Silent yet responsive,
Heaven speaks not—
Yet the seasons march, the myriad things flourish,
And the rewards for virtue, the punishments for licentiousness,
Are never mistaken.
Unsummoned, they come.
Heaven’s Dao is vast and distant,
With no spoken teachings—
It never calls the myriad things,
Yet all face the sun and shun the shade,
Spring brings birth, autumn brings harvest—
This is the natural order of yin and yang’s life and death.
Mysterious yet wise in counsel.
The *Kaiyuan* and *He Shang Gong* versions read *"tanran"* (谭然).
Yan Junping’s version reads *"mò"* (默).
Wang Bi’s version reads *"tǎn"* (坦).

The Dao of Heaven is tranquil and silent, without favor or bias,
Its justice is absolute and unerring.
To those who act with virtue, it returns blessings of fortune,
To those who act with wickedness, it returns calamities of misfortune.
In its power over human affairs—life and death’s decree,
The patterns of *xiàngwěi* and celestial movements—
It never falters, never fails.
Is this not the wisdom of the Great Planner?

The Heavenly Net is vast and wide,
Though sparse, it never lets slip.
Stretched across the boundless void, it is called the Heavenly Net.
Its breadth and expanse are called *huánghuáng*—this is *liàn*.
Its reach into darkness and light, with no escape, is called *bù shī*.
Thus, the bold are slain,
Yet the common folk do not fear death—
Hence, the saying: *"the common folk do not fear death."*

For there are two meanings to "not fearing death":
The enlightened know its natural order and do not fear it.
The foolish lose sight of its natural order and yet do not fear it.

By Heaven’s nature, humans are born in stillness,
Yet delight in life and dread death—this is human nature.
They till the fields and eat,
They weave and wear,
They rest in their dwellings,
They take joy in their labors,
They nurture the living and bury the dead—
These are the customs of the world.

When the people abide by their natural ways,
And officials uphold their proper laws,
Without wrong or excess,
They meet their natural deaths.
If the people’s lives and deaths follow their natural course,
Then why should they fear it?

But when virtue declines,
And rulers cannot refrain from action,
Their nets and laws become dense and strict,
The people barely survive.
Theft and deceit arise,
They cheat the hungry and sow chaos.
The small fear trembles within them,
The great fear paralyzes them,
And they forget death.
How can severe punishments and cruel officials
Instill terror in the common folk?
The ancient text reads: *"How can one make the people fear death?"*

If the people were to fear death,
And yet still commit crimes,
I would seize and execute them—
Who would dare?

For fear of death also has two meanings:
Those who cherish life and act with caution
Fear Heaven’s judgment and seek virtue.
Those who commit evil and crave ease
Fear punishment and feign obedience to the law.

Moreover, by nature, humans
Abandon their burdens and walk freely,
Or lie at ease, drumming their bellies in leisure.
Lost in confusion, they know not of aging’s approach—
These are the people who follow the natural order.

Now, with laws and decrees multiplying,
Every movement risks death,
Thus the people are made to fear death.
When the people fear death,
They cling to life’s fleeting comforts,
And nurture treacherous, deceitful schemes
To evade the laws.
When deceit flourishes and calamities arise,
The officials seize and slaughter,
Severing the roots of evil—
Who would dare transgress?

The natural order executes those who execute.
He Shang Gong says:
*"Those who execute"* refer to Heaven’s high and distant gaze,
Judging the sins of those below.
The Heavenly Net is vast and wide—
It speaks of Heaven’s clear discernment, nothing unseen.
Why need there be harsh punishments and strict laws?

Du Guangting says:
*"Those who execute"* are the sovereign’s agents,
Great in nurturing life and loving the people.
In the *Nan Gong Dan Lu* scrolls, rewards are given for virtue,
And in the *Bei Guan Hei Lu* records, crimes are punished.
Heaven and Earth, with all their gods,
Oversee the deeds of good and evil,
To chastise and encourage,
So that evil may be abandoned and virtue cultivated.
Thus, those with merit are granted longevity,
Those with guilt have their years cut short,
No fraction lost—
Like the *Yángguān* officials in their meticulous reckoning.
Heaven has the *Sì Sī* stars that govern fate,
Positioned between *Xū* and *Wēi*,
Overseeing merit, demerit, lifespan—
This is Heaven’s execution of judgment.
It examines crimes and blessings obliquely,
So that all may know to cultivate virtue and avoid evil.

The ruler teaches with virtue,
And moves with compassion and forgiveness.
As for those who do not act virtuously,
Heaven’s executioners will slay them themselves.
The Heavenly Net is vast and forgiving,
Though sparse, it does not let slip.
To defy Heaven and reverse the Dao—
Where can one flee punishment?

To execute in Heaven’s place
Is like a clumsy carpenter taking the master’s tools.
To execute in Heaven’s place,
To wield judgment and rely solely on punishments,
To usurp the authority of *Zàohuà* over life and death—
This is like a clumsy man replacing a skilled artisan.

To take the master’s tools,
Few are those who do not harm their hands.
To replace a master artisan with a clumsy one,
Not only will the wood be ruined and the work spoiled,
But also hands will be injured and fingers broken.
This illustrates how rulers,
By usurping *Zàohuà*’s authority over life and death,
And recklessly applying their laws and punishments,
Not only harm the common folk,
But also sever the harmonious *héqì*.

For Heaven’s Dao is high and bright,
While human understanding is narrow and dim.
To have a ruler with limited wisdom
Usurp the place of Heaven’s boundless clarity,
And mislead the people in their natural order—
This is to lose the governance of nature.

The people do not fear death,
But only hunger.
Hence, the next phrase: *"the people’s hunger."*
The people’s hunger comes from their rulers’ excessive taxes—
Thus they starve.

The people are the foundation of the state.
When governance is burdensome, taxes grow heavy,
And the people’s poverty weakens the state’s roots.
Therefore, the ruler depends on the people for sustenance,
And the people rely on the ruler for stability.
If taxes are taken in excess, both ruler and people starve.
If the people are stripped bare while the ruler grows rich,
Both suffer ruin.

Du Guangting says:
*"The laws and decrees are clearly established in antiquity.
‘Food’ refers to the ruler’s provisions,
‘Taxes’ to the state’s revenues."*

「Hence, the tax of one-tenth (*shíyī zhī shuì*) must be light in its implementation. Heavy taxes impoverish the people, while light taxes ensure their sufficiency. When the people are well-provided, the state flourishes; when they are impoverished, the state is in peril. The principle lies in moderation—laws should not be too harsh. Thus, when rulers cast penal codes with severity, they provoke resentment; when they impose burdensome levies, the land grows poor. The Marquis of Qi (*Qī Hóu*) perished through excessive demands, while the Duke of Tian (*Tián Shì*) became a hegemon through generous grants. Let the enlightened ruler take heed of these lessons.

The people are difficult to govern because their rulers act excessively—thus they are difficult to govern. Excessive action leads to burdensome governance; non-action brings simplicity. Simplicity is easy to follow, while complexity is hard to govern. When the ruler indulges in fine jade and lavish meals, the common folk delight in coarse grains and husks. Strict nets of law and harsh decrees make governance difficult. The people grow indifferent to death because their pursuit of life is so desperate—thus they become reckless with death. When governance is oppressive, taxes and levies are heavy, and the people lose their means of livelihood, they then transgress laws and break prohibitions, readily facing death. This is because their desperate search for sustenance leads them to disregard danger, even to wade through water and fire without fear or to confront blades without hesitation—hence, they are said to treat death lightly.

Only those who do not cling to life are truly wiser than those who do. Those who greedily chase life and profit are like sheep running to the slaughter, hastening their own demise. Yet there are those who outwardly forget life’s concerns: they endure hardship without humiliation, eat humble fare yet find it sweet, and though the world’s affairs may be tumultuous, they remain tranquil and at ease. This is how they differ from those who cling to life.

Clinging to life is both a blessing and a curse—it nourishes life, yet also becomes a self-inflicted burden. Those who value life excessively are driven by bodily comfort, craving for rich flavors, fine garments, and pleasing colors; they seek harmonious sounds, and if denied, they grow anxious and fearful, even to the point of blaming others and recklessly inviting death. When the people are hungry, their spirits scatter and they grow indifferent to death; when they are well-fed, their bodies and minds are whole and they cherish life—thus the next phrase: *"the people’s life is soft and frail."*

The people’s life is soft and frail, yet their death is firm and resolute. When alive, the people absorb the *yuánhé* Dao’s *qi* and embrace the *zhēnyī* essence’s vitality, their bodies and spirits whole—thus their limbs are soft and frail. But when they die, the *yuánhé* *qi* disperses, the *zhēnyī* essence is exhausted, their forms decay and their spirits vanish—thus their limbs become firm and rigid.

All things, grasses and woods alike, are soft and pliable when alive, yet dry and brittle when dead. When alive, they are nourished by the *qi* of heaven and earth flowing within, and by the *yīnyáng* fluids moistening without—thus their spring shoots are tender and can be bound, their summer leaves flourish and can be woven, a display of their softness. When they die, the *qi* of heaven and earth dissipates within, and the *yīnyáng* fluids wither without—thus their autumn fruits turn crimson and fall, their winter branches wither and can be snapped, a sign of their brittleness.

The ancient sage understood this principle well—this is the act of the ruthless. The ruthless see life and death as mere gathering and scattering of *qi*. The enlightened understand life and death as the preservation or loss of Dao. Thus, the firm and resolute are the followers of death, while the soft and frail are the followers of life.

The *Kāiyuán* commentary states: *"Grasses and woods are soft and pliable when alive, firm and brittle when dead. Thus, for those who act with firmness and rigidity, they are the followers of death; for those who act with softness and frailty, they are the followers of life."*

Yán Jūn Píng said: *"Where the yang *qi* resides, even wood can be woven and grass can be bound. Where the yang *qi* departs, water can freeze and ice can shatter. Thus, the enlightened yang *qi* is the root of life, and softness and frailty are the medicine for all things. Softness and frailty are the means of gentle growth, while the enlightened yang *qi* is what sustains them. All things follow the yang *qi* in their softness and frailty, so the firm and rigid are the true likeness of death, while the soft and pliable are the true likeness of life. Hence, when armies are strong, they cannot prevail."*

Yù Zhēn said: *"War is an instrument of violence and a tool of conflict, a realm where one encounters the enemy in battle. When armies are strong, the ruler becomes complacent while the generals grow arrogant; when generals are arrogant, the soldiers grow reckless. A complacent ruler faces arrogant generals, while arrogant generals confront reckless soldiers—defeat is inevitable before victory can even be pursued. Thus, Jié and Zhòu, despite their armies of a million each, were overthrown across the four seas; Qīn Shǐhuáng, despite his unified empire, lost all nine regions; Xiàng Yǔ rose as hegemon yet perished swiftly; Wáng Mǎng usurped the throne and was destroyed in turn. Fú Jiān met disaster at the Huái River, while Suí Yáng was shattered at the Chu Palace—these rulers all commanded armies numbering in the tens of millions, or even hundreds of millions, yet none could rely on their strength to secure victory. These are clear proofs that strong armies do not prevail."*

Moreover, conquering the enemy is not difficult; maintaining victory is the challenge. Only the ruler who follows the Dao can hold onto victory. The defeats of these past rulers all stemmed from their inability to maintain victory.

Wood is strong in its trunk and roots, yet its branches and leaves are soft and pliable, bearing fruit above. The *Kāiyuán* commentary states: *"Wood is inherently strong and sturdy, so its roots and trunk remain firm and low, while its branches and leaves, soft and weak, bear fruit above. This is because the soft and pliable are positioned above, while the strong and rigid remain below."*

The strong and sturdy are at the base, while the soft and pliable are above. Wood’s strong trunk and roots always reside below, its soft branches and tender leaves always above. If wood behaves thus, how much more so for humans, for nations! When the vital *qi* of life persists, the people are soft and frail—this is the Dao of humility. Heaven’s Dao favors humility, hence the next phrase: *"the Dao of Heaven."*

The Dao of Heaven is like drawing a bow. The *Kāiyuán* commentary states: *"Heaven’s Dao is vast and lofty; no analogy can clarify it better than the method of drawing a bow, which reveals Heaven’s virtue in action. The high must be lowered, the low must be raised; the excessive must be diminished, the deficient must be supplemented."* The *Kāiyuán* commentary further explains: *"The bow’s purpose is to combine materials and set its form, ensuring that its slackness and tension are balanced, its high and low adjusted—this is the standard for shooting arrows."*

「Adjusting the excessive and supplementing the deficient is for determining the distance of the shot—whether the arrow will hit its mark or fall short. Thus, it achieves its target, and the discussion returns to the Dao of Heaven. The *Yì* [《易》] states: *"The Dao of Heaven is established in the interplay of yin and yang. Yang governs ascent, yin governs descent; when yang ascends to its utmost in Heaven, it descends; when yin descends to its utmost in Earth, it ascends. This is the symbol of restraining the high and elevating the low, as in drawing a bow."* The yin-yang cycles of Heaven’s Dao—seven interludes of fullness and emptiness—adjust the excess of the day and supplement the deficiency of the moon. The sun’s heat and moon’s chill, one advancing and one retreating, thus complete the year’s work.

A wise ruler should follow Heaven’s Dao: restraining the strong and aiding the weak, diminishing excess and augmenting deficiency. Hence, the emphasis on *kuī* [亏, deficiency] and *yíng* [盈, fullness], on *jiàn* [谦, humility], to ensure that all measures are balanced and applied with fairness.

Yán Jūn Píng [严君平] remarked: *"When craftsmen make a bow, they ensure neither over-tightness nor slackness, neither excessive compression nor tension. They shape it with compass and square, guide it with plumb line. If the string is too high and taut, they loosen and relax it; if too low and slack, they gather and raise it. Where there is excess, they trim and diminish; where there is deficiency, they reinforce and add. The string’s tension and the bow’s body harmonize, the upper and lower parts balance, equanimity as their core, accord as their norm—thus the bow can measure weight and the arrow can fly true."* To restrain the high and elevate the low, to diminish the great and augment the small, is the Dao of Heaven and Earth.

Heaven’s Dao supplements the deficient and diminishes the excessive, but human affairs do the opposite: diminishing the deficient to serve the excessive. The *Kāiyuán* commentary [开元御疏] states: *"This clarifies that human affairs cannot match Heaven’s Dao of augmentation and diminution, but instead favor the many at the expense of the few."* In the *Yì* [《易》], when one *kuī* [亏, diminishes] the lower and augments the upper, it is called *kuī* [损]. When one diminishes the upper and augments the lower, it is called *yì* [益], and the lower is taken as the foundation. Diminishing the lower while augmenting the upper—its Dao proceeds upward—thus in the *Tài* hexagram [泰卦], when one diminishes the lower and augments the upper, the transformation yields *kuī* [损]. Diminishing the upper while augmenting the lower—the people rejoice without bound—thus in the *Pǐ* hexagram [否卦], when one diminishes the upper and augments the lower, the transformation yields *yì* [益]. This is the method by which the Sage established the hexagrams and observed their symbols.

Who, then, could withhold excess to serve all under Heaven? Even those who claim to follow the Dao.

This is a rhetorical question, elaborating its meaning. The question asks: *"Who can align with Heaven’s Dao of descending to aid the people, sacrificing their own excess of rank and wealth to provide for the poor and needy of all under Heaven?"* The answer states: *"Only the Daoist sage, the virtuous ruler, and the wise philosopher can do so."* The term *"deliver"* [奉] emphasizes that the Sage-ruler, though elevated, never forgets the lowly—just as the humble serve the exalted without claiming superiority. Thus, the Sage acts without arrogance, achieves without clinging, and does not desire to be called virtuous.

The Sage is *yuán tōng* [圆通, omniscient and adaptable], using the Way as wisdom and adapting to circumstances as their heart. They order all things without claiming righteousness, nourish all ages without claiming benevolence, endure from ancient times without claiming longevity, and shape the myriad forms of existence without claiming cleverness. How could they boast of their own deeds, pride themselves on their virtues, or, upon completing their work, insist on retaining their position? Only by not clinging and not claiming can they lead the humble like the master of the *wéi* [韦, coarse] materials.

Heaven’s Dao augments the few and diminishes the excess, restraining the high and elevating the low—only the Daoist sage can embody this principle of humility. Hence, the next point: *"Under Heaven, nothing is as soft and weak as water."* Though water is the softest and weakest of all things, it can overcome the hardest and strongest—nothing can replace it. Among all things under Heaven, water is the most soft and weak, yet it pierces metal and stone, conquering the hard and strong with no rival.

Again, consider humanity: water can be blocked by dams, directed by channels, contained by dikes, and diverted by obstacles—high, low, perilous, or muddy, it flows in countless ways. Yet because of its soft and weak nature, it remains unaltered in its essence. Thus, softness overcomes hardness, and weakness overcomes strength—all under Heaven know this, yet few can practice it. Everyone knows that water extinguishes fire, yin subdues yang, the tongue is soft yet preserves, while the teeth are hard yet break—these are common truths. Yet people follow their own desires and cannot embody the Dao of softness and weakness. Hence, Lǎozi [老子] sighed deeply, and he cited the Sage’s words to illustrate the practice of softness and weakness.

Therefore, the Sage said: *"To bear the defilement of the state is to be called the Lord of the Soil and Grain."* The Sage’s words—whether the remnants of the *Sān Bēn* [三坟] or Lǎozi’s humble phrasing—teach that a ruler can accept the blame of the state, taking upon themselves all the faults of the people. If one person bears the guilt, the myriad cannot be burdened, then the people will look up in admiration and not scatter. Thus, they can perpetually serve the Soil and Grain as their sovereign.

The *Hóng Liè Jiě* [《鸿烈解》] recounts: *"When Jin attacked Chu, the army did not advance despite three withdrawals. The officials urged the king to strike. King Zhuang [庄王] said: 'In my father’s time, Jin did not attack Chu. Now, in my reign, Jin attacks Chu—this is my fault. How can I bring shame upon the state?' Wèi Dàfū [韦大夫] replied: 'In my father’s time, Jin did not attack Chu. Now, in my reign, Jin attacks Chu—this is my fault. I beg the king to strike.' The king wept bitterly, his tears flowing like rain, then ascended and bowed to Wèi Dàfū. When the people of Jin heard this, they said: 'The ruler and his minister both claim the fault as their own, and the king even humbles himself before his subject—we cannot attack such a state.' That night, they retreated and returned home."* This is an example of *"bearing the defilement of the state"*—the first instance of *"the Lord of the Soil and Grain."*

When founding a state, emperors and kings place the ancestral temple on the left and the Soil and Grain altar on the right. The ancestral temple honors the ancestors and aligns with Heaven; the Soil and Grain altar honors agriculture and the harvest. The *bèi* [备] and *qì* [弃] hexagrams [卦] signify the abundance that sustains the people’s livelihood—food is the foundation of life. Since food is essential to humanity, a state must first establish its Soil and Grain altar, and the ruler must serve as its guardian.

To bear the defilement of the state is to be called the *"King of All Under Heaven."* If a ruler can practice humility and softness, bearing the state’s ills without complaint, then all under Heaven will return to benevolence, and the six directions will rest in harmony—they are the *"King of All Under Heaven."* The commentary states: *"Mountains and rivers accept filth, and so too should a ruler bear defilement."*

「The *Hóngliè Jiě* [《鸿烈解》] states: During the time of Duke Jing of Song [宋景公], the wandering star [荧惑] was in the constellation of the Heart [心], and the Duke, fearful, summoned Zi Wei [子韦] and asked: *"What does the wandering star in the Heart portend?"*

Zi Wei replied: *"The wandering star is a Heavenly punishment [天罚]. The Heart is the Song realm’s celestial division [宋分野]. The calamity will soon fall upon the ruler. Though it may be transferred to the prime minister [宰相], such a deed would be inauspicious."*

The Duke said: *"The prime minister governs the state [治国家], and transferring death to him would be unpropitious."*

Zi Wei replied: *"It may be transferred to the people [民]."*

The Duke said: *"If the people die, who will serve as my subjects?"*

Zi Wei replied: *"It may be transferred to the year [岁]."*

The Duke said: *"The year is the people’s life [民之命]. If the year brings famine, the people will surely perish. As a ruler, to kill the people to save myself—who would still recognize me as their sovereign?"*

*"My fate is already sealed,"* the Duke declared, *"do not speak further."*

Zi Wei bowed twice and said: *"I dare congratulate you, my lord. Heaven is exalted yet hears the lowly, and you have spoken words befitting a ruler [君人之言]. Three times you have borne this punishment, and three times the wandering star will shift its course. Tonight it will move three stages [三舍], each stage seven *lǐ* [里], and thus your life will be extended by twenty-one years. I beg leave to lie in wait beneath your throne this very evening to observe it."*

Indeed, the star shifted three stages that night.

This is the *"bearing the state’s ills"* [受国不祥], the *"King of All Under Heaven"* [天下王].

Words are reversed in meaning.

He who practices **softness and weakness** [柔弱] may become a ruler [君主], but he who relies on **rigidity and strength** [刚强] will invite disaster.

The **Sage** [圣人] bears defilement and evil, yet eternally preserves the **Great Auspiciousness** [元吉].
The common folk delight in beauty and honor, yet ultimately meet ruin.

*"Bearing the state’s ills"* [受国不祥] aligns with the **Way** [道], yet the people’s hearts remain unfulfilled. Thus, it follows with *"harmonizing great grudges"* [和大怨].
To harmonize great grudges is to leave lingering grudges behind.

If a ruler cannot govern with **effortless humility** [无为谦弱], the people will grow greedy and contentious, leading to reckless youths who block the roads [道卫], their arms raised in defiance. Then the ruler must establish teachings and laws to restrain them—*those who kill shall die, those who wound shall be punished*.

To respond to grudges with harmony is to turn their resentment into greater resentment. It is better to have no grudges than to have grudges and yet respond with harmony.

To know only how to harmonize great grudges, yet not understand how these grudges arise in the first place—even if one responds with utmost fairness [至公], lingering grudges will remain.
This is like a carpenter’s apprentice [大匠] cutting wood; few will escape harming their hands.

But if one responds with **heartless virtue** [无心至德], it is nearly as if one were creating the world anew.
How then can one speak of goodness?

The **Sage and Worthies** [圣贤] originally used punishment and governance to harmonize grudges and evil, yet how can one speak of goodness when deceit and treachery only grow worse, and resentment and longing increase?

Thus the **Sage** holds the **left token** [左契], yet does not blame the people.

Lü Xīshēng [陆希声] said: *"In ancient times, people tied knots for agreements, yet none deceived; when they split wood for tokens, none violated them. This was because the Sage had no fixed intentions of his own—he took the people’s hearts as his own."*

The Sage’s heart and the people’s hearts were as inseparable as the **left and right tokens** [左右契].
When tokens were presented, they were united in trust, and the Sage did not blame the people. Thus, ruler and subject grew close, and grudges never took root.

Lǐ Róng [李荣] said: *"In ancient times, the Sage carved wooden tokens—rulers held the left, ministers the right—and united them as a pledge of trust. No further laws were needed, so the Sage did not blame the people. If he did not blame them, how could grudges arise?"*

Thus, the **virtuous** [有德] held tokens to ensure **harmony** [契], while the **unvirtuous** [无德] held the **right tokens** [彻].
**彻** [彻] means **permeation** [通], the **Way** [道].
**司** [司] means **to govern** [主].
The **virtuous** refers to rulers of the **Middle Ages** [中古], who had no written laws, only carved tokens and matching symbols as pledges of trust. The people followed of their own accord, so they were called **virtuous**.

The **unvirtuous** refers to rulers of the **Far Antiquity** [远古], whose virtue was so vast it had no name. All things followed their natural course—dwelling in caves, nesting in trees, each content in its place. Their rulers had no schemes or thoughts; they appeared alone at dawn, and this was not considered neglect. Their virtue was profound and their Way mysterious—no tokens were needed for governance, only to ensure **permeation** [通彻] was upheld. Thus they were called **unvirtuous**.

This is the saying of Du Guāngtíng [杜光庭].
The old saying held that **彻** [彻] meant **traces** [迹], or that it meant **establishing norms** [作轨]. But if laws are enforced to guide the people, they will bring exhaustion and decay—hence the term **unvirtuous**.

Now, **permeation** [通] is the more enduring interpretation.

Heaven’s **Way** [道] has no favorites—it aligns with those who are good.
Heaven’s **Way** has no bias—it bestows itself only upon the good, as the saying goes: *"The Heavenly net is vast and wide, though its mesh seems sparse, yet nothing escapes."* [天网恢恢，疏而不失]

Thus, those who practice **great goodness** [上善] naturally find their ways in accord.
Why would they need tokens or laws to blame the people?

This is the **Way** of the **Far Antiquity** [太古] once more.

To harmonize grudges is to leave grudges unresolved; to **cease grudges** [息怨] is to govern with **non-action** [无为].
To govern with **non-action** is to dwell in **smallness** [小] yet not covet, hence it follows with *"small state, few people"* [小国寡民].

In a **small state with few people**, even if they possess **tenfold or hundredfold tools** [什伯之器], they will not use them.
**什** [什] means **five** [伍], **伯** [伯] means **long** [长], and **器** [器] refers to **materials and tools** [材器].

A small state can defend itself; few people can sustain themselves.
This is the return to the **Far Antiquity** [太古].

Let the people have **units of five and ten** [部曲什伯], and command them to respect their ranks without encroaching upon one another.
Because the ruler governs with **non-action**, the people’s livelihoods flourish, and their materials and tools become grand and wondrous, yet unused.
This is the **ultimate governance** [至治].

Let the people **cherish life** [重死] and **not wander far** [不远徙].
If a ruler governs with **non-action**, his **virtue and transformation** [德化] will be pure.
If the people are simple and unadorned, they will not lightly court death—**rooted in their origins** [崇本], they will **abandon superficiality** [弃末].
They till the fields and weave cloth, each clinging to their ancestral homes and not straying.
Even the **Xuanhuang** [轩皇] and **Jiǔ** [几蘧] of old could not surpass this governance.

Though **boats and carriages** [舟舆] exist, they are unused.
*Wooden boats are hollowed to cross water*—this is for distant travel.
Yet this is for distant travel.
Now, for rulers who uphold the **Way**, in large states they seek only to **shelter the people** [兼畜人], in small states they seek only to **have the people serve them** [入事人].
They do not encroach upon one another, nor do they engage in trade.
Though they possess boats and **straight paths** [直], they abandon them and do not use them.

Zhuāngzǐ [庄子] said: *"In the age of **Great Virtue** [至德], mountains had no paths or tunnels, marshes had no boats or bridges. All things thrived in their natural state—this was the **Way** of their homeland."*

Though **armor and weapons** [甲兵] existed, they were never employed.
Weapons were originally set up to **punish treacherous ministers** [讨逆臣] and **ward off bandits** [御乱寇].」

「When the ruler acts with **non-action** [無為], the subjects observe their duties, the people do not stray, and the four borders remain at peace—then **armor and weapons** [甲兵] are not needed.

Let the people return to the use of **knotted cords** [結繩] for record-keeping.
The *Commentary on the Changes* [《系辞》] states: *"In the ancient times, knotted cords were used to govern affairs; later, the sages replaced them with writing and inscriptions."*
In the age of knotted cords, all were pure and simple.
Once writing was introduced, deceit and falsehood grew daily.
Now, to restore the people to their original simplicity and purity,
the ruler must make them return to the use of knotted cords.

Let their food be simple yet satisfying,
their clothing plain yet comfortable,
their dwellings humble yet secure,
and their customs joyful yet unadorned.
When the ruler above has no desires, the people below naturally become simple.
If their tastes are not indulged, the people will know contentment.
Even coarse vegetables and plain broth will fill their bellies with sweetness,
while hemp garments and deer-hide cloaks will keep them warm without finery.
Reed huts and wattle-and-daub walls will shield them from wind and rain,
and the torrid southern heat or the bitter northern cold will be endured with ease.
Thus, their customs remain unspoiled by artificiality,
and their land is free from pestilence and disease.

Neighboring states may be in sight,
and the sounds of roosters and dogs may be heard across borders—
yet the people live out their lives without ever visiting one another.
Neighboring states in sight means the territories are contiguous.
Roosters and dogs heard nearby means the people are plentiful and the lands close.
The people live until old age without ever facing enemies—
this is to say they are free from war and die of natural causes.
Their lack of interaction is like fish forgetting each other in rivers and lakes,
or people forgetting each other in the **Dao/Way** and its arts—
this is the harmony of the **Huxu and Lu tribes** [赫胥尊、卢氏] of ancient times.

When the people know contentment, their words are sincere yet unadorned,
so next comes the principle: *"Sincere speech is not beautiful."*
Sincere speech is plain and without flavor—like water.
Water’s plainness allows it to endure;
its lack of adornment is its natural quality.
Beautiful speech is sweet and overindulgent—like fine wine.
Sweetness makes it fleeting;
its lack of sincerity lies in its excess.
The **good** [善] do not argue,
while the argumentative are not **good**.
The **good** value inner virtue and noble action,
while those who do not argue return to their original simplicity.
The eloquent value persuasion,
while the unvirtuous are mired in right and wrong.
The wise are not learned in many things,
while the learned are not truly wise.
The wise understand the **Dao/Way**—
they grasp principles and roots,
seizing only what is essential.
Why need they be learned in many things?
This is called **"sufficiency"** [少則得].
The *Sutra of the Western Ascension* [《西升经》] says:
*"He who attains the One fulfills all things,
and without clinging, the spirits and gods submit."*

The learned are those who exhaustively study varied doctrines,
seeking only to prove their own views.
The unwise are those who accumulate knowledge only to be confused by it.
Zhuāngzǐ [庄子] said: *"When **virtue/power** [质] is lost to **learning** [文], and **learning** is pursued to excess, the mind drowns in partial truths."*

The sages do not hoard.
Having given to others, they grow ever more abundant;
having bestowed upon others, they grow ever wealthier.
Hoarding means storing and accumulating.
The sages’ **Dao/Way** benefits all under heaven,
yet they do not hoard **virtue/power** [德] to elevate themselves.
They accumulate yet also scatter,
nor do they store wealth to enrich themselves.
They neither delay their works externally
nor gather their wisdom internally—
both are harmonized, hence they are called **"non-hoarding"** [不積].
Zhuāngzǐ [庄子] said:
*"The **Dao/Way** of Heaven flows without accumulation,
thus all things flourish.
The **Dao/Way** of the **Sage Emperor** [帝道] flows without accumulation,
thus all under heaven is united.
The **Dao/Way** of the sages flows without accumulation,
thus all within the seas submit."*

The sages do not hoard because
they manifest **moral virtue** [道德] for the people.
The people receive their benefits, and the sages’ **virtue/power** [德] becomes ever clearer—
like a **weight of gold** [镒] illuminating others without concealing its own goodness or ill-will,
yet its brilliance never diminishes.
This is the metaphor for inner wisdom.

They distribute wealth to the poor,
and the poor, receiving their bounty, find their abundance ever greater—
like a well that endures constant drawing,
benefiting all without depletion,
yet its waters remain pure and inexhaustible.
This is the analogy for external works.

The opening chapter of the upper section
clarifies that the **Dao/Way** is the fundamental teaching,
and its body aligns perfectly with its subtlety.

The closing chapter of the upper section
expounds that **non-action** [無為] is **non-inaction** [無不為],
revealing the essence of the teaching,
and its application suits the **Dao/Way**.

Thus, the form and use are both forgotten,
and the beginning and end are seamlessly connected.

The opening chapter of the lower section
explains that **"having virtue/power" [有德] and "lacking virtue/power" [無德]** are the responses to teaching,
following the **Way**’s purification and refinement of the times.

The closing chapter of the lower section
uses the contrast of *"sincere speech"* [信言] and *"insincere speech"* [不信言]
to demonstrate the teaching’s application,
allowing things to manifest naturally as adorned or plain,
and thus conforming to the **Dao/Way**.

Therefore, by adapting to the times and allowing things to unfold naturally—
without opposing or contending—
it is to uphold their original **virtue/power** [元德]
and to align with **Creation** [造化],
to restore the **Dao/Way**’s constancy
and enter its **mysterious gate** [妙门].

The *True Classic of the Dao and Virtue* [《道德真经》] concludes the tenth scroll of the *Cherished Obscurity* [藏室慕微] section.»
