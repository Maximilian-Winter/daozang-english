**Preface to *The Supreme Lord Lao’s Exalted Scripture on Constant Purity and Tranquility***

I humbly observe: To transform through the great is called sageliness; to transform through the sagely in unfathomable ways is called the numinous. The numinous sageliness of the Supreme Lord Lao resides at the inception of primordial chaos, serving as the origin of the myriad *qi*, his transformations beyond all reckoning.

Tracing the records, we find:
In the era of the first Three Sovereigns, he was the Celestial Master of the Myriad Teachings;
In the middle Three Sovereigns, he was Master Pangu;
In the age of the Later Heavenly Sovereign, he was Yu Hua Zi;
During the reign of Shennong, he was known as Da Cheng Zi.

By the time of the Yellow Emperor, he appeared as the Master of Kongtong Mountain, styled Guang Cheng Zi, and transmitted the Dao to the Yellow Emperor.
In the age of Shaohao, he transformed as Sui Ying Zi;
Under Zhuanxu, he was Chi Jing Zi;
During Emperor Ku, he was Lu Tu Zi;
In the time of Emperor Yao, he was Wu Cheng Zi;
Under Emperor Shun, he was Yin Shou Zi;
In the era of Yu of Xia, he was Zhen Xing Zi;
During the reign of Tang of Shang, he was Xi Ze Zi.

Though he manifested across successive ages, no trace of his birth was recorded. Only in the reign of King Yangjia of Shang did he divide his form and transform his *qi*, entering the womb of the Mysterious Wondrous Jade Maiden for eighty-one years. On the fifteenth day of the second month in the *gengchen* year of King Wuding’s reign, at the hour of *mao*, he was born in Qu Ren Village of Lai District, Ku County in Chu. His mother grasped a plum tree, and he emerged from her left side, his hair and beard already hoary, his countenance like that of a child. Thus, he took Li as his surname, was named Er with the courtesy name Boyang, and was posthumously styled Dan, known as Laozi.

In the time of King Wen of Zhou, he served as Archivist of the Royal Treasury; under King Wu, he was promoted to Historian Beneath the Pillars. He embraced simplicity, held to the uncarved, diminished thought, and restrained desire.

Holding to the ancient Dao to govern present realities;
The hidden Dao goes unmanifest, the humble virtue remains unseen;
Internally, one consolidates the true and nourishes life;
Externally, one distances harm and preserves the body.
Mastering antiquity and comprehending the present, no principle remains obscure.

To the east, he instructed Confucius, eliciting the sigh of "like a dragon";
To the west, he transformed as the Golden Immortal, and the earth resounded with the lion’s roar.
He expounded the *Five Thousand Words of the Dao and Virtue*, bestowing them upon Yin Xi.
Through successive ages, he manifested transformations to propagate the Dao and its teachings.

Perceiving that worldly people, lost in greed and delusion, had strayed from their original true nature,
he composed the *Classic of Purity and Stillness*, making it the foremost of all scriptures.
Its words are simple yet its Dao profound,
revealing the causes of life and death,
reviving the mystic wind,
guiding people toward the Dao,
and leading them to comprehend the principle of the three lives and the truth of undying through ten thousand kalpas.

I have long studied this classic but failed to grasp its essence.
Recently, through my teacher’s enlightenment, my heart was opened,
and I readily attained the true and constant origin of creation.
Only then did I recognize the subtlety of Fuxi’s trigrams
and understand the praise of the Sage Confucius for the *Book of Changes*.
Probing the Golden Immortal’s prajñā wisdom, it aligns perfectly like tallying tokens.

The Supreme One’s sageliness transcends life and death, standing alone,
spanning past and present without peer.
Thus, the hundred kings took him as their model, and successive sages transmitted his teachings.
Those who deem it a doctrine of emptiness and heterodoxy
are those who, lacking the sagely method, oppose the Sage.

The Dao is not distant from humanity; it is people who distance themselves from the Dao.
Those who attain it may transform the foolish into the wise, the turbid into the clear.
Those who cultivate it may transmute stone into gold, the ordinary into the sagely,
rising beyond the three realms to become eternal Upper Immortals—how wondrous indeed!

With my limited insight, I have taken this scripture,
annotated each section with the words of former sages and worthies,
and compiled diagrams to interconnect the commentary,
elucidating its depths and broadening its connections,
so that with a single glance, all may be clearly seen.
Though my words may be coarse, they do no more than directly explicate its meaning.
I dare not claim this as definitive; may those of like mind judge it.

*Preface by Wang Jie Daoyuan, the Master of Primordial Chaos*

*Diagrammatic Annotations and Exegesis of the Supreme Lord Laozi’s Wondrous Classic of Constant Purity and Stillness*
*Compiled and Annotated with Diagrams by Wang Jie Daoyuan, the Master of Primordial Chaos*

"Supreme" (*Tai*)—nothing greater can be called Supreme.
"Upper" (*Shang*)—nothing beyond can be called Upper.
"Lao" (*Old*)—the Dao is revered, virtue esteemed, enduring through antiquity.
"Lord" (*Jun*)—the master, the one spirit that governs all things.
"Expounds" (*Shuo*)—to enlighten and transform.
"Constant" (*Chang*)—the true and unchanging Dao.
"Purity" (*Qing*)—utter emptiness, without form.
"Stillness" (*Jing*)—absolute purity, without admixture.
"Wondrous" (*Miao*)—the mystery within the mystery.
"Classic" (*Jing*)—the constant Dao of Heaven, the heart of humanity; also, the path all people traverse.

The Supreme One, seeing that people lived amidst the turbidity of the kalpa,
clinging to sensory desires and obscuring their original nature,
grieved over the loss of the Dao.
Thus, of necessity, he expounded the *Classic of Purity and Stillness* to enlighten the world,
guiding them to know their origin and end.

When a person is first born, they are as an infant.
The infant’s heart harbors no unkindness;
only as years pass and they mature,
seeing forms with their eyes, hearing sounds with their ears,
smelling fragrances with their nose, tasting flavors with their tongue,
do greed and attachment arise without cease,
and the stains of habit grow deeper.
Thus, emotions entangle and desires obscure, diverging from the Dao.

If one can purify the heart, still the nature,
illumine the good, and return to the origin,
so that not a single thought arises and no dust clings,
one naturally attains purity and stillness,
merging with the true Dao.

Laozi said:
The Great Dao is formless, yet it gives birth to Heaven and Earth;
The Great Dao is passionless, yet it moves the sun and moon;
The Great Dao is nameless, yet it nurtures the myriad things.

The Dao gives birth to spontaneity.
The Great Dao is utter emptiness, without form, without passion, without name.
At the dawn of the vast kalpa,
there already existed the Three Qi of Brahma Purity: Supreme Clarity, Supreme Subtlety, and Supreme Simplicity,
hidden and without image,
vast and boundless, without light,
a single chaos alone.
All was yin *qi*, empty within and without,
yet containing the principle of firm and ceaseless activity.
Coiling and revolving to its utmost,
a single yang first stirred within,
giving rise to the odd and even,
dividing into yin and yang,
and birthing Heaven and Earth.
The pure *qi* ascended to become Heaven; the turbid *qi* descended to become Earth.
Once Heaven and Earth were separated, the myriad things dwelt between them.
Yin *qi* emerged from Earth and ascended to Heaven;
yang *qi* descended from Heaven to Earth.
Yin and yang circulated endlessly.
Thus, the sun and moon moved, the Five *Qi* spread in order,
the four seasons proceeded,
and the myriad things were nurtured.
From the vastness of Heaven and Earth to the tiniest speck of dust,
not a single thing is not transformed and nourished by the Dao.
Those who skillfully investigate return to themselves to seek it—
their own body is Heaven and Earth.
Though the Dao that gave birth to me has no name,
I name it the Dao.

The *Classic of the Dao and Virtue* says:
There is a thing, chaotically formed, born before Heaven and Earth.
Silent, empty, it stands alone and does not change,
circulating without cease—
it may be called the Mother of the world.
I know not its name; I style it the Dao, and by force call it Great.
Great means it departs; departing means it is distant; distant means it returns.
Thus, the Dao is great indeed.

I know not its name; by force, I call it the Dao.
Who speaks of the Dao? The Supreme One says the Dao is great and profoundly empty,
originally without name or designation.
Yet, as it cannot stand void, it assumes form and function.
Moreover, the birth of the human body is a chaos—
a single Supreme Ultimate,
for the Dao of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things is wholly within this body.
The heart’s emptiness and numinosity—
the Dao naturally returns to it.
Stillness is the nature; movement is the emotion.
The nature abides within as the essence;
the emotions operate without as the function.
Essence and function share a single source;
the manifest and the subtle are without distinction—
this is called the Dao.

The term *Dao* speaks of essence and qi transforming into form, spirit’s emptiness and wondrous subtlety—how could one know its name? Yet if we do not speak of the Dao, by what shall we call it? Thus, not by our own will, we forcefully name it the Dao.

The *Daodejing* says: The Dao as a thing is only dim and vague. Vague indeed, dim indeed—within it there are images; dim indeed, vague indeed—within it there are things. Dark and deep indeed—within it there is truth. Thus, Yanzi, when speaking of the sages’ Dao, said: Look up at it, and it grows ever higher; delve into it, and it grows ever firmer. Glimpse it ahead, and suddenly it is behind. This is why the *Yijing* preserves what has no form, and spirit’s transformations have no fixed direction—such is the meaning here.

The Dao possesses clarity and turbidity, movement and stillness. Heaven is clear, Earth turbid; Heaven moves, Earth is still. Man is clear, woman turbid; man moves, woman is still. Descending from root to branch, it gives birth to the myriad things. Qi transforms, giving rise to form.

The Dao as a thing is empty and without image; it is only through qi’s transformations that the name *Dao* arises. The Dao is born from the One; the One is born from the Two. The Two qi interact and unite to generate the myriad things—this is the principle of nature.

The Dao dwells before Heaven and Earth, encompassing and sustaining all. Silent and nameless, it is called the True of the Limitless. Within the Limitless, the Dao arises from utmost emptiness. Yang emerges and flows freely—from the Limitless comes the Supreme Ultimate. This is the wondrous union and coagulation of the Two and the Five.

The Supreme Ultimate moves and generates yang; it is still and generates yin. Yang is clear and becomes Heaven, governing movement; yin qi is turbid and becomes Earth, governing stillness. Heaven covers Earth, Earth bears Heaven; Heaven moves, Earth is still—the Two qi intermingle. When yang qi takes precedence, it is the yang Dao; when yin qi takes precedence, it is the yin Dao. As the *Yijing* says: The Qian Dao forms man; the Kun Dao forms woman. Man embodies Heaven, thus clear and moving; woman embodies Earth, thus turbid and still. When man and woman interact, yin and yang harmonize and flow freely. Their true essence is released, descending from root to branch, giving birth to the myriad things.

The birth of all things follows this same principle. Qi and substance transform and act, each according to its kind. In ceaseless generation and transformation, the Dao is never not one. Confucius said: The noble person’s Dao begins with husband and wife; at its utmost, it is discerned in Heaven and Earth. Thus, following the natural order gives rise to humans and things; reversing it leads to Buddhahood and immortality. Master Zhou’s *Taiji Diagram* deeply grasped this essence.

Therefore, this scripture’s profound subtlety lies in these few words, which already encompass the entirety of the *Zhouyi*. Speaking in terms of the elixir path: Heaven and Earth serve as furnace and cauldron; man and woman as Kan and Li. Qian’s firmness moves the yang fire without cease—this is Heaven’s clarity and man’s movement. Kun’s softness retreats with the yin tally, concealing and storing—this is Earth’s turbidity and woman’s stillness. Because yin and yang possess the mechanism of movement and stillness, one draws from Kan to fill Li, returning to the root and reverting to the source—thus descending from the root and flowing to the branch, nurturing the myriad things of one’s body. What doubt could there be?

Clarity is the source of turbidity; movement is the foundation of stillness. Returning to the root and reverting to the source: Clarity is the primordial yang, the ancestral qi; turbidity is the illusory form, the yin qi. Movement is the numen of yang; stillness is the ground of the heart.

Speaking of human birth: the Four Great and the entire body belong to yin. Only this single point of primordial yang, the ancestral qi, resides at the center of the human body’s Heaven and Earth—this is called the *ming* stem. Where there is a stem, there is a root. When the root is deep, the stem is naturally firm. Essence is the root; qi is the stem; spirit is the numinous master of root and stem. One who comprehends this principle can preserve the True. Naturally, when essence is complete, it transforms into qi; when qi is complete, it transforms into spirit; when spirit is complete, it transforms into emptiness. Emptiness stands alone, beyond life and death.

When employing this in elixir practice: move inwardly with nature, shift outwardly with emotion—this is what is meant by “clarity is the source of turbidity.” With the two earths, Wu and Ji, gather the qi from all directions to attain numinosity—this is what is meant by “movement is the foundation of stillness.” This wondrous secret lies in the oral instructions.

If one can constantly maintain clarity and stillness, Heaven and Earth will all return to you. The heart must reside within the cavity. “Constant” means ordinary; “clear” means all conditions suddenly cease; “still” means not a single thought arises. If one can, in the ordinary course of daily life—whether moving, dwelling, sitting, or lying down—gather the scattered mind, preserve the good heart, neither allowing the inner to depart nor the outer to enter, and keep the heart utterly empty, taking the Dao as one’s body, then naturally desires and anger will not arise. Spirit will become clear of itself, and qi will become still of itself. Nature will abide of itself, and *ming* will halt of itself. Then the Dao of Heaven and Earth will all return to one’s body.

Confucius said: The Dao is that from which one cannot be separated even for an instant; what can be separated is not the Dao. Another saying goes: The noble person does not, even for the time of a single meal, depart from benevolence. In haste, one must be thus; in turmoil, one must be thus. Yao transmitted the Dao to Shun, saying: Only be refined, only be unified, and truly hold fast to the center—this is it.

The human spirit loves clarity, yet the heart disturbs it. To entertain a thought is already to deviate. Spirit is the primordial spirit within the human body. Spirit is the utmost numen of the myriad things, empty and wondrously profound. From the beginningless kalpa until now, it has never increased or decreased. It is inherently neither clear nor turbid—this is the wonder of nature.

The Perfected One Bai Ziqing said: This spirit is not the spirit of thought; it is comparable to the Primordial Beginning. Vast, it encompasses Heaven and Earth; small, it hides within a grain of millet. Bright and penetrating, how could it have a preference for clarity? If one thinks with spirit, it is no longer spirit. How much less can spirit depart to seek clarity? Yet one does not realize that the word “clarity” binds it, causing the mind-ground to generate ever more杂念, disturbing it without cease.

The *Daode Jing* states: "The farther one goes forth, the less one knows"—this is so. The human mind favors stillness, yet desires pull it away. Where methods arise, deceit is born. The mind is spirit; spirit is the mind. Desire is private thought; "pull" means to lead astray. The inherent goodness of the mind is originally the wonder of emptiness and quiescence—neither moving nor still, beyond thought and speech. With no dharma established, all dharmas are luminously manifest—what stillness is there to favor? Damo said: "Neither think of good nor think of evil, just be thus." Confucius said: "Before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure are aroused, it is called the Center; when aroused and all in due measure, it is called Harmony. The Center is the root of the world; Harmony is the Dao/Way that pervades the world." Thus, the sages transmitted the mind-dharma to one another, enabling them to settle the mind in this way, merging with the celestial principle and free from all obstructions.

Though one may possess the endowment of a worthy or sage, without the oral instructions of a true teacher, the mind has no place to rest. If one preserves it, it exists; if one does not, it vanishes—merely grasping at the mind with private conjectures. Even the Dao/Way of the sages is such that if the mind favors stillness, it becomes bound by stillness, unaware that the myriad desires have already led the good mind ten thousand miles away. How could one, through thrice returning to the numinous, recover the mind that sees Heaven and Earth? This is a point worthy of deep reflection.

If one can constantly dispel desires, the mind will naturally become still; if one clarifies the mind, the spirit will naturally become clear. Spontaneously, the six desires will not arise, and the three poisons will vanish. "Restrain the self and return to propriety." The six desires are those of the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and intent. The three poisons are greed, anger, and delusion. Within the human body reside the three corpse-spirits, named Peng Ju, Peng Zhi, and Peng Qiao—these are the three hun-souls. When one’s thoughts are impure, the hun-souls immediately cause one to gallop in confusion, indulging in greed and deviant lust, entering the ghostly realm and losing one’s original nature. As the *Scripture of Salvation* states: "The ghostly realm is easily led astray."

If worldly people can awaken to the fact that the four great elements—earth, water, fire, and wind—temporarily combine to form this illusory body, which will ultimately decay, and perceive that all things with form share this same principle, then from this moment on, they will no longer value external things but will instead investigate the One Mind. The mind is the treasure of the body. The mind is earth; nature is the sovereign. When the sovereign comes to dwell upon the earth of the mind, it governs the myriad affairs, constantly abiding in the true silence of the profound. This numinous essence does not change with the world; it can dispel all desires, so that naturally the mind becomes still and the spirit becomes clear, the six desires do not arise, and the three poisons vanish. The *Daode Jing* states: "The sage acts for the belly, not for the eyes"—thus, he discards that and embraces this.

Those who cannot do so fail because their minds are not clarified and their desires are not dispelled. Though people are born between Heaven and Earth, the climate and terrain differ, and thus their endowments vary. Their nature is not inherently dull, but because they receive turbid qi, the celestial constant is obscured like black clouds. Thus, when the eyes see, ears hear, nose smells, and tongue tastes, encountering objects and touching things, they leak through every aperture, letting the mind wander without return. The primordial spirit becomes scattered and dim, unable to recover its original truth, and one falls into the dark kalpas—all because the mind cannot be clarified and desires cannot be dispelled.

Those who can dispel them: inwardly observe the mind, and the mind is no-mind; outwardly observe the form, and the form is no-form; observe things afar, and things are no-things. When these three are awakened to, only emptiness is seen. The numinous is not obscured. This passage speaks of the practitioner who can directly awaken, cut off desires, and purify the source, establishing a resolve as immovable as a mountain. Though one may wander among willows and flowers, being stained by the world, inwardly one observes the mind, and the mind is forgotten; outwardly one observes the form, and the form is forgotten; afar one observes things, and things are forgotten. Having awakened to the forgetting of these three, one sees only that within the body is a great void—clear, bright, and boundless—unaware of Heaven and Earth as oneself, or oneself as Heaven and Earth. Only when cultivation reaches this stage does one perceive the wonder of emptiness. This is called: "Cases are not to be taken as images; things are not to be taken as things." The *Daode Jing* states: "What cannot be seen when looked at is called *yi*; what cannot be heard when listened to is called *xi*; what cannot be grasped when sought is called *wei*. These three cannot be fathomed." The *Yi*’s *Gen* hexagram states: "Stopping at the back, one does not obtain one’s body; walking in the courtyard, one does not see others"—this is so.

Observing emptiness with emptiness, emptiness has no emptiness; from nonbeing, being arises. When what is emptied is already nonexistent, even nonbeing is nonexistent—this is the formless Great Dao/Way. When nonbeing is nonexistent, there is only profound stillness; spirit and qi unite as one. When stillness has no stillness, how can desire arise? When images have no substance, desire does not arise—this is true stillness, merging with the Dao/Way in reality.

This passage continues from the above, where "the three are awakened to, and only emptiness is seen," lest one cling to dead emptiness with intent. Here, it clarifies that observing emptiness with emptiness means that emptiness has no emptiness—urging one to be lively and free, to observe its subtleties when the celestial nature is without desire. The *Daode Jing* calls these two "emerging from the same source but with different names," both termed "mysterious." "What is emptied is also nonexistent; even nonbeing is nonexistent" means that once one has returned to the Dao/Way and restored emptiness, the qi is clear and bright, vast and boundless, with no images to observe. "When nonbeing is nonexistent, there is only profound stillness" means that once all has been forgotten, one’s true unity naturally abides. "When stillness has no stillness, how can desire arise?" means that nature is not dead stillness—one merely responds to changes without abiding in images, thus subduing the mind. How could desire arise?

When desire does not arise, this is true stillness—this speaks of diligently practicing the way of the talismanic fire, having attained the pure *qi* of Brahman and reached spiritual refinement, forming the golden embryo of the sage. The yin turbidity dissolves, and the true Dao is purely yang, forged into one whole. Worldly dust no longer intrudes, wisdom manifests, and one’s nature stands firm and immaculate as a towering mountain—true stillness, unshaken.

At this stage, one transcends the mundane and enters sagehood, attaining a lifespan equal to Heaven—how could this be empty words? In true stillness, one responds to things; in responding to things, one remains unstained. In true constancy, one attains one’s nature. With no thought arising, one constantly responds and constantly abides in stillness, and all entanglements instantly cease. One is ever in pure stillness, and wisdom becomes perfect.

This passage follows the above, stating that when desire does not arise, this is true stillness, and thus proceeds to *true stillness responding to things* and *true constancy attaining one’s nature*. This is what is meant by sagehood and perfect wisdom—one’s nature is naturally true and still. When things come, one turns and responds with them, like a pearl rolling on a plate, round and smooth, fluid and unobstructed. Thus, the mind is open and unimpeded, naturally responding to things without stain and attaining one’s nature.

The *Daode Jing* says: "The myriad things flourish, each returning to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness; returning to one’s mandate is called constancy. Knowing constancy is called illumination. Not knowing constancy, one acts recklessly and courts misfortune."

The *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* says: "One should not give rise to the mind that abides in form, nor give rise to the mind that abides in sound, scent, taste, touch, or dharmas. One should give rise to the mind that abides nowhere."

The Perfected One Yin Xi said: "When things come, I respond to them with feeling but do not oppose them with the mind."

Confucius said: "The noble person acts according to his position and does not desire what lies beyond it." From this, can it not be seen that one is constantly responding, constantly still, and constantly pure?

Through such purity, one gradually enters the true Dao. The Dao is entered through sincerity.

What follows is for the transformation of sentient beings toward the Dao. Some may be foolish yet can be made wise; some may be turbid yet can be made clear. Suddenly awakening their inherent nature, one thus admonishes them to purify their minds, still their natures, not oppose the myriad entanglements, and simply cultivate in this manner. Shedding their old stains of defilement, they daily renew their virtue and naturally enter the true Dao.

Having entered the true Dao, this is called *attaining the Dao*. "I am the Primal Beginning." This follows the above, stating that the learner has grasped the principle of awakened nature. Before receiving the secret oral transmission from a teacher, one is thus instructed: having entered the true Dao and being called *attaining the Dao*—this means the true Dao is not the way of cleverness, broad learning, or reciting the three mysteries. It is, in truth, the wondrous work of the three perfections within the body. One must bow to a true teacher, receive a single word at the ear, and directly settle the mind—only then does one enter the true Dao.

Nurturing one’s nature without losing its center, cultivating life by moving the bellows without losing the sieve, one’s nature and life naturally merge. The golden elixir flows—thus it is called *attaining the Dao*.

Though called *attaining the Dao*, in reality, there is nothing attained. This follows the above, fearing that learners, though enlightened in principle, may cling to the word *attain* in their seeking, thereby turning away from the Dao. Thus, it proceeds to say that though called *attaining the Dao*, in reality, there is nothing attained—urging learners to investigate thoroughly and awaken truly.

The Dao as a thing is formless in its great image, soundless in its great tone, and cornerless in its great square. It truly has no name. If one fixes one’s thoughts on any single point of the four directions, above or below, one misses it. Yet one cannot leave this body and seek it externally. It cannot be thought, cannot be discussed, is neither movement nor stillness. The one body is the myriad distinctions; the myriad distinctions are the one body. In every thing and every phenomenon, all is manifest before one. At this point, if one can turn a single phrase, one smashes through iron walls and silver mountains, breaking through directly—only then is it *attaining the Dao*.

Attaining it as non-attainment, not deluded by appearances, one’s single numinous true nature shines forth, ever abiding before the Lord of Images, bright and clear—this is called *true attainment*. As the true elixirists say: "In non-seeing, one intimately sees; in seeing, one does not see. In non-hearing, one intimately hears; in hearing, one does not hear." Penetrating this barrier, the work of inquiry is complete—what attainment could there be? For the sake of transforming sentient beings, it is called *attaining the Dao*.

Those who awaken to this may transmit the sagely Dao. It is all-pervading.

To transform is to open and develop. Sentient beings are those attached to things. This concludes the above, stating that through such purity, one gradually enters the true Dao. The Most High, seeing the multitude of beings under Heaven, the mingling of sages and commoners, and the rarity of those with inherent nature, thus employs the Dao’s twists and turns to expound and open their understanding. Among them, there may be those of keen capacity who, upon hearing these words, suddenly awaken, instantly shedding the roots of the dust and taking the Dao as their body. Diligently investigating within this Dao without ceasing, they cultivate earnestly—this is called *transforming sentient beings* and *attaining the Dao*.

The word *attain* originally means nothing is attained. But when speaking this word to others, it is to entice people to keep the Dao in mind without forgetting. The *Daode Jing* says: "The good person is the teacher of the not-good person; the not-good person is the resource of the good person." Thus, all people are inherently endowed, none without the same nature as mine. Only because they cling to things are they called *sentient beings*. If one can truly comprehend this, one may transmit the sagely Dao.

As with the Sixth Patriarch Huineng of Lu, originally a barbarian from Guangdong, who upon hearing a traveler recite the *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* to *"give rise to the mind that abides nowhere,"* suddenly awakened. Later, he went to Mount Fengmu to pay homage to the Fifth Patriarch. When asked the reason, he answered like a gushing spring. Seeing his great capacity, the Fifth Patriarch...

Fearing others might plot against him, the Fifth Patriarch rebuked Huineng and ordered him to pound rice, so no one paid him any mind. Later, the Fifth Patriarch deliberately instructed the assembly to compose verses; whoever could clarify the mind and perceive the nature would be entrusted with the robe and bowl. All deferred to the head monk Shenxiu to compose a verse. Shenxiu’s four-line verse did not fully capture the essence. Upon hearing it, Huineng immediately followed its rhyme and said:

*Bodhi has no tree,*
*The bright mirror is not a stand.*
*Originally, not one thing exists—*
*Where could dust alight?*

The Fifth Patriarch nodded in secret and arranged to meet him in the central hall at midnight. Surrounding Huineng with his robe, he recited the *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* up to *"give rise to the mind that abides nowhere."* There, he transmitted the mind-Dharma, bestowed the robe and bowl, and then sent him across the river, thus becoming the Patriarch of an age. This shows that one must not judge by appearance but by aspiration. Like Ma Danyang converting Ren the butcher—first a violent man, upon sudden awakening, he became virtuous. From this, can we not see that those who awaken may transmit the sagely Dao?

The Most High Lord Lao said: This title "Most High" is how the perfected ones refer to him. What was previously called the Dao hereafter takes another name: what is spoken of is virtue. The *Daode Jing* says that virtue aligns with virtue, while loss aligns with loss—hence the distinction between superior and inferior scholars. Learners should observe with a discerning eye.

The superior scholar does not contend; the inferior scholar loves contention—their views differ. The superior scholar is what we call a sage of great virtue. The inferior scholar is what we call a worthy clinging to attachments. The sage’s mind merges with Heaven’s principle, embracing all without distinction between wise and foolish. Blending light with the common, dwelling among the dust, humbling himself in lowliness, he files down sharpness and buries his brilliance, never revealing his edges. He treats the good with goodness and the not-good with goodness. Practicing the teaching without words, engaging in affairs without action, he disputes nothing with others—this is the superior scholar.

The worthy’s mind clings to attachments, believing others’ learning is inferior to his own. Self-righteous and self-displaying, self-praising and self-boasting, he judges the ancient worthies, calling some long and others short; he evaluates contemporaries, declaring some right and others wrong. Even the sages who become immortals or buddhas—let alone his own heterodox learning of emptiness and extinction—are not spared his contention. This is the inferior scholar.

Yin Xi said: The sage is like a dragon; the worthy, like a flood-dragon. A dragon can transform a flood-dragon, but a flood-dragon can never become a dragon—this is what is meant.

Superior virtue does not claim virtue; inferior virtue clings to virtue. Those who cling cannot be called virtuous. Humble virtue is whole; clinging virtue is partial.

Superior virtue is the Dao of non-action. Inferior virtue is the Dao of action. *Clinging* means obstinate and unyielding. *Virtue* means attainment—the principle of what the mind stores, the blending of nature, the unfolding of things, and the accomplishment of affairs.

This speaks of the sage of superior virtue, who never displays his own virtue. Concealing himself and hiding his traces, embracing simplicity and containing his light, concentrating his qi to attain softness, he is like an infant. The worthy of inferior virtue clings to affairs, endlessly debating worldly matters of right and wrong, gain and loss. Boasting of his own virtue, blinded by his own cleverness, he divides things into self and other, noble and base, high and low. Thus clinging, how can he understand true virtue?

Does not the *Daode Jing* say: *Superior virtue does not claim virtue, and thus possesses virtue; inferior virtue never loses virtue, and thus lacks virtue.* Superior virtue acts without acting; inferior virtue acts with deliberate action.

Thus, the Most High said: *I have three treasures to preserve and uphold: first, compassion; second, frugality; third, not daring to be first in the world.*

Confucius said: *A sage I cannot be, but I transmit rather than innovate, trusting and loving the ancients. I humbly compare myself to Lao Peng. Silently I comprehend, learning without tiring, teaching without wearying—what do I possess?* He never once spoke of his own virtue. From this, can we not see that superior virtue does not claim virtue?

The inferior scholar who clings to virtue, judging by outward appearances, may excel in governance, literature, poetry, or esoteric arts—yet he becomes arrogant, flaunting his abilities, obstinately holding to one-sided views. How can he illuminate the Dao?

Even the sages Yao and Shun shared goodness with others, and the enlightened Yu, upon hearing a single good word, would bow—when did they ever cling? Learners should ponder this deeply.

The Most High Lord Lao said: Why do sentient beings fail to attain the true Dao? Because they harbor deluded minds and seek excessive longevity.

This passage again invokes the name of the Most High, as the perfected ones warn the world to observe the conduct of sentient beings. *Sentient beings* refers to those who are ignorant and clinging—outwardly human in form, yet inwardly beast-like in heart. Their nature is a dark sea, chasing waves of desire, utterly devoid of virtue. They neither fear the laws of kings above nor cherish the bodies of parents below, engaging in theft, deceit, and every kind of villainy. They fail to attain the true Dao because their deluded minds are clouded by selfish desires, and thus the Dao slips further away.

The *Daode Jing* says: *The great Dao is level, yet the people prefer byways. The court is excessively adorned, the fields excessively overgrown, the granaries empty. They wear embroidered robes, carry sharp swords, gorge on food and drink, and hoard excess wealth—this is called the boasting of thieves. Is this not far from the Dao?*

It also says: *When the people do not fear authority, greater authority will come. Do not constrict their dwellings; do not oppress their livelihood.*

Those who never know satiety are thus never sated. Such people persist until death without remorse, their hearts still craving what they lack. Their restless minds become the seeds of future rebirths, all because a single deluded heart has lost the true Dao. Once delusion arises, the spirit is startled; it is deceived and led astray.

This follows from what was said above: when the eyes behold beauty, the spirit receives it in the heart. Once the heart receives it, deluded thoughts arise, and the original spirit of the self transforms into the spirit of consciousness. The spirit, scattered by external conditions, follows the mind into confusion. The *Daode Jing* says: *So-called galloping and hunting excite the mind to madness; rare and precious goods obstruct right conduct.* Thus the spirit is startled.

All this stems from the heart-monarch failing to govern, dazzled by sensory forms. The true Dao is dissipated, and even in dreams, there is no peace. Once the spirit is startled, it clings to the myriad things, assailed by a host of desires. This means that when the spirit fixates on things, the mind-ground is no longer at peace. The spirit, startled by a single thing, becomes attached to it, drawn and ensnared by it, losing all sense of direction. Thus it clings to the myriad things without knowing satiety, even walking into danger without awareness of peril.

Once it clings to the myriad things, greed and craving arise, mistaking the thief for one’s own child. This means that when the spirit clings to things, the true nature is obscured, and it follows the machinations of the yin-soul. Such scheming leads to emotional indulgence, falling into the realm of drunken stupor and dreamlike existence. Greed draws one into the rivers of love and seas of desire, without rest or respite, entangled in a thousand threads, leading to lifelong ruin.

Once greed and craving arise, they become afflictions, self-imposed shackles. This is the source of entering the deviant path. Today they crave, tomorrow they crave; seeing, they covet; hearing, they desire. Daily they acquire all manner of things, yet their hearts never know contentment. They do not realize they are planting the roots of affliction and karmic deeds. Though their households may be abundant, thieves and robbers arise. With a hundred schemes and a thousand plots, their minds remain unsettled. As the ancients said: *Wealth burdens the body.* Thus they are bound by it, adding to their afflictions, and calamity strikes, leading to their downfall—all self-inflicted.

Afflictions and delusions torment body and mind, bringing defilement and disgrace. They drift through the cycles of birth and death, forever sinking in the sea of suffering, eternally losing the true Dao. The harm to form is complete.

This section summarizes the foregoing: sentient beings, because of their deluded minds, fail to attain the true Dao. Clinging to life and fearing death, they plant the seeds of affliction. The hearts of sentient beings seek only profit to enrich their lives, pursuing immediate household abundance. They sink into the realms of form, sound, fragrance, and taste, bewildered by the allure of existence and non-existence, love and desire. They bring upon themselves afflictions, delusions, and the torment of body and mind. In their daily conduct, they are neither loyal nor filial, committing sins of deceiving heaven and cheating others, all secretly recorded by spirits. When heavenly disasters strike or retribution falls, their bodies suffer calamity. Whether in this life or the next, their transgressions are punished. Thus they endure defilement and disgrace, drifting through birth and death. Their solitary spirits, unaware, transform and are reborn among other species. For a hundred thousand kalpas, they struggle to regain human form, forever sinking in the sea of suffering, eternally losing the true Dao.

If people could turn back and take this as a warning, awakening early to the essence of the supreme Dao, they would avoid the suffering of the wheel of rebirth. Would the sages ever deceive us?

The Dao of true constancy is attained by those who awaken. Those who awaken to the Dao abide in constant purity, one with the great void. True constancy is neither born nor destroyed. From the beginningless kalpas, it has ever been thus. *Awakening* means realizing this principle; *attaining* means personally witnessing it. *Purity* means clarity without defilement.

This speaks of how, when one awakens to the original nature, it is inherently complete, requiring no artificial cultivation. Initially, through the transformation of qi, the true spirit coalesces into form, entering the shell and being enveloped by it. The numinous nature thus manifests according to the quality of qi. Hence the differences between sages and fools: even the greatly wise cannot be without the mind of the lowest fool, yet the lowest fool cannot be without the nature of the highest sage. This is why both awakening and cultivation are necessary. *Awakening* pertains to nature; *cultivation* pertains to life. Only when nature and life are cultivated together does one truly attain the Dao of constancy.

Once nature and life are united, the Dao is vast and profoundly empty. The heart naturally becomes pure and still, knowing all that comes without obstruction, responding to all that arrives without hindrance. Internally, one fully comprehends life and death; externally, one fulfills all human affairs. This concludes the marvelous essence of this scripture from beginning to end. The opening speaks of the Dao, and the closing speaks of virtue, truly distilling the marrow of the *Daode Jing*’s five thousand words. It aims to make people understand the principles of Dao and virtue: those who understand the Dao do not possess virtue—they are called superior persons; those who grasp the Dao do not lose virtue—they are called inferior persons; those with deluded minds and greedy cravings are called sentient beings.

Thus, at the end of this scripture, it speaks of the Dao of true constancy, which is attained by those who awaken. This reflects the Most High’s love for life and compassion for the suffering of sentient beings, employing manifold analogies to urge them to turn back early and awaken to this Dao. Some may suddenly penetrate and realize it, attaining constant purity—how wondrous is this!

The *Most High Lord Lao’s Explanation and Commentary on the Wondrous Scripture of Constant Purity* concludes.

**Eulogy by the Perfected One**
Immortal Ge Xuan said: I attained this Dao by reciting this scripture ten thousand times. This scripture is practiced by heavenly beings and is not transmitted to inferior persons. I once received it from the Lord of Eastern Florescence, who received it from the Lord of the Golden Tower, who received it from the Queen Mother of the West. The Queen Mother of the West transmitted it orally, without written record. Now, in this world, I have written and recorded it. Those superior persons who awaken to it ascend as heavenly officials...

Middle adepts who awaken to it become immortals of the Southern Palace; lesser adepts who awaken to it enjoy long years in the world, roam the Three Realms, and ascend to pay homage at the Golden Gate.

This eulogy by Immortal Ge Xuan of the Yellow Court praises the wondrousness of the *Most High Lord Lao’s Explanation and Commentary*. This scripture is not a text of written words. From the beginningless kalpas to the present, it is neither born nor destroyed, neither increased nor diminished—it is the direct path of the Dao. The mysterious barrier of the human body is called the "scripture," and the work of practicing the Dao is called "recitation." Recitation is not oral recitation; it is the mechanism of the opening and closing of Heaven and Earth, employing the wondrous function of the inversion of Kan and Li.

When the immortal elder was moved to transmit the Dao, those who recited it ten thousand times were practicing this Dao. The ten thousand recitations are the work; the circulation is unceasing, continuous as if present. Obtaining a single grain-of-millet pearl and dropping it into the Yellow Court, it coalesces into the golden embryo of empty qi. Like a mother nurturing an infant, the spirit of the child irrigates it. After ten months, the fetal work is complete; the Gate of Heaven bursts open, and the yang spirit emerges, transforming endlessly—this is called a *Perfected One*. Such are the inconceivable merits and virtues of this scripture, the text practiced by heavenly beings, which must not be lightly transmitted to inferior persons.

The transmission of the Dao and the scripture must be to those of virtue, loyalty, and filial piety. Those who transmit it lightly will suffer heavenly punishment—such was the case with Zhang Ziyang, who was not human three times and suffered heavenly punishment thrice. The immortals and sages always concealed this scripture, transmitting it only orally, without written record, for fear of the arrogance of heavenly demons. Yet later generations, being less pure and simple than the ancients, would not awaken without the aid of written words. Thus, it was reluctantly recorded and transmitted to the world.

Superior adepts who awaken to it diligently cultivate and verify it, ascending as immortals of the Golden Tower. Middle adepts who awaken to it cultivate and verify it over time, becoming immortals of the Southern Palace. Lesser adepts who awaken to it become earthly immortals, enjoying long life in the world, their appearances and disappearances unfathomable. They can roam the Three Realms with the Dao and ascend to pay homage at the Golden Gate.

The Perfected One of the Left Mystery said: Those who study the Dao and uphold this scripture will have the ten heavenly benevolent spirits protect them. Then, the jade talisman secures the spirit, and the golden liquid refines the form. Form and spirit are both wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth.

The immortal elder’s repeated praise is the work of an old woman’s heart, revealing the secrets of this scripture—it is the essence of the great elixir of the golden pill, guiding later students of immortality. The so-called "upholding and reciting" means to faithfully receive and practice it. The "ten heavens" arise from the flow of *wu* into *ji*, with *wu* and *ji* each comprising five, totaling ten—hence the "ten heavens."

The jade talisman is the talisman of fire. The golden liquid is the divine water. At the time of the first stirring of yang, the spirit returns to qi, qi returns to the cavity, and descending to the sea bottom, one embraces and brings forth the sun. This is the upholding and reciting of this scripture. The *wu* earth flows, compelling the essence of metal to ascend to the Southern Palace. Thereafter, the *ji* earth gathers yang and retreats the yin talisman, both returning to the position of *kun*—this is what is meant by "the ten heavenly benevolent spirits protect the person."

When the spirit is settled, the fire of stabilized qi surges forth, compelling the jade nectar and golden liquid of the body to flow and irrigate—this is what is meant by "then the jade talisman secures the spirit, and the golden liquid refines the form." Form is called *ming*; spirit is called *xing*. When *xing* and *ming* unite, it is called the Dao. Thus, it is said that form and spirit are both wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth.

In terms of worldly methods, those who possess the Dao naturally have the ten heavenly benevolent spirits constantly protecting them—how could this be empty words? As the *Dao De Jing* says: "Entering among weapons, they are not cut by blades; entering among tigers and rhinoceroses, they are not harmed by claws and teeth."

The Perfected One of the Orthodox Unity said: If a household possesses this scripture and one awakens to it, calamities will not approach, the multitude of sages will guard the gate, and the spirit will ascend to the upper realms to pay homage to the exalted ones. When merit is complete and virtue is perfected, one will be summoned by the Imperial Lord. With unwavering recitation and upholding, the body will ascend on purple clouds.

This passage is the eulogy of the Celestial Master Zhang Daoling. The so-called "household" does not refer to a family’s home but to the heart at the center of the human body. This scripture is the precious pearl, and the precious pearl is the Dao. Those who awaken to it personally witness its wondrousness. At the time when lead sees the birth of *gui*, the precious pearl is suspended in the void, five *zhang* above the earth. The revolving wheel of the flying stars of the heavens all enter the mouth of the pearl, transforming and refining into the elixir—this is true awakening.

Once the elixir congeals into flakes and the vast qi becomes pure yang, calamities naturally do not approach, and the multitude of heavenly sages secretly protect the body. Thus, one body becomes ten thousand spirits; one qi becomes ten thousand qi. On the day the elixir is formed, the embryo is cast off, the cauldron is changed, and the spirit moves to reside above the Mud Pill Palace in the Upper Capital. There, the Three Clarities dwell, and one’s body pays homage to the exalted ones. Only when merit is complete and conduct is perfected does one move the Imperial Lord to record one’s name in the registers.

Those who constantly maintain purity, uphold strict precepts, and unwaveringly practice and recite this Dao will naturally receive a heavenly decree and imperial edict, summoning them to ascend on purple clouds and fly to the heavenly towers in broad daylight. Such was the case with the Celestial Master of the Han, who subdued demons and vanquished evil spirits; Immortal Ge, who performed rituals to refine the souls of the dead; and Xu Jingyang, who slew dragons and beheaded pythons. All achieved great merit in the world, and their entire households ascended. The Dao of learning immortality is indeed real.
