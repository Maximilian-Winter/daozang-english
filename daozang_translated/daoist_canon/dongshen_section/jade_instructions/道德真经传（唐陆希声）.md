**Preface to *The Transmission of the True Classic of Dao and Virtue***

The Preface states:

When the Great Dao lay hidden and worldly teachings declined, the realm descended into chaos. At such times, Heaven inevitably gives rise to sages. These sages, grieving that the people had not attained order, devised methods to uphold the declining and rescue the chaotic.

By the late Zhou, such a moment had nearly arrived. Thus, Confucius expounded the culture of the Five Dynasties to uphold its decline, while Laozi grounded himself in the simplicity of the Three Sovereigns to remedy its chaos—their aims were one.

Confucius’s teachings flourished through culture, using culture to govern the emotions. Laozi’s teachings originated in simplicity, employing simplicity to restore nature. The ultimate of nature and emotion cannot differ for sages; yet the transformations of culture and simplicity cannot be uniform across the ages.

The *Book of Changes* says: "Manifesting through benevolence." This refers to teaching through culture. Such teaching is evident in its affairs, thus open and clear. Being open and clear, refined speech becomes detailed.

The *Book of Changes* says: "Concealing through application." This refers to teaching through simplicity. Such teaching is subtle in its principles, thus profound and unrecognizable. Being profound and unrecognizable, those who fabricate falsely multiply.

Only Laozi’s teachings take the Dao as their essence and names as their function, practicing non-action yet accomplishing all, aligning with the imperial standard. Yang Zhu adhered to Laozi’s essence but fell short, valuing the self and belittling things. Zhuang Zhou expounded Laozi’s function but overreached, striving to abolish sages and discard wisdom. Shen [Buhai] and Han [Fei] misapplied Laozi’s names, leading to harshness and rigidity. Wang [Bi] and He [Yan] lost Laozi’s Dao, drifting into emptiness and recklessness. These six masters were all transgressors against Laozi.

Yet the world claims that Laozi’s intent does not align with Confucius. Thus, they slander his name, accusing him of striking down benevolence and righteousness, abolishing ritual and learning. They criticize his Dao, saying it relies solely on purity and emptiness—how could this govern? Alas, the world’s delusion has persisted for long. This has caused Laozi to suffer slander for a thousand years, his Dao unfulfilled in his own era, and there is good reason for it.

Moreover, Laozi traced the origins of Heaven and Earth, recounted the changes of past and present, first clarifying Dao and virtue, then expounding benevolence and righteousness, and finally exposing the failures of ritual and music, the excesses of punishments and governance. His words describe how things naturally come to be. Holding to the essential and grasping the root, he focused on the ultimate of nature and emotion. Thus, his Dao begins with body and mind, takes form in family and state, and extends to the world—so comprehensive is it. Yet some still speak recklessly—is this not a grave slander?

Of old, Fuxi drew the Eight Trigrams, symbolizing the myriad things, exhausting the principles of nature and destiny, and harmonizing with the Dao and virtue. Laozi, too, preceded Heaven and Earth, rooted in yin and yang, deduced the ultimate of nature and destiny, and explored the mysteries of Dao and virtue—this aligns with Fuxi in origin.

King Wen observed the movements of the nine and six in the *Great Change*, valuing firmness and esteeming transformation, yet centering on the mean. Laozi also examined the correctness of the seven and eight in the *Great Change*, attaining softness and maintaining stillness, yet unifying them in the great—this shares a lineage with King Wen.

Confucius followed the examples of Yao and Shun, modeled himself on Wen and Wu, and guided the people with the teaching of benevolence and righteousness. Laozi likewise emulated Fuxi, encompassed the Yellow Emperor, and covered the world with the transformation of Dao and virtue—this aligns in principle with the Master.

These three noble ones were the pinnacle of sages. Laozi transformed and connected with them, returning to unite with them, investigating the mechanism of ultimate change and exploring the subtleties of utmost refinement—this may be called the most divine.

Yet Wang Bi claimed that sages unite with the Dao in substance, while Laozi could not embody the Dao. Thus, Ruan Ji called him a "superior worthy, a near-sage," aligning with [Wang] Fusi. Could it be that Laozi’s traces in governing the world were insufficient to fulfill his words? This is not so.

Alas, when sages are in the world, some leave traces, some do not. Thus, when the Dao is not practiced, some humble themselves and journey through the realm, taking the world’s troubles as their own; others conceal their names and flee, showing that worldly affairs cannot entangle them. Whether leaving traces or not, different paths lead to the same end—this is truly the gateway of Dao and righteousness, not merely opposition.

Thus, Confucius’s emergence and Laozi’s seclusion, Laozi’s silence and Confucius’s speech—these are the extremes of yielding and extending, concealing and revealing. How could those two masters comprehend this?

Sima Qian, in compiling the histories of the various schools, placed Dao and virtue first—this may be called understanding root and branch. Ban Gu, in composing the *Table of Ancient and Modern Personages*, demoted Laozi to the third rank. Though his name may be mocked, can his Dao truly be denigrated?

Alas, Laozi’s teachings have long been discarded in his own era—this is the doing of those few masters. Moreover, Confucius personally met Laozi and sighed, saying his Dao was "like a dragon." He followed him to inquire about ritual without finding fault—this is recorded in the annals. Later generations could not fathom his intent, giving rise to heterodox theories. Those who transmitted his teachings did not exhaust their source, so those who opposed them did not grasp their subtleties.

Alas, if this transmission had not been made, Laozi’s intent might have nearly vanished. Now, I have thoroughly explored its subtleties and revealed its profundities, making it clearly harmonize with the intentions of the multitude of sages. Those who can embody his Dao, employ his names, grasp the ancient to steer the present—achieving order will be as easy as turning one’s palm.

Among those who have spoken of Laozi’s teachings, only the Grand Historian [Sima Qian] came close.

The governance that slightly grasped its Dao was only that of Emperor Wen of Han. All other perverse words and deceptive theories are not worth adopting.

**Commentary on the Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue, Scroll One**
*Transmitted by Lu Xisheng of Wu Commandery*

**Classic:**
The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao;
The name that can be named is not the constant name.
The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth;
The named is the mother of the myriad things.
Thus, always without desire, observe its mystery;
Always with desire, observe its manifestations.
These two emerge together but differ in name.
Together they are called the profound. Profound and again profound—
The gate of all mysteries.

**Commentary:**
The Dao is the essence; the name is its function. Function arises from essence, yet essence is originally without function. Names are established by the Dao, yet the Dao is originally without name.
Essence is originally without function, so no function is impossible—hence it is said, "can be spoken." What can be spoken refers to essence fulfilling function. Essence fulfilling function is the principle of things, not the constancy of the Dao—hence it is said, "not the constant Dao."
The Dao is originally without name, so no name is impossible—hence it is said, "can be named." What can be named refers to seeking essence through name. Seeking essence through name is the transformation of things, not the constancy of names—hence it is said, "not the constant name."
The so-called constant Dao and constant name are not the Dao that "can be spoken" or the name that "can be named." Why? The constant Dao and constant name cannot be spoken and cannot be named; only by understanding the discourse on essence and function can one profoundly penetrate their ultimate depths.
Thus, one who embodies the Dao is the Sovereign, who follows the principles of things. One who employs names is the Emperor, who adapts to the transformations of things. Following principles and adapting to transformations, descending to ascend—such a one is the King.
Therefore, those who attain it supremely become spirits; those who attain it moderately become sages; those who attain it minimally become wise; those who attain it partially become worthies; and those who do not attain it become the common people.
The so-called nameless is the essence of the Dao, prior to movement and stillness. The named is the function of the Dao, the origin of good and evil.
Essence is the root of names, thus it transcends movement and stillness—tracing it back, it is the beginning of heaven and earth. Names arise from function, thus they generate good and evil—pushing it to the limit, it is the mother of the myriad things.
Thus, the Sovereign upholds the nameless, while the Emperor practices the named. Upholding the nameless, one acts without acting and yet nothing is left undone. Practicing the named, one acts yet does not rely on action.
The Sovereign follows the principles of things, responding to their lack of desire by maintaining clarity and stillness—hence it is said, "always without desire, observe its mystery." Mystery refers to stillness illuminating principle, the subtly profound and profoundly penetrating.
The Emperor adapts to the transformations of things, responding to their desires by acting with restraint and pattern—hence it is said, "always with desire, observe its manifestations." Manifestations refer to movement illuminating affairs, where divergent paths converge as one.
The so-called "these two" refer to the beginning and the mother, that is, the arts of the nameless and the named—emerging from the same essence yet differing in function.
The profound is that which illuminates both affairs and principle. One who knows the subtly profound and profoundly penetrating art of the nameless, and the art of the named where divergent paths converge as one—using stillness to control transformation, movement to return to the root, so that movement and stillness are not distinct—then affairs and principle profoundly converge.
When affairs and principle profoundly converge, things cannot burden one. Thus, one retreats and hides in secrecy, sharing fortune and misfortune with the people, yet the drumming of the world does not share the sage’s concerns—this is the utmost profundity of the spirit.
Emerging, one becomes the multitude; entering, one becomes the mystery. There is nothing that does not proceed from this Dao.

**Classic:**
When all under heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises;
When all know goodness as goodness, not-goodness arises.
Thus, being and non-being produce each other,
Difficulty and ease complete each other,
Long and short shape each other,
High and low incline toward each other,
Sound and voice harmonize with each other,
Front and back follow each other.
Therefore, the sage abides in the affairs of non-action and practices the teaching without words.
The myriad things arise yet he does not refuse them,
He gives them life yet does not possess them,
He acts yet does not rely on them,
His work is accomplished yet he does not dwell in it.
It is precisely because he does not dwell that it does not depart.

**Commentary:**
What people call beauty and ugliness all arise from emotion. Adapting to emotion is beauty; opposing emotion is ugliness. The same applies to utmost goodness and not-goodness.
Yet what is deemed beautiful is not necessarily beautiful; what is deemed ugly is not necessarily ugly. What is deemed good is not necessarily good; what is deemed not-good is not necessarily not-good. Why is this? Emotion causes it.
Human nature is largely the same, but emotions differ. When divergent emotions are externally stirred by things, likes and dislikes become entangled, and beauty and ugliness lack a foundation—how can they be rectified? It lies in returning to nature.
Formerly, what emotions give rise to must originate from nature. Thus, the sage transforms emotion to return to nature, reaching great unity.
The so-called "being and non-being producing each other" refers to emotion and nature. The mutual dependence of emotion and nature is like difficulty and ease completing each other.
In governance, if emotion disorders nature, it is difficult to succeed; if nature rectifies emotion, it is easy to succeed.
The so-called "long and short shaping each other" refers to beauty and ugliness. The mutual contention of beauty and ugliness is like high and low inclining toward each other.
The so-called "sound and voice harmonizing with each other" refers to goodness and not-goodness. The mutual reliance of goodness and not-goodness is like front and back following each other.
Alas, the world’s many troubles arise from these six. This is why all under heaven is not well-governed, and the myriad things cannot fulfill their natures.
The sage, wishing to restore their natures, first transforms their emotions.

The Way of the Good is to nurture goodness within oneself, yet the ungood I also nurture and make good. Thus, the good is cultivated.

The Way of the Faithful is to trust within oneself, yet the unfaithful I also make trustworthy. Thus, faith is cultivated.

Therefore, governance does not discard any thing, and teaching does not discard any person. When things are governed, there is no evil; when people are taught, there is none ungood—yet the world still remains ungoverned.

*The Classic of Changes* says:
Its Dao is most vast, and nothing is left to waste.
This is what is spoken of.

Thus, the sage embodies the formless Dao and acts without doing, yet affairs are naturally settled.
They employ the named Dao and speak not, yet teaching proceeds of itself.
So they allow all things to fulfill their natures, as if no one compelled them—
like the heavens and earth producing myriad things yet not claiming their use,
like the myriad artisans crafting tools yet not relying on their completion,
like the four seasons fulfilling their yearly tasks yet not dwelling on their results.

Only thus can their Dao be constant, and their name never fade.

The Canon states:
Do not exalt the worthy, lest the people contend;
Do not prize hard-to-obtain goods, lest the people become thieves;
Do not display what is desirable, lest the heart be disordered.
Thus, the sage’s governance empties the mind, fills the belly, weakens the will, and strengthens the bones—
ever making the people ignorant of knowledge and free from desire,
so that even those who know do not dare act.
When there is no doing, nothing remains ungoverned.

The Transmission says:
If one cherishes what is exalted, then things yield to their desires.
Yielding breeds falsehood, falsehood breeds deceit.
Thus, exalting the worthy stirs the competitive heart,
and prizing goods invites thievery.

Only by correcting emotion with nature does one
not see the desire for exaltation,
and follow the Dao without deceit or falsehood.

Therefore, the sage governs the people by
dispersing surplus wealth, thus emptying the greedy, thieving heart.
Manuring barren fields, thus filling the hungry people’s stomachs.
Not exalting the skilled, thus weakening their ambitions,
and not burdening them with military service, thus strengthening their bones.

Ever making the people of all under heaven
ignorant of knowledge yet knowing it,
free from desire yet desiring it—
though some may know what is exalted,
they dare not act upon it,
for the armies will not dare to do so.

The sage who acts without doing,
who uses the named yet embodies the formless,
thus brings all under heaven to governance.

The Canon states:
The Dao is boundless yet employed—
sometimes it does not overflow.
Deep as the source of all things.

It blunts the sharp, resolves the tangled,
harmonizes the bright, aligns with the dust,
settles as if it might exist.
I do not know whose child it is—
it precedes the Emperor.

The Transmission says:
The Dao’s essence is its true substance,
its boundlessness is its function.
All under heaven turns to it, yet it never overflows;
it is the source of all things, its depths unfathomable.

To grasp its function is to blunt the harshness of worldly desires,
to resolve the entanglements of worldly affairs.
To embody its essence is to harmonize the luminous without brilliance,
to align with the dust without obscurity.
Though settled beyond measure, it endures like existence—
thus first it is likened to "as if," and later to "as if it exists."

I cannot finally know its origin—
it is like the One before heaven and earth were born.

The Canon states:
Heaven is long, Earth is enduring.
Heaven and Earth endure long because they do not generate themselves—
thus they can long endure.

Therefore, the sage follows his own body yet his body precedes,
sets it aside yet his body remains.
Is it not because of their lack of self-interest?
Thus they achieve their own ends.

The Transmission says:
Heaven and Earth produce myriad things yet do not generate themselves—
thus they endure without decay,
last forever without ceasing.
The people rely on the sage for governance,
yet the sage does not depend on the people.

It is like the ritual sacrifice (*chúdǎo*) relying on divine illumination to complete,
yet the divine illumination has no use for the sacrifice.
Only when there is no use is there no partiality,
and when there is no partiality, no favoritism.
Thus, Heaven and Earth, though without favor, generate great favor,
and the sage, though not "仁" (*rén*), achieves great "仁."
Therefore, the people do not refuse virtue from the sage,
and myriad things do not withhold life from Heaven and Earth.

How do I know this to be true?
I observe between Heaven and Earth—
it is like the bellows (*tuóqiào*) without heart.
The bellows, without heart, thus its sound does not tire,
its breath ever emerges.
Heaven and Earth, without heart, thus they generate and complete without ceasing,
and governance does not require much speaking.
Much speaking without reverence leads to exhaustion—
it is better to attend to affairs of non-action,
to practice teaching that requires no words.

This is the substance of embracing the Dao,
the essence of preserving life—
the art of guarding the center.

The Canon states:
The spirit of the valley does not die—
this is called the mysterious mother.
The mysterious mother’s gate—
this is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
Enduring as if it exists, yet its use is not exhausted.

The Transmission says:
The "valley" symbolizes the Dao’s essence,
the "spirit" signifies the Dao’s function.
True essence, wondrous function—
responding to things without end.
Thus it is said: the spirit of the valley does not die.

Only when the spirit of the valley does not die
can one exhaust the essence and function of Heaven and Earth.
The "mysterious" is Heaven’s essence,
the "mother" is Earth’s function.
To embody the mysterious and employ the mother—
this is the sage’s art,
thus it is called the mysterious mother.

The mysterious mother’s art
is the opening and closing of yin and yang,
the unmeasurable transformations.
Opening and closing are the Dao of yin and yang,
and yin and yang are the foundation of Heaven and Earth—
thus the mysterious mother’s gate is called the root of Heaven and Earth,
enduring as if it has no end.

Its essence does not perish,
its function does not labor—
this is called: the king follows Earth,
Earth follows Heaven,
Heaven follows the Dao,
the Dao follows Nature.

The Sage nourishes the people yet does not nourish himself,
thus his teaching endures long, resembling Heaven and Earth.
Therefore, he does not dare to lead the world first—
then he delights in promoting others without tiring;
he does not dare to possess himself—
then he sacrifices his body without peril.
Truly, only because he does not selfishly hold onto himself
can he then possess the world.

**Scripture:** The highest excellence is like water.
Water excels in benefiting all things without striving,
dwelling where people despise—
thus it approaches the Dao.
Its dwelling is good as Earth,
its mind is deep as a well,
its giving is kind as virtue,
its speech is trustworthy as truth,
its governance is orderly as skill,
its actions are capable as ability,
its movements are timely as nature.
Only because it does not contend
is it without blame.

**Commentary:** Those who follow the Dao have no failing,
thus they are called the highest excellence.
Water always rests in filth below,
does not contend with things,
so all things gain their benefit—
truly, it is close to the Dao.
Thus, the highest excellence is like this water’s virtue:
its dwelling in the world is like water on the earth,
its mind is like water’s depth and return,
its giving is like water’s nourishment,
its speech is like water’s truthfulness,
its governance is like water’s clarity and stillness,
its actions are like water’s adaptability,
its changes are like water’s response to time.
Only because it always rests in filth below,
no one can harm it;
only because it does not contend with things,
no thing contends with it.
The *Classic of Changes* says: "The humble hold the key to virtue."
Water embodies this.

**Scripture:** To grasp and fill is not as good as stopping in time;
to sharpen by measuring is not long preserved.
Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can guard them;
wealth and honor bring arrogance, and one invites disaster.
When the work is done and the name is complete,
withdraw—this is the Dao of Heaven.

**Commentary:** To hold a great vessel and fill it to the brim,
though feared, is not as good as stopping early;
to occupy a high position and exceed limits,
though worried, is not as good as retiring early.
To grasp power and sharpen ambition,
though obtained, cannot be long preserved;
to hoard gold and jade in the hall,
though possessed, cannot be long guarded.
Noble yet arrogant invites ruin;
rich yet arrogant increases fault.
Arrogance arises from the heart,
disaster stems from oneself—
how can one blame Heaven or people?
Thus, those with the Dao,
when their work is done, do not claim it;
when their name is complete, they do not retain it;
they withdraw their body to preserve their return,
yield their position to avoid danger.
Like the cycles of the four seasons,
cold and heat alternate, and all things flourish—
is this not the Dao of Heaven?

**Scripture:** To carry the spirit and embrace Oneness—
can one avoid separation?
To concentrate the vital breath and govern softness—
can one be like an infant?
To purify and gaze into the mysterious—
can one be without flaw?
To love the people and govern the state—
can one act without action?
To open and close the Heavenly Gate—
can one be receptive as the female?
To be clear and all-pervading—
can one be without knowledge?
To give birth and nurture—
to give birth yet not possess,
to act yet not rely,
to grow yet not dominate—
this is called the mysterious virtue.

**Commentary:** *Load* means "husband," the beginning of speech.
The *spirit* is the start of life.
The *One* is the child of the Dao.
To nurture the beginning, to embrace the child—
then spirit and form do not separate.
To focus on the harmonious and gentle,
to achieve a tranquil mind—
then nature and vital breath are like an infant.
To cleanse the heart and abandon perception—
what thought, what worry—
then the Dao and virtue are without blemish.
To love the people as one’s own children,
to govern the state as a small fresh fish—
each corrects themselves,
then one can act without action.
To follow Heaven and respond to change,
opening and closing in turn—
things transform of themselves,
then one can guard the receptive.
The Dao is not obscured,
virtue spreads broadly—
the people follow with their ears and eyes,
the Sage treats them as children,
then one can be without knowledge.
The first three are for cultivating oneself,
the latter three for governing the state.
To cultivate for oneself, its virtue is true;
to cultivate for the world, its virtue is universal.
Thus, only in this way
can one give birth and complete all things,
nurture and feed the people.
Only if one can give birth without possession,
act without arrogance,
nurture without domination—
then the Dao’s use extends deeply to things,
thus it is called the mysterious virtue.

**Scripture:** Thirty spokes meet at one hub,
yet it is the emptiness that gives the cart its use;
clay is shaped into vessels,
yet it is the emptiness that gives them their use;
doors and windows are carved for a room,
yet it is the emptiness that gives it its use.
Thus, what is has its advantage,
but what is not has its use.

**Commentary:** What is above form is called the Dao,
what is below form is called the instrument.
The Dao uses *not-being* for its function,
the instrument uses *being* for its advantage.
Yet what is has its advantage only because of what is not,
what is not has its use only because of what is.
Thus, the cart has spokes and hub to symbolize Heaven,
the room has doors and windows to symbolize Earth—
the cart and room’s full advantage
always lies in their emptiness,
is this not like the space between Heaven and Earth?
As for shaping clay into vessels,
their utility depends on fire and water—
only then can their use be spoken of,
just as the Sage, in completing instruments and lengthening life,
must first establish virtue and the Dao,
only then can teaching and transformation be practiced.
Thus, vessels of clay,
symbolizing humanity between Heaven and Earth,
illustrate the boundary between the Dao and instruments.

**Scripture:** The five colors blind the eyes,
the five tones deafen the ears,
the five flavors dull the palate,
galloping and hunting madden the mind,
rare treasures disrupt conduct.
Therefore, the Sage acts for the belly, not for the eyes,
thus he discards the latter for the former.

**Commentary:** The eyes do not see formless rites—this is blindness,
the ears do not hear soundless music—this is deafness,
the mouth does not taste the Dao’s flavor—this is dullness.
These three afflictions arise from the bewitchment of the five colors, five tones, and five flavors.
Bewildered by externals, one is confused within—
thus the Sage fears them.

The Sage does not fall ill because he fears illness itself.
Alas! Among desires, none is more rampant than hunting in wilds—
when indulged, the heart grows mad as if stricken by disease.
Among possessions, none is more burdensome than a hall filled with treasures—
to hoard them brings obstruction to conduct.
To remove this obstruction, one must not accumulate excess;
to cure this madness, one must only conquer the mind and become Sage#1.
Thus, acting for the belly brings contentment,
while acting for the eyes breeds craving.
Hence, discard the great bewitchment;
embrace this mysterious virtue.

**Scripture:**
Honor and disgrace strike like sudden alarm—
treating great calamity as one’s own body.
What is meant by "honor and disgrace strike like alarm"?
Honor is lowly—gaining it causes alarm,
losing it causes alarm—
this is called "honor and disgrace strike like alarm."
What is meant by "treating great calamity as one’s own body"?
My great calamity arises from having a body.
When I have no body, what calamity do I have?
Thus, to hold the body as the world’s treasure is as if one could entrust the world to it;
to love the body as the world is as if one could deposit the world in it.

**Commentary:**
Honor and disgrace are the constant emotions of flourishing and withering.
To be alarmed is the ordinary mind toward gain and loss.
When virtue and Dao fill the inner self,
external things cannot sway one—
thus, when honor and disgrace arrive, the heart never stirs.
This is the highest of scholars.
If the inner self is not at peace,
and one is moved by external things,
emotions cling to honor and disgrace,
gain and loss both strike like alarm—
this is the lesser path.
Since the heart’s movements differ only in degree from alarm,
it is called "as if" alarmed.
Elevation must have lowliness as its foundation,
disgrace must have honor as its root—
thus, disgrace and honor are like echoes following sound.
Fortune harbors misfortune within,
honor leans on disgrace.
When sound is struck, the echo responds;
when honor arrives, disgrace follows.
Common sentiment pursues superficiality,
thus alarmed by disgrace but not by honor,
while the Dao-heart observes the root—
alarmed by honor and more so by disgrace.
Thus it is said, "Honor is lowly,"
meaning honor is the root of disgrace,
the reason it can strike like alarm.
Initially, "honor and disgrace strike like alarm" seems balanced,
but later, only honor is called lowly,
while gain and loss strike like alarm—
this clarifies that alarm at honor is the root.

Moreover, great calamity refers to matters of fortune and misfortune.
Having a body is the source of great calamity.
Thus, clinging to one’s body brings great calamity—
so to value the body is to value great calamity.
Alas! To value great calamity is already extreme confusion.
Speaking of common sentiment’s deeper delusion,
it has not yet reached valuing the body—
thus it says, "value calamity as one’s body,"
mocking the extreme of valuing the body.

What the world calls fortune is wealth, honor, celebration, and reward—
yet one constantly fears losing them.
What the world calls misfortune is poverty, lowliness, punishment, and penalty—
yet one constantly fears gaining them.
To fear gaining and fear losing brings anxiety—
thus, the world’s anxieties are none greater than fortune and misfortune.
The Sage takes the people’s heart as his own,
so he also takes fortune and misfortune as his anxieties.
Yet the root of anxiety lies in the body—
who in the world has no self?
The body does not merge with things,
and groups divide, clustering in kinds,
love and hate attacking each other—
once fortune and misfortune arise, anxiety follows.
The Perfect Man embodies the Dao without self,
harmonizing with all things, blending with dust,
growing without domination—
though he shares breath with the people,
he does not share the Sage’s anxieties.
But if one’s heart is moved by gain and loss,
and distinctions of self and other linger in the mind,
then honor and disgrace never bring lasting peace,
fortune and misfortune never cease—
how can one be the world’s standard,
or dwell in the center’s greatness?

Only those who value using their body for the world,
and love using their body for the world,
are truly valuing and loving the world,
not their bodies.
Thus, gain and loss lie beyond themselves,
and anxiety is not their burden.
This is as if the great position could be entrusted to them—
yet they dare not rule it themselves,
much less claim ownership.
This is the Way’s practice,
the intention of making the world public.

**Scripture:**
To gaze and not see is called *yí* (夷),
to listen and not hear is called *xī* (希),
to grasp and not hold is called *wēi* (微).
These three cannot be questioned or examined,
so they merge into one.
Its upper reaches are not bright,
its lower depths are not dark—
endless and nameless, returning to nothingness,
this is called the form of formlessness,
the image of no-image—
this is called *hǔnhǔn* (惚怳).
Approach it and you see no head,
follow it and you see no tail.
Holding the ancient Way,
to govern the present.
To know the ancient beginning
is called the Dao’s foundation.

**Commentary:**
What is visible when gazed upon is color.
What is heard when listened to is sound.
What is grasped when seized is form.
All things under Heaven possess these,
yet the Dao lies between Heaven and all things,
neither color, sound, nor form—
thus it cannot be obtained by ear, eye, hand, or foot.
Yet though formless, it shapes all forms,
colors all colors, sounds all sounds—
hence it is forcibly named *xī-yí-wēi*.
But since it cannot be questioned or examined,
these three merge into one.
Above, the sun and moon shine together, yet its light is not bright;
below, it rests with tiles and rubble in stillness, yet its clarity is not dark.
Endlessly flowing without interruption,
it cannot be named—
though it undergoes myriad transformations, it returns to nothingness.
Yet the Dao’s essence is true and refined,
originally not nothingness—
it is simply not obtainable by sight, hearing, or touch.
Thus it is called the form of no-form,
the image of no-image.
Speaking of its form, it suddenly seems nonexistent;
speaking of its image, it faintly seems present.
No one knows its beginning,
so approaching it reveals no head;
no one knows its end,
so following it reveals no tail.

Only those who grasp the Dao of ancient *wuwei*—
who wield the names of present *youwei*—
can thus return to primordial simplicity,
recovering the purity of the earliest antiquity.

To know the pristine simplicity of antiquity’s beginning
is the very framework of the Great Dao,
the essential foundation of teaching and transformation.

**Scripture says:**
The ancient adept was subtle, profound, and unfathomable,
so deep that none could truly perceive him.

Since he could not be perceived,
he feigned outward forms:
Cautious as one crossing a winter river,
apprehensive as if fearing watchful neighbors,
solemn as a guest,
dissolving like ice about to thaw,
solid yet unadorned—
plain as uncarved wood,
vast as an empty valley,
muddy yet undisturbed.

Who could still the turbid and let clarity emerge?
Who could remain still and yet let life stir?

Those who uphold this Dao do not seek fullness.
Because they do not seek fullness,
they endure without renewal—
their essence never fades.

**Transmission says:**
The virtue’s workings are subtle and profound,
the Dao’s essence unfathomable.
Since its depths are hidden and hard to know,
it is given outward symbols:
In advancing, cautious as one crossing a boundless river;
in halting, wary as if neighbors were aware;
in solemnity, dignified as host and guest in audience.

In its expansion, vast as spring ice about to dissolve.

Its substance is solid yet plain as uncarved wood,
its vessel is spacious as mountains with valleys,
its heart is muddy yet undisturbed.

These are the outward forms of the virtuous scholar’s Dao and virtue—
yet common folk cannot recognize them.

Who could follow the world’s turbidity and still it to clarity,
letting its flow emerge pure?
Who could embrace the world’s ease and stir it to action,
letting its teachings arise?

Only those who deeply grasp the subtle interplay of ebb and flow,
of fullness and emptiness,
can uphold this Dao and align with Heaven’s course.

For only when virtue is not full does the Dao not falter—
following its light to govern with clarity,
embracing its stillness to observe life’s stir—
then can one act through decay and achieve governance,
without needing novelty to transform.

**Scripture says:**
To perfect emptiness and steadfastly guard stillness—
when all things arise together, I observe their return.

All things teeming, each returns to its root.
Returning to root is called stillness,
stillness is called restoring the Mandate,
restoring the Mandate is called constancy,
knowing constancy is called wisdom.
To not know constancy is reckless action—disaster.
To know constancy is to bear with it,
to bear with it is to be impartial,
impartiality is called kingship,
kingship is called Heaven,
Heaven is called the Dao,
the Dao is called enduring,
dying without beginning.

**Transmission says:**
To govern with profound emptiness and subtle perfection—
this is the use of virtue.
To guard stillness with focused sincerity—
this is the essence of the Dao.

Its use knows no bounds, so all things arise together;
its essence is serene, thus it observes their return.

Thunder in the earth—this is Heaven and Earth’s return;
movement within stillness—this is the Sage’s return.
Return reveals Heaven and Earth’s heart.
Heaven and Earth take the Sage’s heart as their own.

Thus all things, teeming, return to their root;
all affairs, scattered, return to principle.
Principle is the source of affairs,
stillness is the sovereign of movement,
nature is the root of emotion.

Man is born in stillness—Heaven’s nature;
when moved by things, it is human emotion.
When emotion returns to nature,
when movement returns to stillness,
then Heaven’s principle is fulfilled.

*The Classic of Changes* says:
To exhaust principle and perfect nature until reaching Mandate.
Thus to exhaust Heaven’s principle is to perfect human nature;
to perfect human nature is to know Heaven’s Mandate.

Hence it is said:
Returning to root is called stillness,
stillness is called restoring the Mandate.
From the perspective of Heaven’s Mandate,
the nature of all things becomes visible.

Thus it is said:
Heaven’s Mandate is called nature,
the utmost of nature and Mandate is called profound mystery.
Yet nature and Mandate’s principle arise from this mystery,
so to follow one’s nature is to enter the profound.

The profound can illuminate principle,
illuminating principle is called the Dao—
to cultivate the Dao is to return to nature.
To interact with things is called teaching,
thus it is said:
Following nature is called the Dao,
cultivating the Dao is called teaching.

Thus the teaching that can be passed on lies in perfecting it,
the Dao that can endure lies in nature’s fulfillment.
The profound’s essence is deep and unrecognizable—
the benevolent are hindered by their perceptions,
the common folk use it without knowing,
so those who embody the Dao are rare indeed.

Hence it is said:
To inherit is perfection,
to perfect is nature.
The benevolent see it as benevolence,
the wise see it as wisdom,
the common folk use it daily without knowing—
thus the Sage’s Way is scarce.

Manifest in benevolence, hidden in use,
stirring all things yet not sharing the Sage’s concerns—
great virtue and achievement indeed!

This is Confucius’ ultimate discourse on the depths of Dao and virtue,
the mystery of nature and Mandate.

The Dao endures because it skillfully responds to all things,
yet all things cannot burden it.
Only those who know the Dao’s constancy
can constantly benefit all things without being burdened.

Its use is subtle, its principle clear—
thus to know its constancy is called inheriting clarity.

To not know how to benefit all things,
yet to recklessly impose laws and teachings—
then the people of the world will suffer harm.

Only those who know the constant Dao and clearly benefit all things,
like Heaven and Earth’s nurturing cover,
without partiality toward any,
will have the people follow and revere them,
thus aligning with the Dao’s constancy
and enduring without regret throughout life.

**Scripture says:**
The most exalted—
the next rank knows of their existence;
the next, they are cherished and praised;

The next rank fears them and reviles them.
Trust is insufficient, so there is distrust.
Yet they still prize their words.

When deeds are accomplished and affairs completed,
the people say of them, *"It was as if by nature."*

**Tradition says:**
In the age of ancient virtue, the sovereigns
did nothing and made no advances,
so the common folk knew only of their rulers’ existence,
saying, *"What power does the Emperor have over me?"*

When virtue declined, seven principles were instituted for governance.
The world was covered by their benevolence, so they were cherished;
they were held in their righteousness, so they were praised.

When benevolence and righteousness were insufficient to govern the heart,
they ruled through penal codes and laws, so the people feared them.
When penal codes and laws were insufficient to restrain their intentions,
they resorted to stratagems and deceit, so the common folk reviled them.

Ah! When the heart is sincere, it is called *xìn* (trustworthiness);
when words can be relied upon, it is called *xìn* (faithfulness).
If sincerity is not genuine and words cannot be trusted,
yet they still prize empty boasts—
can this be called *chéngxìn* (sincerity and trustworthiness)?

When Dao and virtue are obscured,
benevolence and righteousness become prominent.
When benevolence and righteousness fail to take root,
penal codes and laws are enforced—
yet they still exalt superficial techniques—
can this be called *dàodé* (Dao and virtue)?

The Sage acts differently:
holding fast to the ancient while governing the present,
cutting away ornament to return to simplicity,
accomplishing deeds without clinging,
completing affairs without action,
having law yet no law,
adapting to the times for their work.

Thus the people naturally fulfill their true nature,
all saying, *"It is as if by nature, naturally so,"*
so the hearts of cherishing, praising, fearing, and reviling
never arise in the world.

**Scripture says:**
When the Great Dao is abandoned,
there is benevolence and righteousness.

Wisdom arises, yet great deceit follows;
six kinds of kin grow discordant, yet filial piety and kindness emerge.
When states fall into chaos, loyal ministers appear.

**Commentary says:**
The Master Lao’s teachings hold fast to the ancient while governing the present,
thus discerning the inevitable principles—
these are actions taken when there is no other choice.
Later generations failed to grasp his intent,
and so claimed his teachings conflicted with Confucius—
this is the case here and in the following chapter.
Alas, the Master Lao has been maligned for so long—
now I clarify and illuminate his words.

Does not the *Records* say:
When the Great Dao prevails,
people do not merely love their own kin,
nor merely cherish their own children.
They abhor wealth discarded upon the earth,
yet do not hoard it for themselves;
they abhor strength unused in service,
yet do not claim it for themselves alone.
Thus, deceitful plots do not arise,
bandits and rebels do not act,
outer doors remain unbarred—
this is called *Dàtóng* (Great Harmony).
At such times,
people draw water from wells,
till fields for food,
rise with the sun and rest with the setting—
what power does the Sage exert over them?
The common folk merely recognize its existence—
how could benevolence and righteousness intervene?

When the Great Dao is obscured,
people love only their own kin,
cherish only their own children,
hoard wealth and strength for themselves,
and employ benevolence and righteousness to govern—
to rectify the relations of ruler and subject,
to strengthen father and son,
to harmonize brothers,
to unite husband and wife.
The people cherish and praise them,
and thus benevolence and righteousness become prominent.
From this perspective,
when simplicity scatters into tools,
is it not the case that when the Great Dao is abandoned,
benevolence and righteousness arise?
Hence, Confucius sighed at the *Zhuō Bīn* banquet,
while the Master Lao expounded in *Dàodé Jīng*—
their intent was one and the same.

The Sage’s wisdom encompasses all things yet does not adorn conduct,
his enlightenment benefits the world yet does not flaunt righteousness.
At such times, people do not yet recognize wisdom as wisdom.
As the age declines and contention spreads,
men use wisdom to conceal deceit,
use enlightenment to undermine righteousness—
then the arts of wisdom become apparent,
while the traces of deceit are concealed.
Is it not so that wisdom arises, yet great deceit follows?

Thus, the *Two Observances* condemned Zhòng Zhèng Mào,
and the *Spring and Autumn Annals* recorded the treachery of Chu Zǐ Qián—
then how different were Confucius’ intentions from those of the Master Lao?

As for the Way of father and son,
it is innate human nature.
Following nature’s harmony,
parents and children naturally grow close—
who would know filial piety and kindness?
Yet when external influences seduce,
nature transforms into emotion,
and when questioned, some stray from their innate nature.
The Sage cultivates the Dao as teaching to harmonize the world,
so that parents and children mutually love one another,
and the names of filial piety and kindness become prominent—
thus it is said: *When six kinds of kin are discordant, filial piety and kindness emerge.*
Hence, even though the blind historian was dull-witted,
Shun was called a great filial son;
though Zēng Zhè was stern,
Zǐ Sān was praised for his filial care—
this is the inevitable principle.
How could the Master Lao oppose it?

When a flying dragon soars in the sky,
virtuous men occupy high positions,
and ministers support the ruler without obstruction—
then loyal ministers do not appear.
But when the ruler above is benighted
and the people below are in chaos,
only then do ministers risk their lives for the state,
utter words that grieve the heart and offend the ear—
thus it is said: *When states fall into chaos, loyal ministers appear.*
Hence, when Jiè of Xia was enthroned,
Lóng Féng’s loyalty shone forth;
when Jǐn of Shang perished,
Bǐ Gān’s defiance emerged—
these are actions taken when there is no other choice—
how could the Master Lao oppose them?

If scholars grasp his intent,
then the methods of Confucius and Lao are not in conflict.

**Scripture says:**
Abandon the Sage, discard wisdom—
the people’s benefit increases a hundredfold.
Abandon benevolence, discard righteousness—
the people return to filial piety and kindness.
Abandon cleverness, discard profit—
thieves and robbers vanish.
These three are insufficient as doctrine,
so they are assigned their proper place.
Embrace simplicity, hold fast to purity,
reduce private desires and few wants.

**Commentary says:**
The Sage’s wisdom benefits creatures,
yet some suffer harm from its use—
thus blame is wrongly placed upon the Sage’s wisdom,
and some say to abandon and discard it,
so that the people’s benefit may increase a hundredfold.
Benevolence and righteousness harmonize the people,
yet some incur resentment from their use—
thus blame is wrongly placed upon benevolence and righteousness,
and some say to abandon and discard them,
so that the six kinds of kin may be harmonized.
Cleverness and profit aid people,
yet some turn to theft from their use—
thus blame is wrongly placed upon cleverness and profit,
and some say to abandon and discard them,
so that robberies and assaults may cease.

Harm and benefit arise together,
like form and shadow inseparable—
natural principles cannot be extinguished.
Some, blinded by the decay of the age,
fail to perceive how decay begets renewal—
they say to abandon and discard,
so as to return to ancient beginnings—
this is like hating shadows yet unaware that light requires darkness,
and thus seeking to erase form itself.

The Master Lao lamented that people had long strayed from the Dao,
and refuted these erroneous arguments,
claiming that doctrine alone is insufficient to govern—
thus he especially emphasized these three,
clarifying that this was not his intent.

I differ.
The Sage’s wisdom is the master of crafted tools.
Benevolence and righteousness are the virtues of social relations.
Cleverness and profit are the skills of artisans.
If their use becomes corrupt,
I must adjust and rectify them—
this is the principle: *Decay begets renewal*,
the constant way to rescue what is flawed.

Thus, the method of rectification is to assign them their proper place—
to still the turbid with quiet patience,
to move the settled with gentle action.
By guiding transformation gradually,
people naturally embrace simplicity and purity,
reduce private desires and few wants.

Alas, those who embrace simplicity and purity
become honest and approach benevolence;
those who reduce private desires and few wants
become sincere and love righteousness.
From this point backward, the progression is clear—
how could the Master Lao’s teachings conflict with Confucius’?

Moreover, this chapter concludes with *reduce private desires and few wants*—
how then could *abandon benevolence and discard righteousness* be his intent?

**Scripture says:**
Abandon learning, have no worries.

The **"Yes" and the "Ah"**—how far apart are they?
The **good and the evil**—how distant are they?

What people fear, one must not fail to fear.
Oh, the vastness! It knows no end.

The multitude bustles joyfully,
as if feasting on the grandest sacrifice,
as if ascending the Spring Terrace.
Yet I alone stand trembling, still unmanifest—
like an infant before its first smile.

Dull and listless, as if lacking,
as if homeless with nowhere to return.
The multitude all have abundance,
while I alone seem forsaken.

Ah, my foolish heart—
pure and unadorned.
The vulgar shine brightly,
while I alone seem dim;
the vulgar scrutinize keenly,
while I alone remain obscured.

Serene as the boundless sea,
swift as the wind with no rest.
The multitude all act with purpose,
while I alone seem stubborn and crude.

I alone differ from others,
and cherish the **Mother**.

**Commentary says:**
This chapter’s profound meaning aligns with the last.
The **Sage’s** learning is for the **Dao**—
when the **Dao** prevails, the world is ordered.
The vulgar’s learning is for gain—
when gain prevails, the world descends into chaos.

Some detest the vulgar’s learning for its chaos,
and thus claim abandoning it brings no worry—
yet this leads the superficial to never grasp the **Dao**.

The Master Lao outlines its essence,
discussing its gains and losses.
He says: In human responses, a single word suffices.
Speak **"Yes"** and people call it **reverence**,
speak **"Ah"** and people call it **arrogance**.
Yet to use arrogance as reverence,
without adding more words,
yet failing to use **"Ah"** as **"Yes"**
makes for a rude exchange.

Similarly, the world’s learners all study for learning’s sake—
studying the **Dao**, the world calls it **good**,
studying for gain, the world calls it **evil**.
To take gain as the **Dao**,
when reflected upon, may seem right,
yet failing to turn **evil** into **good**
leads only to the world’s chaos.

**"Yes" and "Ah"**—when compared, how slight their difference—
yet **good and evil**—how vast their separation!

Now, at the most simple truth,
one can achieve the most difficult deeds,
yet cannot reverse and act upon it—
this is why the Master Lao sighs in lament.

Thus, he lays bare the world’s failings,
to correct what the **Dao** attains.

The terror of laws and punishments—
what the world commonly fears.
Even the virtuous cannot fail to fear them.
Why?
For as the teachings decay,
calamities arise,
excessive punishments prevail,
and threaten even the good—
oh, the ruin! It knows no end—how fearful!

The joy of rank and reward—
what the world delights in.
To fulfill desire,
it is like arraying the finest vessels for the grandest feast;
to achieve ambition,
it is like ascending the terrace to behold the spring blossoms.

Even the virtuous cannot refuse them—
yet when obtained, they take it calmly, without joy,
like an infant before its first smile.
In their possession, they are dull and listless,
as if lacking, as if a homeless man with nowhere to return.

The vulgar prize intelligence and strength,
always seeming to have excess.
The virtuous, however, embrace simplicity and weakness,
always seeming to lack.

Is it not like the dull and ignorant,
whose hearts know nothing?
No—it is their nature, pure and unadorned,
without striving for cleverness.

The vulgar, shining brightly, take clarity as virtue,
while the virtuous, dimly obscured, take obscurity as **virtue**.
The vulgar, keenly discerning, take exposing deceit as skill,
while the virtuous, quietly steadfast, take knowing the constant as the **Dao**.

Thus, in stillness, they are vast as the unfathomable sea,
in motion, swift as the wind with no end.
The multitude act with purpose—
I alone seem idle, crude, and base.

Thus, while all chase after trifles,
loving to nourish their **child**—
I alone return to the root,
and cherish the **Mother**.

The **Mother** is the **Dao**.
The **child** is the **One**.
To love and nourish the **child** is to indulge desires with the vital essence;
to cherish the **Mother** is to return to purity and stillness in the **Dao**.

**Scripture:**
The appearance of **virtue**—
It follows only the **Dao**.
The **Dao** as a thing—
It is vague and indistinct.
Vague and indistinct it is,
Yet within it there are forms;
Indistinct and elusive it is,
Yet within it there are things.
Deep and dark it is,
Yet within it there is **qi**—
Its **qi** is most true,
Within it lies **faith**.
From ancient times to the present,
Its name does not vanish,
To observe and encompass all **spontaneity**.
How do I know that all **spontaneity** is thus?
By this.

**Transmission:**
The **virtue** of emptiness and space
Encompasses all things—
It follows only the **Dao** of true **qi**.
Yet the **Dao** as a thing—
Vague as if it exists,
Elusive as if it does not,
Cannot be fixedly spoken of.
How so?
For it is **stillness** and **void** without form,
Unable to be grasped as existing yet manifesting myriad forms,
Or as **thousand transformations and ten thousand changes**,
Ultimately returning to **nothingness**.
Though vague and elusive, existing and non-existing are indeterminate,
Deep and dark, yin and yang are unfathomable,
Yet the **faith** of true **qi** abides between them.

When **pure** and **unadulterated**, it is called **qi**;
When **spontaneous**, it is called **true**;
When **utter sincerity**, it is called **faith**.
Thus, **utter sincerity** is its function,
**Pure qi** is its **body**;
When **body** and function merge mysteriously,
It is called **spontaneous**—
The **Dao** follows **spontaneity**.

How do I know that **spontaneity** is true?
For its name, from ancient times to the present,
Endures as the **Dao**—
Its name never departs.
Because its name never departs,
It can observe and encompass all **spontaneity**.

**Spontaneity** refers to those who observe and encompass all things’ **spontaneity**.
How do I know that all things’ names can be observed?
For all things’ names are not fixed names,
Thus their names change with the world and perish.
Only the **Dao**’s enduring name does not vanish,
Thus it can observe names that can be named.

Only those who know the **Dao**’s name
Can govern and respond to affairs.
Though myriad things arise daily before us,
I alone remain **non-doing** yet govern.

**Scripture:**
The crooked becomes whole,
The bent becomes straight,
The hollow becomes full,
The worn becomes new,
The few gain,
The many are confused.
Thus the Sage embraces **One** as the model for all under heaven.
Not self-assertive, hence **illuminated**;
Not self-righteous, hence **manifest**;
Not self-praising, hence **accomplished**;
Not self-glorifying, hence **enduring**.
Only because he does not contend,
All under heaven cannot contend with him.

The ancients’ saying *"The crooked becomes whole"*—
Was it mere idle talk?
Thus I sincerely affirm it as whole and return to it.

**Transmission:**
When the crooked is fulfilled without omission, affairs are whole;
When one bends himself to extend things, principles become straight.
When desires are few, affairs return to their root—
Thus the hollow becomes full;
When the turbid is still, principles become clear—
Thus the worn becomes new;
When affairs return to principles,
Thus the few gain;
When principles conflict with affairs,
Thus the many are confused.

The Sage knows the **Dao**’s **laws**,
Embraces the **Dao**’s **One**,
To harmonize affairs with principles,
To harmonize principles with affairs—
When affairs and principles merge in **mystery**,
Thus he can serve as the **Dao**’s pattern for all under heaven.

Not self-assertive yet **illuminating** others,
Not self-righteous yet **manifesting** truth;
Not self-praising his talents,
Thus affairs return to reality—
Hence governance achieves **accomplishment**;
Not self-glorifying his abilities,
Thus principles attain their due—
Hence the **Dao** endures.

Only by following the **Dao**’s principles,
Not contending with things,
All under heaven’s affairs follow him.

Thus he can fulfill all things’ crookedness without omitting the minute and hidden,
This is the ancients’ saying *"The crooked becomes whole"*—
Was it mere idle talk?
If he can truly fulfill the crookedness,
Then all under heaven will be whole and return to him.

**Scripture:**
Desiring few words, **spontaneity** is achieved.
A gusting wind does not last through the morning,
A sudden rain does not last through the day.
Who does this?
The heavens and earth.
Heaven and earth still cannot endure,
How much more so for man?
Thus those who practice the **Dao**—
The **Dao**-practitioner aligns with the **Dao**,
The **virtue**-practitioner aligns with **virtue**,
The **loss**-practitioner aligns with **loss**.
The **Dao**-practitioner,
The **Dao** also attains;
The **virtue**-practitioner,
**Virtue** also attains;
The **loss**-practitioner,
**Loss** also attains.
Thus, **faith** insufficient,
There is **unfaith**.

**Transmission:**
The Master Lao was about to implement the **teaching of non-speaking**,
To align with **spontaneity**’s principles,
Thus he marked and named it.
The **Scripture** says:
*"Listening yet not hearing"* is called **few words**.
Thus, **few words** is akin to **non-speaking**.

Zhongni said:
*"How does the heavens speak?
The four seasons proceed in its course,
The myriad things are born from it."*
Again it says:
*"The heavens does not speak yet is **faith**-ful."*
This is the **Dao**’s **spontaneity**.

The **spontaneity**’s principles
Are the **Dao**’s constant.
Like the four seasons’ course,
The heavens and earth’s constant,
Thus they endure unceasingly,
Ending yet beginning anew.

The gusting wind and sudden rain
Are not the heavens and earth’s constant,
Thus their arising is abrupt,
Their cessation is fleeting.

Though the heavens and earth are vast,
They still cannot endure this unnaturalness,
How much more so for humanity,
Can it endure unnaturalness for long?

**Virtue** and **Dao** hidden,
**Ren** and **yi** not practiced,
**Ritual propriety** and **punishments** become burdensome—
They are done only out of necessity.
Yet the confused cannot know **ritual propriety**,
Taking **punishments** as the greatest **punishment**,
Aspiring to the **Dao**’s **non-action**,
Yet desiring to grasp one side,
Saying it can be practiced for **hundred generations**—
This is an error.

Ah! The gusting wind and sudden rain
Have their time to cease,
The four seasons’ course never ends,
**Spontaneity**’s principles
Cannot be altered.

Thus those who practice the **Dao**
Are **Dao**-embodiments.
Following **spontaneity**,
They do not lose the **Dao**’s constant,
Thus the **Dao** also attains them—
They align with the **Dao**.

Those who practice **virtue**
Are **virtue**-users.
Though they lose the **Dao**’s constant,
They do not lose **virtue**’s constant—
Thus **virtue** also attains them—
They align with **virtue**.

Those who practice **loss**
Have already lost in **virtue** and **Dao**,
And also lost in **Ren** and **yi**,
Thus **loss** also attains them—
They align with **loss**.

The *Records* say:
*"Doing good differently, yet all return to **governance**;
Doing evil differently, yet all return to **chaos**."*

Ah, this is nearly true.

Alas, how unreliable is trust when it falters!
Thus, when one is forced to act against their will,
Yet still acts—how deeply confused they are!

The *Classics* say:
*"Those who stand on tiptoe cannot stand firm,
Those who stride cannot walk steadily.
Those who see only themselves are blind,
Those who insist on being right are never clear,
Those who boast of their own deeds achieve nothing,
Those who pride themselves in their abilities do not endure.
As for the Dao,
It is like surplus food or burdensome baggage—
Things others despise, so those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon them."*

The *Transmission* says:
*"Those who cling to profit cannot stand firm in the constant Dao,
Those who straddle desire cannot walk steadily in the constant name.
If the roots of desire and profit are not forgotten,
Yet one claims, ‘I can bring governance,’
There is no way to do so."*

Thus, when one obscures others by self-regard, affairs become unclear;
When one contradicts others by self-righteousness, principles are not revealed;
When one boasts of one’s talents, governance yields no fruit;
When one vaunts one’s abilities, the Dao does not endure.
These four afflictions share the same malady as tiptoeing and striding—
None are sufficient to achieve governance.

If we speak of the Dao,
To discard surplus food is not enough to satisfy hunger,
To bear burdensome baggage is exceedingly ugly—
Even ordinary things are despised, so how can those who follow the Dao dwell upon them?

The *Classics* say:
*"There exists a formless substance,
Born before Heaven and Earth.
Silent and boundless,
It stands alone yet never changes,
Circulates endlessly yet never falters—
It can be the mother of all under Heaven.
I do not know its name,
So I call it the Dao.
Forced to name it, I call it Great.
Great means passing,
Passing means distant,
Distant means returning."*

Thus, the Dao is great,
Heaven is great,
Earth is great,
The Sage-King is great.
Therefore, within the realm, there are four greats,
And the Sage-King occupies one of them.

Humans model Earth,
Earth models Heaven,
Heaven models the Dao,
The Dao models spontaneity.

The *Transmission* says:
*The *Yijing* says: "The Great Polarity (*Taiji*) is the origin of the Two Principles (*liangyi*)."
Thus, we know that the formless substance
Was born before Heaven and Earth.
Silent and without trace,
It stands independent beyond all transformations,
Yet its essence never changes;
Boundless and formless,
It circulates within all things,
Yet its function never falters.
Thus, it can generate all kinds,
And be the master of all affairs.*

*The *Zhongyong* says: "Its nature is not dual,
Thus its creation of things is unfathomable."
Therefore, the Great Polarity is the beginning of the Great Unfolding (*Taiyuan*),
And the formless substance is the mother of all under Heaven.
Its essence cannot be named and grasped,
Thus its name is unknown.
Its function cannot be said to lack a name,
Thus it is called the Dao.
Names arise from things, and things give rise to names—
Since we have given it a name, we know it has a name.
Yet tracing its name reveals no clear meaning,
Examining its function reveals its utmost greatness—
Thus, we forcibly name its function as Great.
When speaking of its function, we call it Great,
But when speaking of its essence, it has already passed away.
How distant is the name from the reality?
It is said: its distance is not far—
It lies in knowing its return.
To return from name to reality,
To return from affairs to principle—
Greatly applied to family and state,
Slightly applied to self and mind—
If one cannot reflect inwardly, the principle of Heaven is extinguished.
Thus, the *Records* say:
*"The Dao is not distant from people;
People distance themselves from the Dao,
And those who distance themselves cannot be the Dao.*
Again, it says:
*"The Dao cannot be separated for even a moment;
If it can be separated, it is not the Dao."*

Thus, the earlier statement—
*"There exists a formless substance,
Born before Heaven and Earth"*—
Is the nameless Dao.
The later statement—
*"Passing means distant,
Distant means returning"*—
Is the named Dao.
Therefore, when the four greats of the realm are raised,
The Sage-King occupies one of them,
To make clear that the Sage-King participates in Heaven and Earth’s Dao,
And assists in the transformation and nurturing of all things.

Ah, the realm’s clouds—
This makes clear that the Dao is not beyond the six directions.
Thus, those who rule over people
Should model Earth’s stillness,
To make their essence still;
Then model Heaven’s movement,
To make their function active;
Then model the Dao’s effortless yet all-accomplishing.
Once they can effortlessly yet all-accomplish,
Then they can model spontaneity,
And all under Heaven will not know how it is done.

The *Classics* say:
*"Substance is the root of the insubstantial,
Stillness is the master of the restless.*
Thus, the virtuous person walks all day without leaving their baggage.
Though they enjoy splendid sights,
Their hearts remain serene and detached.

How can the ruler of ten thousand chariots
Lightly cast aside the weight of all under Heaven?
Lightness leads to losing one’s foundation,
Restlessness leads to losing one’s master."

The *Transmission* says:
*"All things, though diverse,
Each return to their roots—
Thus, substance can be the root of the insubstantial.
All under Heaven’s movement is steadfast in One—
Thus, stillness can be the master of the restless.*

Those who travel far carry their baggage all day,
Yet never stray far from their heavy loads—
For their clothing and food depend upon them.
If they abandon it and stray far,
They will soon be exhausted and stranded upon the road.
Thus, the virtuous person’s heart always aligns with the Dao,
Though externally surrounded by dazzling splendor and luxury,
Internally they remain settled in simplicity,
Serene and unattached—
This is the art of taking substance as root and stillness as master.

The ruler of ten thousand chariots
Does so because all under Heaven is their burden.
How can they lightly use their body without regard for all under Heaven?
Lightness leads to losing the foundation of national stability,
Restlessness leads to losing Earth’s masterly stillness.

The people are the root of the state—
If the root is firm, the state is at peace.
This is the constant way of all sovereigns.
To cherish them brings loyalty,
To harm them brings vengeance—
This is the constant sentiment of all under Heaven.

If those who rule over people
Lightly use their bodies,
Indulge desires without restraint,
Oppress the people,
And disregard all under Heaven,
Then the people will abandon them in droves.
Not only will they abandon them,
But they will rise to harm them as well.

Thus, the Old Master, moved with pity,
Repeatedly sighed and said:
*"To govern the self and mind,
Lightness leads to losing the return to root,
Restlessness leads to losing steadfast unity.
To govern all under Heaven,
Lightness leads to losing the foundation of national peace,
Restlessness leads to losing Earth’s masterly stillness."*

Ah, O Sovereign of the myriad chariots,
How can you not be weighty and tranquil?

**Scripture:**
The skilled traveler leaves no tracks,
The skilled speaker leaves no flaws to censure,
The skilled strategist needs no reckoning tools,
The skilled guardian needs no locks yet cannot be opened,
The skilled binder needs no cords yet cannot be undone.

Thus, the Sage always excels in saving people,
So there are none abandoned;
Always excels in saving things,
So there are none discarded—
This is called *clinging to clarity*.

Therefore, the virtuous become teachers for the unvirtuous,
And the unvirtuous become resources for the virtuous.
To not honor one’s teacher,
To not cherish one’s resource—
Though one may know much, it is utter confusion—
This is called the supreme subtlety.

**Transmission:**
The skilled traveler acts through the Dao.
The Dao is vast, so virtue spreads broadly—
Thus, no tracks remain to follow.
The skilled speaker relies on *name*.
When *name* is correct, reality is attained—
Thus, no flaws exist to censure.
The skilled strategist relies on *measure*.
When *measure* is clear, calculations are simple—
Thus, no reckoning tools are needed, yet intricate calculations are achieved.
The skilled guardian seals the *mouth* (of excess),
So the mind does not stir—
Thus, no locks are needed, yet it cannot be breached.
The skilled binder binds with *truth*,
So the mind does not stray—
Thus, no cords are needed, yet it cannot be undone.

Hence, the *Records* say:
Before mourning was practiced among the people,
The people mourned;
Before reverence was practiced among the people,
The people revered.
The Yin made oaths, and the people began to rebel;
The Zhou held assemblies, and the people began to doubt.
If one lacks the loyal, sincere, and grieving heart to govern,
Even the most firmly bound people will not remain steadfast.

Thus, these five skills are all the Sage’s essential methods of salvation.

As for people’s unvirtue—
What is there to abandon?

Therefore, the Son of Heaven establishes the Three Dukes,
To teach them.
To the virtuous, I am virtuous;
To the unvirtuous, I am also virtuous—
Thus, teaching abandons no one,
And use discards nothing—
This is the subtle art of *knowing the constant*,
Hence called *clinging to clarity*.

Why?
What the world values most is the teacher,
What the world cherishes most is the resource—
Yet the virtuous become teachers for the unvirtuous
Precisely because the unvirtuous become resources for the virtuous.
If there were no unvirtuous as resources,
The virtuous would have no one to teach.

Alas, when all under Heaven know virtue as virtue,
That is unvirtue;
When all under Heaven do not know virtue as virtue,
That is perfect virtue.

Now, those who do not honor their teachers
Do not wish to conform to what the multitude calls virtuous,
But to display what is unvirtuous;
Those who do not cherish their resources
Do not wish to use others’ unvirtue to perfect their own virtue.

Though one may know these words on dishonoring and disdaining teachers and resources
Are greatly misguided for the age,
Their essence is the subtle art of salvation—
The supreme refinement of method.

**Scripture:**
Know the *heroic* and hold to the *receptive*—
Thus, you become the valley of the world.
To be the valley of the world,
Your virtue remains unchanging—
Returning to the infant.
Know the *white* and hold to the *black*—
Thus, you become the model of the world.
To be the model of the world,
Your virtue does not err—
Returning to the boundless.
Know the *honored* and hold to the *humiliated*—
Thus, you become the valley of the world.
To be the valley of the world,
Your virtue is complete—
Returning to the uncarved.

The uncarved scatters to become things;
The Sage uses them to become officials and leaders—
Thus, the great measure is not cut.

**Transmission:**
Between Heaven and Earth,
All things function with the *heroic* strong and the *receptive* weak,
The male active and the female tranquil—
Even in rank and precedence, none deviate from this.

The Old Master delved deeply into the nature of things,
Established methods accordingly,
Knowing that weakness overcomes strength,
Thus using weakness as function,
Knowing that tranquility overcomes action,
Thus taking tranquility as master.

Therefore, he places himself last, yet leads first;
He lowers his path, yet it is held in highest esteem—
Thus, though he stands foremost, the people do not weary of him;
Though he is above, the people do not resent him.

Hence, knowing that the *heroic* cannot endure,
He guards himself with the *receptive*—
Thus, he can become the valley of the world.

The valley is used through its lowliness.
Only by embracing lowliness
Does virtue never depart.
When virtue does not depart,
One can align with the Dao—
Thus, returning to the infant,
Calm as if without knowledge.
Only by having no knowledge
Does the mind become clear.
Though one knows it is clear,
Yet guarding it in silent mystery—
Thus, one can become the model of the world.

The *model* is what can be imitated and followed.
Only what can be imitated and followed
Does virtue never stray.
When virtue does not stray,
One harmonizes with the Dao—
Thus, returning to the boundless, deep and unrecognizable.
Though unrecognizable,
It shines forth daily—
Thus, its path is honored and bright.
Though one knows it is honored and bright,
Yet guarding it with the muddled and humiliated—
Thus, one can become the valley of the world.

The *valley* is substantial in being yet empty in use.
Only by being substantial in being and empty in use
Is virtue fully sufficient.
When virtue is fully sufficient,
One can return to the nameless uncarved—
Also, one will have no desires.

Ah! The Great Dao is abandoned, and *ren* and *yi* arise;
The Great Uncarved scatters into things.
The Sage uses these things,
Thus becoming the leader of the multitude.
Only the Great Dao, not being a thing,
Can use these formed things;
The great measure, not being cut,
Can govern the myriad things.
If one is not immersed in the Dao yet wishes to use the world’s things,
Or is constrained by things yet wishes to govern the world’s multitude,
I must see it as perilous.

The *Records* say:
Profit and righteousness,
Wisdom and benevolence—
These are the tools of the hegemons and kings.
To use them—
How can one avoid this path?

**Scripture:**
If one seeks to take the world and act upon it,
I see it as inevitable failure.
The world is a divine vessel—
It cannot be acted upon.
To act upon it is to ruin it;
To grasp it is to lose it.

Thus, things sometimes advance, sometimes follow,
Sometimes exhale, sometimes inhale,
Sometimes strong, sometimes weak,
Sometimes uplifted, sometimes collapsed.

Thus, the Sage removes excess, removes extravagance, removes excessiveness.

**Scripture:**
The world is the world of the world, not the Sage’s alone.
Therefore, Yao could not give the world to Shun by force, nor could Yu give it to Qi by force—
it was the world that gave itself to Shun and Qi.
Thus, Yao and Yu merely followed its will.

If the world does not give itself, and one seeks to seize it by force,
I have never seen one who could take it,
let alone hold it.

Why is this?
The world is like a divine vessel of great clarity—
not something one can seize by intelligence or strength.
If one seizes it by force though it does not give itself,
the endeavor will surely fail.
If one grasps it though the world does not willingly yield,
one’s own person will surely perish.

For when things advance before,
there will be those who follow after;
when warmth is given,
there will be cold to follow;
when strength is used to dominate,
there will be force to counter it;
when one plants and nurtures,
there will be those who uproot and destroy.

Thus, if one seizes by force,
others will seize it back by force.
Therefore, the Sage knows the world cannot be taken by intelligence or strength,
and so takes it by doing nothing.
When the Dao is complete and virtue established,
the world gives itself willingly,
and thus the world gladly follows without tiring.

The Sage governs by non-action,
and so removes excess by not seizing by force,
removes extravagance by not grasping possession,
removes excessiveness by not refusing to yield.

The *Classic of Changes* says:
*"The overbearing dragon regrets it."*
The meaning of *overbearing*—
knowing how to advance but not how to retreat,
knowing how to preserve but not how to perish,
knowing how to gain but not how to lose—
only the Sage knows how to advance and retreat,
preserve and perish,
without losing the proper way.
Only the Sage understands this—
this is its meaning.

**Scripture:**
Those who assist the sovereign with the Dao
do not use force to compel the world,
for their deeds return to them.
Where the army encamps,
thorns and brambles grow.
After great armies pass,
there will surely be years of famine.

Thus, the virtuous act decisively but do not seize by force.
Act decisively but do not boast,
act decisively but do not vaunt,
act decisively but do not be arrogant—
though decisive, they do not act by force.
When things are strong, they grow old—
this is called *not the Dao*,
and *not the Dao* brings early ruin.

**Scripture:**
Those who assist the sovereign with the Dao
must win hearts with virtue,
not use arms to compel the world.
For if one seizes strength from others,
others will hate it.
If the world’s people hate it,
the world’s armies will rise against it.
Thus, if I seize strength from others,
others will seize victory from me.
What is done to oneself returns to oneself—
thus, their deeds return to them.

Where armies dwell,
farming is neglected,
and thorns grow in the fields.
Looms stand idle in the villages,
and the people are burdened with slaughter,
disturbing the harmonious *qi*—
then drought and flood will surely follow,
and years of famine will ensue.

Human affairs are as they are,
and Heaven’s will is as it is—
then can war be avoided?
It is said:
Heaven produces the five elements;
to neglect one is impossible—
who can abolish war?

War cannot be abolished,
but its use must follow the Dao.
Thus, the ancients who skillfully used war
acted decisively but did not seize by force.

What is meant by *decisive*?
Do not boast in one’s abilities,
do not vaunt one’s achievements,
do not be arrogant in one’s heart.
Though decisive in these three things,
one must still act only when unavoidable,
and though decisive in achieving victory,
one must still not dare to seize by force—
this is *decisive yet not forceful*.

To boast in one’s abilities is to love war;
to love war is to be unable to settle the people.
To vaunt one’s achievements is to invite contention;
to invite contention is to be unable to harmonize the masses.
To be arrogant is to provoke strife;
to provoke strife is to be unable to enrich the realm.

If these three *decisive* virtues are lost,
the seven virtues are all abandoned,
and the love of victory knows no end—
relying on strength to seize by force,
this is the path to ruin.

Ah! When things are strong, they grow old;
when armies are strong, they meet defeat—
this is the natural order,
and one must take heed.

Moreover, the Dao uses weakness for effectiveness,
while war uses strength to win—
this clearly does not align with the Dao.
If one does not retreat in time, regret will come;
if one does not abandon the Dao early, great defeat will follow.

The *Classic of Changes* says:
*"Lost and returning—disaster.
There will be calamity and misfortune.
Using armies—surely there will be great defeat.
The sovereign’s misfortune will last ten years without victory—
this is what is meant by not abandoning early."*

**Scripture:**
Fine weapons are ominous instruments—
things often hate them,
and so those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon them.

The gentleman, at home, values the left;
in war, values the right.
War is an ominous instrument,
not the instrument of the gentleman—
it is used only when unavoidable,
and calmness is supreme.

To win yet not rejoice in victory,
but to rejoice is to delight in killing.
Those who delight in killing
cannot achieve their desires in the world.

Auspicious matters favor the left,
ominous matters favor the right.
The left general is placed on the left,
the right general on the right—
this is to treat war as a funeral rite.
When many are killed,
one should weep in sorrow,
and victory should be treated as a funeral rite.

**Scripture:**
Those who excel in military strategy
are not auspicious or virtuous materials.
Even ordinary things may hate their intent—
how could those who follow the Dao comfortably engage in such matters?

For the Dao of Heaven and Earth:
the left is yang, the right is yin.
Yang governs virtue and life,
yin governs punishment and death.
Thus, in peace, the gentleman places the virtuous on the left—
this is why the left is honored.
In war, the brave are placed on the right—
this is why the right is honored.

The gentleman values life as virtue,
while warriors value killing as achievement—
thus, those who know war are wielding ominous instruments,
not the instruments of the gentleman.

「If one encounters the barbarous and the alien, the cunning and the treacherous, the marauders and the deceitful—
then one must reluctantly employ them,
yet never be the first to initiate conflict.
Thus it is said:
*"One does not dare to be the aggressor but the defender,
nor to advance an inch while retreating a foot."*

To remain tranquil in the face of gain,
and indifferent to the desire for victory—
this is the highest virtue.
To dare boldly to advance through valor,
and to delight in slaughter—
this is not the noble pursuit.

The true art lies in bending others without battle,
not in glorifying conquest through war—
why so?

For all wars are won by the multitude of slain—
those who praise such victory are those who take pleasure in killing.
Those who take pleasure in killing,
others will also take pleasure in killing them—
not only will others kill them,
but Heaven itself will punish them.
Why so?

Life is the greatest virtue of Heaven and Earth—
those who take pleasure in killing defy Heaven’s virtue.
If such men were to prevail in the world,
then nearly all people would perish.

Heaven will not aid them,
and what of men?

Moreover, in auspicious rites, one bows and honors the left,
while in inauspicious rites, one bows and honors the right.
The subordinate general, an aide to the military,
thus resides on the left.
The supreme general, the master of the military,
thus resides on the right.
This is why he resides on the right—
he holds the higher position of command.
Those who occupy the higher position are honored on the right,
and thus victory is treated as a funeral rite.

The conqueror in battle is he who slays many—
yet he should weep in sorrow for the slain,
for victory is treated as a funeral rite.
The earlier words spoke of an inauspicious instrument,
and now it is said that victory is treated as a funeral rite—
both are repeated laments,
for the cruelty of killing is deeply abhorred.

**Scripture:**
The Dao is always nameless,
yet the Uncarved (朴) is small—
though small, the world dare not enslave it.
If lords and kings could guard it,
all things would come willingly.

When Heaven and Earth combine,
sweet dew descends—
no one commands it,
yet it is evenly distributed.

**Explication:**
The Dao endures because of its nameless essence.
This nameless essence is also called the nameless Uncarved (朴),
whose form is exceedingly subtle and minute,
yet whose Dao is supremely noble and vast—
thus it becomes the origin of Heaven and Earth,
and the world dare not enslave it.
If lords and kings could guard this nameless Uncarved (朴),
then all things would submit in service.

Thus, when mountains are high, the wild rams come,
and when waters are deep, the dragon spirits arrive.
If mountains were not high,
or waters not deep,
even divine creatures would not come—
how much more so for ordinary things?

When the central harmonious *qi* of Heaven and Earth combines,
then nourishing dew descends upon all things,
and all things are evenly blessed by its grace—
none can command it to be so.

If lords and kings could emulate the central harmony of Heaven and Earth,
and uphold the Dao of the Uncarved and its application,
then their virtue would spread universally throughout the world,
and the world would not know how it came to be—
this is what is meant by:
*"If lords and kings could guard it,
all things would come willingly."*

**Scripture:**
When naming first began,
once names were established,
one would also know when to stop—
to know when to stop is to avoid peril.

The Dao in the world is like rivers and valleys to the great seas.

**Explication:**
By "beginning," it refers to the nameless.
Only the nameless essence can govern the use of names—
once names are established,
they will wander without restraint.
Thus one must also know when to stop,
to halt at the proper place—
names halt at their proper place,
affairs halt at their proper principles.
To know when to stop and do so,
is to avoid danger and peril.

Then, what is meant by "names halt at their proper place"?
It means to fulfill the names—
thus one follows names to supervise their fulfillment,
and examines fulfillment to rectify the names.
When names and fulfillment correspond,
the state is well-ordered;
when they do not correspond,
the state is chaotic.
Names arise from fulfillment,
fulfillment arises from names—
names and fulfillment give rise to each other,
yet they also oppose each other—
thus the sagely ruler uses the *契* (契) to hold names accountable.

Names are the world’s net,
the sage’s talisman.
To cast the world’s net,
and wield the sage’s talisman,
then the emotions of all things have no place to escape.

Thus, to scrutinize names and restore their fulfillment,
and to examine fulfillment and correct the names,
then right and wrong become as clear as white and black.
Thus, to separate them is to make them two,
to unite them is to make them one—
right and wrong follow names and fulfillment,
rewards and punishments follow right and wrong.
Thus, to perceive their forms,
to achieve their shapes,
to follow their principles,
to correct their names—
this is why it is said:
*"Names are self-appointed,
then affairs are self-determined."*

One follows names to appoint them,
and examines affairs to rectify them.
Thus, when Yao governed the world,
he used names—
his names were correct,
and the world was well-ordered.
When Jie governed the world,
he also used names—
his names were perverse,
and the world was chaotic.
Thus, names are what the sage holds most dear.

Master Zhongni said:
*"It must be so—
one must correct the names!"*
If names are not corrected,
then the ruler will be burdened with cares and labors;
if the ruler is burdened with cares and labors,
then the offices and duties will be disorderly.
The more one seeks the black,
the more one finds the white—
yet the more one seeks it,
the more one fails to obtain it.
If names are corrected,
then the ruler will have no cares or labors;
without cares or labors,
he will not tax the ears and eyes of his people—
and all undertakings will be steadfast.
He will follow forms to assign roles,
not be constrained by things,
and govern without action—
clearly and impartially,
his spirit will permeate the six directions,
his intent will survey the boundless—
this is what is meant by:
*"To know when to stop is to avoid peril."*

The great seas are where rivers and valleys converge,
and the nameless is where all names cease.
Thus, all undertakings of the world
return to the Dao in this manner.

**Scripture:**
He who knows others is wise,
he who knows himself is enlightened.
He who conquers others has strength,
he who conquers himself is powerful.
He who knows contentment is rich,
he who perseveres in action has resolve.
He who does not lose his place endures,
he who dies yet does not perish attains longevity.

**Explication:**
Knowledge that comes from without is called wisdom—
like the external radiance of the sun and fire.
Knowledge that reflects inward is called enlightenment—
like the internal reflection of metal and water.

To use gentleness to overcome others’ violence
is the strength of one who follows the Dao;
to uphold softness and conquer one’s own agitation
is the power of one who possesses virtue.

He who knows contentment in worldly gains and desires
does not lose his great undertaking—
thus he is called rich.
He who perseveres in benevolence and righteousness
can attain great virtue—
thus he is called one of resolve.

He who does not lose his place endures,
he who dies yet does not perish attains longevity.»

---

**Explication:**
The Dao moves without losing its place—
thus the body may endure long.
Death comes, yet the Way does not perish—
thus it is called longevity.

**Explication:**
The Great Dao flows unrestrained,
yet it may be found on either side.
All things depend upon it for life,
yet it does not decline to bestow.
It fulfills its function yet does not dwell upon it,
nurturing all things yet claiming no mastery.

Ever without desire, it may be called *small*—
yet when all things return to it without making it their lord,
it may be called *great*.

Therefore, the Sage never claims to be great,
and thus he achieves his greatness.

**Explication:**
The application of the Great Dao,
is it not like the virtue of ghosts and spirits?
It flows freely, found on left or right.
It drifts boundlessly, as if above or before and behind.

As the mother of all things, it is relied upon for life.
In harmony with Heaven and Earth in virtue, its work is easily accomplished.
Because its intimacy is supreme, it never denies its virtue.
Because its magnitude is absolute, it never claims its deeds.

It cherishes all creatures, fostering them without slaughter,
thus ever without desire, observing its marvel—
then its simplicity may be named *small*.
All things return to it without making it their sovereign lord,
like streams and valleys yielding to rivers and seas—
then its Dao may be named *great*.

When streams and valleys flow into the rivers and seas,
they receive without satiety—
this is because they never exalt themselves.
When all under Heaven return to the Sage,
he accepts them without weariness—
this is because he never claims to be great.

The Sage upholds the humble simplicity of the *small* (undifferentiated),
yet never considers himself great—
thus he becomes the guest of all things,
and ultimately achieves his greatness.

**Explication:**
Hold the Great Image, and all under Heaven will follow.
Follow yet cause no harm—
then peace and tranquility prevail.

Joy and bait,
yet travelers pass on without lingering.
The Way, when spoken of, is bland without flavor.
To gaze upon it is insufficient to see,
to listen to it is insufficient to hear—
yet its use is never exhausted.

**Explication:**
The Great Image is the Way.
He who can grasp the ancient Way to govern the present,
all things under Heaven will return and follow.

The Sage views the people as tender children,
fearing to harm them—
how much more would he avoid harming them in times of crisis?
If he never harms them, then those who return and follow
will suffer no injury from him.

If none suffer injury, then all under Heaven will dwell in ease and tranquility.
Joy can delight the ear,
bait can satisfy the palate—
then wayfarers will linger, travelers will revel,
though they may feel pleasure in the moment,
yet it is not their true resting place,
and they cannot remain long.

Thus the *Classic of Changes* says:
*"The bird burns its nest,
the wayfarer laughs first, then weeps bitterly."*

He who upholds the Great Image is not thus.
He does not display desire for pleasure to the people,
so when his words leave his mouth, they are bland without flavor;
when his teachings enter the heart, they are serene without adornment.
Though faint and subtle, they are not sufficient for sight or hearing,
yet their use is inexhaustible,
their measure never depleted—
spanning myriad ages without end.

**Explication:**
He who would gather must first disperse;
he who would weaken must first strengthen;
he who would discard must first promote;
he who would take away must first give.
This is called *subtle enlightenment*.

Softness overcomes hardness—
fish cannot escape the depths,
the sharpest tools of state
should not be displayed to the people.

**Explication:**
The Sage’s profound depths are most wondrous in *power and expedience* (权实).
*Expedience* (权) takes *harmony with nature* (顺常) as its essence,
*power* (实) employs *contrary measures* (反经) as its function.
*Expedience* aids *power*,
*power* implements *expedience*—
though they differ in name,
their purpose converges in unity.

The Master Lao first guided with *power*,
establishing the teaching of *constant knowledge*;
then he employed *expedience* to aid the people,
illustrating the principle of *contrary action*.

This is what the *Classic of Changes* speaks of:
*"The bending completes all things without loss,
the encompassing contains Heaven and Earth without excess."*

To remove the strong and violent,
to overturn the obscurantist and cruel—
one must rely upon their hearts of gain and desire,
and employ the arts of *gathering and dispersing*.

The use of these arts is thus:
When their hearts of gain and desire are at their peak,
one must indulge them to the fullest, letting them expand.
They delight in indulgence, and their true nature is revealed—
then one may gather them to bring them to order.

As in the *Classic of Changes*’ **"#2" (明夷)**—
the fourth hexagram:
*"Entering the left flank, capturing the heart of the obscurantist,
not stepping outside the gate."*

When indulgence is indulged to its utmost,
the heart of excess grows ever greater—
thus it is gathered by all.

This art is subtle yet clear,
the Sage’s hidden means of action.

As for weakening their resolve and *qi*,
one must first strengthen their cravings and desires.
Great love brings great expenditure,
desire pushed to its limit weakens the resolve.

Small use is upon the body and heart,
great use is upon all under Heaven.
Discarding and promoting, taking and giving,
mutually reinforce each other—
this is the natural principle,
where *contrary* becomes *harmonious*.

**Explication:**
The Way’s motion is *contrary*;
the Way’s function is *weakening*.
To govern with softness and weakness,
overcoming hardness and strength—
this is the *contrary* in use,
and the *contrary* in use truly governs *expedience*.

The *Classic of Changes* says:
*"The *submissive* (巽) moves to apply *expedience*."*
And again:
*"The *submissive* is steady when it conforms."*

The *submissive* (巽) as an image is the wind.
Wind responds to the four seasons,
bending all things—
yet no one sees its form.

*Expedience* rides the natural course of Heaven,
adapts to the changes of the world—
yet no one knows its use.

The meaning of *submissive* (巽) is *yielding*.
Yielding and submission can apply *expedience*,
and when *expedience* is applied,
it can govern the world—
thus softness and weakness can overcome hardness and strength,
and the meaning is most evident while the function is most hidden.

How can this be made clear?
In ancient times, King Wen ruled one-third of all under Heaven,
yet he still bowed and submitted to the tyrant Zhou (纣).
He offered the lands of *Lacquer* (漆) and *Stagnant* (沮),
and requested the abolition of the *Branding* (炮烙) punishment.

When Zhou’s greedy heart burned fiercely,
King Wen offered the lands—
this was indulging them to let them expand.
Zhou, once he gained the lands, rejoiced—
thus King Wen requested the removal of his punishment,
this was gathering them to bring them to order—
this was King Wen’s *expedience*.

In ancient times, King Wu surveyed his troops at the *Ming River Crossing* (盟津),
saying, *"The evil of Zhou has not yet reached its peak."*
Thus he returned his army for two years,
before raising the *Mao Field* (牧野) campaign.

「Thus, King Wu’s return to the Ming River Crossing was to fully indulge the tyrant’s arrogance, while his campaign at the Mao Field was to gather the people’s resentment to its extreme—this was King Wu’s *expedience*.

In ancient times, King Wen, through the Dao of gentle softness, though aware that the Yin people could not endure Zhou’s cruelty, still wished to completely remove Zhou before accepting them—this was King Wen’s *substance*.

King Wu, through the virtue/power of resolute strength, swiftly recognized that the Yin people could not bear Zhou’s tyranny, and thus hastened to slay Zhou before claiming their lands—this was King Wu’s *substance*.

The brothers Bo Yi (伯夷) and Shu Qi (叔齐) upheld King Wen’s *substance* and corrected King Wu’s *expedience*, declaring that a subject should not overthrow a sovereign as a precedent. They sought to establish the Three Bonds (三纲) for future generations, thus they collectively abandoned King Wu and starved to death at Shouyang (首阳).

The Duke of Zhou (太公) aided King Wu’s *expedience* and inverted King Wen’s *substance*, asserting that slaying the tyrannical Zhou would bring peace to the realm. He aimed to rescue the myriad people in the present age, thus he soared like an eagle and followed King Wu, unleashing devastation upon the Great Shang (大商).

The Duke of Zhou (周公) and the Duke of Shao (召公) completed the deeds of Wen and Wu, intending to secretly preserve the *expedience* of rectifying chaos while openly promoting the *substance* of governance and peace. Thus, they rested the oxen and released the horses, overturned the chariots and laid down the weapons, inquired about the *Great Response* (洪范) from Ji Zi (箕子), relocated the stubborn people to Luoyi (洛邑), established rituals and composed music, laid down arms and cultivated culture, spreading the influence of the Two Southern Schools (二南) and securing the eight-hundred-year prosperity of the Zhou (八百之祚). This was another instance of using *expedience* to invert *substance* on the grandest scale.

The *Classic of Changes* (《易》) states:
*"The opening and closing of one gate is called change (变),*
*and the ceaseless movement between extremes is called harmony (通)."*

These are subtle teachings,
whereby *expedience* and *substance* complement each other.

Ah! The Sage’s use of *expedience* aligns with the Dao,
while the petty man’s misuse of *expedience* serves his deceit.
A fish that escapes the deep pool cannot swim,
*Expedience* that departs from *substance* cannot be applied.

For *expedience* is a sharp instrument of statecraft—
it must be deeply concealed,
secretly employed,
and never openly displayed,
lest men seize it to incite disorder.

Thus Confucius said:
*"One may be capable of following the Dao,*
*but not yet of establishing it.*
*One may be capable of establishing it,*
*but not yet of wielding *expedience*.*"

In the *Hexagram of Qian* (□乾) at line four:
*"One leaps into the deep pool—*
*no blame."*

The Master said:
*"There is no fixed hierarchy of high and low,*
*this is not perverse (邪).*
*There is no constant forward or retreat,*
*this is not abandonment of the group (离群).*
*The Noble One advances in virtue/power and cultivates his undertakings,*
*seeking to fulfill his potential in due time—*
*thus there is no blame."*

In the *Hexagram of Kun* (《坤》) at line four:
*"Gather the sack—*
*no blame, no praise."*

The Master said:
*"When Heaven and Earth undergo transformation,*
*grasses and trees flourish.*
*When Heaven and Earth close in stillness,*
*virtuous men withdraw.*
*To gather the sack is without blame,*
*for it signifies restraint (谨),*
*and caution (慎) does no harm.*

Thus, the use of *expedience* is something the Sage finds difficult and cautious—
how can it not be guarded with care?
How can it not be guarded with care?

The *Classic* says:
*"The Dao endures without action,*
*yet nothing remains undone.*
*If lords and kings can uphold*
*this art of the Origin and the Mother,*
*all things shall naturally transform.*
*When transformation is complete,*
*I shall govern with the nameless simplicity (无名之朴).*
*The nameless simplicity,*
*too, shall not desire action.*
*Without desire, it remains tranquil—*
*thus the realm shall naturally rectify itself."*

The *Transmission* says:
*"The Dao endures as constant*
*because its essence is nameless,*
*thus it acts without action,*
*and its function is named,*
*thus it accomplishes all things without omission.*
*If lords and kings can uphold*
*this art of the Origin and the Mother,*
*then the principles of all things shall be attained,*
*and the affairs of the realm shall be set right—*
*this is what is meant by*
*'I act without action, yet the people transform themselves.'*

Once virtue/power and transformation become pure,
the realm attains clarity and tranquility.
If the emotions of profit and desire begin to sprout,
I shall firmly establish and rectify this great Dao
with its fundamental simplicity,
so that nothing may stir them.

The *Highest Virtue* (上德) acts without action,
yet nothing is left undone—
thus it aligns with the Dao.
The *Lower Virtue* (下德) acts with action,
yet something is left undone—
thus it aligns with virtue/power.

Those who attain virtue/power
must inevitably lose the Dao,
thus one who has the heart of non-action
shall naturally display the traces of non-action.
Future generations shall seek its traces
while forgetting its root—
thus they arrive at non-action
yet fall into action.
Hence it is said:
*'The nameless simplicity,*
*too, shall not desire action'*
—meaning to make both heart and trace forgotten,
thus reaching the *Mysterious of Mysteries* (玄之又玄).

If one can forget both heart and trace,
and harmonize with the mysterious principles,
then all under Heaven shall naturally fulfill their true nature,
and bear no burden from the traces of things.

The first chapter takes the constant Dao as its essence,
constant names as its function,
and culminates in the *Triply Mysterious* (重玄).
This chapter takes non-action as its essence,
and the fulfillment of all things as its function,
unifying them in the principle of *comprehensive forgetting* (兼忘).
The beginning and end are interconnected,
thus exhausting its essence and function.

*The True Dao/Virtue Classic, Volume III*

**The Classic:**
The highest virtue does not claim virtue—thus it truly has virtue.
The lowest virtue does not abandon virtue—thus it lacks virtue.
The highest virtue acts without striving, yet nothing is left undone—thus it has no striving.
The lowest virtue strives, yet nothing is accomplished—thus it has striving.

The highest benevolence acts without striving—thus it is truly benevolent.
The highest righteousness acts with striving—thus it is truly righteous.
The highest propriety acts with striving, yet none respond—so it forces arms and persists.
Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue follows;
when virtue is lost, benevolence follows;
when benevolence is lost, righteousness follows;
when righteousness is lost, propriety follows.

For propriety, though thin as loyalty and trust,
is the first root of chaos.
Discernment#1, though the bloom of the Dao,
is the beginning of folly.
Hence, the true man dwells in its substance, not its bloom;
inhabits its depth, not its thinness—
thus he discards that and takes this.

**The Transmission:**
The highest virtue aligns with the Dao,
not claiming virtue, thus having constant virtue.
The lowest virtue loses the Dao yet clings to virtue—
claiming virtue, thus lacking constant virtue.
The highest virtue’s function follows Nature—
thus, without striving, it is without striving.
The lowest virtue’s function follows non-action—
thus, with striving, it strives.

Benevolence is universal love—
all actions are striving, yet he who does not claim benevolence as his deed is the highest.
Righteousness is the prohibition of wrong—
all actions are striving, yet he who does not claim righteousness as his gain is the highest.
Why so? If benevolence is claimed as a deed, then one is hindered by the act of benevolence itself.
If righteousness is not claimed as a gain, then one will yield to what is unrighteous.

For the highest propriety,
it serves to distinguish rank and settle the people’s resolve.
But when it comes to displaying jade and silk,
valuing etiquette and reciprocity—
these are the trivial extremities of propriety.
Now, if one reveres propriety toward others,
yet others do not respond,
he is indeed one who has slighted propriety.
But if I, in turn, change countenance and strain to draw him forth,
then my offense is far greater than his.
For propriety exists to prevent strife—
when lost to its trivialities, it instead provokes strife.
This is the common fate of the world,
those who do not grasp propriety’s great foundation.

The Master Lao held forth these extreme violations of propriety,
mocking their cause of strife,
to urge men to return to propriety’s root
and rejoin the *Great Unity* (太一).

*The Record* says:
Love others without intimacy—then you have inverted benevolence.
Revere propriety yet receive no response—then you have inverted respect.
Thus, conquer yourself and restore propriety without reproaching others.

*The Book of Changes* says:
Use humility to regulate propriety.
And again:
Humility is the handle of virtue.
If one can grasp humility’s handle,
the root of propriety restored,
then all will proceed without obstruction—
how could there be any loss from forcing or persisting?

Moreover, the highest virtue aligns with non-action by Nature—
when lost from the highest virtue,
it follows non-action—
thus it is said, *"When the Dao is lost, virtue follows."*

If one follows non-action,
virtue’s works are established;
if one acts with striving,
benevolence’s deeds appear;
if one restrains and benefits,
the highest righteousness is clear;
if one regulates and prevents,
the highest propriety is set.
Thus it is said,
*"When virtue is lost, benevolence follows;
when benevolence is lost, righteousness follows;
when righteousness is lost, propriety follows."*

For what is lost in one is gained in another—
this is the universal principle.
Thus, the essence of loyalty and trust decays within,
while the seeds of chaos take root—
so propriety is established to prevent its outbreak,
and propriety stands at the head of chaos.

The Dao’s bloom manifests externally,
while folly and confusion arise—
so discernment is exalted to guide the foolish.
Thus, discernment is the origin of folly.

Discernment is foresight’s clarity,
illuminating principles yet to take form.
Yet benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and discernment
are all the Sage’s timely applications,
to rise or fall with the times,
to flourish or decline with the age.
Thus, clinging to the ancient while governing the present,
the Dao and virtue are its foundation,
while propriety and discernment are its extremities.
Transforming the present to restore the ancient,
propriety’s regulation is its beginning,
while the Dao and virtue are its end—
this is what is meant by *"reduce it, reduce it, until it reaches non-action."*

To raise swine for wine is not to make wine a calamity,
yet wine’s spread brings calamity.
Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and discernment
are not to make chaos,
yet their misuse brings chaos as a consequence.
The perplexed do not know that desire for gain is the source of chaos,
and so blame the Sage’s wisdom,
saying that to sever and abandon them
would restore the governance of ancient times—
how far astray are they, how far astray!

Thus it is said:
To discuss propriety in the age of purity—
either madness or perversity.
To forget propriety in the age of corruption—
either stupidity or slander.

In seeking the source and returning to the origin,
discarding trivialities and reclaiming the root,
restoring righteousness and propriety to return to benevolence and virtue,
employing named forms while dwelling in the formless—
then the Dao of Nature will not be distant before it is restored.

This is what is meant by the true man—
he will sever this without doubt,
dwelling securely in the foundation of the Dao and virtue,
not hindered by the extremities of propriety and discernment.
Why is this so? Laws established in governance still breed chaos;
laws established in chaos—what would their consequences be?
Thus, discard that which is trivial and superficial,
take this which is profound and substantial—
this is the deep intention of clinging to the ancient while governing the present.

Ah! Even propriety has its place—
offering sacrifices to Heaven with a single libation, valuing sincerity.
Using earthenware and gourds for vessels, valuing simplicity.
Revealing wine’s practical use while esteeming its mysterious worth,
settling coarse baskets with care while arranging reeds for adornment—
all these value the root.
How can they be neglected?

**The Classic:**
In ancient times, those who attained *Oneness* (一),
Heaven attained it and became clear,
Earth attained it and became tranquil,
The *Spirit* (神) attained it and became responsive,
The *Grains* (谷) attained it and became full,
All things attained it and flourished,
Rulers attained it and became steadfast for the world.

Their attainment was through Oneness—
Heaven without clarity would fear collapse,
Earth without tranquility would fear eruption,
The Spirit without responsiveness would fear extinction,
The Grains without fullness would fear depletion,
All things without flourishing would fear annihilation,
Rulers without steadfastness would fear ruin—
and so the noble would fear elevation.

Thus, nobility must have humility as its root,
elevation must have lowliness as its foundation—
so it takes this and discards that.

Thus, the noble rulers call themselves *Lone* (孤), *Few* (寡), and *Not Grains* (不谷)—this is their way of taking lowliness as root.
Is it not so?
Hence, they do not seek the splendor of *glittering jade* (琭琭), nor the rigidity of *flint-like stone* (珞珞).

The *Classical* says:
The *One* (一) is the child of the *Dao/Way* (道), the origin of all things.
If one can embrace its child and restore its origin, then all things will naturally fulfill their *principle of life* (生之理).
Even the *Dao/Way* of Heaven and its *Divine Brilliance* (神明), the *Dao/Way* of Earth and its *Mountainous Depths* (山谷),
all achieve clarity and responsiveness, tranquility and fullness, because of their attainment of the *One*.

The *Book of Changes* (《易》) says: *"All movement under Heaven is rooted in the steadfastness of the One."*
Thus, when rulers attain it, they become steadfast for the world—
the means by which they attain it is through the *One Dao/Way*.
Yet, though they attain it,
they must not rely upon it—
therefore, they guard against making it their sole foundation.
If they rely upon clarity and responsiveness, tranquility and fullness,
then they will surely fear collapse and eruption, extinction and depletion.
Alas! All things rely upon their *principle of life*—
if they rely upon it, the *Heavenly Principle* (天理) will surely perish.
Rulers rely upon steadfastness—
if they rely upon it, their *nobility and elevation* (貴高) will surely falter.
The words *"nobility and elevation"* are added to warn of the profound intent for rulers.

They have both warned and expounded upon it, saying:
*"The reason rulers attain nobility and kingship is because they take the lowly as their root,
the reason they occupy high positions is because they take the common people as their foundation.
As for calling themselves Lone, Few, and Not Grains—
these are terms of lowliness,
yet rulers who use them to describe themselves
are truly taking lowliness as their root."*

To exhaust its meaning, how shall we explain it?
The *scholar* (士), *farmer* (农), *artisan* (工), and *merchant* (商) all exist within the people—
only then does the state exist.
The *wheels* (輪), *axles* (辕), *chests* (箱), and *shafts* (轴) are prepared for use—
only then does the carriage exist.
Now, if one points to the carriage and counts its parts,
they are but wheels, axles, chests, and shafts—
one does not see the carriage itself.
If one points to the state and counts its elements,
they are but scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants—
one does not see the state itself.
Thus, the scholar, farmer, artisan, and merchant
are the lowly and base of the state—
the state’s existence depends upon the lowly and base as its root.
Hence, rulers should warn themselves against nobility,
not desiring the brilliance of jade-like splendor,
but should take the lowly and base as their root—
thus, they should be like flint-like stone in their common humility.

The *Classical* says:
*"The contrary is the movement of the Dao/Way,
the weak is its application.*
All things under Heaven arise from *Being* (有),
*Being* arises from *Non-Being* (无)."
The *Commentary* says:
*"The *power* (权) is that which, through contrariness, moves and aligns with the proper.
The *substance* (实) is that which, through weakness, applies and is governed by the strong.*
All things under Heaven arise from *having form* (有形),
*having form* must arise from *having no form* (无形).
All affairs under Heaven arise from *having signs* (有兆),
*having signs* must arise from *having no signs* (无兆).
Thus, knowing that contrariness is movement,
it must arise from weakness as application—
then the subtle beginning of motion
must arise from the principle of stillness and obscurity.
Yet, the subtle beginning of motion arises from principle,
and in the end, it returns to principle.
Power arises from substance,
and in the end, it returns to substance—
these are all the *universal transformations* (通变) of the Dao/Way,
the *reversals and recoveries* (覆却) that mutually aid each other.

The *Classical* says:
*"The superior person hears the Dao/Way and diligently practices it;
the middle person hears the Dao/Way and clings to it uncertainly;
the inferior person hears the Dao/Way and laughs at it—
if they do not laugh, it is not the Dao/Way."*

The *Commentary* builds upon this:
*"The Dao/Way, though clear, is as if obscured;
advancing the Dao/Way is as if retreating;
leveling the Dao/Way is as if crooked;
superior virtue is as if lacking;
great brightness is as if stained;
expansive virtue is as if insufficient;
established virtue is as if stolen;
pure truth is as if muddy;
the greatest square has no corners;
the greatest vessel takes long to form;
the greatest sound is faint;
the greatest form is shapeless;
the Dao/Way is hidden and nameless."*

The Dao/Way alone is good at lending and completing.
The *Commentary* says:
The *Book of Changes* (《易》) states:
*"That which is above form is called the Dao/Way.
The Dao/Way is that which transcends form.
That which is below form is called the vessel.
The vessel is that which is confined within form.*
The superior person knows the subtle and the manifest,
transcends form, and thus hears the Dao/Way and believes it—
they diligently practice it.
The middle person is caught between the subtle and the manifest,
dwelling in the space between the Dao/Way and the vessel—
thus, when they hear the Dao/Way, they doubt and half-believe—
hence, they cling to it uncertainly.
The inferior person knows only the manifest and not the subtle,
is confined within form—
thus, when they hear the Dao/Way, they laugh at it.
Not only do they laugh,
but they would also deny it.
The Dao/Way is subtle, mysterious, and profoundly penetrating,
deep beyond recognition—
if it were not laughed at and denied by the inferior,
then it would not be the true and refined Dao/Way.
Yet, why is it laughed at and denied by the inferior?
It is because the *Commentary* says:

*"The one who embodies the Dao/Way,
aligns with the Heavenly Principle of the sun and moon in their steadfast clarity,
yet their light does not dazzle—
this is the Dao/Way, though clear, as if obscured.
They align with the Heavenly Principle of Heaven and Earth in their ease and simplicity,
yet their application cannot be made into laws and decrees—
this is the Dao/Way, though level, as if crooked.
They align with the Heavenly Principle of the four seasons in their movement,
yet their action must return to the mysterious and profound—
this is advancing the Dao/Way as if retreating.
They constantly dwell in lowliness,
yet are never corrupted—
this is superior virtue as if lacking.
They constantly reside in filth and impurity,
yet are never stained—
this is great brightness as if stained.
They clothe and shelter all under Heaven,
yet do not claim credit for their kindness—
this is expansive virtue as if insufficient.
They nurture and sustain all things,
yet do not display their efforts—
this is established virtue as if stolen.
They restore their nature to govern their emotions—
this is pure truth as if muddy.
They are correct within and act properly without—
this is the greatest square having no corners.
With the skill of a clumsy artisan,
they mold and refine all under Heaven yet do not seek immediate results—
this is the greatest vessel taking long to form.
With teaching that is not spoken,
they stir and move all things yet do not indulge in trifling words—
this is the greatest sound being faint.
In affairs where there is no affair,
one does not see their use—
this is the greatest form being shapeless.
In doing that which is *Non-Doing* (无为),
one does not recognize their body—
this is the Dao/Way being hidden and nameless.

The Dao/Way alone is good at lending and completing to all things,
yet does not demand repayment—
thus, all things receive its nurturing and completion yet do not know its virtue,
and so the inferior person hears this Dao/Way and laughs at it,
not believing it could be so."*

**Scripture:**
The Dao/Way gives birth to One,
One gives birth to Two,
Two gives birth to Three,
Three gives birth to all things.
All things bear yin and embrace yang,
and through the interplay of *qi* achieve harmony.

What people detest—
the titles *Orphan, Widow, and Without Grain*—
yet kings and lords claim them as their own.
Thus, some things are diminished to be enhanced,
while others are enhanced to be diminished.

What people teach as *benefit*,
I teach as *subduing*—
the violent and domineering shall not meet their end,
and I shall make them my teacher.

The most yielding in all under Heaven
overcomes the most rigid in all under Heaven.
There is no entry into the unspanned.

Thus, I know the virtue of *Non-Doing*.

The teaching of *Non-Speaking*,
the benefit of *Non-Doing*—
few under Heaven attain it.

**Commentary:**
The essence of true *qi* generates the wondrous functions of all things.
When the form of *qi* is complete, all things arise.
Yin and yang intermingle to form the harmonizing *qi*,
and this harmonizing *qi* circulates and transforms to produce all things.

Yet when all things are born,
they inevitably turn their backs to yin and face yang,
with harmonizing *qi* coursing between them—
this is how their natural order is maintained.

The Sage establishes teaching by tracing the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth,
and exhausting the principles of all things,
and thus knows that human life too is governed by harmonizing *qi*.

How may this be made clear?
Humans receive the central *qi* of Heaven and Earth at birth—
this is called *fate*.
At its beginning, there is a luminous vitality, called *hun* and *po*.
The *po* is yin,
the *hun* is yang.
When yin and yang blend in purity,
harmonizing *qi* flows between them,
and thus the form and spirit are perfected.

If harmonizing *qi* is preserved whole,
spirit and form are in accord,
and spirit and form in accord mean life.
If harmonizing *qi* is scattered,
spirit and form separate,
and spirit and form separated mean death.

The dead cannot be revived,
the scattered cannot be restored—
thus, one must nurture the vast harmonizing *qi*
to align with the Dao/Way of Nature.

Does not the *Classic of Changes* say:
*The greatest virtue of Heaven and Earth is generation.*
Generation is what the Sage holds most precious.
The Sage values life so highly
because through it the Dao/Way is realized.

The Dao/Way is what the world reveres—
though it encompasses Heaven and Earth,
and penetrates the finest hairs,
its essence lies in body and mind alone.

Thus, those who follow the Dao/Way cultivate the vital principles of body and mind,
and the key to this lies in dwelling where people detest.

Now, *Orphan, Widow, and Without Grain*—
these are what people detest,
yet kings and lords claim them as their own,
for they seek to diminish the violent and domineering
and benefit from virtue and power.

In the *Classic of Changes*, *Diminishing* is a virtue,
and none excel it more than restraining anger and suppressing desire.
To restrain anger and suppress desire
is to clarify the mind daily,
and a clarified mind can benefit from principle.

The finest enhancement is to change what is bad and amend what is wrong.
To change what is bad and amend what is wrong
is to rectify the body daily,
and a rectified body can diminish its affairs.

This is what is meant by:
*Some things are diminished to be enhanced,
others enhanced to be diminished.*

People’s teaching is to increase daily,
but I teach to diminish daily.
Thus, diminish again and again,
until one reaches *Non-Doing*.

The Dao/Way employs softness and weakness in action,
does not contend with things,
and thus nothing can contend with it—
this is the *Non-Diminishing, Non-Enhancing*.

The violent and domineering harm things violently,
and things harm them in return,
so they cannot fulfill their natural order—
this is the *Not-Enhanced, but Struck*.

I know that the violent and domineering are detested by all things,
so I take this softness and weakness as the parent of all teachings.

How may this be made clear?
Water, though supremely yielding in use,
erodes the most rigid stone.
*Qi*, though formless in essence,
penetrates the unspanned in all things.

Thus, I see water attacking the most rigid,
and *qi* entering the unspanned,
and so I know the benefit of *Non-Doing*
and the harm of *Doing*.

To practice the teaching of much speech,
to be entangled in *Doing*—
this is the harm of *Doing*.

To practice the teaching of *Non-Speaking*,
to embody the principle of *Non-Doing*—
this is the benefit of *Non-Doing*.

The teaching of much speech brings the harm of *Doing*—
all under Heaven are thus.
The teaching of *Non-Speaking* brings the benefit of *Non-Doing*—
yet few under Heaven attain it.

Ah! Those who truly know me are rare,
so I am held in trustworthy esteem.

**Scripture:**
Which is closer to me—*name* or *body*?
Which is more abundant—*body* or *wealth*?
Which brings greater harm—*gain* or *loss*?

Thus, the more one loves excessively,
the greater the expenditure.
The more one hoards,
the greater the loss.

To know sufficiency is to avoid disgrace,
to know cessation is to avoid peril—
thus one may endure long.

**Commentary:**
*Name* is the banner of one’s standing.
If it is genuine, the body is honored in its time,
and the name endures in posterity.
But if it is contrived and exaggerated,
unworthy of reality,
though the name may be heard by others,
the body will be abandoned by those of the Dao.

*Wealth* is the resource for one’s livelihood.
If used properly, the body is esteemed for generous giving,
and wealth is not hoarded for oneself.
But if acquired through greed and deceit,
and not dispersed in benevolence and kindness,
though wealth may fill the halls,
the body will be slighted by those of virtue.

To lose both the censure of usurping names and squandering wealth,
while neglecting the way of cultivating oneself and restraining desires—
which of these brings greater harm?

Thus, those who love *name* excessively
give rise to deceit,
and thus greatly damage reality.
Those who hoard wealth excessively
invite thieves,
and thus greatly lose their resources.

To know sufficiency is to not covet wealth,
to know cessation is to not covet *name*.
Not coveting wealth avoids disgrace,
not coveting *name* avoids peril.

Only thus can one’s *name* endure,
and one’s wealth be long preserved.

**经:**
The greatest fullness appears as if incomplete—
its use is inexhaustible.
The greatest abundance seems empty—
its use is boundless.
The most upright seems bent,
the most skillful seems clumsy,
the most eloquent seems tongue-tied.

Agitation overcomes cold,
stillness overcomes heat—
thus, clarity and tranquility are the Way’s foundation for all under Heaven.

**传:**
The Sage’s Dao nourishes all under Heaven,
yet fears even one thing left unplaced—
thus, all affairs are accomplished without exhaustion.
Virtue fills the four seas,
yet does not dare to swell with self-conceit—
thus, all affairs are managed without depletion.

Walking the Way of utmost ease yet never straying,
relying on self-perfected instruments without carving,
laying out the most fitting principles without embellishment—
thus, things follow their nature,
people fulfill their capacities,
and the world’s affairs settle without effort.

Examine why this is so—
it is simply the power of spontaneity.
Like agitation overcoming bitter cold,
stillness overcoming scorching heat—
not by contriving cold or heat,
yet cold and heat cannot assail it.

Thus, without action, the people transform themselves;
without preference for stillness, the people align themselves.
All movement under Heaven originates from One—
thus, clarity and tranquility can govern all under Heaven.

**经:**
When the Way prevails in the world,
warhorses are driven out to manure fields.
When the Way is lost in the world,
warhorses breed in the suburbs.

No guilt is greater than craving what is improper,
no calamity is greater than insatiability,
no fault is graver than demanding possession.
Thus, the sufficiency of sufficiency is always sufficient.

**传:**
In an age where the Way prevails,
the Son of Heaven guards against the four barbarians,
the feudal lords guard against neighboring states—
though arms and steeds exist, they serve no purpose.
The people follow their teachings,
return to farming and sericulture,
clear the wilds to plant trees,
manure the fields and sow seeds—
thus, the people cherish their land
and strengthen their kinship.

When the Way is lost,
the Son of Heaven repels the four barbarians,
the feudal lords invade neighboring states—
thus, arms stir within the borders,
warhorses gallop through the suburbs.
The people weary from labor,
abandon their livelihoods,
mulberry groves turn to firewood,
briers and thorns grow in the fields—
the people flee their homelands and betray their lords.

Alas, the tyranny of the Wayless ruler poisons all under Heaven.
Trace its origin—three evils of the heart:
Seeking what is improper yet unjust—
thus, no guilt is greater.
Seeking without restraint harms others—
thus, no calamity is greater.
Demanding possession only inflames the heart—
thus, no fault is heavier.

Yet, only the Sage can be without desire.
Desire leads to seeking,
seeking without sufficiency brings the greatest calamity.
Alas, none have ever sought much and gained much—
thus, those who seek with sufficiency
seek little and thus supply easily,
and their seeking is ever sufficient.

**经:**
Without stepping outside,
one knows all under Heaven.
Without peering through windows,
one perceives the Way of Heaven.
The farther one goes,
the less one knows.
Thus, the Sage acts without moving,
names without seeing,
accomplishes without doing.

**传:**
The Sage’s governance
extends from self and heart to all under Heaven—
thus, when eating, think of the world’s hunger;
when clothing, think of the world’s cold;
love for one’s parents extends to the world’s aged;
love for one’s children extends to the world’s young.
Thus, without leaving home,
one knows all under Heaven.

The Sage’s governance
returns to self and heart to align with Heaven’s Way—
thus, delighting in life reveals Heaven’s nurturing of all things,
completing tasks reveals Heaven’s perfecting of the four seasons,
favoring goodness reveals Heaven’s favor toward the virtuous.
Heaven displays its symbols to manifest its Way,
the Sage aligns self and heart with the Way—
why gaze through windows to perceive Heaven’s Way?

Those who cannot reflect inward,
yet clamorously take all under Heaven as their burden,
exhaust their spirit,
torment their form,
toiling ceaselessly in worldly affairs—
I see they cannot govern.

Why? The world’s affairs are myriad daily,
yet if they grasp not the essentials,
fixate on trifles,
their form and spirit grow weary.
When the spirit is overtaxed, it is depleted;
when the form is overtaxed, it is worn;
when both are overtaxed, peril follows.
Laboring in trivialities yet never attaining even a fraction—
thus, the farther they go, the less they know.

Hence the *Record* says:
To govern the world, first govern one’s state;
to govern one’s state, first govern one’s family;
to govern one’s family, first govern oneself;
to govern oneself, first govern one’s heart;
to govern one’s heart, first rectify one’s intentions.
Thus, the noble one without sincerity achieves nothing—
all must return to self and heart.

Without traversing the world yet knowing human nature,
without observing celestial omens yet naming Heaven’s Way—
without toiling in affairs yet achieving perfect governance—
this is the power of reflecting on self and heart.

Confucius said:
Only Heaven is vast—
only Yao followed it.
He also said:
To govern without action—
was it not Shun?

This is what is meant.

**经:**
For learning, daily increase;
for the Dao, daily decrease.
Decrease again, decrease again,
until reaching non-action.
Through non-action, nothing remains undone.
Taking the world with non-interference,
when interference arises,
it is insufficient to take the world.

**传:**
The scholar broadens knowledge and accumulates insight
to grasp principles—
thus, daily increase.
The Daoist holds fast to the essentials,
simplifies affairs—
thus, daily decrease.

When principles are clear, affairs settle—
thus, the scholar’s daily increase
relies on the Daoist’s daily decrease.

To calm turbulent governance,
stillness can gradually clarify—
thus, decrease is gradual,
not to be removed abruptly—
hence, decrease again, decrease again.

「。
　　**Experience:** Resting in flawed customs, movement can gradually bring forth change—
thus, decrease until reaching non-action,
and then one can achieve nothing left undone.

　　**The Way of the Sage:**
The one who acts relies on human inclinations to establish laws and regulations,
so there is interference.
Interference exhausts the people,
and exhaustion leads to rebellion.
The one who does not act follows the natural inclinations of things,
supporting their inherent spontaneity,
so there is no interference.
No interference brings ease to the people,
and ease leads them to return willingly.

　　The Sage’s mind ever considers
one thing out of place—
to address flaws and chaos,
the key lies in winning the hearts of the people.
Winning the hearts of the people
means letting them come willingly of their own accord.
Thus, through non-action, no interference,
and customs transformed into clarity and stillness,
the people take delight in being guided
without ever growing weary.

　　If there is action and interference,
government becomes burdensome and the people weary,
then the populace will recoil in fear
and thus it is insufficient to win the hearts of the people.

　　**Experience:** The Sage has no fixed heart,
but takes the hearts of the people as their own.
If they are virtuous, I nurture their virtue;
if they are not virtuous, I also nurture them with virtue—
thus, virtue is attained.
If they are trustworthy, I trust them;
if they are not trustworthy, I also trust them—
thus, trust is attained.

　　The Sage moves through the world in humble reverence,
unifying the hearts of the people,
while all the people focus their ears and eyes on the Sage,
as if the Sage were their tender child.
　　**Transmission:** The Sage embodies the Dao and does nothing,
responding only to the stirrings of things—
responding to what is stirred,
thus having no fixed heart.

　　Yet the hearts of the people
ever seek to secure their lives
and fulfill their nature.
The Sage ever ensures that each person
receives what they desire—
is this not taking the hearts of the people as their own?

　　If the people have a heart for virtue,
the Sage also responds with virtue to nurture them—
those inherently virtuous,
I assist with virtue to reinforce their goodness.
If the people have a heart for non-virtue,
I also treat them with virtue,
so that they feel my goodness
and transform, becoming virtuous—
then the world has no one who is not virtuous,
and the people all attain the virtue they desire.

　　As for the people who have a heart for trust,
I also transform them with this,
so that the people all attain the trust they desire,
and the world has no one who is untrustworthy.

　　Thus, the Sage moves through the world,
humble and responsive to the stirrings of things,
never resting,
yet their heart is unified with the world,
never acting for themselves.

　　Hence, Confucius’ four prohibitions:
Do not impose your will,
do not be rigid,
do not be obstinate,
do not be self-centered.
Thus, they can have no preferences,
no fixed course of action,
no interference,
no non-action—
so the people focus their ears and eyes on the Sage,
as a babe gazes upon its loving mother,
and the Sage fears only that they might be harmed.

　　**Experience:** Born to life, born to death.
Those born to life are thirteen in ten,
those born to death are thirteen in ten,
and those born to life,
when moved, also die thirteen in ten.
Why so?
Because the abundance of life’s vitality
leads to death’s domain.»

The cover of the *Daoist Classic of Vitality* states:

*"The adept at preserving life*
walks upon land without fearing rhinoceros or tiger,
enters battle without shunning armor and weapons.
The rhinoceros finds no place to hurl its horn,
the tiger finds no place to strike with its claws,
the weapons find no place to lodge their blades.
Why so?
Because there are no grounds for death within them.

**Scripture:** Life must inevitably meet death—
this is the natural order.
To grasp the order of life and death,
one must accept it as constant.

If one defies this order,
they stray beyond the bounds of vitality.
Straying beyond the bounds of vitality,
they must inevitably fall into death’s domain.
Yet even so, those who know life’s order
and do not defy it to preserve their own—
three in ten.
Those who know death’s order
and do not defy it to avoid death—
three in ten as well.
But if they love life and defy the order to preserve it,
they lose it instead;
if they hate death and defy the order to avoid it,
they gain it instead—
the same holds true.
How does this come about?
Because the pursuit of life’s excess
transgresses beyond its natural bounds,
and thus, when moved from constancy,
they are drawn into death’s domain.

Hence, the adept at preserving life is different:
knowing life’s order, they uphold the *Dao* and embrace *virtue*
without indulging in life’s excess;
knowing death’s order, they find joy in *Heaven’s* ways
and accept their *fate* without fearing death.
Life and death cannot sway their heart,
calamities cannot shake their resolve,
so they walk upon land and meet fierce beasts
without alarm,
enter battle and brave the sharp blades
without flinching—
though facing hardship and misfortune alike.
How do they achieve this?
If one harms with their heart,
things will harm them in return;
if one trusts with their sincerity,
things will trust them in return.
I do not harm with my heart,
so rhinoceros and tiger find no place to strike with claws or horns;
I trust with my sincerity,
so armor and weapons find no place to lodge their blades.
Thus, when life’s order does not dwell within,
death’s domain does not appear before.

*The Master Zhongni* said:
‘*Loyalty* and *trustworthiness* make even fire and water passable.’
This is indeed close to the truth.

**Scripture:** The *Dao* gives birth to them,
*virtue* nurtures them,
things shape their form,
and *power* completes their function.
Thus, all things revere the *Dao* and honor *virtue*.
The *Dao’s* reverence,
the *virtue’s* honor—
none bestow them upon it,
yet they arise naturally and everlastingly.

Therefore, the *Dao* gives birth and nurtures,
lengthens and matures,
shelters and poisons,
rears and protects.
It gives birth without possession,
acts without reliance,
lengthens without control—
this is called *Mysterious Virtue*.

**Scripture:** Things are born and then nurtured,
nurtured and then shaped,
shaped and then completed.
That which gives birth to them is the *Dao*;
that which nurtures them is *virtue*;
that which shapes their forms is *affairs*;
that which completes their function is *power*.
All things honor the *Dao* because it gives birth,
and they revere *virtue* because it nurtures.
The *Dao* and *virtue* give birth and nurture,
so they are naturally revered by all things—
how could they be honored only after titles and ranks are conferred?

Yet the *Dao* is the essence of the true subtlety,
and *virtue* is the function of the wondrous.
The essence can encompass the function,
but the function cannot encompass the essence.
The *Dao* can encompass *virtue*,
but *virtue* cannot encompass the *Dao*.
Thus, receiving its essence is called *birth*,
embracing its *qi* is called *nurture*,
fulfilling its form is called *lengthening*,
marking its substance is called *maturing*,
balancing its completion is called *sheltering*,
measuring its function is called *poisoning*,
preserving its harmony is called *rearing*,
guarding its injury is called *protecting*—
this is called the *Great Dao*.
Having given birth without clinging to possession,
having acted without boasting of reliance,
having lengthened without controlling—
this is called *Mysterious Virtue*.

The *Chapter of Vital Essence* speaks of how humans align with *Dao* and *virtue*,
while this chapter speaks of how *Dao* and *virtue* align with humans,
thus their words are similar yet their meaning is unified.

**Scripture:** The world has a beginning,
which we call the *Mother of the World*.
Having obtained this *Mother*,
one knows her offspring.
Having known the offspring,
one returns to guard the *Mother*—
thus, one’s body remains unharmed through life’s end.

**Scripture:** The world’s myriad things indeed have a beginning,
and the beginning of all things—
is it not the *Nameless*?
All things indeed have a source,
and the source that gives birth to all—
is it not the *Named*?
Thus, the *Nameless* is the world’s beginning,
and the *Named* is all things’ *Mother*.
The *Nameless* and the *Named* exist in essence and function,
for function arises from essence,
so the *Nameless* is also the *Mother* of the *Named*.

Therefore, it is said:
‘The world has a beginning,
which we call the *Mother of the World*’—
this is the *Dao* giving birth to One.
One is the *Dao’s* offspring,
the *Dao* is One’s *Mother*.
The *Dao* refers to the essence of true subtlety,
and One refers to the function of wondrous things.
Having obtained its essence,
one knows its function.
Having obtained its function,
one returns to guard its essence.
When essence and function merge as One,
responding to stimuli without end,
then one can govern without action—
thus, one’s body remains unharmed through life’s end.

**Scripture:** Seal its *mouth* (兑),
shut its *path*,
and one will never tire through life’s end.
Open its *mouth*,
complete its *affairs*,
and one will never be saved through life’s end.
Seeing what is small is called *clarity*,
guarding what is soft is called *strength*.
Using its *light*,
then returning to its *clarity*—
leaving no harm to one’s body,
this is called *following the constant*.

**Scripture:** The *mouth* is where desires take root.
The *path* is where actions arise.
With nature rectifying emotions,
the source of desires is sealed;
with principle governing affairs,
the path of actions is closed.
Thus, one can act without doing,
and do without acting—
so one never tires through life’s end.

Opening the source without sealing it,
one lengthens the desires of the emotions;
unblocking the path without closing it,
one completes the affairs of actions.
Thus, form and spirit both labor,
and one will never be saved through life’s end.

Knowing the art of sealing the *mouth* and closing the *path*,
this is called seeing the *minute* and *small*;
dulling the sharpness of desires,
dissolving the confusion of actions—
this is called guarding the *soft* and *weak*.
Guarding the *soft* and *weak*,
things cannot overpower one—
this is called *strength*.
Seeing the *minute* and *small*,
affairs cannot be muddled—
this is called *clarity*.
*Clarity* refers to inner vision (essence),
and *light* refers to outward radiance (function)."

Outwardly responding to affairs,
inwardly returning to the Way—
thus function returns to essence,
and one says: *"Use its light,
then restore its clarity."*

By returning function to essence,
one aligns with the Dao.
The Dao employs softness and weakness,
and desires do not arise—
thus one may roam through actions,
yet never be harmed by all things.

If desires are not eliminated,
one forces oneself upon affairs;
when affairs grow troublesome,
they harm the Way—
this is self-inflicted calamity.

Thus, to use seeing the *minute* and guarding the *soft*
is to employ the hidden and the eternal.

**Sutra:**
*"Let me be resolutely aware,
walking the Great Dao,
and only fear what is proper."*

The Great Dao is most level,
yet people prefer shortcuts.
Palaces are grandly cleared,
fields lie fallow,
granaries stand empty.
Garments are richly adorned,
belts hold sharp blades,
feasts are gluttonous,
wealth overflows—
this is called *robber’s vanity*.
It is not the Dao.

**Commentary:**
The Master Lao said,
*"If I were recklessly ignorant,
seeking only to conform to the age,
I would merely strive to fit in.
But if I am resolutely aware of constant clarity,
walking the Great Dao,
I would only fear what strays from it."*

The Great Dao is like a broad thoroughfare—
level and easy, reaching everywhere,
its great straightness fears no small detours.
Yet people, desiring speed,
take winding paths,
lost in confusion,
never reaching their goal.

Thus the Sage laments this,
carefully guiding teachings,
fearing to lead people astray,
lest they never align with the Great Dao.

Alas, enter a land,
and its governance is known:
If palace gates are grandly cleared,
walls and halls finely carved,
its ruler delights in construction,
seeking frivolous pleasures.
If fields lie barren,
its ruler loves forced labor,
stealing the people’s time.
If granaries stand empty,
its ruler favors frivolous pursuits,
neglecting the roots of livelihood.
If garments are richly adorned,
its ruler loves licentious craftsmanship,
exhausting artisans.
If belts hold sharp blades,
its ruler loves martial prowess,
bringing strife to the land.
If feasts are gluttonous,
its ruler loves drunkenness,
forgetting the people’s needs.
If wealth overflows,
its ruler loves taxation,
impoverishing the people.

All these are *robber’s vanity*—
stealing the people’s strength for empty display.
Thus it is called *robber’s vanity*.
*Robber’s vanity* is not the governance of the Dao.

Yet stealing takes place in secret,
and the people remain unaware.
*"Only proper action is to be feared"*—
is this not so?

**Sutra:**
The well-built cannot be uprooted,
the well-embraced cannot slip away—
ancestors’ sacrifices never cease.
Cultivate the self,
and virtue becomes genuine;
cultivate the family,
and virtue overflows;
cultivate the village,
and virtue endures;
cultivate the state,
and virtue flourishes;
cultivate the world,
and virtue is universal.

Thus, observe the self with the self,
the family with the family,
the village with the village,
the state with the state,
the world with the world.
How do I know the world is thus?
By this.

**Commentary:**
The well-built grounds the state’s foundation in the Dao,
deep-rooted and unshakable.
The well-embraced holds the people’s hearts with virtue,
unbinding and unbreakable.
Thus descendants enjoy long prosperity,
and ancestral sacrifices never fail.

Cultivate the Dao in the self,
and virtue is pure and true.
Cultivate the Dao in the family,
and virtue is abundant.
Cultivate the Dao in the village,
and virtue endures long.
Cultivate the Dao in the state,
and virtue is vast and grand.
Cultivate the Dao in the world,
and virtue spreads universally.

Thus, reflect on the self with the Dao of self-cultivation—
if the self aligns with the Dao,
virtue is genuine.
Reflect on the family with the Dao of family governance—
if family members harmonize with kin,
virtue overflows.
Reflect on the village with the Dao of village order—
if neighbors trust one another,
virtue endures.
Reflect on the state with the Dao of statecraft—
if the people thrive,
virtue flourishes.
Reflect on the world with the Dao of universal governance—
if all desire ceases,
virtue is universal.

How do I know the world, states, and even self and heart are thus?
By this reflection alone.

*The Classic of Changes* says:
*"Observe my birth—observe the people."*
Is this not the meaning?

**Sutra:**
The depth of virtue compares to an infant.
Poisonous creatures do not sting,
ferocious beasts do not seize,
grasping birds do not strike.
Bones are weak, sinews soft, yet grip is firm;
unaware of male and female union, yet virility arises—
this is the peak of *essence*.
All day it cries yet never hoarse—
this is the peak of *harmony*.
Knowing harmony is constancy,
knowing constancy is clarity,
increasing life is auspicious,
the heart directing *qi* is strength.
When things grow robust, they age—
this is called *not the Dao*.
*Not the Dao* brings early decay.

**Commentary:**
The Sage’s virtue is divine—
how else could it be thus?

The infant’s nature is pure and thick,
desires nonexistent,
tranquil and unformed.
The infant harms no thing,
nor does any thing harm it—
bees, wasps, serpents pass without sting,
grasping birds and fierce beasts encounter it without attack.
Though sinews and bones are frail,
its grasp is unyielding;
though desires are unborn,
its vigor is natural;
though it cries all day,
its voice is smooth and unstrained—
all from undispersed *essence*,
ever-present *harmony*.

Thus the Sage follows the infant’s softness and harmony,
making it the constant virtue.
Knowing harmony and softness as constant virtue,
and applying it,
is the heart’s clarity.

The birth of life is the Way’s great principle;
to follow this principle is the first of blessings.
If one thickens life and adds to blessings,
one has strayed from the Way’s principle—
disaster will surely follow.
Thus, to nourish life is called *auspicious*.

The will moves *qi*, and *qi* moves the will;
when the heart entrusts itself to *qi*,
*qi* flourishes and the heart grows strong—
this is called *strength*.

All things in their vigor must grow old,
and a strong heart must grow violent.
The Dao uses softness and weakness—
thus, strength and vigor are called *not the Dao*.
Knowing this *not the Dao*, one may cease early.

The *Classic* says:
*"Not distant, return—*
*no regret remains."*
This is what is meant.

The *Scripture* says:
*"The wise do not speak,*
*those who speak are not wise."*
Close the *ui* (mouth),
shut the gate,
blunt the sharp,
untangle the tangled,
harmonize the bright,
align with the dust—
this is called *mystic unity*.

Thus, one cannot be too close,
nor too distant.
Cannot be exploited,
nor harmed.
Cannot be honored,
nor debased.
Thus, one is noble in the world.

The *Transmission* says:
Those who know the Dao act with the heart, not with argument;
those who discuss the Dao use argument, not the heart.
Thus, the great man abandons these arguments,
takes this heart-awakening,
blocks the roots of cravings,
shuts the path of false pretenses,
blunts the edge of worldly passions,
untangles the knots of worldly schemes,
above harmonizes the radiance without glare,
below aligns with the dust without obscurity—
this is called *subtle, mysterious, and all-pervasive*,
in great harmony with all things.

In high company, he does not flatter—
thus, he cannot be too familiar.
In low company, he does not degrade—
thus, he cannot be too distant.
Modest and yielding, he does not contend—
thus, he cannot be exploited or harmed.
In high station, he does not weigh heavily—
thus, he cannot be overly honored.
In low station, he does not soil himself—
thus, he cannot be debased.
His virtue and power are self-noble,
not made so by others—
this is why he is the world’s supreme nobility.

The *Scripture* says:
*"Rule with rectitude, act with the unexpected,*
*conquer the world with non-action."*
How do I know this is so?

When the world is filled with taboos,
the people grow poorer.
When the people have many tools,
the state grows corrupt.
When the people are clever,
wicked deeds multiply.
When laws proliferate,
thieves abound.
Thus, the Sage says:
*"I act with non-action, and the people transform themselves;
I do nothing, and the people grow rich;
I love stillness, and the people become upright;
I desire nothing, and the people return to simplicity."*

The *Transmission* says:
*"To name correctly is to avoid excess—
this can govern the state."*
*"To use the unexpected is to avoid exhaustion—
this can employ the army."*
These two talents suffice to remedy disasters,
but they are not enduring or grand.
What endures and is grand
is nothing more than winning the world’s heart.
To truly win the world’s heart,
nothing surpasses *non-action*—
once action begins,
it is no longer sufficient to win the world’s heart.
How do I know this is so?

When the world has affairs,
taboos and prohibitions multiply,
intended to govern the people.
The people, seeing these affairs,
cannot settle into their work—
thus, they grow poorer.
When the people have desires,
tools and instruments multiply,
intended to aid the state.
Yet the state, with its desires,
cannot maintain stillness in governance—
thus, it grows corrupt.
When the people are clever,
this is to prevent deceit—
yet deceit grows more cunning—
thus, wicked deeds multiply.
When laws proliferate,
this is to prevent crime—
yet criminals find more ways—
thus, thieves abound.
All these are attempts to dam the flow
without blocking the source—
thus, the harm grows worse and cannot be stopped.

Since action cannot win the world’s heart,
it is known that only *non-action* can.
Thus, the Master of Lao cites the Sage’s words,
not daring to claim them as his own—
his cited words are from the *Three Containers*.
The Master of Lao, as Keeper of Records beneath the Zhou pillars,
surveyed the remnants of ancient texts,
thus citing them to confirm their necessity.

The *Transmission*’s preface says:
*"He wove together the teachings of the Yellow Emperor."*
This is of the same kind.

If I act with non-action,
the people follow their nature—
thus, their customs transform themselves.
If I do nothing,
the people return to their work—
thus, their households grow rich.
If I love stillness,
the people preserve their true nature—
thus, their affairs become upright.
If I desire nothing,
the people abandon pretension—
thus, their nature returns to simplicity.
If one has affairs and desires,
yet hopes to bring the people to wealth and longevity,
I have never seen it possible.

The *Scripture* says:
*"When governance is dim and broad,*
*the people are pure and simple;
when governance is sharp and probing,*
*the people grow weary and depleted.*
*Disaster, oh disaster—*
*where fortune hides;
fortune, oh fortune—*
*where disaster lurks.*
Who knows their end?
Perhaps there is no rectitude.
Rectitude becomes the unexpected,
goodness becomes ominous—
the people have long been confused in their days."*

The *Transmission* says:
The ruler who follows the Dao
governs with dim, broad, inclusive tolerance—
the people delight in life and follow their nature,
thus, they return to simplicity and sincerity.
The ruler without virtue
governs with sharp, clever, and harsh measures—
the people lose their livelihood and abandon their roots,
thus, they grow weary and depleted.
Thus, dim governance, which the world calls *slack*,
brings true joy to the people;
sharp governance, which the world calls *competent*,
brings true ruin to the people.
Just as the world’s so-called disasters
are all feared and hated—
because they are feared and hated,
fortune lies within them.
And the world’s so-called fortunes
are all cherished—
because they are cherished,
disaster hides within them.

Though calamity and fortune arise in tandem,
none can fathom their ultimate end—
yet when examined for good and ill,
how could there be no principle?

Broad governance and sincere people—
this may be called the True Way.
Fortune arising from disaster—
this may be called wise instruction.

Yet the world’s delusion endures long,
knowing the True Way yet not following it,
turning instead to perverse oddity;
hearing wise instruction yet not believing it,
instead embracing monstrous deceit—
this is what the Sage laments.

Thus, the Sage upholds vast simplicity as virtue,
without severing the True Way;
practices utmost integrity in conduct,
without causing grievous harm;
holds to great rectitude in heart,
without indulging in slander;
employs natural luminosity in action,
without dazzling display—
this is the dim governance spoken of,
how could it be compared to the sharp rule of the world?

The **Daoist Classic** speaks:

To govern the people and serve the **Way** of Heaven,
nothing surpasses **frugality**.
For only through **frugality** does one achieve **early return**—
the **early return** is called the **accumulation of virtue/power**,
and the **accumulation of virtue/power** means nothing is unvanquished.
If nothing is unvanquished,
then its limits are beyond measure.
Beyond measure in limits,
one may establish a state.
The state’s foundation,
one may endure long.
This is called the **Way** of deep roots and firm foundations,
of **long life** and enduring vision.

The **Transmission** says:
To govern the people and serve the **Way** of Heaven,
the key lies in **frugality**.
**Frugality** is the utmost of **simplicity** and restraint.
In **affairs**, **frugality** brings **plainness**,
and in **principle**, it brings **substance**.
**Substance** in serving the **Way** of Heaven
will earn Heaven’s blessings and aid—
this is called **"sincerity brings fulfillment."**
With **plainness** in governing the people,
the people ascend to wealth and longevity—
this is called **"restraint brings abundance."**
Only those who can guard **plainness** and **substance**
will swiftly revert to **primordial virtue/power**,
thus achieving **early return**.
**Early return** means refining excess into **plainness**,
transforming artificiality into **primordiality**—
this is called the **accumulation of enduring virtue/power**.
The **accumulation of enduring virtue/power**
allows one to act with purpose,
thus nothing remains unvanquished.
If nothing remains unvanquished,
one may act without force,
thus its limits are beyond measure.
Beyond measure in limits,
one’s life will not perish in vain,
thus one may establish a state.
The state’s foundation lies in **frugality**,
hence **frugality** is the mother of establishing a state.
If one guards the mother of establishing a state,
then its **Way** may endure long,
its **virtue/power** may last forever.
As the state’s foundation,
its roots are deep and cannot be uprooted,
its trunk is firm and cannot be dug through.
As the state’s destiny,
it grows long and knows no premature decay,
its vision endures and never grows dim.

The **Daoist Classic** speaks:
To govern a great state,
one should treat it as cooking a small fish.
Those who rule the world with the **Dao**—
their spirits are not **divine**.
Not that their spirits are not **divine**,
but that the **divine** does not harm people;
Not that the **divine** does not harm people,
but that the Sage does not harm people.
When both do not harm each other,
**virtue/power** and **spirit** return in harmony.

The **Transmission** says:
To govern a state with ten thousand chariots
is like cooking a fish no larger than a palm—
though one may adjust the water and fire,
the key is to avoid **overt manipulation**.
**Overt manipulation** will harm the fish,
and the fish harmed will spoil in the cauldron.
So too with ruling the world by the **Dao**—
though one may harmonize governance and teachings,
the key is to avoid **disturbance**.
**Disturbance** will harm the people,
and the people harmed will scatter in chaos within the state.
Thus, the Sage’s governance of the world
lies in not harming people.
If so, then spirits and **divine** beings will be moved by the Sage’s **virtue/power**,
and dare not harm people.
Now, when speaking of ruling the world by the **Dao**,
it says the spirits are not **divine**—
for the Sage’s **virtue/power** is the most beneficial in the **manifest**,
while spirits’ harm is most insidious in the **hidden**.
Thus, it raises the extreme contrast
to seek their **reconciliation**,
to explore the **hidden** and **manifest** in depth.
In the *Book of Changes*’s *□* (hexagram of **dispersion**),
the ninth line says:
*"Seeing a boar trampling the mud,
a spirit loaded in a cart.
First, the taut bow,
then, the slackened bow."*
This is what is meant.
The Sage’s **virtue/power** of not harming begins with this,
and now it first speaks of spirits not being **divine**,
to return and align with the Sage.
For spirits are **divine** only in their capacity to harm,
and now they cannot harm because the **manifest** and **divine** do not harm people.
The spirits cannot be **divine**,
and they do not harm people,
because the Sage does not harm people.
The Sage does not harm people,
so spirits and **divine** beings do not harm people.
Now, having first raised that spirits and **divine** beings do not harm people,
it returns to say the Sage does not harm people.
The Sage—
would they only prevent spirits and **divine** beings from harming people?
They also ensure people do not harm spirits and **divine** beings.
When people and spirits rely upon each other,
and neither harms the other,
then the **hidden** and **manifest** respond in harmony to the Sage’s **virtue/power**,
hence it says **"virtue/power and spirit return in harmony."**

The **Daoist Classic** speaks:
The great state is the **lowering** of the world,
the **intercourse** of the world—
the **intercourse** of the world is **feminine**.
The **feminine** always overcomes the **masculine** through **stillness**,
and **stillness** is **lowering**.
Thus, the great state, in **lowering** itself to the small state,
takes the small state;
The small state, in **lowering** itself to the great state,
takes the great state.
Thus, sometimes **lowering** brings **taking**,
sometimes **lowering** is **taking**.
The great state seeks only to **encompass and nurture** others,
The small state seeks only to **submit and serve** others—
both achieve their desires,
hence the great should **lower** itself.

The **Transmission** says:
The great state is where all states converge,
The **lowering** is where all currents gather.
Where all currents gather,
it becomes the **intercourse** of the world;
Where all states converge,
it becomes the **feminine** of the world.
The **feminine**—
in its **humility** and **stillness**, it guards itself,
and is beloved by all the **masculine**.
The **feminine** always overcomes the **masculine**,
not because it is **soft** and **still**,
but because it can be the **foundation** for all things?
Thus, the **feminine**’s **stillness** and **humility**,
truly can overcome the **turbulent** and the **forceful**.
Hence, the ruler of the great state,
if they grasp this **art**, will take the small state;
The ruler of the small state,
if they grasp this **art**, will take the great state.
The great state **lowers** itself to the small state—
this is the **Dao**’s **action**,
hence it says *"sometimes **lowering** brings **taking**."*
The small state **lowers** itself to the great state—
this is the **Dao**’s **practice**,
hence it says *"sometimes **lowering** is **taking**."*
The great state seeks only to **encompass and nurture** the small state,
to fulfill its greatness;
The small state seeks only to **submit and serve** the great state,
to preserve its smallness.
If both are to fulfill their wishes,
then the ruler of the great state should **lower** themselves first,
and the ruler of the small state will gladly submit to the great state.
Thus, this is truly the **intercourse** of the world, the **feminine** of the world.
The small state, in **lowering** itself to the great state,
seeks only its own **preservation**,
while the great state, in **lowering** itself to the small state,
gains the world’s **convergence**—
hence the great state should **lower** itself first.

The **Daoist Classic** speaks:
The **Dao** is the **hidden essence** of all things,
a treasure for the **good**,
a safeguard for the **not good**.
Fine words can **trade**,
noble conduct can **bestow** upon others.
If people are **not good**,
what need is there to abandon them?
Thus, when establishing the **Son of Heaven**,
appointing the **Three Exalted Ministers**,
even if one has **arching jade** and **four-horse chariots** to precede them,
it is not as good as **sitting and advancing** this **Dao**.

The ancients held this **Dao** in such high esteem—why not say that one may *daily* seek it and attain it, or that one may *avoid punishment* through it? Thus, it is the most precious for the world.

The **Commentary** states:
The **Dao** is vast and all-encompassing,
hence it is the hidden essence of all things.

The **virtuous** obtain its use as if holding a treasure,
while the **not virtuous** rely upon it for **preservation**—
thus it is their safeguard.
Those who adorn their speech can **trade** with the masses,
those who exalt their conduct can **bestow** upon others.
How much more so the **Dao**, subtle and profound,
where nothing is beyond its reach!
The **virtuous** obtain it as a treasure,
the **not virtuous** find their safeguard—
why then should the **virtuous** be honored,
while the **not virtuous** are abandoned?

The **Master Lao** held **utter compassion** as his heart,
thus he extolled and praised it.
How could one abandon the **not virtuous**?

Therefore, when establishing the **Son of Heaven** and appointing the **Three Exalted Ministers**,
it is precisely to teach the **not virtuous**.
If one honors the **virtuous** while abandoning the **not virtuous**,
then the **not virtuous** will have no further incentive to turn toward **self-renewal** and goodness,
but will instead be perpetually cast aside by the world—
what use then would the **Son of Heaven** and the **Three Exalted Ministers** have in teaching and transforming?

Thus, even if one presents **arching jade** and precedes it with **four-horse chariots**,
while frantically seeking **accomplished talent**,
it is not as good as **sitting and advancing** this **Dao**.

Now then, why from ancient times to the present has this **Dao** been held in such high esteem?
Is it not because one may *daily* seek it and attain it,
or that one may *avoid punishment* through it?
Why is it so?

The **Dao** lies near, yet people seek it afar—
then it cannot be attained.
Thus, seeking the **Dao** does not require distance;
it lies in knowing its **return** (反).
If one can **return** to one’s own **body-mind** (身心),
then seeking will yield attainment—
is this not the case that one may *daily* seek it and attain it?

Yet, why do people harbor so many **guilt and evils**?
Because they do not know the **Dao**.
If one can grasp the **Dao’s essence** and obtain its use,
then one may resolve conflicts and blunt sharpness,
overcome firmness and conquer strength—
no one can contend, no thing can harm—
is this not the case that one may *avoid punishment* through it?

Therefore, the *Records* say:
The **Dao** is something one cannot for a moment depart from;
what one can depart from is not the **Dao**.
If one is not thus **virtuous**,
how could one be worthy of the world’s highest honor?

The **Classic** states:
**Act without acting**, **do without doing**, **savor without savoring**.
Great or small, much or little—
**respond to resentment with virtue**.
The **Commentary** states:
Those who embody the **Dao** are subtle and profound in their penetration of the world;
they **act** in response to the world, yet their root is **non-action**;
they **do** in response to the times, yet their essence is **non-doing**;
they **savor** in response to things, yet their foundation is **non-savoring**.

Though their **embodiment** may be vast, their **primordial simplicity** (朴) is most minute;
though their **use** may be manifold, their **essence** (要) is most sparse.
Their **method** lies in **tranquil simplicity** and **stillness**,
so that they are not bent by the myriad things.

Only thus may they be **without desire**;
**without desire**, they are **without self-interest**.
**Favor** is where **self-interest** resides,
**resentment** is where **favor** takes root.
Only the **Sage** can be **without self-interest**,
**without self-interest**, they have no **private favor**,
**without private favor**, they have no **private resentment**.
Common people are not so;
because they possess **self-interest**,
they have **favor and resentment**.

Yet, if the world harbors **resentment**,
the **Sage** **responds with virtue** to **resentment**;
if people are **not virtuous**,
the **Sage** **nurtures virtue** in the **virtuous**.
Thus, the people live in harmony,
and there is no **resentment** between ruler and ruled.

**Responding to resentment with virtue**—
is this what the *Records* call **the compassion that widens the self**?
Did **Zhongni** (仲尼) say that one who fulfills the **Dao** throughout the world has no **resentment or guilt**?
Did he ever speak of the **Sage** having **resentment** toward things?

The **Classic** states:
**Plan difficulties** while they are easy,
**achieve greatness** while they are small.
The world’s difficult matters must be begun when they are easy,
the world’s great matters must be begun when they are small.
Thus, the **Sage** never strives for the great,
and so can accomplish the great.

The **Sage** who makes **light promises** will be **few in trustworthiness**,
who takes **many easy paths** will meet **many difficulties**—
thus the **Sage** treats even the easy with caution,
and so ultimately faces no difficulty.

The **Commentary** states:
The **pivot of action** (枢机) is the world’s most easy thing,
yet when it moves the heavens and earth,
it becomes the world’s most difficult thing.
The **most sincere clarity** is the world’s most minute thing,
yet when it leads to **enduring longevity**,
it becomes the world’s greatest thing.

Thus, to move the heavens and earth,
one must take **speech with utmost care** as primary;
to achieve **enduring longevity**,
one must **cultivate flexibility** as foundation.
Holding fast to the primary and grasping the foundation,
then the **principles of the world** are attained.

All begin with what is **easy and small**,
yet complete in what is **difficult and great**—
thus the **Sage** never strives for the great,
and so can accomplish the great.

Those who make **light promises** are **few in trustworthiness**,
who take **many easy paths** meet **many difficulties**—
thus, it is better to have **self-resentment** than to fail in **promises**,
better to have **actions float above words** than to have **words float above actions**.
Even the **Sage** finds this difficult,
how much more so for the common people?

Only because one begins with what is **not easy**,
does one end with what is **not difficult**—
thus, if one does not make **light promises** at the start,
one will not be **few in trustworthiness** at the end.
This is an inevitable principle—
can one not strive to uphold it?

The **Classic** states:
When its **stability** is easy to maintain,
when its **ominous signs** are easy to **plot against**,
when its **fragility** is easy to **shatter**,
when its **subtlety** is easy to **dissipate**—
**act before it exists**, **govern before it is disordered**.
A tree thick enough to embrace grows from a tiny sprout;
a nine-tiered tower rises from a pile of earth;
a journey of a thousand *li* begins beneath one’s feet.

The **Commentary** states:
If the world is yet **stable**, it is easy to maintain its **fullness**;
if a **state** is already **dangerous**, it is difficult to **settle its decline**.
If **deceitful intent** has not yet **manifested**, it is easy to **devise plots** and **eliminate it**;
if **evil appearance** has already **taken shape**, it is difficult to **erase its extinction**.
If **sprouts** are still **tender**, their **calamities** are easy to **break**;
if **branches and trunks** have already **formed**, their **disasters** are difficult to **blunt**.
If **regret and stinginess** are yet **subtle**, their **worries** are easy to **dispel**;
if **wickedness and retribution** have already **become evident**, their **sin** is difficult to **pursue**.
Thus, the **Sage** **acts before it exists**,
so that its **evil** does not **sprout**;
**governs before it is disordered**,
so that **harm** does not **arise**.

Therefore, the **Sage’s governance** is **without knowing** and **without desire**;
they **perceive its mechanisms**,
take **caution in its subtleties**,
so that the common people may **daily use** it without knowing.

If one does not **prevent** it beforehand or **govern** it early,
it is like planting a tree beginning with its **sprout**—
one may **pluck** it and **sever** it while still **tender**,
but once it reaches **embrace-thickness** and beyond,
it becomes **unfellable**.

It is like building a terrace beginning with a **mound of earth**—
one may **kick** it and **collapse** it while still **low**,
but once it rises to **nine layers** and beyond,
it becomes **indestructible**.

It is like embarking on a **long journey** beginning with the **first step**—
one may **retreat** it with a **single tread**,
but once it extends to **a thousand li** and beyond,
it becomes **irreversible**.

The *Classic of Changes* says:
*"Treading frost, solid ice arrives."*
This is what is meant.

**Scripture** says:
*"The doer brings about its ruin; the grasper loses it."*
Thus, the Sage, by **non-action**, knows no ruin,
by **non-grasp**, knows no loss.

The people’s undertakings
are ever **nearly complete** when they **fail**.
To **revere the end as the beginning** is to know no ruin.

Thus, the Sage **desires without desiring**,
does not **value** hard-to-obtain wealth;
**learns without learning**,
reversing the common people’s **errors**.

To **assist** the **natural unfolding** of all things
without **daring to act**.

**Scripture** says:
*"Position"* is the Sage’s **greatest treasure**.
*"The realm"* is the **divine instrument** of the world.
The **divine instrument** cannot be **seized** and **wielded**—
to seize and wield it is to **ensure ruin**.
The **greatest treasure** cannot be **held** and **possessed**—
to hold and possess it is to **ensure loss**.

Thus, when the Sage **holds the realm**,
they **delight in yielding** without **satiation**,
so there is **nothing to seize**.
To **seize nothing** is to **know no ruin**.
When the Sage **possesses the greatest treasure**,
they **complete the work** without **dwelling upon it**,
so there is **nothing to grasp**.
To **grasp nothing** is to **know no loss**.

The common people’s nature **loves action**—
action brings **many affairs**, many affairs bring **ruin**.
Thus, in their **undertakings in the world**,
they are ever **nearly complete** when they **fail**.
Why is this so?
Because they do not **take care at the beginning**.

If one **takes care at the beginning**,
**considering the end**,
then nothing surpasses **few desires**.
Few desires mean few affairs,
few affairs mean no ruin.
Because they **take care at the beginning**,
they can **complete without ruin**.
Rooted in **taking care at the beginning**,
they make **completion without ruin**.

This is why **both ruin and no ruin** are **held up**—
to show the **vast difference** between the common and the Sage.

Now, what the common people **desire** is **wealth and beauty**.
What they **do not desire** is **clarity and tranquility**.
The Sage **desires what they do not desire**,
thus does not **value** hard-to-obtain wealth.

What the common people **learn** is **worldly deeds**.
What they **do not learn** is **non-action**.
The Sage **learns what they do not learn**,
thus **reverses** the common people’s **errors**.

They **thicken** what **is so**,
only to **assist** the **natural unfolding** of all things.
Thus, they **dare not act**, **dare not grasp**,
and so **know no ruin, no loss**.

**Scripture** says:
*"The ancients who excelled in the Dao*
did not **enlighten** the people,
but **made them ignorant** instead.
The people are **difficult to govern** because they are **too clever**.
Thus, governing with **cleverness** is the **ruin** of the realm;
not governing with **cleverness** is the **blessing** of the realm.
To know these two is the **standard**."

To **constantly know the standard** is called **mysterious virtue**.
**Mysterious virtue** is profound, distant,
**contrary to things**—
only then does it reach **great harmony**.

**Scripture** says:
*"The reason the rivers and seas can be the **sovereigns** of all valleys*
is that they **excel in humility**,
thus they become the **sovereigns** of all valleys.
Thus, the Sage **desires to be above** others—
by **speaking humbly** beneath them;
**desires to lead** others—
by **placing themselves behind** them.
Thus, though **placed above**, others do not **feel burdened**;
though **placed before**, others do not **feel harmed**.
Thus, the world **delights in yielding** without **satiation**.
Because they **do not contend**, the world cannot **contend with them**."

**Scripture** says:
The *Classic of Changes* states:
*"The Way of Heaven diminishes the **excessive** and benefits the **modest**;
the Way of Earth transforms the **excessive** and flows toward the **modest**;
spirits and gods **harm the excessive** and **bridge the modest**;
the Way of humanity **hates the excessive** and **loves the modest**.
**Modesty** as a virtue—
**lowly** yet **nurturing itself**—
thus the rivers and seas, by **modesty**, become the virtue
to which all valleys **turn**.
The Sage, by **modesty**, becomes the virtue
to which the world **first ascends**.
Does the Sage **desire to ascend first**?
No—
the world **delights in yielding** without **satiation**.
Thus, it is said **‘desire to ascend first’**—
to **exhort** the people with the Sage’s example.

Now, when the Sage **occupies the highest position**,
do they **contend** to attain it?
The *Book of Documents* says:
*"You alone do not contend,
thus none contend with your ability;
you alone do not **boast**,
thus none contend with your **merits."*
This is what is meant.

**Scripture** says:
*"The world all say my Dao is great,
yet seems **unworthy**."*

**The Great, thus appearing unworthy.**
If it were worthy for long, then it would be trifling indeed.
I possess three treasures—guard them and uphold them:
First, **compassion**; second, **frugality**; third, **not daring to act first under Heaven**.

**Compassion**, thus one can be **courageous**; **frugality**, thus one can be **abundant**; **not daring to act first under Heaven**, thus one can become the **master of implements and leader**.

Now, if one **discards compassion** and yet **pretends to courage**, **discards frugality** and yet **pretends to abundance**, **discards humility** and yet **pretends to act first**, then one is **undone**.

**Compassion**, in war makes one **upright**; in defense makes one **steadfast**. When Heaven intends to save a people, it does so with **compassion as their shield**.

**Scripture** says:
*"All under Heaven say the Dao of Laozi is vast and broad,
yet seems unilluminated and wise—
like an unworthy person.
Laozi alone knows his Dao is most great,
thus he appears as such an unworthy one.
If the world were to deem him worthy,
then his Dao would have long been trifling—
how could it still be called great?"*

**Commentary** says:
*"Ning Wuzi’s wisdom may be imitated,
but his folly cannot—
this is close indeed.
Yet though my Dao appears unworthy,
its three treasures are precious—
if guarded and upheld, they can govern.
They are **compassion**, **frugality**, and **not daring to act first under Heaven**."*

Those who **take pity on all things** must be **bold in rescue**—
this is the **courage of the virtuous**.
Those who **are frugal in use** must be **generous in giving**—
this is **moderation in expenditure and love for the people**.
Those who **do not act first under Heaven** must become **masters of implements and leaders**—
this is **using the nine [trigrams] and seeing the group of dragons without a head—auspicious indeed**.

Now, what the world calls **worthy** is not so:
They **discard compassion** and yet **pretend to righteous courage**, plunging others into ruin—
this is **excessive to the point of self-destruction**.
They **discard frugality** and yet **pretend to lavish giving**, depleting wealth and harming the people.
They **abandon what would place them last** and yet **pretend to act first under Heaven**—
this is **rebellion and treason**.

Such actions **do not accord with the Dao**,
and they **invite their own ruin**.
Yet of these three treasures, **compassion is most precious**.
To **take pity on all things** is to **grieve and love them**.
Those who love others are loved in return;
those who grieve for others are grieved for in return.
When others grieve for you, they aid you—
thus, in battle, your ranks stand **upright**.
When others love you, they protect you—
thus, in defense, your **walls and cities stand firm**.
This is why, when Heaven intends to save a people,
it **endows them with compassion and love**.
When a people have compassion, their battle lines are **upright**,
their defenses **unshaken**—
thus, **compassion is their shield**.

*The Classic of Changes* says:
*"When Heaven aids them, it is auspicious—
nothing is unfavorable."*
This is what is meant.

When Heaven intends to **abandon a people**,
it **loads them with calamitous virtue**.
A people with calamitous virtue have **disordered battle lines**,
**collapsing defenses**—
thus, **calamitous virtue brings defeat**.

*The Sayings* say:
*"When Heaven thickens their wickedness,
their wickedness thickens—
they are near to collapse."*
This is what is meant.

**Scripture** says:
*"The skilled warrior is not fierce,
the skilled fighter does not rage,
the skilled victor does not contend,
the skilled ruler places himself below others.
This is called the **virtue of non-contention**,
this is called **using the strength of others**,
this is called **harmonizing with Heaven**—
the ultimate of the ancients."*

**Commentary** says:
*"The skilled commander of soldiers
loves the people with compassion,
does not strike first,
thus is not **brutally fierce**.
The skilled in battle
**leads and waits for response**,
does not delight in **overwhelming the enemy**,
thus does not **threaten with anger**.
The skilled in victory
does not **move for gain**,
but **follows the momentum** to take,
thus does not **act first**.
The skilled in using others
**humbles themselves**, **diminishes their own worth**,
and **aligns with the lowest**—
thus they are always **below others**.

When using troops, they **conquer with harmony**—
this is the **virtue of non-contention**.
When leading the people, they **delight them in facing danger**—
this is **using the strength of others**.
Such is the **natural way of Heaven**,
with no artifice—
thus they can **conquer and harmonize with the Divine**,
the ultimate of the ancients."*

**Scripture** says:
*"In the use of arms, there is a saying:
‘I do not dare to be the aggressor but the defender,
I do not dare to advance an inch but retreat a foot.’
This is called **moving without movement**,
**pushing without arms**,
**grasping without weapons**,
**confronting without enemies**.
No greater calamity than **underestimating the enemy**—
to underestimate the enemy is nearly to **lose my treasures**.
Thus, when armies clash,
the **compassionate prevail**."*

**Commentary** says:
*"Laozi laments the world’s use of arms,
taking **killing as their foundation**,
thus he cites ancient military strategies
to show the **reluctance of necessary warfare**.

The laws of wielding troops:
The aggressor **plans to raise arms**,
the defender **responds to the enemy**.
Though advancing little, they **draw near to killing**;
though retreating much, they **turn toward life**—
thus, **one does not dare to be the aggressor but the defender**,
**does not dare to advance an inch but retreat a foot**—
this is **bold in daring to kill**,
but **bold in not daring is to preserve life**.

Thus, when the general **moves forward with the front foot in order**,
it seems as if there is **no formation to follow**.
When the general **raises his arm to charge first**,
it seems as if there is **no arm to raise**.
When the general **takes up his weapons**,
it seems as if there are **no weapons to wield**.
His enemy seems **without resistance**—
constantly rooted in **compassion and love**,
not delighting in killing,
the people **move for him in response**,
as if **hands rescue the head**,
as if **sons rescue their fathers**—
ultimately, **unmatched under Heaven**.

Those who are **unmatched under Heaven**—
this is **victory in war**.
Victory in war **necessarily involves much killing**,
and **much killing is the greatest calamity**.
Yet if one **abandons compassion**,
this is **extreme unworthiness**—
so why say it is **near to losing my treasures**?

I **originally relied on compassion and love**,
not delighting in killing—
only when **forced** did I become unmatched,
not my true intent.
Since it was not my original intent,
this is **a loss**—
though not yet **utter ruin**,
thus it is said **near to losing**.

From this, when armies clash
and victory is **not yet decided**,
if one **loves their people**,
they will **preserve their victory whole**."*

「Who then? The one who loves their people
will necessarily grieve over their deaths.
When the people know their ruler grieves over their deaths,
they will in turn grieve over their ruler’s loss of life—
thus they rally to give their lives,
and the ruler secures their victory whole.

At the outset, love for the people is the foundation;
at the end, grief over death brings victory—
thus it is said: *grief brings victory*.

**Scripture** says:
*"My words are very easy to know,
very easy to follow.
Yet none under Heaven can know them,
none can follow them.
Words have a principle,
affairs have a sovereign—
it is only because they lack knowledge,
that they do not know me."*

Those who know me are few,
so those who follow me are precious.
Thus the Sage wears coarse robes while cherishing jade within.

**Commentary** says:
Laozi’s words are,
*"My words must have substance,
thus they are very easy to follow—
yet people under Heaven are benighted by desire,
so none can follow them.
Yet my actions have sovereigns—
sovereigns meaning *principles*.
It is only because none under Heaven can know these,
that they do not know me.*

If one speaks of *subtle and profound* [微妙玄通],
deep and unrecognizable,
then those who know me are few indeed.
If only I possess what others cannot recognize,
then what I have is precious indeed.
Thus the Sage wears coarse robes to obscure his exterior,
cherishes jade to preserve his interior.
This is what the **Scripture** means by:
*'True substance is like unrefined jade'* [质真若渝].

**Scripture** says:
*"To know what one does not know is noble;
to not know what one knows is sickness.
It is only through sickness of sickness,
that one does not fall ill.
The Sage does not fall ill,
because they can be sickened by sickness—
thus they do not fall ill."*

**Commentary** says:
*"To be clear and far-reaching,
yet appear as one who does not know,
this is noble knowing.
To not know this clear and far-reaching,
this is knowing as sickness.
It is only through being able to be sickened by what is sick,
that what is sick cannot sicken them.
Thus the Sage is not afflicted by knowing,
because they can be afflicted by the sickness of knowing—
so knowing cannot afflict them."*

**Scripture** says:
*"If the people do not fear great threats,
then greater threats will come.
Do not trample where you reside,
do not exhaust what you are born with.
It is only through not exhausting,
that one does not exhaust.
Thus the Sage knows themselves but does not display themselves,
loves themselves but does not exalt themselves—
therefore they discard that and take this."*

**Commentary** says:
The *Book of Changes* says:
*"The petty man, seeing no profit, does not exert himself;
seeing no threat, does not fear.
Small punishments and great warnings—
this is the petty man’s blessing.
Thus it is said: *‘A wooden clog destroys the foot, yet there is no blame.’*
The petty man, treating minor vices as harmless and not removing them,
allows them to accumulate beyond concealment,
and their crimes grow beyond absolution.
Thus it is said: *‘A load of clogs destroys the ear, bringing disaster.’*
This is the meaning of: *‘If the people do not fear great threats, then greater threats will come.’*

The petty man’s reason for not fearing threats and not removing vices
is the *error of the heart*.
When great threats come and cannot be absolved,
this is the *calamity of the body*.
The Sage is otherwise:
they know the heart’s errors and remove them,
love their body and fear its calamities—
thus they can nourish life and preserve form whole.

The heart is where the *spirit* [神] habitually resides.
If one does not profane it with indulgent desires,
then it will not be trampled.
The *spirit* is what gives life to form.
If one does not weary it with excessive affairs,
then it will not be exhausted.
It is only because people do not exhaust the *spirit*,
that the *spirit* does not exhaust people—
thus it is said: *‘To know the heart’s errors and remove them,
not to display oneself yet nourish life.’*
To love one’s body and fear calamities,
not to exalt oneself yet preserve form whole.
If one exalts and can preserve form whole,
if one displays and can nourish life,
then this is teaching the people to nourish life by *non-Dao* means,
to preserve form by *non-principle* means.
Thus one discards that display and exaltation,
and takes this knowing and loving.

**Scripture** says:
*"To dare with courage is to kill;
to not dare with courage is to live.
These two paths—
one brings benefit, one brings harm.
What does Heaven abhor?
Who knows its reason?"*
Thus the Sage finds it difficult.

The *Dao of Heaven*,
does not contend yet wins well,
does not speak yet responds well,
does not summon yet comes of its own accord,
is humble yet plans well.
The Heavenly net is vast and sweeping,
loose yet never misses.

**Commentary** says:
*"To dare with resolute courage—
this is the path of killing.
To dare without resolute courage—
this is the path of life.
Both require courage,
yet their applications differ:
to dare with courage harms life,
to dare without courage benefits life.
Then does Heaven abhor this daring courage?
This obstinacy?
The daring courage harms life,
the obstinacy harms oneself—
who knows Heaven’s reason for abhorring daring courage and obstinacy?
Perhaps it is because they cannot use *gentleness and yielding* [巽顺柔弱]?
The *Book of Documents* says:
*'High and exalted, yielding overcomes.'*
Thus Heaven takes *gentleness and yielding* as *virtue*.

How is this proven?
Heaven does not contend with all things,
yet all things submit of their own accord—
this is *well-winning*.
Heaven does not speak to the people,
yet the people trust naturally—
this is *well-responding*.
Heaven does not contend with the four seasons,
yet the four seasons come in their time—
this is *coming of its own accord*.
Though possessing three *virtues*,
Heaven does not act first—
yet it manifests symbols and reveals auspicious or inauspicious signs,
knowing them before their appearance.
It blesses the good and punishes the licentious,
not differing by a hair’s breadth—
this may be called *well-planning*.
Thus the Heavenly net, though vast and loose,
never misses those who reverse the *Dao* or ruin *virtue*.
The *Book of Documents* says:
*'For goodness, Heaven bestows a hundred blessings;
for evil, Heaven bestows a hundred calamities.'*
This is what is meant.

**Scripture** says:
*"The people are always not afraid of death—
how can one frighten them with death?
If one makes the people always afraid of death,
and they act strangely,
I can seize and kill them—
who would dare?
There are always those charged with killing who kill.
But if those who are not charged with killing kill,
this is like substituting for the master carpenter.
To substitute for the master carpenter,
there are few who do not injure their hands."*»

**Commentary** says:
*"People under Heaven are always ensnared by profit and desire,
though threatened with death, they still do not cease—
how then should the rulers of this age
create harsh punishments and cruel laws,
and drive them by fear of death?"*

If the people are always made to fear death,
then I may seize and kill those who act strangely—
who would dare to do so again?
Even now, though I may kill them,
those who act strangely do not cease,
and thus it is clear that the people do not truly fear death.

Then why impose harsh punishments and cruel laws,
which cannot even awe the masses?
If so, those guilty under Heaven
should be entrusted to the most just executioners.
Thus, the Sage follows Heaven’s will and clarifies its authority,
to govern the Five Punishments.
The master of just execution is called the *司杀者* [Executor].
The *Scripture* says:
*"Heaven punishes the guilty—
the Five Punishments are fully applied."*
Therefore, punishment aims not to punish,
but to show mercy in punishment.
If the ruler does not let the Executor judge crimes by the most just principles,
but arbitrarily kills at will,
this is like a substitute carpenter hewing wood—
one who is unskilled in hewing but still takes the place of another.
If one is unskilled in hewing yet still takes another’s place,
their hands will surely be injured,
their work ruined—
this is what is meant by *"few who do not injure their hands."*

Thus, Guan Zhong said:
*"The ruler should perfect the Way of the high officials,
yet not meddle in their affairs.
Therefore, when the ruler interferes in matters below,
the officials cannot fulfill their duties—
the horses cannot run as they should,
the birds cannot fly as they should."*
This is what is meant.

**Scripture** says:
*"The people’s hunger comes from their rulers taking too much in taxes—
thus they hunger.
The people are hard to govern because their rulers act too much—
thus they are hard to govern.
The people treat death lightly because their rulers provide too much for life—
thus they treat death lightly.
Only those who do not seek life are wiser than those who cherish life."*

**Commentary** says:
*"In ancient times, public fields were recorded but not taxed;
later, the tithe was imposed—
this was the standard for all under Heaven.
Now, if those above take too much in taxes,
the people cannot help but hunger.
In ancient times, those above had no desires, no actions,
so their people had little to do,
each following their nature.
Now, those above act and desire,
so their people have much to do,
cannot secure their lives,
and thus governance becomes difficult.
The people’s lives have inherent limits—
they cannot be overindulged.
If their lives are overindulged,
they will exceed natural limits,
and exceeding limits in life
will surely bring death.
Thus, treating death lightly comes from overindulgence in life.
Only those who do not cling to life
are wiser than those who cherish it."*

**Scripture** says:
*"When people are born, they are soft and weak;
when they die, they become stiff and strong.
All plants and grasses, when born, are soft and fragile;
when they die, they wither and decay.
Thus, stiffness and strength belong to death,
softness and weakness belong to life.
Therefore, strong armies do not conquer,
rigid trees split.
The strong and great are placed below.
The weak and soft are placed above."*

**Commentary** says:
*"Life is soft and weak, death is stiff and strong—
this is the shared fate of all things.
Thus, the Sage cherishes softness and weakness,
rejects stiffness and strength.
If armies are strong against the people,
the lords will unite against their state;
if trees are rigid in their trunks,
their branches and leaves will wither above.
Thus, strong trunks and great roots are always below,
weak branches and tender shoots are always above.
If even trees are so,
how much more so for people?
How much more so for states?"*

**Scripture** says:
*"The Way of Heaven—
is it not like drawing a bow?
The high are lowered, the low are raised.
The excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.
The Way of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient.
But the Way of humanity does the opposite:
it diminishes the deficient and bestows upon the excessive.
Who can bestow upon the world with their excess?
Only the Sage can do so.
Thus, the Sage acts but does not rely on it,
achieves success but does not claim it—
is this not because they do not wish to appear virtuous?"*

**Commentary** says:
*The *Classic of Changes* says:
*"Establishing Heaven’s Way is called yin and yang.
Yang ascends, yin descends.
When yang ascends to its peak in Heaven, it descends;
when yin descends to its peak on Earth, it ascends.
This is lowering the high and raising the low—
the image of a drawn bow.
Heaven’s Way of fullness and emptiness:
one cycle, seven intercalations,
diminishing the excess of days,
supplementing the deficiency of months.
But the Way of humanity does the opposite:
it diminishes the deficient people,
while bestowing upon the excessive ruler.
Who can follow Heaven’s Way to make it the Way of humanity,
diminishing their own excess
to bestow upon the world’s deficiencies?
Only the Sage can do so.
In the *Classic of Changes*, ‘diminishing below and supplementing above’ is called *Punishment* [损],
‘diminishing above and supplementing below’ is called *Benefit* [益],
with the low as the root.
Thus, the Sage can act without relying on their deeds,
can achieve success without claiming it—
because they do not wish to appear virtuous to others,
and thus the world calls them ‘seemingly unworthy,’
all in accordance with the principle of diminishing excess and bestowing deficiency."*

**Scripture** says:
*"Under Heaven, nothing is softer and weaker than water,
yet nothing can overcome the strong and rigid like it—
there is nothing to replace it.
Thus, the soft overcomes the hard,
the weak overcomes the strong—
all under Heaven know this,
yet none can practice it.
Therefore, the Sage says:
‘To bear a state’s filth is called the Lord of Soil and Grain;
to bear a state’s misfortunes is to be King of all under Heaven.’
Thus, correct speech seems contrary."*

**Commentary** says:
*"The flow of water, though fine, can drill through stone—
this is because of its softness and weakness,
and nothing can replace it.
Thus, it is clear that softness and weakness overcome hardness and strength.
All under Heaven know this,
yet none can emulate and practice it,
so Laozi cites the Sage’s words to exhort them—
this is also the remnant of the *Three Ancient Classics*.
To bear a state’s filth and impurity,
one may become its Lord of Soil and Grain;
to bear a state’s misfortunes,
one may become King of all under Heaven—
these words are very correct,
yet they seem contrary when observed.
The *Commentary* says:
‘Mountains and marshes receive filth,
the sovereign bears shame.’
This is close to the meaning."*

**Scripture** says:
*"To reconcile great grudges,
there must be remaining grudges—
how can this be considered good?"*

Thus the Sage holds the left tablet of the contract,
yet does not demand repayment from others.
Therefore, one of virtue oversees the contract,
while one without virtue oversees the receipt.
The Dao of Heaven shows no favoritism,
yet always aligns with the virtuous.

*The Commentary* says:
‘When ruler and people are in harmony,
the people harbor no grudges.
When ruler and people are estranged,
great grudges arise.
Though one may reconcile them,
the harm remains unhealed.
With lingering grudges,
how can this be considered good?
Must it not be that there be no grudges at all?’

In ancient times, when knots were tied to make covenants,
the people did not deceive.
When wooden tablets were split to record agreements,
the people did not violate them.
Why?
Because the Sage had no fixed intentions,
taking the hearts of the people as their own.
Thus, the Sage’s heart and the people’s heart
were like the left and right tablets of a contract.
When the contract was presented, it was fulfilled without demand,
so ruler and people were in harmony,
and grudges never arose.

Later generations could not hold the left tablet to respond to affairs,
but instead upheld the fixed receipt to govern the people.
Seeking harmony in this way
inevitably left lingering grudges.

Thus, it is known:
A ruler of virtue oversees the heart-contract to avoid grudges—
this alone attains goodness.
A ruler without virtue oversees only the written record to reconcile grudges—
how can this be considered good?

The Dao of Heaven shows no partiality,
bestowing itself only upon the virtuous,
just as the Sage holds the left tablet,
taking only the hearts of others as their own.

**Scripture** says:
*"In small states with few people,
let the people have ten-fold or hundred-fold tools,
yet they shall not use them.
Let the people hold death in reverence
and not wander far.
Though there be boats and carriages,
they shall have no need to ride them.
Though there be armor and weapons,
they shall have no need to display them.
Let the people return to using knotted cords for contracts.
Let their food be savored,
their garments fine,
their dwellings secure,
their customs joyous.
Neighboring states, though near enough to hear roosters crow and dogs bark,
let the people reach old age and die
without visiting one another."*

*The Commentary* says:
‘Small states with few people,
by nature unable to sustain themselves,
yet if one of the Way governs them,
they can still prevent the people from using their ten-fold or hundred-fold tools
for warfare.
Thus, the people cherish life and revere death,
are content with their land and do not migrate.
They do not seek distant allies for aid,
so though there be boats and carriages,
they have no need to ride them.
They do not engage in aggression for gain,
so though there be armor and weapons,
they have no need to display them.
Ruler and people live in harmony,
the living and the dead are without deceit.
The people return to using knotted cord covenants,
and do not violate them.
Their desires are few,
so they savor their coarse food,
admire their frugal garments.
Their taxes are light,
so they are content in their dwellings,
and their customs flourish.
Though neighboring states are close enough to hear roosters crow and dogs bark,
yet without desires or demands,
each attains what they need,
and thus they reach old age and die
without visiting one another.
This is the pinnacle of governance.
Laozi’s exposition of the teaching of Dao and virtue—
his intent lies here.’

**Scripture** says:
*"Faithful words are not ornate,
ornate words are not faithful.
The virtuous do not argue,
those who argue are not virtuous.
The wise are not learned,
the learned are not wise.
The Sage accumulates nothing.
The more one gives to others, the more one possesses.
The more one bestows upon others, the more one has.
The Dao of Heaven benefits without harming,
the Dao of the Sage acts without contending."*

*The Commentary* says:
‘Faithful and true words need not be ornate,
for they are plain in substance.
Ornate and beautiful words need not be faithful,
for they are superficial in form.
The virtuous in heart need not argue,
for they are rooted in simplicity.
Those skilled in speech need not be virtuous,
for they value eloquence.
The wise in essence need not be learned,
for less is more in understanding.
The learned in affairs need not be wise,
for excess leads to confusion.
The Sage bestows virtue without private gain,
so they accumulate nothing.
Exhausting virtue for others,
one’s own virtue grows ever greater;
exhausting benefit for others,
one’s own benefit grows ever more abundant.
The Dao of Heaven—
in spring and summer it nurtures and stores,
in autumn and winter it matures and ripens—
this is to benefit without harming.
The Dao of the Sage—
it follows the natural order of things,
yet does not contend with them,
for it models itself after Heaven.’
